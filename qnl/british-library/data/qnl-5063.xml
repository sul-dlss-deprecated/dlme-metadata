MC392FD2 SECTION 2. Foreign Eepresentatives. French Consulate .—Monsieur G. Cassin lield charge throughout the year. During the summer he spent about 4 months at Shiraz, returning to Bushire on the 28th October. He informed the Governor that his jurisdiction had been extended to include Kerman, Shiraz and Mohammerah. Forwegzan Vice-Consul ate .—The Hon'ble Lieutenart-Colcnel H. V. Biscoe, Political Besident in the Persian Gulf and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, remained in charge of the archives of the Norwegian Vice-Consulate during the whole year with the exception of 4 months when he was on leave. The Persian Government at first refused to recognise him as Norwegian Vice- Consul, on the ground that the consular representative of a country must be one of its own nationals. Discussions on the subject between the Persian and Norwegian Governments continued till June when the Persian Government finally recognised His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General as being charged with the protection of Norwegian interests. Dutch Consulate.—The French Consul, Bushire, remained in charge of the Dutch Consulate throughout the year. Russian Consulate-General .—The Bussian Consulate building continued to be occupied by the staff, of the Soviet Eastern Trading Company throughout the year. The Bussian Consul-General for Pars, M. Polycarpe Ananief, visited Bushire from the 4th April to the 19th when he returned to Shiraz. He stayed at the Consulate and exchanged visits with the Hon’ble the Political Besident and also with the Governor of the Gulf Ports. This was the first occasion since dip lomatic relations were renewed that a Soviet Consul-General called personally on the Political Besident. J He again visited Bushire in October and introduced the Manager of the Soviet Eastern Trading Company, M. Alexander Simikoff. He remonstrated un successfully with the Governor against the Police prohibition on the Soviet Company illuminating a red star on their flag staff at night. He flew back to Shiraz on the 16th October. q • 7t J 1 ^ ovem |?® r t ^ ie Soviet Eastern Trading Company celebrated the Soviet National Day. They gave a reception in the Bussian Consulate build- W -V 3 a ^ en( e( ^ about 50 merchants, but no officials were present. M. Simikoff, Manager of the Company, announced to the audience that a treaty liad ]ust been signed between Persia and Russia, which would further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries. German Consulate Junkers Company’s pliots and mechanics occupied the German Consulate building during the first half of the year. • The appeal filed by Herr Wassmuss before the Sunreme Court Tehran (vide last years report) was decided in his favour, the court holding that the claim of the sons of Shaikh Husain was a false one. His property was therefore released agfd'about 52 Germany - He dled suddeill y ^ Berlin on the 29th November 193B Imjportant Visitors. Japanese .—No local representative. Mr. Akio Kasama, the Japanese Minister-Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, accompanied by a Secretary, arrived at Bushire from Tehran on the 29th anuaiy by air On his landing at the aerodrome he was received by the Governor of the Persian I orts, and by a few merchants interested in the opium trade He left ° n th6 1St Feb ™ ar &gt;’ 1931 ^e Governor Deputy™^ M^ssShraf 11 ^ Muh “ d ^eza Bahbehani, who is *He left a card on His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, and the latter called upon him. The Minister returned the call. The French Consul entertained him at luncheon. A rumour followed this visit that a Japanese Steamship Company proposed to ply in the Gulf, but nothing materialized by the end of the year. British Interests. The Indo-European Telegraph Department. —On the 1st March 1931 the Indo- European Telegraph Department ceased to exist. From that date all land lines were handed over to the representatives of the Persian Government, while the cable stations at Bushire, Henjam, Jask, and Charbar were handed over to the Imperial and International Communications Limited. Thus ended a 60 year old control of the telegraphs in Persia linking up India with Europe. The decision to give up these lines was due to the introduction of more modern methods of com munication between India and England, which had resulted in a great reduction of traffic, and an ever increasing annual loss to the Indo-European Telegraph De partment and the Indo-European Telegraph Company. The abolition of the Department, which had been rendering the most valuable services to the Political Officers in Persia and Persian Gulf, is much regretted. Aqa Humayunfur, on behalf of the Persian Government, took over the Indo- European Telegraph Department stores at Bushire. SECTION 3. Local Government. Governor of the Gulf Ports, Islands, Dashti and Dashtistan. —His Excellency Aqa Muzaffar Khan Aalam, Sardar-i-Intisar, held charge till the 9th Feb ruary, when he left for Shiraz on appointment as Governor General of Fars in addition to his duties as Governor of the Gulf Ports. The local work at Bushire was carried on by Aqa Muhammad Khan Zand, Assistant Governor, Bushire, but the arrangement was a thoroughly unsatisfactory one, Sardar-i-Intisar himself admitting that it was much too onerous a charge for one man. Finally on the 20th July Sardar-i-Intisar was recalled to Tehran. His dismissal is believed to have been brought about by the Military with whom he had serious differences. He was popular with the people of the Southern Ports and was certainly an energetic and hard working official. His relations with the Residency were friendly. He was succeeded by Aqa Ali Asghar Khan Taliqani, who arrived at Bushire from Tehran on the 26th July from which date the Governorate of the Gulf Ports was separated from Fars. Aqa Taliqani has served most of his service in the Finance Department in Northern Persia, and knows English in addition to French and Russian. A sensible and quiet official, he has been most friendly and obliging and of assistance to the Residency whenever that has been possible. Assistant Governor of the Gulf Ports.—Kqp Muhammad Khan Zand held the post throughout the year. He has been giving most of his time to the Municipality, where he has made certain improvements. Deputy Governor of Borazjan. —Mirza Nasrullah Khan Plikmat. A commission of Inspection from Tehran found him guilty of taking bribes. He pleaded force of circumstances, explaining that his monthly pay was Tomans 40 only and he received no allowances either for a clerk or for a farrash, while he was expected to maintain an establishment befitting a Governor. He was despatched to Shiraz. Officer Commanding, Troops. —Yawar Mahmud Khan Perveen throughout the year. He proceeded on two months’ leave on the 24th August, and during his absence his Adjutant, Lieutenant Mazaheri, acted for him. Officer Commanding, the A^mniyah. —Lieutenant Ali Asghar Khan till the 26th September, when Yawar Abu Turab Majd assumed charge. The Yawar is spoken of as a good man. During the War he served under General Sykes in the South Persia Rifles.mm Finance Department. —Mirza Mehdi Khan Zahedi remained in charge till the 17th May, when a Commission of Inspection from Tehran found him guilty of both corruption and embezzlement to the extent of Tomans 20,000. He was despatched to Tehran on the 9th June under military escort. He was succeeded by Hasan Khan Matin-us-Sultan Farzad who was relieved on the 15th July by Aqa Mirza Izzatullah Khan Shujai. Hasan Khan Farzad accompanied by his wife left for Tehran on the 21st July but before reaching Borazjan the party was attacked by robbers who carried away all their belongings including the clothes they stood up in. On receipt of news two suits of clothing were sent out for them from Bushire. On the 8th September about 100 inhabitants of Dashti arrived at Bushire and complained to the Governor against the exactions of the Bevenue Collector Mirza Hasan Khan, who was demanding a tax of krans 2 per date tree. The Governor sent the Revenue Director and the Assistant Governor to make enquiries and report. As a result of their report the revenue demand was reduced to 36 cents per date tree. Police Department. —Yawar Ghulam Husain Khan Behzadi held charge till the 24th February, when he was transferred to Kerman, and Sultan Ghulam Husain Danishpur assumed charge at Bushire. Aqa Muhammad Khan Jazib remained in charge of the Security Department till the middle of January when Mirza Abbas Khan Uriyan relieved him and held charge till the end of the year. Muhammad Khan Jazib was notoriously corrupt The jurisdiction of the Bushire Police Office was curtailed in February to Dilum on the one side and Borazjan on the other, Lmgah and Henjam being placed under the Chief of Police at Bandar Abbas. On the 5th September 10 policemen took refuge in the Imamzadeh shrine out side the town, as a protest against harsh treatment by their superior. They were assured of good treatment by the Chief of Police, but refused to leave the sanctuary till the Assistant Governor himself appeared and gave them assurances of safety. The custom of taking “ bast ” formerly common in Persia, has been dying out during the Pahlavi reign and this is the first instance that has occurred for many years. J Department of Justice. Aqa Muhammad Ali Khan Pishwa held charge till the 30th July when Mirza Mehdi Khan Shariatmadar relieved him. J ^ ( l a ^ resigned as his salary was not increased, and he is now working as a Pleader at Tehran. His reputation as a judge was good. It may be mentioned to his credit that m the case of the influential local firin'“ Kazeruni ” against the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation for a claim of Ts. 240,000 for 100 cases of opium he refused to be influenced and dismissed the case. His successor on the other hand is known to accept even the smallest bribe. Edumtion Department-U October Shaikh Muhammad Husain, Acting Direc tor, was found guilty of defalcations, and dismissed. Saiyid Muhammad Farzan arrived from Tehran and assumed charge till the close of the year. Owing to curtailment of the budget, no new schools were opened. The Madressah-i-Saadat, the only national High School for boys in Bushire was confronted with financial difficulties at the end of the year, and proposal were put forward to have it subsidised by Government. The headmaster is accused of having misappropriated school funds, which are raised by subscription. , JPtt a ^J el ^ ns {r k ^ Haii Khan Sihhatpur acted as Provincial Direc- wWriveV Am Tew' reUeVed by ^ Ahmad Khan ^negan with. Unlike Aqa Shahruzi, the new Provincial Director is a courteous man to deal In July instructions were received from Tehran to onen a scbnnl at , the trammg of signallers and Postal clerks, but the idL was kter gi^en up for climatic reasons and candidates are now sent to Tehran for training. ^ M ,“ and Qnrantim. -Doctor Abul Qasim Khan Bahrami remained as Thief Medical, Quarantine and Health Officer for the Southern ports “gh ou t the n5 He was given cliarge of Shiraz in addition, and in the month of October shifted his headquarters from Bushire to Shiraz. The local Weekly pointed out that this would impair the efficiency of the Quarantine Department. Some people telegraph ed to Tehran asking that Dr. Bahrami should remain in Bushire. Doctor Muniri arrived at Bushire on the 18th February and held the post of Health and Quarantine Officer, Bushire, throughout the year. His wife holds a French Diploma in Midwifery and held charge of the local Maternity Hospital for some time at Tomans 80 per mensem. Census Department.—Aq&amp; Abdul Majid Khan Ferrohi (the only Sunni Persian official at Bushire) continued to hold charge of the Department till the 20th July, when Aqa Qawami relieved him, and he left for Ahwaz. Aqa Ferrohi was a man of literary tastes and his good treatment was appre ciated by the people. On the 8th May Mirza Ibrahim Khan Mumtaz, Director of Census for the South, arrived at Bushire from Shiraz. As a result of his inspection, a clerk was arrested for corruption. Customs Department .—Monsieur A. Stas (Belgian) held charge of the Provin cial Directorate till the 26th July, when he left for Belgium for good after some 30 years in Persia. Though personally quite pleasant he was afraid to take the smallest responsibility and was entirely in the hands of his subordmates. Temporary arrangements continued till the 11th September, when Mirza Habibullah Khan Bahrazi arrived from Tehran and assumed charge of the Direc torate. He is a most pleasant official to deal with and is always helpful and obliging within the latitude accorded him by his regulations. In consequence of certain complaints made by the merchants of Bandar Abbas, Monsieur P. Wolters (Belgian) was sent back to Bushire on the 19th Jan uary. He held the post of Inspector-General for a few months, but in the month of April a Commission of Inspection arrived from Tehran and inspected the Customs, and he and several other customs officials were sent to Tehran, charged with taking bribes. In the case of M. Vvffilters the charges were not pressed, and he was allowed to leave the country, but his contract was not renewed. On the 7th December, Monsieur L. B. Vandenrydt (Belgian), Special Ins pector of Customs, arrived at Bushire—an elderly man, he has been newly engaged by the Persian Government, and is quite inexperienced, and probably too old to learn. Municipality.-ID iq Bushire Municipality was presided over by Saiyid Husain Siadat as usual. The Assistant Governor, Aqa Muhammad Khan Zand, acted in an advisory capacity to the Municipality. The work of widening and improving the streets slackened on the transfer of Sardar-i-Intisar, Governor, to Shiraz. In July the Bushire Weekly “ Khalij-i-Iran ” commented on the inactivity of the Municipal Committee, and pointed out that persons suffering from contagious diseases were allowed to sell food articles in the bazaar, baths were not inspected, and no attention was paid to the roads. Stirred by this criticism the Mumcipalny raised the tax on Hotels to Krans 60 per mensem. This raised a strong protest and the Hotel Keepers went on a strike and closed the hotels. Two days later. the Municipality reduced it to normal rate of Krans 20 per mensem. The income of the Municipality for a period of four months, from 23rd March 1931 to 24th July 1931, amounted to Krans 27,203*00 and after deducting expendi ture, a net balance of Krans 3,000-00 only was in hand. In the last quarter of the year the Municipality decided to increase its income of Tomans 36,000 per annum to be raised by taxes. It increased the weighing tax as from the 15th October and in some items the increase was quintupled. In the month of December, the Municipality resolved to open two more ave nues, one bisecting the town from East to West and the other from North to South. To effect'this project it will be necessary to pull own 60 houses and it naturally meets with much opposition from the house-owners. MC392FD ^\ 6 The Municipality have great difficulty in recovering taxes as manM person# have become impoverished owing to depression of trade. Several traders left for Shiraz during the year. SECTION 4. Military. General—In June the Amniyah headquarters and barracks were shifted_ from the town to Bahmani village (adjoining the Telegraphs) and accommodated in the commodious building called Malik’s House, which has been rented for the purpose. Recruitment .—The Recruiting Office which was opened in 1930 at Bushire was closed down on the 9th July, when Yawar Khan Lar Khan, Recruiting Officer left for Tehran. A large number of exemptions, chiefly on grounds of health, were granted. The population of Bushire is notoriously unhealthy, and in many instances the exemp tions were justified, though a certain number were obtained by bribery. There were occasional desertions. Disarming Campaign .—The efforts commenced during the last two years to disarm the population were continued during the year under review. During the months of March and April the Kerman Regiment commanded by' IBarhang Abdullah Alburzi Khan visited the Shibkuh region and had collected about 1,200 rifles by the 15th April when most of the force moved to Dashti, where 341 rifles were collected. Later on the military recovered 100 rifles and 2 machine guns. These machine guns had been captured last year by the tribesmen from the military. With the help of Reza Quli Khan of'Ziarat, the Military disarmed most of the inhabitants in the Dashti and Dashtistan districts. In Balook (in Dashti) Shaikh Abdur Rasul, son of the late Shaikh Husain of Chahkotah, tried to avoid surrender ing his arms, and was called to Bushire. His Nadkhuda was flogged until he dis closed the presence of 80 rifles hidden in the Shaikh’s house. The Shaikh was des patched to Tehran. Rais Asad, a rebel, captured Baghak in September, but was dislodged. On the 21st September, he killed an Amniyah guard and wounded another. He then occupied Khaviz and turned out all Shirazis who were preparing lime-juice for export. He, however, surrendered in October, after several encounters with the Military. In the first week of October, an Amniyah detachment was besieged in Oli village, and only released on the intervention of one Saiyid Bahmiar on the condi tion that they would cease disarming the place. In August 2 of the 4 old 21 C. M. Austrian howitzers were sent from Bushire to Shiraz. 800 soldiers arrived in November at Borazjan to operate in Dashti and Tangistan. 900 arms mostly old rifles were recovered from Dashti and despatched to Shiraz Kt the end of the year. u-n In t! 16 } 3St Wee ^ of P ecem ^ er rebels who were holding out in inaccessible hills m Dashti attacked the Government troops and killed about 40 soldiers in one action. Persian Marine. Bushire Port. On the 26th January 1931 Colonel E. Y. Co]her, Engineer of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, Abadan, arrived at Lusmre irom Abadan m order to advise the Persian authorities regarding the pos- si nlitv ot constructing a port at Bushire. He informed the Governor of the Per sian Ions that the existing charts were of such,doubtful accuracy that a detailed survey .womd be necessary which would probably cost £5,000 to £6,000 while a very rough estimate of the cost of work was £150,000. He suggested that the 1 usuii Government should get into touch with one of the large firms of contrac tors that specialise m this kind of work. 6The Governor reported this to Tehran, but no action appears to have been taken in the matter. Persian Navy.—On the 31st August the Persian boat “ Chalchileh ” left Bushire for Mohammerah to remain under the orders of the Military. In September about 58 conscripts from Bushire and a larger number from Mohammerah were sent to Italy to be trained for service in the Persian Navy. There are said to be about 250 Persian officers and men undergoing naval training in Italy. During the year the two sloops and four patrol boats ordered by the Persian Government were launched at Palermo in presence of the Persian Crown Prince and His Excellency Teymourtache. These ships were expected to arrive in the Gulf in the autumn of 1932 with an Italian Mission of 15 Naval officers on board. SECTION 5. Aviation. British. —Imperial Airways weekly mail service between England and India passed through Bushire with moderate punctuality. During the winter months the Eastbound machines usually arrived late. They introduced large airliners of the “ Hannibal ” type at the end of the year. The service is gaining in reputation. Many private British machines landed at Bushire for refuelling. German. —The Junkers Company maintained an efficient and regular Postal and passenger service between Bushire-Shiraz-Isfahan-Tehran, but towards the end of the year there were rumours that it was going to be discontinued for financial reasons. On the 19th September a Junkers seaplane bound for China landed at Bushire and left next morning. She carried on board a German Admiral in the Chinese Service. A German lady aviator Fraulein Elli Beinborn en route from Germany to Saigon force landed on the 17th December at Dilum, but was not hurt. She came to Bushire by car and carried to Diium necessary parts to repair her plane. She was fortunate enough to find an American pilot (Mr. Stevens) with his private machine in Bushire, and was enabled through his assistance to get her own machine put right within a day or.two. French .—The Air Orient Company maintained a fortnightly service between Paris and Saigon during the year, but it was very irregular. The K. L. M. Company maintained a weekly service between Amsterdam and Batavia throughout the year. SECTION 6. Political Situation. Conditions in the Bushire hinterland have been disturbed. The Government measures in respect of dress regulation, conscription, disarming, and restrictions on trade are resented by the population in general and the Dashtis and Tangistanis in particular. Fearing a rising the Government kept troops operating in Dashti and Tangistan as well as in the Shibkuh region throughout the year. There has not been much co-operation between the Civil and Military autho rities. That Tehran still upholds the Military over the Civil view is best illustrated by the case of Sardar-i-Intisar, who was recalled from the Governor-Generalship of Fars, and the Ports, etc., owing to complaints from the Military authorities.The sons of Shaikh Husain of Chahkutah, whom Sardar-i-Intisar was able to use last year on the side of Government against the rebel Ghazanfar-us-Sultanah of Borzajan, themselves rebelled against the Government as a result of the tact less behaviour of the Military and in the month of April, Shaikh Nasir Khan, son of Shaikh Husain Khan, with some thirty armed men occupied Chaghadak (lately the headquarters and farm of Herr Wassmuss) about 16 miles to the east of Bushire, and bastinadoed the headman to whom the Persian Government had leased the village. By the end of the year, however, most of the headmen' had been rounded up and despatched to Tehran. At the beginning of the year whilst the Kerman regiment was operating in the Shibkuh region, the Officer Commanding seized all the Arab headmen 13 in all— and sent them under escort to Tehran. 1 his wholesale arrest and deportation seriously increased the unrest in that region, and the leading Shaikh of Teben, Shaikh Muhammad bin Ahmad Khalfan, who escaped arrest mustered the re maining Arabs and at the close of the year was still holding out against Govern ment troops estimated to number between one and two thousand. Shaikh Muham mad bin Ahmad Khalfan visited Bahrain and Hasa and wished to proceed to Riadh, but the Amir of Hasa discouraged him from proceeding further than Hofuf. He ultimately returned to Teben and on the 12th November attacked a Persian cus toms launch and shot dead an Inspector and wounded an Amniyah guard. At a service held in memory of the deceased Inspector, Mulla Abdullah al Fazil, a blind pleader and “ Rozakhan 35 of Bushire made certain references to the services rendered by the late Colonel Muhammad Taqi Khan (supporter of Saiyid Zia-ud-D n and the late Khiyabani (a republican) both o c whom were viewed by the present Shah as his rivals. The Mulla was promptly placed under arrest and deported. SECTION 7. Slavery. During the year under review the following slaves were manumitte d by order of the Hon’ble the Political Resident:— Slaves who escaped from the Trucial coast and took refuge at the Bahrain Agency .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 15 Slaves who took refuge with the Residency Agent, Shargah .. .. 16 Slaves from Basidu who took refuge at the Bahrain Agency .. .. 4 SECTION 8. Trade and Trade Facilities. Trade .—Of conditions during 1930 it was generally said, by way of conso lation, that at least they could hardly be worse and that the commercially dis astrous situation created by the Government arbitrary control of exchange, was too impossible to last. Events of 1931 were to show, however, that the Govern ment’s incursions into the realms of economics during the preceding year were as nothing compared with what was to follow. The year opened with gloomy prospects. Abroad there was no market for Persian produce ; at home prices for all commodities were rising ; the price of silver was at the lowest ebb, the kran with it (as regards illegal bazaar transactions) and any prospect of the gold standard being introduced at any early date doubtful in the extreme. It was patent to everybody that the Government’s control of ex change had proved a fiasco. In practice, as a result of the resale system whereby the banks were buying exchange on the condition, imposed by the seller, that it should be resold to the person he designated, and from whom he recovered the difference between the official and bazaar rate, the effect of the exchange law was merelv to penalise the exporter, who had to guarantee to sell exchange against his exports at the official rate, while the importer, obtaining his exchange in the bazaar, couldimport what he liked—quite the opposite of the original intentions of the Govern ment. the latter, however, was in no way deterred by its unfavourable experience in the matter of exchange control and in February, shortly after the raising of the kran sterling rate to 90 ( a measure taken too late in the day to have any practical effect), decided to make all foreign trade a state monopoly and control all imports and exports directly. The reasons given for this drastic step were, firstly, the need for balancing the country’s foreign trade before introducing the gold standard, and secondly? the desire to check Russian dumping and their ever increasing hold on the Persian market. The general outline of the trade monopoly law of February 25th which was ratified by the Majlis on March 11th, 1931 was as follows Imports divided into two categories (A) those which may be imported by private traders and in regard to which quotas are to be fixed each year before June 22nd and apportioned out between the various customs ports and, (B) imports prohibited by the Government alto gether. Imports can only be made under licence issued by the Ministry of national Economy, application for permission to import goods to any given amount requiring to be accompanied by a Customs export certificate testifying to the export of an equivalent amount of Persian produce. Exporters have to guarantee to sell to the Government within a period not exceeding eight months the foreign exchange proceeds of their exports, but if they import goods under class (A) above, their value will be deducted from the total amount of their obligation to sell exchange. For certain exports, however, which constitute a monopoly such as opium, the exporter can only import up to 20% of the value of his exports and has to sell to the Government foreign exchange in respect of the remaining 80%, while the export of oil carries with it no corresponding right to import. Import licences are not transferable but export certificates can be disposed of. The actual import quotas for the first year (i.e., 22nd June 1931 to 22nd June 1932) are based on the Customs figures for the two years ending March 1929. At its inception the Trade Monopoly Law was hailed almost universally with satisfaction as it was assumed to be primarily directed against Russian dumping. This enthusiasm was short-lived, however, when the details of the scheme became known and the practical difficulties arising out of its applications made themselves felt. Its immediate effect was to bring trade to a standstill. The quota for the first quarter after the introduction of the Law, i.e., from March 22nd to June 22nd, and preceding the economic year proper was, it is true, almost entirely taken up, but almost exclusively by applications for the import of goods already in the Customs or expected to arrive. Moreover, since for this first quarter applications for permission to import required to be accompanied only by a guarantee to export and not an actual export certificate, there is little doubt that many speculators without goods either in the Customs or ordered, must have applied for permission to import, while the Russians, who had large stocks in the Customs at the commencement of the year, filled a very large part of the quota themselves. The absurdity of the scheme in its original unmodified form is well illustrated by the fact that the Persian Government required all applications for the first half of the economic year (June to December) to be in by June 11th, and these applica tions, it is to be borne in mind, had to be accompanied by actual export certi ficates. In other words sufficient exports were expected to go out of the country between March and June to balance the imports for the next six months ! And this at a period when export is usually at its dullest! In point of fact by June 12th only 62 applications in respect of the first quarter of the economic year and representing only 25% of the quota for that period had been received and a decree was accordingly published extending the date for receipt of applications to August 12th. This did not help matters much since exports from March to June totalled approximately • 76 millions sterling only, while the quotas to be filled by August (against exports already shipped) in respect of the period March to December 1931, amounted to something like six million pounds. The natural result of this state MC392FD -p,10 of affairs was for export certificates, which are transferable, to fetch at one time as much as 30% of their face value, while imported articles and all exportable com modities greatly advanced in price, the market for the latter being artificially stimulated owing to the desire of all and sundry to lay hold on something export able in order to bring in imports for which an ever-increasmg price was to be ob tained. Two points regarding the working of this amazing law during the period under review are sufficiently clear. In the first place, far from checking the Russian tactics, it has given into their hands a tool which should go a long way to help them in their policy of disturbing and disorganising the Persian market. While on paper it may theoretically compel them to take as much Persia n produce as they im port Russian, they can, by buying up export certificates and actual produce, control the market far more accurately and completely than they ever could before, and in whatever part of the country they may desire. The facility with which they can ex ercise this control is well brought out by their action at the inception of the Monopoly. Of the first quarter’s quota they took up no less than 48%, including 63% of the sugar and 54% of the cotton prints quotas, while as regards the first half of the Economic year (June to December), when it was found that applications were not coming forward, the lists were again reopened after August 12th for the benefit of the Russians, who, by the 30th, had made applications covering 76% of the total quotas allowed for this period including 68% of the cotton piece-goods quotas. Applications which, it may be assumed, were not accompanied by actual export certificates. In the second place the law has accentuated a process, encouraged under the exchange control law, which cannot continue indefinitely, namely, the export and sale abroad of Persian produce at a loss in order to permit of imports on which the importer could, thanks to the high level of prices of foreign articles obtaining, count on making up his export loss and a handsome profit besides. By the autumn, in the height of the exporting season, this process became most exaggerated. All manner of produce was being shipped with little or no thought to its eventually finding a market, but simply in order to obtain import permits for the entry of the goods which would be sold to the Persian consumer at a price which would cover any loss on the exports. Thus the country was being drained of real wealth in the shape of produce dumped abroad, which dumping the population were financing in the shape of high prices paid for all commodities internally. The achievements of the Government in the realm of economics during the year are quickly enumerated. More taxes, more and paralysing restrictions on trade, and the surrender of an ever increasing control of the country’s commerce to the Russians. The result has been an exaggeration of the tendencies to be ob served during the previous year. Still there appears to be no thought of checking the pace either of expenditure or of the issue of new and bewildering legislation regarding trade. Railway construction is still prosecuted—Warships are to be bought—ambitious town planning schemes are pursued—the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Royalties are still earmarked for a reformed currency whose introduction is ever doubtful, but little or nothing is spent on roads or in other ways calculated to foster trade. In Bushire the trend of the previous year was continued and accentuated. Prices of all commodities rose, money became tighter than ever, and more and more merchants were obliged to fall out of foreign trade. The bazaar remained dull throughout the year. In February it was rudely upset by the sudden addition, without any warning, of 60% to the Customs Surtax, while at the end of March trade was completely dislocated by the Trade Monopoly Law. Thereafter it lan guished until August when conditions improved somewhat as merchants began to adjust themselves to the new state of affairs. In the absence of the Customs figures it is difficult to give any very accurate idea of the effect of the monopoly law on British trade. The general trend, how ever, is made sufficiently clear by the import figures of the British India Steam Navigation Company whose ships carry by far the largest proportion of Bushire exports and imports. Only 8,000 freight tons were imported during the year compared with 16,000 in 1930. On the other hand nine Russian ships visited the Gulf as against eight the previous year and Sharq’s control pf the market be came virtually complete. So much so that they were able to withhold credit11 \ as m- % ft- )b- ler iau elp on m- rol in BX- ¥ ie ;ie lot of he as. )rt be nd he m, yi Hy he in mg he on to )b- ng ion be Oil ion ted ed. ,nd led on, rch an* gan •ate ow- ;am hire rear ited be- edit altogether, and were, in fact, in the majority of cases, making the sale of the-piece - goods and other first-class commodities conditional upon the purchasers acceptance of old stocks of tinned fish, Samovars, etc., which had remained on their hands Kussian predominance is well illustrated by the fact that, in the middle of the year* the only new stock of cotton prints and shirtings to be found in the bazaar were of Soviet origin. The fact that no Russian ship called at Bushire between the end of May and the end of August suggested, at first sight, that the Russians were also feeling the effects of the Trade Monopoly Law, until it transpired that their absence was due to Political motives and was, in reality, connected with the closing of the northern frontier in the middle of April : a step taken by the Russians to bring pressure to bear on the Persians with a view to accelerating the conclusion of the new trade agreement between the two countries. After much discussion the Russian Com mercial Treaty was signed on October 27th but did not come into force before the end of the year. This Treaty seems likely to set the seal on Russian trade supre macy in Persia for some time to come. It concedes to Russia no less than 52% of the total import trade of Persia including a monopoly of all sugar, matches, and oil imports, and 55% of all cotton tissue imports. If the events of the past year afford little ground for optimism the future holds out a promise hardly less dreary where British and Indian commercial interests are concerned. In the Russians they are faced with a competitor who has obvious ly come to stay, whose position is assured by treaty and who, being actuated by political rather than commercial motives, cannot be opposed by the usual weapons of commercial rivalry. But the Russians are not the only obstacle to a revival of trade. Thanks to the Persian Government’s economic policy and heavy increase in taxation the price of all commodities continues to rise and the purchasing power of the population continues to decrease. To make matters worse a bad harvest in 1931, followed by almost total absence of rain and the prospects of no harvest at all in 1932, confront the wretched inhabitants of the Persian littoral of the Gulf with a serious shortage of both grain and water. Under the circumstances the outlook for British trade in this district cannot be regarded as other than extremely black. Communications. —Transport facilities have remained much as during the previous year and rates lower than ever. The firm of H. S. M. R. Kazerooni and Sons’ transport service was increased to some 40 lorries, but cannot be said to have fulfilled its early promise. In fact the serious difficulties in which this firm found itself at the end of the year are largely attributed to the heavy capital out lay made on the purchase of lorries and plant, which has not only failed to give any return, but on the contrary involved heavy operating losses. In May Junkers air service to Tehran was reduced from two to one trip per week. No arrangement had been come to by the end of the year for the concession this Company enjoys from the Persian Government to be renewed although the agreement is due to terminate in January 1932. The French ,£ Air Orient ” and Dutch K. L. M. lines mamtained bi-monthly services through Bushire to Indo-China and Batavia respectively. The concession for both Companies to use the Persian route, due to expire at the end of the year, was extended to the date of expiry of Imperial Airways’ concession {i.e., April 1932). The Bush:re-Shiraz road remained open practically throughout the year and proved impassable to wheeled traffic only during the major part of February when the Mashileh was rendered boggy by rain. A certain amount of work was done on the passes, bends being widened and the surface much improved in places. A coastal road from Bushire to Lingah is projected and the building of a raised causeway across the Mashileh spoken of. Security .—Cases of brigandage occurred, but they were isolated and on the whole security may be said to have been good. Smuggling. —With a further imposition of 60% customs surcharge in February making a total of 80%, and the restrictions and rise in prices resulting from the trade monopoly law, smugglers could hardly be expected to remain idle. In July in fact, sugar brought in by smugglers in the Dashti ports was said to be causing a decline in the price of that commodity in Shiraz, but on the whole there was little ifOvmn ]2 evidence to show that large quantities of goods were being smuggled in, though reports of encounters of smugglers with the customs preventive service were frequent. In December a new Belgian Inspector of Customs was appointed to Bushire, who is, it is gathered, to devote his attention largely to the suppression of smug- gling. Postal Facilities .—Junkers service was reduced to one flight per week from May onwards. The Dutch and French services to the Far East ran to a fairly regular bi-monthly schedule throughout the year. Otherwise postal facilities remained as before. Foreign Commercial Enterprise .—promise of the establishment of a freight £ plane ’ service by Junkers between Bushire and Shiraz did not materialise, and after a few flights of an experimental nature the scheme was abandoned. In May, as already stated, Junkers service was reduced from two to one flight per week and there was talk at the end of the year of the Company’s withdrawal from Persia unless a new contract on more advantageous terms could be obtained from the Persian Government. The Hansa Line continued their sailings to the Gulf, and 3 vessels of the Ame rican Silver Line called at Bushire during the summer. The Russians, as during the previous year, have made considerable progress in Southern Persian markets at the expense of British interests. Their activities have been dealt with in Section 1 above. National Bank .—The majority of Bushire merchants have found it desirable to open accounts with this bank which would now appear to share such business as is offering with the Imperial Bank though naturally being favoured as regards offlcial transactions. The Foreign Exchange Law tended to deprive the Banks of overseas business since holders of exchange engaged in Foreign Trade and conduct ing their operations at bazaar rates of exchange, not unnaturally forbore to deal through them. Under the new Russo-Persian Commercial Treaty it looks as if the marketing of all sugar imports will be placed in the hands of the National Bank, but definite details in this connection were still lacking at the end of the year. Opium. —Exports amounted to 3,374 cases as compared with 5,686 in 1930. Of these no less than 2,564 constituted illicit shipments as against 2,823 in the higher total of the previous year. So much for the original announcement that only legitimate licensed shipments would be permitted under the monopoly ; so much also for the statements of the Persian representative, M. Hussein Ala at Geneva in January at the 9th Meeting of the Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium, to the effect that the Persian export monopoly imposed a formal obligation on the licence-holder to produce for each package exported a certificate issued by the importing country. The terms of the monopoly were modified, notably as regards the sale of USOjOGO to the Government in the first year, for the fulfilment of which obligation a period of two years was finally conceded, while according to the Bushire Customs, the tax was finally fixed at Rials 1,250 equivalent to £62-10-0 per case. It transpired that the driving force behind the monopoly was being supplied by the notorious 7 wh ° ^PP 1 ^ something like 20% of the share capital of 100 shares n L: a?’ ^ ller f s0( ; lates being Behbehani with some 30% and the Pahlevi Bank . the fehah) with 8%. Kazerooni is understood to have originally been allocated 14 shares, which he finally left on Behbehani’s hands. . ^bh tb 0 lowering of the official rate to Krs. 90 to £ in February and nego tiations for the sale of 2,300 cases to the Japanese over a period of 20 months at an hp^ a f e - P m e °!i £2 °r P er ° ase ’ the P^spects of the monopoly may be said to have than ^ be ® n antlcl P ated - But this deal fell through, as did also f ° r a Y lllclt shipment of 1,500 cases, and in the light of the export figures the monopoly cannot oe said to have had a very good year The lack of opmm^wS n%rtr i ^ able t0 ^ com P etition aff °rded by Anatolian J tbe middle of the year, was understood to be priced in Singapore is said to hoToiV hi ? °^satisfactory owing to lack of codein content, Persian opium a e 01 e ^ ar Eastern market if mixed in equal proportion withPrices obtained during the year have varied between £160 to £200 per case. In the autumn Haji Amin-ut-Tujjar was endeavouring to find purchasers at $ 800 (American) f. o. b. Bushire or about £165 (gold). At this rate it is calculated that an aggregate profit (including an estimated figure of Tomans 340 a case as the amount realised on sale of the export certificate acquired) of about Tomans 650 per case is obtainable. What will be the future of the monopoly it is difficult to foresee. It is certainly very unpopular with most of the larger merchants in the opium growing district and Behbehani in Bushire, who handles all shipments for Amin, is never anything but pessimistic. The crop for 1931 was about 50% bigger than that of the previous year (the official figure given is 300,000 batmans or close on 900 tons). Writing in the press on January 3rd, 1932 the concessionaire stated that the monopoly had already bought up 600 tons of this and would buy the remainder before the new crop. The fact remains however that the monopoly had at the end of the year same 4,000 cases (about 300 tons) still on their hands, rather more than they were able to ship in the previous twelve months. They would hardly appear likely to be in a position therefore, to buy up much of the 1932 crop when it comes into the market, and failure to do so is sure to cause loud outcry and opposition to the monopoly gene rally. The Government of course have it in their power to make matters very much easier for the monopoly, either by reducing the excessive tax, or sanctioning the issue of export certificates to the full value of the amount exported, instead of only 20% as at present. Hitherto, however, they seem to have been bent on a policy which if pursued much further can hardly, on the face of it, fail to end in the monopoly’s early dissolution. MC392FD F14 APPENDIX I. Note on the working of the Residency Dispensary, Bushire, for the year 1931. Major H. J. H. Symons, I.M.S., held charge of the appointment of Residency Surgeon from 1st January to 9th August and from 21st October to 31st December 1931. First Class Assistant Surgeon M. L. A. Steele, I.M.D., was in sub-charge of the Dispensary from 1st January to 25th June and from llth November to 31st December 1931. Second Class Assistant Surgeon R. Easey, I.M.D., officiated as sub-charge of the Residency Dispen sary during the absence on leave of Assistant Surgeon M. L. A. Steele and during the absence on leave of Major H. J. H. Symons, Assistant Surgeon Easey also held charge of the appointment of Residency Surgeon. Sub-Assistant Surgeon Jemadar Mohammed Ali Najmi was in sub-charge of the out-patient department from 1st January until 23rd November 1931, from which date the post was abolished. Climatically the first ten months of the year showed little departure from the normal but malaria seemed more prevalent than in 1930, though fewer cases of the cerebral variety were met with than in that year. The number of in-patient and out-door attendances, in comparison with those of 1930 ^T-e as follows In-patients, Out-patients, Operations, 1930 .. .. .. .. 67 9,346 235 1931 .. 49 13,136 279 From these figures it will be seen that there was a considerable increase in the number of out-patient attendances. This increase was in part due to the occurrence of a larger number of malaria and non-malarial fevers, in part due to an epidemic of influenza in the final six weeks of the year and again in part due to including attendances of the staff and their families of the P. W. D., E. &amp; M. Section at Dastak, Prior to March 1931, these individuals attended the Dispensary of the Indo-European Telegraph Department at Reshire and their numbers were not included in previous annual reports. Since 1st March 1931 these employees have been attended to by the Residency Surgeon. The total of operations increased by 44 in comparison with 1930, but operations classified as major operations fell from 69 to 43, The absence of the Residency Surgeon for two months may be considered as the principal cause of this decrease. Failure of the usual winter rains in November and December and a few days of unusually cold weather with a biting north wind was a contributory cause of a severe epidemic of influenza during the last six weeks of the year. During this epidemic a, very high percentage of cases of influenza developed Lobar and Broncho-pneumonia, Owing to the early contraction of Lobar- pneumonia by the hospital compounder, who eventually happily recovered, a great strain was put on the whole of the medical staff during these six weeks of 1931 and, it may be added, the first six weeks of 1932. In the town the epidemic really created alarm and pneumonia carried off several hundreds of the aged and infirm, who, ill-equipped with clothing which could give any measure of warmth housed in buildings more fitted to let in air than to keep out piercing north winds, and enfeebled by recurrent attacks of malaria throughout their lives, were on that account unable to put up sufficient resistance to so virulent an infection. With reference to the note appended to last year’s report concerning the Bushire Charitable Hospital it may be recorded that one hears many complaints against the inadequacy of the treatment accorded by the present officer in charge, Muniri, and his staff. The municipality are so dissatisfied that they have debated opening a municipal dispensary on the grounds that no medicines are to be had at the Charitable Hospital. They have also considered offering salaried employment for some hours a day to Sub-Assistant Surgeon Jemadar Mohammed Ali Najmi, I.M.D., (Retired), who is now carrying out private practice in Bushire, though the nationalist element in the Baladieh is opposed to employing a foreigner. Considering the present conditions of medical education in Persia it is not understood from where the nationalist elements in the Baladieh ponsider they would get anyone more satis factory than Muniri apd it is probable that the proposal will come to nought.APPENDIX II. Report on the working of the Quarantine on the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf for 1931. Inspection .—The Residency Surgeon visited Bahrain and Muscat in February. Epidemic .—There were no epidemics of quarantinable diseases at the ports on the Arab ' coast during this year. An epidemic of Cholera which reached considerable dimensions with a heavy mortality rate, occurred at Basrah and in Iraq and certain parts of Khuzistan in Persia. Although Kuwait is only 80 miles by road from Basrah, by the rigid enforcement of quarantine and inspection of all travellers no cases occurred at Kuwait. Buildings .—These are in the same condition as in 1930, with the exception that at Muscat r new building has been erected for Isolation and the pre-existing sheds have been repaired. Personnel .^—Captain D. L. Mackay was in-chargc at Muscat. First Class Assistant Surgeon R. Holmes, K.I.H., was in-charge at Bahrain. First Class Assistant Surgeon A. L. Green way was in-charge at Kuwait. Notification of Diseases .—Weekly health reports were received from the Port Health autho rities of Bombay, Karachi and Basrah. In the case of the occurrence of quarantinable diseases in epidemic form at those ports, reports are received by telegram in the first instance and weekly progress reports thereafter as long as the disease persists. Weekly epidemiological telegrams are also received, by courtesy of the Manager, Imperial and International Communication, limited, Karachi, from the League of Nations Far-Eastern Bureau, Singapore.18 CHAPTER II. Note on events in the Southern Area during the year 1931. Mishun and Gach Qaragidi. —As mentioned in our report of January last, it was decided at the end of 1930 temporarily to suspend operations in this area, and evacuation was accordingly carried out. There is now only one European in the area who is stationed at Ganoweh, whilst at Mishun and Gach Qaraguli guards are maintained. There has been no drilling of any description, but the 110 miles of road from Ganoweh to Gach Qaraguli, v-ia Mishim. is still kept open and in fair condition. Three wells at Gach Qaraguli are still showing pressure, which is taken once weekly. No outstanding events of any importance have occurred and conditions have remained quiet throughout the year. Kuh-i-Mund. —At the beginning of the year the road from the sea-shore to the location, about 10 miles through very difficult country, had been completed, also a jetty constructed and all necessary machinery, pipe-line, pumps, etc., brought in and installed. The accommodation required for European and native staff had also been built, and the construction of the aerodrome was completed in April. Actual drilling on the test well commenced on January loth by the rotary method and was continued until a depth of 1.397 ft. was reached in July. At this juncture it was found necessary to change over to cable tools, owing to the formation taking so much of the drilling mud that it was inpossible to keep circulation for any length of time and as only limited quantities of water were available. Drilling by this method commenced on 27th August and was continued to a depth of 2,675 ft., when 10 in. casing was rim in and cemented at 2.646 ft. At the end of the year drilling with cable tools was still progressing satisfactorily. There are at present 9 Europeans in the area and approximately 200 native staff. No local trouble of any description has been reported throughout the year.20 From the Khamseh tribes little of importance was heard. The Qawam did not visit Fars at all during 1931 but, from the fact that some of the more influential of his former lieutenants were sent for at the end of the year, it is surmised that he is involved in certain of the accusations and counter claims voiced in the capital about past troubles here. 5. Security was certainly better and various brigands were brought to boob notably one Mehdi Surkhi, who had for long given trouble in the Fassa district and other parts ; he was hanged in Shiraz in May. Another band was broken up at Mazijun near Lar in Marcln Only one serious robbery was reported on the mam Bushire road and this occurred in July when a car was held up near Khush-Ali and all the passengers, including an official of the Financial Department, were robbed and stripped. Few robberies were heard of in the latter part of the year either in Shiraz or on the main roads, where Amnieh posts are still numerous ; on the 35 miles of main road between Shiraz and Persipolis for example there are five posts. On the less frequented roads complete safety cannot be relied on for some time to come. 6. Municipal and social services in Shiraz progressed. The electric lighting of the streets was started at the beginning of the year and the British engines worked well; probably no other town in the country has such an efficient electric supply. The new wide main streets were well kept and work on others was commenced^ The completed roads are often lined with empty shops and some of the wounds caused by demolitions for these roads were still gaping but the work was planned with care and none of the interesting old buildings were damaged. None of them on the other hand were repaired and the only work of restoration in the neighbourhood— that at Persipolis—has been undertaken by Germans with American money and does not appear to have aroused much interest among the Persians. An Italian subject works as engineer of the Municipality. There were no serious epidemics. Apart from the Church Missionary Society’s hospital, which is to be replaced by a larger building now under construction, there is no proper civil hospital, the military having acquired the two buildings given by Persians in the past for use as hospitals. A new and comparatively enlightened Director of Public Health was appointed in the summer. Education remained in charge of Mirza Abul Qasim Khan Fuzuyat and the Persian schools are using less antiquated methods even if their teaching is still super ficial. The Church Missionary Society’s school for girls was well attended by the children of leading Persians but considerable interference from unintelligent ins pectors had to be borne. English is widely spoken in Shiraz owing to commercial connection with the Brit sh Empire ; even at the National Bank here English is, after Persian, the most used language. Two clean looking hotels were opened and also a fine new cinema. The back wardness, though perhaps not the lack of sence, of Shiraz is somewhat shown by the fact that men and women are not yet allowed to attend the cinemas at the same time ; in other places in Persia the sexes are no longer separated in this way. 7. Outside the main towns the only representatives of a beneficient government who come into close touch with the people are the tax collectors and the military. The conditions of life in the villages have hardly changed for the better. The improvements to the main roads only affect them in that their animals are often, in more senses than one, driven off the main routes by motor transport. The road to Bushire was worked on and considerable widening was completed on a number of parts of the narrow passes. Work was continued to make the road from Kazerun to Khuzistan practicable for motors. In connection with communications outside the towns mention must be made of the departure in March of the officials of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, whose predecessors did much to make movement in the province possible in former days. As the lines and other equipment of the Department were handed over to the Persian authorities in good order, deterioration was not really marked by the end of the year.&amp;. If the old menace of internal insecurity has been largely overcome and if some conditions of life in the towns have been improved, the province is now in the throes of a severe struggle in its economic situation. The province of Ears has for many years much depended on the opium trade, from which all classes derived profit. Owing to legislation, rather than to other conditions, such as world markets, the price of this drug has fallen greatly and a very large part of the year’s crop remained unsold, even at its cheap price, in the government monopoly stores ; it is likely to stay there for a long while. The rain fall during the winter of 1930-31 was small but this shortage will, according to local opinion, affect the crops of 1932 more than those of the period under review, which actually were up to average. There was very little outside demand for grain so bread remained cheap. Very extreme poverty was however widespread and the tribes people and villagers no longer came to Shiraz with the good money to spend on which the town must largely exist. Tea and sugar became so expensive that many had to do without their favourite drink and there was not enough money to buy the dearer materials to replace pitiful rags. Merchants struggled to find a way to work in with the complicated regulations which had done much to paralyse local trade before the severity of the world crisis was felt. Of the money circulating in the form of paper at a month or two’s date much had very little real money behind it. For the redress of wrongs the townspeople and villagers could not rely on the Courts, of which the reputation was not good, and depression and pessimism were general. They have nevertheless extreme patience and surprising vitality and have had to carry on before under circumstances quite as bad. MC392FD a22 CHAPTEE IV. Administration Eeport of the Consular District of Bandar Abbas and Lingah for the year 1931. Personnel. Bandar Abbas.—Mx. G. A. Kichardson, O.B.E., held the post of His Majesty’s Vice-Consul with the personal rank of Consul, throughout the year. He also held additional charge as Consul, Kerman from, the end of April. Medical 0$cer.—Jamadar Abdur Eahim, the Sub-Assistant Surgeon remained in Medical charge of the Consulate throughout the year. Foreign Representatives* j Bandar Abbas. —Nil. Lingah. —Khan Sahib Ahmed bin Yusuf Khaja, who claimed to be the Agent of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat although not officially recognised by the local | authorities, died in March. r &lt; The insignia of the title of Khan Sahib of which he had been dispossessed last &lt; year by the local authorities was restored on representations being made to the Persian Government at Tehran and delivered to the deceased’s next-of-kin. Local Government. Bandar Abbas. —Agha Mirza Zainal Abedin Khan Ibrat (Motiman-el-Vazereh) continued to hold the post of Governor throughout the year. - ' During his absence of leave from the 21st June till the 24th October, Agha Syed Ali Khan Sadr, the Direc- &lt; tor of Posts and Telegraphs officiated for him. Sartip Hyder Quli Khan Peysan in charge of the Commission of Inspection sent out from Tehran, arrived mu Lingah on the 14th June to inspect the local depart ments. During their short stay of twenty-four hours, the Inspectors visited the Customs, Maliyeh and Post and Telegraph Departments and left for Tehran via Kerman immediately afterwards. _ _ . Minab. —Mirza Ali Khan Azad was Deputy Governor till the end of November, when he was dismissed, the Bais-i-Nazmieh deputising for the Governor of Bandar Abbas, pending the appointment of his successor. Aghai Shikohi, the Deputy Governor of Kishim Island has been nominated but had not taken up his post at i the end of the year. i Lingah. —Agha Mahomed Ali (Sadid-es-Sultaneh) the Deputy Governor, was diS’; missed in October and succeeded by Mirza Azim-es-Sultaneh (Mustaufi). Although well versed in Gulf affairs, Sadid was inclined to neglect his duties and was normally in a state of alcoholic semi-intoxication. Finance Department. Bandar Abbas. —Mirza Mustafa Khan Bartar, the Amin-i-Malieh, was obliged to quit his post during the year, owing to ill-health. He was an inveterate opium addict. Mirza Mahomed Mansoori arrived from Lingah on the 20th September and assumed charge from the accountant who had officiated in the meantime. Minab. Mirzalutiillah Khan Mohtadi remained in charge of the Eevenue Department throughout the year. Lingah. Mirza Mohammed Khan Monsoori, the Amin-i-Malieh on his transfer to Bandar Abbas at the end of October was succeeded by a certain Agha Hafeezi. His Posts and Telegraphs. Bandar Abbas. —Syed Ali Khan Sadr was Director throughout the year administration was efficient and he was popular with the merchants. The special bags for His Majesty s Consulate referred to in the previous report were discontinued and mails intended for the Consulate were delivered through the local post office m the ordinary way. There was, however, no occasion to complain against the new system as the postal authorities were always obliging and helpful.The bi-weekly postal motor service between Bandar Abbas and Kerman and other places in the interior functioned satisfactorily although in the first few months of the year, this was interrupted temporarily owing to the attacks by Farsi highway men on the lorries conveying mails especially on the former mentioned route. As the result of representations made by the Director and referred to in the Report for last year, another signaller with a knowledge of English and conversant with Latin characters was appointed to assist him. There have been no complaints since of coded telegrams being received in a mutilated form. Communication by telephone with Minab established in 1929 was maintained and serves a useful purpose. Lingah. —The postal service appears to have worked satisfactorily under Mirza Ali Akbar Khan Farah, the Post Master, although it is said that he is given to intrigue and mixes himself too much in local affairs. Municipality, Bandar Abbas. —Some interest was evinced by the Governor in devising means to balance the Municipality budget. A toll ranging from 2 to 5 shahis was levied on each bottle of liquor sold’in the bazaar in order to provide funds for the improvement o,f the wretched condition of this town. The operations on the test wells dug at the neighbouring village of Band Konarum with the object of bringing water into the town of Bandar Abbas were .suspended in February and were not resumed during the remainder of the year. Red Lion and Sun Society. Bandar Abbas. —As mentioned in last year’s report, this Society may now be ^considered to have died a natural death. Education. Bandar Sheikh Abdul Ali Asfoori took over charge of the ’Maur Tif Department in June but was relieved in December by Mirza Noor Ali Khan Basti. Lingah. —The two schools, one national and the other a Government institution are progressing under the superintendence of Agha Salihi. Police Department. Bandar Abbas. —Naib Sayed Assaudullah Khan Faqri was in charge throughout the year. During his absence on short leave, Moin Naib Tahmasibi officiated for him. Though some petty thefts were reported in Bandar Abbas town and in the Island of Kishim, they were less frequent than in previous years and the work of the Police was fairly efficient on the whole. Lingah, Henjam, Minab and Kishim Island. — A small body of Police was maintained at these places. Passport Department. Bandar Abbas. —The police authorities continued to hold charge of this Depart ment. No difficulties were experienced by foreign subjects at Jask and other ports where there are no passport offices, in obtaining exit visas. British Political Officers and the Commanders and Officers of the mail steamers calling here had no difficulty in obtaining permission to disembark during the stay of their vessels in the harbour. The Police authorities in accordance with the Law governing the entry into, sojourn in and passage through Persia of foreigners, recently enacted by the Persian Mejliss, notified foreign subjects in the district to get themselves registered at the various Police Offices. Amnieh. (Gendarmerie.) Bandar Abbas. —The post here consisted of 11 men under a non-commissioned officer. Sartip Azizullah Khan Zarghami, the Chief of the Amnieh in Persia arrived from Tehran in February, visiting the intermediate small ports en route to Bandar Abbas. Eighty-seven recruits enlisted here for the Amnieh force at Bushire were des patched in June,24 The posts on the Kerman-Bandar Abbas motor road were re-inforced after Sartip Peysan was wounded by Farsi robbers in the course of their attack on the Jorry conveying the mails in which the General was his party as passengers. Trn/lnnnn] T)p 'nrt/i'f'iWP'Vlt. Bandar The Sulhieh Court remained closed till October when on the return of the Governor off leave, it was re-opened under his own presidency. Linqah and Minab. —No courts have as yet been established at these places and litigants are obliged to refer their cases to the Governor for arbitration—a practice which is considered as being most unsatisfactory and a hardship to- merchants and traders in general. Customs. Bandar Abbas.—Mirza, Riza Quli Khan Ashraf returned off inspection in the first week of January and resumed charge from Monsieur Wolters much to the relief of the local merchants who had ample reason to complain against the arbitrary methods employed by the latter. He remained in office till about the end of the year when he was relieved by Mirz a Abu Talib Khan Abasalti. Mirza Reza Quli Khan was very hard working and popular with the mercantile community. A marked improvement was observed in the Customs House during his regime. No important seizures of contraband merchandise were made during the year. The year was noteworthy for the passage of numerous regulations by the Persian Parliament which restricted, if not paralized the foreign import trade. Customs duties were high, if not exorbitant and the surtax of 20 per cent, introduced in April 30 was increased to 80 per cent, in February. Lingah. —Monsieur Nissan Haim was in charge of the Customs throughout the year. He is an affable official and anxious to afford reasonable facilities. Persian Troops. Bandar A66as.—Sultan Allahyar Khan commanded the troops in the Southern Gulf Ports till August when he was relieved by Yawar Safar Ali Khan Nusrat. Sarhang Abbas Khan Alburz, the General Officer Commanding the Brigade at Kerman paid a visit of inspection, coming via Bushire. He passed through again in December, en route to the Biyaban district to supervise the operations in connection with the disarmament of the tribesmen. No military operations of any importance were undertaken during the year with the exception of an attempt in March to disarm the Bashakardi tribesmen and again in December when 700 men were drawn from the Kerman area for the purpose and were still engaged in the Bashakardi country at the end of the year. The discipline of the troops was as satisfactory as in the preceding year. Sartip Mohamed Khan Shahbakhti who accompanied His Majesty Reza Shah Pahlevi to Kerman, arrived in January to inspect the garrison. Sartip Nasir-ud-Daula Khan inspected the station in March. The Conscription law was brought into forcehn this district in October. A committee presided over by the Governor with the heads of local departments and five merchants sitting as members was formed to examine persons pronounced fit for military service by the Census department. Sarhang Farajullah Khan Mushar, the Officer-in-charge of Conscription attached to the Kerman Brigade arrived to watch the proceedings of the Committee. Condition of the country. Bandar Abbas town. —This was fairly free from crime during the year. Biyaban. —Except for a dispute between the followers of Mir Barakat Khan and the Taherzai tribes which started m 1930, the country was conparatively peaceful. Condition of the Roads. The routes leading to Kerman via the Tang-i-Zagh and Tang-i-Zindan remained practically safe throughout the year. A few attacks on lorries and caravans byisolated gangs of lobbers between the Tang-i-Zagh and Sirjan were reported early in the year. In one of these, Sartip Hyder Quh Ivhan Peysan whilst travelling in a motor lorry with his fellow Inspectors was badly wounded. Farsi highwaymen were active on the route to Lar in January and commercial traffic had to be suspended for a short time. Merchandise worth 50,00 krans was reported to have been looted on one occasion. Bandar Abbas-Lar Motor Road .—Work on this road was commenced in October from the Lar end and it is expected that it will shortly be connected with Bandar Abbas via Bastaq and Lingah. Mohammerah-Charbar Coastal Motor Road .—The project for the construction of this road has for some time past been shelved, probably for the want of funds. Slave Traffic. Bandar No manumission certificates were issued during the year. The case of a slave from Persian Baluchistan who with his two sons sought asylum in the Consulate was referred to the Persian authorities. Another slave from the Arab Coast who came to the Indo-European Telegraph Station for manumission was sent to Muscat for disposal by the Political Agent and H. M. Consul. Aviation. Bandar Abbas .—Three aeroplanes, two British and one French landed on the aerodrome during the year. Both the former were Gipsy Moths and were piloted by Flying Officer Grierson of the Royal Flying Corps and Mr. James A. Mollison respectively. The former arrived from India on his way to England in June. Mr. Mollison passed through in August on his solo flight from Australia to England when he created a record. German.—A. German seaplane piloted by Captain Betram on his Berlin-China flight alighted in the roadstead in September to re-fuel. Lingah .—aerodrome was used throughout the year by Liners of the Imperial Airways Limited for re-fuelling on their Eastward and Westward Flights in connec tion with their weekly mail and passenger services. The Dutch and French Companies aeroplanes also called here. Visits of His Majesty’s Ships. Bandar Abbas .—None of His Majesty’s Ships visited the Port during the year. Lingah .—No Naval Ships called here also. Rasfdw.—The Naval guard was removed from the Settlement in 1930 but His Majesty’s Ships pay occasional visits to the port. French. —The armed Yacht “ Diana ” during her cruise in the Persian Gulf anchored off Henjam on the 4th January and sailed for Muscat the following day. Visits of H. M.’s Representatives. ^ The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel H. V. Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf with his Under Secretary Captain R. G. E. W. Alban and accompanied by Air Vice-Marshal and Mrs. Ludlow Hewitt and Mr. H. L. Baggallay, Second Secretary of H. B. M. Legation at Tehran visited Bandar Abbas on the 18th December. . Mx* G. A. Richardson, O.B.E., His Majesty’s Consul visited Lingah and Henjam on inspection between the 12th and 18th March and again between the 26th March and the 2nd April calling at British Basidu on the 30th March. On the 22nd April, he left for Kerman to assume charge of the Consulate there in addition to his own duties. On the 6th December he arrived at Bandar Abbas on tour and visited Henjam between the 10th and 17th December. British Interests. Consulate Escort. The strength of this remained the same as in the previous year and consisted of two pensioned Indian sowars and two mounted Persian ghulams. Indo-European Telegraph Department .—The Department having been taken over by the Imperial and International Communications, Limited, closed down its office at Bandar Abbas. The instruments, etc., were handed over to the Persian MC392FDTelegraph Office and the cable connecting Bandar Abbas with Henjam via Kishim Island was disconnected. Lingah. —The I. E. T. D. Wireless Station was closed down on the 28th February. Henjam. —The Wireless and Cable Station on this Island is now being maintain ed and operated by the Imperial and International Communications, Limited. Imperial Bank of Persia. —Mr. E. S. Matheson took over charge of the Branch of this Bank from Mr. I. Macrae on the 18th April. Owing to the severe exchange control, banking transactions were drastically curtailed. A gradual improvement took place during the latter part of the year when the Rupee and Sterling exchange were freed from restrictions and there was a strong demand for rupee exchange in the bazaar even at the high rate of 680 krans per Rs. 100. However, the banks stopped selling after a short time when the value of the pound fell to 60 krans. The National Bank of Persia which was opened here in 1930 under the Mana gership of Monsieur Wurst and transferred to M. Karl Hoefer on his departure in October has become a serious competitor and has increased the difficulties of the Imperial Bank. All coin of a very low standard except those hole-ringed and broken remained as legal tender throughout the year. Selling quotations of the Banks on London and Bombay were as follows :— London Highest .. .. .. .. krans 90 to £1. As mentioned above the selling rates were nominal except when the foreion exchange was freed by the Persian Government for a short while. Imperial War Graves Commmwm.—Captain G. Peek, O.B.E., the Area Officer, Basia, of the Commission visited Bandar Abbas on two occasions during the year and concentrated to the Naibund Cemetery seven war-graves from the Zabul district two from Kerman and one each from Henjam and Jask. Lowest Average krans 60 to £1. krans 75 to £L Bombay. Highest krans 680 per Rs. 100. krans 444 per Rs. 100. krans 562 per Rs. 100. Lowest Average Red Oxide of Iron. Trade and Commerce. “8 W ‘ th the exception of two closed down in sugar monopoly was reserved for themselvesNo trade statistics are available for the year but during the Persian Year 1309 (1930-31), it would appear that Russian imports amounted to six and a haM million krans ; their share in the piece-goods trade being krans 2,735,000 out of a total of krans 8,153,000 and in the sugar trade krans 3,010,000 out of a total import of 5,320,000. The greater part of the general import for the year, however, came from the United Kingdom and India. A certain feature has been the persistence of a few German firms to continue exports in spite of .the extraordinary difficulties in obtaining exchange. In spite of granting credits though only to a very limited extent and obtaining re-imburst mtnt by small instalments, the Russians cannot be said to be popular. Their detei mi nation to sell, tends to make them cut prices e\en against merchants in the same market to whom they may- have sold goods. The Russians, never theless have virtually secured a monopoly in the local markets in the lines of goods in which they specialise, and their success lies mostly in their system of barter. The Trade Monopoly Law, however, detrimental to trade in general, promises to be advantageous to the Russians for the aforesaid reasons. Shipping and Navigation. Bandar Abbas. —140 steam ships aggregating 298,642 tons entered and cleared the port during the year and comprised 126 British, 5 German and 9 Russian vessels. Seventeen vessels brought merchandise from the United Kingdom, of which 12 belonged to Messrs. Frank C. Strick and Co., Limited, and 5 to the Ellerman Bucknall Steamship Company. The five German steamers were of the Hansa Line of Bremen and embarked their cargoes at Hamburg or Antwerp. The nine Russian vessels belonged to the Soviet Mercantile Fleet and conveyed goods from Odessa. Lingah. —75 ships, all British with a total of 141,326 tons entered and cleared the port. No shipping casualties were reported during the year. Political. The year under review may be said to be a quiet one in this respect. The anniversary of the Coronation of His Imperial Majesty Reza Shah Pahlevi which had previously been celebrated on the 4th Farvardin (April 23rd), was not observed this year, as it had been decided by the Central authorities to celebrate, this day on the Shah’s birthday, the 24th Island (15th March). Quarantine and Sanitation. Dr. Ali Khan Hamedi, the Health and Quarantine Medical Officer, who was relieved by Dr. Sarfaraz temporarily, returned to Bandar Abbas in April and remained in charge till the end of the year. No epidemics were reported to have occurred in the district during the period under review. In August, owing to the outbreak of cholera at Basra and Mohammerah, vessels arriving from those ports were placed in quarantine, unless they had com pleted five days during the voyage. All restrictions were removed in December. Bandar Abbas town charitable Sub-Assistant Surgeon Jamedar Abdur Rahim, I. M. D., remained in charge during the year. The funds for the maintenance of this institution have been running low during the past few jnars and it was found necessary to raise further subscriptions to meet its growing expenditure. The closing of the Dispensary, in spite of the benefit being derived by the townspeople in general, will be inevitable in the near future, especially as it is intended to withdraw the medical Officer from the Consulate and to abolish that post.28 The attendance of out-patients at the Dispensary was as follows as compared with the two preceding years :— 1931 .. .. .. .. .. 7,002. 1930 .. .. .. .. .. 7,432. 1929 .. .. .. .. 6,664. Economic Conditions. Abundant rains fell during the year and good crops were yielded which were spared the ravages of locusts which caused considerable damage in the past two years. G. A. RICHARDSON, His Majesty's Consul and Assistant to the Resident, Bandar Abbas.CHAPTER V, Administration Report of His Majesty’s Consulate, Kerman, for the year 1931. A.— British Interests, 1. His Majesty’s Lieutenant-Colonel E. W. C. Noel, C.I.E., D.S.O., held charge of the Consulate till the 25th April when he was transferred to India. Mr. G. A. Richardson, O.B.E., His Majesty’s Consul and Assistant Resident, Bandar Abbas, held additional charge of the Kerman Consulate, with headquarters at Kerman, from the 26th April till the end of the year. Khan Bahadur Abdul Alim, L. K., held the post of Indian Attache to His Majesty’s Consul, throughout the year. 2. Consubte Work. — {a) 54 British subjects were registered during the year. (6) During the month of April it was discovered for the first time that the Consulate was being constantly watched by 2 men of the C. I. D., especially deputed by the local police for the purpose. At the official reception held at the Consulate on His Majesty the King’s Birthday in June the only local officials who attended were the Governor-General, the Officer Commanding, and the Chiefs of Police and Municipality. Several messages were, however, received from a number of Persian officials and notables expressing regret at being precluded from continuing their friendly relations with the Consulate. In July intercourse between Persian officials and the British Consulate had practically ceased. In the month of August, at the suggestion of the Governor-General, the manage ment of the Zirisf Qanat, which had been under this Consulate since the summer of 1929 and by which arrangement, thanks to the zealous endeavours of Lieutenant-Colonel Noel, the water supply had increased nearly four-fold, was transferred by the land-owners to a Persian agent. During the latter part of the year the campaign of espionage on the Consulate increased in vigour. Most people visiting the Consulate, or the Indian Attache’s house, on business, were stopped and interrogated by the secret police on the watch. 3. Political Fines. —It will be remembered that Brigadier-General Sir Percy Sykes, on re-establishing the Kerman Consulate in 1916, fined a number of Ker- manis for having had dealings with German agents. Amongst the former were the two leading Parsi traders, Surushiyan and Kayanian, who were fined heavily for buying from M. Bruggmann a quantity of yarn, etc., the property of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, Limited, a British firm. In the month of July 1931 these two local traders forwarded notices through the Adlieh Courts to Sir Percy Sykes, and the Petag Company trading in the North of Persia, as it was on behalf of this Company, whom he represented at the time, that M. Bruggmann had sold the yarn to the above traders. The notice on Sir Percy Sykes was to be served through the Persian Legation in London and the amount of damages claimed was. said to be more than 10 times the actual fines paid. It may be mentioned that, as the result of the transaction referred to above, th&amp; two Parsi claimant firms were placed on the Black List. 4. Indo-European Telegraph Department. —The Persian Government took over the telegraph offices and lines in the Kerman Province from the Indo- European Telegraph Department on the 28th February, and Mr. A. Robertson, the officiating Superintendent of the Department in Kerman, and other members of the European staff left for England in batches during the next month. 5. The Imperial Bank of Persia and Trade in General.—Mx. C. A. Gardner continued as Manager till the beginning of June when he was recalled to Tehran. Mr. Sheahan acted till the beginning of August, as Manager, and was then relieved MC392FD K30 by Mr. W. Y. Grow, who continued to hold the post of Manager till the end of the year. Mr. Y. R. Jones, the Accountant, was relieved by Mr. J. F. Luttrell on the 26tli December. The year opened with the Control Exchange Rates standing at Krans 59J per £ Sterling. On the 9th February the Sterling rate rose to Krans 90 and remained steady until the 10th November when a drop to Krans 70*45 Vvas announced. By gradual drops the rate on the 30th December fell to Krans 63|. A consider able amount of exchange has, it is understood, been sold in the open market during the year at approximately 50 per cent, above Control Rates, v/hich was beneficial to the exporters of carpets. The fact of business in general having fallen off considerably is confirmed by the shortness of ready cash in the bazars. The general tone of the market has been one of depression and many land-owners, who are also business men in the bazaars, are turning their attention to cultivation in an endeavour to balance the deficiency in their incomes caused by the slackness of trade and the diminished turn-over in business. The average demand Rupee buying and selling rates (Control) for the year were as under :— Buying .. .. .. .. .. 529 • 28 Selling .. .. .. .. .. 540*174 Owing to the exchange difficulties all Hindu (British Indian) shops in Kerman closed down their business during the latter part of the year. 6. Church Missionary Society. —(a) General .—During the year the C. M. S- revised the arrangement whereby the Clergyman, in addition to his clerical duties, also held the post of Principal of the Boys’ School. The Revd. H. E. J. Biggs took over the duties of Chaplain on arrival from England in the beginning of November from the Rev. R. Iliff, who proceeded on leave. Mr. F. T. B. Snow, M.A. (Cantab.), then took over charge of the School. (h) Boys' School .—During the year boys were again prepared for the Persian Government Primary School Certificate, and also for the English Middle School Certificate awarded by the C. M. S. Educational Board. In both these examina tions, taken in the Vlth and VUIth Classes respectively, a high percentage of certificates was obtained. Games and athletic sports still figure largely in the life of the School and the new building which provides sufficient grounds for this purpose was completed during the year. On the whole the School has progressed satisfactorily and, thanks to the excellent work done by the Rev. R. Iliff, definite advancement has been observed in the efficiency and morale of the pupils. Girls’ School—The eagerness of the people of the town to make use of this School has increased and many applications for admittance had to be refused owing to the shortness of staff and inadequate accommodation. The School has at present 209 pupils and greater attention is being devoted to games than for merly. In June eight girls entered for the Persian Government Primary Certi ficate (Vlth Class) and all were successful, while another passed the Vlth Class examination for the C. M. S. Schools. Owing to a change in the curriculum in 1930 one class was kept back a year and automatically there was no class in 1931 to take the Middle School English Certificate as in previous years. The Guides Company also provides exercise, character training and an outlet for the energies of the older girls. Miss J. F. \\ oodroffe is in charge of the School, and her work is universally commended. {c) Medical—D t. G. E Dodson remained in charge of the Medical Mission throughout the year, assisted by Dr. (Miss) Pigott as medical officer of the femal hospital. Miss Stratton continued to attend to the Welfare WorkThe excellent services rendered to the local community by the Medical Mission can be judged by the following statistics :— Number of beds {Medical Work). Number of in-patients Number of out-patients (new) Repeat visits Visits to patients’ own houses Major operations 110 (Men 70, Women 40). 805 5,968 16,680 2,125 529 Note .—Besides 1,044 patients were seen on itinerations.

Number of confinements .. .. .. 76 Patients attending welfare centre .. .. .. 347 Repeat visits .. .. .. .. .. 1,125 Visits paid to patients’ own houses .. .. 1,614 Number of cases referred to medical mission .. 126 7. War Graves. —Captain G. Peek, O.B.E., of the Imperial War Graves Commission, arrived from Ispahan in the end of April, and, after visiting Zahidan (Duzdap) and Sistan, left for Bandar Abbas in the middle of May carrying with him the War Graves removed from Sistan, Zahidan, Dehaneh-i-Baghi and Kerman. 8. Carpet Trade and the Spinning Mill Project. — {a) Carpet Trade. —The export of carpets and tribal rugs expressed in thousands of Krans during 1931, and the three preceding years was as follows :— 1928. 1929. 1930. 1931. Kerman carpets and rugs 7,465 7,746 13,140 12,079 Tribals 2,243 1,295 913 888 Kerman has suffered to the full as the result of the World crisis. This is only natural considering that her one and only industry is Carpets, a luxury in which the majority of people have been obliged to cease to indulge. The loss was accen tuated by the depreciation in the price of silver with a corresponding decrease in capital, in the shape of carpets, of which every firm necessarily holds a large floating stock. During the year many firms suspended business and in the last quarter Messrs, the Standard Carpet Co., Ltd., a British concern, went into liquidation. But the export figures for the year show only a comparatively small decrease as compared with those of the preceding year, which may be ex plained by the fact of the Persian Government regulations stipulating that imports could only be allowed against exports to an equal extent. A number of traders in consequence exported large stocks of carpets to the United States, Europe and India. In this connection it may be mentioned that, as far as the carpet export trade in Kerman is concerned, the prices declared are always 10 to 30 per cent, in excess of the original value, in order to obtain import permits for larger amounts than actually sent out of the country. The Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, Ltd., at present the only British firm dealing in carpets in Kerman, which handles about 25 per cent, of this trade, cut down its commitments to a great extent during the latter part of the year. In September the Afghan Government approached the Persian Government for the loan of a number of carpet weaving experts. (6) Spinning Mill Project. —As the cotton yarn used in weaving carpets in Persia has to be imported either from Japan or India, Lieutenant-Colonel Noel in 1930 considered the question of converting the local cotton into yarn suitable for the purpose, and discussed with merchants and land-owners the possibility of embarking on the enterprise of importing a spinning mill plant. A sample of local cotton was sent to Bombay for spinning and proved satisfactory for conversion32 into No. 20S. yarn which is mostly used. In September 1930 Colonel Noel visited Tehran to interview the Minister of Economies, who promised the full support of the Government, and in November of the same year the former took the oppor tunity to bring the proposal to the notice of H. I. M. the Shah who was pleased to commend it and even held out hopes of investing his own money in the enterprise. As it was intended to import British machinery, estimates and catalogues had been obtained, but Colonel Noel was suddenly transferred to India in the month of April 1931. Shortly afterwards His Excellency Mirza Reza Khan, Afshar, the newly appointed Governor-General of this Province, who appeared to be armed with instructions from Tehran to follow up this scheme, but without the intervention of this Consulate, convened various meetings at the Government House and it was finally decided to form a Company with a capital of Tumans 500,000, one-third of which was to be collected immediately. Full details of this project wdll appear in the Trade Report for 1931-32, but it may be added that at the time of writing three representatives of the Board of Directors of the Spinning Mill Company, Kerman, had proceeded to Tehran to decide whether the contract for the necessary machinery be placed in England or Germany. 9. Communications and Security. — (a) Communications. —Kerman still remains the centre for road administration in South-East Persia, which includes Lingah, Yezd and Birjand, and Prince A’izaz-us-Saltaneh has held charge of this adminis tration throughout the year. The only new road started in the Province was the motor alignment between Khabis and Kerman via the Sirch Pass, which the Road Authorities expect to complete by the middle of 1932. A number of land-owners in Rawar on the Kerman-Meshed caravan route have made the Kerman-Rawar section of this road fit fox motor traffic, in the expectation of receiving support from the Persian Government, The Road Authorities have paid special attention during the year to the Roads in Persian Baluchistan. The motor road from Bandar Abbas via Sirjan, the principal trade route, remained in good condition throughout the year. Owing to the removal of the railhead from Zahidan (Duzdab) to Nok Kundi, the import trade of Kerman via Zahidan received a setback and now the former route is being used by exporters to India to avoid the Indian Customs. {b) Security of Trade Ao^es.—Robbers from Ears and Bar still continue their activities on the Bandar Abbas-Kerman motor road but to a less extent. On the 17th of June a number of Farsi robbers attacked, near Gudar-i-Charm on the above road, a lorry in which Sartip Haidar Quli Khan and four other Ins pectors for various Government departments were travelling from Bandar Abbas to Kerman. The Sartip was wounded in the chest and the party stripped of their belongings. During the year one post w T as robbed and two drivers of motor lorries and one passenger were killed. Law and order were on the whole well maintained on the other trade routes in the Province. (c) Posts. Post offices were opened at Khabis and Rudbar during the year under review. &amp; ^ The mails on the section Kerman-Bandar Abbas have been more regular than m the preceding year. Opportunity may be taken to mention the very unsatisfactory delivery arrangements prevailing m the Kerman Post Office as, owing to Friday and other holidays intervening, the mails are often delivered after a delay of 24 to 48 hours alter their actual arrival. J (d) W ireless.—The wireless station, though supposed to be in working order Spears'™ 1 - ‘ •»-(e) Aviation. —Three Junkers’ aeroplanes conveying passengers arrived during the year. No steps have been taken to improve the aerodrome situated to the north west of the town. B .—Local Government and Politics. 10. Condition of the Country. —Law and order were well maintained in the Province throughout the year. The Military, Amnieh and Police departments performed their duties more efficiently than in previous years and a number of highway robbers were captured and dealt with. Police patrols in the town were more regular and the number of burglaries reported was comparatively small. Ali Jan, a notorious deserter and outlaw, who had been committing occasional robberies in the neighbourhood of Jiruft since 1929, at last met his fate in the month of August at the hands of a small party of soldiers from Jiruft. In spite of the discontent arising from the numerous export and import diffi culties, the Shah’s popularity for the efficient administration of the country and the state of security prevailing has increased. 11. Local Officials and Departments. — Governor-General. —His Highness Seyyid Mohammed, Tadayyun, who was an amiable person to deal with, was recalled to Tehran in March, and Dadras, the Assistant Governor-General officiated till the middle of May. His Excellency Mirza Eeza Khan, Afshar, the present incumbent, has pleasant manners and is very sociable. He speaks English fluently with an American accent, having been educated in the United States. He is extremely nationalistic and somewhat inclined to be anti-foreign. His Excellency is known to be hasty and hot-tempered and, as President of the Conscription Committee, lost his temper on one or two occasions and slapped recruits trying to obtain exemption. He is very anxious to effect some progress in the Province and is working hard to attain this end. Besides the spinning mill project, for the carrying through of which credit is due to his endeavours, he intends to build and establish a charitable hospital on a large scale. Another of his projects is to form a Persian Carpet Company with the object of taking some of this trade from the hands of foreign firms now established in Kerman. His Excellency’s relations with the Consulate have been cordial and both he and his family are inclined to mix in the social life of the European community. Finance and Revenue. —A distinct improvement is noticeable in the adminis tration of the Finance Department, where there is less corruption, particularly owing to a number of officials having been prosecuted during the early part of the year. The re-assessment of the estates not already surveyed during the preceding two years was completed during the year 1931, with the result that the revenue of the Province has increased. Three per cent, of the past ten years’ average income has been fixed as Government revenue and, in many cases, where this figure wor ked out at less than the existing rates, the old scale has been adhered to. The income accruing from opium, although less than in 1929, has risen appre ciably in view of the output having increased by about 250 per centum during the year under review. Owing to the taxed rates having been reduced from Krans 2-35 to Krans 0 • 50 per miscal, smuggling has decreased as the prices of the taxed and contraband article are practically the same. There is now less temptation to risk smuggling and cultivators have brought in most of their opium to the godowns of the Finance Department. Incidentally, it is believed that the number of opium addicts has increased in consequence of the reduction of ‘ banderole ’ rates. National Bank of Persia. —Herr Meyer remained in charge as Manager of the National Bank of Persia throughout the year, assisted by a young Geiman, Mr. Haeussler, During the year this Bank, owing to the greater facilities afforded to local traders, deprived the Imperial Bank of Persia of a number of their clients. MC392FP t34 The Rafsin jan branch of the National Bank is run by a Persian Manager with 3, staff of one clerk only and it is stated that the profits are five times its expenses. No new branches were opened during the year though the question of estab lishing these at Bam and Sirjan had come under consideration in the early part of the year. Herr Meyer has been taking an active part in the spinning mill project as it is proposed that the National Bank should take up shares to the extent of Tomans 75,000. Police .—Yawar Seyyid Sadiq Khan, Sheikh-ul-Islami, remained in charge of the Nazmieh Department throughout the year. The attitude of the Police officials towards British subjects has been satisfactory. The registration of foreign subjects by the Police was started on the 11th October. Justice .—An additional Sulhieh (Small Causes) Court was established during the year, the expenses for its maintenance being met by the local Municipality. Yezd and Bandar Abbas Courts were also placed under Kerman during the period under review. Delay in the conduct of cases in the lower courts seems unavoidable, particularly owing to the large amount of work accumulated in the Sulhieh Courts. As appeals against decisions by this Court are heard by the Biday at (First Instance) and Istinaf (Appeal) Courts, both of wdiich exist in Kerman, full advantage is being taken of their existence by the defaulters merely to gain time. The Hindu (British Indian) traders who wound up their businesses during the year had numerous claims to recover, but on account of the inevitable delay in the Adlieh Courts, had in many cases either to be content with the recovery of a part thereof or to drop them altogether. Another disadvantage obtaining locally is that most of the pleaders being addicated to opium are greedy and exorbitant in their charges. Mirza Reza Khan, Tajaddud, a polished gentleman who comes from a Mullah class of Nejef and has lived in India for a number of years, is the Chief of the Depart ment in Kerman. Posts and Telegraphs. —Farzanigan, the Director of Posts and Telegraphs in Kerman, was transferred to Bushire in May and replaced by Mirza Ahmed Khan, Waziri, who continued in charge till the end of the year. The Telegraph Office does not accept urgent messages for transmission at night. Their delivery arrangements are also far from being satisfactory. Education .—There has been no increase in the number of Schools since the last Administration Report, though some improvement is said to have been effected in the condition of the classes, etc. In spite of the endeavours of Mirza Hassan Khan, Jaudat, the Chief of this Department, there has been no substantial increase in the Budget grant for educational purposes in this Province, which at present stands at Tumans 56,150 per annum. The Chief of the Education and the Church Missionary Authorities continue to maintain cordial relations. Amnieh .—Sarhang Haji Baqir Khan, Karaghuzlu, was in charge of the Amnieh Department till March, when he was replaced by Sarhang Mahmood Khan, Kianpur. There was another change in August and Naib Sarhang Abdullah Khan* Tumaj, was the Chief of the Department at the end of the year. Like his two pre decessors he has had no relations with the Consulate. The discipline of the Amnieh force which is about 1,000 strong has on the whole, been satisfactory. Municipality. —New Municipal taxes were introduced during the year and the annual income of the Baladiyeh Department is now estimated at Tomans 80,000. Nevertheless the roads in the town still remain in their former unsatisfactory condition. The house tax of 3 per cent, on the calculated annual rent, which was to be introduced in March 1931, has not yet been recovered. The metalling of the main artehry road cut through the middle of the tovn in 1929 and called the Khayaban-i-So ahpur was taken in hand at the close of the year. The Municipality now have twhPersian Engineers appointed from' Tehran.

Sheikh Abdul Kassxm Harandi, the Russian Sales Agent in Kerman has im ported machinery for supplying electric light to the town and is at present busy putting up poles and wires under the superintendence of a Russian Engineer. The Municipality have been in negotiation with the proprietor with a view to parti- cipatmg m the scheme. F Agriculture and Locusts.— Ail Armenian employee of the Department of Agri- culture arrived from Tehran in August to establish a farm in Kerman. Besides selecting an old garden, a part of an endowed property, for this purpose, nothing was achieved till the end of the year. ° . Niquit, a foreign expert, employed by the Persian Government, arrived in December and, after visiting the salt mines near Bam, and the forests in Narma- shir, returned to the Capital. The Province was free from the locust pest during the year, a single report being received from certain villages of Narmashir of damage being caused by these insects to the indigo crop. Sejjil-i-Ahwaal. —Prince Murteza Mirza, Qahrmani, remained in charge of the Census Department until the end of the year. . Tiie Department has now established branches throughout the Province, and, in November, a notice was published calling upon those who had not already obtained identification papers to do the needful immediately as the new Law passed by the Medjhss provided for heavy penalties in cases of default. 1 . 2 * Local Politics and Press. 1931 has been uneventful in the political sense. Notwithstanding the Shah’s disparaging remarks at the time of his visit in re- gard to the status of the Province, Kerman still remains an Ayalat and the districts ot Bam-Narmashir and Kafsmjan have not been separated from it. The influence of the Mullahs has continued to wane. During the year 1931 the Ashura (Moharram) processions were much curtailed m the town and the districts by orders of the local authorities. There was no public laceration of the head and at Bam a number of the mourners, who had prepared themselves, for this ceremony, were dispersed by the Military who gallopped their horses amongst them, as the result of which 2 or 3 people were injured. Press. There are nominally four papers being published in Kerman, of which two am more or less regular. Nothing objectionable from the point of view of British interests has ^ appeared in the local Press and in the month of May the editor of ‘ Istiqamat ’ published a long article expressing warm appreciation of the services rendered by Colonel Noel to the Province. 13. Health and General Welfare.—No steps were taken to improve the sanitation of the town and the same unhealthy practices prevalent 24 years ago still exist today. The epidemic of mumps which had broken out at the end of 1930 lasted till the autumn. It was followed in November by a general epidemic of influenza which was still raging at the close of the year. Reports of cholera declared in April last to have occurred at Rafsinjan, 3 days march to the west, were so contradictory as to hardly justify the drastic measures taken by the authorities. The measures taken by the local Health Department included the cutting-off the water supplies of distant non-infected areas and the institution of quarantine on the western side of Kerman though no suspected cases had been reported east of Rafsinjan itself ! Dr. Mehdi Khan, Philosoph, was the Health Officer, Kerman, at the end of the year. 14, Russian Interests. The Soviet Consul-General at Ispahan visited Kerman during February-March. M. Belooshapkin, the Soviet Trade Representative in Kerman, was relieved m July by M. Khalatoff, and M. Matulaitis was in charge of the Soviet Trade Re presentation at the end of the year. During the summer Soviet trade activities m the Province dwindled slightly but revived in the latter part of the year, as the result of the signing of the Commercial Treaty with Persia. Their interests extended in the direction of experimental cultivation of cotton seeds and one of their agents, a certain Seyyid Ismail Agha, Yakili, of Tabriz, was deputed to travel in the districts to instruct the peasants,36 During tlie year, in this Province, the Russians held 20 per cent, of the trade in kerosene and petrol, the balance being handled b 7 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited. 15. Military and Conscription .—Sarhang Abbas Khan, Alburz, commanded the Kerman Brigade throughout the year. The Column consisting of 750 men. which had proceeded to Lar last year returned to its headquarters m July 1931, after the completion of the operations in that district. The Column was then deputed to disarm the tribesmen inhabiting the districts of Gavbandi, Shibkuh and the littoral between Lingah and Dashti-Dashtistan. The principal rebel chiefs were captured and sent to Tehran. In October the Officer Commanding, Kerman Teep, met Sarhang Mohammed Khan, Nakhjawan, the Officer Commanding ,Persian Baluchistan, at Bam, and discussed measures for the proposed expedition against the Bashakirdi tribesmen. 800 soldiers left Kerman in November and in the beginning of the following month joined the forces from Sistan and Zahidan at Rudan, where it is stated that later Mir Barkat of Beyaban surrendered himself to Sarhang Mohammed Khan. The local Military band was abolished in August and the men were transferred to other units. Naib Sarhang Shakir Khan was in charge of the Conscription Department till September and his permanent successor in the person of Sarhang Farajullah Khan, Mushar, arrived in November. The Conscription Committee started its fourth year’s work in October and the public are becoming more or less accustomed to the methods of this Committee which are not as strict as they were in the first two years of their existence. 16. Persian Baluchistan .—The districts of Bam and Narmashir were placed during the year under the Khwash administration for military and conscription purposes. There were no Baluch raids across the Lut during the year under review. In October it was stated that the Persian Government had issued orders for the establishment of a Customs House at Panjgur and sanctioned the expenditure of Tumans 180,000 for the construction of various buildings at the Persian Baluchistan frontier. 17. Rudhar .—There is now a permanent military garrison at Rudbar which has greatly weakened the semi-independent rule of Zargham-us-Saltaneh in this district. The Zargham has however succeeded in getting his rival nephew, Saeed Khan, into trouble and the latter is now under surveillance in Kerman on charges of various robberies committed by him in former years on the Bandar Abbas-Bam road. British Consulate, Kerman ; G. A. RICHARDSON, The 25th February 1932. His Majesty’s Acting Consul, Kerman.CHAPTER VI. Administration Report of the Political Agency, Muscat, for 1931. 1. Personnel. —Lieutenant-Colonel T. C. Fowle, C.B.E., held charge of the Political Agency and Consulate from the 1st January to the 28th May and again from 1st November to the end of the year. 2. Captain R. G. Alban held officiating charge of the Agency and Consulate from the 29th May to the 31st October. 3. The post of Agency Surgeon was held throughout the year by Captain D. L. Mackay, LM.D., and that of Sub-Assistant Surgeon by Mr. G. B. Yemkanmardi. 4. The post of Treasury Officer was held during the year by Mr. S. P. Pereira except for the first 17 days of January when the post was filled by Khan Sahib M. J. Gazdar, M.B.E. 5. Agency Hospital—The attendance of patients during the year was good. The total number treated was 8,180, of which 8,068 were out-patients and H2 in patients. These figures show a decrease by 12 in-patients and 243 out-patients as compared with the figures of the previous year. Patients attend from Matrah as well as from out-lying places. Prevailing Diseases—Malaria with its resulting consequences was the most prevailing disease and accounted for a quarter of the total number of cases treated at the hospital. Its incidence showed a decrease on the previous year and this factor may perhaps be attributed to the absence of rainfall. Skin and eye diseases with diseases of the digestive system come next in frequency. Surgical Operations. —633 operations were performed and deserve no special comment. Poisoning. —No cases were treated suffering from poisons either vegetable or mineral, and no cases or deaths occurred from snake bites. There were no cases requiring despatch to India for Anti-Rabic treatment. Epidemics. —There were no epidemics of infectious disease throughout the year either in Muscat or Matrah and none were reported from places in their close vicinity. One case of small-pox, a passenger on the S. S. “ Barpeta ” was landed on the 11th September and treated in the Quarantine Station. Quarantine restrictions were imposed and two hundred persons submitted to vaccination. Iraq became cholera infected from the middle of the year. All persons leaving this port for Iraq received cioubie cholera inoculations, the cost oi the vaccine was met by the State. 6. Public Health and Sanitary conditions generally remain bad. A scheme for the adoption of anti-malarial measures has been drawn up, and it is hoped that conditions will have improved by the end of the year. A new building was erected at the Quarantine Station for the accommodation of the cases requiring isolation, and general repairs were carried out on the shed for accommodating contacts. 7. Foreign Interests.—The French sloop “ Diana ” arrived at Muscat on 7th January with Contre-Admiral Deville on board. She did not fire the customary salute as she had run out of ammunition. Visits were exchanged between the Political Agent and the Admiral and between the latter and the Council of Ministers. 8. The French Consulate remained closed during the year in charge of a watchman. 9. Monsieur Cassin, the French Vice-Consul at Bushire, paid an unofficial visit to Muscat on the 14th March and left on the 18th March. 10. The Political Agent remained in charge of American interests. 11. Ruling Family. —His Highness the Sultan remained absent at Dehra Dun throughout the year. Towards the end of the year he formally abdicated in favour of his^son Saiyid Said in spite of the combined efforts and arguments of the Hon’ble the Political Resident, the Political Agent, and Saiyid Said. Government have therefore accepted the Sultan’s abdication and approved of Saiyid Said’s succession which will formally take place early in 1932. MC392FD M38 ,oa '' e to t For the last year and a half the burden of administering the State has fallen chiefly on Saiyid Said who has been confronted with not a few difficulties in the overcoming of which he—notwithstanding his youthful age of 22—has shown qualities of patience* tact and firmness. He seems to have a bent for finance and economy with considering the financial difficulties with which the State— in common with all other countries—is confronted, should prove most useful. 12. Saiyid Nadir bin Faisal, His Highness’s brother, continued to take no active part in State affairs throughout the year but has been present on State occasions. 13. Council of Ministers .—The composition of the Council during the year was as follows :— 14. President—Saiyid Said bin Taimur. 15. The other members were :— Finance Minister—Mr. S. E. Hedgcock up the 30th June when he left. The post remained vacant to the end of the year and the duties were carried on by the President with the advice of the Political Agent. During the 6 months that Mr. Hedgcock remained at Muscat he reformed the system of accounts and put the finances of the State on a sounder basis. 16. Mr. B. S. Thomas, O.B.E., whose whereabouts were unkown when the last report was submitted returned to Muscat via Dohah and Bahrein on the 6th March 1931 after having crossed the Buba-al-Khali. He left for the United Kingdom on the 14th March 1931. 17. Minister of Justice.—Shaikh Zubair held this appointment throughout the year. 1%. Finance .—The serious financial situation of the State at the end of 1930 was indicated in paragraph 15 of last year’s Beport. During the course of 1931 economies were effected in all branches of the administration and the surplus on the year’s working came to Rs. 42,835. During the year Its. 40,000 were paid towards the Government of India loan, and the remainder of this loan will be liquidated in the course of 1932. Debts due to merchants will be paid off in 1933- 34. If conditions are reasonably favourable the State should be completely solvent by the beginning of 1935. Considering the world wide trade depression which has of course affected Muscat most adversely, and particularly the fact that by its foreign treaties the Musat State is unable, like other governments, to increase its taxes on its principal source of revenue, i.e., Customs dues on imports which still remain at the very low figure of 5 per cent, (though negotiations are in progress to change this state of affairs), the present financial condition of the State can be considered as satisfactory. 19. &gt;SW —The improvement in the general conditions at Sur described in last year s Report was continued m 1931. During the summer Saiyid Said paid several visits to our and with the support of the officiating Political Agent, and helped y the fact that his visits were made m H. M. sloops thus creating a good moral effect, succeeded m establishing more or less complete administrative and Customs omrol over Sur, that is to say over the Jenebeh elements of the town, which result- for'Xe^ea^W.;! a 7 ^ vwr “ffl? a di ® ti “ ct rise in t!le Customs collections for tiie year. In^pite of Shaikh Ah-al-Hamudah, the Chief of the Bani Bu Ah wao had the effrontery to forbid the building of a new Customs House in Sur, this nmamg was erected on a suitable site opposite Aiqa. The Bani Bu Ali elements m Aiqa, however, instigated by Shaikh Ali, remained intransigent, refused to pay Customs cues, and on the occasion of a visit to Sur by Saiyid Said accompanied^v fea°d“fom AgeUt ’ “ 0ct ° W ’ 20 . 1US D 1 rou f llt matters to a head, and as immediate action the “ A1 Saidi ” as she couK^ontT^ dliovr was duly intercepted and brought into Muscat. S ° nePolitical and financial points of view. If the Bani Bu Ali were able to defy the State and pre\ ent it from collecting Customs dues at Aiqa then the Jenebeh would also not unnaturally follow their example. If the Jenebeh refused to pay revenue then the Batinah tribes—the Yal Saad, etc.—would be likewise. The case also was being watched from the interior. It was not therefore a question of getting some more thousands of dollars out of Sur—though that was by no means a negligible factor in itself—it was a question of the political and financial future of the State. The financial prospects of the State were fair (see paragraph 18 above) and provided that the Bani Bu Ali problem was solved successfully the State might be consi dered convalescent. If the problem was not solved successfully then the State would undoubtedly suffer a relapse. The Hon’ble the Political Besident obtained sanction therefore to inform Shaikh Ali that His Majesty’s Government would support the State in its demands with regard to Aiqa and on the 13th December visited Sur accompanied by Saiyid Said and the Political Agent. There a long interview with Shaikh Ali took place lasting several hours and the demands of the State were once more put to him. (1) That Customs dues should be paid in Aiqa. (2) That for this purpose a Customs post should be established there. (3) That Aiqa dhows should be registered as were dhows belonging to other subjects of the State. Shaikh Ali, supported by his advisers Shaikh Khamis bin Said and Shaikh Abdullah- al-Bawwaf, showed himself obdurate. Every effort was made to win him over by argument, and various proposals were suggested to enable him to ‘ save his face ’ and climb down gracefully. Thus Saiyid Said offered to hire a house from Shaikh Ali in Aiqa which would form the Customs post, and the guards for it could also be provided by the Shaikh. The latter stated that by giving up the practice (illegal of course) of collecting Customs dues himself he would be put to a personal loss of $600 a year. Saiyid Said offered to give him double the amount, $1,200 per annum, in addition to the subsidy of $1,200 per annum he already got as Shaikh. No arguments or concessions were of any avail, and the Shaikh firmly refused the demands of the State, notwithstanding that it was firmly impressed on him that these had the support of His Majesty’s Government. The result of the interview was reported by the Hon’ble the Political Besident to Government with recommendations for Naval and Air action against the Bani Bu Ali if they still persist ed in their rebellious attitude and thus the situation remained at the close of the year. . 22. The Batineh. —The Batineh coast remained quiet throughout the year, the chief event of importance in the area being the “ deposition ” of Saiyid Hamad, Wah of Sohar, and brother of the Sutlan, by his youthful nephew Saiyid Said.’ Saiyid Hamad is a man of ability and his rule in Sohar was marked by firmness, He had, however, enjoyed the Waiiship for a considerable period, some 10 years, assumed a quasi-independent attitude towards the Council of Ministers, and remitt ed a remarkably small percentage of the revenue from his district to the State treasury. Complaints as to his rule also began to come in to the Council. In March, Saiyid Said, having decided that Saiyid Hamad must go, boarded the “ A1 Saidi ”, the State gunboat, with 25 men of the Muscat Infantry, and sailed for Sohar. Saiyid Hamad having the reputation of being a strong man there was some doubt as to the result of the move. However, Goliath was impressed by David’s audacity (Saiyid Said being small in stature and Saiyid Hamad tall the simile is not inapt), gave up his post without opposition and was subsequently made the Wall c f Matrah where under Saiyid Said’s eye he has been on his best be haviour. This exhibition of resolution by Saiyid Said had undoubtedly a wide spread effect throughout the State, more especially on his uncles of whom there is a plethora. 23. Masirah Island. This far-off island, nearly two hundred miles south of Bas-ai-Hadd, and some three hundred miles from Muscat, came into prominence during the year as a link in the Boyal Air Force aviation chain with Aden. y ar i°us visits were made to it by sloops, the flying boats, the Political Agent, and m the absence of the latter on recess by Captain Prior. The object of the visits vas to arrange with the Islanders, who belong to various tribal confederations on the mainland, for buoys for. flying boats, a petrol tank for refuelling, and a landing40 ground at the village of Umm Rasas. The Islanders proved abstmate as to the making of any agreement, but by the end of the year had grown accustomed to the visits Sf flying boats, and when the Air Vice-Marshal made his flight to Dhofar (see paragraph 33) petrol was dumped at Umm Rasas and not interfered with. 24. Gwadvr —The post of the British Agent, Gwadur, was held thoughout the year by Sultan Khan, Military pensioner. Affairs remained normal during the year except for the murder of a Khoja, one Ghulam Ali, son of Karam Ali, which occurred on the 15th February. Infor mation of the murder was received by wire from the British Agent, Gwadur, on the 16th February, and the Hon’ble the Political Resident was communicated with. Under arrangement with the Senior Naval Officer a sloop arrived at Muscat on the morning of the 18th February, embarked Shaikh Zubair, the Muscat State Minister of Justice, and the Political Agent, and landed the party at Gwadur on the 19th. Shaikh Zubair and the Political Agent, sitting as a combined Court of Enquiry, instituted an exhaustive investigation which lasted from the 19th-23rd February during which over 30 witnesses were closely examined, and the scene of the crime was frequently visited. The murdered man had been discovered on the morning of the 16th February in his shop, which was also his home, with his throat cut. He was last seen alive on the previous evening. No evidence was forthcoming to bring the murderer, or murderers, to light, nor to throw suspicion in any particular direction. The Khoja community expressed their gratitude for the promptness and thoroughness with which the enquiry had been conducted. 25. Towards the end of the year, at the suggestion of the Political Agent and with the cooperation of the State, a Standing Khoja-Baluch Committee was ini tiated at Gwadur. Its raison d’etre is on special occasions to assist the Wali and the Biitish Agent to keep the peace between the Khoja and Baluch communities in the event of any unfortunate incident arising' between them, and on ordinary occasions to assist as far as possible in the settling of Khoja-Baluch civil disputes in an amicable manner out of Court. 26. Missionary Work. —Missionary activity was represented throughout the year by Rev. D. Dykstra and family, Dr. (Miss) Hosmon and Dr. and Mrs. W. H. Storm of the Dutch Reformed Church of the United States of America. In May Mrs. Storm died in India. 27. In March Dr. Storm visited Wadi Muawil, Nakhal, Jabel Akhdar and Rustak. At Muawil he is said to have performed 20 operations two of which proved fatal. Ihese places are cutside the jurisdiction of the Muscat State and he visited them in spite of the Council of Ministers and the Political Agent accepting no responsibility for his safety. With the sanction of the Council Dr. .(Miss) Hosmon accompanied by Mrs. Dykstra and an Indian nurse visited Sohar, Saham and Khaburah. A good deal of material has been imported and the building operations of a hospital at Matrah are proceeding. 28. Visits of Government officials.—\nh-\5th February—The Hon’ble Lieute nant-Colonel H. V. Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, accompanied by his Secretary Captain J. R. L. Bradshaw and the Residency Surgeon Maior H. J. M. Symons, M.C., I.M.S. 29. 28th Febiuary-lst March—Air Vice-Marshal E. R. Ludlow-Hewitt, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., M.C., accompanied by his staff and other officers. 30. 20th-25th May—Captain C. G.

Climate— r T_\iQ total rainfall registered during the year amounted to 5-03 inches. The maximum and minimum temperatures registered during the year were 114 8 on 2nd July and 52 • 7 on 14th December respectively. The summer, like last year, was less trying than usual. 29th July—6th August 11th-19th December 12th-22nd December 13th-16th December 35. Muscat Infantry R. A. Walker completed his term of duty as t ommandant of the Corps and left to rejoin his regiment on the 23rd April. Owing to financial strigency no Commandant was appointed to succeed him, but it was arranged with the Council of Ministers that at the end of the year Captain Alban. Indian Political Department, should take up the duties of Commandant as well as financial Adviser at the beginning of 1932. The Agency guard was furnished from this Corps. 36 Slave Traffic. Twenty-two slaves took refuge at the Agency during the year all of whom were manumitted after enquiries. The comments made in last year’s Report may here be repeated :— “ It should be noted that there is no question of the slaves—while with their masters being kept in durance, shakled with chains, etc. y* 1 V ie C01ltrar y they are generally used for work far removed from the houses of their masters in date gardens, pearling and so forth. This means that the great majority of the slaves have ample oppor tunity for leaving their masters should they wish to, and for seeking manumission at this Agency, and the fact that such manumission can be obtained is now widely known throughout the State. ” MC392FD T. C. FOWLS, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Agent and H. B. M.'s Consul, Muscat.42 CHAPTER VII. Administration Report for the Trucial Coast of Oman for the year 1931 ^ Personnel. —Khan Bahadur Isa bin Abdul Latif, held the post of Residency Agent, Shargah, throughout the year. Pearl Fisheries—The pearl fishing operations on the Trucial coast commenced on the 2nd April and lasted till the 20th September. The catch was not a good one, and owing to the general depression of trade prices fell about 50 per cent. Even at these prices, however, purchasers were not forthcoming and merchants were left with large quantitites of pearls on their hands. Since the pearl fisheries are the sole means of subsistance of the inhabitants of the Trucial coast, acute economic distress ensued. The poorer classes were reduced to the brink of starvation (though as long as there are fish in the sea they can never actually starve), while the mercantile class, captains of boats, etc., were in many cases unable to meet their liabilities. Aviation .—In last year’s report reference was made to the obstructive attitude adopted by the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah in connection with the storage of petrol for the Royal Air Force at that place. Since then no further difficulties have been experienced at Ras-al-Khaimah, though the Shaikh has displayed but little liking for the presence of the barge. The flying boats of No. 203 (Flying Boat) Squadron have, however, repeatedly landed at Ras-al-Khaimah throughout the year and on two occasions Wapitis have also landed there. The Shaikh has maintained guards over the petrol barge and has accepted payment for them but protested the first time Wapitis landed there. His protests were, however, ignored. During the summer discussions took place in London, at which the Hon’ble the Political Resident was present, regarding the transfer of the Civil Air Route from the Persian to the Arabian coast in the event of the Persian Government refusing to extend Imperial Airways’ concession. The Political Resident expressed the view that while the Shaikhs of the Trucial coast were frankly averse from affording any facilities to civil aircraft, which they felt might involve the presence of Europeans in their territories and interference in their internal affairs, it might be possible to overcome their reluctance if they were offered a sufficiently large pecuniary inducement, but that failing this it would be necessary for His Majesty’s Government to authorise coercive measures. He was therefore instructed to sound the Shaikhs of Ras-al-Khaimah and Umm-al-Qawain as to whether they would be prepared to authorise the construction of a rest house in their territories and under take to protect Imperial Airways’ establishments in return for a suitable subsidy. He accordingly proceeded to the Trucial coast in November, accompanied by Air Vice-Marshal Ludlow-Hewitt, Air Officer Commanding in Iraq. An examination of the creek at Umm-al-Qawain, however, showed that it was unsuitable for air craft, and the Air Officer Commanding suggested as an alternative that facilities should be sought from the Shaikh of Debai if the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah was unwilling to accord them. The latter was therefore approached in the first instance but was entirely uncompromising, and stated that his price was half a lakh—a figure which was, and was intended to be, prohibitive. The Political Resident, therefore, proceeded to Debai, where Shaikh Said was in the first instance con ciliatory and stated that while he would have to consult his relatives, he thought it would be possible to come to terms. Unfortunately just at that time he fell ill with a very sharp attack of bronchitis and up to the end of the year no settlement had been effected. Debai. Ruler. Shaikh Said bin Maktum bin Haskar. Though personally very friendly, he is not a strong man, and stands in considerable fear of an influen tial faction of his family, who have in the past made attempts to depose him. In October the Shaikh accompanied by his brother Juma, visited the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Qatar, returning with the customary presents. The Shaikh of Debai subsequently sent his brother Juma to Muscat to intercede on behalf of Shaikh Hasan, ea^haikh of Khassab, who had been incarcerated for rebellion against the UbCa -a ^e. was subsequently arranged through the intervention of the political authorities that Shaikh Hasan should be allowed to stay at Debai, the Shaikh of Debai guaranteeing that he would not allow him to return to Khassab. , Aft ® r V 18,1 ^ e Courts and in accordance with the Koranic injunctions the hand of one Sahm bin Feroze was cut off by orders of the Shaikh of Debai for43 theft. The Political Resident pointed out that it was a savage and cruel punish ment which permanently incapacitated an individual from earning his livelihood, and expressed a hope that it would not in future be resorted to. The Shaikh’s excuse was that the man was a habitual offender, and that the Trucial Shaikhs could not afford to maintain men in prison. As the slow mail steamers call only fortnightly at Lingah now, the Shaikh of Charak has inaugurated a launch service for passengers between the Trucial coast and Lingah, Bastak and other small ports on the Persian coast. Travellers dis embark at Debai and proceed onward by launch. Skargah .—Ruler : Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar. At the end of January 3rd slaves from Hairah took refuge in the house of the Residency Agent, seeking manumis sion, but the headman of Hairah, Abdur Rahman bin Muhammad, father-in-law of the Shaikh, who had previously been deported to Aden and had recently been allowed to return, surrounded the house of the Residency Agent with a body of armed men. Word was sent to the Shaikh, who, however, was very apathetic and made little attempt to protect the Khan Bahadur. Ultimately, however, some of the leading inhabitants intervened and Abdur Rahman withdrew his men. It was felt that it 'was essential to exact satisfaction for this incident: firstly, in order to impress upon the Trucial Shaikhs that any interference with slaves attempting to seek their freedom would involve drastic punishments and also in order to protect the life and uphold the prestige of the British Representative on the Coast. With the approval of the Government of India and of His Majesty’s Government the Political Resident requested the Senior Naval Officer to send a sloop to Shargah, with instructions to call upon the Shaikh either to surrender Abdur Rahman or to pay a fine of Rs. 2,000 and surrender 100 rifles, failing which the towers surrounding the town would be demolished. The Shaikh declined to surrender Abdur Rahman but paid the fine and deposited the rifles within the specified period. Hamriyah .—On the 4th February Shaikh Abdur Rahman bin Saif was assas sinated by his nephew Saif bin Abdullah, while saying his prayers in a mosque. Saif and two of his brothers had been brought up by Abdur Rahman and when they came of age demanded their father’s patrimony. Abdur Rahman at first disclaimed liability, but ultimately said that he would pay them a certain sum when he had sold some pearls. As however he made no attempt to fulfil his under taking Saif and his brothers who had lost, money pearling and were in straitened circumstances decided to murder him. On his death Saif with his adherents occupied the town and was accepted by the inhabitants as their headman. Abdur Rahman left a son Humaid who was at the time at Debai. He at once sought the support of the other Trucial Shaikhs in obtaining the succession, but as the inhabi tants were not in his favour none of the other Shaikhs were willing to intervene. Ultimately on the 19th July some friends of his who were in the employ of Shaikh Saif attempted to murder the latter, but he escaped and locked himself into a private room in the fort. Word was sent to Humaid but the inhabitants of the town came to the rescue of Saif and drove out the supporters of Humaid, and when the latter arrived he at once had to retire. The incident, however, appears to have affected Saif’s nerves and he began to suspect everyone of treachery, and to have adopted an oppressive attitude towards the inhabitants of Hamriyah, On the 21st August when Saif was absent on a short visit to his date plantations, the inhabitants invited Humaid to occupy the town. The latter who was at that time at Debai collected 60 Manasir beduin and entered Hamriyah and besieged the tower in which Saif’s brothers had taken refuge, but on the personal intervention of the Shaikh of Umm-al-Qawain they were allowed to leave Hamriyah and Humaid became Headman. Saif and his brothers subsequently left for Qatar. Raids .—Numerous minor raids by Manasir Awamir and A1 Bu Shamis beduin took place during the year. These gentry habitually levy blackmail on the Shaikhs of the Trucial coast who are compelled to buy them off or have their herds, camels, etc., stolen and even their subjects carried off into captivity. The number of raids varies in inverse ratio to the ability or willingness of the Shaikhs to pay, and in years like that under report, when the Shaikhs themselves have very little money, are naturally more numerous than in years of greater prosperity. It is unneces sary to report these minor incidents in detail, but one incident had wider repercus* sions and should be placed on record.44 On the 2nd May a cousin of the Shaikh of Baraimi visited Debai to purchase foodstuffs, piece-goods, etc., and having bought 30 camel-loads was returning to Baraimi. On the edge of the Debai frontier his caravan was ambushed by a gang of 25 beduin, consisting of Abu Dhabi subjects and Manasir tribesmen, who opened fire suddenly killing the cousin of the Shaikh of Baraimi and three of the servants and wounding the remaining three, after which they made off with the goods and camels. The Shaikh of Baraimi addressed the Rulers of Debai and Abu Dhabi demanding restoration of the goods and punishment of the culprits. As the Shaikhs took no action he summoned to his help some of the Bani Ghaffir of the South and attacked some subjects of Abu Dhabi, killing three men and capturing 30 camels. In retaliation some Dhwahir tribesmen of Abu Dhabi raided Baraimi territory, killing two men and wounding four, and as a reprisal some of the Naim tribe assailed the people of Abu Dhabi, killing four men and wounding five, their own casualties being three killed and five wounded. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi then having obtained the support of the Shaikh of Debai, sent his brother Shaikh Hazza’ with 500 men to reinforce the people residing on his frontier, but the Shaikh of Baraimi with 400 men made a night attack on the village of A1 Ain in Jov, belonging to Abu Dhabi: he was however driven off, the aggressors losing 12 killed and 7 wounded and the A1 Ain 8 killed and 11 wounded. Having failed in this attack the Shaikh of Baraimi besieged the village of Ain A1 Dhwahir and blocked up the springs which watered the plantations and cut down several date gardens. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi with 500 men set out to rel pve the besieged village, but finally decided tq await further support from Debai. On the 14th June a caravan carrying food for the relief of the beleagured force was robbed inside Abu Dhabi territory by a raiding party of the Shaikh of Baraimi, and four days later a second caravan of 33 camels carrying food for the Abu Dhabi force was plundered, one of the escort being killed and the remaining two wounded. At this juncture, the Jowasim Shaikhs of Shargah, Ras-al-Khaimah and the Shaikh of Ajman agreed to support Baraimi against Abu Dhabi and Debai: since the Jowasim are Ghaffiris, while the Bani las, to whom Abu Dhabi and Debai belong, are Hanawis, there was every likelihood of a general conflagration developing on the old tribal lines of Ghaffiri against Hanawi. The Shaikh of Debai hearing that the food caravan sent to relieve the Abu Dhabi forces had been looted left with 700 men towards Baraimi and had a meeting with the Shaikh of Baraimi and succeeded in arranging a 15 days truce, with a view to negotiating a final settlement; this truce however was repeatedly violated by the ' beduin on both sides, the chief culprits being the Manasir, allies of Abu Dhabi, and finally expired on the 8th July without any final settlement haying being arrived at. On the 12th a party of Baraimi beduin attacked the Oebai camp inflicting several casualties. A counter raid by Abu Dhabi tollowed in which 5 of the enemy were killed and 200 sheep, 20 cows, and 10 donkeys were carried off. On the 19th July the Shaikh of Baraimi and his allies made a combined attack on the Shaikh of Debai, killing 10 and wounding 14 of his men while some of their followers raided Jumairah near Debai and carried off 3 slaves on hnrtt T k J fUI v T fig , ht , 1 t ?°u Pla ° e 011 the 30th Ju ’y and casualties occurred on both sides, after which a lull followed, which gave the Shaikh of Debai further opportunity of effecting a settlement. Finally on the 9th August peace was restored the conditions being that both sides should bury the hatchet and that the people of Baraimi should clean out the water springs which they had closed.CHAPTER Vin.

Holmes his health improved. He agreed to a 10 per cent, cut in the A1 Khalifa ami y allowances but made no attempt to reduce his personal expenditure and s now m financial difficulties. He has little sense of values and gave unnecessarily large presents to his many visitors during the year. His Excellency is of too generous a disposition and these self invited visitors, who are almost all neighbour- mg shaikhs, have no object m coming other than lining their pockets, for in these parts the host is expected to give his guests presents and tip their servants lavishly. Shaikh Hamad cannot be made to realise that the more he gives to these People, the more will come to Bahrain. If taken to task, His Excellency will say that he does it to serve the British Government by demonstrating to his Government 1116 ^ ^ and ^PP 111688 1x0 enjoys in the shadow of His Majesty’s Shaikh AbduUa bm Isa is apparently genuinely interested in his portfolio of Education, but shows a tendency to pass on more disagreeable problems to the for , dl ®P, osa !- He took his usual hunting trips to the mainland, seeking busta rds and bedoum brides with equal zeal. h Shaikh Muhammad bin Isa proceeded to India for the sake of his health at the close of the year His real object m going was to save money, since he gets free tickets froin the British India Steam Navigation Company and he finds he can live cheaper m Bombay than Bahrain. An improvement in the Manama Munici- ^ PresTdeir 78 n0tlCeable when his brotller ’ Shaikl1 Abdulla, takes over his duties Shaikh Salman has done good work on the Bahrain Court and is the only member of his family who is not afraid of hard work. The Bahrain Court are handicapped by a tendency on the part of Shaikh Hamad to revise their orders v hen they give decisions unfavourable to prominent men, but with the death of Shaikh Isa and the accession of Shaikh Hamad, Shaikh Salman’s position will become much stronger. Shaikh Salman is on excellent terms with the Agency. Shaikh Rashid bm Muhammad is President of the Majlis al IM, or Commer- well Court’ and also tke Dlv mg Court. He has little influence, but has done quite dnnp S wpl1 kl1 a S° WS ?^ 0mise ° n the Lower ^rain Court and has intelligent of ^ ^ Ha ^ d ha \ n0t mUCil character &gt; ^ the most intelligent of the Shaikh s sons, and now that he has been provided with glasses he is making most praiseworthy efforts to remedy his lack of education. vnn The . Polltlcal Agent’s efforts to persuade Shaikh Hamad to see that his two youngest sons Daij and Ahmad, received some education did not meet with much uccess, but a local man has been found to teach them two mornings a week It was suggested that three mornings a week would be more useful, but His Excellency felt this would be too great a strain for his Benjamin, Daij. P • Bahrain £ate.-Mr. Belgrave proceeded on leave on the 12th April and re- turnea on hez8th October. During his absence Captain Parke acted for him He teWhil bad,' 11 laStlC reC€ttiCn 011 tlS retUTn ’ and tbe Sbaikk 8eemed g lad MC392FDThe Sir te is forturate to have Mr. Belgrave. He is liked by the people who realise that his woik benefits them and he shows marked courage in combating raids on the Bahrain finances from whatever source. Captain Parke acted for Mr. Belgrave during the latter’s absence on leave, in addition to his own duties as Commandant of Police. He has not the courage of the latter in resisting raids on the State Treasury and is apt to ingratiate himself by increasing the Civil list or attempting to do so. Mr. de Grenier discharged his humdrum duties with his usual zeal. He is not popular with a section of the merchants, indeed no honest Director of Customs, could ever be really popular, but His Excellency realises that he would have much less money to spend if it were not for Mr. de Grenier’s untiring efforts, and supports him. Bahrain Police .—Under this heading are grouped all the forces of law and order, consisting of the Indian Armed Police, the local police (or Branch Police as they are called) and the Naturs or night watchmen. The latter are an irregular body who do not wear uniform or perform any drills, but are armed with long Lee Enfield rifles. The naturs are posted at Budaiya, Manama and Muharraq only. The strength of these bodies is given below. Strength on Strength on 1st January 31st Decem 1931. ber 1931. Indian Police, all ranks including clerk 71 50 Followers, tailors, mistry, etc. 6 6 Arab Police, including four village fidawis and clerk ., 43 56 Naturs 236 221 The Bahrain Government have been training local men to replace the Indians as the agreements of the latter expire, and propose to substitute local men for the remainder during 1932, since they can now be obtained in sufficient numbers^ The Indians are relatively expensive and know little Arabic or Persian ; they do not thrive in Bahrain, as the climate seems as trying to them as it is to Europeans, The recruits are mostly of negroid extraction since the Arab objects to uniform or discipline, but the Amirs on the mainland rely to a large extent on a similar type of man, and there is no reason why they should not do well. Local affairs. Sunni-Shiah relations have been good, and the younger gene ration appear to have little religious animosity to other sects. Shaikh Abdulla and Shaikh Ali bin Hasan continue to be the Shiah Qadhis. The former is an aleit and intelligent man and both are on very good terms with the Agency. The Sunni Qadhis are the three Abdul Latifs and they are not on over good terms with either the Bahrain Government or the Agency. They have so far dehed all attempts to place the Sunni Waqfs on a proper footing, but the policy of the State is to allow them to reduce them to greater chaos than they are already in betore taking definite action in the matter. A 7 iTf oyyght “ Baghdad the prohibition against the return of bhaikh khalaf was overlooked and he was given a visa for Bahrain. His return caused great alarm to the Shiah Qadhis, since he has immense influence, and they were paafied with difficulty. The Political Agent warned Shaikh Khalaf that 1m would be returned to Iraq if he gave further trouble. His Excellency at first determined only to allow him a brief visit to Bahrain but changed his mind with characteristic weakness, and asked the Political Agent to agree to his remaining permanently in Bahrain. S 8 0 nis remamln g that it should be T d f ° r m f {^-making, it seemed to the Political Agem and he did not cal to i hl “ P™? trouMe if was allowed to stay him to remll so L* af ^ odmm of opposing his return if the Shaikh desirei avid lerv much in Ihe ^ '’PJT'i 8 the su gg e s&lt;d°m Sllaikh Kllalaf ha , ssska* m *•&gt;- On thT.thof Mao’to.rftTLrbul Cflf .'f*”. n °, ^ muriein o: sians and Somalis at Muharraq The subiect' att aflra 7 took place between Per mice of opinion between a Person b^r a^d a So r ^ dlSpUte WaS a diffe and a bomali customer regarding a penn}loaf. Fortunately tFe Somalis were heavily outnumbered or several neople would have been killed and as it was a dozen were injured. The incident shows that Bahrain still possesses the elements of discord. Oil concession. On the 26th May, Major Holmes and five American employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company arrived, and were followed later by another five. About a thousand tons of equipment followed by successive steamers, and drilling started in October, His Excellency Shaikh Hamad working the drill for its first few blows. The rig quivered under the impacts and His Excellency glanced at it and said “ the machine is drunk ! ” The organisation of the Oil Company is remarkable. Of the immense quantities of stores required, nothing was mislaid and everything arrived on time. With the exception of Major Holmes, all the operating staff are Americans, and » the rig hands are mostly Iraqi, in fact except for the Sikhs in the Power House, j all are non-British Subjects. Major Holmes announced on his arrival that they would employ some 400 men, but this figure has never been reached, and as soon as the camp was complete the number was reduced to some 80 or 90. With the exception of the Nissen huts which are made in England, and which they are dissatisfied with, all their requirements from machinery to lead pencils have been imported from the United States, and this influx has had a decided effect of introducing goods of American manufacture into the bazaar. It is an interest- ing point that in spite of their enthusiasm for things made in the United States of America they have not made any ra/pjprochement with the Arabian Mission, and there is little love lost between them. . r ^^ ie cam P is fitted with everything that practical comfort could suggest, and refrigerators, electric light and heaters, full length baths and hot and cold showers and water-borne sanitation are apparently a sine qua non on £ location ’, though they would be considered luxuries by most officials in India. The American employees that have been sent have so far proved to be of a good type, and have given little trouble. Artesian Wells. Shaikh Hamad has had great success with his well at Khar- zekhan, but has so far only been able to utilize a fraction of the water. As was noted last year, far too much water is being wasted and Major Holmes states that the head of water, formerly 24 feet, is now only 17. He considers the springs in the sea should be blocked and all further drilling stopped. When funds permit, it would pay the State to import a qualified engineer to advise them regarding their policy with Artesian wells. Agriculture. The work of the agriculturist has been restricted by the paucity j h.® ^ as been occupied on Shaikh Hamad’s estates and has given elementary instruction in some of the schools. He also supervised some experiments with cotton on land belonging to the Qusaibis, and the British Cotton Growing Association reported that the samples, sent them were of excel lent quality. This was particularly interesting in view of the fact that it was planted too late in the season. Until cotton can be grown on a larger scale it will not be very profitable, and local landowners have been unwilling to embark on a crop which shows such a poor return at present world prices. The Government cannot now spare the funds for encouraging them or providing the ginning machinery that is required. Some progress is being made with market gardening, but the taste for vegetables grows • • -d^v 16 P r ^ ce -^ a ^ lra i n dates fell below that at which Basra dates could be landed m Bahrain and rent receipts were accordingly very poor. His Excellency lost oyer half of his private income owing to this, but rents are invariably fixed very high, and it is only in the best years that the full amounts can be recovered. Customs. The Customs revenue amounted to Es. 5,09,000, the decline in commodity prices being mainly responsible for this. . Municipalities. Both Municipahties do good work and there is much friendly rivalry between them. Both have met declining revenues by cuts in their ex penses, and though no large works have been undertaken, a good standard of gene ral working has been maintained. A tendency on the part of the Manama Muni cipality to consider itself a State Council has been checked. The Muharraq bazaar as been ht with electric lights and its sea road completed. A considerable48 amount of road widening has taken place, and at the suggestion of the Political Agent, a parallel road to the Manama Sea Road is being constructed which will open up the whole area, now served by wretched lanes. The doctrine that the roads should precede building development created some astonishment but is now well established. The Political Agent was asked to arbitrate in the question of the huge area of land claimed by the Qusaibis behind the Mission Hospital. A most unhealthy swamp had grown up here, and now that the boundaries have been fixed (the award gave the Qusaibis a fifth of what they claimed) the Municipality are drying the land by pumping. Gramophones, hitherto immoral and banned, are now allowed in coffee shops though their records are strictly censored at the time of import, It is interesting to hear that while German (Arabic) records are found to be very immoral, His Master’s Voice records are comparatively pure. The Shara’s Courts still refuse to accept the evidence of gramophone sellers, as such men must obviously be immoral. It is the general view that the age is getting much more immoral, and one frequently hears that immorality is, on the increase since men can no longer kill offending female relations. Liquor seems to be finding its way into the towns in spite of all attempts of the Police to check it, and as elsewhere, prohibition seems to have bred bootlegg ing. Public ITor&amp;s.—Owing to shortage of funds no works of any importance were undertaken, but the new Quarantine buildings were completed. Education. —The number of schools in existence on the 1st January and 31st December is the same as in 1931 none having been abolished or opened during the year, There are two girls schools and six boys schools, Manama Sunni and Shiah, Muharraq Sunni, Hedd Sunni, Rafa’ Sunni, Suqal Khamis Shiah. No. of teachers No. of Tea- on 1st Jan chers on 31st uary 1931. December 1931.

English is now taught only in the two top forms of the schools. Since the pruning of the Educational Council the schools have been running comparatively smoothly, though the Shiah school in Manama has comparative'! few students in comparison to its capacity. umparanveiy u 4 - ^ re ^S| ou s teacher in a Manama Sunni school began to give trouble in Tnlv “ “ d “• -« Sp.— 3 w l American Mission maintain a boys school and a girls school The former had a maximum enro ment of 149 with an average attendance of 54 and the latter 115 and 33. The girls school is a very go ahead affair, and does a great deal of good. The girls play tennis and go for picnics, both unheard of libertfes for Arab * and , lf any improvement is effected in the position of women in Bahrain it will be mainly through the agency of Mrs. Dame’s school. The more eraser™ tfw Arabs do not approve of girls learning to write as thev so., pi, ° re ffnservative messages to their lovers. “ y Say the y could then sendtrade of Bahrain would have come to a standstill. This surprising demand from India is thought to be due to money that could not be spent on better class textiles owing to the boycott being expended in pearls. Another view is that pearls are an essential part of certain religious ceremonies among Hindus, and still an other view, that in a world of fluctuating values some felt pearls were a good in vestment. Both catch and prices were poor, though prices did not fall below the very low figures of the preceding year. Next year, there is little doubt that many fewer boats will set out for there is no longer the capital to finance them. It is estimated that two-thirds of the pearling capital in Bahrain has disappeared into the sea in the last three years, and men who had a capital of ten or fifteen lakhs have nothing left except pearls for which there are no purchasers. Bad though the state of trade is in Bahrain there is some comfort to be found in the reflection that our neighbours are worse off, for Qatif and Qatar are to all intents and purposes ruined. A cause of the comparative prosperity of Bahrain is to be found in the fact that Gulf capitalists have steadily been moving their capital over and establishing their headquarters here for some years past. This is true both of the Arab and Bersian coasts, and is a great tribute to the administration of Bahrain. There is little doubt that its good order, security, bank, wireless and shipping facilities act as lodestones, and both Nejdi and Persian merchants and shaikhs have been moving their valuables to its gilt-edged shores. The total value of the trade amounted to Bs. 1,71,20,220 as compared with Bs. 2,53,00,480 during the preceding year. The total value of imports amounted to Bs. 1,04,61,880 as against Bs. 1,60,37,490 the preceding year. The exports amounted to Bs. 66,58,340 as against Bs. 9,26,29,990 for the preceding year. The figures of export are not accurate since few of the pearls exported are declared at their proper value if declared at all. Pearling Industry. —The Political Agent paid a visit to the pearl banks in the S. L. “ John Lambert ”, and boarded a number of Bahrain vessels. He took fresh limes and some simple medicines with him and was v^ry well received by the nakhudas. Two divers were brought back for medical treatment, one being in the last stages of tuberculosis. Industry. —It is pleasant to have to record the birth of a new industry in Bafirain. Khalil Kanoo, and one Faik Adham, a Syrian, entered into a partner ship to produce tiles and were given a monopoly for two years to encourage them. They have produced some 70,000 of excellent quality and fully equal to the best that Basra produces but lave found some difficulty in disposing of them. The partnership Las broken up, Faik Adham describing his late partner as “ a friendly thief ”. If times w~ere normal they would have done very well. Athletics. —There has been a marked interest in football during the past year and the Political Agent took a team to Basra for three days. Boat Building and Shipping. —The total number of motor launches plying for hire on 31st December was 53. Of these 5 were built during the year. Thirty-two Sailing vessels were built in Bahrain during the year as compared with 55 built the preceding year. One hundred and sixteen British Ships, 10 German and 1 Norwegian entered and cleared the Port of Bahrain as compared with 123 British ships and 11 German ships that called during the preceding year. Early in November the British India Steam Navigation Company decided to allow their down steamers to make a weekly call at Bahrain instead of fortnightly. This has been a welcome change and is much appreciated by the local mercantile community. Seven accidents took place at sea, within Port limits, during the year and in three cases loss of life occurred, once when a coolie was killed while cargo was being discharged from the s. s. “Bankura ” on the 19th April, and on two other occasions when men were swept overboard and drowned, one of these accidents occurring on a landing company’s lighter. ^ The Landing Company have worked at a loss throughout the year and have had several boats badly damaged in the heavy storms at the close of the year. MC3S2FD p50 Electric Light.—The electric light has been extended to Muharraq, by over^ head wire as far as the deep channel and thereafter by submarine cable, the poles for the overhead wires being placed on piers that will later be incorporated in the Manama-Muharraq sea road. The concern which belongs partly to the State and partly to the Municipalities, is paying its way but not making sufficient as yet to meet depreciation charges. Mr. W. B. Steele had taken the place of Mr. F. V. Jordan and has been en gaged as a full time State servant. He was formerly an employee of Messrs. Callander’s Cable and Construction Company. He also fulfils the duties of State Engineer. Royal Navy .—Several visits were paid to Bahrain by His Majesty’s Ships stationed in the Persian Gulf and on the 18th December the H. M. S. “ Emerald ” arrived on a 4 days visit. While she was in port a fatal accident occurred when F./Lt. D. Heinneman, who was giving demonstrations in the ships’ “ flycatcher” of machine gunning targets on the water, lost flying speed, stalled and crashed alongside the ship. He was buried next day with full military honours and a huge following of Arabs accompanied the body to the grave. It was particularly unfortunate that the accident should have occurred as the “Emerald ” were giving a party to the notables of Bahrain to demonstrate the various activities of the vessel. Royal Air Force. —There is little that is new to record regarding the Royal Air Force. They appear to have given up their Khor Lupin moorings, indeed the Khor is too small for such big vessels as the Ran goons, and are now concentrated in Khor Kaliya. On one occasion a seaplane accompanied two Rangoon and they were a mooring short. A violent storm aro e but the odd Rangoon was able to ride it out at its own anchor, thereby proving that the holding ground is good. The Political Agent undertook several flights accompanying a flight to Masira Island in May. The brother of the Shaikh of Rasal Khaimah was flown to Bahrain for medical treatment and flown ack again after a week s stay. His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad-al-Jabir paid his first visit of the year to Bahrain in a flying boat. British Interests.—m. P. W. B. Walker of the Mesopotamia Persia Corpora tion Limited who had been unwell for some time was relieved by Mr. J Russell from Bunder Abbas in April. Mr. H. Barden of the Eastern Bank, Limited, was relieved by Mr. D Ham in September. m TH? ank . deci( ^ ed to build new premises on the sea road at a cost of Rs. 75 000, The building is being built by an Iraqi contractor from reinforced concrete’, the first occasion on which this material has been employed in Bahrain It will be very interesting to see the fate of the cement, since, the Bahrain air and water have hitherto undermined the best that can be produced.

During the year 3,566 registered letters were received and 3,080 despatched as compared with 4,499 letters received and 4,097 despatched last year. Four thousand and seventy-one parcels were received and 267 despatched and Its. 13,698-4-0 worth of stamps were sold. Cash certificates^ worth Rs. 35,923-8-0 were sold and certificates worth Rs. 18,720-5-0 were discharged. British Postal Orders to the value of Rs. 799-8-6 were sold and Rs. 11-15-0 paid. Savings Bank deposits amounted to Rs. 42,879 and Money Orders for Rs. 1,30,475-5-5 were issued and Rs. 8,233-7-4 paid. On the 1st November the Post Office moved to its new quarters. The need for extra accommodation in the Agency having been keenly felt, proposals were submitted during the early part of the year involving the alteration of two bffi ceh rooms to make a new Post Office. The proposal was sanctioned, and a new Post Office was provided at a cost of Rs. 2,000 a work for which the pre-war esti mate had been Rs. 7,000. Medical .—^Assistant Surgeon R. Holmes has remained in charge throughout the year. ° The total number of cases treated during the year, compared with the previous year, were Dr. Holmes was awarded the Kaiser-i-Hind medal in the Birthday Honours to the great satisfaction of his many friends in Bahrain. His work has been invalu able, and the very large increase in outdoor patients and operations in 1931 is the best testimony to the efficiency with which he discharged his duties. The increase has mainly been among the Bahama women, a class that have hitherto not believed in hospitals, and who will not even visit the women’s hospital at the Mission. 34,243 outdoor patients and 317 indoor patients were treated at the men’s hospital of the American Mission during the year and 419 major and minor opera tions were performed. Dr. L. P. Dame remained in charge of this hospital through out the year, except for a period of three months when he proceeded on leave to the United States. The women’s hospital had 7,954 outdoor patients and 169 indoor patients as compared with 8,306 outdoor patients and 255 indoor patients treated during 1930. 61 major and minor operations were performed as against 125 for the preceding year. Dr. Tiffany held charge throughout the year except for a three months’ recess in India. Judicial .—The total number of civil suits instituted was 2,310 as compared with 1,957 in 1930 and the number of criminal suits 360 as compared with 360. The total number of petitions registered during the year was 2,705 and insolvency cases The extra clerk applied for last year has been sanctioned, and it has been possible to speed up the work of the vernacular office. Visits of Government Officials.— Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel H. V. Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, accompanied by Captain R. G. Alban’ Under Secretary, and Mr. Lasceiles of the Tehran legation arrived on the 3rd and left on the 5th February. Air Vice-Marshal E. Ludlow-Hewitt, Air Officer Commading, Iraq Command, arrived on the 26th February and left for Muscat the following day. . 0tlier visitors were the Shaikhs of Kuwait (two visits) and Dubai and Qatar. Shaikh Muhammad al Hurm of Gaobandi also paid a visit to Bahrain on his way to and from Hasa, amd asked the Political Agent if he could sell him any rifles. The request, needless to say, was refused. His Highness Prince Ahmad Tauhid, a grandson of His Imperial Majesty the late Sultan Abdul Aziz of Turkey accompanied by Jemal Pasha, a Syrian officer of the old Turkish army and now in the service of Bin Saud’ also paid a visit.

A disreputable Austrian named Mraz and his wife also paid Bahrain a visit with the intention of proceeding on the Haj overland. _ They were some four months late or eight months early for this, and their pretensions to being converts to Islam were not°taken seriously as the man seemed to know little of his new religion, and replied to queries that “ he did not hold with any particular sect, but Islam generally.” As they lived by begging, the Residency were asked to prevent such persons being given visas in future, and orders were issued to prevent a recurrence of such visits. A number of destitute Indian Hajjis also arrived and were repatri ated at considerable expense. On an average three requests for repatriation or monetary assistance, were received by the Political Agent daily, and it was impossible to help any save a fraction of the most distressing cases. Nejd .—Under the iron hand of Bin Sand, Hasa and Nejd produced little in the way of interest during the past year. Bin Jiluwi, the heavy handed governor of Hasa, appeared to have regained his former ability and overcame the effects of the stroke he suffered after hearing the news of his son Fahad’s death in battle the year before. He is a patriarchal governor of the old school and is held in whole some awe by the bedouin, and the Ojair-Hasa road was consequently safe through out the year. The excessive taxation coupled with the bad pearling season and poor date market ruined the Qatif oasis, and what little trade there was mostly went to Jubail, a port in which the Qusaibis are largely interested. This is of new creation and owes its rise to the Kuwait blockade but consists of little more than two rows of houses and a Customs house and small pier. Muhammad bin Suwaillim, the Amir of Qatif, who had shown himself to be thoroughly friendly to the Agency, was dismissed towards the close of the year, being finally succeeded by Abdul Rahman bin Khairullah. There was no recru descence of the Bahama trouble at Qatif and no persecution of genuine Bahrainis. The nationality problem is one that is much better left to solve itself locally and a modus vivendi has been found. There seems to be an extension of effendi-ism and bureaucratic control in Bin Sand’s eastern provinces, and Muhammad-al-Tawil, the omnipotent Customs Director of Hasa, has usurped much power formerly vested in the Amirs. A Diving Court has now been set up in Qatif modelled on the one at Bahrain, and if it is properly run it will be another benefit that Bahrain has enforced on its neigh bours, for the Qatar divers have demanded diving books and proper accounts on the fines of those their Bahrain brethren enjoy. Since almost everyone within two hundred miles must now come to Bahrain if he is to obtain a loan or finance himself, it will be seen that Bahrain is playing an increasing part in the economic life of the Persian Gulf, and such business is done on the terms of the Bahrain merchants. The question of waiving re-export dues for goods destined for Bin Sand was not raised again, put it is not believed that .the Nejd Government will rest content with t lie present situation, and they have already enquired the price of buoys, with a view to making Ras Tanura a port. They have failed so far to find water there, but there is nothing to prevent its being piped from 10 miles away. V ^J 1 1 ne exception oi the Amir of Qatif and a grudging recognition by Bin Jimvi, the policy of the Nejd officials seems to be to ignore the Agency, and none Cve± 'visit it icough they frequently come to Bahrain on business. Though fana ticism has diminished, the Christian is not persona grata in the Hasa, and a Nejdi iresn ircm his native wilds will avoid shaking the polluted hand of the Political Agent even m Shaikh Hamad’s majlis, or will extend two fingers like a duchess at a graden party. By the close had been fitted Company, of the year almost every town of importance in Neid and Hasa with wireless. The plants are supplied by the British MarconiThe Qusaibis .—The Political Agent stated last year that he did not concur in the view that Bin Sand was dispensing with the services of the Qusaibis, or that they were under eclipse. On the contrary their power has waxed rather than waned, and they have been steadily buying property throughout the year, despite very heavy losses in the bankruptcy of Habib Rosenthal. In fact one may say that they appear almost the only firm in Bahrain with any ready money left, though owed some £100,000 by Bin Saud. One frequently hears that this monarch will “ go bankrupt ”. This idea arises from applying the western rule of thumb to a person to whom it in no way applies, for if he is unable to pay his creditors, Bin Saud will simply retire to the interior leaving them disconsolate on his borders. The Qusaibis may have to wait a long time for their money, but there is little fear that he will repudiate his obligations to them. Before proceeding on recess the Political Agent warned Abdul Aziz Qusaibi against further acts of aggression such as those which had marked the last two summers, and none occurred. The relations of the Agency with the Qusaibis are officially most cordial, but they can hardly be ignorant of the fact that it is the only force that prevents them doing as they please in Bahrain. Qatar .—The Political Agent paid two visits to Qatar in the past year and was well received by Shaikh Abdulla bin Jasim. The Shaikh has little power over the more unruly of his kinsmen, and villages on the northern shores of the peninsula pay little attention to him. Relations were not improved when, at the close of the year the Political Agent was obliged to attach some pearls belonging to a relative who had been sued by two Persian merchants in the Agency Court. The Shaikh deals largely in pearls himself, but after denying indignantly that the Court had any right to touch them, once the case has been settled amicably and the pearls returned to Donah, he himself sent them to Bombay for sale to meet his own claims ! An act amounting to piracy and another in which a wrecked Persian dhow was looted occurred on the northern shores of Qatar, and neither had been settled satisfactorily at the close of the year. The Shaikh’s weakness in these quarters may be the cause of trouble in the future. The matter is being taken up by the Political Agent on his next visit to Dohah. Qatar has been much more severely affected by the depression than Bahrain, and the bulk of the inhabitants are on the verge of destitution. In fact slave owners are finding difficulty in feeding their property. Slavery .—Nineteen slaves were manumitted during the course of the year. The steps taken to prevent the traffic in women from Malabar appear to have been successful. One woman complained that she had been divorced and had nowdiere to go, but an Arab on the Agency verandah was struck by her charm and offered to marry her at once. The Agency, in a new role of match maker, warmly seconded the proposal, and the happy pair were sent to the Qadhi forthwith. The Malabaris present a difficulty in that scarcely anyone knows their language, and though the Agency with its present staff habitually conducts official business in five languages, or even six at a pinch, yet Malabari is an obstacle to be surmounted with difficulty. Climate —The year was unusually hot but the rainfall was much greater than usual being 5-1 inches. Heavy rain falling in February and every upstair room in the Agency leaked save one. The “ bareh ” was almost a complete failure and this raised the temperature in June. General.—For the first time in the last three years, the Staff of the Agency was sufficient for its bare needs, and the extra vernacular office clerk asked for was sanctioned in April. The work in the English office is now practically up to date, and the duration of cases in the vernacular office reduced from nearly two months to two weeks. In the latter an improved filing and registration system has been instituted, and if a party brings a card which is always given them it is possible to trace a case in a minute or two. Since the Agency Courts are expected to function in Arabic, Persian or Hindustani, a large staff is required than might be sufficient elsewhere. With the old staff the work of the English office was always hopelessly in arrears, the Trade Report being at one time over a year late. It is to be hoped theso delays will not recur. M0392FD54 0HIR^9BHMHbbbi It should be noted that Bahrain is a clearing ground for many departments and activities all of which add directly or indirectly to the work of the Agency. The payment of the Royal Air Force Rest House Staff and their general supervision, the payment of Upper Air Observers and pensioners, rupee payments and storage of Tosha khana for the Residency, and certain telegram accounts of His Majesty’s Ships are only some of the more recent additions to the clerical work, each small in itself but in the aggregate totalling a considerable amount of work not usually falling to Political Offices. Bahrain, formerly an out of the way pearling town, becomes every day more and more the centre of the Gulf, and the European population has doubled in the last three years. The year has been a quiet one, and generally satisfactory except for the dis astrous pearling situation. British prestige is high, and the inhabitants are still surprisingly grateful for the material benefits they enjoy as a result of British intervention in these islands. Long may they continue to feel this gratitude, for it is a quality that is the more welcome on account of its rarity. C. G. PRIOR, Political Agent, Bahrain.CHAPTER IX. Administration Report of the Kuwait Political Agency for the year 1931 • I.— Personnel. (a) Lieutenant-Colonel H. R. P. Dickson, C.I.E., held charge of the Political Agency throughout the year, except for the period 28th May to 11th September, when Assistant Surgeon A. L. Greenway, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., was in charge, the Political Agent having proceeded on leave to the United'Kingdom. iu W Assistant Surgeon A. L. Greenway, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., was in Medical charge of the Agency Charitable Dispensary, and performed the duties of Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. II.— The Puling Family. M Tlie R uler, His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah, K.C.I.E., P.fe.i., has managed his State during the year under review with consummate abi lity and success. He has maintained correct and friendly relations with his two powerful neigh- bours, the Kingdom of Iraq and the Kingdom of Hejaz—Nejd, lying to the North and South 0 f his territory, respectively, in spite of the unfriendly and disappointing I. 0 I° rmer in the matter of the “ A1 Subah ” date gardens, on the Shatt- al-Arab on the one hand and the continued blockade on the land side by the forces 0 His Majesty King Bin Sand, whose avowed object would still appear to be to ^orce Kuwait to acknowledge him as suzerain, by th e simple process of strangula- The closeness of this blockade coupled with the complete failure of the 1931 Kuwait Pearl Season, for the third year in succession, has reduced Kuwait to such a state of poverty and economic distress that it has required all the skill and patience 01 the Ruler to prevent the hot-headed members of his family from attempting retaliatory measures, m the form of intriguing with the Border Tribes, and his lead ing merchants from leaving Kuwait and transferring their business elsewhere. ., So wisely and tactfully has the Ruler dealt with the internal situation, and so widely have his relief measures and free distribution of food been appreciated by the poorer and more hungry elements in the Town, that his personal popularity as Ruler to-day stands higher perhaps than it has ever stood before. Shaikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir literally has, and is, playing the part of father to his people, and by regularly going about among them, and by adopting a frugal and unostentatious way of living, and by cutting down his own household expenses to a paltry Rs 1,500 a month, has set an example to all in the way they should meet their difficulties. In this matter of the blockade the Ruler has steadfastly placed his reliance on the promises made by His Majesty’s Government, during the “ Akhwan ” rebellion of 1929-30 against their liege lord His Majesty King Abdul Aziz as Baud, which were to the effect that m return for his, the Shaikh’s loyal co-operation, the British Government would do its utmost by diplomatic pressure or other means, to get the blockade raised. 6 . Tl1 ® Shaikh’s affection for everything British, and his faith in the word of His Majesty s Government still stands high, and it is earnestly to be hoped that 1932 will see his trust adequately rewarded, not only in the greater matter of the Block ade, but m the vexed question of the family properties on the Shatt-al-Arab in Iraq. (6) As is usual during the cold weather His Excellency and leading members ol „ hl * ±amil L i ndul ged m many hawking expeditions. Owing to the improved state of anairs in the hinterland following on the putting down of the Akhwan rebellion, such expeditions were able to go far into the interior during the early part of 1931 for instance on 5th January 1931 His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad reached Khabari Watha, and his cousin Shaikh Salman al Hamad al Subah reached Jarriya, 60 and 100 miles respectively inside Nejd territory. a A ^ 10 lR i er pleasing feature of 1931 was the general exodus during March and April, of the Shaikh and many members of the Al Subah family into camp. Their56 ladies went with them in every case, and camps were pitched as far afield as 50 miles from the Town and wherever good grazing was found. Such a thing had not happeneTfor the previous 9 years, and everything augured well for the future. (d) On 5th June His Excellency the Shaikh by the courtesy of the Royal Air Force flew to Bahrain in a flying boat (“ Rangoon ”) and after spending 5 days with His Excellency Shaikh Hamad al Khalifa, the Ruler of that State, returned to Kuwait on 10th June, again by air. (e) On 20th July His Excellency the Shaikh again paid a friendly visit to the neighbouring State of Bahrain proceeding in his newly built motor yacht. He returned on 11th August. (f) His Excellency fhe Shaikh, accompanied by the Political Agent and Mrs. Dickson visited the Pearl Banks 100 miles down the Hassa Coast, in his motor yacht on the 22nd September and returned on the 23rd September. M/hilst there, His Excellency fired the gun signifying the official closing of the Pearl Season “ Guflal ” and the whole fleet of some 300 sailing vessels proceeded back to Kuwait. It was an inspiring sight to see these vessels, each crammed with a black crew ' manoeuvring for position and finally crowding on all sail and racing home to Kuwait, offli pit d months soiourn on the banks. (a) On November 5th His Excellency the Shaikh completed a fine tennis court and pavilion in his garden at the back of the Town and invited the Political Agent to take it over for his own use, and the use of Naval Officers and other European visitors who visited his Town. Balls, rackets, net, etc., etc., were supplied in the first instance. As the Agency possesses neither garden nor tennis court the kindly feeling which prompted the Ruler to build the court for the use of the Political Agent and his guests was much appreciated. This act was only one of many that the Shaikh has done to show his friendship for the Political Agent and English men in general. Incidentally it may not be out of place to mention that the Shaikh also pre sented a plot of ground of some 4 acres, 2 years ago as a site for the new Political Agency Building but although funds were provided l| years ago, no move has been made by the Public Works Department authorities to start the building as yet. This has been a great disappointment to the writer, and has not done our prestige any good. III. —Relations with the Ruler. The relations between His Majesty’s Political Agent and the Ruler have continued to be of a most satisfactory nature throughout the year. It is doubtful whether they have ever been on a pleasanter or more friendly footing. The policy of the Political Agent has been, and is, to interfere as little as lie possibly can with the internal administration of the State, and in return the Ruler trusts him and consults him in most things especially in matters connected with his foreign relations. This, in the opinion of the writer, is as near the ideal as possible, for the Ruler is not only flattered and pleased to think that he is allowed to “ run his show ” without irritating interference from the Political Agent, but enables him successfully to combat the insidious suggestions of anti-British propagandists who are never tired of preaching and insinuating that Great Britain’s eventual aim is to get the Arab Rulers of the Gulf, and Arabia generally, completely under her control. Results are particularly happy in the matter of financial control, for the Political Agent beyond calling for a statement of annual Customs House imports and exports and their value, etc., for his trade report, leaves all matters connected with the Shaikh’s financial arrangements severely alone. IV.— Blockade. The autumn and winter of 1930-31 had seen some relaxation of the blockade, and it was hoped that perhaps Bin Saud was growing tired of the “ game ” in face of the outcry and dissatisfaction that his North-Eastern tribes and especially the cities of Qasim were showing at his policy. Actually the King would appear not to have modified his plans nor changed his mind in the least, but to have only been forced temporarily to allow his frontier tribes to purchase their immediate supplies in Kuwait, owing to the serious threat of a wide-spread famine. The tribes recently in rebellion against his authority, in particular the Mutair and Ajman had lost most of their live stock and camels,and were suffering greatly. They found it quite impossible to go for their supplies as far south as Hoffuf or Jubail, as the King would have liked them to do. They had therefore begged to be allowed to make one more journey to Kuwait to get in their autumn and winter supplies, and the King had granted their request. ^ In February 1931 however came the change. Ibn Saud ordered that the block ade should recommence with increased severity immediately after the Id, which would end the Haj season, and Nejd tribes were in the meanwhile forbidden to cross the Kuwait border. This time the tribes were warned that a new feature would be introduced in the shape of armed Ford Cars, which were to work between the well known line of wells lying 80 miles South of the Kuwait frontier, and which would scour the country side daily upto the Kuwait frontier in search of those breaking the order. In April 1931, lack of rain brought on a serious famine among the great Ataiba tribal confederation, and faced with the difficulty of grazing their camels in their own country, west of Qasim, several thousands of Ataiba made a mass movement North-Eastward and settled in the “ Summan ” or Mutair country 160 miles South- West of Kuwait. They were at once followed by a second mass migration on the part of Bani Abdillah, a tribe related to the Braih Section of the Mutair, though their actual homes were in the Hejaz. Bin Saud, taken by surprise, was faced to acquiesce, and though he did not like to admit it, was unable for a time to prevent or control several thousands of these starving tribesmen, who insisted on coming upto Kuwait and purchasing food. It did not take the King long to regain control however, and on 6th May came the news that the Amir Saud (the King’s son) from Riath ; Ibn Jaloui, the Governor of Hassa from Hoffuf ; and Ibn Musaad, Governor of Jebel Shammar from Hail, had each issued proclamations to the effect that no more Nejd tribesmen were to be allowed to go up to Kuwait or even to Iraq to buy food. In confirmation of this 4 armed motor cars appeared in the Kuwait Neutral Zone from Jubail on 7th May and informed the Amir Haif bin Hajraf in charge of the ^ Kuwait Fidawiyeh and Araibdar that no more Hassa tribes would be allowed to “ sabil ” (buy provisions) to Kuwait. The penalty for breaking this new order, was confiscation of all camels as well as loads, and imprisonment for the offenders. Immediately afterwards ibn Arfaj, Bin Sand’s frontier officer who had been away in Nejd, once more reappeared and took charge of operations. The blockade now took the most stringent form that it has yet done, for armed cars based on Jarriya, began to move up and down the Kuwait frontier from the South-West corner of the Kuwait Neutral Zone as far as Rigai in the Battin vallev, the most Westerly corner of Kuwait territory. Many small groups of Bedouin were captured returning from Kuwait with supplies, and these were made to suffer accordingly. On the 2nd August ibn Arfaj was recalled to Riath, and Abdur Rahman bin Muharib, his second in command, took charge of the blockade arrangements. This worthy in an excess of zeal now made the mistake of ordering 3 small raids inside Kuwait territory; the dates of these were 10th August, 12th August and 19th August. His intention was to catch the Nejd tribesmen coming out from Kuwait close to the Town and before they reached the border. These raids were duly reported to His Majesty’s Government and formed the subject of an official protest. On the 20th September, ibn Muharib in order to tighten up the blockade took advantage of the discontented Shaikh Jadaan al Suwait of the Dhafir, an Iraq tribe camped at Subaihiyeh on the Southern border of Kuwait, and persuaded him to throw in his lot with Bin Saud. As this chieftain had a considerable following with him, his assistance would be of great value, especially as ibn Muharib’s partols were not of sufficient strength to permit of his watching the whole frontier line simultaneously. On 26th September came the news that Jadaan as-Suwait had definitely thrown in his lot with Bin Saud and had joined Ajemi as-Suwait, ibn Thuahi and ibn Afran, other prominent Dhafir Shaikhs, who had already broken away from Iraq. Early in October ibn Muharib ordered the Dhafir Shaikhs to move from Subaihiyeh into the Garra region, a point South-West of and close up to the Kuwait MC392FDSouthern border, and at the efiorts had thYdS efieTand several parties of Mutair moving in twos and threes werf caught by Jadaan’s men running contraband, and were duly handed over to ibn Muharig for punishment. Unfortunately for ibn Muharib’s plans, Bin Sand’s tax gatherers suddenly appeared on the scene and started taking Zikat from the Dhafir Ths caused a panic and the rank and file began to melt away and disappear bac m » Iraq. Jadaan was thus left without any real following and so powerless. He himself got into the bad books of Bin Sand for allowing this dispersal of his men, and was called to Riath to make explanation. On 29th October ibn Muharib himself crossed the frontier line with an armed patrol, and for 5 days made an extensive and secret reconnaissance of all the routes converging into Kuwait Town. In spite of his hiding by day among the sand dunes which abound South-West of Kuwait, he was seen and recognized by several persons. The nearest point that he reached was Chadadiyeh 10 miles fiom the Town. This fresh incident was at once reported to His Majesty s Government by the Political Agent and direct to Bin Saud by Bin Sand’s trade Agent^ in Kuwait, who saw that the activities of ibn Muharib would rebound on his master s head, and he wished the latter to have an opportunity of denying responsibility before the complaint came. This had the desired effect and Bin Saud, following his usual methods withdrew ibn Muharib from the frontier and replaced him by Saad ibn Khramis (a negro). On 22nd December ibn Saud ordered ibn Kharamis to establish a blockade post of 18 men at Rigai, the South-Westerly corner of Kuwait State, and where it joins on to Iraq. This was the first occasion that such a post had been located there, and it effectively prevented tribal caravans however small from slipping into Kuwait from the South-West. About this time also came the news that Bin Saud had agreed as a sop to Jadaan al-Suwait to permit those Dhafir elements who had come over to Nejd and thrown in their lot with him, to obtain their supplies from the towns of Iraq along the Euphrates. Similarly fearing another mass movement, this time of his Nor thern Shammar tribes, into Iraq, he granted the latter the same concession, at the instance of ibn Musaad, his Governor of Hail. All other tribes of north-eastern Arabia had still to get their food from Jubail and Hoffuf, and at the end of the year under review this was still the order. The above events have been given in more or less chronological detail to show the varying steps taken to tighten up the blockade and prevent Nejd Tribesmen from trading with Kuwait. That Bin Sand’s policy was an unwise one, goes without saying, for in his efforts to divert Kuwait’s trade to his own ports in the south, he has successfully estranged his own tribal people, and still more the town population of Qasim. Actually of course Kuwait, though it would always welcome the regular move ments of Bin Sand’s tribes up to its borders, is mainly anxious to recover the heavy caravan traffic that used to ply between the port and the province of Qasim. This primarily is the trade which will bring recovery to her, not the supplying of the Bedouin with their petty needs of dates and rice. Kuwait today is in desperate plight and something must be done, otherwise she will be reduced to the size of Debai. V .—General and Local. (a) Customs, (i). It may be recalled that in June 1930, an incident which was fully dealt with in this Agency Administration report for that year, occurred which entailed the dismissal of Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif bin Abdul Jalil from the post of Director of Customs. At the instance of Khan Bahadur Mirza Mohamed, C.I.E., solicitor and agent to His Excellency the ex-Shaikh of Mohammerah, this official was arrested and convicted by His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait, for forgery, and suffered dis missal and disgrace.Owing to his long and faithful services under three separate Rulers, the Shaikh took a lenient view of his case and was content to let the man retire into obscurity. Actually the Ex-Oirector left Kuwait for the Hejaz on 3rd March 1930 and after spending nearly a year with His Majesty King Bin Saud, eventually found himself in Tehran where he was last heard of trying to enlist the sympathy and assistance of Shaikh Sir Khazaal Khan the Ex-Shaikh of Mohammerah. At the time of writing he is believed to be still there. After his departure further evidence was forthcom ing which proved that Abdul Latif was in the pay of His Majesty King Bin Saud and acted as one of his principal secret agents in Kuwait. (ii) The new Director of Customs one Yusuf bin Yacub, after a year and a half’s trial has shown himself to be a “ live ” man, and though possibly rather early to say so, has proved himself an efficient and keen worker. During the past year he inaugurated several far reaching improvements, and generally tightened up discipline. In particular he has brought the port “ Lighter ” service upto-date, and now-a-days sends out all Lighters in a formed body under the control of a single person. It is satisfactory to note that Lighters are no longer to be seen fighting to get near a steamer’s side before she had cast anchor, and generally Captains of ships report a marked change in the general management of the port. (m) From a “ Revenue ” point of view the year 1931 was again a disastrous one for the principality. Not only has the trade of Kuwait suffered like the rest of the world’s but she has once again been heavily hit by the failure of the 1931 Pearl trade, and the continued blockade of Nejd. (iv) According to a statement made by the Shaikh to the Political Agent the Customs receipts for 1931 fell for the first time below two lacs of rupees. This m marked contrast to the 8 and 9 lacs of Revenue which 10 years ago was the figure taken. (n) The 4% Import Duty needless to say provides the chief source of Kuwait’s revenue, though other revenues must be mentioned such as the tax on fishing traps, the tax on the Pearl catch of each boat, the Export tax of 2% on goods going out of the city by land, and the small export tax on hides and clarified butter going out by sea. (vi) The question of raising the Import dues to 5% was considered during the year but the Shaikh decided against the idea as it was considered politic to keep the tax on imports slightly lower than that existing at Bahrain, m order to attract some of the trade going to that port. (vii) In previous years a certain amount of contraband traffic has existed with Iraq, which assisted the local Customs receipts in a measure. During 1931 this largely ceased, owing to the increased watchfulness of the Iraq preventive service based on Zubair who instituted a system of car patrols on the Iraq side of the border. As this contraband trade was mostly with Iraq Bedouin, whose wants are very little, it is questionable whether the preventive service paid for itself. (b) Municipality.—As was fully reported in last year’s Administration report, 1930 saw the introduction of a “ Municipality ” in Kuwait. This desirable state of affairs was brought about by slow propaganda methods on the part of the Political Agent and the Shaikh, and eventually it was the people themselves who begged the Ruler to inroduce some sort of nrnchinery whereby the Town could become cleaner and healthier. As already mentioned in 1930, it was useless for the Political Agent to try and attempt any sudden reforms of himself, as experience has shown that among highly conservative communities such as exist at Kuwait attempts to bring about sudden changes usually rebound and hit the reformer, and are quickly seized upon by hostile elements, only too ready always with their accusations of British interference, etc., etc. The Political Agent therefore decided that by taking the matter quietly and educating the leaders, reforms would come of themselves. This policy has been amply justified by results, and today there is such a desire for improvements abroad, that if anything the people require checking. The Municipal improvements seen in Bahrain, have also made Kuwaitis some what envious, as have also those recently introduced in Basrah. And last but not least the advent of the motor car has perhaps had the greatest eff ect of all on the minds of the people, who now clamour for better roads and wide streets.60 Th P desire for Municipal progress lias not confined itself to Kuwait for during the war itlsinteresting l nSteW the people of Qatof m Bm Sand’s temtory, also petitioned for progress in the same direction. All this proves the contention, oft put forward by the writer, that the Arab can be got'to do most things by means of example, and careful propaganda but as soon as yon attempt to drive him, you come up against suspicion, hostility and a brick wall. In the writer’s view it is only a question of time for instance, when the wild townspeople of Dabai on the Trucial Coast will catch the fever for local reform and cleanliness, and then will automatically follow the desire for better communica tion with the outer world, and the present hostility to landing grounds for aero- planes, etc., will disappear, whilst a wireless station will be t e st modem irmnva +.1 rm hp, asked for. The year 1931 saw an almost unbelievable change in the cleanliness of the town of Kuwait, and last but not least the introduction of an Electric Light plant foreshadowed in my report for 1930 has become now an accomplished fact. On 8th December of 1931 the Ruler granted the necessary concession to a firm of Jews in Baghdad, and it is confidently hoped that the coming summer of 1932 will see it installed together with suitable Ice Plant sufficient to meet the needs of the people. The concession runs for 35 years. Among some of the improvements carried out during 1931, the following may be cited as examples :— (i) The completion of the new wide road with easy gradient from the Ruler’s Town Palace on the sea up into the main bazaar. Previously this portion was so narrow that 3 cars could not pass. Now 3 cars can move abreast, and the former excessively steep gradient has been turned into a comparatively gentle slope. (ii) . The water front for about 600 yards in the vicinity of the Agency, has been doubled in width, and dhow owners have been given a line beyond which they may not transgress, when drawing up their boats on the beach. (Hi). Many blind street corners in the Town have been rounded off where before they were right angular, and motor cars now negotiate them with ease and safety. The energetic Mudir al Belladiyeh (Municipal Secretary) Sulaiman al Absani is today regularly to be seen touring the city in his car, and inspecting the various Municipal gangs at work on improvements. This is a pleasant change from the old sleepy order of things. (c) Education .—There are a number of schools of a sort in Kuwait. The Arabs conduct at least 52. The Persians have 11, and the Jews and Christians one each, making a total of 65. Of the Arab schools 27 are for boys and 25 for girls. The schools are not under local Government control. Most of the boys’ schools and the Girls’ schools teach nothing but the reading of the Qoran and speaking generally no higher form of education is available in the town which in the writer s opinion is rather a blessing than otherwise, it being open to question whether progress in this direction does not breed discontent and unhappiness. There are three notable exceptions to the above, viz .'.— (a) The American Mission School. (b) The Mubarakiyeh School. (d) The Ahmadiyeh School. The first (u) gives by far.the best education in Kuwait, particularly as regards English, but it only accommodates 20 boys, It is under the direction of the Rev. J. DeJong. The second (b) was established as far back as 1912. A sum of Rs. 85,000 was collected by public subscription, of which Rs. 40,000 was used to provide thebuilding which has many large class rooms and verandahs. The balance has been kept as an endowment fund. It is run by a board of Trustees and its income,is derived from fees taken from pupils, who pay the small sum of Rs. 3 per mensem and from the endowment fund. There is a Headmaster and six assistant masters, and the pupils number about 250 boys. The curriculum includes the Qoran, Traditions, common law, ethics reading, composition and grammer, arithmetic, geography, history and English. It is thus far advanced from the usual “ Mulla ” school, but even so does not pretend to give more than a primary education. The third (c) was founded in the autumn of 1921 under the auspices of the Muslim Benevolent Association with the assistance of the present Ruler, after whom it is named. It has its own board of Trustees and derives its income from fees anddrom annual contributions from benevolent residents. It has 7 masters and 165 boys. Its curriculum follows that of the Mubarakiyeh school (b) but it is planned to turn it into a Secondary School if necessary money is forthcoming. There is fourth superior school an “ Orphanage ” for orphans and other poor boys. It is entirely supported by wealthy Pearl merchants. It has 6 masters and 165 boys. It teaches the usual Qoranic branches with a little history and arhitmetic. The Persian Schools which teach writing and arithmetic, in addition to the Qoran, are 3 in number. The remaining 8 others only teach the Qoran. The lack of a good higher education in the Town compels those who have ambitions for their boys, to send them abroad. At present the American College at Beyrout fills the necessary gap, but there are signs that Baghdad will take the place of the latter shortly. India is not popular with Arabs. And the future should be between Baghdad and England for the super ambitious. The youngest son of the late Shaikh Salim of Kuwait, Shaikh Fahad, as-Salim (by a negro mother) proceeded to Beyrout to attend the College in December 1930 and is still there. This latest recruit bring the number of students, from the Shaikhly house of Kuwait, who are studying at the Beyrout College to three. They being— [а) The two sons of the late Shaikh Salim as-Subah. (б) The youngest son but one of the present Ruler. {d) The Gandhi Campaign in India. —The activities of Congress, the Round Table Conference and the later surrender of Mr. Gandhi to the extremists, as evinced by the latest Civil Disobedience Campaign in India, have all been closely watched by the people of Kuwait who see in them many of the causes of their ruined Pearl Trade. While earlier attempts of the Government of India to meet the situation by concihatory measures, were looked upon as so much “ madnessand proved according to most Arabs, the complete inability of the English to understand the Eastern mind, the later and present strong policy is everywhere praised. The Arab who above all prides himself on being a virile and hard-headed man has not in the least been able to understand Englishmen dealing leniently with Law breakers. “ Put a Bin Sand in India, or any Arab Ruler for that matter, with the strength behind him which Great Britain possesses in India, and see what will happen ” is a common remark, and one made to the writer on several occasions. Another one runs as follows :—“ The common people must not be allowed to get out of hand, and talk big in any Eastern Country or else the inevitable will happen and the Ruler will get eaten up ”. The Arabs sympathies, certainly in Kuwait are of course on the side of the British, and they are never tired of saying that Muslim opinion will always side with the Administrators of Law and Order. The Qoranic precept that a good Muslim should “ obey God and the Ruler who he has put in authority over him ” is frequently quoted, as showing that Muslims in India must side with the autho rities. MC392FD s62 Unlike Bahrain few Hindus are wanted or allowed to reside in Kuwait. Only 12 Muslim Indians live here and they only with the approval of the Kuler. (e) Eastern and General Oil Syndicate y Ltd .—Major Frank Holmes who left Kuwait on 20th August 1930 after having been definitely and finally told by the Shaikh and the Political Agent that any company to whom an Oil Concession was given must be a British concern, again arrived from Europe on 16th April 1931, and commenced operations by paying the Shaikh Rs. 10,000 on 27th April, ostensibly as a gift from his firm to compensate him for their failure to find u water ” for the Town. Actual y it was piece of barefaced “ palm oil ” to prepare the way for future benefits to be received. This was. the second important present made by Major Holmes to the Shaikh the first having been the £l,000 Sunbeam car given in 1929. A yet third present was made at the end of the year under review, in the shape of a handsome “ Radio ” set, which so far no one has been able to work. Major Holmes who always seems to go out of his way to avoid contact with members of the Royal Navy, left for Basrah again on 17th May and returned on the 19th May his absence coinciding with the visit of the Senior Naval Officer on H. M. S. “ Triad”. He finally left for the United Kingdom on 4th July 1931 to get away from the Gulf summer. On 12th October he once again turned up and after visiting Falaikah Island in company with the Shaikh of Kuwait on 3rd November, left for Bahrain on 8th November by S. S. “ Baroda ”, and at the moment of writing is still there. 5 Major Holmes gave out the usual story about his visit to Falika Island, namely that he hoped to find water for the poor inhabitants residing there. (/) Loat Building Trade. —The local boat building trade was not quite so pros perous during the year under review as during 1930. Some 25 large pearling &lt; lows of the sambuq ” class were laid down and completed, and possibly another 30 smaller fishing craft, locally termed “ Shu’ai ”. ' ~ Depressed trade conditions accounted for the above state pf affairs The a^emarkable^drop 00t ' Sambuq ” fel1 Rs ‘ 4 ’ 000 to approximately Rs. 2,500 On the other hand there was increased activity in the building of motor boats ^wa;i S t)Tfhe 0 1ist 0 ant t ZX. in r0Ugh WeatWnd P earl ^ f]howOmiL Xf' - +7^ y ear ’ lP' s Excellency the Shaikh had a large motor f Tsd !vlh n 1111 * 1? a desigl ; of his own makin g- This fitted with Xce on Ot? mX h P ' th ry crof t en § ine - The la ' n ^ this craft took holiday and thnn&lt;T anni p nlu &lt; : h rejoicing.

M. S. Folkestone anchored in the harbour, and the Political Agent held the usual official reception. His Excellency the Shaikh again in December of 1931 officially intimated that the English New Y ear, should in future also be looked upon as a public holiday, but that shops would not be closed. # The above two incidents which were entirely spontaneous, show the growing anxiety of the Shaikh to prove to the world and his people his connection with Great Britain. No doubt the coming “ independence ” of Iraq and the feeling that Kuwait is to become even more isolated than formerly, and is incapable of resisting the aggression of two strong land neighbours alone, had someting to do with the decision. (h) Foreign Trade. — {i) The sale of Russian Matches and Piece Goods appeared at the end of the year to be greatly on the increase: The former which bear the picture on the face of 2 crossed Union Jacks, and a suitable superscription in English were sold at the truly remarkable price of 16 boxes for one anna. They were very popular naturally. {ii) Russian Piece Goodes were equally cheap, and the quality was nearly always superior to the Japanese article of the same kind. {Hi) Italian Rugs of the Scotch plaid variety began to arrive in large quantities in the autumn just before winter set in. A good thick one cost only Rs. 10. The rugs sold like “ hot cakes ”. {iv) Japanese Articles maintained their popularity and their prices compared favourably with those of Soviet manufacture, while shoes with crepe rubber soles and heels sold at the amazing price of Rs. 2-8-0. VI .—Foreign Interests. (а) In January 1931 a curious agitation was started against the American Missionary community in Kuwait, and might have had unfortunate results, had not the Ruler squashed the movement with firm hand. Apparently an outpatient of the Hospital and a member of the “ Shabiba ” or “ youths ’ Party ” in Kuwait, a newly formed group which imbibes the Political views of some of the Iraq extremists, took the trouble to listen to a Religious address given by one of the Mission s Arab teachers to the Hospital patients. Then apparently of malice afore thought, he promptly went to his club and told all and sundry that the Americans were preaching against Islam and Mohomed the Prophet. A mopster petition was immediately presented to the Ruler demanding instant action on his part. The latter took the matter quietly, and asked for a specific accusation to be made, and for witnesses to be produced. Neither were forthcoming and the alarmed conspirator fled and took refuge in the house of one Haji Shimlan (a prominent Pearl merchant). The latter assisted by several not ables of the Town went to the Shaikh and interceded for the youth. The end of it all was that the Ruler issued a very stern warning to the “ Shabiba ” to refrain from matters that did not concern them, and pardoned the originator of the trouble, saying that he would have no mercy at all, the next occasion such false and malici ous accusations were made. The matter died a natural death. (б) A Pole by name M. Bodan Zictarski and a German American named Carl Raswan, well known as a horse fancier in California, visited Kuwait, on 31st January. The former knew neither English nor Arabic ; but the latter spoke both well. Their avowed object was to buy high class Arab yearlings and they hoped to be allowed to go into Nejd. This they were told they could not do unless they had Bin Sand’s permission. They stayed with the Political x4.gent for 2 days and then returned to Iraq. Mr. Raswan incidentally stated that he was the joint author of the well- known book on the Arabian Horse by Mr. Brown of New York, though he spoke the reverse of flatteringly about the latter. (c) On 3rd February instructions were received from the Hon’ble the Political Resident to welcome and show round the Japanese Minister accredited to Persia who was travelling up the gulf by S. S. “ Bandra ”. As the ship hurried her depar^ ture somewhat unnecessarily, there was no time to take the Minister ashore,64 {d) Mr. Alexander Sloan, United States Consul-General at Baghdad visited Kuwait from Iraq travelling overland from Basrah by car on 26th February. He was the guest of the American community. He called on the Political Agent on 27th February and dined at the Agency. On 28th lie was taken for a motor car trip along the coast South of Kuwait for a distance of 30 miles. He left again on 29th February. (e) On 26th March one Herr George Kraz and his wife Freeda Kraz, both Austrian Citizens referred to in the Sind Police Gazette of 20th March 1931, arrived disguised as Arabs from Bahrain by motor launch. Their disguise was easily seen through and both were sent to the Agency by the Ruler for enquiring into their antecedents. Herr Kraz explained that he was a Muslim, a doubtful statement, and desired to go overland to Mecca for the Haj. His Ex cellency the Shaikh allowed him to remain 5 days to look round the Town and then asked him to leave through the Political Agent. Both left for Basrah on 31st March. During his visit Herr Kraz was reported by a member of the American Mission to have spoken bitterly against the British in the Bazaars and conversely to have lauded up to the skys the Soviet and German Governments. He apj eared to have little money and begged the Shaikh and others for funds to assist him on his journey. He spoke Turkish well. (/) A Rumanian theatrical artist called Leonida Greenberg with his wife and a lady called Larisa Besronkoya arrived from Basrah on 28th April, without pre vious permission having been asked of the Political Agent if they could come. The latter requested them to return the same day. Apparently their period of “ Sejour ” in Iraq had expired, and Kuwait became a convenient city outside the frontier from which to again seek entry into Iraq. To get rid of them the Political Agent, had no course but to endorse their passports for Iraq once more. (g) Shaikh Mohomed al Isa al Khaifa of Bahrain arrived from Basrah on 15th August and sailed for Bahrain on 16th August. (h) Seyed Mohomed Khairi ibn Khair Halabi of Syria, Nationalist Editor and owner of the “ Wafa al Arab ” newspaper of Damascus arrived at Kuwait on 16th August. He left again for Bahrain on 30th August. He apparently desired to collect funds for Nationalistic purposes in Syria, but got no “ change ” out of the Ruler. (f) A certain Doctor Reasoner, a rather down at heel but extremely clever Amencan Dentist, who had been carrying on a precarious business in Kuwait for some 4 years, left Kuwait for Basrah on 3rd November. Certain friends there had promised him regular work under the Port Directorate if he would transfer his business there. At the last moment it was found that he owed the Shaikh a considerable sum of money, both on account of a personal loan, and for rental due on the house he nad occupied for 4 years. iT? R ^ r “famed h™ that he could not leave the Town till he liquidated the debt. This latter came to Rs^ 1,110. After considerable negotiation in which Dr. Reasoner received moral and financial support from the American Mission and Major Holmes, the Anglo-American Oil Concession hunter, the matter was compounded, and the Shaikh agreed to let Dr. Reasoner go. The case presented several awkward reatures, chief of which was the official request made bv the American Mission that the Political Agency should take up the cudgels on behalf f i,? r 'A ReaSOIler Wll0 ! n ttey consl dered was being unjustly treated 'bv the Ruler while Amercian prestige and that of a “ white man ” were also at stake. The Political Agent went to considerable trouble to convince them that under the Kuwait Order m Council of 1925 Part I paragraph 8, he could not inter fere in the case of an American Citizen, as the United Stnte^f . asked that the interests of her nationals should be iookl Tv ffis MaiAs^s Government. Even though this course was suo-frestorl • n s Majesty s dad in 1921 by the then Political Agent WaSSUg S ested to thelr Consul in Bagh- saw atTulelTtTasT^ and ^officially —Ml, ™ i. “CIS,(j) On 1st December 2 junior members of the Royal House of Hejaz and Isejd, Dahad bm Turki al Saud and his brother Athaar appeared in Kuwait accom panied by five tribesmen of the al Murrah, and after staying 2 days informed the Ruler that they were returning to their uncle the Ruler of Hassa, Abdullah bin Jaloui. W hen one day out of Kuwait, it seems that they doubled on their tracks and made for Zubair and Rasrah. A regular flutter was caused in the local dovecots of Hejaz, Bagdad, etc., as it became evident that the youths had from the first been refugees, trying to escape and reach Iraq. Bin Saud’s Trade Agent Al Nafisi sent immediate warnings to ibn Jaloui and His Majesty King Bin Saud that the youths had gone North and a good deal of rather unnecessary telegraphing resulted. In the end the young men were returned by His Majesty King Faisal of Iraq to Kuwait, and were sent back under escort to their uncle in Hoffuf. From a conver sation which the writer had with the runaways, it was obvious that Fahad the elder was somewhat weak in the head. VII.— Locusts. For the 3rd year in succession Kuwait was visited by the locusts. Large flights of these insects appeared over the State on 25th March, and on 28th, 29th and 30th March, dense clouds of these pests appeared over the Town of Kuwait flying North. From news previously received from Nejd in February, it was anti cipated that locusts would reach the Kuwait frontier by the end of March but it was not thought by those who know the ways of these insects, that the dreaded “ Dibba ” or newly hatched locusts in the crawler stage, would follow after the locusts themselves, as the parent locusts had arrived and laid their eggs too late in the season to allow of their offspring surviving the torrid heat of the sun after hatching. These prophesies unfortunately were incorrect for on the 19th April the dreaded u Dibba ” made their appearance simultaneously in different parts of the State and mostly to the South of it, and according to the strange ways of these insects whose instinct almost invariably causes them to move in a Northerly direc tion when they hatch, they began to march North towards the Bay of Kuwait. On 30th April some of them reached the outskirts of the Town and at once began to devour the vegetable gardens lying on the Southern suburbs. On 7th May the vanguard was reinforced by the main army consist ing of billions more of the crawlers, and the moving green and black mass surged over the walls of the city, much as molten larva progresses down hill from a volcano, and invaded the whole Town from its eastern to its western end. Besides devouring all the kitchen gardens lying inside the walls and doing heavy damage to the shops in the bazaars the beasts invaded the innermost privacy of private houses in ever increasing and loathsome swarms. For a full 10 days the inhabitants bore with the dreadful plague, and by 17th the situation became intolerable, and day and night was one long nightmare. One’s food, clothes, bedclothes and even furniture were attacked by the starving and voracious insects. As in the case of the plagues of Egypt, relief came in the shape of a mighty wind which blew for 15 hours from the North-East. The Dibbas were driven out of the Town in a westerly direction and along the Southern shore of the bay. Countless millions of the insects must have been drowned in the sea, but the plague was removed and Kuwait breathed Once more. The Dibbas did not appear again, but it was sad to see the damage done over the country side where the scanty grazing which lies to the immediate South of Kuwait, was all devoured for miles round about. Fortunate it was that the original flights of locusts which settled and laid the eggs which produced the above plague, arrived too late, and no doubt only a comparatively small proportion of the eggs laid actually hatched. There is no doubt that countless numbers of newly hatched insects must have been killed by the hot sun and what one actually saw, were only a fraction of what might have been. VIII .—Pearl Season. As a result of the slump m the pearl trade generally, there was a shortage of money among the owners of the pearling boats, when the season once more came round. Combining together therefore they decided on giving reduced advances MC392FD4 'aM 66 to the divers’ families in 1931. Much discontent and grumbling resulted among divers and haulers. This reached such a pass that the all crews refused to go to sea on the 15th May “ The Rekba ”, when boats should have put out of Kuwait. The owners maintained that they could not afford to grant the divers the customary advance, while the divers refused to move unless their families were reasonably provided for. Shaikh Abdullah al Jabir the President of the Municipality was deputed by the Ruler to enquire into the men’s grievances and after consulting the leading Pearl merchants issued the following orders with the consent of the Ruler, which were intended to afford the desired relief— (a) All diving crews who had done well on the banks the previous season’ should be granted “ Salaf ” and “ Tisgani ”, i.e., an advance and their last year’s share of gain at the rate of Rs. 55 per diver and Rs. 45 per hauler. (5) Other diving crews who had not brought in any profits the previous year would be granted only Rs. 40 and 30 respectively. (c) Should anyone disobey the ruling or fail to accept it, he would receive punishment. The above settlement was received with much ill feeling and resentment, and a crisis was only staved off by His Excellency the Shaikh ordering the ringleaders of the movement to be flogged and cast into prison. On 25th May some 130 boats were got away to the banks, and on the 30th May approximately another 120 followed. Subsequently a further 100 boats joined the first lot making a total of about 350, a big drop on the normal 500 craft that are engaged in the trade. The Pearling fleet returned on 22nd September “ Guffal ” when the Ruler, himself accompanied by the Political Agent went to the banks, and gave the signal for closing of the season. The actual catch for the year was an average one only, and little “ sale ” business followed the return of the fleet. There was practically no demand at all as far as the best pearls were concerned, but faulty pearls and those of the seed variety were got rid of in India for a slightly higher price than that prevailing in 1930. I he depressed condition of the market nahurally brought much hardship in its train, and among the poorer section of the population distress and poverty followed. Among those Bedouin elements as opposed to Townsmen who were immediately dependent on the prosperity of the Town, and who usually provide 30 per cent, of the divers, the conditions were worse than the writer has ever known them before, A few literally died of starvation, and with the general lowering of stamina all round tuberculosis to which the tribal man is particularly susceptible, made great inroa s carrying off many. The Political Agent was able to do something towards the alleviation of the general misery, and personally disbursed some Rs. 300 worth ° f , n “ t0 pyyff d .! re The Ruler also did what he could.

(c) The similar extremely tight control maintained by the frontier officers of His Majesty King Bin Saud, who during the year also introduced armed motor cars for patrol purposes. (d) The calling in by Bin Saud of all Nejd Government rifles issued to the Awazim in 1929. (e) The practical disarming of the Mutair and Ajman tribes in 1929-30. Speaking generally however, one may say that the momentous change of policy adopted by His Majesty King Bin Saud, towards Kuwait during 1930 and 1931 was chiefly responsible for this better state of affairs. For whereas prior to 1930, his policy had been to bring continuous pressure, and to hurt Kuwait by deliberately authorizing and encouraging the many hot heads, among his North -Eastern tribes to raid deep into Kuwait territory, looting and pillaging whomsoever they would, he the “ master ”, always denying responsibility, he had since the spring of 1930 (following the collapse of the Akhwan rebellion) altered his methods entirely, probably due to his desire not to strain the patience of His Majesty’s Government too mu^h. These new methods have taken the form of a passive but greatly tightened up blockade, combined with a general order for bidding his frontier tribes to cross the border or commit any acts of aggression on pam of condign punishment. Such order was not difficult of enforcement, for ot themselves the most warlike tribes the Ajman and Mutair, would probably not raid to-day even if ordered to, seeing that the punishment inflicted on them in 1929 and 1930 by Bin Sand, and especially the incarceration of their beloved Shaikhs Fiasal-al-Duwish and ibn Hathlain in Riath, had been so severe, that what affection and loyalty they had for him, had been entirely replaced by a feeling of hatred and distrust. More than this they would have transferred their allegiance entirely to their old liege lord of Kuwait, were it not for their whole some fear of Bill Saud. Nor could they give any outward expression to these new born feelings owing to the host of spies who live amongst them and the strong forces which both control them, and keep the blockade going. The following incidents were dealt with during the year under review :— (a) On 8th April 1931, some Juareen tribesmen (Iraq tribe) operating from Baniya North-West of Safwan in Iraq territory, raided a small caravan of Harb tribesmen (Nejd subjects) at Haliaba in the North- West corner of Kuwait territory, as it was returning from Zubair. Two of the Harb were killed. The Iraq frontier Police pursued the raider, arrested 8 of them and exacted due punishment. (b) On 6th May 1931 a party of 5 Mutair tribesmen secretly conveying supplies from Kuwait, were attacked by a small party of “ Mashaala ” tribesmen (Iraq shepherds) near Manaqish. One Mutairi was shot dead and his rifle taken. The Kuwait authorities took immediate action and clapped a prominent leader of the tribe into jail wdio happened to be in Kuwait, and so were able to recover the rifle and u Idia ”, blood money, for the relatives of the oead man. (c) On 26th July 1931, a party of Nejd Mutair (Braih Section) came into Kuwait and complained that the Dhafir under Jedaan-al-Suwait camped at Subaihiyeh, had stolen 8 of the camels, as they were secretly coming to Kuwait to purchase supplies. This was about the period when Ibn Muharib, Bin Saud Blockade official, was trying to get the Dhafir co-operate in the blockade. The Dhafir Shaikhs denied the charge, whereupon the agrieved Mutairis lay up for some Dhafiris who were leaving Kuwait, and on 29th July fell upon and carried off 2 Dhafir men, a woman and 4 camels all loaded with provisions. Near the frontier they released the captives hoping to get away with the camels and booty. Luck was against68 0* them, and while still inside Kuwait territory they were met by a party of Dhafir from Subaihiyeh who recovered all the camels and goods and killed one of the Mutairis. No action was taken in the matter by the Kuwait authorities, as immediately afterwards Jadaan-al-Suwait and his Dhafir^ at Subaihiyeh, trans ferred their allegiance to Bin Saud and left Kuwait to assist in the blockade from across the border. (d) Whilst the Political Agent was absent on leave three small raids into Kuwait territory, and carried out by a war party of Bin Baud’s own Fidawi, took place on the 10th, 12th and 19th August. In the first some servants of Shaikh Salman-al-Hamud al-Subah cousin of the Ruler were attacked 17 miles from Kuwait as they were taking supplies to their master camped on the Southern border of Kuwait. The raiders were beaten off. In the second case a party of Kuwaiti tribesmen was held up at Kebd 15 miles South-West of Kuwait, but raiders were again driven off discomfited. In the 3rd case a Nejdi domiciled in Kuwait was attacked near Shaiba on the coast, 20 miles South of the City, and relieved of £T 60 and badly beaten. Fie followed the party to Jarriya and complained to Ibn Muharib, but got no change. These three raids formed the subject of an official complaint by His Majesty’s Government, as well as a personal complaint by His Excellency the Ruler direct to Bin Saud. The latter eventually and as a result of the frontier incidents referred to in the next para graph removed Ibn Muharib from his post and disgraced him. (e) On 29th October 1931, Ibn Muharib himself with an armed patrol and for 5 days made an extensive and secret reconnaisance of all routes converging on to Kuwait town. In spite of hiding himself by day among the sand dunes which abound to the South and. South-West of Kuwait, he was seen and recognized. His operations took place within 10 miles of Kuwait. The Ruler could easily have captured the party by means of his car patrols but refrained, lest the party should offer resistance and blood be shed. He contented himself by reporting the incident to Bin Saud and His Majesty’s Govern ment. (/) the 9th November 1931, two escaped slaves from the Mutair country (Nejd) crossed the border bringing with them 4 camels. The owners followed bringing letter from Bin Baud’s frontier official demanding that the slaves be returned. The Ruler refused to surrender the runaways, but handed back the 4 camels. To prevent the later kidnapping of the slaves the Ruler after freeing them, took them into his own house. X .—Relation with Nejd. In spite of the greater severity of the blockade during 1931 and the apparently unchanged intention of His Majesty Bin oaud to rum Kuwait, by continuing to pre\ ent all ^ caravan communication with the interior, as well as by the strict banning of Kuwait to all his North-Eastern tribesmen, personal relations between the two Rulers, would seem to have improved rather than become worse. This is attributed to the recent and more clever policy of the Kino - who as mentioned in an earlier portion of this report, prefers to-day to appear outwardly more amenable and friendly, while conducting a still tighter blockade than formerly protesting all the time that he is forced to adopt these measures, not rom hostile motives to a friendly and neighbouring country, but because economic necessity and a desire to improve his Hassa ports, compels him to divert the trade °f n'N W i A hlS countr y tp the P°rts of Jubail, Qatif and Ojair. The picture 'In “ d T e f pl l 1S ° Ver th , e ruin o£ Kuwait ’ the ad °Pted country of his youth, whilst deliberately trying to destroy it, is the picture presented to us in 1931. Arab chivalry and politeness have of course compelled the Ruler of Kuwait to appear insensible to the true policy of the Great King. Throughout the yearmost friendly letters have continued to pass between tlib two Rulers and gifts in the shape of Hawkr, etc., have been the order of the day, though it must be admitted these came mos ly from the weaker Ruler to the stronger !! Bin Saud on the other hand sent two pressing invitations to the Shaikh of Kuwait to accompany him to the Haj from Riath, protesting that the 1931 Haj would fail miserably if Shaikh Ahmad did not attend! No doubt he had an eye to the Rs. 60,000 that the latter would Lave been compelled to spend in Mecca. In spite of the tragic comedy of events one must admit that relations have improved, and that the situation during 1931 was far preferable to the open war of 1929 and previous years. XL —Relations with Iraq, These have remained officially excellent during 1931 and would continue to be so, were it not for the unfortunate impression created by the efforts of the latter to tax the Shaikh of Kuwait’s 5 properties on the Shatt-al-Arab, a question which has assumed the dimensions of a major problem for His Majesty’s Government. The latter in 1914 gave a promise in writing to the Rulers of Kuwait that their Iraq properties would be for all time exempt from all Revenue demands, as a regard for having thrown in their lot with the allies in the Great War. Iraq’s contention, and one the reverse of grateful for all that Great Britain has done for her, in the past, is that His Majesty’s Government had no right to sign away any of her Revenue rights. Kuwait’s contention is and remains that His Majesty’s Government should abide by their word, and either pay the Revenue herself if she so sees fit to solve the problem, or definitely tell Iraq “ to go to the proverbial Devil ”, The former course in the opinion of the writer would seem to be the only proper solution. In the meantime, Iraq’s determination to be stubborn has undoubtedly done much to make Kuwait distrust and fear her, and at the moment of writing the -coming recognition of Iraq as an Independent State, is causing anxiety. XII .—Political Agent’s tours. During the year under review the Political Agent went again all over the State by car, visiting practically every important point on the Kuwait-Nejd frontier. In addition a comprehensive tour was made along the whole Southern frontier of the Kuwait Neutral Zone. The main object of the Political Agent in making these tours was to show himself to the tribes, and to familiarize himself with the hinterland, the various wells, caravan routes, grazing areas, and fines of annual migrations of the Kuwait and bordering tribes. Among the principal journeys made were the following :— On 9th January the Political Agent visited Qasr Subiyeh, on the North shore of the bay of Kuwait opposite Bubiyan Island via the wells of Mudaira, Babra, Mughatti and Mughaira. The return journey being made by the Um Rimmam, Kraa-al-Maru and Mutlaa, route. The main object of the tour was to examine surface oil springs reported on the North-side of the Bay. On 10th January the Political Agent visited Ras-al-Ardh Lighthouse on inspection duty. On 14th January the Political Agent visited Araifjan via the A1 Dhahar ridge returning via the Qusur villages. On this journey the Political Agent was accompanied by His Majesty’s Consul of Basrah. On the 24th February the Political Agent accompanied by His Excel lency the Ruler proceeded to Wafra Ark and Shattaf in Kuwait Neutral zone. He reached the South-West corner of the neutral area in the vicinity of MC392FD TT70 Abairish. Th.e return journey was made along the Shaq depression and home via Manaqish. The particular object of this trip was :— (a) To visit the Kuwait tribes camped on the Southern border of the neutral zone, and to see how they were mixing with the Nejd tribes lying along side of them. (b) To locate the Southernmost point of migration of the Iraq Shepherd tribes. (c) To examine the exact spot where three Nejdi merchants, were murdered on 8th December 1930 and which threatened complications with Bin Saud. On the 20th March the Political Agent went into camp at Araifjan on the Southern border of the State, and returned on the 25th March. He again went into camp on 28th March and returned on 2nd April. On the 22nd September the Political Agent accompanied by the Ruler visited Pearl Banks by launch, 100 miles to the South of Kuwait and returned on 23rd September. On 20th October the Political Agent proceeded to Basrah to escort the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf from Shaibah to Kuwait. The latter accompanied by his family arrived by air from the United Kingdom on 22nd. On 15th November the Political Agent proceeded to Um-Amarat al-Shaqq near the South-Westerly border of the State via Manaqish and returned by a more Northerly route the same day. His object was to watch the movements of Ibn Muharib, Bin Saud’s frontier official, who was reported prowling about with a war party inside Kuwait territory. Incidentally he visited the camping grounds of the Kuwait tribes. On 27th November the Political Agent proceeded to Qasr Abid 35 miles to the South to examine another reported “ Oil ” seapage on the sea shore there. On the way he lunched with Shaikh Subah an-Nasir al Subah at Ras Jalaiyah. On 6th December the Political ^ gent visited Arfajiyeh to enquire into the activities of Nejd blockade parties. He returned by coastal route. XIII.—Posfc and Telegraphs. (a) The Ivuwait-Iraq Motor Transport Company which started operations m 1928 maintained a satisfactory service throughout the year, and mails which the Company contracts to convey were conveyed fairly regularly to and from Basrah, connecting yith the Overland Mail from Europe, the Fast B. I. Mail from India, and the various Air Mails. (b) The Transport service maintained one between Basrah aqd Kuwait per week. othciai mail service each way (c) By sea, Kuwait was served by -the weekly up slow B. I. Mail steamer irom India and the biweekly steamer from Basrah,. ('!) The actual Post and Telegraph Office in Kuwait continues to be maintain ed and run by the Government of Iraq, though the coming admission of that country into the League of Nations, as an Independent Nation, has made the continuance of this arrangement highly undesirable. Negotiations have therefore been progressingwith His Majesty’s Government with a view to the Office to the Government of India, and for a British « j SS twhv ^ b ® S6t “ P 111 Kuwalt &gt; m place of the present land line. It is regretted that this important matter was not settled in 1931 and that Brftkh tT ^ifr dra ??? g . ? n -, a stran g e anomaly Iraq took over the Butish Telegraph line which joined Basrah to Kuwait, when the Post and Tele- graph Administration m Iraq was made over to Iraq Government.

Trade depression failure of the Pearl trade, etc., denuded the town of a great deal of money thereby causing distress, insufficiency of food and the necessaries of life and other means to combat illnesses Many persons who would otherwise have been well atng Infants Xed tost. ^ ^ Were nnrl f? Tu j )ercillo ® ls ’ tlle usual ^ toll taker ” had a greater sway than previously and there does not seem to be any real hope of combating this scourge for many reasons, chief of which are the habits, customs and mode of living of the poor any attempts to change which would be at present futile. 1 ’ (c) Infantile diseases.—Infants and small children suffer very much and during the year under review, 1931, were even deprived of the slender chances they possessed owing to lack of food and clothing. Some died of sheer want among the very poor, while disease carried off others more rapidly than would nor- mally be the case. Infant welfare and Hygiene are an almost closed book to the mothers. The vast majority are ignorant and do not seem to care nor interest themselves in matters concerning the welfare of their children. . W Com mon diseases were those of the eyes, ears, bowels and skin and here agam there is no aimumtion m the numbers or spread of these diseases owing to the absolute lack of personal hygiene and manner of living, combined with extreme casualness in the treatment of these complaints. 2. Samtation.—The Municipahty have been so anxious to show results in own improvements such as road widening and repairing, etc., that their efforts in other directions have not been so good as might have been expected. Greater energy m hygiene matters might have been tried.

The annual meeting which is held every year at one of the Persian Gulf Ports, took place at Kuwait between 10th and 30th of November. At the conclusion of the meeting the various persons who had come up for it left for their respective stations. (li) Dr. C. S. G. Mylrea, O.B.E., left for Basrah on 19th November and returned on 20th November. (i) On 13th December the youngest child of the Reverend DeJong died sudden ly from the effects of pneumonia. As the local Christian Cemetery was quite an unfit place in its existing state to take a burial, the parents decided to convey the body to Basrah by car for inter ment. The Political Agent made all necessary arrangements with the Iraq authorities through His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Basrah, and the body was got across the frontier with a minimum of trouble and formality, (j) The fanatical agitation raised against the Mission early in the year has been dealt with under Head Foreign Interests. (Paragraph VI). XVI.— Quarantine. {a) Though no epidemic of any kind occurred in Kuwait during 1931 there was a severe outbreak of cholera in epidemic form in the neighbouring country of Iraq, principally in the town of Basrah. Three cases were reported in Basrah on 28th July from the S,S. “ Kohistan ” of which two died. No further cases occurred till the night of 7th August, but from then onwards the epidemic raged with great severity till the 10th November. (b) Kuwait being in communication by land and sea with Iraq and being the gateway to Eastern and Central Arabia, quarantine restrictions were immediately introduced^and rigidly enforced as a protection not only to the Principality and town of Kuwait but to prevent the infection being carried into Arabia, where dire results would have been inevitable. (c) Communication with Iraq by land is by motor cars, and as many of the in habitants of this town visit Basrah on business, and as the epidemic occurred during the height of the date season, cars were running to and for daily. Such passen gers had to be inspected, their inoculation certificates seen through, and vigorous measures adopted to keep the town from becoming infected through them. Some times as many as 4 carloads of passengers had to be examined at once and as the Quarantine Station is situated a mile outside the town wall, this necessitated frequent visit by the Quarantine Medical Officer in the height of the summer with the temperature reading 117°F. (d) In addition the sea route held further possibilities of an infection being brought into the town, as steamers, launches and dhows constantly ply between the two ports. The Quarantine Medical Officer inspected and imposed restrictions on all steamers, launches and dhows arriving from Basrah, and when one realizes how man} sailing vessels put into Kuwait in a day, one can guess the immense amount of work that falls to the lot of a conscientious Quarantine Medical Officer if a town like Kuwait to be kept free from a disease of the nature of cholera. ( e ) ^ writer has no hesitation in saying that if the Quarantine Medical Officer had not carried out his duties as rigidly and conscientiously as he did, the disease would certainly have found its way into the town, and would inevitably have spread into the interior with considerable loss of life. (/) Cholera is almost always endemic in Iraq and an epidemic very often breaks out m various forms of intensity during the summer months of each year- this isa standing menace to contiguous places like Kuwait, and one does not care to thinkwhat the results would be had this town no Quarantine Medical Officer to impose necessary restrictions and guard against the spread of such a dread disease. XVII .—Royal Navy. The following ships of the Royal Navy visited Kuwait during 1931 :— H. M. S. “ Folkestone ” from 10th April to 13th April. H. M. S. “Triad” ^ Hastings ( ’ T from 17th May to 21st May. i’O from 2nd June to 4th June, from 10th August to 12th August, from 17th September to 21st September, from 25th October to 26th October, from 10th December to 13th December. “ Penzance “ Folkestone “ Folkestone ” “ Hastings ” “ Penzance ” “ Triad” “ Emerald ” A ote- The lights and Buoys Ship “ Nearchus ” paid 5 visits during the year. XVffl .—Royal Air Force. On 9th January 3 Wapitis arrived from Shaibah and returned the same day. On 28th January 3 Wapitis arrived under the Command of Squadron Leader HardstafE Commanding 84 Squadron, Shaibah and returned the same day. The flight acted as escort “to Group Captain C. D. Breeze, who was on tour of inspection of Royal Air Force Stores in the Gulf. Flight Lieutenant Howes (Royal Air Force) Special Service Officer, Basrah, arrived by car on 29th January. He was the guest of Miss Van Pelt of the Ameri can Mission during his stay. On 14th May 3 Wapitis arrived from Shaibah and after discussing repairs to the Aerodrome returned the same day. On 5th June one “ Rangoon ” flying boat arrived at Kuwait and conveyed His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait to Bahrain the same day. It returned again on 9th June. ° On 21st December 3 Wapitis arrived from Shaibah to inspect the Kuwait Land ing Arrangements and returned the same day. XIX. — Shipping. Ninety seven British, two German and one Norwegian Vessels visited the Port during the year. The British India Steam Navigation Company^ ships of the slow gulf service called at Kuwait weekly on their way North to Basrah, and fortnightly on their way South. b J XX. — Exchange. {a) The rates of exchange during the year 1931 for the Maria Theresa Dollar averaged Rs. 72-8-0 per 100 Dollars. ^ It was highest in December with Rs. 81-10-0 and lowest in April with Rs. (6) British Sovereigns and Turkish pounds averaged Rs. 13-14-0 and Rs. 12-1-0 respectively. The “ Saudi ” Rial as introduced by His Majesty King Bin Saud, was not accepted at all m Kuwait as a means of exchange. Its value being practically nil, no one would touch the money. Hence the coinage is not brought into Kuwait. XXI.— Meteorological. (a) As was anticipated in the Administrative Report of this Agency for 1930 the Kuwait spring of 1931 started very badly and everything promised a complete lailure of the “ Hay ” crop in the interior.74 (b) Upto the llth February the rainfall for 1931 had been only 12 , an&lt; ^he {O) uptu me x J Hr, n+li nnrl 12 th February however, Kuwait had outlook appeared grave indeed. On 11th and l^tn | ^rua v r ’ • t d a phenomenal 25 hours of unceasing fine ram, and a fall of 2 85 was registered. (c) As the houses in Kuwait are nearly all built of plain sun-dried mud bricks, covered with a facing of lime, the driving and continuous ram very soon caused walls to dissolve and collapse. t Over 120 houses fell in the town, and Kuwait when the ram finally ceased had the appearance of having been visited by an earthquake Much misery resulted and a rough calculation put the damage done at 4 lacs of rupees. The Political Agency and the houses of his stafi also suffered seriously, all being built of unburnt brick in the prevailing fashion. During the storm numbers of people took refuge on dhows fearing the collapse of their houses. The rain though disastrous for the town was a God-send to the country around, and brought much needed relief to the tribes and shepherds for they were able at last to get the grazing they so badly required, as well as the subsequent Hay crop. (d) The summer of 1931 was again abnormally hot. In the latter half of May the maximum temperature stood at the daily average of 112 k. with a minimum of 80°F. During the months of June , July, August and the first 15 days of Septem ber the average maximum daily temperature was 117°F. and the minimum 82°F. A highest maximum of 118°F. was registered in the latter half of July. The above temperatures were taken close to the sea shore ; away from the sea front and in the hinterland far higher temperatures could have been recorded. (e) As is usually the case in Kuwait, September ushered in a sudden change of temperatures, the 16th September showing a drop in the maximum to 105 k. accom panied by a South-East wind from up the gulf of great humidity. This gentle wind which at nights was accompanied by very heavy dew, continued to the end of October when there was a further drop in both day and night temperatures, (/) The 1st November ushered in the cold season proper with a highest maxi mum day temperature of 81°F. and lowest minimum day temperature of 52°F. (g) The month of November was a cold month, much more so than usual. On the 8th and 9th of November the cold was so great in the desert that everywhere full water skins froze solid during the night and remained frozen till 10 a.m. the next day. From the 24th to 30th December an intense cold wave passed over North- East Arabia. The temperature dropped to 32^. in the town of Kuwait, and to well below freezing point in the hinterland. A piercing cold gale blew from the North throughout the week and reports everywhere showed arctic conditions. The cold snap caused much suffering among the poor of Kuwait as a famine in firewood took place. Three persons died of exposure. On 28th December slight snow fell over Kuwait for 10 minutes. (h) Upto the 31st December 1931 Kuwait had a total of 3-86' of rain, or 5' below the average. When one considers that the major portion of this fell in the spring of 1931 and only •42' in the autumn o f the year, one cannot blame the tribes if they are anxious as to the future. XXII.— Visits.

Letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 839-S. of 1933, dated the 10th July 1933. this Residency for the year 1932 \1 REVIEW. Obituary .—The death of Sir Hugh Biscoe on board H. M. S. “ Bideford *’ near Henjam $&gt;n the 19th July deprived those who served under him, and were associated with him, of a personal friend, and the Persian Gulf of a Political Resident who worked unceasingly towards the advancement of its varied interests. Arab side .—On the Arab side the most important features of the year have been the establishment of the Civil Air Route, the growth of Oil Interests, and widespread economic depression. Aviation .—As regards the Air Route, for the establishment of which Sir Hugh Biscoe had laboured so strenuously, and so successfully, an agreement for the establishment of an Air Port was concluded with the Shaikh of Shargah on the 22nd July. The necessary air facilities had previously been obtained at Bahrain and at Gwadur—an enclave in British Baluchistan belonging to the Sultan of Muscat. Royal Air Force Flying Boats continued to patrol the coast during the year, and occasional flights of land machines were also made. The Air Route besides being the Civil Route to India, is also the strategical one. In fact, the Persian Gulf is now “ The Suez Canal of the Air ”. Oil Interests .—In Kuwait rival interests—British and American—repre sented by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, and the Eastern and General Syndicate, Limited, respectively, have been striving to secure an oil concession from the Shaikh. Neither had succeeded by the end of the year. In Bahrain the Bahrain Petroleum Company continued to drill actively, and before the close of the year had definitely struck oil. In Qatar the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, secured in August the sole and exclusive right for a period of two years to carry out geological explora tion in the -Shaikh’s territory. Kuwait .—Besides the question of the oil concession already alluded to, Bin Sand’s Blockade, which permitted no trade to cross the frontier of Sa’udi Arabia, either into, or from Kuwait territory, was the chief matter of interest. At the close of ihe year in spite of various efforts to have the blockade relaxed it con tinued unabated. Various avenues were explored with a view to solving the problem of the Shaikh’s date gardens in ’Iraq, in connection with which His Majesty’s Govern ment had in 1914 promised the Ruler perpetual immunity from taxation in return for aid against the Turkish forces, but which the ’Iraq Government had now commenced to tax. A further complication arose by certain claimants bringing suits, one of which was successful, in the ’Iraq Courts challenging the Shaikh’s rights to certain of his gardens. In addition to immunity from taxation His Majesty’s Government had likewise guaranteed the Ruler possession of his property. No solution to the date garden problem had been found by the end of the year. Bahrain .—Besides the development of the Air Route and of Oil Interests a feature of the year was the threatened loss of the important transit trade of Bahrain. Firstly .—The Sa’udi Government is endeavouring to construct a new port at Ras Tanura where shipment of goods can be made direct both by steamer and dhow. Secondly .—In 1920 the Bahrain Government granted a concession to Bin Saud by which goods intended for Nejd, transhipped at Bahrain, paid only a small transit duty of two per cent. In addition the further concession was granted that goods transhipped from steamer to dhow in Bahrain waters would be exempt from the payment of any duty whatever. No advantage, however, was, until lately, taken of the latter concession. Now, however, the Sa’udi Government have shown signs of taking advantage of it. The question of reaching an amicable and mutually satisfactory agreement between the Bahrain and Sa’udi Governments on this matter was under consi deration at the end of the year. . * . _ Lc338FDMwsrarf.—Stringent measures l considerable improvement m the State s nnances a j surplus. The prestige of the State was raised by the submission m March under iwL 0 gm^ Kd^TheThi^ establishment of a Customs post at Sur, as a sign of the |^te s su . C s fort at Aiqa, a suburb of Sur, would be bombarded by His ^esty s h oops,, and his fort at Ja’alan 50 miles away in the interior, would be bombed by aircraft After flights by Royal Air Force Flymg Boats had taken P^ce o'W Ja’alan and warning pamphlets had been dropped, All bin Abdulla submitted. A satisfactory result was thus brought about without a shot being Hied. The importance of the incident lay in the fact that other recalc. ran Chiefs elsewhere in Muscat territory were watching events at Sur, and—if Ah bin Abdulla had not been taken to task-might in their turn have endeavoured to separate themselves from the Muscat Government, when the wholesale disintegration of .Qmfo rnio-ht well have commenced. Trade (both sides of the Gulf).—The trade on the Arab side is dealt with fully in the Trade Beports from the Agencies for the year m question. Trade on the Persian side as far as Bushire is concerned is dealt with in Section 8 of Chapter I of this Report. As far as South Persia generally is concerned, the Trade Reports for the year from the various Consular posts furnish detailed information. The general economic depression due to extraneous causes was accentuated bv the Government restrictions on trade, monopolies and control of exchange, and the famine conditions which prevailed in the South owing to the general failure of the rains during the winter of 1931-32. Fenian tide of the Gulf.—On the Persian side of the Gulf, the Persian Government continued with some success its work of disarming the tribes, separating them from their hereditary leaders, and increasing its control over them. Security in the South was good in the early months of the year, but the prevalence of famine conditions led to an increase later in brigandage. , Persian Navy. —The arrival of the Persian Navy in October and the anti- smuggling activities it engaged in did not lead to any incidents during the year, as these activities were confined to the Persian coast. Relations with local Persian Authorities. —Relations with the Governor of Bushire and Persian Gulf Ports—Mirza Ali Ashgar Khan Taliqani—continued to be most cordial throughout the year, and considerable assistance—official and demi-official—was received from him in the solution of various local problems.

French Consulate.— Mon&amp;imr Georges Cassin (Consul) held charge throughout the year. He recessed at Shiraz during the summer months. During the year he made several visits to India and also toured the Gull 1 orts. Dutch Consulate .—Monsieur G. Cassin, French Consul, held charge. Norwenian Vice-Consulate.—Charge of this office was held by H. B. M.’s Consul-General at Bushire. U. S. S. R. Consulate .—The building remained in occupation by the Russian Bank and Trading Company officials. The Soviet Consul-General stayed there on his visits from Shiraz in February. In January and following the Perso-Soviet Trade Agreement, the “ Sharq ” Company disappeared and the “ Venishtorg ” appeared in its place. There were about 25 men and 5 women (and 5 children) housed in the Consulate building. All appeared to work in the Trade and (when it was inaugurated in the Spring) in the Bank. The Bank was opened with a great flourish of trumpets and the offer of 3 to 4 per cent, interest on current accounts. As the Russians had the monopoly of trade a number of merchants perforce opened accounts, but very soon realized the emptiness of the Bank as a Bank. Since then Persian merchants have revolted against Russian methods of business and have created a virtual and effective ‘ boycott \ This action has of course inspiration from the Persian Government i B.—Visitors. Mr. Lacy Baggallay, Secretary to H. M.’s Legation at Tehran, who had accompanied the Honourable the Political Resident on his winter tour of the Persian Gulf, returned to Tehran by air on the 8th January.

S. S. R. Legation (M. Jaque Einhorn), accompaiued by the Russian Consul-General from Shiraz and a M. Ivan Schotsf of the Trade Organization were in Bushire from the 1st to the 4th December. €.•—British Interests. In 1931 the Persian authorities complained that at certain of the Imperial and International Communications Company (late Indo-European Telegraph Department) stations British flags were being flown. After lengthy correspond ence it became apparent that the Persians were averse to the flying by foreigners of their national flags except on limited occasions and in certain positions* The Persian Government also insisted that Consulates should not have flags flying from flagstaff's which were affixed to the ground but only from poles above the Consular buildings themselves. At the end of 1931 it was thought that the matter had died a natural death, but iu February 1932 orders were received to the effect that flagstaffs planted in the ground must not be used after the 22nd February. In accordance with instructions from H. M.’s Legation, Tehran, these orders were complied with, but until the change-over to roof poles was effected on the 24th no flag was flown. The main mast of the Bushire (Town) Residency flagstaff was left in situ to carry the beacon (red and white lights) which is used by steamers entering the inner anchorage. The topmast (75.feet in length) was removed bodily. This flagstaff had been a landmark for over 100 years. Flagstaffs at the Imperial and International Communications Company stations at Bushire, Henjam, Jask, and Charbar, were dismantled. Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited .—Bushire responded very half heartedly to the orders issued by Tehran that there should he general rejoicings at the cancellation by the Persian Government of the D’Arcy Concession. Only on the night of the 3rd December were a few shops decorated and illuminated. In November the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, withdrew from Lavar (Khu i Mund) where they had drilled to 3,600 feet. The existence of oil had been discovered at an earlier stage. They moved to Qishm Island where exploratory drilling was to be recommenced. The Imperial and International Communications, Limited (the old Indo- European Telegraph Department) continued their excellent service of submarine and wireless telegraphy. Messrs. Zieglers continued their Branch in Bushire, though sadly affected by the fall in the export and import business in Persia. Only by drastic reduc tions of staff have they resisted disaster, but the future of this old established Manchester firm is gloomy. • The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Limited (Mespers) relied solely on their British India Steam Navigation Company Agency work as they also had no other business. The Imperial Bank of Persia continued to hold the confidence of the mer chants and investing public in spite of the rivalry of the Persian Government National Bank (staffed by German Managers) and the Soviet Bank. The latter was merely a Bank in name. All its funds were kept in the strong-rooms of the National Bank. British Navy .—The Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, Captain L. G. E. Crabbe, D.S.O., R.N., in H.M.S. “ Triad ” and H.M. Sloops— “ Fowey “ Shoreham ”, and “ Bideford'—visited Bushire on various occasions during the year. Thanks to the sympathetic action by the Governor no petty obstructions were offered by the Customs and Police. An obstructive Quarantine Medical Officer who had occasioned the Navy some trouble at Henjam was transferred in September. SECTION 3. Local Government. Gov com or of the Gulf Ports. Islands Dashti and Dashtistan .—His Excellency Aqa Mirza Ali Ashgar Khan T’aliqani continued as Governor during the whole year and showed himself to be a sympathetic, friendly, and obliging official. - He Lc338FD4 speaks English in addition to French and Russian, haying served for some years in both Paris and Berlin. Taliqani endeavours to get the local Persian Depart ments to work together harmoniously and avoids partisanship. During this year of complete crop failure and water shortage he made genuine endeavours to alleviate the appalling distress of the sufferers and eventuallv succeeded in overcoming the apathy of the ( entral authorities at Tehran to the extent that the importation of vdieat and fodder from abioad was freed from the impossible Trade Monopoly restrictions. As Governor he made two tours, one in March as far south as Task (his jurisdiction extends to a point between .Task and Charbar) visiting Bandar Abbas Minah, Qishm, Henjam, Lingah, and the Shibkuh area. He flew by Dutch machine to Jask and returned by Imperial Airways from Lingah. The second tour was made between the 5th and 10th May and covered the northern area up to Hindi an. He also visited Kharag Island during September, being accompanied by the Officer Commanding Troops and the Chief Quarantine Medical Officer. ant Governor. —Aqa Mohamed Zand continued as Assistant Governor during the year and as in 1931 was chiefly employed on behalf of the Governor as President of the Bushire Municipality. Customs Department. —Mirza Habibullah Khan Behruzi, Provincial Director, was a most delightful official, always charming and genuinely as obliging as his involved regulations permitted. He endeavoured to eradicate some of the malpractices amongst his subordinates and succeeded to such an extent that certain of those affected reported against him anonymously to Tehran and, in the inimitable Persian way, he himself (!) was accused of malpractices. This indignity and injustice seriously affected his health wdiich broke down and necessitated his leaving Bushire on the 23rd June on medical certificate. He handed over charge to Monsieur L. B. Vandenrydt, wdio had arrived in December 1931 as Special Inspector. • Monsieur Vandenrydt, a full-bearded Belgian Douanier, arrived determined to defeat the smugglers wdio thrived along the sparcely guarded coast line, and especially between Bushire-Bandar Abbas. He announced that his solution to contrabandage was the removal of the cause for smuggling by the Persian Gov ernment providing the tribesmen and smugglers wdth the necessities of life ! He submitted lengthy schemes to Tehran, but by the end of the year he had begun to realize that service under Persia was a peculiar and thankless task, especially after he had been refused a permit to import foodstuffs for his owm consumption. M. Vandenrydt made no inspection of his area during the year. After the arrival of the six Persian vessels from Italv, his three preventive steamers and eight motor dhows were taken over by the Persian Marine Depart ment. He was therefore left wdth neither vessels nor personnel wdth which to stop smuggling. He perforce turned his attention to the improvement of the Bushire Customs yard and buildings and occupied himself with the re-laying of the customs trolley lines. Mivza Lutf-Ullah Khan, Doulat Shahi, took over from Monsieur Vandenrydt is Provincial Director on the 17th October. He appears to be a pleasant man and no complaints have been heard as yet. Heallh and Quarantine .Following the Shah’s visit and the report of Inspector General Couloper the Bushire Hospital began to give free treatment and also actually to admit patierrts and treat them. , l nJ' 1 ° r 7 he i in V 0t i 0U made by the General, Coulogner, in May a number of poor and out-patients were forced into the hitherto unoccupied beds.

Water liad to be imported from Mohammerah and Bombay and the whole peninsula had do diaw di inking 'watci fiom the ^ells at Bahmani (adjacent to the Imperial and International Communications Company’s enclosure at Reshire) and seven miles from Bushire town. Wheat and barley prices soared until the Municipality controlled the price and Bhoosa (wheat straw) was unobtainable. After months of hard work and over a thousand telegrams to Tehran the Governor succeeded in getting permission for the free-of-trade-monopolv importa tion of cereals into the Gulf Ports. Wheat from Kermanshah and grants-in-aid did not reach Bushire till October. Advances of seed-grain were made to the peasantry who had been for manv months destitute and entirely dependent on the Bushire Municipality for food and lodging. . 011 Christmas eve the long-awaited rain fell and Jdie prospects of a crop during the coming spring were satisfactory. Chamber of Commerce .—There was a Persian Chamber of Commerce con sisting of nine members. During the year they confined their small activities to routine matters, such as the settling of disputes between merchants and the dis- t ribution of sugar and matches. SECTION 4. Military and Marine. General .—-Bushire maintains training establishments for the training- of (1) Conscripts for the Regular Army, and (2) Recruits for the Amniveh (Road Guard) Department. Large and excellent barracks were found at Bahmani (adjacent to the Telegraphs) in buildings once used by the British military army of occupation. ' ' ~ Recruitment.—A Recruitment office was opened in January, and others followed during the year. Each successive Recruiting Officer re-called and re examined the youths exempted from service, and naturally re-exemption entailed a further donation by the candidate. Owing to bad health and other reasons about sixty per cent, of the local youths of military age were exempted. Persian Navy and Marine.—On the 29th October Bushire Town welcomed the arrival of the Persian Navy consisting of :— Two Sloops of 950 tons .. Babr (Tiger). Palang (Panther). Four coastal patrol boats of 320 tons .. .. Chahbaaz (Falcon). Chahrokh (Condor). Karkas (Vulture). Simorgh (Phoenix). The vessels had made an eventful, if slow, journey from Italy without calline- at Aden or Muscat as had been anticipated. They reached Bushire in timn fm- the arrival of H. I. M. the Shah on the 3rd November. The Italian Naval officers and personnel were bitterly disappointed with Persia as they had been told that they would find a wonderful country flowiim with milk and honey, with wine and its attendant delights, far better than they had ever found in Italy. Their first port of call was Charbar, thence by Bandar Abbas to Bushire and, later with II. I. M. the Shah, they proceeded to Moham merah, where they anchored in the sweet waters of the Kanin River to find themselves dependent on the kindness of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for material comforts, such as foodstuffs and drink. 1 c ' The vessels have made periodical visits up and down the Persian side ilm Gulf both singly and in flotilla. tile Soon after the arrival of the fleet all the Customs (Preventive) vessels (motor and steam) were transferred to the Naval Department with headquarters at Mohammerah. 1 Smugglers complain that their trade is somewhat affected by these changesmmrm ’nmumrnmmmmm 6 Disarmament of Tribes .—The collection of arms was continued but with no great success. Smugglers are the real users of arms, but as under a recent order a smuggler or robber found in possession of arms can be shot at sight or if captured alive executed few persons are ever caught with arms in hand. During the past three vears village and tribal headmen have been beaten and otherwise forced to report or produce~ hidden arms—thus very few arms are left in the area. SECTION 5. Imperial Airways, Limited .—The original three years’ concession ended on the 31st March, but was at the last moment extended for six months till the 1st October 1932. During these six months serious examination of the Arab coast was made and by the end of September all was in readiness for the service to fly by Kuwait, Bahrain, Shargah, and Gwadur (on Baluchistan side). After the 25th September no Imperial Airways’ machine used the Persian route. The wireless and other equipment was evacuated and re-erected where needed in the Arabian stations. Dutch .—The K. L. M. service functioned throughout the year with clock work regularity. After 1st October 1932 each machine required a special permit to land in Persia, and considerable delays occurred in consequence. Their organization, execution, and machines, were all excellent. French .—The Air Orient (Paris-Saigon) flew fortnightly until March when a weekly both-ways service was started. German .—On the 26th March the last Junkers’ plane left Bushire for Tehran. From the beginning of the year the weekly service to | from Tehran had been of real importance. The closing down of this service followed the refusal of the Persian Government to make good their running losses in Persia at a time when . the parent Company (in Germany) got into financial difficulty. This short-sighted action deprived Persia of an efficient and economic air service, the like of which she will have difficulty in replacing. SECTION 6. Political Situation. bitshire Hinterland .—The drought and famine terribly affected the nomadic n -os which lost nearly all their animals and also many men, women, and children. ’ ’ Grazing grounds in the Shiraz area were unable to receive them in addition o t le local tribes. ^ Some 1,000 persons from Dashti, Dashtistan, Tangistan, and llayat JJaud came into Bushire, where they were assisted from funds raised from tlie well-to-do merchants. ™ wor T a coast r ? a&lt; ? from Bll shire to Lingah (Busbire-Chaghadak- C a i J-a k-Zn aiat-Larar and through Dashti) was started in June. In effect a road was alligned and was traversed by motor car to beyond Lavar bv August. I unds were “ exhausted ” at the end of the year and the workers struck in con- sequence when the road had passed Kabgan. The sons of Shaikh Hassain of Chah Kutah who had rebelled against the hulrVl^h^bJV ^ Wer n wM arrested and sent to Tehran in Department 1 d d a lease - h &lt;&gt;lder off property leased from the Bevemie With distressing- regularity each month showed attacks on motor vehicles proceeding up and down the Bushire-Shiraz road. Some _ 15 Ananiy eh road guards and passengers were killed and a number wounded during the year. Kmea ana a nmrun During the famine highwaymen candidly warned drivers of lorries that tlu-v should carry foodstuffs but no Amniyeh guards. They would then be safe enough as the food would be removed and no other harm come to themfihibkuh Area .—Shaikh Mohamed bin Ahmed Khalfan who returned to Persia from Arabia in November 1931 renewed his resistance to the Central authorities. He occupied Shiyu in January. He made Teben in the Shibkuh area his stronghold and withstood all attacks. In May he visited the Arab coast but was not cordially received by the Rulers there. Accompanied by some 200 followers he returned to Persia and occupied Asalu in June. At the end of the year he was still resisting Persian attacks though he announced his willingness to come to terms and pay up arrears of revenue provided the large sums expended by him as douceurs to the Persian military authorities were offset in the calcula tions. Persian Mekran (Jask and Charbar ).—In February 1932 Mir Barkat Khan,, a Chief of the Bashkard district, who had been arrested by the Persians, was, brought to Bushire en route for Tehran. His brother Mustapha Khan thereupon decided to harass all Persian Baluchis who had assisted the Persian Government against Mir Barkat. Together with his sons he had several not very successful encounters with the Government troops. In May they were forced to the Arab side, only his sons returning to Persia in June to continue their attacks on tribesmen friendly to the Persian Government forces. In July, after combining with Abdul Hussain of Remiskh, another rebel, they attacked and looted the village of Old Jask and besieged the small Persian garrison there. The next day they retreated in order before the arrival of Persian reinforcements. Mustapha Khan eventually agreed to give up some old and useless rifles, his sons having crossed to the Arab coast in the autumn. Abdul Hussain of Remiskh continued to harass his following numbered 600-700 in September when he installed himself at Mehan and announced his intention of leaving Persia shoilld the Persian Government continue to trouble him.

H. GASTREDL, Captain, Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. SECTION 8. Trade axd Trade I’agilities. It was generally believed at the end of 1931 that conditions were as bad as they could be but 1932 speedily dispelled any hopes of an early revival in trade arid merchants resigned themselves to the continued depression which, throughout the year, showed no sign of improvement. The almost monthly variations in the customs surcharge and the continual amendment of laws and regulations reduced customs officers and merchants alike to such a state of com plete bewilderment that it would indeed have been surprising had trade not come to a standstill. Trade restrictions, monopolies, exchange control, high customs tariffs, road arid other taxes have combined to make legitimate trading almost impossible, with the result that attempts to develop healthy trade have been practically abandoned in the struggle for existence and in the effort to find the most profitable form of evasion. The natural outcome of the restrictions and pro hibitions has been the development of a flourishing and profitable illicit trade which neither the new Persian Navy nor the Customs Preventive Department is at present capable of suppressing. Generally speaking it is understood that the control posts along the coast have their price and so long as they find it Lc338FB8 I I more profitable to keep out of the way the smugglers risks aie reduced to a minimum. The smugglers are, however, experiencing difficulty in establishing friendly relations with the Navy and in the meantime additional care is being exercised. The trade monopoly law of 25th February 1031, which, with its effect on the trade of the country, was fully dealt with in the last Administration Report, has reduced the country to a pitiable state from which progress is not promising. 'The scheme is undoubtedly workable but only as a cumoei some and tieak ex periment which could hardly hope ever to prove a panacea for the grave economic illness with which the country is afflicted. A.n export system, which encourages the disposal of the count i\ s produce at a loss and depends on the sale of export certificates for its profit can only increase the burden on the people. The importer is obviously compelled to add the price of the export certificate (which he has purchased m order to obtain permission to import), to the cost of the goods he imports.^ In these circum stances the trade of the country is as gloomy in prospect as in retrospect. Owing to the tightness of money and the consequent inability of merchants to take up documents, large stocks of goods accumulated in the customs sheds, which have been practically full throughout the year. The cost of import per mits, increased customs dues and road tax added to the cost, c. i. f. Bushire, of foreign-made products so enhance the price at which they must be sold that the people who formerly purchased them are now unable to_ afford them. In view of the retrenchment which the general and prolonged crisis has imposed on all classes it is doubtful if these goods could now be disposed of even at their former price. Terms of business. —The general terms at present offered to Persian merch ants by foreign suppliers are not indicative of much confidence. A percentage, up to twenty-five, is required with the order and the balance is payable against shipping documents in Bushire. In very few exceptional cases are documents released against acceptance of bills at sixty or ninety days but there is probably no merchant in Bushire to whom such terms would at present be justifiable. It is, however, customary for Bushire merchants to despatch goods to the inferior against bills drawn on the consignees bn arranged terms, varying between thirty and one hundred and fifty days after sight of the goods, the terms being dependent on the nature of marketability of the merchandize. Banks—There are three banks in Bushire. The Imperial Bank of Persia, the National Bank and the Russian Bank. The National Bank is reported to have had a successful year and to have extended its business to the detriment of the Imperial Bank. The Persian public is said to be recovering from the fear of governmental scrutiny of accounts kept at the National Bank although it cannot escape from the belief that its funds may be applied at any time to finance Government projects. In order to attract business the Russian Bank, which was opened in April, ottered 1 pei cent, interest on current accounts, 3 per cent, on deposit accounts V 1 . &lt; f a ‘p : me y ear ’ an( i 5 per cent, on deposits for three vears. It was further intimated that only merchants with current accounts at the Bank would be allowed to do business with the Russian Trading Company. A number of the smaller merchants opened nominal accounts but only one or two of the more to^the tiaifi ^ commitments, were induced to transfer funds «prv-ubmrncn a firms i s more an indication of the con- to be livino- nri' pnVJf 8 ] °|. business as merchants are said di .

The mishandling* and undernavment of the labourers gave rise to much discontent and was the occasion for T mass protest to His Excellency the Governor. Work has since been discontinued and it is said that the rains have done much towards the obliteration of the results achieved. Bushire-Ahwaz via Gunowch .—The road as far as Ganoweh is not main tained at all and is now a mere track and the ferry established by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company at Rudhilleh has also fallen into disuse. The route now taken is via Angali and Hayat Hand where a ferry was established by a local merchant who had undertaken a post contract for the carriage of mails by mechanical transport between Bushire and Ahwaz. Unfortunately lack of support killed this enterprise and the ferry is rapidly deteriorating. Security of the Roads .—While it is probably safe to say that the general security of the roads was somewhat better than during recent years the customary crop of holds-up occurred during the tribal migratory periods and a band of outlawed Chahkutahi tribesmen, who are still at liberty, made sporadic raids on passing traffic. Air Lines .—Owing to the failure of the Persian Government to agree to acceptable terms, Imperial Airways transferred the route for the United King dom—India service from the Persian to the Arab Coast during the year. The postal airmail service run by the Junkers Company between Bushire and Tehran also met with difficulties and was suspended. The Dutch Line {K. L. M.) which carries mails and passengers between Holland and Batavia maintained a weekly service and their planes continued throughout the year to land, both outward and homeward, at Bushire. As with the French Air Orient, it is understood that from April they were merely granted single flight permits to fly over Persia. Anglo-Persian Oil Company—After drilling to a depth of 3,600 feet and discovering evidence of the existence of oil at an earlier age the Anglo-Persian Oil Company withdrew from Lavar (Kuh-i-Mund) in November. The cancellation of the D’Arcy Concession had no repercussions in this area. Exports and Imports .—In the absence of statistics or precise information regarding the destination of exports or the countries of origin of imports it is not possible to make other than general observations. _ Carpets .—The supply of new carpets was considerably diminished by the grain and water famine which played havoc with the flocks, although the shortage was offset to some extent by personal sales made from sheer necessity by impoverished individuals. The export trade has practically ceased and there is neAvs of enforced sales by banks both in England and the United States of America to recoA^er advances made by them to Persian merchants against shipping documents. One dealer in New York is known to have dropped about 5,00,000 American Dollars as the result of price-reductions. &lt; There can be little hope of improved markets for these articles of luxury until more prosperous times return and until foreign tariffs are lowered. Opium .—-The inability of the monopoly to find a market for the opium available Avas very largely due to the excessive export duty of £83 per case of 160 lbs. imposed bv the Persian Government and led eventually to the cancella tion of the Concession. The monopolists were extremely hard pressed for funds and one can A\ r ell imagine that the profits which have accrued from deals they have made have been insufficient to cover the possible outlay in acquiring their monopolv rights. They are reported to have about 5.800 cases in stock at an average cost to them of about Rials 7,800 per case of 160 lbs. for Avhich they are unable to find a10 market. Iriie following estimate, furnished h} 7- a reliable local authority, tends to confirm this report. 1931 crop : approximately 1932 crop : approximately Exports about &gt; / Stocks in hand In merchants go-downs Cases. 7.500 2.500 10,000 3,000 5,800 1,000—1,500 —There have been fairly extensive shipments of gum, principally in view of their value in export certificates although there Was a sharp demand from Germany for lower qualities towards the end of the )ear. Imports. Sugar .—The import of sugar into Persia is a monopoly of flm Russians,- but deliveries have been erratic and prices have shown a tendency to increase. Matches also are now controlled by a Russian monopoly and short deliveries Of inferior qualities have caused some profiteering in spite of a controlled official price. Piece-goods. —Cotton piece-goods form an important item in the Persian market which lias been flooded with cheap Japanese goods of a design suitable to Persian tastes. The Russians, who previously had practically driven British (Lancashire and Indian) goods from the market found themselves in turn, unable to compete in spite of price-reductions and offers of discounts. Japanese business is conducted principally through buying agents in Bombay where goods are transhipped to British India Steam Navigation Company's boats; The terms are usually 20 per cent, with order and balance payable on shipment of the goods. No credit is allowed but discounts are accorded varying between 10 and 40 per cent. Manchester piece-goods still come into the country but in very limited and diminishing quantities and only in certain line's of standard quality such as white mulls, white nainsooks and Black Italians. Messrs. Zieglers tell me that they are unable to cover the cost of a recent import of one of their oldest and fiiost stable lines, a white shirting made especially for them. Tea.—As a result of ihe general economic situation the import of tea, which is almost entirely Indian, has fallen considerably and prices have increased from Rials 574 per man in January 1932 to Rials 72 in December of the same jmar. Sunday wurke/.—According to reports there is a general tendency through- out the country to.purchase from Britain in preference to the United States of America or other European sources but this condition is said to be due entirely to exchange consideration. In view of the competitive prices otfered by the .L in ec Kingdom manufacturers, a rapidly increasing number of British trucks is being imported by Messrs. Zieglers who have completely dropped competing American interests. 1 ^ ^ ^ imaltered relatlVe p0Sltl0n of ot *’ er interests, excluding Russian, remains T ! le Comme reial Treaty with Russia, which was signed on October 27, 1931, came into operation during Uie year and strenuous efforts were made by the iflh Treaty In Z f r 8» Iuza i taon &lt;. ake advantage, of the favourable terms of the Treaty to develop Russian trade with Persia Persian merchants, tTrorkTe'rsfan mlrtfjr'y ‘¥1 ^ 'Wy merely strengthened Russian control ot Persian maikets to the detriment of the Persian merchants them- rancellarion Unp ° pularity of the ^cement provoked an agitation for its The traditional hostility to the Russimio in thL n* + ^ ± j , , o trading method's is detrimental to the development of anr ?

In the months of August and September some disturbances occurred in the area owing to the activities of several gangs of robbers. A number of places and bazaars were raided but no damage occurred to Company property. The leaders of the gangs were eventually apprehended and settled conditions were restored. The small Persian military detachment, which is posted to the Company’s areas, was withdrawn, an action which led to some dislocation in the local Guard ing arrangements. As the result of representations the detachment was prompt ly lemstated and normal conditions were at once restored. • 4.1 Kuh~i-nmnd. The depth of this well at the beginning of the year was 2,675 ft wRh 10 casing cemented at 2,646 ft. A 6*' hole was being drilled by the rotary method. Early m the year traces of oil were identified in the cores and samples oi heavy oil and water were recovered. In order not to mud off possible oil shows it was decided, to continue drilling by the cable tool method, although when con sidered that circumstances were favourable the rotary method was reverted to Irorn time to time m the hopes of accelerating progress. Considerable cavings of the hole and large quantities of water entering the hole at various depths also the very heavy losses of circulating mud encountered at various depths delaved progress very considerably. Samples impregnated with heavy oil were also recovered trom depths between 3,620—3,634'. At a deptti of 3,837 ft. it became evident that further progress without inserting a string of 8' 'casing was impossible, and m view of the lack of favourable indications so far encountered, it was decided to suspend operations at this depth. Instructions to this effect were issued to the area on 14th August. • were therefore made to evacuate the area and this work occu pied the remainder of the year and has now been completed. lc33?FDCHAPTER HI.

The administration of the provmce passed more and more into the hands of the eh il authorities and the military nature of the regime m Fars gradually disappeared rave amongst the tribes and one or two outhmg distnct* such as -r . „ 1 3 The Fars troops continued to be under the command of Sarhang Ibrahim Khan Zandieh. The normal strength of the troops kept in Shiraz appeared to be about two thousand. Xo troubles occurred which called for extensive opera tions • in July a contingent of about 500 troops under the command of Sarhang Hussein Khan Pur Rastigar which had left for Dasht in the. previous November to co-operate with other forces in disarming that region returned to Shiraz. In the province of Shiraz very severe restrictions were placed upon the possession of fire-arms of any description and later in the year it was made a capital offence to be found in possession of any breech-loading weapon. Ali Khan remained un subdued but inactive till about October. His followers then began to terronse the Firuzabad region and on November 16th about 1,000 troops proceeded to Firuzabad under the command of Sarhang Saadi. They drove Ali Khan and his followers—who were reported to number only about 100 fighting men—further into the hills and slight engagements took place in which a few casualties were sustained. By the close of the year the operations had not been terminated and Ali Khan was still at large. He was offered terms in the course of December hut declined them. 4 . Security was good in the earlv months of the year but as the effects of the poor rains made themselves felt brigandage began to increase. In all some six armed robberies occurred on the Shiraz-Bushire road and two on the Shiraz- Tsfahan road. In outlying parts of Fars robberies on minor roads were much more numerous. Niriz, Fasa. Firuzabad and Lar were the regions most affected. The Sorklii family was responsible for much of the trouble. Jan Molmmed Sorkhi was captured and hanged in July. Another famous brigand, Hadi, was shot. His relatives however took upon themselves to avenge him and were responsible for much trouble round Lar in the last month of the year. The Amuieh was active and on the whole not ineffective. Large numbers of robbers were executed publicly by firing parties in Shiraz. An increase in severity was noted in November and December and protests were made that many men had been shot without proof of brigandage simply for carrying guns. 5. The poliev of disarming the tribes and keeping them entirely divorced from their hereditary leaders was pursued vigorously. By a law passed on the 7th June 1932 the whole of the properties belonging to the Qawam-ul-Mulk in Fars were transferred to the Government, the Qawam receiving other land in compee- satiou in northern provinces. The blow struck at Sowlat-nd-Dowleh was much more severe. He and his son. deputies to the Majliss and not allowed to leave Tehran, were accused of conspiracy with the tribes and in August were arrested and put in prison where they still were at the end of the vear. ' The nature of the evidence against them does not appear to ho entirely convincing. What their eventual fate will be remains a matter for conjecture. ' The tribes themselves had a ei\ had ^cai. Lack ol water led to creat losses aunmnsrst their live-stock aud considerable suffering to themselves. D was impossible in the circumstances to enfoice the policy of forcing the nomads to settle permanently. Some few were persuaded to do so and a new village was built at Tol-i-Khosro in the vicinity of Arackan for this purpose.6. His Imperial Majesty visited Shiraz on October 28th and remained until November 2nd. He appeared very mistrustful of the Shirazis, mounted his own guard in the Arg and went out very rarely. He treated every one—particularly the merchants—in a very cavalier manner. His visit added to the fear he inspires, hut certainly in no way enhanced his popularity. He did his best to find fault with the troops but actually could discover little to criticise. It had been Tumoured that H. 1. M. intended to visit the town of Tol-i-Khosro which lie had •caused to be built but the visit was not carried out, due it was said to apprehen sions as to the attitude of the Boir Ahmedi tribe in that region. 7. Municipal services did not launch out into new projects in 1932. One extra Khaiban was completed, a few more streets were electrically lit. By the end of the \ear—accelerated undoubtedly by the Shah’s visit—Shiraz presented an appearance of orderliness and completeness few other Persian towns can equal. A oreat deal &lt;»f new building took place during the year—a form of investment to winch merchants here frequently turn in bad trading times—and the favoured side of the city was the western side. The Indo-European Telegraph Department property was sold in the first half of the year, not to the opium monopoly depart ment who were once in the field as possible buyers, but by a little known merchant. The roads in and around Shiraz were well maintained and the stretch Shiraz to Abaci eh was so good as to evoke favourable comment from the Shah. The excavations at Persepolis financed by the Oriental Institute (a branch of the University of Chicago) continued under the guidance of Professor Herz- leld and a number of important finds were made including a very fine stairway m excellent preservation. The health of the town was good throughout the year. There were no serious epidemics althouch the standard of life of the poorer classes was still further reduced and raanv evidences of extreme poverty were to be seen. The building of the Church Missionary Society new hospital went on and m spite of a fire which destroyed the roof in May and caused about 300 pounds damage was prac tically completed by the end of the year. 8 The effect of the cancellation of the D ’Arcy Concession in Shiraz is worth mentioning. In general the population here seems to be friendly dispo^d to the British • it is certain that the'demonstrations of joy over the “ deliverance &gt; ot Persia were enforced by Government officials. An atmosphere of antagonism was engendered and for a short time there was a very definite avoidance of contact with British residents by all Persians. This attitude, however, changed after about a -month and bv Christmas normal friendly relations were resumed. Ai- thoudi at Christmas cards were left by a number of officials it is impossible for British officials here to enter into friendly relations with any but the Governor General. Until the visit of the Shah the Head of the Finance Department was extremely friendly with all foreign residents but since then has “ dropped them completely. 9 Trading conditions were poor throughout the year. The opium trade was practically at a standstill ; the guns, hides and carpets fetched very low prices m foreign markets and as a result of the inflated export to meet the requirements of the Trade Monopoly Law demand declined as the year advanced. The duel ci,autre in the character of trade has been the loss of ground by the Russians m the face of Japanese competition ; relatively the English share of the piece-goods market did not alter very much, hut fell off in volume. “ Luxury goods o any sort have practically disappeared from the Shiraz bazaar and are not being le- placed. Towards the end of the year the “ deadness ” of the bazaar was yn\ obvious : casual visitors were struck by the emptiness ot them and the ioiloin look of the neglected shops. After the criticism of the Shah efforts were made to float a company for working a cotton spinning and weaving mill. Some progress was made but by the close of 1932 it was still doubtful whether the project would materialise m spite of heavy pressure from the Governor General. fO. The school connected with the Church Missionary Society, although a primary school, continued open. The principal Miss Gerrard assumed I ersmn nationalitv and is having the school registered as a Persian school ^ connec- lion with the Church Missionary Society, never very strong, has nov piacu.mll} vanished. The cinemas of Shiraz once swelled to four in number during the summer ot 1932, but two failed ; the quality of films shown remained very poor. Men and women except in the ' ‘ boxes ” were still segregated.Tlie year in general was a disappointing one in the province of Fars. Crops were well below average, prices for external exports were low, while the cost of local commodities rose. The poorer people became more and more ragged as the year went on ; the competition of foreign goods was much restricted. There was undoubtedly a great deal of want and suffering, all of which seems to have been borne with surprising patience and fortitude. Rain and snow in the month of December aroused the hope that 1933 would be a better year than the last. It is possible that there may be considerable local improvement m the next year, but less probability that commerce will improve unless the conditions of foreign trade are modified and the tax on opium exports reduced. There is no reason to suppose that the general attitude of somewhat grudging submission to the present regime will be modified in any more active direction ; and it is indisputable that a certain section of the population is definitely in favour of the new' order.CHAPTER IV. Administration Report of the Consuiar District of Bandar Abbas and Lixgam FOR THE YEAR 1932. Personnel. Pomdar Abbas.—Bis Majesty’s Consul, Mr. G. A. Richardson OBE held charge till 8th December when he was relieved by Captain C. H. Lincoln, (j.B.E.

The latter was relieved by the permanent incumbent, Agha Ismail Khan Bahadur, on the 30th June. &amp; The duties of the Governor have, as a result of establishment of several ad ministrative departments, and of opening of Adlieh Court in Bandar Abbas in August, chiefly been confined to the supervision of the Municipality of which he is the President. Agha Ismail Bahadur, who hails from Tabriz, and does not appear to possess much intellectual talent has been endeavouring to prove himself fit for the post by exhibiting energetic activities in connection with the improvement of the town. He appears, unlike his predecessor, to be steady and cautious. The Governor of Gulf Ports, Agha Ali Asghar Khan Talikani, visited Bandar Abbas and Minab between 16th and 26th March and Lingah on his way to Bushire. Minab .—Agha Abdul Husain Mirza, son of Rukn-ud-Dauleh assumed charge on the 12th March. Agha Shikohi did not join the post as expected last year.

Bandar Abbas .—Syed Ali Khan Sadr was transferred to Bushire on 31st May and succeeded by Mirza Ibrahim Khan Arbabi, the Telegraph Master. The latter remained in charge during the remaining part of the yea£ Due to the leniency of the new Director, several complaints of the irregumrities among the staff were heard. The Posts and Telegraphs officials, however, remained well disposed towards this Consulate. The work of the Telegraph section was satisfactory throughout the year. Communication by telephone with Minab was maintained. Lingah .-—Mirza Ali Akbar Farah was the Postmaster throughout the year. Municipality. Bandar Abbas .—The new Governor, as mentioned above, was enthusiasti cally keen to improve the state of the town and the following schemes were under consideration :— • Water Supply .—The work on the test well which was resumed in February and suspended in May was taken up with somewhat greater zeal in November. A channel from an underground stream in Naiband about 3 miles East of town was expected to reach Bandar Abbas about the end of the Persian year 1311 (21st March 1933) and hoped that a cubic foot of running water would be brought by then. This channel would be connected later with the main ‘ qanat ’ which is being brought from Band-i-Kunarun. Lc338FDP r- 20 FTrrtriritii and Ice Supply.— The Ice Factory and Electric plant owned by prvi/^}i nikh Ahmed Gelladari was valued at-Rials 32,000 to be purchased by the newly 5 Fn^me^Omupany with a capital of Rials 100,000. The new company was expected to commence work in the beginning of the year 1933. Charitable Dispensary.—This dispensary at the instance of the then H. B. M.’s Consul was established in 1919 by public subscription and lemamed under control of the Consulate un to the 23rd January when it was closed down on abolition of the post of the Medical Officer attached to the Consulate, who used to attend there daily without any charge to this institution. The Hospital with its equip ment was,' with the permission of the Hon’ble the Political Resident m the Per sian Gulf handed over to the Governor on the 7th Aovember. The latter succeed ed in raisin 0, a sum of Rials 24,000 by subscription with a view to re-open this Dis pensary for the benefit of the public. Dr. Kaikobad Hormusji Dumree, a Medical Practitioner at Kerman was negotiating with the Governor to obtain the post of Medical Officer. The Main Hoad.—On receipt of sanction of Rials 40,000 for construction of a main road through the town, the Governor marked the track of the road and ex pected to start the work in the beginning of 1933. Education.. Bandar Abbas.—Mixm Noor All Khan Basti remained in charge through out the year. A Primary Girls School was opened on the 5th December. An instructive drama was enacted on the nights of 23rd and 24th December in aid of the, orphan students which yielded a net income of Rials 2,500. JAngyh .— AgLa Salihi was Superintendent of both the schools throughout the year. Police Department. Bandar Abbas. —Naib Syed Asadullah Khan Faqri was relieved by Naib Syed Ali Mohamed Khan Fatemi on the 10th March. The latter proceeded to Tehran on leave in July and handed over charge to his assistant Naib II Ghnni Khan Zand. The present incumbent Naib Shamsuddin Khan assumed duties on the 25th August. No reports of any kind of crime were received during the year and the work of the Police was as efficient as in the preceding years. Lingah, Hen jam, Minab and Kishm Island. —A similar strength of Police Force as in the previous year was maintained at these places. Passport Department. Bandar Abbas—The work continued to remain in the hands of the Police authorities and Political Officers and Captains of the Mail steamers calling here were afforded facilities to disembark during the stay of the steamer in the har bour. Miss Dodson of the Church Missionary Society Multan, who arrived without ooiaining a visa from the Persian Consul, however, had some difficulty in obtaining permission to disembark. All foreign subjects residing here were registered at the Police Station dur ing the year without experiencing the least trouble. Amnieh {Gendarmerie). -The strength of the force in this town remained as in the Bandar Abbas.- preceding year. 1 a war A bn lurab Khan Majd, the Officer Commanding at Bushire, visited British Basidu in the course of his inspection tour along the coast in January and mentioned tLar he Laci the iiiiCiition to post some of his guards at the British Settlement. Naib Sa-obang Abdnllah Khan Tmnaj, the Officer Commanding at Kerman inspected the Bandar Abbas-Kerman Motor Road in February. Another hatch of 45 recruits was despatched to Bushire in January. Judicial Department. * Bandar Ahbas —An Adlioh Court was established under the Presidents!*) of Agha Mohamed Khan Ashrafi on the 25th August with Mirza Mohammed KhanSadr-ul-Anam and Agha Jamalnddin Khan Samawi as Muddai-ul-Umuin and Mustantiq respectively. Ling ah and Mmab. —The Deputy Governors remained in charge of the Sulhieh Courts at these places much to the discontent of merdhants and traders there. Customs. Bandar Abbas. —Mirza Abu Talib Khan Abasalti continued to hold charge of the Provincial Director throughout the year. lie was, as compared with, his predecessor, reputed to be most unreasonable in his dealing with the merchants, who were greatly handicapped by the application of the Trade Monopoly law to its very letter. The surtax which was raised in February from 80 per cent, to 120 and then reduced to 136 per cent, in March was again raised to 176 per cent, in May and reduced to 160 per cent, in June. The. Persian Government having reserved the monopoly of the import of sugar and matches for themselves, the consignments of these commodities were stored in the Customs House and then sold to the merchants. Monsieur ii. Dei- courde, the Inspector General of Customs visited Bandar Abbas in May with the chief object of making arrangements for the storage of the Government sugar and matches. The old godowns were demolished and the work on the new ones com menced in September. The masonary pier was also being extended to erect coverings lor landing and storage of sugar and matches. No cases of smuggling of gold of any importance were reported during the year with the exception of small quantities found on the persons of passengers. It is, however, believed that large quantities were sent, out of the country by means of the sailing dhows leaving from small ports in this district without being detected by the Customs officials on patrol duty on the coast and waters. The Customs posts on the Biyaban Coast, which were closed in March due to the raids on them by the tribesmen were reopened in September. The Customs officials hailing from the North were, to the great dis-satisfac tion, of those from the Gulf, given an increase of 90 per cent, on their pay and allowances. • Persian Troops. Bandar Abbas. —Yawar Safar Ali Khan Nusraf was in command till the end of September when he was relieved by Yawar Abdullah Khan Arab Nizad. Sarhang Mohammed Khan Maimand, the General Officer Commanding the Kerman Brigade inspected the garrison here in July. The operations in Biyaban ended in April without much success. Sarhang Alburz, who has since been transferred to Zabul Force, was however successful in getting hold of Sardar Mir Barkat Khan and in collecting 1,200 rifles from his followers. Abdul Husain Khan Kameran and the two sons of Mustafa Khan, ihe arch out-laws in the Bashakird area still remained at large. The operations were again in progress in the latter part of the year when a detachment under Command of Yawar Safar Ali Khan Nusrat was despatched from here to join the party sent from the Baluchistan Force, with a view to complete the disarma ment of the tribesmen and to bring the ring leaders to task. Conscription. Bandar Abbas. —74 men were enlisted for this force during the year, and most of those who were fit for the service, but exempted on payment of cash presents to the influential members of the Committee, were on scrutinizing the list called upon to join the force. Condition of the Country. Bandar Abbas.- -TJie town remained quiet throughout the year. Condition of the Roads.

Bandar Abbas .—The trade of Bandar Abbas during the year under review was, as in the past years, very limited and the merchants here, who in the majority of cases, are clearing and forwarding agents of the business houses at Yez’d and Kerman, remained idle due to the following facts :— (1) The Trade Monopoly Law restricting the import of many useful com modities was in force. (2) The monopoly of sugar and matches was reserved to themselves by the Persian Government, the Russians being the sole suppliers. (3) The activities of the Russians who are now trading under the name of “ Venishtorg ”, and have opened their office here on a larger scale. They still specialise in the system of barter. The new entry in the market was of the Japanese piece-goods against which the Russians had to face serious competition, the quality of the Japanese piece- goods being preferred by the local merchants. The sugar which was solely supplied by the Russians, was very inferior in quality and much disliked by the consumers. The Russians remained, as before, unpopular in the market. They were not even in good terms with the local Customs against whom they have complained to the Central Administration. The Customs have also submitted their counter complaint against the Russians’ unfair dealings and cheating the Government by supplying goods much inferior to that agreed upon. It is, however, evident that the Russians have practically driven out the other countries from the local market. Of the two Hindu firms that existed last year one closed down in the first part of the year. The remaining Hindu firm is also contemplating closing as soon as outstanding amounts are realised. Bandar Abbas.—121 steam ships aggregating 260,956 tons entered and cleared this port during the year, which were comprised of 112 British, 4 German and 11 Russian vessels. Seven vessels brought merchandise from the United Kingdom. The four German steamers belonged to the Hansa Line of Bremen and embarked their cargo at Hamburg or Antwerp. The eleven Russian vessels were of Soviet Mercantile Fleet bringing goods from Odessa. . Lingah .—64 steamships with a total of 105,426 tons entered and cleared the port. All except one, which was German, belonged to the British India Steam Navigation Company. Casualties .—The slow mail S. S. “ Baroda ” of the British India Steam Navigation Company ran aground off Bandar Abbas at 9-30 p.m., on the 6th January, when a strong Shamal was blowing. She was towed off the following- evening by His Majesty’s Ships “ Ormande ” and “ Hastings ” which were summoned for the assistance. The town remained quiet throughout the year with the exception of some demonstration which was shown in December on receipt of the news of the cancel lation of the D’Arcy concession of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company when the bazar was decorated and illuminated.

Dr. Couluqnel, the Chief Health Officer at Tehran visited Bandar Abbas and Minab in May. The Town Charitable Dispensary was closed down on 23rd January as reported above. ^Economic Conditions. It was a very poor year due to scarcity of rain. The date harvest was also spoiled by untimely rain in July. No locusts appeared this year. ' ' 'll'' C. H.

I Games and atlieltic sports figure largely in the life of the School and at the beginning of the year a Beading room and Games room was opened for the use of the senior boys. (c) Gi r l s ’ School— As the result of the new regulations, the number of pupils in the Girls’ School, which originally was a Primary one, dropped from 22o to 45 and at the end of the year stood at 50. The status ot the Girls’ School has not vet official!v been raised to that of a Middle one as the Head Mistress, Miss J. F. Woodroffe, is not yet qualified to run a Middle School. She was, however, for the time being, been permitted to keep the two top classes of the primary class in addition to two lower classes for a Middle School. During the year, eight girls took the Government Primary Examination (6th class) while five teachers, who were given half-time tiainmg, weie successful m the ninth class Middle Grade Government Examination. Besides these, seven girls took the Primarv English Certificates for C. M. S. Schools in Persia and four others passed the Middle Grade C. M. S.

Over 2,000 visits were paid gratuitously to over 600 typhus patients between January and July when this epidemic was prevalent in Kerman. Doctor Dodson experienced great difficulties due to the new regulations now in force in the country in connection with the import of goods. He spent a sum of Rials. 17,872 during the year in Customs and transport charges only on the drugs, instruments, and hospital kit received from England. is growing steadily as the i 1932. 1931. 699 805 i 6,429 5,968 .. 21,981 16,680 4,589 2,125 529 529 {Welfare Work).

I. M. the Shah for his action For three consecutive nights illuminations were held in the different chief centres of tlie town and m some cases fireworks displayed. The Russian Sales Agent in Kerman took an active part. ^The Chief Mullah of the town, Haji Mirza Mohamad Reza, ‘ Ayatullah \ incurred the Governor-General’s displeasure because he failed to fulfil the pro mise extracted from him to make a public speech concerning this affair in one of the chief mosques. The trade operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Kerman have, however, not been interfered with in any way. The local papers have been publishing articles with regard to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company affair on the same lines as printed by Tehran papers. 6. Carpet Trade, and Spinning Mill Project .—The exports of Kerman carpets and tribal rugs expressed in thousands of Rials during 1932 and the three pre ceding years were as follows :— 1929. 1930. 1931. 1932. Kerman carpets and rugs 7,746 13,140 12,079 8,593 Tribal rugs • „ 1,295 913 888 1,200 The decrease in the export of Kerman carpets and rugs is noticeable, and as this industry is the chief source of income in this Province, the slackness in * carpet trade affects all classes of the inhabitants. Till this industry revives no general improvement can be expected in trade. In the month of May one of the chief export weavers in Kerman imported a wool carding machine from Germany. This machine is somewhat smaller than that owned by the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, Limited, a British Carpet Firm, but is said to be of a more up to date type. Spinning Mill Project .—As the cotton yarn used in the weaving of carpets in Persia has to be imported either from India or Japan, in the year 1931 a scheme v r as set on foot by the local authorities to follow up Colonel Noel’s proposal to form a Company with the idea of importing a Spinning Mill plant and erecting it at Rafsinjan, the chief cotton producing centre in the province. A Company was formed with a promised capital of Tumans 500,000 one-third of which was to be subscribed by the National Bank of Persia. During the year, the latter, bov/cver, backed out because they w r ere not successful in inducing the share-holders to import the machinery from Germany. The share-holders paid up the first instalment of 80,000 tumans which amount is still lying with the National Bank of Persia. At one time it wms thought that the Yezd merchants v r ould participate in this scheme but later they decided to import a separate plant for their mvn town. The Kerman share-holders were thus unable to raise the full amount required, and at the time of writing the matter was at g stand still. In May news reached Kerman of the formation of a Syndicate in Tehran and the share-holders of the Kerman Spinning Mill Project are of opinion that the Syndicate should take over this concern also, or that the Yezd and Kerman provinces should join together as no machinery has yet been imported for the former place either. Failing these two alternatives they would prefer to receive back their paid-up shares as the money is lying idle with the National Bank of Persia and the Kerman province is in great need of cash owing to damages caused to the water channels (qanats) by floods during the year under review ; the majority of the share-holders are land-lords. 7. Communications and Security. — (a) Communications .—Prince A’izaz-us- Sultaneh, Kamerani, held the charge of the Road Administration in South-East Persia, vfith headquarters at Kerman, throughout the year at the end of which, however, he was transferred to Mazenderan. Kamerani took great interest in his v T ork and even spent money on the improvement of roads without waiting for sanction from his Ministry. At the time of his departure a sum of Tumans 20,000 was outstanding on this account and till the Ministry sanction this expenditure, no disbursement could be made to the parties to whom the money is due. The -work on the Kerman-Khabis motor alignment which was taken in hand in 1931 is still in progress. At the close of 1932 about one-half of the Sirch pass had been made practicable for touring cars. No new roads were started in the Province during the year under review. The condition of the motor road from Bandar Abbas, via Sirjan, the principal trade route to Kerman,_ was improved during the year. In rainy weather, however, this road occasionally remains blocked for short periods until the damages caused could be repaired. The heavy floods in July caused a good deal of damage to this road. Lc338FDm 28 The motor road to Zaliidan (Duzdap) is now very seldom used owing to the rail-head having been removed to Nok-Ivundi. (b) Security of Trade Routes.—In spite of desultory robberies on the Bandar Abbas-Kerman motor road by Farsi robbers, the security of trade routes in the Province has considerably improved. The Arnnieh Department performs its duties more efficiently and a number of stray robbers caught have in most cases been executed by the* Military Department, On the whole, law and order on the trade routes in the Province has been well maintained. (c) PmsAsv—New Post offices were opened at Zerind and Rawar at the end of the year. The bi-weekly sendee between Kerman and Bandar Abbas was changed to a weekly one in the month of September owing to the previous postal contract having expired and there being no offers for the new one. The authorities were, however, obliged to sanction an increase of 200 Tumans per mensem on the previous contract, held by a Parsi, Rustam Navandad, and renew it at a figure of Tumans 700 per mensem. The unsatisfactory delivery arrangements prevailing in the Kerman Post Office reported in the previous Administration Report have not improved. A secret censorship is applied to all foreign mails arriving at Kerman. (d) Wireless .—The Wireless Station in Kerman was not used during the year, though it is supposed to be in working order. This is apparently due to the great expense involved in its working. (e) Aviation .—No aeroplanes visited Kerman during the year and the aerodrome to the north-west of the town has, therefore, been neglected. B.— Local Government and Politics. 8. Condition of the Country.—The administration of the province has con tinued to improve and law and order well maintained. The Amnieh authorities succeeded in capturing a number of highway robbers or defaulters who were dealt With by the Military authorities. Complaints against officials of the Military and Amnieh Departments by villagers have been negligible. The Police force appears to be more efficient and their patrols in the town more regular. The number of burglaries has decreased. The Shah’s popularity for the efficient administration of the eountrv and the state of security has been maintained. 9. Local Oflictal/t and Departments. — Governor-General. His Excellency Mirza fteza Khan Afshar, was transferred from Kerman in Februart to take up his new appointment as the Minister of Roads.

JaricuUnre. —M. Makarian, the representative of the Department of Agri culture in the Kerman Province, received orders m September to close down his ffice end return to Tehran. No useful work has so far been accomplished in this province by the Agricultural authorities. 4n Armenian representative of the Ministry of Economics paid a visit to Rafsinjan in April to examine the Pistachio post : nothing further has been Heavy rains of a tropical nature fell in the whole province of Kerman on the 16!17th Julv causing heavy floods all round. A number of houses were damaged and ^some lives lost. Great damage was caused to qanats (water- ehamieH) The Governor-General’s estimate of the total damage to the pro-' vince was in the vicinity of 10 million Tumans. 524 qanats suffered out of a tot-d of 3 000 in the province. The land-owners have not yet been able to repair the larger number of these owing to want of ready cash. The land-produce will thus not reach the normal level for a number of years to come. Owing to a good) deal of harvest having been washed away by the floods, scarcity of doni was already being felt in Kerman at the end of the year. Loou$tS .—Two swarms of locusts appeared in the districts of Jiruft and Rudbar in January, but they caused no damage. In fact the insects were a sod as food bv the poorer inhabitants—a not unusual practice in the above districts. The province was thus free from the locust pest throughout the year. Sejjilri-Ahwaal .—Mirza Mohammad Ali’Khan, Dabir Ilahi, was the chief of the Census Department at the close of the year. No cases of corruption in this Department were reported during the year, and there have been few instances of default on the part of the public to obtain their Sejjil-i-Ahwaal papers. 10. Local Politics .—During the year the taking over by the Government of all the ‘ Waqf ’ property (endowments) in the-country was advocated by local papers calling upon the* leading Mullahs to support the suggestion. The Governor-General also tried, directly or indirectly to influence the chief Mullahs of Kerman to make public utterances on the same subject but received no response. The conversion to Islam of three Russians in the month of January caused some rejoicing in the town. In October the election campaign to the 9th Medjliss was started and com pleted at the close of the year. With the exception of the Sirjan constituency the Governor-General had orders to arrange for the re-election of the former deputies, who were :— ♦ Kerman town and environs Rafsinjan Jirnft and Rudbar .. Bam . Muayyid-i-Ahmadi. Dabistani. .. Amir-i-Ibrahimi. .. Roohi. .. Dr. Malikzadeh. Mirza Hassan Khan, Mirat Isfandiari, replaced Dr. Sheikh (Ihya-ul-Mulk) for Sirjan. As the public were well aware that the Government nominees were to he i eturned under any circumstances, no real interest was taken in the proceeding 8 the parties concerned. A representation, by the trading community m Kerman to Tehran asking for permission to elect one deputy for the town from their community met with no response. Otherwise Kerman has been void of the Mullahs has waned still further. any political event. The influence ofPress .—There are now only two papers being published in Kerman. Their tone towards British interests continued to be normal till the propaganda against the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was started in Tehran. Since then the local papers have published articles on the same lines as those appearing in the Tehran press. 11. B.eultli and General Welfare .—The Health authorities have made endeavours to improve the sanitation of the town and the unhealthy practices are being checked to a certain extent. Dr. Sohrab was the Health'Officer in the Kerman province at the end of the year. An epidemic of typhus fever broke out in Kerman in January, and only died down in July. The disease was almost entirely limited to the poor where it ran through whole.families taking all members together, or one after another in turn. Despite frequent cases of marked hyperpyrexia, the disease had a low mortality, broadly speaking only weaklings and aged folk succumbing to it. During the epidemic the Church Missionary Society staff treated over 600 patients and great credit is due to Dr. G-. E. Dodson for his endeavours. Other than the effects of the above epidemic, the health of the town on the whole remained good till the end of the year when influenza appeared in a mild form. 12. Russian Trade Interests .—The Soviet Trade Representation in Kerman gave an exhibition of their agricultural tools and implements in January but did not create much impression on the cultivators. In May the Soviet Consrul-General, Isfahan, visited Kerman to attend the opening ceremony of the electric light installation in which he displayed great interest. The Soviet Trade Representation closed down in Kerman in the month of September, transferring their headquarters to Bandar Abbas. Sheikh Abul Kassim Harandi has continued to remain as the Russian Sales Agent in Kerman throughout the year. 13..Military and Conscription .—The Kerman column which had proceeded to Bashakird during the latter part of 1931 to reduce Abdul Hussein Kameran, returned to headquarters in April without accomplishing its object. Another column despatched in November on the same mission is so far reported to have not met with any success. The discipline of the military force in the province is commendable. Sarhang Mohammad Khan Maimand was commanding the Kerman Brigade at the end of the year. Conscription.— Naib Sarhang Farajullah Khan Mushar was in charge of the Conscription Department throughout the year. A fresh 'enquiry by this official resulted into a number of exempted persons being called upon to enlist. — 14. Persian Baluchistan and Rudbar .—Sartip Mohammad Khan Nakhjawan. Officer Commanding, Persian Baluchistan, was recalled to Tehran in May and replaced by Sartip Abbas Khan, Alburz, from Kerman. Operations by troops from Baluchistan in conjunction with the column from Kerman against Abdul Hussein, Kameran, as reported above, are still in progress. There were no Baluch raids across the Lut during the year under review. Rudbar. —Zargham-us-Sultaneh is still the nominal ruler of Rudbar and a military garrison is now permanently stationed in the district. Zargham’s rival nephew, Saeed Khan, whom he succeeded in getting into trouble, is still under detention at Kerman. C. H. LINCOLN, Captain, His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman. British Consulate, Kerman, 9th February 1933. Lc338FD32 CHAPTER VI. Administration Report of the Politic A!. Agency, Muscat, for 1932. Part I. Agency Officials.— The following officers held charge of the Agency as Lt Colonel T C. Fowle, C.B.E., from 1st January to 25th July 1932. Captain R. HE. Alban (officiating) from 26th July to 13th November 1932. Major C. E. U. Bremner, M.C., from 14th November to date. The post of Agency Surgeon, reduced to the status of an Indian Medical HeoaVtment appointment on 22nd April 1932, was held throughout the year by Captain L&gt;. L. Mackay and that of Sub-Medical Officer by Mi. G-. . Yemkan- mardi. _ r ^ ™ The post of Treasury Officer, Muscat, was held by Mr. S. P. Pereira and of British Agent, Gwadur by pensioned Subedar Sultan Khan throughout the year. 2 Aqency Hospital and Medical—The total number of patients treated m the hospital was 8,562 of which 8,469 were out-patients and 93 in-patients. Hie figures show an increase in the number of patients by 382 on the previous yeai. Malaria was the most prevalent disease. Diseases of the digestive system, with skin and eye diseases came next in frequency. Six hundred and ninety-six operations were performed and deserve no special comment. * No cases of poisoning were treated and no cases were sent to India for anti- rabic treatment. There were no epidemics during the year. Sanitary conditions generally remain bad. 3. Political Affairs. —The chief matters of Political interest concerning R. M.’s Government or British subjects will be found in Part II of this report under the heading of “ Events of Political Interest in State limits ”. The two outstanding affairs centred round Sur and Gwadur. The Commercial Treaty between H. M.’s Government and the Sultanate was renewed as usual during the year. 4. Judicial. —Although judicial matters do not fall within the scope of this report and are dealt with separately, it is worthy of note that owing to the presence of the large permanent British Indian trading community centred in Muscat and Matrah and distributed throughout both the coastal area and the interior, the Court work and protection of British (i.e., Indian) interests occupies a large portion of the Political Agent’s time. 5. Trade —Owing to the general financial depression trade conditions, during the year under report, reached a very low ebb. The main articles of export are (u) dry and wet dates (5) dried fish and (c) fish manure, while imports consist of flour, rice, sugar, coffee, cloth and general dry goods. A considerable shortage of rain adversely affected the date crop and there was a marked fall in quality and quantity in both kinds of dates. . Rack of demand and the general tightness of money greatly reduced the puces obtainable for dried fish and fish manure, and these factors in turn i e-acted most unfavourably on imports and the disposal of existing stocks. M hilst the majority are keeping their heads above water with difficulty, n number of merchants are heavily in debt and others have been driven to bank ruptcy. 6. Royal iSavy and Royal Air Force .—The services of the Royal Naw and Royal Air Force are alluded to in Part II “ Political Interests the Royal limits ”. m State • 7- Aviation, General .Visits of H. M. ’s sloops and seaplanes are given m Appendix A attached to this report.Imperial Airways continued to use the Gwadur landing ground throughout the year without serious mishap, though the aerodrome is small and subject to flooding in rainy weather. Negotiations are in progress to regularise the passage of French and Dutch air services over His Highness’ Gwadur territory. With a view to establishing an emergency landing ground at Kalba the assistance of His Highness the Sultan was sought to prevail on the Sheikh of this small independent tract to accord his assent and co-operation. The results of the efforts of His Highness’ emissary were however not crowned with success. Negotiations for the establishment of a refuelling point and emergency aerodrome at Masirah Island (vide Annual Administration Report for 1931, paragraph 24) were brought to a successful conclusion in December and it now remains to be seen to what extent these will work. 8. Foreign Interests. —American interests remained in charge of the Politi cal Agent during the year. The French Consulate remained closed during the year but un-official visits were paid to Muscat by Monsieur Cassin, the French Vice-Consul at Bushire, in March and December. The French sloop “ Aldebaran ”, of the French Pacific Station, put into Muscat due to stress of weather on 2nd August and left on 18th August. ' The French training cruiser Jeanne d’Arc, under the Command of Captain Marquis, visited Muscat from 19th to 21st November, in the course of a world cruise. 9. Missionary Endeavour. —The work of the American Mission (The Dutch Reformed Church of the United States of America) was carried on by Dr. (Miss) Hosmon (till 1st April), Dr. Storm and the Rev. Dykstra and Mrs. Dykstra till mid October when they were joined by Dr. P. W. Harrison, on his return from leave. In December Dr. Storm left for Dhofar by dhow Without the previous assent of His Highness and had not returned till the end of the year. The new Mission Hospital building, which is in course of construction at Matrah, is making slow hut steady progress. It promises to be on most modern lines, as far as local conditions and finance permit. The building material imported for its construction is practically all British. 10. Slavery. —Twenty-four slaves took refuge in the Agency during the year and were in due course manumitted. They comprised 20 males and 4 females. 11. Climate. —The total rainfall recorded during the year amounted to 1.93'. Maximum and minimum temperatures registered were 114.1° on 25th May and 51.3° on 19th February, respectively. The hot weather was slightly less trying than usual. 12. Official Visits. —H. M. S. “ Hawkins ”, Flagship of Vice-Admiral M. E. Dunbar-Nasmith Commanding the East Indies Squadron visited Muscat from 9th to 11th December. A list of visits by Government officials to this Agency is attached at Appendix “ B ”. Part II. Muscat State Affairs. 1. Ruling Family .—On 10th February Saiyid Said bin Taimur officially ascended the Sultanate Gaddi vacated by his father in 1931. On the 3rd March the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf accompanied by the Political Agent and the senior officers of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force stationed in the Persian Gulf, paid an official visit to His Highness to present a “ Kharita ” from His Excellency the Viceroy. During the operations at Sur, which are related in paragraph 3 of this report, the Sultan accompanied the Political Resident and subsequently spent three weeks in visiting Dhofar during the month of April.34 In July His Highness visited India on a three months’ tour during which time he was received by His Excellency the Viceroy at Simla. His Highness, who carries an exceedingly shrewd head on _ his young shoulders tukes u keen personal interest in the ndministintion of his St&amp;te and evinces considerable strength of character in dealing with problems that con front him. Saivid Nadir bin Faisal, the eldest of His Highness’ uncles, still declines to take any active part in State affairs but Saiyid Hamid bin Faisal (the Wall -of Matrah) and many other members of the Royal Family are employed in various Departments of the Administration. 2. State Finance .— Captain R. G. E. W. Alban having been appointed Finan cial Adviser and Commandant, Muscat Infantry, assumed charge of his duties on 26th January. The year 1932 commenced with accrued savings of Rs. 24,000 but with out standings to the Government of India of Rs. 58,000 and to other creditors, merchants, etc., of approximately Rs. 1,40,000. Rigid economy and retrench ment throughout the year has resulted at its close in the clearance of the debt to the Government of India and of approximately Rs. 40,000 of other debts. Arrangements are being made to pay off the balance of the debts in due course. Although this is a most satisfactory improvement, the State is still con fronted by serious difficulties and it seems probable that even further retrench ment will have to be devised if the State is to balance its Budget in the ensuing years. 3. Events of Political Interest in State limits .—The principal focii of interest during the year w 7 ere at Sur and Gwadur. Sur .—As has already been shown in the Administration Report for 1931, Sheikh Ali bin Abdullah al Hamudah of Jaalan had offered considerable opposi tion to the establishment of an efficient Customs Administration at Aiqa. In spite of most generous terms offered to him by the Sultan, the Sheikh ^remained obdurate in his'attitude. \ At the close of 1931 the situation was under reference to H. M. ’» Govern ment with the recommendation of the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that Naval and Air actions should be taken against the Beni Bn Ali, Sheikh Ali’s tribe, should they persist in their contumacy. These recommendations having been accepted by H. M.’s Government pre parations for a concentration of force in the Sur neighbourhood were inaugurated in February. By the 4th March a seaplane base had been established at Khor Jaramah, where 100 rank and file of the Muscat Infantry, under the orders of Captain R. G. Alban, afforded protection to a Royal Air Force dump. . 0n tlie same day H. M. Ships “ Shoreham “ Bideford ” and “ Fowey ”, with the Hon’ble the Political Resident, the Political Agent, Muscat, His High ness the Sultan and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf on board, concentrated at Sur. I ouch was maintained wdth Captain Alban’s detachment by Wireless Tele- graphy, which had been installed against eventualities on board the State gun boat “ Al Saidi ” lying at Khor Jaramah. . . M 4 s , a tentative measure a Customs party was put shore at Aiqa on the 4th Ma rch hut, but their landing being opposed, they returned to the sloops. Warnings were therefore issued to the Beni bu Ali that, failing the accept- bombardedVrsVn-bln 1 ' 1 ?

Prior to this Sheikh Ali had been clearly informed that by his rebellions conduct he had forfeited all claim to the previous generous terms offered to him by His Highness. He was now warned that the establishment of the customs house at Aina was not the sole matter for consideration, but that any terms afforded to him would be entirely dependent on his and his tribe’s future loyalty and good behaviour. Having attained the main object of the operations, the expedition returned to Muscat on the 10th March. During the remainder of the year, though no overt act has been committed by Sheikh Ali or the Beni bu Ali, the former has continued to address most unsatisfactory letters periodically to the Sultan and, and as his uricoiiditional loyalty is still open to suspicion, he has been paid none of his former allowances to date. Gwadiir^-ln April Mr. Shaukat Ali, the well-known Indian leader, took it upon himself without either invitation or permission from His Highness, to visit Gwadur to establish peace between the Baluch community— i.e., tbe Sultan’s subjects-—and the Khoja community, Who are British subjects/ This unwarranted intrusion into his state affairs aroused considerable indignation on the part of His Highness the Sultan. A modus vivendi between the communities having already been established by the Sultan and the Political Agent, Mr. Shaukat Ali’s visit Was somewhat abortive and he took his depar ture after being good enough to send a congratulatory telegram to His High ness. Further action was therefore deemed unnecessary. In June 1932, Esa, son of Dilmurad, the Baluch outlaw who had been imprisoned and subsequently exiled in 1929, for his connection in the murder case of Khoja Ghulam Ali, a British subject, returned to Gwadur. On the urgent representation of the British Agent he was forced to quit Gwadur territory. On 17th November however this individual again arrived in Gwadur and after passing the night in the town, on the morning of the 18th, committed a murderous assault on Bana Ibrahim, a Khoja British subject. Owing to the undoubted connivance of the Baluch element in the town and the gross slackness of the Wali, Esa not Only managed to evade ffrrest, but Continued more or less openly in the town and its vicinity for three days after the event. His Highness the Sultan, early in December, deputed his uncle Saiyid Malik and K. B. Ahmed Shubaily his private Secretary to proceed to Gwadur to con duct a searching investigation. At the close of the year the case Was still under investigation. Except for the foregoing, and a few incidents of lesser import, the tran quillity of His Highness’ State remained undisturbed throughout the year. Among the latter category however allusion may be made to the follow ing : (a) In March Sheikh Hussan, the late Sheikh of Khasab, who had been directed to reside in Muscat on his release from detention in November 1931, was permitted to reside in Debai on parole. He shortly afterwards broke his parole, and escaped to Khasab but was subsequently arrested and sent to Muscat by the Sheikh of Debai. He has since been deported to Gwadur. (b) In August a fracas occurred between the Bani Battah and Bani Wahib near Swakim, the latter tribe losing some Sheikhs cap tured. The Bani Battah withdrew to their homes before the State authorities could intervene. (c) A customs clerk in the employ of the State, and his wife were mur dered at Sib in September. The offenders are known to be Omanis but repeated application to Sheikh Isa bin Saleh by the Sultan for36 EBHWi ii ^ ha 'hnndpd over to instice, in accordance with the MuscatSman Agreement of* 1923, has failed to elicit anything b,„ “e replies and vague counter charges of breaches of tl,c Treaty. (d) In November His Highness convened the leaders of t ic ynnazarali ( ' and Shihuh tribes to appoint, by election a Sheikh for the DibM, area By a majority of votes Zaid bm Sman was elected, thus settling a problem on which many previous attempts had proved unsuccessful. rwriv.-.fa nf nntstandhm imnortanec fliiriiio- Tv 7 /! 1 / 0 / 1 /) / O f n M rwr\ virnvn 11A the year. Various minor inter-tribal squabbles have been reported from time to time and the relations between the Imam and the Sheikh of Jabal Akhdar appear to Trade and General— world wide depression in trade has had serious repercussions in Muscat and many local Muscat! merchants and petty traders have been ruined. Lack of rain has had an adverse effect in both the quality and quantity of dates exported, whilst financial depression in both European and Eastern markets has more or less eliriiinated the source of income derived from the export of fish manure. The tightness of money has driven many more litigants to the local Courts than in previous years. The increase in the State revenues, despite adverse circumstances, is attri butable to the general tightening up of the methods of revenue collection and the drastic reduction of overhead charges. Muscat Infantry --Command of the Muscat Infantry has remained through out the year in the hands of Captain R. G. Alban in addition to his other duties. The numbers of the Corps have now been brought up to normal strength, he., 150 but, in conformity with the general scheme of economy certain reduc tions in pay and the number of non-commissioned officers has been effected. The Corps continued to find the Agency Guard. C. E. U. BREMNER, Major, Political Agent and H. B. M.’s Consul, Muscat./ 39 CHAPTER VII. Administration Report for the Trucial Coast for the year 1932. 1. Personnel .—Khan Bahadur Isa bin Abdul Latif, O.B.E., held the post of Residency Agent, Shargah, throughout the year. 2. Trucial Shaikhs .—The following were the Shaikhs of the various States of the Trucial Coast throughout the year :— 1. Debai .. Ruler 2. Shargah .. Ruler 3. Abu Dhabi .. Ruler 4. Umm-ul-Qawain .. Ruler 5. Ajman .. Ruler 6. Ras al Khaimah ,.. Ruler Shaikh Said bin Maktum bin Ilaskar. Shaikh Muhammad Sultan bin Saqar. j Shakbut bin Sultan. - Ahmad bin Raschid. Rashid bin Humaid. Sultan bin Salim. 3. Royal Navy .—His Majesty’s Sloops of the Persian Gulf Division did their customary useful patrol work up and down the Trucial Coast as elsewhere in the Gulf, and at the end of July His Majesty’s Ship “ Shoreham ” rendered the Resident valuable assistance in the matter of one Hassan, ex-Shaikh of Khassab, who after defying the authority of the Muscat State —vide Adminis tration Report for 1931—had been allowed to proceed to Debai (from Muscat where he had been in detention) under charge of the Shaikh of that place. Hassan broke his parole and slipped away to Khassab. H.M.S. “ Shoreham ” proceeded to the vicinity and, with the assistance of the Shaikh of Debai, succeeded in getting Hassan removed from this danger spot to Bokha, between Khassab and Debai. The Resident brought further pressure to bear on the Shaikh of Debai, who got Hassan back. An incident which might well have lead to a recrudescence of serious trouble at Khassab, thus ended satisfactorily. Hassan was finally returned to Muscat. On the 15th December the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, Vice-Admiral M. E. Dunbar-Nasmith, V.C., C.B., visited Shargah and Debai. He was cordially received. In December His Majesty’s Survey Ship “ Ormonde ” carried out surveys in the vicinity of Shargah and Debai. 4. Aviapion .—The chief event of the year was the securing of the Air Port at Shargah from the Shaikh of that place in July as a result of consider able personal effort on the part of the late Sir Hugh Biscoe, who, on his way to complete the Agreement with the Shaikh, died from heart failure on H.M.S. “ Bideford ” on the 19th July. Colonel Dickson, Political Agent, Kuwait, who was accompanying the Resident, proceeded to Shargah and succeeded after a further few days negotiations in persuading the Shaikh to put his signature to the required Agreement, which offered very favourable terms to the Shaikh. The main objective, after the Agreement had been obtained from the Shaikh, w r as the erection of the Rest House, as Shargah would be a night-stop for Imperial Airways’ aeroplanes. This was undertaken under the supervision of an R. E. officer in the employ of the Royal Air Force Works Department, and after various local difficulties had been overcome, both by the efforts of Captain Mackay, the R. E. officer concerned, and by the intervention of the Political Resident, w T as under construction at the end of the year. Pending the completion of the Rest House comfortable temporary accom modation in tents was arranged for, and on the 5th October the first Imperial Airways’ machine landed and left Shargah. Since then up to the end of the year Imperial Airways were running regularly on the Arab Coast. The Flying Boats of No. 203 (Flying Boat) Squadron based on Basrah performed useful work in their regular flights up and down the coast throughout the year. A fuel tank was established at Yas Island belonging to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. As the petrol barge previously installed at Ras al Khaimah was found to be unserviceable, on the 24th October the barge was towed out to sea and sunk by one of His Majesty’s Sloops, the iron barge beiny replaced by a wooden one. R. A. F. wapitis landed at Ras al Khaimah in May and placed white marks on the aerodrome. 5. Shipping .—The British India Steam Navigation Companv Slow Mail service continued to make its usual calls at Debai, and from the 13th November Lc338FD40 , Q&lt; h{ &gt; r otah according to the terms of the Air Port lT'nt Sle Shaikh of tLt ’place mentioned above. Messrs. Frank C.

The pead market was stall bad, though some nse m prices occurred towards the end of the year. i 7 Twfpfnnl Affairs —In the hinterland there was the normal amount of T&gt;ettv tribaf raidhig and counter-raiding with the customary camel stealing and petty tribal rammg a however provided that they do not assume Srptr^ntanT pread 8 ?o “ta? ports where they might endanger British interests this Residency is not directly concerned. Such incidents mav in fact almost be regarded as an equivalent for the sports and pastimes, chiemas and what not, with which more civilised peoples fill m their spare time. Intertribal quarrels were settled in Arab fashion on Arab lines, now and then with the assistance of the Residency Agent as un-offieial peace-maker. ^ 8. Slave Traffic. —This traffic was non-existant. Six slaves escaping from their owners took refuge with the Residency Agent, who, according to^ precedent, referred their cases to the Resident, who issued them with manumission cer- tificates. 9. Arms Traffic. —No cases under this heading came to light. T. C.

Administration Report of the Bahrain Agency for the year 193.2. 1. Personnel. —Captain C. G. Prior held charge of the Agency until 28th November when he was relieved by Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch. 2. Khan Bahadur Abdul Haiy al Hashimi held charge of the post of Indian Assistant throughout the year. 3. Ruler of Bahrain and the al Khalifah Family. —His Excellency Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali Al Khalifah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., fell ill on the 27th February, with, it is believed, retention of urine. He was found unconscious in the latrine of his house and was brought round with difficulty by Dr. Dame. The close of the year saw His Excellency appreciably weaker, and there is little doubt his end is not far off. (Note.—He died on the 9th December 1932.) His wife, a lady of exceptional character, who has been his mainstay, is also ill, apparently with some heart complaint. 4. Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifah has been on excellent terms with the Agency throughout ’the year. His grant from the revenues of the State (and that of all the Al Khalifah, except Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali Al Khalifah) was subjected to a 10 per cent, cut throughout the year and since he made little attempt to economise his private finances have fallen into some confusion. His estates, however, fortunately brought in more than in 1931 as the date crop was more profitable, or his indebtedness would be greater than it is. 5. Shaikh Muhammad bin Isa Al Khalifah caused some surprise by ex tending his visit to an Austrian eye specialist in Vienna to go to England. Shaikh Hamad was somewhat nettled that the first intimation he received of the visit to England should have come from outsiders, and also possibly felt that these extended tours ill concerted with Shaikh Muhammad’s pleas of poverty. Shaikh Muhammad wrote that he was extending his visit to see His Majesty the King, and had the honour of being presented to His Majesty at a Garden Party at Buckingham Palace. Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch accom panied him to interpret at the request of the India Office. He was very pleased with his reception in England. His son, Rashid, one of the less unpromising Ah Khalifah died in October. 6. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa Al Khalifah, who had long been suspected of creating trouble so as to gain kudos by settling it, was finally seen in his true colours over the agitation regarding the Waqfs in February. He was well aware of the trouble that was brewing in Muharraq and did not warn the Ruler or the Adviser of what was happening. When the trouble came to a head he did nothing to check it, and on one occasion when Shaikh Hamad sent him out to talk over some malcontents all he could sav to them was ‘ ana wiakum ’ or ‘ I am with you ’. When paying the ‘ Id al Fitr ’ calls the Political Agent taxed him with this and Shaikh Abdullah was too embarrassed to deny it. During the Divers’ riot in May he took a more commendable part, partly as a result of the incitement caused by a gross insult offered to him by the divers. 7. Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifah has done well, and is by far the most useful of Shaikh Hamad’s sons. This is very fortunate as he is likelv to be the heir. He has shown signs of being more able to assert himself and is less afraid of his relations than he used to be. He is on excellent terms with the Agency. 8. Shaikhs Mubarak bin Hamad and Abdullah bin Hamad went on the Hajj via India on the 22nd February and returned overland on the 13th May. Thev found the overland trip something of an ordeal, but were well satisfied with Bin Sa’ud’s recention of them. The more observant Abdullah had noticed many signs of the financial stringency of the Hedjaz. 9. Shaikh Da’ij continued his career as the spoilt child of the family, and, it is believed, is still spared the rigours of an education. Ahmad, his younger brother, a well mannered intelligent lad, has had a teacher engaged for him but it is not known what progress he has made. 10. Shaikh Rashid bin Muhammad Al Khalifah did good work as President of the Majlis al Urfi. 11. Bahrain FtMe. —Mr. C. D. Belgrave proceeded to' England on leave on urgent private affairs on the 7th August and returned on the 10th September by air. i42 19 Mr Bel grave showed his usual determination m repulsing attacks on 12.

These consist of the remarants of the Indian Armed Police, the local Police (who are being trained to replace hem) and the Naturs or Night-watchmen. The latter are an irregular body who do not wear uniform, or perform any drills, and are armed with long Lee Enfield rifles. They are posted at Manamah and Muharraq. The strength of these horlies is eiven below :— Strength on 1-1-32. Strength on 31-12-32. Indian Police * • .. 50 11 Followers • . 6 8 Arab Police .. . • .. 56 118 Naturs .. .. .. 121 120 16. Almost all the Indians were allowed to return to India in September and October on completion of their agreements. A few men were engaged.in their place, but they are principally used as Instructors, or to relieve the men under training of 'guard duties. The new Arab recruits, mostly of Negroid extraction, have made an excellent start, and there seems no reason why they should not become as smart as Negro troops elsewhere, since they seem to have a natural love of drill. Partly owing to the hard times dozens of men offer themselves for enlistment, but a very high percentage are rejected for inferior physique. Now that the initial difficulty of obtaining men has been overcome it should be easy for the State to find their requirements locally, since men constantly bring their friends for enlistment, as the Indian soldier does in India. 17. Local Affairs .—No Sunni-Shiah quarrels arose during the year, and the Muharrem celebrations passed off without incident. The educated Persians are rapidly losing all interest in religion, but the Arabs are more conservative. 18. Shaikh Abdullah bin Muhammad Salih and Shaikh Ali bin Husain al Musa’ continue to be on good terms with the Agency, and both supported the Government during the agitation against a proclamation designed to secure honest disposal of inheritances. The Sunni Qadhis are still the three Abdul Xiatifs and are not on good terms either with the Agency or the Bahrain Gov ernment. Their decisions are far from impartial, and there is growing dis satisfaction of their administration of the Sunni Waqfs. Their attitude over the agitation mentioned above was unsatisfactory. ■ ^ 19. The Financial Adviser considers that Shaikh Khalaf has been making mischief amongst the Bahama, but no instance of it came to the Political Agent s notice. During the latter part of the year the old man returned to linq 1 o fetch a wife. But for the fact that old men do not appear to die in Bahrain, the view might he ventured that he would not trouble anyone for long- +1 ’ Tvhoita/nce Proclamation Agitation .—The Bahrain Government decide 011(4 danuarv to issue a proclamation, the gist of which was that s.nmei contiol would be kept over properties left by diseased persons on that steps would oe taken to protect the interests of widows and orphans. Th p oc amn .ion also provided for the calling: for accounts from executors bv th Courts, and stated that no one would be allowed to deal with an estate hefoxObtaining the sanction of a Court. This last provision was obiected to as interested persons are usually able to divide up a deceased’s moveables before he ease comes betore a Qadl„ and this proclamation was specifically desired to prevent such action.

Unfortunately Shaikh Hamad was due to nav his askld tL t 0 p^iticai r A q pY / 11 eal ' ly settlen ? 1 ent J lad to be made. The Adviser asked tne Folitical Agent to re-issue a similar Agency proclamation of 1931 to show Bahrain subjects that the idea was not a new one and that foreigners were liable to similar regulations. This was done, but it proved to be an unfortunate step^ Excitement then prevailed amongst the foreign community Muha aa S The Pol^ 1S , 7’ 77, , b ° dieS ,° f Per?ian o“roS Munarraq.

Fortunately they fecovereff all their lost prestige in the firm handling of the divers’ riot There is little doubt that the Sunni Qadhis were in full sympathy with the agitation. 21 . Divers' Riot.—On the 25th May a divers’ agitation for increased salaf can J ? e t 0 o^ bead } vben some .ringleaders were arrested. The salaf had been fixed *1 ^ f 3 ° + , for . ^ lve , rs and ^ s - 25 for haulers, an uncomfortably low figure but all that the industry could afford after three bad years.

His work has shown ^ ^ results, however, and not onlv have excellent cotton crops been raised. very good start has been made with fruit cultivation, and some exceoranges have been grown. As the person responsible for his engagement, the Political Agent viewed his departure vhth regret, but there is little doubt that he has done good considering the exiguous means at his disposal. The Qusaibis are now the principal exponents of improved farming, and the remark of Abdul Aziz to the Political Agent on the dawn of new ideas is worth repeating. The first year he used manure, he said, it was given to him free, the second he had to pay a small price for it, but this year, now that its value has been discovered, he had had to pay a stiff price for it. The Qusaibis’ action in cleaning up their •date gardens and getting rid of useless trees had been observed by their neigh bours with interest and will undoubtedly be followed. 28. The date harvest was better than last year, and prices on the whole were higher. 29. Customs—The Customs revenue amounted to Bs. 6,14,594. The decline in commodity prices was principally responsible for this decline. 30. The Bahrain Government introduced a per cent, duty on luxuries in place of the former 5 per cent, from the 6 th May and later raised this to 10 per cent, with a 15 per cent, duty on liquor and tobacco on the 31st December. 31. Municipalities.—Both Municipalities do good work, though their means become more and more straitened. 32. Both Municipalities, particularly that of Manamah, have able Secre taries and only lack of funds prevents more rapid development. An effort was made ’to prevent the Manamah sea front being used as a latrine, but much still remains to be done in this matter. 33 A road has been made inland, parallel to the Manamah sea road, at the instance of Captain Prior, and its value has already been perceived. 34 Both Municipalities still continue to interest themselves in many matters quite beyond their purview, but little harm is done and they provide useful safety valves, and on the whole do their work very well. 35 The Manamah Municipal Gardens now have the nucleus of a zoo, including a dejected vulture, who is popularly believed to be an eagle ! 36 The Manamah Municipality halved the price of ice and sold a far larger ouantitv than the year before to the great benefit of the public. They will only -Purchase ice in the hottest weather, however, and a shamal will Mop all demand! for a day or two, though with better times a taste for it will undoubtedly develop. * 4 Screem ’ is now a good Arabic word. 37. Public Works. Owing to financial stringency no works of any magni tude were carried out this year. 38 Education.—-'SW boys 7 schools and two girls’ schools were in existence on the' 1 st January. On the 2nd October when the schools reopened after the summer vacations the Manamah Sunni and Shiah boys’ schools were amalga mated. Tt was feared at one time that this amalgamation would lead to an agitation by the Shiahs but nothing untoward happened. 39. 560 boys and 178 girls were on the rolls on the 1st January and 623 boys and 190 girls on the rolls on the 31st December. 40. Trade.—The pearl trade ended the year with a 25 per cent, to 30 per cent, improvement, improved prices compensating for a disappointing yield Had the decline of the three preceding years continued half the Islands would have gone bankrupt but the close of the year found men willing to lend again and a more cheerful note prevailed. The big buyers maintain that there has been no equivalent rise in the European market, but as buyers it is not m t icu interest to think otherwise. There is little doubt that the exceptionally calm autumn greatly helped the Badda, or closing season, and many divers are said to hci vg done rnncli better during tliis period, when they CJtn dive with whom they please, than in the main season or ‘ ghaus ’ when they must dive for their nakhudahs. It will be some time before their earnings are transformed into increased imports, but benefit to trade should come. 41. In this successful radda, Bahrain seems to have benefited more than her neighbours, as the mainland' boMs, who will not go out to deep water once the main season is over have little good to report. 42. The total value of trade amounted to Bs. 1,69,82.270 as compared with Bs. 1,71,20,220 in the preceding vear. The total value of imports amounted to Bs'. 1,05,82,710 as against Bs. 1,04,61,880 and the exports to Bs. 63,99,560 asr ' ^ rT *WStM 46 against Ks. 66,58,340 for the preceding year. The figures of exports are not accurate since few of the pearls exported are declared at heir proper value, and those carried on the person are not declared at all. The figures for specie also are not reliable. 43 Indastru The tile industry closed down, being unable to dispose of accumulated stocks. The tiles are good and very cheap, but the times are against the purchase of anything but necessities. 44. Ahmad bin Yusuf• Fakhru, with the encouragement of the Agency, has opened a Morris Agency and has Sold a Minor arid two Cowley saloons. The springing of the latter is an immense improvement on the old model, and if only touting models were available be would do much better. The more expensive models have no sale at present. 45 Athletics.—The interest in football continues to increase and some of the young Al-lvhaiifah join in the gafne.' Oricket also has some devotees^ principally Indians or young men educated in India. 46. Boat Building and Shipping.—^he, total number of launches plying for hire on the 31st December was 62. 47. Sixteen sailing vessels were built during the year as compared with thirty-two built during 1931. 48. One hundred and fifty-one British ships, eleven German and three Norwegian entered and cleared the Port of Bahraiu as , compared with one-- hundred and seventeen British Ships, eleven Gcnnan ships and two Norwegian ships that entered and cleared the Port of Bahrain during 1931. 49. A launch belonging to the Shaikh of Tibbin which was returning there with merchandize, caught fire on the 26ih August on the pearl banks not far from Bahrain, and was completely destroyed, fortunately without loss of life. The engine was a German one supplied by Yusuf Fakhru, and the incident is not likely to enhance their sales. 50. The Qusaibis sold a big launch to His Majesty Bin Sahid and it suc cessfully made the voyage to Jeddah, reaching Muscat in fotir days from Bahrain. 51. The year was notable for the advent of three special steamers, the u Marly ” on the 27th January, the “ Fagervick ” on the 27th April and the u Ahmedi ’ ’ on the 27th October. The two last named carried direct cargo for Anmeui on me znn uctooer. . me two last named carried direct cargo ior mainland ports,, and the “ Ahmedi ” was refused permission to discharge anv cargo at Bahrain as she declined to guarantee that the mainland cargo would pay the customary two per cent, transit duty. 52. The competition of these steamers with the British India Steam Navigation _ Company, Limited, Is a very serious matter for the Gulf. The regular mail service, first of all monthly and then fori nightly and weekly has eon the creation of the Gulf trade as we know it now, and ships such as these in ruders which carry ^cargo for possibly the two best ports onlv cause great oss to the British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited, at a time when n}} can i . afford it. By their mail contract the Company are obliored to call r .°k P ? rt V V llcl1 F- ]oT12 ‘ n r ailv trade worth mentioning, and they are thereby handicapped m dealing with these competitors. . .

Aviation .—Imperial Airways decided to transfer their line to the Arab Coast and the first flight was due to pass through Bahrain on the 6 th October. 1 he first aeroplane, Hanno, duly arrived but sank into the treacherous surface of the Manamah aerodrome and only freed itself next dav after tremendous efforts. Imperial Airways had been warned of the surface of this aerodrome, but unaccountably paid no heed, nor did they send a Hannibal pilot to investi gate until a fortnight before the first aeroplane was due. When this pilot came, he pronounced the aerodrome as unsuitable, but his recommendations were ignored with this untoward result. The Company then obtained permission from the State to use the Muharraq aerodrome, but by the end of the year neither had the location of a permanent aerodrome being decided, nor had * the Company completed the equipping of their Rest House. 58. ^ British Interests. —Mr. J. Russell of the Mesopotamia Persia Corpora tion, Limited, held charge throughout the year. The Landing Company, the property of the British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited, but run bv tins firm, lost throughout the year, the visits of the “ Marlv ” and “ Fagervick ” (neither of whom utilized their services) causing additional loss. The Landing Company, like the Mail Service, are a vital necessity for Bahrain, since thev and they alone possess craft large enough to handle very bulky cargo and crews prepared to take their boats out in boisterous weather. 59. Mr. D. Ham held charge of the Eastern Bank throughout the year. The new premises were opened on the 23rd June and represent a new era in Bahrain building, being constructed of steel and reinforced concrete. 60. Complaints against the unduly high rates charged by the An Ho Persian Oil Company, Limited, for petrol continue to be made. Halii ly F- Mhlhamson and Mr. Luard visited Bahrain during the year, and Mr. Mylles passed through Bahrain after securing an exploration concession from the Shaikh of Qatar. i C^ce.—During the year 3,907 registered letters were received and 8,201 despatched as compared with 3,566 registered letters received and 3 080 espatched during the previous year. 3,907 parcels were received and 271 despatched and Rs. 12,164-2-0 worth of stamps were sold. Cash Certificates worth Rs. .18,080-12-0 were sold and Rs. 7,028-9-6 were discharged. British Postal Orders Rs. 952-1-6 were sold and Rs; 31-13-6 paid. Savings Bank to Rs. 41,347-15-3 and Money Orders for Rs. 1,21,142-6-6 Rs. 5,628-4-6 paid. Certificates worth to the value of deposits amounted were issued and Articles despatched by the West bound Air Mail weighed 35.960 kilogrammes and by the East bound Air Mail 29.000 kilogrammes. 62 Mr Bashiruddm was replaced in October by Mr. Zafar Husain, who was formerly at Bahrain. Mr. Bashiruddin suffered from a mild form of religious mama and caused considerable annoyance to the public and the Agencv and finally, it is believed to the Postal Department itself. j M e d\ ca l' Assistant Surgeon R. Holmes held charge throughout the year and did excellent work. It is interesting to note that Bahama women, the most ignorant and bigoted inhabitants of the Islands, come'to Dr. Holmes’ hospital more readily than to the American Mission Women’s Hospital. 64. The total number of cases treated during the year, compared with the previous year, were :—- Outdoor patients • 1931. 13,070 1932. 14,614 Indoor patients . # 244 278 Major and Minor Operations • . 1,038 709 65. 32,376 outdoor patients and 387 indoor patients were treated at the Men’s Hospital of the American Mission during the year and 515 Maior and Minor operations were performed. .. 66 ; k r - b p -Dame proceeded to Taif on the 20th May to attend a favorite wit© of Bm-Sa ud’s, returning on the 2 nd August.

C. W. Fowle C.B.E Political Eesrdent in the Persian Gulf, also visited Bahrain on an officmljnsit from tte December, accompanied by Mr. J. Cronmg, M.B.E., Under Secretary. 79 Philin Sassoon, Under Secretary of State for Air, passed th G BaWIn TaSy He was to have spent a night here but recemng an unfavourable weather report postponed his arrival a day and only halted for an hour or so. He was much struck by the relative cleanliness of Manamah, compared with Baghdad. _ '. _ , 73. Other visitors were the Shaikh of Kuwait, who accompanied Sir kLugn Biscoe in January, a somewhat embarrassing visit. 74. Monsieur Georges Cassin, French Consul at Bushire, arrived on the 19th of March and left on the 26th. 75. Mr. K. S. Twitchell, an American Prospector, believed to be in the pay of Crane, the American bathroom millionaire, arrived from Hasa on the /tn January. 76. The number of Indian beggars has somewhat reduced, and no disreput able Europeans visited Bahrain during the year, thereby showing that the Passport restrictions have borne fruit. 77. Sa’udi Arabia.—'The outstanding point of interest wms the Hon’hle Eient.-Colonel Sir Hugh Biscoe’s visit to Bin Sa’ud at Hofuf, accompanied by the Political Agent, Captain C. G. Prior, and Lieut.-Colonel H. E. P. Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Kuwait. The visit was interesting, the apparent friend liness of Bin Sa’ud contrasting with the sour looks of his followers. The party left Hofnf on a characteristic note of savagery 7 , seeing, a hand and foot of two men mailed over the town gate as they went out. The men had been caught stealing camels, and owed their lives to the clemency 7 of Bin Sa’nd, Bin Jihiwi, the redoubtable Amir of Hasa, having wished to put them to death. 78. The Amir Mansur, a.thirteen year old son of Bin Sa’ud, visited Bahrain on the 14th January for medical treatment. 79. Muhammad-al-Tawwil rented the Hasa Customs for eleven lakhs in January, but was unable to secure this figure and was obliged to ask for it to be reduced. The Province, more especially Qatif, has been reduced to destitution by the impositions of Bin Sa’nd, who has killed the goose that laid the golden eggs with remarkable skill. But for the prevention of the emigration of women, the hulk of the population would have fled to Bahrain long ago. 80. Abdul Aziz Qusaibi went on Hajj in February, his purpose being tfi pxfract some money from Bin Sa’ud. In this he failed, and the Qusaibis have10 0rs are 4 }SSar }' cloii iniorop^: t the year, ^m'oerefj fronithei toes bt^, 2 ,lil { uits 415 as { Bring | e r 'lo Lieut,-Cd; t, paid an 4 aigallay oi iods on it! r’s Mmste is deal oi • i, who felt is onsiderects realised ki olitical U: itheatltoi tary. passed tlE .f dy anied Sir l arrived ® '• o beinth? tasa ob th ,nd no dhrf ^ing tfe 5 the U iccompa* R.

The enormous sum of money thus tied up with Bin Sa’ud has undoubtedly weakened them, and though their influence in Bahrain is still very strong they are much more easily handled than before. Abdullah Qusaibi has permitted himself some most violent remarks about his Monarch, which will doubtless reach the Royal ears. 81. Messrs. Boucicault and Calder employee^ of the Marconi Company arrived on the 26th April and paid one or two other visits to Bahrain. Ihey had experienced great difficulty with their Lsa tl di personnel, and mentioned the incident of a simple private of the line who had been promoted mechanic o meritorious behaviour. They_ erected stations at Jubail and Qaaf bungi &amp; t number in Bin Sa’ud’s dominions to eighteen. 82. Muhammad-al-Tawwil studiously avoided the Agency on his visits ^ TRnVirnin ns do almost all Naidi officials, but visited the Hon ole the Political leffident on one occasion on board a Mail Steamer. Bin Sa’ud had apparently tacitly accepted the claim of the Bahrain Government to two per cent, tranship ment dues oil all cargo passing through Bahrain waters, Tawwil was instructed to pay (3rd Septembei) on a consign! , TA , of rice and 600 hags of sugar that came through for the mainland, but latei m conimiction with MuhamnSid-al-Marzuk .oP Karachi he “ Ahmedi ” to take some 20,000 bags of rice direct to the mainland. The Bah a Government declined to allow this steamer to land Bahrain which was overcarried to the mainland. Tawwil, with an eye no doubt to t uuie ship ments allowed it to be stored free and brought back to Bahrain wndiont payment of any duty and is said to have erected a Customs shed at Bas lanaurah, and to have offered merchants free transhipments should they hrmg other consign- ments there. 83. Bahrain is a Naboth’s vineyard for the King of Sa’udi Arabia. 04 . Dntnr The Political Agent paid several visits to Qatar, two being in connetiion mTh an emergency aerodrome near Dohah. The Shaikh had agreed to this subiect to being granted an additional measure of protection, but v 101 his wish was acceded to he then produced other reasons for being unable to gian it 86 The Political Agent successfully closed the cases which bad caused trouble with the Shaikh at the end of the proceeding year, and pleasant relations with the Shaikh were restored. 86 Slavery Twenty slaves were manumitted during the yeai, cmp oy- ment being found for some in the Bahrain Police. Nothing of interest occurred in this connection during the year. 87 Climate —The rainfall amounted to 2.70 inches, the year being some what cooler than its predecessor. The most striking features were an excep- ttonally calm January and autumn, the latter being very favourable to the raddah. ... . ,, ino1 • „ 88 Cpm pml The vear ended with a more optimistic note than 1931, ownv, to the impro—t in the l“al pearl market, and the Bahrain Government having won back in the divers’ riot the prestige they had lost over the agitations of February, concluded the year in a stronger position than they have hitherto enjoyed, despite their financial difficulties. 89 The year has on tbe whole been more satisfactory than 1931, and the inhabitants of 6 Bahrain are possibly even better deposed to tte Agency ttan before. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bm Isa-Al-Khalifah is a loial menu His Majesty’s Government and deserves well ol them. G.

Easy was in charge, Dr. Greenway having proceeded on leave to the United Kingdom. II. —The Ruling Family. (a) The Ruler His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmed-al-Jabir-al-Subah, KC.I.E. C.S.I., has managed his State during the year under review with ability and success. He has maintained correct and friendly relations wifh his two powerful neighbours, the Kingdom of Iraq and the Kingdom of Saudiyah (Hejaz-Nejd), lying to the north and south of his territory respectively ; in spite of' the dis appointing policy of the former in the matter of the Al-Subah date gardens on the Shatt-al-Arab, and other matters on the one hand, and the close trade blockade on the land side, by the forces of His Majesty King Bin Saud, whose avowed object would still appear to be either to force Kuwait to acknowledge him as suzerain by the simple process of strangulation or to destroy her economically. The closeness of the blockade, which during the year was placed under the control of the notoriously harsh and cruel Governor of Hassa, the Amir Abdulla ibn Jiloui, and so became perhaps tighter than ever before, coupled with the failure of the 1932 Pearl Season, for the fourth year in succession, has reduced Kuwait to such a state of poverty and distress that it has required all the skill and patience of the Ruler to prevent the hot-headed members of his family from attempting retaliatory measures in the form of intrigues with the Border Tribes tins was especially the case during Ibn Rifada’s rebellion against Bin Saud in Aonli He jaz, when undoubtedly efforts were made by those behind the Ibn Rifada movement to take advantage of the bitterness felt in Kuwait against Bin Saud, to start surreptitious trouble m the north-east corner of the King’s dominions. nomdnrH v^ Pnl^ th the internal situation that his personal this , Inibtff ! t f n&lt;?S l? h am0ng the StabIe elements of the Town : motl the y® 1- '; nder review &gt; h e has had to adopt that most unpopular &lt; xpedient m the eyes of an Arab of cutting down the salaries and ^iusSeT^t tr U T m r berS ° f his famiI &gt; r &lt;°°™ 200 « number)? as State forces (Ydawiyeh)! “ 16 WaS ® S of hls sew wts.

(if) The Director of Customs, Ynsuf bin Yassin al Yacub continues to do satisfactory wove and after 21 years trial retains the full confidence of the Euler. (Hi) During the year under review several important improvements have been eiiected m the internal administration of the Customs Department. These were mostly connected with the more efficient working of the office and with cer tain economy measures which the Euler desired to see carried out. (w) The port “Lighter” service has continued to work well and the arrangement introduced last year whereby no boats go out to steamers until the lauer have cast anchor has earned the praise of masters of ships. Lighters now all sail out ogether under the control of a single person who gives the sKual for sans to he hoistea and the lighters to work. The new system has successfully done away with the fight for position alongside ships which used to be such a uature of the port oi Kuwait. Captains of ships have shown their appreciation ot the oltorts mane to control boats by making a point of coming right into the harbour and anchoring off the Political Agency. (v) Customs receipts continue to show a steady decline and this will con tinue so long as Bin Baud’s Trade Blockade is allowed to continue. (vi) During the year a certain amount of contraband traffic has existed with 1 ersia and Lejd where prices have ruled high ; this has tended, somewhat, to raise the Customs receipts for 1932 hut only slightly. Very little contraband, on the other hand, has been carried across the Iraq border, as lar as one can see, because of the efficient system of frontier car patrols winch Iraq has provided and because low prices in Iraq offer less induce ment to contraband runners than those ruling in Nejd and Persia. (b) Municipality.—(i) The improvements in the cleanliness and sanitation ot the^ town which were such a remarkable feature of 1932 have been maintained and Kuwait to-day is probably the cleanest town in the Persian Gulf not except ing Basra ; certainly it is the healthiest. His Excellency the Shaikh continues to show the greatest interest in the Municipality and municipal improvements generally and ably supports the very worthy Municipal Secretary, Sulaiman al Adsani, a man of enere-y and “ nush ’’ not usually seen among Arabs. P (H) The electrification of Kuwait Town, foreshadowed in this Agency’s last Administration Eeport as certain for the autumn of 1932, unfortunately failed to materialize owing to the bankruptcy of the Baghdad firm which had received the contract. Another Baghdad firm, however, stepped into the breach and the end of the year saw the erection, all over the town of electric “ standards ” to carry the wiring, etc. It is anticipated that the Spring of 1933 will see Kuwait first “ power ” supply functioning. (Hi) The Political Agent still continues active in his propaganda for muni cipal improvements, and the results achieved have been little short of marvellous. Lc338FD52 T}1P old conservative replies of “ leave well alone ” and “ what has been good Ihe old eonseixd i en 0 U p-h for us ”, and “ God will arrange for tlie enough fo [ h of t f ie c it v ” have now all gone. The satisfactory feature abouHt all L“that Political Agent, beyond talking and pointing out certain ad- vantages etc , has done nothing. The active demand for improvements has come from the’people themselves. Nevertheless Kuwait has still very far to go in matters of cleanliness and sanitation of the interior of houses, which at present are quite outside the respon sibilities of the Municipal Committee or its keen Secretary. (c) Impend Airways.-(l) On 28fih October the first plane (Eastboimd) from London to Karachi landed at Kuwait and picked up passengers. A large crowd of persons including His Excellency the Shaikh the European community and the leading inhabitants of the Town collected on the aerodrome to watch the huge machine arrive As the aircraft was before time a delay of an hour was made at Kuwait during v/hich the public were allowed to inspect the interior of the machine. This thoughtful act was much appreciated and was an excellent form of pro- pagauda. ( 2 ) From 28th October to the 22nd December, East and West bound planes only called at Kuwait to pick up or put down intending passengers—No mails were taken or delivered. On the Shaikh and Political Agent making representation in the matter the Company agreed as from the 22nd December to make Kuwait a permanent port of call both for mails and passengers, for a period of 6 months as an experimental measure. (3) Kuwait now has its regular air mail service which is most popular with both Europeans and Arabs and it is hoped it will become a permanence. ( 4 ) At the moment the question of rates is troubling the travelling public somewhat as £4 is charged between Kuwait and Basrah (80 miles) and £8 between Kuwait and Bahrain (300 miles). It is hoped by the writer that he will succeed in getting these rates altered to £2 and £6 respectively. (5) His Excellency the Shaikh has intimated that after 6 months if the Com pany decides 1 o make Kuwait a permanent port of call, he will build a small rest house for passengers free of charge. (d) Boat Building Trade. —1. This has been somewhat more prosperous than during 1931. Several important orders for ocean-going “ Bums ” or dhows came and livened up the ship industry. 2 . A note on the number, tonnage, etc. of boats built has been given in the year’s trade report and can be referred to if necessary. 3. The following types of boats were all built during the year under re view :— “ Bagala “ Bum 11 Sumbuq ”. “ Shu’wal ”. “ Jelboot “ Mashua ”. 4. No u Batils ” were laid down. 5. His Excellency not satisfied with the size of the vacht which was built for him in 1931 and desiring to give a fillip to the rather depressed boat biuldin? industry, had another yacht, some 80 feet in length, built for him. The hull was completed by tne ena of the year but the launching ceremony has yet to take place- The new yacht has been designed according to European standards and looks to have good lines. The 75 H. P. Thornycroft Internal Combustion engine now fitted m the Shaikh s old yacht will be taken out and put into the nev T craft the old vessel being converted into a sailing dhow. l l Reason.- The pearl industry is of course the most important that Kuwait possesses. About 10,000 men with their families are dependent ioi their living on the annual “ Ghaus ” or “ Dive ” Other industries such as boat- ,) T lc ^ ill V’-, Sc *j!~ mc d'irg, manufacture of shark’s oil, etc., are sympatheticall) affected by the prosperity or otherwise of the pearl market.The \ ears 1929 ’30 and ’31 were all bad seasons and many of the smaller pearl merchants and boat-owners were mined during these years. The year 1932 threatened to be even worse than the previous three as there appeared no signs that Europe and America would buy pearls and there was a widespread pessimism at the commencement of the season. °ut of 700 pearling boats possessed by Kuwait only 250 were able to put to sea. These departed at the end of May and during the first week in June. The 5 a jL b a or departure of the fleet was therefore somewhat of a fiasco.’ The ’ Kutlal or official closing of the season was fixed by the Ruler for 23rd Sep tember and the latter proceeded to the banks in person to give the signal to close the “ dive 7 \ There was some trouble among the sailors and divers of the Town at the com mencement of the Pearl Season over the question of the “ Salef ” (advances) which they are always entitled to for the support of their families during their absence. The desperate state of the pearl boat-owners due to severe lack of money forced these to arrange a combine with a view to cutting down the amount of money advances which it was customary for them to give. The divers natu rally objected strongly and refused to put to sea unless adequate assistance was given them. They maintained and with justice that their families must have suffi cient to support themselves with during their 4 months’ absence. The Shaikh was forced to intervene and by public proclamation made on 25th May ordered that Rs. 37 should be given to each “ diver ” (ghais) as his advance, and Rs. 32 to each “ hauler ” (Saib) during 1932. This though little enough, was far better than the boat-owners were prepared to give. In the various discussions that took place between the Ruler and the Nakhudas (Captains of boats) over this vexed question, the Shaikh very wisely took the side of the divers and this final decision was accepted as fair. Fortunately for Kuwait the pearl season of 1932 turned out better than it has been for the last three years ; though still nowhere near what it should be. There was a fair demand for second and third class pearls in India as well as for pearls of large and perfect quality. Speaking generally also the 1932 catch was mostly sold. Where merchants were hit, however, was their continued failure to get rid of their 1929, ’30, ’31 stock of pearls. These were bought for high prices and naturally no merchant wanted to sell these for less than he gave hence all held on, hoping for something better in 1933. This means, of course, locked up capital and almost “ certain ” eventual loss, unless there is a “ miracle boom ” in the pearl market in the near future. It must not be forgotten that the value of pearls depreciates according to the num ber of years pearls remain unsold. The Shaikh stated again that he was seriously contemplating asking His Majesty’s Government to call a conference of representatives of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Sa’udiyah with a view to conserve the oyster resources of the upper end of the Persian Gulf (Arab Littoral). His view is that for a start the Rulers of the abovementioned States should agree together to ban the “ Khanchiyah ” and “ Radda ” dives ; that is to say prevent the small fleets of amateurs proceeding to the banks for a month or three weeks previous to and immediately after the great “ Dive ” (Ghaus) as at pre sent is the universal practice. Later on and if the plan is a success the same Rulers may be persuaded to leave certain banks entirely alone for certain periods to enable them to recover. This last arrangement, according to the Shaikh, would entail frequent visits of His Majesty’s warships to the reserved banks to enforce the rules. (/) Electrification of the Political Agency Buildings .—During May the Electric Plant sanctioned by the Government of India for the Political Agent’s house was finally erected by Messrs. Osier and Co. of Bombay and Calcutta. On 3.1st May official trials and tests were carried out and lights and fans started working as from the 1st June 1932. On 4th June the Agency Medical Officer’s house was connected up with the Agency. This was indeed a “ Red Letter ” day for the Agency : for in previous years paraffin lamps and hand-pulled pun- khas had been the order. (g) Neiv Agency Buildings .—Work was started by the Public Works Depart ment on the New Agency in Kuwait in August of 1932. This was another red letter day in the Annals of the Political Agency.54 (h) Povcrii) and Economy Measures .—World depression, the continued lack of relief from Bin Sand’s blockade, and the last three years failure of the pearl trade have at last had their effect on Kuwait. During the year 1932 there was a marked increase in the number of pearl bankruptcies. Suffeiing and acute want among the lower classes of the town was a new and pathetic feature, and showed itself m the form of gangs of beggars, who began to roam the Town. The situation was aggravated by the sudden arrival in August of some 2,000 starving Persian refugees, driven across to the Arab Coast from their own countrv bv hunger and the callousness of their own officials. These persons tilled the streets and by-ways, imploring all and sundry to assist them. This influx was again followed by an invasion of poor Persian fishermen who began to interfere with the fishing rights and nets of the local Kuwait fraternity. Matters came to such a pass that the Ruler, on the urgent^representations of his people who complained that they had enough poor of their own to support, was constrained to order all Persians without visible means of support to be re patriated to their own country. This was done at the end of August and the refugees were conveyed in dhows free of charge to Gusbah on the left bank of the Shaft al Arab. The Persian fishermen were also ordered to leave the bay of Kuwait and for bidden to enter the 3-mile limit along the Kuwait sea-board. On the ]5th August the Ruler decided on a general reduction of officials’ salaries by approximately 20 per cent., thus following the example of Bahrain. The reduction affected the salaries of all the many Shaikhs of the house of Al Subah, including that of many ladies of high birth, and went right down the scale of officials so as to include guards, mercenaries and private servants. The Ruler told the writer that he had been compelled to adopt these economy measures much against his will because of the grave condition of the finances of the State which had laterly been nearing danger point. (i) Locusts .—The first flight of these pests passed over Kuwait on 24th Feb ruary. It moved in a north-westerly direction and took 24 hours to pass over the Town. An official of His Majesty King Bin Saud, who arrived in Kuwait on 27th February 1932, reported that he had seen large flights of locusts in Qasira and South Hassa at the end of January and early in February. His Majesty King Bin Saud personally told the writer that Hoffuf had had a bad visitation in January. It was anticipated that March would see the insect plague on the borders of Kuwait and Iraq. Fortunately for the State this did not happen and the dread invasions of the three previous years were not re peated. Mr. Urarov, Locust Expert to the British Museum visited Kuwait on 23rd May and collected data regarding locust visitations and their lines of approach from south-west Arabia up through Nejd. Curiously enough he prophesied that Kuwait wouid see no locusts in 1932 as all evidence went to prove that they appeared in cycles of 3 years at a time. His prophesy came true. iqq 9 U V a n ^ 0 l Kuwait ’^Je.-During the late Autumn of 19o2 and after some delays the long expected ground survey of Kuwait com- RnKfM-Fhti 6 R sp v. 1 5 e a 0f K apt , ain Papworth, E.E., attached to Headquarters, ho&gt;ai Air Force, Baghdad.

His Majesty the King did not come out of the business with credit ; for relying on the reports of some miserable spys of his in Kuwait, he thought tit to address several distinctly impolite letters to the Shaikh of Kuwait on the matter, which rankled considerably. Tt may be remarked in passing that overland pilgrims proceeding to Mecca (God’s House) are not interfered with by religious custom or sanction and are not required to have their baggage examined. It would normally be a sinful thing for any of Bin Saud’s people to do this. But Arabian Kings apparently are above the law. V.—Fokeign Interests. (Russian eeeorts to get into Kuwait). During the year under review two attempts were again made by the repre sentatives of the Soviet Company known as the “ Sharq ” of Mohammerah to persuade the Ruler to allow Russian ships to call at Kuwait. They employed merchants of Mohammerah for the purpose. These wrote letters to the Shaikh showing how advantageous it would be from the Shaikh’s point of view if Russian ships could be allowed to call and bring cheap goods to his Town. The Ruler rejected these advances out of hand. VI. —Condition of the country. (Law and Order). 1. This has been satisfactory and the good progress made in 1931 over 1930 has been maintained. As reported a year ago the reasons for this improved state of affairs may be summarized as below :— {a) The advent of the motor car, which enable the most inaccessible corners of the State to be regularly visited by the Shaikh’s armed Ford cars ; (b) The control maintained by the Iraq Government over their tribes in the Southern Desert, more especially the wilder Dhafir Sections, and the watchful eye which is kept on the shepherd tribes by their own Government when they enter Kuwait territory ; (c) The sympathy felt for Kuwait by the north-east tribes of Arabia as a result of the blockade, which has resulted in a wide and tacit arrangement among the Bedouins to do nothing to hurt the people of Kuwait or its small tribal community ; (d) The general hatred and distrust felt for Bin Sand to-day by the north-east transborder Nejd tribes, notably the Awazim, Ajman and Mutair, who now, more than ever, look to Kuwait with affec tion and regard and count the time not far distant when they will once more come under the control of their old lord and master, the Shaikh of Kuwait : this fact perhaps, more than any other, has a stabilizing effect in the hinterland and acts as a wholesome deterrent to anyone minded to raid and start a course of mis behaviour. (e) The fact that the Political Agent makes frequent tours into the hinterland, camps among the Bedouins and generally shows him self. This breeds a spirit of confidence and a growing belief that His Majesty’s representative would not be moving about in the hinterland and among the wild and woolly Arab unless by orders of the great British Government. 2. The following few incidents were dealt with during the year under review :— (a) On 14th March and during the Ruler’s absence in Riath as the guest of the King, the latter’s frontier officer Ibn Khraimis detached a party of 12 men under a negro officer named Mubarak into the Kuwait neutral zone with orders to move about and seize and Nejd tribesmen coming out from Kuwait with supplies, as well as pursue any Nejd tribal parties into Kuwait territory, who might be prospective blockade runners. On 15th March this officer crossed into Kuwait territory proper and basing himself at the wells of Lc338FDUm al Hi man near Shaiba, a village on the road and fully 8 miles inside the frontier started way-laying all and sundry and seizing their flocks and camels, irrespective of who they were. This took place close to the camp of the Political Agent who was touring the Southern frontier at the time. Steps were at once taken to eject these gentry and recover the flocks, but Mubarak was too quick and slipped across the border again. In the pursuit which followed the raiders were come up with near Wafra, in the Kuwait neutral Zone and a strong protest was made at the flagrant violation of the frontier. Bin Sand’s officer haughtily informed the Shaikh’s men that he intended going where he pleased as his orders were to follow Xejdis right into Kuwait territory including any parties suspected of going up to buy supplies and to seize and confiscate their camels. Mubarak was duly warned that he would do so at his peril Letters of protest were sent in by the Shaikh’s Deputy and Bin Baud’s Trade Agent in Kuwait to Ibn Khraimis, the King’s frontier officer and the latter subsequently apologised in suitable language. The confiscated sheep and camels were never recovered, nor was any compensation paid. (b) On the 31st March a water dispute took place at Uglat ibn Sigai wells in the north-west Kuwait territory, between the Amir of the Shaikh’s Fa da why ah and some Dhafir tribesmen of Iraq. The latter refused to allow the Kuwaiti tribesmen to water their animals and a fight ensued. The matter was reported to the Political Agent who was able to prevent it assuming important dimensions. Necessary representations were made to the Iraq authorities through the Administration Inspector, Basra, and the Dhafir were ordered to preserve the peace and obey the Amir’s orders, or return to their own country. VII. —Relations with Sa’udiyah and the Blockade of Kuwait. (a) In spite of severity of the blockade and the apparently unchanged intention of His Majesty King Bin Sand to bend Kuwait to his will by continuing to prevent all caravan communications with the interior, as well as by the strict banning of Kuwait to all his own tribesmen personal relations between the two Rulers have outwardly been good during the year under review. (b) Except for the affair of 14th March [see section VI (11-a) above! the unnecessary severe treatment of the Kuwait Haj pilgrims [see IV (k) above] fn frlv twT 0f l 40 shce ? b eJ?“Wto a Kuwaiti merchant by Ibn Khraimis in iL.d\ there ha\ e been no frontier incidents of importance.

(t&gt;) The Shaikh of Kuwait visited Baghdad on 21st August on a private visit to His Majesty King Feisal. The Political Agent accompamed him a S far as Basrah The Shaikh was well received by His Majesty and by all officials with whom he came in contact and the visit may be said to have been success nl as far as it went. On his departure the Shaikh was invested with the Order T?nfiHnin 1 st Class. IX.— Relations with Peesia. These have not changed in any way from previous years. The Persian Central Government continues to refuse to recognize Kuwait and Kuwait reciprocates by having as little to do with her awkward neighbour as possible. Unfortunately the passport question continues to provide the irritant from which “ an incident ” is always possible. Any Kuwaiti going direct to Mohammerah or other Persian port has his Kuwait certificate of Identity torn up by the local Persian authorities and is fined, on the excuse that the Persian Government does not recognize Kuwait. Similarly any Persian visiting Kuwait from a Persian port brings along the “ Ilm-o-Khabar ” or yellow piece of paper, permitting the traveller to proceed from the Persian Port of so and so to the Persian Port of Kuwait. On bis arrival this paper is confiscated and he is given a Kuwait Certificate of Identity on which the traveller is shown as a Persian subject on a visit to Kuwait. (a) During the year the Persian Government has made two efforts to get its court ‘ summons ’ served on persons in Kuwait. These, under orders from the Political Resident, have been refused. (b) The advent of Persian men-of-war in the Persian Gulf has caused some hard thinking to be done by the people of Kuwait. The Persians, they say, are quite capable of committing a folisli act of aggression against any Aral) State without thought of the consequences. They are, on the other hand, not over-confident that His Majesty’s Government will ‘ see them through ’ if sucli incident happened. X. —Oil interests. The year 1932 opened with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, enter ing the field in opposition to the Eastern and General Syndicate, Limited, as re presented by Major Frank Holmes. Lariy in February the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, got permission from the Shaikh to send down two geologists, a Mr. Cox and Air. Tate, to make a superficial surface survey of Kuwait territory'. at They weTe followed at the end of February bv Mr. Shaw, Head Geologist 1 ields ’ who made an aerial survey of the Principality. of m/ 1 p T 0t U .aikh. Air. Shaw also started a shallow surface 1101 1 Qo le n f the ha A and followed it up with a shallow bore at Burgan, 32 miles south of Kuwait, Mr. Cox was in of these operations which continued well into April59 ^ theiesK Qn ^’ateri 118 Post at I Nation of | tfover^- t T gnaraiij August ob r ccompaDieii 7 andkajj lave kns® ded will | ■s. 0 reeogiiizt: awkward e le tlie irrik 1 going I ite of M .se tktiif ian visitii': How pieced of so and ; ited and if; drown as a: i two effef under oi jf lias # Persians, P against i lie other k a throng! • On the 14th April the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, abandoned these- operations much to the disappointment of the Ruler. On the 24th May 1932 Major Holmes was told that he could renew his application tor an Oil concession hitherto held up bv His Majesty’s Govern- ruent’s insistence on the 1 British Nationality Clause On the 25th May Major Holmes submitted a fresh draft concession to the Shaikh and sent a copy to the Honourable the Political Resident. On 25th June after two visits to Kuwait by Mr. Gass, the Deputv General Manager of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the Shaikh was informed that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had received fresh instructions from London to prepare and submit a draft Oil concession without delay. This was presented to the Shaikh on 19th August. Then followed an examination, in London, of the two Companies’ draft concessions by His Majesty’s Government’s experts. At the end of December His Majesty’s Government sent out, to the Shaikh a lengthy letter consisting of a comparison between the draft Oil concessions submitted by the Eastern and General Syndicate and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, limited, together with the considered comments and observations of His Majesty’s Government, as far as the financial advantages offered bv each Company were concerned. These observations of His Majesty’s Government were duly passed on to the Shaikh on 8 th January 1933, and here for the moment the matter stands. XI. —Posts and Telegraphs. The Post and Telegraph service in Kuwait continued to be run by the Iraq Government during 1932. This arrangement is no longer satisfactory or desirable now that Iraq has become independent. As a result of protracted negotiations carried out during 1932 His Majesty’s Government, at the end of the year, decided to inform the’Iraq Government that His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait was prepared to enter into an agreement with Iraq for the Iraq Post and Telegraphs Department to administer the Post and Telegraph Department of Kuwait under certain con ditions. These above were conveyed to the Iraq Government on 12 th Januarv l&lt;m hut to date no reply has been received. ' ’ ’ ’ .XII,— Political Agext’s Tours. During the year under review the Political Agent again went all over the State by car and. visited practically every important point on the Kuwait- 8 aTidiyah frontier. In addition one comprehensive tour was made of the Kuwait Neutral Zone. The object of the Political Agent in making these tours was to show him self to the tribes and to familiarize himself with hinterland affairs, the state of wells, grazing areas, and movements of the various Bedouin sections. The keeping up of such ‘ tours ’ is in the opinion of the writer an important duty of the Political Agent ; as above all they breed confidence amorm the Nomadic population and show trans-border officials and persons bent on mischief that the Political Agent is ‘ wide awake ’ ; and is working in dose co-operation with the Ruler of Kuwait and his people. XIII.— Agency Charitable Dispensary. a y Li# ( ri ) Work done during the year 1932, —There were a total of 10,015 at ten jj 0 , dances made up as follows :— Adults el Mr- 6 ’ Children males 3,221 females 2735 males 2,295 females 1,764 1 4 minor operations were carried out.

On 7th April at 3-30 a.m. the British India Steam Navigation s.s. “ Bamora ” ran ashore on Auha Island 30 miles E. S. E. of Kuwait. His Excellency the Shaikh, at the request of the Political Agent rendered effective assistance by means of lighters and sailing craft, hut owing to the distance and the lack of wind they only reached the scene of the accident late in the evening. During the night of 7|8th April H. M. S. “ Shoreham ” which was standing by managed to tow the “ Bamora ” off. XVIII.’ —Meteorological.

DICKSON, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuivait. Le338FD—46—12-8-33—GIPS3 CONFIDENTIAL. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE SIMLA GOVERNMENT OF INDIA PRESS 1934CJQNFXDENTIAI*. Letter from the XI on 'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 455-S. of 1934, dated the 13th May 1934. I have the honour to forward herewith the Annual Administration Report of this Residency for the year 1933,Arab Side. w Aviation.—Imperial Airways continued their weekly service—East and VVest -tJn oughout the year and with the exception of a few forced landings no incidents of a serious nature took place. Kuwait is now included as a regular port of call. Royal Air Force Flying Boats continued to patrol the coast during the year and a few flights of land machines were also made. The long flight from Gwadur across the Arabian Sea to Sharjah is proving an awkward obstacle to cope with since the necessity for carrying large sup^ plies of petrol compels the restriction of the number of passengers carried. For political reasons the Arabian route is still closed to private aviators. Cruise of the First Destroyer Flotilla in the Persian Gulf .—From Septem ber to October 1933 the First Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet made a cruise of the Persian Gulf visiting Henjam, Basidu, the Trucial Coast, Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat. The cruise of this force created a good impres sion on the Arab side. Oil Interests .—Competition for the Kuwait Oil Concession was carried out by the rival companies—the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Eastern and General Syndicate--until May, when the Shaikh declared that he had decided to give it to neither party for the time being. By the end of the year the Angio- Persian Oil Company and the Eastern and General Syndicate had decided to join forces under the title of the Kuwait Oil Company and approach the Shaikh for a concession. The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain, continued actively to exploit their concession in erecting buildings, plants, and sinking of well. Dur ing the year a number of wells were sunk which were understood to give pro mise of a good yield of oil and the Company contemplated shipping oil from the middle of 1934. The Company during the year introduced a number of British subjects amongst their personnel and as regards their superior staff these numbered 8 compared with 19 Americans. Qatar .—The Anglo-Persian Oil Company under the terms of their two-year agreement with the Shaikh of Qatar carried out several geological surveys. Their efforts to obtain a definite concession had not by the end of the year met with success. Kuuait.—Date Gardens .—Nothing further of a definite nature towards a solution of this very difficult problem was accomplished during the year. Pearling. —This, the staple industry of Kuwait, had a slightly better season than those of the last four preceding years. Smuggling .—Smuggling into ’Iraq from Kuwait continued to be pursued during the year due to the high import tariffs maintained by the former. The ’Iraq Government endeavoured unsuccessfully to persuade the Shaikh of Kuwait to take upon himself the onus of stopping smuggling from his territory. Aw. attempt by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad to call a conference there between the representatives of Kuwait and ’Iraq to discuss this problem, unfor tunately came to nothing owing to the attitude of the Shaikh. As an important factor in this problem it must be remembered that while Kuwaitis are amongst those who actually smuggle goods by sea into ’Iraq terri tory from Kuwait, on land it is the ’Iraki tribesmen themselves who are the carriers—Kuwait being merely the market where they purchase their goods. In April and again in October Kuwait dhows were fired upon by armed ’Iraq Customs launches in what was alleged to be Kuwait waters and casual ties to Kuwait boatmen were sustained. The ’Iraq Government’s reply to representations made on behalf of the Shaikh was that the incidents took place in ’Iraq waters. Blockade.—i\m Sand’s blockade of exports into Saudi Arabia from Kuwait was rigorously enforced during the year. This naturally continued to cause considerable loss to the inhabitants of the Principality who are largely depend ent on their transit trade. Bahrain.—Pearl in c.—l'he catch for 1933 is reported to have been poor in quality and quantity and the market stagnant. Several leading pearl mer chants suggested the advisability of closing the pearl banks for the season. Lel29FDThis suggestion would not be practicable unless the whole diving industry co operated In order to prevent the introduction of Japanese cultured pearls special legislation was enacted by the Bahrain Government in so far as it affect ed their subjects, and by His Majesty’s Government m so far as it affected British subjects and foreigners who are under the jurisdiction of the Political Ao-ent. Advantage was taken of this legislation to punish certain offenders. Other Rulers of ihe Arab Littoral were asked to co-operate in the matter which, in view of the adverse effect that the introduction of cultured pearls would have on the pearl trade, is a vital one for the large body of people whose livelihood depends on the pearl industry. Muscat. —No events of any great political importance took place in the State during the year under review. The outstanding problem of Muscat was that of finance. The Sultan assisted by his Financial Adviser—Captain Alban who left in June, made praiseworthy and successful attempts to curtail expen diture and at the end of the year there was a small surplus in the Treasury. Persian Side. Apart from a few isolated cases of robbery with violence the Persian coastal region as far as Bandar Abbas was quiet and security on the whole good. Persian Mekran and Bashakard were the scene of disturbances and spas modic fighting throughout the year. In spite of occasional successes the Per sian troops were unable to overcome entirely several of the smaller tribal Chiefs who continued to hold out in their mountain and desert strongholds. The inhabitants of these regions were evidently harshly treated by the Persian military forces as large numbers of tribesmen with their families went over to Kalat, Gwadur, British Baluchistan and even the Arab Coast. The Persian Navy occupied itself with its chief duty of preventing smuggling by sea and made a number of captures of sailing craft alleged to be engaged in that occupation. In several cases, however, the zeal of the Com manders appeared to have overcome their discretion and Arab vessels encoun tered on the High Seas were interfered with, some being taken to Persian ports for investigation. Various of these cases are still under discussion with the Persian Government. Basidu. —H.M.S. “ Bideford ”, while paying a visit to British Basidu on the 5th August 1933, found that the Union jack w 7 as not flying. The Captain landed an armed party and re-hoisted the flag. From local enquiries it appear ed that the Persian Warship “ Palang ” had put in to Basidu a few days pre viously with a party of officers who had hauled dowm the flag. The incident was reported to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran who took up the matter with the Persian Government. After lengthy correspondence the Persian Government expressed their regret at the incident. y* bdc discussions were still proceeding a further occurrence took place at Basidu. The Mudir of Customs of Persian Basidu, in spite of previous warn- ings, 1 : ad boarded and examined dhows anchored off Basidu in wdiat is claimed to be British waters. The facts being reported to the Officer-in-Charge of the armed party in occupation of British Basidu, he ordered his arrest and put him on board H.M.S. “ Lupin ”, which was at the time visiting the place. Tin? Mudir was later conveyed to Bandar Abbas and released. This incident con tinued to be the subject of active correspondence between His Majesty’s Gov ernment and the Persian Government until the close of the year. Belations with local Persian Officials. —Relations with the Governor of the k outhein loits-—Aqa Ali Asghar Khan Taliqani—and his successor Muham* med All Mirza Kokni, who was in temporary charge of the office from October to the end of the year, continued to be most cordial.

The year has seen the end, for the time being anyway, of Kussian interests in the South. The trading concern at Bandar Abbas closed down in May and in June the Bushire branch did likewise. Only one Russian ship arrived during the year which, after being refused permission at Bushire, was allowed to land her cargo at Mohammerah. B.—^Visitors. His Excellency Vice Admiral M. B. Dunbar-Nasmith, V.C., C.B., Com mander--n-Chief, East Indies Squadron, arrived at Bushire on board HA.S. “ Hawkins ” on 7th January.

His Excellency M. F. Okamado, Japanese Minister at the Court of Persia arrived at Bushire from Basra on the 14th May and left on 15th for Shiraz en route for Tehran. A Japanese commercial traveller of the firm of Mitsui Bussan Karsh came to Bushire soliciting orders in September. k C.— British Interests. Beyond the incidents at Henjam and Basidu (see Review) the year was poli tically quiet. A few pilgrims who had arrived at Jask on their 'way to Arabia on pil grimage were arrested for having no passports. They were arrested in the middle of October 1933 and taken to Bandar Abbas for trial. Up to the end of the year this had not been ended. Imperial and International Communications, Ltd. continued their service throughout the year. Messrs. Zieglers .—This old established Manchester firm continued to do business through its branch at Bushire. Trade, however, being so bad towards the end of the year, it was decided to close down in Persia. The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Ltd. (Mespers ).—This firm did very little business but continued as Agents to British India Steam Navigation Com pany Limited. Imperial Bank of Persia, Bushire, branch continued throughout the under the management of Mr. H. Evans. Visits of His Majesty’s Ships .—On 7th January His Excellency V ce Admiral M. B. Dunbar-Nasmith, V.C., C.B., Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron on board H.M.S. “ Hawdnns ” visited Bushire. He vms accompanied by Captain L. E.

All combined to make the visit the success that it was. On the 24th February Captain L. E.-Crabbe, R.N., Senior Naval Officer, Peisian Gult, aimed at Bushire in H.M.S. “ Triad ” and accompanied by the Honourable toe Pohtieal Resident called on His Excellency the Governor of Bushire to wd him farewell on relinquishing his command. On the 29th July Captain T. V. Creagh, D.S.O.. B.N.. Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gull, arrived in H.M.S. “ Shoreham ” and was introduced to His Ucellency tlie Governor, Bnshire, by the Honourable Lieut.-Colonel Gordon Loch, LA. The newly appointed Senior Naval Officer, Captain J. V. Creagh, D.S.O., ILN., in H.M.S. “ Shoreham ” and H. M. Sloops Fowey “ Lupin ” and Bideford ” visited Bushire during the year. SECTION 3. i ; Local ADMiNisTRVriox. Governor of the Southern Ports and Apanages. —His Excellency Aqai Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Taliqani was summoned peremptorily to Tehran on the 2 1 st October. He handed over his duties to Naib Abdullah Khan Minjal the Acting Chief of Police who continued as Governor throughout the year. Taliqani toured the Coast ports as far as Charbar and was away for some six weeks. He received numerous complaints of the bad treatment of the people by the Military authorities. He suggested to Tehran that a road should be built from Charbar to Iranshahr (Bampur). Assistant Governor .—Aqai Mohammed Khan Zand was Assistant Gover nor up to July 23rd and from October 21 st Abdul Shakoor Amin. Customs Administration. —Up to the 6 th August Shahzadeh Lutfullah Doulatshahi was Provincial Director of Customs, when he was transferred to Zahidan and was relieved by Monsieur Vendenrydt who acted in the dual capa city of Provincial Director and Inspector until the arrival of Monsieur La Fontaine, who continued as Provincial Director until the end of the year. Customs Smuggling Preventive Department. —The Customs Smuggling Preventive Department continued to work in a half-hearted manner. A spurt to their activities was given in the middle of the year by their being re-organised and a Military Lieutenant made leader. About 1,500 bags of sugar, a few cases of matches and shoes and odds and ends constitute the year’s bag of contraband captured from smugglers. A subsidiary guard was formed in June under a Captain of Military. The idea was to enlist time served soldiers, hire gun men and enlist the sympathy of the Tangistanis apparently on the principle of set a thief to catch a thief. The result seems to be that smugglers are sometimes caught unless they pay us some 60 Rials for a bag of sugar smuggled which sum is to be divided between the Guard and Customs Mudir (Manager). Chamber of Commerce. —The Chamber of Commerce passed determined re solutions with a view to boycott trade with Russians. The main duty of this Chamber is to apportion the right of importation to the traders the Bushire por tion of the tea and sugar quota. The amount allowed to be imported at Bushire is allotted by Tehran. Census Operations were started at Deshti and Ahram in Tangistan and on Karag Isle. The object is not to take a census in the ordinary sense of the word but to ascertain how many young men are available at a certain place as military conscripts. Economic Conditions. —Economic conditions were a little betker than the year before in as much as there were crops. The mass of the people are, how ever, distressingly poor. A scheme to set up a Spinning-Weaving-Bleaching and Finishing Plant was gone into during the year but its futility being realised the scheme was dropped in November in favour of a Gunny factory. Apparently a small amount of raw material is available at Kazeroon and Behbehan. Education .—The Education Administration of Bushire has been separated from that of Shiraz and now comes directly under Tehran. Bushire Municipality. —This Department has an annual income of 24,000 Tomans. The sum is made up by monthly instalments paid by the Revenue Department. During 1933 an extra sum of 7,000 Tomans was paid especially for Town improvements. The sources of income are octroi duties, taxes on houses, shops, liquors, tobacco, passages, etc. The taxes used to be collected by the Municipality itself when the Municipality avers that the income was always between 4,000 and 5,000 Tomans a month. Lcl29FDThere is a staff of 70 persons who clean up the Town. An infirmary i&amp;kept up. No accounts have been or are being published for 1933. SECTION 4. Military akd Marine. The Military garrison of Bushire was increased in January by the addition of the garrison of Ahram, Khawaz and other stations which were replaced by Road Guards. 1,800 new rifles were distributed to the Bushire and district garrison. The Bushire recruiting office was re-opened in August and the papers of all youths who were exempted last year were re-examined. About 750 youths were enrolled including those from Borazjan from where the taking of conscripts was started for the first time.- In May a Colonel of Military was sent to Bushire to investigate complaints of conscripts. The men apparently complain of severity of discipline and bad living arrangements. Judging by our standards the discipline seems lax and the living conditions are evidently better than a large number of the men would otherwise experience. The Persian Navy, under the command of Major Ghulam Hussain Khan Bayendor, has been cruising up and down the coadt and has had quite an excit ing year, capturing sailing boats and helping to put down smuggling. Those of the sailing boats which were armed often put up a stout resistance and only gave in at the last moment. The gunboat “ Karkas ” is the sole boat without a capture to her credit. She, however, landed a party at Bushire which pro ceeded to search some houses, thereby .grossly offending the land authorities, who, as in most eventualities, wrote to Tehran about it. One captured smuggler overstepped the bounds of Persian decency by giving away the fact that some of the money taken from him had stuck to the fingers of the Captain of the gunboat. Captain Pishwa, Commander of “ Chahrookh ” was duly summoned to Tehran. The captures are as follows :— * : Sloop “ Palang ” Sloop “ Babr ” . Gunboat “ Chahrookh ” ..

The hinterland of Bushire was on the whole quiet, due chiefly to the pro gressive disarmament policy of the Persian Government. Ali Khan Qashkai continued to resist the Military until July when he sur rendered. He was sent to Tehran and is kept there under observation as are other tribal Chiefs who have surrendered. A man called Ghulam Ali Sabz, a road guard, took to highway robbery in April, out of which he made a very good thing. He started off by killing his oflicer and stealing his money. He then took to stealing flocks and holding them up to ransom. After some months he was pressed to cease marauding and instead to help in the general disarmament to which he seems to have acquiesced. He has been given land as a reward. His original crime has apparently been forgotten, for a while anyway. Quiet reigned in Dashti and Tangistan during the year though the opening of census operations was a signal for a few attacks, in which one or two people were killed. Only one motor was attacked during the year and that the lorry carrying the post. Persian Mekran, Jask and Charhar .—Murad Khan and Chiragh Khan, sons of Mustafa Khan returned to Mekran and started to plunder and molest both the people and the Military. Mustafa Khan himself returned in the Autumn. He handed in a few rifles and went over to the Persians. He has been permitted to live in Old J ask. Abdul Hussain of Remiskh, Ashraf Khan, Shir Khan and several other recalcitrant Chiefs continued pillaging, marauding and holding captives up for ransom. Abdul Hussain together wdth a Chief called Chiragh still stoutly hold out against the Persian troops. The arrest of a Chief called Mir Mirza caused the Military to lose a friend in the person of Sardar Hussain Khan. This man had accepted the nominal Governorship of Persian Mekran, except for Bashkard, and was collecting taxes and arms, but on his request for the release of Mir Mirza being refused he abandoned his charge and took to the hills. The dissatisfaction caused by the commandeering of boats and animals from, and general bad treatment of, the people by the Military has found an outlet in immigration. Many tribesmen with their families have gone over to Kalat, Gv/adur, British Baluchistan and even the Arab Coast. Abdul Hussain of Bashkard and his tribes resisted the Military throughout the vear. He is said to have about 1,500 men in the Somali Hills. In February he managed 1 o rescue his family and some property that had fallen into the hands of the Persian Government. The Tahrzais, a tribe near Jask revolted. They had collected about Tomans 6,000 and a lot of grain due as taxes together with which they sent off their families in dhows to Ras al Khaimah. The men met a Military horse sent to investigate the affair, this was surrounded so it returned from whence it came. The men of the tribe then followed their families to the Arab Coast.6 SECTION 7.

WATTS, Major, Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. SECTION 8 . Trade and Trade Facilities. The conditions described in the section on Trade in the Administration Report for 1932 remain practically unaltered and the prospects of any improve ment in trade were far from bright, while the struggle for existence against the strangulating restrictions imposed by the Government brought merchants to the verge of collapse. Month after month the general despair was reflected in the hopeless reports which came in from the bazaar. The refusal of the local Customs authorities to furnish statistics makes an accurate analysis of the trade of Bushire practically impossible. Some indica tion of the countries of origin of imports may be gleaned from the information kindly put at our disposal by the agents of the various steamship lines calling at the port but in many cases where goods have been transhipped the reports may be misleading. No details of the weights or values of imports or exports are available. The application of a quota system and the total prohibition to import many classes of goods has limited merchants to a very restricted range and the mono poly of practically all staple articles further reduces the scope of importers and forces the remainder of the trade into the hands of a few of the wealthier mer chants. In desperation, many of the smaller traders lose no opportunity of evading the law and, in spite of attempts to suppress it, smuggling both inwards and out wards is still flourishing. It is said that good profits are made from gold smuggled out of the country by judicious sale of the resulting foreign exchange. 1 he fictitious value which exchange control places on Persian produce in world markets has also had its natural effect on the demand for Persian goods abroad. the determination of Ihe central government to recover the losses it had incurred on the dollar exchange resulted in the imposition of terms on the motoi trade vInch it was unable to support and the import of cars and acces sories was, consequently, practically suspended. . Th® OOToramont having amassed a considerable holding of dollars fit rate of Rials 8.28 to the dollar was greatly perturbed by the loss occasioned when the Imte.i Mates of America abandoned the gold standard and the rate dropped o about Rials 17 to the dollar. In order to make up this loss it was declared hat motor cars, tyres and accessories could onlv be imported on con- 01 non that payment wag made in dollars purchased from the Government at the rate of Rials 28.28 per dollar. To illustrate the effect of this unfair discri mination against the motor trade it was reported in August, when the dollar as°much klk 1 ^ 0 7 U 4 $ ff\J; ha 1 t th . 0 st erUng-rial rate on this basis would he as much as luals 13o.74 while the bank rate was only Rials 83. . T p t 1 0 e ^P edi te the acceptance of these terms, a further blow was dealt to the trade by the subjection of purchases of the exchange to interest to the^existiohh? from 1 tlle 2 ? nd Jime - This severe handicap, added a a ratt also fixe f Iw +1 to P urchase \ m P 01 't licences from the National Bank whhd vvonirh^ rdaced m? and the uncertainty of the valuation vciiuJi would &gt;t placed on the goods on arrival bv the Customs assessors, ^ ™ '4 to acctpHlic These regulations remained in force until the end of the year and com- pletely arrested the progress which British Trucks were making in ftis market.They were also instrumental finally in forcing Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Company the oldest and last surviving British merchant firm in Persia to close down. It is a mattei of much regret that the experience of this reputable firm which has for so long enjoyed the respect and confidence of its clients throughout the country and whose knowledge of local conditions is such a valuable asset should be lost at a time when the development of markets is of primary importance. The notification late in the year of the Government’s intention to allow the impoits, in certain conditions, of goods previously classed as prohibited will it is loped, stimulate the revival of trade and re-establish confidence but, in the absence of the fullest details of the concession and knowledge of the motive local merchants were suspicious and reluctant to take advantage of the facilities Opium. The failure of the opium monopoly to find markets for its accumu lating stocks led to the cancellation, in October 1932, of the concession. Since that time in spite of the efforts made by other merchants only two comparativelv small shipments have been made by them and other two sales have been effected by the ^-monopoly interests for the legitimate trade. Apart from the shipment of 830 cases of opium for which licence had been granted by the importing countries, three vessels, about which the greatest secrecy was preserved, loaded approximately, 3,787 cases for unknown destina- tion during the year. While it is difficult to prove that all the opium shipped in this way is for illicit trade, mostly in the Far East, there is little doubt that it is so and, that it is exported with the approval of the Persian Government is evident f rom the precautions which are taken officially to prevent leakage of the details of shipment. As the selling price is usually about £120 per case and the Persian export duty ranges up to £83 per case the Government’s reluctance to submit to any control m the interests of humanity at large can be expressed in terms of cash. The total export of opium through Bushire from March 1932 to March 1934 has been 0,967 cases composed of the following shipments : July 1932 ,. October 1932 November 1932 March 1933 ,. May 1933 June 1933 August 1933 October 1933 For legitimate Illicit, consumption. 100 cases 1,100 „ 150 „ 1,000 cases. 379 cases .. 2,187 „ 51 „ 200 „ 200 ,, .. 600 cases Legitimate Illicit 2,180 cases. 3,787 cases. Total .. .. .. 5,967 cases. In comparison with the total of 5,203 cases exported during the year 1931-32 there has been a serious decrease in the export, due principally to the excessive export tax which proved a severe handicap in competition with Anatolian opium and to the large stocks which, it is understood, were held in the Far East. The troubles in China may also have had an adverse effect on the demand from that country. Foreign Competition :— {a) Japanese.—In the absence of Customs statistics it is not possible lo give any accurate indication of the growth of Japanese competition but the poverty of the people compels them to purchase only the cheapest goods and as these are undoubtedly of Japanese manufacture it is not surnrisW to fiml the market full of them. The quality is admittedly inferior and dves and durability cannot compare with similar lines from other sources but prices are attractive. ^ Lc129FD8 Business is mostly conducted through agents in Bombay who quote C. I. p. terms ' The method of payment may be 10 per cent, with the order and balance against documents at Bushire or consignments of Persian goods may sometime on account. The firm of Sankoyu at Tehran at present have an active agent in Bushire (A glia Abnl Casim Tawakkul) and it is rumoured that other offices will soon be established here. In the following list of Japanese goods at present available in the market it has not been possible to obtain, in every case, the prices offered by Bombay agents so the prices paid by local sliopkeepcis lia\e been inserted and starred.

For six months before March when Vneshtorg interests were taken over by the Bureau-Pearse their transactions had been insignificant and the rupture in commercial relations with Persia had little effect in Bushire. Neither the Russians nor their trading methods had ever enjoyed a great measure of popu larity locally and the failure of yet another campaign was a matter of general satisfaction. The withdrawal of the Vneshtorg staff was cldsely followed by the closure of the Russian Bank which had only been in operation for thirteen months. Although the embargo on business with the Russians was withdrawn in August and one or two representatives have visited the town since, they have done practically no business beyond forwarding consignments up country and retailers in town are experiencing difficulty in disposing of their Russian stocks. (c) Italian .—The extent of Italian activities in Bushire has not so far been serious and they have been confined to satteens, woollen goods and blankets. Most of the goods have, until now T , been transhipped to British bottoms at Port- Said. In recent months however, the Italians have declared their indention of instituting a two monthly service in the Persian Gulf and the first steamer dis charged goods at various ports during February 1934. In view of the well known practice of the Italian Government to subsidise its shipping this invasion constitutes a serious menace to the British lines which now carry the bulk of the Gulf trade. While the introduction of measures for the protection of British shipping is primarilv a matter for agreement amongst the shipping interests themselves it is also of national importance and it may therefore be useful to reiterate the following points which appear to affect our interests adversely :— ( 1 ) Unrestricted Imperial Cabotage. ( 2 ) Unchallenged adverse international trade balances. (3) The sale of old British shipping in serviceable condition to under cutting competitors. (4) The unrestricted engagement of foreign crews on ships flying the British flag. Financial .-—The disposal abroad of Persian produce at uneconomic prices and the general stagnation in trade together with heavy import duty and taxa tion on goods coming into the country rendered money consistently tight throughout the year. The critical financial position of many of the merchants led to the suspension of credits by the Banks except in isolated cases and as a result of the general lack of confidence practically all transactions in town are now conducted on a cash basis. No bankruptcies were actually declared but the failure of several firms in Shiraz inflicted loss on a number of Bushire merchants and the serious difficulties experienced by one business house became a matter of grave concern to its numerous local creditors. The Imperial Bank of Persia and the National Bank of Persia continued to operate under British and German management respectively. The high reputation enjoyed by the former combined with its greater facilities for con ducting foreign business are believed to have given it the advantage over its rival, which however probably obtained the custom of German merchants, shipping by Hansa Line steamships. Communications and transport .—The post and telegraphs, sea, and air com munications work efficiently to keep Bushire in touch with the outside world but the poor state of the roads in the vicinity do much to preserve its isolation from Persia. Weather and wear are a strong combination against poor roads and the cost of maintenance of long stretches is prohibitive. The road from Bushire to Shiraz is the only real link with the interior and attempts are occasionally made to keep it in repair. A commendable effort to10 recondition the road leading out of town is now in hand but the camber on the finished stretch is too pronounced for comfortable driving. The cheapness and speed of motor transport has practically killed the animal transport services, although considerable quantities of .Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany’s products were sent up country on camels. J. GILROY BAILLIE, His Majesty's Vice-ConsulII APPENDIX I. Notes on the working of the Residency Dispensary, Bushire, for the year* 1933. Climatically the year was most exceptional. The rains in the early part of the year were good and well spread out. They were not followed by the usual cold North winds that are responsible for so many attendances for respiratory diseases. The hot weather came very gradually and was one of the mildest on record. One result of the rains and filling up of water tanks, in each house was an increase in the number of malaria eases. For the two rainless years there had been a falling off in the number of attendances for this disease, but in 1933 the number rose from 1,200 to 3,619. Amcebie dysentery was prevalent for the last 9 months of the year and there was an outbreak of Mumps in December. The number of in-patients and outdoor attendances in comparison with those of 1932, were as follows :— With the exception of malaria and dysentery there was a decrease in the number of attendances for all diseases and this was due mainly to the mildness of the climate.

Note on events in the Mishun and Qach Qaeaguli Aee'a during the tear 1933 Active operations in the area remained suspended throughout the year. Wells were regularly inspected, well head fittings serviced, and pressures re corded. The Blondin rope-way at Gach Qaraguli was dismantled and all material transferred to Ganawah. All roads were maintained in good condition by road gangs. In December they suffered considerable damage by heavy rains and additional labour was engaged for the necessary repairs. One European remains in charge of the area, stationed in Ganawah. Guarding arrangements remain unchanged. No untoward incident occurred during the year. _CHAPTER HI.

Of the other tribes—the Khamseh, the Boir Ahmadi and Mamassani,—little was heard though progress was^reported with the government’s efforts to settle them m the new town of Tul-i-Khosro. The imprisonment of the Qawam-ul- Mulk m December, beyond giving rise to one or two bazaar rumours, provoked little comment. The confiscation of his lands in June 1932 undoubtedly threw many of the Khamseh tribesmen out of work and it is pretty certain that some of these threw in their lot with the various robber bands which were in evidence during the year. ( Such bands were not, however, predominently tribal but were composed of men thrown together by necessity and with no other means of earning a livelihood. They were dispersed one by one and several notorious leaders, including Sar Mast, a relative of the once formidable Mehdi Surkhi were captured. ’ With the exception of a minor epidemic of “ hold-ups ” in the middle of the summer when lorries were plundered between Bushire and Shiraz and Shiraz and Isfahan, there was little interference with traffic on the main roads. In outlying districts, notably in the neighbourhood of Fasa and Jahrum, various acts of brigandage were committed and various clashes between the amnieh and the robbers were reported, but the number of such incidents showed a marked diminution in the latter half of the year, attributable perhaps to the submission of Ali Khan and his followers as well as to extensive “ round-ups carried out by the military. bcl29FD18 2. Haji Shams-ud-Din Jalali who had been appointed Governor-General In Fars in July 3932 was suddenly recalled to Tehran on August 19th. After a short interval during which Mirza Mohd. Ali Khan Shaibani, director of the Finance Department of Fars, assumed the duties of acting Governor-General, Mirza Majid Khan Alii, formerly of the Judicial Department in Tehran, was appointed' to the vacant post and arrived in Shiraz on September 29th. The new Governor-General, whose pet schemes are to provide Shiraz with an adequate water supply and to construct additional “ Khiabans ”, has proved himself a capable and energetic official and has adopted a helpful and friendly attitude towards TL M.’s Consulate. Other local officials also appeared to be well disposed but acting evidently on instructions not to enter into intimate relations with foreigners of any description were careful to keep themselves at a discreet distance. The bail also fell, though perhaps less rigidly, on non-officials and there was more than one instance of Persian visitors to the Consulate being questioned by tli e Police as to the reason of their visit. As a result, many of those who used to be frequent visitors latterly never put 1 in an appearance. In some cases they expressed regret and hinted darkly that they would like to, but feared the consequences. A noticeable and pleasant exception was provided by one old Persian merchant of some seventy or eighty years of age, formerly a power in Shiraz, now something of a spent force but still a greatly respected figure, who arrived quite cheerfully astride his donkey, whenever an occasion for calling presented itself. Economic hardships probably prevented the people from bothering their heads over much with political questions and the Basidu incident, though reported briefly in the local press, failed to arouse any real interest much less ill-feeling. Similarly the press article dispute in the latter part of the year produced no visible reoercussions and probably passed unnoticed by all save habitual readers of the Tehran newspapers. What is more certain, however, is that there were genuine and widespread complaints against the present government and a belief, freely expressed, that its economic policy was ruining the country. Landowners and cultivators found it impossible to pay the revenue charges of two or three years ago. The government departments would agree to no diminution and failure to pay meant fines and confiscation of crops. The merchants, also, fettered by regulations and handicapped by the almost complete cessation of the opium trade and the poverty of the peasants which its non-cultivation entailed, and by the fact that the present import quotas tended to divert traffic from the Bushire-Shiraz route to the Bandar-Skahpur- Ahwaz route, complained bitterly that the volume of trade had shrunk to one-third of what it had been in former years. While such complaints were not aimed directly against H. I. M. there can be little doubt that part of the blame foi the pieseiu state of affairs was attached to him and, though he was still admired j:or his courage and energy, certain veiled criticisms of his action in acquiring property for himself at the expense of his people were heard from widely separated quarters. ig condition of roads and communications in the province snoweu appreciable change Irom the previous year. Minor improvements were effect on the roads from Shiraz to Bushire and Isfahan and repair gangs were evidence at various points. Shiraz was linked by telegraph to Ardakan •the north-west and to Firuzabad to the south.

Platt Bros.Co., Ltd., of Oldham for 5,000 spindles. During the summer work proceeded steadily with the construction of the mill building : in the autumn the machinery duly arrived at Bushire, was transported to Shiraz and the work of fitting and installing under the supervision of an English mill manager, an English mechanic and two English fitters was well-advanced at the close of the year. Sir Aurel Stein, K.C.I.E., having paid a brief visit to Shiraz in March, returned in November with the intention of making an extended archaeological tour in the Eastern and South Eastern portions of the province. After a short delay due to difficulties over escort arrangements, Sir Aurel left Shiraz on November 21st for Firuzabad. The following day news was received from H. M.’s Legation in Tehran that the local authorities considered visits to certain places, including Lar and Darab, for the present inadvisable. In spite of various representations, this decision was maintained until the end of the year. In November a party of Anglo-Persian Oil Company geologists under Mr. Washington Gray using Shiraz as their base commenced a survey of the region included in the quadrilateral formed by Shiraz, Kazerun, Jahrum and Niriz. A second party under Dr. Harrison starting from Isfahan were carrying- out simultaneously a survey of the area to the North-West of Shiraz and to the South-East of Urujan. Two Dominican priests, the Very Reverend Father Dominic Blencowe 0. P. and Father Cyprian Rice (formerly of the Levant Consular Service) arrived in Shiraz in November and rented two bungalows in what was formerly the Indo- European Telegraph. Department compound, for the purpose of founding a monastery. Their flowing white robes made them conspicuous figures when they appeared in the “ Khiabans ” and at first aroused some curiosity amongst the inhabitants. Father Blencowe himself tells the story of the small boy who one night mistook him for a ghost and proceeded to throw stones at him. Their failure to produce a permit (which has since been granted) brought them into temporary conflict with the police authorities who refused to allow them to receive persons into their chapel pending its production. (There was reasonable evidence to suppose that a certain clique, of which Mr. Cassin, the French Consul in Bushire who spent a greater portion of the summer and autumn in Shiraz, appeared to be the leader, resented the appointment of British priests to a district which had hitherto been attended to by French priests from Isfahan. F. H. GAMBLE, H. B. M.’s Consul, Shiraz. Lcl29FD20 CHAPTER IV. Administration report of the Constjlar District of Bandar Areas and Lixgah for The year 1933. Personnel. Tlis Majesty’s Consul.—Captain C. H. Lincoln, O.B.E., held charge through- out the year. Local Government. Bandar Abbas.— Ismail Khan Bahadur held the charge of Governorate for the whole year under report. As per last year’s report, the Governor is invariably the President of the Municipality and as such he has in reality no administrative duties, as all the different departments are now in existence with their respective powers. Although steady and cautious, being in the past a military officer, he generally lacks the talent of a civil officer and therefore is to a certain extent unpopular with the Municipal Board of which he is the President. Undoubtedly he has shown energetic activities in connection with the improvement of the town, especially the construction of a Khyaban (avenue) and water supply through the qanat system. But lack of funds has unfor tunately suspended work for the former, and for the latter he is doing his utmost for the funds for its completion. His Excellency Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Taleqani, Governor of the Gulf ports, visited Bandar Abbas, Minab, Kishm and Henjam in June. A party of Government Inspectors consisting of eight officials with Sartip Abdul Hassan Pour-e-Zand, as head of the Commission, arrived from Tehran and Kerman on the 3rd and proceeded by Naval Motor Dhow to Jask on the 5th and Charbar on the 14th January 1934. During their stay at Charbar, they were engaged in making enquiries into various reports and complaints made by the local officials to their respective departments against each other, the chief causes of unrest, and the exodus of nearly a thousand inhabitants from Charbar to British Baluchistan, which, it appears, have aroused the attention of the higher authorities in Tehran. They have removed Sultan Jangju, the Officer Commanding and Aqai Sepasdar, the Director of Customs at Charbar, who are said to be the important men and chief cause of turmoil. Further, a large quantity of suuar, foreign liouor and cigarettes, which were imported by the overland route from Gwadur by Sultan Jangju and stored in Military godowns were confiscated through the help of the Customs officials there. As a result of this, Sultan Jangju was arrested and detained in the Military barracks at Bandar Abbas prior to his and the Director of Customs, Oharbar, being sent to Bushire for trial. The Commission returned to Bandar Abbas from Charbar on the 25th January 1934. During their stay they have inspected all the departments, and finally left for Lingah on the 8 th February 1934. . Military Commission consisting of two officers came from Tehran to inspect Military and Amnieh Departments. During the latter part of the Persian year 1312, two batches of Govern ment Inspectors one headed by Sartip Abdul Hassan Khan Pourezand and the second by Sartip Abdul Reza Khan Afkhami visited the place to inspect the 'workings of the departments, specially the Military and the Conscription. ^ h ™ ori relieved Aqai Mustanfi as Deputy Governor, rf ''/% \ G “ h November 1933. The latter has been transferred to Kerman as Head Clerk to Governor-General. as Meshed proceeded to Minab on the 19th June 1933 capacity ' ? ma ^’ Vlce Buhm transferred to Borasjun in the same i vnunce.

Minab, Mirza Abdul Rassoul Dereesi held charge throughout the year. Linagii .—Mirza Ameri held charge throughout the year. Posts and Telegraphs. Bandar Abbas.—Mirza Ibrahim Khan Arbabi, the Director of Posts and -telegraphs, held charge throughout the year. The post and telegraph officials remained well disposed towards the Consulate. The work of the Telegraph section leaves nothing to be desired. C ommunication by telephone with Minab was maintained. Sayyed Ja’far Khan Nabawi, an Inspector from the Ministry of Posts and TelegTaphs arrived on inspection duty from Bushire on the 8 th June and left for Kerman on the 15th. During his stay he inspected the local Post and Telegraph Offices. Municipality. Bandar ' A bbas. —Agha Ismail Khan Bahadur, Governor of Bandar Abbas, was enthusiastically keen to improve the state of the town and the following progress was made during the year .— Water Supply. —To replace the Barqa water system, which is a source of danger for all water-borne diseases and specially guineaworm, the new qanat system to supply drinking water to the town was taken in hand. The source was from Nail)and and the mouth reached the entrance of the town, the water flowing through a trench dug deep and connecting the several qanats, but on the 2nd April 1933 there was a very heavy rainfall, practically unknown in the history of Bandar Abbas, which demolished the trenches and the whole scheme failed. Until then 1 l.(MR) tomans had been spent, but this year (1934) the scheme has been given on a contract basis to the same Contractor (Ustad Raiab) for the sum of Rials. 85,000. Electricity and, Ice sunpln. —The Power House belonging to Haji Sheikh Ahmed Gelladary has been taken over and formed into a Company concern. For the whole year the plant for electric lights worked well, and ice was also made twice, but, as the plant is old, the ice turned out was of inferior quality and at heavy cost. Charitable Dispensary. —The dispensary was re-opened on the 14th Febru ary 1933 with Dr. K. H. Dumree, ca-I.M.D., as a Medical Officer. As the dis pensary was well-known in the past as the Consulate Medical Officer used to attend there, the general public now make more use of it than that of the Persian Quarantine Department. Owing to the paucity of the staff, surgical work is not undertaken. The scheme for having six beds has also been dropped, only serious indoor cases being admitted for treatment, and for such cases comforts and nursing are provided by relations or friends. It is yet to be seen whether the Dispensary will continue to work after March 1934, as the Medical Officer, apparently, is not desirous to continue working with such a negligible number of stair. As there is no Consulate Medical Officer in Bandar Abbas serious cases have been sent to Dr. Dumree who has treated such cases free of charge. The Main Road. —The so-called avenue has been constructed at the sacrifice of about 15 houses. Some of the influential house-owners have been paid com pensation, but the ordinary classes whose houses have been demolished, are given lands in exchange in other quarters of the town for the construction of new buildings. Education Department. Bandar Abbas. —Mirza Noorali Khan Basti, Director of Education, remained in charge throughout the year. There are two schools in the station, one for the boys up to the sixth standard and the other for the girls up to the second class only. Lingo.h:- —Agha Salehi remained in charge throughout the year. Minab. —Ag;ha Jazaeri held the charge during the whole year.22 Police. Bandar Abbas.—Nnib I Sayyed Shamasuddin Khan _ Safai was Commis sioner of Police throughout the year. He is old and lenient and addicted to opium smoking. No reports of any crimes were received during the year and the work of the Police was as reasonably efficient as in the preceding year. Under instructions from Tehran, the Police authorities have been censuring all foreign mail bags during the month of August with a view to^ seizing the newspaper 11 Al-Haluch ■ which is said to be anti-Persian, and prints article? about making Baluchistan an Independent State. All Soviet newspapers have also been confiscated. Lutfrah .—Agha Vakil Ali ‘ Kai ’ officiating Rais-i-Nazmieh remained in charge throughout the year. Minah ,—Agha Raselli, Raise Nazmieh held the post during the whole year. Passport Department. Bandar Abbas .—The work continued to remain in the hands of the Police authorities and Political Officers and Captains of the Mail steamers calling at this port were afforded facilities to disembark during the stay of the steamers. When Naib I Sayyed Shamsuddin Khan Safai, Commissioner of Police, left for Henjam and Lingah on inspection duty in December 1933, he left orders that no passports were to be issued in his absence, and consequently over a hundred passengers who were held up threatened to make telegraphic representation? to the Shah if they were delayed longer. The safe of the Police had, therefore, to be forced open to obtain materials for the issuing of passports. Amnieh. Bandar Abbas .—The strength of the force in this town is about 100. Amir Lashkar Azizullah Khan Zarghami, General Officer Commanding, arrived from Bushire on the 11th May in a Persian Gunboat to inspect the whole of Amnieh force posted on Bandar Abbas-Kerman road, on account of repeated attacks on motor transport by the brigands, and to submit his report for the future administration of the road. He left by the same gunboat to Bushire on the 13th May. Naib Sarhang Abdullah Khan Tumaj, Officer Commanding, Amnieh, Kerman, arrived on the 9th May and returned to Kerman with Amir Lashkar on the 12th May. Judicial Department. Bandar Abb ^ 5 .-—During the months of July and August 1933 Agha Mohamad Khan Ashrafi (Raisi Adlieh) and Mirza Mohamad Khan Sadn-ul-Anam (Muddai- ul-Umam) proceeded on leave closing the courts for the summer session. Samavi, the Mustantiq (Investigating Judge) who did not join his colleagues in asking for leave without pay for the summer months, was transferred to Kerman for the time Bandar Abbas courts remained closed. Agha Mohamad Khan Ashrafi, the Raisi Adlieh, returned from leave and opened the local courts in the absence of the Public Prosecutor and the Investi gating Judge on the 4th October 1933. the news of having taken bribes in two cases reached Tehran where Agha Mohamad Khan Ashrafi and Mirza Mohamad Khan Sadr-Ul-Anam were summoned for an interview by a Vazarate Adlieh. It was proved that Agha Ashrah had taken a bribe and hence Mirza Mohamad Khan was appointed i\aise Adheh in addition to his own duties from October 1933. The latter is r. Vei f ? r G M jer ieneed man, and addicted to opium smoking. Agha \ d T-i iv ia i n - has been appointed Raise Mahkamah, and Mohamad Ali K 1 i an Khorshide is officiating in the Mustantiq office. ^ le De P ut y Governors remained in charge of the there nUtS at ih ^ e &amp;tatl ons much to the discontent of merchants and traders customs.

This was completed in June and since then, there is a great improvement in the general appearance of the Customs. Smuggling of gold is now totally obsolete, but still there is every reason to believe that sailing dhows leave from small ports and carry small quantities unknown to the Customs officials. The Customs outposts in surrounding areas have been reopened with the new nomenclature of guards and a Yawar at its head at Bandar Abbas. Monsieur Vandenrydt, the Special Inspector of Persian Gulf Customs, arrived from Bushire on the 4th January 1934 to inspect the working of the Customs Department and the construction of the Customs House. Military. Bandar Abbas .—Yawar Sayyed Abdullah Khan, Arab Nejad, Officer Com manding Troops at Bandar Abbas, was promoted to the rank of Naib-Sarhang with effect from the 21st March 1933, and the garrison under his command made a Regiment from the same date. He remained in command throughout the year. The detachment under Sultan Tayer returned from Bashakird on the 18th May 1933. The operations against Bashakird tribes were suspended owing to the approach of summer. The question of accommodating the troops, who at the present moment number about 800 men, in absence of proper barracks, has become a problem and several small private houses adjacent to the old barracks have been rented for the purpose. It is reported that 160 soldiers were sick and over 40 men died owing to lack of shelter, proper nourishment and medical treatment. On the 26th and 20th October 1933 about 250 men were despatched to Jask and Charbar by motor boat and Persian Gunboat with a view to scattering troops all over Biaban and Bashakird and so compel outlaws to come to terms without bloodshed. Conscription. Bandar Abbas .—Sarhang Mushar, in charge of the Conscription Depart* ment, Kerman, visited Bandar Abbas on the 6th March and left for Jask. About 180 newlv enlisted recruits from Kerman arrived for the local garrison on the 4th' May. About 200 conscript recruits arrived from Mmab on the 27th May. Yawar Abidi of the Conscription Department arrived from Kerman on the 9th and left for Minab on the l4th May 1933. Notices wrere for the first time posted in Minab in the month of May 19o3 and the neighbouring villages, giving the names of conscripts and calling upon them to appear before the Conscription Committee. It is leported that abou 3 000 men have fled to the opposite coast to escape enlistment and it is marec that tlm work of collecting the harvest and fruit will greatly suffer ^ on this account. The total number of conscripts for the district of Minab is said to hp ohmii o (ioo mostlv from the poor class and above the specified age. Iln land owneff^nCpfate appealing to the Central Government if the local authorities agree to support their representations. About 180 men were enlisted for this force during the year from Bandar Abbas town out of which about 20 men have been declared unfit for one year bv the medical board. Sons of influential traders, who were exempted on the plea of overage, have been called up for identification of ages and to join the force. . Thirtv recruits from Minab are reported to have deserted from the Gmau TTrn ■ summer Four of them were arrested at Minab and brought to Bandai fits on the 9th July and the headmen of the r^pective vrll^es are be.ng pres- sed to produce the remaining deserters or provide substitute . Lcl29FD24 Condition of the Country. Bandar Abbas.— Several small thefts were reported to have occurred in the town one of which was committed in the Consulate when the thief was arrested and sent to the Nazmieh where he was detained for a fortnight and then dis charged as the courts in Bandar Abbas were not opened then. Biyaban—Jalal Taherzani, who, after removal of Mir Barakat Khan from Bashakird in 1932, was appointed chief of the road guards with 20 men of his tribe under him, was taken to task by the local authorities at Minab in connection with revenue collected by him and was sent to Minab in charge of an Amnieh o’uard. He was, however, released by his men on the road and the whole party fled to Bashakird to join Abdul Hussein Kameran, the notorious outlaw. On receipt of this information, the Officer Commanding Troops, Bandar Abbas, paid a hurried visit to Minab with a view to obtaining an interview with Abdul Hus sein Kameran of Bashakird and proposing peace terms which the latter is re ported to have refused. It is rumoured that the wife of Abdul Hussein Kameran has been arrested by the troops and it is hoped that with her capture they will be able to bring her husband to terms. The sister of M ir Barakat Khan, who went to Tehran in October 1933 with the hope of seeing her brother and begging for his release, returned on the 15th December as she found her brother and his elder son, Abdullah Khan, had both died. This news aggravated the tribesmen and there was wholesale robbery in Minab. A detachment of 150 soldiers were sent to Minab immediately. On the 15th February 1934 Mir Barakat Khan’s sister was brought to Bandar Abbas to be sent to Tehran. A band of Taherzaies, having had a skirmish with the troops raided the Customs House at Galak and killed the Mudir. Bandar Abbas. —The road leading to Kerman via the passes of Zagh and Zindan remained safe during the year. The postal lorry with mails from Kerman and two lorries with sugar and passengers from Bandar Abbas were held up by a band of Farsi robbers between Gakhum and Hajiabad on the 26th April 1933. All the cargo and valuable articles belonging to the pasengers as well as parcels from the mail bags were carried away by the robbers.

Two Gipsy Moths G-ABZK and G-ABWK with Air Commoder, Fellowes, Mrs. Fellowes and Messrs. McIntyre and Edison arived from Karachi on their return from the mount Everest Expedition at 3-30 p.m. on the 6th May and left for Bushire the following day. Mr. Guliver of the Burma Oil Company arrived from Karachi in his plane AV-ACR on the afternoon of the 19th May and took off for Baghdad at 5-30 a.m. the following day. Mrs. M. R.

Mr. James Woods arrived at Bandar Abbas in Gipsy Moth No. VH-UPD “ The Spirit of Western Australia ” from Austraha via Karachi on the 26th at 4-30 p.m. en route to the United Kingdom. He was anxious to take off at 5 p.m. on the 27th July but the Police authorities refused to endorse his passport on the grounds that he failed to obtain a visa from the Persian Consul at Karachi in spite of Mr. Woods statement that he had been to see the Persian Consul at Karachi and the latter had told him that his passport was in order and he could proceed via Karachi. Eventually his passport was endorsed at 11 a.m. on the 27th, after a written guarantee from His Majesty’s Consulate to pay any fine which might be imposed. As it was then too late to proceed to Bushire, Mr. Woods postponed his departure for the next day, when just as the aeroplane was taking off at 5 a.m. the under carriage collapsed. Mr. Woods wired to Karachi for spare parts to be dropped by any French or Dutch planes at the aerodrome. After receiving the required spares from Karachi through one of the Royal Dutch Air Mail planes, Mr. James Woods took off for Bushire on the 30th August 1933. Messrs. Pattison and Deale of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, Abadan, arrived by Company’s plane on the 18th August and left the same even ing on a visit to Kishm Island.

The matter was reported to one of H. M.’s ships which arrived on the spot a day later and re-hoisted the flag and landed an armed guard. The general public have opined that if the Persian Government wished to claim Basidu as Persian territory the action of hauling down the flag was both improper and impolite.26 hmerial Bank of Persia.-Uv.

After closing down of the Imperial Bank of Persia, the local branch of tie Persian National Bank have been attempting to monopolise the exchange market and in certain cases have openly warned the managers of the British Indian firm of Menghraj Lilaram against effecting exchange transaction ™th parties other than the National Bank, threatening to break off business relations and closing their current account.

Bandar Abbas. —The trade of Bandar Abbas during the year under review was, as in the past years, very limited. The majority of so-called merchants here, are all clearing and forwarding agents of the business houses at Yezd and Kerman. As there is no import of useful commodities from foreign lands, owing to monopoly Law restrictions, there is practically no business. kince July, the Russians, owing to their unfair dealings, have been removed ri om the market by the Persian Government for the supply of sugar. And instead the Persian Government themselves import sugar for trade purposes. Phis scheme has in no way benefitted the merchants. The Russians have closed their show of Venishtorg and Persian merchants 0 ' 1 ' c ' e G a in ex tent have appreciated the work of their Government for having ousted the Russians from the market. ut the Japanese have taken advantage in the Persian markets of t occurrence, aLhough at present they are busy onlv with piecegoods which P captured tne Persian markets as the quality is better than that of the Russian Shipping and Navigation. ^ steam ships of all nationality aggregating 209,478 t( lor 9 ^Q d 10 por l dur '°hg the year.

The Sanitary Engineer from Hospital V1Slted Bandar Abbas to re P air the disinfecting tank at the Qaurantine Economic conditions. . Owing' to better rainfall during the year, the question of the supply of drink ing water for the towns people was not so acute during the summer months. The crops in the surounding districts were fairly plentiful, and the prevail ing rates in the bazaars were not unreasonably high. No locusts appeared this year.

Administration report of His Majesty’s Consulate, Kerman, for the year 1933. A.— British Interests. 1. His Majesty’s Consults—Personnel.—Captain C. H. Lincoln OBE 5 h V? tU ? led { rom Bandar Abbas on the 19th March, remained in charge' of H M. s Consulate throughout the year. He proceeded to Tehran on the 6th October and returned on the 4th November. Khan Bahadur Abdul Alim, E.K., Indian Attache to His Majesty’s Consul, proceeded to India on the 23rd April, his post having been abolished at Kerman. 2. Consulate work. — (a) 29 British Subjects were registered at the Consu late during the year, the number for 1932 being 34. (b) The espionage on the Consulate by the secret Police relaxed in the early months and there were no signs of the Consulate being watched at the end of the year. The anniversary of H. I. M. the Shah’s Birthday was celebrated by the Governor-General on the 15th March, by a reception held in the morning, but invitations were sent out by the Municipality Department, and separate times fixed for the different sections. The Indian Attache was invited in ithe absence of His Majesty’s Consul. .On the Nauruz Day (21st March) general invitations were issued to His Majesty’s Consul and other foreigners in the station. * The King’s Birthday was celebrated in the usual manner on the 3rd June, when the reception, which was held in the morning, was attended by the Governor- General^ his assistant, the chiefs of the Police and Municipality, the European community and Heads of foreign firms. A dinner was given in the evening, to which the four Persian officials men tioned above and all members of the European colony were invited. The Governor-General, when consulted by H. M.’s Consul about the selec- tion of guests, discouraged the idea, of sending the invitations to any other local officials. While driking the King’s health at dinner, however, His Excellency delivered an unusually friendly speech, which was reciprocated by H. M.’s Con sul in a suitable reply. 3. Imperial Bank of Persia and Trade in general. —Messrs. V. H. Glendening and J. F. Luttrell remained as Manager and Accountant respectively throughout the year. Business continued to be dull during the year. There was a slight improve ment in the carpet industry in the early summer, as the result of an increased demand, chiefly from New York, for Kerman rugs and carpets. This improve ment, however, fell away in the autumn and the industry resumed its former depressed condition. No permanent revival in the carpet business can of course be looked for until the world-trade itself revives. Activity in other commodities, such as piece-goods, sugar, etc., was negli gible. Money was, as usual, farfro^m plentiful throughout the year. 4. Church Missionary Society. — {a) General. —The Rev. H. E. J. Biggs, continued to discharge the duties of Chaplain throughout the year. Three Persian converts—two assistans in the C. M. S. Hospital and a Per sian envangelist in the employment of the Church Missionary Society who had taken leading parts in a Persian Service in the Ci M. S. Church on the 10th December, were summoned on the following day to the Ta’minat branch of the local Police Department, and, after some cross-examination by a Police detective, who had been present at the Service, made to sign undertakings not to preach Christianity or speak against Islam any more, failing which they were told that they would be kept under detention and, in the ease of the evangelist, that he would be charged with espionage ! As a matter of fact the latter refused to undertake anything further than that he would not preach against Islam, but he was told by the Police authorities that this would be sufficient for their, purpose, as preaching in any other religion was tantamount to speaking against Islam.30 In the meantime, the evangelist’s house was searched by the detectives, without anything of a serious nature being found. One or two letters which the rvangeUst had written to a British Missionary m Kerman from the districts, had already been intercepted by the Police, as the result of which the writer had been placed under secret observation. The same detective, accompanied by two Policemen presented himself at the door of the Mission Church on Christmas Day while a Persian Holy Commu- nion was being observed, and demanded entry. As the presence of un-confimed Zsons at Holy Communion is considered by the Church authorities to be con- Irarv to the rules, Rev. H. E. J. Biggs, the Parson, refused to let him in After some altercation and an attempt by the detective to prevent some of the Per sia™ converts from attending the Communion Service the detective was per- ^fldwl to visit Dr Dodson, the Senior Medical Missionary, who apparently Znaged to appease him, ami so he contented himself with being present at the general Persian Service which was held in the Church shortly afterwards. The above incidents have caused some alarm to the British Missionaries in Kerman who are of opinion that serious interference on the part of the local authorities with their evangelical work would make their further residence in the country impossible. The local Police, on the other hand, are said to have argued that any gather ing to which a detective could not gain admittance was illegal, according to their standing orders, and would have to be stopped. Later on Dr. Dodson called upon the Chief of the Police and obtained a verbal promise that there would he no further repetition of such interference. How far this promise will be kept remains to be seen. (b) Boys’ School—Mr. F. T. B. Snow, M.A. (Cantab), remained in charge of the Boys’ School throughout the year. The return of Rev. R. Illiff from Shiraz in September, for school work in Karman, acted as a great impetus to the C. M. S. education work in this place. A high percentage of the boys, who had been prepared for the Government primary Certificates, were successful in their examinations. Games and Sports—In spite of the small number of pupils (38) in the beginning of the year, the junior Eleven (under 165 cms. in height) won the open competition in Kerma, winning all their matches and not having a single goal scored against them. The Eleven were presented with silver medals by the Governor-General. The usual inter-house competitions were held during the year in all games. At the close of the summer term a camp was again held and attended by a large number of masters and boys. In accordance with Government regulations the 5th class was closed, but two higher classes were opened, viz.,, a 9th and a 10th and numbers increased from 38 to 65. It is the aim of the school at present to open a new higher class each year until the 12th class is reached. On the whole the year has been a satisfactory one in spite of the loss of the Primary Department in 1932. (e) Girls’ School .—The Girls’ School received a set-back during the yearly the departure of Miss J. F. Woodroffe, the Head Mistress, who left for England early in September, in order to complete her B.A. course, without which, accord ing to the new regulations of the Persian Ministry of Education, she could not run her school. Miss. J. G. Moore, Evangelist, took temporary charge grom M 1SS : Woodroffe, until the arrival, in October, of Miss. J. M. Darlington, who remained in charge for the rest of the year. At present there are 50 girls attending the Girls ’ School. There have been a few new pupils and several applicants, who wanted to join Form six, have na to he refused admittance, owing to Government orders. The staff this year are pupil teachers who hope to take their English tenth Certificate this spring and will, it is expected, be ready for the Persian Eleven Certificate in 1935. The annual examinations were held last June, with very good results. Te girls took the Persian VI certificates and all passed. Six girls and six teacher took the Persian IX and all passed. The first and second in each of these exan nations were from the C. M. S. Girls’ School.Seven girls took the English Primary Certificate examination and one failed. So far, there has been little opportunity of developing the recreational side, of the work, but Miss Darlington hopes that, as soon as the weather is warmer, she may be able to start a games period before school every morning. (d) Medical. —Dr. Gr. E. Dodson remained in charge of the Medical Mission throughout the year, assisted by Dr. (Miss) E. E. G. Baillie, who was in charge of the Women’s Hospital during the second half of the year. When the medical Mission was started in Kerman in 1901, some 28 in-patients were treated in a small Persian House during the whole year. The statistics given below will show, in contrast, the work done in. 1933, and the two proceeding years, in efficient buildings planned for the treatment of sick folic :■— 1931. 1932. 1933. Number of in-patients 805 699 782 Number of out-patients (new) .. 5,968 6,429 6,326 Repeat visits 16,680 21,981 19,767 City visits 2,125 4,589 2,701 Major operations 529 529 642 During the year an electrically driven centrifugal pump was installed by Mr, P f . Oddy in the Medical Officers’ quarters and both men’s and women’s Hospitals wired for electric lighting. In the absence of accumulators, the light is only supplied while the engine is drawing water. The Pathological work was greatly improved by Mr. A. Robertson and ex cellent work is being now done in this department. W 'elfare work. —The. Welfare centre under Miss E. M. Robinson, has been going strong, in. spite of Miss E. C. H. Stratton’s absence. The latter, who had proceeded on leave to England in October 1932, returned to this work in Decem ber. Below are the statistics for the last three years :— Number of confinements .. Visits to Patients’ homes .. Patients attending centre .. Repeat visits 1931. 1932. 1933. 76 92 89 .. 1,614 1,936 2,049 . . 347 321 274 .. 1,125 1,125 867 5. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited. —The propaganda in connec tion with the cancellation, by the Persian Government, of the D ’Arcy concession continued in the early part of the year, by the local papers inserting articles on the same lines as those published in Tehran. The news of the eventual settlement of the dispute was received for the most part with a feeling of satisfaction and relief, though certain individuals among the disaffected parties tried to make out the whole thing as a sham quarrel machinated by the British Government in order to ensure the validity and secure the extension of the agreement. There has been a distinct improvement in the Company’s business in Kerman, as a result of the energetic interest taken in the w T ork by Mirza Abdul Hussein Khan (Saif-Ul-Mamalik), and also due to the fact that, for some time past, the competition by the Russian agents in this place has slackened consider ably. 6. Carpet Trade and Spinning Mill Pro/ert.—The exports in Kerman carpets and tribal rugs, expressed in thousands of Rials, during 1933 and the thiee pre ceding years, were as follows :— 1930. 1931. 1932. 1933. Kerman carpets and rugs Tribal rugs 13,140 12,079 913 888 8,591 11,540 1,200 930 Lcl29FD32 It will be noticed that there was an increase in the case of Kerman cam compared with the previous year, of nearly three million Rials, due, as inent’ S | elsewhere, to an increased demand from New York in the early summer the fact that the goods exported were on a whole of a higher quality than u i and, therefore, more expensive. Sua « The amount of tribals exported, on the other hand, shows a decrea^p nf m t 270,000. , 01 KlaI s, ’ j j « :. a j The total amount of exports in Keiman and tribal goods during the v therefore, improved by just over 2f million Rials, which considerino- the denr ed condition of trade in general and the fall in the dollar is more than cn i n 8 ' expected. 1)6 ^ A 7 - tcUll As regards the technical side of the industry, marked improvements haw been effected in the actual weaving, chiefly as the result of a better anal,'tv I woollen yarn produced by carding machines during the last two or three but the standard ot design and colour combination has on the whole deterinwt ed m recent years. Spinning Mill Project—The idea of importing spinning mill for Kerman for ne ocal manuiacture of cotton yarn, introduced by Lieutenant-Colonel E \V (J Eoel m IdoO and followed up by the local authorities in 1931, fell through in the IV \ ]J art ^ ie 7V r ’ dll( b V tiie i na bihty of the Kerman share-holders to raise ie lull amount of the capital required and as the result of representations made to lehan, orders were received for the re-inbursement to the share holders of ttar bofofe ^ ''' thom ^ the Persian National Bank more than a mduced suclfshalelehto^as belonged'’to tt^TemaV'town^to a^to*^ 50,000 and 60 000 which Iva.sh'o'f!''’ .^'^ re f or ®&gt; amounted to between Rials, 100,000. ’ ’ 1Cl1 ' as t0 be raisod by further subscription to Tomans tio„ 8 T trfoXSr S orl naU L f0rmed in Jnne - bat toher subscri„. their shares in thSm^ ^ eluded in Tehran early ufcVlmr'Lif l]'r'' a mac ' dne wa s, however, con- have the machinery delivered at Bandor t hn” 1 A™ 1 . 8 ’ who undertook to at a total cost of Rials 180 0007,7 i V as Vl^in a period of three months, the German firms concerned caid n ^ Russian Engineer in the emplovment of the building operations ^ fhe ^l ^V 0 I ? rman in November to supervise The work of 1?^^ !°\ ‘ he section of the plant, at the time of writing. ‘ c , ome ’ u hat elaborate scale is progressing It is doubtful what advantages -nnii Ur, • -i i plant, especially in view of the fW I e &gt; § ’ ailie( ^ the importation of fins Plants in Kerman, o^r a British ^ 0 ^ re are V rea ^^ two wool carding The Oriental Carpet Manufacturer/It’'S' V a ? hlne ’ belonging to Messrs. 10 1 l P- machine, imported from Genmnv conGern ’ aTld the other ’ a weavers m Kerman.

In all cases the Amnieh took prompt action, sometimes in co- »—operation with the military, to pursue the robbers and in a few cases the stolen property was partly recovered. yte- For some time past cars are being escorted on the dangerous sections of the ' rs ^ above route, and prevented from travelling at night, by men from the Amnieh Regiment, who are often a cause of great inconvenience and the advantages of whose presence are now and again counter-balanced by the disappearance of '.^various useful articles, such as loaves of sugar, etc. fthreef On the whole, however, security was fairly well maintained and to robberies employ of importance took place on the other roads in the province during the year.

U) Aviation, —No aeroplanes visited Kerman during the last two years. The aerodrome prepared by the Military authorities some years ago five miles due east of Kerman, which is 100 by 85 ynrds, with a shelter on the south side having been found unsuitable, was never used and has, thereioie, remained neglected. The few Junker planes that visited Kerman between 1928 and 1931 used a piece of land about 400 by 80 yards situated some live miles to the N. W. X. of Kerman town. Tt .T&gt;nrnl (Invp.rnmeM and Politics. 8. Condition of the country.—The maintenance of law and order throughout the province continues. A man of the Amnieh Regiment and a tribesman from the district of Aqta’ were executed Tor highway robbery, and several others were awarded various, terms of imprisonment for the same offence dming the ear. In the early summer, Hussein Khan (Shuja’ Sultan) Chief of the Buchaqchi tribe, who was an officer in the Amnieh and for some time in charge of tho Kerman-Bandar Abbas motor road, was suspected of being in collusion with robbers and imprisoned by the military authorities. The discovery of several rifles and a quantity of ammunition in this man’s house, some time later, eon- ffrined the suspicions against him. The chief improvement effected in the administration pf the province during recent years would appear to be the decrease of corruption, especially nniong the higher officials, brought about bv the frequent visits of inspectors from Tehran and by the fact that complaints made to the Shah are nearly always taken up and the authorities concerned called upon for explanation. Apart from individual inspectors, a Commission of Enquiry, composed of representatives from the various Ministers and Administrations, visited Kerman during the year. Reports about large bands of tribesmen from Ears looting villages in jb district of Sirjan at the end of April caused some alarm to the local authorities, who were at first afraid that it might be the result of the activities of the military columns, despatched from Ears and Kerman to disband tribes who were moving up to their summer quarters. As it transpired later, however, the matter liad been exaggerated, as only 7 a few sheep and some other unimportant property had been carried away by 7 a small band of poorly 7 -armed outlaws from the dis tricts of Shahr-Babek and Pariz, one of whom was captured and brought id 0 Kerman. Rumours reached Kerman at the close of the year that the fort of Mnzaipn in Ears, which had defied the Government forces for so many y 7 ears, had at las been taken by troops from Shiraz and that the leaders had surrendered. 9. Local officials and departments .—His Excellency Mirza Sayyed Musta 8 Khan Kazimi, Governor-General, Kerman, left for Tehran on the 21st An gas, Governor-General. ostensibly on leave. Within a few days atw his denartiire, however, the appointment Mirza Abul Hassan Khan Peernia (Mn’azid-us-Saltoneh) to the post ^ announced. The latter arrived early in September and held the post of bo ernor-General for the rest of the year. Kerman, f ro111 August It will be remembered that Peernia was Governor-General, 1929 to June 1930. Though an official of the old school, Peernia seems to he truly 7 loyal to 1 new regime and cherishes progressive views. Amone* other things. His Exce* n-noy is interested in mines and road making. His relations with the Cons* 1 ' have been courteous but formal.35 Amii Kliaa Suhrabian (a Persian Armenian) held the post of Provincial Director oi finance throughout the year aud being a capable and tactful Finance and Revenue. oihcial, the administration of the Finance t , , Department in this province has improved all round since his appointment. An official of this department was put under arrest eaiiy m the year on a charge of misappropriating money while holding the post of Financial Assistant at Bam and Baft. Opium.—ihe. outturn for the opium harvest was slightly smaller than the previous year, amounting to just over 2,000 Tabriz Mans. The amount of taxed opium issued to shop-keepers by the Monopoly Department for local con sumption 111 the province, during the year, amounted to about 3,500 Mans, the shortage being made up by supplies from other provinces. . . r ^ lie income of the Monopoly Department on taxes was, therefore, about one million Rials, which is probably a record so far as Kerman is concerned. Searching of houses of all classes of the inhabitants on the least suspicion wa,s more frequent than before, although the actual quantity of contraband opium confiscated was practically negligible. The total fines awarded for smuggling during the year amounted to between 7 and 8 thousand tumans, but only a small proportion of this was actually realised, as most of the parties concerned served the required terms of im prisonment iii lieu of fines. As the result of enquiries made by a special inspector who arrived from Tehran in August, the person in charge of the Monopoly godown was put under arrest in connection with a shortage in the stocks of opium amounting to nearly Rials. 40,000. _ There was little or no smuggling from the other provinces and no exports during the year. There are no indications as to any decrease in the number of opium addicts. Herr C. Meyer remained in charge of the National Bank of Persia until the end of September, when, his resignation having been accepted, he handed National Bank Of Persia. ov f charge to M. Joseph Bahoshi, a naturalised Persian Subject, said to be of Arab or Syrian origin. M. Bahoshi appears to be a marked improvement on his predecessor in deal ing, with the Persians and in the conduction of business in general, and, in spite of the fact that the terms offered by the Imperial Bank of Persia were on the whole more favourable than those of the National Bank, the latter are said to have handled a greater proportion of the banking business during the year. No new branches were opened in the province during the year, but the project of establishing an office at Bam was being studied by the Manager at the close of the year. Yawar Sayyed Sadiq Khan Sheikh-ul-Islami held the charge of the Police Department until the middle of July, when he was relieved by Yawar Sayyed Yusuf Khan Khatimi, who held the post of p0 lce - Commissioner for the rest of the year. The prestige of the Police force in Kerman, which had improved under Sayyed Sadiq Khan, appears to have suffered since the arrival of the new chief, who is said to be not nearly as efficient as his predecessor. The dealings of the Police authorities with the Consulate have been stiff and formal. Mirza Riza Khan Tajaddud held the post of Chief Judge of the Appeal Court Kerman throughout the year. It will be remembered that the Appeal Courts Tugtiee for Kerman and Khuzistan had been amalga- ~ ' u 1 e ' mated during the previous year and that the staff of the Appeal Court, Kerman, had, therefore moved to Khuzistan in December 1932, returning to Kerman in the month of May of the following year. Intimation was, however, received from Tehran in the middle of the year that arrangements were being made for the institution of an independent A.pneal Court in Khnzistan and that in future it would not be necessary for the staff M the Appeal Court, Kerman to move to Khuzistan in the winter months. The project of extending the jurisdiction of the Bandar Abbas Adlieh Court to Sir inn, which had been under consideration in the latter part of 1932, did not LeI29FD36 materialise, and Sirjan still continues to be in the Kerman Adlieh jurisdic tion. In view of the accumulation of work in the Bedayat (first instance) Court in Kerman, orders were received from J_ eh ran eailj m the jeai to establish m additional court, under one ot the reserve judges ot the Appeal Court, to (k-d with criminal cases exclusively. As the result of investigations made by Shahshahani, an Inspector from the Ministry of Justice, into charges of corruption brought against certain officials of the Adlieh Department in Kerman. Sayyed Ali Khan Kabir, Public Prosecutor of the Bedayat Court, and Sayyed Muhammad Ali Jandaqi, one of the leading pleaders, were put under arrest in the month of June. They were eventually released on bail and proceeded to Tehran for trial. Mirza Sayyed Muhsin Khan Tmad, the Investigating Judge, was placed ou the waiting list in the same connection. In suite of all this, there has been no noticed improvement in the administra tion of Justice in the province, and the dilatory methods ruling in the local courts have gone from bad to worse since the transfer of Dawar to the Finance Office. Benistralion of property .—Mohamad Hassan Khan Shahpuri (Iqtidar-us- Sultanj, formerly a Judge in the Appeal Court, Kerman, was appointed Chief of the Registration Office, Kerman in the month of August, but the Registration Office did not start functioning until the latter part of November. The Kerman town and environs have been divided into different _ sections, the time allowed for the registration of property in respect of each section being two months, which can be extended to three months, if necessary. The regsitration fees amount to 1.25 per cent, of the ^ value, excluding the ‘ preliminary expenses ’, which vary from Rials. 6 to Rials. 500 for property valued up to Tomans 50 and over Tomans 50,000, respectively. A peculiar problem has cropped up in connection with the registration of property by the fact that a large number of shops in this province hold what is locally called the right of ‘ Sarqufli ’, originating in the privilege enjoyed by the first occupant to transfer his ‘ right of priority ’ to other parties. The money which has in this way changed hands, from time to time, amounts in many cases to three or four times the actual value of the property concerned, and such shops are, therefore, left with two owners, each of whom draws a separate rent. As there appears to be no provision in the laws of the country to deal with this extra ownership, the Registration authorities refuse to recognize the right of the ‘ Sar-qufli ’ owners and the latter have therefore made representations to Tehran on the subject. Prince Afsar remained in charge of the Post and Telegraph Department Posts smd Teleeraohs throughout the year. The delivery arrange- tP ' ments so far as maiis are concerned are still not as satisfactory as could be desired. Mirza Sayyed Ja’far Khan Nabavi, who took over the offices and lines from the Indo-European Telegraph Department in Kerman in 1931, arrived from Tehran at the end of June, to supervise the disposal of the remaining property left by the Indo-European Telegraph Department of which several lorry loads were despatched to Tehran in the month of September. Mirza Hassan Khan Jaudat, who held the post of Director of Education in Ednratinn Kerman since December 1927, was recalled in . ' . _ the month of August, and Mirza Abdul Karim Khan Ibrahimi, the Assistant Director, remained in charge for the rest of the year. ^ A sixth class was Ridded to the Shahpur School, one of the three Government Primary Schools in Kerman, in the month of December, and arrangements sire being made to open a new girls’ school, with four primary classes, in one of the suburbs of the town. At the present moment the budget of the Education Department in this province amounts to Rials 574,050 in the year. \ ars i School which had to close down its middle classes for want of funds (Hiring- 1932, managed to start a seventh and an eighth class, chiefly with ic help of charitable subcriptions from Bombay, during the year.1 \oW rstin PealCj, Jtue, | fetasii m\ (jf s appoiit ttleS^ Qk iachfffe: ry. e rem: trr to fe liveff ceniedy iW ■gS 0 ;G# n#' Xatb Sar^aaMg Abdullah Khan Tumaj remained in Command of the Amnieh Amnieh. liegiment in this province throughout the the year, Sarhang Baqir Khan of the Central Amnieh Administration arrived from r frufi ?^p 1SpeCtl °i- ear1 ^ and Amir Lashkar Zarghami, the Gene^ ral Officer Commanding, visited Kerman in the month of May. In view it is understood, of the Amnieh authorities’ inability to cope with the various road robberies, which became rather too frequent in the earlv Bum mer, Is aib Sarhang iumag received instructions from Tehran, in the month of July, to take his orders from the Officer Commanding Kerman Brigade and this arrangement remained in force until the end of the year. Several cases of irregularity on behalf of the Amnkh Officers and Non- Commissioned Officers stationed in the various outposts in the province were brought to notice during the year. The main artery road cut through middle of the town from east to west Municipality. an( ^ called the Kheyaban-i-Sliahpur was com- . • , * , . ‘ , P leted during the year, with the exception of ■certain sections which will still have to be levelled up and metalled. A new road leading from the above to the main bazaar was taken in hand by the er-Governor-Creneral and finished during the year. A large circus at ihe east end of the new main road was also begun early in the year but left unfinished due to want of funds and the recall of the cr-Governor-General at the end of August. Sections of the balustrade round this circus sank in at the latter part •of the year as the result of the ground being flooded for cultivation, . old cemetery on the east side of the city, in which dead bodies were being buried until quite recently, was plotted out by the cr-Governor-General, with a view to providing land to the inhabitants whose houses had been demo lished to make room for the construction of the new roads. As the result of representations made to Tehran, however, the Governor-General received orders in the month of March not to interfere with the cemeteries any longer. But several plots had already been disposed of and houses built on the site. A new cemetery, which was started by the ea;-Governor-General some two or three miles outside the city, to replace the old one, and on which a considerable amount of the Municipality funds had been spent, w^as, therefore, abandoned'' without having been completed or used. The yearly allowance allotted to the Kerman Municipality from Tehran, for construction work and general improvement of the city, was reduced at the beeinning of the current Persian year (21st March) from Tomans 20 000 to S,00G, All available funds, including a sum of Tomans 18,000, subscribed from other provinces and collected locally for distribution among those who had suffered from the floods of the previous year, were used up on construction work, by Ihe er-Governor-General, on whose recall to Tehran in the month of August the Municipality was left with a large deficit. To make matters worse, the pay of the various Health Departments was struck off the general budget from the beginning of November, and the Kerman Municipality were to make their own arrangements for the payment of the Health services in their own area from that date onwards. With the exception of the reduced - allotment of Tomans 8,000 referred to above, the Municipality will have to find all their requirements locally. The lighting of the Municipal area by electricity alone is costing over- Rials 10,000 each month. It is needless to say that very little construction work is being carried on under the present circumstances. The Municipal tax of 3 per cent, on private houses was finally fixed by the new Governor-General on the basis of a nominal rent of 3 per cent. Houses let out on lease will have to pay 8 per cent., while those valued below Rials. 4,000 will be exempt from tax. The above tax, which is being collected gradually for the last three years, is expected to amount to over Tomans. 50,000 in the year.A representative of the Syndicate from Tehran, said to he a Polish- Sub ject, visited Kerman m February to study the Agriculture. question of improving the methods for pre paring dried fruit for export. Unusual frosts in the early spring caused considerable damage to the fruit blossom. There was decrease in the amonut of wheat and barley harvest in the vicinity of Kerman town, during the year, due to damage done to the under ground water channels by the floods of the previous summer, which has been estimated at 500,000 Mans. It will be some time before all these channels can be restored to their former condition. Locusts .—No locust invasion of the province was brought to notice during the year. Mirza Mohamad Ali Khan Dabir Uahi, the Chief Census Officer for Area o ■ A t T No. 6, including Kerman and Persian Baluchis- _ J ' fan died in June and Mirza Abdullah Khan Isfandiari, a Census Officer on leave from Tehran, was placed in charge until the end of August, when, having been summoned to Tehran, he handed oyer acting charge to Samzadeh, the next senior official. Murtiza Mirza Qahramani was eventually appointed Chief Census Officer for this area in October and remained in charge for the rest of the year. Sartip Farajullah Khan, Director-General of the Census Administration in Persia, arrived from Tehran, on a tour of inspection, at the end of November and returned to Tehran in the middle of December. Qahramani visited Iranshahr and Khwash at the end of the year to estab lish a Census Office for Persian Baluchistan. In spite of many warnings issued to the inhabitants of Kerman, there are still a large number of people who have not yet applied for a paper of Identifica tion. In accordance with a circular received from Tehran at the’end of the year, the ( ensus authorities have started sending men round to each house and calling upon each person to produce his or her Identity paper. ^‘ 0( °l Poetics. I he fall of Timourtash and the arrest of the War i mister, at the end of the year, apart from giving rise to many wild and con ic mg rumours, have created a subdued feeling of resentment and suspicion agains 1 le present regime, especially among the disaffected, whose number is decidedly on the increase. . ,.

Most of the baths, however retain the newly introduced shower bath arrangement. v A . teIe f ra ™ wa ® received by the Governor-General in the beginning of November to the effect that the pay of the various Health Departments had been struck off the general budget from the 1st of that month and that the res- pectne Municipalities would have to make arrangement for the payment of the Health services m their own areas from that date onwards. . Consulering the already impoverished condition of the Kerman Munici- pahty unds, it is feared that the Health arrangements in this province will sutler badly unless the decision is re-considered by the Central Government. 12 ' 1 ^ lss 1 mn T r ade Interests. —The local merchants were warned by Tehran through the local authorities early in the year against dealing with the Russians individually. They were further told that purchases from the Soviet Trad^ Representatives had to be made by a company, to be formed by the traders foi^ the purpose, and transactions carried out with the knowledge of the Persian Government. There was on the whole little or no Soviet trade activities in Kerman during the year. &amp; rr k ^ iss ^ an Trade Agent, a notable local merchants, who proceeded to Tehran m June, got into trouble with the Police in connection with his relations with the Soviet authorities and kept under detention until October, since when although released, he is still under Police observation and unable to return to Kerman. Consequently the Soviet competition in connection with the sale of petrol and kerosme also died down and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s Agent mono polised practically the whole market. 13. Military and Conscription. —Sarhang Muhammad Khan Maimand who was promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General (Sartip) in March, remained in command of the Kerman Brigade throughout the year. In order to safeguard against the men suffering from ill-health in hot places like Bandar Abbas, orders were received by the Military authorities early in the ^ eai to supply these stations with recruits from down-country conscrip tion areas. The Military detachment operating in Bashakird under Naib Sarhang Mir Hussein Khan returned to Kerman in the middle of May. Naib Sarhang Ali Khan Muhajir, the Officer Commanding the Razmju Infantry Regiment of the Kerman Brigade, who had led a military expedition to the Gahkum country, returned to Kerman in November, bringing back with him a quantity of arms and ammunition and a number of prisoners accused of murder and brigandage. The discipline of the military forces in the province continues to be good. Conscription. —Naib Sarhang Farajullah Khan Mushar remained in charge of the Conscription Department throughout the year. 14. Persian Baluchistan and Rudhar. —Persian Baluchistan being now sepa rated from Kerman, except as regards Road and Census Administrations, there are few relations between the two provinces, and little or no news reaches Kerman from Baluchistan. LcJ 29FD l* 40 Baluch raids, which were so frequent in former days in the Kerman pro- vince, have ceased for the last two or three years. Rudbar .—The authorities have now got the districts of Jirfut and Rndbar well under control. The once all-powerful Zargham-us-Saltaneh is now reduced to a nonentity. Most of his estates have been attached by the Finance authori ties on account of arrears of revenue due from him, and his son and son-in-law have been under detention in Kerinan^for the last year or two, in connection with certain law suits, both civil and criminal.

Administration- Report of the Political Agency, Muscat, for 193, Part I. ^howii A l ency 0 ff' c ' ials -— T V^ following officials held charge of the Agency as Major C. E. U Bremner, M.C., from 1st January to 23rd March and from 17th June to 31st December. Captain R. G. E. W, Alban officiated as Political Agent from 24th March to loth June. The post of Medical Officer in Charge of the Agency Hospital and of Quaran tine duties was held by Captain (now Major) D. L. Mackay, I.M.D., from 1st January to 3rd May when he proceeded on leave. Charge was re-assumed bv him on 18th November. From 4th May to 17th November medical charge of the Agency and Quaran tine Medical Officer's duties was held by Subordinate Medical Service Officer G. B. Yemkanmadri in addition to his own duties as sub-medical officer. The post of the Treasury Officer was held by Mr. S. P. Pereira from 1st January to 31st March, when he proceeded on pension having been invalided from the service. From 1st April to 14th June the post of Treasury Officer was held by Mr. V. B, Menezes who carried out the duties of Treasury Officer till relieved by Mr. A. S. Norton on 15th June, since which date the latter has continued to officiate. 2. Agency Hospital and Medical .—The total number of patients treated dur ing the year was 8409 comprising 110 in and 8299 out-patients. The number shows a decrease of 148 on the number treated during the previous year. The daily average of cases treated was 91. Malarial fevers, skin and eye diseases were the most prevalent complaints. I 525 operations were carried out during the year. Smallpox broke out in epidemic form early in February and, abating some what in March, was rife again in epidemic form in May and remained so until the port was declared free of this disease early in November. Vaccinations were carried out on a large scale in Muscat, Matrah and the neighbouring villages. The public willingly submitted to vaccination whilst the ravages of the disease were actively apparent and over 10,000 persons were vaccinated. The cost of vaccine was met by the Muscat State. No cases were treated for poisoning. Post Mortem examinations. Nil. Sanitary conditions remained the same as in previous years and can only bo described as' deplorable. The indifference of even the better classes of the popu lation, combined with the lack of adequate financial resources at the disposal of the State has conduced to a state of affairs in Muscat and Matrah that can only be categorised as revolting. The task of the Quarantine Medical Officer under prevailing conditions is both arduous and thankless. Whilst smallpox is endemic throughout Arabia the virulent outbreak of this disease during the current year is definitely trace able to a party of Badakhshani pilgrims who landed unrestricted from a dhow ex-Karachi in January. Whilst every endeavour is made to deal with immigrants to Muscat, whether arriving by dhow or steamer, it is impossible in view of the very lax surveillance by the 'state authorities, who impose no form of adequate restriction on such persons to cope with the situation. It is hoped on the return of His Highness the Sultan to Muscat to secure the active co-operation of the responsible State Autho rities which is at present conspicuous by its absence. 3. Political Affairs .—The chief topics of political interest affecting His Maiestv’s Government or British subjects, being so closely linked with the affairs of the Local Government, are dealt with in Part H of this Report under the heading of “ Events of Political Interest in State Limits42 It is satisfactory however to note here that two important cases outstandimr from last year, U\, the “ Isa case ” at Gwadur, and that of Sheikh Ah bin Abdullah at Sur, have since been effectively dealt with. The commercial Treaty between His Majesty’s Government and the Sul tanate has been renewed as usual during the year. 4. Judicial. —Judicial matters form the subject of a separate report. £. Trade. —Whilst the effect of general financial depression is still very much in evidence, there are signs of a slight ie\i\al in tiade and the outlook of the trading community towards the end of the year under report was on the whole more optimistic than hitherto. The following figures, supplied by the Finance Department of the Muscat State, will show at a glance a comparison of the trade position for the rears 1932 and 1933 Year. \ ] Imports. Exports. 1931- 32 37,37,118 17,07,327 1932- 33 34,71,618 20,27,334 The apparent diminution of imports is attributable more to fall in the price of imported goods than to the quantity of imports, which is actually stated to be slightly higher than in 1932. The increasing influx of Japanese goods, chiefly confined to cloth and general dry goods, is largely responsible for the fall in price of imports. As hitherto the main articels of export have been (a) dry and wet dates, (b) dried fish, and (c) kasha or fish manure, whilst imports have been composed chiefly of flour, rice, sugar, coffee, cloth and general dry goods. Owing to a sufficiency of rains in the interior and on the Batinah coast the date crop has exceeded in quantity and quality any that has been gathered in the five years. At the commencement of the date season excellent rates were obtained but a subsequent fall in the prices of the Beser date in the Bombay market led to considerable disappointment in the Batinah, whose staple crop consists of this poorer variety of dates. The recent prohibition of the import into Germany of kasha is viewed with alarm for the future as Germany has hitherto proved to be one of the chief buyers of this commodity. Generally speaking it is hoped that the rock bottom of prices and depression has been reached but, none the less, extreme caution is still observed by the trading community. 6. (A) BoyaJ Navy.—Visits of H. M. Ships and Royal Air Force craft to Muscat are detailed in Appendix “ A ” of this report. During the year under report neither Service was called on for active participation in affairs concerned with this Agency but the Senior Naval Offi- eor, Persian Gulf kindly placed H.M.S. “ Shoreham ’’ at the disposal of the Political Agent to convey him and the Sultan’s representative to Sur on 17th February, and, on 25th of that month, the same sloop conveyed the Political Agent and IBs Highness the Sultan to Gwadur and back for the settlement of local affairs. t&gt; t? 11 ^ Ecrwey”, whilst en route to Bombay transported the 1 oliticai Agent to Khor Jarama to meet a flying boat at that point. . The visit of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet to Muscat during October, on their return from a friendly visit to the Arab Sheikhs of the T rucical Coast, had an appreciable and most beneficial effect locally. (B) Royal Air R orce. During the year under report considerable pr°' gress has been made m consolidating the Muscat-Dhofar link of the Basrah* Aden route.

The hopes that it would be possible to establish an emergency landing ground at Kalba lor the use of Imperial Airways have not matured owin^ to ttie obdurate attitnde oi the Sheikh of this place. An emergency landing ground has been selected therefore at Shinas and is now available for use. 8. Foreign Interests. —American interests remained in the hands Political Agent during the year. of the The French Consulate remained closed but Monsieur Cassin, the French Vice-Consul at Dushire, paid a short un-official visit to Muscat in March. During his stay, his chief concern was the repair of the French Consulate building and the finding out of such little French property that still remains in Muscat. Monsieur Cassin left for India on the 17th March to obtain his pilot’s cer tificate as an aviator and, on his return journey, came ashore for a few hours only. 9. Missionary Endeavour .—The work of the American Mission (The Dutch Reformed Church of the D. S. A.) was in the main carried on by the Revd Mr. and Mrs. Dykstra and Doctor and Mrs. Harrison. Dr. Storm, who returned from Dhofar in January, proceeded on a short tour to Sur, before taking loiw leave in April. The new Mission Hospital at Matrah though not yet fully completed was opened in October and the Medical Officer in charge (Dr. Harrison) has since occupied his new residence which adjoins the hospital. Both hospital and residential quarters are equipped throughout with every modern convenience including electric light and fans, runping water in baths and closets, septic tanks, refrigerators and labour saving devices in the kitchen department. The entire residential quarters and essential portions of the hos pital are fi 3 r -proofed throughout. Inspite of adverse financial conditions the responsible Mission authorities considered the foregoing as essentials to the health and well being of their staff. The buildings have been so designed, and constructed of such materials, as to obviate the necessity of “annual repairs ” for the next 15 years under normal conditions. 10. Slavery .—21 slaves, comprising 17 males and 4 females, took refuge in the Agency during the year and were manumitted in due course. 11. Climate .—The total rainfall during the year amounted to 4.3P' whilst the maximum and minimum temperatures registered were 112° in May and 55.3° in January respectively. 12. Official Visits. —H.M.S. “ Hawkins ”, Flagship of Vice Admiral H. E. Dunbar-Nasmith Commanding the East Indies Squadron visited Muscat on 24th October and left on the same day. H.M.S. “ Enterprise ” and H.M.S. “ Colombo ” both of the East Indies Squadron paid official visits to Muscat on 3rd April and 9th December respec tively. The visit of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet has already been referred to. Visits of Government Officials to this Agency are shown in Appendix “ B ” of this report. I cl29FDAdministration Report 1933. Part II. 1. Ruling Family—The mam problem that has continued to occupy Highness the Sultan. Saiyid Said bin Taimur, since his accession to the Sul tanate, has been the finances of the State. The measures taken to deal with the grave financial situation, and to mini, mise the effect of the cessation of the Arms Traffic subsidy, will be dealt witii under the appropriate heading. It may not be inopportune however to mention here that the fact that tie State is still solvent and that its revenues show a tendency to improve is largely due to. the Rulers ’ own energy and perspicacity in dealing with financial mat ters. In order to more eloselv familiarise himself with conditions prevailing his State, His Highness conducted a rapid tour of inspection through tlie Batinah between ist and 17th February. As a result of this tour the Sultan acquired much useful information as, to the possibilities of increasing his revenues without unduly enhancing the- burden of taxation for his subjects. On the 20th February His Highness, accompanied by the Political Agent, embarked on H.M.S. “ Shoreham ” for Gwadur there to finally dispose of tk Esa case, which was fully referred to in last year’s report. From personal investigation of the affair His Highness was fully satisiled that the Wali of Gwadur had failed conspicuously in his duty both in this case and in many other matters. The Wali in consequence was. summarily dismissed service and removed to Muscat. The Baluch community, whom His Plighness held to be largely responsible for the equanamity and freedom with which the outlaw Esa had entered (brack was fined Rs. 1,000, of which sum Rs. 500 was paid to Bana, the Khoja victim of Esa’s assault, as compensation for his injuries. On return to Muscat the Sultan was fully occupied in the final arrangements for the administration of his Government during his absence on a protracted visit to his southern province of Dhofar. He set out on this jonrney in the State launch “ al-Saidi ” on 31st Mareli and, after twice narrowly averting shipwreck due to tempestuous seas, reached Dhofar safely some eight days later. The Political Agent visited His Highness at Salalah (Dhofar) on Ik December. It was certainly apparent that whilst the Sultan had undoubtedly benefited by his sojourn in Dhofar, his visit had not solely constituted a 1)click During the time he has spent there, His Highness has toured practically the whole of the Province, acquainting himself with the tribes and conditions, anti gradually consolidating his influence in these less civilised parts of his State. He has inaugurated Dhofar Customs on a sound basis and has also carded out many constructional improvements in Salalah and the neighbourhood. Whilst tllG advisability of the prolonged absence of the Ruler from the sk of his Go\ errment is open to question, there is considerable truth in His Ihg 1 ness s assertion that he has been enabled from a distance to gain a perspective of bis administration and to realise defects' in the same than h 18 had lemamed present at his headquarters. Whilst in no walk of life is a reduction in income welcomed, the necessity for the cut ia allowances and salaries was appreciated and accepted by allwe® bers ot the Ruling House with the exception of Saiyid Nadir. This individual, who is the eldest of His Highness’s uncles and at the ^ 1 receipt ol J ]je highest allowance next to that of the late Ruler paul, lie kuate, has seen lit to pose as an aggrieved person and to refuse his pay- example has fortunately not been emulated by others. &lt;2 • -i^r 0 ! 0 * to 8 * ^ ie ^ llPan » be. Saiyid Hamad (Wali oi : ahmud and Saiyid. Shahab together with a fourth member, have c tuted tie Muscat Council during His Highness’s absence. iQllStl-The Council as a whole appear to function fairly effectively though com posed of warring functions. They are somewhat averse however to facin'*’ responsibility, which is no doubt attributable to the somewhat restricted powers accorded to them by His Highness. r, ^PPointment of the Financial Adviser continued to be held by Cautaiu .hi. (x. hi. W. Alban till he proceeded on long leave in June. 2. State Finances.—It is not possible within the confines of this report to enter into a lengthy digest of the State Finances and it will suffice to give but a brief resume of the situation as it now stands. The opening balance at the commencement of the year showed a working credit (exclusive of debts due from the State to local creditors) of Rs. 90,460. By virtue of a considerable tightening up in the system of revenue collec tion, and by the enforcement of rigid economy and retrenchment, including a further reduction in July 1933 of the Civil List expenditure, the receipts ^ for 1933 show an increase of Rs. 10,834 over the previous year, whilst expenditure has been decreased by Rs. 32,449. The actual surplus of Receipts over Expenditure for 1933 amounts to Rs. 1,07,881, which compares favourably with the surplus of Rs. 64,598 in 1932. A close scrutiny of the State Budget proposals for 1934 would seem to show ample scope for yet further economy in expenditure without impairing the effi ciency of the Administration. In 1935 the Arms Traffic subsidy, amounting to Rs. 1,00,000 ceases. It is clear therefore that to compensate for this large loss and to regulate the debts due to local creditors, further economies will have to be effected and further means devised for increasing the State revenues. Neither problem should prove impossible of solution, particularly in view of the sanction recently obtained from certain Glovernments in Treaty alliance with the State for the revision of Import duties. 3. Events of Political Interests in State Limits. —In February the Political Agent accompanied by Saiyid Mahmud, deputed by His Highness for the pur pose, proceeded to Sur to interview Sheikh Ali bin Abdullah of Jaalan on his contumacious attitude towards the State {vide Administration Report for 1932). In spite of a full exposition of the situation and the greatest patience dis played by the Sultan, the Sheikh has failed to see reason and consequently his allowances have been held in abeyance. During the course of the year the State have had cause to lodge a protest at the infringement of Muscat territorial waters by an armed Persian Government dhow which anchored off Khassab, with a captured dhow in tow in June. The subject of the protest has elicited a categorical denial of the facts from the Per sian Government. Apart from a certain alleged uneasiness in the Batinah in November during the collection of Zakat revenues peace has prevailed throughout the Sultanate throughout the year, and no incidents of a political significance have occurred. 4. Events in Oman. —There have been no events of outstanding importance during the year. The usual crop of minor inter-tribal squabbles are reported but these have in no way repurcussed on Muscat. 5. Trade and General— This subject has already been dealt with elsewhere in this Report. 6 Muscat Ini antra —Command of the Muscat Infantry remained with Cap tain R. G.' Alban till the latter officiated as Political Agent from 24th March when it devolved on Subctdar Major Fateh Khan, The main occupation of the Corps during the hot weather and till the open ing of the leave season in August was the construction of a new Customs .jetty for the State.46 The advent of the leave season and the subsequent cessation of the work by His Highness’s orders has since considerably restored the men’s spirit. It is significant however to note that the further reduction to Ks. 20 per mensem as the pay of an askari has led to a distinct falling off in the keenness that formerly prevailed to join the Corps. But toi the general depression many of the rank and file would gladly apply for their discharge. C. E. U. BREMNER, Major, Political Agent and II. B. M.’s Consul, Muscat.49 CHAPTER VII.

The Senior Naval Officer’ Persian Gulf, in H. M. S. “ Shoreham ” with Colonel Loch, the Honourable the Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on board accompanied them. In order to add to the effect of the visit of the Flotilla it had been arranged for the Royal Air Force to give a Flying display at the same time. On Septem ber 23rd, Air Vice-Marshal C. S. Burnett, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O., Air Officer Com manding, ’Iraq Command, with a squadron of 8 Wapitis arrived at Debai. The Shaikh of Debai was absent, but his brother, acting for him, and the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman and Umm-al-Qawain, had assembled at Debai to greet the Flotilla. Colonel Loch held a Durbar on board H. M. S. “ Shoreham which was attended by all the above mentioned Shaikhs. The Shaikh of Has al Khaimah absented himself. _ Afterwards the party proceeded on board H. M. S. “ Diamond ” which gave a high speed demonstration together with a display of machine gun and gunnery target tiring. During the speed run the Wapitis carried out formation flying.* His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, Vice- Admiral M. E. Dunbar-Nasmith, V.C., C.B., in H. M. S. “ Hawkins ” in Novem ber visited Ajman, Debai, Sharjah, where he met the respective Shaikhs and the usual calls were exchanged. In April 1933, H. M. S. “ Ormonde ” carried out a survey of Sir Beni Yas Island and also took soundings off Debai, Sharjah, Ajman and Abu Musa Island. A viation .—The Imperial Airways Rest House at Sharjah on which construc tion had been started towards the end of 1932 was finally completed in April 19o3. Sharjah is now a night stop for both East and West bound machines. Imperial Airways weekly service operated throughout the year without incident. The Flying Boats of 203 (Flying Boat) Squadron based on Basra made a number of flights along the coast during the year. Air Officer Commanding—Air Vice-Marshal C. S. Burnett, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O., with a squadron of 8 Wapitis made a special flight to Debai in September 1933 in connection with the visit of the First Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediter ranean Fleet mentioned above. Shipping .—The British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited, con tinued their usual calls at Debai and extended them to Sharjah. Messrs. Frank C. Strick &amp; Co., Ltd., steamers continued to call at Debai as formerly. The German Hansa Line steamers continued to call at Debai during the year. Pearl Fisheries .—The number of pearls found was up to average, but the market was bad and the pearling season therefore cannot be considered a success ful one. The Debai boats made the best catches.50 Internal Affairs—The usual amount of petty tribal raiding, camel stealing and occasional murders took place in various places near the coast but there were no serious disturbances. In July a long standing quarrel between the Shaikhs of Ajman and Sharjah threatened to blaze out once more. The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, who at that time was touring the Trucial Coast, with the assistance of the Residency Agent, succeeded in patching up a truce between the parties. Up to the end of the year the truce had been maintained. Immigration of Baluchis from Persian Baluchistan. —As a result of the dis turbed state of Persian Baluchistan during 1933 and the consequent severity of the Persian military methods, numbers of Persian Baluchis fled to the Arabian Coast, In April, for instance, a body of 100 men, women and children arrived at Has al Khaimah. The Shaikh turned them out of his territory and they moved into Sharjah where they were allowed to settle. Slave Traffic. —The traffic was non-existent. 4 slaves escaped from their owners and took refuge ^ith the Residency Agent. Their cases were referred to the Political Resident who issued them with manumission certificates. Arms Traffic. —No cases under this heading were reported. T. C. FOWLE, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.« CHAPTER VIII. Administration Report of the Bahrain Agency for the year 1933. Personnel. 1. {a) Political Agent. — (i) Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Locli held charge nf the Agency until the 10th April, when he proceeded to Bushire to officiate for the 1 optical Resident, who was proceeding to England on deputation. During his absence, till the 23rd May, the Indian Assistant, Khan Bahadur ’Abdul Haiy al Hashnni, officiated as Political Agent, («) On the 11th July, Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch again proceeded to Bushire handing over charge of the Agency to Captain E. H. Gastrell. Lieuten- ant-Ooionel Loch returned from Bushire on the 1st November and took charge ot the Agency from Captain Gastrell. {b) Indian Assistant. —Khan Bahadur ’Abdul Haiy al Hashimi held charge of the post of Indian Assistant throughout the year. 2. Ruler of Bahrain and the Al Khalifah family. —( i ) His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifah, C.S.I., has been on excellent terms with the Agency throughout the year. On the 9th February he was presented a Kharitah from His Excellencv the Viceroy of India by the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian'Gulf at a Darbar held to celebrate his accession to the Rulership of Bahrain. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad has been accorded a personal salute of eleven gums. On the 9th December, His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin Tsa Al Khalifah proceeded to Kuwait in H. _M. S. “ Shoreham ” on a visit to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad bin Jabir, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Ruler of Kuwait. He returned on the 15th December, well pleased with the trip. («) On the night of the 3rd14th June a son, ’Isa, was born to Shaikh Salman, the Ruler’s eldest son. The event caused much rejoicing and news of it was received with noticeable interest by the Shaikh of Qatar and the Rulers of the Trucial Coast. , («/&lt;) On the 22nd November the widow of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Tsa bin ’Ali Al Khalifah left by sea for Mecca, where it is supposed that she will reside. It is said that she took with her a considerable amount of gold. {iv) Shaikh Muhammad bin Tsa Al Khalifah married a young daughter of his brother-i u-law, ’Abdullah bin Zaid, on the 13th July. His former wife died in 1932. {v) Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Tsa Al Khalifah has been on good terms with the Agency. {vi) Sliaikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifah is on excellent terms with the Agency aud is doing well on the Bahrain Courts. A son was born to him on the night of the 3rd 14th June. (vii) Shaikh Rashid bin Muhammad Al Khalifah has done good work as President of the Majlis al TJrfi. 3. Bahrain State. —(i) Mr. C. D. Belgrave held charge of the appointment of Financial Adviser and Commandant of Police throughout the year. {ii) Mr. C. C. L. de Grenier, Director of Customs and Port Officer, proceeded to India on short leave on the 18th July and returned on the 12th November. (Hi) Mr. W. B. Steele held charge of the appointment of State Engineer throughout the year. (iv) Mr. E. Bevor of Messrs. Whinney Murray and Company, Chartered Accountants, Baghdad, arrived on the 16th March to carry out an audit of the Bahrain Government accounts for 1352. 4. Bahrain Police. —The forces of law and order in Bahrain consist of the Armed Police and Naturs or night-watchmen. The latter are an irregular body, who do not wear uniform or perform any drill but are armed with long Lee Enfield rifles. (il) The Armed Police have posts in Hidd, Muharraq and Sakhir and supply guards in Manamah. In addition to their normal duties, the police took part in ceremonial parades and provided guards-of-honour on a number of occa- Lcl29FD52 ssinnq Their appearance invariably strikes visitors as excellent. The Natiirj are stationed in Manamah and Muharraq. (Hi) The strength of these bodies is given below Strength on 1-1-1933. Indian Police .. &gt; • * • Local Police .. • • * * 118 Q Followers Naturs ' * • * * 257 (iv) The replacement of Indian Police by local men has now been success- fully completed, the four Indians who now remain being Instructors. Four Arab Non-Commissioned Officers were sent for training with the IDth Baluch Regi ment at Karachi, and when they return they will be used as Instructors and will replace the Indians now employed. (v) The Bahrain Government have also ashed for the services of a Non- Commissioned Officer of the Indian Police to instruct the Armed Police in lathi drill. 5. Local Affairs—(i) There have been no agitations or Sunni Shi’ah quarrels during the year and in spite of hard times and unemployment there has been an unusually small number of serious crimes, though there has been an increase in petty thieving and pick-pocketing. (ii) The drink habit tends to spread and there has been an increase in the number of liquor cases. The vigilance of the Police and the severity of the punishments meted out to offenders has had a salutary effect and owners of illicit stills take the most careful precautions to conceal their apparatus and wares. (Hi) On the eve of the 1st January 1933 a girl aged 16 years was murdered (though custom would condone the act) by her uncles in circumstances of excep tional brutality for unchastity. The men then tied to Qatar where they are still at large. (iv) On the 10th January a Najdi stabbed a Bahrain subject over a few annas. The case was tried by the Political Agent, who sentenced the Najdi to death. The sentence was confirmed by the Governor-General in Council and the man was executed in Bahrain on the morning of the 10th April. 6. Oil Concession. — (i) The Bahrain Petroleum Company, Limited, have sunk live wells into the oil bearing stratum and are contemplating shipping at the rate of seven hundred tons a day from the middle of 1934. (ii) The Company have introduced a number of British subjects among their personnel and the figures stand Strength on 31-12-1933. 4 138 8 110 260 Class I— Superior Staff Class II— Clerical .. Camp Artisans Class Ill- British subjects. Americans. Bahrainis. Others, 8 19 4 1 1 -- 2 12 10 Servants Semi-skilled labour Unskilled 3 3 1 5 42 104 4 57 39 .. Artesian Wells. AUith a view to controlling the water supply the Bahrain Government issued a notice in March forbidding the boring of new wells vithou sanction and ordering that no more wells should be bored in the towns oiManamah, Muharraq, Hidd and Galali, where the waste water had already become a danger to public health. Orders were also given for the provision of suitable valves to prevent water being wasted and for the casing of all bores. Certain initial and annual fees have been laid down and provision has been made for inspection by a Government official. 8. Agriculture. —(i) The experimental orange trees have again borne excellent fruit and when and if more funds become available, it should be possible to develop this branch of agriculture. (n) A quantity of ‘ mesquit ’ seeds (a thorny quick growing tree suitable for firewood) were obtained from Dera Ismail Khan by the courtesy of Mr. B. J. Gould, Resident in Vv T aziristan ; and both seeds and seedlings have been given to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin ’Isa A1 Khalifah and to certain local indi viduals interested in agriculture. It was hoped that if the experiment was suc cessful large areas might be planted with them in order to avoid dependence on ’Oman and the Persian Coast for supplies of firewood. As, however, an oil industry is developing in Bahrain, there is not perhaps the same necessity, as there was in the past, for securing an home-grown supply of firewood. (m) An endeavour has been made by one firm (A. and M. Yatim) with an Indian agriculturist in partnership, to start a vegetable garden for English and Indian vegetables. The experiment was unsuccessful as the land was too exposed to the high winds which prevail in Bahrain. 9. Customs. —(i) The Customs revenue amounted to Rs. 5,53,393 as against Rs. 6,14-,594 collected during the previous year. The decline in commodity prices is chiefly responsible for this decline. (ii) The circumstances attendant on the visit of a ship, the S. S. “ Ahmedi ”, to Ras Tanurah in October 1932 raised with the Sa’udi Arab Government, the question of the levy of transit dues on cargo transhipped at Bahrain for ports on the mainland. Endeavours are being made to bring about a settlement of this dispute on terms agreeable to both countries. In the meantime cargo for the mainland is being transhipped from steamer to lighter on payment of two per cent, duty only. 10. Municipalities .— (i) Palling revenues have prevented the two Munici palities of Manamah and Muharraq from doing anything beyond the usual routine work of town cleaning and small improvements in road widening in the bazaars and elsewhere. (ii) In Muharraq a causeway has been constructed as far as the deep water of the channel between Muharraq and Manamah. The funds were provided from the i thilth ’ by the permission of the executors and the work was super vised by the Muharraq Municipality. 11. Public Works. —Owing to financial stringency no works of any magnitude were carried out. 12. Education. —(?') Six boys schools and two girls schools were in existence on the 1st January. No schools were opened or closed during the year, (ii) On the 1st January six hundred and twenty-three boys and one hundred and ninety girls were on the rolls and on the 31st December, six hundred and twenty-nine boys and one hundred and ninety-eight girls. There were twenty- seven teachers employed throughout the year. ( Hi) Boys who pass out of Government schools are now given School Leaving Certificates and no candidate for a vacancy in the Bahrain Government offices is accepted, unless he has a certificate. Students of other schools are allowed to take the Government school examination on payment of a fee. (iv) The Persian school has recently been enlarged. (v) A school in Manamah started a year ago by a Bahraini Shi’ah is doing well. ' 1 i 1 ! :■ I ; y .1 i . : j! • 1 13. Trade. —(i) It has not yet been possible to summarize the accounts of the Diving Clerks in order to ascertain the value of the catch. From all accounts, however, the catch was poor in quality and quantity and the market was stagnant. Most of the nakhudahs sold their pearls to merchants but the latter were unable to find buyers. (ii) Several leading Pearl Merchants have suggested the advisability of considering the closing of the pearl banks for a season. This would benefit those who hold pearls from past seasons but if adopted would mean that divers54 would be oul of work. The suggestion is, in any case, impracticable unless the whole diving industry in the Gulf co-operated. (Hi) Attempts are being made to introduce Japanese cultured pearls and in one case a salutary punishment was inflicted. In view of the adverse effect that the int roduction of cultured pearls would have on the pearl trade, the Bahrain Government issued a notice laying down severe penalties for those indulging in this nefarious practice and other Rulers of the Arab Littoral have been asked to co-operate in the matter. (iv) The total value of trade amounted to Rs. 15,872,400 as compared with Rs. 10,932,270 in 1932. The total value of imports amounted to Rs. 9,194,300 as against Rs. 10,582,710 and exports to Rs. 6,678,100 as against Rs. 6,399,560 in 1932. (v) Cargo valued at Rs. 2,539,000 was transhipped ad Bahrain for the mainland and other ports as compared with cargo valued at Rs. 2,103,250 tran shipped in 1932. (vi) The figures of exports are not accurate since few of the pearls exported .are declared at their proper value, and those carried by exporters in person are not declared at all. The figures for specie are also unreliable, 14. Industries. — Nil. 15. Athletics. — (i) Interest in football (soccer) continues to increase and there are now seven football clubs in Bahrain. The Bahrain Sports Club, which is the oldest institution of its kind in Bahrain, plays hockey and cricket (and to a lesser degree football) and has two tennis courts. (it) There is one Golf Club in Manamah and another at the Bahrain Petro leum Company, Limited’s camp. 16. Boat Building and Shipping. — (i) The total number of launches plying for hire on the 31st December was fifty-seven as against sixty-two on the'cor- responding date of the previous year, (ii) Four hundred and thirty-six pearling craft were licensed during the year as against four hundred and fifty-eight licensed in 1932. (Hi) Seventeen new sailing vessels were built as compared with sixteen built during 1932. One sailing vessel was converted into a launch and one was £old. (tv) One hundred and forty-two British Ships and ten German Ships entered and cleared the Port of Bahrain during the year under review as com- juued Vifh one hundred and fifty-one British Ships, eleven German Ships and hiee Lorvegian Ships that entered and cleared the Port during the previous year. ° 1 (v) On the 31st December the S.

The salute was taken IDs hiXcellency Sliaikli Hamad bm ’Isa A1 Kalifah. The moral effect of the visit of the Flotilla has been excellent. The Arab population of the Persian (xiilt has noted our strength and information from a number of sources tends o show that the visit of the Flotilla has resulted in British Shipping being treated with more respect and less petty obstruction on the Persian Coast than lias been the case for some time. (iv )His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron Vice-Admiral M. E. Dunbar-Nasmith, V.C., C.B., in H. M. S. “ Hawkins ”, paid Bahrain a visit from the 6th to 10th November. . *1') M- 8 -“ Colombo ” of the Fourth Cruiser Squadron was at Bahrain from the lith to 21st December. 18. Royal Air Force.—(i )Flying Boats of No. 203 (F.B.) Squadron, Koval Air Force, paid frequent visits to Bahrain and Wapiti aeroplanes of No. 84 bquaaron, Koval Air Force, came on a number of occasions. n f Ran SO°n Flying Boat made a forced landing at Ras al Bidyah on the^4th July and a Wapiti aeroplane sank through the surface of the Manamah landing ground on the 25th July and broke a propeller. The machines left without incident m both cases after repairs had been effected. (m) In June the Political Agent returned in a Rangoon Flying Sharjah after a tour of the Trucial Coast in H. M. S. “ Fowev ”. August he again visited Sharjah by Flying Boat. Boat from On the 7th 19. Aviation.—(i) Imperial Airways, Limited, have continued to use the landing ground at Muharraq, as it was found that the Manamah landing ground was too soft for heavy aeroplanes of the Hannibal type. {ii) On the 31st March Imperial Airways’ east bound aeroplane, Hanno made a forced landing at Jubail owing to bad visibility. She was, however 1 rendered assistance by the local people and arrived at Bahrain on the following day. ^ (m) The amount of mails, both to and from Bahrain, carried by air shows a steady increase. M Mr. Maurice Wilson, a British aviator, landed, without permission at Muharraq in his Moth GABJC on the 31st May. As the Trucial Coast is not open to private filers he was not allowed to leave Bahrain until he gave an under taking that he would not proceed to Sharjah. He left to return to Basrah on the following morning, but it was later heard that he had flown direct to Gwadur. In justice to him it should be added that the strength of the wind against him would have prevented his reaching Basrah. . 20. British Interests. —(i) Mr. J. Russell of the Mesopotamia Persia Cor poration, Limited., held charge throughout the year. The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Limited, are also agents in Bahrain for Imperial Airways, Limited. (ii) Mr. D. Ham held charge of the Eastern Bank, Limited, throughout the year. (Hi) Messrs. A. H. T. Chisholm, A. C. Sampson, A. F. Williamson and R. H.

(Hi) The spread of malaria is ascribed to the breeding grounds for mos quitoes^ which have been provided by the overflow from the artesian wells and by the increased amount of water standing about in houses now that the supply Oi water is plentiful. Steps are being taken to combat this development. 2. Hospitals of the American Mission. — (i) Dr. L. P.

(xiii) His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad bin Jabir, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Ruler of Kuwait, arrived on the 20th June and left on the 1st July. (xiv) Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar, Ruler of Sharjah, arrived on the 29th Octo ber and left on the 1st November. 25. Sa’udi Arabia, — (i) Hasa has been further drained of its resources by the imposition of a number of forced loans and taxation has reduced the people to a dreadful state of misery. A number of people have fled to Bahrain, smuggling their women out dressed as men.58 (ii) Muhammad Tawil paid a visit of courtesy to the Political Agent, but no business was discussed. (ni) The events in ’Asir have been watched with interest, hut there seems to he a general feeling that an outbreak of war “ between Arabs ” would be most unfortunate. 26. Qatar.—(i) The Political Agent visited Qatar in H. M. S. “ Fowey ” i n June. The visit was purely of a private nature designed to renew an old friendship and no business was discussed. The opportunity was, however, taken of bringing home to the Shaikh (who had refused the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, permission to use a wireless set) the uses of wireless tele graphy,'by arranging for him to listen to his own message of congratulation to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin Tsa A1 Khalifah on the birth of a grand son being transmitted, and for the reply to be delivered to him two or three hours later. On the next visit of representatives of the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany, Limited, permission was accorded to them to use their wireless. (ii) On the 26th August Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani, Ruler of Qatar, left for Hofuf en route to Riyadh on a summons from His Majesty King Bin Sa’ud. He returned to Dohah on the 27th September. 27. Slavery. —Seventeen slaves were manumitted during the year as com pared with twenty manumitted during 1932. 28. Climate. —(i) The year 1933 was exceptionally cool and high winds blew practically throughout the summer. (ii) On the 1st April a violent, though short, storm with a wind speed of 80 to 85 miles an hour passed over Bahrain causing considerable damage. A number of reed huts were swept a'way and trees uprooted. Part of the wooden roofing of a large verandah of the Hospital was carried away and deposited on the other side of the building. Hail stones measuring about an inch and an half in circumference fell and a slight earthquake was felt. (Hi) The total rainfall for the year amounted to 1.44 inches. 29. General. —A more cheerful feeling prevailed in the Suq than there was in 1932, due to a large extent to the hopes of benefits from oil. The ad ministrative position of the Bahrain Government was stronger, but the financial situation continued to give ground for anxiety, though the prospects of oil development became brighter as the year wore on. G. LOCH, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain.CHAPTER IX. Administration Report of the Kuwait Political Agency for the year 1933. I.— Personnel. (a) Lt.-Colonel H. R. P. Dickson, C.I.E., I.A., held charge of the Political Agency throughout the year. {b) Assistant Surgeon A. L. Greenway, M.R.C.S., L.R.GP. (Lond.), was in medical charge of the Charitable Dispensary and performed the duties of Quarantine officer throughout the year. II.— The Ruling Family. (A) The Ruler, His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir-as-Sabah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., has managed his State during the year under review with more than ordinary ability and success. He has maintained correct and friendly relations with his two powerful neighbours, the Kingdom of Traq and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, lying to the North and South of his territory respectively. (b) The closeness of the trade blockade into Saudi Arabia which during the year under review continued to be controlleri by the notoriously harsh Governor of Hasa, the Amir Abdulla bin Jaloui al Sand, coupled with the partial failure of the 1933 Pearl Season (for the fifth year in succession) has once again brought misery and distress to the Town, and has required much patience and firmness on the part of the Ruler to prevent indignant members of his family from intrigu ing with the trans-border tribes of Bin Saud, especially as the King’s long drawn out dispute with the Imam of Yemen appeared to offer an ideal chance of doing so. In this matter of Bin Sand’s Blocakde, the Ruler has steadfastly adopted a non-irritating policy towards the King, and has continued to place his reliance on the promise given him by His Majesty’s Government during the “ Akhwan ” rebellion of 1929-30, which was to the effect that in return for his (the Shaikh of Kuwait’s) neutrality and co-operation, the British Government would use her best endeavours to bring about the raising of the Blockade. HI.— The Political Agent's relations ivith the Shaikh. The relations between His Majesty’s Political Agent and the Ruler have continued to be of a most cordial and satisfactory nature during the year under review. IV.— Local Interests. (a) Customs. —1. A full report on the imports and exports for the year will be found in the “ Kuwait Trade Report ”, a non-confidential publication. 2. The Director of Customs, Yusuf bin Jassim al Yacub, continues to do satisfactorv work and the Shaikh reposes full confidence in him. In actual practice the Shaikh personallv directs everything connected with the Customs matters in the State and Yusuf bin Jassim is nothing more nor less than a o-lorified Head Clerk, who knows nothing about policy, nor is allowed to meddle fn matters outside the accounts branch, the boarding of steamers, and the land ing of cargoes. q TPe port “ Lighter ” service has been efficient and continues to work on Ike Hues introduced last year whereby no boats go out to steamers until the latter have cast anchor and lowered the “ Haji Daly ”, a black cross (invented bv Maior Dalv of Bahrain) indicating that the ships engines had definitely stonned Caniams of ships have not been slow to praise the new system, and now come right into the inner harbour opposite the Agency thus showing a graceful appreciation of what has been done to meet their wishes m the matter. 4 Customs receipts in 1933 for the first time for some years took a turn for the better. Figures for the year have not been pub ished as yet, but according to the Shaikh hhould show an improvement on 1932 of some Ks. 30,UUU. 11ns is due primarily to improved world conditions, better trade with the hinterland tribes and to a'lesser extent to smuggling with Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Persia an perhaps to slightly improved pearl conditions. His Excellency remarked that for the first time during the last six years, customs receipts had been sufficient to meet the monthly salaries of the many scions of the Shaikhly House of the “ Al Sabah ”. In previous years he had invariably to dip into State60 &lt; reserves ’ to find necessary funds, in other words he has had to spend out of capital to keep the 200 or so odd members of the ruling family (male and female) in pocket money. 5. The import tax on goods entering Kuwait has remained at 4 per cent. ad valorem, which as in the case of Bahrain and Debai tends to attract trade away from Saudi ports, Persia and ’Iraq. As was the case last year a further surtax of 4 per cent, ad valorem is also taken, which is handed over to the Town Municipality, in place of the old House tax, which was found difficult of collection and irksome to the majority of the inhabitants. This surtax was started 3 years ago at the suggestion of certain prominent merchants, and bears easily on everyone. Goods exported or imported by British subjects are exempt from this tax. (b) Municipality. —1. The general improvement and high standard of cleanliness and sanitation which the Municipal authorities set themselves to bring about three years ago, has been maintained in remarkable fashion during 1933. Kuwait to-day is believed to be the cleanest Town in the whole of the Persian Gulf, and is well ahead of Basra and Mohammerah in this respect. It certainly is the healthiest of all towns between Karachi and Baghdad for the simple reason that there are no mosquitoes or sand flies, the soil is sandy and wells and cisterns—the harbourers of malaria—are conspicuous by their absence. 2. The able and energetic Municipal Secretary Sulaiman al Adsani, brother to the City Qadhi or Judge, was re-elected at the 1933 elections and continues to do most excellent and fruitful work. He retains the full confidence of the Shaikh, than whom no more keen person exists, where the health and welfare of his subjects are concerned. 3. The electrification of Kuwait town foreshadowed in this Agency’s last Administration Report as certain for the Autumn of 1933, materialised on the 1st of Bamadhan (18th December 1933). A fine engine house has been erected on the sea front, and two first class English engines have been installed, which for the moment, perform all the work that is necessary. Two other engines are on order, and some 1,000 lights have been installed in the Town since the Power House started work. By the end of 1933, electric cables were carried along the whole 3 mile limit front of the Town and now extend past the New Agency as far as the Shaikh’s Palace at Dasman. With the completion of the New Agency building steps will shortly be taken to obtain the Govermnent of India’s approval to power being taken from the Town electric plant. ^ ^ a ^ ure electrification of the Town is the fact that it is not managed by the Town Municipality, but by a Company of ‘ Iraqi cu 7 n Kuwait capitalists. 11ns makes for efficiency and cheapness. The cost per ‘ unit ’ has been fixed at 6 annas, which compared with other towns is fair. 4. In the affairs of the Municipality the Political Agent confines himself o propaganda and advice only. He does not interfere, and results achieved in he last 4 years are most satisfactory. The chief credit for this highly satisfac tory state of affairs must be given to His Excellency the Shaikh, to the Municipal k.ecietary and, last but not least, to the Agency Medical Officer, who has been tireless m his efforts to preach cleanliness-and sanitation. The most satisfac- ory arM indeed most significant feature of the whole thing is that the active ( ananc toi every improvement carried through, has come from the people them- sc ves. icy aie proud cf their Town and have caught the spirit of progress m right earnest. 1 r o. ivuwait stid remains ‘ dry nor will the Ruler tolerate for one morn* any such western ideas as “ Cinemas ’ r or “ Theatres ”, which have done SnI'flC 0 ! dem 1 0laiS0 ci y tain . post-war Arab States in the Middle East.

As foreshadowed in this Agency Administration Report for 1932 His Excellency the Shaikh generously built a small shed (not rest house) oA the aerodrome free of charge, for passengers to use as a shelter from sun, wind and ram. The shed was completed in November 1933. nr • 6 \ I ! 1 Novemher 1933, His Excellency the Ruler officially requested His Majesty s Government to make it known that he did not wish “private” aviators to land in or fly over his State, or over his territorial waters. (. At the close of the year and after a certain amount of unavoidable delay, His Excellency the Shaikh approved of all the clauses of the new “ Agreement fur the regulation and control of civil aircraft ”, which His Majesty’s Govern ment had been negotiating with the Kuwait Government. The Agreement now only awaits official ratification. 8. There remains the question of the air agreement for His Majesty’s Royal Air Force. This has yet to be presented, but the writer has little doubt that the Shaikh will raise any serious objection to any of its clauses, in view of his well- known desire to, at all times, assist, where British Naval, Military and Air Force requirements are concerned. He only stipulates that his sovereign rights are in no way impaired or threatened. 9. The re-marking and enlarging of the local aerodrome were satisfactorily carried out in June by Captain Hudson, R.E. of the Royal Air Force (Works Section), Baghdad. (d) Boat Budding. —1. A note on the number, tonnage, etc., of boats built during the year has been given in the year’s trade report and can be referred to if necessary. 2. The following types of boats were all built during the year under review :— Bum, , Sambuq, Shu ’wai, Bagala, Jalboat, Mashua. 3. No ‘ Batils ’ were laid down. 4. Speaking generally the boat building industry was stagnant during 1933. This being due to the continued depressed pearl trade. 5. Out of approximately 700 pearl boats for instance, only 300 put to sea. The remainder being laid up and kept in repair only. 6 As mentioned in this Agency Administration Report for 1932, His Excellency the Shaikh, to assist the boat building trade, built a new yacht for himself some 100' overall. His Excellency also had^ a 3-pounder B. L. naval gun mounted on the bow, which with a powerful searchlight presented by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, Limited, added to the graceful and efficient appearance of the boat. She was launched on 11th April with appropriate ceremony. The modern 75 H P Tliornycroft Internal Combustion Engine, which had been fitted to his first yaclit was taken out and placed in the new craft, and the old yacht very cleverlv converted into a trading sea-going dhow. (e) Pearl Season,—1. The staple industry of Kuwait, like Bahrain is the nenrl fishiim industry. Some 10,000 men with their families are dependent for tlieir lining on ihe annual dive, known locally as the Ghaus. 2. As mentioned above, if the pearl season is poor, it follows^that the boat building, and sail making industry, also the manufacture of shark s oil, etc., aiu all sympathetically affected. , Tllp snme applies to a dozen other industries such as rope making, copper nail manufXe'Ld the import of wood, spars, etc., etc.62 4 The year 1933 as a matter of fact tamed out to be slightly better than thoS g' of 1 929 ; 1930, 1931 and 1932, and the catch was all sold with the exception of the high grade and expensive pearls. 5 The actual merchants who are still suffering most from the depression are those who five years ago and previously sunk capital in the purchase of pearls when the market was good and pearls fetched high prices. They have been unable to sell these since, not even at a reasonable loss, so are still saddled with heavy stocks. Chief among these is Han Shamlan once one of the most wealthy and rich of the local “ Towashes ” (pearl buyers from the fishing fleet). 6 The pearling fleet put to sea at the end of May, the occasion is known as . llo T-fokln The •&lt; Gaffal ”, or homecoming of the divers was fixed for tne 27 th If September, when as’usual His Excellency the Sha.kh proceeded t. the Banks and gave the signal for their return. An interesting feature of the 1933 season was the surprisingly even distribution of the pearls found by the various boats, unlike 1932 when only a few prominent boats got all the luck. •7. The best pearl of the season was sold by Ibn Musa’ad al Badr for Rs. 20,000. This in normal years would have fetched at least Rs. 40,000. 8 nsnal ‘ scurvv ’ made its appearance among the divers, and caused considerable suffering and some loss of life but, it will be long before one will be able to convince the captains and crews of pearling dhows of the advantage of taking necessary precautions. Nor does the Ruler appear to recognise the wastage of man power which results from the dread disease. This probably is due to the small value which the Arab places on human lite. (f) New Agency B'uilding. —1. ork was started on the building in August 1932 b Y the Indian Public Works Department. The Assistant Engineer to the Honourable the Political Resident at Bushire was in general charge, while Mr. Abdul Wahab of the same Department supervised the work on the spot. 2. December 1933 saw the second story nearly completed and it is estimated that the August 1934 will see the house finished and ready to be taken over by the Political Agent. j 3. Up to date some Rs. 40,000 has gonemnto Kuwait Town by way of work men’s wages, which was what the Political Agent hoped would happen, and this has greatly assisted in keeping down unemployment and distress. 4. Very good work indeed has been put into the maspnry portion of the building by Mr. Abdul Wahab and bis staff, who are to be congratulated accordingly. (g) Poverty in the Town and among the Nomad population. —1. This has once again been a feature of the Town’s life during 1933, and may be attributed to the continued “ Blockade ” by Ibn Sand, the depressed pearl trade, and general world conditions. 2. His Excellency the Shaikh continued to give the “ down and out ”, one square meal a day outside his Town Palace. These numbering some 80 souls daily were fed from a sort of soup kitchen, which was erected close by. 3. Fortunately the better class Arab of Kuwait is a deeply religious man, and especially on Fridays is liberal in the charity which he disburses. 4. The writer computes that some 10,000 souls in the Town of Kuwait have always to live on the equivalent of 1 rupee a day each, while at least half of the Bedouin population are lucky if they can get a small bowl of camel’s milk as their daily ration. 5. In spite of the above rather harrowing details, the people as a whole are happy, well covered, and content with their lot, and the cost of living 18 remarkably low. For instance Id. will purchase 4 flat loaves of bread, each a foot across and thick, while Japan supplies the wherewithal to clothe a man at prices which leave one aghast. (h) Locusts. — During the year under review, Kuwait and North-East Arabia was spared all visitations of this pest. This bore out exactly the prophesy made by Mr. Uvarov, Locust Expert and Adviser to the British Museum, who visited Kuwait on 23rd May 1932 and said that the Principality would be tree from visitations during 1932, 1933 and probably 1934. (i) B. A. F. survey of Kuwait and the Kuwait Neutral Zone. —1. Ti ie Air Force survey of the Principality which was commenced in the Autumn oi63 1932 under the guidance of Major Papworth, E.E. (attached to E. A. F Head quarters Iraq Command) and which continued into 1933, till the advent of the NovemherWSS™ W ° ^ discontinued - ^as once again resumed on 2nd i • n M h6 ' n rk Sti1 !, tr l - be ?? t throu g h was a portion of the Neutral Zone, A 1 ? 1 , i aj r f Papworth himself took in hand and a strip along the North side of the bay of Kuwait, which devolved on his assistant. 3. Both parties conipleted their work on 17th and 19th November respec tively and returned to Baghdad. 4. Majoi Papworth was supplied with the usual guards and guides bv His Excellency the bhaikh, including hawkers with birds to provide the party with fresh game. 5. Major Papworth as on the previous occasion, when he visited Kuwait, made himself popular with everyone he came in contact with, and generally received high praise from the Shaikh for his tact and fair dealings with the Arab. His final departure from Kuwait was genuinely regretted by the Euler, the writer and every Bedouin he came in contact with. The same may be said of the remainder of the survey staff. 6. The writer made several visits to Major Papworth’s various camps, and was able to render some assistance in the Neutral Zone, when Ibn Shajaan, one of Bin Sand’s frontier Commanders, considered it his duty to send an armed party and which planted itself rather gratuitously on Major Papworth’s head. (j) ffaj .—The 1933 trans-desert Haj from Kuwait was a fairly successful affair as regards number : some 500 persons made the pilgrimage including the ladies of several prominent families who did the journey by car ( via Eiath). (k) Deaths. —1. Shaikh Sand bin Mohamedal Sabab, cousin of the Euler died very suddenly of heart failure on the morning of the 23rd January 1933. The Political Agent sent the usual letter of condolences to the Shaikh and to other members of the family. 2. Shaikh Salman al Hamud, second cousin of the Euler died on 15th November 1933 from some internal complaint (not diagnosed). He was a promi nent and distinguished member of Kuwait society, and his demise cast a gloom over the whole town. As he died in the Maude Hospital, Basra, where he had been taken in anticipation of an operation, the funeral and internment took place at Zubair in ’Iraq. (1) Mnrriages .—Shaikh Mohamed son of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Sabah, the Ituler, was married to the daughter of the late Saiyid Talib Pasha al Naqib of Basra on 10th August 1933, and for several days there was a round of entertainment in the shape of dinner parties and ceremonial visits. Saiyid Hamid Beg al Naqib, Member of the ’Iraq Parliament and brother of the bride’s father, and also the mother of the bride attended the ceremony from Basra, in company with many other persons of note. (m) The King-Emperor’s Birthday—1. His Majesty the King-Emperor’s Birthday was celebrated in Kuwait on 3rd June with great enthusiasm. 2. As is his usual custom, His Excellency the Shaikh declared a ^public holiday and according to old tradition both the Union Jack and the Kuwait Standard were flown side by side on the Agency Flagstaff as well as on the Shaikh’s flagstaff. Both flagstaffs were also fully dressed. 3. All ships in harbour hoisted flags by order of the Shaikh, and generally the town took on a festive appearance. 4 In the evening the Political Agent gave a dinner which was attended by the Euler, prominent members of his family and the European community as well as the Agency Staff. (*) Complimentary Visits.-l. On 18th June, His Bxcellencv the Shaikh accompanied bv his cousin and 3 of the principal local ‘ pillars of State visited Bahrain on a private visit to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin Isa al Khalifa, 1 S I. o On 10th December His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin Isa al Khalifa, 'I s i paid a return visit to Kuwait and was given a most enthusiastic welcome 5v the Euler and all his people. The usual round of entertainments niter- ■persed with hawking expeditions into the Desert were the teatuie ot tne ’estivities. Lcl29FD64 V —Condition of the Country. (Law and Order.) ( ^ TnL has been all that could he desired and the change that has come over the State as compared with 1929 and the years previous, is little short of ^^^Law, order, and security have reigned everywhere within the Kuwait marches, throughout 1933. . (r) As recorded a year ago the reasons for this satisfactory state of affairs may be summarised shortly as below : 1 The advent of the motor car, which enables the most inaccessible corners of the State to be visited by the Shaikh’s armed Ford cars, on the first sign of trouble. 2 The onenino- up of the Arabian Coast as an Air route by Imperial Air- wavs and the bi-weeklv flight of their big air liners, which pass over Kuwait till the Neutral Zone is reached and generally impress all and sundry. 3 The frequent flights of R. A. F. machines over the Principality and down the coast to Bahrain. 4 The stern and tight control maintained by Bin Sand over the Nejd ' border tribes, and the svmpathy generally which the latter feel for Kuwait as a result of the King’s ‘ blockade ’, which has resulted in a wide and tacit arrangement among the bedoum to do nothing to hurt the people of Kuwait and their small tribal community. 5 The manv car visits of the Shaikh to every corner of the State in the process of “ hawking ” the Hubara or bustard. This goes on throughout the cold season. 6. The frequent tours made by the Political Agent into the interior whew ’ he visits the camps of the bedouins and generally shows himseli This breeds a spirit of confidence and a growing belief that His Majesty’s Representative keeps his eyes and ears open and would not be moving about in the hinterland and among the Bedouin unless by order of the Protecting Power. 7. The fact that “ Akhwanism ’* or the fanatical Wahabi spirit which Avas a feature among the Bedouin prior to 1930, has now disappeared, especially among the northern tribes of Nejd more particularly among the Mutair, Ajman and Awazim. The latter tribes to-uay more than ever, look to Kuwait with affection and regard and count the time not far distant when they will once again be able freely to visit Kuwait and buy supplies. This fact perhaps more than any other, has had a stablizing effect in the desert and acts as a wholesome deterrent to anyone minded to start a course ot raiding', etc. (d) There were no Bedouin incidents such as raids, etc., during the year, and Bin Sand’s frontier officers allowed none of their patrols to cross e border. , t ^ (e) In the Town of Kuwait one case only of house breaking with violence occurred in the 12 months under review, a remarkable record when £ ne c( ! to think of it. The culprits in the case, 3 ’Iraqis, were caught after a shoi c and summarily dealt with. VI .— Relations with Saudi Arabia and Blockade. (a) The personal relations between Kuwait and Bin Sand have been out warclly perfectly friendly and good throughout 1933. This in spite o ^ continued blockade and the apparently unchanged intention of the K 111 ^ bend Kuwait to his will, by continuing to prevent :—r 1. All caravan communication with the interior of Saudi Arabia. 2. As well as by the strict banning of Kuwait to all his own tribesmen. (b) Outwardly Bin Sand’s declared policy has been and apparently stilly to endeavour to deflect the trade, that would normally pass through Kuwa Qassim in Nejd, and to the great tribes of North-East Arabia, to his own ports of Qatif, flu bail and Ojair. Actually to those who know the ^ vm ^’ • „ii v is little doubt, I think, that his real intentions to starve Kuwait economicuntil she is forced to come to terms, which means being incorporated in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as a vassal State. (c) In the meantime from his point ot view the King is killing two birds with one stone, hoi apart fiom continuing the slow process of starvin°' Kuwait, he is successfully preventing the Ajman, Mutair and Awazin tribes from having any but secret intercourse with their mother city. {d) Actually Bin Sand’s troubles in Asir and the movement to the Yemen border of almost the whole fighting strength of his State, have caused a certain amount of slackening off in the blockade to become evident. The tribes recognise that Bin Sand’s hands are full and that his whole mind and attention is fixed on how to settle his differences with the astute Imam Yahya. They have become bolder in consequence and more and more of his tribesmen have been coming up to Kuwait and getting back safely again with contraband. (e) In spite of heroic efforts on the part of Hamud al Bagaawi (the butcher) Bin Sand’s blockade Officer on the frontier, there has been a definite deteriora tion in the measures of the King to keep trade from flowing from Kuwait. (/) A new factor and one which may have far reaching reactions (if not seen and checked by the King) has recently made itself apparent. In the past, Bin Jiluwi, the Governor of Hasa, used to seize a large amount of the customs and revenues of Hasa and divert it to his own personal use. Hence he was one of the chief personages to benefit by the diverting of the trade of Kuwait through Bahrain. Tp assist in this he has for years employed the House of Qusaibi to propagand for him in Bahrain, and took full advantage of the fact that the Bahrain Government were equally anxious to see Kuwait trade come through their ports. Since, however, the King send Mohamed al Tawil to act as his Revenue and Customs Director in Hasa the latter has prevented Ibn Jiloui from “ looting the till ”, so to speak, and the latter dissatisfied and angry is, it is said, doing all he can to ruin Al Tawil with his master, and has even gone as far (so the rumour says) as to secretly order Al Bagaawi to ease off certain blockade measures, so as to get more trade back to Kuwait and cause the customs receipts of Bin Sand’s ports to show a falling off. This of course is all to the good (if true). On the 15th June the Shaikh received a letter from Bin Saud in which he was asked to raise his “ Customs ” to the figures (70 per cent, to 100 per cent. udi valorem) in force at the King’s ports of Qatif, Jubail and Ojair, Bin Saud for his part promising to remove all blockade restrictions in the interior. The King ignored the fact that the very existence of Kuwait depends almost uitirely on her transit trade with the interior. (a) The Shaikh while politely refusing to consider the King’s suggestions, eplied offerhiff to accept the “ manifest ” system with “ Customs Posts ” along he frontier, where manifests would be presented and checked In other words he system which the King himself proposed for Kuwait In 1930. (7i) The King never replied to this counter offer. VII .—Relations with ’Iraq. („\ a,, have been outwardly cordial and officially correct throughout 33 end would continue to be so, were it not for the unfortunate underground nsi’on existing between the two States, which differs little from that existing tween Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. This tension was further increased by the following incidents which took ace during the y r ear :— U )The Shaikh’s rights to his Bashiyah and Faddaghiyah Estates were K contested bv claimants who were considered by the Shaikh to have been instigated by the ’Iraq Government. A demand on the part of the ’Iraq Government that the Shaikh’s date gardens at Fao hitherto exempt should pay taxes and export duty including produce intended for his own household use. 1 hese taxes and duty were actually taken fiom the Shaikh. The ’Iran Government put obstacles in the way of, and levied fees X1 u„on Kuwait water boats which bring drinking water for the Town Prom tbe Sbatt al Arab. 0&gt;)66 (d) Kitting 1 and sabotage carried out by the labourers on the Shaikh’s date wardens at Fao. r t he Shaikh declared that these disturbances were Instigated by the Mutasarrif of Basra under the orders of the ’Iraq Government. (e) Several cases of attacks by Iraq armed launches on Kuwait sailing craft alleged to be smuggling goods into Iraq. (f) Demand by the Iraq Government that the Shaikh should take active W measures to put a stop to the smuggling into Iraq territory from Kuwait. The chief of these measures were 1 Tim acceptance of an ’Iraqi customs official in Kuwait to watch their interests. 2. The maintaining of patrols and guards on the Kuwait side of the frontier to control land smuggling. The Shaikh politely declared his inability to adopt Iraq’s suggestion for financial and other reasons and suggested that an Iraq customs officii should visit Kuwait to confer with him. This, in turn, was declined by the Iraq Govern ment. In the Autumn of 1933 an attempt was made by His Majesty’s Ambassador in Baghdad for a conference to be held in Baghdad between Iraq customs officials and the Shaikh’s Customs Director, assisted by the Political Agent and the Honourable the Political Resident. This again fell through due to the feeling felt bv the Shaikh that the “ dice would be too heavily loaded ” against him in any conference held at Baghdad. He countered by asking for the conference to be held in Kuwait where he would himself conduct Kuwait’s case, he offered also to tighten up very considerably the question of sea smuggling (by means of receipted Way Bills, etc.). Cases occurred of attacks on Kuwait sailing vessels by Iraq launches. In the matter of smuggling, Iraq, by the imposition of her high tariffs, has only herself to blame, If trade is diverted to Kuwait, and Is smuggled across her borders. The one thing that is certain is that the remedy lies in her hands entirely. She could, for instance, try one or more of the following measures (1) Reduce her high customs tariffs. (2) Employ her own Bedouin to assist in stopping smuggling as Bin Sand does. (3) Place customs posts along her frontier. There are none for 100 miles or more. (4) Patrol her borders with armed cars. (5) Forbid Iraq merchants to import cargoes marked u Basrah option Kuwait ”. (6) Forbid the export to Kuwait of “ bonded ” cigarettes and tobacco, which the exporters bring back into Iraq, with the assistance of Iraq tribesmen in their pay. VIII.— Relations with Persia. 1. General. —These have not changed. Persia does not recognise Kuwait, and Kuwait reciprocates by having as little to do with her neighbour as possible. 2. Passports. — (a) The Passport question still makes it impossible for a Kuwait merchant, anxious to do trade, to enter Mohammerah or other Persian port, and the only trade that exists between the two countries, is that carried on by villagers from the Persian side of the Shaft al Arab and the Marmashir estuary of the Karun, who come in small boats to sell vegetables, fruit, “ bhoosa ”, barley and other eatables, and return with petty cargoes of contra band. Such people never possess papers or passports of any kind and the Kuwait Government does not worry them for any out of policy. (b) A certain number of larger dhows (“ Bums ”) also come over froni ib e coast south of Bushire and bring carpets, Abba cloth, nuts, spices, etc. These also take back rice, tea, sugar and coffee in return. None of them possess pass' ports or papers, for the simple reason that the Persian Government would refuse to give permits to such persons to visit Kuwait. (&lt;G The Persian Government’s attitude to the Passnort question therefor® makes it quite impossible for Kuwaitis to trade legitimately with Persia at ai*For instance a Kuwait subject going direct to Mohammerah, Bushire or Bandar Abbas has his Kuwait certificate of identity torn up by the local Persian autho rities and is fined, on the excuse that he should have taken out a Persian passport, Kuwait being a Province of Persia in the minds of local coastal officials, what- e^ei the reisian Government may say officially to His Majesty’s Minister in ffehran. Similarly any Persian arriving with an Ilm-o-khabar, or yellow piece of paper permitting the traveller to proceed from one Persian port to another has it confiscated on his arrival. (d) During the summer of 1933 the Ilm-o-khabar system was reported to have been abolished, certainly Persians who arrived in Kuwait began to come armed with proper passports ; but as these were all marked India via Kuwait and Oman, or Iraq via Kuwait and Oman, the Political Agent, acting under orders, charged the holders 10 gold francs (approximately Bs. 7) on their landing. 3. Persian Navy. — {a) Persian Sloops in the Gulf have been very active in their efforts to stop contraband going over to the Arab Coast during 1933. Unfortunately the zeal of the officers of this newly re-constituted Navy has been far outrunning their discretion. A number of Kuwait craft were seized, in some cases on the High Seas, and taken into Persian ports for investigation. The cases have formed the subject of vigorous protest by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran but hitherto with little result. IX.— Oil Interests. (a) The “ Oil ” fight between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and fhe Eastern and General Syndicate, representing American interests, who throughout 1932, each sought to get a concession from the Shaikh, continued vigorously throughout 1938. (b) The Shaikh in spite of tempting offers from the Americans and Sir John Cadman himself, who visited Kuwait on 25th March 1933, refused finally to give tlie concession to either party, and (c) on 15th May 1933 the Shaikh informed the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that he had decided to postpone all negotiations with either party sine die. {d) By the end of the 1933, it became known that the Eastern and General Svndicate had withdrawn from the field and that the Mellon Oil group of the IT. S. A. and the A. P. 0. C. had come to an agreement on a 50|50 basis, and were about to form a single company to be known as the Kuwait Oil Company. It was hoped that the representatives of the new concern would come out to Kuwait in the new year and put fresh proposals forward to the Shaikh. Note.—This they did in February 1934, and the Shaikh is now considering their combined offer. X.— Post and Telegraphs. {a) The Post and Telegraph service in Kuwait continued to be managed by the Iraq Government throughout 1933. (See Administration Report for 1932.) (h) The protracted negotiations which His Majesty’s Government have had with the Iraq Government on the subject of the future of the Post and Telegraphs are at the time of writing still unfinished. (c) It is hoped that 1934 will see something satisfactory to both Governments emerge from the “ fog which at present seems to have settled down on this unsatisfactory business. (d) Without doubt, Iraq intends to strain every nerve to keep her P° s t an TowJrdi i.ma ^ Kuwait partly for political reasons, while the view pond ot Pie Shaikh is that Iraq should only be allowed to stay in Kuwait on condition that ., 1. She gives a document admitting the independence of Kuwait. 2. She pavs Kuwait a percentage of her takings. 3. She agrees to a formal agreement limiting her stay in Kuwait to 20 years. , , The above are really the major points at issue, other minor details and demanc s pf the Shaikh, can, it is hoped, be overcome. . . n . t , t fel The demands of the Shaikh have all been communicated to the Iraq Government, hut by the end of the year she has kept her reply m abeyance.XI.—Political Agent’s Tours. Durine: the vea^ under review the Political Agent has made numerous tours hv car in the State and visited the more important points on the Kuwait-Saudi, the Kuwait-Traq frontiers and the Kuwait Neutral Zone. The object of these tours has been to maintain touch with the tribes and desert affairs generally. XII—Agency Charitable Dispensary. (a) There were a total of 10,115 attendances at the Dispensary during the year, made up as follows :— Adults. Males .. • • • • * • • * 3 ’ 245 Females ••• • • •' ' * 2,760 Children.

Ninety-eight British, 2 German, 1 Norwegian and 1 Japanese* steamers visited the Port of Kuwait during 1933, the first that has ever visited the port of Kuwait. XVII.— Meteorological. {a) The rainy season which ended in April 1933 was one of the best seen in Kuwait for some years. A total of 4.99', and as a result an excellent hay crop grew all over the Desert to a distance of 250 miles all round. This crop dried as the Summer arrived, and provided good fodder for the Bedouins’ camels throughout the Summer months. Both Winter and Summer was a year of plenty with the result that meat, ghi, sour milk and camels were cheap and plentiful. {1) The Autumn of 1933, when new rains should have fallen, was not so satisfactory, and up to the end of the year nothing worth speaking of had fallen. If the Spring does not bring a change the year 1934 promises to be bad, and the danger to livestock real. The maximum recorded temperature during 1933 was 116 F. The minimum recorded temperature during 1933 was 30 F. H. R. P. DICKSON, Lt.-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait. k&lt;2l 20FD—46—2J-34—GlfSCONFIDENTIAL.

OF 1935, dated THE Hth July 1935. , J. ^ve the honour to forward herewith the Annual Administration Report- of this Residency for the year 1934. ~ V * v r1 REVIEW. Arab Side. Royal Navy. The Sloops of the Persian Gulf Division continued their excellent patrol work on the Arab Coast. They were frequently called upon to assist the Political Resident and Political Officers under him m making: their tours. ' Aviation—The Flying Boats of the Royal Air Force did much useful work in connection with the establishment of the Air Route. Some flights of land machines were also made. By the courtesy of the Roval Air Force Political Officers were enabled to make tours from time to time in Royal Air Force machines which proved a considerable convenience. An Air Agreement was negotiated with the Rulers of Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat and air facilities were obtained at Dibai. Imperial Aairways continued their weekly service—East and West— throughout the year. Kuwait remains as a port of call provided conditions permit. For various reasons the Arabian Air Route is still closed to private aviators. Oil Interests —The, Kuwait Oil Company formed at the end of 1934, by the amalgamation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited, and the Gulf Oil Company of America opened negotiations with the Shaikh of Kuwait for a concession which was finally signed in Kuwait on the 23rd December 1934. The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited continued to exploit their con cession actively. During the year several new wells were sunk and at its con clusion the total personnel of the Company was as follows i— Americans .. • • • * 24 British .. 15 British Indians .. 43 Bahrainis ... .. ., .. 348 Others .. ,. 149 construction of the tanks on Sitra Island and the laying of a sub- marine pipe-line from there to the deep sea moorings which are three miles from the shore, were completed during the year. In June the first shipment of approximately 3,300 tons of crude oil was made to Japan. Various points in connection with the Company’s Mining Lease from the Shaikh which had been the subject of negotiations between His Majesty’s Government on behalf of the Shaikh and the Company were concluded by the end of the year, and on the 29th December the Mining Lease was signed. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited continued their negotiations with the Shaikh of Qatar for a concession in his territory and the Political Resident paid various visits to that place to interview the Shaikh. By the end of the year there were some prospects of success. Kuwait .—Nothing further of a definite nature towards the solution of the difficult problem of the Shaikh of Kuwait’s date gardens in Iraq was accom plished during the year. Pearling, the staple industry of Kuwait was a failure in 1934, due partly to an indifferent catch and partly owing to a bad market. Strenuous efforts were made by His Majesty’s Government, without suc cess to assist Kuwait and Iraq to come to some agreement on the question of Kuwait-Iraq Smuggling in the direction of combined co-operation between the two States. Under arrangements made by His Excellency The Ambassador at Baghdad and bv the Political Resident Iraqi delegates visited Kuwait m September for informal discussions with the Shaikh, but nothing concrete resulted. Further incidents occurred of Iraqi Customs officials m an illegal and high-handed manner invading the territory and tern orial waters &lt;&gt; Kuwait, and of their shooting and assaulting Kuwaiti subjects In spite oi representations made by His Majesty’s Government on behalf of the Shaikh to the Iraqi Government, no reparations have been forthcoming from the latter, their reply bein-' that either such incidents did not take place as reported oroccurred in Iraqi waters. As an important factor m tins problem it must be remembered that while Kuwaits are amongst those who actually smuggle goods bv sea into Iraqi territory from Kuwait, on land, where the contraband trade is by far the greater it is the Iraqi tribesmen themselves who are the carriers- Kuwait being merely the market where they purchase their goods. Jim Baud’s blockade of exports from Kuwait into Saudi Arabia was en forced with the same vigour as previously and continued to cause considerable loss to the inhabitants of that small Principality, who are almost entirely de pendent on the transit trade for their existence. Bahrain. The pearl industry of Bahrain has been a failure due partly to ™ nm;f&lt; 7 &gt;rfvnt patch and nartlv owing to a very dull market. Muscat —No events of outstanding importance took place in the State durum the year under review. The outstanding Muscat problem being that of finance, it is satisfactory to be able to report that the financial condition of the State has considerably 'improved. A few years ago the State was almost on the verge of bankruptcy but by rigid economies the State is now making for prosperity. At the end of the year under review there was a satisfactory credit balance, and it is hoped that some of the social services which had to be cut down to make ends meet will now be resumed. Tracial Coast .—In October an attempt was made on the life of Shaikh Said bin Maktum, Ruler of Dibai, by certain of his cousins, who conspired to depose him. Since there was a possibility of local disturbances by which British lives and property might be endangered H. M. S. “ Lupin” proceeded to that port. Shaikh Said was informed by the Resident that he was at liberty to deal with his cousins as he thought fit, but reminded that proper precautions should be taken to safeguard British lives and property. A Notice by the Resident was also published in the Town that if such lives and property were endangered, those responsible for the disturbances would be held to account. A flight of the Royal Air Force demonstrated over the Town. The Political Agent, Bahrain subsequently proceeded to Dibai, where, after some negotiations, the unruly cousins submitted to the Ruler. A satisfactory feature was that the settlement was arrived at by the Ruler himself with moral support from us, which in consistence with our long established policv on the Trucial Coast did not involve interference in the internal affairs of Dibai. Imperial Airways’ aeroplanes continued to use Sharjah Air Port without incident. Despite a fairly good catch the pearl trade suffered from the general depression in the pearl market. Towards the close of the year negotiations were commenced at Jedda he tweed His Majesty’s Minister and the Saudi Arab Government which included the question of the delimitation of the frontier between Saudi Arabia and the Trucial States and Muscat. Peusian Side. Phe security of the Persian coastal region as far as Bandar Abbas was good. Persian Mekran and Bashakard were however the scene of some dis- tuibailees throughout the year and the Persian Government were unsuccessful in imposing complete law and order in their districts. A certain number of tlie inhabitants oi thes'e areas with their families continued to migrate to the Trucial Coast and Gwadur. nasidu and^ Henjam .—Various small incidents occurred during the i ° ( &gt; n Bn I lsh Sloops and the local Persian authorities owing to th&lt; latter s policy of pinpricks and obstructiveness. Persian Navy.-—The Persian Navy occupied itself with its chief duty of pre \enimg smuggling by sea and made a number of captures of sailing craf ai egec o be engaged in that occupation. In a few cases, however, the zeal o '^“^^ers appeared to have overcome their discretion and Arab vessel p - 1 eiec the High Seas were interfered with, some being taken t eini ' 11 - I ^ 01 1 . S * or J nves tigation. At the conclusion of the year these cases wer Mill under discussion with the Persian Government. ibo ^ J( i C r°\ ^ ers ^ an Officials .—Relations with the Governor o cohlnued to brmoVcoldf a I mad AU MirZa R ° kni ’ aS with his P redeeeSS ° n T.

Since M. Cassin’s departure French interests remain unrepresented up to the end of the year. Dutch Consulate— Monsieur George Cassin, French Consul, Bushire, was in charge of the Consulate from the 1st January to the 31st July. The Dutch interests also remained unrepresented for the remainder of the year. His Majesty's Consul-General, Bushire, continued to look after the Nor wegian, Greek, Iraq and Esthonian interests. U. S. S. R. —A Russian Armenian Clerk remained in charge of the Russian Trading Concern, which apparently did no business throughout the year. B.—V ISITORS. Mr. V. A.

On the 22nd May the Russian Consul, Ahwaz, G. Tsadouroff arrived here and returned to his headquarters on the 24th. On the 5th October,. Mr. Pierre Tchougounoff, Russian Consul-General, Shiraz, arrived at Bushire and left on the 7th. C.— British Interests.

Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Co. — Mr. J. Moir, a Director and Manager in Iran of this fiiiii. passed tlnough Bushire on the 8th October cm route for the United Kingdom na\ mg closed dowm the last of the Company’s Branches at Isfahan. The Imperial Bank of Persia, Bushire. —Air. H. Evans was Manager of the Bushire Branch from the beginning of the year to the 6th April when he was relieved by Mr. W. I. R.

Governor of the Gulf Ports .—His Excellency Muhammad Ali Mirza Rokni continued as Governor throughout the year. Assistant Governor, Bushire .—Abdul Shakoor Amin continued as Assistant Governor and Honorary President of the Municipality throughout the period under review. Customs Administration the 13th May, M. Le Fontaine, Provincial Director, Sou them Customs and M. Vandenrydt, Special Inspector, Southern Customs, handed over charge of their duties to two of their subordinates and left Bushire for Iraq ew route for Europe on the termination of their services by the Iranian Government. On the 13th May, Muhammad Vali Mirza Nouban arrived here and took Charge of the Customs Department in which position he remained until the end of the year. Customs Preventive Department .—During the year a good deal less zeal in carrying out their duties was shown by the members of this Department than during the preceding 12 months. In February a Committee of Inspectors arrived here from Tehran and arrested 28 persons suspected of being concerned in smuggling activities. After investigations lr5 were discharged and the remainder placed in the military prison where they still were at the end of the year. At the same time a Cir cular was issued to all Local Government Departments warning officials that the &lt;dea f h penalty would be inflicted on any of them found guilty of abetting smugglers. These measures, however, failed to produce any effect and contra band traffic along the sparsely populated coast between Bushire and Lingah steadily increased in volume. Emboldened by success a party of Tangistanis in June attempted in broad daylight to smuggle a quantity of sugar into a spot within a few miles of Bushire. They w^ere intercepted by Road Guards and an encourage took place during which the Tangistanis made good their escape. The total of captures made by the Preventive Department during the year amounted to some B90 packages of sugar, tea, piece-goods and sundries, o dhows and 16 rifles. Inspection of Government Departments.—In February a Commission of Insoection consisting of 7 officials arrived here from Tehran. They posted a printed notice in the Town to the effect that complaints received against any local officials would be investigated. Many letters were sent in but as they were all anonymous no action 'was taken. The Commission visited Tangistall where they arrested 15 persons compris ing smugglers, Customs officials and Road Guards, who had been reported to have been conniving’ at the evasion of the law. A numbei weie found guil y and sentenced to various terms oi imprisonment. As a result it would appear of this Commission’s report another Commis sion of Inspection of 13 officials arrived on the 13th May and immediately began raiding houses and shops and searching motor lorries for contraband goods Luggage of travellers arriving at the Customs was rummaged and even mai l)a&lt;;s for npcotmtry did not escape inspection. The ruthless manner m which these searches were carried out caused intense resentment amongst all classes and culminated In one of the Inspectors being attacked and beaten by a mob of infu rl ated shopkeepers. The matter was reported to Tehran with the result that the Comms^on were ordered to confine their activities to the normal methods of detection, the Commission continued their work until December when the system of s^arate and independent inspecting bodies was abolished by the Central Government.^ Chamber of Commerce.—The only work carried out by this body during the year was to^ supervise the distribution of sugar and tea quotas to local merchants. Census—A census was carried ■out in the sub-ports m January and m Bushire in June where a house-to-honse inspection took place. The enquiries. jLs213VDhowever as regards the age of persons eligible for military service were con ducted with considerably less strictness than previously. Education Departments —This Department has 15 schools in Bushire and district and in the sub-ports under its management. No improvement has, however, been effected in its working or efficiency. Economic Condition.—There was no appreciable improvement in the economic condition in Bushire and district. The greater bulk of the population of the hinterland remained poverty stricken. The peasantry took to helping the extensive smuggling rife in the district either by acting as guides to the smugglers, or by enlisting as road guards and obtaining pay from the smugglers by giving timely information of the movements of Government preventive patrols. ‘ d With the object of alleviating this state of affairs and providing a living for the needy, the local officials requested and obtained sanction from the Central Government to re-start work on the Coast road between Bushire and Lingah which had been stopped for want of funds. Operations were com menced in September. A total of 500 men being employed on the scheme. According to statistics kept by the Police a large number of persons during the year migrated from Bushire and district to Mohammerah, Abadan and towms in theT interior and to Bahrain and the Arab Coast. Some of the poorer peasantry of jhe hinterland came into Bushire in January and the Municipality employed them in road-making and kept their families in a caravanserai outside the town. A proposal was put forward to erect a factory in Bushire for the manufac ture of gunny bags but the local merchants showed such lack of interest in the project that nothing more has since been heard of it. Bushire Municipality .—This Department remained throughout the year under the Honorary Presidency of Abdul Shakoor Amin, the Assistant Governor, Bushire, and received its monthly budget allotment of Tomans 2,000. In the beginning of 1934, the Municipality took steps to ensure sufficient supplies being' available to last the town until the next harvest. 50 tons of wheat were purchased and stored for sale to bakers. Tomans 40,000 had been received from the Revenue Department for the purpose. In April new taxes were levied as follows :— Persons leaving Bushire by sea Rials 8 per head 1st Class, Rials 4, 2nd Class and Rials 2 Deck passage. For travellers proceeding npcountry the tax was Rials 4 per head for passenger cars and Rials v 2 for lorries. The Excise tax on spirits was also raised by Rial 1. The object of these taxes was to raise funds for the local Government ele mental y school and provide 10 beds for a lying-in ward for poor persons in the Town Infirmary. A staff of 50 employees is maintained to look after the sanitation of the MAwn SECTION 4.

Some 300 riflel and a small quantity of ammunition were collected without opposition In March a regiment was sent to the Shib-Kuh district and commenced disarming the followers of the troublesome Shaikh Muhammad bin Ahmad Khalfan an§ other tribes there. Navy.—Yavar (Major) Ghulam Husain Khan Bayendor who was promoted during the year to the wank of Naib Sarhang (Lieut.-Colonel) remained in com mand of the Persian Navy. The h avy successfully-continued their efforts to check smuggling. 12 dhows were captured, several of which were burnt and others taken over for naval purposes. The gunboat ‘‘ Chahrokh ’ ’ was responsible for arresting Shaikh Muhammad bm Ahmad Khalfan (a Persian Arab Chief of Teben) who had been a thorn m the side ot the military and customs administration during the past ten years. Having found it difficult to remain at Teben, Shaikh Muhammad tried to escape m his motor dhow to Bahrain. Unfortunately for him he was sighted by the “ Chahrokh ” which happened to be patrolling that neighbourhood and after a chase the dhow was captured. Shaikh Muhammad and his companions were sent under arrest to Shiraz for trial. The following were the prizes captured during the year :— .. 3 dhows with 1,320 packages of con traband. Sloop “ Babr ” .. Sloop “ Palang ” Gunboat “ Karkas ” Gunboat “ Chahrokh ” Gunboati “ Chahbaz ” 1 dhow with 500 packages. 3 dhows with 440 packages. 2 dhows with 90 packages. 3 dhows with 600 packages. The “ Babr ” and “ Palang ” proceeded to Bombay for dry docking in January. Afterwards they visited Colombo to return the visit of the Com- mander-in-Chief, East Indies in H. M. S. “ Hawkins ” to Bushire in December 1933. SECTION 5. Aviatiou. Arab Side .—Imperial Airways. The Company carried out its weekly service along the Arab side of the Gulf without incident. Persian Side. —Thirty-seven British aviators passed through Bushire during the year. In December Lady Blanche Douglas and her pilot Mr. V. Ogden while on a flight to India had a forced landing at Maslileh-i-Bahmani in Tangistan, 60 miles south of Bushire. A rescue party was sent out by the Besidency and succeeded in bringing back Lady Blanche Douglas with great difficulty owing to the flooded state of the country-side following upon torrential rains. The aeroplane was just able to fly back to Bushire where the necessary repairs were effected and the aviators shortly after resumed their journey. Dutch and French.—The Royal Dutch Air Lines (K. L. M.) and Air France maintained their weekly services throughout the year. SECTION 6. Political Situation'. The policy of the Iranian Government of carrying out a thorough dis armament of the District which was steadily pursued all last year in the hinter land of Bushire bore good fruit and there was little lawlessness during the year under review. . _ . .. .6 CiUnUm AK Sabz the notorious renegade Road Guard referred to in last year’s Administration Report as having Deen persuaded to return to the fold &gt;ear s all fhnrities in their disarmament work, committed a murder in the^ course private dlspute. The local officials got rid of him by the t™ honoured, cheap and efficient method long approved of m Iran. One of the leading lien of Chahkutah was made to invigle him into his house and there shoot down his guest in cold blood, A gang of malefactors of Chahkutah a village on the Bushire-Shiraa road was dealt with in the same wa}« A Deputy Governor was appointed in Bandar Rig as Governor of Hyat- Pr ,T TPlloh and Liravi and the chiefs of the districts namely : I Ui r\ 11 rl Allah Karam Khan, Ali Khan, son of All Khan, Muhammad Khan, Aqa Khan, yvere ordered to proceed to Shiraz forthwith. One of them namely Allah Karara Khan complied with the order but the others are trying to obtain permission to remain at their homes. PcvsiQifi Mckvcifif Jask and ChaTkaT . At Jask the Oable and Wireless employees complained of encroachments on their area by the local Persian authorities. At Charbar owing to complaints by British Indian subjects, who were in difficulties with the local Persian authorities over the question of their nation ality, under instructions from His Majesty’s Minister, the Interpreter of the Kerman Consulate visited that port in June and in November Dr. Lincoln, His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, visited the same place in connection with the same complaints and was there at the end of the year. Up to October the administration of Jask and Charbar was carried out by the Chief Police official stationed there. In that month, however, a Governor for each port was sent down from Tehran* The Persian authorities, in spite of all their efforts, do not appear to be capable of coping with the turbulent inhabitants of this Province and the condi tion of the country remains disturbed and unsettled. Chirag Khan and Murad Khan, sons of Mustafa Khan (to whom the W ire less and Cable, Ltd. pay a subsidy for the protection of their lines) combined with another Chief called Kainaran Khan and raided in July Gerog, Jagin, Bahmadi and Yakdar. Ten persons were killed or kidnapped. Huts belonging to friendly Baluchis were destroyed, and several hundred camels, sheep, goats Carried off. In the same month the raiders also looted a Customs post at Sadich, wounded 2 Customs officials and decamped with merchandise worth Tomans 400 and 4 rifles. Discontent was rife at Charbar, Jask and districts as a result of the high handed treatment which the people received at the hands of the Iranian civil and military officials. Many of the inhabitants migrated to the Trucial Coast and Gwadur. 250 families dependants of Bahut Gul Muhammad went to Gwadur alone. _ As a result of numerous complaints received at Tehran an Inspecting Mission visited Charbar in February to investigate grievances. Enquiries were instituted and some of the Persian Baluchis were persuaded to return to theii' homes. In February the Persian Consul, Quetta, went by aeroplane to Gwadur, tmd then by camel to^ Jiunri, Pish-Khan and Suntesar where he tried to per suade Persian Baluchi emigrants to return to their homes but without success. In March Brigadier-General Mehdi Khan, Officer Commanding, Baluchis tan district, marched a large force to Iranshah Leshar to disarm the tribes m those districts. Several of the leading Chiefs were invited on the usual svorn promise of safe conduct and free pardon to come into camp, make their peace with the authorities and surrender their arms. k v ^?^i 0ne named Ashraf Khan apparently an unsophisticated individual was taken in by the fair words of the Iranian Commander. _ He and a numoei of his followers surrendered themselves and gave up their arms. They were all immediately placed under arrest.

P. WATTS, Major, Secretary, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. SECTION 8. Trade and Trade Facilities. General condition .—The year under review was one of the worst as far as trade conditions in Bushire and district were concerned. The continual reports of the stag-nancy of the market show the great difficulty the merchants had to face in their trade. During the last few years owing to lack of statistics for Bushire it is diffi cult to express any idea with regard to the volume of trade both in Imports and Exports. Although attempts have been made to obtain some sorts of statistics for the annual trade report submitted to the Depratment of Overseas Trade these will not help much because only the number of packages are given with out the value both as regards Imports and Exports. In view of the Iranian Government trade regulations in regard to import licences, business gradually slackened and fell away throughout the year. In fact trade in all staple goods is now placed in the hands either of a Govern ment Monopoly or syndicate, a few merchants -were able to join the syndicate and the rest were not able to do any business with the continent except in iron ware, and sundry goods. Part of the sugar trade and matches still remained as a Government monopoly and for other staple goods such as piece-goods, motor vehicles and opium a syndicate was formed with a limited number of merchants as partners. This Government attitude naturally caused a great decline in the import trade of Bushire. Such methods on the part of the Government completed this down ward trend and even the biggest merchants in the town found their hands tied at every turn by its regulations. No longer able to deal in sugar and other goods it is difficult to see what is left for them to do except employ their capital in speculation to sundry goods. As a result of the aforesaid difficulties Bushire has become an entrepot for upcountry markets and most of its needs are now supplied from Tehran by small dealers. The Iranian Government seems to wish to take all the main items of trade into its hands and increase its revenue not only by imposing taxes but in obtain ing profits over the monopolised goods. In July 1934 they decided to control and stabilize the price of export certificates by compelling merchants to sell them to the National Bank at the fixed rate of 9 per cent, and to buy at the rate of 131 per cent., payment to be made by the bank after three months and the transaction discounted if the merchant was in need of money before date. At the end of the year the price of export certificates was however raised to 30 per cent, by the’Government owing to the appreciation in the value of the silver Rial and merchants were not issued with any import licences unless they sold their export certificates as the fixed rate and then buy at almost double the price at which he sold. XJp’ to the end of the year there has been no sign of any improvement in the market and the Government neither helped merchants to extend their trade nor to overcome the stagnancy. Ls213FB p8 The Finance Minister on his tour of Bushire during the year however made no great concessions to merchants but only a reduction in the price of sugar for Bushire area m view ot the enormous c[uuntit\ of sugar being smuggled into the country. Foreign exchange during the first half of the year was very firm and business was fairly good but started to show signs of decline in the second half of the year when it dropped to Rials 54 for the sterling and Rials 4.05 for rupees. This decline of course gave no help to merchants as they were unable to export Iranian produce to obtain their import licences. In fact the merchants ceased forwarding consignments of Iranian produce abroad owing to the sudden decline in ‘ the rate of exchange because {a) of no demand on the continent and (5) owing to the fact that they had to sell their foreign exchange at such a low price as would involve them in losses. Opium .—Opium is most definitely a product which brings great profit to merchants when exported to the continent if it actually finds a market abroad. Since the Government monopoly was abolished and a syndicate established under the same title of “ Monopole d’Opium a Iran ” every effort has been made to find a market for this valuable produce but apparently with little success. It will be noticed from the figures for 1934-35 that exports of opium to the continent was much less even than last year. The total figure of 2,298 cases exported both for illicit and legitimate consumption shows a decrease of 3,669 cases as against the total figure of 5,967 cases exported last year. This decrease of course represents a very great loss to the Iranian revenue. The following details show the export of opium during the year :— April 1934 May 1934 June 1934 July 1934 August 1934 September 1934 November 1934 December 1934 February 1935 March 1935 Legitimate. S5 cases. 330 390 80 10 1 5? 5? 400 200 152 11 11 Illicit. 600 cases. Illicit 1,698 cases. 600 cases. 2,298 cases. Of the figure exported for shows the countries where opium legitimate consumption the following table was shipped :— Japan Germany United Kingdom .. France .. Holla nd .. .. 900 cases. .. 616 „ .. 40 „ .. 141 „ 1 case.The inci ease in the export of opium to Germany and Europe is reported to have been due to the Iranian Government waiving the monopoly on the export of the goods which it is believed have been bought for medical purposes As regards the export of illicit opium it is of some interest to note the decrease m the figure Total number exported during the 1933-34 was 3 787 cases whereas the total number for 1934-1935 was only COO cases. This marked decrease is said to have been due to the troubles in China where none of the smugglers could proceed with the usual trade in illicit opium. The Monopoly Department in conjunction with the Iranian Government however are trying their best to find a market for the stuff but it will prob- ably take a long time to succeed. The Finance Minister who was recently m Bushire showed an interest in the export of opium and he engaged Haii Seyyed Abdur Rasul Kazeroom to go to China and find buyers for Iranian opium. Foreign competition.—It would appear that the period of British supre macy must definitely be considered as ended. Although Russia which was a dangerous competitor in the Gulf for some years has already ceased to count in Bushire and other Iranian Gulf ports in the South, Japan—though she has not officially opened any branches in the Gulf—is showing some signs of competition in steamship services. The Bombay-Japan Conference Lines, ?.&lt;?., P. and 0., N'. Y. K., and 0. S.'K. lines maintain a regular monthly service between Japan and the Gulf Ports. These lines have now given their agencies to the Mesopotamia Iran Corporation Limited at Bushire. British steamers however still enjoy a monopoly of the coastal business. Of course the British India Steamship line does better than other British lines such as Stricks and Bucknall but it is evident that owing to the business lestrictions prevailing' in Iran at present the number of British cargo steamers discharging at Bnshire is less than formerly. Russian goods such as matches and piece-goods have began to be shipped by Strick boats from Port-said since July 1934 and the freight and other charges are paid by their Shiraz office. Another competitor was the Lloyd Triestino Line which opened a ser vice—agency entrusted to the Mesopotamia Iran Corporation Limited—in the month of September 1934, but it ceased calling at Bushire owing to lack of Cargo from Italy. It is interesting to note that this line accepted a low freight of 2!6&lt;L per hag for tobacco contracted from Strick Line in October 1934 and by this means they managed to obtain a cargo of 17,884 bags of tobacco for export via Port-said to Beirut. Japanese goods^,however have shown popularity in Bushire market owing to their cheapness. Bicycles, sundry goods, cotton piece-goods of all kinds— some of which are satisfactory as regards colour and design—find a market in Bnshire in preference to British and German goods. Financial .—The tendency for merchants to invest their holdings of money in the syndicate, the impossibility of turning over capital engaged in trade in any shape with the continent, the bad effect of the monopoly and enormous taxation imposed on trade in respect of the purchase of import certificates, payment of heavy road tax and other dues, and the difficulties experienced in finding markets abroad for Iranian products, all resulted in an increasing tightness of money. To the above points must be added the fact that any overseas business transaction takes, as a result of the restrictions in trade, three to four times as long to put through and involves greatly increased capital outlay, since the importer has to become exporter, and sell his export certifi cates at a loss to the National Bank and buy the same at almost double the cost. Money was tighter than the previous years and lack' of confidence among merchants added to the difficulty. The Government continues to draw money out of circulation and does not expend it in a manner in the least calculated to increase the country’s produc tivity and thus its real wealth. Iranian Government needs money very badly for its military, Navy and other departments and also for the Railway. Whenever the railway jetty at Bandar Shahpour is repaired it is washed away immediately by rough seas.10 Communication and transport .—Regular means of communication remained as in the previous years. The usual sea services of the British India fast and slow mails are still the regular services in the Gulf. There has naturally been less motor transport operating on account of the falling off in freight for upcountry. The rate of hire approximately was very low for the same reason and some times it did not pay even the cost of petrol and oil consumed by the lorry. The Mashilleh was in the same position as before and in winter was very bad for motor traffic. The K. L. M. air line still runs twice a week to and from Europe and it is said that it will increase its services by four aeroplanes per ween next year, i.e., 1935-36. The Air France also maintains an air service in the Gulf and runs 9 aeroplanes a month. FRANK H.

There was a slight falling off in the number of malaria cases, but malaria still accounted lor over a third of the number of attendances. In November and December there was an outbreak of influenza which was, on the whole, mild. Most eases were left with an extremely irritating cough but some cases deve loped bronchopneumonia. This accounted for an increase of nearly five hundred attend ances for respiratory diseases. The epidemic affected all ages and classes, blit the effects were more lasting in European children.

Situation .—Situation has remained undisturbed and progress has continued in the pacification and development of the Province. Tribal .—With the exception of a few isolated cases of “ brigandage” by tribesmen in the more remote districts, no further difficulties were experienced after the surrender and removal to the capital of Ali Khan Qashqai. An example was given to the tribesmen by executions in Shiraz of a few “ robber ” leaders and in Tehran, this winter, of some of the minor unruly leaders, mainly from the Mamassani. The disciplinary administration imposed upon the tribes by the military governors appointed by the G. 0. C. Ears Brigade, with the extension of the Amnieh stations and blockhouses and the lack of ambition and of local influence of the young hereditary chieftains, who are also under constant supervision, have contributed to the policy of the breaking-up of the tribes as a unit. The tribal system has been further attacked by the law enacted for the forthcoming elections to the Majliss. Under this the special ballot boxes hitherto issued for the tribal vote are done away with and votes are to be recorded at prescribed centres, together with those of the settled inhabitants. It is stated that Government intends, within the next two years, to complete the permanent settlement of the tribes in defined areas and to abolish the annual migrations. An official was at Shiraz during the year to prepare a report on the subject for the Shah. The principal difficulty will lie in the alloca tion of suitable watering and grazing grounds. The new town of Tal-i-Khosrau, 40 miles to the N. E. of Ardekan, has risen as part of this policy. Security .—Public security was good, reports of attacks upon lorries on or near the main roads having mostly proved exaggerated. There were a small number of highway robberies in distant districts, in one of which the Director of the Roads Department was robbed of Rials 30,000. Governorate General. —H. E. Mirza Majid Khan Ahy, who took over the duties of Governor General in September 1933, has shown himself a capable and conciliatory official and has continued to be helpful to His Majesty’s Consul. Attitude to Foreigners .—The instructions of the central authorities pro hibiting all officials, with the exception of the Chief of Police, from having any relations with foreign representatives, were rigidly observed. The prohibition has been extended to leading notables, merchants and others, some of those who appeared at the Consulate on their business being subsequently called upon by the police to explain their visit. The officials are suffering from spy mania. National sensibility, perhaps intolerance, cultivated by the press of the capital at certain seasons, finds a rich ground in Ears, where British officials have commanded considerable local influence, whilst it is difficult for the present generation to forget the formation and maintenance here of the South Persia Rifles. These conditions have led to the otherwise inexplicable treatment of Mr. Christopher Sykes, who arrived at Shiraz in February on a tour of the Pro- \ince. He was not only refused permission to visit Firuzabad but requested not to leave the town, being eventually permitted to proceed to Bushire upon the condition that he then quitted the country. The order was subsequent!} rescinded on official intervention. The Dominican Fathers, the Reverend Dominic Blencowe, O. P. und the Reverend Cyprian Rice O. P., who arrived at Shiraz in 1933 with the object ot founding a Dominican Monastery, also came under the ban, owing to then ?T ri ^ sh ^ natio ? alit ? an . d to the fact that Father Rice had been a member ot H. M. Consular Service. The authorities convinced themselves that Father Rice had served as a subaltern in the South Persia Rifles. These conditions, coupled with the ^liability of the authorities to understand the work of theFathers and the poor health of Father Blencowe, eventually led to their with drawal and the closing down of the monastery..

Work has been proceeding at the Bag-i-Takht barracks, to the N. of the town, to double the accommodation available for the infantry and artillery. New barracks to house the cavalry regiment ^are being put up, about one mile to the S. of the town, on the Bushire road. The construction of aeroplane sheds at the aerodrome is under consideration and a French avuation adviser visited Shiraz in June. The troops at Shiraz are receiving regular training and the appearance of officers and men is good. Sartip Ibrahim Khan Zandieh is G. 0. C. The Southern Amnieh (Road Guards) Command in the Pro vince of Fars was abolished in August, when the force in the area became the 8th Shiraz Amnieh Regiment. The 19th Regiment of Amnieh of Fars was moved to Laristan in March. The discipline and conduct of the road guards has shown improvement, although complaints of the exactions of some of the men in the remoter areas are heard from time to time. Communications .—A new road between Shiraz and Tal-i-Khosrau was opened in the early part of the year and repaired after the spring rains. A road from Shiraz to Bandar-i-Lingeh, via Jarhum, Lar and Bastak, was reported to be nearing completion in the late summer. No further progress has been made on the new Shiraz-Firuzabad road. The approach to the Qoran Gate entrance of the town (Isfahan-Shiraz road) was widened to permit of two vehicles passing each other. A new avenue to cut through the town of Shiraz from W. to E. was begun toward^ the end of the year. A telegraph instrument was set up at Dehbid in September. The Shiraz-Bushire road was closed to traffic for short periods from January to March owing to heavy rains and snow. Snow on the heights at Dehbid stopped passage on the Shiraz-Isfahan road in February. Irrigation .—An attempt was made to increase the water supplies of the town and district of Shiraz, with the expert advice of Dr. Lepmann, a German civil engineer. The latter had not obtained a contract by the end of the year and resigned. ’ j A project to improve irrigation in the Ramjerd area, by the construction of a more solid barrage for the waters of the Band-i-Amir, was being con sidered. Economic conditions .—The economic condition of the Province has been bad owing to the tightness of money, the restrictions upon trade and the drain of taxation, which has proved a heavy burden upon all classes. Many merchants attribute this state to the large sums sunk annually in the armed forces and in the building of the railway, a policy which withdraws a large part of the liquid assets of the country from circulation, without productive result. Conditions locally were further aggravated in the early part of the year by the failure cf two of the leading sarraf, on the top of the failure of Seyyed Abdul Rasul Kazaruni. The bazaar was very weak and several small bank- rnntcies followed. The Banks were compelled to come to the assistance of other sarraf to strengthen the market.18 A branch of the Agricultural Bank was opened in Shiraz in the month of May to assist growers. The Agricultural departments took measures to promote the cultivatinn of cotton and beetroot. Cotton Spinning Mill .—The Shiraz Cotton Spinning Mill of 3,200 spindles machinery by Platt &amp; Co. of Oldham, motor and electrical equipment by the General Electric Company and Metropolitan Vickers, to which two power engines by Mireless are to be added shortly, began work in May 1934 under a British mill manager. Mr. Hussein Agar (’Etemad-ul-Tujar), formerly a merchant of Manchester is the chairman of the board of directors and the moving spirit in the venture' The output of the mill was quickly disposed of for several months in advance The undertaking has proved so profitable that it is proposed to increase the number of spindles. Full output has been handicapped by the lack of suitable labour. The construction of a second mill was being seriouslv considered at the end of the year by one of the leading local industrialists. Sugar refinery.—The promise of Government to endow this Province with a Sugar factory materialised in the summer when work upon the buildings started on a site at Marvdasht, near the waters of the Bandi-i-Amir on the Shiraz-Persepolis road. Tn the autumn it was found that the Agricultural Department was unable to complete the building owing to the incompetence, etc., of the officials and a contract for the work w^as given to Swedish public works contractors in the capital. The machinery is to be supplied by the Skoda Works and is due in the spring, via tne Caspian. The contract provided for despatch via Bushire but it was round that some of the parts were too heavy and too bulky for road trans port from that port. - . , J rh u e Prospects of this factory are dependent upon the successful growing &lt;&gt; e ee roo in the Province, a cultivation upon which there is little practical r n ° wle o! e at the preSent - The actual cos t of production is t0 fro 5 1 20 P P er cent - to 300 per cent, greater than the price at hich sugar of Continental manufacture can be offered c. i. f.

The abolition of the “ hazzari ” (Monopoly department control of ground under cultivation and estimate of production) and the undertaking by the department to purchase all properly prepared quantities next year have led to increased sowings in the province. Towards the end of the year exports of almonds to India were despatched via Zahedan and the Indian Railways. Arrivals of tea for the Shiraz and Isfahan markets by this route have been reported since August. The opening up of the route is attributed to the decrease in the railway transport charges. Soviet activities .—The activities of the Soviets during the year appear to have been limited to their Trading Organisation. Merchants who had been persuaded in the past to subscribe to the Russian Bank and who had tried to obtain a refund of their investment were informed that the application must be made in person in Moscow. The Soviets Trading Agency continued to make local purchases of all sorts during the year. Merchants claim that the Russian handling of lamb skins will lead to the loss of the Shiraz lambskin trade in Europe as the skins are sorted for re-sale in Russia and only the lower qualities described as Persian. The higher grades are labelled as Bookhara and Afghan skins. Ferdausi celebrations .—The Ferdausi celebrations were held at Shiraz from October 6th to 12th when the Governor General opened a new boys’ school and referred to the prospect of the opening of a public library. The funds for these receptions, exhibitions, etc., were obtained by a form of public levy upon merchants, shopkeepers, government officials and a house To house collection. Several of the official guests to the Tehran-Meshed-Taus celebrations, including Mr. John Drinkwater, passed through Shiraz, after visiting Perse- polis, on their return. Surveys .—The geological survey by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Ltd., of the Shiraz-Jahrum-Niriz-Kazerun area was completed in the autumn. Dr. K. Washington Gray and his assistants have returned to Abadan. Archaeological .—Sir Aurel Stein K.C.I.E., who had arrived in November 1933 for an extended but rapid examination of prehistoric mounds in the S. and E. areas of this Province completed his explorations and left for London in May. Permission to visit the Lar and Darab areas was eventually obtained for him through the Governor General who succeeded in persuading the mili tary authorities to withdraw their objection. Difficulties, which threatened further work at Persepolis by the present Mission under Professor Hertzfeld, arose during the year between the Persian Government and the representatives of the Oriental Institute of Chicago. Good progress towards a settlement of the points at issue was reported to have been made towards the end of the year, after a division of the finds tor which Monsieur Goddard represented the government. Consulates.—M y. H. A. D. Hoyland M.B.E., arrived at Shiraz on February 15th, 1934 on appointment as His Majesty’s Consul and assumed charge from. Mr. F. H. Gamble. Mr. Gamble proceeded to Bushire as Acting Vice-Consul. Mr. L. F. »L. Pyman and Mr. L.

His Mo/iesni s Consul. Major C. H. Lincoln, O.B.E., held cliara;e through out the year. Local Government. Panda^ ALbas. Agha Ismail Khan, Bahadur, held charge of the Governor- ate throughout the year under review. As reported in previous years, the Governor has no administrative duties, as all the different departments are now in existence with their respective powers and, m consequence, his chief duties have been confined to the supervision of the Municipality, of which he is President. He is without doubt very enthusiastic in connection with the improvement of the town, especially the constructions of new roads by dismantling houses whichever come in alignment, for which little or no compensation is paid ; and the water supply to the town through the qanat system. Aghai Maghroori, Chief of the Census Department, Bushire, who had been to Laristan on inspection duty, returned on the 26th May 1934.

Revenue Department.—Mirza Mohamed Khan Naumani, Director of Reve nues, after handing over charge to Mirza Muhamed Ali Khan Zand, left for Kashan on the 20th December 1934. When the Minister of Finance visited Bandar Abbas in February 1935, he amalgamated the Revenue Department with the Customs Department and trans ferred the office there. This amalgamation is a blessing to the poor as the extortion of money by this department now ends. Excise Department .— Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Rahimi, Excise Officer for Bandar Abbas, arrived from Tehran on the 6th July 1934. In August 1934, the house of Kerbelai Abdullah Bushin, a local merchant, vas searelTod bv the Excise Officer and all gold ornaments found were conhs- sated, on the ground that these were bought with the intention of smuggling Torn the countrv. A telegram was sent to the Chief Excise Officer at Bin ! skin o' him Pi quote the law to confiscate gold ornaments possessed by mhabit- mtsVthi countiy according to their position. The confiscated articles were eventually returned to the owner. Mida \li Asghar Khan Rahimi was asked by telegram to hand over i M / ,4 -p;„.Vnee Officer and to proceed to Bushire. He took no notice ot edfl ddddi n t lor Tehrad on the 25th October 1934. During Ins W term of office at Bandar Abbas, be borrowed money from vanous mer- :hants to the extent of Rials 9,000. On hearing of his recall, the creditor22 approached the Police and the judicial authorities to stop him from going, but he managed his escape quietly. The police sent telegrams to the intermediate towns to have him returned, but nothing has been heard. Minab.- -Agliai Nazimi, Excise Officer for Minab, arrived from Tehran via Bushire on the 6th July, and proceeded to join his appointment on the 10th July 1934. He was in charge until the post was finally abolished in Bandar Abbas and Minab in September 1934. Linfjah. —Mirza Hassan Khan Dariabaghi, held charge as Director of Reve nue from November 1934. National Bank of /raw.—Aqeyi Zainal Abedin Khan Montazini remained as Manager of the local bank throughout the year. Two officials of the National Bank of Iran, Sayyed Inayatullah Tabatabi (younger brother of the famous Sayyed Ziya, the earstwhile Iranian Prime Minister and Dictator) and Mr. Joseph, arrived on inspection duty from Kerman and Bushire on the 5lh and 6th December 1934, respectively. The former went to Bushire on the 13th and the latter proceeded to Kerman on the 8th December 1934. In April 1934, some 900 bars of silver were landed at Bandar Abbas from England in transit to India via Kerman and Zahidan, most of the consignment being ha]idled by the local branch of the National Bank. In May last the Ittefagheyeh A Co., received a telegram from Bombay that the Government of India had put a stop to the importation of silver in transit from England to India via Zahidan. This caused much embarrassment and the dealers, includ ing the National Bank of Iran, were holding up their consignments of about 1,500 bars. They were eventually obliged to ship to Bombay by B. I. Steamers. The selling quotations of the Bank on London and Bombay during the year under report were as follows :— On London— Rials. Highest 62-50 per £. Lowest 66-00 „ Average 78-CO „ * On Bombay— Highest 620 per Rs. 100 Lowest let/ JJ Average 580 „ Post and Telegraphs. Bandar Ahhas. Agha Mirza Ibrahim Khan Arbabi remained in charge as Director oi Posts and Telegraphs throughout the year. t. Dir( ' d ? r Posts and Telegraphs for Gulf Ports, who travelled to Jask (iv air, arrived at Bandar Abbas on inspection dutv on the 27th September and left tor Bushire on the 11th October 1934. The work of repairing the telegraph lines on Kishm Island, which links Bandar Abbas by cable to Henjam, had been taken in hand by the local Tele- giapli nut lion ties at: tbe beginning of the financial year, with a view to establish ing direct communication between the two places. At the time of writing this report, the cable portion oi this line still remains to be repaired. no* ^ (n e ! nder ’ Mirza Najaf Azari, Accountant and Cashier of the local Post Oihce who misappropriated Government money to the value of Rials 6,300 and cc iii risgmse to Lie opposite Arab Coast, was pursued by 2 Policemen frorr Kishm m civilian dress who discovered him in Khasab and with the help of tin . ieilsn airested and brought him to Bandar Abbas for trial. This unprece um &lt; action on the part ot the Sheikh of Khasab in surrendering an Iraniaideserter to unauthorised persons caused wide-spread the public to believe that the powers of the Pehlevi countries beyond. surprise, and can only lead regime extend even to the Municipality. ^fc^s.-From the 1st November 1934 six new members have been eleeied tor Bandar Abbas Municipality. One of the members Mr Yousif Lutf Ah hhunji proprietor of the Bandar Abbas Spinning Mill, has been ecom MuMripahty 1 7 Governor for appointment of President of the M hen the Minister for Finance received the deputation of local merchants and traders at his residence, he expressed his regret to see the town in such a miserable and hlthy condition He asked them to change these conditions as soon as possible and assured them of Government support. He also ordered that the sum ot Rials 130,000 standing to the credit of the Municipality for some years he placed at the disposal of the present Board to utilise it as they thought necessary Besides tins, he issued orders that henceforth all taxes of 15 dinars (7o cents) collected by the Customs as wharfage on every package, which was spent tor the up keep of the pier, should be given to the Municipality, and the Customs should meet the expenses for up keep of the pier from their own budget. A balance ot Rials 9,000 which was with the Customs was, therefore, transferred to the Municipality. In addition, he promised that he would do his best to allot a sum of Rials 100,000 annually from the next financial year for the local Muni cipality so that with all this income they should be able to improve the conditions and sanitation of the town and establish a proper Municipal Hospital. Water Supply .—The work on the abandoned qanat (underground water channel) was resumed at the end of November 1934 and a small stream of fresh water now flows to the Police Office. As the water flows through uncemented trenches from Naiband (a distance of two miles) it is a bit brackish. The Governor hopes that, before the end of March 1935, the trenches in the town will be completed and when the permanent stream of water flows the clay will radi cate the trenches and the water will be quite fit for drinking purposes. If this flow of water continues during the hot season, and the public are quite satisfied, the Governor intends to destroy all Barqas (reservoirs), which are source of danger for all water-borne diseases, more specially the guineaworm. Electricity and Ice Supply .—The electric plant for lights worked w T ell throughout the year. The ice factory, which was closed for 2 years for want of an experienced mechanic to put the machine in proper working order, has been repaired by a German, Herr Hoskar Speck, the tourist in a small canvas canoe, who was held up waiting for a new one from Hamburg when the old one was found no longer seaworthy. Charitable Dispensary .—This dispensary was closed from the beginning of the Summer as Dr. K. H. Dumree, Medical Officer, finding his pay inadequate without practice, and paucity of the staff, resigned the post and taken up an appointment as Medical Officer under the Road Administration in Mazendran. The Consulate staff, who were formerly treated free of charge by Dr. Dumree, will have to depend on the Quarantine Medical Officer, who cares little for the treatment and or recovery of patients but is ever ready to pocket their fees. Roads .—The main road- -the so-called “ Avenue’’—has ben partly com pleted the work having to be abandoned for lack of funds, but the financial sup port granted by the Minister of Finance in February 1935 has caused the resumption of work, and a great improvement rendered feasible by one of the clearance schemes, which will materially change the centre part of the town. The demolition of a number of small and undesirable houses in the town will permit the construction of cross roads at a very moderate cost. Much ol the propertv affected belongs to the poor, some of whom were compensated, anp some allotted plots of ground in other quarters. The construction of the new cross l oads will, no doubt, enable a lot of wheeled traffic to pass to and fiom the town. A private enterprise is the construction of a laige iiuiiibei of houses on either side of the main road for the staff of the Customs Depaitment. National Garden.—At the entrance of the town on the main Kerman motor road a garden called Bggh-i-Milli (National garden), which was laid put by the Ls213FDOn the 5th April 1934 three Missionary ladies from India, Misses Snow, Gaze and Bourdillan, who were returning to Europe on leave via Iran and ’Iraq arrived at Bandar Abbas but were refused to land by the Police and the Customs authorities, as they had failed to obtain visas from the Iranian Consul at Karachi, and representation by His Majesty’s Consulate proved futile ; the party was obliged to proceed to Basrah where Miss Snow obtained the Iranian Consul’s visa and returned to Bandar Abbas where she disembarked for Kerman. Instructions were issued from this Consulate to Messrs. Mackinnon, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Karachi and Bombay to the effect that in future passports of ail passengers wishing to proceed to Iran should be examined to make sure that the Iranian Consul’s visa had been obtained on their passports prior to sailing. Bandar Abbas. —Naib Mohamed Khan Ghanipur remained as Officer Com manding Amuieii Force throughout the year. Hie strength of the force in this town is about 30 men. Lingah .—Sultan Zayairi held charge as Officer Commanding Anmieh Force throughout the year. The strength of the force in the town and suburbs is about 200 strong. The Court at Bandar Abbas having closed down for the Summer months with effect from 11th July 1934, Haji Seyyed Mir Mohamed Khan Hussami, Chief Judge and Public Prosecutor left for Kerman, while Jamaludm Khan Simlawi stayed behind to prepare the pending cases for the re-opening of the Court. rr he local Adlieh Court re-opened on the 1st Mihr (23rd September 1934) and Samawi was officiating as Public Prosecutor and Judge, as llaji Ilussaim extended his leave owing to ill-health. Haji Hussaim eventually returned on the 19th October 1934. Amnieh. Judicial. from Tehran via Bushire on the bth and returned on tne Customs. Vinciaf DirectorateIhroughOTt^tl 1 ® He still has the reputation of being ■xrnwT nvi^.v.-icrvivaVilia in Pfinlinp - with merchants. During the stay of Mon. Southern Iran, he supervised Ls213FD26 House with semi-circular stairs of cement concrete. The building was com pleted in August 1934. As there was no skilled electrician in Bandar Abbas to erect electric installation in the Customs House, Herr Hoskar Speck, a German tourist, was engaged. Now the whole building as well as the pier is fitted with electric lights and a special light of 300 c. p. is fitted in the middle of the flagstaff of the pier to facilitate navigation at night. When he received the deputation of local merchants and traders, the Minister of Finance quoted the instance of the reduction in prices of sugar he had made in Bushire, and of his intention to do the same for this Province. He advised them to form Companies for dealing in Sugar, to buy in wholesale from Government and sell to retail dealers, with a fair margin of profit for the Company. He also advised them to co-operate with the Government officials in suppressing smuggling, and expose the illegitimate dealers. He accord ingly issued orders to the local Customs to take over all stocks from merchants and return in kind at the reduced rate with the new banderole which is for use within sixteen miles from the Iranian Coast. A Company with a capital of Rials 100,000 is reported to be formed to purchase sugar and loaf sugar for provincial use at the following rates :— Crystal sugar at Rials 7 a Batman, Loaf sugar at Rials 8 a Batman, and sell them at a profit of Cents 40 a Batman to the retail dealers, and the latter could increase the prices by Cents 75, namely, the price of crystal sugar and loaf sugar are to be Rials 8-15 and 9-15 a Batman, respectively. The smugglers on the other hand reduced the price of contraband sugar, namely, loaf sugar from Rials 7 to 3 per cube and crystal sugar from Rials 15 to 8 per man. Livs/ah .—Mirza Zaeddin Kamyah remained in charge as Director of Cus toms throughout the year. He is a good and patriotic man but criticises the present Government policy. He made several attempts personally to appre hend smugglers, but as Amnieh and Police were involved in smuggling and supporting the smugglers, his attempts were futile. Military. Bandar Abbas .—Naib Sarangh Abdullah Khan Arab Nejad remained as Officer Commanding Troops up to the 14th October 1934. He was reheved by barhang Abdul Hussain Khan Saqafi. bultan Abbas Khan Gzarzand, Military Engineer, arrived from Kerman in Apul 1934 to survey the site of the old South Persia Rifle barracks at Naiband wdh a view to constructing barracks for accommodating a Brigade.

Bandar Abbas .—570 conscripts were recruited during the year under review. Linfiah.—No one has been recruited in Lingab but from the beginning of the Nornz an office will be opened and that the Lingah people will be recruited for the Navy. Condition of the Country. Bandar Abbas .—In the beginning of May 1934, the relatives of one Akbar, a Bashakirdi outlaw, who was hanged last year and whose wife was being escorted by four soldiers to be handed over to the Military authorities at Kahnii in Budbar, attacked the party killing the soldiers and setting the woman free. The Customs depot at Sedijoh was raided by Beyaban outlaws and in the skirmish which took place between the latter and the coastal guards, one of the guards was wounded and brought to Bandar Abbas in May last, and sent to Kerman for treatment. In May 1934, the Financial Agent of Minab, while returning from Roudan, where he had been to collect outstanding revenues, was held up by Basliakirdies, who relieved him of all his cash and disarmed the two road-guards, who accom panied him as body guards. One Ohulam Shah, a deserter from the Amnieh (Road Guard), who was wanted by the Amnieh for the murder of a road guard, joined the Amir, an out law. The party—consisting 14 in number—were harrassing the people travel ling between the various villages and among other things, have killed one Haji Mushir’s brother-in-law near Sarkoon. Ghulam Shah sent word to Haji Mushir (a well-known merchant of Bandar Abbas) that be would not be satisfied until he killed Haji Mushir himself, at whose instigation the relatives of Ghulam Shah were caught by the villagers and banded over to the Road Guard authori ties. 8 persons from village of Kala Qazi were arrested by the Road Guards authorities in this connection, on the evidence of a donkey man who accompanied the latter on the tragic journey, and brought to Bandar Abbas tor trial. Alien the donkcyman was cross-examined, he denied the statement recorded by the road guards, as it was taken under threat from the relatives of the murdered person. Ghulam Shah, referred to above, came to Bandar Abbas to seek amnesty and said that he never indulged in highway robbery. He is said to have been given a sum of Rials 100 as present and promised more if he gave his occasional services to Amnieh authorities in locating the other outlaws. Amir, the outlaw (a boy of 18 years of age) who was wanted by the authori ties for murdering a road guard at Sarzeh was caught by his uncle, handed over to the Road Guard authorities at the beginning of October, as bis uncle was ordered to oroduce the youth, failing which, he would be taken io tasx. Ihe Amir flatly denied the charge of murder and stated that he had taken to robbery only in order to obtain a living and not bloodshed. His wife, who followed him to Bandar A bbas, is kept as a maid servant by one of the road guards. Four deserters from the Army, who manag*ed to escape with then rifles, were harrassing travellers in Minab area. On the night of the 2mid August, they raided the house of a petty trader ot Kishm at a village of Deh-ustac. m LS213FD28 the district of Minab, killing the man with his wife and son and mutilated their bodies. The security in Minab and Beyaban areas is so disturbed that travelling from one village to another in broad day light cannot be undertaken alone. Looting of houses and carrying away of cattle is a matter of frequent occur rence. Several thefts were brought to the notice of the local police authorities iii the month of August 1934, one of which was that the house of 2 post office clerks was broken in'o and all valuable property stolen. No attempt has been made to capture tne culprits. Condition of Roads. Bandar Abbas.—The road authorities started widening the Tang-i-Zagh on the Bandar Abbas-Kerman motor road in November 1934 and since then the traffic and mail services on this road has become very irregular owing to con- stunt land slides. Sometimes the mails are transhipped at the Tang with great difficulty bv means of camels and donkeys, thus mails from Kerman and vice versa take' about 6 to 10 days to reach either destination. As the Minister of Finance was to go by the * Bandar Abbas-Kerman road to Tehran, the road authorities engaged extra labourers and cleared the debris by the 12th February 1935. The Minister of Finance promised to provide funds for widening the Tang. Linciah. —The Lar-Bastak roads, which were recently repaired, have been washed down by the recent rains and are impassable for wheeled traffic. The Bushire-Lingah road is nearing completion and it is reported will be •open for traffic bv the end of March 1935. This road is mainly to prevent smuggling of goods from Dubai and Bahrain. It is widely known that the per sons entrusted with this work are deliberately doing it very slowly in order to continue smuggling activities for as long as possible. Slaves. No slave sought asylum at this Consulate during the year under report. Aviation. The French aeroplane Air France F-Alzar western bound 'with 3 French passengers made a forced landing at Bandar Abbas on the 1st November 1934 at 8 a.m. due to some engine trouble, and took off for Bushire at 11 a.m. the same day. Lady Blanche Douglas arrived from Bushire in her aeroplane G-Atwy at 12-30 p.m. on the 16th November 1934 and left for Jask at 3-30 p.m. the same day. Roumanian Engineer lon-Cociasu in his own moth plane Yr-Aan arrived from Bukharest via Turkey, Iraq and Bushire at 4-50 p.m. on the 3rd March 1935. He took off at 6 aJm. on the 4th for Calcutta via Jask, Gwadur and Karachi. Navy. French. —Cruiser “ Bougainville ” arrived from Karachi on the Hth February and remained at the outer anchorage for 24 hours owing to rough weather. The Admiral on board and the Captain paid a visit to the local Governor at 11 ajm. and the Cruiser left after the Governor returned the call on board.

J &amp; ’ The usual two minutes’ silence was observed at 11 a.m. on the Arnrstice day at His Majesty’s Consulate and by all British subjects in Bandar Abbas. Charbar .—As a result of complaints received from certain British subjects at Char bar against the high-handed actions of the local authorities in com pelling them to adopt Persian nationality, Major C. H. Lincoln, O.B.E., His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman-Bandar Abbas, received instructions from His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran to proceed to Charhar. Major C. H. Lincoln, left Kerman, on the 24th November and arrived at Charhar on the 30th November 1934 where he stayed until 19th March 1935. The result of his visit, enquiries and work in connection with the question form the subject of a separate report to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, with copies to tbe li on’hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Red Oxide of Iron. Hormuz Island. —6,600 tons of ore were shipped by British vessels diiring the year under report to the following countries :— Calcnita . 300 tons.

On the 12th January 1935, Nasrullah Khan Jehangir, Director of Petroleum Department under Ministry of Finance and Mon. Agababaoff, Armenian dec - ideal Adviser to the Ministry of Finance, inspected the red oxide mine. They returned to Tehran having obtained tenders from Khan Sahib Ibrahim Geftadary to work the mines for the Government, but m the end they have decided to work the mines and effect sales themselves The local Finance Department have deputed clerk to take over the stock of excavated red oxide from the deputy of Haji Muin. The first cnnssicnmoBt of 3,000 tons of Red Oxide, after having been taken over from Haji Muin Bushiri by the Government was ^pped by s. ^ “ Tabaristan ” for United Kingdom between the 11th and l'«&gt; March I.m. - certain Mustafa Khan Kohbnd, the eat-clerk of Haji f broker Ministry of Finance to supervise the shipment.

Ls213EP30 Trade. ■, ,, r rk ■ Bandar Abbas.—T \\q entire trade during 1934-35 was far from satisfactory. The imports were greatly reduced specially owing to the embargo placed on piece-goods and twist. As soon as the embargo was declared about July 1934^ the premium on import permits for these commodities went up by leaps and bounds. Just a few days before this the import permit premium on piece-goods was about 8 per cent, when it went up to 30 per cent, in less than a week. Later on it rose to as much as 50 per cent. Also brisk buying up by certain capitalists Iranian Firms of the stocks already lying in the bazar began almost immediately. This, however, gave temporary relief to those merchants who had been losing heavily on piece-goods. During the whole year, owing to constant fluctuations in the' price of export certificates, the piece-goods market remained unsteady. The sole importing rights for piece-goods have been given by the Government to the Iran Trading Co., Ltd., and no import permits for this commodity are now given to individual merchants. So far no piece-goods have yet been imported into Bandar Abbas by this Company, but it is heard that the principal piece- goods merchants of Bandar Abbas have been advised by the responsible parties to form a company which should purchase piece-goods from the Iran Trading Co., Ltd., for the entire Bandar Abbas market. In short the Bandar Abbas Company will have to work as the sole selling Agents for the Iran Trading Com pany. No definite steps have yet been taken here in this connection. Cording and Spinning Mi//.—Mr. Y. L. Khonji, an Iranian merchant, who was trading in Bahrain and Bombay, bought a second-hand mill in Bombay in 1934 and installed it in the village called ‘ Khojita ’ a distance of about half a mile from the Consulate. The buildings have been constructed without any technical knowledge or plan on sand mounds. To erect this mill he engaged 8 millhands from Bombay on one year’s contract. In December 1934, Mr. Thomas Bryan, FJectric Engineer of Krupp Indian Trading Co., Ltd., Bombay, brought a Diesial engine and started the mill on the 1st January 1935 and left for Bombay on the 11th. The engine is of 300 h. p. and is now* run by an Iranian electrician. The Indian Spinners instructed Mr. Khonji to import 30 or 40 Indian labourers to start the work, but, under instructions from the Local Governor, he refused to bring. Indians, and compelled them to teach the Iranians, which they refused to do and so tendered 3 months’ notice to leave Bandar Abbas. The Weaving Master has already left for Bombay on medical grounds and an Englishman from Manchester on Rs. 600 p. m. has taken his place. Two bales of (200 lbs. each) cotton is used every day of which a net loss of 120 lbs. (30 per cent.) per day is estimated, for want of skilled labourers and inferior cotton from Bafsinjan. It is reported that samples of thread were distributed to mer chants in the interior which were not appreciated. As Mr. Khonji was losing heavily by employing unskilled Iranians, attempts were made to induce the Indian spinners to sign a new agreement accepting spinners’ terms, increased their salary by 15 per cent, and he sent one man to engage 30 Indians, notwith standing the pressure brought on Mr. Khonji to substitute the foreign elements by Iranians. It is expected that the Indian spinners will take up the production of cotton yarns on a large scale on the arrival of men from Bombay. . dAngali. Trade is in the hands of a few r who have ready money, and is dwindling. Most of the people do business in rice and flour from Mohammerah and ihe profit derived is said to be very trifling. The sales of foreign products are very few and the most of the cargo imported is reshipped to Mohammerah and Bandar Abbas. A deputation of Lingah merchants arrived Bandar on the 13th February 3o to interview the Minister of Finance, with a view to invite him to Lingah to see the condition of the country, to decrease the Customs and other tariffs and to grant them all facilities to improve the trade in Lingah, but unfortunately the Minister left for Kerman the previous dav. Nevertheless, they asked the Minister s permission by telegram if they could see him at Kerman to represent their grievances, but were informed to send their petition to Tehran. t Shipping and Navigation. 118 steamers of all nationality aggregating 250,170 tons entered and cleared dnr ' ng f e y L f a I' 193 k 35 - Of these, 113 vessels with a total tonnage of Tonhlt”* 1 ilas : 5 vessels of the German Hansa Line with a total tonnage of 20,387 entered and cleared the port.'ta^, kosti tk (jOVi rcsponiL 'Ki life imife Boiakk 't SOorli e iel vei ISS OI nd infeiis-' ifP No Soviet Mercantile Fleet entered this port during the year. 8. S “ Haidari ’ ’ and - Flood ” of Bombay Persian Steam Navigation Co, Ltd, called at Bandar Abbas after a lapse of several years to resume compete tion with the weekly British India Steam Ships in the Gulf. The Director of Customs showed some interest in helping the merchants to clear the o&gt; 0 ods and encouraged the consigners to give them a quick despatch on favourable terms. Political. The town remained quiet throughout the year. The Iranian New Year was celebrated by the local authorities on the 21st March 1934. Quarantine and Sanitation. Bandar Abbas. —Dr. Tabib Zadeh, after handing over charge of Bandar Abbas Quarantine to Dr. Murteza Khan Farees, left for Tehran on the 27th February 1935. At the beginning of the year, scarlet fever was detected by the Health Officer amongst the prisoners awaiting trial in the Police station. Dr. Quolli arrived from Tehran at the beginning of August 1934 and relieved Dr. Hashmi of Hen jam. Lingak .—The present Health Officer cares little for the sick or poor but a great deal for money. He has little or no medicine in stock and most people who can afford it and in the case of sickness proceed either to Bahrain or Muscat for treatment by the American Missionary Doctors. Economic conditions. It was not a very prosperous year owing to untimely rainfall, although con sidered to be better than the previous year. The date harvest was good, but owing to tightness of money there was no demand locally or from purchasers from the opposite Coast, who usually arrive during October to December to do their business. No locusts appeared during the year. C. H. LINCOLN, Major, His Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas. 1st April 1935. bs 213 FP32 CHAPTER V. Administkation Bei-okt f.v His Majesty’s Consulate, Ivekman, foe the year 1034, A .—British Interests. 1 His Majesty's Consulate—Personnel.— C. H. Lincoln, O.B.E, remained in charge of the Consulate throughout the year. Manor Lincoln left for Bandar Abbas, on tour, on the 19th January and returned to Kerman on the 25th March. He proceeded on a short visit to Tehran on the 20th May and returned on the 2nd June. A short visit vas paid to Bandar Abbas, in company with Major Pybus, Military Attache, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, between the 19th and 23rd June. His Majesty’s Consul left for Bandar Abbas, en route to Charbar, on the 26th November, to enquire into the complaints received from certain British subjects at the latter place. 2. Consulate work, etc.—(a) 29 British subjects were registered at the -Consulate during the year, the number for 1933 also being 29. (b) The espionage on the Consulate, which continued during 1931 and 1932 and relaxed in the early part of 1933, was again revived for some time in October 1934, when men of the local Secret Police were seen to he prying round the Consulate and houses of members of the clerical staff. It was again relaxed after His Majesty’s Consul left for Charbar. (c) The King’s Birthday was celebrated in the usual manner on the 4th June. A reception was held in the morning and attended by the Governor- General, his assistant, the Chief of the Municipality, the European community and heads of foreign firms. In the evening a dinner party was given, to which the three Persian officials mentioned above and all members of the European ■colony were invited. The Governor-General was unable to come to the latter function, owing to sudden ill-health, while the Chief of Police was absent on Loth occasions, on the ground of his having been recalled and his relief’s arrival being awaited the same day. (d) Four British Indian motor drivers from Zahidan complained to the Consulate in the month of April that the Police authorities in Kerman had confiscated their driving licences and told them that foreigners were not allowed to work in Persia as motor drivers any more ! The local Chief of Police, who was approached privately by the Consulate, explained that the men had been taken to task not on account of their nationality, but because they had failed to comply with transport regulations. Private enquiries, however, elucidated the fact that the interference by the Police was nothing more, or less, than an attempt to induce the parties concerned to part with a portion of their hire, and, as the complainants eventually proceeded to Yezd without calling at the Consulate again, it was presumed that the matter had ended by an ‘ amicable ’ settlement. (e) An ignorant cultivator incurred the Governor-General’s displeasure in August by lemarking that the bulk of water in a certain under-ground channel had increased through the activities of a former British Consul. The offender, a ei being pi Ol asely abused, was taken to the Government House in a car, hut released alter severe warning. The cnannel in question is the one passing through the Consulate grounds and having been properly repaired by the efforts of Lieut-Colonel E. W. 0. A &gt;el m 1930, is one ol the few that were not affected by the floods of 1932. am1 T„Ef ps ’'g? ta] p u ®? r n in the J’ear to have the Consulate buildiiigs i«m nffito ’ti as le S h mtian cemetery, registered at the local Keg'ista- ie necessary fees were paid and the required formalities tuinE-Ebut the documents for ownership have not been received up to the time of writing. 3. Imperial Bank of Persia and Trade in general. —Mr. J. F. LuttrelL Accountant of the Kerman branch, was transferred to Tehran in the month of April, since when a Persian clerk has been discharging some of the duties of Accountant. Mr. V. H. Glendening, the Manager, proceeded on furlough in May, having heen succeeded by Mr. R. C. Fergussen. Business during the early part of the year was moderately active but diminished gradually during the second half. Trade conditions in this part of the country have never been so bad in recent years and the immediate outlook is far from bright. The carpet industry was greatly affected by the small demand and low prices in America, and towards the close of the year practically no fresh orders were arriving from New York. Until conditions in the carpet business in America improve, there does not appear to be any likelihood of any amelioration in trade conditions, as the Kerman market depends almost entirely on the carpet industry. 4. Church Missionary Society. — {a) General .—The Revd. H. E. J. Biggs continued to discharge the duties of Chaplain throughout the year. No further active interference on the part of the local Police with the Mission’s evangelical work was brought to notice during the year, but the S'ecret Police continued to observe a strict watch on the public services attended by Persian converts. Miss E. Thomas returned from furlough in the early part of October, ■vice Miss J. G. Moore, the C. M. S. evangelist, who proceeded on transfer to Shiraz in September. (b) Boys’ School. —Mr. F. T. B. Snow, assisted by Revd. R. Iliff, remained in charge of the Boys’ school throughout the year. The year under review was the last one in which the school could prepare boys for the Government Primary Certificate, as, according to the regulations of two years ago, the 6th class had to close down at the end of the summer term. A proportion of the boys entered passed. The boys of the 9th class took the C. M. S. English Middle School Certificate and 70 per cent, passed. In the autumn, an eleventh class was opened, so that when the new year began in September, the school consisted of five classes (7th to 11th), with a total number of 69 boys. During the summer holidays the Ministry of Education granted a con cession to the school, officially recognising it and allowing it to have classes up to the end of the Diploma course in class 12. This official recognition also carried with it exemption from military service for all boys in the tenth class and above, until they had taken the Diploma examination. The usual high standard in games and out-door activities was kept up during the year and, though there was not the customary football competition in the town, the school teams did well in their friendly matches during the year. During the summer term the Governor-General was present at the annual inter- house drill competition and expressed satisfaction and admiration at the dis play. Camp was held as usual at the close of the summer term, a party of masters and boys trekked out to Rayin (a large village some 80 miles to the south of Kerman) at the foot of Kuh-i-Hazar (14,500 ft.) which they climbed. In the autumn term a troop of Boy Scouts was formed, quite a large number of boys joining. The school took part, with the ether Kerman schools, in the Firdausi Millenary celebrations. The school only gives the Literary Course, as the Government Middle School gives the science course, so the 11th class opened a Literary and Debating Society, which meets once a week and is very well attended. Also during the winter months once a week a cinema is shewn or a lantern lecture is held. During the autumn, following Government instructions, a new name was chosen for the school, and the old name of Madrasih-Mursalin (Mission School) has been changed to Dabiristan-i-Jam.34 On Hie whole ihc year has been satisfactory, the school is slowly but surely making a name for itself as a Middle School and is regaining the ground lost, when in 1932, the Primary Department was closed. (c) Girls 9 School.—Since the last report several changes have taken place in the school, the most outstanding being that it is now only a Middle school. This has, of course, meant a decrease in numbers, and only between 35 and 40 girls were attending regularly at the end of the year. Miss 1. M. Darlington, who has been in charge since October 1933, is trying to establish an eleventh class, so that the girls may be able to get the recognised Government Diploma before leaving the school. Several expect to take the re quired examination in June. Last year, instead of allowing only those who were up to standard, to enter the sixth class Certificate Examination, all the girls who wished were permitted to take it, and of the seventeen who entered twelve passed. All the four who took the Ninth Class Examination were successful, while of their number came second in all Kerman. In the school programme the Government syllabus is followed as far as possible. Time is also given during school hours for recreation, cooking and sewing. Prayers are held each morning before ^school, and Ethics Classes are given regularly each week. Recently a Scripture Union Class has again been started. Tliis is held every Thursday during lunch hour, and is quite optional. It will be remembered that Miss J. F. Woodroffe, the Head Mistress, left for England in September 1933, in order to complete her B.A. course, without which, according to the new regulations of the Persian Ministry of Education, she could not run her school. Miss Woodroffe is expected to return to Kerman in a short time, when, it is hoped, the school will receive full recognition from the Government. (J) Medical. —Dr. G. E. Dodson, who proceeded on furlough in September, was succeeded by Dr. I. W. Pigott from Isfahan. Dr. (Miss) E. G. Baillie was transferred to Yezd in March and Dr. (Miss) Chans Pigott returned from furlough in May to take charge of the Women’s, Hospital. Miss E. J. Pet ley and Miss M. James discharged the duties of Matron in the Men’s and Women’s Hospitals respectively. Oddy, who was attached to the Medical Mission as Electrician, left on furlough in November and Mr. A. Robertson, formerly of the Indo- Euiopean telegraph Department, rendered valuable services as pathologist and accountant throughout the year. The following statistics show the work 1934 and the three preceding years :—* done in the two hospitals during 1931. 1932. 1933. 1934, Number of in-patients 805 699 782 728 Number of out-patients (new) 5,908 6,429 6,326 6,706 Repeat visits 16,680 21,981 19,767 18,554 City visits ,. 2,125 4,589 2,701 2,347 Major operations ,. 529 - 529 642 638 Pathological Examinations ,, New Gynaecological Examinations ,. ,. ltinerary work : 4 P Iaces v^ited, and about 247 patients seen during the r onen^'a^rldv °f S e Men ’ s Hospital in September, lie h really appreciated in the town. llir0at Po P artmeilt , '’Inch is well attended a: Th' Kn’ott^asldariiPtbe'Knf*'* 118 ! 8 #' 0 ‘t!' 80 in usefulness and numb i V i • ola te&lt; i “ e Kahn test for Syphilis since her return from fnrlouo find finds it an extremely useful aid in diagnosis 'ast incurs!” '' 1 •' Oentre, assisted by Miss M.'

T\vo combined antenatal and post-natal clinics are held weeklv one of which is specially for carpet weavers, and children of all ages attend it. At these meetings pregnant women are seen, and advice is given to mothers. Th ere are twm senior and three junior workers attached to the Welfare Centre, the three juniors have recently commenced their midwifery trainin'-', two workers passed the C. M. S. doctor’s examination (equivalent to C. M. B?) m September 1934 and another was to retake it in January 1935. 5. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited. —The Company’s business m Kerman continued to improve satisfactorily and the Russian stocks of kerosine and petrol v^ere exhausted by the middle of the year. Karly in October Dr. Harris and Mr. Falcon, the Companv's geologists from Abadan, arrived in Kerman and left for- Bam, whence they intended to proceed on survey to Persian Baluchistan and Mekran. After being kept waiting at Bam for many days, however, they were obliged to return to Kerman and leave or Isiahan, as the military authorities refused to furnish the necessary escort owing, apparently, to the disturbances in Persian Baluchistan. Mirza Abdul Hussein Khan Sadri (Seif-ul-Mamalik), the company’s re presentative in Kerman, was succeeded by Mirza Jalil Khan Suhai of Shiraz in the month of October. 6. Carpet Trade, etc. —The exports in Kerman carpets and tribal rugs, expressed in thousands of Rials, during 1934 and the three preceding years, were as follows (The rate of exchange at the end of the year was Rials 84 to £1), 1931. 1932. 1933. 1934. Kerman carpets and rugs .. .. .. 12,079 8,591 11,540 11,751 Tribal rugs .. .. .. .. 888 1,200 930 940 In spite of the above figures, which only show the export side, the period under report v T as the worst known for many years, so far as the carpet industry in itself is concerned. Prices began to fail steadily as the year advanced and the majority of weavers could not get new orders when they had completed their contracts with the various firms. By the end of the year the price of Kerman carpets had come down between 20 to 25 per cent, while the fall in the prices of tribal rugs was even more, compared with those prevailing in the beginning of the year. The proposal for the formation of a company, with a capital of 50 million Rials, for the monopoly of carpet trade, which was discussed at Tehran at the end of December, has fallen through, owing, apparently, to its being considered impracticable. Wool Carding Plant.-Whe machinery for the wool carding plant, ordered - the recently-organised company, called the ‘ Sherkat-i-S.hami arrived irom 213FD36 Bandar Abbas in the beginning of March, but certain parts of the engine having been damaged on the road, the Russian Engineer, who had been sent by the x \ g (| j n Tehran (with whom the contract had been made) to supervise the erection’ of the plant, was unable to proceed with his work, and the A. E. G. were asked to send an electrician to see to the damaged parts. The electrician arrived in the middle of May and the damage, which proved to be of a trivial nature was rectified, the work of erection completed and the machine started functioning in the latter part of June. (Only the engine is of German manu facture all the other machinery having been supplied by G. Josephy’s Erl&gt;en, Bilsko ’Silesia, Poland). On account of the slump in the carpet industry, however the plant has proved to be of little advantage to the Company. 7. Communications and Security. — {a) Communications .—In the beginning of February, Azarnoush, who had been in charge of the Roads Department in the Kerman Area for over a year, was succeeded by Nusratullah Mirza Daulat- dad, who remained in charge of the department until the latter part of August, when he nroceeded to Tehran, and Abul Fatih Khan Muzaffari, the Chief Accountant of the Kerman office, held acting charge for the rest of the year. A new allotment of Rials 500,000 (about £6,000) was sanctioned by the Central Government at the end of March for resumption of work on the Kerman- Shahdad motor alignment via the Sirch pass. The Governor-General had shortly before this submitted a proposal to Tehran, recommending the abandonment of this alignment in favour of one from Kerman to Meshed via Rawar, with which Shahdad could be connected by a branch route. This proposal having been rejected by Tehran, the Korman- Shahdad road, work on which had been stopped since October 1932, was once more taken in hand towards the end of May. The chief reason f.or deciding to go on with this road was said to be the large sums of money already spent thereon—i.e,, about Rials 1,300,000 (about £15,000), including the amount subscribed by the land-owners. However, the work was again stopped at the end of July, as the result of fresh orders from Tehran. In the month of June land-owners and merchants from Rawar formed a company, in conjunction with certain motor transport owners, for the making of a motor road from Kerman to Meshed by the old caravan route via Rawar. The levelling of this alignment was therefore taken in hand and completed as far as Firdaus (Tun) at,the end of October, when the road was reported io be passable by light touring cars. With the exception, however, of a few journeys by light cars, this road has not been used for motor traffic, except as far as Rawar. r J Juy Kerman-Rawar section, it will be remembered, was already passable by light touring cars. , As the result of the Governor-General’s report to Tehran, at the latter part ol tue year, recommending the taking in hand of the above road by the Central Government, with a view to proper metalling of the same, His Excellency lias been instructed to inspect the Kerman-Firdaus section personally and send a more detailed report. A sum of Rials 700,000 (about £8,300) was sanctioned by Tehran, at tl end ot March, for the improvement of the Tang-i-Zagh section of the Kerma andar Abbas motor road, and the work of widening the pass has been going &lt; ever since. It should be remembered that the Tang, which is little more tin &lt; mi e m .(ng b m the cmef difficult section on this road, and often gets block 0 ^her through land slides resulting from heavy rains, ai with los^ 1 of VG llc es met with accidents there, sometimes attendi cases of nottv rndb /'d r&lt;2 ^ C Routes. With the exception of a few isolai out thp m-mbnpo S ’ sec ^ n maintained on all the trade routes throui Kerman 7ddd V ^ ing ^j le disturbances in Baluchistan, however, Kerman-Zahidan road remained unsafe during the last two months of the ye for {Pnundipr aH ^ r0m Afsar tribe, who had been responsi durino- the lost t^V nr C01 ^ mi ^ e d on the Kerman-Bandar Abbas r( qvj fn the militorv onit u- 66 ^ ea 3' s ’ 1 h avin £ been granted amnesty, gave him* up to the military authorities m July and handed in a few rifles.

Several mails between Kerman and Tehran were delayed on account of snow and the consequent blockade of the roads during January and February, and similar interruption occurred in the case of the mail service between Kerman and Bandar Abbas, owing to the Tang-i-Zagh getting blocked, at the latter part of the year, when mails took as long as six days to reach each destination. The mail services between Kerman and the other post offices within the province were on the whole fairly regular. (d) Wireless. —The wireless station in Kerman, though not open to the public, was kept in working order throughout the year and has been used for keeping up regular communications between the military authorities in Kerman and Khwash since the end of November. (e) Aviation .—No aeroplanes have visited Kerman during the last three years, and the two aerodromes situated to the east and N. N. W. of the city (both at a distance of about 5 miles) have remained neglected. B.—Local Government and Politics. 8. Condition of the country. —The maintenance of law and order has continued to improve steadily throughout the province. News regarding the capture by the Government forces of the fort at Muzaijan in Fars, in the beginning of the year, was received with great relief. Rumours at the end of October regarding raids by gangs of Baluchis in the outskirts of the province, and the murder by the raiders of certain camelmen and road-guards, caused considerable alarm. Military detachments were promptly sent out from Kerman and the situa tion was said to be well under control by the end of the year. '1 he only persistent opposition met by the Government troops continues to be in the district of Bashakird, where Abdul Hussein Kamran is still defying the Govern ment authority. Inspectors from the various Government departments visited Kerman during the year and cases of corruption and extortion, when brought to light, were dealt with drastically. 9. Local officials and departments. —His Excellency Mirza Abu) Hassan Khan Peernia continued to hold the post Governor-General. 0 f Q- OV emor-General throughout the year. Though always keen on development schemes^ Peernia has not been able to effect many noteworthy improvements, excepting the construction of a small public park in Kerman and the cutting of new roads through the towns of Rafsinjan and S'irjan. The collection of the town beggars in the winter months, during the last two years, and providing them with free board and lodging, from funds obtained by subscription, is also one of Peernia’s achievements. lie is a man with very good intentions and is remarkably free from corrup tion, his mere presence having a checking influence on the other big officials. Peernia is a man of good presence, polite and fairly polished, and his rela tions with H. M.’s Consulate have always been courteous.38 Muhammad Mirza Arasted (formerly Amir Muhtasham) of Tabriz who has held the post of Assistant Governor-General, Kerman since November 1933, is a pleasant and obliging elderly man, and has always been helpful to this Consulate. Amir Khan Suhrabian (a Persian Armenian from Hamadan) remained in charge of the Revenue office, as Provin- Finance and Revenue. cial Director of Finance, throiurhmit tVin year. The Excise branch of the Finance office having been made an independent department, a new Excise Officer, accompanied by a number of excisemen from Tehran and Isfahan, arrived in Kerman in the middle of May. Among other things, this department had to deal with cases of smuggling goods into the country via Zahidan or Bandar Abbas. Within a few weeks, houses of all classes of the inhabitants had been searched and the least suspected articles were confiscated and the owners prosecuted. The parties concerned, who received the sympathy and support of the interested Finance officials as well as of certain deputies in the Majliss, made representations to Tehran, protesting against the high-handed and arbitrary activities of the new excise officials, with the result that the Excise Officer received instructions from the Finance Ministry, at the end of September, to hand over the charge of the Excise de partment to the chief of the local Monopoly office and proceed to the Capital. Since then, as the result of fresh orders from Tehran, the Excise department lias again been amalgamated with the Finance office. According to instructions received from Tehran in the month of May, a tax of Rials 1-50 per bottle was levied on all the wine prepared in the town, whether for sale or for private use, but wine made in the villages for private and local consumption was to be exempted from taxation. Prompt, but, as it eventually turned out, useless representations were made by members of the Parsi community, drawing attention to the fact that wine was a national beverage, so far as the Zoroastrians were concerned, and should remain free from all taxation. Instances of corruption in the Finance office, though rarely brought to light, are still heard of from time to time, especially amongst the less important officials of the department. Opium.—The Opium harvest being exceptionally poor, the amount of crude opium delivered at the Monopoly go-downs during the year was just over 1,500 Tabriz Mans (each Tabriz Man being equivalent to about 16^ ounces), as compared with 2,000 Mans in 1933. As the drug loses about 25 per cent, of its weight in the process of prepara tion, and as the amount of prepared opium issued to the shop-keepers, etc., for local consumption was approximately about 3,500 Mans, a deficit of 2,375 Mans of prepared opium had to be made up by import from the other provinces. This is besides the quantity used locally from the smuggled stocks, Le., what was withheld by the land-owners as contraband and used or sold for local consumption. It is difficult to arrive at a correct figure, in the absence of statistics, but the amount of contraband opium may be estimated roughly at ^eiy nearly 100 per cent, of what was actually handed over to the Monopoly Department. An extra tax of one Shahi per miskal (about Rials 0.30 per oz.) was inti 1!!!«l‘ I 1 ? he A e £T U ?§, 0f JuI 5\ brm ging the total tax up to Rials 0.55 r miskal (about Rials 3.30 per oz.). l^twoon T^ es i?n ld ^ y onn e Mo m 0 ?°! y I)e P artm ent for crude opium rang between Rials 180 and 200 per Tabriz Man. the year 10 ^ ^ n ° smu S'ghng from the other provinces nor any exports duri province lmm ' ,CI °* 'T 1 ' 1 ™ addicts is said to be on the whole increasing in t Mr. Joseph Bahoshi remained in charge of the Bank until the end of Jui National Bank of Persia. wdien he w T as relieved by Herr Alin accountant of the Kerman Branch cfN ^tter, who had be mained in charge for the rest of theVear. 1 ^^ ' * few months in 1931 &gt; 139 rely tar elessiffi the mi [imp ut ress of 0 eepers,® 1 - sports [«(€ As could be expected under the present circumstances, the National Bank of Persia handled the bulk of business in Kerman during the year.

A branch office was also opened in the town of Bahramabad for the Rafsinjan district. Permission was received by the local Registration authorities in the month of March to collect the Registration fees in three instalments in cases where the parties concerned were unable to make full payment in advance, in suite of this and the fact that the periods allowed for the registration of the various areas were extended several times, the majority of the houses and estates sf” remain unregistered and have therefore had to be declared 4 ownerless ’ pj the cases where the fees have been duly paid, no documents of ownership have been received from Tehran up to the time of writing. The Director-General of Registration paid a visit of inspection to Kerman in the month of May. As the result of representations made to Tehran on behalf of the local editors, permission was received early in the year to make arrangement with the local newspapers for the publication of notices in respect of registration of property in the province, excluding the property situated in the' first area the Kerman city, the contract for which had already been given to the editor ot bitareh-Jehan ’ in Tehran. througW ihe a ™ ained “ Charge ° f fte P ° St and Tele « ra P h Department The delivery arrangements, both of mails and telegrams, were on the whole hosts and Telegraphs. satisfactory and punctual than heforp ha win &lt;*• , i i . . ^ mix mat, mail on the road on accoont of rain, etc. ’ ng When Were heId U P ImlHhU wLe ° n % that the oflicial in charge of the Post Office is particularlfefficlent in h^ work' 11 Fara-Vashi (Mutarjim Hnmaynn), Principal of the Pehlevi Middle School Education.

' pia ^ eih &gt; All students of the Middle Schools in Kerman were called upon to register their names at the Military School for the training of the N. C. Ods on the 24th December, since when they have been attending parades on certain davs of the week. The J J arsi National School were_ able to continue their first two middle classes (7th and 8th) through charitable help received from Bombay Mrs Jehangir Mehta, sister of the late Sir Dinshah Petit, who visited Kerman in October, subscribed Bs. 6,000, to he utilised during three years, at the rate of Ks. 2,000 a year, for the addition of a 9th class to the Parsi National School and the introduction of a special class to teach religious matter to the pupils in a second Zoroastrain School at Kerman. Mrs. Mehta promised to have the two classes inspected on the expiry of the three years, with a view to making arrangement for the continuance of the subscription, if the result should prove to be satisfactory. 1 Naib Sarhang Khajoui, who relieved Naib Sarhang Tumaj, as Officer Com- Amniek manding Amnieh (Road-guards) in Ker- man, at the end of January, remained in charge until the end of the year. Three outlaws from the Buchaqchi tribe were captured by the Amnieh authorities and brought to Kerman for trial at the end of August. Complaints against some of the Amnieh officers and N. C. O.’s stationed on the various outposts in the province, for corruption and extortion, are still heard of from time to time. Mirza Ghaffar Khan Vaziri held the post of Chief of the Municipality Municipality. Kerman until the beginning of June when he was transferred to Qum and Mirza Ibrahim Khan Ibrahimi, Municipality Accountant, held temporary charge until relieved by Jabiri from Qum in the middle of July. Jabiri was in charge for the rest of the vear. Fresh Municipal elections were held at the end of January, when Mirza Lutfalj Khan Vakiii, one of the leading notables, who had been President of the Municipal Council in Kerman since June 1932, was replaced by Sayyed Muham mad Hashimi, editor of the local weekly newspaper “ Bidari &gt; As the result of a recommendation by the Commission of Enquiry, who arrived in Kerman at the end of October 1933 and left for Bandar Abbas in January 1934, the Governor-General arranged for an assessment of the con struction ^work carried out by Kazimi, the ea?-Governor-General, in the Municipal area of Kerman, in order to obtain a rough idea of the amount of expenditure. No authentic information could he obtained in this matter, but it was believed that a considerable amount of Municipality funds had been embezzled by the officials in charge. The Governor-General put into effect an old project, started by him during his previous term of office in Kerman, to turn an old parade ground, situated near the Government House and measuring some 35,000 sq. yards, into a public park. The place was dug up in February, flower beds were prepared and a large number of young trees planted. Work on the big circus and new roads in the town was resumed in April and continued on a small scale during summer. Water from three different channels was rented by the Municipality during the year for the irrigation of the various avenues in the Kerman town. New, and for the most part increased, rates of Municipal taxation, on articles of food-stuff entering Kerman city, came into force with effect from the 6 th August, The proceeds of the new taxes were expected to exceed KiMs 500,UOO bout £6,000) in the year, but the amount received 10 made their own arrangements tor co ee ion, i Municinal Council ire than one-fifth of the above estimate. ^Proposals by ^e Mumc p C let out the monopoly for this taxation bout £4,250) a year were not approved of by the Ministry ol in e o -42 The Council succeeded, however, in obtaining permission to appoint their own men to collect the taxes, as an experiment, for a Period of ten days, during which time the total receipts were about Rials 18,000. At this rate the yearly receipts would amount to Rials 648,000 (about £7,700). Since then the amount of taxes collected by, and received through, the Finance Office has increased hnt so much as to satisfy the Council. The chief improvement achieved by the Municipality during the year was the construction of a new slaughter house at a distance of two miles from tfie city. As the result of a report sent to Tehran by the present Governor-General, instructions were received from the Ministry of Interior in the beginning of Julv to cancel the agreement made in 1932 between the local authorities and the Electric Ltoht Factory, in connection with the supply of electric light to _the Municipal area, on the ground that the agreement had been drawn up in such a way as to overlook the'interests of the Municipal department. To arrive at a compromise' it was suggested to make certain modifications in the terms, the most important of which was the reduction of the period from ten to live years. The Factory did not consent to any alterations and threatened to close down the Factorv. On the other hand, a sum of some Rials 100,000 which was due to the Factory by the Municipality was withheld at the suggestion of the Governor- General to induce the Factorv to agree to the new terms. As the result of private intervention by the Officer Commanding, Kerman Brigade, however, the Governor-General eventually adopted a more lenient attitude, and the matter was dropped for the time being. The fruit trees in the province suffered considerable damage through unusual hard frosts in early spring, as the result of which fruit of all kind was scarce during summer. The out- Agriculture. turn of wheat and barley was again below normal, due to the fact that many under-ground water channels which had been damaged by the floods in 1933 were still out of course. In August the Governor-General sent a report to Tehran on the unsatisfactory irrigation conditions prevailing in Kerman, due, among other things, to the inability of the land-owners to repair the above-mentioned channels. His Excellency sub mitted a proposal by which the work of reparation could be successfully taken in hand, if the Central Government could help by sanctioning a loan, from the National Bank or other sources, of ten million Rials, to be paid back with in terest within a certain number of years. The last thing heard on this subject was that the proposal had been forwarded to the Bank of Agriculture, who would reply direct after examining the details. The year was a record one so far as the pistachio crop was concerned, the total out-turn, in the province having been estimated at between 400,000 and 500,000 Tabriz Mans (each Tabriz Man being equivalent to about 16v ounces), and the prices ranged between Rials 16 to 18 for the ‘ fair average quality ’. The pistachio nut having proved to he one of the most valuable articles of export, great efforts are being made by land-owners to extend the cultivation of the tree in the province. Orders were received from Tehran early in the year that, in future, cultiva tion of rice was to he restricted to certain districts in Gilan and Mazandaran. As a considerable amount of rice has always been cultivated in the warmer dis tricts of this province, and in Jiruft in particular, the land-owners concerned have kept^on making representations through the local authorities, inviting attention to the losses which would be sustained by them if they stopped rice cultivation altogether. Instructions were therefore received at the end of the year permitting the continuance of rice cultivation under certain conditions. Henna has for many years past been the chief article of cultivation in the districts ol Bam and Narmashir, the yearly crop amounting on an average to over one million Rials. The demand for this commodity has decreased steadily during recent years, as the result of cessation of export to Russia and decreased consumption in I cisia, and land-owners have decided to reduce the amount of cultivation. The only substitute suggested so far is the indigo plant, w r hich could be grown satisfactorily under the same conditions. The question has led to a project of i e\ iving the old indigo industry in the province on modern lines. The matter has been taken up by the present Governor-General since his arrival in Kerman, and negotiations have been going on with the leading Persian traders in Bombay, •tyitli a view to obtaining information on the subject from India. Arrangements are now being made for the engagement of an expert from India and the formation of a small company, with a capital of Rials 120,000 (about £1,500) whose headquarters will be at Bam, the biggest town in the chief indigo producing district of the province. The question of the establishment of an agricultural farm in Kerman is still under consideration and the Governor-General, has again sent a proposal to Tehran on this subject. Locusts .—According to information received in June, swarms of young locusts were seen in the vicinity of Sirjan, some 150 miles to the south east of Kerman, at the latter part of May, but no information could be obtained as to when and where they have been hatched. Steps were taken by the local authorities and land-owners to destroy the insects before they could fly and a large number were thus destroyed. The information reached this Consulate a little too late and steps taken to procure samples of the insects proved of no avail, nor could any reliable details be obtained regarding the species, as the locusts had completely disappeared by the middle of June, without causing any serious damage to the crops. The direction eventually taken by these locusts was variably stated as north and north-west. The above was the only incident brought to notice regarding visitation ot locusts in the Kerman province. Murtaza Mirza Qahramani, Chief Census Officer for Kerman and Persian Baluchistan, returned from Iranshahr at the end of January and proceeded to ... Tehran in the beginning of February. Srjill-i-AhwaL having been suspended by Tehran because he had left Khwash without waiting for the receipt of permission from the Central Census Administration. Ni’matullah Mirza Kamran (Mu’tasim-ul-Mulk) arrived from Isfahan and took charge of the Census Department early in February, since when he has held the post of Census Officer for this area (Kerman and Persian Baluchistan). Kamran proceeded to Khwash in the middle of February, in connection with the establishment of Census Offices in Persian Baluchistan, and returned in the middle of April. One office was opened at Khwash and other one at Sarawan during the year. Acting upon instructions from Tehran, men from the local Census Depart ment started visiting the houses in Kerman in February, with a view to detect ing personss who had so far failed to obtain identity papers. The cotal number of identity papers issued to the inhabitants of Kerman city and envlions up to date is said to be just over 45,000. At the end of October the Census Officer left for Bandar Abbas cn route to Charbar, to establish an office at the latter place, and returned to Kerman in the beginning of February 19o5. The majority of the inhabitants of Charbar were forced to obtain identity papers, including a number of British subjects, some of whom were m possession of British passports, while others had applied for renunciation* oi ersian Nationality. This gave rise to the complaints received by the Political Resi dent and His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, as the result of which His Majesty s Consul received orders to proceed to Charbar at the latter pait o i ovem e . A large number of the inhabitants, including some of those who had applied for permission to retain British nationality, fled to Gwadur and othei places British Baluchistan, on the arrival of the Census Officer at Charbar, m ordei to avoid being forced into taking Persian nationality papers. 10. Local Politics.— Since the anniversary of the Martyrdom of Ah, m the early part of January, the observance of Triday holidays b} the local -h P keepers, including non-Muhammadans, has been strictly enforced by me Ion , authorities. The Muharram ceremonies in the latter part of April passed off quietly, and the processions were less elaborate than m the previous year. Ls2J3FPTelegraphic representations bv certain Bahais at Sirjan were made to Tehran in Mav, complaining against the anti-Bahai utterances of one Sultan-ul- Wa’izin a preacher from Kermanshah. The Ministry of Interior, while making it clear in their reply that the State did not recognise any Bahai community in th e country referred the matter to the Governor-General, who proceeded to Siri'an with’the Chief of Police, and, after going into the case, sent the preacher to Kerman, having taken a written guarantee from him not to preach again until final orders about him were received from Tehran. According to orders received from Tehran at the latter part of November, the meeting place of the Bahais in Kerman, called Mashriq-ul-Azkar, was closed by the Police authorities and the leader of the community made to sign an under taking not to attend any meetings without informing the Police. This action on behalf of the Government is said to have been due to the Bahais in Tehran and Yezd insisting on the observance of Bahai holidays in their schools, contrary to the regulations laid down by the Ministry of Education, which resulted in the closing down of the schools concerned. The Governor-General celebrated the anniversary of the Shah’s Birthday mil the 24th March by holding a reception at the Government House in the after noon, invitations to which were, as in the previous year, issued by the Kerman Municipality. The reception ended at about 8 p.m. after the usual tire-works, and was followed by a ‘ joy caravan ’ procession, conducted for the first time in Kerman under the auspices of the local Military authorities. Illuminations were also held at the Military and Amnieh headquarters as well as in the main bazaars, where, in many cases, the shop-keepers were forced by the Police to increase the number of their lamps. A private theatrical show, called ‘ Sarbaz-i-Vatan ’ (A Soldier of the Fatherland) was given on the same night by the Military autho rities, to which only a selected few were invited. The Millenary Birthday anniversary of the Poet Firdausi was celebrated in Kerman throughout the week ending with the 12th October. There were illuminations in the town and receptions given by the merchants, the Parsi com munity, the Military Department and the Municipality, the latter including a display of tire-works. The Military gave a theatrical performance, depicting the Poet’s life. His Majesty’s Consul received invitations to, and was present at, all the functions. Apropos of the Shah’s return from Turkey, a Garden party was given by the Governor General, on behalf of the Municipality, on the 6th of July, followed by illuminations in the bazaars on the 7th and 8th. The four local weekly newspapers are now being published more regularly than before, as they have made contract- with the Registration Office to print Press notices in connection with the registra- ‘ ' of property in the province. A new monthly periodical, called the ‘ Aftab-i-Snarq ’ (Sun of the East), was started early in the year by Majd-i-Nawabi, a preacher from Bam. With the excep tion of one or two reminiscences in connection with the late South Persia Rifles, no anti-British articles appeared in the press during the year. Hashimi, the editor of the local weekly paper ‘ Bidari ’ which was at one time inclined to he anti-British, has lately adopted a decidedly friendly attitude, lie is at present President of the Kerman Municipal Council and, being a noted Arabic Scholar, has been engaged as a part-time teacher in the C. M. S. Boys’ School, where one of his brothers is a permanent teacher. 11. Health and General Welfare. —Dr. Suhrab Barkhurdarian remained in cnaige ot the Health Services in the province throughout the year. Some type of 1 F lue in an epidemic form, raged in Kerman in the early part ot the year, causing a number of deaths. ihoie vas another small epidemic of Tvphus in the summer, mainlv con- tmed to the Jewish quarter and one other part of the town, in many houses 4 or o peisons^ being ill at the same time.

He protested that the consignment had been sent to him without his knowledge or consent, and, in spite of the fact that he had already expressed his unwillingness to handle any more Soviet goods. A third party volunteered eventually to dispose of the consignment, most of which was bought for use in the recentlv-erected wool carding factory in Kerman. A local trader who attempted to sell Russian kerosine in small A. P. 0. C. tins was prosecuted by the Company’s representative in Kerman, at the latter pait of the year, and found guilty by the local courts. It is hoped that the incident wdl put a stop to further similar encroachments on the Company's rights. 13. Military and Conscription .—Sarliang Muhammad Khan Maimand held the post of Commanding Officer of the Kerman Independent Brigade through out the year. He proceeded on leave to Tehran on the 20th March and returned at the end of July, during which time Naib Sarhang All Khan Muhajir, Conn manduut of the Razmjoo (Infantry) Regiment, held acting charge of the Brigade. I he Officer Commanding gave a Garden Party, with fire-works and illumina tions, on the evening of the 21st February, to celebrate the anniversary of the Coup d’Etat, and a military display on the parade ground on the following morning. The latter show, which consisted of gymnastics, drill, mounted exer cise and some artillery practice, was a great success and reflected credit on the military authorities in Kerman, According to unconfirmed news emanating from the military barracks, the status of the Kerman Brigade was to be raised to that of an Army in the near future. The constructions of new and more extensive cavalry barracks and Officers’ Club being under consideration, several plans were submitted to Tehran during the year, of which one is said to have been approved. Conscription .—Naib Sarhang Farajullah Khan Mnshar remained in charge of the Conscription Department throughout the year. While he was on leave to Tehran between the end of August 1934 and middle of March 1935, Yawar Mu'izzi held acting charge. More activity was shown by the Military authorities in hunting after absentee recruits' and enquiring into cases of exemption on account oi* medical unfitness and on other grounds. Three lots of recruits, numbering about 250 in all, were brought in from Yezd at the latter part of the year. 14. Persian Baluchistan and Rudbar .—Exaggerated news about the rising by Baluch outlaws was received at Kerman at the end of October, when gangs of Baluchis were said to be making raids into the districts of Kashit, situated to the south of Shahdad, along the western borders of the Lut, One military detachment was promptly sent out from Kerman at the end of October and a second one in the beginning of March.

C. H. LINCOLN, Major, His Majesty's Consul, Kerman. British Consulate, Kerman, The 1st June 1935.47 ; CHAPTER VI. Administration Report of the Kuwait Political Agency for the year 1934 . I.— Personal. (a) Lt-Colonel H. R. P. Dickson, C.I.E., I.A., held charge of the Political Agency throughout the year under review, except for the period 16th June to 16th October when Major R. P. Watts, I.A., held charge, (b) Assistant Surgeon A. L. Greenway, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., was in medical charge of the Charitable Dispensary and performed the duties of Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year. II .—The Ruling Family. (a) For a historical survey of the State of Kuwait, previous Administra tion Reports should he consulted as space does not permit of this being done here. (b) The Ruler His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir al Subah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., has managed his State during the year under review with his usual ability and success, and as time goes on tends more and more to copy the methods and policy of his famous grandfather, Shaikh Mubarak al Subah, who, it has been justly said, possessed one of the shrewdest political brains the Middle East has ever produced. (c) The Shaikh has maintained correct and friendly official relations with his two powerful neighbours, the Kingdom of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, lying to the North and South of his Kingdom respectively, in spite of the uncompromiz ing attitude of the former in the matter of the Al Subah Date Gardens on the Shatt al Arab and their so called anti-smuggling policy and the steadily main- tamed land Blockade by the forces of H. M. King Bin Sand. III .—The Political Agent’s Relations ivith the Shaikh. {a) The relations between H. M.’s Political Agent and the Ruler, as in previous years, have continued to be of a most cordial and satisfactory nature, and the friendly liaison existing between them has been as near perfection as could be desired. This has been especially noticeable in matters connected wit h Kuwait’s foreign relations, where the Ruler has more and more shown a keen desire to keep touch with and consult the Political Agent in any matter that might eventually involve His Majesty’s Government. {b) In the internal administration of the Town and State, the Politica 1 Agent has continued to interfere as little as possible, though this has not neces- sarilv meant his losing touch of events. This policy has and continues to w oi k well, for the Ruler is flattered and pleased to think that he is being allowed to ii run his own show ” 'without undue interference (a very big thing m the e&gt;es of the proud Arab) and at the same time he is astute enough to know that u would have no chance alone, against the clever politicians of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and so is ever ready to discuss and seek advice in his relations w ith these States. ; ■ 1 TV .—Local Interests. (a) Customs.—1. A full report on the imports and r 11 he found in the “ Kuwait Trade Report , a non-eonfidential puUicat . 2. The Director of Customs, Yusuf bin Jassim al Yacub, continues to d&lt;. tisfactory work and to enjoy the full confidence -p a 3. In actual practice the Ruler runs his own infining himself to checking and auditing of acconn s ’ 7 , | }• p re 0 f locked, would show even greater shrinkage than has been the case m the scade. 5isttid7nd s'till d^exist^man^of^he^haikli’sdosesf relatives,^ mt^for fver Insearch of wavs and means to make life easier, and the one Revenue receiving- department in the State is the obvious one to try and “ milk 5. Before the Shaikh took direct charge of affairs, there is no doubt that a great deal of unnecessary leakage took place, mainl\ as a result of persons in high places, bringing undue pressure to bear on the Director of Customs. It was this, and the Shaikh’s knowledge that it was next to impossible for one of his subjects however honest to resist the daily importunities of members of the Royal family, that mainly decided him to get rid of K. B. Abdul Latif bin Abdul Jalil, his’late Director of Customs in 1930. (P fppg import tax on goods entering Kuwait, has remained at 4 pei cent. ad valorem, which as in the case of Bahrain, Dabai, etc., tends to attract trade away from Saudi Arabian Ports, Persia and Iraq-much to the disgust of those States, who apparently believe in the policy that Customs ’ should be the principal revenue producing department of the State, and would theietore like the Arab States of the Gulf to follow in their footsteps, and so become economi cally dependent on them. {b) Municipality. —1. During the year the Town lost the services of the able and energetic Municipal Secretary, Sulaiman al Adsani. It vas thought wise that fresh blood should be brought in and though the electors voted for their old Secretary, the Ruler, perhaps wisely, decided that Nusf bin Yusuf bin Nusf, another active member of the Municipality should try his hand at “ run ning ” the Town. The new Secretary has shown excellent zeal and tact, and has continued to keep the Town clean. 2. During July and August, and feeling perhaps that he had to prove his “ mettle *’ and worth, the new Secretary with the support of the Ruler, cut a wide straight road from East to West of the Town. It was named “ Sikat Pasman This new road undoubtedly is of benefit to all. Generous compensa tion was paid to householders whose houses had to go. 3. Kuwait Electric Supply Co., which was born on. 18th December 1933, and which “ wiseacres ” ever ready to disparage, thought would not turn out a success, lias gone on from strength to strength, and to-day has persuaded almost every householder and shopkeeper of any standing in the Town to take m current. The cost per unit sold remains at 6 annas. A fresh high powered engine has recently been ordered from England, which with the two in existence, should meet all future needs. The new engine will, it is hoped, arrive in the Spring of 1935. 4. Application has been made to the Government of India for sanction to take current from the Kuwait Electric Supply Co. for the new Agency is hoped to receive a favourable reply soon. 5. Kuwait still remains “ dry ” nor will the Ruler to his credit tolerate for one moment any such Western ideas as “Cinemas ” or “ Theatres ’ 5 wine have done so much to demoralize certain post-war Arab States in the Middle East. Shaikh Sir Ahmad has shown great wisdom in this respect and continues to receive the fullest sympathy and support of the Political Agent in any ideas or measures tending 'to keep “ drink ”, “ gambling ” or “ demoralizing influences ” out of the Town. There is no doubt whatsoever that the young Arab in the process of “ growing up ” cannot stand “ new wine in old bottles . This especially refers lo the menace of alchohol. The present Ruler sees the danger ahead, especially with the advent of “ Oil ”, and is determined to prevent his people “ going wrong ” in this res- pect. . .. . (c) Imperial Airways, Ltd.- —1. Kuwait is now a regular port of call for Imperial Airways aircraft, and both Eastbound and Westbound mail and pas senger carrying machines maintained a “ fairly^ satisfactory ” service during the year under review. 2. One uses the words “ faily satisfactory ”, as unfortunately there seems to be a tendency for certain pilots, to fly r over the Town without stopping, on the smallest pretext, such as when running late, or if visibility is not of the best, 3. One realizes of course that the distance between Kuwait and Basra is very short (100 miles), and naturally pilots engaged in long distance flying and49 ' serving great eomtnes like India and Australia must look upon it 8S a some what irksome duty to have to come down at Kuwait. There is however always the political aspect ol the case to be thought of. The Shaikh of Kuwait was not out to get his toOO a year only when he signed the Civil Air Agreement park in the year, but was thinking oi his people’s interests as well. His view is that the Company contracted for a fixed sum of money to do their best to call at his State regulaily, with their aircraft. They have however during 1934 shown a rather unfortunate tendency to want to cut Kuwait out. This makes the Shaikh think he is not being treated quite fairly. The question is beirm dealt with under separate report. 4. On the oilier hand it is satisfactory to record, as one writes this report that imperial Airways have inaugurated a bi-weekly service to and from the East as from 1st January 1935. 5. The Civil Agreement officially known as “ The Agreement for the Regu lation and Control of Civil Aircraft ” was signed bv the Political Auent and the Shaikh on the 23rd May 1934. By an exchange of letters the privileges of Royal Air Force aircraft were confirmed. (d) B'Ait Building. —t. A note on the number, tonnage, etc., of boats built during the year will be found in the Trade Report for 1934. 2. Speaking generally the boat building industry was stagnant in 1934. This being almost entirely due to the continued depression in the pearl trade. For instance out of some 700 pearl boats which are able to go to sea, only 277 .actually went to the “ hanks ”. The remainder were laid up and kept in repair. 3. Two interesting “ contracts ” were however given to Kuwait in the shipbuilding line during 1934, which helped the local industry not a little ; (a) The Iraq Government ordered the pontoons for the new boat bridge at Amara to be built in Kuwait. (b) The Basra Port Trust ordered a specially designed dhow, for the use of the Iraq Customs Police service. This latter on completion will, it is understood, be lined near the water line with steel plates as a protection against rifle fire. (e) Pearl JScuson. —1. One has to again record with regret that, this staple and practically only industry of Kuwait, was once again a failure in 1934. 2. The sail-making and shark oil industry which goes with boat building, was similarly sympathetically affected. 3. The attenuated pearl fleet put to sea between 3rd May and 25th May (Rakba), and returned from the banks on 27th September, when as usual the Ruler proceeded to the banks and gave the signal for the fleet’s return by firing a gun salvo from his yacht. 4. As usual “ scurvy ” made its appearance among the divers, but apparently not in such bad form as on previous occasions. Neither Captains nor Ruler appear to recognise the wastage of man power which results from the dread disease. But then the Arab places small value on human life. 5. It is interesting to record that several hundred Iraqi tribesmen as v ell as an even larger quota from Saudi Arabia came down to Kuwait to try thoi? luck on the annual dive. (/) Poverty in the Town of Kuwait.—1. This was once again a feature of the Town’s life during 1934, and must be attributed to the continued “ Blockade ” by Bin Sand, the “ depressed ” pearl trade of the last live years, and general world conditions. 2. The Ruler continued throughout the year to give one square meal a day to the “ down and out 3. The signing bv the Shaikh of the “ Oil ” Agreement on 23rd December 14, was received with great rejoicing by the “ out of work elements in the •wn and the writer was for a time besieged by scores of Bednom asking . l ea •rk was going to be started by the Kuwait Oil Company. 1 here is little doubt, • • p +Vn DU Ap-reement was hastened by the Shaikh’s know- LTople aVdbnoritspecially Ms “ unemployed ” population were Sfng reXs, over the prolonged negotiations. ^ c+aiA nf 'Kuwait’s population, and the lack of 4.

The King Emperor’s Birthday.-I H M. birthday ''as celebrated in Kuwait in appropriate style on 3rd June 19,4. 2 According lo his custom the Ruler declared a public holiday, and both The Union Jack and the Kuwait Standard were flown side by side on the flagstaff and over the Shaikh’s palace. Both flagstaff* were fully dressed. ,, 1 3. All Arab shipping hoisted flags by order of the Ruler, and generally tr.e Town looked gay with hunting. 4r The Political Agent’s annual banquet was dispensed with as he was about to leave for the United Kingdom on leave, and the house was m disor ganized state. A reception was held instead. (/ c ) IT. E. the Viceroy ’,9 Visit. —1. His Excellency the Viceroy of India accompanied by Badv AViDingdon passed through Kuwait by air airoutr h L ondon on 17th May.* It had been previously arranged that the aircraft conven ing their Excellencies should stop for half an hour, that H. M. K ‘ ^ )we y should fire a salute on their Excellencies arrival and that the Piuler sliomd given an opportunity of meeting their Excellencies. 2. The Shaikh accordingly was on the aerodrome when the aircraft arm«i, and assisted by the Political Agent, leading members of the local Roy^rann w and principal merchants of the city., gave their Excellencies a true Arab wc - come. 3. Their Excellencies on alighting were taken to the aerodrome shed wide had been suitably decorated and carpeted, and an address of welcome irom X Shaikh was read. After refreshments and coffee and a short informal sp by the Viceroy, the party left again at 1 p.m. Note. —Their Excellencies again stopped at Kuwait on their journey from London by air, hut by previous request the i n reception was entirely informal. V .—Condition of the Country. L This was all that could be desired, and law, order, fiave reigned everywhere in the hinterland, throughout 1934. and S 1 '-! 2 iirity2. There were no Bedouin incidents worth recording such as raids, etc. 3. On the other hand lack of rain in North Hassa and Kuwait rendered the grazing pi aspects ioi the summer of 1934 very gloomy The sitn-iHe greatly aggfavated by the sudden influx from slul Arlia ^,e g ^ AwaS tribe into Kuwait as well as ot strong details of the Muteir, Ban Kh^kl Shammar, Rashaida, Adwan and Zab tribes. ivnana, 4. These new arrivals with their enormous herds of camels literally spread clT be found Wer 0 6 C ° Untry Sid6 a “ d ate 'P everything that 5. Actually the new arrivals entered Kuwait partly because lack of grazing drove them to look for fresh pastures, but mainly because it was anticipated that Bin tSaud woula be beaten m the lemen, and as chaos and raiding would then be the order ot the day, those having large camel herds hoped to get protection and sal el &gt; within the Kuwait borders. 6. The above unwelcome visitors left Kuwait in May and June but no grazing remained for the Kuwait nomads with the result that there was a very serious grazing famine in the Summer and Autumn of 1934. The like had not been seen for years, it was $aid. 7. At a conservative estimate some 1,000 Kuwait camels perished of starvation, several hundred others gave premature birth to still born calves, and some 5,000 sheep died. 8. Those few who could afford it, kept their animals alive on barley, hut the poorer class of bedouin owning 3 or 4 camels and a dozen sheep apiece, lost nearly all their stock. 9. Relief came in November with the advent of the rainy season, but as grass only came np in December and then very sparsely, due to the cold, one may say that the drought (dhar) only ended with the close of the. year. Note .—As one writes tills, the conditon of both camels and sheep has once more returned to normal, though the lambing season has been a poor one due to the fact that most of the males died off in the early period of the drought. VI.— Relations with Bin Sand. 1. These have been uniformly good throughout the year, if we except the Blockade'’, which has been maintained closely and steadily throughout 19o4. 2. The “ Blockade ” staff however have shown less strictness than usual, probably ov/ing to the fact that the Temen War drained the noi thorn maicues of men, and the large influx of Nojd tribesmen into Kuwait teiritory lendoied the watching' of the long Kuwait frontier a matter of some difficult}. 3. The Yemen-Rin Sand war naturally was the main topic of interest m Kuwait during the first half of 1934. The general opinion, when the news got round that Bin Sand, had decided on hostilities, was that the King had for once in a while bitten oh moie l.nan he could chew ” It was clearly a case of the “ whale trying to fight the canud , said everyone, and if anyone was going to come off best, it would be . lm&lt; Yahya, was the general opinion. The latter was looked upon as the more cun ning leader of the two, and his decision to await attack appeared to this. . 17 L li!G J Tp ll fhe^freedom from control which they longed “r ^e^ToYr^conCd mostly to the tribes of inner Nejd, Aridh. Hauta and Kharj) were from the first despondent and tl ut their Ruler had embarked on an adventure from which he must come heavily damaged if not actually beaten. 5. Throughout Nejd therefore there t’hcre muring or the one side, and great hope anc AA } )a ttle early in the War is little doubt that had the King been beaten m a pitched battle eai.y .» ks213FDthe- whole of his Northern tribes from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf would have “ gone up 6 As usual however the Bedouin tribes could not co-operate, and each wanted to wait and see what would happen in the South before deciding on any thing. 7 Bin Sand sizing up the situation exactly, and haring his fingoi on the mdse of his tribes as ever, acted in masterly fashion, when he saw that his rush down the coast to Kodeida had not succeeded in bluffing Yahya into swing for peace. He declared himself anxious to end the bloodshed between the “ Musalmeen ” and ottered generous peace terms to Yemen. 8 Bin Sand succeeded in impressing the world with his magnanimity, but in no wise did he deceive his own people or tribes, who one and all recognized that in doing as he did, he had saved himself and the house of Sand from .disaster. 9. Once again had the luck (hath) of the King come to his rescue. 10. The Shaikh of Kuwait, who would have liked to have seen Bin Saud suffer a mild defeat or as he put it “ have some of the wind taken out of Ms head ” was not a little relieved that complete disaster had not overtaken tlm Kino*’s armies. For like everyone else in North East Arabia, he firmly believed that 'Bin Sand’s distant adventure was leading him straight to destruction. 11 In this connection it should never be forgotten, that although Kuwait hates Bin Saud for his local anti-Kuwait “ Blockade measures ”, she yet admires and looks up to him, as the great champion of the Musalmeen in the world todav. In particular is he admired for the way he deals with the Euro pean powers, and keeps them all wooing him, yet never letting them get to near or too familiar. He is a second “ Saladin ” for the Arabs todaw VII .—Relations with Iraq. 1. Officially these have been correct throughout the year, though unfortu nately the dlst of December 1924 saw the famous “ Date Gardens question” still unsettled. One still hopes however that 1935 will see the end of the sad business which has done so much to acerbate Kuwa't feeling against her northern neighbour and to strain her old loyal and affectionate feeling for the British connection to near breaking point. Full details and reports on the measures and counter measures taken by both sides in the light for these gardens will be found elsewhere. 2. 1934 saw also the second “ big push ” of the Iraq Government (in their political campaign against Kuwait) develop and come to a head. One refers to their “ anti-smuggling ” attack. Briefly, Iraq, following the lead of Persia, had raised her sea Customs tariff to such a dizzy height that smuggling was bound to occur on all her borders. Kuwait with her low Customs tariff, fixed many y-ears ago, to enable her to compete with Bahrain, Dabai, etc., in the common and natural desire to sup ply the Bedouin world of Arabia with their wants, naturally became a cheap and sought-after market for the Iraq nomad population. These latter financed and assisted by the river tribes of the Euphrates had found it clearlv to their advantage during the existing hard times, to come down to Kuwait and do their shopping. 3. Iraq took objection to this and reouested Kuwait to prevent her tribesmen entering Kuwait territory, or failing this, to accept an official (&gt; whose pay would come from Iraq) to act as her Customs Director, whose busi ness, among others, would be to fix a tfhde quota of imports sufficient for the needs of the Kuwait population. 4. Kuwait’s reply is that, she has just as much right to try and develop her small and meagre trade with the outside world as her big neighbour has, and that to accede to Iraq’s request even if it were possible to do so, would l&gt; e tantamount to asking her to commit political suicide. o. Clearly Iraq’s honest and only course is to place a line of Customs posts on her frontier, and by a system of tribal and police patrols to herself stop the53 contrabandists’ activities. Why, says Kuwait, should she “ be left with Iraq’s baby ” or why should she “ poke out her eye with her own finger 6. Kuwait further argues that she has no local industries, except the pearl trade which since five years has gone. Nor does she manufacture anything or grow her food. Unless she can sell something to somebody, she can get no money to buy even her food and clothes, which all come from India. 7. Bin Saud’s “ blockade ” has reduced her Customs revenue from 13 lacs to 1 lac of Kupees in 10 years, Persia refuses to trade legitimately with Kuwait, and now Iraq requests Kuwait to stop her trade with the hinterland tribesmen. What, she says, will be left of her trade and how is she to make the money necessary to pay for her food from overseas. 8. Both sides naturally have something to be said for them, but in the writer’s view the Kuwait arguments easily win, since Kuwait’s very existence is at stake. Iraq’s existence is on the contrary in no way threatened, also she is rich, and almost entirely self-supporting. 9. Qn 5th May 1934 four Iraq armoured cars entered Kuwait territory and for some 10 days roamed about beating and frightening the nomad population on the pretext that they were looking for Iraq contraband runners. When the necessary protests were made, the Iraq Government deified the allegation. Re ports on the subject will be found elsewhere. There were also one or two other instances 'which might have brought about a state of strained relations but which fortunately were cooly dealt with by H. E. the Shaikh. These included : (a) The cruising about in the Khor Subiyeh (Kuwait waters) of an Iraq armed customs launch on 18th April 1934 and the firing upon and seizure of two Kuwait woodcutters boats. (b) The shooting and killing of an innocent Kuwait beduoin near Jebel Sanarn (site of the outrage well inside Kuwait territory), and the arrest and detention of his companion on 4th August. The men were actually travellers with no baggage and the aggressors were the crew of an armed car. (c) The cruising about in Kuwait waters south of Warba Island on 31st October of an Iraqi armed launch, and the firing on a party of the Shaikh’s falconers camped on the aforesaid Island. An informal conference between Iraqi representatives and H. E. the Shaikh of Kuwait was held in Kuwait on 23rd September under the aegis ot the Hon’ble Lt.-Col. G. Loch, the acting Political Resident. The [raqi reprosen a- tives were Dr. Naji Beg a! Asil and Tahsm Beg Ah, Mutasarnf ot Bam a. Ihe results of the conversations held were unfortunately ml. JX —Relations with Persia. These have been satisfactory on the whole, though the trade policy of Iran as made it so impossible for Kuwaiti merchants to do any business with that mntry that all legitimate trade may be said to be now dead.

Bahrain Armed Police have posts in Hidd, and Sakhir and supply various guards in Manamah. The Armed 1 0 r ia]l consisted of 158 men and followers on the 31st December. There are ton Instructors on the strength of the Armed Police. During the year the Karachi Police loaned the services of an Instructor the Bahrain Police. . ■ ^ In addition and independent of the Armed Police Force there is a hod\ riiVht watchmen. They numbered 109 at the end of the year.57 5 Local Affairs.—{!) Communal bitterness between Sunnis and Slri’ahs which Itad been quiescent for a, considerable time showed signs of revival due to certain unfortunate incidents. No open breach of the peace, however, occurred. ..Towards the end of the year the Bahrna, who are Shi’ah, presented a petition to the Ruler demanding increased representation on the Municipal Councils, and on the Majlis al Tujjarah, more schools for Shi’ahs and codifi cation of the existing law. Their demands are receiving careful attention. (2) One case of murder occurred in Muharraq towards the end of the year, in which the victim was a prostitute. The only other serious crime worth notice was that of a dacoity committed in Zing. The dacoits who were armed with rifles looted a house removing money and gold ornaments, and injured an old man. (3) In spite of the vigilance of the Police illicit distillation and consump tion of alcoholic spirits is increasing. 6. Bahrain Oil Concession.—During the year The Bahrain Petroleum Com pany Limited completed the construction of tanks on Sitrah Island, and the laying of a submarine pipe-line from there to the deep sea moorings which are three miles from the shore. On the 7th June the Tankship El Begun do left Bahrain with the first shipment of approximately 3,300 tons of crude oil. (2) Mr. E. A.

Ballantyne, British Representative in London of The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited visited Bahrain in October and discussed various matters connected with the Mining Lease of the Bahrain Oil Concession with the Officiating Political Agent. (4) Representatives of the British, American and Dutch Groups of the ’Iraq Petroleum Conipanv Limited visited Bahrain in October. They were followed a few days later by the representative of the French Group. Their visit was apparently connected with the difficulty experienced by The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited in securing a market for Bahrain oil. (5) On the 29th December the Mining Lease of the Bahrain Oil Conces sion was sealed by His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin ’Isa Al Eh a 1 if ah and signed by Mr. J. M.

S. “ Shoreham ” from the 11th to 14th January. He again passed through Sharjah on the 16th and 22nd March on his way to and from India. (2) Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain, visited Abu Dhabi on the 30th June, Dibai from the 30th October to 3rd November and the Trucial Coast from the 25th November to 10th December. 3. Mr. M. Worth, I.C.S., Officiating Political Agent, Bahrain, visited the Trucial Coast from the 22nd to 27th September. 4. British Interests.—{1) On the 7th September the Shaikh of Sharjah granted Commander R. C. Bayldon, R.N. (retired), an option to examine deposits of red oxide of iron on Abu Musa Island, and—should the oxide prove satisfactory—to take up a concession. For this purpose Mr. N. S. Kinnersley ot the Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Company, Limited, visited Abu Musa m November and expressed himself satisfied with the quality of the oxide. (2) Mr. J. M. Russell, Deputy Manager of the Mesopotamia Persia Cor poration, Limited, Bahrain, visited Dibai on the 11th and 12th October in con nection with an inspection of the Corjioration’s office at that Port. (3) Mr. P. T. Cox, a geologist of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, accompanied the Political Agent on his tour of the Trucial Coast in November- December and in response to requests from the Shaikhs of Dibai, Sharjah, ’Ajman and Lmm al Quwain, examined the neighbourhood of their towns for an artesian supply of water. He considered the possibility of finding an artesian supply of water, except at a great depth, was remote. Examinations at Abu Dhabi led Mr. Cox to the conclusion that artesian wells there were probably feasible. On the return journey to Bahrain Mr. Cox examined the Islands of Dalmah, Sir Bani Yas and Halul. Red oxide of iron was found, but he was unable in the time at his disposal to determine whether it was available in commercially exploitable quantities. (4) Mr. W. C. Janes, Superintendent of Imperial Airways, Limited, at Sharjah, proceeded on leave during the summer and was relieved by Captain R- V. Robinson. On expiry of his leave Mr. Janes was re-posted to Sharjah. _5. Aviation. —(1) Aeroplanes and flying boats of the Royal Air Force stationed in ’Iraq paid frequelit visits to the Trucial Coast. The former landed only^ at Sharjah. The latter visited Sir Bani Y r as Island, Dibai and Ras al Khaimah, where there are petrol stores and suitable anchorages. (2) During the year the Residency Agent, Sharjah, visited Abu Dhabi, accompanied by Shaikh Sa’id bin Maktum, O.B.E., Ruler of Dibai, with a view to concluding an agreement with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi for a landing ground at Abu Dhabi and to regularize the position in regard to the flying boat anchor age and petrol store on Sir Bani Yas Island. The Residency Agent and Shaikh62 Sa’id were able to secure the Shaikh’s concurrence to the facilities required at ^ . llmi Yas Island but not for those required at Abu Dhabi. The Political Agent Bahrain, visited Abu Dhabi in December with a view to overcoming the obstacles w-th regard to the landing ground at Abu Dhabi, and there is no doubt that a ftnafagreement will be reached early m the coming year. n) The aeroplanes of Imperial Airways, Limited, continued to make night stops at Sharjah throughout the year. No incidents occurred m connection with their weekly service. 6 Rmml Nani —H M. S. “ Colombo ” of the 4th Cruiser Squadron visited the Trucial Coast during January and periodical visits were paid to the various States of the Trucial Coast by Sloops of the Persian Gulf Division. 7 Shinvina (1) Steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Com pany I imUerh'ave called at Sharjah and Dibai regularly throughout the year. Intermittent calls also have been made by steamers ot Messrs. Frank C. Stnek and Company (Busreh), Limited. (2) A Japanese steamer called at Sharjah and Dibai on the 7th Jamiarj and again on the 20th Jnne. (3) Steamers of the Hansa Line (German) also called at Sharjah and Dibai during the year. (4) S S “ Ahmedi of the Eastern Steam Navigation Company, Limited, called at Dibai on the 3rd October. 8 Internal Affairs.—(1) In May some lighters of the British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited, were looted in the khor of Dibai by some of the Shaikh s relatives. 'The Shaikh of Dibai has been warned that he must either recover the plundered goods or their value. So far the warning has produced no results. (2) In September an attempt was made on the life of Shaikh Sa’id bin Maktum O.B.E., Ruler of Dibai, by his cousins, and later they proposed to hold a meeting to depose him. As the cousins had for some time past been indulg ing in looting and violence in Dibai, it was feared that this attempt to ^ e P os ^ Shaikh Said would lead to breaches of the peace, which might endanger the* safety of British subjects in Dibai. H. M. S “ Lupin ” was therefore ordered to proceed to Dibai and the Royal Air Force demonstrated over the Town, and later the Political Agent, Bahrain, visited Dibai. As the matter was an internal affair the Political Agent on behalf of the Political Reside informed the Shaikh that he could deal with his cousins as he thought ht but that he should take suitable measures for the protection of British bves a property. A Notice by the Resident was also published m the town that u such lives and propertv were endangered, those responsible for the disturbance^ would be held to account. The Shaikh demanded that his cousins should come to his house and swear an oath that they would obey his rule and J- troubling the people. A critical moment occurred on the night ot the October 1 1st November, when the Shaikh issued an ultimatum to his cou ^ to come to his house or to quit the town by mid-day on the 1st November, u Shaikh called in bedouin assistance and members of the Shaikh s sub-tribe mediated between him and his cousins. After prolonged negotiations they were successful in arranging for a representative of each of the branches ot cousins to take the oath demanded by the Shaikh. (3) The usual amount of petty tribal raiding, camel stealing and occasional murders and kidnappings took place in various places near the coast but t ere were no serious disturbances. (4) In January there was a recrudescence of fighting between the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Ajman, but peace was eventually restored through the interve tion of the Residency Agent assisted by tfie Buler 0 f Dibai. (5) The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah has maintained his recalcitrant attitude throughout the year and has refused to call on His Majesty’s Ships when i ) visited the port. 9. General. — (1) In January the Honourable the Political Resident held a darbar on board H. M. S. “ Shoreham ” at Dibai, at which he presented bhaiK Sa’id bin Maktum of Dibai the Medal and Badge of the Order of the J-i Empire. All Rulers of the Trucial Coast States were present except the o of Ras al Khaimnh.63 * (2) Their Excellencies the Viceroy of India and the Conntess of Willingdon staved the night in Imperial Airways’ Rest Rouse at Sharjah on their way o yi rl in Alav and on their return iournev in Amrust.

(A) Agmcy Officials—The following officials held charge of the Agency as shown 7 - Major C. E. U. Bremner, M.C., held charge of the Political Agency throughout the year. The appointment of Medical Officer in charge of the Agency Hospital and of Quarantine Duties was held by Major D. L. Mackay, from 1st January to 21st October, on which date he returned to military duty, being relieved by Assistant Surgeon R. Easey I.M.D.' The post of the Treasury Officer was held by Mr. A. S. Norton throughout the year. (B) A gcncy in general .—During the period under review a considerable amount of sickness occurred among the personnel of the Agency staff. This was attributable to the excessively trying climatic conditions prevailing this year. The effects were somewhat mitigated by the supply of fresh vegetables now obtainable from a garden laid down and developed for the purpose by the Political Agent in 1933. The vogue for fresh vegetables has caught on and cabbages and other green food, hitherto unknown to the local inhabitant, are being grown and marketed by them in the Muscat bazaar. A number c*f improvements have been effected in the Agency and other Government buildings during the year. The installation of an electrical generating plant, to afford current to all Government buildings, is nearing completion and wall go far to make conditions more tolerable and to reduce sickness, inevitable in a climate such as that of Muscat. A very considerable debt of gratitude is due to the Revd. D. Dykstra of the American Mission, w r hose ever ready assistance and expert advice have proved invaluable to the Political Agent in carrying out various works and repairs. His experience and modern technical knowledge in constructional and repair works have been constantly available. It has thus been possible to introduce man} la 1 tour and material-saving innovations, which have done much to improve the standard of work and to reduce expenditure. The employment, on his advice, of re-inforced concrete and cement for constructional and repair work has proved a sound economical measure and the examp e has been eagerly emulated alike by the State and private owners. ‘a o^f! en 7^ Hospital.

An Agreement, entitled the ii Civil Air Agreement ”, for regulating the conditions of Civil Aviation within Muscat Territories, was concluded in October between His Majesty’s Government and His Highness the Sultan. 4. Judicial. Judicial matters form the subject of a separate report. 5. Trade .—The year under review has unfortunately not justified the slight indications of optimism prevalent at its outset. Imports have shown a decline of Us. 4,63,396 in value, a decrease attributable, as last year, more to the cheap quality of the g’oods imported than to the quantity. Japanese goods, which head he list, have been largely responsible for this falling off and are in creasingly conspicuous in the dry and piece-goods markets. The following figures, supplied by the Customs Department of the Muscat State, show at a glance the value of exports and imports for the year 1932-33 The principle articles of export continue to be (a) dry and wet dates and (b) dried fish, whilst imports have been composed of chiefly, rice, sugar, coffee, piece-goods, wines and liquors, cement and dry goods in general. The prohibition of importation into Germany other than on the principle of barter, has caused a large falling off in the export of “ Kasha ” (fish manure). As this forms one of the principal exports from the Sultanate, such anxiety is felt by the exporters concerned, who have hitherto been unable to develop other markets. 6. (A) Royal Navy .—-Visits of H. M. Ships and Koyal Air Force craft to muscat are detailed in appendix “ A ” to this Keport. Owing to the tranouil conditions prevailing throughout the year neither service was called on for active participation o/f affairs connected with the Agency, but in March, and again in November, a Sloop was kindly placed at the disposal of the Political Agent by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf for the object set forth in the succeeding paragraphs. (B) Royal Air Force .—Every endeavour was made during the vear to find and establish suitable landing grounds between Masirah Island and Murbat, and thus to complete the chain of the aerial route between Aden and Basrah. For this purpose the Political Agent proceeded during March 1934 to re connoitre the South East littoral of the Sultanate. The reconnaissance wns carried out in H. M. S. “ Bideford ” and wns joined at Masirah Island by Air Vice-Marshall C. S. Burnett, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O., the Air Officer Commanding, ’‘Iraq, who proceeded to the rendezvous by flying boat. . Several points, which from previous aerial reconnaissance appeared pro mising. were visited. But in the short time available, which was further cur tailed by the outbreak: of a contagious disease among the labour personnel ac companying the reconnaissance, it was not possible to select a ground at the time. Much valuable information however, was acquired, which led to the rapid selection and completion of a suitable site in November, when a further recon- mtissamce was carnied out in H. M.

Dvkstra and Doctor and Mrs. Harrison, whilst Dr. (Miss) Hosman conduct the. Zenana Mission Hospital in Muscat for some months, before preceding to the Batinah Coast for mission-cum-medical purposes. Occasion was taken of the American Minister’s visit to Muscat to “ officia .) open ” the new Mission Hospital at Mat rah, which had however been m use since October 1933. The popularity of this hospital, which is most evident, has been further en hanced by the introduction of a small infant school, conducted under the gui of Dr. and Mrs. Harrison, aided by a native teacher. By the construction o a tennis court in their private grounds, the Doctor and his able wife are endea^ou ing to inculcate the rudiments of healthy, open air exercise into the minds o of the younger inhabitants of the Matrah bazaar. During the summer months this and the Zenana Hospital at Muscat are closed as the entire Mission staff leave Muscat territory for cooler climes, beat in their opinion being too intolerable. 10.

Part II. 1 Thilina Family—{a) His Highness the Sultan, having spent nearly a year in Dhofar returned to Muscat on 15th February 1934 in S. S. “ British Lard ”, which had been diverted to Salala for the purpose, by the courtesy of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Saiyid Malik and the remainder of the Sultan’s entourage arrived back in Muscat on 22nd February, having spent a tempestuous six weeks at sea in a dhow. His Hiohness, like his father before him, is greatly enamoured of Dhofar and his main thought seems to be for the consolidation and improvement of that province where he is reported to have effected a marriage alliance between himself and the daughter of one of the leading Qura mountain Sheikhs, Said bin Ali al Ma-aishani. After a sojourn of six weeks at his headquarters, the Sultan proceeded to Sur for a general inspection of his administration theie. Whilst His Highness remained somewhat reticent as to what he had achieved duung this \isit, i is believed not to have been attended with the eclat anticipated. His Highness however is said to have introduced certain measures for tightening up the Customs before returning to Muscat on 11th April. In Mav His Highness essayed a protracted tour of the Batinah but indis position compelled his return after a week. Saiyid Hamad bin Faisal, Wall of Matrah was subsequently deputed to proceed to the _ Batinah to carry out methods of assessment and collection of Zakat as directed by His Highness. Saiyid Hamad returned to Muscat on 30th July having fulfilled his mission. The Sultan paid a fortnight’s visit to Sohar in September and returned with a large batch of miscellaneous prisoners including some minor refractory Sheikhs. On the 26th October His Highness, who had undoubtedly spent a most stren- ous summer on the affairs of his State, embarked for India on a wed earned holi day. He anticipated returning in late February or March but has made no public announcement to that effect. (5) Saiyid Nadir, the senior of His Highness’ uncles, who last year had adopted an exceedingly uncompromising attitude regarding the reduction in his allowances {vide Annual Report for 1933), sought the intervention or His Excellency the Viceroy in the matter in April. His request being declined, Saiyid Nadir, after a good deal of bluster eventually accepted his reduced salary, arrears of which the Sultan generously paid him. (c) The jealousy and bad feeling latent between various prominent members of the Ruling Family became more evident in the absence of the Sultan s con trolling hand. These bickerings, which hitherto have fortunately not been attended with serious consequences, have lowered the prestige of the Fining Family considerably. They were much enhanced by His Highness appoint ing Saiyid Shahab to represent him during his absence in India. Certain in terested persons find it considerably to their advantage to widen the breac between the warring factions and the process of disintegration needs but me withdrawal of certain restraining factors to become complete. (d) As related above Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal was appointed to represent the Sultan during the latter’s absence in India. Whilst he is exceeding} shrewd in affairs connected with the State, certain defects in his character deny Saiyid Shahab the prestige that his position would otherwise afford him and ni authority has been directly flouted by R. S. Dull Chand, the Director ot Re\enu on several occasions. Financial Adviser .—On his return from Dhofar, His Highness abolished the post of Financial Adviser and announced his intention of taking over the con i of Finance personally. Though undoubtedly he has a considerable proi-eiW, for financial matters, His Highness’ ability to deal with the intricacies of a is somewhat limited, mid the guiding brain in this department is withou q fion the Director of Revenues.69 2 St aic Finance. The opening balance at the commencement of the year showed a working credit o Es. 1 65,737-11-0. This figure excludes however debts due by the State to local creditors, which amount to Es. 90,744 Very little effort has been made by the State to meet these debts and, althomdi it was hoped to brmg about a satisfactory solution for payment of the major' creditor (K. B. Mohammad Aassib &amp; Son) for reasons which do not fall within the scope of this report, the State has hitherto failed to honour its liabilities in this con nection. A proposal for the temporary continuance of the Arms Traffic subsidy is' under consideration.The loss of this subsidy to the State will be much felt at this juncture and will still further postpone the payment of outsanding debts and the introduction of education and other desirable reforms. The increase of import duty on certain commodities agreed to by some of the Government’s in Treaty Alliance with the State has afforded some im provement in Customs Eevenues derived from those particular lines. This ad vantage however has been considerably set off by the decrease in the general value of imports, as related in Part I of this report. An unfortunate aspect of the tightening up of the Customs and Eevenues administration has been the extortionate demands that are reported to have been imposed by the Director of Eevenues, which in some cases would appear to be wholly illegal. This is particularly applicable to the Batinah coastal towns and to a lesser extent in Gwadur. In the former case the method of taxation is driving both traders and the holders of smaller date plantations to abandon their concerns and to seek refuge elsewhere. The situation is one that will need careful watching in the future to avert the untimely decease of the goose that has hitherto produced eggs which, if not always golden, have at any rate sustained the State. (Note .—In the Spring of 1935 the Political Kesident, during a visit to Muscat, took the opportunity of representing this state of affairs to the Sultan, who had been absent from the State in India for some months. Steps were taken to remedy the grievances of British subjects, and the Sultan promised that he would keep a stricter check on his Director of Customs and Revenue in the future, and would visit the Batinah area to in vestigate personally the conditions ■prevailing there.) 3. Events of Political Interest in State Limits —{a) In connection with the reconnaissance mentioned in Part 1 of this Eeport, His Highness the Sultan deputed a representative to accompany the expedition on each occasion. I or the first Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal was appointed and for the second His Highness’s choice fell on Saiyid Mahmud bin Faisal. These reconnaissances thus afforded excellent opportunities for membeis of the Ruling Family to get in touch with the wilder and most remote parts of the Sultanate, which otherwise remain unvisited. During the November expedition contact was made with Shaikh Said bin Sultan bin Mohd. el Majali of Mahut, whose paramount influence on the South Fast ittoral 0 f the Sultanate between Masirah and Sauqrah was immediately appai ent.. The extent of the Shaikh’s influence apparently had hitherto been unknown to the Sultan, but it is hoped from the experience now gained His Highness \wll derive considerable political benefit. (b) Much uneasiness and discontent prevails on the Batinah coast both among British and Muscati subjects owing to the methods °qU xat “ n * alleged constant issue of new rules and regulations by the Director of Custom. and Revenue. On all sides complaints are heard of the difficulty in hands of the Muscat authorities. Certainly from the experience of certain cm . affecting British subjects taken up by the Politica ff 1 .’ . ,r , lt *] 1P to be considerable justification for these complain s an in ‘ • j 0 }, e a j Headquarters of the Government or in the various Vilayets, would seem to u discount. die seizures of a Muscati dhow by Persian officia s. 4.

Sheikh Muhammad bin Isa el Harithi deputed by Sheikh Isa of Qabil, the Imam’s right hand, arrived at Muscat in June. The ostensible object of his visit was the settlement of outstanding cases between Muscat and Oman. The Sheikh was the bearer of a letter from Sheikh Isa to the Sultan in which pointed refer ence was made to the “ desirability of settling our cases without reference to non believers ”. His Highness was good enough to show this letter to the Political Agent. None the less, Sheikh Muhammad visited the Political Agent and sought by roundabout methods to sound his views and seek his assistance. He also bore a letter for the Political Agent from his father, couched in very different terms from that, addressed to the Sultan. The Sheikh’s visit was unproductive of results and he returned to Oman in due course having effected nothing. 5. Trade and General—This subject has already been dealt with elsewhere in this report. 6. Muscat Jw/nnfn/.—Command of the Corps remained with Subedar Major Fateh Khan till 24th February, when he proceeded on retirement. At a cere monial inspection of the Corps on the eve of the Subedar Major’s departure, His Highness presented Fateh Khan with a medal in recognition of his 13 years’ service with the State. Command subsequently devolved on Subedar Muhammad Ibrahim till the latter’s dismissal for misconduct in October, when responsibility for the training and military administration of the Corps was temporarily assumed by the Poli tical Agent, at a special request of the Sultan. It is hoped that the services of a suitable officer as Commandant of the Corps will be obtainable in the near future. (Sd.) C. E. U. BREMNER, Major, Political Agent and II. B. M.’s Consul, Muscat.

Royal Navy.^ The chief event of naval importance in the year was the removal of the Naval Base from Henjam to Bahrain on the Arab Coast, and our relinquishment of Basidu in Persian territorial waters. The situa tion of the Base on the Iranian side of the Gulf had several disadvantages. A Naval Base in a foreign country is in itself anomalous, and the policy of pinpricks and obstructiveness pursued by the local Iranian authorities caused friction between them and His Majesty’s Sloops. The presence of the Base was moreover a hostage to fortune in the hands of the Iranian Government who could at any time have brought pressure to bear on His Majesty’s Government, in connection with any questions at issue between them, by demanding the withdrawal of the Base. In addition the diminish ing importance of the Iranian side of the Persian Gulf and the increasing importance of the Arab side made it only logical that the Base should be situated in the latter area. A tactful Communique giving reasons for the move for the benefit of the Iranian Government, the Arab Shaikhdoms, and the Press at large, was worked out by His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, and the Resident, and approved of by His Majesty’s Government and the Gov ernment of India. Contrary to expectations the Iranian Government did not make any capital out of the move and appeared to be genuinely grateful for a friendly gesture. On the Arab side the move created less attention than had been anticipated, it being generally regarded as a natural change in keeping with present-day conditions. Amongst the educated classes the move was regarded as open proof that His Majesty’s Government had no intention of admitting the Persian claim to Bahrain. The attitude of the average c man in the bazaar’ may be summed up by the reaction of one of the first Arabs in Bahrain who heard of the move, and who remarked “By God, the price of eggs will go up”, which it did. The Shaikh of Bahrain received the thanks of His Majesty’s Govern ment for his ready acquiesence in the establishment of the Base in his terri tory, and the Bahrain Government were of great assistance to the Royal Navy in the erection of buildings at the Base. As in previous years the Sloops of the Persian Gulf Division continued to do excellent work on the Arab Coast, and were as usual frequently called on the assist the Political Resident and Political Officers under him m making their tours. Aviation.—Following on the Air Agreement negotiated last year with the Rulers of Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscajt, and the a,ir facilities obtained during that period, the following facilities were obtained during the year under review. In February, a petrol store and emergency landing ground at Abu Dhabi. In December, a bomb store at Sharjah. The Hying Boats and land machines of the Royal Air Force continued to do useful work in connection with the establishment o t e ir ,- The Resident and Political Officers under him were enabled from time to time to make tours in Royal Air Force machines, which proved a consider- able convenience. . Imperial Airways continued their bi-weekly service ast an es throughout the year, and no incidents took place. As in 1934 the Arab Air Route remained closed for various reasons for private aviators. Oil Interests.—After prolonged and somewhat TOmplirated nego m- tions, in which the Resident had personally to take part, “ d concluded in May with the Shaikh of Qatar, by which the latter gra *25(0) F&amp;PDan Oil concession to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The Company had not commenced working their concession by the end of the year. During the year the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company also secured Oil options from the following Shaikhs on the Trucial Coast. Shaikh Said bin Maktum of Dibai. ! Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah. Shaikh Sultan bin Salim of Ras al Khaimah and Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid of Ajman. The Kuwait Oil Company who had been granted an Oil concession in December 1934 by the Shaikh of Kuwait (see Review of last year) commenced working their concession in October of this year. The Bahrain Petroleum Company had a successful year during which 176.388 tons of crude oil were shipped from Bahrain. The total personnel of the Company at the end of the year was as follows American European British subjects ....... Indian British subjects ........ Bahrainis f Iranians, . . • • • • *1 Others . Iraqis, When the French Sloop “Bougainville” visited Ras al Khaimah on 11th February, overtures for a French geologist to examine the possibility of oil in Ras al Khaimah territory were mad'e by the Shaikh to Contre- Amiral Rivet, who was reported to have replied that he would try and send one in about three months’ time. To forestall this possibility the Resident asked the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to send one of their geologists as soon as possible to visit Ras al Khaimah which was accordingly done. Kuwait. —The Shaikh of Kuwait’s date gardens in Iraq (see Review of last year). Nothing definite had resulted towards the solution of this difficult problem by the end of the year. The declining importance of the pearl industry is shown by the fact that only 250 pearling boats put out for the season as compared with 300 the previous year. The question of the Kuwait-Iraq Smuggling (see Review of last year) was finally solved by the Iraq Government in the autumn instituting their own Preventive Service on economical and effective lines. As in 1934 incidents continued of Iraq Customs officials and Police violating Kuwait territory and territorial waters and ill-treating and assult- ing Kuwait subjects. In spite of continued representations made by His Majesty’s Government on behalf of the Shaikh of Kuwait to the Iraq Gov ernment, no reparations have been forthcoming from the latter who have continued to reply that either such incidents did not take place as reported or occurred in Iraq waters. As pointed out in the Review of last year it must be remembered, as an important factor in this problem, that while Kuwaitis are amongst those who actually smuggle goods by sea into Iraq territory from Kuwait, on land, where the contraband trade is by far the greater, it is the Iraqi tribesmen who are the carriers—Kuwait being merely the market where they purchase their goods. Ibn Saud’s blockade of exports from Kuwait into Saudi Arabia (see Review of last year) continued with the same severitv as before. Through the mediation of His Majesty’s Government a Saudi delegation visited Kuwait in June to discuss with the Shaikh means by which the latter could co-operate with the Saudi Government in checking smuggling, in return for which co-operation the Saudi Government wrould raise the blockade. _ The immediate result of the conference was not hopeful owing to the intransigent attitude of the Saudi delegates who insisted that, unless the Shaikh guar anteed that not a single smuggler would cross the frontier, they would come to no agreement. Later representations however by His Majesty’s Minister, 49 26 61 1,283 244( iii ) f. Jedda, to the Saudi Government and by the Resident to the Shaikh brought about a moie hopeful state of affairs, and at the end of the year there was a faint hope that this question might be solved. As in the case of smuggling into Iraq it is not the Kuwaiti tribesmen who actaully do the smuggling but those under the authority of the Saudi Government. In May a party of 6 armed retainers of Ibn Jiluwi, Governor of Hasa, entered Kuwait territory on business of the Saudi Government without pro per credentials from the latter, which -resulted in a certain amount of correspondence between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Govern ment. The inicdent on the whole probably had a good effect since the next party which came to Kuwait was properly accredited. Bahrain. —In October the Saudi Government reported that about 400 destitute Indian pilgrims had been collected by the local authorities in Hasa, and asked that arrangements should be made to transport them to Bahrain. The Government of India, at the suggestion of the Resident, agreed that a concentration camp should be arranged in Bahrain by the Political Agent in co-operation with the Bahrain Government, where the pilgrims would be properly fed, looked after and given medical treatment. Arrangements we made with the British India Steam Navigation Company by which the fast Mail made a special call at Bahrain, and took away the bulk of the pil grims to India. The remainder followed in batches by Slow Mail as oppor tunity offered. In March a Saudi delegation visited Bahrain to negotiate with the Bahrain Government on the subject of the transit dues charged by the latter on goods destined for Saudi Arabia. Under the auspices of the Political Agent a satisfactory arrangement was come to on the various points con cerned, the Agreement being officially signed by both parties, the Saudi Government and His Majesty’s Government on behalf of the Bahrain Gov ernment before the end of the year. On the occasion of the King’s Birthday the honour of the K.C.I.E. was conferred on the Shaikh of Bahrain. Trucial Coast.—In September the death occurred of Khan Bahadur Isa )in Abdul Latif, O.B.E., who had been for 18 years Residency Agent on he Trucial Coast, during which period he had done excellent work. ^ His 'ather and his grandfather had served in similar capacities beiore nim. Imperial Airways’ planes continued to use the Sharjah Air Port rithout incident. The pearling season on the Trucial Coast was poor. Pear s were ewer and prices lower. ,. The negotiations between His Majesty’s G . ove ™™ ent A S ®uf* Arabian Government on the subject of the frontiers be wee .ml the Trueial Coast States and Muscat, , md er f 1934 (see Review of last year), we yy ontmu ®i rr 2pon de nee eview. This complicated question was the cause of lengthy correspond etween His Majesty’s Government, His Majesty’s ^'^^0 He he Resident/and of vairous visits bv the Political Ageyt, Bahwin to He ■ racial Coast for investigations on the spot.

At the close of t y ^ urre( j at Abu Dhabi in February An incident of some importance ^ Agreement to give certain Ten the Shaikh of that place, who had g a deauate payment, refused on acilities to the Royal Air Force m ' o construct he arrival of the Royal Air Force working party to allowcertain facilities. The Resident in reporting this to His Majesty's Gov ernment and the Government of India, proposed that unless the Shaikh ceased to be obstructive certain pressure would be brought to bear on him and his people. His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India concurred in this proposal, and the Shaikh who was informed accordingly ceased his obstructiveness and the air facilities were duly constructed. The Shaikh also apologised to the Officer Commanding H. M. S. Fowey for a discourtesy of which he had been guilty on a previous occasion. During 1934 certain lighters taking cargo from a British India Steam Navigation Company steamer to the shore at Dibai were upset in a heavy sea near the shore and goods plundered to the value of Rs. 5,000. In reply to representations made to him by the Resident the Shaikh professed himself unable to recover the amount as the plunderers had been the followers of an opposition party headed by his cousins. The incident in October 1934 (described in the last Review) considerably strengthened the Shaikh’s hands. vis a vis his recalcitrant relatives, and following on the incident at Abu Dhabi, referred to above, the Resident informed the Shaikh of Dibai that unless ? the amount was paid within a certain time certain pressure would be employed aganist him and his people. The amount was paid up and sent to the Underwriters who were the party affected by the loss of the goods. Both these incidents had a salutary effect on the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast. A satisfactory feature of botli incidents was that a settlement was arrived at by enforcing tribal responsibility on the Shaikhs and their people, without in any way changing our long established policy on the Trucial Coast of not interfering in the internal affairs of the Shaikhdoms. For some years the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah had assumed a recalci trant attitude and refused to call on the Resident and his Political Officers when they visited his port in His Majesty’s Ships, or on Officers Command ing His Majesty’s Ships. In December 1934 the Shaikh went further and removed his flag from the Island of Tamb which is one of his possessions— it is believed with some idea of permitting the Iranian Government to hoist their flag in place of his. On representations being made by the Resident to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, the Shaikh was informed that if he did not re-hoist his flag on the Island the Shaikh of Sharjah, the other Chief of the Jowasim tribe, would be permitted to take possession of Tamb. As a result of this communication the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah not only re-hoisted his flag but resumed friendly rela tions with Political Officers and Officers Commanding His Majesty’s Ships, on whom he now calls. Shaikh Muhammad Sultan bin Saqar of Sharjah was accorded a per sonal salute of 5 guns : his dynastic salute is 3. Muscat ,—The Muscat Arms Subsidy was granted by the Government of India in 1912 to Sultan Saiyid Faisal bin Turki as a personal subsidy in return for an arrangement come to with him by which he put a stop to the gun-running from Muscat to the Persian Coast and thence to Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier of India. On the death of Sultan Faisal shortly afterwards the Government of India extended the subsidy ex gratia to his son Taimur bin Faisar. When Sultan Taimur bin Faisal abdicated in 1932 the Government of India made a similar conces sion to the present Sultan, Said bin Taimur. The ground for this extension was the grave financial condition of the State which verged on bankruptcy. By the end of 1935 the State, through the efforts of the Sultan, aided by the Political Agent, Muscat, and the Resident, was solvent and the subsidy was accordingly discontinued. In February the Sultan left Muscat for Dhofar, an outlying but fertile and pleasant part of his dominions some 700 miles south of Muscat, and to anticipate the events of 1936 has not returned and does not propose to do so until the Autumn. During the period referred to above, when his State was threatened with bankruptcy, the Sultan worked extremely Hard, but now that the State is once more moderately solvent, is apparently( ) hat a sttifej nu A went W of hisp GoveriEl where 8 steamers do m aU'L? eve^dhol' m^the m^nsoon^Xre fhere^s SitaWd tS/T Resident, is a serious inconvenience. The Resident has nnintfi * h .l he out to him but so far without appreciable result. d P omt ed out this of t f?jasTSrhSto. ^ COlmeCted by Cable dire0t with Karachi ^ad In April the Sultan accorded permission for the use of the small Island of Jazirat-al-Ghanum (Khor Quwai) as a subsidiary base for the Se of the Sloops of the Persian Gulf Division, for which he received the thanks of His Majesty s Government and the Government o‘f India. PERSIAN SIDE. By the end of the year the Iranian authorities had succeeded in further disarming the tribes and establishing order in the districts of Tangistan Dashti, Dahki and the hinterland between Bushire and Lingah Some hundred outlaws were induced to return to their homes on beinS given safe- ronduct; those who had openly resisted the authorities were executed. Security in the Jask and Charbar districts improved during the year. Persian Navy.—The Persian Navy occupied itself with its chief dutv of preventing smuggling by sea and made a number of captures of sailing emit alleged to b® engaged in that occupation. No incidents occurred during the year in regard to interference with dhows'of the Arab Shaikh- doms. Relations with local Persxan Officials .—Relations with the Governor of the Southern Ports continued to be most cordial, CaUe Re-organization .—Cable and Wireless Limited effected some changes in their cable routes in the Persian Gulf. Briefly, the cable sta tion at Charber has been closed and that at Jask will follow shortly in the course of a year or so, while Bushire has been linked to Bahrain by direct cable. Following on the naval evacuation of Hen jam referred to above both the cable and wireless stations at Hen jam were closed. luldtepl nicatii few T. C. FOWLE,— Lient-Colonel, T. C.

Customs Administration. —In February the Revenue Department was amalgamated with the Customs by an order of His Excellency Davar, the Minister of Finance, and they were controlled by Muhammad Veli Nouban as Provincial Director of the Southern Customs and Revenue throughout the year. Customs Preventive Department . —With the abolition of the system of separate and independent committees of inspection in Bushire and m the down ports the smuggling traffic increased in volume and large quantities of contraband goods consisting of piece goods, imitation silk, haberdas sry, tea and sugar found their wav into the interior of the country through t e sTangistan and Dashti Ports, the Shib-Kun region and Lmgah and district.Smugglers extended their activities as far as Tehran and at the same time flooded the markets in other towns. They bought seized goods at the official auctions and utilising the customs seals on these on their own smuggled goods, passed them off for Customs Preventive sale goods. The Government had therefore to open a shop in each town for the sale of theiij seized goods. In the middle of the year when the rupee exchange rose up in Iran smugglers took much silver out of the country to the Arab side of the Gulf where they could purchase Rupees at Rials 290 a hundred as against Rials 600 to Rials 620 a hundred in Iran. Government Measures for discouraging smuggling of contraband goods. I. Sugar Comyany .—At the instance of His Excellency the Governor, Muhammad Ali Mirza Rokni, a Company was formed by the local merchants to buy sugar from the Customs Department, Bushire, for local consumption in Bushire and its suburbs. Half of the Company s capital Rials 150,000 (£2375) was provided by the merchants and the other half by Government. His Excellency Ali Akbar, the Minister of Finance on his arrival here in February arranged for the Company to be supplied with loaf sugar at Rials 8 (2 shillings) a Batman (about 7 lbs.) and crystal sugar at Rials 7 (l/9fc?.) a Batman. To these prices the Company might add Cts. 40 (a little over Id.) a Batman for their profit when selling the articles to retailers and the latter could add Cts. 75 (2d. or a little more) when selling the articles to consumers. Seeing that the area of the Company’s activities was very limited Lingah and district were subsequently included. II. Comyany for sale of yiece goods .—At the end of March another Company was formed by the local merchants, at the instance of the Governor, for the sale of piece goods in Bushire and Lingah and districts. The capital Rials 600,000 (£7500) was provided by the merchants with less reluctance than in the case of the Sugar Company. This Company also buys peice goods from the Customs, Bushire, and sells them to local drapers. These measures helped to prevent the smuggling of sugar into Bushire and perhaps Lingah towns, but piece goods and other contraband goods continued to come in as they did before. The audacity of smugglers does not seem to have abated. In three encounters which they had with the Customs guards and the Amnieh (Road Guard) they defeated the latter, killed 3 of them and succeeded in getting safely away with their caravans. Only in one instance, in which the smugglers came up against a party of conscripts, did they lose their ringleader and 6 of them were arrested. Five officials who had abetted smugglers in their traffic were arrested and sent to Shiraz for trial and punishment during the year under reference. The aggregate amount to contraband goods captured by the officials of the Customs Preventive Department during the year under reference came to 1465 packanges piece goods and sundries, 18 camels, 21 smugglers and 6 smugglers’ dhows. Roads and Communications .—The Bushire-Shiraz road, the Coast road which runs between Bushire and Lingah, and a third between Bushire and Abadan were washed away after each fall of rain, and made impassa ble for more than a fortnight each. The motor car of His Excellency, Davar, the Minister of Finance, while coming down from Shiraz had to be manhandled at several spots before it could get through. His Excellency said that the Government cannot bear the heavy expense of maintaining this road and that they would repair the Bushire- Eiruzabad-Shiraz road which does not run through mountains and precipices as the Bushire-Shiraz one does. But nothing had been done in this connec tion up to the conclusion of the year.Bushire to be installed set to “'f B r‘” “ p«- »* i- «'.p ■; *'‘•8 '« F- sale of Government sugar and pieceg-oods r ri,„ T° C0 1 In P ani ® s for tlle tinn of a third rnmnan,, a ' u P lec ?g 00cls - fcey contemplated the forma- keeping the carrying trade betweenTrS pots' .fthT hinds ofTIocfl Education.—The local school examinations were held in the 1st March two months ahead of the usual time. Fifty boys sat for the examinations as against 60 m the previous year. 33 Government Certificates which had been received for the students who had passed their examinations last year were handed over to them. Co-education was introduced in one of the Government schools. No improvement was effected in the 16 schools under the management of the Education Department, Bushire. The Director of Education, however took steps to ascertain the number of houses and shops which are waqf (religious endowment property) in Bushire with a view to taking 5 per cent, of their rent in aid of local schools. Economic Condition .—The Central Government having approved a suggestion made by His Excellency the Governor, Bushire, the Revenue iiepartment advanced wheat seed and money to cultivators in Bushire and district. Many took advantage of the opportunity and borrowed money and wheat seed and a larger extent of land was brought under the plough. The rainfall which amounted to 14-69 inches ensured a good harvest and by the end of the year the peasantry were much better off than they were in the previous year. The lucrative business of acting as guides to smugglers or as guards for conducting their caravans of contraband goods to places of safety continued to be a good source of employment. } In Bushire town the Customs Department daily employed some 200, persons either in attaching banderole labels to the Government’s loaf sugar and packets of their tea, in putting their soft sugar into bags, or in building an embankment to the south of the Customs quay. Bushire Municipality .—Out of the 29 nominees voted for by the citizens of Bushire the Central Government approved the following to ba members of the Municipality Council:— 1. Muhammad Husain Talebi. 2. Ali Akbar Dewani. 3. Mehdi Timsar. 4. Sayed Abdur Rasul Kazeruni, 5. Sayed Muhammad Syadat. 6. Sayed Muhammad Tebatebai. 7. Yusuf Ukhuat, Editor of the local weekly f ‘The Khalij-i-Iran”. ; 8. Ahmad Borazjani. 9. Muham/mad Khurram. It functioned from the 15th March when it had a deficit of Rials 10,000 as the local tax-payers had been too poor to pay up their taxes. It, there fore, abandoned levelling the town streets, but retained a staff of 50 employees to look after the sanitation and lighting of the town. It also maintains ten beds for the lying-in ward for the poor of the town in the lown Infirmary, a local Doctor to look after them and to treat other poor patients free of charge, and a local Government school. Acting upon instructions from Tehran the Council has provided 120 sofas to be used in Husainiehs (places of no sanctity as compared with mosques) for reciting the Qoran and saying prayers for the benefit of the 225(C) Modead. These were formerly held for days in mosques but are now to be held for 2 hours only with the mourners sitting on sofas instead of squatting on the floor. The Council had not by the end of the year under review taken any steps to enforce this reform which, in the eyes of the general, piublic consti tuted an unwarranted interference with a long standing sacred custom. The Council continued receiving its monthly budget of Rials 20,000 though very irregularly. SECTION 4. Military and Marine. 'Army .—In May Brigadier General Ibrahim Zand, the Officer Com manding the Ears Division, visited Bushire on inspection. The Recruiting Officer reopened with its usual members, namely the Governor as President, the Assistant Governor as the President of the Municipality, a local priest, two local merchants, a military doctor, and a local one. Its branches also reopened fn the district. The names of youths who had attained military age were announced, the exemption papers of others were examined, and some 300 youths were sent from Bushire to Khorramshahr to join the Iranian Navy. Fifty of these, however, were sent back as unfit for service there. In April the Military Authorities sent a local contractor and two masons to construct a Military Barracks at Jask on the site of the old British military buildings there. In November they began reducing the strength of the Bushire Garrison from 1800 to 600 and by the end of the year they had completed the work and placed the Garrison under the command of a Major named Qotbi. ^Disarmament of Tribes .—The Military Authorities continued with severity to disarm the tribes and peasantry in Dashti, Dashtistan and Tangistan. Unless arms were produced when demanded flogging and heavy fines were inflicted on persons suspected to be in possession of them. As a result of these methods two deputations of Tangistanis and Dashtis came into Bushire and complained against the Military Authorities and their methods in collecting arms. It was, however, heard from time to time that Tangistanis or Dashtis imported small consignments of arms and ammunitions for themselves or their clients in other districts. Throughout the year some 160 rifles and a small quantity of ammunition were collected and delivered to the Military Authorities in Bushire. Navy. —Lieut.-Colonel Ghulam Ali Bayandor (not Ghulam Hussain Bayandor as mentioned in last year’s Administration Report) continued m command of the Iranian Navy throughout the year. In January the sloops “Babr” and “Palang” went to Bombay for dr} docking and returned in March. In May the “Palang” visited Hen jam and Basidu and established a small Naval post at each of these ports. Each post consists of 12 men under a petty officer. Continuing their efforts to check the smuggling of contraband goods the undermentioned ships of the Iranian Navy seized the following: Sloop “Palang”—1 dhow and some pieces of cotton cloth, Rials 20,000 and Rs. 300 in coin. XJun-boats “Chahrokh” and “Shahbaz”—7 dhows, 605 packages piece goods 10 boxes tea, 20 bags suggar and Rials 170,0 in coin. ptei. ^ml) store -file year, fd wd b gW tie yea ^anabi-wi fiom Amsten Fid Batavia FmAmsterc From Batavia lit ft July s westward p 1 in nin ifeiedy, Pi liteResiden t until anSECTION 5. aviation. ^ AJJ. v UJLJ i.

Iranian Side .—37 private British aviators passed through Bushire during the year. French and Dutch .—The Air France maintained their weekly service throughout the year. The Royal Dutch Air Lines with effect from the 12th June began a bi-weekly service Eastwards and Westwards as under: — From Amsterdam to Batavia Friday at . . . . 6*25 a.m. From Batavia to Amsterdam Saturday . . . . 3*30 p.m. From Amsterdam to Batavia Monday .... 6-45 a.m. From Batavia to Amsterdam Tuesday .... 3’00 p.m. On the 17th July one of their airliners caught fire while taking off on her journey westward. The plane with her mail was completely destroyed, but her crew 4 in number and 6 passengers escaped without severe injury. Miss Kennedy, Principal Matron of the Northern Command, India, who received head injuries was treated by the Residency Surgeon and was put up by the Secretary to the Political Resident. Of the rest some were fixed up in the Residency and some by the Agent of the Imperial Bank of Iran, Bushire, until a relief air liner arrived here, and they left on the 19th. As a result of the severe disarmament measures carried out by the Iranian Military officials in Dashtistan, Tangistan, Dashti, and Daiiki, a large number of malefactors fled to the mountains, some in protest against surrendering their rifles and some to escape the punishment or their misdeeds. Thfvu- im.rripd nut raids upon villages and caravans kii mg SECTION 6. Political Situation.In February ballot papers received from Tehran were sent by His Excellency the Governor to Dashti, Dashtistan, Tangistan and down ports with instructions to officials concerned to see that Haji Muhammad Reza Eehbehani and Shukrullah Safavi, the Editor of the Tehran newspaper the “Kushish” were elected as Deputies to the Majlis and a few voting papers allowed to rival candidates in the ballot boxes by way of camouflage. As a result Safavi was elected by 20793 and Haji Muhammad Reza by 20667. Two other so-called competitors received 1144 and 347 votes. In the middle of June a law abolishing the Iranian head-dress, the “Pahlevi” cap and replacing it by the European brimmed type of head-wear was enforced in Bushire. The local officials and J^he Police helped in carry ing the law into effect. The Police forced hat-makers to make nothing but- sun-helmets and caps: merchants were given facilities to import sufficient quantities of sun helmets and felt hats to meet the local requirements. The Amnieh (Road Guard Forces) took similar steps in the country. In a short time a medley of head-gear varying from the local made sun-helmet, casques, not unlike those worn by halberdiers in Mediaeval Europe, “gorblimey” caps and harlequin cricket caps were seen being worn in the town., The drastic measures taken in July against a rising initiated by some priests in Meshed to oppose the introduction of the new head-dress and the vigilance exercised by the Authorities to nip in the bud any further commotion against the reform deterred everyone from grumbling openly at the change. In fact a Sayed Musavat of Borazjan who had spoken against the reform was arrested and sent to Shiraz for trial and punishment there. Later on steps were taken to pave the way for discarding the veil. Schoof girls and mistresses were ordered to go about unveiled. By the end of the year nobody was seen wearing the old Pahlevi cap and school girls were going about unveiled and without their “Chaddars” (shrouds). Japanese Activities .—On 3rd March the S.S. “Alaska Maru” of the Shosen Kaisha Osaka (Osaka Mercantile Steamship Co., Ltd., Japan) arrived at Bushire and at a meeting pre-arranged through the Agents of the Company in Bushire, the Captain met, on board his boat, some 40 local merchants and officials. He informed his guests that this visit was a prelude to the inauguration of a regular service between Japan and Iran. A month after the departure of Mr. H. Matsushimi mentioned in para graph 5, Section B, Visitors, above, the local weekly the “Khalij-i-Iran” published the news that the Japanese had obtained a concession for 50 years from the Iranian Government to export rock salt from Qishm Island with a minimum annual tonnage of 300,000 to be lightered to Japanese steamers anchoring off Hen jam. The newspaper added that a party of Japanese with an Interpreter would pass through shortly to Qishm Island to begin work there, but up to the end of the period under review nothing had been done in this connection.

RYAN, Major, Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.SECTION 8. ' ! Trade and Trade facilities. General State of Trade. —No improvement in trading conditions was noticeable in 1935 as compared with the previous year. Business eenerX was still severely hampered by Government restrictions and the evlr grow ing number of monopolies created by the Government is slowly but surX driving the small trader out of existence. ' y surely, The unfortunate consumer suffers under the weight of this regime of monopolies and prohibitions as the cost of living rises in proportion The import of certain articles is prohibited withoSt warning irrespective of whether a local substitute is available. Even if it is the quality is poo and the cost high Everything is being sacrificed to the rapid industrmli- financia 0 ! dominaGon 7 ^ emanC1 P ation from economic and The smuggling of goods into Iran continued on a considerable scale during the year. Every month the preventive authorities seized consignments of such goods but failed to stop the traffic. The maintenance of high import duties puts a correspondingly heavy premium on the traffic and the smuggler sees in it a golden goose waiting to be plucked. In an effort to stop the smuggling at least of sugar the retail price was reduced and a syndicate of Bushire merchants formed to market it. This has the effect of practically stopping the smuggling of this article by making it unremunera- tive to do so. Nevertheless the practice continues to flourish and represents a considerable loss to the revenue. Exports fell off greatly in the spring owing to the sudden and sharp appreciation in the value of the rial and in order to counteract this as far as possible the price of export certificates which had up to then been 9 per cent, buying and 13^ per cent, selling was raised to 25 per cent, buying and 30 per cent, selling. In August the cost of these certificates fell to 10 per cent, and 15 per cent, respectively when the rial again depreciated. These sudden variations in price exposed both exporters and importers to increased risk of loss and rendered private trading practically a gamble. United Kingdom trade continues to decline mainly in the piece goods line at the expense of Japan. It is likely to diminish still further in the future as a result of the import monopoly instituted by the Government. Imports from British India are also on the down grade. They had already been hard hit by Japanese competition in the piece goods section and to make matters worse the import of these goods is now a Government mono poly. Moreover the import of cotton yarns the bulk of which India used to supply is now prohibited. Imports of tea still come mainly from India but the quantity has decreased lately at the expense of the Dutch a,nd Japanese. As a result of these factors the future prospects for Indian trade with the Gulf area are not bright. Japan continued to dominate the market with her cotton piece goods and is steadily increasing her imports of other goods as well such as glass ware, haberdashery, cement etc., Japan's greatest attacking weapon in her campaign of commercial penetration in Iran is of course cheapness and in this respect her position appears to be unassailable. That is the crux of the whole situation from the point of view of British exporters. The balance of trade however is preponderantly in favour of Japan as she buys practically nothing from Iran. But this difficulty may soon be overcome to a certain extent by the exploitation by Japan oi the salt mines on Qishm Island. It will certainly help to solve the question of return freights for Japanese steamers. As a result of the trade agreement between fran and the Soviet Union which was concluded in August it is expected that Soviet imports into Iran 'will increase. They had been steadily decreasing for some years previously owing to economic disputes between ithe two countries. Imports of cotton Piece goods from the Soviet Union are likely to increase probably at the expense of Japan since there is no marked difference in price between them. 225(0) F&amp;PD10 In fact the Soviet Union expects to recapture under this agreement the trade previously lost. Of the other countries importing goods into Iran Germany is main taining her position. She competes with British importers in most lines. Her trade with Iran is expected to be facilitated by an agreement concluded with Iran in October regarding commercial payments by means of a clearing office. Under this agreement import licences will be issued for German goods without the production of the corresponding export certi ficates. At the moment however Germany’s proportion of the total imports into Iran is small. Italian trade with Iran has received a severe blow from the imposition of an embargo by the Iranian Government on all imports from .Italy. This embargo was imposed towards the end of the year in connection with the Italo-Abyssinian conflict. It is likely however to P rove a /7 0 , e , dged sword in the event of Italy retaliating in view of the fact that the balance of trade is considerably in favour of Iran. Other countries especially Japan may be expected to take advantage of this factor to capture Italy s trade with Iran. Financial.—There is no improvement in the financial situation com pared with the previous year and money continues to be scarce. The population still has to bear the burden of crushing taxation of all kinds which together with the restrictive effect on private enterprise of the foreign trade monopoly effectively rules out all possibility of investments in private industrial and business ventures, and no relief from this burden is in sight. On the contrary the tendency appears to be m the direction ot a still heavier burden in view of the continued high cost of the trans-Iran railway now under construction which swallows up more and more money as time goes on, as well as increasing expenditure on military equipment. Importers find it increasingly difficult to carry on successful!) under such circumstances and there is a growing tendency on their part to invest their working capital in state monopolies as being a better paying proposi tion and in order to lessen the risk of loss. The situation was complicated still further in April by the high price of silver which rose to 36^ pence per ounce in that month as a result of the action of the United States of America in offering 71 cents per ounce. This had the effect of forcing the rial-sterling exchange rate to 52 rials to the £1. Exports at such a rate became almost impossible and the smuggling abroad of silver rials took place on a large scale. In fact it is estimated that about 400,000 to 500,000 silver rials had been illegally exported from Bushire and district by the end of the year. As if their actual worries were not enough merchants and others were thus faced with a scarcity of small change in the market and still more money was withdrawn from circulation. The situation was however ultimately eased by the issue of copper coins ot small denomination. h In spite of all these difficulties there were no bankruptcies in Bushire during the year. Bushire merchants for the most part limited their activities to forwarding business which probably enabled them to remain solvent. January February March April May June July .

This compares favourably with the prices ruling in the preceding year i.e., £128 to £130 per case f. o. b. Bushire. In spite of this however exports of opium to the Far East remained practically the same during the year under review as in 1934. A representative of the monopoly was sepcially sent to China and Japan on two occasions to enquire into this lack of demand and to try and stimulate sales. Their efforts apparently met with little success. The question of price seems to be the stumbling block rather than lessened demand and if the Monopoly Department wishes to increase its sales to the Far East it will have to reduce prices still further. Apart from the shipments mentioned above a consignment of 500 cases was shipped from Bushire in October and suspected to be for illegimate consumption. The opium was loaded on board a Japanese steamer named the “Manju Maru” and consigned to the Far East. \ Exchange rates. —Average rates of exchange during 1935 which were 78 rials and 5-83 rials per £1 and rupee respectively remained practically the same as those of the preceding year. At the commencement of the year under review they stood at 74 rials to the pound sterling and 6-04 rials per rupee. There was a marked appreciation in the value of the rials in the spring when the rate rose to 53 rials to the £1 and 4*33 rials per rupee. This however proved to be only a temporary improvement and the rate steadily declined until by the end of the year it was 90 rials and 6-51 rials to the pound and rupee respectively. Communications and Transport .—The British India Steam Navigation Company maintained its usual services of fast and slow mail steamers between Persian Gulf ports and India during the year, and enjoys practi cally a monopoly of this traffic. Besides the above service there are monthly services of cargo steamers operated by the Strick, Hansa (German) and Ellerman and Bucknall steam ship lines. These steamers carry freight between Europe and Persian Gulf ports. The Italian Lloyd Triestino Company runs a service of cargo vessels to the Gulf ports every two months. A new service was inaugurated at the beginning of the year, i.e., the Osaka Shosen Kaisha Line ^ 1C ^ maintains a monthly service between the Far East and Gulf ports. ere have been rumours of the inauguration of yet another line etween e Netherlands East Indies and Gulf ports but this has not yet materialised. Internal transport was undertaken more and more by motor cars and wries in spite of the low freight rates ruling. In fact the motor ve ic t as completely ousted the time, honoured donkey as a means of ^ sp xcept for those narrow tracks where motors cannot pass. p . 3 still subject to floods in winter with the result that Bushire iscut o^ eriodically from the interior. The road from Bushire to Shiraz continues o deteriorate and is in an appalling condition; up to e en o y o attempt had been made to improve it.^ 12 The Dutch air service (K. L. M.) now maintains a bi-weekly service in both directions between Holland and the Dutch East Indies via the Persian Gulf. The planes call at Bushire and Jask. The French air line ^Air France) also runs a weekly service via Bushire between France and Indo-China. These air lines carry passengers and mails. There is still no infernal air service in spite of rumours that one was to be inaugurated during the year. FRANK H.

The summer was one of the longest and hottest on record, and it was almost as trying to the natives of Bushire as it was to foreign residents. The hot weather commenced in May and it did not begin to cool down until the end of October. From June onwards the humidity was constantly high and there was very little difference between the day and night temperatures. No diseases appeared in epidemic form. The number of indoor patients and out-door attendances m comparison with those of 1934, were as follows :— 1934 1935 In-patients 22 6 Out-patients.

Quiet prevailed throughout the year and government con tinued to extend its authority in the Province. Conditions. —Efforts towards “westernization flavour to the Nationalist diet of the people. The “Pahlevi cap worn throughout the country was superseded by the European hat. Orders were received from the capital in June, that all officials must discard this cap and it was soon evident that the decree was to be imposed upon all classes. The European hat or cap were in general use at the end of July. To this end the officials and military adopted measures not provided for in the Constitution. Applicants at Government offices were refused admission unless wearing the “international” hat. This ban was extended to the unshaved. The Police at the town gates collected the caps of the villagers which were subsequently burnt in the bakers’ ovens. For some days military patrols in the streets and bazaars tore off and cut up the “Pahievi” caps of the people. The “mujtehid” and others holding permits to wear the “ ’imameh ” (turban) were called upon in October to deposit their permission at the Governorate General for inspection. Three of these permits only had been returned by the end of the year. The measures for the unveiling of women are becoming strict. Orders were received from the capital in the second part of the year that school girls and their teachers must discard the “chuddur”. These orders were not rigidly enforced at first and it was believed that an extension had been given to the teachers until after the summer holidays. A physical drill display by unveiled girls under 17 years of age held at the annual schools prize giving before the Minister of Education in April led to an open telegram of protest to the Shah by the aged and fanatic Sheikh Ja’afar Mahalatti and the more rabid Sheikh Seyyid Nur-ed-din. Swift retribution followed when the Governor-General received orders from His Majesty to inflict punishment at his discretion upon the peti tioners, his sentence to require no confirmation. The Governor-General was able to let off both the religious dignataries with a severe reprimand but a monthly allowance paid to the senior out of “waqf” fundk was stopped and allocated to the schools. In December the department of Education received fresh orders that the “chuddur” must be discarded at the schools. The announcement of the execution at Meshed of the Naib-ut-Towlieh (official custodian of the Shrine) Mohammed Wali Assadi, found guilty by a court martial ot fomenting the disturbances there against the change of men s head gear in July, appears to have been taken advantage of by the authorities to enforce the unveiling of women. Officials were ordered that their women must appear in public without the “chuddur” and a test was made at a reception given by the Governor General on December 30t ^ on , of the arrival at Shiraz of the Minister of Finance^ The only lady to ignore this order was the wife of Sultan Hussein ( a ) immediate director of the Finance Department, and her action suspension of her husband and his recall to Tehran. The unveiling of the women has been pressed on steal 7^. p or ment officials have received an allowance for the p c i nem as hotels their families. Admission of women in / c “ r vph fJ” S ’ ’ etc., is forbidden and thev may s f or the officers, attended military officer and his wlfe eKo^nrvlino have ordered the fading The senior b S 0 w ves in European dress and the nolice have o^der, landowners, merchants, traders, etc., to follow this example.Apart from the mere well-to-do and educated classes these measures are proving very irksome and difficult for the women and especially those of middle age. The cost of European clothing also is almost prohibitive for persons from the middle classes downwards. The enforcement of these regulations in the winter, when the cost of European dress is heavier, is believed to be due to the desire to secure the change-over by next spring, when the visit of the Ghazi Ataturk is expected. The measures are creating another class of discontented to join the ulema, hitherto the only one to have been seriously affected by the turn towards the West. Another effort of Europeanisation was made on March 15th when on the anniversary of the birthday of the Shah a carnival procession of dressed lorries, with mast attendants, paraded through the town. Orders were issued to the officials early in the year that they must treat the public with politeness. Instructions were also received from the capital that officials and others must become familiarised with the air of the National Anthem so that they should stand to attention whenever it is played. Further efforts were made this year during the month of Muharrem to abolish religious practices at that season. The public was informed that a police premit was required for breast-beating in the open and the “Ruzeh khwan” were at first prohibited from reading and reciting prayers in the streets. This order was subsequently relaxed to a certain extent in the bazaars. There were no incidents affecting foreigners but the attitude of the officials towards them is unchanged. Every alien, the reason of whose visit is not understood, is a potential danger to the State. Security .—Public security was good during the year but a small number of highway robberies took place in the remoter districts. A brigand captured with arms was tried by court martial and executed in March 5 Lashani tribesmen wanted for brigandage were captured by the Amnieh in May and handed over to the military authorities. 17 Khamseh tribesmen were brought into Shiraz in June by the mili tary. They are said to have been captured as an armed band operating in the district about 100 miles East of Fasa. In the town of Shiraz there were the usual number of burglaries. One gang, most of the members of which were eventually arrested, specialised in breaking into the houses of British Subjects, and succeeded in robbing the Bank houses, Mr. R. J. Cross and from the house of Mr. Vice-Consul Barnett in his absence. The effects stolen from Mr. Barnett led to their arrest. Officials. —H. E. Ali Akbar (Khan) Davar, Minister of Finance, visited Shiraz in January and December. The tours appear to have been undertaken for the exploration of fresh sources of revenue. H. E. Ali Asghar (Khan) Hikmat, the Minister of Education visited Shiraz in April. H. E. Nizam-ud-din (Khan) Hikmat, Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, was at Shiraz in July. H. E. Mohammed Ali (Khan) Furughi, Zuka-ul-Mulk, President of the Council of Ministers, accompanied by H. E. Mahmud (Khan) Jam, Minister of the Interior and by the heads of the departments of Agri culture and of Industry, was at Shiraz in October for the official opening of the government sugar factory at Marvdasht. These visits are believed to show that the Shah is taking greater interest in the welfare of the more distant provinces. ,ndL ha |Seflii ruI - from jiini*! 1 ! 1 10 tjeti’s Cons da lifare upon 3 to tie Ba: | iyiioldcitaih Ins im Godd isEisiilted i itsjH a ■life, -Tie i return f Selection ^ stiahutlori fey-Th ikl 193o) . n, Sartip M to tier IDimon jp and one is) of inft Itfnlstren liolofN JCadet scha ’^r (Lieut siiaie and fccallin M Guard' ■4nerr bl&lt;21 t r ed H “S assani ' “ AUgUSt —Wed by a sent H.

It is thought that his immediate task will the to complete the roads in Azerbaiian and Mazandaran before the arrival in the spring of the Ghazi Ataturk. His departure is a loss to the Province which has benefitted much under his administration. He is an honest, capable and hardworking official and a person of understanding. The relations between him and His Majesty’s Consul were excellent. His successor has not yet reached Shiraz. Municipality and Town Improvements. —The budget of the Munici pality for the next year has been assessed at Rials 1,820,000 (£25,000). In shiraz it has been decided to extend the Zand Avenue (the broad thoroughfare upon which His Majesty’s Consulate is situated) right through to the Bazar-i-Wakil. This work will require cutting through the Arq or oldcitadel, formerly the Governorate General offices. Monsieur Goddard of the Ministry of Education was at Shiraz in July and was consulted upon works of reconstruction of the Tomb of Hafiz and of the Masjid-i-Wakil. Majliss. —The elections to the Xth Majliss, held early in the year, showed the return for Shiraz of the five deputies sitting in the last assembly. This election was a foregone conclusion, after their nomination through the central authorities. Military .—The Ears Brigade acquired Divisional status at No Ruz (22nd March 1935) and is now known as the Lashkar Numere HafC (Viltii Division). Sartip Ibrahim (Khan) Zandieh continues as G.

The Division consists of three regiments of infantry, two regiments of cavalry and one regiment of artillery with the two indepen en gor (battalions) of infantry at Bushire and Ear respective y.

Statistics are not available. Skins —The lambskin trade was very dull throughout the year, the only buyers being the Soviets Trading Agency. The London market showed renewed interest at the end of the year and contracts for over £10,000 for lambskins were carried out. Gums .—Gum tragacanth was in good demand during the year, not only for London, but for America, Continental and Japanese buyers and large orders were filled. Prices for the better qualities rose and the high average exchange of the £1, enabled exporters to pay good prices. Shipments of Gum Arabic were fair. Almond Kernels .—The usual small quantities exported increased largely on the imposition of sanctions against Italy and quantities were drawn not only by London and India but by the Spanish markets, presu mably for re-export under their label. Economic Conditions.-The™ was no improvement ,n the economic condition of the Province of Pars. Tightness of money, with the dram of taxation and the trade restrictions were more severe. At seasons there was a shortage of currency which made banking and other transactions difficult. . ., , The grower has benefitted by the increased and fixed P rlces ^ government and the trading companies for produce b u t nhle to demand higher prices m years of small yields. Meanwtuie ms purchasinTpower has increased to the benefit of government which wall derive the' profit as the largest shareholder m the more important trading -The road tax of Rials 100 (£1-5-0) per mensem on motor cars was abolished early in the year, when an additional tax was impo on petrol and kerosene. A new tax of 3 per centum nd valorem upon all agricultural produce, navable on entry into consuming centres, replaced the land tax which' it S been foundl difficult to collect. The collection of the new tax has not worked too smoothly, especially upon produce in transit which in practice is liable to fresh payment at other centres. Facilities were given to land owners for payment of arrears of the land tax All fines for non-paymen have been waived and periods of grace of from two and a half to years have been given for the payment of the arrears. The tax of Rials 3 (about-/l(W.) formerly levied on lambskins has been abolished. . . , j. £ u Cost oi livinct. —In June there was a sharp rise in the cost of all local commodltiei brefd, rice, ghee, charcoal, etc , owing to goyernmen and municipal taxation upon agricultural produce. Appeals to the central government by the Governor-General succeeded in securing a return to normal prices in the ensuing two months. Exchange.—With the rise in the value of silver, attempts were made by the National Bank of Iran to force down the £1, which reached the low exchange of Rials 54. The market realized conditions and there were heavy speculative pur chases of sterling which forced the Bank out of the bidding as their sterling reserves became exhausted. VC&amp; — Sterling soon stood at Rials 75 per £1, again and rose steadily to Rials 35 and over, standing at nearly Rials 90 at the end of the year. Supar Factory .—The government sugar factory erected at Marvdasht, on the/Shiraz-Persepolis road, near the Band-i-Amir river, was opened officially in the name of the Shah by the Prime Minister in October. The water channels to the river were completed later when the pumping machinery was installed. , i;.j STS of beetra to 45,00 T&lt; toll. ind M' (Sh rtipal sbarf iof the year, Ian Broth ngupi :iof Shiraz. 5 , iron and ste •.iBskreholde 5# it.

The crop of the year is estimated at from Kharvars 40,000 to 45,000 (Tons 11,450 to 13,000). The yield of the beet is about 18 per centum, allowing for a production of 2,300 Tons of sugar in cubes and crystals. Quality is white and good. But it is not appreciated as the people are accustomed to a coarse and slow melting sugar. The sugar produced! by the end of the year was given at 1,000,000 kilograms (about 980 Tons) of crystals and at 100,000 kilograms (about 90 Tons) of cube sugar. Prices fixed by government were Rials 12'90 per man Tabriz (6! lbs.) for cube sugar and Rials 12-00 per man Tabriz (6i lbs.) for crystals. Cotton Spinning Mills .—The Cotton spinning mill of the Pars Manu facturing Company (Shirkat-i-Sahami-i-Nasaji-i-Fars) which began work in June 1934, has proved successful and a dividend of 20 per centum was declared this year. The profits of the first year’s working are believed to have reached 50 per centum. The principal shareholder is now Khalil Beg, Nasir Zadeh, a wealthy Khorassan merchant. A second Mirelees Diesel engine, 175 klw., 260 B. H. P. was installed at the end of the year, as a reserve to the first power engine, by the same firm, which had been working for over nine months on double shifts.

The “hazzari” was an estimate of the area under cultivation, made by the inspectors of the Monopoly Department, for the purpose of control of production. It was a source of constant friction between growers and the department. Growers were also informed that government was prepared to buy-in all quantities of opium offered to the Monopoly department, provided that the product was separated into quantities fit for export and for local consumption only. In addition to providing a ready sale for growers, this measure was a determined attempt to stamp out “contraband 5 ’ opium (undeclared stocks held by growers) and prices were fixed for the purchase of the chuneh and the “lul”, without inquiries as to date and place of production, up to February 19th, 1935. All undeclared quantities held by producers, etc., after that date are considered as “smuggled and high rewards are obtain able by informers reporting their existence. Rials 300,000 (£4,000) in advances to the growers were authorised by the Minister of Finance in January. The assistance given to growers has encouraged sowings and the crop for the year 1936 should be a heavy one, with favourable weather conditions. It is difficult to see how government reconciles the above measures with their promises to limit the production of the drug. It is said that Iran has been encouraged in this policy by the increased production and sale of opium in Turkey. Negotiations took place with Japan for purchases of opium. Irrigation. —The endeavours to increase the water supplies of Fars and district of Shiraz appear to have been discontinued owing to lack of funds. The project to improve irrigation in the Ramjerd Area with the waters of the Band-i-Amir has not been proceeded with. It. was however reported that the Minister of Finance had undertaken to recommend the grant of Rials 3,000,000 (£40,000) for the construction of the above barrage and for other works in this province. Experts were sent to this province to report upon the possibility of sinking artesian wells and are believed to have reported favourably. Horse Breeding—A grant of Rials 100,000 (£1,300) was made by gov ernment for the establishment of a stud farm. It is hoped to interest horse owners in the improvement of horse breeding. Races were organised by the Military authorities in June on orders from the capital. Cattle disease. —Some 200 animals were attacked by anthrax in the Sarvistan area in September. The immediate surroundings of Shiraz enjoy a certain immunity from this disease owing to the salts contained in the waters. Communications. —The new road from Kazarun to Behbehan was re ported to be open in October. The crossing of the river still presents difficulty excepting in the dry season. No work was carried out on the Shiraz-Firuzabad-Bushire road, beyond some repairs on the short Shiraz-Pol-i-Fasa section. There^is much oppo sition to the completion of this road by the merchants of Kazarun. National Bank of Iran. —The contract of Herr Rudolf Fricke, the German branch manager at Shiraz, was terminated in April. He was suc ceeded by an Iranian. Requisitions. —There were some requisitions of motor transport at Shiraz, including three lorries belonging to foreign subjects. The transport was required to proceed to the marble quarries near Yezd to load marble for the new municipal palace at Tehran. The effect of these requisitions was to drive lorries off the Isfahan- Shiraz road and a sharp rise in transport rates followed.27 rt&amp;Jg&amp;S?' w “ * ” “&gt;* —— , ^® ner f.^ at Shiraz was away during most of the year and the offices oi the Trading Agency were closed down. A member of the head omce of the Trading Organisation has visited Shiraz from time to time tor purchases of lambskins and gum tragacanth. Surveys. —Mr. William Browne, surveyor of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, set out from Shiraz at the end of November for a survey of the S. E. districts of the Province. Church Missionary Society .—The Right Reverend Bishop Linton, 13. D. Bishop in Persia, visited Shiraz in June to take farewell before leaving Iran to take up a fresh appointment at home. He is succeeded by the Right Reverend Bishop W. J. Thompson, formerly Archdeacon and Principal of the Stuart Memorial College at Isfahan, recently consecrated Bishop in Persia. Four candidates were presented by the Stuart Memorial College at Isfahan for the matriculation examinations of the University of London held at Isfahan in June. Of these only one was successful. Dr. J. A. Martin, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. arrived at Shiraz at the end of the year for duty at the Church Missionary Society Hospital at Shiraz. He has over ten years service in India with the Society. Sport .—A football team from the capital visited Shiraz during the summer and matches were played with the newly formed local team. A local tennis club was formed at Shiraz. Archeological.—Monsiem Goddard of the Ministry of Education was at Shiraz early in the year when a division of the finds at Persepohs was made between the Iranian Government and the Oriental Institute ot Chicago. Professor J. Upham Pope was at Persepolis in the month of May. Professor E. Hertsfeld, the field director at Persepohs proceeded on leave early in the year. He did not return and was succee e ' ' .' » Schmidt, a naturalised American citizen. Hr. Schmidt is m charge also^of the works at Rey and in Luristan. He moves between Hertzfeld plane.

Several houses were searched, and fines amounting to over Rials, 60,000 (about £700) were collected from those found in possession on contraband articles, although in some cases the goods were old or the owners produced their Customs receipts. Secret Agents were employed to report smugglers. Reports were received from Dubai and Bahrein of Dhows loading contraband cargo for Iranian Ports. When the order prohibiting the use of the Pahlevi hat came into force in July, the Customs had orders to pass European hats without the necessary import permits. A sum equivalent to the value had to be depo sited. In the month of July, a Customs Motor Boat fired at a Dhow landing passengers between Bustano and Pohl (Clarence Strait) and wounded a man. The man was brought to Bandar Abbas and received medical treat ment and recovered. The Custom notified the public in August that anyone caught smuggling gold or silver out of the country would be shot, no matter how small a quantity was smuggled. There was a great fall in the Customs revenue during the first four months of the present Iranian year (1314) as the import of Yarn and cotton piece goods, the chief imports of Bandar Abbas, were forbidden. The examination of passengers’ luggage has been very strict and heavy duty is charged on small article. Aqayi Ali Amini, the e#-mudir of Charbar committed suicide at Kishm on 19th September and his body was brought to Bandar Abbas for burial. The export of cotton was prohibited from the 4th Mehr (27th Septem ber) and a Company has been formed to deal in cotton. A consignment of 1800 bales cotton was cleared from the Customs and shipped to Germany. Owing to this the price of cotton rose from Rials 8,_to Rials 14 per batman. Five Baluchis suspected of smuggling were arrested and sent to Bandar Abbas from Sirik in the month of October. 4. Finance Department .—Mirza Mohamed Ali Khan Zand held charge till 9th December 1935. He was accused of helping Seyed Abbas Dashty to export more Red Oxide from Hormuz than was shown in the permits and has been suspended. Aqayi Wazien took over on 10th December 1935. His Excellency Mirza Ali Akbar Khan Dawar, Minister of Finance visited Bandar Abbas in February. During his stay he received the local merchants and traders. He said he was shocked at the filthy and miser able condition of the town and said improvements should be made at once. He promised Government aid. He recommended Jhe formation of compa nies to buy sugar wholesale from Government and to sell it at a fair profit to the public, ’fihe price of sugar was reduced to Rials 7 a batman for crystal and Rials 8 a batman for loaf. The Finance Minister ordered the Customs to hand over the Wharfage tax (15 dinars per package) to the Municipality, and said the Customs were to maintain the pier out of their own budget. Rials 9^000 the balance with the Customs, was transferred to the Municipality. The Finance Minister said he would try to allot a sum of Rials 100,000 annually for the improve ment of the condition and sanitation of the town and to establish a proper Municipal hospital. He amalgamated the Malieh office with the Customs. This has been of great benefit to poor villagers who had to deal with the former. With this amalgamation the extortion of money from the poor has ended. The Ministry issued telegraphic instructions to the Customs, that, with effect from the 9th June, the cost of loaf and soft sugar for the interior (beyond the coastal Area) was to be reduced from Rials 17-50 and 15-45 to Rials 13-20 and 12-60 respectively. lislirafi, Ch itcCliarbar in lEAixjarry, jjdtriD II Sha allftalaf B ^ Island in A i last sixmoi ■^addressees, i interfered ?#( Departm i Department i-Setran II iaai held ch fh Guards ilii Janua it, who hel aitiRak ail March, to Teh: tShahab, 0: nto of ins] all June, -uFronth 'tone of 1 •Aland a' frontier ^tas, ^thichhe ^ on theMirza Mohamed All Khan Golsha lyan arriwi f iaspection, on the 6th and proceeded to Charbar ™ th fr 0 T, ® ushi re, on returned on the 4th April and left for Tehran on the^tlf* Mareh ' He 5.

Sargord Safavi, the ^-officer commanding, Frontier Guards, was ordered to inspect Jask and Charbar before his return to Tehran. He left bandar Abbas on the 8th February and was brought back to Bandar Abbas under escort in March. He had become insane as a result of venereal dise ase. He went to Tehran in May. Servan Shahab, Officer Commanding Frontier Guards, Bandar Abbas, went on a tour of inspection to Charbar and returned by land via Jask and Minab in June. In June, a Frontier Guard at Sirik (Beyaban) at the instigation of his sergeant, shot one of his comrades who had refused to join in the division ol some contraband articles, which the guards had seized from certain smugglers. The sergeant and the guard were arrested and brought to bandar Abbas. Another frontier guard, by name of Abul, was arrested and brought to Bandar Abbas. Abnl was found with two trunks containing contra- oand articles which he declared belonged to an officer who was not in station. 7.

Slave Traffic .—No slave sought asylum at this Consulate during the year under report. 19. Trade and Commerce .—The trade of Bandar Abbas continues to decrease. The majority of the merchants are clearing and forwarding agents for the business houses of Yezd or Kerman. The formation of the Monopoly Companies and the prohibition of the import of many articles, especially piece goods, and the prohibitive duties on other goods have brought the import and export trade almost to a standstill. 20. Political. —The town remained quiet throughout the year. Ill-feel ing was aroused by the Government orders to wear European hats and for women to discard their veils. Government have been sufficiently powerful to enforce their orders and prevent outbreaks. 21. Economic Conditions. —Owing to better rainfall during the year, there was no shortage of drinking water for the townspeople during the summer months. The crops in the surrounding districts were fairly plentiful, and prices 111 bazaar were not unreasonably high. 22. Security. —Ghulam Shah, an outlaw, was granted a free pardon and ft reward of Rials 100 for giving himself up. He returned home, and tried to induce Mirza, an accomplice, to give himself up. The Districts of Minab and Beyaban were disturbed in February and . ^ as unsafe for travellers even during the day. Many dacoities were car ried out. A number of thefts were reported during the date harvest, when People leave their homes to go to the date plantations. Three cases of highway robbery were reported. A Postal Clerk with his wife were he U P and robbed of their belongings while going to the hot springs. The post from Lar was held up and looted in August. 1115 23 ' Militar y-—'^ strength of Bandar Abbas area force is said to be arhang Abdul Hussain Khan Saqafi was Officer Co , m “ anding | area throughout the year.

It is said that, in April, in a fight between a Government force and Bashakardi outlaws, eleven soldiers were killed and one of the two wounded soldiers brought from Minab died in the Military hospital at Bandar Abbas. Sarhang paid frequent visits to Minab and Jask during the month of .A-pri! - Sarhang II Arab Nezad, the e#-officer commanding, Bandar Abbas left for Khorasan in April. Amir, a boy outlaw, was found guilty by the Military and was shot. ^Tbp town garrison left for the hill station of Genu in June and r6~ turned in September. Sargord Safar AH Khan Nosrat, the Military Governor for Bashakard left Minab via Jeeruft for Tehran in July, with the intention of retiring, as he had no hopes of promotion. The local Military Authorities, in September, asked for tenders for the supply of about 300 tons of steel beams for new Military Barracks, now under construction at Naibund. Moin Khan (Bahadur Nizam) has been appointed Raise Amnieh Rudbar with a salary of Rials, 1,000. He has also been supplied with arms and ammunition by the Government. Sarhang Saqafi accompanied him to Jaghin to see the famous outlaw Abdul Hussain Kameran. The latter having heard of Moin Khan’s agreement with Government has agreed to submit on certain terms. Sarhang Saqafi proceeded to Sirj an in November and returned via Jaghin and Manujan. He also paid a visit to Minab in December. Conscription .—365 conscripts were discharged and 300 were enlisted during the month of Mehr (24th September-23 Oct.). 24. Mines .—Aqayi Nasrullah Khan, Jehangir, Director of the Petro leum Department, and Agha Babaoff Armenian, Technical Adviser to the Ministry of Finance, Tehran, arrived in January and visited the mines. They returned to Tehran after receiving tenders from Khan Sahib Ebrahim Gelladary to wT&gt;rk the mines for Government. The local Finance Depart ment has deputed a clerk to take over the excavated Red Oxide from the deputy of Haji Moin who died in 1933. Mirza Mustafa Khan Kohbud arrived from Tehran on 8th March to supervise the shipment of the first consignment of 3,000 tons of Red Oxide to United Kingdom, per s.s. Tabaristan in March. He was formerly em ployed by the late Haji Moin, and on his death when the mines were seized by the Government, he managed to get himself appointed Government Bro ker for Red Oxide. It is said that he despatched samples of red oxide to thirteen different countries. He went to Lingah on the 18th March to inspect the red oxide mines of Bustanah near Lingah, and submitted a report to Tehran. Mr. Boman Irani, who has a business in Hong Kong has obtained the sole Monopoly rights of red oxide for Indian Markets from the Iranian Government and has undertaken to purchase 2500 tons a year. On arrival he learnt that 500 tons Red Oxide had been sold to Messrs Haji Ali Akbar Shirazi of Manchester for the same market at favourable rates, so he lodged a complaint at Tehran. Herr Kramer, a German, who was connected with Wassmuss at one time, visited Hormuz in August and then went to Lingah to visit the Red Oxide Mines of Bustanah.35 JXS , o n iS r *” r ™ i “ d Hor '“ in D “- 1 *' “ ti» . 5800 tons Red Oxide was shipped to foseign countries during the year United Kidgdom 4,500 tons.

Consul, Bandar Abbas. Bandar Abbas, February 25, 1936.CHAPTER V. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF HIS MAJESTY’S CONSULATE, KERMAN, FOR THE YEAR 1935. A. BRITISH INTERESTS. 1. His Majesty's Consulate — Personnel. —Major C. H. Lincoln, O.B.E., remained, in charge of the Consulate up to the middle of November, when on his proceeding on four months’ leave, he was relieved by Captain J. E. A. Bazalgette. Major Lincoln returned from Chaxbar on the 26th March 1935 where he had been for four months, dealing with the dual nationality question of certain British Indian Subjects. A short visit was paid to Bushire and Tehran between the 21st Septem ber and 9th October. Captain J. E. A. Bazalgette paid visits to Bandar Abbas between the 18th and 23rd November to take over charge of the Bandar Abbas Consulate from Major C. H. Lincoln and between the 9th and 16th December to super vise the taking over by Mr. F. B. D’Souza from Bushire, as Head Clerk from Mr. T. M. Nicholas who proceeded on leave prior to retirement. 2. Consulate work etc .—(a) 24 British Subjects were registered at the Consulate during the year, the number for 1934 being 29. (b) Jubilee of His Late Majesty King George V. —A reception and a garden party folowed by a Cinema show was held at the Consulate at 5 p.m. on 6th May on the occasion of Their Majesty’s Siver Jubilee. The Governor- General, the Officer Commanding Kerman Brigade, the Provincial Director of Posts and Telegraphs, the Chief of Police and the Raise Baladieh and all the British and other European residents in Kerman attended. The Chief Judge and Public Prosecutor, who were also invited, with the Governor-General’s knowledge and consent, did not turn up, nor did they acknowledge the invitations. A Special Thanksgiving Service, similar to the one ordered for use in St. Paul’s Cathedral in London, was held in St. Andrew’s Church. (c) The King’s Birthday was celebrated in the usual manner on the 3rd June. An official reception was held in the forenoon and attended by the Governor-General, his assistant, the Officer Commanding Kerman Brigade, the Chiefs of Police and Municipality, and members of the British Com munity—heads of foreign firms also called. A dinner was given in the evening and attended by the first four of the Iranian officials and all the British and European residents in Kerman. (d) The Reverend R. Iliff, the Principal of the Church Missionary Society Boys’ school, and Doctor (Miss) Charis Pigott, Medical Officer in Charge of C. M. S. Women Hospital, Kerman, were married at the Consu late on the 12th November. The religious ceremony took place at the C. M. S. Church on the 26th. 3. Imperial' Bank of Iran and Trade in general .—(a) Mr. R. C. Fergusson remained in charge of the Imperial Bank of Iran during 1935. (b) The depression in the carpet business reported under this paragraph of last year continued until the late autumn of 1935. Towards the close' of the year the rate of exchange became more favourable, and the American demand for Kerman carpets increased. Prices rose 10 per cent in one month. The chief industry of the Province being carpets, the recent demand 1 rom America has had a stimulating effect on the market. It is hoped that this will continue, but much depends on the working of the Carpet Monopoly Company, which is being formed. . (0 Trade in other commodities was stagnant except for wool of which airlv large consignments were forwarded to Isfahan. Money as usual was none too plentiful.K'z 4 37 Milli to form a silver reservedl^d R to^pre^t^r^h” by the Bank ' i ' of the country and the increase of pape? money dlrTn^thf m?ddl the year resulted m a scarcity of silver and small change S This caused great hardship and inconvenience m this Province It ^ ^ { g i were purchased secretly by well-to-do merchants at 10 per cent above 'the face value The situation improved towards the end of the year when supplies of small copper coins were received from Tehran by the Bank-i- Milli. 4 Church Missionary Society, (a) General.—tU Reverend H E J Biggs handed over his duties as Chaplain to Reverend R. Iliff in November and left for the United Kingdom. An Iranian Evangelist in the employment of Church Missionarv Society was arrested for preaching at a Special Service held in the C.M 8“ Church on the Iranian New Year’s day (22nd March). The Evangelist wast fined Rials 50 and warned not to' preach ‘Propaganda’ contrary to Islam again. To avoid further trouble, the C. M. S. sent him to Isfahan. (b) Boys’ School {Dafoiristan-i-Jam). —During the year under review, the School has made considerable progress. Over 100 boys attended regu larly throughout the year, an increase of over 65 per cent. The Middle School course can now be completed, as Class XII was started during the year. His Excellency the Minister of Education inspected the school early in the year and congratulated the Principal and staff on the high standard of work shown. He promised to help wdth free teachers and by the end of the year the Educational authorities were supplying teachers for 24 periods a week. A School camp was held as usual during the summer holidays and over 30 masters and boys spent a pleasant fortnight in the hills. Games and sports of various kinds still figure largely in the life of the school and are a considerable help in the building up of character and manliness Mr. F. T. B. Snow, who was here for 4 years, has been transferred to the Stuart Memorial College at Isfahan and the Revered M. T. Lord arrived from Ireland to take his place. 1935 may be summed up as a satisfactory year in every way. (c) Girls’ School.—The school started the year with only 31 pupils. This decrease was due to the fact that it was the first year a , had been entirely of the Middle Grade, the two hig er p y ■ having been closed. The smallness of these numbers mad f r ®. open fi ^ of the school in September 1935 a very anxious tme, as it was the occasion on which the school had to depend on P U P' 3 numbers have Government schools.

He visited Shahdad but the proposa has been dropped for the time being on account of the state of the road Doctor Harrison and his party visited Kerman again during October to resume their survey of Iranian Baluchistan and Mekran. Last year they had been forced to abandon their survey owing to the refusal of the Military authorities at Bam to provide them with the necessary escort. 6. Carpet trade etc. —The following is a summary of the Kerman carpet and tribal rug Trade with the approximate values exported to United States of America and Europe during the year. The figures for the three preceding years are also shown. The value has been expressed in thousands of Rials. 1935. 1932. 1933. 1934. Pieces. Value. Value. Value. Value. Kerman carpets and Rugs . 8591 11540 11751 10322 9545 Tribal Rugs 1200 930 940 467 51 The decline in the Carpet Industry mentioned last year continued until the rial reached its highest value in the middle of the year. Carpets were then fetching only 60 per cent, of their normal value, many orders were cancelled and much hardship and unemployment was caused to the weavers. As the rial began to fall in value towards the end of the year, condi tions improved and a number of fresh orders were received. Prices had risen to 20 per cent, by the end of the year and the market was brighter, although still sub-normal. Mr. A. C. Edwards, General Manager of the Oriental Carpet Manu facturers Limited in London visited Kerman during April and decided to close the branch. This was done by the end of the year. Mr. Timoyanaki, the late Manager is staying in Kerman as an independent carpet agent and expects to continue exporting to the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers Ltd., on a commission basis. The American firm of Karagheusian has also closed their Kerman branch.' Wool Carding Plant.—The Carding Plant did very little work during the year owing to the slump in the carpet industry. In P r i ® Shareholders of the Company entered into negotiations with Monsieur 'A. E. Wetli (a Swiss, formerly Managing Director of the , Trading Company Limited, Kerman, which went into liquidation at the beginning of the year) with a view to importing machinery for the manu- uegmnmg OI me yeai, wi If h t0 certain conditions facture of cotton and woollen f^ncs^ ff ne that the manu- he may be appointed Managing Director H future in K8rman facture of cotton and woollen piece-goods n ° , The balance sheet of the SherkaLi-Sihami-ilermM, jhich^ was published at the end of March sh ^® d d a f 1V1 a d le at a considerable discount. share-holders, but the shares w ff n f Stance bought a number of shares for The Manager of the Company m one instance dou &amp; 50 per cent, below their fa «; value ' . _ (o) Communications. -SaAri 7.

Rawar was not resumed The work on the Kerman-Meshed ~ ^ ^ during the year, and it is not yet fit tor general&amp; new motor road between Kerman and Shahdad via Kupaya was built bv private enterprise and opened in February. By this road Shahdad is 100 miles from Kerman and light touring cars can do the journey m about 6 hours. The Tang-i-Zagh section of the Kerman—Bandar Abbas motor road was much improved and widened. There were very few accidents on this dangerous pass and the loss of life in accidents was greatly reduced. The Governor-General submitted a suggestion to Tehran to make a motor road to Bandar Abbas via Jiruft at an approximate cost of Rials 5 000 000 (about £62,500). He has strongly recommended the construction of this road as he thinks, Jiruft, which is the most fertile district of the province will benefit greatly by being linked to the Provincial capital and given a means of egress to the export markets. The Kerman—Zahidan motor road via Bam was open throughout the vear. The sandi stretch between Farah-Shourgouz-Mil Naderi has not been 'improved. Lorries use the road regularly, however, and take 3 to 4 days from Kerman to Zahidan. (b) Security of Trade routes. —The security on all motor roads through out the Province was satisfactory and no attacks on motor vehicles were reported. In an skirmish in the hills near Char Gumbad between the Amnieh and a certain Buchaqchi outlaw named Darab in June last, the latter and one of his gang were killed. Two others of the gang were captured and taken to Sirjan. (c) Posts. —No new Post offices were opened in the Province during the year. The Postal services maintained in Kerman were the same as in the previous year, viz. :— Between Kerman and Tehran vid Yezd, Isfahan including Shiraz and Meshed, etc. (by car) .... Tri- weekly. Between Kerman and Bandar Abbas vid Sirjan . . . Bi-weekly. Between Kerman and Zahidan vid Bam .... Bo. Between Kerman and Rudbar, via Jiruft (partly by car and partly by donkey) ....... Weekly. Between Kerman and Rawar Zarand (by donkey) . . Bo. Between Kerman and Shahdad (by donkey).... Bo. The mail Services between Kerman and above places were fairly regular during the year except once when the mails were delayed for a day on the Bandar Abbas—Tehran road on account of snow. {d) Wireless. —The Wireless station at Kerman maintained communi cation between the expeditionary forces at Khwash and the Military autho rities at Kerman from November 1934 till April 1935, when it was closed down on the withdrawal of the troops. (e) Aviation. —No aeroplanes visited Kerman during the year and the two so-called aerodromes remained neglected. An officer from the Iranian Air Force visited Kerman during October to inspect and report on the condition of the two aerodromes but nothing has been done so far. B.—LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS. 8. Condition of the country. —The law and order has been maintained satisfactorily throughout the year. The prompt despatch of troops against threatened attacks prevented Baluchi raiders being successful. The only outlaw, who is still at large, is the notorious Abdul Hussain Kameran c&gt;f Bashakard. The Military authorities at Bandar Abbas and Kerman have offered him a pension if he will agree to surrender and live a peaceful life. So far he has not agreed to this suggestion!41 durij ae a year rnment InSPeCtOTS ° f different departments visited Kerman 9. Local officials and Departments.—Ris Excellency Aqayi Abdul Hassan Khan Peerma held the post of the Governor-Gene/al throughout the year. He showed great interest in schemes to improve the tow! and to open certain coal and marble mines. He received no support from the Iranian Government and no scheme was put into action. His relations with the Consulate throughout the year were cordial and courteous. Muhammad Mirza Arasteh (formerly Amir Muhtasham) of Tabriz who has been here since November 1933, continued to be the Assistant Governor-General. He prides himself on maintaining friendly relations with the Consulate. Election of members for the tenth session of Parliament.—The elections for the 10th session were conducted throughout the Province under strict supervision during February and five of the six former deputies were re elected. Hassan Agha Qazvini, a leading merchant of Kerman superseded Muayyed Ahmedi. The latter was elected member of the Char Mohall constituency of Isfahan. It is said that his cousin, Haji Mirza Muhammad Reza, the Chief Mujtahid of Kerman, telegraphed personally to the Shah after Ahmedi’s defeat here, and gained his aid towards his later success in Isfahan. Finance and Revenue. —His Excellency Mirza Ali Akbar Khan Davar, Minister of Finance, arrived from Bandar Abbas en route to Tehran on the 13th February and left for Tehran via Yezd on the 19th February. The Minister did not see the Governor-General, who was ill at the time. The Finance Member saw the local merchants and advised them to form corm panics for trading and to utilise modern methods in agriculture. He recommended the formation of a company to improve the Carpet trade, with a capital of Rials 1,000,000, 30 per cent, to be contributed by local merchants and chief manufacturers and 70 per cent, by the AgricuF tural Bank, after a branch of the latter Bank opens in Kerman. This company has not been formed. He advocated an increase of carpet weavers’ wages by about 40 per ce ^F This was found to be impracticable because of the slump in the carpet trade. He was adversely impressed by the local consumption of opium and recom mended an increase in price from 1-25 to 1-50 in order to chec consump tion. His advice was not taken as it was feared that a rise m price would increase smuggling. However, in the following month the price was raise and subsequently reduced in order to increase the sales. He sanctioned Rials 30,000 for the permanent SU P^ trees to be grown along the new avenue in the town. e P Abbas the suggestion to construct a motor road from further has been via Jiruft and Rudbar, and promised his help. o g done so far! ^ -n He recommended the retirement of Amir Kh “ AsSiXh Dial Director of Finance, Kerman, who has since been relieved by Asa Khan Muiarrad, Acting Provincial Director. „ . , • He dismissed Sanjari and Benan, two “^fh^cTruption Kerman Finance Office.

The rate fixed was Rials 250 (£4/3/4) per Tabriz Man (about 106^ ounces) with a deficit of 25 per cent, allowed for the process of reparation. The price to be modified if the shortage was more. At thif rate a misqal costs Government half a rial (2 pence) only and leaves a clean margte oTthree quarters of a rial (3 pence) profit between the cost and retail prices. , . ,, The Opium crop was exceptionally good and the yield was estimated to be about 15,000 mans (about 10 times the /£i^ e ooo'Tte poly godowns in 1934) giving a profit of about Rials 7,500,000 (iil25,000) to the Government. . . No strict supervision on the part of Government was instituted and prices were high in order to encourage growers to sell to Government and to check smuggling. . 1 No smugglers were caught and contraband opium was^ scarce, only very small quantities being sold by the growers. Government s action appears to have been successful. National Bank of /raw.—Herr Albert Haeussler, was relieved by Arsin Barkhurdarian in April and the latter remained in charge for the rest of the year. The former whose contract had expired left for hurope ma Sirj an, Shiraz and Bushire on the 1st May. Nn npsw branches were opened in the Province during the year under review. Police .—Sargord (Major) Abdul Hussein Mirza Jehangiri held the post of Provincial Commissioner of Police throughout the year. The new Police premises were partly built during the year, but building was abandoned in the latter part of the year for lack of funds. There was only one outstanding case of corruption during the year. The local gaol keeper used to release a notorious burglar at night and help him to break into houses. The burglar was caught red handed but the gaol keeper was acquitted. They say he bribed his superiors to let him on. The Police spies continued to watch visitors to the Consulate, and dealings were strictly carried out. The Rais-i-Nazmieh, personally, was on very friendly terms with the Consulate. Justice. —Aqayi Ashtiani, who has held the post of acting Chief Judge of the Appeal Court, as well as departmental Chief of the Justice adminis tration in Kerman since June 1934, continued to remain in office throughout the year. The principal Judicial appointments held in Kerman at the close of the year under review were as follows :— Istinaf (Appeal Court). —Chief Judge—Aqayi Fazlullah Ashtiani. Public Prosecutor—Aqayi Hussain Ali Sanai. Bedayat (Court of First Instance )— Chief Judge.—Aqayi Hatif Reyahi. Public Prosecutor.—Aqayi Reza Sharif. Sulhieh (Small Cause Court )— Chief Judge—Aqayi Mirza Hadi Khan Sadeeqi. Investigating Judge.—Aqayi Mirza Khalil Khan Tamaddun. Complaints about dilatory methods were frequent, but there were no other complaints. Registration of Property. —Mohammad Hassan Khan Shahpun, Chief of the Registration Department Kerman was transferred to Yezd m the middle of June and was succeeded by Fateh Ali Khan Hooshmand Yezd. The latter remained in office for the rest of the year. The Yezd Registration office was placed under Kerman temporarily as Shahpuri was considered inefficient and his removal from Kerman was on that account.43 A branch office was opened at Bam in the month of June, Rafsinjan being the only other branch. J Posts and TelegrapJis.--Aq^yi Mohammad Mirza Afsar remained in charge of the .Posts and lelegraphs Department throughout the year. The delivery arrangements both of mails and telegrams were on the whole satisfactory, though occasionally mails that arrived late on Thursdays or early on Fridays were not distributed until Saturday, Friday being a holiday., Education. —Mirza Sadiq Khan Ansari, Director of Education since March 1933 returned to Tehran in August and was succeeded by Aqayi Mayel Twisirkani, the Chief Inspector for Endowments, who has been in charge since. The Governor-General convened a meeting in April to raise funds for the construction of a hall and two sports grounds in Kerman for physical training. The cost was estimated to be between Rials 50,000 and 100,000 (£833 and 1666). A sum of Rials 15000 (£250) was subscribed by those present. A piece of land about 10,000 square zars was presented by Arbab ‘Shahriari Play ground”. A reception was given by the Education Depart ment for the exclusive use as a public sports ground, and is named the Shahriar, a leading Parsee merchant of Kerman, to the Education Depart ment on the Crown Prince’s Birthday and a display of drill, bicycle riding and gymnastic were given by various school boys. A display of skipping by girls of \mder ten years in European dress was given for the first time. The local Ittehadiah Primary Girls’ School was converted into a Secondary school and English and French are the two optional foreign languages introduced for the students to study. Sarhang II Khajoni held the post of Officer Commanding Amnieh (Road Guards) throughout the year. Complaints of corruption and extortion against Amnieh officers an Non-Commissioned Officers stationed at the vajious ou 3 vince, are still made.

Aqayi Faridooni (Omoor) the Ministerial Inspector for the Provincial Municipalities accompanied by a German Civil Engineer visited Kerman in October and the Governor-General explained his various schemes and proposals in order to get their support on their return to Tehran. The town beggars were collected and fed by the Municipality during the winter months. The Municipality Council in March sanctioned a tax of half a rial on each bale of merchandise entering the town. The income from this source was estimated to be about Rials 30,000 (£500) annually and another Rials 30.000 was sanctioned by the Ministry of Education to make up Rials 60.000 for the upkeep of Government Primary Schools in Kerman. A new tax of Rials 2 per passenger travelling by touring cars and Rial 1 by motor busses and lorries was imposed by the Municipality with effect from 1st Deymah 1314 (23rd December 1935) to be utilised for the improvement of local educational Department. Harandi, the Ex. Russian trade agent and proprietor of the Kerman electric plant has imported a new 400 horse power motor of M. A. N. manu facture. This works alternately with his older 200 horse power plant and he is now able to supply the increased demand of the town. The Municipality alone pays a sum of Rials 10,000 (£100) per mensem for the illumination of the streets. Agriculture .—The wheat and barley crop during the year under review was on the whole better than the previous year. Rainfall was satisfactory. The land taxation was abolished early in January. Telegrams of thanks were sent to H. I. M. the Shah from various centres in the Pro vince and agriculturists were generally very pleased. The cultivation of opium was greatly increased. The pistachio crop was poor and prices were higher ranging from Rials 21 tb 24 per 6^ lbs., those of previous year being 16 to 18 rials. A Government Experimental Farm and a branch of Agricultural Bank were established in Kerman during the latter quarter of the year. Locusts .—No swarms of locusts were seen in the province during the year. Sijjil-i-Ahwal {Census Department ).—Aqayi Nimatullah Mirza Kameran (Muhtasim-ul-Mulk) remained in charge throughout the year. He paid a visit of inspection to Jiruft and Rudbar during the month of June. The Census offices in Iranian Baluchistan, which had been under Kerman, were placed under Zahidan in the middle of the year. Aqayi Kameran proceeded to Tehran in November, handing over the charge to Aqayi Sam. 10. Local Politics .—The Moharram processions were curtailed this year to an unprecedented extent. They passed off quietly. Two notable Roza-khwans (religious orators) Haji Sheikh Ahmad Rukn-ul-Islam and Seyed Mohamad Zarchi were brought under escort from Yezd to Kerman. They were deported for speaking against the reforms. They were allowed to continue their religious work in Kerman under Police supervision. Orders to enforce the adoption of European hats were received by the Governor-General and other local Government officials in June. This was enforced in July and Pahlvi hats were pulled oh wearers’ heads by the Police and destroyed. _ There was talk of starting a felt hat factory in Kerman, but so far no action has been taken. Mr. Wetli (see paragraph in page 7 above) is interested in the proposal and hopes to be on the Board.18 machine guns were received from Tehran for the local Brigade in NOye ^rhang Seyapoush, the Officer Commanding the Kerman Brigade - “frnang oey p &gt; pgcembej. an d took 115 rifles to give to Moin Khan Roudbari who has been appointed to the Amneih with a salary of RiX 1 000 per mlnsem and made responsible for the peace and security of those dmtncts —Sarhang Farjullah Khan Mushar in charge of the ConscrTpOon Department, left for Tehran in the middle of the year and Sargord P Ali Nakhi Mirza Abul Molouki assumed charge. The Conscription Committee sat for 2* months and enrolled 664 conscripts to meet the requirements of the Brigade for 1936. A o 8 were discharged on completing their training. Rafsinjan. —Aqayi Ahmad Khan Mohtasham was Deputy Governor Eafsinjan for the year under review. . ^ , T , A Parsi merchant of Yezd imported an electric light plant, capable of supplying 1200 lights for the town of Bahramabad m Katsmjan. The notables of Rafsinjan have subscribed 10 000 square zars of land and a sum of Rials 10,000 for the construction of a public sports ground for the town of Bahramabad. Bam.—Aq&amp;yi Mahmood Khan Bayani .held the post of Deputy Governor of Bam during the year. He is trying to persuade the Afshar tribes of Deh Bakri area to abandon their nomadic life and to build permanent houses. Every head man of a family has had to promise to plant 1000 poplar trees round their proposed village sites. Similar action was taken m other districts of the province and advisers were engaged by His Excellency the Governor- General to help the nomad tribes in planning and building their new per manent houses. Rudbar .—Mirza Karim Khan Vaziri was Deputy Governor through- out the year and he is also Amin-Sulh (Judge of the Small Cause Court). i ' K. L. BAZALGATTE, Captain, i His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman.

Greenway, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., (Lond.), I.M.D., w as in medical charge of the Charitable Dispensary and performed the duties of Quarantine Officer throughout the year. II. The Ruling Family. (a) His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad al Jabir as Sabah, has continued to be the Ruler of Kuwait and administered the State during the year under review with ability. He has maintained correct and friendly relations with his neighbours—Iraq and Saudi Arabia—inspdte of the continuation of the trade blockade, an abortive conference ip Kuwait thereon and the continuation of certain disquieting signs from Iraq which are mentioned in the section of this Report dealing with foreign relations. (5) His Excellency left Kuwait for a tour in Europe on the 24th of June. . He visited Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Italy, France, England and Egypt returning to Kuwait amid the rejoicing of the people on the 14th of September. The tour benefited His Excellency in health and has stimu lated his interest in things beyond the knowledge of Kuwaitis who stay at home. Among other things he acquired abroad were house property in Cairo and an Egypto-Syrian Secretary (male) who returned with him to Kuwait and remained here. Apart from the honour of being received by His Majesty the late King and the privilege accorded him of discussing certain of Kuwait s problems with interested Departments of the Home Government, what pleased His Excellency most during his tour was the Naval Review and later his view of the British Fleet in Alexandria harbour which he was kindly shown by Mr. Kelly, the then acting High Commissioner m gypf- (c) The obligation of His Majesty’s Government incurred towards the Shaikh of Kuwait in 1914 in guaranteeing freedom from taxation for his date gardens in Iraq remains undischarged. The sum involved grows. III. The Political Agent’s relations with the Shaikh. The relations between H. M.’s Political Agent and the Mer have continued to be correct throughout the year A W£ J ° • , j matter”of path of his obligations towards the British Government “ ^e mato of dealing with Oil Concessions which occurred m 1934 , was the subject admonitory letter forwarded to the Shaikh on 11th April 1J35. IV. Local Interests. / x r, * r \ full rpnort on the imports and exports for the year (a) Customs. A Report a non-confidential publication, be found in the Kuwait Tra ^^P^ t ’ n d the tax on goods entering Customs system continues uncharged and tne rax s ams at 4 per cent, changes in the Town of Kuwait ^EKTa^istration have taken place during the year.The Ruler continues, with excellent results, to forbid a newspaper, cinemas, theatres, alchoholic drink and gramophones in coffee shops. The heady wine of Western “civilization” is thus being taken in ships not gulps, and only by the wealthier class, which is able to resort to Basra. (c) Imperial Airways .—The East and Westbound services of Imperial 'Airways were duplicated as from 1st January 1935, and during the period under review, continued to call at Kuwait if somewhat irregularly. The percentage of calls not made to total passages was approximately 70 per cent. There is no night landing equipment, no hanger or shelter other than the Town wall, no Airways provided wind-indicator, and no waiting room for passengers, beyond a sun shelter built by His Excellency the Shaikh, nor is there a buoyed seaplane anchorage. No rapid means of communication exists in Kuwait for the disposal of meteorological reports and communication with aircraft. The landing ground continues to be the small area under the Town wall and the wider area available a little further out has not been used. The only visit received from an Airways Staff official during the year was from Mr. Cross, the Cairo Manager who spent a quarter of an hour on the aerodrome at Kuwait on the 11th of November. {d) Boat Building and Pearl Diving. —A note on the number, tonnage etc., of boats built during the year will be found in the Trade Report for 1935. The industry remained very low owing to the slump in the pearl market and resultant decrease in pearl diving. Boats are now cheaper than they have been for many years and the best builders in the town will make a dhow or smaller sailing boat for a third of price charged a few years ago. The pearling vessels this year put into commission numbered about 250 as compared with 300 in 1934, and about 750 in the hey day of pearling in the years just after the Great War of 1914-18. {e) Locusts .—No plague of locusts came to Kuwait in 1935. (/) The Pilgrimage to Mecca (Haj). —The 1935 pilgrimage led about 1160 Moslems to leave Kuwait by the overland route. Of these about 160 were foreigners passing through the State. The figures are as follows:— Overland route. Car. Kuwaitis ....... 16 Indians ........ 14 Iraqis ........ 130 Persians . Miscellaneous . Sea or other route. Kuwaitis ....... Nil. Camel 1,000 a considerably greater number of pilgrims thus left Kuwait for the pilgrim age than in 1934. V. H. M. the Late King Emperor’s Birthday and Jubilee. His Majesty the late King Emperor’s Birthday was approximately celebrated on June 3rd. May the 6th was celebrated as a general Holiday, for the Jubilee, His Excellency the Shaikh holding horse races, war games, dancing and fantasias. He also distributed alms to the poor and gave a dinner to three hundred of the oldest people of the town. The Political Agent gave an official reception and dinner party and the exceptional occasion was otherwise suitably marked.49 iVT- Condition of the Country. E . n „« 1 7^ r £: VII. Foreign Relations. (a) Saudi Arabia. w WFwnherjMjdent.—A small frontier incident caused attention in fu T? ; n 6t • 01 tiiat 111011111 Slx retainers of Ibn Jaluwi, Governor of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, A1 Hasa, without permission crossed the frontier and ordered one Misha’al al Timyat, a Shaikh of the nammar femjara, a non-Kuwaiti tribe grazing in Kuwait territory to move into Saudi Arabia, at Hafar al Batin, just over the frontier. This would ha\e meant a difficult if not impracticable march for a camp with its impediments to make in May. The leader of the Saudi Arab Govern ment party also ordered other sections of the Shammar and certain Dhafir elements to cross the frontier. The party was brought into Kuwait by order of the Shaikh and temporarily housed with the Saudi Arab Agent. Meanwhile men of the Mutair stirred to hear that their wells of Hafar al Batin were to be occupied by the Shammar at Ibn Jaluwrs order sent messengers with complaints to Riyadh and Kuwait. &lt; The crossing of the frontier was a subject of protest through the proper official British channels to the Saudi Arab Government. The fact that the party, as is customry in the desert, were armed drew perhaps undue atten tion to an incident that seems to have occurred through the stupidity and arrogance of a tribal servant of the Governor of Hasa, Haif Abu Shijera, the leader of the party. (2) The Trade Blockade. —The Trade Blockade continuing, the staging of a conference, at which it was hoped some progress leading to abandonment of the blockade might be made, was brought about through the agency of His Majesty’s Government, in the Summer of 1935. The delegates with a large entourage arrived on the scene, the town of Kuwait, after unexpected delays by the 17th June. Discussions were opened from the following day amd lasted until the 24th June when the parties began to write to each other instead. The point on which the conference eventually broke down was that whereby the Saudi Arab delegates held Kuwait bound to prevent all smuggling having defined all smuggling as including even a single case; on pain of w hick an\ agree ment would be considered null. The conference thus terminated without progress having been made on the 30th of June and the Saudi Arab delegates left for their own country on the 5th of July. At the end of 1935 the Trade Blockade was still in force. (b) Iraq. (D Insecurity in tke ^ during Rerslt^ in outhern Iraq m the Spring oi rojriprq Cuwait.

The fire was returned from the cars and the 226(C) F&amp;FDmails were saved. There were a number of other affrays of the same kind by Iraqi trZmen until the Shaikh dealt effectively with them by means ot c “ h P a g °^ kh took care during the rebellion to issue stringent orders to prevent the sale of arms to Iraq. i -d-i j (2) Newspaper Attacks.— Certain Iraqi newspapers, notably al Bilad, a. newspaper Understood to stand in Government favour, continued to make attacks on Kuwait in varying form. Instances are contained in the issue of al Bilad oi (a) 7th August and (J^foMio^Kuwait Territory.-ia) An Iraqi Customs launch came into Kuwaiti waters without permission, m July and September On the 9th of July the launch held up Kuwaiti sailing craft off Maschan Island at the mouth of the Bay of Kuwait. (b) On the 25th of September the Customs launch fired on and seized the craft of some Kuwaiti woodcutters off Bubiyan Island. In neither case was there any redress or reparation made by the Iraq authorities, who denied the incidents. (c) Persia. The situation vis-a-vis Iran became very slightly easier during the Year. In 1934 Iran treated Kuwait as far as she was able, as a part oi Tran territory, that is in the matter of trade and passport regulations. In 1935 a change was noticed and British passports valid for Kuwait were visaed by Iran authorities for Iran instead of being described by them as invalid. VIII. Oil. The Kuwait Oil Company, which obtained a concession from the Shaikh in December 1934 as reported in the Administration Report tor that year, began the dis-embarkation of its personnel for work m Kuwait in December 1935, with a view to drilling by the 1st of May 1936 at BahraT on the North side of the Bay of Kuwait. The local Manager of the Company installed himself with some assistants in the town of Kuwait by the end of the year. IX. Agency Charitable Dispensary. 1. The Dispensary was managed efficiently throughout the year by Assistant Surgeon A. L. Greenway, L.R.C.P., M.R.C.S., I.M.D., Agency Medical Officer. 2. The attendance of patients as compared with the two previous years was as follows :— Outdoor. 1933 14,340 1934 • • 16,452 1935 16,636 3 . The most common diseases dealt with were those of the eye ah ear. 4. Operations performed were as follows : — as compared with the two preceding years 1933 . . 154 1934 . . . • . 189 1935 . . 215 5.

The chemist is an Iraqi Armenian qualfied in Baghdad, X. Royal Navy. (a) Friendly visits of His Majesty’s Sloops occurred from time to time during the year as usual. (b) On 15th January 1935, His Excellency Vice-Admiral F. F. Rose, C.B., D.S.O., R.N., arrived in H. M. S. Hawkins, accompanied by Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf in H. M. S. Shoreham and left on the 16th for Bushire. XI. Visit of Contre Admiral Rivet in French Cruiser Bougainville. On 22nd February 1935, the French Warship Bougaiville visited Kuwait with Rear admiral Rivet of the French Eastern Mediterranean Squadron on board. Official calls and parties as befitting the visit of a&gt; senior Naval Officer of a Foreign Power took place. The Bougainville left Kuwait on the 23rd February. ' XII. Royal Air Force. During the year under review the following aircraft of the Royal Air Force landed at Kuwait in the course of their ordinary routine duties (a) Flying Boats—'3. &lt;h) R. A. F. land aircraft—15.

Both appointments were popular. 3. Local Government Officials. —Mr. C. C. L. de Grenier, Director of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain, proceeded on leave to England on the 16th May. During his absence his work was carried on by the Financial Adviser to the Bahrain Government. Mr. de Grenier returned from leave on the 22nd November. Mr. C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Financial Adviser to the Bahrain Govern ment, proceeded on short leave to ’Iraq on the 22nd September. He returned to headquarters on the 30th September. Mr. W. B. Steele has been State Engineer to the Bahrain Government throughout the year. 4. Bahrain Armed Police .—There has been no change in the distribu tion of the Armed Police and posts have been maintained throughout the vear at Muharraq and Hidd. In addition the Police have supplied various guards in Manamah and at the Civil Funding Ground at Muharraq. The Armed Police numbered 182 men and followers on the 31st December. There are three Indian Instructors on the strength of the Armed Police. A Police Post was built at Budaiya’ during the year, but as no regular police were available it was placed in charge of a section of naturs, who are stationed there for a month at a time. The Armed Police took part in a number of ceremonial occasions during the year, the most notable being the parade, which was held on the 6th May in honour of His late Most Gracious Majesty s Silver Jubilee. Detach ments from H. M. S. Bideford and H. M. S. Fowey also took part in the parade, at which the salute was taken by His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin ’Isa A1 Khalifah. In addition to and independent of the Armed Police there is a body of naturs or armed night watchmen. There has been no change in tj 1 ® 11 * organization except that they now wear a simple white uniform on official occasions. The naturs numbered 108 at the end of the year. The astonishing improvement which has taken place of late years in law and order in Bahrain may be judged by the fact the Political Agent was able recently to fix the time of night of a misdeed by a number ot persons having noticed the noise of a rifle being discharged! 5. Local Affairs.-—(\) In April 1935 the British Naval Stations at Hen jam and Basidfi were transferred to Bahrain.

No loss of life occurred. 18. Naval. —(i) H. M. S. Hawkins, flying the Flag of His Excellency Vice-Admiral F. F. Rose, Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, visited Bahrain from the 18th to the 21st January.

The rupee is unpopular among the bedouin and smaller traders who have lost by the change, but the importers from abroad have ^“(hi) Large numbers of camels were said to have been purchased by Bin Sa’ud during the summer for sums varying from 120 130 riya s. /jv) Towards the end of the year Bin Sa’ud established a land registra tion department in the Hasa Province and was making arrangements to (Topen regular courts, and (b) to establish a regular police force with 150 trained men. He also proposed to disarm the tribes. It is understood that Bfn Sa’ud wishes to see the reactions to these reforms m Hasa before intro- during them in other parts of his dominions. . (v) The California Standard Oil Company have been prospecting for oil in various parts of the Hasa Province. A test well was sunk at Damam on the sea coast near Qatif and oil is reported to have been struck on the 27th August. Their operations appear to be much hampered by the pressuie of gas. The Company have offices at Jubail and A1 Khubar. 28 Qatar. —Events in Qatar have mostly centered round negotiations between Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Qasim al Tham, Ruler of Qatar, and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited, for the grant of an oil concession. The Shaikh’s attitude in the course of the negotiations with the Com pany made it apparent in the early stages that Bin Sa ud was trying to bring pressure upon him. It was, therefore, considered necessary to remind the Shaikh of his obligations under Article V of the Qatar Treaty of 1916 under which he was not free to grant concessions or monopolies without the ap proval of His Majesty’s Government. This warning had effect but the Shaikh asked (a) for protection and (b) that his son, Hamad, should be recog nised as his successor. T3 11 After considerable discussions with the Honourable the Political Resident, the Shaikh was informed:— (a) that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to protect him trom serious and unprovoked attacks from beyond his frontiers and to support him and his successors in internal difficulties aris ing from the presence of the Oil Company, and (b) that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to recognise his son, Hamad, as his successor provided he agreed to ^ cce P 1 \ a11 obligations under the Qatar Treaty of 1916 and provided tha the Shaikh agreed to convert the Treaty of 1916 into an neirs and successors” Treaty. Subsidiary matters connected with “protection” included the construc- tioji of a landing ground and petrol store near Doha. The above conditions were agreed to by the Shaikh in an exchange of letters with the Honourable the Political Resident and the Shaikh finally signed the Commercial Agre ment with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited on 17th May. ^ The question of defining the southern frontier between Qatar and Sa udi Arabia is under discussion with the Sa’udi Arabian Government. 29. Slavery.—13 slaves were manumitted by order of the Honourabe the Political Resident and one by order of the Political Agent, makl ?S total of 14 manumitted during the year as compared with 19 manumitteu during 1934. 30.

(v) Geologists of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company visited Ras al Khaimah and Abu Dhabi in response to requests from the Shaikhs to ex plore the possibility of obtaining artesian water. . . , (vi) A representative of the D’Arcy Exploration Company Limited has visited the various Shaikhdoms of the Trucial Coast to negotiate options W tbe exploration of oil. By the end of the year he had secured options for a period of ten years from the Shaikhs of Ras al Khaimah, Sharjan, Dnbti and ’Ajman. ' The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi however, proved less will ing to negotiate. (Note. An option was secured early m 193G.) r. Aviation .—(\)The east and west bound services of Imperial Airways Limited were duplicated from the 1st January and night stops have been made at Sharjah throughout the year. No incidents occurred in connection with the Company’s bi-weekly services. (ii) Lord Sempill passed through Sharjah on the 23rd March m a Puss Moth aeroplane. He informed the Political Agent at Bahrain that he was unaware of the prohibition regarding flights by private aviators along the Arab air route and expressed regret for his mistake. (iii) T n November Mr. B. C. H. Cross, Area Manager, Near East Area Imperial*Airways Limited, visited the Trucial Coast m connection with the^proposed expansion of the Company s services on the Croydon-Karachi route Mr. Cross examined the lagoons at Ras al Khaimah, Umm al Oaiwain and Dubai with a view to selecting a place suitable for an anchor^ a-e for seaplanes, which the Company intend to use when their expanded service comes into operation. Mr. R. Wade, a Station Superintendent of Imperial Airways also visited the Trucial Coast m the same connection in December. . x ^ , (iv) In February the Political Agent, Bahrain (Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch C I.E.,), negotiated an agreement with Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan! Ruler of Abu Dhabi, regularizing the position in regard to the petrol store and landing ground at Sir Bam Yas Island, andforthe estab lishment of a petrol store and emergency landing ground at Abu V™bi. Later, when a Works Party landed at A bu Dhabi to mark the landing ground and construct the petrol store, the Shaikh (largely as the result of ill advice) refused to allow the construction of the petrol store on the ground that it was not specially mentioned m the agreement concluded earlier in the year. He also complained that the Works Party landed at Sir Bani Yas Island at the same “had spoilt his island” by marking a landing ground. It was pointed out to the Shaikh that the petrol store was a natural adjunct to a landing grouna hut he refused to modify his views. The Officiating Political (Captain G. A. Cole), therefore, proceeded to Abu Dhabi ^ June and as a result of a threat of pressure and the intervention of Shaikh ba id Din Maktum of Dubai, Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan withdrew his oppositio and the petrol store was constructed without further obstruction. (v) Living boats and aeroplanes of the Royal Air Force have frequently visited various grounds and seaplane anchorages on the Trucial Coast. 6. Royal Navy.—(i) Sloops of the Persian Gulf Division have paid fre quent visits to the Trucial Coast. (ii) In January, H. M. S. Hawkins, flying the Flag of His Exeeliency Vice-Admiral F. F.

The Shaikhs of Abu a and Umm al Qaiwain were unable to be present owing to illness and Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah did not attend. H. M. S. Hawkins also visiteu Sharjah, where His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief inspecte Imperial Airways’ Rest House. (iii) The transfer of the Naval Base from Heniam to Bahrain in ^P^L, caused comparatively little comment on the Trucial Coast, where most63 tlie Shaikhs realised m spite of claims by*certain Iranians resident on the ™^ ast tliat the move was due to pressure from the Iranian Govern ment^ that it was sound that His Maiestv’s Government should base their fleet in the area where British interests were predominant. 7. Fmfc? fry Foreign ships of war.—The French Sloop “Bougainville”, ilymg the ^ Flag of Centre-Amiral Rivet, Commander-in-Chief, Levant Station, visited Ras al Ldiaimah on the 11th February. The Shaikh did not go on board, but met the Centre-Amiral and his party on the beach and took them to his fort. After coffee and a visit to the suq, the Centre-Amiral returned to his Ship. S. Shipving .—During 1935 sixtynine British steamers and five German steamers called at Dubai and Sharjah. 9. Medical .—Towards the end of the year the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah reported an outbreak of smallpox in epidemic form and from subsequent reports it appeared that the epidemic had spread to Hamriyah, ’Ajman, Sharjah and Dubai. A vaccinator was sent to the Trucial Coast from Bahrain with supplies of vaccine obtained by air from Karachi and Basrah, and vaccinated a number of people in all the infected towns. In Dubai a large number of people were vaccinaed by Shaikh Hashar bin Maktum, brother of the Shaikh of Dubai, who had been taught to vaccinate by the Medical Officer, Victoria Memorial Hospital, Bahrain, during the tour of the Trucial Coast in 1934. A Medical Officer of the Royal Air Force flew to Sharjah where he vaccinated the entire staff of Imperial Airways Station (which was isolated from the town) and also a number of people from Sharjah The Medical Officer, Victoria Memorial Hospital, Bahrain (who is the Quarantine Medical Officer, Bahrain,) visited Sharjah by air m con nection with the epidemic. 10. Trucial Coast.—Some petty tribal raiding, camel stealing and occa sional crimes of violence occurred in various places near the Coast, but there were no serious disturbances. 1. Dubai. (i) Relations with Shaikh Sa’id bin Muktum, O.B E., Ruler of Dubai, have been cordial throughout the year and he has been of considerable assist ance on a number of occasions. There has been no revival of the attempt made in 1934 by the Shaikh’s cousins to depose him. (ii) In June 1935 the Officiating Political Agent (Captain G. A. Cole) visited Dubai and informed Shaikh Sa’id that he must either recover the g0 °k had for some time past been demanding “ardShAa kind of Customs of the Royal Air Force If d Ath?! an underS to levy dues of Political Agent, during the same visit, “^^1 any kind on Governmen s Qj.’jj bin Maktum arrived at (iv) On the 14th Septem er Abdullah bin Jiluwi, Amir of Bahrain, from where ^^ 1 ^ ^ ^ received a p rese nt of five horses andkoOO Maria Theresa dollars from the Amir. 2.

Shaikh Sultan received as a present in Riyadh— One V 8 Ford car, : fourteen rifles, eight pistols and cash and clothes. ; 3. Abu Dhabi. ) i (i) Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan, Ruler of Abu Dhabi, arrived at Bah rain on the 5th August on his way to Basrah for medical treatment. It was first suspected that he was proceeding to ‘Iraq to meet persons interest ed in oil, from whom he was known to have received overtures, but this was not borne out by subsequent reports. He returned from Basrah on the 30th September and left Bahrain for Abu Dhabi on the 8th October. (ii) The Political Agent (Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch, C.I.E.) paid several visits to Abu Dhabi in connection with the provision of a landing ground at Abu Dhabi and to discuss certain matters connected with the frontier between Sa’udi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. As a result of his last visit in November, the Political Agent was able to recommend to Govern ment a suitable frontier between the two States. (iiil The Officiating Political Agent (Captain G. A. Cole) also visited Abu Dhabi in June in connection with the obstructive attitude adopted by the Shaikh over the erection of a petrol store at the landing ground at Abu Dhabi [see paragraph 5 (iv)]. During the same tour Shaikh Shakhbut was also allowed to apologise to the Officer Commanding, H. M. S. Fowev fCommander Neville Harvey), for discourtesy in keeping the Ship waiting before he came off to pay his call on the Commander. The Shaikh refused to do so at first, but the Shaikh of Dubai intervened and, wiser councils pre vailing, the Shaikh apologized to Commander Harvey. Relations with him have since been cordial. 4. Has al Khaimah. ; Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Ras al Rhaimah, had for some years past studiously refused to meet His Majesty’s Representatives or call on His Majesty’s Ships when they visited his port, as he harboured a grievance about action taken to seize his boats when the petrol barge was bein^ installed. Ma tters c ame to a head when, in the latter half of December 1934 the 'Shaikh removed his Jlagstaff and flag from Tilnb- Island, and was reported r? intriguing with the Iranians. In January the Residency Agent (Khan Bahadur Isa bin Abdul Latif) was ordered to proceed to Ras al Khaimah his extraordinary action in re moving LTfsT flagstaff andnag from Thikb Island, and at the same time reminded him of his obligations under Article 5 of the Treaty of 1892. The Residency Agent reported that the Shaikh had no intention of abandoning the island but wanted to make money out of it, and, therefore, removed his flag to attract attention. In March the Shaikh was informed that His ICwV^jest^^ were not prepared to pay him rent for the Light ^^le on Mib Rland and that if he did not replace his flag forthwith the Shaikh of Shariah (who is the head of the Qawasimi clan) would be permitted to hoist his flag on the island. This warning had the desired effect and the flagstaff and flag were replaced on the island on the 3rd April. . Th | r ' se( l uel thi 8 fiH 11 warning was that the Shaikh sent a polite letter Ir &lt; le P°l ltica l Resident in which he expressed the hope that a Political Officer would visit him at Ras al Khaimah and also asking that a geologist should be sent to Ras al Khaimah to make a survey of his erntory for minerals. In connection with the latter request it is interest- mg that when 1*6 French Sloop “Bougainville” visited Ras al Khaimali on the 11th February, overtures for a geologist were believed to have been made to Contre Amiral Rivet (Commander-in-Chief, Levant Station) Oi th cai HaliraiD, ' maderequ On th fftience he Jiluwi, Ai and l^t. h is report Relat Noth:65 [%A Shaikh cameTboard ft onoetoS Ihe^Offi?

(A) Agency Officials .— Political Agent: Major C. E. U. Bremner, M.C., from 1st January to 5th June 1935. Major R. P. Watts, I.A. from 6th June to the end of the year. Medical Officer : Assistant Surgeon R. Easey, I.M.D., throughout the year. Treasury Officer : Mr. A. S. Norton from 1st January to 10th August 1935. Mr. Maqbul Husain Khan from 11th August to 31st December 1935. (B) Agency in General. —The Agency Electric Installation which had been sanctioned in 1934 was completed and the Plant commenced working in February. This much needed amenity which in the notoriously trying cli mate of Muscat can hardly be said to be a luxury, has been greatly appre ciated by all members of the Agency. New servants’ quarters and garages were completed during the year. 2. (A) Agency Hospital.—Faaxly in the yea^ the Agency Hospital, where all patients are treated free and which receives no grant from the State although the vast majority of patients treated aye Muscati subjects, had fallen into a parlous financial condition. A joint meeting of leading Muscati and British subjects was held in April and a sum of some Rs. 3,000 raised by subscriptions as a contribution towards the funds of the Hospital. His Highness himself contributed Rs. 500. The Hospital finances, are as a result now in a comparatively sound condition. The total number of patients treated during the year was 9,630 of which 161 were “in patients” and 9,469 “out patients”. The number shows an increase of 780. The daily average attendance was 76-20. 1,240 operations were carried out during the year. ' There was no outbreak of any epidemics. There were two imported cases of smallpox. Malaria, Skin, Eye and diseases of the digestive system continued to be the most prevalent. (B) Quarantine. —The much needed repairs to the quarantine station were carried out early in the year. When quarantine restrictions have to be imposed the arrangements now in force for dealing with the segregation of passengers from infected ports are satisfactory. 3. Political Affairs.—(1) The political situation continued quiet and uneventful throughout the year. Matters of lesser importance affecting the interests of His Majesty’s' Government and the Sultanate have been dealt with under appropriate headings in Part II of the Report. (2) The Commercial Treaty between His Majesty’s Government and the Sultan was renewed on its due date, 11th February. 4. Judicial. —Judicial matters form the subject of a separate report. 5. Trade. —Imports and exports during the year 1934-35 showed an improvement as will be seen from the following figures supplied by the local Customs Department:— Year. Imports. Export-. 1933- 34 . • . . 30,08.222 .... 18,81,310 1934- 35 .... 36,13,716 .... 25,61,387 The principal articles of export continued to be dry and wet dates and dried fish, whilst imports are chiefly composed of rice, flour, coffee, textiles, sugar, spices, wines and liquors.«7 Japan who continues ^strLg^ ° t ! .P ieoe -g 0 °ds is held by ness and, on the whole serviceable ^ 1 m thls res pect.

It is proposed to erect some small huts for ac commodation on shore and a canteen but at the close of the year no building operations had been started. fo (B) Royal Air Force.—No changes took place in the establishment of the Royal Air Force in Muscat where a Rest House and Wireless Station, which is in direct touch with Shaiba (Basra) and Hinaidi (Baghdad), is maintained in charge of three operators. A considerably greater number of visits to Muscat territory were made by the Royal Air Force in 1935 than last year. The existing landing ground at Masirah Island was found to be un suitable particularly for heavy machines and the Sultan’s permission was therefore sought and obtained to use another piece of ground a few miles to the south. A permanent petrol store is being erected on the new site. 7. Aviation. —The annual special authorisation for aircraft to land in and fly over Muscat and Oman required by the Civil Air Agreement entered into between His Majesty’s Government and the Sultan in 1934, was renewed on 1st January. The civil aerodrome at Gwadur was regularly used throughout the year by the bi-weekly East and West service maintained by the Imperial Airways. A few machines of the Royal Air Force on occasional flights carried out between Iraq and India landed at Gwadur for refuelling. The emergency landing groupd at Shinas was not used by any Imperial- Airways machines but a few Royal Air lorce aeroplanes landed there for inspection purposes in the course of routine flights down the Arab side of the Gulf. 8. Foreign Interests.—(a) The French Consulate remained closed throughout the year. The French Sloop “Bougainville” with Rear Admiral Rivet, Command ing the French Naval Forces at Beyrout visited Muscat on 8th February Customary calls were exchanged between the Admiral, the Political Agen and the Sultan respectively. (b) American interests remained in the hands of the Political Agent during the year. , . . . . A Norwegian Ship the “Stella Polaris”, chartered by an American •'•oncern for a luxurv world cruise, arrived in Muscat on 5th April. An invSonlo visit the ship was sent t» the Pol.Ueal Agent and the Sultan.The passengers are said to have been somewhat disappointed when the latter did not appear himself but sent his uncle Saiyid Shahab in his place. 9. American South Arabian Mission.-The religious work of the American Mission (The Dutch Reformed Church of tlie United States of America) was carried out by the Revd. Mr. and Mrs. Dykstra during the first half of the year and by the Revd. Mr. and Mrs. Penmngs m the second half. ., „ . Dr Harrison continued in charge of the medical side of the Mission at their Hospital at Matrah. In April he visited Sur with the permission of the Sultan and stayed there six weeks treating the smk and carrying out operations. In June Dr. Harrison at the invitation of H. M Ibn Saud nrncftftded to Riadh via Bahrain in order to examine a lady of the Royal Household. . Miss Hosman, who is the Lady Doctor attached to the Mission, spent the greater part of the year with the exception of three months recess m India, on touring the Batineh treating the sick. During the summer months the entire Mission staff left Muscat as usual. . . . n Dr. Storm of the Arabian Mission, who had been staying in Mokalia during the first half of the year was permitted by the Sultan to proceed to take up his residence in Dhofar during His Highness’s stay there for the purpose of carrying out medical work. 10 Slavery .—27 slaves, comprising 21 males and six females, took refuge in the Agency during the year and were manumitted in due course. 11. Climate .—The total rainfall amounted to 6-39 inches during the year, whilst the minimum and maximum temperatures registered were 53-5 in January and 114’1° in June respectively. PART II. I 1 Ruling Family, (a) His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur.—The Sultan was absent in India at the close of the year 1934 and returned to Muscat on 6th February. In March he paid a visit m H. M. S. Shoreham to Khasab and Jazirat-al-Ghanam where he inspected the site of the pro posed Naval Recreation Station at, Khor Quwari. In April he proceeded to Gwadur and after a brief trip to Karachi and back left in Lupin for Sur, where he stayed some six days. While at Sur His Highness received a farewell visit from the retiring Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, Captain J. V. Creagh, D.S.O. The presence of the two Warships at Sur is reported to have had an excellent effect on the unruly inhabitants of what was formerly a troublesome port and to have resulted in an appro- ciable increase of the Sultan’s authority in that district. In July His Highness travelled by sea to Sohar where the date cultiva tors petitioned him to grant a reduction in the rate of Zakat (an excise tax levied at source on certain produce of the country). The Sultan promised to reduce the tax but the Director of Revenues who visited the Batineh m December refused to accept any reduction. Most of the cultivators on their part, as a protest, refused to pay the Zakat unless it was taken in kind only. The matter was referred to His Highness whose decision was still awaited a t the end of the year. The Sultan returned to Muscat overland on 11th August. He sailed for India on 31st August to undergo an X-ray examination for some internal trouble which he had apparently developed during his last visit to the Batineh. He returned to Muscat on 2nd October. The report of the medical examination was favourable, nothing serious having been found. His Highness proceeded to Dhofar on 12th October by a steamer of the Moghul Line Steamship Company which was chartered for the voyage. He was accompanied by some fifty of his followers including Khan Bahadur Ahmad Shubaili, his Secretary, who had travelled up by the same ship from69 India. _ v\ 7 hen leaving Muscat His Highness announced his intention of returning in A.pnl and arrangements, at his recjuest, were made for a Tanker of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to call in for him, but he has since written to say that he intends to stay on in Dhofar until the autumn. It appears as if His Highness’s inclination -4- /“V 'Wfc ^ I ' _ 1 1 i 3^1 W 11 ^umpany lu can in ior mm, DU say that he intends to stay on in Dhofar until the x- 1 - if His Highness’s inclination is to follow in the footsteps of his father, Saiyid Taimur, and somewhat neglect the affairs of his State oi ms lauiier, oaiyia rairnur, ana somewnat neglect the affairs of his S and devote most of his time to personal amusements. He is engaged ^ re-building and decorating his house in Salalah where he has just installed electric lighting and refrigeration. His Highness’s time in Dhofar is chiefly occupied in carrying out improvements to his house and personal property, proceeding on hunting expeditions in the near neighbourhood, experiments in cultivation and generally in the pursuits of a country gentle man. Many riding horses, motor cars, cinema and radio installation and a Court Jester, all taken down from Muscat, complete the amenities of life in Dhofar. The vast majority of the inhabitants of Muscat and Oman are so poverty stricken and occupied with earning their daily pittance that the prolonged absence of their Sultan means nothing to them. The small com paratively well to do community are exclusively engaged in trade and interested in nothing else. Real resentment and discontent at the Sultan’s neglect of his capital and his government is confined to the Ruling Family whose dislikes and jealousies amongst themselves, however, prevent them from effectively combining to undermine the Sultan’s authority, a measure which they are all desirous of accomplishing. It is rumoured that the Sultan recently withdrew Rs. 2,00,000 from the State Funds in the Bank at Bombay to cover part of his expenses while at Salalah. This act is greatly resented by the Ruling Family who consider the money belongs to the State and is not for the personal use of the Sultan. (b) Saiyid Hamad bin Faisal, one of His Highness’s uncles, who had held the post of the Wall of Matrah since he was removed from the governor ship of Sohar in 1930, was relieved for his duties when he returned from India in August on the pretext of his ill health. The real cause of his discharge was that His Highness had received numerous complaints ot his neglect of his duties and his ill-treatment of people. ^ • • u (c) Saiyid Mahmud bin Mohammad bin TwH, a cousin of His High ness was appointed and continues to be the Wall of Matrah. (d) Saiyid Nadir, the senior uncle of His Highness, has, as m the pas, maintained friendly relations with the Sheikhs and the Imam of Oman, with whom he maintains a constant correspondence He refuses to take an interest in State affairs owing to his continuing to nurse a grievance over the reduction made in his allowance in 19dd. , (el Saivid Shahab bin Faisal, the favourite uncle of His Highness, re- ( 1 x Altnn whenever he was absent from the capital.
