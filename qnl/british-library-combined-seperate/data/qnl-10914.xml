However, he warns against extending the Protectorate to territory not previously under Egyptian control, on the grounds that the British would then become financially liable for the protection of shipping in an area particularly hazardous for shipping.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Vice-Consul, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Arthur William Moore</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Gulf of Aden</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Declaration</topic></subject><subject><topic>Protectorates</topic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Shipping</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000042#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
