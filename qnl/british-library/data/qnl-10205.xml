S. MELVILL, Esq ., C.S.L, Agent to the Governor-General of India, Baroda. Sir, 1. The policy pursued by His Excellency Sir T. Mahadevrao, K.C.S .L, in conducting the administration of the Baroda State, which has been entrusted to His Excellency during the present minority of His Highness Sieajeerao Gaekwar, has to some extent deprived us of our hereditary rights, privileges, respect, and dignity. 2. Regarding as we naturally do this circumstance with feelings of deep anxiety and alarm, we consider it high time to ask the serious attention of the proper authority to the following questions:— 1 iistly. W hether the said policy of His Excellency the Dewan is in accord ance with the original constitution of the Baroda State. Secondly. —Whether we are not entitled to have our reduced rights, privileges, &amp;c. fully restored to us. 3. Since the dethronement of His Highness Malharrao Gaekw^r, the British Government, either as a friendly or a paramount power, has been superintending the general administration of the Baroda State, and in order that the said ad ministration may be carried on in strict accordance with the old constitution of the State, the Government of India have published, in the Government Gazette of 15th May 18/5, a Resolution dated the 19th April 1875, which contains the following provisions : — ' Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, in re-establishing a native adminis tration in the Baroda State, being desirous to mark her sense of the loyal services ot His Highness Khanderao Gaekwar in 1857, has been pleased to accede to the request of his widow. Her Highness Jamnabai, that she may be allowed to adopt some member of the Gaekwar House, whom the Government of India may select as the most suitable person upon whom to confer the sovereignty of the Baroda State. The necessary steps will accordingly be immediately taken to carry into effect Her Majesty's commands. In the meantime, with the consent of His Highness the Maharaja oflndore, Sir Mahadevrao, K.C.S.I., will at once proceed to Baroda and conduct the administration of the State as Prime Minister, under instructions which he will receive from the Governor-General's Agent and Special Commissioner at Baroda.' In conferring the sovereignty of the Baroda State, no alteration will be made in the treaty engagements which exist between the British Government and the Gaekwars of Baroda, and the new Gaekwar will enjoy all the privileges and advantages which were conveyed to the Gaekwars of Baroda in the sunnnd of Earl Canning, dated the 11th of March 1862.' 4. Since, according to the above provisions. His Excellency Sir Mahadev- rao has been appointed to conduct the administration of the Baroda State under instructions which your Honour, as the Governor-General's Agent, may give, we look upon your Honour as the proper authority to whom we may address our grievances regarding the said administration. 5. In the first place, we desire distinctly to state that, in presenting this Memorandum to your Honour, we do not mean to comment in any carping spirit either upon the personal character of His Excellency, or upon his qualifi cations as an administrator. Without any such motive on our part, we beg to submit that when we found that the administrative views and measures of His Excellency were not only opposed to our own interests, but were inconsistent with the original constitution of the State, we often intimated, through our vakils, our desire to visit His Excellency with a view to submit the nature of our grievances for His Excellency's consideration. But whether the fact was, as we suppose, that His Excellency could not find leisure from his ministerial business, or whether it was otherwise, His Excellency did not favour us with an interview. Such being the case, we have now no alternative but to represent our case to your Honour. As we are afraid lest we should make this Memorandum incon veniently long by entering into the details of our individual grievances, we beg to submit a collective statement of the principal grounds upon which our common grievances have been founded. 6. It would be presumptuous on our part to dwell at length upon the importance attached to our position; we, however, consider it necessary, for the purposes of this Memorandum, to allude to the fact that our ancestors were brought hither by the first Gaekwar himself, in order to assist him in establish ing this State, and that when the object was achieved through their united exertions, the Maharaja conferred upon them, according to their respective merits, Inam villages, horse and foot establishments, allowances, and honours {vide para. 35 of His Excellency the Dewan's Administration Report of the Baroda State for the year 1875-76). In this manner we have become, from the time of our ancestors, hereditary wattan vihhagidars of the State, and our connexion with it has become so intimate that our welfare lies in its prosperity. For these reasons, we always consider it our duty as well as our interest to bring to the notice of the proper authority whatever measures of the State may, in our opinion, be improper or dangerous; and accordingly we submit thi^j Memorandum with a view to show in what respects our views differ from those of the present Ministry.7. We bave already stated that, in spite of our repeated requests, His Ex cellency did not visit us. It is a matter of deep regret to us that this circum stance did not only deprive us of the only means of acquainting His Excellency with our opinions as to the principles and usages according to which this State has been hitherto governed, but did also incidentally prevent us from exercising our hereditary right to take part in the administration of the State. 8. Taking into consideration the loyal services rendered by our ancestors, each successive Maharaja peacefully continued our rights, privileges, and other peculiar advantages, and protected us as members of his own family. This state of things, which lasted till the time of His Highness Khanderao Gaekwar, was at last disturbed during the latter part of his reign by the appointment of an un educated man like Bhow Scindia as Prime Minister, who began to treat us rather severely, and adopted a policy adverse to our interests. His Highness Khanderao Maharaj, however, assured us in a personal interview that steps would be taken to change the policy, and to protect our hereditary rights, privileges, &amp;c. as before. Before this assurance could be carried into effect, His Highness, to our deep regret, died, and was succeeded by Mulharao Gaekwar. The character of the reign of this prince has been too notorious to require any comment from ourselves, and we only beg your Honour to refer to the Residency Records on the point. It is sufficient for us to state that the Ministry of His Highness Malharrao, out of selfish and narrow motives, constantly tried to harass us in every possible way, at the same time that they brought the whole administration to a disordered condition, h inding it hopeless, under these circumstances, to get any redress for our grievances, we were compelled to draw the attention of the late Resident at Baroda to the existing state of affairs. This circumstance, as well as several otliois, led to the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry, presided over by ( olonel R. J. Meade, G.S.I., before whom some of us stated our grievances in a general form. ( Vide the Report of the Baroda Commission, page 111, Schedule 2 ; and page 253). Although we are desirous to represent our individual griev ances to your Honour, yet, for reasons already stated, we will make them the subject of a separate memorandum, and for the present content ourselves with submitting those only which are common to all of us. 9. As already stated above, we are considered as wattan vihhagidars of the State. This fact has been admitted in writing by successive Gaekwars from time to time. Further, some of us have received the title of ' chiranjivee,' a term which signifies 'children of the gadee' and 'immortal.' Moreover, the rights and privileges lllich we have been enjoying are not such as were created by the mere pleasure of the Sircar; (even grants of this kind are continued in this State as well as in the British territories) ; but they commenced at as remote a time as when, through the devotion and combined energy of our ancestors, this Gaekvvaree State was brought into existence. We maintain, therefore, that as long as this State is in prosperity, no reasonable ground can be alleged for any interference with our rights, privileges, &amp;c., which we have received as wattan vibhagidars ofthe State. It is necessary to state here that the financial condition of the State is at present as good as, if not better than, at any previous time. As far as we know, the State revenue amounted, some years ago, to Rs. 6,500,000; lately it amounted to Rs. 14,000,000 {vide letter of the late Resident to the Secretary of the Bombay Government, dated the 28th June 1873, and published at page 9 of the Report of Sir R. Meade's Commission). And His Excellency the Dewan, in his Administration Report for the year 1875-76, estimates it at Rs. 11,000,000. It is clear from these figures that no ground of a financial character can be put forth for diminishing our rights and allowances. 10. The following are the common grounds of our dissatisfaction with the administrative policy of His Excellency the Dewan :— 1. Several of the time-honoured customs and usages of this State have been abolished ; and the principles according to which Native States are generally governed have been abandoned here. 2. The cash allowances of several of us have been reduced. 3. The horse and foot establishments held by us, and the allowance granted to us for their maintenance, have been reduced. 4. Several of our Inam villages have been attached, and are still lying in the same state ; and several others have been resumed. 5. We have been deprived of the possession of the Dumala mahals and villages. 6. It is proposed to change the principles according to which complaints made against ourselves and our followers have been hitherto disposed of—a step the effect of which is highly dangerous to the security of our dignity and privileges. 7. Our jurisdiction in the Inam villages has been greatly limited. 8. The treatment corresponding to our rank and dignity is not observed, as if we were persons of no consequence. 9. Some of the hereditary servants of the State have been dismissed, and diminutions have been made in their rights, the full security of which was vouchsafed to them by each successive Maharaja on proper occasions. 10. The rules according to which the State and other public records were kept in charge of hereditary Darakdars have been set aside. 11. The old system of maintaining peace and order in the State has been changed; and the new one is, in our opinion, highly expensive, at the same time that it is calculated to disturb the original constitution of the State, 12. Some of the allowances granted for dharmadas (charitable institutions) have been reduced, and others have been wholly discontinued.* 11. With respect to the first ground, we cannot conveniently enter into all the particulars, and therefore beg to submit the following facts which are impor tant for the purposes of this Memorandum :— 1. This State is ruled by Hindu princes, and consequently several customs and usages in accordance with the principles laid down in the Hindu Law have existed here from the earliest times. For instance, the Hindu Law of adoption declares that an adopted son is entitled to the same privileges and advantages as a natural son, and a corresponding- practice has been fully recognized in this State from the beginning, so that the allowances, grants, establishments, and other rights enjoyed by the original person have descended, without the slightest diminution, to his adopted son and his successors. That such is really the practice observed in this State may be shown by numer ous instances, both past and present. In this place, we must incidentally admit that it was formerly customary to offer a nazardnd to the Durbar on the occasion of entering the name of an adopted son in the place of his predecessor. This practice, however, was not confined to the succession of an adopted son; it was sometimes extended to the case of a natural son according to the will of the Sircar, so that there existed no definite and uniform rule in regard to such nazardnd. This custom was at last abolished by His Highness Khunderao Maharaj under circumstances which, being of an exceptional nature, deserve to be mentioned here. In the year 1857 the British Government desired His Highness Khunderao Gaekwar to lend his assistance in suppressing the Indian Mutiny, which threaten ed to exterminate the British rulers from the country. His High ness accordingly placed a military force at their disposal, and ordered us to accompany it. In obedience to this order, we faithfully dis charged our duty under the instructions of British officers. We do not desire to dilate here upon the merits of our services on that occasion, and only beg your Honour to refer to the records of the Bri tish Government on the subject. The consequence was that the alli ance between the British Government and his Highness Khanderao Gaekwar was strengthened, and, as a mark of its favour, the said Government abolished the levy of three lacs of rupees for the supply of an irregular cavalry to this State, and added ' MorchuF to the royal ensigns. As this favour was acquired principally through the services rendered by us, His Highness was pleased to issue in Samvat 1919 a proclamation to the effect that, considering the Sirdars, &amp;c. as an important body of the State, the practice of taking the avej moho- haddla nazardnd from them was abolished. In spite of the existence of the custom of adoption, as it is pointed out above, from the earliest times in this State, steps have been of late6 taken to abolish it, or, at least, to diminisli its force. We often tried in vain to draw the attention of His Highness Malharrao Gaekwar to our grievances on the subject. Subsequently we represented them to the Commission of Sir R. Meade, as well as to Sir Lewis Pelly, and although we were assured by the latter that proper inquiries would immediately be instituted into the matter, it remained as it formerly was. In the meantime. His Excellency Sir Mahadevrao was appointed Prime Minister of the State, so that the matter came to his hands for decision. From this quarter, too, we have received sad disappoint ments ; instead of adhering to the principles of the Hindu Law, His Excellency has declared several of our hereditary rights to be enjoyed only for the lifetime of the adopted son, and, in some cases, has either reduced or wholly discontinued the allowances. We postpone sub mitting full particulars in support of these statements till your Honour desires us to do so; but, in order that they may not appear wholly groundless, we beg your Honour to refer to His Excellency's Admi nistration Report for the year 1875-76. Thus your Honour will clearly see that the assurance conveyed in the proclamation of Her Most Gracious Majesty the Empress of India, and repeated from time to time by Her Majesty's Representatives to the effect that the admi nistration of this State would be conducted in conformity to its parti cular customs, is not being carried out; and we are at a loss to understand how, in the face of such assurance, the new policy of His Excellency the Dewan can for a moment be upheld. In this State it is an established custom that whenever we are in need of borrowing money, we ask the Sircar to offer to the banker a kacha kabulaydt (guarantee) in the shape of a promise to pay him a certain proportion of ouv hales or allowances at the time of their becoming due to us. This practice affords both convenience to ourselves and security to the banker, at the same time that the Sircar thereby in curs no responsibility. The Sahookar rests assured that the money advanced by him will doubtless be repaid from the Government trea sury at the time of the payment of our haks^ while we are enabled to get the required loan at a very moderate interest. Moreover, the practice affords the Government a clue to acquire a thorough know ledge of our circumstances. This custom, which has existed here for a long time, is now abolished, and it appears that the present Ministry has resolved never to revive it {vide para. 56 of His Excellency the Dewan's Administration Report for the year 1875-76). This deter mination on the part of the Ministry is highly injurious to all of us, while it is clear that the Gowrnment derives no gain from it. The absence of Government security 'tegets impatience and distrust in the mind of the Sahookar, so that we find it extremely difficult to procuremoney even at an exorbitant rate of interest, and consequently we are put to much loss and inconvenience. The practice in question does not only exist in all the Native States, but is sometimes observed in the British territories under different forms and circumstances. 12. As to the clauses 2, 3, and 4 of para. 10, we beg briefly to state that the cash allowances as well as the inam villages were conferred on our ancestors in perpetuity, and have descended to us in hereditary succession. In order to establish this fact, there are many documentary evidences in our possession, which we intend to submit at the time when your Honour asks for our individual grievances. When such is the nature of the said grants, any interference with them is, in our opinion, not only contrary to the established usages of this State as well as of the British Government, but is also inconsistent with the general principles of equity. From a minute examination of para. 38 of His Excellency the Dewan's Admi nistration Report for the year 1875-76, we have reason to believe that the present Ministry has no intention to inquire into such of our grievances as may have arisen prior to the reign of His Highness Mulharrao Gaekwar. With respect to this point, we have already stated that we were disturbed in the enjoy ment of our rights and privileges even .during the last six or seven years of the reign of His Highness Khanderao Gaekwar, and that we had not refrained from carrying our grievances on the subject to His Highness. On referring to the Residency records, as well as to the Report of the Baroda Commission, page 9. paras. 15 and 17, your Honour will see that the latter part of the reign of His Highness Khanderao was marked by the tyrannical acts of an unscrupulous Ministry, which lost no opportunity to throw every possible obstacle in our way. Although His Highness had at last expressed his intention to inquire into our grievances, the Ministry tried to prevent it from being carried into effect, in the meantime His Highness died, and Mulharrao Gaekwar succeeded to the throne. As already stated, our grievances, instead of being redressed, only increased during the reign of this prince, and when the doors of justice thus seemed to be closed against us in the Durbar, we were compelled to submit the matter before the late Resident at Baroda. These statements are sufficient to convince your Honour that we have made no delay in taking all such steps as were justly and lawfully open to us to represent our sad case to the proper authority. Under these circumstances, we submit for your Honour's consideration whether the present Ministry is justified in excluding from its inquiry those grievances which had arisen during the reign of His Highness Khanderao Gaekwar. 13. There are certain military forces and establishments under our charge, and we receive fixed allowances from the State for their maintenance. In addition to this, we used to get grass-plots for feeding horses, and money for purchasing horses to supply the place of such as died in Government service; besides, our subordinates used to get mohosli when they went out on duty, and8 food m lieu of travelling allowances. Further, the State had conferred upon us the Dumald mahals and villages, which are distributed among us according to our respective ranks and merits. In making this grant, the objects of the State ■weie (1) to provide us with the means of defraying any large and unusual expenses which we might be obliged to incur in performing our duty in times of public exigency, (2) to afford us ease and convenience in managing our establish- ments; (3) to enable us to maintain our dignity in the State; and (4) to ensure the safety of the State itself. These mahals and villages, after they had conti nued in our possession for a long period, were at last attached in an arbitrary manner at the instigation of the Ministry of Bhow Scindia during the latter part of the reign of His Highness Khanderao Gaekwar, and we were informed that, after due inquiry, they would be restored to us. Then we often requested His' Highness to institute the promised inquiry. In the meantime, some discussion ai o^e as to the appointment of Bhow Scindia as Prime Minister, and soon after- Tvaido the Maharaja died, so that our case remained uninvestigated. The Dumala mahals and villages are still under Government attachment. The objects, however, foi which they were granted by the State, have not ceased to exist. Moreover, the old practice of giving us grass-plots and money for our horses, and of allowing 'mohosh' and travelling allowances to our subordinates when out on duty, is now discontinued. In addition to this, your Honour is doubtless aware that much scarcity prevails at present in the country, and that prices have risen to a very high degree. Under these circumstances, we submit for your Honour's considera tion whether the seizure of the Dumala Jaghirs from us will not render our con dition extremely precarious. His Excellency the Dewan, though earnestly request ed by us, has hitherto paid no attention to the matter; and on referring to paras. 38 and 39 of the Administration Report for the year 1875-76, your Honour will clearly see that His Excellency has no intention to investigate the matter, inasmuch as, in his opinion, the measure of attachment ' passed unchallenged at that time, and ' was submitted to by the interests thereby affected.' We need hardly state that His Excellency is evidently misled in making this observation. We have only to repeat here that, as a matter of fact, we did protest against the measure even during the very reign in which it was passed, and that since then we have represented the matter successively to His Highness Mulharrao, the late Resident, the Commission of Sir Richard Meade, and Sir Lewis Pelly. Without making any violent agitation, which would have marred our interests, we have employed lawful means to obtain redress for our grievances, and because' we have not succeeded in our attempts, it cannot be inferred that we have willingly submitted to the measure in question. We now submit for your Honour's consi deration whether the grants in question, which were made to us for supporting our dignity and for other purposes stated above, are not such as may be restored to us. A reference to the records of this State will convince your Honour that these grants are hereditary, and have been in our enjoyment for a long period. If further proofs be needed to establish this fact, we will submit them in a separate Memorandum to your Honour.9 14. Neither we, nor our followers and dependents, have, ever since the establishment of this State, been brought within the pale of the ordinary jurisdic tion, either civil or criminal. It is one of the recognized principles of this State that no decree of a civil nature can be executed either against our person or our property, and accordingly we have never been imprisoned, nor has our property ever been attached, in lieu of our debts. As already stated above, such debts are sooner or later paid by the Hoozoor from our * nemnook,' in certain propor tions. In spite of the existence of such practice, the opinion of the present Ministry seems to have gone somewhat against it. Again, criminal cases of an ordinary nature against our followers and dependents are always tried by the Buxee, who, after finding the accused guilty of the charge brought against him, passes sentence upon him, either of imprisonment or of fine, as the case may be, and then sends him to undergo it under the superintendence of that Sirdar whose follower he may be. All appeals against the decisions of the Buxee are heard and decided by the Hoozoor or the Senaputtee. Again, criminal charges against ourselves are first submitted through the Buxee to the Hoozoor sircar, and are then decided by the latter, A similar procedure is observed in the case of great offences committed by our followers and dependents, and all sentences passed upon them by the Hoozoor are also undergone under our own superin tendence. Now, the present Ministry has framed several principles calculated to abolish and supersede this practice—principles which, if enforced, will prove not only a deathblow to our honours and dignities, but also a source of indescribable grief and affliction to our hearts. Having pointed out the mode of jurisdiction which has hitherto been applied to us and our followers, we now beg to submit the following references which will clearly show the nature of the steps which the present Ministry intends to take in the matter— 1. Paras. 64, 66, and 97 of His Excellency the Dewan's Adminis tration Report for the year 1875-76. 2. The rules of the 1st June 1877, called the Rules for the Sirdar Court. As we are anxious to bring to your Honour's notice the extent of the loss which the introduction of the new change will inflict upon us, and also that the old mode of jurisdiction is in accordance with custom and morality, we beg to submit the following statements for your Honour's consideration:— 1. The principles recognized by this State are such as are in force in almost every Native State ; and if the new ones be introduced, the assurances conveyed from time to time by Her Most Gracious Majesty the Empress of India and by Her Majesty's Representatives to continue a Native Administration in this State, will, we are afraid, prove a dead letter. 2, It is hardly necessary to repeat that we form the military class of this State, and that we are the descendants of those warriors whose10 exertions enabled the first Gaekwar to bring this State into existence. If any evidence be needed at all to prove this fact, we only beg your Honour to refer, (1) to para. 8 of the letter from the Resident to the Secretary of Bombay Government, No. 146-762, dated 19th August 1873, and published at page 25, vol. 1, Report of the Baroda Com mission ; (2) to Schedule 2, page 111 of the same Report; (3) to the Residency Records; and (4) to the Records of this State. Such mili tary class has the privilege of being excluded from the operation of ordinary laws not only in the Native States, but also in the British teintones. All matters regarding them are always decided by military officers according to military principles. Moreover, in those parts of India which have been conquered by the British, and which are inde pendently ruled by them, they, as a conquering race, are excluded from the ordinary jurisdiction of a court presided over by a native officer, and also special rules have, in some respects, been framed for Govern ment officers. Ihis fact is, we think, well known to your Honour. The new Criminal Procedure Code also declares that a Native Officer is incompetent to try and decide criminal cases against European British subjects. A reference to the undermentioned Acts passed by the British Government will convince your Honour of the truth of these statements:— Regulation II. of 1827, Sections 43, 45, 46. Regulation XII. of 1827, Section 8, Clause 4; Section 10, Clause 2; Section 11; and Section 17, Clause 4. Regulation XXII. of 1827. Regulation XXX. of 1827, Section 7, Clause 2. Act XXV. of 1861, Sections 39, 40, 41, 42. Act X. of 1872. When such is the practice recognized by a most civilized government like the British, we submit, for your Honour's consideration, whether we, too, as a military class, as a conquering race, as men through whose help this State was established, are not entitled to the privileges and advantages attached to a similar practice, which has existed here from the earliest times, and which the principles framed by the present Ministry are calculated to abolish. The old system of jurisdiction enables us to secure the following advan tages : — (1) As all business concerning us is conducted through the Buxees, and as they are hereditary kamdars, they are intimately acquainted with, and always act with perfect regard to, our respect andX 11 privileges. Their actions are subject to the supervision of the Hoozoor, and their office being hereditary, they cannot urge any excuse for not possessing knowledge on any particular subject regarding us. It is, however, proposed by Section 20 of the rules for the Sirdar Court to seize all authority from these Buxees, and to adopt an altogether new mode of exercising jurisdiction over us. (2) J he privileges attached to the old practice enable us to procure good and faithful dependents. (3) We are made, to some extent, responsible for any misconduct on the part of our subordinates, and hence arose the practice which compels every guilty subordinate to undergo his sentence under our own superintendence. The result of this mode is highly satisfactory, inasmuch as the offender feels deeply humiliated in the presence of his fellow-servants, at the same time that the latter take a warning from the example ; and the only object of inflicting punishment, namely, that the offender may improve his conduct in future, is thereby fulfilled. (4) Having shown that the old mode of exercising jurisdiction over us answered all purposes, we have now to submit whether it was not necessary to consult us before framing the rules for the Sirdar Court. In the British Government, under whose superintendence the administration of this State is at present conducted, it is an estab lished practice that every new Act, before it is passed, is made known to the public in the form of a Bill, so that those who may be interested in it may express their opinions thereon. We suppose that this prac tice is not unknown to an experienced administrator like Sir Maha- devrao. Our supposition is supported by para. 22 of His Excellency's Administration Report for the year 1875-76, in which it is stated that all the Sirdars, Darakdars, and Sahookars are consulted in those matters in which they are interested, that their opinions are ascer tained, and that, as far as possible, they are followed. We, however, beg to make an exception at least in the case of the rules for the Sirdar Court, in which matter we were not consulted, and your Honour may conceive the effect which this circumstance has produced on our minds. It is true that we were once invited by your Honour to a conference on the subject, but we had then distinctly expressed our opinion that no change in the old practice was desirable. (5) A detailed description of the constitution of the Sirdar Court will, we fear, overstep the limits of this Memorandum ; we will, therefore, submit it in a separate memorandum, contenting ourselves for the present with dwelling upon the most important points.12 (a) A new officer has been appointed to decide all sucli matters regarding- ns as were formerly cognizable only by the Hoozoor Sircar through the medium of the Buxee. {h) Those rights and privileges which our dependents and followers have enjoyed under the old practice are discontinued. (c) The custom of sending our guilty dependents and followers to undergo their punishment under our superintendence is abolished. (d) In some respects the principles of ordinary laws are made applicable to us. (e) Under the old practice, we and some of our subordinates have never been compelled to appear in person in any court, and particularly in a civil court. In criminal proceedings, too, the same rule was observed, except in the most urgent cases, and a correspondence between the Buxee and ourselves was all that took place. The rules of the Sirdar Court, however, appear to abolish this practice. (/) The power of hearing appeals which, under the old practice, rested only with the Hoozoor and the Senaputtee (Commander-in-Chief), is now vested in the Veristha Court. ((/) A warrant whether of attachment or of imprisonment for debts has never been executed against us (vide para. 97 of His Excellency's Administration Report 1875-76). This practice is now abolished by the new rules, which declare that such warrants can be issued and executed at the discretion of the Hoozoor. Lastly we beg to state that in almost all civilized Governments it is observed that the legislative and executive powers are always exercised by different persons. In this State, however, both functions are entrusted to the same officers—an arrangenent which deprives the State of all those advantages which are derived from the welhknown principle of' Division of Labour.' ] 5. The custom which has from the earliest times regulated our jurisdiction in the inam villages is that all original suits, whether of a civil or of a criminal nature, are preferred to and decided by us. Criminal cases of a grave nature, such as dacoity, robbery, murder, are submitted through the Buxee to the Hoozoor, and are decided by the latter. The same practice is observed regarding all appeals against our decisions, whether in civil or in criminal cases. This long-continued custom, which exists most probably in almost every Native State, is, we learn, to be abolished by the present Ministry, who intend to reduce our powers in question and to appoint new officers instead. We are not aware of the exact motives which actuate the Ministry in taking this step.For our part, we submit that the primary object of Government is to keep proper order in the country, and that, with this end in view, we decide all cases in strict obedience to the laws for the time being in force. 'We have no objection to act according to whatever changes the Government may from time to time think fit to introduce into the law. In the present case, however, the power of executing the law is to be transferred from one body to another, and we can see no reason why such transferrence should take place. By our position and dignity we are entitled to the confidence of Government, and it can hardly be alleged that we will abuse the powers which are solemnly entrusted to us, and for which we are responsible to the State. In the British Government, respectable persons are elected honorary Magistrates, and Jagirdars are generally empowered with criminal jurisdiction equal to that of a Mamlatdar. There is also a law in force regarding such jurisdiction, viz. Regulation XV. of 1827. Under these circum stances, we submit for your Honour's serious consideration whether we are not entitled to similar powers in this State, and whether, in that case, our dignity will not be greatly lowered in the eye of the public, not to speak of the deep humiliation which we will thereby suffer. 16. (1) With respect to clause 8, para. 10, we beg to state that the present Ministry and their subordinates do not treat us confidentially. There are numer ous instances to prove this assertion, and the following is one of them. At present the Kadi and Patan Divisions are much disturbed by robbers and plunderers, and although the new police force has been sent to restore peace and order to these parts, it has not been able to perform the task well. On such occasions, it was always the practice to send one of our class to the disturbed place; but whether the present Ministry intends to dispense with our services, or whether they consider the police force sufficient for the purpose, none of us has yet been asked to offer assistance on the present occasion. (2) On various occasions we have sent our vakils with verbal as well as written requests to His Excellency the Dewan to visit us, but they have not been complied with; and when we state that there was not a single occasion on which we were thus disappointed even by the Maharajas, your Honour may consider whether the behaviour of His Excellency is not calculated to wound our feelings. 17. As to clause 9, para. 10, we beg to state that the dismissal of some of the hereditary Government servants, and the appointment of new men in their stead, have increased the expenditure of the State. As the old Kamdars enjoyed their office in hereditary succession, it is but natural that they should regard the interests of the State as identical with their own, and should work with zeal and care, so as to secure greater confidence of Government than the new Kam dars. The Kamdars of the old class used to receive the protection of the State, so that if any of them died leaving a minor heir, another man was appointed to conduct the business attached to his office till the heir reached the age of majo rity. This custom is peculiar to a Native State, and, by abolishing it, muchdissatisfaction has been created. We are connected with several of such Kamdars or men of Sibandee, as they are called, and on several occasions they have received assurances from us as to the maintenance of their hereditary footing in the State. For instance, we have already mentioned the fact that we had accom panied a military force sent by His Highness Khanderao Gaekwar to assist the British in suppressing the Indian Mutiny of 1857. On this occasion, these Si- handee men had joined us at our express desire, and as they rendered very valuable services, we assured them that they would be amply rewarded. Now that they are dismissed, they overpower us with taunts, and ask us to make representations to the Sircar on their behalf. In our opinion, their case deserves serious con sideration, and accordingly we have brought it to your Honour's notice. 18. In this State there are several Kamdars, who, by reason of their useful and important services to the State, are called Darakddrs. They belong to the Financial Department of the State, and at their head stands the Furnavis. They enjoy their respective offices in hereditary succession, and are regarded as the pillars of the State. All the State records and accounts are entrusted to their care, and they annually receive a certain portion of the State Revenue, out of which they remunerate their personal services and maintain certain establishments of their own. These hereditary Darakdars have never been suspected of dis honesty or fraud in discharging their responsible duties. On the contrary, certain events have occurred which have clearly proved that they are worthy of every con fidence of the State. For instance, when, during the notorious reign of Malharrao Gaekwar, a Commission was appointed to inquire into the affairs of this State, various frauds were brought to light (vide Report of the Baroda Commission of Inquiry, vol. 1, p. 82) ; but not a single case was reported in which these Darakdars were accused of any misdeed. In spite of all this, the revolutionizing spirit of the present Ministry has not refrained from manifesting its effects to them. Their ' nemnook'is divided into two parts (I), personal allowance, (2) establishment allowance ; and the latter has been employed in creating a new establishment, over which the Furnavis and the Darakdars have no control. This circum stance has sent a thrill of excitement throughout the kingdom, as the Darakdars form one of the most influential and important bodies of the State. Again, in connection with the benefits which the State derives from the services of these Darakdars, we beg to state that all the State records and important accounts, being under their charge, have been safely preserved, as a hereditary responsi bility is attached to their office ; and if, during the reign of Mulharrao Gaekwar, when the affairs of the State had fallen into a disordered condition, the said records and accounts had been in the custody of any other body than such hereditary kamdars, it is extremely probable that their safety would have been endangered. Again, the body of the Darakdars is not subject to those changes which frequently take place regarding the Ministry of the State, and consequently any new Ministry finds no difficulty in conducting the business of the State, as all the requisite means, that is, the State records, &amp;c., are ready in the hands of15 the Darakdars. Lastly, the interests of the State as well as of those who are connected with it, are secured by the safe preservation of the State records and accounts, and it is not an exaggeration to say that such records, &amp;c. are more valuable than even the State jewels. We have particularly dwelt on this point, because the interests of all of us are intimately connected with the State records. Again, the Darakdars were allowed to employ such men in their respective estab lishments as might serve their own purposes, and consequently harmony used to prevail in every establishment. The effect of the new change, however, is that the new kamdars work independently of the hereditary kamdars, while the plan is highly expensive to the State. 19. With respect to clause 11, para. 10, we beg to state that the duty of preserving public peace and order in the State has ever been entrusted to us. Whenever any necessity arose for making additions to the military force, such additions took place in our own establishments (Icdrkhdnds), and our allowances were proportionately increased. This system is now changed, and a new Police force has been organized. This organization is the immediate cause of the diminution that has been made in our ancient and hereditary rights, and of the movement that is set on foot for reducing our establishments. A large and unnecessary expenditure is incurred in maintaining the new force, which scarcely performs its duty with half the success which used to attend our arms. When such is the case, we can comprehend no other motive on the part of the present Ministry in introducing the change than to lower our dignity and respect. Those men who are dismissed from our service on account of reduction in our allow ances get no employment, and new men are admitted into Government service. When a system like this has been introduced at the sacrifice of our rights, &amp;c., we cannot see how and when the assurances conveyed from time to time by Her Most Gracious Majesty the Empress of India and by Her Majesty's various representatives to continue the time-honoured customs and usages of this State, will be carried out. 20. With respect to the allowances for devasthana dharmadas (religious and charitable purposes), we beg to state that the practice is one to which the religious sentiments of the subjects of this State have long been accustomed, and that consequently any interference with it is calculated to offend the most delicate feelings of the human mind. The British rulers of India, being most probably influenced by this consideration, have up to the present day continued in their territories similar allowances which were granted by their predecessors. Now, when the allowances in question of this State are such as were granted by the preceding Gaekwars, and when it is vouchsafed that the administration of this State shall be conducted in strict accordance with its particular customs and usages, we submit for your Honour's consideration whether the reduction that has been made in the said allowances is justifiable on any reasonable ground. In this State many of such allowances are attached to those temples and seats of charity which are consecrated to the respective religions of the Hindus and16 the Malioraedans; the greater portion of the population of this State consists of these two classes; and the ruler of the State himself is a Hindu by religion. These facts are sufficient to convince your Honour that the measure of reduction in question will create a widespread dissatisfaction in the State. 21. Lastly, we beg to submit that during the short time that the adminis tration of this State was in charge of Sir Lewis Pelly, the claims of several here ditary hakddrs were investigated, and were each and all sanctioned without any reduction by him. Want of sufficient time, however, prevented him from inquir ing into our grievances and those of several others. This inquiry was subse quently made by the present Ministry, and, as we have already said, the result has been totally disappointing to us. 22. In conclusion, we pray for justice at the hands of your Honour, and trust that our grievances will meet with the consideration they deserve. After the above was committed to writing. His Excellency the Dewan once intimated his desire to visit some of us for some reason which we are unable to ascertain at present, whether it might be that His Excellency came to know of our intention to appeal against his decision, or that His Excellency was anxious to reconsider some of our grievances in a personal interview which had not taken place for a long time past. In compliance with his desire, we visited His Excellency on the 27th of April 1S78, when His Excellency produced a Memorandum of our previous representations to him, and began to express his opinion on the subject. It is necessary to state here that this Memorandum seemed to us to differ in several respects from our original verbal statements, which, we believe, must have been misunderstood at the time the memorandum was made. As we could not follow His Excellency in his remarks, which were delivered orally and at considerable length in the Marathi language, we requested His Excellency to furnish us with a written copy, so that we might be able to comprehend their nature, and to make further representations, if necessary, on the subject. This request was complied with, and we were then asked to return our reply within a week. Subsequently we received, in reply to our statements. His Excellency's yad, dated the 27th April, in para. 19 of which we found it stated that no further representations should be made on the subject. Relying, however, upon His Excellency's express promise to receive our representations within a week from the date of our last interview, and having subsequently received an intimation from His Excellency, some of us proceeded to visit His Excellency at his residence on the 4th May 1878. On this occasion, not only did we fail to achieve our object, but the reception we met with was most unbe coming to our rank and dignity. We cannot but allude here to the custom, usual on such occasions, namely, that the prince on the gadee receives some of us at some distance from his seat, and others by rising from the same. But on this occasion we observed a complete indifference on the part of His Excellency, who did not enter the recepr,ion-hall till after we had taken our respective seats. After some time His Excellency arrived, and we respectfully rose to receive him.His Excellency then asked us whether we had any representations to make, whereupon we produced a memorandum, which we had taken with us, and, with His Excellency's permission, commenced to read it. Scarcely was a part of it read, when we observed marks of anger on the face of His Excellency, who uttered some words in a threatening tone—words such as had never before been used by any prince on the gadee. We, however, continued respectfully to address His Excellency, but it only served to increase his anger. Leaving it to your Honour to consider whether it was possible for us, under these circumstances, to represent our case to His Excellency with anything like satisfaction, we proceed to submit that His Excellency having then declared in an excited state of mind his firm determination to speedily enforce the principles laid down in the consti tution of the Sirdar Court, we did not consider it advisable to prolong our con tention before His Excellency, and that accordingly we only presented a yad, stating that it was our intention to appeal against his decision, and praying that His Excellency might kindly refrain from enforcing the said principles till after the final result was known. We had not the slightest doubt that His Excellency would at once comply with this reasonable request, but we exceedingly regret to submit that this circumstance only increased the anger of His Excellency, who again let fall certain expressions highly insulting to our position. Considering it useless to prolong this interview, we were going to take leave of His Excellency, and to request him once more to reconsider the matter, when His Excellency abruptly left the hall, regardless of our presence and of certain formalities which are observed at the time of our departure. Feeling alarmed at this unusual demeanour, which, we feared, would lead to something serious, we forwarded to your Honour a memorandum dated the 7th May 1878, requesting your Honour not to arrive at any decision in any matter which might be reported to your Honour by His Excellency the Dewan until your Honour received our explanations on the matter. The opinions expressed by His Excellency the Dewan in his yad of the 27th April being in keeping with the principles formerly laid down by His Excellency, we do not consider it necessary to offer any additional remarks thereon. In conclusion, we earnestly pray that your Honour will be pleased to favour us with a written reply to this memorandum. We further pray that your Honour will, in the meantime, be pleased to adopt such measures as may prevent the operation of the new rules for the Sirdar Court &amp;c. on us during the time that our appeal is pending for final decision.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100023514894.0x000004_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>Mss Eur F126/95, ff 17-25</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023514894.0x000004</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>Mss Eur F126/95, ff 17-25</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Letter from the undersigned Sirdars, etc. of the Baroda Sate to Philip Sandys Melvill, Agent to the Governor-General of India, Baroda</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1878/1878</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-07-29T00:27:58</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>9 folios</extent><extent>Binding: The letter has been tied together along the left hand edge of each folio with string, excepting the last folio (25) which has come apart from it.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Letter regarding the policies being pursued by Sir T Mahadevrao (Sir Tanjore Madavha Rao) in the administration of the Baroda state, which had been entrusted to him owing to the minority of His Highness Sieajeerao Gaekwar (Sayajirao Gaekwad III), which the Sirdars believed had deprived them of some of their hereditary rights and privileges.The letter goes on to ask whether the policies being pursued by the Dewan (Sir T Madhava Rao) were in accordance with the original constitution of the Baroda State; and whether they are not entitled to have their reduced rights and privileges restored to them.Also given in the letter are details of the historic rights that they had enjoyed under successive rulers; their grounds for dissatisfaction with the administrative policy of the Dewan; statements given in the annual report for the state 1875-6 which have caused them concern; and the work previously undertaken by Sir Lewis Pelly in addressing their grievances which he had been unable to complete and which had been turned over to the Dewan.The letter concludes by reporting on a request from the Dewan to meet with some of the Sirdars, which had occurred after they had started to write the letter, and recounting the events of this meeting, the written account of it, and their later attempts at a meeting with the Dewan in which they were not met with the appropriate reception and which had resulted in them submitting the letter to the Agent to the Governor-General.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023514894.0x000004#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
