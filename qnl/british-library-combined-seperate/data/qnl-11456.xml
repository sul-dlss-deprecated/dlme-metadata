The memorandum details two variant policies: (1) regarding the Railway not as private property, but as a Turkish State railway, and that all its assets in Mesopotamia should therefore be transferred to the Iraq State pending transfer to an Allied Railway Company; and (2) a proposal for the internationalisation of the Railway to be controlled by Great Britain, France and Italy, and perhaps the United States of America. The advantages and disadvantages vis-a-vis British interests are then further discussed throughout the report.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Baghdad Railway</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Mesopotamia</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002e4#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
