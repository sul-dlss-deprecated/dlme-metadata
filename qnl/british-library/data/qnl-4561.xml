As regards the former heads, the cost oi the articles in question has been continually rising since the original estimate was framed, and as regards the latter it is particularly difficult to form an estimate beforehand of the repairs ancf alterations that may be required. In tnese circumstances I am to express the hope that the excess of the charges over the estimates will not be considered as unjustified.

I am, Sir, \ Your most obedient servant, 3 d/- A. A. Whelan, Assistant Secretary to the Government of India*5 No. 1134, dated Coonoor, the 16th May 1914. From—The Officer Commanding, R. I. M. S. “ Palinurus ”, To—-The Director, Royal Indian Marine. In accordance with your instructions contained in your Reference Sheet No. 2770 of 24th April 1914, I have the honour to submit the -following report on the possibilities of a harbour in the Clarence Strait, and also on the ^Survey of Bandar Abbas Roadstead. Having completed a detailed survey of the Cj^ence Strait from Laft Point to Bandar Abbas I have arrived at the opinion that the only points on the Mainland side of the Straits which offer possibilities of a harbour are :— (1) Bustaneh. (2) Bandar Abbas. (3) Laft Point. In each case a considerable outlay would be necessary in order to meet the ' requirements of a modern commercial port. Of the three above-named points, I t am strongly in favour of the Bustaneh area. In the case of the Laft Point Section the disadvantages so far outweight the advantages that it might, in my opinion, be eliminated. I The Bustaneh Area. —Bustaneh village is situated 570° West 16 miles from Bandar Abbas. Depths and Anchorage. —This section was surveyed on a scale of 2' = 1 Sea mile (see tracing) soundings in fathoms Tides and Currents . L . W . 0 . S. It shows an average depth of Spring rise .. .. 12 eet. 40 feet at low water ordinary springs and a Neap nse .. .. = 9 feet. least depth of 32 feet, over an anchorage Currents set EasCNorth East and West-South- ^ of ^ re mi , es _ ^ West seldom more than 1 knot per hour. * i , , shoals or rocky patches and the bottom throughout being a mixture of sand and mud, it affords excellent holding ground. Protection. —The anchorage is well protected from the shafc^al (which is the prevailing wind and here blows from the South-West and West-South-West) by the middle grounds which are long sand banks parallel to the coast. It is also well sheltered from the Northward by the high ranges of hills behind, it is however open to the Eastward, but wind from this direction is of infrequent occurrence. Approach. —There are no dangers in the approach and if the northern end of the middle bank and the spit off Sum were marked vessels could proceed without pilotage after rounding Kishm direct to the Port, due regard being given to the rise of tide which is 12 feet at springs and 9 feet at Neaps. Low line and foreshore. —The low line dries out from 4 to 6 cables from the high line, and this distance consists of a bed of dead coral and shells, forming a sort of concrete, covered with stiff sand and mud varying from 2 feet near the shore to 7 and 8 feet close to the low line. I have taken sectional borings from the high to the low line in the neighbourhood of Bustaneh and have retained samples of the concrete foundation. The low line 2 miles east of Bustaneh is steep to, the 3 and 5-fathom lines being respectively about 180 and 200 yards distant from it. This would appear a suitable place if the construction of Piers was contemplated. The beach is good firm sand. Bustaneh ^snec^.—Bustaneh is a thriving village of about 50 houses with a Persian Customs Post. The country to the ^Northward an,d Eastward has a com paratively fertile appearance with extensive date plantations. The soil is sandy covered with low scrub. The country behind is undulated and rising gradually inland to a series of low hills l£ miles distant. A range of hills rising to 950 feet known as the Koh-i-Namak range lies 2| miles to the North-West of Bustaneh, and the Khun Sukhr range rising 1,500 feet lies 5 miles to the ^ ®rth and Is orth-East, the gap between the two ranges occurs about 4 miles North of Bustaneh. c44fd ♦Water Supply .—There is no source of fresh water in the neighbourhood other than what is conserved in Brikehs (reservoirs) during the rainy season. Building material .—An abundance of hard stone of granite-like appearance is obtainable from the Koh-i-Namak range 2J miles distant. The chief industry of Bustaneh is the manufacture of grindstones for grinding corn, which are made from this stone. Conclusions .—In my opinion this section has greater possibilities for a com mercial port than any other part of the Clarence Strait, and if sufficient outlay was justified to develope it, it would make as good a port as any in the Gulf with the possible exception of Kuwait. Advantages and Disadvantages .— Advantages:— (1) A moderately sheltered anchorage. (2) Good holding ground. (3) Easy and safe approach. (4) Building stone available in the vicinity. (5) Pilotage unnecessary. (6) Possibility of constructing piers, and jetties out to the low line, where sufficient depth could be dredged for ships to berth. (7) Possibility of developing the Port by dredging operations if trade in creased. The disadvantages would appear to be :— (1) The distance between the high and low line, and the consequent expense if the construction of piers was contemplated. (2) Somewhat limited anchorage for deep draft vessels and difficulty of manoeuvring if the Port was crowded, but if pilots were available for berthing ships this difficulty would be obviated. (3) Absence of fresh water-supply. Trade and Town Site. If the proposed Port should also be required es a Trade Centre, the existing caravan routes now converging on Bandar Abbas could no doubt easily be diverted to Bustaneh, as a convenient gap occurs in the back ranges near here. ® Although I am hardly qualified to give an opinion on anything but the “ Sea P om j.2f a PP ears to me that the neighbourhood of Bustaneh should offer tew dimculties for the construction of a town ship. The strategic and tactical aspect of the various sections in the Clarence Strait have recently been amply dealt with by Captain B. W. Mainprise, R.E. Bandar Abbas (see tracing). * The Roadstead was surveyed on a scale of 3' = 1 Sea mile and soundings are shown m teet reduced to low water ordinary spring tides. &amp; Anchorage .-The anchorage is of ample extent for a large number of shirs the ho ding ground is excellent being either sand and mud, or soft mud, the chief dis- advantage being its shallowness, only 22 feet of water at low water ordinary spring tides being available at a distance of 2 miles, and ships drawing more than 2 T feet would have to he three miles off the town. The Islands of Larak Hormur and Kishm give protection from all winds except from the South-East Approach .The approach is easy and well defined, no difficuty should be experienced by vessels coming to the anchorage at night. Pilotage is ^necessary Facilities for shppmg-Owing to the great distance vessels have to lie from r,r r ■ ;i f Ts7 0 » Possibilities of developing the Port. —Dredging operations to enable ships to berth alongside wharfs or jetties would be quite impracticable, owing to the distance and the almost certainty that channels would rapidly silt up. In my opinion the only practicable method of developing the port would be the construction of a large boat harbour with piers for lighters to load and discharge alongside/ the harbour could be anywhere as convenient as the beach is hard firm sand all along the coast. As the beach dries out so far it would be necessary for the jetties to be run out beyond the low water line or else for a channel to be dredged inside the harbour. For the efficient handling of cargo, steam tugs and a lighterage service would be a necessity. Tides and Currents. —The tides are regular setting East-South-East, West- North- West and the currents at springs do not exceed 1 to 1J knots per hour. The spring rise at Bandar Abbas is 11 feet. Neap rise at Bandar Abbas is 6^ feet. Fresh Water. —Fresh water is only available from wells where it is slightly brackish, or from Birkehs or reservoirs, where rain water is collected and stored, the available supply at present would not suffice for any increase of p/opulation. The commercial and strategic possibilities, site for township, etc., were all fully reported on by Captain B. Mainprise, K.E. Laft Point Section. The possibilities of a harbour off Puhal Point on the Mainland opposite Laft Point seem to me very poor. The following are the disadvantages :— (1) An intricate approach of 24 miles. (2) Necessity of pilotage and extensive buoying. (3) Excessive depths except in a very restricted area. (4) Bad anchorage, the bottom being mostly rocky. (5) Limited foreshore suitable for constructing wharves, or jetties. (6) Distance from the existing trade routes. (7) Strong tides are Eddies. The following would appear to be the advantages . (1) Sheltered anchorage. (2) Good strategic position. (3) Possibilities of constructing wharfs for ships to be alongside within a maximum limit of 350 yards. (4) Ships of deep draft can lie (if moored) close to Puhal point. Anchoraqe.-The actual anchorage area off Puhal Point would only be about one mile by a quarter of a mile, the depths Southward of this -except on some rocky shoals of 3f fathoms-vary from 15 to 22 fathoms and would be unsuitable for anchoring, the narrowness of this area would only allow of one tier of vessels and to give swinging room, for them, mooring buoys would have to be laid down. Possibilities of Wharfage.— The only practicable site for wharfage would be that portion immediately adjacent to Puhal Point, where it is nearly steep to, and would require but little dredging, or if pile piers were constructed dredging operations might not be necessary! The extent of this frontage is about 350 yards a nd would accommodate about three ships at a time, to the eastward and westward of Puhal Point are extensive mud flats on which landing would not be practicable. Tides and Currents.-ln the area off Puhal Point the tides are strong and con flicting, also during springs the existence of rocky shoals and sudden great var tions of depths in the approaches cause overfalls and eddies which would complicate manoeuvring ships. The spring rise at Puhal Point is 13 feet. Neap rise at Puhal Point is 3 feet. At springs the currents set Bast by North, and West by South, from 2 to 2 J knots per hour. „ , „ ^ 0 n * ik sr—ra r G.

THE MOST HONOURABLE THE MARQUES3 OF CREWE, K.G., His Majesty’s Secretaky or State for India Simla, the 16th April 1914. My Lord Marquess, * o r ,' /, We have the honour to refer to your Lordship’s telegram dated the - 2nd May 1912, in which sanction was accorded to the survey of certain areas in ^ ^ the Persian Gulf, the cost involved therein being divided between the Home ^ and Indian exchequers. 2. In view of the Trans-Persian Railway projects we have since, as reported in our Marine despatch No. 16, dated the 6 th November 1913, considered it desirable to undertake a marine survey of the Clarence Strait; and, in order to ascertain whether a more suitable port than Bandar Abbas could, if neces sary, be created further to the westward in the neighbourhood of Laft Point, we further authorised a survey of the coast between Bandar Abbas and the mainland opposite Laft Point, Captain B. W. Mainprise, R.E., with a suitable survey party, being deputed from India for this duty. 3 . We regret that, owing to the urgency with which arrangements bad to be made in order to despatch Captain Mainprise and his party to carry out their work simultaneously with the survey of the Strait by the R.LM.S. *« palinurus,*’ the necessity for obtaining your Lordship’s previous sanction to the deputation of the party was overlooked. The results, however, are likely to be of considerable value, and we trust that in the circumstances our action will meet with your Lordship’s approval. The object with which these surveys have been undertaken is such as would ordinarily justify the cost being divided between the Home and Indian Governments ; but in view of the fact that the previous assent of the Treasury was not obtained, we leave it to your Lordship to decide whether a claim for a moiety of the expenditure, incurred on both the marine and coastal surveys, should be made upon the Imperial exchequer. The cost of the former is estimated at Rs. 14,989 and that of the latter at Rs. 4,500. 4. We would add that the cost of the survey of the Henjam anchorage, which was reported in our despatch No. 16, dated the 6 th November 1913, is estimated at Rs. 4,996. We presume that a moiety of this expenditure will he borne by the Home exchequer. We have the honour to he, My Lokd Marquess, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble Servants, (Signed) E. W. CARLYLE.

With reference to Sir Percy Cox’s letter No. 2473, dated the 9th August lQ i^ asking me to make some study of the question of water-supply for Bandar Abbas in the event of this port becoming at some time the terminus or first sea port of the Trans-Persian Railway, I have the honour to state that I have endeavoured during the past winter to find some source from which water could be niped into the town, and beg to submit herewith a brief note on the subject. Note on the ’water-supply of Bandar Abbas. Water is at present obtained by the inhabitants of Bandar Abbas from two sources:— (\) There are in or near the town about a dozen c&lt; birkehs ^ or vater reservoirs of the type familiar throughout the Gulf. Water is obtained from -atchment areas in the hills near Bandar Abbas, and thence is taken by channels, sometimes lined with masonry and occasionally covered over, to the birkehs. Manv of these “ birkehs ” have fallen into disrepair, and some into disuse. The supply depends entirely on the rainfall and is consequently precarious and uncertain, and the water when obtained though sweet, is very dirty and is said to produce guinea-worm. In a normal *year these birkehs -upplv water to the inhabitants of the town for about five or six months, but in a year* when the rainfall is below the normal or is badly d-slnbuted the supply is Ltnmllv much less. Reckoning the present population at 8,000 and the tmure pfpu^on at 25 000 this sup P ly 8 even in normal years, would not last more than k P . 1 fMxrnn this neriod would not be continuous as the birkehs woul({'probably be emptied between the different rainfalls. Moreover, should it be decided to locate the new port further to the west this supply would not be svailahle Some expenditure would be necessary in repairing the birkehs, available. Some expeno i uncertain nature of the supply The supply obtainable from “ birkehs ' may, I think, be .gnored. ( „ Wh „ t h. ™ about 200 or 300 yaids n o g jj e f rom t h e eastern end of the town, these wells are ^nated about h l T d t ; nterva i s a l on g the shore srm“r r w th“:s,°a“i »•»..«.«m f QK 1 No Q4 A used solely by the inhabitants of the village, who obtain scanty crops ^ vegetables and meLs from them . The so-called N.aband wells from whic'h °he inhabitants of the town obtain their best drinking water are s.mply surface wells dug in the sand about halfway between the v‘l age of Niaband and the 4.:^ font nf the. Khwaiata wells. All these surface wells water at the bottom ; they sea — a continuation in fact of the Khwajata about four feet deep with a foot or two ot are refill rapidly however, when exhausted. As long as this depth is not exceeded the supply is drinkable but directly any attempt is made to obtain more water by deepening the wells the supply turns brackish The water from the surface wells at Niaband maybe described as good for this part of the world though a slight brackishness is usually perceptible. The Khwajata wells are decidedly brackish and only drinkable by the local people. Surface wells can be dug almost anywhere along the shore and water will be found ; there seems to be no fixed source of supply, and I imagine that this is simply surface drainage from the low hills to the north of the town. As this water seems to pome from no definite source it would presumably be impossible to pipe any of it into the town; I doubt if it would suffice for a much larger population than the present; and as it would have to be carried in on the backs of men or animals as at present it would hardly meet the requirements of a large port. Moreover, it i s not absolutely sweet, and I may mention that I always get water from the mail steamers for my own household and never drink Niaband water. It will be necessary, therefore, to go further afield for a permanent supply. I have during the past winter travelled along the coast both to the east and to the west in the hope of finding some source whence water could be piped into the town. To the west there is no possible source of supply; the villages along the Clarence Straits depend almost entirely on rainwater collected in “ birkehs ” for their water; when this fails they are reduced to well water, but even the local inhabitants complain of this source of supply, which is brackish in the extreme, and I was unable to discover any springs except two tiny trickles near Puhal, which were both distinctly brackish and altogether insufficient in quantity to be of any practical use. To the eastward, however, there are several small streams which run down from the Kuh-i'Shamil to the sea : near Bandar Abbas these streams are very salt, but further to the east their quality improves. The first stream is encountered about nine miles from Bandar Abbas, and is known as the Rudkaneh-i-Shur, an apt name : it is saturated with salt. Beyond the village of Kalkazi, however, about 24 miles from Bandar Abbas there are two streams, the Rudkhaneh-i-Godu and Rudkhaneh-i-Tukht ; their waters are good for this country and would be drinkable even by Europeans, though not perhaps with relish. They would, however, do very well for domestic and municipal requirements, etc. Proceeding further east I came to the village of Nehu, at the extreme east of the Kuh-i-Shamil, 40 miles from Bandar Abbas, ant*' here at length I found a source of supply which would, I should imagine, amply suffice for a populaticJn considerably greater than that of the existing town, at any rate for drinking purposes. There are at Nehu three springs of excel lent water, which are at present utilised for turning some mills and for date cultivation. This supply has the further great advantage that it can be piped in from the source and would, therefore, be free from contamination. The pipe line would run across a flat plain, and would present no particular difficulties. I was unfortunately not competent to gauge the exact volume of discharge, but 1 , with the development of the port, the Nehu supply proved insufficient, the Uodu and I ukht streams could be piped in and utilised for domestic purposes, gardens, etc., the Nehu water being reserved for drinking. ... ^ ail ' n f this ’ ‘'j 6 on, y o^er place from which water could be piped in is ar “ have bee ' ablet0 ascertain. The Minab water is nnsciiilp tn 6 .

To sum up (i) The existing sources of supply, viz., “ birkehs ” and surface wells are port n ° US reasons unsu ^ e d to form the water-supply of a large *3 There are three sprmgs of excellent water at Nehu, about 40 miles Bandar Abbas which could be piped in and would furnish amole drinking water for the requirements of a town of about 25,000 inhabi- tants. If more water was required for municipal purposes etc it could be obtained from the Godu and Tukht streams, about’ 2 a miles from Bandar Abbas. 0 Failing this, water would have to be piped in from Minab, a distance of about 55 miles. The Minab water is good and abundant but the distance is greater and the water could not be protected from contamination in the same way as the Nehu water.

Cox to Sir Edward Grey,—{Received February 8.) (No. 2. Commercial. Confidential.) Sir, Bushire, January 19, 1913. IN continuation of my despatch No. 7, Commercial, dated the 18th August, I I HAVE the honour to address you in connection with the question of railway terminal facilities at ports on the Persian Gulf, which, as I observe from recent corre spondence in print, has been engaging the attention of His Majesty’s Government. 2. In the penultimate paragraph of a report on railway possibilities in the sphere of this residency, my commercial adviser, Mr. Chick, urged “ a careful investigation of the best means of suitably improving Bush ire harbour and the probable cost; and a similar investigation at Bunder Abbas.” It is now apparent that the Societe d’Etudes has already begun to contemplate the desirability of improvements in the ports included in its scheme for branch lines to the Trans-Persian Railway, it being understood that the ports chiefly affected would be Bush ire aad Bunder Abbas. . • • j His Majesty’s Government have recently considered it expedient to depute engineer officers of their own to advise them as to the relative merits of vanous routes in South-East Persia ; and it is, I submit, no less necessary and important that they should know, in advance of all applications for concessions, whether_ by the Trans- Persian Railway or by the Persian Railways Syndicate, the possibility ^LP 1 * 0 ^ 1 ' mate cost of improving the harbours or anchorages at Bushire and Bunder Abbas in order to enable them to cope sufficiently with railway requirements. 3. As regards Bushire the position is this :— The harbour was elaborately and carefully surveyed in 1904. It was held that there was sufficient water in the channel connecting the outer and inner anchorages o accommodate the ships of 17 feet draft ordinarily plying to the Gulf, but that m view of the existing state of prospects of trade through Bushire the deepening ot the approaches to the inner anchorage (Khor Deira) would be too costly an operation to undertake. It was considered, however, that the dredging of a canal from the inner anchorage (Khor Deira) to the customs creek (Khor Sultam) was feasible, and should be have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter which I have addressed to the Govern ment of India, on the subject of railway concessions and terminal facilities at ports on the Persian Gulf.

Addendum to “ Report and Survey of the'Coast in the neighbourhood of Bandar Abbas with a view to determining the best site for a commercial port. Report on Bustaneh. Bustaneh is a village of some hundred houses situated on the coast about 25 miles west of Bandar Abbas. From the hills immediately west of the village a ■rood green limestone is available which the villagers work up into hand-mdl stones ind send to Basrah in small sailing vessels. At the time of visiting Bustaneh (September 1913) there were at least 1,000 such stones collected on the beach ready foi shipment. completely sheltered to the south-west and south by ( } k' island and partially so to the east by Hormuz. The deta.'s of the approach, size of anchorage, tide, bottom, etc., must be determined from the Admiralty charts. It is understood that these are favour- (h\ The foreshore is ample and consists of good, firm sand. Judging by the distance at which the sailing boats were riding at anchor, and by the position of the fishermen’s traps, the foreshore shelves slowly. The , P ' ctqtps ind mv own recollection confirms his statement, SYow t^ export lU 500 yards of sand To give, therefore a minimum depth of 6 feet at low water it is probable that jetties CwO to 700 yards in length would be required. (c) If the conditions noted above are proved to exist, wharf would not be India, Foreign Secretary's No J 7 ol, dated ?n af .4 The ground to the north of Bustaneh is low-lying and shows strong deposits &amp; depicting considerable dampness. Its healthiness is, therefore, doubt ful. Moreover, the hills to the w r est w r ill cut off the breeze from that direction. To the west there is a small area of giound somewhat higher, but much restricted by the hills. ^ ^ Although this site may be more healthy than that to the north, it is certain to be intensely hot by reason of the radiation from the hills. (e) As regards water, there are four wells in Bustaneh, ad more or less bitter So long as they hold out, all drinking water is brought from the two “Birkehs,” or surface water reservoirs, to the west, one being three quarters of a mile and the other, Birkeh Haji Daudi, five miles distant. It is not considered, however, that the water-supply question is in superable. If Bustaneh has other good points to recommend it as a commercial port, it is pretty certain that modern methods will produce a sufficiency of drinking water. (/) As regards its position strategically so long as Henjam is held Bustaneh is protected for the channel through the Clarence Straits to the west is too complicated for war ships to risk. (g) As in the case of Bandar Abbas, block houses would be the best defence against raiders. {h) As regards existing trade routes, please see the remarks shown under the headings for Puhal which will apply equally to Bustaneh. (j) Practically no labour exists at present, but there would doubtless be a response to any demand. (k) There is no fuel obtainable locally, but wood could be brought from the mangrove swamps beyond Khamir. (/) Good limestone is available in the hills to the west of Bustaneh, but the amount is limited. The foot hills were strewn with small boulders of an indifferent sandstone, but good enough for concrete. Summary. At Bustaneh itself the shore conditions are not favourable. The site is cramped, is cut off from the westerly breeze and is low-lying. Unless the naval surveys dis close conditions wh.ch differ very considerably from what they appear to be, the foreshore cannot be considered suitable for a commercial port. To the west of Bustaneh the hills are so close to the shore that no site for a assort Wbl ^ t0 the ^ ^ loW ' lying °P en P lain offers no advantages of f S P^ of its comparatively open anchorage the general conditions prevailing at Bandar Abbas seem to be much superior to those at Bustaneh.

In view of the conclusions arrived at in my report, I consider such a survey very necessary. t Mild therefore susfiest that steps be taken without delay to ensure that such a ™ Should be mafe! In anticipation of this the land survey of Banc ar Abbas has been made on a scale of 3 inches to 1 nautical mile in order to correspond w ith the sea survey. ^ S 4 . The following is a brief resume of the land operation^: ' The Survey Party under Captain Mainprise, R.E., consisting of three Indian Roorkee surveyors and 6 khalassis, arrived at Bandar Abbas on 16:h September 1913 and left again on 13th October. In order not to attract attention it was decided to start work at Suru, 3 west of Bandar Abbas, and to leave the detailed survey of the latter place to be carried out last of all. The period 19th to 21 st was spent in considering the conditions prevailing at Bandar Abbas and making a rapid reconnaissance 12 miles to the westwards. Work started on 22nd September on the section Sum to Khu^d-Surkh where the headquarter camp was pitched.

( 1 ) The requirements of a good commercial port are ■ (a) A sheltered anchorage, easy of approach, with good holding grouncl close to the shore (say within 2 miles), and with a sufficiency of room to give ships freedom of movement. . lb) Ample foreshore with steeply sloping beach allowing of the construction of short jetties 1 where lighters can load and unload at all states of the tide and under any conditions of wind. , , , _ , , , (c) Possibilities of a wharf where ships can be berthed and can deal with cargo direct. (d) On shore there should be sufficient room— (i) For railway sidings and sheds. (ii) For housing the labouring population. (Hi) For a native town. (iv) For a residential quarter. (e) A good water supply. (/) A good strategic position. (g) Easily defended. (h) Must be well situated as regards existing trade routes. (i) Must provide a sufficiency of labour. (j) Fuel and building material must be obtainable. (2) Before considering how far Bandar Abbas meets these conditions, a short description of the town as it exists is necessary. # Bandar Abbas is 810 miles by sea from Karachi and 4^°® naval coaling station. The town hes in fnu s approximately one and a and is built on the extreme edge born the shore. The housesnum- half miles m length and running back hal storeyed. The population, ber about 1,000 and are all cl mud, many ° • es f jrnated at a maximum of which varies considerably with the season of the year, is estimated 10,000 in the winter. , , f , , . , are n0 streets, but each house or group of (3) Except for the main bazaar th each enc l 0 sure is entirely separated houses stands m its own enclosure ana, a. en tails a winding course round from the one next to it; thus to pass toffilof any sok and the heavy sand the various enclosures.

C645FD6 ( 4 ) The hills in the immediate vicinity of the town disclose no suitable stone for road-making nor anything in the way of kunkur . It would probably be neces sary to bring metalling by sea from Hormuz island, ten miles distant. ( 5 ) There are a number of date, tamarisk, keekur, bher and other trees in the town, and tree plantation on a considerable scale would temper the summer heat. This would also tend to slightly increase the annual rainfall, which is now some ten inches only. ( 6 ) The beach is good, firm sand and the tide runs out some 150 to 200 yards. Opposite the centre of the town is a pier 100 yards long by 30 yards wide, which is high and dry. at low water. Behind the town the plain slopes very gradually to some low foot-hills one to two miles distant about 100 feet high; beyond these there is a tangle of broken ground which eventually reaches heights of 500 to 700 feet. ( 7 ) The commercial aspect of Bandar Abbas is dealt with in the latest trade retuns available, a copy of which is attached to this report. (No. 5033 Annual Series Diplomatic and Consular Reports. Persia. Report for the year March 1911 to March 1912.) ( 8 ) The water supply of Bandar Abbas is dealt with later; see page 7(e). (9) The British Consulate is three-quarters of a mile to the north-east of the town and is an imposing double-storeyed structure built of stone in lime, com monly reported to be the finest house in the Persian Gulf. It has a large enclosure on the north side, sub-divided into courtyards and quarters which on occasions of disturbance have harboured as many as 600 refugees. It contains its own post and telegraph offices and has a large well giving an ample supply of brackish water practically undrinkable. A defensible mud wall surrounds the whole, with circular bastions at the corners for flank defence. The Consulate might well be made the centre of the residential quarter. ( 10 ) Applying the requirements of a commercial port as laid down in paragraph ( 1 ) to Bandar Abbas— (a) The anchorage is sheltered from all quarters except the south-east. The prevailing wind however is from the west-south-west, and according to Captain Bamber of the British India Steam Navigation Company, who has been for the most part of his 27 years service on the Gulf run, there are only two or three days in the whole year when the wind from the south-east is so strong as to inconvenience light ering to any great degree. Captain Biscoe, who has been the British Consul at andar Abbas for four years, entirely agrees with Captain Bamber’s estimate. There is no monsoon. t ^ he approach is easy and well defined, no pilots being required. The islands of ara ormuz and Kishm offer good sites for beacons. Bottom is good, firm sane giving a firm holding. There is ample room for ten or twelve ships to lie out m the roadstead without unduly impeding navigation. Ships drawing 20 feet can he within two miles of the shore and ships of 25 feet within three miles.

Wood is brought in by road from the hills to the north, and also from the mangrove swamp near Khamir, 50 miles to the west, whence it is brought by boat. ( 1 ) No building material is available in the immediate vicinity, and the stone in the surrounding hills is a particularly soft sandstone that disintegrates at once. It is quite useless for any sort of construction work. The stone for building the Bri tish Consulate was brought from Hormuz island, and the old Dutch Fort there would supply an ample quantity of undressed stone and a small amount of dressed stone. The British Consulate was built in 1906 , through the agency of the Indian Public Works Department, and it is probable that much valuable information as to the resources and labour available in Bandar Abbas could be supplied by that De partment if required. PABT II.— The country between Bandar Abbas and Puhal. ; Moving westwards from Bandar Abbas, the section of the coast from Sum via M ( 2 ). Chiju to Dugird is quite impossible for the establishment of a port as low tide discloses an immense expanse of mud flats. Dugird to Khun Surkh, whilst providing a fair beach at all states of the tide, has no advantages in this respect over Bandar .Abbas. Ships drawing 20 feet of *Not known. water must lie out * miles from the shore, and those of 25 feet * miles. Inland there is lack of space, as a low ridge runs parallel to the shore at a distance of half a mile only. Immediately north of this ridge is much broken country. From Khun Surkh to Bustaneh the foreshore conditions are similar to those prevailing at Bandar Abbas. _ Inland there is a low-lying plain subject to floods, and from the total lack of any habitations and of any cultivation, it is probable that water is either non-existent or is so salt as to be useless. From Bustaneh to the Rud-i-Kul an immense inland plain, low-lying, constantly flooded and always damp owing to strong salt deposits, affords no site for a town, whatever may be its advantages regarding foreshore and anchorage. West of the Rud-i-Kul is the Puhal site which is dealt with in Part III. PART III. —Puhal. Puhal is situated on a tongue of land bounded on the east by the Rud-i-Kul Map (5). whose waters are extremely salt; on the south . . an d to the west by the Clarence Straits, and on the west and north by hills which culminate towards the west in a height known as Khamir Peak, from the village that lies at the southern slope of the range. Puhal itself consists of a series of scattered hamlets extending across the plain from east to west. The total number of houses is probably about 150, but in Sep tember 1913 these were all deserted, and the few inhabitants that there were, were living m small reed huts and tending the date plantations. This part of the country is apparently subject to raids in the cold weather, when the inhabitants for safety sake betake themselves across the water to Kishm island. This site possesses possibilities tor a commercial port and these will be taken in detail. (a) The anchorage is completely sheltered and 20 foot ships can lie within tNot known i.- ^ .yards of the shore, and 25 foot . ships within -j- yards. The total width only, and the tide flows two and « 'll if 11 ? cl l annel l is one and a quarter miles a bad holding ground.

I he narrow fan-way means that shipsonly anchor in one line and those on the flanks are therefore somewhat distant from the landing place. The strong tide would considerably delay the movements of lighters. (b) and (c) The total length of foreshore is 350 yards only, and all work must , concentrated on this front as both to the east and west mud flats at low tide pre- nnv landing. Jetties 100 yards long would be required for lighters, and a vent any ianu g wharf 200 yards long would allow 20 foot To be corroborated on receipt of sea survey. ships to lie alongside all states of the tide. These wharves would require to be of piles so as not to obstruct the tide; otherwise the swirl set up by striking the wharf at right angles would probably draw out the foundation at the outshore ends and silt up in shore. It is this possibility of a wharf and the comparatively short jetties which would be required that constitute the great advantages of the Puhal site. In other points Puhal is distinctly inferior to Bandar Abbas as will be seen. I (d) On shore there is a fringe of high ground somewhat restricted in area which would suffice for sidings and sheds but nothing else. Then comes a low-lying plain subject to floods, and always damp on account of the strong salt deposits, which is quite unsuitable for any habitations. These must be built right back in line with the hamlets as shown on map (5). Having crossed this plain there is ample room for a native quarter, town and residential quarter. (e) The present supply of water is ample, and although brackish it is quite &lt;rood as Persian water goes. There are several “birkehs” to be found but they were all empty at the time of making this report (September 1913). As far as could be ascertained, there are no really sweet wells in the neighbourhood.

If necessary safety might be ensured by mining the channel. In) As in the case of Bandar Abbas, blockhouses would be the best defence against raiders. Any advance by a civilized enemy across the plain to the east of ?he Rud-tKul could only be supported by artillery on the open plain in full view «£ the defenders artillery placed exceptionally favourably on the high ground at the foot of the hills The right bank of the Rud-i-Kul is higher than the left, and there- fore favours the defence considerably.

There being no site between Bandar Abbas and Puhal, the question of the best site for a commercial port is solved by weighing up the merits of these two places. At first it might seem that the advantages of Bandar Abbas are far superior to those of Puhal. However, the fact that at the latter place ships can lie up within 200 yards of the shore, that only short jetties are required and that a wharf is a possibility are points in favour of Puhal that must not be lightly disregarded. But the narrow channel, the strong tide, the bad holding ground, the necessity for pilots and the fact that Puhal entails an extra thirty mi es of steaming both ways, possibly against the tide, are strong factors against Puhal. There is the further considera tion that the amount of cargo dealt with by many of the ships visiting that part of Persia is so small that it would certainly not pay to incur wharfage dues. Ihis Would therefore mean lightening, and once this has to be done it is not very material whether the distance from the shore be two miles or only a quarter of a mile. Turning to the land conditions there is the fact that Bandar Abbas is a long established port; that labour and good water are procurable; that its site is better suited for the development of a port, and that the hills do not form a heat-radiating back ground. Would it be worth while to carry most of the. trade some 30 to 35 miles by road both ways in order to secure better loading and unloading facilities? Taking all these pointy into consideration I am of opinion that for the present and for many years to come the best interests of commerce and financial economy will be served by the development of Bandar Abbas as a commercial port. Should theincreaseof trade ever bring Bandar Abbas to the prosperity of a second Bombay or Karachi, then will come the time to consider the construction of wharves at Puhal and docks at Laft Point, a favourable site on Kishm island immediately opposite Puhal. For the present, however, all efiorts should be concentrated on Bandar Abbas. . v 26th October 1913, B. W. MAINPRISE, Captain, R.E o G. M. Press, Simla.—No. C. 645 F.

With reference to my letter No. 198, dated 19th January 1913, to the / Government of India, I have the honour to forward for the information of l Government a Note drawn up by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Bandar Abbas on the existing harbour conditions and possibilities of that port. 2. The information and observations contained in Captain Biscoe’s communication suggest that quite apart from the question of the possible need • for shifting the harbour further up the Clarence Strait, in certain eventualities, there is a good deal that could be done to improve the anchorage and lighterage facilities of the present port. The fact that a vessel of the ordinary type of cargo vessel visiting the port, can find a safe anchorage 2 miles nearer the Customs Pier than the present buoyed anchorage is in itself sufficient evidence that the approaches need surveying. 1 venture therefore to press the recommendation made in my letter above-quoted, that an expert examination of the position should be undertaken at an early date. A r o/# on the port of Bandar Abbas. The port of Bandar Abbas possesses one outstanding advantage^namely, that it is sheltered by a natural breakwater of islands from almost all winds ; it shares however with Bushire the drawback of a very gradually shelving beach, with the result that ships have to anchor a considerable distance from the shore. ^ orr J any wind except the south-east the islands of Qishm, Larak and Hormuz afford ample protection. Against the south-east wind the port is not protected to the same extent but even when this is blowing it is seldom rough enough to hamper the discharge of cargo: moreover the south-east wind blows but seldom here and almost invariably seems to veer round to south-w r est. I his latter is the prevailing wind and blows for probably 300 days in the year. In snort as far as shelter is concerned, the port leaves little to be deswed. 1 here is of course no monsoon, and practically no rough weather of any kind in summer. 2. As regards the anchorage the position is as follows* The present buoy marking the 4 fathom anchorage is 2 miles out and to the eastward of the town. It was moved to the eastward at my suggestion solely to facilitate sailing boats going off to ships in the prevailing south-west wind. Four fathoms may, I think, be regarded as sufficient water for the ordinary steamers that come up the Gulf: the large majority of them anchor alongside the buoy, and a good many come well inside it. I do not know whether it would be possible to find an anchorage closer in, but the harbour has not been surveyed for a great many years, and many masters of ships have told me that the existing^ charts are of ve^ doubtful accuracy. It would therefore be necessary to survey the entire port anew, and in this connection I venture to append the following information which 'has kindly been supplied to me by CaPUm Grant of the S S. “ Bahrain, ” who never anchors at the buoy, but goes close t, opposite the town. He writes 'My position for anchorage is 2 ° fee ‘ if W. S. Customs Flagstaff N. 9 W., Consulate Flagstaff N. &lt;to ^YA' Vthe of Hormuz S. 64 W., all bearings magnetic. This position is « Customs Flagstaff and the way to approach 't 1S 0 , therefore that N. 9 W. and come straight in on that bearing. 1 U will b e, seen therefore that 20 feet of water can be found a mije out, and 4 fa 10ms wou P were not more than ij miles out. It is possible t ere ore ‘ . .1 present carried out an anchorage might be found a goo ea development^ t he one. If this was the case then the present drawback to the developmen^ot the port would be in some measure removed, and it wou se 1 to become the terminus of the projected rail a ay. /. r /Did2 3. As regards landing facilities, there is a ^hort masonry pier, but IJahf can only come alongside it at high tide, and at low water it is high and dry* T S permit of goods being discharged at all states of the tide and to permit 0 f launches and heavily-laden barges being brought alongside it would be neces ° to extend this for a distance of about 100 yards, an operation w r hich would^ should think, present no particular difficulty, but regarding which I am ha HI competent to form an opinion. ^ Climate .—Bandar Abbas enjoys an evil reputation both as regards unhealth' ness and heat. As regards the former I have no hesitation in stating that it is unmerited. The actual town itself is probably extremely unhealthy owing it’s filthy and squalor, but for Europeans who would doubtless live outside th° town as they do in Bushire the place is certainly not unhealthy. As regards climate, here again surroundings play an important part. The winter is extremely pleasant, the summer hot and damp. The actual temperature however is not very high, and probably compares favourably with many places in India. No official temperature records are maintained, but a thermometer placed in a verandah registers normally 96° to 102° F. during June, July and August. The nights are almost invariably cool. If Europeans ‘ had some of the amenities of civilisation they .vould not find the summer very trying. _ Water-supply. The water-supply is limited and bad, though drinkable It is mostly obtained from surface wells about a mile distant from the town Should the place ever develop to any considerable extent it would present a serious problem It is possible that an artesian water-supply might be obtained and as ,t would probably no, cost very much it w ould certainly sfen, worth whl experimenting m this direction. This could perhaps be done 'in connection with the railway survey which is being carried out at present. Alternative fort.—h has been suggested that it would probably be expedient to create a new port to the westwards towards the Clarence Straits a, d he anchorage at Laft point has been proposed. If a new port is to be created hen the mam land directly oppos.te Laft point is the only possible alternative for the whole way along the north shore of the Clarence Straits from ’ miles west of Bandar Abbas till opposite Laft point there are Iholls n^ h it sand ; these shoals as will be seen from a glance at the chan ev.en f,° , n't g^hm r0 Apir e oac t hing Laft hllwew^htrare shoah'^f^h^d's 0 SKMA th “ - &amp; th^commermaf poiit°of^v^^ it'wmalcf ^mlTto S’Tf ■ Sn compensating gain.

I have the honour to address you in connection with the question of railway terminal facilities at ports on the Persian Gulf, which, as I observe from recent correspondence in print, has been engaging the attention of His Majesty’s Government. 2. In the penultimate paragraph of a report on railway possibilities in the sphere of this Residency, my Commercial Adviser, Mr. Chick, urged “ a careful Residency letter. No. 1840, dated 18th August investigation of the best means of suitably iqi 2. improving Bushire harbour, and the probable cost: and a similar investigation at Bandar Abbas. ” It is now apparent that the Socidtd d’Etudes has already begun to contem plate the desirability of improvements in the ports included in its scheme for branch lines to the Trans-Persian Railway, it being understood that the ports chiefly affected would be Bushire and Bandar Abbas. His Majesty’s Government have recently considered it expedient to depute Engineer officers of their own to advise them as to the relative merits of various routes in South-East Persia; and it is, I submit, no less necessary and important that they should know, in advance of all applications for concessions whether by the Trans-Persian Railway or by the Persian Railways Syndicate, the possibility and approximate -cost of improving the harbours or anchorages at Bushire and Bandar Abbas in order to enable them to cope sufficiently with railway requirements. 3. As regards Bushire, the position is this •.— The harbour was elaborately and carefully surveyed in igop. It was held that there was sufficient water in the channel connecting the outer and inner anchorages to accommodate the ships of 17 feet draft ordinarily plying to the Gulf but that in view of the existing state of prospects of trade through Bushire the deepening of the approaches to the inner anchorage (Khor Deira) would be Admiral, ,o Foreign Department, telegram dated tOO COStly an operation tO Undertake _ It 17th October 1904* was considered, however, that the dredging of a canal from the inner anchorage (Khor Deira) to the Customs Creek (Khor Sultani) was feasible and should be our aim for the present.

WOuld be little difficulty in dredging the Department, letter No. 3542. dated 5th June 1905. proposed canal, but ttiat It UOUIO DC advisable to make borings before commencing operations in order to discern the exact nature of the material to be dredged; he added that our experience of the behaviour of the harbour-floor in the past suggested the proba 1 ity ia a dredged channel could de easily maintained. 4. The preliminary action required in the case of Bushire would therefore appear to be the carrying out of the necessary boring and then the framing of an estimate for the dredginf of the canal. 1 am o opinion that if the boring was done unobtrusively by or off the RI.M.S. ‘Lawrence, or Pahnu us which is a frequent visitor, no question would be likely to be raised by the 1 oca authorities and no preliminary reference to the Persian Government would be needed. 5.

Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant regarding railway projects in Southern Persia. I am to transmit, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, a copy of a memorandum, dated the 19th November, summarising certain correspondence which took place on the subject up to the end of 1911.° With regard to later developments, I am to state that your letter correctly reviews / the position ; that this department is still in communication with the Socidte d’Etudes regarding the scope of its activity, and that Sir E. Grey proposes to consult the Marquess of Crewe on that subject shortly; that the attitude His Majesty’s Government may adopt towards a concession for a line from Bushire to Shiraz and Ispahan is governed (a) by the following paragraph in the memorandum communicated by Sir E. Grey to the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 4th October, 1912 : “'With regard to further railway concessions in the neutral zone, His Majesty’s Government are quite prepared to discuss the matter with the Russian Government, and to request the syndicate to send out a representative to St. Petersburgh. His Majesty’s Government may ask Russia to consent to them in due course, it being understood that such consent would net be claimed as a matter of right until the Trans-Persian Railway shall have proceeded beyond the Russian sphere;” and (b) by Sir E. Grey’s admission to the Russian Government in 1911 that lines in the neutral sphere should be international. By the word “ international ” Sir E. Grey meant merely 1 to convey that His Majesty’s Government would not insist upon the exclusion of all 1 foreign participation, though he has always felt that such lines should be predominantly British in so far as concerns control. I am to add that it is not in present circumstances proposed that the Mohammerah- Khoremabad line should be classed as “ international ” in this sense An opportunity may arise, in the course of further negotiation, for intimating to the Russian Government the interest of His Majesty’s Government in the Bushire- Shiraz-Ispahan project, though it will not be overlooked that Ispahan itself is placed in the Russian sphere by the terms of the Anglo-Russian agreement.

CONFIDENTIAL. .'&gt;*■ \ I \ [November 19.] Section 4 . [49434] No. 1 . Memorandum by Mr. dc Bernhardt on Railway Construction in South Persia. 1 . Have we at any time told Mr. Greenway that we would give him preferential treatment in any application he or his friends may make for concessions for railways in the neutral and British spheres in Persia, other than the Mohammerah-Khoremabad line? Sir L. Mallet would like to see the precise wording of any undertakings we may have given. 2 . We originally, in October 1908, specified to the Russian Government the lines in South Persia in which His Majesty’s Government were specially interested. How often have we repeated this information to Russia, and on what dates between October 1908 and October 1912? 1 . In the spring of 1911 His Majesty’s Government decided that it was of importance to British interests to secure preferential rights in regard to certain railway concessions in South Persia, and, after consultation with His Majesty’s Minister, it was settled that the application would be more palatable to the Persian Government if made through a commercial syndicate rather than by His Majesty’s Government themselves. 1 can find no direct request to Mr. Greenway or anyone else to undertake this matter, but there are allusions in the minutes on the secret papers of 1911 to interviews between that gentleman and Sir L. Mallet, and between Colonel Picot and Mr. Maxwell, touching upon the formation of a syndicate for this purpose. On the 15th July, 1911, Mr. Green way informed this Office that a syndicate would be formed, and would be prepared to enter into contracts for, and undertake construction of, the following railways in Persia :— To Sir G. Barclay, No. 52, Tel., Feb. 14, ’ll [5647]. To Sir G. Barclay, No. 75, Tel., Mar. 6, ’ll [8296]. Mr. Green way, July 15, ’ll [28215]. ( 1 .) From Mohammerah and (or) Khor Musa to Khoremabad or Burujird; ( 2 .) From Bunder Abbas to Kerman ; (3.) From Bunder Abbas to Shiraz ; (4.) From Bunder Abbas to Mohammerah ; and, he added, that the end in view was the eventual extension of some of these lines up to or within the Russian sphere. It was pointed out to Mr. Green way, in reply, that as the proposed extensions of To Mr. these lines would end at points touching, or within, the border of the Russian sphere Greenway, of influence in Persia, Sir E. Grey presumed that, in view of article 1 of the Anglo- Russian arrangement of the 31st August, 1907, the syndicate would not ask for the L support of His Majesty’s Government in regard to such extensions. From this answer, on the principle expressum facit cessare taciturn, it no doubt was inferred by Mr. Greenway that His Majesty’s Government would support him in obtaining the concessions enumerated, except in so far as concerned extensions up to or within the Russian sphere. While, therefore, we had not up to the end of 1911 specifically told Mr. Greenway that we would give him preferential treatment (except as regards the Mohammerah—Khoremabad line), the upshot of the above communications seems to be that His Majesty’s Government are bound to him in fact, if not in express terms. This conclusion seems to be borne out by the following correspondence which took place in 1912 :— On the 15th January the Persian Railways Syndicate enquired whether His Majesty’s Government had given any assurance of support to any syndicate or persons gy n di ca t e , in connection with railway construction in Persia, and they were informed, in reply : Jan. 15, ’12 J _ [2412]. (1.) That His Majesty’s Government had been approached in December 1911 by To Persian certain French financiers who, in concert with British houses of standing and with Kailuajs Russian financial houses, were interested in the construction of a Trans-Persian 3 ^ Railway, and had been asked their views in regard to such a project; and that His £ 1304 ].

Majesty’s Government had told them that they had no objection i n principle t 0 a line and, indeed, regarded it benevolently, i i -r&gt; (2.) That in 1903 Lord Lansdowne had informed the Persian Transport Comn a that whenever railway construction was permitted in I eisia, due regard would so/ as His Majesty’s Government were concerned, be had to their claims to prefereJ! treatment in respect of proposals for the construction of lailways in districts traver^ by the roads of the company. The syndicate were assured that with this exception His Majesty’s Government had given no promise of support to any persons or syndicates in connection wit]) railway construction in Persia. 2. With regard to the second question, on the 14th October, 1908, His Majesty's charge d’affaires at St. Petersburgh handed to M. Tsvolsky a memorandum in whicii he stated that His Majesty’s Government, besides the southern section of a line which I might be constructed from Julfa to Mohammerah, would specify, as the concessions which mostly concerned them, the lines Bunder Abbas to Kerman, and Bunder Abbas via Shiraz to Ahwaz, with the option to construct a port at Khor Musa. To this communication no reply appears to have been made by the Russian Government. In May 1911 His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh was instructed to inform the Russian Government of the conditions on which His Majesty’s Government were willing to assent in principle to the proposed Trans-Persian Railway and toaoree to the initiation of negotiations between its promoters in St. Petersburgh and London One of these conditions was that Russia should support the demands made by Great Britain on the Persian Government for the concession of the following lines :— (a.) From Mohammerah to Khoremabad, with a branch to a port to be constructed at Khor Musa; (b.) From Bunder Abbas or Charbar via Regan and Bam to Kerman; (c.) From Bushire via Aliabad to some point on a line— (d.) From Bunder Abbas vi&amp; Shiraz to Ahwaz. It was proposed that the main-line and those of the above branches which lie in » the neutral sphere, i.e., (a), (c), and (d), should be internationalised, but that the branch in the British sphere should be a purely British project. Sir G. Buchanan reported on the 16th May, 1911, that he had communicated to the Russian Government the conditions of His Majesty’s Government in this connection. A/r aP' 11 ^ ^ ^8th June following, Mr. O’Beirne reported that he had been informed by , , era . he had not intended to reply to Sir G. Buchanan’s communication, an ^at it would be time enough to go into the detailed questions raised by the conditions imposed by His Majesty’s Government when the “ Societe d’Etudes” had completed its task. When dealing with the conditions laid down by Great Britain, t le ussian ovemment would probably put forward conditions of their own, and this would involve lengthy negotiations. Sir G. Buchanan was told that it would not be necessary to press the Russian o\ernmen or a reply until the “Societe d’Etudes ” had made their report. of 1911° m ° re COrreS ^ 0n( ^ enCe a PP ears h ave taken place on the subject to the end Foreign Office, November 19, 1912.

I an (’irectec? hy Secretary Sir Etfwart?

Sir E. Grey observes that the Government of India have modified their views with respect to this line, to the construction of which they originally expressed themselves opposed. The Marquess of Crewe is already aware of the reasons for which it is considered undesirable to press the Persian Government at the present moment for any concessions of this nature with the exception of that for a line from Mohammera to Khoremabad and His Under Secretary of State, India Office . Lordship(51852/12) Lordship will &amp;gret that the objections to doing so apply to the line from Bushire to Shiraz and Isfahan as forcibly as to the others. These objections are shortly set forth in the penultimate paragraph of the confidential letter from this Department to Mr. Greenway of the 29th. ultimo, copy of which has been forwarded to your Office.

Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in which you ask for -guidance regarding the advisability of dispatching, at an early date, a representative of the Persian Railways Syndicate to Tehran in order to press forward the negotiations now pending between the syndicate and the Persian Government. Sir E. Grey has had the whole question of your interests under careful consideration, and he has arrived at the conclusion that the most expedient and practicable course is to concentrate in the first instance on the concession for the Mohammerah-Khoremabad line. While he recognises the claim of your syndicate to promote further developments in railway construction in due course, he is led to believe that, if His Majesty’s Government were to press at this stage for more extensive concessions in the neutral i sphere of Persia, the Russian Government might advance corresponding claims, which would not improbably give rise to difficulty and delay in furthering your more \ immediate interests. Such being the case, Sir E. Grey would recommend that the Mohammerah- Khoremabad concession should be pushed in priority to all others; in these circumstances, and at this juncture, he does not think it necessary for you to send a special representative to Tehran.

[November 23.] Section 1, [47191] No - L Foreign Office to Sir W. Garstin. (Confide ’ ) Foreign Office, November 23, 1912. 1 ’ I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of Viscount Errington’s letter of the 18th instant, in which he furnishes certain explanations respecting the enclosures in the letter addressed by you on the 5th instant to this department on the subject of the Trans-Persian Railway project. ^ Before dealing, as promised in my preliminary letter of the 14th November, with the proposals now under consideration, I am to recall the important reservations which His Majesty’s Government have consistently maintained in regard to this question. In a letter dated the 2nd March, 1912, and addressed to Lord Errington, the following passages occur :— “We have no objection to any percentage of distribution or representation, of which Lord Revelstoke may approve, in so far as the interests of Great Britain, Russia, France, and ourselves are concerned in the Societe d’ Etudes. . . “ But we must be understood to reserve full freedom ot action when it comes to the actual construction and subsequent management and control of the lines which may be built. We shall expect if the scheme is to be carried out with our approval, to be consulted about the alignment, constitution of the board, representation of British interests, percentage of construction orders to be placed on the British market, and, in general outline, about freight and passenger rates. “Our obiect is not to raise difficulties, but to reserve our freedom of action in regard to such matters, and I need not say that, when the Societe d’Ltudes furnishes its ^ report, we shall take into full consideration any recommendations which you may lay before us. And in a further letter, addressed to Lord Bevelstoke on the 25th March, 1912 the following passage occurs :— “lam to add that, amongst the questions as to which His Majesty’s Government desire to retain their freedom of action with regard to this railway, should be included that of the gauge to be adopted.” In September of this year, during his visit to this country, the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs communicated a memorandum to Lord Reve s o e, pioposing e early dispatch to Tehran of delegates representing the bocnLe ( ut es &gt; an °p 23rd October Lord Revelstoke explained, during an interview wi ^ ir • the Marquess of Crewe, and Sir Arthur Nicolson, the points a is?&gt;ue. a 28th October a record of these explanations was furnished to the Foreign Office by Lord Revelstoke, and it contains the following passages : “The immediate question before the society was the obtaining ^'Jy^^^ith^t an Persian Government granting permission, in pneral terms, o survey^^ ^ b /included in the option to construct a line traversing Persian territory, the P j b tbe Governments alignment being left to future examination and decision afte pp 7 ^ concerned. This concession was to be asked for as a whole, u or ?

Grey w cam^id^ G~nt granting permission [2700 2 — 1 ] asin general terms, to survey, and carrying with it an option to construct a line traversing Persian territory; the actual points to be included m the alignment being left to futur e examination and decision after approval by the Governments concerned/' Moreover it was recognised that His Majesty’s Government reserved complete freedom of action in regard to construction outside the Russian sphere (that is, m the neutral and British spheres), and that such construction should not be undertaken until, i n ttuP view of His Majesty’s Government, it should be deemed politic and feasible. It would obviously have been impossible for Sir E. Grey, consistently with the reservations enumerated in the letters addressed to your society in March last, to have acquiesced in more far-reaching proposals at this_ stage; it had indeed been expressly intimated in this correspondence that His Majesty s Government could not commit themselves in regard to the execution ot the project until the report of the Socidtd d’Etudes—a body primarily formed for the purpose of study and investigation—had been submitted, and the object in view was that the conclusions arrived at in the report should be fully considered in their commercial, political, and strategical aspects by His Majesty’s Government. Sir E. Grey considers that it would be hardly possible for His Majesty’s Government to reserve that freedom of action which has always been stipulated for, pending con sideration of the report of your society, if they were now to afford you diplomatic support at Tehran in pressing the specitic proposals embodied in your letter of the 5th November. I am now to refer seriatim to the enclosures in your letter. Enclosure (A), the draft of a letter which it is proposed to present to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, sets forth under three headings the objects of the Society d’Etudes in sending delegates to Tehran; these are to secure :— 1. Permission to make the necessary investigations and preparations for the construction, on Persian territory, of a railway joining up the Russian and Indian frontiers, and for all extensions calculated to further the essential object of the line—that is to say, for the building of railways destined for passenger and goods traffic between the Russo-Persian frontier and the Indo-Persian frontier. 2. An option, in favour of the Societe d’l^tudes, for a concession for the above-mentioned lines. Such an option should also be assured to the societe for building branch lines which would be natural feeders of the main line, or which might, under foreign control, injuriously affect its traffic. 3. Finally, certain maritime facilities at the terminal points being necessary for working the lines, the societe would desire to secure its position in this respect also. His Majesty’s Government are willing, subject to the reservations contained in the Foreign Office letters of the 2nd and 25th March last, to support your delegates at Tehran in securing an option as originally proposed for a main line; they are willing to do so on the distinct understanding that the option is not to be exercised outside the Russian sphere, that is, in a region where British commercial and political interests predominate, until they deem it politic and feasible. As to the question of branches, His Majesty’s Government cannot support your delegates at this stage in negotiating even for an option outside the Russian sphere. When your report is completed they will consider carefully, and on their merits, such recommendations as may be put forward; but Sir E. Grey cannot conceal from you his view that a concession, such as is outlined in your letter, would confer upon your society a virtual monopoly of railway enterprise, and, having regard to the magnitude of British interests in Southern Persia, His Majesty’s Government cannot commit them selves, even provisionally, to the proposals now before them. While Sir E. Grey cannot but regard the question as somewhat premature, he recognises that, if railways are built in regions adjacent to those traversed by the liue you have in view, then means should be found for securing through traffic, destined to pass^ on to, or coming from, your system, against unfair manipulation on railways outside your direct control. His Majesty s Government are also unwilling to agree to the third proposal iu . °^ me (A)&gt; regarding terminal facilities on the Persian Gulf; Sir E. Grey was not, mdeed, aware that the Irans-Persian Railway—by which it was proposed to connect Russian and Indian territory—was projected to reach the Persian Gulf, or, indeed, that any terminus on those waters was contemplated. The matter is one of great po itical importance; and His Majesty’s Government cannot support your delegates m a negotiation w bich, should it now be pursued, would cause them grave concern. _ . Enclosure (B) contains an enumeration of branch lines—a subject to which it is unnecessary that I should refer in greater detail.Enclosure (C) is the draft of an agreement of which the declared object is to emphasise the preponderating rights of the British and Russian groups respectively in the British and Russian^spheres. While the wording of this draft does not appear to Sir E. Grey to be pviThd facis open to serious objection, it is not very clear, owing to the brevity of the document, what its scope or interpretation will be. His Majesty’s ^Government cannot therefore, in the absence of more precise information, express their concurrence in its terms, since to do so might conceivably imply acquiescence in differential treatment of British merchandise on branches in the Russian sphere. Thus an important artery of British trade will be the route via Bagdad and Khanikin into Persia; and it is essential that British imports should not be throttled by unfavourable treatment on the railway after passing the Turco-Persian frontier. This aspect of the question was emphasised in the Foreign Office letter, already quoted, of the 2nd March, 1912. I am to suggest, therefore, that there would be substantial advantage in postponing the conclusion of the agreement which forms Enclosure (C) until a later date. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET.PERSIA.

Wilson, C.M.G., and Mr. H. G. Chick, His Majesty’s vice-consul and commercial adviser to this residency, on the subject of contemplated or possible railway projects in South-West Persia. I have forwarded a copy of this despatch, with enclosures, to His Majesty’s Foreign Office. I have, &amp;c. P. Z.

Sir, Bushire, August 18, 1912.. I HAVE the honour to submit, for the consideration of the Government of India and of IIis Majesty’s Minister, the following able and interesting reports drawn up by officers attached to this residency and consulate-general, on the subject of contemplated or possible railway projects in Southern Persia. (1.) A report by Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, C.M.G., upon the possibility of connecting Bushire by railway with Shiraz via Aliabad, or via some other convenient point on a Bunder Abbas-Shiraz alignment. (2.) A report by the same officer upon the proposed Bunder Abbas—Shnaz project, and the merits of possible extensions thereof to— (a.) Mohammerah. (b.) Ispahan. (3.) A report by Mr. H. G. Chick, my vice-consul and commercial adviser, on the commercial possibilities of the above projects and a statement or ns ^iy w s, rom the economic standpoint, on the problem of railway possibilities genera ) wm m sphere in question. 2. I should explain that Lieutenant Wilsons report No. 1 represents the 1 ® s . of the reconnaissance undertaken by him in pursuance of the sane ion convey ^ [2619 i—1]Government of India communication marginally cited. •' Owing, however, to his b ' first of all deputed to Luristan—as the more pressing measure—in connection the projected Mohammerah-Khoremabad project, it was not until August 1911 he was able to undertake the Aliabad expedition, at the end of which he was detai H in Shiraz and Ispahan on duty in connection with the passage of the Central In ]• Horse to Ispahan, and was thus prevented from drawing up his reports imtil h reached Bushire in February. When they reached me, on my return from India th questions of these particular projects were not in lively issue with Governme f- I therefore delayed their dispatch until I could submit at the same time a parall 1 report which Mr. Chick was preparing on the commercial possibilities of railw 6 enterprise in these regions, based on investigations made by him during his own rec t travels on the trade routes and short sojourn at Shiraz. 3. The Government of India will have seen from the diaries which Lieutenant Wilson furnished during his absence, that, as was the case while he was in Luristan the anarchy which prevailed in the province of Ears during his deputation (and still prevails) made it impracticable for him to make as full an examination as could be desired of alternative alignments; such as, for example, the Bushire-Firuzabad-Shira route. This is the more regrettable as the intended examination of this route b Captan Hopkins, B.E., was not carried out.f Lieutenant Wilson was, however able to examine an alternative route (via Fasa) between Jahrum and Shiraz, and the reuorf drawn up by him on this alignment and on the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz line o-enerallv forms Enclosure No. 2 to this letter. ^ 4. The details which are furnished in Part 1 of the first report will, it is hoped enable railway experts to arrive at definite conclusions as to the practicability and probable cost of a railway along the particular alignment traversed by Lieutenant Wilson, which, for reasons explained by him, the latter regards as the only one which can, broadly speaking, be looked on as commercially practicable for a branch to Bushire from a Bunder Abbas-Shiraz line. Taking the distance along the alignment from Bushire to Jahrum at 250 miles, he estimates that the general cost per mile will work out to 5,1 GOL a mile, giving a total of 1,285,000Z. He gives reasons for his belief that an alignment via Firuzabad would present greater difficulties than the less direct and more southerly line recommended by him. It is of interest in this connection to note that Captain Hopkins has also formed an unfavourable impression of the Firuzabad route, j 5. In Part 2 of his first report Lieutenant Wilson submits his views with icgaid to the financial prospects of a Bushire-Jahrum branch. In formulatum them he assumes that it would not be constructed until after the completion of a line from Bunuer Abbas to Shiraz, and his conclusions based on that assumption are unfavourable^ On the other hand, he expresses the view that it is important to connect Us m e with Shiraz, and that any scheme of concessions for railways in Southern eisia s ion include the option to make the Bushire—Shiraz connection by some route 01 ^ i f 1 *’ an remai yS in this connection that he believes a rack railwav or monorail could be constructed along the present telegraph route. It will be noted that Captain op ms a so av ours the Kazerun route for a line to Shiraz on the primd facie evidence of maps and reports to which he had access. (Vide his letter of the 7th Lebruary, 1912, above quoted.) a - dealing with the above, is seen to be not only an enthusiastic rirfT ^ +1 ' e .u U f hir -~ ShiraZ c . onnec ti° n by one route or another, but goes so far as a um, Li • &gt;S /’ C . 1 ^ 13 -°^ C011s iderably more immediate importance than the Bunder . U1 aZ B 10 *F C ^ an d’ secondly, that a line over the Bushire-Kazerun route has f Qllr . n ^ r f S ^ C + f ° co . mme l' c i a l success than any other route to Shiraz from the Gulf, np rfil • r ° ,. e ’ s . e Mev ^ s be adduces exhaustive figures and arguments based on his cTZcS groS' 8 aild expeiiences ’ Which certai by make up I very good ease 8. In his second report Lieutenant Wilson deals with (a ) The Bunder Abbas-Shiraz project generally, r) Au P oss !f e extension of it to Mohammerah. e.) 1 he possible extension of it to Ispahan. (d.) the possible extension of it to Kerman. t S Welr t Lfir r S\ I)era . rtme ' 1 , t endorsement, dated February 8 , 1910. under Foreign Department lette^a^ Becembw 5 To'™” 1611 * ° f India ’ date&lt;1 November 1911 ’ reCe ' e^er ated Febmary /, 1912, to the Government of India in the Foreign Department on3 As regards (a )he has arrived at the conclusion that the best alignment to follow would be bunder Abbas Lar Jahrum, Kara Agach Valley, Shiraz, as being the most direct by at least - miles, besides being the cheapest and traversing the centre of the ^(jst fertile portion of .bars. Speaking generally, he considers that for many years to come there can hardly be sufficient traffic to make more than one line from the Gulf to Shiraz profitable 'and as regards the suggested Shiraz-Mohammerah and Shiraz-Bushire connections he holds that the former has no raison d'etre except it be a strategic one, while as regards the latter he agrees that a good many arguments can be adduced in its favour, but thinks that it must be regarded as both supplementary and secondary to the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz project of which he urges the obvious strategical value to the Persian Government. He strongly favours the extension from Shiraz to Ispahan, aa also does Mr. Chick, as a necessary corollary to the connection of Shiraz with the Gulf; but finds little to be said for an extension from Shiraz to Kerman. He considers, however, that a demand for an option for the construction of such a line should be made whenever concessions for lines in South-West Persia are asked for from the Persian Government. 9. In the foregoing paragraphs I have merely endeavoured to epitomise briefl 7 the general purport of the reports submitted; it would hardly be of any advantage at the present stage for me to embark upon any detailed comment on the figures and estimates furnished, and indeed I find it very difficult just now to formulate any precise views even on the major issues raised, owing to the fluid and uncertain state of the several primary factors involved. Thus, it is at present problematical— (a.) Whether or not the question of the Bagdud-Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway will be regulated in a w T ay satisfactory to us. (b.) Whether the Persian Railw r ay syndicate will obtain and act upon a concession for the construction of the Mohammerah-Khoremabad Railway. (c.) Whether the comprehensive application of the same syndicate for a series of other railway concessions will prove successful. (d.) Under what precise auspices and conditions the proposed Khanikin-Tehran connection will be made. (e.) Whether or not the Trans-Persian Railwmy project will ultimately receive the sanction of public and expert opinion, with the practical probability of realisation, and if so wffiat wbll be the precise alignment decided upon. 10. With regard to (6) and (c), it is evident from the terms ol the railway syndicate’s draft concession that if their efforts meet with success, a start will be made with the Mohammerah-Khoremabad line, so that in any case other projects in bars are unlikely to get beyond the option stage for some time to come. Before that, it is to be hoped that negotiations with Turkey regarding the Bussorah section^ of the Bagdad Railway, and other matters, will have reached a satisfactory conclusion and that we shall then have a clearer view ahead. In the meanwhile I am of opinion that the practical possibilities and alternatives for connecting Bushire with Shiraz cannot be considered disposed of by the repoits at present submitted, and that it will be worth while as soon as the state of the country admits of it that an expert investigation of the commercial possibilities and engineering aspects of alternative routes should be undertaken. At present no possibi ity o sue a ^ measure seems in the least likely. _ . . 11. There is only one other point which it seems advisable to ouci upon ere, namely, the crucial position occupied by Ispahan in reference to our sc ernes toi ia,i wa) enterprise in Southern Persia. , ^ , j i It will be noticed that both Lieutenant Wilson and Mr. . 110 . a '? ca connection with Ispahan from the Gulf, and from the economic \iew r ert ,, , be no doubt, I think, as to the advisability of it. Up to now * the case of Ispahan has been considered affected by the possi 11 y o ^ , Railway extending eastwards, and further, that in any case un i for the' Trans-Persian Kailway has been chosen no final decision res P ec * p S , be arrived at. Meanwhile it is clearly of urgent iinpor ance w arrived at. ivieanwnne it is luea-ny ^ — i. .

Sir, Bushire, February 10, 1919 I HAVE the honour to submit herewith a report upon the possibility of connect in cr Bushire by railway with Aliabad; or some convenient point on the Bunder AliUo 0 Shiraz alignment.

The Bushire—L)izgah—Jahrum Alignment. Primary object of my deputation was to examine and report on the possibility of effecting a connection by railway between Bushire and some point in the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz route, near Aliabad, but before going further into this question I should like to observe that, whereas in the correspondence leading up to my eputation, it seems to be assumed that a railway alignment between Jahrum and o iraz was to pass through Firuzabad, further investigation of the country has led me o cone ude that this would not be the case, but that a line would take a more direct route up the Kara Agach Valley, midway between Firuzabad and Faza. The question oes not, lowever, affect the scope of my report beyond explaining reasons for extending the scope of my report to include the stage between Aliabad and Jahrum. i of - a Venture su ^ m it my views on a suitable alignment between Bunder Abbas 1 ? ]laz 111 a separate report ad hoc. Before entering on a detailed description of is a ignment it is desirable to give reasons for the belief that it is necessary to go as ai sou as izgah in order to obtain a suitable trace between Bushire and Jahrum. • , i i meumstcinces prevented me from traversing the Bushire—Firuzabad road, but KlS 0ei1 i pquently traversed, and Lieutenant Cruikshank’s very careful surveys now incorporated mto the various sheets of the “ Survey of India,” and the detailed reports m our possession indicate, to my mind conclusively, that the undoubted difficuties to be nf , oun 011 ? Bushire-Firuzabad section would be such as to neutralise any saving •pi* J)? \ V 8 , mi S' 1 b be gained by the adoption of such an alignment.

This, in a few words, is the alignment described Section 1. Bushire (0) to Shanbeh (600 feet), 75 miles (via Gurak, Khurmufand Sam). Mashileh ^ ''ould follow the contour of the island, crossing a® ivlashueh on a line parallel to the telegraph wires ; this is a strip of land 7 miles broadT r dividing Bushire from the mainland; it is liable to inundation from tK„ „ , • generally boggy m parts, though always passable by pack •miiink Ti* -f®’ n^- 1 ? fnd very salt. A G-feet embankment would be necesLrv r 801 18 ? ,luvlal r^faced with pitched stone at the foot, obtainable from Bushire. 'S MaSSeHs left near Gurak, and from this point onwards the line runs over flat alluvi' l nl • j would be little more than a surface line, with occasional brick culverts or smalTbrick bridges across water courses. 1 sma11 brick . d/etaHibrg.—Limestone available from boulders at Darwishi and from Kuh Bairami, neai Khuimuj. Bushire stone and local sandstone are too friable for the purpose. Labour. —Plentiful all the year round. Water. —-Anywhere from wells. The Mund River is brackish. This section may be classed as follows:— Surface line Easy valley line (Mashileh) Total £ 70 miles, at 3,000 5 . „ „ 4,000 75 ,. .. £ 210,000 20,000 230,000 Section 2. Shanbeli (000 feet) to Pas Hudak (850 feet), distance along alignment 50 miles. 4. This is the first of the three hilly sections of the route. For the first 6 miles till due north of Darwishi, the line runs at the foot of the hills to the north of the plain. It then enters confused low hills of gypsum and sandstone, which run parallel to the strike of the hills, i.e., east-south-east or east by south. The best alignment would, I should say, keep to the foot of the sandstone outliers of the Kuh-i-Kartang, just where the gypsum underlying them crops out. Heavy cutting and embanking would be necessary in many places, but the gradient would be very easy. This continues to 14 miles, where the Ab-i-Nilu has to be crossed ; it runs in a ravine 50 feet deep and 200 yards broad ; the ground now gets a good deal worse; the usual track keeps to the north of a prominent hill a mile north of Ab-i-Nilu, and crosses a succession of difficult ravines, finally rising to a height of 1,200 feet at 24 miles, after which it drops sharply by 350 feet to the Ab-i-Bunbid, a fresh-water stream, in a ravine 30 feet deep and 150 yards wide, reached at 32 miles. An alignment along this track would be difficult and expensive, and 1 should say that a much easier alignment could be obtained 2 miles to the south, crossing the Ab-i-Bunbid at almost the same place, where the ridge which separates the two alternative alignments ends. The Mund River takes an irregular course amongst steep and precipitous hills, and cannot conveniently be followed. The ground now improves considerably; the alignment which I suggest follows the usual track to Guli Darwaseh (34 miles), the only breach for several miles, in a long precipitous ridge running parallel to the river and to Kuh-i-Kartang ; through the breach in a bed 50 feet deep and 100 yards broad runs a stream, dry in summer, which must be bridged. At 36 miles the Mund River is struck, flowing in a bed 100 feet deep and 400 yards wide, and winding from one side of the valley to the other. It is unnecessary to cross it, however. An alignment can now be secured right up the Pas Rudak Plain, crossing the Shurab River at 40 miles. This stream, which is brackish, is fordable only for six months or so in the year ; in flood it fills its bed completely to a depth of some 30 feet, with a breadth of 200 yards. The plain is some 15 miles long and 6 miles broad, and consists of flat river terraces, well cultivated in places, irrigated from the i un i\ei, Which is fresh above its junction with the Shurab. It is little cultivated at present hot, if developed, could become a very valuable property. It is the iu ( e /.° Soulet-ed-Dowleh. It continues beyond Pas Rudak past Bairusti and Gabn to a point some miles beyond Imamz, Shah Sowar (or Sowar-i-Ghaib), where the Mund Xivei issues from the hills. [2619 i—l]I classify this section as follows :— Surface line .. .» 15 miles, at £ 3,000 £ 45,000 Easy valley line .. 10 4,000 40,000 Heavy valley line 10 5? » 0,000 60,000 Difficult.. 15 55 8,000 120,000 Add for previous section .. 50 265,000 75 - • • 230,000 Running total miles a . 125 &gt;&gt; • • • • 495,000 5. From Pas Kudak onwards two alignments suggest themselves one Mund River gorge, the other following the line of least resistance up a trihiUn^ 1 ?? ^ to Kurdeh, Garmusht, and Pidu. 1 } streani Without a careful survey of both these alignments it cannot be stated defi &gt; i which of them offers the least difficulty. lte *| The gorge by which the Mund River obtains access to the Pas Rudak Pl a i ' tortuous and impassable even on foot for several miles immediately east of Sow ' S Ghaib, but it seems not improbable that a couple of tunnels, each 800 yards or so Iq 1 * and a few miles of expensive gorge line, would suffice to give the line access to tT broad valley beyond which this gorge once negotiated offers no serious difficnltv 6 railway line as far as the Kir-o-Karzin Plain. ^ a The alignment up the Haftawan stream to Kurdeh, Garmusht, and Pidu has no such obstacle to overcome at the start, but the Pidu—Gird Bisheh section across the Kuh Pahan range (which the alignment suggested above avoids) is difficult, thouo-h in no way impracticable, but it does not appear to me any longer than the former alignment; and as it is likely to be somewhat cheaper it is therefore described Section 3.—Pas Rudak (850 feet) to Pidu (1,200 feet), 40 miles. 6. This is an easy section over the Pas Rudak (Duzdgah) Plain for 3 miles, crossing occasional ravines and descending easily from terrace to terrace.

For the first 2 miles, as tar as the Abhal date grove, the line runs over the Pidu Plain - it then turns north-east and then east again over the Maidanak plateau, parallel to the’strike of the hills, to 5 miles. Then begin the hills. To suggest any particular alignment would he impossible without a detailed survey. The range, which is about 6 miles in breadth, is narrower at this point than anywhere else, and also lower. It consists of a succession'of sandstone and gravel ridges, parallel to each other, consisting of a strata tilted north wards at an upward angle of about 20 degrees; the cross section of the rano- e resembles the edge of a saw.^ The ridges gradually increase in height towards the north, attaining a maximum height in the vicinity of the alignment of some 1,900 feet. They are pierced by numerous winding ravines running south to the Pidu Plain; the watershed, north of which the hills drain to the Mund, is not reached till 3 miles south of fxird Bisheh, the point where it is surmounted by the mule track is known as the Tm kan Pass (1,650 feet). If the last and highest ridge crossed by this path be pierced, a tunnel about half-a-mile long and other smaller ridges either cut through or pierced by tunnels of 300 or 400 yards, the line need not rise above 1,500 feet, and there should be no difficulty in obtaining a gradient of 1 in 100.

We now follow the Mund Valley for nearly 50 miles. The best alignment from Gird Bisheh seems to keep for some miles on the south (left) bunk at a distance of 1 or 2 miles from the river, eventually crossing the river at 1,400 feet, traversing the Karakash Plain, and heading directly for the Tang-i-Shahriyari (1,500 feet), reached at 9 miles. This stretch offers no special difficulties; the Mund is hereabout 40 yards broad, 1 ft. 6 in. deep in summer, flowing in a bed some 20 feet deep. There will be a good deal of rock cutting and embanking, as the valley and plain are undulating, and intersected by low but narrow rocky ridges; no difficulty should be experienced in obtaining a gradient of 1-150 to 1-200. The Karakash Plain is not cultivated, but is capable of irrigation, and could support a large population. 9. At 9 miles we reach to the Tang-i-Shahriyari, a winding gorge 9 miles long, the last 4 mdes being practically straight; there should be no serious difficulty in carrying the line through it, as the sides, particularly the northern, or right, bank, is not precipitous. A 400 or 500 yards tunnel will be required just before Sulleh (14 miles) to pierce a limestone spur round which the river runs, and which it would be incon\ement to surmount or circumvent. On reaching the date grove of Ab-bad (18 miles) tie gorge ends, and the Laghar Plain lies before us. , . , 10. Following the general trend of the river, the alignment, a.ter crossing the right bank, trends northwards, leaving Chah Kazimha and Makku (1&gt;69 ^6 ) 011 e left bank, and passes close to the village of Laghar, reached at 20 mi es , i ^ mn ^ unis west again, following the river and crossing it probably at some pom near aim (1,700 feet . Over 'the plain the going is very easy indeed ; from Laghar to Makku a certain amount of rock cutting would be necessary as the g roimd ,! s cut up by ravines, but no special difficuty presents itself and t ic £ ia(tu11 ^ X1 f gentle. Three miles east of Ab Garm on the left bank stands the v.Uage of Kudi if the river be crossed at Laghar, a fairly easy alignment to the Afzar Plain pass ..8 through Kirdi, at 31 miles; it would then turn north and finally north-east, folio / up-stream and passing through an easy gorge at 36 miles enters on to the soutl 1 ^ extremity of the Kir-o-Karzin Plain. ^ It now runs nearly due north to Kalat northernmost of three villages of Kalat, Khumar, and Hasamabad, at 4o ’ ‘i 6 (1,900 feet). It may be found convenient to cross and re-cross the river near ]?] f to avoid heavy rock cutting, otherwise the gradient is very easy and no difficult' calling for special notice present themselves.

At this point we must leave the Mund Valley and make for Jahrum. I had hoped to find an alignment up the Mund from the Kir-o-Karzin Plain and to follow its Fasa tributary till near Jahrum, but on examining the Tang-i-Karzin, whereby the Mund River obtains access to the plain from the north, I found that this idea must be abandoned as the gorge is only passable for 4 miles, after which it is impassable even on foot. The country to the north of the Kir-o-Karzin Plain is, moreover, desolate and hilly, and offers no facilities for a railway alignment. I went up the gorge as far as Madkhun, 15 miles north of the plain, passing through the gorge and over a sudsidiary pass, and then retracing my steps to the plain, and camped at Ahabad, which vvas mentioned by the political resident in the Persian Gulf when the question of tins line was first mooted as a point which a Bushire—Jahrum line would piobably touch. Between the plain and Jahrum lies a mountain range which we cannot turn; it is crossed at the N’al Shikan Pass, its lowest point, at 3,700 feet, riom the plain to Mubarakabad (2,050 feet) is 10 miles over a practically flat plain, but even when this village is reached the Kaseh Tul and N al Shikan ranges still ave to be crossed at right angles, instead of in echelon, as can be done from Aliabad tei. tl careful survey of various alternatives, 1 came to the conclusion that the only piacticable alignment involved a tunnel through the narrow range which bounds the 1 ai ^ 1 T 1 , 1 the east; this gives us access to a broad valley sloping gently upwards the JS al fehikan Pass.

Part II.— Geneval and Financial Conditions. 15. In considering the Bushire-Jahrum connection from a financial pomt^of^iew, t is necessary to look upon it as part of a line connecting n* report and fhe general questions of railways in Fars is touched on m ^ ^o meTo control ! will only attempt here to state briefly the chief factors which appear to me to he financial prospects of the projected connection. , , . imports Exports from the whole of Persia work out at an average P nto Persia at about 18a. a-head. The Brit.sh Empire sends imports to the 1,000,0001. to Persia, and receives only about 650,0001. woit P. ’ in Fare Russia takes 1,000,0001. worth more of exports than of im P , , . an( j until this would benefit British trade primarily bjr stimulating ' ee ^l l Aoanmmsr that the line happens we cannot hope substantially fc&gt; increase our impor . „ Bunder Abbas, 4nder discussion will be constructed after the comp e ion ^ railways in Fars to ad after sufficient experience has been gamed of the working of railway ^ [2619 i—1]10 assure those concerned that a Bushire connection would not react unfavourably on th main line, it remains to ascertain what fresh markets would be tapped by such a line 16. The sedentary population that would be served by a Bushire-Shiraz lin^ i s estimated at 232,000, of which 184,000 would also be served by a Bunder Abbas- Shiraz line. (I take the country for about 50 miles on either side as the most that line of railway could effectively serve.) the remaining 48,000 inhabit the followino- districts which a Bushire connection might be expected to tap :— Abram (town) Arba’eh .. Dashti Dizgah Farrashband Tangistan.. 1,500 12,500 20,000 2,000 2.000 10,000 (Say, 10,000 families.) 48,000 The nomadic population would probably continue to draw their supplies principally from Shiraz itself, and send their wool, &amp;c., there for sale. I am, therefore, leaving them out of account as far as this line is concerned. It will be seen that the line taps a very small additional population. This is because it passes through the least populous parts of Ears, where the climatic conditions make any very considerable increase of exports improbable. In the most fertile districts (Dashti and Tangistan) the sea-borne traffic would be in competition with the railway, with what result it is hard to say. As much as 3 tons of grain per family might be available for export in a good year, giving a total of 30,000 tons; but two-thirds of this is grown within 25 miles of a seaport, and cannot be considered as a new source of supply. It should be borne in mind, too, that the greatest quantity of grain ever yet exported from Bushire and dependent ports is only 22,000 tons, and that the average annual export in a good year does not exceed 10,000 tons. In addition to grain, the principal exports from the districts mentioned above would be wood, charcoal, dairy produce, dates, dried fruits, opium, gum, and tobacco. These might total in the aggregate 2,000 tons. Import Traffic. 17. Once Bunder Abbas has been connected by railway with Shiraz and trade directed to that line, I find it difficult to believe that any large proportion of the import trade would revert to Bushire as a result of the construction of the proposed branch line, vvlnch feeds no markets of note en route. Of the 20,000 tons now imported at Bushire the branch line could not be expected to secure more than 2,000 tons. Passenger Traffic. 18. ^ This factor is very difficult to estimate; it would be largely seasonal in connection with the annual pilgrimages to Kerbela and Mecca, but the population of ersia is so small that, beyond this, no large movement by rail is to be expected. Mineral Traffic. 19. I have submitted as an appendix to my report on the proposed Bunder Abbas me a s a emen giv mg details of such mineral deposits as are reported to exist in Ears: i ls su cien o no e here that though the tract has not been geologically examined, of^ep^c n ° 1 ^ aS ° n ^mk that any important deposits exist in the vicinity Gradient. he 1 in' l P r . ac ^ ca bl e ruling gradient on the Bushire-Shiraz line to 1 wi ™ * i “ Supply of Labour. shouldbJa'va^ class of fairly cheap labour11 ] i oh able Hostility of Nomad Tvibes. 23. The laying of the line would have to be effected from railhead, there being no point en route to which material could be conveyed otherwise. The preparation of the track, however, could be prosecuted energetically from either end, and possibly from some intermediate point also. On the whole, I think that we may take six to eight years as the shortest probable period necessary tor the construction of this alignment! 24. If it is found possible to work commercially the early sections of a line before the whole is opened to traffic, a sensible reduction can be effected in the heavy charges that will otherwise be incurred for interest on capital expended. This can be done on the Bushire-Dizgah section (100 miles), which, when opened to traffic, should bring in an'appreciable revenue, and accustom the tribes to the idea of a railway before it actually comes near them, a point of some importance. By this section, there should be from the first a considerable volume of exports, e.g., wheat, barley, wood, dates, fire wood, &amp;c., but very few imports. On the whole, the examination of the project, which I have carried out, brings me to the conclusion that its commercial potentialities are not sufficiently great to justify the construction of a Bushire-Jahrum connection as well as of a Bunder Abbas-Jahrum connection, and if we accept the premise that from all points our general interests require that preference should be given to the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz project, the Bushire- Jahrum connection must remain in abeyance until the experience gained in the construc tion and working of the Bunder Abbas line has indicated more precisely the general prospects of railway construction in Fars. At the same time, the geographical position of Bushire makes it certain that, as the market town of a large area, whose population is estimated at not less than 150,000, 0 it will always retain a certain importance. In this connection, it would be well not to attach undue importance to the disadvantages Bushire is supposed to possess from the point of view of harbour accommodation. If the proposed connection is con structed, the amount of traffic which it would attract is not likely to exceed 50,000 tons, which could be handled without difficulty by existing methods and progressive adaptations thereof. Whether this present project takes shape or not, Bushire must still remain one of the three chief Persian ports of the Gulf and the head-quarters of the governor of the Gulf ports, and, in consequence, of the chief representatives of foreign Powers in Southern Persia and the Gulf. It is also the most central port in the neutral zor f e under the Anglo-Bussian convention, and this fact makes it, one the one hand, * Made up as follows •.— Utilisation of the First Sections of the Line for Traffic.

The population of Fars is estimated at about Imports.

The exports from Bushire and subordinate ports for 1909-10 aggregated 6,201 tons, Lingah accounted for another 3,096 tons, giving a total of 9,297 tons for the whole of Pars ; their aggregate value may be taken at rather less than 500,000/. But this figure in no way repYesents the probable export traffic that would be handled by a railway from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz ; the production of cereals, tobacco, gum, charcoal, wool, and fruit would be greatly stimulated, and it is upon the trans portation of such commodities that the railway would have to rely for the bulk of its revenue. Population served by Line. 5. The principal factor in the production of cereals is population, and, from the point of view of railway traffic, the population served by (i.e., within 50 miles of) the line from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz (excluding coastal districts), I estimated at 255,000, resident in the districts and towns shown in the margin ;* of this total about 220,000 live on the sardsir, or plateau (140,000 within 50 miles of Shiraz), the remainder in the garmsir (low country, say below 3,000 feet). The sardsir districts are more fertile and better watered, and less liable to drought than the garmsir. This gives us a total of about 50,000 families within 50 miles of the line; taking 2 tons a family as the normal surplus of grain available for export (for reasons explained belowf), the normal grain surplus may be calculated at 100,000 tons.

Bunder Abbas is very well plac^ 688 distributing centre, and as a port for shipping grain, &amp;c., to Europe. C a8a Local Goods Traffic (i.e., not destined for Export by Sea). 6. It seems unlikely that railways in Fars will develop any laro- e local t ffi the province is fairly homogeneous as regards products and climatic variationr ^ there are no large towns en route. The traffic would be mainly between Shira 5 A Bunder Abbas; fruit would, no doubt, be largely sent down to the coast wh Z ^ would be distributed to the Arab ports, &amp;c. Wood and charcoal would also fTd^ ready market in the Gulf; skins, dairy produce, dates, and dried fruits would also h! sent down to the sea for sale locally as well as for export, in addition to such imuorta f commodities as opium, gum, tobacco, almonds, rosewater, &amp;c. Rice, wheat, and ba 1 would also come down whenever the prices current at Bunder Abbas permitted T and I see no difficulty in anticipating 10,000 tons local traffic almost from the first ^ i usseny 7. Passenger traffic is more difficult to estimate; it would be largely seasonal in connection with the pilgrimages to Kerbela and Mecca, but the population of Southern Persia is so small that no large movement by rail is to be expected, and the conditions of life at Bunder Abbas are also unfavourable to this. No profit is, therefore, to be expected from this class of traffic. Bunder Abbas is less well placed than Bushire for pi grim traffic to Kerbela, though, no doubt, many passengers would use the line.

The population of Fars is so small that it is unlikely that sufficient traffic will exist for many years to make more than one line from the Gulf to Shiraz profitable as a commercial speculation; the projects which, if they took shape, would compete with a Bunder Abbas-Shiraz railway are (1) a Bnshire-Jahrum connection; (2) a Mohammerah (or Khor Musa) Rehbehan-Shiraz railway. I have already submitted a separate report regarding the former, and in Part III of this report I have endeavoured to fucus such information as is available regarding the latter project, the value of which would appear to be purely strategical. It is, however, important to secure an option for it in order to block, if necessary, the possible extension of the Bagdad Railway in this connection. Shiraz-1 spahan Line. 1-2. Two other projects for railways in Fars are ancillary to a Bunder Abbas-Shiraz line : they are ( 1) a Shiraz-Ispahan line ; (2) a Shiraz-Kerman line. Without the former, the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz line cannot attain its full develop ment, as pointed out in paragraph 9, and it seems of great importance to us to obtain an option for its construction immediately the line to Shiraz is completed. Such information as is available in regard to it is given in Part III of this report. Shiraz-Kerman Line. 13. The Shiraz-Kerman project has little to recommend it, except as the extension eastwards of a Mohammerah-Shiraz line, but it seems desirable, to secure an option for its construction as there seems a possibility that it will tap important copper and lead mines which are at present quite inaccessible. These are situated at Sar-i-Dasht, latitude 29° 30', longitude 55° 5', on route 22, between Shiraz and Kerman, 141 miles from the latter (see Appendix (III) ). (A recommendation to this effect was made by the political resident in the Persian Gulf in his telegram of the 20th December, 1910, to the Government of India.) Security of a Bunder Abbas Line against interference by Tribes, £c. 14. The Bunder Abbas-Shiraz line passes through almost desert country, mostly waterless, to within a few miles of Lar, a distance of 125 miles, and would only be subject to raids from the Baharlu (Khamseh) on the last 25 miles of this section. In Lar itself no great difficulty need be apprehended, and the town would be a useful centre from which action could be taken for the repression of disorders. I rom Lar to Jahrum the country is frequented but little by nomads, though subject to raids from them. There is a sparse sedentary populution in villages along the line, and the tribes have, I believe, no claim to ownership of any part of the lands traversed, whose actual owners would undoubtedly welcome the line. From Jahrum to Shiraz the line passes through closely populated fertile country, owned principally by the Kawami family or by Shiraz notables, who would there is no doubt, hail with delight the project of a railway through their lands, and the increased security and profit which it could not fail to bring. These lands are not frequented to any extent by nomad tribes, though they are, of course, subject to raids. Gradient. 15. I estimate the best practicable 1 in 100, compared with 1 in 40 on a With regard to gradient are only likely rulino- gradient on a Bunder Abbas-Shiraz line at Mohammerah-Shiraz line.* Serious difficulties to be found between Lar and Jahrum. * Vide Lieutenant Hopkins’s report, Appendix I of this report.Supply of Labour. 16 There should be no difficulty on this score at any time of year ; and good labour i^ likely to be available in any quantity ; water and food supply would be a matter some difficulty requiring forethought and careful arrangements between Bunder Abbas and Lar. fnv Hnnstruction. ' The laying of the line would have to he effected fiom railhead , the prepara tion of the track, however, could be prosecuted energetically from either end, and possibly from some point at midway also. Delays inseparable from work of any kind in Persia would be certain to hamper construction, and 1 think wc may take six or eight years as the shortest probable period necessary for the line. Utilisation of First Sections of Line for Traffic. 11. The Bunder Abbas-Lar and Bunder Abbas-Jahrum sections as soon as completed and opened for traffic would bring in an appreciable revenue and accustom the tribes to the idea of a railway before it actually comes near their territories, a point of some importance. Telegraphic Communication. 19. Bunder Abbas is connected by cable with Bushire and India, as well as with Muscat, and a land line would no doubt be brought down from Shiraz along the railway when finished. The construction of a land line from Bunder Abbas to Task, desirable in itself on other grounds, would complete an alternative land line between Tehran and India. Climate. 20. There is reason to believe that Bunder Abbas has acquired its unenviable reputation largely on account of the wretched accommodation which was at first available for Europeans ; the health of the incumbent of the British consulate there has greatly improved since the completion of the new building (vide Appendix II). The question of water supply would require careful examination, and it seems probable that a condenser would have to be installed to provide drinking and boiler water. Strategical Value of Line. 21. No instrument more effective for the control of the nomad tribes of Ears than a Bunder Abbas-Shiraz railway can be devised; it does not touch Kashgai territory at any point, but it would enable us rapidly and unexpectedly to transport troops to Shiraz and interpose a large force between the winter and summer quarters of the Kashgai, the ^ surest means of rapidly bringing them to their senses. It scarcely touches the territory of the Khamseh, but would make it easy to attack them, as their lands are generally within 50 miles of the proposed alignment. Cost: Bunder Abbas—Shiraz. 22. As will be seen from the summary at the end of Part II of this report, the estimated cost of a Bunder Abbas-Shiraz line at metre gauge, with a modest supply of rolling-stock, See., and suitable terminal arrangements, is about 2,000,00GL I will not attempt to estimate what the earnings of the railway must be to pay the charges on this sum, but T think I am justified, from my summary of traffic prospects as above, in believing that the receipts after the first few years will amply suffice for the purposes. In fact, the prospective traffic is likely to attain such oroportions that it is desirable that the Persian railways syndicate should include, in any further draft proposals they may make to the Persian Government, a clause authorising them to construct the line on a gauge as large as 4 ft. 8J in. This gauge, it might be noted, is not that of the Russian or Indian railway systems, but is that adopted for the Bagdad Railway, and seems likely to be the most suitable for general adoption in Persia.17 Part II. Bunder Abbas—Shiraz Alignment. 0 (See Degree Sheets 1 8 M and 18 I and S.W. Asia, 4 miles = 1 inch, sheet 88 S.E.) Section 1.— Bunder Abbas to the Ab-i-Shur (20 feet), 31 miles. 23. Leaving the town, the alignment runs over barren open ground past the date groves of Saru at 3 miles and Tuj at 4^- mdes to that of Gulistan at 7-|-miles; several water-courses are crossed. At 9 miles it passes ruined serai and cistern of Band-i-’Ali, half a mile north of sea coast. The ground now becomes more difficult over rocky ridges which continue for 2 miles; at 12 miles date groves of Khaneh Surkh; then over a level plain for half a mile. At 12^- miles to 14f miles the line traverses a number of small rocky defiles between parallel ridges ; at 15 miles serai of Chistaneh ; at 16 miles Tang-i-Chakabak commences, a low rough pass 2 miles long over long slopes of rock; some difficulty would be encountered here, and a detour would have to be made in order to give the alifrnment a gradient 1 in 100. At 19 miles emerge from pass and enter a maze of low hillocks ; at 23 miles this gives place to a sandy plain ; Gachin is passed at 26 miles, the ground continues fairly level to the Ab-i-Shur, reached at 29 miles, the village of Latidan being passed at 30 miles. Water. —Scarce, except from tanks ; good wells at Latidan and Gachin. Metalling. —Not available on this stretch, but can be obtained from section 2.

The Ab-i-Shur is about 80 yards broad in bed about 15 feet deep. Water about 6 inches deep in summer—2|- feet in spring and 8 or 10 feet in flood, if not more. The bed is sandy and treacherous and the river has recently changed its couise. 2 miles date groves and cisterns of Barimi. At 3 miles serai and cisterns o angm. At 5 miles cistern of Birkeh Daraz. At 5|- miles the ground, hitherto leve &gt;f ls ® s ) about 15 feet. At 9 miles alignment crosses water-course 80 yards broad, 10 leet deep, no water flows except in flood time; but could always be obtained by iggmo. At 1U miles serai of Kuristan (35 feet), two cisterns and good wells, bo far the ground has' been almost level, offering no difficulty to railway construction, but ha ole to inundation in places by hill torrents from south. At 16 miles Birkeh Sultan (100 feet) serai and cisterns From ^ ml les on a the line traverses many stony ravines. At 22 miles serai an ar »?J? ls f rn - i • a (425 feet).

For the first 8 miles the alignment passes over stony but almost level ground intersected by water-courses; after passing through foot-lulls at 8| miles, the Rud-i- Shur is crossed, and at 9 miles the mouth of the Dalan gorge is reached. Abundant fresh water from a kanat; supplies scanty from Dalan village. The gorge itself would present considerable obstacle to a railway alignment: it is 3-| miles long, the north end known as Sartang being reached at 12^ miles. Excellent water available. There seems no way to avoid traversing this gorge, nor the Tang-i-Shak beyond it, unless the line be taken south past the village of Dalan and then through the range south of the Hajamal valley by a tunnel. I think there can be no doubt that the line must go through the gorge. The breadth of the Tang is from 80 to 100 yards ; it winds sharply and the curvature of a line would be difficult unless the spurs were pierced by short tunnels. The Tang-i-Shak, the north end of which is reached at about 14 miles, is 1 mile long and 200 yards broad, and offers fewer difficulties to a railway than the Tang-i- Dalan. The track passes over rough ground amongst low hillocks. At 19 miles it crosses the Dehrahi Plain, a mile broad. At 30 miles over numerous watercourses. At 24 miles the Hurmuz Plain is reached, and at 27 miles the village of the same name. It may be mentioned that an alignment, which I should judge from road reports to be practicable, diverges here direct to Darab and Fasa, and also a road to Yazd.

This section is likely to be the most difficult between Bunder Abbas and Shiraz, and I have not sufficiently accurate notes of this portion to enable me to offer any definite suggestion as to how it can best be traversed. There is first a sharp rise of about 100 feet to the Pusht-i-Sangar plateau, and shortly afterwards a drop into a ravine running west from the slopes of Kuh-i-Kurdah. I am inclined to think that it would be practicable to strike this water-course near Lar and follow it up to Karmuni, which would be reached at about 7 miles. The main track crosses a narrow steep ridge to the north by a steep and difficult pass; a railway would, I think, have to obtain entrance to the Kurdah Plain (3,500 feet) by a tunnel about a mile long, reaching the northern side of the ridge at about 8 miles. From this point to Biris, reached at 24 miles, the ground is practically level. Dab Kuh is passed at 13 miles. Water from cisterns only. The next 6 miles are difficult and I can make no definite suggestions as to an alignment; the main road crosses a series of ridges keeping south of Biris water course, which runs amongst low hills to the north. I am inclined to think that an alignment might be found along or near its bed ; it would, no doubt, be expensive to built; but would have an easy gradient. At 30 miles the line would emerge on to the Deh Bah Plain, and from this point to Banaru reached at 40 miles a practically level alignment over a stony plain can be obtained.

The Government of India’s Committee advocated that a concession for this line should be obtaindd ; the Government of India, however, did not endorse this proposal, and recommended that no mention of such a line should be made at present.'' J hey considered that if the trans-Persian line passed through Ispahan such an alignment could be favourable to Russia; if, however, Ispahan was avoided, as proposed, by the Russian Go\ ernment (in order to prevent eventual intersection by a German line from Badgad), such a line would be of advantage. conc ^ us ^ OG of the Russo-German agreement and the undertaking of the Russian Government not to support the requests of third parties for concession in that region, nor consent to such requests being made without previous consultation with His Majesty s Government makes it probable that the Russian Government will withdraw t eir objections to the trans-Persian line passing through Ispahan, t . . question of the advantage to Russia of a Shiraz-Ispahan line, under such circumstances I venture to think that the line will be even more advantageous to the commerce of Great Britain and that no fears on this score need deter us from advocating its construction. t AmhTSnr f q/p di ; 1 t0 , Sec [ eta O n of state, No. 18, Secret, of the 23rd February, 1911. f Amba^ador, St. 1 etersburgh, to Foreign Office, No. 33, dated the 6th February, 1911.21 31. i|n( () ^ t 1 ® formidable physical difficulties' it wnnlrl -n k ii r n fairly closely the present cartload alignment, hut would'leave the sCz pfaininl north-west direction reaching Marvdasht via Baiza, and avoid th'e K„t^; n v i, „ detour to the north-west entering Ispahan via Yazdabad Ind DasWd Bstn '•could be about 300 miles and it would tap well-populated and fertile' cHstrlts dl'ordh o a large export and cons.derable local traffic. Were it to be constructed immediate y of the completion of a Bunder Abbas-Shiraz railway, the traffic would probably justify the adoption for both lines of the 4 ft. 84 m. instead of metre £au£e ‘ J 7 3-&gt;. The capabilities of the Ispahan market, both for exports and imports, are very great, and the possibility of its being the capital of Persia before many years have soil by cannot be excluded, there seems no adequate reason why we should be deterred by the Anglo-Kussian convention of 1907 from constructing a line to Ispahan If the Russian Government cannot be brought to consent to the line being brought into the city it might terminate at Julfa, or, failing that, at Kumisheh, 30 miles south of the city. 33. The Ahwaz-Ispahan route being quite out of the question for a railway or cart road, owing to prohibitive physical difficulties, it is only by connection with Gulf- Shiraz, or a Mohammerah-Khoremabad-Hamadan railway, 'that Ispahan can be reached from the south, and of these alternatives the former is plainly the more practic able.Unless and until one of these lines is built the Ahwaz-Ispahan road is not likely to lose any of its importance. ^ From Ahwaz to Ispahan is 270 miles ; from Hamadan, 270 miles; from Shiraz, 300 miles. After seeing each of the four main trade routes of South-West Persia during the past eight months I feel sure that theBakhtiari road, if the problems of supplies and accommodation are systematically .attacked, would enable us to land goods at Ispahan via Ahwaz cheaper than we could land them there with the aid of a Bunder Abbas or Bushire-Shiraz railway or a Mohammerah-Hamadan railway. In any case, alone of the main trade routes of South-West Persia it has little to fear from the completion of railways for many years to come. Part IV. — Arabistan-Behbehan-Shiraz. 34. A connection can be effected between Arabistan and Shiraz via Behbehan, either direct from Mohammerah or from Ahwaz, which would presumably have already connected by rail with Mohammerah. Both alignments are briefly described below. That via Ahwaz is much the cheapest (assuming the Mohammerah-Ah waz connection— 75 miles—to exist already), and preferable from every other point of view. The Mohammerah-Ah waz section is described in detail in my report on the Mohammerah-Khoremabad project. Ahwaz-Behbehan. 35. This line may be considered in two sections meeting at Bamuz.f From Ahwaz to Ramuz is about 60 miles, dead fiat country, the middle 10 miles being very marshy in winter but passable by a railway. Ramuz+ is a flourishing town, 1,000 (?) houses, with a population of 3,000 and market of a considerable part of the Bakhtiaii and Kuhgelu Hills ; there is even now a regular export from the district of wheat, barley, linseed, &amp;c., which a railway would greatly stimulate. The population of the district is given as 12,000 souls. i n i i From Bamuz to Behbehan is about 60 miles,§ over easy ground, practically level for the most part. || From Jaizun to within 6 miles of Kurreh bia i t ie coun ly traversed is broken, mud and sandhills being crossed for 8| miles, after wuc ere 18 a steady but not excessive descent to the Marun River. The hills are low and offer no serious difficulty to a railway a ignmen , a T 1 would possibly prove practicable to follow the line of the Marun Rivei rom neai to Behbehan. The Marun or Kurdistan River is 80 yards broad, fl° win g ^ a ^ 16 feet deep, the breadth of the bed being about 200 yards. Behbehan is a dilapidated * Vide Major Morton's report, proclamation of Government of India in the Foreign Department for 1 mile = 1 inch sheets and LB. 1910, and M, G. B.

Mohammerah (or Khor Musa) to Behbehan Alignment. • 36. From Mohammerah the line would have to cross at 4 or 5 miles either th Kanin or the Bahmanshir by a high level bridge to avoid interference with traffic - this would be difficult and costly. Both rivers are from 25 to 30 feet deep and 150 yards or so broad near Mohammerah. It would then have to traverse some 35 miles of desert to Fallahieh, of which 10 are permanently and 15 occasionally under 1 to 3 f ee t of water, and the whole in winter and spring is soft and yielding. At lallahieh a maze of irrigation channels must be crossed, and then some 35 miles desert, of which 15 are always marshy, till the Jarrahi is crossed, some 50 yards broad in a bed 30 feet deep in alluvial soil and liable to cut its banks suddenly. The next 30 miles are flat till the Hindian (Marun) River is first touched near Gargari. The remaining 45 are not particularly difficult; the line would probably follow the Khairabad stream to Behbehan, reached at about 150 miles. It was desired to run a line from Khor Musa to Fallahieh, a distance of some 15 miles ; it would have to be taken entirely through heavy marsh, flooded in winter to a depth of several feet. Behbehan to Shiraz Alignment. 37. Not having been over this country I am unable to describe it in details, and we have no information at all regarding a possible alignment up the Zohreh River from the Zaidan Plain to its source in the neighbourhood of Pul-i-Must (3,360 feet). If the Du Gunhazan-Basht track be followed gypsum hills are struck at 19 mil« and left at 23 miles ; at 28 miles more low hills are struck, and a descent is then made into a wide valley. At 53 miles it enters a narrow stony valley ; at 54 miles a steep ascent to a high pass, followed by a sharp descent. At 64 miles there is a sudden rise to a difficult pass, riding being almost impossible for 3 miles; this is followed by a descent to the village of Basht, reached at 77-g miles. At 80 miles more hills are entered and a river crossed ; the line then runs up a small valley and crosses a pass at 74miles, followed by a sharp descent to the Tang-i- Mura, reached at 86 miles. A swampy plain is then crossed to 94 miles. At 93 miles a watershed is reached, and at 95|- miles the village of Tal Ispid in the Fahlian valley. After crossing a plain the road at 100 miles becomes a difficult mule track along the gorge of Rud-i-Shul or Ab-i-Fablian till at 105 miles ; it then crosses a pass and descends again to Pul-i-Murt at 111 ^- miles. The alternative alignment referred to above joins in here. A deep gorge is now followed to 120 miles, and at 126 miles a pass is crossed. From 130 to 142 miles the line has to pass over a series of deep ravines and defiles separated by hills, several of the ravines being 100 feet deep. At 149 miles there is a sharp rise by a stony track to a small pass, reached at 160 miles. After passing through low hills for 2 miles, and over an uncultivated slope to 168 miles, the track becomes easy, passing through a well cultivated valley till Shiraz is reached at 180 miles. 08 . It appears from the above figures that a line from Ahwaz to Shiraz via Behbehan would be 300 miles long, from Mohammerah via Behbehan 330 miles, on the assumption that the line was no longer than the mule track ; but it is safe to assume that the total length w-ould not be less than 360 miles, owing to the necessity of approaching the steep passes by circuitous routes so as to avoid impossible gradients, is line has therefore no advantage in point of length over those from Bushire or unc ei Abbas, and it is plain from the above brief description of it that it would be very expensh e and difficult to construct. Lieutenant Hopkins estimated the probable length from Bundar Dilam to Shiraz at 210 miles; adding 140 miles from Mohammerah to Du am we arrive at a total of 350 miles (see Appendix II). .. 1 ^ seems plain that this line would be extremely difficult to construct, on account o ae utter opposition that may be expected from the various wild tribes whose erri oiy would be traversed by the line. Its value, it seems generally recognise , wou d )e purely strategical, and a concession for it is desirable solely in order to block necessary t e possible extension of the Bagdad Railway in this direction.23 APPENDIX I.

I disagree with Captain Hopkins’s estimate of the ability of the Mamasani, not to mention the Buwair Ahmad and Kashgai, to interfere with the line, and I am convinced that the British Government alone can never keep them in order; nor is it by any means certain that the Bakhtiari and Arabs will welcome railway enterprise. 4. The possibility of finding coal and oil anywhere near the line is too remote to he a factor in considering this alignment. The increase in population in districts, now tenanted by nomads, would probably be very slow indeed; the nomads would take good care of that. b. I think 50 per cent, too low a proportion to allow for working expenses, and as the line must start from Mohammerah or Khor Musa, and not Bunder Dilam, involving another 100 miles of line, I do not think that the figures on which Captain Hopkins relies can be accepted.APPENDIX II.

There are so-called works there. The lead seams run parallel to the general strike of the hills. It is found both in the form of an oxide and associated with copper. It is reduced to a metallic state by pulverisation, washing and heating in blast furnace, all of which opera tions are performed in the most primitive manner. The refuse copper ore is thrown away, as the miners are not acquainted with the manner of reducing it to a metallic state. There are about forty miners here. The yearly output is about 4,500 maunds, of which one-sixth is levied as a tax by the Pars Government. The Meshed Murghab district is said to contain lead mines. Report on the Commercial Possibilities of a Bushire—Shiraz Railway. In the various schemes of a railway system for Southern Persia which have heen before Government and are still under discussion, the all-important question of align ment has apparently been based on strategic considerations, and such infoimation as previous surveys afford as to the easiest routes for penetrating into the interior hom tie coast plain. j r -n • But nothing on the record indicates that the position and the needs of Persian trade In the south, its existing channels, the distribution of its resources, and present grouping of its trading capital have been taken into account. ^ , . . Statistical information of the internal trade of the larger cities of Southern Persia is still very incomplete, and takes no account of the movement o tra e in eac i ( irec ion. The trade reports of Aspahan and Kerman are the only known sources &amp; e ^ ® and figures. My journey to Shiraz was intended to supplement this from the special -«. F-r 'y; yyyiiitrs lying between Shiraz and Bushire, which is likely to be affected by the y* 6 ® (tnough not yet fixed), it would be necessary to spend three or ^ 'S up and down the various valleys.

It is hoped, however, that it will be possible at an early date to proceed with a commercial survey of all southern Fars, as to the utility of which there can be no doubt. j The foreign trade of Southern Persia has for many years now converged on fou? ports—towns of no particular prominence except as forwarding centres—and it i s interesting to note their relative importance in terms of the weight of goods imported and exported. An average of four to five years has been taken :— Number of| Inhabitants. Export. Import. Tons. Tons. 1. Bunder Abbas., { 5,000 (summer) 10,000 (winter) } 4,968 9,042 2.

Mohammerah .. 15,000 18,276 10,870 Therefore from the points of view, both of merchandise handled and population, Bushire and Mohammerah are to-day the most important of the Persian Gulf ports. Any estimates of the amount of merchandise in Southern Persia, which is or could be annually available for transport by a railway system, can be divided as under :— (a.) Produce and goods at present exported from South Persia, and possible development. (b.) Goods at present imported by the Gulf ports, and possible development. (c.) Goods and produce in the country restricted to local transport. (d.) Mineral produce, at present for the most part unexplored and quite undeveloped, remains merely a potential possibility, and no estimates can be given. ^a.j export irade. . Taking first the export trade, averaging a total of about 37,000 tons, the area from which it is derived is in the case of— t\t ^ 0 ^ lamillcva ^ 1 '' ^ ie Arabistan plain country between Dizful, Bam Hormus, Mohammerah, and Hindian chiefly, and during the last few years, owing to the insecun y o tie Bushire route, up to 700 tons from the Ispahan province by the Ahwaz road. r 1 J Busline.

How far the export trade of the province of Ears may be said to centre in Shiraz may be judged from its immediate district possessing the largest settled population in Southern Persia (estimated at 140,000), and from the outlying districts such as Istahbanat and Darab, on the borders of the Kerman province, sending in produce to Shiraz for export to Bushire, white the number of Persian merchants, and their personal character, is certainly superior to that of any other Persian town south of Ispahan. Produce of Pars handled in Shiraz, As to the quantity and weight of the produce of the province available for export trade, and handled in Shiraz, we have, firstly, the figures of actual exports via Bushire, which have been given in Table I, and Table IV appended gives the result of enquiries at Shiraz and elsewhere as to the actual production available for the market at the present time.29 ... •ft* Table l\ .

From the economic point of view the interdependence of commercia interests between Ispcahan, Shiraz, and Bushire, which has now existed tor several generations, cannot be too strongly insisted upon. Ispahan anc amac an are a important points for British trade in Persia ; the latter for Western eisia, e ormei for Central Persia. _ . j 4 . • 4 -n^ Table V appended gives the total weights of the output of major P r ® duc ^ in J^ province of Ispahan, as ascertained from the trade reports o spa an, oge the quantities which at present should be exported via the e f Sian M V ’ an( j way of Bushire, Ahwaz, or Bagdad, as ascertained from Ispahan, nohammerah and Bushire trade reports.

All things being equal, there is an inherent prejudice in favour of the Shiraz route. ^ Produce of Districts south of the Shiraz along Alignment. Thirdly, there has to be considered tbe produce available for transport and export of districts to the south of Shiraz, which would be tapped or affected by a line of railway running via Jahrum, and thence either to Busbire or Bunder Abbas. The produce of several, and the more important, of such districts, in which I made detailed enquiries, is given below in tables :— VI. Khumeh district of Shiraz. VII. Sarvistan. VIII. Fasa. IX.

My own impressions in the districts detailed above were that the yield (12,000 tons) represented merely the output sufficient to their wants and profits nowadays, and that lack of markets and the state of insecurity prevented double the amount of land being put under cultivation, as it easily might be were A railway traffic to afford facilities. Produce of Littoral touched by Bushire Alignment. Fourthly, in respect to a railway with a terminus at Bushire, fairly reliable information has been obtained of the produce of the grain growing coast districts of Dashti and Tangistan and Chahkutah, which would be traversed by a railway comino- from Jahrum or Firuzabad towards Bushire, but not by a railway from Jahrum to Bunder Abbas. These districts are not only very fertile, but they already produce grain for sale in good seasons many times more than their ^ own requirements, and have done for years a regular transport and export business in grain. This has been chiefly by sea, because of dearness of the limited camel transport and a railway traversing the heart of these districts would rapidly stimulate increased cultivation making distant points accessible that now send little to market. The commercial importance of the coastal plain, its prosperity and settled population are established facts, and as such they offer an immediate return for railway enterprise, which could not be hoped for in the districts between Bunder Abbas and Jahrum, Jahrum and Shiraz, for several years after the first train passed. It is to be borne in mind that the grain-producing coastal region, which covers all Arabistan, narrows from Bunder Dilam as far the southern extremity of Dashti, and practically ceases between Lingah and Bunder Abbas. Unsuitability of soil, low rate of rainfall, and absence of a “cold” season may be the reasons why Bunder Abbas has to rely on the Bushire littoral for grain. The low average rate of export of grain from Bushire of recent years has been due solely to continued drought in one district or another and shortness of seed; better times have now set in, and, with a railway intersecting the zone, the yield in poor years should be far better distributed, not only scarcity avoided.

Those which would lie considerably to the north of a line of railway running from Bushire in the direction of Ahram. (6.) Those which are between the sea and the coast-range of hills. (c.) Those which would lie along the route towards Dashti. I would therefore put the present total cultivation of Tangistan at an approximate figure of 2,170 gavs, though much more could be cultivated. In years of fair rainfall the average yield in this part of Persia is hardly less than 50 Hashem mans per gav. The total production of grain in Tangistan should therefore not be less than 5,000-6,000 tons. A fair quantity has come in to Bushire from Tangistan during the current year, but the reasons why so little as a rule is brought in are lack of market, the turmoil prevailing in Tangistan, and the very scanty number of transport animals (camels) possessed by the district. Out of the total quantity estimated above about 800 tons would be the production of villages under section (b) which, for the most part lying on the seashore, and separated by a range of hills, would probably send their grain by sea to Bushire. Villages under section (c) lying along the railway route, yielding a total of, say, 3,750 tons, and of this quantity 2,500 tons or more should be available for transport to Bushire, and export. Villages under section (a) producing, say, 1,470 tons in fair years, and having 1,000 tons of that quantity available for transport, would lie rather distant from a line of railway going direct from Bushire to Ahram. This is one of the most fertile corners of Tangistan, and in this connection I would point out that a connection, or extension, of 20 miles railway would make it practicable to transport the larger part of the extensive agricultural produce of Borazjun into Bushire by rail. On the langistan side Borazjun has about 935 gavs of cultivation, on the side towards Ziarat an Khushab it has about 1,014 gavs, on the side towards Kullul and Daliki abou 480 gavs. Borazjun has already an active though small local trade, and it is the first larg e place on the way to Kazerun. An extension of the rails as far as Borazjun shou ,i n years ot fair rainfall, not only permit the railway to transport about 1,000 tons gw 10 from northern Tangistan, but also, I estimate, :3,500 tons grain from the Borazjun district. Other produce:— f Ihe Khaviz valley (of Tangistan) produces no grain, but far the largest item o produce from Tangistan, after grain, is dates. It is difficult to estimate the number c ate trees at all accurately, but as Khaviz alone possesses 50,000, the total n lim j' langistan cannot be less than 100,000. The normal yield can hardly be less tna 1,500 to 2,000 tons, and allowing for local consumption, 750 tons should be aval a tor transport to Bushire or intermediate places.39 Limes, sweet limes, and other fruits usually taken away from the Khaviz district amount to some 1,000 tons. Resume of Estimated Produce. To sum up the produce of the principal districts (except Kowar and Kafr, Kir and Karzi) lying between Shiraz and Bushire, and likely to benefit materially any railway on a Shiraz, Jahrum, Bushire alignment is :— District.

In addition to a comparatively small quantity of local produce from Kazerun and Behbehan the following districts must always retain Bushire as a market, and they are wealthy as Persian districts go.

( ^ As has been shown in Tables II and III, from 'the Fars side there'exists no exnorf traffic from the hinterland of Bunder Abbas, and practically none behind Lingah • th is no output of gum, almonds, raisins, &amp;c. More important still, there is no ot 6 ' 6 cultivating districts along tht littoral near Bunder Abbas. As to the intermediate districts between Bunder Abbas and Jahrum, no oppor tunity has been given to the writer to inspect them, but it is certain that they ar very sparsely inhabited, cultivating only for their own immediate needs, and that the inhabitants are not a trading population, with the possible exception of Lar. Reasons why little surplus Grain can be relied on: Bunder Abbas Alignment Lieutenant Wilson assumes 2 tons per family as the normal surplus of grain available for export, and estimating 50,000 families on the alignment between Bunder Abbas and Shiraz and the districts surrounding Shiraz, has calculated the normal grain surplus at 100,000 tons. He further estimates the probable total export traffic at not less than 200,000* tons after the first year or two. After my own enquiries over the first 100 miles of that route, and relying on several years’ acquaintance with the grain trade in the littoral, I think his estimate unreasonably exaggerated and sanguine for the following reasons :— (a.) He takes as a basis estimates in 1893 and 1907 (by a telegraph official) of the yield round Shiraz, viz., 60,000 and 90,000 tons of grain produced by 20,000 families, to feed a population of 140,000 (say, 38,000 families'. He reckons 4 tons of grain produced to each family, 2 tons of which is surplus available for sale. Thus he reckons 40,000 tons available in Shiraz and 50 miles round. The average consumption of wheat per family I believe to be rather less than 1 ton per annum ; in towns perhaps Ij- tons. This would mean a total of 30,000 tons tor 28,000 families. Allowing at least 1 ton barley for feed of one or more ploughing animals per family, this would add another 20,000 tons. Reserve and sowing seed additional. Thus 28,000 families would require between 50,000 to 60,000 tons for personal use, and not more than 20,000 to 30,000 tons could be a probable surplus, even if other premises are correct. (h.) But after careful estimates on the spot, checked by the subsequent yield and expoit from various small ports, I have found the total production of grain in the Bushue littoral, an area of 180 miles by 20 to 30 miles broad, to have been about 60,000 tons, of which 30,000 should be available for export. This area is plain country, a\ing far more extensive grain cultivation than the vallevs round Shiraz, while the material prosperity of the peasantry is greater. I therefore doubt if peasantry in the ai ea cited by Lieutenant W ilson produce more than 3 tons per family (if such a method of computation be at all reliable), or 60,000 tons in all. ^ ar ^ a ^ ie ^ as ^ a ^ en are, I think, valleys and districts to the noi^ o S nraz, whence animal transport to Shiraz would prove far too costly for grain. r + (-) -r^-i 111 valle y s Shiraz to the neighbourhood of Jahrum, parallel in aaa + rS ^ mdes of the route, showed an existing production of less than ’ . \°j S ’ n ^ ar y of which seemed required for district consumption. 16U e l na ^ t Wilson himself states that the Bunder Abbas line to Shiraz passes iroug i cesert country, mostly waterless to within a few miles of Lar, for frnncmr + ^ 611 J 0 o ie ^ us ]^ re littoral, which is open plain country rate of hire hitivJ F T C fp 16 S ’i C i Ina ^ es car riage of grain for more than 30-35 miles pro it wmikl t* 1 r f 3 va J e y s Fars, closed in by mountain ranges, it is unlikely tl of thp ^ i° ri ^ ram t° the railway.from more than 20 miles away on either si of the me or less if ra.lway freight is considered in addition. ^ Bimhirp ( ea + J 0 aai 1 rna | transport in the country along the Bunder Abbas a unents would limit the quantity that could be brought in to the railway41 (h. ) Quite apart from the lack of enterprise on the part of the peasanty who are slack to tdl more than their own needs and to bring their produce into distent markets there exists a general (quasi-rehgious) aversion on the part of the Persian merchant classes to buy and sell grain for the European market, ‘ erciiant °n the other hand, even in the coast districts of Bushire and Arabistan, where it is easy foi Bi itish firms in the ports to get into personal touch with villages, cultivators, and sellers, these British farms have never pushed the grain trade, have always regarded it with gieat caution, and refrained from sending buyers far afield. In Arabistan “ U1 ' e , 18 t lon g lm « of sea-coast and a network of waterways, 20,000 to 30,000 tons have been the extreme limits of exports for years past. (i.) Bunder Abbas has no present connection with the grain trade, and has, in poor years, to buy its own requirements elsewhere. r len thousand to fifteen thousand tons would therefore, I am inclined to think be a very liberal estimate of the likely export of grain over the Shim-Bunder Abbas align ment (and that mostly north of Jahrum) for several years after the completion of railway construction. J Similarly, d propos of Lieutenant Wilson’s figures for other available produce— 10,000 tons it should he said that rosewater is produced almost entirely near Firuzabad at a considerable distance from the Bundar Abbas alignment, while the wild almond tree from which gum insoluble is produced, flourishes in the mountains in a line from Jahrum to Behbehan, and is said to be comparatively scarce east of Jahrum. It is difficult to estimate that a line from Shiraz to Bunder Abbas could count at its inception on more than some 6,000 tons of exports from up-country, with the addition of whatever surpluses of grain may he available. It would be a matter of years before cultivation for export could be expected to produce the quantity of produce raised, for instance, in Firuzabad and Dashti on the Bushire alignment. Comparison of Produce: Bushire and Bunder Abbas Alignments : Superiority of Bushire. Comparison of possible export trade by the respective alignments may be concluded by saying that 21,000 tons to 6,000 tons should very fairly represent the advantage of the Bushire alignment over a Bunder Abbas alignment, under existing conditions to-day, and there is little doubt that the districts traversed by the Bushire alignment would respond far more freely and quickly to the advantage of intercommunication brought by railway transport, so that the original 21,000 tons should be capable of rapid expansion, in grain more especially. Bushire has an existing export trade on which it would be easy to build up— Bunder Abbas has none—in the direction that a Fars railway would take. I do not think that my estimate of possibilities of increasing the grain trade from Bushire are at all exaggerated ; the chief difficulty keeping back the few British firms at Bushire is inability to get quickly into contact with inland buying centres, and 1911-12 has shown what firms bent on filling ships can purchase if they devote their attention to it. (b.) Imports. For considerations of railway transport the import trade of Southern Persia presents very distinct characteristics to those of the export trade. There is much to hope that the export of produce would expand immediately with the advent of a railway, for Fars is distinctly an agricultural country ; hut the consumption of imports from abroad would continue to be restricted to very narrow limits for a very long period. The majoi requirements of Southern Persians from abroad are : (1) food-stuffs, (2) clothing stuffs, and it is impossible to contemplate them generally changing their mode of li\ ing and dress to a higher standard of luxury till one or more generations have passed. The settled population of Fars has been estimated to be about 420,000 ; the nomadic population possibly numbers more than 300,000. Shiraz, Jahium, and the Bushire peninsula are the only townships computed to have over 20,000 inhabitants. There is, therefore, little apparent scope for increase in ths present scale ot imports except perhaps:— (a.) In machinery. (b.) In wood and other heavy goods. A . , ... . (c.) If the Ispahan market were brought into connection by rail uiti that ot Shiraz. [2019 i—1]43 (1.) Imports retained in Bushire District It is, however, certain that Bushire and the districts immediately dependent on ^it for supplies, estimated to contain at least 164,000 inhabitants (though nearer 200 000 in my opinion), retain a large share of the imports ; I estimate this sW to be about one-third, or, say, o,500 tons. The area supplied is bounded by Behbehan on the north, Kazerun on the north-east, Firuzabad on the east. Imports that reach Shiraz. This would, on the average of the five years taken above, leave some 10,700 tons forwarded to Shiraz, or along the main caravan route. On an estimate, based on prevailing conditions and area of demand, I had a year ago computed transport of the principal lines of goods to Shiraz to have approximated in :— Table XVII.—Imports transported to Shiraz. 1907-8. 1908-9. 1909-10.

Therefore, even in such a poor year as 1910-11, it is justifiable to assume that between 7,000 and 8,000 tons of merchandise were forwarded to Shiraz. (2.) Imports that reach Ispahan. Similar information as regards Ispahan was still more difficult to obtain in Shiraz Merchants were unanimously agreed that the year 1910-11 (the last completed year at the date of my visit) had been so disturbed as to have made forwarding to Ispahan almost impossible. The number of large caravans which had got through could be counted on one’s fingers; practically no sugar at all had been sent, and very few cotton-goods. Shiraz merchants are more secretive than those of Bush ire as to their business, and after more than a week’s interviews I could only obtain reliable information of the following forwardings :— Piece-goods Tea, spices Metals ..

Existing Distribution of Imports. On the examination given above, I should sum up the existing distribution of imports, which would confront railway construction to Shiraz, as follows :— (a.) Average annual consumption of Shiraz (received entirely vi&amp; Bushire) from 8,000 to 10,000 tons. (N.B.—This area includes Yezd under favourable conditions.) (6.) As regards Ispahan, of a consumption of 4,500 tons derived from non-Kussian sources, and originally from the Gulf, say 2,000 tons of that quantity already reached Ispahan via Shiraz, leaving for railway transport to compete for the carrying of an extra 2,500 tons. Importance of Transport Connection: Shiraz to Ispahan. Ispahan and Hamadan are admittedly the two most important points of vantage for British imports into Persia to be held at all costs; and one of the. pimcipa pro ems which would arise from the construction of a railway to Shiraz is t e su sequen position of Ispahan. The linking up of Shiraz to Ispahan by rail would make all the difference in the world. If the scheme of railway from the Gulf is to stop shoit at Shiraz, then the import trade is certain to remain stationary for many years the Shiraz market is easily liable to congestion, as has been seieta lines , recent years, when sales in the districts and forwarding to spaan wei ^ t disorders. The prospects of railway enterprise will be serious y amper ^ qLonld also contemplated to improve communications between naz an , s P,i 'i v 0 f therefore, Ispahan be connected witli some other rai \vay s\s etn, ' the other Luristan or Kermanshah, or from the Russian frontier via Tehran and on the ^ther hand, communications between Shiraz and Ispahan be left *7reduSn not only item (b), -2,500 tons, being eliminated from the ft.mate.but also a reduction on the average annual consumption via Shiraz (a ) y a Shiraz and the area the further effect of detaching the Yezd district from that available for the development of the import trade would be conti eastern Pars alone. ^ [2619i—l]Is is difficult to surmise in what directions, other than import and export, railw transport could be increased. Local traffic in agricultural produce will offer, but 7 know of scanty, if any, mineral deposits with a commercial value in the neighbourhood of either the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz or the Bushire alignment. Machinery and manu facturing works will only be introduced by European financial enterprise. For these reasons it is a matter of supreme interest to consider at an early stage whether an extension of the railway in _ the direction of Ispahan be feasible from the political point of view ; commercially, with the Ispahan market divorced from that of Shiraz, a railway to the latter centre would, as far as imports are concerned, be leading nowhere. Comparison of Imports and Export Trade : both Alignments. In the foregoing an attempt has been made to analyse carefully the existing trade to and from the termini on the Gulf, and more particularly to arrive at an estimate of the weight of goods, usually transported nowadays via Bushire and Bunder Abbas which would be at once available for railway transport from those ports to Shiraz. Provided that arrangements are made for maintaining a forwarding connection with Ispahan, I estimate in fair years— u Available Export Traffic. Available Import Traffic. Tons. Tons. For a railway from Bushire to Shiraz Over 21,000 9,000 to 12,000 „ „ Bunder Abbas to Shiraz 6,000 9,000 to 12,000 [?] In these figures no account of purely local traffic is taken, nor of the weight of cereals, which should find their way to the coast from the districts that now only produce for local consumption. I have shown the import consumption for Shiraz as the same in each case, but, for cogent reasons given below, I am of opinion that imports to Shiraz via Bunder Abbas could not for a term of years expect to replace .the whole of the carrying trade now in the hands of Bushire merchants. It is, however, tolerably clear that a line via Bushire should be twice or three times as remunerative in point of freight-earnings as a line from Bunder Abbas. Geiieral Objections to Bunder Abbas—Shiraz Alignment. t rom the commercial point of view there are moreover weighty objections of a general character to the suggested Bunder Abbas, as compared with the Bushire, con nection with Shiraz. A commentary is given below on the more striking of these. Previous Standpoint in Question of Alignment. I understand the position to be as follows:—- It had always been assumed, and is no doubt commonly taken for granted, tha v lenever the railway development of Persia is taken in hand Bushire and Shiraz wouli be connected, as both are situated on the main trade artery. T e depaitmental committee of the Government of India endorsed that opinioD and aiso a proposal to link up Bunder Abbas with Shiraz, and ultimately Shiraz witl e mr ^ usa. The Government of India, while recommending the Bunder Abbas- naz connection, did not accept its committee’s opinion as regards the utility of i usnire-Shiraz railway. Subsequently when Mr. Greenway oresented to the Foreigi ce a o ra dways for which his syndicate proposed to ask concessions absolute! no mention was made of linking up Bushire with the interior. , -n eei ] 1 ^d^d in 1910 that a survey from Bushire to Aliabad, on th f llnc ei Abbas-Shiraz route, should be made in order to examine thi o?Jahrum 0t &amp; JUnCtl ° n ° f lines from B ^shire and Bunder Abbas in the neighbourhoo(47 Previous Objections to Bushire Alignment. Official discouragement of a Bushire-Shiraz railway and support of the Bunder Abbas connection may conceivably have been based by the Government of India on two assumptions commonly held :— (1.) That the physical geography of the country between Bushire and Shiraz rendered railway-making an impracticable, or at any rate financially inadmissible, project. (2.) I hat the port of Bushire was incapable of improvement to make it suitable as a railway terminus. Survey of Bushire Harbour needed. As regards (2) it is respectfully _ submitted that the question of the specific amelioration of the roadsteads of Bushire and Bunder Abbas has never been taken up, and it is probable that very considerable improvement of the anchorage and facilities for ships could be effected. I am also convinced that the dredging of channels from and into.the anchorages, and a steam lighterage company properly equipped would effect a vast difference to the port as it is, and enable it to cope with a largely increased traffic. In any case it is unjustifiable to condemn permanently the development of trade in the hinterland of Bushire (with all irs British traditions) by reason of an opinion widely held by passing travellers as to the difficulties of the anchorage, and a technical report on the possibilities of improvement of the various Gulf harbours is essential before the scheme of railway exploitation is finally settled. Such a report would be of immediate practical value. . Practicability of Bushire Alignment. 1. The survey of Lieutenant Wilson shows that by making a considerable detour to the south-east, railroad construction linking Bushire with Shiraz via Jahrum would be no more difficult than most similar undertakings in Persia, though the Bunder Abbas- Jahrum alignment is far easier. His estimates of the length and cost of construction of such railways are :—■ Bushire-.Tahi um-Shiraz, 354 miles Bunder Abbas-Jahrum-Shiraz, 343 miles £ 1.655.000 1.701.000 Assuming the lines to be constructed according to these surveys, with practically similar mileage and therefore presumably freight charges also, it is extremely unlikely that any of the present import trade via Bushire would be diverted to Bundei Abbas, nor that part of the export trade from Shiraz and north of it. Bushire has the advantage of a trading connection which is not possessed by the other port. Shippmo freights from Europe would not differentiate perceptibly between the two ports ; and only in port dues, lighterage, &amp;c., might Bunder Abbas be at an advantage. e 11168 would be competitive over their greater distance, and commercially that from Bum ei Abbas is more likely to lose. . , But now that the former belief has been refuted, and it is established that at least one possible railway alignment from Bushire does exist, f^ 1616 801116 ^ attempting to find a shorter and more direct route between Bushire and Shiraz. t must be admitted that all possible routes have not been surveyed, and a great deal still remains to be done. Lieutenant Wilson mentions the possibility of an alignment along the Shahpur River, which could not greatly exceed 200 miles in length and from personal observation I can say that at least 80 mi es o its eng i inverse ev P My own journey vi&amp; Firuzabadled me to think that railway construction should oe easy for a large part of the distance between Bushire and Firuzabad It cannot be necessary to traverse over 350 miles to cover the distance Ween the coast and Shiraz, when caravan traffic for a century and ; ;, ha11 '^b ^i mr^ following routes only 180 to 200 miles in length Mter a!!, cheapness of prima^ construction at the price of long detours does not always J towards results, and the cost incurred in making the detour would go a long way towards payment of dearer construction over a shorter route. ^ ^ ^ March, 1911,1 In my memorandum with despatch iNo. , L ’ , 4- 0 gave details tending to show that in recent years of d ' S ”f. r . bXc anl 80,000Z. and more were being paid annually in tiansp ^ [2619 i— 1 ]to prove that a railway tariff need not be low at the beginning, and should produce 68 fair revenue. a Inadvisability of leaving Bushire out of Scheme of Development. All existing data make it tolerably certain that, even if railway connection u Shiraz were first established via Bunder Abbas, Bushire would still continue to be ^ important trading centre, not only of the plain-country, but also for the hinfprl t?: — ...... i -i • , UWir Un(i, including Kazerun, Firuzabud, Behbehan, Borazjun, Dilam, &amp;c., while in addition it f ’ every likelihood of growing into a port for grain export. Consequently, it will hardly be possible—in the neutral zone as it is to sterilize 't for railway transport; from Arabistan to Bunder Abbas is an enormous stretch of coast line, with a wide radius inland, to be left unexploited. Bushire would always remain to tempt enterprise, British, Persian, or foreign ; and the mere fact of concessions for railways being obtained and work commenced on lines from Bunder Abbas and Arabistan 1 would at once lead opposition syndicates to seize on what they might consider a tactical mistake, and construct via Bushire. Foreign influences, notably German, have culti vated an interest in Bushire for years past; the Germans are, aided by a subsidy, in the process of building up a grain trade. It is impossible to think of Bushire, even if evacuated as useless by British trade interests, being similarly treated by our foreign rivals. And it is practically certain that, were a railway constructed from Bushire °to Shiraz by any shorter route than the Bunder Abbas line, this latter would drop out of public favour entirely. .--B Persian preference for Bushire Alignment and attention to their Interests. In previous treatment of the question of these alternative routes, the point of view has been exclusively English. Nothing^ has been noted as to the interests and wishes of tne Persian inhabitants of the south in the matter of alignment. Yet it would be ] well to recognise that when the scheme of railways is fin dly tabled, with British official support, and made known in Persia, anything contrary to accepted notions of the Peisian people is bound to meet with the most strenuous opposition. After a residence of five to six years in the Gulf, during which, from the nature of ray work, I have been constantly and closely in touch with Persian trade, Persian merchants, and .various classes m the country, I can only express the most emphatic opinion that Persian notables, traders, and shopkeepers in Shiraz, Bushire, and to an extent in Ispahan, wou cemand the Bushire connection, and raise pandemonium in their own forcible as ion o oppose the Bunder Abbas alignment, and influence the Persian Government against it.

Reasons foi likely Persian Opposition to Bunder Abbas Alignment.■H 49 O. Uepiec at'on and loss of capital would be only less damaging than disturbance to credit, which not only artect Persians in substantial positions^ but British fims as wel . One must not lose sight of the fact that the best part oi i 00 0001 worth of British capital ,s tied up in the trade now carried on between Bushire, Shiraz and Gieat n am. I know of British firms who have more than 20,0001. out permanently u, advances to Persian merchants on whom and on which system they rely for a large business there are o her British firms which are at present saddled, not only with large outstandings, but also with mortgages on property as security. This system works very nicely as long as trade flows through, when the Persian merchant wifi pay off debts airly contentedly ; but there is no doubt that from the time Bushire is cut off from the carrying trade with Shiraz, and the Bushire merchant unable to carry on the former extensive operations, all this money now out on loan or tied up as security would become unrealisable assets. British firms might thus, through the dislocation of trade, conceivably lose very heavily indeed. 4. Bunder Abbas, with a population reckoned at not more than 5,000 in summer counts but one or two Persian merchants of any consideration, trade being very largely m the hands of Hindus, who, in their turn, never have had any establishment in Shiraz, Bushire, Ispahan, and Oenuiai L ersia. It is inconceivable that the present generation of moneyed Persian merchants in Bushire would transplant themselves and their businesses to Bunder Abbas, while for many considerations it is unlikely that Hindus (whose business is conducted through Indian and not Manchester houses) would be able to yfiect much in Ears for a long time. Further, the European firms, which have maintained expensive agencies in Bushire for many vears, are enabled to do so by supplementing forwarding business by sales for the Bushire district, and often a very profitable trade in grain. They would hardly be able to do so if the forwarding business were diverted, nor would forwarding business in Bunder Abbas alone be sufficient inducement to open there in several cases. I should apprehend the evacuation of the Bushire field by British firms to foreign interests, particularly those financed like the German. 5. Unsuitability of climate in Bunder Abbas, though it has been exaggerated in the past, is a very potent factor in a question involving the transplantation of the forwarding terminus for Ears and Central Persia. Even Persians of the Gulf regard the climate of Bunder Abbas with detestation, and its own inhabitants move away to Minab in the summer. As a climate for Europeans, it is exceptionally trying, those who live there at present being never long without a change of air. It has practically no winter season. Unpleasant as is Bushire in tiie heat of summer, climatically it is infinitely preferable and more bracing in the winter than Bunder Abbas. The rainfall of Bunder Abbas is poorer than anywhere in the upper Gulf; the soil is sandy and unsuitable for crops. At present a small squalid town, it would take years to make the residential settlement necessary for a large trade mart. 6. It is fallacious to suppose that Bushire trade is declining. For the year 1911-12 the value of imports and exports aggregated 1,507,4331., an increase of 576,0001. on the previous year. Sufficient has been said to explain the certainty of great local opposition in Ears and neighbouring districts to Bunder Abbas being made the sole railway terminus for Shiraz. There are other strong arguments against it. There is the utility and importance of Bushire to the Persian Government; the port and town must possess solid advantages over other Gulf ports to have retained for so long the bulk of trade from the south with Central Persia. It is the head-quarters of a Persian provincial administration, and has been formerly the principal Persian port. It is inconceivable that the Persian Government should agree to a railway system which pointedly ignores Bushire and leaves a stretch of seaboard 400-500 miles long and a fertile region extending more than 100 miles inland in its present wild and undeveloped state. Our motive would, in Persian nationalist eyes, appear too sinister ; to divorce the Ears Government from the Upper Gulf ports and leave them at our mercy from the sea, it would be serving our own strategic interests to the disadvantage of Persian consolidation. A Bunder Abbas-Shiraz line would pass right outside the habitats of the turbulent nomad tribes of Ears, Kashgai, Mamasenni, Kuhgelus; have no civilising and quieting effect on them ; neither make them sedentary nor permit of military force being introduced into their present large sphere, and leave them masters of the situation. Financially also, it must be noted that Bushire brought in 78,468£. to the customs nue in duties alone in 1911-12 as against 34,993 for Bunder Abbas. revenue50 o o Summary. Examined from ail local points of view, the Bunder Abbas-Shiraz line has nothing to justify its existence viz-d-vis a Bnshire-Shiraz connection; it seems to me illogical and indefensible commercially as a pioneer line. 1. On the showing of the only comparative survey at present to hand, the Bushire route surveyed would cost 50,0001 less to construct, and be only 11 miles longer. 2. Apart from the q lestion of guarantees, only the alignment showing the greatest existing and probable carrying trade, and the prospect of a quick return, is likely to prove palateable to the financial interests involved; and a Bushire line ought to command, from the very beginning, some 30,000 tons, or more than double what could be hoped from a Bunder Abbas alignment. 3. The Bushire alignment traverses districts far more tranquil, with a more numerous and wealthier population, already accustomed for a considerable distance to trading with sea-ports and foreign interests. These districts present better possibilities, and are even now more widely cultivated than those along the lower portion of the Bunder Abbas alignment ; and it is certain that whatever surplus produce might be available in the interior after construction of a Bunder Abbas line, more than that quantity would be available along a Bushire-Shiraz line. 4. Bushire is already a grain-exporting centre for the Gulf littoral (which Bunder Abbas can never he), and it could easily become an important port for the export of grain coming from all quarters. 5. Bushire has a large existing trade with the interior of Ears, and the interests of Shiraz are largely interdependent with those of Bushire. Bunder Abbas has no existing trade relations with Shiraz ; it would take years to build them up, and there is not the slightest demand on the part of the inhabitants of Ears and Shiraz to be linked up with Bunder Abbas w r hile the demand for quicker transport between Bushire and Shiraz does exist. 6. Bunder Abbas is in a backward state as compared with Bushire, and suffers from climatic and other disadvantages of situation. 7. Persian opposition, both commercial and official, to replacing Bushire by Bunder Abbas as the railway terminus and port for Ears and Central Persia is certain. 8. However possible it might prove to delay the construction of a Bushire-Shiraz alignment, it is bound to come by force of public opinion, and would necessarily compete with the Bunder Abbas branch, while it is more than questionable whether to leave this historic connection out of the railway scheme would not be a tactical mistake, of which our commercial and political rivals would at once take advantage. 9. In the case of either alignment, a continuation of the line towards Ispahan, or at all events an improved system of transport, is a sine qua non if the import trade from the coast is intended to be increased arid we are to retain control of the markets of Ispahan from the Gulf. 10. In either case, it is no doubt realised that the payment of the price of the concession in Tehran would convey no practical title to construction in districts ruled by semi-independent chiefs, just in the same way as the Oil Company’s concession has not freed it from the necessity of compensating the ruler of Arabistan and obtaining his co-operation. As a business undertaking, and from the point of view of our trade, I consider the prospects of commercial profit from a Bushire—Shiraz railroad superior to those of any other line contempla'-ed from the Gulf, and sufficiently satisfactory to warrant The project being pushed forward before others that have been mentioned. ■ I strongly urge a careful survey of the best means of suitably improving Bushire harbour, and the probable cost ; and a similar investigation at Bunder Abbas. In conclusion, I am strongly of opinion that the natural lines of commercial development in Southern Persia offer the best prospects for success of railroad construction, viz., the existing Bushire-Shiraz and Bunder Abbas—Kerman trade routes.
