It will be convenient here to give a short summary of recent events which have lei up to the present position. Sur Is a port lying roughly a hunirel miles to the Eist of Muscat and owes Its Importance largely to Its being the nearest ihow-harbour to Inila In Arabia. Dhows ply regularly from Sur to Bombay &amp; Karachi, Socotra, Aden, Zanzibar an! the African coast ani also up the Persian Gulf ani over to the Mekran coast. There is quite a conslierable traie with India ani a small colony of Inilan traiers has been reslient there for many years. A very large proportion of the Inhabitants belong to the A1 junabeh tribe which Is ilvliei into four sections viz the Arameh, Mukanneh, Farwarl ami Ghlalln ani all except the last namei have been Involve! In the ilsturbances. s. G. P. I—247 P. A. A H. B. M. Consal Muscat—6.12-11 500In parenthtsls, I may ramark that Sur has always been notorious for the turbulence of its inhabitants ani before the yacht Nur-ul-Bahr was soli His Highness the Sultan usel frequently to fini it advisable to visit Sur and assert his authority. It seems the last time he went was in 1918 when he arrang ed the settlement of many inter-tribal murier cases, imprisoned twenty-six greater ani lesser Sheikhs and fined the tribes Rrl4000, tjais strong action keeping the peace for about two years. In 1019 the Muscat Customs were reorganisei ani the people of Sur seeing th*tt in future the dues would be more strictly enforced refused to allow a custom house to be built. In 1930, therefore, Captain McCollun^the then Wazi^ went to Sur in H.M.S. Britomart and succeeded in persuading the people to accept the new arrangements. Things went smoothly for a short while and then smuggling began again and has continued ever since; the custom house was not built, difficulties being in variably placed in the way and the Wali became as power- less ani Inept as ever. Meanwhile a stormy petrel of the Arameh section one Walal nalals who hal been banlshel from Sur In 1618 by flls High ness for murdering a Farwarl returned with the grudging permission of the Council of Ministers and was In 198X murdered by some of the relatives of his earlier victim. This reopened the old vendetta and Incidentally several new ones. Spasmodic murdering went on and In 1923 wit Council of Ministers sent Sheikh Raschld the Minister for Religious Affairs to enieavour to put an eni to the feuis. He returned having been openly flouted and having nothing and in July Sheikh Zobelr the Minister of Justice accompanied by Captain Alban and 150 levies and 3 machine guns proceeded to Sur and occupied the Fort. Zobelr reported that he had settled all feuds and caused blood- -money to be paid over immediately in his presence; he alsorecoverei 6400 Dollars customs 4ues from the merchants ani t fined the tribes 4000 Dollars. A site was selected for a new custom house ani the party returned to Muscat In trlumpit^ Unfortunately there was one case in which blood money was not accepted. This was for the murder of a Sheikh of the Mukanneh and the Mukanneh agreed to pardon the murderer^ an Arameh. Zobeir brought him to Muscat and he was imprison ed there and lately released. He returned to Sur and on entering the outskirts met an armed slave whom he recog nised as one of the murdered Sheikh'fc men. Deciding that the slave had been detailed to Kill him he fired and the end of the fight was that the slave was killed. The rival tribes hearing the shots immediately seized their rifles and started firing indiscriminately into one another the result of which was an Arameh boy was killed and another wounded. The Farwari then took a hand and seized a water donkey belonging to the Arameh; a struggle ensued in which an Arameh girl was killed. At the opening of Ramzan the three sections were all under arms and firing was reported to be going on intermittently. The Wall was however able to use the Ramzan fast as a weapon to arrange a forty five day armistice which is still in force. 3. Before I left Muscat I had long interviews with His Highness, with Sayed Nadir President of the Conncil of Ministers and with the remaining three members of the Councils All are agreed that the Sur tribesmen deserve a sharp lesson but all are not agreed as to how it was to be ^iven. His Highness was in favour of waltzing till tho autumn and making a big show of it with the presence of one of H.M.s ships. He suggested that he and I and one of the Ministers should proceed on the man-of-war while the Commandant Muscat Infantry with as many men as he could raise and another Minister should go in dhows if necessary)^ towed by the Muscat motor cruiser or if impracticable.go by land. H.H. said that supported by such a forge he would certainly beable to assert his authority)^ over the tribesmen ani a perm anent garrison might be left In ^ur to ensure the bullilng of the customs house ani the preservation of law anl orier, Sayei Nailr was In favour of asking for a man-of-war to be sent at once but I couli not get out of him how he propose! to settle Inter-trlbal feuis with a man-of-war. The other Ministers who were not even agreed amongst themselve male various suggestions In varying degrees of futility design ed mainly to shift the respons^lblllty on to other shoulders but after much argument I succeeded In making them see the wisdom of plan. In order to prevent further bloodshed meanwhile H.H. has Instructed the Sheikh of the A1 Jaalan (who I suspect has been bribed for the purpose) to arrange an armistice till the autumn and I have no doubt the Sheikh will be able to effect this. I hope It will be possible to secure the services of one of H.M.'s ships for this expedition. I do not suppose for one moment that any offensive tactics will be necessary as the mere presence of a man-of-war will have the desited sobering effect In conjunction with the arrival of a force of the Muscat Infantry. I doubt If H.H. will be anxious to move against Sur before the end of September and so there Is plenty of time for the new Wazlr ana the Commandant to perfect plans according to H.H.'s Ideas. 5. But It seems to me that no permanent peace In places like Sur can possibly be secured until they are brought Into close touch with Muscat by frequent visits of State officials. The possession of a sea-going vessel suitable for coastal work In any weather and capable of carrying not only an Inspecting official and his staff but also a small force of soldiers If necessary would secure this and I will refer to this subject in a separate communication. 6 In addition to the tribal disturbances detailed above53 ani the smuggling which must be causing a conslierable loss of revenue there are sinister rumours of renewei slave-trafling being carrlei on in anl near Sur, According to H.H. the victims are mainly from Dhofar district (which is his private estate) ani I have no loubt that it was this which lei him to mention it to me. In fact he was naive enough to admit that if the people of Sur couli not get along without slaves he would much prefer thnt they took tnen from Zanzibar and the African coast rather than from his private preserves • However, I have had no actual complaints of slaves from that part, my only cooroboratlvc evidence being a request from the Resident at Zanzibar for information as to the whereabouts of a native of that Island who was said to have sailed for Sur some months ago. But regardless of the tribal situation of Sur that alono would be sufficient excuse to ask for the services of a man-of-war.

Saiyid Nadir 1 s adventure to Hail. Sir, I haye the honour to refer you to your lTo.45 3-S of August 9th 1924 and to subnit,herevlth,an interim report on my investi/rations in the matter of the Hail incident, 2. Wlien I saw His Highness in Bombay I endeavoured to extract from him his opinion in the case but he spoke only very vaguely of it and said that ho had written to Sayed Nadir to explain everything to me. 3. On my return here and immediately after the cere- -monial visits were over I summoned Sayed Nadir to give me his side of the question.His account of the actual facts of his exptdition did not vary materially from the version already telegraphed to you but when I pressed for the history of his previous relations with Habib bin Suleiyum al Dhanki and Shaikh Sultan al Eattachi he became less communicative. He dwelt on the seriousness of the Bani Eattash's action in defying the Council and condemned his usurpation of the authority of His Highness to settle cases of this kind. When I asked him whether he had the full authority of the Council to proceed on this expedition he produced a letter signed by all the members individually w.ich he nss^red v^as ^iven him before his departure to Hsil it —WlL I .&amp; It is,3aowever f ny considered opinion that he obtained this white&lt; -wasking document at a very much later date - in fact to me as I glanced at it the ink appeared to 'be hardly dry - as in the last resort the other members of the Council would not,I think, 'be willing to sec him humbled, I may say that the original notice sent to the Agency stating that he was departing for Hail was signed 'by him only and not 'by the whole Council as it should have 'been if he had been proceeding in a public and not in a private capacity* Altogether I regret to say I do not think Sayed Tadir was entirely candid with me. 4, I then invited the Council as a whole to mtet me and make sug .estions as to the action to be taken against the Bani Battash. Here I may say that no letter had up till then been written by this Agencjjto the Shaikh of the Bani Battash as the Council had advised the Superintendent that matters had better await my return. In order to avoid useless recriminations I opened the meeting by stating that we were not assembled to discuss the riihtc and wrongs of Sayed ITadir 1 s action - that would be consi- -dered later by higher authority - but to decide on a scheme cal- -culated to repair the damage already done to Muscat's prestige. This jave the three members of the Council a chance to disown Sayed lladir's action but they did not take it. I explained that our aim must be firstly to secure the return of the captured property and compensation for tho men killed and secondly to obtain from the Shaikh of the Bani Battash a de- aration tliat k« would te willing to subnit to Muscat's au- ▼ si ity in future and furnish an apology for his action. T- c -thority in Council agreed to this and I then enquired from t:.«a ::c~ tlisy Proposed to carry tht* out having due regard to the f^et that owing to the nature of the country and the/ lack of resources ailitaiy action was only advisable in the last re so ..v. Aft a long discussion it was decided fir -t of all the Council would call in Hah ib, examine him and then sere. . i- on to ne. See oral \ that I should write to the Shaikh of the Bani ^attj-h proposing a meeting between hin and myself in order that he should give ne his side of the queswicn.I ^ &amp;&gt; 5. I nsiy say tliat the Council adrised ne tkat if I wrote to the Shaikh assking for an explanation of his conduct or re- -quested him to come and see me or sugge-ted that X should visit him he would prohahly return an evasive answer and in the Councils opinion the best way to establish connection with him would be firstly to get him to a^ree to a meeting and then to ask him to sugc^st a suitable place, 6 0 Habib duly arrived and his revelations to me have shown that the trouble is very much more deep^ge^fid than I thought originally. He is a man of no standing as regards his birth and in his younger days (he must be about 70 now)had emigrated to the Belgian Congo where he made a fortune as a contractor and trader. About 16 years ago he returned to the country of his birth,bought various villages and date groves and settled down as a country gentleman, .Being of no standing he was not received as an equal by the notabilities of Muscat and since his return has never ceased by means of bribes and donations to endeavour to climb in the social scale. At one tine he aspired to be ^eman Consul in Muscat and he has also from time to time tried to ingratiate him- -self with this Agency, V« One of the date proves he bought proved afterwards to have a mortgage on it in favour of Bint Halima the widow of one Abdul la bin Mahomed al Khasri an Arab of C^uriyat, halima lodged her elaim and Habib opposed it. Whether the case was officially referred to Shara or not I do not know,there are no records of it ever having come to the Agency,and as the Shara court keeps no written records it is impossible to jirove or disprove any state- -msnt in this respect c Any way Shaikh Rashid the Minister of Jus tice and third member of the Council was applied to either in his public or private capacity by halima and her friends but apparently gave no decision, Habib states that Rashid pressed him for a bribe of twelve hundred dollars which he refused to give and consequently Rashid has always been hostile to him. On the other hand he seems to have tried to restore the balance by bribing Sayed Nadir with fifteen hundred dollars of rhich it is possible that Shaikh Zobeir the 4th member had a slice, X have not heard 1 ' iV 1 have not heard of the 2nd member, Say ed Mahomed bin h.a - ad, re- -ceiring anything but the positions/in the Council is that Saycd ^addr and Shaikh Zobeir arc on wabib's side and the other two are not, 8^ nabib has at least twice appealed to His Highness and he says that His Highness never gavt any decision in wliich|statsnent he is backed by his friends on the Council, .Both Shaikh Rash id and bayed aiahomed have infoimed me that His nighness did give a decision before he went to Dhofar but they differ as to its terms, I have written to His Highness asking for confirr .iation or denial of this and if X can extract anything definite out of him I propose to use that decision as a basis of settlement. 9c Habit also accuses Khan Bahadur Hasib bin Mahomed the Naval Contractor of interfering in his case before His Highness at the request of shaihh Rashid. Certainly Nasib invariably refers to Habib in very disparaging terns and ho is largely used as a co-betwesn in looal quarrels but I do not suspect him up to now of taking too lar,;e a part in this dispute, 10- I now cone to the part played by the Sfcfctildi of the Sani Battask. It appears the wo lan Halima is under his protection if not actually in his hoinie and I suspect that she has bribed him heavily to further her oase. Habib says he had no enmity with the Shaikh and was invited by the latter to pay him a friendly visit at Hcil,, He was received In a perfectly friendly fashion and it was not till the second day that the Sliailch suddenly ordered his follower# to seize Habib and his son and bind them on a camel and a donkey. There was no quarrel and no explanation was given. Habib and his son were taken to the Shaikh's hcad- -quarters and Habib himself was chained. It was not till several days later that the Shaikh's brother cane to him and said that Shaikh Sultan was about to kill him, Habib avers that he still did not know why and finally the brother told him that if he would agree to pay six thousand dollars he would request the Shaikh to release him, nabib had nc option to refuse but said he had no ready cash 0 Sha Sultan then seized the whole of^1. tl Habit's karTegt from iiis date croyes near Hail and took ^-on laJoi proniBBory note for the balance,-some four thousand dollars, 1 ', ich would fall due at the end of twelve months. Habib and his son trtere then allowed to go back to Hail and that night he sen* off the son to Muscat and himself broke aray tv/o days later,, habih makes cut this incident as a gross abuse of Arab hoepitalitj but I aa not prepared to accept in toto his ytrsion of the affc.ir, Xt seems that the jsani uattash tribe have been m c. state if not'tpen at least of passive reTolt for many years. This condition of affairs dates back to Bayed iurki• ■ heav^,- de- -feat of them 38 years a^o and the enmity thus engendered has nx made them ready at any time,where they could do so with safety, to defy the authority of the museat uOTernment, i have been bus^ the past few days searching my records in order to present a connected history of their attitude in the past thirty odd years but i find the course of events is difficult to follov f and j. m^st await the return of the Agency dragoman to enlighten me on various points. In Mr Wingate's necotiations with the Onanis in 1920-21 the uani .oat t ash figured largely and alt he ugh the muscat Government's hold over them has been shadowy for many years tney apparently admitted then that they were subjects of xiis xilstaiess^ bince then 4there have been disputes over minor matters in which Shaikh Isa bin Saleh of Oman has invariably intervened on be- -half of the tribe and there is little doubt that he is behind them on this occasion ,otherwi?e they would never have dared to fir® on the troops of the Museat Government, Shaikh Isa wrote in to the Council rather a rare thing for him to do as he gene- -rally uses this.Agency as a vehicle of correspondence)after Habib was released and offered his services as an intermediary but was told by the v/ouncil that it was no business of his as the Bani Battash were Muscat subjects. I hope to be able to furnish a full report shortly on this tribe and its relations with the muscat government and X shall also be able to gau^e ^ their present attitude from the nature of the Shaikh's reply to my letter. The whole question seems to be verjAnvolved and _frankly rather diffitult and for this reason I think it iu pro- -bahle that son© tin# will elapse 'before a settlement aan 'be made as it is necessary to proceed cautiously and avoid precipitate action. &amp;rrrujk jr** * The affair furnishes a striking example of the^laek of state srn an ship &gt;vip&gt;Awr^ of the council of Ministers indivi- -dually,their internal disensions and their inaptitude as a eorpo- -rate 'body end reinforces yery strongly the argument in favour of the early appointment of a European in an administrative eapa- -eity.

Sir, J ^ I have the honour to refer &gt;ou to my despatch No.38-C Of August 19th 1924 regarding the Hail incident and to report that on September 6th I had an interview with Shaikh Sultan of the Bani Battash at Kuriyat. 2, Before proceeding to describe this meeting I 'beg to draw your attention to paragraph 11 of the a'bove men- ~tioned despatch in which I indicated that I would endea- •'Tour to present a connected history of the relations 'between the Muscat Government and the Bani Battash since Sayed Turki's defeat of them 38 years ago. 3, There is no getting away from the fact that this trrbe have ever 'been notorious for their turbulent 'beha- -viour and matters apparently came to a head in 1386. Sayed Turki the then Sultan of Muscat succeeded in getting Mahomed 'bin Shams at that time Shaikh into Muscat anft killed him out of hand. The Bani Battash made a pretence of submitting and Sayed Turki went to Kuriyat to appoint a new Shaikh at their request. He was received in a hos- -tile fashion and returned to Muscat e The tri'be then loot- -ed Kuriyat and attacked the Wali*s fort 'but were repux^sed, Turki • s sons then took a force into the Bani 'Pattash country,cut down their date trees ancl looted anc. v uint alla they could. This strong action kept the trrbe gtuiet till the death of S &amp;yed Faisal in 1913 and the Omani rising of that year. All this time they had 'been paying their Zakat regularly 'but had not abstained from individual murders and rol^beries and they must have 'been nurturing revengeful feelings against Jrtie Muscat Grovernment for as soon as the Omanis attacked Barkah they descended on Kur- -yat and looted the village damaging two Hindu's shops very severely. Sayed Taimur sent his 'brother Sayed Hamad to Hail with a force and the tri*be caved in and sued for peace. Shaikh Khalaf 'bin Sinan of Yonghal and other minor Aral? Shaikhs intervened on their 'behalf and they promised to pay up the arrears of Zakat and 'behave 'better in the future# Sayed Taimur then forgave them and himself paid coopensa- -tion to the Hindu Baniiias for their losses. During the war they showed signs of restlessness again and used to raid right down to SidalD 1^ miles to the South East of Muscat; a detachment of the Indian regiment at Beit al FalaJ posted in the village prevented any danger to Muscat from that quarter and they gradually settled down again^ In 1922 Shaikh Sultan made an effort to let the Zakat of Hall itself (which is paid direct to the Muscat Grovernment and not through the Shaikh)paid into him and in order to do this succeeded in persuading Shaikh Isa 'bin Saleh to send a ftazi to Hail. On the Muscat G-overnment protesting this office wrote to Isa and the ^azi was removed. 4. it will 'be seen from the a'bove that the Bani Battash have ever tried to take advantage of Muscat's weak- -ness 'but have again and again acknowledged its suzerainty. When the late Tinancial Adviser visited Hail last year they were perfectly friendly to him and there was no sign of any coming outbreak: there were no indications also of any— -thing 'but friendliness towards the Sultan 'but I reaamber that Captain Alhan told me later that the Shaikh was dis- -satisfied with the Council of Ministers. 5. I come now to my visit to Kuryat. Unfortunately 1 r .% I only ha4 36 hours notice of B .i.m .S. -Lewrsnce's arrival g) i and although I sent off a aessenger post haste to Hail ■telling Shaikh Sultan to meet me at Kuryat I could get no answer in the time. However in order to give a little more notice I did not embark till the next afternoon Saturday September 6th and reached Kuryat at 6 ®.m. The ¥ali came off at once and gave me a letter from Shaikh Sultan in . answer to mine in which he said he preferred the meeting } to take place at Hail or at Dtghmar which is a collection of date trees about 3 miles Bast of Kuryat. I decided that 1/5 must get him to Kuryat and sent off the Agency Dragoman ^ and Khan Bahadur Nasih bin Mahomed at once to inform him i was waiting at Kuryat. They returned early the next morning with the news that the Shaikh would soac arrive in an hour or two.I sent off a polite message saying I e would land at 4 p a iD« e 6 I was met on the 'beach( after a landing in which | we all got very wet)by the Wali who conducted me to his Fort where I interviewed the Hindu merchants ol Kuryau j who begged for matters to be settled up as they were losiQ trade and shortly after proceeded to a houso x * garden some 200 yards further inland 0 The Shaikh was esta blished. in a mosque attached to this garden and had 'brought 'between 150 and 200 armed followers through whom i had to pass ft as soon as i was established in the house the Shaikh and two followers were shown in. 7. Shaikh Sultan is a mild looking man of 'between i 50 and 60: he is the son of the Shaikh who was murdered 'by Sayed Turki and struck me as 'being a good type of Aral . I plunged into 'business without any delay saying that 1 wished to hear his account of the incident®After a little shilly-shallying the Shaikh said the whole trouble was caused 'by Sayed Nadir 'bringing an army and forcing his way on in spite of warnings and without adequate notice. He said his Bedouins were difficult to control and opened fire before he had time to consider the situation. I1 bf@ 1 pointed out that Muscat Gov-ernment officials had a right j to go anywhere and with as large armed parties as they pleased and he countered this hy saying there was no trou- -'ble when Captain Alhan came with a small ^^r^y a-Q why could not Sayed Nadir do the same. It was the custom of the country. I pressed him as to whether he accepted responsi- -'hility for the •Bedouina' actions and after evading the point for some time he owned that he was responsible for them, p i then aslced him about Hati'b ^-in Dhanki and he said that matter was settled. I asked for details and he replied that the woman Haxirna nad a sood claim ty which I understood him to mean that the case had already 'been given in her favour Sayed Taimur. He said Hahih came to Hail and sent a messenger to Shaikh Isa m Oman to send a representative down to intervene 'between Hali ma and klmaelf. Isa sent a man and the case was settieff hy Hahit paying ^-1650 in cash and giving a promissory note for the 'balance ^.4S50. HahiH gave this willingly and departed. This incident had nothing to 'o with the firing on Sayefl- Nadir, 98 X informed the Shaikh that this version differed very considerably from the one I had heard and suggested that I could do little for him unless he was frank with me. Re stuck to his story and eventually I left that point I then reminded him that his men had committed a crime in firing on Sayed Nadir and his parlry who represented the Muscat Government. The Shaikh said it was a regrettable affair and he would write to the Council of Ministers u o espress his regrets. I said that would not he enough and pressed him to come to Muscat personally at* make his submission. He said he mistrusted the Muscat Governmont quoting his father's case 'but offered to return the camels and ammunition lost 'by Sayed Nadir*s party« I 'brought up the question of compensation for the two men killed and he countered with m a guery as to who was 1? r @) going to compensate him for the four men he had had killed. I said I had not heard that,'but if he -brought proofs they would 'be taken into account,! then returned to the subject of his coming in to Muscat. A long argument took place the upshot of which was that he would send in a representative within i6 days to Muscat and would hope to come himself after two months his o'bJect T)eing o'bviously to a^alt the return of the Sultan, This was the utmost I could get out of him short of using threats and it was just then that I received news that the wind and tide were x ising and that if we did not get off at once it would mean spending the night in Kuryato I therefore returned to the 'beach and. after a perilous Journey in the dark through the surf in which the whole party again got soaked to the skin reached the ••Lawrence' safely, 10o On the whole I look on the interview as satis- - factory. Of course the Shaikhs story of HalDiVs visit is a long way from the truth 'but we may also assume that Ha'bi'b's version lost nothing in the telling. There is little dou'bt that the Shaikh forced Hahrb hy some means or other to settle Halima's claim. The firing on Sayed Nadir*s party was of course the direct outcome of the latter*s threat at Hail wherehy he hoped to punish the Shaikh for his presumption in taking the law into his own hands 0 But the Shaikh is willing to restore the looted property and if handled carefully will t l a - come in and see His Highness the Sultan when he returns and malce submission. Eaually it is fairly clear wi^l not do so to the Council of Ministers unless compelled 'by force - a difficult operation, i , as regards the HaMTD-Halima case,I received Just 'before proceeding to Kuryat a letter from H.H.(of which I attach a copy)saying that he did make a settlement in the presence of 'both parties and this settlement is virtually in the same terms as the one forced 'by the Shaikh of u.ie Bani Battash. It is ohvious that His Highness's decisionmust stand ana Hatit 156 compelled finally to accept it.If this is done Shaikh Sultan can Jmrdly De Mamed for merely giving effect to his master's orders even if he used aues- -tionaDle means and his crime is automatically reduced to | his action against Sayed Nadir. Sayed Nadir, even though in the last resort he was atle to produce -he Council s authority,did not act originally on that or any authority •but can he considered to have proceeded to Hail in a private capacity and on his own initiative. Al^o with uhe exception of a small personal guard he was hardly entitled to use State troops without the Council's permission. It would seem therefore that he is entirely -o ^larae .01 hi own action and cannot eapect any redress. ^2^ I propose therefore (a)That when the Shaikh of the Bani Battash's re- -presentative appears I demand immediate restoration of the property lost.If he can prove that the Beouins lost four men I think the Council of Ministers should drop the claim for compensation of men killed and wounded as on the Muscat side. (h) That later when the date of the retain of His Highness is fixed that the Shaikh 'be reminded of his words at Kuryat and 'be informed that His Highness is | ready personally to receive his submission. (c) That Sayed Nadir he given a hint to take the leave he has already 'been granted,that he ^0 given to understand that his action has not been approved of and that the Sultan he revested to caution him against mixing himself as acting Head of the State in private matters 0 (d) That Hahih he forced to carry out the terms of His Highness 's settlement of the case - this merely means a reduction of ^.1000 on the promissory note j already given.That he he ordered to give security to he of good behaviour in the future and he he warned of His Highness's displeasure.There remains only the Council of Ministers to deal with. It seems to me that If the Minis^e^ s had 'been divided against themselves and had enforced settlement of Halima 's apparently Just claim there would have i.ee.i no reason for the Shaikh to interfere.I regard the Shaikh's action as a direct result of the negation of authority shown ^y them. This particular incident has thrown into clear relief their methods of work,their intrigues,their dissensions and their inability to cope with anything in the nature of an emergency.lt is not difficult to foretell that if they are left to rule in the way they have heen doing all semblance of His Highness's authority will dis- -appear not only in the outlying portions of the Sultanate hut even in the vicinity of Muscat. If His highness still continues unwilling to exercise executive authority himself then a leaven of the European element is necessary on the Council itself.in its present constitution it is rapidly 'becoming a danger to the State. I may say that on my return from Kuryat I gave the itinistea personally a full account of the interview and requested to 'be informed of their opinion and intentions as soon as possible. I have received no answer from them yet and pro- -sume that as usual they are unahle to agree.If they pro- -duce any statesmanlike solution of the affair I will com- -municate it immediately hut I cannot keep this despaten waiting any longer, I trust the ahove may meet with your approval and that I may he favoured with your instructions at an eKrl'' * i have the honour to he.

Muscat, the 4th October 19124* Sir, I have the honour to refsr you to iuy letter No# dated Karachi 9th !fciy regarding the position at sur. At that time I had not seen sur and cy information was based on office records and vague reports from the town itself; since then I have had an opportunity through the kindness of commander Garstin of the H .I .M .S# w Lawrence ,, of visiting sur and seeing for myself how matters stood. 2» Before I set out I knew there were tribal disturbances going on and that there was difficulty over the building of the new Custom house but I was not aware of the very uncompromising attitude taken up by Mohamed bin 'Nasir bin Abdullah of Beni Bi Ali the grandson of the late Amir of jaalan who is the head of that section of tribesmen occupying Heija (or East Sur) and the country behind it* I therefore was not prepared to take up the question of suzerainty but merely wished to ascertain whether the inter-section feuds of the Janebeh tribe were as bad as S. g. p. i.—247 p.

All parties of the Janebeh had now been forced to agree to the sheikh 's terms except one Khamis bin Mubarak a leading man of the Arameh section and the two sheikhs had given him till 5 hours AraJbic time that morning (i.e about 9*30 a .m.} to agree or have his house and property blown down, sulaiman understood that a was already in position and that Khamis following was roughly 50 armed men who were prepared to resist. A boat belonging to two relatives of Khamis had also been seized in the inner harbour by the Sheikhs who were using the possession of this as a further lever. 4® in order to avoid bloodshed I sent the dragoman ashore with Khan Bahadur TJasib with orders to bring Mohamed bin ^asir and i/Eansur on board at once. In the meanwhile the two relatives of Khasiis and Khamis himself arrived on board and were told to wait till after the arrival of the Sheikhs, presently the dragoman returned with Mohamed bin Uasir and another man who turned out to be a cousin of laansurs - the later Sheikh being afraid to venture on board a Man-0- war. i i \ ~ —Page 3. (5 ,0 I ln¥lt©d Mohaned 'bin Nasir to explain the local situation and he became very verbojpQ and excited» He said he was authorised by the MU-scat GoTernnent to settle all disputes in Sur and had succeeded in doing so with the exception of Kharais who was an unruly . creature and was out to ruin the whole settlement- rrhen aslccd to produce his authorisation he said he had it on shore and that if I would come off in the afternoon he would show it me# He denied that he had ever used force or intended to use force to Khamis and promised there would be no shooting, in the middle of this conversation the Tali was announced and in walked a small boy about 11 years old who said he was acting Wali as his father had gone on leave to Sib near Ti&amp;iscat* It was obviously hopeless to attempt to get the Government representative^ view out of him and he looked a pitiful little object in the middle of all this intrigae. He was therefore dismissed with a few kind words. Mohamed bin Nasir was then told that Khamis* story would be heard next and if he cared to wait I would give him another interview later but he excused himself as the day was getting hot and asked me to visit him In the evening at Heija - I agreed to this and then called in Khami s * 6. Khamis was in a terribly overwrought condition and it was only after about ten minutes weeping and sobbing that I could get a word out of him. His story was that two of his relatives had been killed and his honour demanded blood money or the nxirderers; that he could never lift up his head again if he was forced to submit to the i Sheikhs orders that the Mi scat Government hod promised him justice (he produced documents in support of this and also a copy of Sheikh zubairns settlement last year) and that few he was about to be killed with his^faithful followers. HeHe said the reminder of the Arameh trihe had been bribed to accept the Sheikh*8 ruling and that the sheikh himself had been bribed by the opposing section the Maka»eh and that altogether he was at his last gasp when the •♦Lawrence* arrived. I quitted him as well as I could and offered to take him to Muscat in the ••Lawrence** which offer he accepted after some hesitation. I then sent him ashore. 7 » At 4#-30 p.m. accompanied by Captain ISccles, the Director General of Customs and the dragoman I went into in the inner harbour in the 'Lawrence*s w motor boat. On passing the new Jaalan battery at Heija 3 guns were fired as a salute and Mohamed bin Nasir and Mansur with a following of about 200 armed tribesmen met on the beach. A We were conducted to the Sheikh's house and after the customary coffee, fruit and halwa I continued the interview with Mohamed bin Nasir. He produced his written authorisation to settle disputes and I found he had^ 1 considerably exceeded its provisions as it distinctly laid down that no force was to be used and ta any settlement was to be made by agreement* I pointed this out to him and he once again denied intending using any force and stated that Xhamis was a very bad character. He strongly objected to my taking Khamis to J&amp;iscat as it would be an indignity to him and promised not to harm Khamis in any way nor to force a settlement on him against his will. He also said Khamis was free to go to Mi scat in a small boat at any time if he wished to but protested against his going in the 'Lawrence*. On receiving these assurances and as Mohamed bin Fasir appeared to be getting rather neated about it I agreed to leave Khamis in Sur. 3* I then enquired how it was I had received news that the sheikh did not permit the new Custom house at Sur to be built. Mohamed bin Kasir became eVasiv# and 3ai&lt;l nothing had ever been settled about it, finally' „ uiiiii i wwii Page 5® f*f\ finally den^ying that he had ever agreed to its 'being built and that he never would agree. He went on to say that the right of His Highness to collect custoaa in Sur and HsiJa had never 'been recognised by his forbears himself and his tribe. I pointed out that the Sultan*s rights as regards customs were recognised in the Treaty of 1891 and the Sheikh retorted that he knew nothing of that and that he was not subject to the mi scat Governments orders as regards customs, and he looked to the BritiskGovern nent l to maintain his rights; as this attitude rather took me by surprise I was not prepared to argue the point nor did the occasion seem suitable so I dropped the subject# i then referred to a complaint I had had from the Hi^du merchants regarding the closing of the inland route from Sur^ The Sheikh said the roud had been closed for political reasons and in order to punish the Hijriyin who lived on it. He hoped the matter would be settled soon and would do his best to reopen trade along that route. 10. I then made my adieux,proceeded to the motor boat and went up the Khor to the back of Sur proper - I landed behind the town and walked across to the sea shore a distance of about a mile. It was getting da$rk and evidently the warfing aections were just mounting the evening guards. The streets were deserted except for occasional parties of ii ten or a dozen armed men each of whom accompanied us a short distance and then gave way to a new p-^rty as soon one appeared in sight. The Ghiyalin quarter was more peaceful but apparently every one had to be indoors by dusk, i visited the Hindus who were well housed in strong buildings and they told me they hn.d to pay blackmail to the various tribes in order to avoid being looted otherwise they had no complaints of the way they were treated. 11. While talking to them I asked whether it would be worth while the British India steamers calling atpa^e 6. calling at intervals and after some discussion I came to the conclusion that during the date season there ^ould be once sufficient inducement for the mail to Karachi to call/a fortnight: also that the mail from India might call once a month the vvhole year round and have a reasonable chance of covering the extra expense involved* I was warned by the Director-General of Customs that there would be considerable ppposition to this at first on the part of the Arab merchants who were also largely dhow owners or who had chares in the dhows - I think though that this would melt away T^ien the trading community bjPgin to realise the advantage of a reeMlar steamer service* 12* Ey this time it was getting late and I rejoined the ^Lawrence* - Khamis was on board and was told I could not take him to Muscat* He accepted the decision quite calmly and was pleased to hear I had arranged with the 3heikh that no force would be used against him - The 'Lawrence' left later on in the evening and arrived at Muscat the next morning* 13 # The Director-General of customs informs me that the customs receipts from 3ur are very poor - a mere fraction of what they ought to be and that the Amirs of Jaalan claim free import into the town of Heija on the grounds of right and also ( evidently alternatively ) of His Highness having granted this privilege^ last year - The Director-General says that His Highness did grant Mohamed bin Nasir exemption from customs for his own dhow but that was all* 14» Since the above was written I have received information that Sheikh Ali hin Abdulla uncle of Mohamed bin Hasir with 400 men has captured a date caravan valued at dollars 20,000/- belonging to the Hyjiryin ( with whom the Beni bu Ali are at feud) which was being brought into Sur by the Beni Rasib a tribe living between the Hyjiryin country and sur - The caravan has been taken to Heija and@ Page 7» and presumably the dates will be shipped away without the customs being able to colleot the 5 % export duty* This is typical of the methods of the Eeni ax Bu Ali and of their present attitude. 15• The above shov/s the state that sur is in : the sheikhs of the Jaalan tribes openly flouting the Ifusoat Government and claiming what amounts to complete independence ; claiming further the right to deal with neighbouring tribes by force and the right to settle intertribal disputes of other tribes by force: claiming in fact the right to rule in sur and to pay no customs or other taxes - I understand these claims have been advanced at various times and with varying degrees of ardour for the last three years but they have not up till now reached such an acute sta^e - Last winter Sheikh % Mohamed bin Kasir stayed for some time in j&amp;iscat os the guest of His Highness who gave him many interviews but I have no official knowledge of what passed between them* 16# on my return to HAiscat from Sur I informed the Council of Ministers of what I had seen and heard and asked them whether they proposed to t ^ke any action - They desired time to discuss the matter and promised to let me know their ideas shortly# Since then, although reminding them frequently they have not furnished me with any expression of opinion on the subject but two days ago the Minister of pinance informed me that the Council has written to His Highness enquiring what has to be done. In other words the Council of ministers has no proposals to make. 17* I presume I am correct in assuring that the Government of India would not countenance the breaking away from in scat of the Sheikhs of Jaalan and also that it would be possible when it is decided to take action to secure the assistance of one of His Jtojesty's ships.itIt Beems to me that a sharp leeson is needed to re-eetat11 eh the Muscat Government^authority in sur and ensure the collection of customs and Za3cat. Bit it would be useless to administer that lesson unless arrangements are made to maintain permanently the authority of the Central Government To do this it will be necessary to place a garrison of Muscat troops at Sur and adequately administer and maintain them and this the Government are hardly in a position to do at the moment. The question of maintenance and the upkeep of proper communication 'betv/een LUscat and sur is bound up with the question of the acquisition of a suitable vessel by l&amp;iscat State and the problem of ways and means of securing this desirable end have been occupying my attention ever since my arrival here. Finally I may remark that Sur is most vulnerable from about the end of March till August as it is then that all the Sur ovmed dhows to the number of about 80 are in harbour. IB. in conclusion I beg to request that I may be and instructions favoured with your views^on the whole subject. I have the honour to be.

Said bin bultan al maliki accordingly sold the eighteen .baiirs to the Hindus Jairam and Kamu i.e.KhimJi Hamdas &amp; Jo in his A. own name and admits having received full payment for them. Ali bin Rashid al Hakmani having received part payment for his dates departed to his home. Apparently, howver,Ali bin Rashid did not receive full payment from Said bin Sultan and also he was dissatisfied with the low price his dates had fetched,so he returned and filed a suit with the Wall of Sur against the Hindus Jairam aia ^amu » rfor the recorery of his nine Bahrs of dates. The Hindus when summoned stated that they had nerer had any dealings with Ali bin Rashid al naloaani neither did they know him, but that they had bought eighteen iiahars of dates from Said bin Sultan al Maliki of which nine aahars were old and inferior,short weight, they had paid %aid Said bin aultan in full,deducting somewhat from the price of the nine inferior _ aiars. Said bin Sultan al Maliki when summoned admitted the claim and stated that he was ready to settle accounts with All bin Rashid al tiakmani on the spot.They therefore sat down and worked out the account in front of the Wall settling finally that Said bin Sultan al Jialikl should pay Ali bin Hashid al uaknani a.450. Ali bin Rashid al Hakmani then asked that this money be paid to him so that he could buy back the dates from the Hindus ( and resell themj» All three parties i.e.Hindus,Said t)in Sultan ana All bin Hashid agreed upon this settlement and left the Court. Said bin Sultan al Maliki then went bankrupt and apparently could not pay his debt. Ali bin Rashid al Hakmani also could not produce his share so he came back to the all a..a nied a suit against the Hindus for the recorery of the dates without offering to return their price# The Wali then referred the matter to the or:ara oourt w-.ere a final disagreement took place between the parties,the nakioani stating that he could produce witnesses to the fact of the dates 'belonging to him and demanding that the Hindus should take an oath that the dates belonged to them,this they refused to do saying that they could produce witnesses instead# The Hakmani disagreed to this and the parties separated learing the matter unsettled# I have interwtJrtT the Hindu Mamu of Khimji Ramdas &amp; Co. r who was a participator in the whole affair and he co^oborates the aboTe narratiTe of the Wall of Sur so that it appears to be a fair and just statement of the case. The following points appear to be clear;-I gd fl J 1» The Hataiani must have known that his dates were under (X/rd- weight and inferior in quality^knowing that Baid bin Sultan was a regular custoner of ^aadas ^ ~o, he hoped they would pass among the nine good , ^.ars without ooament. 2. As these caael-men do not actually possess dates them- -selTes hut are gixen certain (quantities hy owners of gardens with instructions to sell in aur ana bring hack the price, it seema clear that the nijryin sellers must hare pressed the Hakmani for payment, thus forcing him to do sometHing desperate# 3» iiaTing dealt throusliout with baid bin oultan al who also admitted receiTing payment from the Hindus, the matter lay entirely between him and Said bin Sultan. 4. The Hindus had very kindly agreed to let him haTe back hie dates on return of the price but as he could not produce this price he had no right to consider himself the aggriered party* 5, The whole affair is in keeping with the shiftless character of the Wali,Said Hamud bin llilal,who having settled the affair once, allowed the whole i..atter to e reopened on a manifestly unfair basis. The Hindu tells me also that in addition to the above two trials,he was called upon a third time to appear before Shaikh liahoamed bin xtasir of - aalaa,who considers himself a power in Sur .Shaikh nahommed told the Hindu that he had better return the dates for less than he gave for them or to compromise in some other way with the Hakmani which advice the Hindu quite rightly ignored* The foregoing merely shows that outsiders such ae Shaikh xiohammed Jaalani and latterly ^uaiKh ^ansur^are allowed to come to Sur^try cases which are in trie juris- -diction of the Wali t and pass orders on them without any remonstrance on the V/ali's part* r6» As regards punitirt actional asked the Muscat CrOTern- -ment to adTls« me on this point hut they are unable to suggest anything better than to order the Wali to lay hands on the offenders wheneyer they should reappear in Sur which merely means that the offenders would go unr -caught and unpunished# t The only feasable way of getting any satisfaction would be to compel Shaikh Mohammed bin Aasir Shaikh of Jaalan to bring the offenders to book^ thing which he could easily do since the al Hakman tribe is a sub difl- -sion of the Jaalan# The Shaikh himself is of course open to persuasion as his sea port j is at Aeger (diTided from Sur by the AhoiJ where may be found a good number of large dhows belonging to Jaalanis and also his priTate residence and fort.When the monsoon abates of course the dhows will all be leaving with cargoes of dates* 7® The following explanation may be of use:» 1# The uakman is a sub division of the Jaalan and lire about 15 miles from Sur in the hills# 2# Th^HaggerinCHiJryinjare also a portion of the Jaalar \ living further inland# 3# A Uahar is 200 Muscat! maunds# 8# I regret the excessive delay in forwarding this report, I called for a report from the muscat CJovernment on re- -ceiving your letter^but although Shaikh Rashid had just returned from Sur after investigating the matter,a fresh report had to be called for from the Wali of Sur# This arrived the other day but was so incomplete as to render it difficult to understand^a third report has now been called for by the Muscat Government# As I could not wait any longer however I have ex- -tracted this present account and should the Wall's letter contain any fresh details or corrections I will immediately forward them to you# 9# The Financial Adviser has arranged to refund the dft •&gt; i //« I amount of tJie ransoxu© paid toy tho British subjects at t&gt;ur for the release of the kidnapped Hindu# I shall inform you on receipt of this amount® I hare the honour to 'be.

I wrote to shaikh Kashid asking him to inform me of the truth of the matter and he answered as follows 11 and these people who are approaching bhaikh Isa bin baleh (from Dubai via bib and r/adi Semail) are the sons of uata bin bunail who v/as anaikh of Dubai before the present Shaikh,Said bin Maktum.They have with them about 15 men and one horse,a present for Shaikh isa,and are go^i.g to consult with Isa and the Omani tribes over the threats uttered by Ibn Jalui 'sllbn Saud^ agent in KassaMessenger in Bereimi which said that that Ibn Saud was intending to send an army of horse and foot against Oman# rhe bhaikh of Dubai and isa uin Saleh attach importance to tnis threat of Ibn Saud's'. This is all that Shaikh Rashid knows,but from other sources it appears that the Omanis will probably try to occupyJ3ereimi which may cause trouble with those tribes who sltm nav € already paid tribute to I'bn Saud* Hasib has written on my behalf to Isa bin Saleh a; ^-ng what his plans are,I expect the answer in a few days. ^ The weather is beautifully cool here and we have had no discomfort from the heat* Eccles sends his salaams. tzg. an -c^ i l: U To Lieut.Col#C# G.

I have already addressed Foreign about your posting and the answer should come in early September, if not before. I can scarcely believe that ibn Baud intends to attack Oman, but I am writing to ! allam to find out whether there is any talk in Hasa about any such movement. In any ^ V case, you should try to keep Muscat State out of any intrigues, as I imagine that the Government of India would not allow Ibn Saud to encroach upon any port on the littoral east of Cape Masandam. As regards the Wali of Sur it would be best to await the return of His Highness before replacing him. However, if matters are even worse than usual, you may find it necessary to countenance another man being appointed. Homer is writing to you about some letters Thomas addressed to Sir A. T. Wilson under flying seal through me. I am astounded at lliomas entering into this correspondence, in great part about political matters, direct with outsiders, and thus short-circuiting the Political Agent. The truth probably is that Thomas has been in Government service in positions analogous to Political Agent and is now apt to forget his own place in the scheme of things. Thomas writes that the dining room floor is being re-laid, and 1 hope the dining room walls and drawing room walls are receiving attention. It is bad luck on you having the house topsy turvy during your time. u/f G• Alban, I.A., Political Agent, Muscat.50TB• #i , 1 am very much obligad to Captain AXban, Political Agent, Muscat , for his very clear and able report, dated the 2eth July 1926, regarding tho kidnapping of the Hindu, Kersandas Lalji, at Bur. 1 would pass my orders on this matter now ercept for the following reasons (1) I mentioned this case to the Political Resident at Fujairah in April last. Colonel i ^rideaux did not appear to Ci prepared to take action in the matter at once as he was doubt- -ful whether the conduct of the nindu^r the Hindu's firm^in regard to financial transactions with the accused Arab was above suspicion. He desired me to make further enquiries* (2) Any action that may be taken would require the presence of one of H.M's, r&gt;hipB of war as the Muscat Government will not be in possession of a suitable vessel during the coming cold weather. I will however note here the action which 1 consider desirable* The Political Agent, Muscat, should address Shaikh Mohammed bin liasir cf Jaalan a letter briefly detailing the facts of this kidnapping of a British subject; he should point out the enormity of the offence; he should inform the Shaikh that Dollars 816 had been paid as ransom money although it was clearly proved that the Hindu firm had treated the accused Arab with the greatest liberality. He should then demand that Dollars 815 plus dollars 500 compensation should immed- -iately be remitted through the Muscat Government for re-pay» -ment to the Hindu concerned. Should Shaikh Shammed Jaalani hesitate to comply with this order the Senior Haval Officer, Persian Gulf, should be atked to detail one of H.M's. Ships to proceed to Sur, seize dhows belonging to Shaikh Uohammed Jaalani or his tribesmen2 tribesmen of the yalue of the money to be recovered and tow the same to Muscat Harbour.

' T • Reference diary entry Ho#172 dated the 3rd September 1925 concerning the trouble at Swaiq I am not in a position to give you any news# I have been waiting for letters from Shaikh RashiS bin Uzaiz who probably arrived there couple of days ago. The quarrel of the Yal Saad is with the Wali alone who has been behaving for the last 3 years with great opporession towards these people* Knowing that the Yal Saad is about the most power- —ful tribe we have to deal with in the State it*seemed good to me on hearing first rumour of trouble to write urgently to the a Council of Ministers requesting them to meet at once and con- -sider the situation# This was done in the presence of Mr .Thomas and the Dragoman and as a result Shaikh Rashid bin Uzaiz depart ed shortly after for Swaiq with powers to dismiss the Wall should he be found to blame. As you are doubtless aware the Yal Saad have given the State and the British Government a great deal of trouble in the past and any delay in coming to an agree- -ment with them might have been followed by very disagreeable consequences. I shall probably receive news from bhaiici Rashid any day now. When it comes I shall hasten to transmit it to you. * t( - * o'- r ii m Cu /7 Captain^ ryj Political Agent and H.B.M's Consul^Muscat.
