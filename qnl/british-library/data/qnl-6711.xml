This document is the property of the Secretary of State for India. Aden Policy. Notes by Sir W. Lee-Warner and Sir Hugh Barnes on Govern ment of India’s Letter, No. 119, dated 9th August 1906 (Pol. No. 1455/06). 1. The predominant issues seem to be— 1st. Has the policy advocated by the Government of India and condemned by His Majesty’s Government led to an increase of troops at Aden; and must it continue to require this ? 2nd. Has it, and must it lead to increased and increasing inter ference in the Hinterland ? 3rd. Is the retention of a Hill Sanatorium essential for the health of the indispensable garrison of Aden ? 4th. Is the extension of railways politically or commercially desirable ? I. and II. may be considered together. 2. The Government of India show conclusively that their policy will require a larger garrison than Aden required during the last century. The demarcation “ led to the despatch of the remainder of the British battalion and an extra native infantry regiment to Aden ” paragraph 10. These troops owing to the troubles in the Yemen have been located at D’thala.” The Government of India have never shown how those distant and chronic troubles made this location necessary, and the argument if admitted would lead to still further increases; for the religious conflict there is permanent. There are other reasons assigned for their permanent retention there; our protectorate treaty is said to require their presence, since “ our vacation of D’thala would result in the Amir leaving the district ” and taking refuge in Aden “ as his position would become untenable.” Why untenable ? ISot only because of the Turks, but as General De Brath writes paragraph 6. i., .. the moral support” of our troops “will in time overcome the reluctance (of the tribesmen) to accept the Amirs suzerainty. So, forget ul of Afghanistan, we are to employ British troops to coerce the Amirs '^Worse than this, there is a wider circle of responsibilities which the presence of our troops is creating now after 67 years of peaceful lio d o Aden In the country of the Yafai, and the confederacy of Juban, Nawa, ll Dabiani, ” Turkish ascendency would follow on Turkish intrigue if we withdraw. A S. 2(3.2 Again, “ the furtherance of the Pan-Islamitic programme in Yemen,” says the Resident, would result. So we are to check that natural and continuous movement. And, finally, nearer Aden, “ the Chiefs constantly appeal to us for friendly advice in the settlement of tribal disputes.” The nearer we are to these Chiefs the more frequent will be their appeals to us. In short, we are to embark on an entirely new policy outside the fortress of Aden, which will require an Agent and more troops in order to maintain an unpopular Amir on his throne, to combat a Pan-Islamitic programme in Yemen, to settle tribal disputes, and maintain “our reputation among the Arabs,” paragraph 12 of the Government of India’s letter. At a time when we have barely troops enough for the most essential purposes, is it wise to begin a new policy in South Arabia which will involve such large demands on our strength ? Then as regards the political interference, we must not overlook the contrast between Aden under a soldier who has never had any previous political experience, and the North-Western Frontier. On the North-Western Frontier picked political officers are controlled and educated. At Aden very junior ofiBcers are under the control of the Brigadier, and there is no one to check the natural tendency of interfering. The reports just received show conclusively that the local officers and the Government of India contemplate the need “ to promptly repress at its start any movement which promises to be dangerous,” whereas our experienced officers on the North-Western Frontier have in the last few days allowed Badshah Khan, and his brother, and the Dir Khans to fight and settle their own disputes. We have not the machinery at Aden for teaching our politicals when not to interfere, and our success in the last century, was due to keeping them at Aden out of the way of interference. Finahy, we must enquire what all this interference will involve in the way of expense. In 1901-02 political agencies cost Rs. 229,461, and in 1904-05 Rs. 302,014, while political pensions rose from Rs. 62,000 to Rs. 73,775. Military rose from Rs. 2,016,857 to Rs. 3,854,091. * These figures aie taken from the annual report and may he incorrect j but they suggest enquiry. III. 3. The Government of India consider it an increase of strength to Aden to have a garrison at Dthala, 95 miles distant, because— i. Aden is unhealthy. ii. Troops cannot be trained in Aden. hi. The concentration of naval forces in European waters might leave “ the comman d of the Arabian seas in foreign hands,” and our communications with the Hinterland would be needed for supplies. iv. We can better control the arms trade by plunging into the interior These arguments seem to me very inconclusive. As to the health of Aden the Government of India produce no figures, while the administration reports tell another tale. The Aden report for 1904-053 says “ the general health of the civil population at Tawahi and Maala is reported to have been good.’ r Jhe European General Hospital’s figures were for daily average attendance :— Sick. 1904-05. 1903-04. 1901-02. In patients 103 1.5*5 Percentage not given, but the number of patients 3,182 ex- Out door patients 391 40-05 needed that of 3,120 in 1904-05. The impression left on me in looking over the reports, is that the native troops were more unhealthy at D’thala than at Aden, and the Europeans rather healthier at Aden last year than in previous years. The admissions of natives into hospital considering the strength, 670 men, were the highest for years, while there were only 906 cases of Europeans admitted out of a strength of 1,367« The European death-rate was higher but not so high as in 1898. These figures, however, require scrutiny, as some deaths may be due to active service; but, after all, compared with the so-called healthy station of Poona, the death-rate at Aden calls for no special remark. With a reduction of the Aden garrison to its former strength an improvement should occur. ii. As regards the training of troops at Aden, no complaints used to be made, since the country between the rock and Sheikh Othman is perfectly flat. If the garrison were reduced to its former numbers, which were considered sufficient for the fortress, there should be no difficulty in training them. This however is a military question. iii. As regards the Naval policy of the Admiralty and the need for communication with the interior, the argument seems almost desperate. But at any rate if we were at peace with Turkey there would be no need for a garrison at D’thala, and if we were at war a thousand men there would not secure us the supplies needed. iv. As to the arms traffic, it is certain that a garrison at D’thala can have no manner of influence upon the trade considering the long line of frontier and. the Turkish landing places at Sheikh Said and north of it Experience has proved that we cannot check the arms traffic without an honest international agreement, and that we can secure neither in the Persian Gulf nor in the Red Sea. IV. 4. There remains the question of the Sultan of Abdali s railway. Our hands have been somewhat forced in this. The Abdali Sultan is very poor, and could never have thought of a railway unless it had been suggested to him. It is, however, certain that unless we allow it to run to the port of Aden no one will dream of making it. We have nothing to gain tmd much to lose by giving such a permission. If ever we were obliged to defend Aden in a war in which Turkey was against us, the railway might possibly even help our enemies. The argument of trade is surely a weak one. The4 imports into Aden by land, and our exports from it by land, are shown * Imports Exports 29,71,897 15,07,829 31,87,070 11,88,859 37,94,312 11,62,176 30,05,061 22,70,913 29,10,400 15,43,814 With civil war and deserts in South Arabia, we need not run certain risks in political administration to secure an uncertain trade which, as regards coffee, skins, and tobacco, has fallen into better hands elsewhere, an brings India more proiit, and as regards the clothing and feeding of the Arabs must grow less with civil war. This railway project was never even discussed when trade was thriving m the last century, and the fortress and settlement of Aden were the mam care of the Resident. It was pushed forward with feverish haste and without reference to the Secretary of State only when the redundant garrison was sent out to D’thala, and the means of getting the troops back quickly to their proper duties was therefore required. The Secretary of State has never sanctioned the extension of any Abdali line into the British territory at Aden, and without that sanction the project must die a natural death. We have therefore the remedy in our own hands. 5. The Government of India raise a number of other controversies which only confuse the main issue. That issue is whether the ascertainment of the exact boundary of our protectorate and the Turks’ agreement to it requires a departure from the sound policy previously pursued of leaving the tribes to choose their own rulers and settle their own affairs. It is said that we have given them protection. But obviously such protection means against Turkish or foreign invasion, and nothing more. We can only aggravate our difficulties by planting troops a hundred miles from the sea on the luikish frontier, seeming to menace the holy cities, and offering hostages to the pioneers of the Islamitic movement. Whether Aden should be governed from London, or as it used to be by the Bombay Government by means of a Resident chosen by the Bombay Government, is a separate question. By law A len is part of the Presidency of Bombay, and as long as the Bombay Government selected its own Resident it kept the settlement in order. The change began when the Government of India selected the Resident without arrangement with the Bombay Government. A reversion to the former system seems highly desirable. Whether we can possibly control the arms traffic when the whole coast of the Red Sea is open to their importation ; or whether the protected tribes should be ruled by a Sovereign or a number of tribal Chiefs; these are old standing questions which have been discussed for 20 years. But they have nothing to do with the main immediate issue whether we should add to our other burdens an Arabian question, and plant a garrison, not to defend Aden by sea, but to stem the tide of Islanrsm in Yemen. For such a policy we have, I think, neither troops nor money, and, if once the troops are with-(5 where I thought the Despatch went too far. But in the end I decided to wait till the Government of India’s reply was received. I am glad, therefore, to have this opportunity of stating my views. I take no exception to the general warning contained in the Despatch to he cautious, and to refrain from extending our responsibilities and from interfering with the domestic affairs of the tribes. Not that I think that the Government of India have ever had any desire to annex, or administer, or to interfere unnecessarily with the tribal g wernment. But local officers are sometimes inexperienced and occasionally indiscreet, and even the Foreign Department may sometimes be inclined to make too much of trifles. Such warnings, therefore, as the Despatch contains are always useful and tend to keep the supervision of the Government of India alert and vigilant. But the specific orders given in the Despatch seemed to me to be too positive, and I think the apprehensions, on which they were based, have been exaggerated. In the first place the demarcation with Turkey of the boundary of our sphere of influence had no connection with any so-called forward policy. I was the Indian Foreign Secretary at the time, and I was not conscious of any desire on the part of the Government of India to extend our respon sibilities or to increase the measure of our interference. On the contrary it was hoped that the demarcation would reduce our responsibilities bv freeing us from the anxiety and the risk of frequent disputes, and of possible conflict, with the Turks. In the circumstances of the time, the demarcation was a measure of simple necessity if we were to retain any sphere of influence at all, and I regard its successful accomplishment as a very valuable political achievement. It is the latest application of a policy which the Government of India has successfully pursued on many points of the Indian frontier for the past 30 years, the policy, wherever practicable, of fixing a limit both to their own ambitions and to the encroachments of aggressive neighbours, by laying down treaty boundaries. Thus we fixed the boundary of Persia and Baluchistan in 1872, of Russia and Afghanistan in 1885, of ourselves and Afghanistan in 1896, of Tibet in 1891, and of Burma and China by the Conventions of 1894 and 1897. At any rate, the Aden demarcation is now an accomplished fact. It is clear from their Despatch that the Government of India fully accept the view that ordinarily questions of trespass across it by the Turks should be settled by way of Constantinople. They also assert that they cordially subscribe to the view of Lord Lansdowne and of His Majesty’s present Government that there is to be no increase of interference with the internal and domestic affairs of the tribes It seems to me, therefore, that the only question at issue is the best method of dealing with the Chiefs and the tribes, in order to carry out this policy with due regard to Treaty obligations, and with the least risk of ow, short of annexation, or administration in some form without annexation which no one desires, there are two methods of dealing with frontier tribes m a position similar to that of the Aden tribes There is the policy of absolute or almost absolute non-interference. That is the policy which was pursued for nearly 60 years on the Punjab frontier with the result as once described by Lord Lytton in a famous Despatch, that we re orced into constant punitive expeditions, and that no British officer’s i e was safe a mile beyond our own frontier. The other is the policy of %riendly intercourse and co-operation with the Chiefs and Headmen, of gmng them support by the grant of small subsidies, of interfering not at V ', mana ^ ement of the tribe, while endeavouring to prevent intertribal fighting by tendering cur good offices in the settlement of inter- n )a quanels. That is the policy which in Baluchistan, while preserving t ic autonomy of the tribes, has replaced chaos by peace, order, and prosperity. Ihere has been a battle royal between these two policies on the I ndian frontier for the past^ thirty years. The latter has won the day, and has been successfully applied on the northern frontier, in Hunza, Nagar, I)ir, Swat, and Chitral, while it was the hope of its successful application, so far as possible, on the Punjab frontier, that led to the formation of the Punjab frontier Province. I speak with knowledge, for after fighting the battle of the policies on the frontier I was able to watch its progress from the Foreign Department under three successive Viceroys. It is the latter policy which the Government of India are adopting in the Aden Hinterland. To my mind there is no question of its superiority to the other policy provided it is properly supervised. We have object lessons in the results of both all along the Indian frontier. Twenty years of the one means no progress, but rather retrogression, for meanwhile the tribes become better armed and more unruly. Twenty years of the other means the growth of a new and more settled generation disinclined to fight, and accustomed to peaceful pursuits. The Aden Hinterland is especially well suited for the application of the latter policy, for, as in Baluchistan, the people have an aristocratic form of government and obey their Chiefs. The area, too, of the country is small, while the population is sparse and very easily controlled. In fact, compared with the difficulties we have suc cessfully accomplished elsewhere, the problem at Aden seems to be a simple one. We have a fairly quiet people to deal with, and have Treaty relations with their Chiefs, who are in our pay. Our objects are to encourage good government, to keep open the trade routes, to discourage intertribal quarrels, to control the arms trade by pressure on the Chiefs, to prevent raids across the frontier, and to keep in friendly relations with the local Turkish officials across the border. For the rest, the tribes should be left to govern themselves. While, therefore, reiterating the importance of interfering as little as possible, I w T ould allow the Government of India to continue their present policy and, at any rate for the present, to keep their Political Officer and the troops at D’thala. Otherwise, as experience else where teaches us is probable, we may bring about the very position we desire to avoid, and be foTTGd into punitive expeditions to put down tribal disorder. The expeditions no doubt would not be serious ones, for the Aden tribes are not formidable. There is no comparison between Afghanistan and D’thala, and very little analogy, it seems to me, between Somaliland and the comparatively settled country round Aden. But expeditions are to be avoided, if possible, and I think we are far more likely to avoid them by continuing our present policy than by withdrawing altogether from the Hinterland. As to the proposed railway to Nobat Dakin, I would treat the Abdali Sultan with perfect frankness. We don’t want the line; but if he wants it and is prepared to pay for it I would not throw obstacles in the way. The Sultan probably knows little about the cost of constructing railways and of their upkeep. I would offer him the best advice we can give him. If our8 experts, after examination, consider it would not pay, we should place the fi-ures before the Sultan and strongly discourage its construction. He is likely readily to acquiesce if he is convinced he will loose by it. If, on the other hand, it will pay, and the Sultan can find the money, I would let him make it, and allow it to run into Aden. This is a very hurried note, and I intended to rewrite and amplify it. But as I understand Mr. Morley wishes to see it at once I send it on as it is. Since it was written I have seen Sir W. Lee-Warner’s draft Despatch. I am afraid I cannot concur in it. I demur altogether to his view that affairs in the Aden Hinterland were quieter before the demarcation than they are now. It is only necessary to read the account of Aden in Aitchisons Treaties to see that in the past we have constantly interfered to settle tribal disputes, and often by force. If the orders which it is now proposed to give were strictly carried out, the local authorities would never be able to interfere at all. But that is an attitude which, in practice, I believe it will be quite impossible to maintainT Constant exceptions will be forced upon us, and in the end the sum of our interferences will be at least as great under the new as under the existing system, while our relations with the tribes will be hostile instead of friendly. My main point is that we ought not to forbid, as I understand the Despatch of 4th May did forbid, even the limited amount of interference and control which expe rience shows us we have usefully exercised in the past. If it is now clearly stated that this is not intended, much of my objection to the Despatch disappears. I have no wish to see a railway made to D thala. If Turkish intrigue, encroachment, or interference on our side of the border did not exist, or could otherwise be effectually prevented, I should not be sorry to see the Political Officer withdrawn from D’thala. But in the interests of the trade of Aden, and the supplies of Aden, for our own good name and because of our Treaty obligations there are, it seems to me, two things we cannot allow within our sphere, viz., anarchy, that is, serious intertribal disorder, and foreign interference. To prevent the first, some measure of interference—at least as much as we have exercised in the past— is essential; to prevent the second, it looks as if for a time at any rate it was necessary to keep an officer at D’thala. If we judge by the past, the Turks are sure to intrigue if they can, and it seems to me that the irritation between us and the Turkish Government is likely to be much less if border matters are quietly settled on the spot without reference to them than if with imperfect information we are constantly making ineffectual protests at Constantinople. Without therefore agreeing in all the arguments of the Government of India, some of which, such as their reference to a possible independent Arabia, and to the need for checking Pan-Islamic propaganda, appear to me to be far fetched and irrelevant, I am in favour of leaving the Political Officer in D’thala for the present, and I do not like leaving him there without troops. I would also make it clear that there is no intention of prohibiting such limited interference as the Residents have successfully exercised in the past to keep open the trade routes and adjust intertribal quarrels.
