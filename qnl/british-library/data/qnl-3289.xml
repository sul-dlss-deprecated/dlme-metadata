Refeiencfc your “my“ I beg to report that on the night of the 17th October 1945 at about 11 p.m. Shaikh Rachid bin Sai'd of Dubai proceeded from Dubai by car to Khaur Ghanadhah. He was accompanied by his cousins, Shaikhs Obaid, Faktum and H anad sons of Juna»h and Tr uhamma' bin Hashur. At the same time about three launches and six jollyboats carrying armed men, food supplies, empty sacks, tents, cements, juss etc left Dubai for Ghanadhah. 2. In order to examine the situation personally I went myself to Ghanadhah by car this morning *nd met Shaikh Rashid there. I asked him to let me know what he proposed to do at Ghanadhah. He said that he considered Ghanadhah as part of Dubai territory and that he was going to build two towers there, one on each side of the creek, for its protection. That his negligence to do so before wns due to the fact that he was weak and that he is now strong enough to do so and to foil any opposition by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi That he had obtained his father’s approval to what he is going to do now prior to his departure to Miscat. 3. ^he following is a description of what I had seen there:- Five tents were pitch^^jJ^ie western and one on the eastern side of Ghanadhah creek. Three Dubai flags-were planted on the western side of the creek and^^^^^he eastern side. One S. 44.3 - 2 - bundles of emptysaclcs were piled there read^/ for use. There were two huge*wooden tanks containing drinking water brought from Dubai by dhows and supplies of rice, dates, flour etc were stocked on both sides of the creek. The building material had not arrived by the time I was there but I was told that it was on the way and therefore no building had yet been started. I had seen one launch « and 5 jollyboats at anchor; some had already discharged their cargo and others were in the course of discharging. I estimate Rashid T s force at 400 armed men but T have reliable information that he kept a large number of bedouins ready nearby in case of On my way back T met a group of about 20 bedouins just arriving at (ihanadhah from the desert. Rashid showed no signs of anxieties or nervousness. He is quite confident of his power. He observed the strictest secrecy about these operations and is determined to achieve his object at ally cost, even if it leads to open hostilities with Abu Dhabi. 4. Abu Dhabi’s reactions to this are noy known yet as the news might be reaching them to-day. I anticipate that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi will consider Dubai’s action as an aggression and a preliminary step to attack Abu Dhabi itself and will not tolerate it but it is yet too early to forecast whether the Ruler of Abu Dhabi will use force or will start discussions with Dubai first. 5. I have been informed by a reliable source that Rashid felt that P.C.L.will be operating on the Trucial Coast in the near future and has, therefore, hastened to defind his boundary with Abu Dhabi before the fhaikh of Abu Dhabi could get a chance to lay his hands on Ghanadhah. 6. I should be grateful for your instructions on the following actions:- (a) Whether, in the event of the situation reaching such a stage that trouble becomes imminent, to write officially to both the Rulers of Dubai and Abu Dhabi informing them that they will be held responsible for the loss of life and property of all British and foreign subjects residing in their respective territiries, and,' (b) whether to report to you any developments by telegram.CONFIDENTIAL .

Shaikh Rashid bin S id was also present. 3. I asked shaikh Said what was happening ac. Ghanadhah. He said that Khor Ghanauhah w&lt; s in his M Haram M (territory) and quoted the following two instances in support of this contention a) About 10 years ago a lianasir shot and injured one of' jharjah's subjects from Khan at Khor Ghanadhah. shaikl.

I then asked Shaikhs Said and Rashid how many armed men they had sent go Khor Ghanauhah ana wa s told about 300 men were Shaikh Rashid then enquired whether it were not true that a breach/&gt; by sea for seisin^ a a lace on land* ^ I told him that was incorrect, and the movement of all forego by sea for an a jr ess ion on land was forbidden as ha must know* please see paje 721 et seq of Lorimer Vol. I . art I for precedenus. I asked whther his action in sending 3oo armed men to seize a place, j ohe ownership of which was in dispute, coulu be construed by bhaikh Ghciildibut as anything other than an invitation to war. Shaikh dashid admitted that if the circumstances had been reversed he, would so construe iu and added rather defiantly that they were ♦ ready for all eventualities. j-je maintained duat if he had not sent men, Shaikh ohakhbut would have done so ; to which I replied that that was an excuse for aggression used by Hitler^ shaikh Rashid - Allah Hashal 6. The position, enemas it appears at present is:- a) In August 1337 Shaikh Shakhbut ■'*-*&amp;&amp;&amp; that Abu Rhabi's eastern boundary extended to the Jabal Ali (Britagent’s Confidential memorandum ho.C730-19/1 of the 11th August 1937 refers!. L %lf r laid claimed that Rubai' b) In August 1937 Shaikh bard claimed tnat Ruoai's western boundary extended to Khor Ghanadhah (Residency Agent's Confidential memorandum ho. 715-19/1 of the 4th «ugust 1937 refers). j?*^ t c) Khor Ghanadhah's ownership has never been^didted/ The attempt at agreement in November 1937 was abortive. d) bhaikh Rashid of Rubai made no attempt to reach an ainj-cable settlement before sending about 300 armed men to occupy ilhor Ghanddhah a few days ago. I think most of the men were undoubtedly sent by sea. His querry abouu the treaty of 1853 mentioned in the preceding paragraph as also his guiltu demeanour auriiyj cVT meeting - both left me in no aoubt but that he realised he had contravened tlie treaty. » e) Dubai is prepared to fight Abu Dhabi to enforce its claim to Khor Ghanedha and, although I have not yet haq an opportunity to see bhai.kh shakhbut of ^^bu Dhabi ? j; think the latter must an d will accept the challenge - even if he were not already convinced that Dubai's intentions v.ere not confined to the seizure of Khor-x Ghanadhah duo included an evenx.iial at.t»ack on . bu Dhabi itself* (ihe Residency -^gent reported this in his diary Wo. 18 of . 1 have issued a le tter to eae?i of the rulers dhaikhs daio bin hakoum and. dhaklibut bin dultan to the effect that they he responsiole lor any loss in life or property to British ouujecGS ana aiii enclosing a cop c of the letter herewith.

Shaikh Shakhbut has wired to India recalling his brother^, lay id bin Juloan and also his cousin Luhammad bin Khalifah. Shaikh SiidkhDut is extremely pai^simonious but also mucii respected, and ± uhink ohcre is no doubt whatsoever but that his parsiDiony will not deoer him from spending money on an occasion like this go i ally supper g from uhe oribes — indeed he may have saved money i to meet precisely such an eventuality. That being so, the residency Agent and Khan Bahadur Abdur Hazzaq been agree that he will obtain the support of the Lanasir, £u Shamis, Wa 1 im ana Awamir probably. ■W . Sna ikh Wash id is confident that Gne Al Bn Shams and Ha Mm tribes will support hiy or not interfere but, as far cS one can ever jud^e tilt ret c uions o^. tlie Bedouin on uhese occasions y I think he overs tuna tes his ability to buy them off. Unless, then, Dubai ‘ scores a quick victory, war between the two Shuikhdoms will involve, in all probability, the Gribes menoioned above ana would piooably lead to raids on Dubai itself and must lead to a recurrence of the old feeling of insecurity generally on the Trucial Coast. /e neea not expect war in the immediate future because Shaikh Shakhbut is probably engaged at the moment in buying the suoport of the neighbouring tribes and i* \.ill take him sevefildays to make • his prepa ations, 9 * -Because tliere is a danger of this incident leading to rc-ids on Dubai and that other tribes, whether inlo. whole or only in sme ll ^'angs, id ire join in, the Residency Agent and iChan Bahadur .^odur Razzaq both agree vvioh me oiiat we shoald interfere and insist on a peaceful setulemeno of tne ownership of KtfpK Ghana hah. b) if we do so, we should xxili cell shaikh Rashid to return his men anu all building maueri: 1 to bubal and must be prepared to use force *(e.g. the R*A*FO to make him do so if he refuses.

DufeifcL 1 - ^ou±v^ in occupying Khor Ghanauhah m, ,/ or may not have any further object tn.n to enforce his claim to that boundary* I think ShuikL Rashid will see how Shaixh Shakhbut and the tribes i eciCt - ii favourably to him, I think he might expend his objective and might try to take iibu Dhaui itself. Shaikh Shakhbut is, i believe, quite convinced that that is Dubai'sX 6 ; i. x'inal objective. follov,in^ &lt;jQU8iiis of Shaikh Shakabut* supports Dubai:- e ) Hilal bin Saqr - noituaily reoiaent in Buraimi - now witn Shaikh Rashid az Khor Ghanadhah.

Shaikh Khalifah bin iaid had now returned from Baraimi. 4. Shaikh S-.akhbut claimed that IChor Ghanadhah was, without \ X a shdow of aoubi,; his territory. He said what Shaikh Khalifah bin ^aid ooujht the Khor off some Abu Jhabi subjects many years ago for the fishing rights (the produce at certain trues of the year being considerable) and now ren^s it to fishermen from Abu Dhobi.

Shaikh ^hakhbut and later Shaikh Hazza asked whether rationed foodstuffs and cloth would continue to be available from Dubai and whether I could guarantee that point. I replied that controlled items vvere 3U plied by Government and we would see he had no cause to worry about an economic blockade of tj ose items by Dubai He then enquired about uncontrolled goods and was told that he might * have to maxe other arrangements although I hoped there would be no necessity. , He has been issuing rice eoc. to the Bedouin to the detriment of his \ own subjects in Vbu Dhabi and will presumably go on doing so as mor&lt;, ‘tribesmen arrive. He said certain uncontrolled items e.g. coffee have already been denied him by Dubai. 1C* s ) Fighting is obviously inevitable, will invoke many of the tribes, may last for some time and must end in a reversion to a g.neral feeling of insecurity on the coast. b)There is not, much to add to what I said in my previous■ v . i m m Uk^rX ill letter except that I consider e should noV' * (27 &gt; fail to call ohaikhs Said and ilashid to account for . moving their expedition by sea and there is no doubt they did so.

If we do nothing, the war Mcstat be long and protracted and we shall probably find the Avamir amongst others raiding into Dubai itself (Shaikh Hazza said so in so many words)• 11.

(ii) that the Hon'ble the Political Resident takes a serious view of his action and (iii) that he should forthwith withdraw the armed men he has despatched to Ghanadhah and maintain the status quo pending examination of the frontier question. (b) at the same time inform the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi (i) that the Ruler of Dubai has been told to withdraw the forces he has despatched to Ghanadhah and to maintain the status quo pending examination of the frontier question. (ii) that he - the Ruler of Abu Dhabi - should take no retaliatory or agressive action which might result in hostilities. 3.

Ohanadhah is claimed by both Dubai and Abu Dhabi vide papers enclosed with Residency letter D.O. 651-S (652-S to Government of India) 27th August 1937. 3. Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, has visited Dubai and Abu Dhabi and has warned both Rulers that they will be held responsible for any loss of life or damage to property of British subjects resulting from any clash. 4. Both Rulers appear prepared to resort to force in support of their claim, and are at present enlisting support of their bedouin tribes. 5. There is no doubt that Dubai has committed a breach of the Maritime Truce Treaty of 1853. In order to prevent outbreak of hostilities, which would disturb the Trucial Coast and affect the safety of the air route (though owing to the distance of the disputed area from Dubai this I hope will not result) I have instructed Political Aeent Bahrain to proceed immediately to the Trucial Coast and ta) inform the Ruler of Dubai (i) that he has committed a breach of the Treaty of 1853 (ii) that I take a serious view of his action and (iii) that he should withdraw his forces and maintain the status quo pending examination of the frontier question; (b) (i) inform the Ruler of Abu Dhabi of the communication made to the Shaikh of Dubai and (il) tell him that he - Abu Dhabi - should take no retaliatory action which might result in hostilities. 6. I hope that both Shaikhs will comply but should either prove recalcitrant coercive measures will have to be considered and in the fast resort it might be necessary to use force, 'if / / 7 GALLOWAY YG I I Office of the Political Resident, No* C/363. s Persian Gulf, Camp, Bahrain. Copy forwarded with compliments The Political Agent,*D.O. NO. C/1028. c ? 21 fhe 31st of October, 1945. Dear Colonel Calloway, There is one rather disquieting feature about the reporting of the Dubai-Abu Dhabi 'war'. In his diary for the second half of September the Residency Agent noted that Shaikh Rashid of Dubai had gone to Ghanadhah on a “fishing expedition”j and that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi had then shown considerable alarm and had commenced to “mobilise his forces'. The Residency Agent then stated that he believed the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi»s alarm to be entirely without foundation* As you are aware,(vide my Printed Letter No. c/^98, dated the 21st October, 1945), it was not until the 20th of October that the Residency Agent reported the Dubai aggression which had taken place on the night of the 17th October. He gave as his excuse the fact that I had forbidden him to report confidential matters in G.T.C. - the only code which he holds. I consider that in so interpreting my instructions he exhibited an entire lack of appreciation of the situation and a very faulty judgement. In fairness, I must qualify this remark by the general consideration that the post is far too difficult for a man of his calibre. yours sincerely. i I The Hon'ble Lt-Col. A.C. Galloway, O.B.E.» political Resident in the Persian Gulf, (Camp) Bahrain/ CONFIDENTIAL / EXPIRESS LETTER From - political Agent, Bahrain To Political Resident at Bahrain No. C/1029. Dated Bahrain, the 31st of October, 1945 /4 in accordance with the orders contained in Residency Express Letter No. c/360, dated the 26th October, 1945, I went to Dubai on the 28th October, 1945, and saw the Shaikh that afternoon. His son, Shaikh Rashid bin Said bin Maktoom, was also present and, from the Dubai side, he sustained the burden of the interview. u $. lb 2. I handed the Shaikh a letter, of which I enclose a copy, containing the political Resident*s demand. Assisted by Shaikh Rashid he then tried to argue that Ghanadhah was in his territory by quoting the instances already mentioned in the Assistant political Agent»s Express Letter No.c*1084. 0215, dated the 22nd October, 1945, paragraph 3. They both reverted again and again to this kind of argument while I merely replied that the time, for it had gone when, instead of re-opening negotiations on the frontier question, they had taken matters into their own hands and committed down right aggression. I had no need to simulate anger when I told him that the reason they were able to do so was because they had made profits out of the war which the Allied soldiers had fought. After this, they said they would do whatever I wanted even if it meant handing over to me Dubai town. They were ready, they said, to withdraw from Ghanadhah but enquired what action they could take in the event of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi retaliating against them. I said that if they withdrew the next day I would send a i letter to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi informing him that they were doing so and would give him the advice as directed by you at paragraph (b)(ii) of your Express Letter first quoted. They promised to send launches that evening to remove their forces and building materials, etc. I had also to reply to the rather futile query as to whether they could send launches - since it would take them a long time to collect enough camelsi I, of course, told them that provided there was no hostile intent it was no offence to send armed men in launches. The interview did not last very long because as each red-herring was produced I recalled the Shaikhs to the line by proclaiming that before there was any more talk they must withdraw from Ghanadhah. , ^ 3. On the 29th of October I sent the Residency Agent, Sharjah, to Abu Dhabi with the letter of which I enclose a copy. I have also asked him to report as to whether the Dubai people were moving from Ghanadhah, immediately on his return to Sharjah. • I am awaiting news from him. Attested. Sd.-/ C.J.

That Rashid had often been heard saying in his Lajlis, 'There are only owo powerful kings in Arabia; Ibn Saud in the West and I in Che gust'. That when he used to ive a rifle to one of his men, he used to tell him, i*j want you to shoot with unis rifle at the heart oi Abu Dhabi.' Shaikh Ghaklibut further said that Shaikh Said is also responsible for such underhand.intrigues and treachery inspite of ohe fact that he (Shakhbut) had on many occasions in the past heloed him when his position in Dubai was very serious and was about to be ousted by his cousins. That this is uhe reward which j he has now received from Said in return lor his (Shakhbuc's) favours and help. Shaikh Ghakhbut then said that he was under the impression that one Shaikh of vubui had seized’Ghanadhah with the Government's approval. I told him tinnt this is entirely untrue, that the Government do not agree to any act of aggression by any one, and that the Government's orders to the ; Huler/-m / t 7 T luler ox* Dubai x.o wiuhtii'avv hi^ ai'iiiuo.

I punishment, and that this will encourage others to do similar action if they cone to know that the punishment is only an order of withdrawal. I replied that this is a matter for the Government to decide. 4* Shaikh Shakhbut Lola me that he received replies from * .ost of the tribes uh^t they were ready to come and received messages from Shaikhs Yasir and Aii bin Sultan of the Janabah tribe, who live south of Jbri and Dhank saying Uiao they were \ prepared oo join him and were awaiting his orders to move. Shaikh Shakhbuc, ‘introduced me to Ali bin Hilal, Chief of the Duru* tribe who had juso arrived at Abu Dhabi. Shaikh Shkhbut uold me that he had arranged for the tribes to collect, at a place called Bu Dheeb, Abu about 40 miles south east of/Dhabi. 5 , Shaikh Shakhbut and Hazza' more than once insisted that they may be allowed to dial with the Shaikh of Dubai and teach*him a lesson as he, they said, thinks that beat he can gain territory by money. They added onut they tolerated much the inconsistent, unfrienaly and provocative attitude of lashid towards them to which they did not retaliate and that this opportunity of Dubai starting . aggression is a unique one for ending this scate of worriness once and for ever. I told them this is not-desirable and that it is in their interest to abide by Government's oners. 6 . I told Shaikh Shakhbut that I will not fail to bring all what he said to your no ,ice and he need not worry. I added that the Government's aim is that there should be general security and tranquility all over the Truciul Coast so that every one may live in peace. I then asked him to send word to The tribes not to come and to ensure that no retaliatory or aggressive action is taken by r him or his men which miaht lead to hostilities* He promised to do4 V (45) and gave me a reply to your le^-er to him in this connection which is iorwarueci herewith in original witii translation.

Subject: Dubai-Abu Dhabi Affairs. I'emorandutn. The Ruler of Dubai has just reported to me the following three incidents of camel lotting which had taken place within his territory:- (a) On 26th Dhul O.ada 1364-(2.11#45) Ali bin T ubarak bin Salmin of the ranasir tribe and Ibn ’ Iqaif, Shaikh Khalifah bin Zayid’s man together with two other persons looted five Dubai camels from a place called A1 Hafirah about 50 miles south of Dubai. Only tv/o^eamels were restored. (b) On £ 8 th Dhul qada 1364(4.11.45)four Awamir bedouins , Suhail Bal T Aray, Bin Rowlah, Bin Tihmim and in Suv/ailim, looted tight Dubai camels from a place called about 40 miles south of Dubai A pursurE^aPS^waseent out after them unto al ! T u T atridh (Buraimi). Sultan bin Surur, Shaikh of Abu Dhabi f s Representative there took over the seven camels(the eighth having been wounded by Dubai people)from the Awamir robbers and refused to give them back to Dubai people but, having received instructions from the Ruler of Abu Dhabi not to take any aggressive action againt Dubai, he returned all the seven camels to the Dubai people who brought them back safely to Dubai. (c) On 2nd Dhul Hijjah 1364(9.11.45)three camels were looted by three bedouins whose identities have not yet been discovered from a place (water well) called al Harmum and al i Dir rah about 35 miles south of Dubai. A pursuit party of 9 persons was sent after them but before overtaking them, the robbers left the camels and ran away. The pursuit party has not yet returned. 2. The Ruler of Dubai told me that he cannot say that these incidents of camel looting were instigated by the Ruler of Abu Dhabi but that since some of the persons responsible for these incidents were the Ruler of Abu Dhabi T s men, he considered it desirable that they should be brought to his notice and asked to discourage such raids by his men on Dubai territory. 3 . T made thorough investigation of these incidents and found nothing to prove that they were really instigated by the/- 1jM - 2 - the ^uler of Abu Dhabi, ^he incident mentioned at (b) and most probably the one mentioned at (c) above were committed by ordinary Awamir robbers who have an old fued ayaint Dubai and who thought that they could revive the old practices of looting Dubai property. The Huler of Dubai is quite prepared to check their activities and to put a total stop to any further raids on Dubai territory. 4 .

The Shaikh of Dubai has just reported to me that four more camels were looted during the period 19th-21st November (2 by Abu Dhabi subjects and 2 by unidentified bedouins) and taken to ^uraini. 4. On the 21st November the Shaikh of Dubai sent a messenger named Ahmad bin Habtoor, to Abu Dhabi with a friendly letter to Shnikh Shakhbut requesting him to arrange for the recovery and return of the 3 camels looted by his subjects Ali bin Thibarak bin Salmin and Tbn T Iqnif (referred to at para 1 (a) of my (^memorandum No.01139.0215 dated the 10th November 1945) and also two saddle bngs retained by his Representative Sultan bin Surur and inviting his co-operation in discouraging further raids o^ Dubai. Shaikh Said told me that the messenger returned from Abu Dhabi on the 25th Povenber and reported to him that Shaikh Shakhbut told him in a rude manner that he was not going to send any rep^v to Shaikh Said T s letter and that he ras no more on friendly terms with him.

That three notorious robbers n^-od ’libarak bin 0* an, Bin Silayin and r TT ubarak Bal Ro'dhah are novr in Abu Dhabi anra.iting an opportunity to cone out for looting Dubai T s camels. 5. Shaikh of Abu Dhabi f s attitude towards Dubai is far from friendly and bis imosiny these restrictions upon the Dubai pursuit parties amounts to nothing but non-cooperation with Dubai and encouragement to robbers to continue their practices. The Shaikh of Dubaucnn take the law into his own hands and disregard these restrictions but he loathes to do anything thr t might aggravate matters. The continuation of these raids is quite undesirhble and Shaikh Shakhbut must co-operate whole-heartedly and forget the past. The robbers T ' r ould not have indulged in these activities had they not felt that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi encourages then secretly and affords them asylum in his territory. According to tribal law if the looters are Abu Dhabi subjects, the Shaikh of Vbu Dhobi is bound to recover and return what his sublect have looted. Tf the robbers are not his subjects but entered his territory he has either to observe 'batai' usage (i.e. allow the oursuit oarty to follow the robbers and overtake them) or t? basab” (i.e. to recover the looted stuff and Return it to its owners). 6 . I, therefore, renuest your orders to write to Shaikh Shakhbut amt say that T heave been instructed by you to tell him that the attitude which he had adopted towards the Shaikh of Dubai with regard to the looting incidents was not friendly and that it is necessary that he should fully co-operate in the suupression of these raids and that all the cornels looted by his subjects or persons taking refuge in his territory should be returned and that he should afford the Dubai pursuit parties all reasonable assistance in accordance with tribal law.. EXPilESS LETTER . From Political Agent, Bahrain, political Resident, Bushire To \ No. C/1151. Dated the 29th of December, 1945 Reference your Express Letter NO.960-S dated the 23r^ oi November, 1945. The points for comments appear to be (a) the question of punishment, and (b) the ownership of Khor Ghanadhah* 2 * As regards (a) we have informed the Sheikh of Dubai that he committed a breach of Article 3 of the 1853 Treaty. This he undoubtedly did by raiding Khor Ghanadhah, a territory which we knew quite well to be under dispute. oi Article 3 of the Treaty of 1853 by taking retaliatory measures when he should have referred to us. Abu Dhabi's action, however, was not provocative and was taken in self- defence against what, in my opinion, was a try-on of the Sheikh of Dubai to land grab in an area he considers will become valuable through oil development in the future. afraid we shall be .faced with an awkward precedent for the future and also that to act with over great leniency might be misinterpreted by the other Trucial sheikhs, and also in Qatar and Bahrein where- the case is being closely watched. Therefore, I think that a punishment should be inflicted for reasons of our own and not because of the representation ol che Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. As I have pointed out above he himself is at fault. 5* It will be noticed that the Sheikh of Dubai was in Muscat when the incident occurred and there must remain some doubt as to whether he engineered the incident before his departure or whether it was the work of Sheikh Rashid and his adviser Thani bin Abdullah. The Sheikh has, of course, interested himself in the past in the area between Jabal Ali and the Khor Ghanadhah but I doubt if he is responsible for the present incident. His son Sheikh Rashid is usually considered a good and sensible Sheikh but he has fallen under the influence of a bad adviser who was 'until recently the Customs Director. With a view to the future, and our present requirements, I feel that our best course of action would be to suggest to the Sheikh the removal of Thani bin Abdullah from his circle, and the imposition of ajfine. I am not particularly in favour of fining and that might be left to depend on the reactions to the above course. action is being taken against him but that he is expected to co-operate in maintaining quiet in the desert to do which is in his own interests and incidentally those of the P.C.L* 3. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi also committed a breach 4 If we do not take any punitive measure I am 6 . The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi might be told that no /7. As regardsAs regards (b) the Sheikh explained &amp;o me that his claim is based, in brief, on &amp;he following points:- (x) Ten years ago he was held responsible for a shooting affray in the Khor, and (y) more recently, 8 years ago, he was held responsible for the plundering of a Saudi boat in the Khor. He admitted his responsi bility and paid compensation. (z) that whatever may have been agreed in 1937, that agreement is abortive and so should not receive consideration. 8. I was unfortunate in not meeting Sheikh Shakhbut, although I went to Abu Dhabi to see him, but I understand from the Residency Agent that the Sheikh can only reply to (x) by admitting that Dubai paid compensation for the. shooting of a Sharjah man by a Manasir, but that that does not establish ownership of the Khor. As regards (y) he states that the plunderers of the cargo v/ere Dubai men and for that reason the Sheikh of Dubai paid compensation. As regards (z) he maintains that he agreed to a point 13 miles south-west of Jabal Ali, Bandar Hisaiyan, as being considered the Dubai-Abu Dhabi boundary and that therefore the Khor Ghanadhah, situated south-west of Bandar Hisaiyan, is obviously in Abu Dhabi. He produces the further argument that the Ghanadhah fishing rights belong to Abu Dhabi. 9. It is not possible without further investigation to come to any decision as to whose territory the Khor is, and it is a question whether we should endeavour to do so and, on paper, settle the quarrel once and for all. The Sheikh of Dubai has stated to me that he is prepared to submit to any arbitration committee His Majesty's Government; suggests. He himself suggested the two Jawassimi Sheikhs of Ras al Khaimah and Sharjah. Personally I should not agree to that and I doubt if Sheikh Shakhbut would. 10. The case does not, prima facie, appear to be a difficult one in regard to a decision on the boundary question, but there is the ever present Inability of an Arab who is a party to an arbitration abiding by an award, however much he may have agreed to abide by it beforehand, if that award goes against him. Actually I do not see any need at present to delimit the frontier and consequently make one dissatisfied party from whom we may require something. Were it considered necessary I suggest that the arbitration should^done by a committee of Arab Sheikhs. 11. Before, however, making any further recommendation I think the claims of the two parties should be more closely examined so that we may, if necessary, properly brief a committee. I should be grateful to know if I may instruct the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, to take action in this sense ATTESTED. Sd./- A.C. GALLOWAY Political Agent, Bahrain.

' Dated 23rd January 1946 133 Subject:- Dubai Abu Dhabi Affairs . A few days after Tr nur return .to Bahrain Shaikh Said and Shaikh Pashid c^no to see ne. Shaikh Said raised the question of his dispute with Abu Dhabi and asked me why -fA.e*** government v/as inter''erD-na; and not permittin^to settle the matter in their own r/ay. T replied that the orders of Government were quite clear on the subject and^that in view of * them T was surprised that he still entertained ideas of fight- 7 ing Abu Dhabi, I informed him that T was still more surprised that he had raised the subject so soon after having discussed it with the Political Agent. I told him quite plainly thrt the sooner he dismissed the idea of commencing hostilities am-inst Abu Dhabi the better it would be for him. He then raised the matter of the camel looting which was reported to you in this office Confidential memorandum Ho.1139.0815 datetf y/ rS Uf 2 dated the 10th of November 1945. Ne said that his hends v/ere tied because of Oovernment T s orders and deplored the fact that he was forbidden to take action. Ne accused the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi of deliberately instigating some of the looting incidents and also of deliberately failing to take action aaainst persons concerned in others. T remarked that this r'epe^red to be pure conjecture on his part and that in view o' the very petty nature of the incidents involving only three or four camels, I doubted very much if his appreciation of the situation was correct. T said that such petty looting was common on the m rucial O^ast and that had the incidents to which he referred haprened before the jQior Nhanadhah incident he * T ould not have attached much importance to then. Na replied that the Shaikh of Abu D^abi had declared himself unfriendly to Dubai and that these incidents now assumed serious propor tions. If he took no action his subjects would consider it a sign of weakness and his prestige would suffer. I asked him how he could expect Abu Dhabi to adopt a friendly attitude to TT ards him in view of his aggressive action in attempting to seize Nhor Dhanadhah. I told him quite frankly that he v^as the acyressor in this case and that his avyressive act was the cause of all the trouble but was now however presenting his case as the aawriev^d party. Ne remained stubborn however end continued to deplore the fact that his hands were tied end th-t his prestige vr as being adversely affected, ^e said { while he appreciated the situation, his Bedouins ri ight well take matters into their own hands. I replied that if they did so he as the Nuler of Dubai would be held responsible. / rTr e ntually I agreed to write to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi asking him to take all action possible to prevent lootinm by his subjects and to do all he could to restore the camels already stole'. Shaikh Said said that this might have some effect but he doubted very much if the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi would co-operate Shaikh Hashid °s usual joined in the discussion and he several times asked me what right Novernnent had to3 &gt; interfere in the matter. T replied that he ^ould be ill- advised to challenge CrOveminent f s right$ to maintain peace on the ^racial Coast. A ^ays later Shaikh Pashid came alone to see me.

Although at first he said the persons responsible were those whose camels had been stolen by Abu Dhabi people # I informed him that I ms quite sure that the raids had ^carefully organised. TT e replied that raids on such a large scale could only be organised with the knowledge and assistance of responsible persons ^in which case he would know about them, v-r this time T had become quite convinced that Dhaikh Rashid was responsible for organising the raids and I told Shaikh Said so. na of course denied any knowledge or complicity but not very convincingly. T !is attitude was one of self- satisfied defiance. Re said tint had government agreed to allow the ^racial Shaikhs to mediate in his dispute -*ith Abu Dhabi thi's raid v/ould not have taken place. T asked him if he realised that he was guilty of a further act of aggression and that he had flouted Government r s orders and broken his promise to keep the peace. TT e seemed to be indifferent to the seriousness of this question and -ave no definite reply. In fact he seemed rather pleased with him self. I told him that the sooner he returned the looted camels the better it would be for him. He replied that he could not say what action he would take until he knew exactly v/hat had happened. Shaikh Rashid g/ho v/as still squirming uneasily in his chair ; then.said that he would go'that afternoon and investigate the matter. Shaikh Said however would not ~ive no any assurance that he would return the'x rm im mm ^ s. canels. TT ~ maintained an attitude of ’efiance and apparent inflifferenoe. T then left saying that T would report the natter to the Political Agent. next day Shaikh gayid bin Su'tan (the brother 01 Shaikh Shakhbut) visited me and T gave him a letter to Shaikh Shakhbut in which T asked for a. detailed renort of 1,1 ® looking and reminded him of his jpromise to obey Govern— nent»s orders and fake no action which would lead to hostilities. I olso sayd that I was taking the natter up n.th the Shaikh of Dubai. Defore leaving for fbu Dhabi Shaikh Sayid bin Sultan informed me th t some of the looted camels had oeen brought to Dubai and v. r ere being used for carrying loads. Tfany of the she-camels he said were in foal and that if they were used for heavy work it night cause onem oo miscarry, me therefore requested ne to inform the Sby’-’kli of Dubai of this and to instruct him not to work them. I included this request in a letter to the Shaikh of Dubai and attach a translation of his replv. nn 'kke following day I received a letter from the i Shoikh of Abu fiabi, a translation of which is attached. According to his account 92 camels and probably more have oeen looted. I also attached a translation of a letter from 3haikh Hazza* oin Sultan in reply to my lotter to his brother the Duler of Abu Dhabi. 7 « T sent the Residency Agent to see the Shaikh of Dubai in the afternoon to ascertain further developments. Shaikh Said informed him that Shaikh Dashid had not gone to investigate the looking out had sent his nephew Tfaktum bin Turn ? a to i^iake arrangements for the protection of Dubai camels. has not vet returned. Sir ikh Said maintained his defiant attitude and flatly refused to return the looted camels until Shaikh Shakhbut had returned those looted from his subjects. It was explained to him th t only three canelk remained to be returned and that as they had been looted bv V the Awanir, Shaikh Shakhbut could not reasonably be holdresponsible, 'H’e then nentioned three other cartels the looting of which he had not reported to me and vaguely mentioned a further 13 camels but could supply no details as to how, when or where they have been looted, 8 , Tn my telegram in which I reported the looting &lt;1T\ I mentioned^unconfirraed report to the effect that retaliatory action had been taken resulting in the death of two Beni °.itab escorts. It now appears thfet the Awamir raided a mixed caravan looted 15 camels and killed'one Beni oitab escort, ^he Shaikh of Dubai confirms this and is not interested in it. It will therefore be seen tlr t the Shaikh the of Abu Dhabi has fully complied with/order to maintain the status quo and has done nothing to justify the Shaikh of Dubai T s hostile action. The Shaikh of Dubai however is guilty on several counts. Tn the first place he took aggressive action against the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi by sending unarmed force by sea to Khor ghandhah and thereby violated the terms of the Peace n Teaty. He has flouted government *3 orders tq&gt; keep the peace by deliberately organising and carrying out a large scale raid against Abu Dhabi, ’.lien * called upon to account for this act of aggression he has maintained a defiant attitude and refused to make restitution of any kind. 9. Although the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was the aggrieved party in the Khor Dhanadhah affair he showed comnendable restraint and complied fully with government’s orders even though, much to his surprise and probably to that of most of the Crucial Shaikhs, the Shaikh of Dubai remained unpunished for his breach of the Peace m reaty. r T e is still obeying the orders to maintain the status quo despite the fact th t he has now for the second time been the victim of unprovoked hostile action by the Shaikh of Dubai. ^ T ot only has his prestige suffered but his subjects have also suffered considerable material loss. It now remain to be seen how long he can control the rising impatience of his people and7 also his ovm. If he sees the Shaikh of Dubai flouting Government f s orders v/ith impunity he v/ill most certainly be encouraged to retaliate. Retaliation on his part trill more than likely lead to open hostilities between Dubai and Abu Dhabi. This trill cause a feeling of unrest to spread throughout the Trucial Coast and a general outbreak of looting^particularly by the Awamir who will readi.Vg take advantage of the situation especially if given any encouragement by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, lo. In ray opinion therefore^ immediate and decisive action against the Shaikh of Dubai is called for. I would recommend an immediate fine of one lakh of rupees for his breach of the 'oeace ''’reaty and his flagrant disobedience of C-o”ernment T s orders to maintain the status quo and an order to return immediately all the looted camels. This action should then be followed as soon as possible by a settlement of the T Tior Ghanadhah dispute. In my opinion it does not permit of mediation, arbitration or compromise by the rr, rucial Shaikhs but should be settled by us. I wo ’Id suggest, having obtained from the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and D ’bai written undertakings to accept our decision, that we call upon the Shaikh o^ Dubai to produce evidence in support of his claim to Xhor Ghanadhah and at the same time call upon the Shaikh of Abu ^habi to substantiate his claim to its pee^t-ion.

Political Resident, Bushire To No. 35- Da ted the 2Dth January 1946. My telegram No. 25 dated 22nd January 2 . The situation is that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi reported that on the 14th January 50 armed persons of Dubai looted from Abu Dhabi about 92 camels which act, he stated, was in contravention of the orders of Government demanding the maintenance of the status quo over the Ghanadhah question. In reply I have written that I am referring the matter to you. 3. I visited the Shaikh of Dubai on the 24th and pointed out that he was inviting the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to retaliate and was endangering the peace of the desert, The Shaikh did not, of course, admit organ*isin&amp; the raid but admits that it was carried out by his people and that he has the camels in his keeping. He said that he could not restrain his Bedouin because of provocations from Abu Dhabi. This statement is not according to facts as we believe them to be and I am sure the Shaikh is continuing in his inimical attitude to incite Abu Dhabi. By the end of the interview the Shaikh agreed to return the camels if I ordered him to do so but not repeat not of his own free will. He maintained this attitude on the 26th. looting incidents and I have declined to order the return of the loot.

There is, of course, the possibility but I am afraid I think it must be faced otherwise we admit we are not in a position to impose a penalty when this becomes necessary to maintain our prestige on the Coast. Were the Shaikh to retaliate stronger coercive action such as .stoppage of air mail facilities, non-essential, civil supplies, diversion of steamers to Sharjah, etc., would be called for. The R.A.F. would have to unload supplies at Sharjah and B.O.A.C. operate from Ras-al- Khaimah where they maintain an emergency alighting area. 4. However, as said above, I think Shaikh unlikely to show such unfriendliness to H.M.G. 5. As regards P.C.L. I estimate Dubai’s antagonistic attitude to Abu Dhabi is largely due to jealousy in that oil interests are moving from Dubai. Shaikh of Dubai is co-operating fully with P.C.L. and danger to their operations would come from Abe Dhabi’s taking retaliatory action against Dubai if the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi thought that his interests were not receiving equal treatment at the hands of H.M.G. as those of Dubai. = POLITICAL = LEI.Political Resident, Bushire Political Agent, Bahrain.

I asked the Shaikh of Dubai to come and see me today and he came accompanied by his son Shaikh Rashid. I complied with your instructions and informed him that his looting of Abu Dhabi camels constituted a further violation of his assurance to His Majesty^ Government to maintain the Status quo and that, in accordance with the terms of his letter dated the 29th of * * • d \ October 1945 in which he gave that assurance, he should now settle the incident in normal tribal manner. I explained that the orders of His Majesty's Government to maintain the status quo still held good and that as he had disobeyed them and broken the peace, he was now expected to restore the situation. He readily agreed to try and do so and said that all along he had been asking for permission to have the dispute settled according to tribal custom i.e. to get some responsible person to mediate between them. Shaikh Rashid also made the same remark and stressed the fact that mediation was the only satisfactory solution. The implication was, of course, that had.we complied with his request for settlement by mediation in the first place, this trouble would not have occurred. Both Shaikh Said and Shaikh Rashid seemed very relieved when I had finished communicating your instructions to them, particularly Shaikh Rashid, who I saw smile for the first time since the looting. They both appeared to expect something more drastic. Incidently the arrival of my letter calling them to the Agency Confidential. coincided/- BAHRAIN RECEIPT.

Shaikh Rashid asked me to confirm that His Majesty^ Government considered that his looting of the Abu Dhabi camels constituted a violation of their assurance to keep the peace. I did so and explained that Dubai was still bound by the promise to His Majesty’s Government, to keep the peace and that the sooner he restored the status quo the better it would be for Dubai. 4. I also informed Shaikh Said that, until further notice, no travel documents would be issued to his subjects. He sedately replied that in that case he would not apply for any travel documents until the ban was lifted. Shaikh Rashid remarked that his father, being a little deaf, had not properly understood what had been said and that he would take the matter up with me later. 5. I am sending a letter as you have instructed, to the Shaikh of Abu ^habi and will report developments in due course.

Reference your Important telegram No.54 dated the 8th of February 1946 on the above mentioned subject. 2* During my interview with the Shaikh of Dubai reported in my Confidential memorandum No.Cl63.0215 dated the 9th of L ^£ U- • February 1946, I asked him how many men he. had organised in the desert and where they were located. Before he could answer, Shaikh Rashid immediately feigned surprise and denied that there were any organised forces, with the exception of two or three men he had sent to keep a look out. I repeated ray question to Shaikh Said and asked him why he had on a previous occasion said that more than 1000 men had been organised and were in a state of readiness deployed around Marmum (Shaikh Rashid was not present when his father had first volunteered this information). Shaikh Said, however, confirmed his previous statement. Shaikh Rashid attempted to pass off the ^ apparent contretemps saying that his father had not correctly appreciated the situation and that, if Bedouins were included, then Dubai forces amounted to thousands. 3. I then suggested to Shaikh Said that he should take me into the desert and show me exactly what the situation was. He readily agreed and asked me when I would like to go. When I said that I should like to go on the following day (the 10th of February) he raised no objection but I think he would have &gt; preferred a few days grace. 4 # On the morning of the 10th of February I met Shaikh Rashid at Za’bil, a place about 5 miles south of Dubai and from there we travelled in approximately a south-easterly direction. After travelling for about 36 miles through very thick/- Confidential. - ' ‘b ^ ' BAHRAIN RECEIPT. !&gt;, - V '&gt;thick sand we racked a place named Maruraunu It is in the middle of a large expanse of scrub desert and sand dunes v/ith no habitation whatsoever and is marked only by a well* m 5. At this place the Shaikh of Dubai now has his Tt Advanced Headquarters” with Shaikh Rashid as 'Commander in Chief”. Shaikh Rashid informed me that he had withdrawn the looted camels as far westwards as possible near Dubai and he Sharjah. I asked him how many men/had camped at Marumum and for what purpose. He replied that he had about 40 men camped there for nrbtective duties against possible raids from Abu- Dhabi. When I went round the camp which is dispersed into four separate encampments, I estimated the strength to be at least 120 armed men. I asked him where his other forces were located and, after some questioning, he admitted that he had up to 1500 armed Bedouins deployed along a front running approximately northeast from Marmum up to Jirri (Ras al IChaimah). He assured me that he had no men nearer Abu Dhabi territory than Marmum. 6. A few days ago I received information from two fairly reliable sources that Shaikh Rashid had puchased large quantities of stores and second hand clothing for supply to the Bedouins he had mobilised. One report gave the following details:- 2000 articles of second hand clothing. 400 sheep. 20 tihs of halwa. 1000 baskets of dates. Large quantities of rice. I asked Shaikh Rashid how he was maintaining thes comparatively large force and if he was supplying food etc. He denied that he was in any way maintaining it, saying that as the Bedouins comprising the force normally occupied the areas in which they were now located and that he had only stopped them moving about and kept them in thjbr present positions, there was no need to provide them with stores etc. In view of the fairly reliable reports regarding his extensive purchases of clothes and food and his propensity for unconvincing lying, I was not prepared to believe him. I did not see any large quantities of food at Karmum but I did notice that many of the men were wearing 'natty” double breasted pin striped3 ■■■■■■I °y 7. After lunch we spent sofcie time in shooting at an empty kerosene tin placed at a distance of about 125 yards and, having displayed their very bad marksmanship, we returned. T did not have an opportunity of visiting any other encampment as this would have entailed prolonging my visit by some days and continuing with camel transport for which I was unprepared. 9. Raving considered the situation I am of the opinion that the Shaikh of Dubai has a force of some 1500 armed men deployed from Marmum to Jirri. They appear to be well disposed and with Marmum as the spearhead can be easily manoeuvred to counter any hostile action by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. At Marmurn I saw the following persons actually camped there:- Shaikh Khalifah bin Said - Son of Shaikh Said Shaikh Maktum bin Jum’ah Nephew of Shaikh Said Shaikh Muhammad bin Hashir M ' ' ' Shaikh Suhail bin Buti Son of Shaikh Buti (former ruler of Dubai) Shaikh Suhail bin Mani f Son of Shaikh Mani f , cousin of Shaikh Said. In the event of any hostile move by the Shaikh of AbU' Dhabi these'persona^ will presumably disperse from Marmum and take up various 'commands' of the Dubai forces. 9. As far as is known the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has made no similar arrangements and is merely awaiting the intervention of His Majesty’s Government. At no time did I receive the impression that the Shaikh of Dubai was preparing to attack Abu Dhabi. He is at present only on the defensive.

The impression is that the stoppage of travel documents is the forerunner of more drastic measures. It is reported that several of the ^Hibai notables have approached Shaikh Said reproaching him for incurring Government's displeasure and urging him to comply immediately with whatever instructions he may have received. Shaikhah Hissa (the Ruler's wife) is also reported to have rebuked her husband and her son (Shaikh Rashid) and insisted upon their prompt action to remedy the situation. 4. Shaikh Rashid appears to treat the stoppage of travel documents as a sanction of little importance and continues in his efforts to swell the Dubai forces. He appears to be particularly keen to bring the Beni Qitab onto his side. Shaikh Said, however, does not appear to take such a lighthearted view of the situation and is said to have reproached**his son for his rash behaviour in looting t’~e Abu Dhabi camels and blamed him for the present situation. In fact there are signs of dissension in the Ruling family with Shaikh Said, Shaikh Jum'a (his brother) and Shaikhah Hissa on one side and Shaikh Rashid and his followers on the other side; 5. I am of the opinion that further minor sanctions are called for. For example, the Agent for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Coy. Ltd. has just received a consignment of petrol and kerosene to replenish stocks which were almost exhausted. A simple but very effective sanction would be to stop the issue of this petrol and kerosene to the retailers in Dubai. The Agent, Hhan Sahib Husain in quite prepared to co-operate and says that he can easily dispose of his stocks elsewhere. I would therefore request permission to enforce this proposed sanction.

Reference correspondence ending with your telegram No.245 dated the 10th February, 1946. 2. It was on or about the 10th February that the Shaikh of Dubai expressed his willingness to settle the dispute which has arisen over the camels he looted from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi by tribal methods and to that end he asked the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah to mediate for him. These two Shaikhs have written to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, but in what actual terms I am unaware. 3. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has not yet replied, and I understand from the political Officer, Trucial Coast, who visited him a few days before your recent visit, that as he is not prepared to accept negotiators nominated by the Shaikh of Dubai and that as the Shaikh of Dubai still holds numbers of his camels he does not propose to reply. 4. This method adopted by the Shaikh of Dubai does not amount to a serious endeavour to settle the dispute accord ing to tribal custom - vide paragraph 4 of my telegram No.35 dated the 29th January, 1946, but amounts to the shifting of the burden of responsibility on to the mediators and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. If the Shaikh of Dubai is allowed to persist in this a deadlock will ensue which will result in his avoiding the fulfilment of his word to His Majesty’s Government - vide my printed Letter No.c/1049 dated the 6th November, 1945 - and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, who has behaved admirably under the provocation, will be the loser all round. 5. in order to bring about an agreement from the Shaikh that he would settle the matter according to tribal law the issue of travel documents to Dubai subjects was withheld. These measures have proved not sufficiently coercive and I think that it is now necessary to take further action. This should, I suggest, take the form of the diversion of steamers from the port of Dubai and the transference of the Trucial coast tea and sugar supplies to Sharjah. This would deprive the Shaikh of an income derived from import duty on all sugar and tea for the Trucial Coast consumption, and in addition the 10# duty he levies on every bag of barter sugar and the Rs.50/- levied on every case of barter tea. The measures suggested would, therefore, affect the Shaikh personally and I consider their imposition necessary. I should be grateful for authority to enforce them. ATTESTED. Sd./- A.C.

If the shaikh of i&gt;ubei had any claim against him in respect of looted camels or any other matter, the correct procedure was for him to represent it in the normal manner, if proved he would have maae restitution, he fully investi^ateef the petty cases of looting that took place after the rdior uhanedhah incident ana took necessary action which restultea • in only about four camels looted by the AV.emir (not unaer his control; remaining outstanding. (f; in view oi his having done no tiling against nubai therefore the question of mediation does not arise so far as he is concerned, he fails to see how the shaikh of aubai after two acts of unprovoked aggression and still retaining more than 100 of his camels deliberately looted, can expect him to come to an amicable settlement according to tribal custom, hven if the situation permitted of such mediation he feels that he can no longer trust the shaikh oi uubai in view of what has happened. (g; he is at all times prepared to comply with the wishes of government but r in view of the manner in which* the shaikh of nubai has acted and has been treated by government, he sees no alternative but to take the matter into his own hands i.e. fight it out with nubai, after which, mediation as now proposed, will be .possible, tie therefore requests dovernment to withdraw the order regarding the status quo and allow him to take retaliatory action, ne does not propose to accept aiy oifer of mediation at this sta^e but nor does he propose to take th-e matter into his own hands until government have given him permission to ao so. 5. This is a brief account of shaikh shakhbut*s attitude and reactions to the present situation, i explained to him that his present policy i.e. that of keeping the peace, was a most wise one and that it would be to his advantage to continue with it. The shaikh of Dubai, 1 informed him, had incurred government*s displeasure and that his prestige had suffered accordingly, i .explained that so far government had only stopped travel documents ana called upon him to restore the situation but that this did not necessarily mean that no further action would be taken against him. sheikh shekhbut admitted that going to war with jjubai would be a baa thing but failed to see what else he could ao in the circumstances, i oiscusstd the matter with him at some length but he continued to bemoan the/fSct that government had not taken strong action against the shaikh oi subai ano to request that if vernment aid not intend to take action, then he should be allowed to do so. gventualiy i tola him that x was not in a position to say anything more on the subject and aavised him to take it.l up with the aon'ble the rolitical aesident ana political A^ent during their forthcoming visit.Britagent, Sharjah.

The shaikh, 4 s immediate thought appeared to be to dispossess himself ot the looted camels as quickly as possible end shaikh Rashid came to Agency ano expressed his willingness ana desire to oo so. he could do nothing, however, until the sheikh of Abu shabi replied to the letter from the shaikhs of sharjah and Res-ral-Khaimah conveying their offer of mediation. 3. , In accordance with your verbal instructions I disposed of uubaii share (30 1b) of the last quota of piecegoods by distributing it among the other sheikhdoms, shaikh oeia immediately wrote to me saying that he was coming to see me. He was, however, unable to come at the appointed time (the morning of the 23rd of March; as he was indisposed but sent his son shaikh Rashid, he opened the conversation by asking me wl-y (iovemment was displeasec with uubaii I told him, as 1 have many times before, that by sending armed men by sea to occupy khor vihanadhah he had violated the Treaty with his Majesty's Government and that by looting the Abu Dhabi camels he had broken his promise to his Majesty's Government to keep the peace, he said that, he was prepared to go anything that Government required of him and asked lor my advice as to how he could appease brovernment and restore uubai to former. 4. i told him that he was perfectly aware of the Government attitude and that the first requirement was lor him to restore the situation ano settle the looting incident with Abu Dhabi. l explained that the manner in which the matter was settled was the responsibility of the shaikh .of uubei ana that the sooner he could inrorm Government that he had done so, the better it would be for him. He said that his only desire was to satisfy Government and that he would do anything to please therri. he was now doin t his best to settle the matter but could co nothing until shaikh shakhbut had replied to the offer of mediation. The shaikhs of sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah had sent a reminder but still no reply was forthcoming. b. he asked me it i knew why shaikh shakhbut hao tailed to reply and 1 told him briefly what l thought his attitude was and eadea that it would not surprise me if he rejectee the offer. 1 explained that neither he nor the would-be mediators knew what shaikh shakhbut's ettituoe really was and that it would not be known until someone went to Abu Dhabi sne discussed the matter with him. He agreed that either the shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah or the sheikh of sharjah should have gone to Abu Dhabi or at least sent a responsible person with the letter to discuss the matter. He/ts]-e then went on to sey that he he.d reason to suspect the £&gt;iiciik.hs of' jjhprjah ana al-j^heimsh ot not really v.o.ntin^ the niatter to be settlea. They realised that j^ubai haa incurred Government * s displeasure and that pressure was so bein^, brought to force him to make a settlement with Abu ijhebi. do long as the matter remained unsettled Government's displeasure would continue and the shaikhs ot K£&amp;“S-l-Kbeimeh and t&gt;harjah were secretly pleased at pubai‘s predicament and might well try ano prolong it. I am inclined to agree with this observation but i replied to the effect that he knew his brother bhuiKhs better than i dio and that if they failed, then presumably ^lia ikh j^aid voulo call upon someone else to mediate, he asked me if Government would object ii the shaikhs of ym-e1-^eiwain and Ajmen offerred to mediate ano i replied that there would be no objection but that it must be clearly understood that it was ghaikh raid’s responsibility to £,et the ca£e settled and that Government was not concerned with the actual procedure adopted. 6. He then raised the question of the piecegooos and asked why this sanction hac been applied. 1 replied that it was a sign of Government's displeasure and was one of many that could be applied, he asked if the piecegooos would be released after he had settled with Abu Dhabi and l explained that uubai's share of the quota had already been disposed of arid that permits had oeen issued on the merchants concerned in favour of other ghaikhooms. This sanction was well timed,coming as it did just after the political Kesident's visit ano was a definite shock to the ohoikh of Dubai* 7. The next day 24th of itarch ; shaikh gaio came to see me with shaikh Ksshio. ; he apologised for not tdhg £ tie to come on the day before anc said that he bed come because he was net quite satisfied with the result of his 600*8 interview with me. he naively asked me what he had done to incur the displeasure of his Lajesty's Government end 1 more or less repeated what 1 had said to Shaikh heshid. he raised the same points and i made the same replies, he said that he admitted his breach cl the Treaty by moving armed men by see to occupy Ahor ghanadheh and now asked Government to forgive him. This is worthy of note as it is the first time that be has ever really admitted iis breach of the Treaty, le said that he was not satisfied with the results of the efforts of the shaikhs of Kee-el-nhaimah and gharjah to mediate between him and the shaikh of Abu uhati and the discussions followed more or less the same lines as those with his son on the previous day. During the interview, the news arrived that- the sheikh of Sharjah had received a reply from Shaikh shakhbut to the effect that he was not prepared no accept any offer of mediation, shaikh seia askea me what he should co and 1 said that the only advice 1 could give him was to get the case settled as soon as possible, he said that he was only too anxious to settle the case in view of Government's attitude but he was powerless to oo so if shaikh shakhbut reiused to accept any offer of mediation. 1 asked him if the only way of settling the case was by mediation and he replied that tribal custom permittee of no other course. 1 tele him that he should continue with his efforts anc that if he failed, Government, in ccnsideing the matter would probably take into account the question of whether or no y t he had cone all in his power to effect a settlement. 8. he then raised the question of the piece^oocs and said that his prestige haa suffered as a result of being deprived of Lis share of the quota. Dubai receives 30% of the quota of which 10# is placed at the disposal of the shaikh for cistribJjDion to the bedouins, re issues permits to the merchants on this 10#. He informed me that he hsc been issuing permits but that the merchant^ had not honoured them and had returned them with the remarks that Dubai's share of the quota had been disposed of. This,h§ said, had blackened his lace in the eyes of the merchantage Lai public ^ general and he begged&gt; /'V A (ioveminent not to apply any more sanctions in viev- oi bis to effect e settlement* 9 . j^fter his departure the fc&gt;Laikh of bbarjah came tc see me ana sLowea me the letter he had received from shaikh bhakhbut* It v» 8 S polite and brief saying that he was not prepared to accept an offer ol mediation* he askea me vhet he should co aria i explained that he should consult the shaikh of uubc i* 1 also remarked that until someone knew shaikh t&gt;h£khbut*s reasons ior rejecting the offer ana had discussed the matter with him there appeared to be little frope of a speedy settlement, he agreed ana said that when the shaikh of K&amp;s-fel-hhaimsh arrived, they would, in consultation with the she; ikh of jjubai ceciae which of them (the mediators; should go to Abu jjhabi. 10* On the 25th of March the shaikh of ajmen came to see me® Although he denied it, i knew that he hao been approached by the Shaikn of tiubsi as a possible mediator, he askea me if boveminent had any objection to his dispute* 1 explained the anyone who brought about a good thing* mediating in the uubai-Abu uhabi- situation to him briefly ana said that an amicable settlement would be aoing 11; On the 26th of me. - he informed me that of Ajman ana bm-al-^aiwa.in as mediators bnaikhs in all- March shaikh Keshid again came to see they now proposed to co-opt the shaikhs i*e* four Trucial 12i. it will be seen therefore the t the jjubai-Abu ilxSbi dispute is causing considerable interest on the irucial coast ana that the shaikh of tubei appears to be aoing his best to comply with oovemment's orders to settle it. The intervention of four irucial shaikh's may prevail upon shaikh shakhbut to accept an offer of mediation but personally I am inclined to ooubt their chances of success, shaikh shakhbut is a stubborn man and as i have explained in my memorandum unoer reterence, he consicers himself very much the aggrieved party, as indeed he is, and has refrained from taking active retaliatory measures against uubai only out of his respect ior government wishes, i have made several inquiries regarding the uribel customary law now involved and have ascertained that meci&amp;tion, if accepted, will merely result in the looted camels being returned anc the restoration of friendly relations between the two shaikhs. The tribal law apparently ooes not envisage the payment of damages or compensation, shaikh shakhbut therefore, having been the victim of two deliberate unprovoked acts of agression ana hving taken no retaliatory action in the belief the t uhe shaikh of uubai would be severely punished by Government. r will not now readily agree to^settlement. The bhaikh of uibai realises this end he also realises that he has everything to gain by a speedy settlement. The shaikh of Abu a^habi, however, has nothing to gain. If he agrees to a straightforward mediation he will merely receive beck the looted camels, by agreeing he will be pleasing and helping the shaikh of uubei who. he knows, has been called upon by uoveinment to settle the case. This offer of mediation therefore may well result in deadlock. The shaikh o± uubai will say that he has done his best to comply with the wishes of government but that the ste ikh of Abu Dhabi refuses to accept any offer of mediation* if the situation reaches this stage it will not perhaps be reasonable for us to continue to take action against the shaikh of Dubai for his failure to settle the dispute, hor will it, in my opinion, he fair to call upon the shaikh of Abu Dhabi to accept the offer or mediation if the conditions are as i have explained. The bhaikh of Dubai has been called upon to restore the situation by resort to normal tribal custom and this, as jl have explained, only appears to entail the return of the camels. Continual pressure through the medium of sanctions after ohe shaikh of Abu Dhabi flat refusal to accept mediation might imply that we expected the shaikh of Dubai .to deviate from normal tribalJk &gt; custom end approach the shaikh of ivbu uhfehi as shall i ea^a suppliant for forgiveness. The bhaikh of puba/^oula in my opinion never a^ree to ‘lose tsce« to this exten . v . . f ee i therefore that the case may eventually v.ell be*referred to us lor settlement ana l think both pfcfbfes would welcome a government decision on U e not perhaps restore friendly relations between tubai ^na . ^ Abu Dhabi but each party would be able to sa^ th fc .t iC ;- - r-a^Dona to the wishes ot (joverrfuent and thtS, woul^ be ^Ustiea Xi such a Station ax-ose .hereby gvernment f«ou?6 recomenS briefly of course, thet x^i be xsstructea to return the camels ana pay damages to the extent ol not le.w than one lakh of rupees. to L4 occur 1 nvill report future oevelopments es enc vhen they /-v political icer, Truj coast, ohai-jah•COUFIDEHTIAL No.C/357.

Shaikh Shakhbut however remains adamant and refuses -to meet or settle under any circumstances. .His attitude is one of extreme bitterness against Dubai not only on account of Khor Ghnaadha and looting incidents but also, according to him, because of particularly vicious intrigues including bribery of his personal guard and a plot for his assass ination. 3.

I shall be prepared to discuss the matter when I come to Bahrain. Political Officer, True oast, Sharjah.On the 17th April I went to see Shaikh SaiM bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai, in order to find out if he has X f anything to say before ny departure to Abu Dhabi. He said he had nothing to say besides what had been agreedto already and that he will send word to his son Rashid to c oirie back from the desert and meet me in Dubai on my way to Abu Dhabi the following day. Accordingly, Rashid met met at Za’bil and requested me to wait a little until he could go and bring his father who had something to say. A short while later both Shaikh Said and Rashid arrived and informed me that there was no objection to Said meeting Shaikh Shakhbut half-ny between Dubai and Abu Dhabi but that they are not willing to hand over the Abu Dhabi camels except after the meeting. I told them that they had already agreed to hand over the camels first and then attend the meeting and that the P.A.Bahrain has been informed accordingly and has sent in his approval to this course and that it is very bad for them to change their word every now and then. They said that the camels will be handed over in any case and that it makes no difference if this is done after the meeting. I replied that this makes a great difference and that I am not going to act on what they say now and that if they insisted on this condition I would prefer to return to Sharjah and report their unoefitting attitude. After much persuation^however, they agreed to the course proposed after which I proceeded to Abu Dhabi. ^ ' I arrived at Abu Dhabi on the 18th April and met Shaikh Shakhbut at his Fort immediately on my arrival. I was then conducted to the Quest House where, a short while later, Shaikh Shakhbut came and visited me, accompanied by his brother Khalid and maternal uncle Hamid bin Buti. 2) I handed over to him a letter embodying the suggestion made for holding a meeting at which he and the Shaikh of Dubai may be present for the purpose of reaching2 a settlement. He read it and made no comments. Next morning he again visited me and broached the subject in a rather excited manner. He said that he entirely disagreed with any proposal for his meeting Shaikh Said even if the latter came to him in person, as he considered any agreement concluded with Shaikh Said will have no value so long as he has proved treacherous and that he never be expects Shaikh Said to/a sincere friend once more after committing all those deliberate and unprovoked acts of aggression against him. He added that he had decided and planned to take action against Shaikh Said and deal with him in the same way that he had done. I explained to him that this.attitude of his was not a wise one and that so long as Shaikh Said was desirous of coming to an amicable settlement with him there was no reason why he should feject this offer which has met with Government's approval. He said that he respects Government orders ^nd is always prepared to comply with them but that he cannot tolerate any longer the hostile and subversive activities of Dubai, some of which are perpetrated openly and some \ secretly. He added that the Shaikh of Dubai, apart from hitting his prestige very hard, had even attempted a plot for his assasination and that he does not feel at rest of mind as long as the Shaikh of Dubai has ambitions in Abu Dhabi. He said that he had resolted to use force against Dubai and get rid of his intrigues. I insisted on him that he should not believe false rumours and exxaggerated reports most of which are fabricated stories and that having obeyed Government's orders all along, it is not in his interest to adopt an attitude by which he might incur Government's displeasure and create a state of unrest on the Trucial coast. He repeated that he has and will always obey Government's orders and will not cause any harm to Government's interests and that any3 IJ&amp; action that he mi^ht take will be directed against Dubai ondy and that this will not lead to any st&amp;te of unrest on the other Trucial Shaikhdoms. The discussion ended at this stage, and in the afternoon he again visited me and this time T opened the subject and asked him if he had changed his mind and reconsidered the matter. He said he still maintained his former attitude and that he was not prepared to accept the offer made as it will not solve the problem. I said to him that the Shaikh of Dubai has now atfcetched his hand asking for a peaceful settlement and I do not see any reason why he should not do likewise and fa^art forget the past. He said he is loath to put his hand into such a filthy and criminal hand as that of the Shaikh of Dubai who does not mind using dishonourable means to attain his aims. He added that he waited a long time merely out of renpect to Governments orders to him not to take any retaliatory action and maintain the status quo and that time has come that he should take proper action against the Shaikh of Dubai who had flouted Government's orders on more than one occasion and committed pre-meditated acts of aggression against him. He said it is not his habit to do things by treachery *nd deceit and that he is going to take this action as he is the aggrieved party and his prestige will further suffer if he waited any longer and took no action to put an end to the intrigues and troubles which the Ruler of Dubai has been creating for him. He said that he has called the tribes and made all the necessary arrangements to take action against Dubai which he is not going to cancel. Li T met him more than six times on the following three days and on each occasion I used to advise him by various ways to change his mind and accept a peaceful settlement with Dubai but he did not show any inclinationto follow the advice and was determined to carry out his plans. In every meeting he used to repeat that he held no more confidence in the Ruler of Dubai for he is accustomed to treachery in dealing with others and that no agreements or treaties would deter him from achieving his ends by way of treachery and tricks. £ ' He Ssid that the Shaikh of Dubai had done numerous harmful acts against him. some of v/hich are as follows ^ ^ He had sent to Abu Dhabi one of his relatives named Khalifah bin Majid with a sun of Rs.17000/- to bribe his guards and followers and the money was secretly paid out. Most of the leading inhabitants of Abu Dhabi were promised substantial amounts varying from Rs.3000 to 4000 to each if they betrayed the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in the event of an attack by Dubai. That alarming and anonymous messages were circulated round describing some of his loyal men as treacherous and dangerous in the hope that Shaikh Shakhbut might take action against them or expel them from the country; thus causing a break in his line. That he induced Abu Dhabi citizens to quit Abu Dhabi and settle in Dubai where they will be given monetary help and nicely treated. He bribed the door-keeper of Shaikh Shakhbut T s Fort through some of his relatives whom he had called from the interior of Oman in order that the door-keeper might open the gate for Dubai people should they launch a sudden attack on the Fort. Shaikh Khalid said that the Abu Dhabi force composed of 1800 men under the command of:- 1. Hazza f - Shaikh 7 s brother. 2. Zayid - TT ' 3. Said - n son 4. Mohd bin ) Khalifah ) ' ' cousin moved from Baraimi on or about the 15th April and reached Bu Jffarmah ( a water well approximately 30 miles north-east of Baraimi) on the 21st April and is expected to move- 5 - further on towards Dubai territory. He said it consists of tribesmen from the A1 Bu Shamis(under Muhammad bin Salmin bin Rahmah who had already declared his hostility to Dubai), the Manasir, Awamir, Duru T (under Ali bin Hilal), Nai f m -(under Humaifl bin Rashid bin Hamdan), Matar bin Salim of Dhank, Shaikh of Daut, etc., and that the Wahibah and Janabah are expected to join shortly. / I am informed that Shaikh Shakhbut had been making secret preparations for action against Dubai since the time of P.R’s visit to Abu Dhabi, i.e., on the 12th March . He had rallied the support of most of the tribes friendly to him ; some of whom have old feuds against Dubai. He had been sending two thirds of the food supplies he draws from Dubai to the tribesmen at Buraimi. He had also sent arms and ammunition and also money from Abu Dhabi. ( I am informed that two d^ays before my arrival he sent Rs. 12000). He tried to buy rifles from Qatar buy only succeeded in getting 12 rifles only-. During ray at Abu Dhabi I noticed men from Liwa in groups (pf 40 to 50 persons were coming to Abu Dhabi. Those who had arms with them had been i retained while the rest who had none were allowed to go to the diving. • ^ The guards of the To]er at the creek informed me that Shaikh Shakhbut had given them instructions not to allow Shaikh Said to cross and that I may be allowed to do so. This order was issued following incorrect news reaching Abu Dhabi that I was going to be accompanied by Shaikh Said.

After Compliments. I beg to inform you that the Residency Agent, Sharjah, Mr.Jasim bin Muhammad, came to me and informed me that Tour Honour desires that a meeting should be held at which the Ruler of Dubai and myself should be present for the settlement of the dispute existing between us in the presence of the Residency Agent. With my due respect to G-overhment orders and wishes, the compliance of which I consider a great honour to me, I would like to inform Your Honour that I cannot accept this suggestion which you have so kindly made for the following reasons Firstly: The Ruler of Dubai committed two acts of unprovoked aggression against me without any warning and for no fault on my part. Secondly: The Buler of Dubai committed aggression by treachery and betrayal using every vile and low means with the object of harming my prestige^ annihilating me and occupying my territory? all to satisfy his unlimited greediness. Thirdly: For the above reasons which are facts beyond any doubt, I wish to inform Your Honour that I do not feel a desire to meet the Ruler of Dubai even if he came himself to my place nor do I like to enter into any agreement with him so long as he has developed the habit of treachery and disregard to pledges and agreements. I can place no confidence in any agreement or compromise that may be concluded with him as he does not respect them and does not appreciate them; he follows his own interests and does what he likes without giving any consideration to pledges and agreements ±t even if they had been concluded through the Government. Everyone who had studied the history of Dubai knows this fact.Therefore, Your Honour, I find myself constrained to deal with the Ruler of Dubai in the same way he had dealt with me and I request you not to blame me if I took my rights from him myself. I assure Your Honour that neither the interests of the G-overnment nor those of their subjects will be subjected to any harm by me. Usual HndingTelegram S(Pad). From Political Agent, Bahrain.

Despite continual promises from Shaikh Said and his son Rashid that they will return the camels and settle the dispute they have, in fact, taken no active steps and when I volunteered to allow the Residency Agent to take Shaikh Juma to Shakhbut to arrange settlement Said changed his mind at the last moment and refused. Later he volunteered to return the camels and to meet Shaikh Shakhbut at a neutral place in the desert. After the departure of the Residency Agent ,to arrange a meeting he again changed his mind. It is, therefore, quite clear that Said is still refusing to make a genuine effort to end the matter. 3. The situation has now changed in that it has come to light that Dubai is plotting against Abu Dhabi and spent Rs.17,000 in bribes. Shakhbut, therefore, has now written to me saying that the matter has become a personal one and that he wishes to force a settlement in his own fashion. He promises that British interests shall not be adversely affected. 4* It is likely that small skirmishes by armed tribes will take place in the desert and I do not see, in view of Shaikh Said*s intrigues, that I can usefully intervene or that any course which I can adopt will bring about a settlement. I propose to tell Said that Govt, still expects him to restore the situation and I shall also enforce stricter sanctions. 5. The Locust Party and the P.C.L.

Most respectfully I write to inform your Honour that I hate the spilling of blood but I have been compelled to do so by the Ruler of Dubai through his acts of treachery and for the sake of preserving my honour and ensuring the safety of my country* I tolerated for a long time the innumerable undesirable acts perpetrated by him which only led to an increase in his highhandedness and unceasing acts of aggression. T lost patience and have been cotopelled to use force against him as he does not abstain from his evil acts except by dealing with him in this way and any cpurse for a peaceful settlement will not bring about any result. 0 1 Your Honour! I highly appreciate your desire for averting the spilling of blood but as I have already explained it is impossible to arrive at a peaceful settlement with these people who hold no respect for pledges nor fulfil obligations; they use these, when opportunity offers itself, to stab their friends in the back. Our friend Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid came to me and kindly offered to mediate for a peaceful settlement but I do not see any good in doing so for the reasons I have already mentioned. I thank him for taking the trouble to come tom© and I also thank Your Honour for the good intentions which you have shown towards me and towards the human beings whose blood the Ruler of Dubai will cause to be spilled.

I bring to Your Excellency^ notice about incident made by people of Abu Dhabi on 1st Jamad al-Thani 1365 (2-5-46) on five persons of our people who went for patrolling in a place named '’Al-Rakhaimat’', which is in our territory. The enemy attacked and fired at them, whereupon three persons of our people were killed and five camels also, although we had not caused them the least harm. We would like to bring it to your A.G information.4^ 22/,i5. Telegram S(Pad) From Political Agent, Bahrain, at Sharjah To Political Resident Bushire Bated the 5th May, 1946 No.TC/6. IMM1DIATB (TBLBX) , My telegram No,154 April 28th. 2. On arrival at Sharjah 1 asked Shaikh of Dubai to consider making further endeavour to settle the quarrel- and consequently it was arranged that Shaikh of Umm al Qawain should proceed to Abu Dhabi with powers to negot iate. At the last moment Dubai withdrew offer to pay compensation and thereby once again wrecked any chance of settlement. Uram al ^awain has now returned and reports as was expected that Abu Dhabi declines mediation. 3. We have taken all reasonable steps to avoid bloodshed and after this last effort I remain of the opinion that the best course is to let the parties fight it out. If you howevet think that this is undesirable we must order Dubai to pay compensation return the camels and withdraw his men. Abu Dhabi would be ordered to accept compensation (which he has now told me. twice he does not want to do) and to withdraw his forces. Parties might refuse to obey and though this is unlikely we should have to be prepared to enforce orders which I personally do not think warranted in a dispute over camels. Further if we do order withdrawal etcetra we shall be supporting Dubai (who does not want to fight) and this in spite of his deceitful and uncompromising attitude and his failure to accept id our and Arab advice to settle the matter peacefully long ago. 4. Probably merely desert skirmishes entailing casualities will take place and that the weakened party will approach us for intervention when we could comply. Should events take another course we should have to reconsider at the time. 5. I think I should write to both parties expressing strong disapproval and holding them responsible for any harm to British subjects interests and property* Grateful for very early instructions = GALLOWAY = LEI(iss; Telegram - a.T.C.

'S'?; Reference correspondence ending with your telegram No.722, dated the 6 th May, 1946^ 2. I informed Shaikh Said that as he had not been able to accept the advice given to him regarding the settlement of the dispute, and since he had failed to keep his word and that of his son Rashid given personally to me I could take no further action to protect his interests in the dispute with Abu Dhabi. I told him that he should proceed to settle it in Arab fashion as he had requested to be allowed to do, and to which end we have been assist ing him. The following day he sent his son Rashid to say that he regretted the action he had taken; he saw that he was in the wrong, and he earnestly requested me to assist him out of the difficulty. I said that I would again refer to you provided that he satisfied me that on this occasion he really was in earnest in his desire to settle the dispute, in the evening he sent his son Rashid with two lakhs of rupees in the form of drafts which he wanted paid to Abu Dhabi as compensation by the Residency Agent. He said he would undertake to return the camels, and withdraw his men as soon as he was ordered to do so. 4* It is clear that Shaikh Said is anxious not to fight and I also would rather not let these two sheikhdoms resort to arms and indeed have been at considerable pains to that end. Now that^ Shaikh Said is prepared to pay compensa tion to Abu Dhabi Suggest that I may permit the Residency Agent to negotiate for Shaikh Said for the acceptance of the compensation, the return of the camels and the dispersal of the armed men of both parties. 5. . As regards the sum Dubai has suggested as compensation it is difficult to estimate how much had been expended by Abu Dhabi, but I am sure that the sum of two lakhs should amply compensate Shaikh Shakhbut. The sum is a large sum, but I do not think it is too large, for it is necessary that the Dubai Shaikhs should be taught a lesson which they will remember for a long time. The sum is for them to settle themselves. I shall be grateful for instructions if I may ask the Residency Agent to arrive at a settlement on the basis of the conditions mentioned in paragraph 4 above. An immediate reply is requested since the armed bedouin are reported to be within 40 miles of each other. ATTESTED. Sd./- A.C.

I explained to him that item (d) was a hard terra and T was certain that if he insisted on it, it would lead to the failure of the negotiations. He said that the reasons for making it are because (a) his camels had been badly handled by Dubai and part of thenr had already been disposed of and (b) he does not wish that Dubai should own any immovable property in his country for fear of vicious intrigues in future. I told him that even then I did not consider this was justified and that it was not advisable for him to make a claim that would be an obstacle in the wav of reaching a settlement. He said that he would write to his brother Hazza f and ask him to carry out the negotiations on his behalf through the Shaikh of Uram al Oaiwain and will give him full powers to do whatever he considers necessary in reaching a permanent settlement. On the eve of my departure he handed over to me a sealed cover addressed to Hazza and another cover addressed to the Shaikh of Umm al Oaiwain. I left Abu Dhabi on the 14th May reaching Sharjah the same day. Soon after my arrival I telegraphed to P.A. giving a brief account of what hed happened and asked for instructions to take action. On the 16th May I received information that Abu Dhabi forces had advanced SO miles .and were camping at Mihdatha and Yidasnrah, the last named place being only I 10 miles from Dubai’s -positions. T immediately A, ’ despatched a letter to Hazza disapproving of his action in disobeying the orders not to advance and impressing ,1 on him to stay where he was and take no hostile action against Dubai till the receint of further instructions . On 17th May on receipt of instructions from ‘ the/-3 Q]®) the ^.A. to take action as suggested by me, I went to Dubai and informed the Shaikh of the action I was going to take, He said he did not consider any further action wgw* necessary as far as he was concerned and that as long as he had paid compensation and agreed to return the camels he did not see why he should now enter into negotiations with Abu Dhabi, T told him that this new course has been approved by P.A. and that he should better do what he is asked to. He remained arguing for some time,putting up strong onposition to this new course but later, when T pointed out to him the undesirability of his attitude which will do him no good, he agreed to enter into negotiations. On the 18th May I proceeded to Timm al Qaiwain and handed over to the Shaikh the Ruler of Abu Dhabi T s letter which contained his renuest to him to act as a go-between. Shaikh of TTmm al Qaiwain told me that if this request had govt’s approval he would gladly agree to act otherwise not. t toldJifWit had. T then, arranged with him that both he and myself will go to Dubai in the afternoon of that day and start discussions with the Shaikh of Dubai. As arranged we arrived at Dubai at the tine f: rod and met the Shaikh. The Shaikh of Dubai again expressed his unwillingness to enter into any negotiations and continued to say that he had already settled the matter with the P.A. by paying compensation and promising to return the camels and that he was not going to hear the terms of Abu Dhabi. T told him that these W ere P.A’s orders and he v/as bound to obey then. After a somewhat lengthy discussion, he agreed to the proposal and when the terms were read to him he flatly rejected all of them with the exception of compensation whidh he had already paid. Discussion ended at midnight and was resumed the following day. After much persuation he accepted (hi but rejected (c) and (d). His reason for declining/-declining to accept (c) is that the Arabs of Abu Dhabi and 'nubai were of the same tribe, Beni Yas, and it, is unfair to shut the door in the face of miserable persons coming to his to v m for the purpose of earning a livelihood. He admitted affording facilities and help to such people but denied that the motive behind this was to cause harm to Abu Dhabi. As regards (d) he said it v/as grave injustice and he would not agree to it under any circumstances. He claimed the crops of his date-gardens which were confiscated by Abu Dhabi and his camels which ho alleges that Abu Dhabi had looted. We managed to make the Shaikh of Dubai forego both these claims. The Shaikh of Timm al oaiwain and myself then decided to visit Shaikh Hazza 1 at his camp and start negotiations with him. On the 19th *'ay I sent a message to Shaikh Hazza informing him that the Shaikh of Timm al Oaiwain and myself were coning to meet him on the 20th May at his camp at Yidayyah and instructed the messenger to wait for us with Hazza T s reply at Dubai T s camp at Bahayis near Jabal Fayah. The Shaikh of TJmm al Qiwain and myself, accompanied by shaikh Bashid of Dubai, proceeded by car to Bahayis on the morning of the 20th May and on arrival there, the messenger informed us that he could not deliver the message as Abu Dhabi T s forces had moved the previous day to an unknown destination. We then sent the message by car which reached as far as Hamlet Anaij and from there it was taken by camel to Safwan about 60 miles farther away and was delivered to Shaikh Hazza f . This withdrawal came as a result of the letter which T sent to Hazza and was also due to the fact that he wanted to camp at a place with enough pasturage for his camels and to be nearer to Abu Dhabi from where he expected more food supplies. He sent me a reply agrbeing to the meeting and fixing Saturday the/-5 the 25th May at Yidayyah the nearest place where he had previously camped, I sent him another message agreeing to the date fixed by him but, in order that he should be as far from Dubai’s positions as possible, suggested Hamlat Anaij to be the meeting place. stayed with Shaikh 'Rashid at Bahayis spending the night there. In the morning of the 21st I left for Sharjah. The ShaiKh of Unm al Qatwain also left the same day for Umm al 0diwain. I received Hazza’s reply on the 22nd liay \ confirming the arrangements made. Dubai’s forues have taken up three positions; Habab, Naz\Va and Bahayis, the last named lies at the western foot of Jabal Fayah. It may be interesting to know that as soon as we had decided to go.out to meet Hazza via Bahayis, Shaikh Bashid of Dubai sent word to his men at Nazwa to come to Bahayis. His object in doing so was to show us that he had many men at arms. His men at Bahayis numbered 150 whereas those who had come from Nazwa did not exceed 80.

Shaikh of Umm al Qawain and myself proceeded to Dubai on May 28th and submitted to Shaikh Said a draft settlement agreement containing terms already agreed to by him but he refused to approve of it and asked for time to think over the matter and consult his people. This morning he gave me a letter conveying his acceptance of the said terms but added a fresh condition whereby Shaikh of Abu Dhabi should not interfere with movable and immovable properties of Abu Dhabi subjects situated in Abu Dhabi territory if and when they wish to immigrate into Dubai. This is against usage prevailing in Abu Dhabi since the old days and would not be accepted by Shaikh of Abu Dhabi under any circumstances. By imposing this condition Shaikh of Dubai undoubtedly aims at encouraging immigration into Dubai of Abu Dhabi subjects and thus causing harm to Abu Dhabi interests. We spared no efforts to persuade Shaikh of Dybai to give up this condition and be content with free movements of both his and Abu Dhabi subjects but he stubbornly refused. By adopting such an uncompromising attitude he has wrecked another chance of a peaceful settlement especially when it reached a final stage. 3.

We delivered to him Shaikh Shakhbut f s letter and informed him of the object of our visit. He showed the letter to his brother Zayid and in the presence of Zayid, his cousih Muhammad bin Khalifah and other members of the family, stated that it was very difficult for him to accept a peaceful settlement with Dubai now after innumerable acts of treachery committed against them. That the orders he had received from us not to advance but to stay where he was until further intimation came as a shock to him and that he obeyed them out of respect to G-ore rnment. We explained to him that Shaikh Shakhbut had already agreed to come to a settlement with Dubai and that we expected him to do his best to achieve that object. He said he will think over the matter and let us know, of his decision later in the evening. As promised, he visited us in the evening, accompanied by Zayid and Muhammad bin Khalifah. He said that in compliance with Government wishes and as a sign of respect to the Shaikh of Umm al Qaiwain he agreed to come to,-a settlement with Dubai nrovided that all the terms imposed by Shakhbut are {Signature) accepted. Shaikh of TTmn al Qaiwain told him that most of the terms were accepted by Dubai with the e^^^^op^of the question of immigration/- c , | 1 1o.^u^ - 2 - immigration and Dubai’s date-gardens. As regards the former 'he considered it not so important now as the incentive for the immigration has ceased with the diminition of profits obtained during the war in Dubai, and for the latter it was very difficult for the Puler of Dubai to accept as it is an unfair demand and he should therefore give it up and be content with the return of the camels. Hazza r insisted on these two terms but when I pointed out to him the advisability of his co-operation in reaching a settlement as desired by his brother Shakhbut, he agreed and gave up both these demands. He had, however, raised the question of the frontier and said that if the Government were not going to decide it themselves, he wanted the Ruler of Dubai to admit that the boundary runsfrom Jabal Ali leaving Khor Ghanadha within Abu Dhabi territory. T told him that this is a quite separate issue and he will be informed in due course. We spent the night in the desert and next morning he gave us an assurance of the arrangements arrived at. He then discussed with the Shaikh of Timm al Qaiwain and the tribal chiefs the position of the independent tribes vis-a-vis Dubai /T In and they arrived at a settlement according to tribal manner, w© then left and promised Hazza T to visit him again either on 28th or 29th May with the final settlement agreement for his signature. I went straight to Sharjah but the Shaikh of l Xjmri al qaiwain proceeded to Dubai and informed Shaikh Rashidthab there was a strong hone of a final settlement being arrived S./ol at. T then sent you my telegram No.569 of 26th May 1946. 5. On receipt of your telegram No. 184 dated ZTfth \ May 1946, T proceeded to Hmm al Oaiwain and arranged with the Shaikh to visit the Ruler of Dubai on 28th May. Accordingly, we met the Shaikh of Dubai and handed over to him a draft agreement containing the terms'already agreed to by him. He read it and showed it to his son Rashid, ^hen they said the# wanted to think over it and let us know their decision Inter/-later. They held several meetings at which Shaikh Jama’h and other meribers oi* the family and retinue attended; Shaikh of TTirrn al qaiwain taking part in some of them. Later he told us that he confirms his acceptance of tho terms hut is goin^ to impose one condition whereby the Hu 1 er of Abu Dhabi ✓ should not interfere with the movable and immovable property of his subjects if and when they wish to immigrate into Dubai and that he will also do the same in respect of Dubai subjects immigrating into Abu Dhabi. Both Shaikh of Umm al qaiwain and myself told him that this is quite unacceptable to the Ruler of Abu Dhabi -nd would straightway be refused by him and that it was very bad for him to put such an impracticable demand now when/were reaching the last stages towards a settlement. He then asked for time till the following morning in order to be able to consult his brother Juma T h and other persons with whbm he could not get into touch that evening. T returned to Sharjah at night leaving Shaikh of TTrnm al qaiwain at Dubai. Next morning I again went to Dubai and after waiting for two hours at the Shaikh’s camp at Za T abil, he, accompanied by his son Rashid, cane from the town and told us that they thought over the matter fully'and arrived at a final decision which is contained in a letter addressed to me. He then handed over the letter ’ lestion to me a translation of which is enclos _ me told him that the terms mentioned in the letter are the same as those already agreed upon with the exception of a new condition regarding property of immigrants which we had advised him to leave out. W e added saying as this is a great obstacle in the way of reaching a settlement, we are still where we are. He replied that that was the last thing he could agree to and was nt&gt;t prepared to make any change. I then advised him not to adopt this attitude as it does him no good and will definitely lead to the frustration of all our efforts we /?? which/I ^ - 4 r= -&gt;■ which have so far net with success but for this new condition which T considered unnecessary and not very important to him . but he still refused and said he would not agree unless forced by Government. He added that if the Ruler of Abu Dhabi did not accept this tern., he will withdraw his acceptance* to pay compensation to him and his offer to return the camels. Shaihh of TTmn al Qaiwain used every moans to make him agree and see to reason but he persisted in his refusal and repeated saying that he was under no obligation to agree to anything beyond payment of compensation and return of the camels and that he was not interested whether a settlement with the Ruler of Abu Dhabi is reached or not. Seeing no hope in persuading him to change his mind, I returned to Sharjah in the afternoon and telegraphed to you a brief account of what had happened and gave you my and the Shaikh of TJmn al Qaivrin f s opinion of the best course to be adopted in the face of Ruler of Dubai f s unreasonable attitude. The Shaikh of Unn al Qaiwain returned from Dubai and visited me at Sharjah after sun-set. He told me that after my departure he spent a long time trying to persuade him but he adhered to his previous attitude and remained adamant. He added saying that he has been fully convinced that Ruler of Dubai proved very difficult and is deliberately preventing a peaceful settlement and that, such being his attitude, he does not whenever any Abu Dhabi subject immigrates into Dutei some other Sheikhdom, his landed property vests in the Ruler. The object of this custom which has hitherto bee^n in existence is to discourage immigration. The Ruler of Dubai realises pretty well that the Ruler of Abu Dhabi will not agree to any change in this custom under any circumstances feel inclined to act any more in this matter and begs to be relieved of it. It is a time honoured custom in Abu Dhabi that and/- /.5 IS9 yp and it is not understood why ho did not raise this question when we first started discussions with him prior to our visit to Hazza^ 5 . In view of this further development, we did not think: it worth while visiting Kazza’ again as promised hut a message has been despatched to him to-day telling him that our visit has unavoidably been postponed. 6. T cannot heln expressing how regrettable it is that when agreement on all points had been reached and a final settlement was very imminent, an obstacle by the Ruler of Dubai should, upset the whole thing and lot all our efforts and hard work for over a month go in vain. 7 . Tn the circumstances, T am of the opinion that the best course now is (a) to let the parties fight it out, and (b) impose more sanctions on Dubai with immediate stoppage of shipping. 8. Prior to our departure, Hazza arranged a parade of his forces and camel racing. I estimate his men at 2000 fully armed. They are'made up of tribesmen from the Manasir, A1 Bu Shamis, Nai’m, Duru T , Janabah, Ahbab, A'- r amir and Dhaw°hir.

Letter, original and translation, I from Ruler of Timm al Qaiwain, to I Political Agent, Bahrain. I marginally-noted correspondence on the above subject. 2. You will see clearly from the Shaikh of Dubai’s letter of the 27th May 1946 that he had accepted the terms, i.e., payment of compensation, return of the camels and giving up his claims to his camels and dates, but made no mention whatsoever of the condition which he has now imposed regarding property of immigrants. He sent me this letter after negotiations with him and Hazza had been completed and I was awaiting your orders regarding the frontier dispute. 3 # Although it is not understood why he did not make this condition before the conclusion of the negotiations, my deduction from the facts lead me to believe that he expected Hazza to make difficulties for reaching a settlement thereby deserving blame for the failure of the negotiations. As the events, however, took a course unfavourable to him, he has now come forward with this new condition with the sole object of frustrating our efforts for a peaceful settlement. The Shaikh of Dubai knows perfectly well that the Shaikh of Dhabi will not accept this condition for the following reasons:-- 2 - (a) Because it constitutes a diversion from a time-honoured custom prevailing in Abu Dhabi since a long time. (b) Should the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi agree to any .relaxation in this custom, all the inhabitants of Abu Dhabi who own landed properties there and who have not so far been able to immigrate for fear of loss of their properties, will immediately immigrate into Dubai, thereby causing considerable harm to Abu Dhabi. I asked Hamid bin Buti, maternal uncle of Shaikh Shakhbut, who was on a short visit to Sharjah, whether he thinks Shaikh Shakhbut agrees to this condition. He said he r - &gt; will never agree. 5. In my opinion Shaikh of Dubai is not Justified in demanding this condition and his insistence on it clearly indicates his desire to harm Abu Dhabi and to prevent a peaceful settlement. 6 . Abu Dhabi’s forces are still at the place where they were before awaiting orders from us. 7 # The majority of Beni Qitab tribesmen who had Joined the Shaikh of Dubai have deserted him on account of shortage in their food supplies. i L i2 °%T Translation of letter dated 9th Jamad Thani 1365 (11.5.46) from Shaikh Said bin Maktum, O.B.E., Ruler of I&gt;ibai, to the Residency Agent, Shariah.

After long consultations with his people, he informed us verbally that he was going to impose a new condition whereby the properties of Abu Dhabi subjects should not be interfered with if they wish to immigrate into Dubai. The Ruler of Abu Dhabi will never agree to this term as it contravenes the custom prevailing in his am country since olden days.

T beg to report th^t as soon as I received your telegram No. 193 of the 6th June I v/ent to the Shaikh of Dubai, handed over to him a letter from me containing your order and explained the matter to him. He said he was pleased to keep his word to you and was prepared to hand over the camels but that he did not think it advisable 'to withdraw his armed men as long as the menace of raids and attacks on Dubai by Abu Dhabi existed. He then said he will think ^over^tha question of the withdrawal of his forces and send me his reply later. In the afternoon he sent me a letter a copy of which J UJ is enclosed with translation. I then despatched to you my telegram S No 7£09 of the7th June. On receipt of your telegram No.195 of 8th June I left for Abu Dhabi on the 10th (it was not possible to go earlier as our cars were undergoing repairs)reaching the same day. T handed over to the Shaikh a letter from me containing your order and explained the situation to him. He said he did not and will never act against Government wishes and that his attitude became very clearvto the Government and that he never thought of changing this attitude ''and turning difficult. That he will, therefore, accept the t vr o lakhs, take over the camels and withdraw his forces at once. He {Signature) added saying that he will refrain from any hostile action against Dubai but that should the Ruler of Dubai, in future, commit any act (Designatim) s - 44 - which/- MFP—985 S&amp;P-(M-1597)—27 11-36—10,000.2 ( 5 ; - 2 - which he considers harmful to his interests, he will not hestitate to talce action against him and begs the G-ovemment to allow him to do so. I told him the Shaikh of Dubai has learnt a lesson and it is very unlikely that he should feel inclined to do any more harm to him. He said he did not trust the Shaikh of Dubai and that his latest attitude showed very clearly his ill-will and desire to create trouble for him. He handed over to me his reply to my letter, copies of which are enclosed with translation. I then paid him the Rs. two lakhs and obtained his receipt, copy with translation enclosed. He asured me that he will send word to his brother Hazza to withdraw his forces at once. As regards the camels, he said he had no idea as to the actual number of camels looted and that he will call for their owners who are at present in Buraimi and send them to me at Sharjah with lists of the actual number of camels to be returned. I returned to Sharjah on the 12th. T have written to-day to the Shaikh of Dubai asking him to have the camels ready so that they may be handed over to Abu Dhabi men on their arrival here after a few days. T also asked him to withdraw his forces at once. 3. Prior to the receipt of your latest orders, the Shaikhs of Ajman and Fujairah volunteered to approach the Shaikh of Dubai and persuade him to give up his demand regarding expropriation. They spent two days in Dubai trying their best but returned without meeting any success. On their return from Dubai they called on me and told me that after much persuation, the Shaikh of Dubai agreed to give up his demand concerning expropriation but put forward another demand to the effect that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi should return to him his camels and pay him the cost of his dates. That the object of the Ruler of Dubai in making these alternative demands was to avoid ’losing face’. I pointed out to them that the Shaikh of Dubai had already agreed in writing to forego his claim to his dates and camels and that, therefore, it was inappropriate for him to turn/-turn back on this claim. 4 :. The stoppage of visits of steamers to Dubai has had a shocking effect. As soon as this order became known, the merchants of Dubai went to see Shaikh Rashid bin ^aid and asked him to do something to remedy the situation as quickly as possible as the stoppage of steamer calls meant a hard blow to their trade. He told then that it was no/ concern of theirs to interfere in such matters. 5. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi informed me that on the 6th June 1946 he received a report that a Baqarah(small boat) carrving four armed men from Dubai, one named Humaid bin Said al Shiddi and the other three were sons of Bin Humudi al Maharbah of Jumairah, Dubai, was seen by some Abu Dhabi people at Khaur al Sa T adiyat and Khaur al Bighal, which are quite close to Abu Dhabi town. The Shaikh said he believed that this party had come there to survey the entrances to Abu Dhabi peninsula and thought that this might be part of a plan by the Shaikh of Dubai to launch a sudden attack on Abu Dhabi town. He remarked thdt£ this amounts to an act of aggression at sea and that he will detail guards to arrest any other party coming on a similar attempt in future and report the matter to us.Translation of letter dated 9th June 1946 from the Residency Agent, Sharjah, to Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan bin ^ayid, Ruler of Abu Dhabi.

The position when I left the Trucial Coast on 27th July was that 137 camels had been escorted by Shaikh of Dubaijmen and had reached their destination in Abu Dhabi territory. This would be Baraimi: The escort then returned to Dubai. 3. / With reference to paragraph 2 of your telegram No. 213 of 17th July 1946 I wrote a letter to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in which ^ informed him that the camels were being returned; I further stated that it was your opinion that he had now received full compensation and I invited him to consider the case closed. ( Copies ofthis letter are available in Sharjah ). I received a reply from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi thanking me for our intervention and the peaceful return ofc his looted camels. It was evident that at the time he wrote this, the camels had not actually reached the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi: they were probably still in Baraimi as they have to go through there on their way. 4.

It is possible that when these men arrive at Abu Dhabi the Shaikh may submit, a claim for these camels, though I have invited him to consider the matter closed. was obvious that they were exaggerating in their demands. 5.

It is true that the relations between Dubai ana i*bu- uhabi are not as friendly as they were before the recent troubles in fact noth sices are suspicious of each other as each of them is on the guard that he should not fall the victim of a sudden and treacherous act. It is Dubai mainly to blame for the position in which he has put himself by committing unprovoked aggression and then failing to restore the situation when asked ^ by us several times to do so. I have reason to believe that the shaikh of Dubai is still making intrigues against Abu Dhabi *s interests by promising to afford financial aiul to the tribes such as the Deni ciilsb ana the hhewatir if they continued to be hostile to Abu bhati. 3. in my opinion the best reply to give the nuler of i&gt;ubai would be that you have no objection to his endeavouring to restore friendly relations with Abu Dhabi direct without using force and at the same time inform the nuler of Abu uhabi that you have approved of the step which the j\uler of uubai is goii% to take in order to restore friendly relations with him which would be to the benefit of both of them.

Please write to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi informing him that I approve of any effort which Dubai may make to come to friendly terms; and ask him to reciprocate such efforts, and to allow free interchange and movements of Dubai and Abu Dhabi subjects between their respective territories.

From To Reference paragraph 167(iii) of my Intelligence Summary No. 15. 2 * / The Shaikh of Dubai has since put in ^ claim to the Residency Agent for 125 camels which he alleges were looted in the fight between Abu Dhabi and Dubai tribesmen at Shimairikh. &gt;(-&gt;0 ‘ I am now informed ^that this clash took place while she Abu Dhabi raiding party were encamped at Shimairikh on their way back from the Beni gitab country, and thus any damage suffered by the Shaikh of Dubai would appear to be the direct result of his unwarranted interference in the affairs of Abu Dhabi and the Beni oitab. .v S' The incidentals one covered by paragraph four of my Telegram No. 35 of the 29th January, and, ^ er o£°f 1 e ^ you have n0 ob J e ction, I propose to inform the Shaikh of Dubai that Government is not responsible for the recovery of his camels and that he should arrange for their recovery in the normal tribal manner. - * , ■ / 1 Since the Shimairikh incident took sh ? ikh of Abu Dhabi-l&amp;s agreed to make peace,- \Cu with the Beni Oitab and the Shaikh of* nnhai 7 with the Beni Qitab and the Shaikh of Dubai has once- more promised to cease interfering, between them.^ftubai a ^° e ^pressed his desire to restore friendly relations witn s,he Shaikh of Abu Dhabi., in view of this I do not anticipate any further deterioration in the situation reported in my last two Intelligence Summaries.

(a) Cases of Piracy and breaches of the Maritime Truce 1835-53 (Pages 698-700) (b) Maritime irregularities (Pages 719-726) (c) 1882 (Page 733) (d) 1892 (Page 739) It will be seen that in most cases the Resident’s orders or demands were conveyed by a ship of war and that coercive measures were used when shaikhs proved recalcitrant. The present case reveals a flagrant breach of the 1853 Treaty on the part of the Sheikh of Dubai and punishment by a heavy fine would appear to be called for. As far as can be seen he was the aggressor with no apparent right on his side, /as Ghanadhah.. ry 0 t 'IT- /^ | as Ghanadhah, from the evidence available, appears to be an Abu Dhabi possession. The Sheikh of Dubai has of course denied that he despatched his'men by sea, but it Is quite obvious that he did so. I do not, however, believe that he deliberately violated the terms of his Treaty. I am inclined to think that in occupying Ghanadhah he overlooked : his treaty obligations but that he now realizes the gravity of his action vis-a-vis H.M.G. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi being the aggrieved party will certainly expect Dubai to be called to task for this breach of the Treaty and I have no doubt that other Trucial Sheikhs are waiting to see whether or not Dubai will ’’get away with it”. Technically, there is, in my opinion, a clear case 13. for punishing Dubai and I am of the opinion that the Sheikh | would pay up if we levied a fine say of Rs.25,000/-. In view of the fact, however, that (a) in hastily asserting I . his claim to Ghanadhah the Sheikh of Dubai appears to have overlooked his treaty obligations, (b) he immediately obeyed the political Resident's demand to withdraw, (c) there does not appear to have been a deliberate breach of the Treaty, and (d) he has in recent times always been very amenable and co-operative, in fact more so than his brother sheikhs, 1 am of the opinion that we should leave*things as they are and not raise the question of punishment. Should, however, the policy be that technical breaches of the Treaties with ; H.M.G. should be followed by punishments, I would recommend a fine of Rs.25,000/-. Apart from the question of punishment, however, the I 14. problem of our future action regarding the dispute would appear to require attention. In our letters to the Sheikhs of Dubai and Abu Dhabi we have said th3t they should ’’maintain the status quo pending examination of the frontier question”. This implies, in my opinion, that we will take further action in the case to decide to which sheikhdom Ghanadhah belongs. It is perhaps reasonable to assume that ! tne sheikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dubai also interpret these words in the same manner. » I should therefore like to be briefed as to what line : 15. to take should either of the shaikhs ask me what action H.M.G. is taking to settle the boundary dispute and how long it is ; likely to 'pend”.22/15. (150) Issued telegram No.223 dated 8/8/46 to R.A. Sharjah, ns 14(2 l*(o P.O.T.G ltd.J.A.N»C• 11/8 I agree with R.A^ suggestion under para 3. I think the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi should be asked to allow A-bu Dhabi subjects to enter Buraimi to see to their date gardens, and facilitate a return to friendly relations as soon as possible. From Government point of view the dispute is settled and it is for Dubai to show whether his intention^to come to a friendly understanding with Abu Dhabi are sincere or not. in agreement with his oara 3 and that he should write to Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dubai as suggested, but to include remarks under n/para 1J0. fro / (tya***^ S' 'Si Sffx, A $ 'T&gt;I&lt;S. A reply might be given to R.A* Sharjah that you are P. A. O. P ** (y[r&gt; 138. r Ref. s.158. Shiir.airikh is near Nazwa, and from mention at page lf&gt;f^ that Duoai forces were previously encamped there it is probable that former place is also in Dubai territory. This raises question of how much of the forces on either side have not yet been withdrawn. The Shaikh of Dubai is now putting a force at Marmum (please see in this connection s.48) and we have had many reports of raiding parties of Abu Dhabi bedouin moving in or near Dubai territory. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi first disclaimed responsibility for the action of these bedouin, vide enclosure to s.30, but they were later admitted to be part of his forces, vide para 7 of s.85. If situation is as supposed and both sides have not yet withdrawn their forces it can only lead to further and more serious clashes, ^ su So es ted that we telegraph R.A. to write and remind bo^h Shaikhs of their undertakings to keep the peace and ask them to withdraw all forces not yet withdrawn. D.F.A. I. Ref. s.157. As regards Shaikh of Dubai»s.claim in respect of camels lost in the Shimairikh incident correspondence at s. 18, 38, 30, 39, 40, 44, and 80 seems relevant. We only intervened in previous looting of Abu Dhabi camels because Ox evidence that ShaiKh of Dubai had deliberately organised looting, committed a second act of aggression against Abu Dhabi, and broken the undertaking he hdd given to keep the peace. 7e consistently urged Dubai to settle the affair in the normal tribal fashion and only resorted to pressure, .stopping of travel documents, etc'., when it became clear that he was making no serious attempt to settle, and that situation was deteriorating. V/e have no evidence that Shaikh of Abu Dhabi is directly concerned in the recent looting of Dubai camels and it is not understood therefore how Shaikh of Dubai can now submit a •claim* for the camels he alleges he has lost.^ He may be told to make his peace with Abu Dhabi and thereafter arrange for restoration of camels in normal - tribal manner.
