Pelly also notes that the Sirdar makes no requests of his own and leaves it to Pelly to make whatever observations he may wish in relation to the Sirdars desire to renew friendly relations with Her Majesty's Government.The letter also discusses the plot by Shahzadeh Mahomed Reza and the manner in which this was handled by the Sirdar; observations on the cost and effect of the Afghan War; and the impact in Asia of how the British had quelled the Indian Mutiny.The letter goes on to make some recommendations in relation to the defence of the Indian Frontier; to discuss the possibility of a renewed treaty of friendship with Herat and the advantages it could provide; the potential benefits that having a British Political Agent stationed at Herat; Pelly's reasons for being opposed to the proposal of a subsidy for the Governor of Herat and his belief that a gift of arms and ammunition would be much more appropriate; and the question of the Furrah [Farah] district and its political relations with Herat.The letter goes on to submit a proposal for how the question of the Furrah district might be considered and ways in which responsibility for it could be transferred to Herat without the Indian Government conceding any territory;to discuss Sirdar Sultan Ahmed Khan's letter and his reference in to his desire to adhere to the terms of the Treaty of Paris; and discussing the Sirdar's connections with Persia and Pelly's belief that they now carry little weight.The letter also discusses Herat's relations with Caubul [Kabul] and Candahar [Kandahar]; the situation the Sirdar found himself in on being appointed to govern an impoverished territory demolished by a grievous war that has been subject to endless intrigues; the agricultural and commercial improvements the Sirdar has since made to the territory; and commenting on the work of Hussein Ali Khan, Minister at Herat.The letter contains numerous crossings out, corrections and addendums including additional paragraphs and notes in the margins.
