I forward the following two statements:- Statement 'A” showing the Capital cost of Government buildings in the Persian Gulf and the expenditure incurred during the past ten years on account of petty, ordinary and special repairs on each. Statement 'B' shov/ing the increased allowances that would be necessary if the percentage rates for ordinary and special repairs were raised to 2-J % and respectively. With the exception of Bahrein the existing allotments for petty and ordinary repairs seem sufficiently adequate for the present and having regard to the present financial crisis I do not propose to apply fox’ increased Budget * provision. 3. An increase in the allotment for ordinary repairs to the Bahrein Agency is, however, essential, and with regard to this I am addressing the Government of India separately. enclosure !N NDIA FOREIGN SECRETArtfb Utter Dated 7 JAN 1932 MlProm - The Under Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department.

From the figures mentioned in Statement , B f forming an enclosure to your memorandum No.1529, dated the 23rd ouly 1931, it is not quite clear how the present provision for special repairs, calculated at 1% of the capital cost ox the buildings, approximates to the provision that would be necessary at a higher rate, namely of the capital cost. The Government of India observe, however, that the adoption of the latter i^ate is proposed only in connection with the preparation of rent statements. If so, under the existing rules, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is empowered as a First Glass Resident and Head of a Department to sanction the adoption of a revised rate for special repairs. The Government of India would however observe that items of special repairs should be referred to them for prior approval, as usual. 3d/- V.

Repairs are classified as follows*- (i) 'ordinary' or 'annual” ana lii) 'special'• The former means all repairs carried out annually or at stated intervals e.g. painting, whitewashing, etc. fc~ The la ; ter means repairs which are carried out at xong intervals, and which are of a more extensive nature, e.g. renewal of floors, roofs, the reconstruction of any damaged portion of a residence, etc. Such repairs usually involve capital expenditure when the portion of a residence is replaced by work superior to that which was originally provided.To - 2 - prGrided. If for instance, a tiled roof is eufcstiluteu for a thatched one, the portion of the estimate which represente the cost of new thatched roof exactly the same as the old one, ie charged to 'repairs* while the balance indicates the amount debitable to 'original works'* or 'capital expenditure'.
