# Qatar National Library

## Harvesting Notes
* IP address must be whitelisted by QNL before harvesting 
* There are two separate metadata records for each resource: one in Arabic and one in English; these are contained in the same record element and can be mapped to the same field in the config file
* Images are available through IIIF
* Records have been harvested but there is no obvious way of separating them aside from the <physicalLocation> element, since sets are not used.
