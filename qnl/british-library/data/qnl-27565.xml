Iran . Under an arrangement which has been in force for nearly forty years, but which the Government of India are anxious to revise, India is responsible for roughly half the cost of diplomatic and consular representation in Iran. The consular posts in South and hast Persia are staffed from the Indian Political Service; the remaining consulates and the Legation at Tehran are staffed by the oreign Office. His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India formerly exercised considerable influence in Persian affairs, both in the capital and in outlying provincial districts where the writ of a weak Central Government often did not run. This position lasted for a few years after the war of 1914-18 but has been entirely altered by the re'gime of Reza Shah, who has made the authority of the Tehran Government supre;ie and effective throughout the country. The Shah’s xenophobia, perhaps inspired by a fear of Iran again falling under Russian or British influence, has had the result of isolating British diplomatic and consular officials from almost all social contact with Persians; while zeal for a policy of self- sufficiency has affected British and particularly Indian trade with Persia . Unfortunately Persia has looked to Germany for technical assistance in the development of her industries, and the numbere of German experts and merchants now in Persia are believed to be up to or over one thousand. Prom the strategic aspect Britain and India are concerned in the prevention of a Russian advance against India through Persia/2 . Persia ( jrobably less important than the danger or an advance through Afghanistan), and in the protection of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s installation in S.W. Persia. Persian Gulf . Since the last war the Arab coast of the Gulf has acquired great importance as a source- of oil and as the strategic and commercial air route to India, The Political j.esident, Lt.Col. Prior, (who is also Consul General at Bushire, in South Persia, where his headquarters are) and the several Political Agents (at iCoweit, Bahrein, uscat and - a war-time appointment - on the Trucial Coast) are drawn from the Indian Political Service, and expenditure is borne by the Government of India (except for a half share of the cost of the Residency and the Kowelt Agency which is borne by the foreign Office). The India Office, working as need be in consultation with the Foreign Office and other interested Departments, is the Department responsible for the conduct of relations with the Arab States of the Gulf. These States consist of (a) Koweit , occupying a strategic position at the head of the Gulf between Iraq and Saudi Arabia; (b) Bahrein , a group of islands half-way down off the Hasa coast (a part of Saudi Arabia); (c) Qatar , a promontory south of Bahrein; (d) the seven petty Sheikdoms of the Trucial Coast ( so called from the maritime truce imposed in 1B20 by the iast India Company on the pirate chieftains of this district) whose names, in order eastwards from Qatar, are - Abu Dhabi, Dibai, Sharjah, Ajman, Urnm al Qaiwain, Has al Khairnah and Kalba; and (e) Muscat , a coastal fringe of territory extending from the tip of the peninsula at the mouth of the Gulf as far as the Aden Protectorate (the Hadhramaut). With the exception of Muscat all these States are/ -are British-protected States; we control their foreign relations, exe else jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners in their territories, and are under certain obligations to potect them, at least on the seaward side. Muscat is in a s ecial position; its independence is guaranteed by a joint /nglo-F’rench declaration made in 1862; but its relations with us, particularly with India, are so close that in practice its position resembles that of a protectorate. H.n.G. exercise jurisdiction in Muscat over British subjects, but not over foreigners* In. all the States we respect the independence of the Hulers in internal affairs and intervene only in the case of serious maladministration (as we did jn Bahrein in 1923) or of a breach, or threat of a breach, of the peace likely to endanger British or foreign interests. In Bahrein our intervention led a few years ago to the appointment of a British Adviser, r. Belgrade who is the effective head of the administration. The appointment has been an outstanding success, thanks to ? r. Belgrave f s zeal and ability and his wise disposition of Bahrein's new resources derived from the exploitation of oil. British influence in the Gulf is upheld by the Navy, which normally Inpea ;e-time has some three sloops stationed there and applies the sanction of force when required. None of the Hulers, excepting the Sultan of Muscat, receives any subsidy or other assistance from GDverninent. The Air__Boute. Since 1931, when the Persian Government refused to renew permission for the use of the South Persian route by Imperial Airways, the British commercial (as well as strategic) route to India and beyond has followed the Arabian coast of the Gulf. The normal stages used by Imperial Airways, now British Overseas Airways Corporation, are Basra - Bahrein - Debai (or Sharjah) - Jiwanl (in Kalat). Koweit is visited only/4 . only occasionally toy land machines. The necessary facilities were arranged toy agreement with the various rulers (strong ♦ pressure toeing needed to secure it on the Trucial Coast); land machines can use the aerodromes at Koweit, Bahrein, Sharjah and the emergency aerodrome at Kaltoa (on the ilusandim peninsula), while flying-tooats can alight and anchor at Bahrein, Detosi and (in an emergency) Has al Khairnah. The Jt.A.F. in ai ition have arranged emergency landing grounds in Muscat territory which would toe of use if it were desired to reach India from Aden via muscat* So far we have toeen etole to keep the Arato Coast route closed to regular use toy foreign aircraft. Oil. A great oil-toe&amp;ring region lies around the Persian Gulf and it seems possitole that the oil resources of the Arato coast may stand comparison with the great fields in South Persia and Iraq. British and American interests have now secured concessions from all che Rulers. In Koweit . the Kuwait Oil Company represents a combination of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company with the Gulf Oil Corporation of Pennsylvania. Oil has toeen struck in three wells in very satisfactory quantities, tout production has not yet begun and is likely to toe deferred until after the war. In Bahrein , the Bahrein Petroleum Company is an offshoot of the Standard Oil Company of California who stepped in when the Anglo Persian Oil Company decided not to take up the concession. The Americans were at once successful, and production has gone on since 1935 on a large scale, reaching an annual output of just over one million tons. An up-to-date refinery has toeen erected in Bahrein. The activities of the Oil Company have transformed the life of the place and bring in a handsome revenue for the Sheikh, whose royalties have reached/reached the figure of a quarter of a million sterling \35 lakhs) in the year of hi^iest production* (Only part of this income is retained for the private use of the Sheikh and his family. A considerable proportion is being wisely set aside in a reserve fund against the day when oil production falls off; the remainder assists the development of social services? education? etc.) In 'star, the Trucial Sheikdoms, and kuscat the oil concessions have been obtained by an offshoot of the Iraq Petroleum Company. I rilling has proceeded for sane tine in atar and oil was recently reached at about 6,000 feet. Elsewhere only preliminary exploration has been carried out, greatly hanrered by the weakness of the control and influence exercised by the Tracial Sheikhs and even by the Sultan of Muscat in the hinterland v.hieh contains the only structures . « • likely to interest the geologists. To complete this brief picture of oil developments on the rrb coast it is necessary to include a reference to Hasa, t e province of 3audi J rabia occupying the coast between Bahrein and Koweit. Here the concessionaires are another of shoot of the Standard Oil ompany of California, vis. the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. They have discovered what promises to be a very wealthy field. Production was in full swing before the outbreak of v/ar* the oil either being delivered direct to tankers at the net; port of fas Tanura, or else shipped to Bahrein for refining in the Bahrein Refinery. A new refinery is now to be built on the mainland. One stretch of territory has still to be mentioned - the Koweit Neutral Zone, an area lying between f.ot/eit proper and Hasa* the creation of the ejd - Kowoit frontier settlement of 1922, when it was found necessary to leaveTfor future decision the division of this area between Ibn Baud and the Sheikh of Koweit, who meantime were/6 were to have equsl rigtite in it. With the oil halt stretching fron Iraq through Koweit to Hasa^ Bahrein and star it would he very surprising if oil were not struck in the neutral zsne also* But interested Companies have hitherto failed to obtain a concession therein* rbn 'aud is willing to give a concession in respect of his own rights, hut nothing can he done without the co-operation of the Sheikh, who nurses the hope of winning the whole of the Heutrnl Zone for himself some da^r and meanwhile refuses to discuss the question of an oil concession. D ^fqncc measures* fho protected irab States of the Gulf (this excludes fuseet, of course) are considered to he automatically at war wheu H.f.G. is involved therein* Before the outbreak of hostilities the dofenee position v;as reviewed hy the A.O.C., Iraq and hy the C* r .D* It was considered that there was no need for the otates to make provision to meet attacks from the air or sea (even with Italy at war against us) and that measures were required only to guard against sabotage, internal trouhl s or tribal raids, and particularly for the protection of the refinery and oil instak ation generally at Bahrein* Local defence schemes were worked out for- all the States, including Muscat, and are bein' applied. Muscat's lurLdical Mcdcpcn Icncc raised a special problem, which was net by effecting an agreement V7lth the Sultan which secured to us facilities in his territory as might bo found necessary. (An example of these facilities is the use of Muscat waters for convoy assenbl purposes, which may be found necessary if Italy goes in against us; also the continued use of 3* .f* landing grounds and the Royal UavyVs rest b 3© at Khor 'Chv/ai) # In return the Sultan has been given a guarantee of protection against external aggression, a war-time subsidy, and gifts of arms/7 a mo an o quipraon t * The pov/ors of the civil authorities have aleo been strengthened* A special Order in Council, issued under the Emergency Powers (l efence) Act, conferred porters on the Political :esient which he has exercised to issue defence re ulations and trading with the enemy regulations* These apply to the persons ove than His I a^esty has jurisdiction, i*e.

The text is divided into sections: ‘Iran’ (folio 2), ‘Persian Gulf’ (folios 2 to 3), ‘The Air Route’ (folio 3), ‘Oil’ (folios 3 to 4) and ‘Defence Measures’ (folios 3 to 5).The papers provide information on the Government of India’s past and current responsibilities and relations with Iran. Also discussed are concerns over a potential Russian advance through Afghanistan and Persian-German relations which in part are attributed to the reign of Reza Shah [Shah of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty].The significance of the Persian Gulf as a strategic and commercial air route to India, and as a source of oil, now and in the future is discussed. Further highlighted is the responsibility of the Foreign Office and other departments to conduct relations with the Arab states of Kuwait, Bahrein, Qatar, the Trucial Coast and Muscat, and the implementation of wartime defence methods in the region.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shah of Iran</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Iran</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>International relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Oil</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00033e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
