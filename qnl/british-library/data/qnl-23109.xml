Ohba came to see me accompanied by Mr. »Abdul Hamid ivhunji. iA e explained that he was the agent for Mitsui Bussan Kaisha on the shipping side and that they had got a contract for 5,000 tons of cement a month from the Iranian Government and that they, therefore, proposed to send tneir ships round the Persian U ulf. They had tried to get the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation limited to take up the agency for their steamers but for some reason they had refused to accept the agency. He had enquired from some other persons (unnamed but, I think, Hajji Yusuf Kanoo) but that the agency could not be arranged. He, therefore, proposed that ^uhammad Tayyid ivhunji should be their shipping agent. I then asked Mr 1 Abdul Hamid Khunji whether his firm had any experience of shipping work and he admitted that they had none. I told Mr. Ohba that he would have to make an application to the Bahrain Government for permission for an agency for his steamers. He asked whetherwould be I said that I could not say and that I should have to hear what the -Cahrain u overnment ttW had to say about it, before answering umrrr. question. Mr. Ohba says that Mitsui is merely a name of a person just as, for example, 'Lloyds Bank' or 'Lloyds Agency'. He says that he knows Mr. Hasua and that he is another of their business agents. The Mitsui concerns do all sorts of business, shipping, insurancer. Ohba wishes to speak to you. il ave you the tiwe? rf so e i you ’ ant the fi_e? G.A.C.-25/^. 'Aould you please see him as I am very busy at the moment - just ask him to let you know what he wants but avoid discussion. G.u.- 25/2.I interv iewed Mr. K. oijha by order of the Political Agent this morning. He states that the Bahrain Government do not anprove of Muhammad Tayyib Khunji as Shipping Agent for his Company. He asks now. 'tyill the Political Agent help him to find a suitable Agent and if so who?’ 1 He informed me, that his Company are now negotiating with N.Y.K. - O.S.K. and Yamashita Companies whose ships at present run up the Gulf and which Companies have a general trade agreement with the P. &amp; 0. and B.I. Mespers in consequence were their Agents but could not act as his Companies agents until the negotiations were completed and an agreement reached. As soon as this was complete Mespers would be his Companies Agents too. He informed me further that his Companies S' * visiting all other Gulf ports except Bahrain and Dibai* In Kuwait his Agency was Haji Muhammad Bhabani and Sons, and in Basrah African and Eastern and Near East Limited. He informed me further that his Company wished to send Tankers to Bahrain within the next three months for Bahrain oil and that negotiations were proceeding to this end in London. Therefore a Shipping Agency in Bahrain was imperative He wishes to leave for Bombay by tomorrow’s East-bound plane, and wants to see or have an answer from the Political Agent at once. I told him to come and see me at noon and t’d try and let him know what Political Agent thought, I informed him however that P.A’s position over commercial and trading concerns was very difficult, and he could only interfere on behalf of one concern to the detriment of another. He naturally therefore tried to keep aloof, and though he sympathises with Mr. Obha he could probably only reply 'God helps those who helps himself.' Mr. Obha saw this point and laughed.Confidential D*0#No:C/9i&gt;. 1st Aiarcn l.;3C fear Varies, TJoiiid you Iclnaiy let me know whether you noticed a Japanese passenger, kr. K.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that on the 26th January 1936 I received a letter from His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah enquiring v/hether there was any objection to the grant of a visa to visit Bahrain to Mr.K.Ohba, a Japanese, as a representative of the Mitsui Bussan Kaisha Limited in order to make enquiries about port facilities. 2. His Majesty’s Consux informed me at the same time that Mr. Ohba Tvould be staying in Bahrain with Messrs Muhammad Tayib Khunji, an Iranian firm. 3. I had enquiries made from Mr. Muhammad Tayib Khunji, v.ho said th&amp;t he did not know Mr. Ohba and that he had had no intimation of his coming, but that as he was a representative of the Mitsui concerns he vould accommodate him. The Bahrain Government had no objection to his being granted a visa and I replied to His Majesty’s Consul that he might be given a visa. 4. On the 22nd February Mr. Ohba, whose card bears the legend 'Mitsui Bussan Kaisha Ltd., Bombay', came to see the Assistant Political Agent and later mj with a view to obtaining help in arranging for an agency for the steamers of the Mitsui Bussan Kaisha. Vhen he came’ to see me he unexpectedly brought with him Mr. ’Abdul Hamid Khunji. • Mr. Ohba (who seemed to me on this slight acquaintance /clever 52m clever and energetic) stated that he had wished to get the iiesopotaniia Persia Corporation limited to act as agents, but that, as his steamers were not of the Tt Conference n lines One mentioned specifically the Peninsula and Oriental Com any limited, the Eritisn India Steam Navigation Company limited, Nippon Yussem Kaisha, Gsa&amp;a Shosh&amp;n Kaisha and Xanashita Kaisha) they could not undertake the work# He proposed that Messrs Muhammad layib Khunji should be their agents. I appreciated that for various reasons it was undesirable to put such work in the hands of this firm, so I asked (knowing that they had not done so) Mr, ’Abdul Hamid Hliunji whether they had ever handled any shipping agency business before. He replied that they had not done so. I then explained to Mr. Ohba that the correct procedure was for the firm to apply to the Bahrain Government for permission to take up an agency for his steamers. 6. The Bahrain Government object to permitting Messrs Muhammad layib Khunji to take up a shipping agency because they wish to keep such work in the hands of either the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation limited, who are &amp;•stable firm and have had long ex-erience of the work, or of a local Arab firm, and they particularly do not wish to give it to an Iranian firm after their recent unfortunate experience with %• Muhammad Sharif and the Hansa line. They, therefore, refused permission. 7. On the following day (23rd February) Mr Ohba came round in a state of some anxiety, told me that the Bahrain Government had refused permission to Messrs ^uliammad i'ayib Khunji to take up the agency and asked what he was to do. In Tayib Khunji on the ground of lack of experience, were no aoubt actuated by their unforcunate ex ;erience when they had permitted an inexperienced firm to be agents for the Hansa Line the course the course of conversation I mentioned txiat the Bahrain Govern ment, who had refused to give the agency to Me 3srs ^uhaaaad /and, ■ r t£Zl-Z3 . £.nd, on his pressing for help, said that it was not really for me to advise in such matters but that I-if he v/ere to approach Ha^i Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo vlao had experience of shipping agency work, I did not suppose that any difficulty would arise. I suggested him (over whom we have influence) as it seemed impolitic to refuse Mr. Ohba f s company an agency and it was undesirable that the Bahrain Customs Department should undertake the loading and discharge of such steamers. Mr. Ohba thanked me and went off to offer his agency to iiaji Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo (actually to Haji Jasim Kanoo as Haji Yusuf is on the Pilgrimage). I understand that the Kmoos* were doubtful at first whether their commitments with other Japanese firms allowed their taking the agency for the M itsui Bussan Kaisha, but an examination of their various undertakings showed that they were not precluded from doing so. The Bahrain Government granted them permission to take up the agency. 3# I understand from Mr. Ghba trict his ships are coming up the Persian Gulf chiefly because his firm have got a contract to deliver to the Iranian Government at Bandar Shapur 5,000 tons of cement a month (for how long is not clear). His agents in Kuwait are Haji Muhammad Behbehani and Sons and in Basrah the African and Eastern and Near East Limited. His firm wish to send tankers to Bahrain within the next three months for oil (l have heard of this from another source) and negotiations to that end are proceeding in London. I rather think that the tankers were the reason for his pressing desire to get an agency settled and possibly accounted for his first wheedling the Director of Customs, who he thought was standing in his way, and then threatening him with the wrath of the Japanese Government• 9. Local opinion (except no doubt the Khun^i family) thinks that the Bahrain Government have done well to refuse /the agency4. the agency to the Khunji family and I hear that Mr. Ohba»s intention v:as to use the family (one of whom is in Japan learning business, but according to Mr. Ohba prefers da-lying vith the ladies there) as agents for co.Liecting information, x fancy my informants were thinking of commercial information, 1 ut Mr. Ohba himself was, I am told, active during his flight here in Imperial Airways in taking photographs with a tele photo lens (one informant suggested infra-red). I hear also tnat he photographed Jufair fairly thoroughly. 10. Mr. Ohba went on to Bombay from Bahrain by air, and at Sharjah he took several photographs, mostly of the outside of trie Fort, but did not display more than the usual foreigner^ interest in the building. He did not apparently attempt to go into the town and was not seen conversing with any of the local people. 11. I understand that Mr. Asaicho Hasuo, for whom permissin for a visa for Bahrain was requested in your telegram No:155 dated the lath February 1^36, is one of Mr. Ohba &lt;8 colleagues. He has not yet visited Bahrain. • 1 report these activities at some length in connection v/ith the way in which the Japanese are penetrating the Persian Gulf in the guise at present of harmless traders.

Ny dear The policy of Q-overrment requires that the utmost care should be taker at present to avoid action which might provoke the Italian and Japanese Governments or influence them towards changing their present declarations of neutrality- 2. Nevertheless, from the Security point of view, nationals of these two Powers must inevitably be regarded with suspicion. The fact that Italy and Japan have not immediately declared war on the side of Germany, does not in itself make them any more friendly towards Great Britain * 3. In India there is reason to believe that some nationals of both Italy and Japan are actively engaged on espionage work. There are reasons also for believing that, with the removal of male German subjects ^-o internment camps, the responsibility for hostile activities subversive to the internal peace of India and to her defence plans may have now passed in some degree to neutrals favourably disposed towards Germany and to suborned British subjects. In the case of Japanese, a further ground for regarding the- with suspicion exists in the expansionpolicy of Japan for creating a 'New Order in Asia'. 4* It is, therefore, desirable that the activities of Italians and Japanese in India and neighbouring countries- 2 - countrios should be kep^ under close observation by secret Intelligence means* It is equally essential, however, that the methods adopted should be really secret and unobtrucive, and that no executive action should bo taken against Italian or Japanese subjects in connexion with suspected propaganda or espionage activities without fully satisfactory evidence.
