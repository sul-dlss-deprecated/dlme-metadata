It is proposed that of the sanctioned grant of Rs. 1,500/-, Rs. 1,000/- should be nrovi- sionaily set apart to meet the cost of electricity for operating the unit, and Rs.500/- for it: up keep; but it is not possible at this stage to decide definitely on the exact proportionate allot ment. 3. As the unit was not installed until late in summer of 1946, and then suffered fro i prolonged 'growing pains' it was never used for mo e than three consecutive days at a time^ during last hot weather. It is therefore not yet possible to supply any re liable figures regarding the cost or maintenance of the unit over a long period.

If the scherae recommended in my express 5. letter No. 417-18/14, dated the 8th February 1947 is sanctioned, it is recommended that this unit either be held here in reserve or transferred in toto to the Assistant Political Agent's house, where there is at present no air conditioning of any kind.

When new it had a sealed unit but obviously this burned out and was replaced by a York compressor. The main faults are as follows Compressor travelling at approximately 1,100 R.F.M. instead of 500 - 600 R.P.M. Compressor and motor mounted on weak sheet iron frames not even cemented or bolted to the floor. These weaknesses lead to excessive vibration, which results in broken pipes, and is the cause of most of 4 the breakdowns. I propose that during the coming winter a four cylinder Halls compressor be obtained and installed on a concrete bed. The motor would be mounted in a similar way. To carry out the above improvements merely necessitates altering one gas pipe and one pulley and I am certain both the efficiency and reliability of the machine'will be increased.

No mention has been made in the above letter of a ir conditioning units for Political Officer, Trucial Coast, but, as stated verbally, I understand that one of the units ordered for the Residency or Agency will be allotted to Sharjah. I am afraid that this is unlikely to meet the case because the larger of the two power plants in Sharjah is 110 D.C. while the machines ordered for the Residency are likely to be 220 A.C. Nor would the existing power plants in Sharjah drive an air conditioning unit for more than 3 or 4 hours at a time. What, I think, are required are two small generators of perhaps 24- or 3 Kilowatts each of the same pattern which could bo used alternately and which could drive an air conditioning unit and work fans and lights throughout the building. 4.

No one can say when the units from the United King dom are likely to arrive; the fact that they have to be tested indicates that they are not even new; and it may well be that,when they do arrive, they will be found to be water-cooled or in some other way unsuitable for fitting in the Assistant Political Agent's house. When I spoke to you about this, you considered the purchase of the units available locally and asked / me to try and sell the unserviceable sets now in the Agency. I have done so, tut have failed to get an offer. Horner agrees that the sets are in all pro bability irreparable and unsaleable and also casts doubts on the propriety of sale since technically speaking the sets are on charge of the Ministry of Works. I should be grateful therefore for immediate ✓ sanction &amp; the private purchase of at least one of the locally available Carrier units.

I must again ask for your assistance in the matter of my own and the A.P.A’s air-conditioning. 2. As you^remember, Sir Rupert Hay was good enough to obtain sanction for two air-conditioning units for \ the Agency, which I took over from Hussain Yateem. One of them was fitted in the A.P.A's house by Horner but Hudson tells me that he (Horner) said about a week ago that the current was not sufficient to run it and he has not been near it since. Hudson is not certain whether it is fit to run or not. 3. Horner, as you know, after considerable delay, got the large air-conditioning unit going in the Agency. In the temperate spell at the moment I am not using it but my driver (who looks after its routine maintenance) tells me that one of the motors needs new packing. When Kim was here he looked at the four Old small air-conditioning units in the Agency and thought that three of them were repairable. (Incidentally Kim and Budden did exactly the same last year.) About three weeks ago Horner came to repair one - the Remington - and left it on saying that I might try it out. At the end of the day f s trial, the floor of the room was covered with water which had poured througl^he Arabic Office below destroying some files and a typewriter. Some days later Horner came•••••• Major A.L.A. Dredge, MBE, Secretary to His Excellency the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.came and started the machine again having, I thought, repaired the leak. Fortunately my driver found that the machine was leaking and turned it off. I have not seen Horner since. 4. I should be grateful if arrangements could be made urgently (a) to instal one air-conditioning unit in the A.P.A’s house and (b) to repair the units in the Agency and to instal one new one. Yours sincerely,D.O.Mo. - Iff- ((f BAHRAIN, Dated 22nd June, 1948. D e ar Leigh, Horner tells me that there is not enough current to run an air-conditioning unit in the A.P.A’s (Hudson’s) house.

Hudson, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain.D.O.No. R- 177- iSJlLf My dear Dredge, POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 13th July, 1948. Please refer to your D.O.No.1847-15/7, dated the 13th July, 1948, to Hudson, about the air-condition ing for this Agency and for the A.P.A's house. You may remember that I also spoke to you a couple of times about this this morning. 2. It is invidious and unpleasant to have to keep necessitated worrying you about it and this I hope is a final letter/ that by the fact/in view of future possible developments, the position of myself and Hudson on the matter should be on record. 3. Even Horner will admit that I took up verbally the question of air-conditioning for the Agency during the winter and you yourself v/iil I think agree in view of the correspondence that I have not been behind hand j in keeping the pressure on. Nevertheless the position at the moment is that there is no air-conditioning what soever in the Agency. Horner’s attempts to mend a couple of the four unserviceable units were, as I knew they would be,quite fruitless--please refer to paragraph 3 of my D.O. No.R-128, dated the 20th June, 1948. In the same paragraph I told you - and presumably you might-have? passed this information on to Horner - that one of the motors in the large unit required new packing. The matter was also brought to the notice of Horner by me verbally but he failed to take any action. The result has naturally been that the motor Major A.L.A. Dredge, MBE, Secretary to His Excellency the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.\ 2 - motor fell from its bearings a few nights ago and the machine had to be stopped. As you are aware Horner has not yet appeared to put anything right. 4 As regards the air-conditioning unit for Hudson Leigh stated a couple of weeks ago in reply to a letter from me that he could not provide the additional power required, but the supplier of the unit for Hudson is will ing to fit it and rur^and to take responsibility for any possible damage. 5. It is clear that Horner is either unable or un willing to provide Hudson or myself with air-conditioning. I am therefore taking steps to have my own units repaired (I believe only one unit - the main one - 3s repairable) and to have Hudson's installed locally, the cost to be debited to M.O.W's account. Yours sincerely,D.O.No. /8//4 Dated Slat July, 1948 S\ / •iH £» 1 Deer Kim, I am very grateful to you for having got sanction for the purchase of the two American 'Carrier” air-condi tioning units - one for Hudson’s house and one for the Agency here. We have not been alle to get them going yet as Horner has been too busy with other work and I have had finally to tell him that we must get them installed through an outside agency. The real Bahrein heat has come down now and, if the form is as usual, it will be on us until November. 2. You may remember the position as regards air- conditioning in this Agency. It Is as follows*- (a) 7i ton 'York' unit for the Political Agent’s office (upstairs) and Confidential Clerk’s office (downstairs). (b) Small 'Frigidaire' unit in the small room off the Political Agent's office. (c) Small 'Frigidaire' unit in No.4 bedroom. (d) 'Remington' unit in No.2 bedroom. (e) 'Firbenks-Morse' unit in the dining room. 3. The only unit which can be operated and is working at the moment is that mentioned at (a) and, while that is enough for a single man like myself, it means that when I have a guest, as I have at the moment, I have to let him sleep in my office and when the family (consisting of a wife, and two children, and a mother-in-law) of a man who was acting here last yeer occupied my office and the two small rooms off it, the air-conditioning broke downl There is not, therefore, I think you will agree, very much margin. 4. I am hoping to have the new 'Carrier' unit fitted in piece of the Firbanks-Morse, mentioned at (e) above, in the dining room and it will atleast give a spare sleeping place when required. 6. You thought, I think, that the three sets at (b), (c), and (d) - two 'Frigidaires' and the 'Remington' - could be repaired. Horner has had a few tries at them, but only with the result that the Remington has run initially for a few hours and then stopped$ this has happened several times* Horner is of the opinion that these units (vis. (b), (c), and (d) ) will never really run, and I must say that 1 entirely G.C. Kim, Esquire, Ministry of Works, C/o The British Embassy, CAIRO.I - 2 - I entirely agree with him. They were purchased no less than TEN years ago and I have seen people tinkering at them for three years with no success whatsoever. Would you agree to getting them written off? 6. I think you will accept that there should be enough air-conditioning in this Agency for a married man and his family. It should be easy enough to air-condition the line of small bedrooms (four in number) and the dining room. I should think that a ten ton unit on the verandah would easily do it. Would it not be possible to instal one of these for the next hot weather? A series of small units would be far less satisfactory as past experience had shown. I know of course that the policy as to buildings is in a state of flux, but surely government could not lose on air-conditioning unit, which could always be sold if it were not required? I should be very grateful if you could raise this proposal. The failure of the ton unit (which God forbid) would leave the Agency at the moment with no air-conditioning at all; this indeed happened a few weeks ago until Horner was able to get it going a § ain - &amp; /Oc 't-. 7. I am sending a copy of jthis letter to Douglas, as, in his letter to me about'the repairs, he said you were ill. I hope you are better again and that Cairo is not too unhealthy which some reports say it is at the moment. lg \ V Yours sincerely,% A -;r No.3228 -18/14.

Thank you for your D.O. letter 3227-18/14 of 31st July, although its contents make rather depressing reading. Yfhilst I am in agreement with your view that a separate plant supplying the bedrooms and dining room through a ducted system would result in a. satisfactory arrangement, I very much doubt whether such equipment could be obtained from U.K. without a long delay. I am enquiring from my London Headquarters on the matter, but I think that the immediate solution would lie in the replacement of the existing four room units by four other self contained cabinets. I have therefore recommended that four such units should be sent out, subject to it being coniirmed that the equipment for a ducted installation is not readily avail able - I believe that there are still a few of these cabinets available from a surplus '’pool'* which is under M.0..7. control. Many thanks for your kind enquiry regarding my health: Almost immediately after returning here from Bahrein, I was ordered into hospital, but whether events at Bahrein were the primary cause for this step or whether it was the reaction upon returning to this 'unhealthy' Cairo, I am not quite sure. I trust that you yourself, despite the Bahreinian summery conditions, are finding life as enjoyable as ever. C.J.

I think they will probably be better as I am now beginning to doubt whether the verandah will take the weight of a heavy unit. 3. You will have seen Horner’s report on my small units. The'Hemington' has now finally broken down without apparently any hope of repair so that with the exception of the new unit which you got and which I told you about it in paragraph 2 of my D.O.No.3369-18/14, dated the 16th August, 1948, there is no air-conditioning whatsoever in the Agency.

( I am writing to confirm the following points which were discussued during a meeting held at the Agency on the 13th October, at which Major Hudson, Mr. C.G. Horner and the writer were present. 2. ‘It was agreed that the maintenance of the Agency building including air-conditioning plant, electrical install ations and hot and cold water systems was the responsibility of the Ministry of Works, and that expenditure on the Ministry of Works account should not be incurred, nor alterations or amendments to existing installations carried out. without the prior knowledge and approval of Mr. Horner wno is the Ministry of Works representative in Bahrain. Approval will be given at once for expenditure on urgent maintenance work not exceeding £15 per month on any one item. Requests for all other expenditure must be referred by Mr. Horner to the Ministry of Works Middle East Office in Cairo and in certain cases submission to London may be necessary. Delay in these cases is unavoidable but every effort is made to reduce it to the minimum. I need hardly say that our. maintenance y©te is limited and that we have to make a little go a very long way. 3. In the event of a defect occurring in any installation a report should be made at once to Mr. Horner, who will arrange for repairs to be carried out. It appears that in the past difficulty has been experienced due to requests for assistance being delayed in transmission but it was agreed that this could be overcome by addressing all requests direct to Mr. Horner - they should, if possible, be in writing on Ministry of Works form ( a pad of which is attached). In the event of pressure of work preventing the carrying out of s \urgent repairs, Mr. Horner will call in outside assistance provided that he considers that the work will be done competently and economically. He will notify the Political Agent in writing if any delay is expected. 4. It was arranged that the Political Agent would provide facilities for routine inspections of all air-conditioning equipment to be carried out during the cooling season, either by Mr. Horner or his authorised staff. It is difficult to say exactly when inspections will be carried out as long as site generation continues at Jufair; but they will be atleast once a week. Mr. Horner will keep a record of these inspections The installation of the new carrier air-conditioning unit in the Agency dining room is to be checked at once. ^ J *,|| 5. With reference to Mr. Pelly's D.O letter 3227-18/14 ol the 31st July and Mr. Kim*s reply ESOA/48/6 of the 21st August, I ttRdepefcand am informed that two ca/rier room cooling units The Political Agency, Bahrain. L- were on thewere on the 2nd September awaiting shipment from the United Kingdom and they should by now be on their way. These units are to be installed in two of the small bed-rooms referred to by Mr. Pelly. The question of units for the remaining bed-rooms is under discussion with London. The two new units will be charged with Methyl Chloride gas which is,according to the text books,toxic; and their installation is subject Mr. Pelly^ acceptance of them for oed-room cooling. The risk of a leak in to the ventilated air circuit is very small, and even if the complete charge was lost it is doubtful if a poisonous concentration would occur, but I feel that the user, who takes the risk, should have the last word. Freon gas, which is quite safe, is very scarce just now, but if supplie become more plentiful we would ofcourse recharge the units. May I have your views? 6. I am sorry that I was unable to see Mr. Pelly during my visit, but if there are any points not settled by the above, perhaps you would be good enough to address them either to Mr. Horner or to Mr. Kim in Cairo.

Dear Sir Rupert, I am sorry to have to bother you but I must request your assistance in the matter of air-condi tioning for this Agency and the A.P A f s House. 2. In June last I took up with Kim of the Ministry of Works the question of replacing the unserviceable units here and after considerable trouble (in which Kim.I must say,gave the greatest assistance), sanction was obtained for three small units for the Agency and one for the A.P.A's House. These have now arrived and are with the Bahrain Customs but are consigned under one Bill of Lading in the name of the Political Resident. Noble tells me that when he returns here them, in the middle of March he can instal/ but would like to have the preliminary carpentry work done before he arrives. This I can manage but must have the sets to take their measurements. Would you kindly give orders that they be released and delivered to the Agency? Yours sincerely, His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, No.R-113-18/14 The 12th March 1949 Dear Noble, I should be most grateful if you could get sanction for the payment of the bill of which I enclose a copy.

Please refer to your S.O. letter No.Rt 107-18/14 of the 6th March about air-conditioning units for the Bahrain Agency. 2. The four units are now in the verandah of the Residency office at Jufair and you can measure them there or arrange for their removal to the Agency at your discretion. 3 . We told Kim that taking into considera tion the needs of other officers, we might suggest that one or two of these sets should be allocated elsewhere, but that the matter could be left for discussion until he or Noble visited Bahrain. I find the present position regarding the distri bution of air-conditioning sets and future require ments very difficult to understand, but I must reserve the right to suggest to the Ministry of Works the re-allocation of one or two of the four sets at present allocated to the Bahrain Agency should I find this necessary, having regard to the conditions under which the Residency staff are living at present. I should ordinarily if possi ble consult you before making such a suggestion. C.J. Pelly, Esq., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain.POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 14th March, 1949 Dear Dredge, I am sending my interpreter herewith and with a lorry to take away the four air-condition ing units for the Bahrain Agency, now in the verandah of the Residency office at Jufair, in order that I can have them unpacked and measured for instal lation in the rooms for which they are intended. I should be glad if you would have them handed over to him. I want to get them installed while Noble is here.

I am attaching a copy of letter PA-675 dated 20th November, 194^, in reply. The matter of repairing the air conditioning unit has again been discussed with our engineers who estimate the cost of the work involved, including materials, will be on the order of Rs. 1,000/-/-.

Dear Sir: Please refer to your letter No. 3335 dated 15th August, 1948. Your Ti ton Airconditioning Unit can be placed in accept able operating condition by renewing crankshaft and end shaft cover on the compressor, installing a new expansion valve and reinstall ing the compressor on a new base plate mounted on the present foundation. Our estimate of the cost of the above work, includ ing materials, is 1,000 Rupees. Material is available and your advice is awaited before the above work will be included in our work schedule. It should be pointed out that since the one year period during which BAPCO maintained your A-C equipment immediately after its installation in 1946 the following alterations were made which are not in accordance with the manufacturer^ specification:- 1. The journal length on crankshaft bearing was reduced. 2. The seal housing was re-machined to off standard dimensions. 3. The condenser was apparently not cleaned. This resulted in corrosion failures and poor perform ances. The foregoing alterations and malpractices are called to your attention since you will undoubtedly wish to take steps to prevent their recurrence. It should also be mentioned that the major portion of your A-C trouble has been due to the low voltage and intermittent nature of your power supply. Yours very truly, Original Signed by R.M. BROWN R.

W. 1 . 30th August, 1950 To help in assessing the general need and desirability of air conditioning for offices and residences abroad, we have been requested by the Treasury and Ministry of Works to obtain certain information. 2, We realise that some posts may already have expressed their opinions, but we should be grateful for replies to the following questions Does your air conditioning plant work well? For what period of the day, and for what period of the year is your air conditioning plant used? What effect has air conditioning had on the morale and efficiency of your staff? Yours ever, OOrFEHEZGE ADD SUPPLY DEPARTMENT British Political Agency, BAHRAIN. , a UH- r-fi ll ' n hPolitical Agency, Bahrain, No.F-162-18/14 23rd Sept.1950. Dear Conference and Supply Department, llease refer to your letter of the 30th August (XCO 1/2950) on the subject of air conditioning. 2 . This post is only partially air conditioned. The building consists of offices on the ground floor and the Political Agent’s residential quarters on the first floor. On the ground floor there is only one room with air conditioning. This houses two clerks. The remaining members of the staff, and there are over a dozen, are without air conditioning. On the first floor there are three small rooms air conditioned by a 7£ ton unit which works well provided it is given constant and expert attention. There are in addition five 3/4 ton units all of which, with one exception, can only be made to work occasionally for short periods. 3. Air conditioning is required here from May to October inclusive for twentyfour hours a day in living quarters and during actual working hours in an office. 4. There is no doubt that the morale and efficiency of staff is increased when air conditioning is installed. This is so well recognised by all the leading commercial houses, banks and petrol companies in the Gulf that they consider air conditioning one of their first necessities. It is doubtful whether they would get their European staff to stay were this not so; and, in any case, the V. incidence of illness is so great that they consider it a commercial proposition to have it. The establishments of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf lag sadly behind. Yours ever, Bahrain Agency. Conference and Supply Department, Foreign Office, London.% 6 o URGENT. I asked the A.P.A. to get on to the Secretary regarding the provision of air-conditioning units for this Agency. They would be wanted within another month or so. Could A.P.A. please ask Mr. Andrew to deal with the case and really to see that a move-on is made in this master. My efforts to get any work out of Mr. Horner in regard to the smaller air-conditioning units proved quite atative although I think that the one in ray upstairs office 'flat' is repairable. Has Mr. Horner repaired the large air-conditioner for the C.O. and my'flat'? The matter is urgent; the idea of hurrying to get air-conditioning in at the time when it is heeded is intolerable.

He should take with him the letter on the file in which the packages are described and should be careful to bring all of them so that we do not find that when the units are unpacked any necessary parts are missing. He will perhaps need some coolies in addition to our two Khalasis to load and unload the units. Cere should be taken in the handling of the packages as A.C. units are sometimes rather delicate. One unit for the A.P.A’s house should be unloaded there and the three others brought to the Agency. •f V f ffr yj • \ /_c? ltd.
