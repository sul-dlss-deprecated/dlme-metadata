Beneath the maroon border is a slightly wider one of a gold flower rinceaux against a black ground. On the front of the box is a landscape whose central scene is of 2 shepherds and a flock of sheep. The front center hinge partially covers one of the figures. On the short sides are other landscape scenes with horses and attached to the sides are small chains that hold up the cover.
