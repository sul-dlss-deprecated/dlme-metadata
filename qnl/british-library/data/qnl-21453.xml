This second volume is devoted to detailed descrip tions of the principal routes in the country and a third volume, now in preparation (1936), deals with the Tribes. In the present volume, the Route Reports are preceded by an introductory survey of 'Iraq as a whole, in regard to supplies, fuel, transport, communications, etc. Information under these headings ^ set out in the same order as in the epitome of each Route Report. The Routes are arranged on a geographical basis, with the Tigris as the dividing line. Principal wheel routes east of the Tigris form Part I. Principal wheel routes west of the Tigris form Part II. Lists of the lesser wheel routes and of the pack routes in the mountains of the north are given, but particulars of each route are not included. Reports on these routes are maintained at Headquarters, British Forces in 'Iraq. The more important details of the bridges and ferries of 'Iraq are to be found in the Bridge Table and the location of each bridge or ferry is indicated on the map accompanying this volume.ERRATA.

General (a) Description .—Roads in ’Iraq are almost entirely a post-war development. In 1914, communications were maintained chiefly by water and there were few metalled roads and still fewer motor cars in the country. South of Baghdad, wheeled traffic was in use only on the roads leading from that city to Karbala, Najaf, and Hilla, while other tracks, across open desert or steppe, though passable for carts either all the year round or in certain seasons, had been used only by caravans of pack animals. There was then no railway south of Baghdad. With the advent of the war, however, motor cars in large numbers were introduced into the country for military purposes and it was found that the plains of ’Iraq, where not encumbered by marsh and when the surface is dry, were usually more or less passable by cars and light lorries and that only a number of bridges and culverts Were required to connect up stretches of country which were naturally passable. At the close of the war, recognition of the administrative value of rapid communications and the expansion of civilian motor traffic created a demand for more and better roads and an extensive road- construction programme was commenced by the Government of the country. Throughout the delta of the Tigris and Euphrates there is, for all practical purposes, almost a complete dearth of road-making material. In consequence rather less than 200 miles of road in ’Iraq is metalled (1935). The shortage of stone in the south, how ever, is off-set by the flatness of the country and the facility and cheapness with which “ earth ” roads may be constructed. Under normal conditions, a road grader hauled by a caterpillar tractor will prepare from half a mile to one mile of earthen road in a day. There are, at present, in ’Iraq over 4,000 miles of this type of road and many hundreds of miles of ungraded desert track which provide good motoring surface for the greater part of the year. No precise classification in terms of passability or traffic-carrying capacity is possible, but ’Iraq may be divided into good and bad road areas in such a manner as to indicate the conditions to be encountered in various parts of the country. The alluvial plain, stretching from the Persian Gulf to about a line joining Falluja with Khanaqin, is a bad road area. The soil is fine silt free from stones and quickly becomes a morass after rain. Large areas are liable to inundation when the rivers are high and. as mentioned above, no metalling for road construction is available,In the neighbourhood of the rivers the delta is intersected by innum erable canals and irrigation channels and the roads are often confined to the top of narrow bunds which cannot be skirted. The surface of the earthen roads in this part of the country, unless consolidated by watering at the time of grading, is liable to cut up and become very dusty and heavy if a succession of vehicles attempt to make a track and, in addition, stretches of most of the highways in Southern 'Iraq cross salt-impregnated soil (subkha) which retains moisture long after the surrounding country is dry. These patches make very laborious going for mechanical transport in wet weather. In the open desert, west of the Euphrates, none of these con ditions obtain and this area is perhaps the most suitable for wheeled transport in the country. Although rock outcrop, which is excessively hard on tyres, makes going slow in places and occasional wadis are difficult to cross, the greater part of the desert surface affords a hard, level, all-weather track suitable for all classes of motor transport and on which consistent high speeds can be maintained. Between the alluvial plain and the highlands the soil of the uplands is largely gravel and stone. It is consequently less affected by rain and is not subject to floods. With the exception of the Mosul and Erbil plains, which are bad, the upland country is a good road area. Throughout the uplands and plains traffic is seldom restricted to a specified width of road but can and does diverge across uncultivated land on either side. In the highlands, which lie north-east of a line drawn from Faish Khabur to Khanaqin, ample material for road construction is available and a few good metalled roads, well engineered, have been constructed. Pack routes, however, remain the principal lines of communication in this area. Some mention is appropriate here of the methods adopted to enable road users to distinguish between the various tracks in the desert. For some 15 years past numerous car convoys, each seeking the easiest route between two points, have carved out for them selves tracks across desert previously untraversed by any but single cars with the result that the steppe is often criss-crossed with a multiplicity of deeply scored car tracks, the ultimate destination of which it is most difficult to forecast. In these areas landmarks are rare and, even when they exist, are often unidentifiable ; villages or settled communities, except on the fringe of the cultivated areas, are non-existent and the nomad bedouins are seldom to be found in the same spot for more than two or three days at a time. To “ ask the way ” is therefore usually impracticable. To enable road users readily to identify these desert highways—for such they have become ; there are no others in the desert—a distinguishing letter, together with the mileage from the starting point in Roman numerals, was dug by Armoured Car Sections of the Royal Air Force at intervals of approximately7 B 4 (C 23303) 10 miles along each of the routes of importance. The size of the letters and numerals is 10 ft., to enable them to be seen from the air. A list of the routes which have been thus marked is given on page 367. Traffic now keeps to the right of the road in ’Iraq. The rule of the road was altered in 1927 to conform to that obtaining in the neighbouring countries of which Kuwait, where traffic keeps to the left, is the one exception. (b) Highway Authority and Maintenance. —The Public Works Department of the ’Iraq Government accepts responsibility for all roads outside municipal areas. These are classified as 1st Class roads while those within municipal limits are designated 2nd Class roads and are the responsibility of the local authorities assisted by grants from the Public Works Department. Maintenance consists chiefly in repairing the damage caused annually by rains and floods on main routes, but many 2nd Class roads and desert tracks are far better all-weather routes than those receiving the maximum of attention. ’Iraq is rich in bitumen deposits and also in oil with a large bitumenous content. Develop ment of bitumen surfaces for roads is progressing and should go far to prevent the action of the sun and rain from disintegrating the roads under traffic. There are no recognised stone or gravel quarries in the country but, in the uplands and highlands of Northern ’Iraq, metalling is abundant and, where required, has generally been taken from borrow pits alongside the road. During the war, 1914-1918, road metal for the Basra area was brought from Kuwait and a railway, which has since been dismantled, brought stone, sand and shingle from Jabal Sanam, 30 miles south-west of Basra. Gravel is col lected, with much labour, from the fringes of the desert for roads in the south while small quantities of surfacing material for the roads in Baghdad are obtained in the low-water season from the Tigris opposite Kadhimain. The road plant in use by the Public Works Department of the ’Iraq Government consisted, in 1932, of— Soidhern Division (based on Basra) :— 2 Light Motor Rollers. 3 Wehr Graders. 3 Russel Graders and 4 Holt Tractors. 3 Water-carts. Central Division (based on Baghdad) :— 4 Steam Rollers. 2 Light Motor Rollers. 1 Wehr Grader. 5 Russell Graders and 6 Holt Tractors. 2 Water-carts.8 Northern Division (based on Kirkuk) :— 9 Steam Rollers. 2 Light Motor Rollers. 5 Russell Graders and 5 Holt Tractors. 7 Fordson and International Tractors. 4 Air Compressors. 4 Water-carts. (c) External Traffic Routes. —The following are the principal external traffic routes connecting Traq with the territories which surround her :— (i) Baghdad-Damascus via Rutba (Routes 55 and 59.)— This route together with routes (ii), (hi) and (iv) below are ’Iraq’s principal road communications with Syria, Iransjordan, Palestine and the Mediterranean seaboard. The first recorded crossing of the Syrian Desert by motor car was in 1908 when Mr. Forbes, of Messrs. MacAndrews and Forbes, liquorice merchants, journeyed in an Argyll car from Aleppo to Basra, the car being driven back to Aleppo by the same route in 1909. In 1921, two car convoys of the Royal Air Force prospected and surveyed a route from Baghdad via Rutba to Amman, at the same time ploughing a furrow the whole length of the track to serve as a guide to pilots of aircraft on the then projected Baghdad-Cairo air mail service. The route from Damascus to Baghdad was traversed in April, 1923, by the British Liaison Officer, Beirut, and the British Consul, Damascus, and a regular passenger service was later begun by Nairn Transport Company, to be imitated rapidly by numerous ’Iraqi companies. These highways are among ’Iraq’s most important trade routes and their increasing use by passenger, freight and mail services has necessitated a certain amount of maintenance being undertaken by the Traq Government. A start was made in 1935 on the metalling of the worst stretches of the route from Ramadi to Rutba (Route No. 55) and it is intended to complete the surfacing of some 50 kilometres within one year of the commencement of the work. (ii) Baghdad-Amman-Jerusalem via Rutba (Route No. 55).— See (i) above. (hi) Mosul-Aleppo via Dair az Zor (Route No. 111).— See (i) above. (iv) Kirkuk-Tall Kutchuk-Nisibin via Mosul (Routes Nos. 9, 19, 32, 110).—This route is used mainly for passenger traffic and joins the terminus of the Traq railways at Kirkuk with the Syrian railhead at Tall Kutchuk whence passengers may connect with the European railway system via Nisibin, Aleppo and Stambul.9 (v) Erbil-Rayat via Ruwandiz Gorge (Route No. 9).—The Iranian Government are continuing this route, within their borders, to Haiderabad on Lake Urmia in the hope of creating a transit trade between Southern Russia and the Mediterranean. The route is closed by snow for part of the winter of each year and, so far, the volume of traffic using it has not come up to expectations. It passes for some 12 miles through the magnificent Ruwandiz Gorge. (vi) Baghdad-Khanaqin (Routes Nos. 9 and 14).—The main route for the Iranian transit trade, connecting Baghdad with Teheran. (vii) Najaf-Hail-Mecca (Route No. 108).—The trans- desert route from Najaf through Hail to Madina and Mecca has recently (1935) been opened up, by the ’Iraq and Sa’udi- Arabian Governments in co-operation, for the convenience of pilgrims who are thus enabled to travel direct and thus avoid a lengthy detour by sea or by land via Syria and Egypt. Long stretches of this route cross heavy sand and it can by no means be said to be passable for all arms. (viii) Basra-Kuwait-Riyadh (Route No. 91).—The road from Basra via Kuwait to Riyadh, the capital of Sa’udi-Arabia, has yet to be developed as a recognised main route, though it is frequently traversed by cars from Kuwait to Riyadh and vice versa. Like Route 108 (Route (vii) above) formidable sandy barriers lie athwart it but it has been used by a certain amount of pilgrim traffic from Basra in recent years. (d) Recent Improvements. —The detail of the Route Reports in this volume is, in most cases, corrected up to the spring of 1934, since when a number of improvements, particulars of which are given below, have been made to the road system of ’Iraq :— .

It is improbable, however, that they will be completed during the year :— (а) Koi Sanjaq to Rania. This is a section of a new road which will eventually be constructed from Kirkuk to Rania. (б) Mirza Rustum to Rania. A section of a new road eventually to be constructed from Sulaimaniya to Rania. (c) Qaraghan to Qal’a Shirwana-Saiyid Ishaq. (d) Geli Ali Beg-Sharishama-Barzan. (e) Qurna-Madina. (/) Bebadi-Sulav. A portion of Route No. 45. (Maintained by Headquarters, British Forces in Traq, and not included in this volume) which is to be extended to Amadia town. 2. Water Generally speaking routes in Traq, except those in the desert, are well supplied with water ; indeed, in the high-water season from April till June, when extensive flooding occasionally takes place in Southern Traq, they are often too well supplied. The rains, which provide a further source of supply though an unreliable one, may be expected between November and April. Except in the case of some of the mountain streams, the water supply generally cannot be regarded as pure enough for European consumption and pre cautionary measures are imperative to minimise the danger of pollution and to sterilise water already contaminated. Pumps and tanks are installed at the principal railway stations and particulars of their capacity are given in Chapter 7, Volume I, Military Report on Traq. A marked improvement has been made in recent years in the water supplies of the large towns of the country. Baghdad, Mosul and Basra each has a piped supply of chlorinated water adequate for municipal requirements and piped supplies have been installed in many provincial towns. (See page 81, Volume I.) In the smaller towns and villages the supply is usually derived from streams or wells which are liable to be fouled. In describing the water resources of the country as a whole it will be convenient to divide the terrain into three areas :— (a) Uplands and Highlands .—In the hills and mountains of northern and north-eastern Traq good water is available practically everywhere from springs, from streams which have their sources in springs or, less frequently, from wells. Taken at its source, spring water is usually fit for consumption by Europeans. Among the foot-hills there is generally sufficient water at all times of the year to supply a brigade at each stage of a march.12 (b) Alluvial Plains .—The Tigris and Euphrates and their dis tributaries ensure a plentiful supply of water in their vicinity at all times of the year. In the high water season, inundations also provide temporary supplies at some distance from the river banks but some of the distributaries and irrigation channels are dry in their extremities for several months during the low water season and recourse must then be had to digging in the dry stream beds. The depth at which water is obtained increases with the advance of the dry season until, immediately prior to the flood, it reaches a maximum of about 12 ft. The water is slightly bitter about September and tends to become more so. Supplies from this source would seldom be adequate for military purposes and during the low water season; therefore the alluvial plains, except in the vicinity of the rivers or permanent marshes, must be regarded as waterless. The command of the water supply being a most important factor in the control of an area, the occupation of barrages and regulators would be a measure of considerable importance to forces operating in the alluvial plain. (c) The Desert .—Contrary to general belief the desert is by no means devoid of water, though from a military aspect it must be so regarded. None of the wells in the desert areas of ’Iraq would support a force of any size for more than a few days. For brief periods in the winter during a year of good rainfall, surface water is abundant and pools are scattered all over the desert, while the yield of the permanent wells is, in many cases, increased for some months by satisfactory rains. For the remainder of the year, however, the nomad inhabitants of the desert (there are no other permanent inhabitants) are entirely dependent on wells for their water supply. In certain areas the distances between these watering points are considerable when regarded in terms of “ camel hours ” but are quickly traversed by well-equipped motor transport. Several types of watering places occur in the deserts of ’Iraq— (i) Permanent wells, from which the supply is normally perennial and unlimited. They are frequently sunk to a great depth and are usually lined for a number of feet from the mouth downwards with blocks of roughly dressed stone. Tackle and some hundreds of feet of rope are always necessary for drawing water from wells of this type. The water is unfit for European consumption without purification. No estimate of the ultimate capacity of wells of this type is practicable, although those with the best yield have supported approximately 1,000 tents of nomads with their flocks and herds throughout the summer. (ii) Semi-permanent water holes, which consist of shallow excavations in dry stream beds or hollows where water collects and remains near the surface. Holes are dug in13 \c clusters and may reach 50 in number according to the extent of the sub-surface water and the requirements of the tribesmen. The yield at each digging is small and, when not in use, they contain a few feet of water at varying depths but seldom more than 30 ft. below ground level. They tend to become choked with sand very quickly when in use by tribesmen and it is frequently necessary, at each watering, to scrape the sand from the well to obtain water. In some cases the water is sweet when the holes are first dug but becomes bitter after a while. Other holes are then dug and the unused ones silt up. Perhaps half the wells in the southern and western deserts are under 100 ft. in depth, with one-quarter over 200 ft. and one-quarter between 100 and 200 ft. (hi) Casual watering places. Rainfall on the desert leaves in its wake many pools and tarns which, collectively, are termed ghadir (pi. ghudran) by the Bedouin. There are, however, numerous types, each known by a distinguishing name to indicate the nature of the pool, its surroundings and bottom. Details of the various types are given in the Handbook of the Southern Desert, Chapter IV, page 31. Extensive areas of Southern ’Iraq are permanent marsh with vast belts of reeds from 15 to 20 ft. high. Water, more or less suitable for drinking purposes is consequently always available in their vicinities. The location of these areas may be appreciated from the Irrigation Map on page 148 of Volume I, but their extent varies seasonally with the amount of water which overflows into them from the rivers at high flood. They cover their greatest area in June and July, their smallest in October and November. 3. Supplies (a) The following are the principal commodities showing an export surplus, part of which would normally be available for military purposes :— Cereals : Wheat, barley, maize, millet, rice. Fruits : Dates. Livestock : Cattle, sheep, goats. Dairy produce : Eggs, cheese, poultry. Export figures are given below. Although fruit and vegetables are grown only for local needs and, apart from dates, none is exported, the variations of climate between the mountains of the north and the sultry plains bordering the Persian Gulf produce a wide range of fruit and vegetables.14 The fruits include : oranges, grapes, figs, melons, pomegranates, apricots, mulberries, apples, quinces, plums, cherries, pears, pistachio nuts, almonds, and walnuts. The vegetables are : onions, cucumber, radishes, beetroot, cabbage, cauliflower, carrots, tomatoes, lettuces, artichokes, and potatoes. An appreciable surplus of most of these varieties would undoubtedly be available, in their season, for military requirements though it is impossible to give figures for quantities to be obtained. The winter crop of cereals (wheat and barley), sown with the first rains, is reaped and threshed in April, and the spring crop, which comprises millet, rice, maize, etc., is harvested in May. During the month of May, therefore, supplies will be most abundant and at the beginning of April, i.e., immediately preceding the harvesting of the winter crop, they will be scarcest. Large quantities of lucerne and tibbin (chopped straw) are to be had at most times of the year, whilst the tribes can provide sheep in very considerable numbers at any time with prior notice of a few days. [b) Average Exports for the years 1932-1935 :— (i) Cereals. Barley Wheat Wheat flour Maize, millet Rice Dates Metric tons. 124.000 12,000 7.000 51,000 1.000 148.000 (ii) Livestock.

Fuel (a) Wood. —Apart from oil, the most plentiful type of fuel in 'Iraq is scrub, which is generally to be found in large quantities wherever ground is fallow or uncultivated and especially in the desert. Its lightness and fast-burning qualities, however, render it a poor form of fuel and the collection of a sufficient quantity to supply the needs of even a small column would take time and would need prior arrangement ; unless the troops themselves were to be occupied in collecting it.15 Next in order of abundance are date palm fronds (“ karab ”). The thick bases of the fronds, where they join the palm, are much used by the local inhabitants as fuel. They burn readily for a brief period and then smoulder, like peat, for a considerable time. Logs from the stems of date palms exhibit the same characteristics as fuel, and must be regarded as not very satisfactory. In each case a few days prior notification is necessary if large quantities are required. In the highlands a stunted species of oak is commonly used as fuel, whilst at a few centres in the plains faggots of tamarisk are to be obtained. Both are a satisfactory fuel. The “ ghadha ” bush, found chiefly in the desert, is perhaps the best wood fuel, but quantities are very limited. (b) Coal .—Coal is imported and is obtainable in small quantities in me towns of Baghdad and Basra. Deposits of bitumenous coal at Kifri have been worked, but the coal or lignite produced is a soft, brown or black composition and of no value as steam coal. Other deposits are to be found near Halabja, Zakho, Alqosh, Shiranish, and in the Jabal Sinjar. (c) Oil .—Fuel oil, kerosene, motor spirit, and aviation petrol are obtainable from the oil fields of ’Iraq in unlimited quantities.

Transport [а) Motor .—A statement showing the numbers and principal makes of motor vehicles registered in ’Iraq on 1st January, 1936, is given on page 19. A proportion of those registered at each Liwa headquarters would normally be available for hire or requisition, but it should be understood that the numbers to be obtained at short notice would depend to a certain extent on the arrangements made in other centres. Facilities for repairs are meagre. A number of garages have welding plants and carry out minor repairs, whilst complete overhauls can be undertaken at the Railway Workshops at Baghdad, the Mesopotamia and Persia Corporation’s Workshops, and Port Work shops, in Basra., The ’Iraq Army Ordnance Depot at Baghdad is equipped for the maintenance and repair of Army transport. There are no motor factories, for constructional work, in the country. (б) Animal. —(i) Camels .—Large numbers of camels were used in ’Iraq during the war 1914-1918, when roads were almost non existent and motor transport scarce. It is, however, a method of18 transport which has considerable disadvantages. It is slow—the usual pace of a camel caravan is 2-2| miles per hour and the daily march generally 10-15 miles. The carrying capacity of the camel varies very considerably with different circumstances—the length of the journey, the character of the surface, the water and grazing available en route, and the bulk of the load. After rain, on slippery soil, camels are useless, slipping so badly that a halt must be made till the ground is dry. Under favourable conditions a fairly strong camel may be expected to carry 450-500 lbs. (in two packages). 330 lbs. is said to be the average for desert routes. (ii) Horses and Mules are used for pack work, horses for the less difficult roads in the hills and mules in the more mountainous country. They will carry a load of about 300 lbs. in two packs and, under favourable conditions, will move at about 3|-4 miles per hour. The usual day’s march for these animals is about 20-25 miles. (iii) Donkeys are used as transport animals everywhere, and especially for short distance local traffic. They will carry loads of 120-150 lbs. and can generally cover about 3 miles an hour. (iv) Normal forage rations are :— Camels .. .. Largely fed on desert scrub. When pasture is scarce or time for grazing impracticable, on a mix ture of millet and flour made into balls the size of a man’s fist, 5 or 6 balls to a feed. Horses and mules .. 10 lbs. barley and 10 lbs. tibbin. Donkeys .. .. 8 lbs. barley and 8 lbs. tibbin. (c) ithW.—Details of inland water craft are given in Volume I, Chapter VII, page 182. Apart from river steamers, of which there are approximately 20 on the Tigris and Euphrates, there is a total of some 5,000 registered country craft plying on the rivers of 'Iraq. The principal types are— (i) Mahailas, capacity 5 to 150 tons, average 50 tons. (ii) Bellums, capacity 1 to 80 tons, average 5 to 10 tons.

Grazing At no time of the year can grazing, as understood in Europe, be said to be plentiful in Iraq and, although in the mountains of the north grass is to be found throughout the year, in the plains and uplands it only makes its appearance soon after the commence ment of the winter rains, usually about November. Small patches are, of course, always to be found in the near vicinity of the rivers and marshes. Away from the rivers it commences to dry up in April and is withered by mid-June. Nevertheless it still forms suitable grazing, but animals are only enabled to take advantage of it where adequate watering facilities exist side by side, an infre quent occurrence in ’Iraq.20 ! This decrease of vegetation in the summer drives the semi-nomad Arabs from the desert, where they usually spend the winter, into the riverain areas, while the Kurds migrate from the edges of the plain country to the highlands. Scrub, which varies in quantity at different points along the routes in ‘Iraq but is seldom entirely lacking, forms the staple diet of the nomads’ camels. It includes a number of plants on which camels can find grazing throughout the year, e.g., the thorny plant “ agul ” (camel thorn) which is very common. 7. Camping and Landing Grounds (i) Camping Grounds .—Throughout the alluvial plains of ’Iraq, camping grounds are seldom limited in size and, as most of the routes are within easy reach of rivers or canals, water facilities raise no problem. Sites are almost invariably level, a disadvantage in the winter when the ground may become waterlogged, and it may sometimes be necessary to occupy cultivated land. In the hills, space is often restricted and water supplies sufficient only for smaller forces than in the plains. The capacity of camping grounds in the hills is given in most of the Route Reports. (\\) Landing Grounds .—There are fully-equipped-civil aerodromes (1) Page 20, para. 7, sub-para. (ii). Delete lines 1 to 10.

If care is taken, emergency landings may safely be made at many places in Southern ’Iraq, the desert especially providing many suitable areas. In the riverain districts numerous irrigation channels and cultivation tend to restrict the ground available for forced landings, though, except in the marshes, it should be possible to find a suitable landing ground within 10 miles of any given point on a route. In the highlands the problem is much more difficult. The mountains are precipitous and covered with forest and scrub and the surface is broken by many rents and fissures, caused by mountain torrents at the time of melting snows. Flat stretches are few and far between and are usually covered with boulders and stones. To carry out a forced landing successfully in the mountains is a matter of the greatest difficulty.20 This decrease of vegetation in the summer drives the semi-nomad Arabs from the desert, where they usually spend the winter, into the riverain areas, while the Kurds migrate from the edges of the plain country to the highlands.

Climate The climate of ’Iraq is of a semi-arid type and may be divided into two seasons, a comparatively short, cool winter and a long, hot, almost rainless summer. In January, the coldest month, the mean temperature at Hinaidi is 48° F. (an extreme minimum of 19° F. has been recorded there), whilst in July and August the daily maximum almost invariably exceeds 100° F. and temperatures of 120° and 123° F. have been experienced. The temperature begins to fall markedly in October and commences a rapid rise in late March. The diurnal ranges of temperature are also large. As may be expected, the summer places a severe strain on Europeans and precautions should be taken to mitigate its effects. (See Volume I, Chapter VI, page 160.) Animals, on the other hand, whether locally bred or imported, seem to thrive and are equal to the same average day’s work as anywhere else. An unpleasant feature of the climate is the dust storms which occur very frequently during the summer months. They usually commence about 0900 to 1000 hours and continue until after sunset, during which time visibility is often reduced to a few hundred yards, usually making flying impossible and travel by surface transport most disagreeable. Visibility is also often impaired by mirage during the heat of the summer. Objects, houses, etc., which in fact may be quite small, appear many times their actual size until one approaches quite close to them. The difficulties of survey work, in particular, are greatly increased by mirage. 10. Tactical The greater part of the country is monotonously flat and few tactical considerations present themselves. The alluvial plain is scarred with innumerable irrigation ditches and channels, many of them dry and often screened along their banks with low bushes and scrub, which provide the nucleus of a ready-made trench system for small hostile parties. In the southern provinces there are many points at which the roads could, with ease, be flooded and rendered impassable for wheeled transport during the winter and early summer. This could be countered to a certain extent by occupation of the various irrigation regulators and barrages, key points in the control of the alluvial plain. Parts of the desert are sufficiently undulating to conceal com paratively large bodies of troops at quite short distances, and it is difficult to locate an enemy without aerial co-operation. The marsh areas may be considered inaccessible to troops. The vast belts of reeds, 20 feet high, afford effective cover, even from aircraft, to large numbers of tribesmen, who however would havegreat difficulty in maintaining themselves there for any considerable time if denied access to the surrounding land. In the mountains of the north there are, with the exception of the Ruwandiz Gorge, no lengthy defiles, although localities where a small ambush might be prepared are numerous. 1 hese have been noted in the detail of the Route Reports. The passage of the Ruwandiz Gorge, in the face of determined opposition and after the bridges have been destroyed, is considered impracticable. 11. Inhabitants Racial and religious statistics of ’Iraq’s population are given in Volume I, Chapter III, page 70. (a) Racial .—By far the great majority of the inhabitants are Arabs who, in 1933, constituted approximately 74 per cent, of the population. Kurds, accounting for about 14 per cent, of the total, are the most important minority, whilst various races, local Christians, Turks and Turcomans, Jews, Iranians, and others, make up the remaining 12 per cent. The inhabitants may be classified under the following heads :— (i) Townsmen. (ii) Settled, Tribal and Non-Tribal, Cultivators. (hi) Semi-nomads. (iv) Nomads. (v) Marshmen. The urban population, composed largely of the political and com mercial communities, differ little from the tribes, and the towns are not much more than overgrown tribal settlements to which a specious veneer of civilization has been added. The settled tribal and non-tribal cultivators form the largest social unit in the country and more men gain their livelihood as tribal fallahin than in any other one activity. Their occupation has naturally resulted in their being grouped principally along the two rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates. Most of them still retain their tribal organisation, but in some of the most highly cultivated areas, Arabs belonging by blood to several different tribes will be found living together in the same village. The process of settling on the land has not yet been completed in the case of the semi-nomads, who, for the winter of each year migrate from their agricultural holdings in the riverain area to the desert, where they pasture large flocks of sheep and goats till the following spring. The approach of summer with its increasing shortage of surface w r ater for their flocks, drives them back to their cultivation on the river banks. The nomads are seldom to be found in the cultivated areas. They occupy the desert south and west of the Euphrates and the24 rising steppe land between the Tigris and Euphrates to the north west of Baghdad, and are tent dwellers, breeders of camels and horses. The Arab nomads own few, if any, sheep, but the Kurdish nomads have large numbers of sheep and no camels. Only in the summer, when the surface water in the desert has dried up, are they con centrated in any numbers. At this time of the year they group themselves round the desert wells, but in winter and spring, when casual water is plentiful, their camps are spread wide and far over the desert and the ceaseless necessity of grazing for their herds of camels seldom enables them to remain long in the same location. 1 he great swamp areas of lower Iraq, extending from the vicinity of ’Amara to a little north of Basra, are inhabited by large numbers of tribesmen locally termed Ma’adan (sing. : Ma’aidi) or marshmen. Some earn a livelihood as trappers ; others work as agriculturalists, for a few months of the year, in the rice fields that fringe the marshes, but the majority make a living by the manufacture of rush mats which are sold in the markets of the large towns and villages. Each family owns a number of water buffaloes, on the products of which, milk, butter, cream, etc., they largely depend. The tiny islands on which their reed huts are erected just peep above the surface of the water and, in flood season, are often sub merged, compelling the Ma’adan to move to higher ground if any is available. The Kurds, in the northern and north-eastern provinces of ’Iraq, fall into much the same divisions as the Arabs ; townsmen, cultivators, semi-nomads, and nomads, and, whilst many of the Christians lead an urban life, there are a number of Christian villages of agriculturalists in the Mosul district. The Jewish and Iranian communities are almost entirely confined to the larger towns. The population is, on the whole, well armed and a large pro portion of the tribesmen own modern rifles. Except in the desert these rifles are not often carried, but they exist for any emergency and the fact that they exist, even if cartridges are not propor tionately numerous, is a potential source of danger. The mistrust and antagonism of the Shi’ah majority (see paragraph (b) below), who are most inadequately represented in Parliament, towards a predominantly Sunni Government also constitutes a permanent threat to public security. (b) Religious .—Islam is the principal religion of ’Iraq and, according to an estimate made in 1933 (see Volume I, Chapter III, page 70), some 93 per cent, of the population of the country are Moslems. The Christian community, numbering about 4 per cent, of the total, is largely centred in the Mosul district and in Baghdad, while Jewish elements exist in most of the towns. Of the two chief denominations of the Moslem faith, the Sunni and Shi’ah sects, the latter are the more numerous (Shi’ahs number25 approximately 61 per cent, of the Moslem community) and are chiefly domiciled in the southern districts. A line drawn from Baghdad to Falluja may be taken as a rough boundary between the portions of ’Iraq in which Sunnis and Shi’ahs predominate. To the north of this line the great majority of the Moslems are Sunnis, with the exception of the population on the left bank of the Tigris from Baghdad to Samarra, which is mainly Shi’ah. Ihere are also a few Shi’ah tribes among the Kurds though most of the Kurds are Sunnis. In the south, apart from a considerable Sunni element in the popula tion of Basra and Zubair, and the desert nomads, who are without exception Sunnis, the inhabitants are all Shi’ahs. The historial reasons for the schism between the tw r o sects are given in Volume I, page 62. The dispute has become very bitter and has, on occasions, led to massacre and war. At other times, in face of common danger, the differences have been forgotten. On the whole the animosity between the two chief Muhammadan sects is more marked than that displayed by Moslems towards non-Moslems, who are treated with a tolerant contempt. 12. Rains and Floods (i) Rains .—Almost all the rainfall occurs during the period November to April, but there may be considerable variations in the rainfall of an individual month from one year to another and also in the annual falls. In the hills and mountains of the north, the rains set in somewhat earlier than in the south and comparatively heavy falls occur at a time when only slight showers are experienced in the southern provinces. Along the central and southern parts of the country the average is less than 180 mm. per annum, but further north, in the hill districts of Kurdistan, amounts vary from 400 to 500 mm. in a year. The worst rains, as regards their effect on mobility, are those in December and January. In the alluvial plain moderate rains in the winter months are sufficient to make aerodromes soft and the earth roads difficult for mechanical transport for one or two days. Where the surface is “ subkha ” {see paragraph 8, above) the effect is likely to be much more prolonged. The heavy rain which some times occurs in thunderstorms is liable to flood aerodromes and render them temporarily unserviceable. After March, when the temperature is rising rapidly, the effects of heavy rain are not so pronounced. (ii) Floods .—The winter’s rainfall contributes, in part, to the annual rise of the Tigris and Euphrates but a more important factor occurs with the advent of warmer weather in the melting of the snows on the mountains of Kurdistan. The high water season extends from December to June with its peak about April. During this period the volume of water sometimes reaches dangerously high levels and, whilst in upper26 Iraq the rivers, being contained in their valleys or troughs, may flood low foreshores without spreading far, in the south they are apt to inundate vast tracts of land if adequate precautions are not taken to restrain them. All road and rail communications south of Baghdad are liable to be cut in the event of a river being allowed to overflow its banks. the defensive works against floods, at present, consist almost entirely of earthen bunds with a very few spurs of brushwood or masonry and are ordinarily required to contain the entire volume of the rivers. Only two accepted means exist of reducing this volume deliberately, by flooding the Habbaniya depression adjoining the River Euphrates near Ramadi and by cutting the Daudiya breaching site in the bund on the left bank of the Tigris, about 17 miles north of Baghdad. Apart from accidental flooding roads may, with ease, be inundated at many points along the routes in Southern Traq during the high water season, and tribes occasionally break the protecting bunds (though generally without the knowledge and consent of the Govern ment) to flood large areas and thus ensure subsequent grazing for their flocks. In the past, insufficient control of distributaries and inadequate dyking resulting in the overflow of the rivers, have caused the forma tion of large areas of marsh and shallow lakes which may extend to thirty miles in width and one hundred miles or more in length. In a few cases these areas, if not renewed from the rivers, gradually turn salt and evaporate, having no adequate outlets, but generally an annual influx of water causes them to expand considerably in size during the high water season. Exposed areas of marsh are often affected by wind and have been known to extend or contract for as much as one or two miles from this cause. * 13.

Communications (i) Rail .—In general, the railways follow the line of the Euphrates to a point north of Hilla, cross the comparatively narrow neck of land between the two rivers Ao. Baghdad and thence follow Yntfer.. -Sneto ftcr cmioidoration (1936). From Basrato Baghdad the railway is metre gauge, and from Baghdad to standard gauge. The metre gauge continues north-eastwards, following the line of the Diyala to Qaraghan (with a branch line to Khanaqin) and thence northwards to Kirkuk. For details of the railway system, see Volume I, Chapter VII, page 185). (ii) Road.—See Route Map of ’Iraq accompanying this volume.27 (iii) River .—The only consistently navigable waterways of ’Iraq are the Shatt al’Arab, the Tigris, and the Euphrates, though restrictions on the draught of vessels using the Tigris are imposed by the shallowness of the river in low water season and the Euphrates is navigable throughout the year only by native craft. During the high water season locally made rafts are floated down the Great and Little Zabs, and the Diyala is navigable as far as Ba’quba by small craft. The only seasonally navigable stream of importance as a waterway is the Gharraf, a distributary of the ligris, and therefore dependent on the seasonal level of its parent river. On the completion of the Kut barrage, however, it is anticipated that the Gharraf will be navigable throughout the year. High water season on these rivers normally begins about the middle of November and extends to the middle of May, maximum levels being reached about the first week in April. Minimum levels occur about the first week in October. (iv) Telegraph, Telephone, and Cable .—An efficient, Government, telegraph and telephone system serves all important towns and villages and many places of strategic importance. Telephonic communication is also possible with Syria, Egypt, and the United Kingdom. Deep sea cables running between Fao (70 miles south of Basra) and Karachi, via Bushire, connect Iraq with Iran and with the main cable systems of the world. (v) Wireless .—Separate wireless organisations are maintained by— The Posts and Telegraph Department, ’Iraq Government. The British Forces in ’Iraq. The ’Iraq Army. The ’Iraq Police. The Oil Companies. Details of these organisations are given in Volume I, Chapter VII, page 216.32 ROUTE REPORT No. 1 BASRA to BAGHDAD via ’AMARA and KUT AL IMARA (In three parts.)

General In dry weather the route from Basra to ’Amara is passable for all arms. The road itself is unmetalled throughout and is a defined track rather than a marching route capable of sustaining continuous military traffic. There is, however, a steady increase in the volume of civilian M.T. traffic operating over this route, a fact which will create a demand for improved road conditions and a closer supervision over unauthorised activities of local cultivators. The ferry crossing at Qarmat ’AH, the Nahr Shaft (spanned by an iron girder bridge ; width of channel, 40 yards), and the ferry crossing at Qurna are possible obstacles and are commented on in paragraph 7. Between Basra and Qal’a Salih the route runs on the disused railway embankment of the Basra-’Amara railway, which has been reconditioned and levelled, and forms an excellent dry weather road. Movement over a broad front is impeded by the river to the east and marshy and low-lying country to the west. The road is impassable for M.T. after heavy rain.33 Route Report No. 1 (C23303) c 2. Water Plentiful throughout the route at all seasons, from the Shatt al ’Arab as far as Qurna, and the Tigris from Qurna northwards. Water should not be used from the Euphrates at Qurna, nor should marsh water be consumed by troops owing to its impurity and purgative action. Direct watering for animals is obtainable at all selected camp sites. 3. Supplies Qurna, Qal’a Salih and ’Amara are the only supply centres of any military value in this sector. Limited supplies of cereals, meat and fodder could e made available at these places, but advance notice would be required for their collection, as little grain or other produce is actually stored surplus to the requirements of the resident population. 4. Fuel No fuel is available between Basra and Qal’a Salih unless the felling of date palms and fruit trees should be considered admissible. Tamarisk thorn and miscellaneous scrub is plentiful between Qal’a Salih and Amara. 5. Transport Between Basra and ’Amara most of the transport is water borne and few pack animals are available. A considerable number of civil M.T vehicles ply between Basra and ’Amara, but most of these vehicles are registered and owned at Basra. The ’Amara district could supply some 3,000 camels and 2,000 horses and donkeys. ^ , , , , ^ Water transport could be collected without difficulty and good wharfage is available in the vicinity of all camping grounds. 6. Grazing During the period December-May there is a certain amount of rough grazing, but the grazing area is restricted by marsh land to the west, and exists only in isolated and uncultivated areas adjacent to the river. 7. Obstacles The major obstacles encountered en route are detailed below. 1 he majority of these are bridges spanning water channels, extemporised crossings over which would be difficult to construct in the event of damage to the original structure :— (a) Qarmat ’Ali: Motor Ferry over Euphrates New Channel (exit from Hammar Lake). (fc) Nahr Shafi : Spanned by iron girder bridge 12o ft. long. (c) Nahr Chuwaiyg : Iron girder bridge over Nahr 45 ft. wide. [cl) Qurna : Ferry over the Euphrates River. [e) Nahr Barbukh : Iron and concrete bridge, 30 ft. span. (/) Nahr Safha : Iron and concrete bridge on 1 pier, 30 ft. span. (gj Nahr Sakricha : Iron and concrete bridge on 3 piers, 60 ft. span. [h) Nahr Sarifa : Iron and concrete bridge on 5 piers, 60 ft. span. (i) Nahr Shaft : Iron and concrete bridge, 6 ft. span. (;') Nahr Haddama : Iron and concrete bridge spanning 12 ft. water channel. (k) Nahr Majar al Kabir : Wooden bridge, 135 ft. span. (l) Nahr Tabar : Wooden bridge, 120 ft. span. (m) ’Amara : MacMunn pontoon bridge over Tigris.Route Report No. 1 34 8. Additional Work Nil. All bridges are passable for all arms. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds Selected camp sites at Makina (Basra), Hamrina, Yasadu, Qurna, Sakricha, ’Azair (Ezra's Tomb), Mantaris, Nuhair, Majar al Kabir, and 'Amara. Defined landing grounds for aircraft at Ma’qil (Basra) (3 N.2d.l9.19) and at 'Amara (3 M.la.58.37) ; landing grounds adjacent to camping sites are detailed in subsequent stages. 10. Communications Rail. —Nil. Telegraph .—Telegraph lines run in close proximity to the route throughout this sector. Telegraph offices at Qurna, Qal’a Salih and ’Amara. Road .—No lateral communications of any importance. Movement east or west of the defined track is prohibited by river or marsh land. River .—The Shatt al 'Arab is navigable for small ocean-going steamers as far as Qurna Bar (1£ miles below the town), where the water shoals gradually from 30 ft. to 8 ft. North of Qurna the depth of water gradually decreases, but the river is navigable throughout the year for river steamers of 3 ft. 6 in. draught or under. 11. Climate Climatic conditions are normal for lower 'Iraq. South of Qurna, owing to the enormous areas of marsh land, a greater percentage of humidity is experienced, while for the same reason, malaria of a severe type is prevalent. Summer temperatures at Basra average from 5 to 7 degrees higher than those recorded at Baghdad. 12. Tactical The preservation of the existing road on the old railway embankment is essential, and though freedom from flank attack is guaranteed to a certain extent by the physical characteristics of the country to the east and west, no alternative land route exists, and a very small force operating from the western marshes could do considerable damage to the L. of C. by destruction of existing bridges. 13. Rain and Floods As far as 'Amara the country in the vicinity of the road is not liable to flood to any serious extent. Heavy rain renders the road impassable for M.T. for two or three days at a time. The use of M.T. on the Basra-Qal’a Salih section under adverse weather conditions would speedily destroy the road, surface and entail continuous repair work. 14. Inhabitants Between Basra and Qurna the tribesmen have no interests other than cultivation and are, from a military point of view, unimportant. Between Qurna and Qal’a Salih live the marsh Arabs or Ma’adan. Of these the Shaddah section of the Albu Muhammad, who are mainly marshmen, are well armed, of no fixed abode, and inhabit the territory between Hafira and 'Azair.35 Route Report No. 1 c 2 (C23303) 15. Alternative Routes There is an alternative route from Qal’a Salih to ’Amara via the Tigris left bank. The river is crossed by a flying ferry at Qal’a Salih. The actual crossing takes 10 to 15 minutes. The road is, however, no longer in general use and has been allowed to fall into disrepair. Stages No. of m Distance. Stage. Name. Inter. Total.

General The road from ’Amara to Kut al Imara is in a good state of repair and is passable for all arms ; it runs in close proximity to the river throughout the entire distance, and a continuous bund is maintained in good condition along the Tigris left bank to obviate excessive flooding during periods of high water. The country adjacent to the road is cultivated, and as the majority of the irrigation work is by flow, the road is intersected by innumerable culverts, all of which are bridged. Salt patches are encountered in many places, and extensive flooding may occur between ’Ali Gharbi and Shaikh Sa’ad during sudden spates of the Tigris. Deliberate flooding of large grazing areas in the vicinity of ’Ali Gharbi is not unusual. The only serious obstacle encountered between ’Amara and Kut al Imara is the Wadi, a small stream originating in the Persian foot-hills and liable to sudden rises up to 15 ft. after thunderstorms or heavy rain. This stream is spanned by a steel girder bridge near its junction with the Tigris. 2. Water Owing to its proximity to the Tigris water is plentiful throughout the route at all seasons. Water should invariably be obtained from the river in preference to the clear water which is abundant in the marshes and which is always either stagnant and unhealthy or full of purgative salts. 3. Supplies Kut al Imara and ’Amara are the only supply centres of any military value, though the villages of Kumait, ’Ali Gharbi, and Shaikh Sa’ad could be used as collecting centres from the surrounding districts. Estimates of the produc tive capacity of towns and villages appear in subsequent stages, where such information was obtainable. 4. Fuel Plentiful in the form of scrub and tamarisk thorn, especially in the vicinity of the Wadi and south of ’Ali Gharbi. Crude oil fuel is obtainable at ’Amara and Kut al Imara. 5. Transport Little animal transport is available between ’Amara and Kut al Imara. From ’Amara the following could be made available for military use at short notice: approximately 3,000 camels, 1,000 donkeys, and 500 horses. Water41 Route Report No. 1 f transport can be obtained without difficulty, and some 40-50 mahailas or safinas are normally in port at ’Amara awaiting cargo. There is good wharfage at ’Amara, Kumait (right bank), ’Ali Sharqi (left bank), Qal a Nahr Shumaish (left bank), ’Ali Gharbi (right bank), and Kut al Imara. 6. Grazing Forage crops show rapid growth during the winter, but in summer a shortage of grazing is usually experienced. At this period flocks and stock in the ’Amara division migrate from the left bank to the foot-hills of the Pusht-I-Kuh. Between the Wadi and Kut al Imara there is little grazing of any military value. 7. Obstacles Except during periods of high floods or after heavy rain, there are few natural obstacles between ’Amara and Kut al Imara. The only important water channels crossed are the Musharrah and Chahala Canals just north of ’Amara, the Nahr Sa’ad and the Wadi. The Musharrah and Chahala Canals are crossed by shaktur bridges and are unfordable. The Musharrah bridge is 120 ft. long with a 9 ft. wheel track, the Chahala bridge is 270 ft. long with a similar track for wheels. Both bridges are passable for all arms. They are shortly to be replaced by iron structures. The Nahr Sa’ad is merely a large controlled irrigation channel, spanned by a channel steel bridge with brick abutments ; length 12 ft., depth of channel 7 ft. The Wadi is spanned near its junction with the Tigris by a steel girder bridge supported on a concrete pier. It is in excellent repair and is passable for all arms. The river is liable to sudden spates after storms in the hills. The Wadi is fordable for infantry and cavalry 4 miles from its mouth during low water, and at Saiyid Yasin throughout the year. Special mention is made in subsequent stages of salt-encrusted or subka areas which are difficult for wheels, or impassable after heavy rain. 8. Additional Work Nil. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds Camping sites exist along the whole route. Selected sites at ’Amara, Nahr Sa’ad, Shaikh Juwi, ’Ali Sharqi, Qal’a ’Ajil, Qal’a Nahr Shumaish, Handhaliya, Shaikh Sa’ad, Falahiya, and Kut al Imara. Defined landing grounds for aircraft at ’Amara (3 M. la.58.37) and Kut al Imara (2 H/NE. 34b.20.45). Obsolete landing grounds or areas suitable for aircraft in emergency at ’Ali Sharqi, ’Ali Gharbi, and Shaikh Sa’ad. 10. Communications Rail. —Nil. Telegraph .—There are five telegraph lines from Basra to Baghdad. Between Basra and Kut al Imara the telegraph line runs along the right bank of the river. Road .—As detailed in stages. There are several lateral communications on the left bank, running across desert country to the Pusht-I-Kuh and linking up with the Iranian caravan routes, the most used being those which terminate at ’Amara, ’Ali Gharbi, and Shaikh Sa’ad. River .—The Tigris is navigable for river steamers not exceeding 4 ft. draught throughout the year.Route Report No. 1 42 11. Climate The climatic conditions of this area vary little from those of the rest of lower ’Iraq. The coldest months are December and January, the hottest, July and August. The rainy season begins in November and reaches its zenith in December and January. The prevailing wind is from the north west during most months of the year and, blowing direct from the Pusht-I-Kuh, renders the summer temperatures recorded in the districts from 'Amara to Shaikh Sa’ad lower than those recorded either at Baghdad or Basra. 12. Tactical The left flank of a force advancing by this route would be on the river bank the whole way, while hostile operations against the right flank would be considerably hampered by the Haur as Suwaicha and marsh areas to the north. Hostile concentrations in this district could be located by air recon naissance, as there is little or no cover for ground forces. The command that the Tigris has naturally over the left bank in flood season between Amara and Kut al Imara was, in conjunction with the Suwaicha Marsh, one of the main topographical obstacles to the success of our Army in its attempt to relieve General Townshend’s forces in Kut al Imara in February and May, 1916, when the marsh joined the river via the British trenches at Sanmyat. Between ’Amara and ’Ali Gharbi the road follows the course of the river and calls for no special comment. The Nahr Sa’ad is a controlled irrigation cut and could easily be bridged at all times. Heavy subkha ground is encountered in the vicinity of Kumait and ’Ali Sharqi, while flooding may occur during periods of high water or after heavy rain. Between ’Ali Gharbi and Shaikh Sa’ad the movement of troops over the marching route could be hampered during high water by the deliberate flooding of the adjacent country. An alternative but waterless route, stated to be passable for light lorries, lies some 10 miles to the north of the river road. 13. Rains and Floods Severe rain usually renders the road impassable for M.T. and exceptionally heavy for animal transport for periods of from 2 to / days. Fxtensive salt marshes adjoin the road in many places and remain in a water-logged con dition for long periods ; such areas are too general throughout the route to call for individual comment, though in certain cases detours over firmer ground are possible. A permanent bund has been built on the left bank along the whole stretch of river from ’Amara to Kut al Imara. 1 his bund is of sufficient strength to obviate flooding of the adjacent country under normal circumstances ; the weakest section lies between ’Ali Gharbi and Shaikh Sa’ad. The upkeep of bunds is carried out by the tribes whose lands they protect; the cost of repairs is, however, borne by the Government when bunds are broken by natural causes. 14. Inhabitants Sector I. Between ’Amara and the Wadi the route traverses Government lands, which are divided into estates or muqata’ahs, and held on lease by the leading shaikhs of the Bani Lam and Albu Muhammad. Under normal political conditions their attitude is friendly. These two tribes possess between them a total of some 19,000 modern rifles. Sector II. Between the Wadi and Kut al Imara there are smafl settle ments of Quraish, Mayyah, and the Sarraj sections of the Bani Rabi’a, who are semi-nomadic Shi’ahs. They are good cultivators, but possess poor lands owing to lack of irrigation facilities. They are notorious and fearless thieves.43 Route Report No. 1 Landing Ground. —Nil. The tribesmen on the right bank of the river have also an evil reputation and may be expected to take advantage of dark nights to cross the river on skins, should there be prospects of loot.

Date: —January, 1933. Map Reference: —J-in. ’Iraq Sheets 2 H/NE, 2 H/NW, 2 D/NE, 2 C/SE, 2 C/SW. 1. General In the dry season (May to November) the road is passable throughout for all arms. Between December and May the going after rain is exceptionally heavy and the ' subkha ” areas remain in a water-logged condition for many days after the surrounding district has dried up. The marching road is low lying and follows the general course of the Tigris River throughout its major portion. Extensive flooding may occur during high water either from failure of the protective bunds on the left bank, unauthorised breaches made by local cultivators, or seepage through the sub-soil into the marshy areas adjacent to the road ; the latter factor applies more especially to the district between Kut al Imara and ’Aziziya. The route runs in close promimity to the old Kut al Imara-Baghdad metre gauge railway, though the alignment of the latter is in many places ill defined. . , The route is well defined, spitlocked throughout its major portion, and sign posted at points where bifurcations or alternative roads exist. The general direction is north-west, following the north-eastern extremities of the river bends. The M.T. road only diverges from the marching road to avoid extensive cultivation or make obvious short cuts. 2. Water Owing to its close proximity to the Tigris River, water is plentiful throughout the route at all seasons, and animals can be watered direct from the main stream. 3. Supplies Kut al Imara and Baghdad form the only important market centres through which supplies of any military value could be obtained. 4. Fuel Oil fuel, cut date stems, and timber are available at Kut al Imara and at Baghdad ; there is no fuel en route. 5. Transport No animal or vehicular transport is obtainable between Kut al Imara aud Baghdad. The former town could probably furnish up to 500 donkeys and mules and 1,000 camels at short notice. A large number of civil M.T. vehicles ply between Kut al Imara and Baghdad, the majority of these vehicles are registered and owned at Baghdad.49 Route Report No. 1 Water transport could be collected without difficulty. Mahailas of from 20 to 50 tons burthen are plentiful, and an average of 30 or 40 of these craft are generally in port, either unloading or awaiting cargo, at Kut al Imara. 6. Grazing Fairly plentiful for horses and cattle between December and May , scanty during the summer months and insufficient to maintain the pack animals of any military force moving over this section of the route. 7. Obstacles Except during the flood season, or after heavy rain, few natural obstacles exist between Kut al Imara and Baghdad. All culverts and channels are strongly bridged and capable of taking axle loads up to 6 tons. Seventeen of these minor bridges have a span of 12 ft., but in all cases the actual water channels could be filled in and rendered passable for M.T. without difficulty ; the high banks of these irrigation cuts afford ample material for such work which would call for very little labour. The destruction of the bridge over the Diyala River in stage 6 would seriously hamper the movement of troops, and though the river is fordable -fnr in-fon+'t-.T in mpnir nlo •&gt; (7) Page 49, para. 7, lines 12 to 14.

Substitute :— The former combined railway and road bridge (Lancashire Bridge) was destroyed by floods in 1939, and at present the road only crosses the river by a single track floating bridge of seven pontoons, passable for all arms, but with steep approaches. Spare pontoons are normally available. Under normal weather conditions, the route is passable throughout for all arms without further labour. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds Each stage is within easy reach of the river, and the selection of alternative camp sites to those enumerated below would offer no difficulty. In the majority of cases camping grounds would require some advance preparation, as the ground is either lightly cultivated or part covered with scrub. Selected camping sites at Imam Mahdi, Shidhaif, ’Aziziya, Zor, Bustan, and Hinaidi. Defined landing grounds for aircraft exist at ’Aziziya (2 H/W.7b.60.75) and Kut al Imara (2 H/NE.34b.20.45). The suitability of the ground adjacent to other camping sites is commented on in each stage. 10. Communications Rail —Nil. The Kut al Imara-Baghdad metre gauge railway was removed in 1922. Telegraph .—Between Kut al Imara and Baghdad the telegraph line runs in close proximity to the route. River .—The Tigris is navigable throughout the year for river steamers up to 400 tons gross and with a draught of 3 ft. 6 in. or under. I he Diyala is navigable for small launches as far as Table Mountain during high water but maintains little river traffic, and shoals rapidly during the summer months. Roads .—Lateral communications are detailed in subsequent stages. A double bellum ferry across the Tigris, operated on a wire hawser, with a surface area of 24 ft. by 26 ft., and capable of transporting 5 light cars, exists 4 • 7 miles (by road) upstream of the town of Suwaira.49 Route Report No. 1 Water transport could be collected without difficulty. Mahailas of from 20 to 50 tons burthen are plentiful, and an average of 30 or 40 of these craft are generally in port, either unloading or awaiting cargo, at Kut al Imara. 6. Grazing Fairly plentiful for horses and cattle between December and May , scanty during the summer months and insufficient to maintain the pack animals of any military force moving over this section of the route. 7. Obstacles Except during the flood season, or after heavy rain, few natural obstacles exist between Kut al Imara and Baghdad. All culverts and channels are strongly bridged and capable of taking axle loads up to 6 tons. Seventeen of these minor bridges have a span of 12 ft., but in all cases the actual water channels could be filled in and rendered passable for M.T. without difficulty ; the high banks of these irrigation cuts afford ample material for such work which would call for very little labour. The destruction of the bridge over the Diyala River in stage 6 would seriously hamper the movement of troops, and though the river is fordable for infantry in many places above its junction with the Tigris during low water, the approaches are difficult, and permanent or temporary bridging would be essential for the passage of vehicles.

Camping and Landing Grounds Each stage is within easy reach of the river, and the selection of alternative camp sites to those enumerated below would offer no difficulty. In the majority of cases camping grounds would require some advance preparation, as the ground is either lightly cultivated or part covered with scrub. Selected camping sites at Imam Mahdi, Shidhaif, ’Aziziya, Zor, Bustan, and Hinaidi. Defined landing grounds for aircraft exist at ’Aziziya (2 H/W.7b.60.75) and Kut al Imara (2 H/NE.34b.20.45). The suitability of the ground adjacent to other camping sites is commented on in each stage. 10. Communications Rail —Nil. The Kut al Imara-Baghdad metre gauge railway was removed in 1922. Telegraph .—Between Kut al Imara and Baghdad the telegraph line runs in close proximity to the route. Ri ver , —The Tigris is navigable throughout the year for river steamers up to 400 tons gross and with a draught of 3 ft. 6 in. or under.

A double bellum ferry across the Tigris, operated on a wire hawser, with a surface area of 24 ft. by 26 ft., and capable of transporting 5 light cars, exists 4 • 7 miles (by road) upstream of the town of Suwaira.Route Report No. 1 50 11. Climate Normal for Central 'Iraq. Rains may be expected between November and April. High floods of the Tigris usually occur in March and April. 12. Tactical The route presents no serious difficulties from a tactical point of view, though its passability cannot be guaranteed during the months November to April inclusive. The left flank of a column advancing by this route would be on the left bank of the Tigris to Baghdad. On the right flank the country is flat, but owing to numerous irrigation cuts and areas of broken and swampy country, operations by armoured cars would be considerably curtailed. 13. Rains and Floods Rains may be expected between November and April, when the route may be temporarily impassable to M.T. for periods of from 3 to 10 days. Excessive spates of the Tigris, liable to occur between February and April when the snow melts in the hills, would gravely endanger the road in many places, and might render it totally impassable for a considerable period. To the north-west of Kut al Imara, the Haur as Suwaicha, Ataba and lesser depressions which hold water throughout the winter months are liable to spread in a southerly direction, and may directly or indirectly affect the passability of the marching route either by seepage or the presence of standing water. Note. —The high flood in March, 1925, did not interfere seriously with the normal motor route to Baghdad ; road communication was possible despite the fact that considerable tracts of country were under water. 14. Inhabitants {a) Sector I : Kut al Imara to Imam Mahdi. Various sections of the ’Amara division of the Bani Rabi’a (Shi’ahs). They are skilled cultivators, and since the occupation their conduct has been good. In the 1920 rebellion the Amir of Rabi’a rendered active assistance to the Government in suppressing disturbances on the Shatt al Gharraf, and their attitude had a steadying effect on the ’Amara and Pusht-I-Kuh tribes. Approximate male strength (left bank only) 1,000 ; 60 per cent, possess rifles. (b) Sector II : Imam Mahdi to Bawi .—^Various sections of the Shammar Toqah, offshoot of the Shammar, but not politically connected with either the Shammar of Najd or the Shammar Jarba of the northern Jazirah, and unlike these two groups, are Shi’ahs. Semi-nomadic, and live entirely in tents ; Approximate strength, 2,000 men, of whom 75 per cent, possess rifles. (c) Sector III: Bawi to Salman Pak. —Al Bathah section of the Ad Dulaim section of the Zubaid. Shi’ahs, sedentary cultivators, living chiefly in mud houses along the river bank. Are of no political significance, being entirely concerned with cultivation. Approximate strength, 200 men, about 33 per cent, possessing rifles. {d) Sector IV : Salman Pak to Diyala River. —Sections of the Jubur, who are of the same origin as the Zubaid. Sunnis, sedentary cultivators as above. Approximate strength, 400 men, about 33 per cent, possessing rifles. 15. Alternative Routes Nil.

It follows the general alignment of the Baghdad metre guage railway as far as Tuz Khurmatu, thence running in a northerly direction to Kirkuk. As far as the foothills of the Jabal Hamrin, the route traverses the feature less, alluvial plains of lower Iraq, crosses the Jabal through the Kurdaruz Pass, and striking west of the Sirwan river over the railway bridge at Julula (Qaraghan), follows the railway to Kingirban. From Kingirban the route traverses gently undulating country at the foot of the Kifn Dagh, Jabal Karach and Naft Dagh, crossing in succession the Aq Su at Tuz Khurmatu, by the railway bridge or by the ford, the 1 auq Chai either by the ford or by the bridge six miles upstream from Tauq village, and the Kaur Darra and Khasa Chai by means of fords. From Tauq to Taza Khurmatu the general physical characteristics of the district remain unchanged, though the route passes through slightly more undulating country than traversed in pre\ ious stages. It should be noted that in the longer stages additional camping grounds are included where water supply is available. 2. Water Generally speaking, an adequate supply of water is available for at least one brigade throughout the route, from permanent or semi-permanent sources. Normal health precautions with the water are necessary. (a) Between ' Baghdad and Julula (Qaraghan) the Diyala river and subsidiary channels, fed from this source, form the main water supply. The control of the canal-heads at Fable Mountain is essential in order to ensure a permanent supply in channels adjacent to the route. (b) Between Julula (Qaraghan) and Kingirban, water is available from the Qara Tepe canal, the Salahiya river and from numerous wells in villages through which the route passes. (c) Between Kingirban and Tuz Khurmatu little permanent water is available between May and December, though an adequate supply can be relied upon after the first rains. The Aq Su may be regarded as a permanent source of supply, though in summer, in common with many streams in this locality, the surface water may completely disappear for a considerable distance and then re-emerge through some fissure in the river bed. (d) Between Tuz Khurmatu and Tauq, water is obtainable from the Quri Chai (December to May) and from Tauq Chai. (e) Between Tauq and Kirkuk, water is obtainable from the Kaur Darra, Khasa Chai and subsidiary- controlled channels dependent there from.Route Report No 9. 57 3. Supplies A large part of the country traversed by this route is cultivated. The main supply centres through which the route passes are :— Scarce. Palm wood normally available at Ba’quba, A1 Muqdadiya (Shahraban) and As Sa’diya (Qizil Ribat). Bituminous coal of an inferior quality can be obtained from coal mines two miles east of Kifri. The Rafidain Oil Company have agencies at Ba’quba, A1 Muqdadiya (Shahraban), As Sa’diya (Qizil Ribat), Tuz Khurmatu and Kirkuk. 5. Transport Rail .—The Baghdad metre gauge railway runs in close proximity to the route as far as A1 Muqdadiya (Shahraban), where it diverges through the Jabal Hamrin and follows the Diyala river, rejoining the route at As Sa’diya (Qizil Ribat) and continuing thence within a few miles of the road as far as Kirkuk, the present railhead. River .—The Diyala flows immediately east of the route between Baghdad and Ba’quba, and to the west between Ba’quba and Julula (Qaraghan), but is navigable for rafts and light draught craft only. Animal .—Pack animals and donkeys are available in considerable numbers at Baghdad, Ba’quba, A1 Muqdadiya (Shahraban) and Kirkuk. The majority of the smaller villages could supply from 50 to 200 animals each. M.T .—A few M.T. vehicles might be available at Ba’quba and A1 Muqdadiya (Shahraban). A fair number are available at Kirkuk. 6. Grazing Limited between Baghdad and the Jabal Hamrin. North of the Jabal Hamrin there is some grazing between December and May, after which the spring grass dries up. 7. Obstacles {a) Serious obstacles could be created by the destruction of the bridges over the Diyala river (mile 33), the Marrut (mile 57), Haruniya (mile 65), and Ruz (mile 65-5) canals. The Sirwan river (mile 84-5), the Salahiya river (miles 107-6 and 109-2) and, in winter, the Aq Su (mile 138-3) and the Tauq Chai (mile 163). (b) In time of spate, ford crossings of Kura Chai (mile 124), Quri Chai (mile 151), the Kaur Darria (mile 177), the Khasa Chai (mile 183-5) and smaller wadis might prove serious temporary obstacles. 8. Additional Work Nil. The route is passable throughout, under normal weather conditions, for all military traffic. Ba’quba. A1 Muqdadiya (Shahraban). As Sa’diya (Qizil Ribat). Kingirban (from Kifri).

Communications Rail .—The Baghdad metre gauge railway runs in close proximity to the route as far as Kirkuk, the present railhead. The maximum divergence occurs during the passage of the Jabal Hamrin, where it crosses some 8 miles to the west of the route. Telegraph and Telephone .—Line roughly follows the route. Available at all railway stations, and at municipal offices at Ba’quba, A1 Muqdadiya (Shahraban), As Sa’diya (Qizil Ribat), Kifri, Tuz Khurmatu and Kirkuk. River .—The Diyala river flows east of the route as far as the railway crossing at Ba’quba, and west of the route to Julula (Qaraghan), where the route again crosses the river (here named theSirwan) and diverges in a westerly direction. Navigable for rafts and light draught craft only. 11. Inhabitants Between Baghdad and Ba’quba there are numerous small agricultural tribes in the area between the Tigris and Diyala rivers. North of the Ba’quba the following tribes lie to the east of the route traversed and cultivate the territory watered by the Mahrut and Ruz canals :—Bani Tamin, Bani Wais, Bani Rabi’a and a small section of the Jubur. Between Kingirban and Kirkuk the inhabitants are mainly Kurds on the east and Arabs on the west. East of the road are the Dauda and Zangana Kurds between Kifri and Tuz, thence to Kirkuk, the Talabani and Jabbari Kurds. West of the road are the Bayat (Turcomans) between Kifri and Tuz, thence to Kirkuk the ’Ubaid and Jubur (Arabs). Between Taza and Kirkuk the Kakai Kurds live on the west of the road. 12. Climate Normal for central ’Iraq. Rain may be expected between November and May. 13. Rains and Floods The Baghdad-Ba’quba section is liable to be cut if the Tigris bund above Baghdad is breached during spring floods. In this event an alternative route is generally made available. After heavy rain certain sections of the route, as detailed in stages, would remain impassable for wheeled traffic for varying periods up to 3-4 days. 14. Tactical Principal tactical features along the route are the Diyala river and the Jabal Hamrin range. South of the Jabal Hamrin the country generally is flat plain, becoming more undulating north of it. Between Kingirban and Tuz Khurmatu the route is dominated throughout by high ground to the north-east. Suitable for A.F.V.s throughout. 15. Alternative Routes Route No. 13 (Ba’quba-Diltawa-Injana-Sulaiman Beg) offers a good alternative track to Stages 3-8 of Route No. 9. It has the advantages of being shorter and quicker, and of avoiding a number of important river and canal crossings in these stages which could become serious obstacles to M.T. if bridges were destroyed. It has the disadvantage of being deficient in water and supplies, but is generally used by civilian M.T. traffic between Baghdad and Kirkuk. A track from Ba’quba via Dalli Abbas to Qara Tepe (Route Report No. 11, see page 363) quickly becomes bogged after only slight rain.Route Report No. 9 59 Stages No. of Distance. Stage. Name. Inter.

The road is tarmac throughout in this stage. The route leaves A1 Muqdadiya (Shahraban) in a north-easterly direction. In this stage the passage of the Jabal Hamrin is effected via the Kurdaruz Pass, while the physical characteristics of the country undergo a considerable change. The ground is harder and stonier, sandhills and undulating desert become general, eventually merging into the high, hilly country north of the Ruz canal. The country in the vicinity of the route is low lying and is liable to become water logged after heavy rain. Table Mountain is visible to the west of the road. The passage of the Jabal Hamrin offers no serious obstacle to M.T. After crossing the summit (558 ft.) the road descends to the Kurdarra River, which is crossed by a concrete ford.

For the first 8 miles the track runs through broken country, following the Kani Domlan range, which it crosses from west to east at mile 8 , and thence runs over open undulating country to Altun Kupri on the Lesser Zab. From Altun Kupri the route runs north by west to Erbil, and from that point in .a general north-easterly direction through mountainous country to Diana cross-roads. All major water channels are strongly bridged and numerous Irish crossings along the route present no difficulty. 2. Water Water is available throughout the year, either from rivers, wells, or karezes (underground water channels). After Erbil an unlimited supply from springs and mountain streams. 3. Supplies Altun Kupri and Erbil form centres for the collection of produce from the surrounding districts. Supplies are limited between Erbil and Diana. Details in stages. 4.

Grazing From December to May there is good grazing as far as the Spillik Pass and also on the Diana Plain. In a few more mountainous districts grazing is available up to July. 7. Obstacles Fully dealt with in stages, briefly epitomised as follows :— (a) Stages 2-3. The destruction of the bridges over the Lesser Zab at Altun Kupri (mile 27-5) would be a serious obstacle to any military movements along the route. A ford crossing for infantry might be found below the bridge, and, following the I.P.C. road from Kirkuk to the Lesser Zab, there is a Blondin aerial cableway (maximum load 5 tons) across the river some 8 miles downstream from Altun Kupri.70 Route Report No. 9 (b) Stage 8 . The destruction of any bridge in the Rowanduz G A 0 T r g e (miles 122-6 to 128-9) would form an insuperable obstacle to M.i. (c) Snow and ice may be encountered on sections of the route in winter. 8. Additional Work . Nil. The route is in constant use by M.T. and improvements are carried out from time to time. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds Details are given in stages. There is ample space for at least one brigade ^ at each of the selected camping sites.

Telegraph and Telephone.— Follows the alignment of the route throughout. 11. Climate. Normal for northern ’Iraq. 12. Tactical 1 The main tactical features of the route are the Lesser Zab crossing at Altun Kupri (mile 27-5), and, after leaving Erbil (mile 61-5) a number of parallel mountain ranges which are crossed, culminating in the passage of ^ the Rowanduz Gorge (miles 122-6 to 128-9). Between Kirkuk and Altun ♦ Kupri the route runs close to the Kani Domlan Dagh, a low range of foothills to the left, from which any movements along the route would be easily discernible.’ The route itself from mile 8 to Erbil (mile 61-5) runs over gently undulating country broken by small wadis, and normally suitable for opera tions by A.F.Vs. From Erbil onwards, where the country becomes more rugged and mountainous, it is not normally possible for M.T. to leave the road. The road in the Rowanduz Gorge is particularly vulnerable, being in a continuous defile, often cut into the hillside, and could be effectively blocked by air bombing. 13. Rains and Floods Heavy rain may fall between November and May, but the road is not likely to be affected to any great extent. In the Rowanduz Gorge stones, rocks and earth may be dislodged by rain and fall on the road, but could be cleared without difficulty. 14. Inhabitants Shuan Kurds inhabit the country- east of the road between Kirkuk and ^ Altun Kupri, and the Dizai Kurds between Altun Kupri and Erbil. The * population of Altun Kupri, and part of that of Erbil, is Turcoman, From Erbil the route traverses country inhabited by Khasnau, Surchi and Balikian Kurds, and by scattered colonies of Assyrians. The inhabitants would be unlikely to operate against British forces except in the event of general unrest. 15. Alternative Routes. Nil.Route Report No. 9 71 Stages Remarks. General Direction, N.N.W.

Map References : —£-in. Sheet:—1 D/NE £-in. Sheets :—1 H. 1. General The road is normally passable for all arms, but the Derbend— Iranian Frontier sector is liable to be blocked by snow in mid-winter. This can be cleared by gangs from neighbouring villages. The road is tarmac or metalled throughout. Iron bridges have been constructed over the Rubar-i-Rowanduz, which is closely followed by the road, the latter being equipped with culverts and Irish bridges wherever necessary. There are no gradients worth mentioning, but there are some narrow “ S ” bends which necessitate cautious driving. There are spaces at certain points wide enough for cars to be reversed. These are in the \icinity of Warakawin (mile 5-0 to 6-2, stage 1), Berserini Bridge (stage 1), Razanok Bridge (stage 1) ; in stage 2 at miles 7-7, 9-6, 11-5 to 13-4, and a large area in the vicinity of Novfirdan. Between Rayat and Haji Omaran there are several areas for large car parks. The whole of the road traverses mountainous country. It was specially constructed to withstand the rain and seasonal floods of northern ’Iraq, and would only be damaged by exceptionally heavy rainfall. Landslides might temporarily block the road during the rainy seasons. P.W.D. carry out minor repairs from time to time, from the P.W.D. depot at Razanok. 2. Water Unlimited supply of good water is obtainable throughout the year from the Rubar-i-Rowanduz and its tributaries. 3. Supplies Along the route only a negligible quantity of grain is procurable on demand, except at Alalan, Derbend and Rayat, at which villages grain, in small quantities, is obtainable. Rice is also obtainable in small quantities. Grain supplies for troops moving along the route should be arranged for in advance through Rowanduz and Erbil towns. 4. Fuel Wood is abundant along the whole route. Agencies of the Rafidain Oil Company exist at Diana, Jindian and Rowanduz. 5. Transport M. T .—From 5 to 10 light cars and from 3 to 6 lorries are usually to be found at Diana and Rowanduz, but that these would be available cannot be relied upon. In addition, lorries use this route for trade between ’Iraq and Iran. Arrangements for larger numbers should be made through Erbil town. A nimals .—At all stages 20-30 pack animals—ponies, mules and donkeys— could be assembled at 24 hours notice. A further 50 animals could be collected at 72 hours notice.Route Report No. 9 11b 6 . Grazing During the spring and early summer, grazing for about 100 animals is available along each stage of the route. During the summer, grass is found on the slopes of the hills. No grazing is to be found during the winter owing to snow. Very little fodder is available. 7. Obstacles There are six bridges along the route, destruction of which would create serious obstacles. The destruction of the steel bridges at Berserim, Razanok and Choman would form an insuperable obstacle to M.T. of every type and even to pack transport. The blocking of the defiles in the Berserini Goi ge by an enemy force would be a serious obstacle to a column. The road cou i easily be blocked by boulders rolled down the hillside. 8. Additional Work Very little required apart from normal upkeep. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds Spacious camping grounds are rare. Sites for camps exist, in the vicinity of Warakawin—for three battalions—and Razanok, where one battalion could be encamped in three small places. There is a good spacious camping ground for one brigade near Novfirdan, and a suitable camp site for two brigades exists between Ray at and Haji Omaran. No landing grounds exist along the route. 10. Communications Roads. —The road crosses the frontier and crosses the Azerbaijan Plain. Diana cross roads to Diana. Jindian to Rowanduz. Telegraph and Telephone.— Telegraph office at Rowanduz. The telephone line follows the general trend of the route. Telephones exist at Jindian and Rayat connecting with Rowanduz. W/T. —’Iraq Army at Rowanduz. Pack Tracks. —(i) Diana cross roads—Diana-Sitkan (1 D/NE.20c)-Chom- barok (27b)-Gelala (29c)-Rayat. (ii) Diana cross roads to Rowanduz. (iii) Jindian-Dergala (33b)-Rayat. (iv) Diana cross roads—Diana—Sideka-Kalishin. (v) Diana cross roads—Diana-Sitkan-Besha (21c)-Choman (21d)-Simelan (21d)-Rust-Girtek (22a)-Nawanda (23d)-Derbend-Rayat. 11. Climate Normal for Northern ’Iraq. 12. Tactical Mountain warfare tactics are necessary throughout the route as the greater part passes through high rocky country. The stretch presenting the greatest tactical difficulty is that through the Berserini Gorge. If occupied bv an enemv, the area at mile 3-3, Stage 1, the Warakawin entrance to the gorge to a point just beyond Razanok, and other areas in Stages 2 and o, would be extremely formidable obstacles.11c Route Report No. 9 Picqueting on both flanks along the whole route would be required, but is extremely difficult in most places. A scheme for combined combing and picqueting is necessary, especially as the terrain provides many excellent locations for ambushes. The following points require particular attention : (i) At mile 3 • 3 where the cliffs of the northern extremities of the Handren Dagh command the route at a distance of 50-70 yards. To the right of the entrance there is a cleft which affords a suitable position for ambush. (ii) At the Warakawin entrance of the Berserini Gorge. (iii) At the junction of the Pir Usu stream with the Rubar-i-Rowanduz. (iv) At Berserini bridge. (v) At the junction of the Chombarok stream with the Rubar-i-Rowanduz. (vi) At Razanok bridge. A series of natural defensive positions up to Rayat post are provided by successive ridges. Gorges have been noted as they are the most vulnerable parts of the road ; accurate bombing would not be necessary because, where the road is cut steeply under the hillside, one bomb would cause a landslide. Gorges as follows :— (a) Miles 2—4-7. (lo) Miles 8-2—9-2. (c) Miles 16-2—19-6. (d) Mile 24-5. (e) Miles 28-7—30-7. 13. Rains and Floods This road has been specially constructed to withstand the rains and seasonal floods of northern 'Iraq, and it would only be damaged by exceptional rainfalls. The bankings of all sectors of the road are liable to landslides, due to heavy rains and floods which might put sections of it out of action for short periods, but this is unlikely. The sector Derbend—Iranian frontier is liable to snow drifts between December and mid-March. Melting snow and rain may cause dislodged stones, rocks and earth to fall on the road, but this could easily be cleared. The route is substantially bridged and should be impervious to flooded streams. 14. Inhabitants The inhabitants are mainly the Balik, a Kurdish tribe which could probably muster about 300 rifles. Their attitude would probably depend on the political situation. They have remained amenable to government control since the 1923 Rowanduz operations. They might oppose the Government in the event of a Kurdish nationalist rising, as long as they were assured that it stood a fair chance of success. Unlikely to operate against British forces except in the event of general unrest. 15.

General The route is passable for all arms except after heavy rain, when it may be impassable for mechanical transport for 1 or 2 days. The adjacent country is featureless except for the towns of Balad Ruz and Mandali, both of which are hidden in palm groves. The destruction of bridges and culverts in dry weather would not prevent the passage of mechanical transport, though work would be necessary either to repair the damage or to make a deviation practicable. 2. Water Numerous irrigation ditches between Ba’quba and Balad Ruz. Between Balad Ruz and Mandali the route is practically waterless. There are a few wells in Balad Ruz and Mandali, but the inhabitants rely on the Ruz Canal and the Gangir River from Iran respectively for their water. 3. Supplies Wheat, barley and rice can be obtained at Ba’quba, Mahrut and Balad Ruz. Plentiful supplies of meat at short notice at Ba’quba and Balad Ruz. 4. Fuel Cut date stems are available at Ba’quba, Balad Ruz and Mandali. None en route. 5. Transport One thousand donkeys and 300 mules could be collected from the area at ten days’ notice. 6. Obstacles (a) Natural. —Nil. (ft) Artificial. —There is a number of culverts along the route which, if destroyed, would require labour to repair or to make deviations possible. If the Ab-i-Naft bridge were broken, it would take 30 men approximately two hours to make ramps down the banks. If the river contained over 2 ft. of water a deviation would not be possible. The river bed is dry except during rains. 7. Additional Work Nil.79 Route Report No. 10 8.

General This route is a newly made military road passable for all types of transport, but likely to be impassable for several days after heavy rain. It is clearly defined, graded, and approximately 40 ft. wide, running straight across country. Surrounding country for the first 20 miles is flat unbroken desert, but from Chaichan (Hamidiya ?) onwards it becomes more broken with numerous irrigation ditches and low mounds. The new track marking ends at Mile 21 and recommences 5 miles later. Work appeared to be in progress in the intervening 5 miles as if to by-pass Chaichan some distance to the right of the existing track through the village. 2.

Stages : —3. Authority : —Air Staff Intelligence, ’Iraq. Date : —November, 1940. Map References :—’Iraq Surveys £-in. : 2 B/NE, 2 B/SE, 2C/NE 1. General This route offers a good alternative track to Stages 3-8 of Route Report No. 9 (Baghdad—Kirkuk—Rayat). It has the advantages of being shorter and quicker, and of avoiding several important river and canal crossings (the Diyala, Sirwan, and Salahiya rivers ; the Mahrut, Haruniya, Ruz and Qara Tepe canals) which could become serious obstacles to M.T. if bridges were destroyed. It has the disadvantage of lacking water and supplies after Diltawa (Mile 12-4) except for a few doubtful wells in villages north of Injana (Mile 65-1). For normal civilian M.T. traffic between Baghdad and Kirkuk and the north, it is the route most commonly used. The track is passable for all M.T. in dry weather ; but one day’s heavy rain would render the track impassable for wheeled transport for several days. This applies particularly to the area just north of Diltawa. 2. Water In the vicinity of B'aquba and Diltawa an unlimited supply of water is available, both in winter and summer. There are a few wells on the Injana Plain but these dry up during the summer months. 3. Supplies Supplies are plentiful at B'aquba and Diltawa. A limited supply of sheep might 'be procured from bedouin encampments on the Injana Plain and from villages north of Injana. 4. Fuel Petrol on this route is obtainable at B'aquba and Diltawa. Limited quantity of wood fuel available in B'aquba and Diltawa. 5. Transport Transport of various kinds, including a few cars, is available at B'aquba and Diltawa.* 6 . Grazing An unlimited grazing area exists oil the Injana Plain during the winter and spring months. There is cultivation over large areas near B'aquba, Diltawa and Sulaiman Beg. 7. Obstacles Between B'aquba and Diltawa several large irrigation ditches exist, crossed by bridges. Some of these bridges are constructed of wood and steel girders, while others are built of brick. Demolition of any of these bridges would render the entry or exit of wheeled transport into Diltawa temporarily impossible.Route Report No. 13 8(M 8. Camping and Landing Grounds Camping ground sites exist at almost any point along the track. 9. Communications There are telephone and telegraph offices at B'aquba and Diltawa; Injana police post is connected by telephone with Sulaiman Beg, the tele phone wires running parallel to the track. 10. Climate As for central ’Iraq. 11. Tactical Stage 1 .—The track passes through a low-lying cultivated area with numerous irrigation ditches. The destruction of bridges crossing, these irrigation ditches would impose delay. The banks and ditches afford excellent cover. Stage 2.—The same tactical features as for Stage 1. Stage 3.—-Little or no cover exists in this area, as the track runs across the Injana Plain, and is well defined and marked by two furrows, though diver sions and alternative tracks may be found throughout. I he area surrounding Injana is broken, undulating country affording excellent cover. Wheeled traffic would be confined to the road. This type of country extends practically to Sulaiman Beg. 12. Rains and Floods Rain would render most of the track unserviceable for wheeled transport for varying periods according to the length and severity of the downpour. 13. Inhabitants Arabs-.

General A good road with tarmac surface its whole length, fit for passage of all arms, including heavy M.T., except after snow, when it may be blocked for 2-3 days at a time in the vicinity of the Tasluja Pass. It will take one con tinuous line of traffic with room to pass throughout its length. The first stage traverses comparatively barren countiy of broken sandstone hills and comparatively little water. The main feature of the route is the Bazian Pass ; beyond this the country changes, and it becomes more highland in character. The long steep ascent to the Tasluja Pass has a gradient of about 1 in 4. 2. Water From November to May there is water in all the streams along the route and numerous springs in the surrounding hills. For the rest of the year there is water sufficient for a battalion at Qara Anjir and vicinity of the Bazian Police Post, and water for a brigade divided between Kani Shaitan and Ulubulagh and at Tainal and Kaliasan respectively. Numerous springs in and around villages make it easy to find water for a battalion split into companies at other points. 3. Supplies Most villages keep flocks of 100-300 sheep and goats. Other supplies are strictly limited. 4. Fuel Nil. 5. Transport About 250 mules and 1,000 donkeys could be collected in the Sulaimaniya area at two weeks’ notice. 6 . Grazing For the first 10 miles out of Kirkuk, nil. From Qara Anjir to the Bazian Pass there is good grazing from March to May, and from Bazian to Sulaimaniya better grazing up to June. The Plain between Bazian and Tasluja provides the best grazing along the route. 7. Obstacles The only natural obstacle is snow or the roads being covered with a layer of ice for short periods. Artificial obstacles could be&lt;preated by the destruc tion of bridges at Miles 29, 45 and 64. The destruction of the bridge over Kirkuk River on leaving the town would create a serious obstacle during the rainy season when the river is unfordable.Route Report No. 17 86 8. Additional Work Nil. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds There is wide space for camping around Chemchemal, the plain between Bazian and Tasluja, and the plain from Tasluja to Sulaimaniya. Ground for a brigade camp exists at Qara Anjir. There are marked landing grounds at Kirkuk and Sulaimaniya. Landing grounds could be made on the plain between Bazian and Tasluja and around Mile 58. 10. Communications Rail. —Baghdad-Kirkuk (metre gauge). Road .—Motor roads from Mosul, Qizil Robat, and Fat-ha to Kirkuk. Motor road from Rania joins the route at Mile 62. Motor roads from Qaradagh, Choarta, Penjwin and Halabja to Sulaimaniya. Telephone .—Between Kirkuk and Sulaimaniya with connections at several police posts along the route. Connected from Kirkuk with ’Iraq telephone system, and from Sulaimaniya to other centres in the district. Telegraph .—Between Sulaimaniya and Kirkuk, and from Kirkuk to other parts of ’Iraq. From Sulaimaniya to other centres in the district. 11. Climate Normal for southern Kurdistan. 12. Tactical The route passes through exceptionally broken country of small hills and deep valleys from Kirkuk to the Bazian Pass, with the exception of a plain from Miles 26-28. The main tactical features are the Bazian Pass and the Tasluja Pass, both of which ranges command the country on each side. Picketing would be required along most of the route up to Tasluja. 13. Rains and Floods No part of the route is liable to flooding. Water splashes at Miles 7, 31 and 59 are liable to rise from 2-4 ft. in depth for a few hours during spates between December and March. The ground beside the route from Bazian to Tasluja becomes boggy and may undermine the road foundations, causing local subsidences in spring, but the road is always .passable. 14. Inhabitants The inhabitants are Kurdish throughout the route, excepting Turcomans in the town of Kirkuk. A few Arab nomads come to the country around Qara Anjir during the summer. The area around Chemchemal to the Bazian Pass is dominated by the HamaWand tribe ; south-east of the Bazian Pass the villages are dominated by the Shaikhs of Sulaimaniya, and the route from Tainal to Tasluja by the Ismail ’Uzairi tribe. The inhabitants are warlike and possess rifles, but would be unlikely to cause trouble except in the case of general unrest or distrubances incited by the Iraqi authorities. 15. Alternative Routes None passable by M.T. A route via Erbil could be made by joining Koi Sanjaq and Rania (24 miles) by a motor road.87 Route Report No. 17 Stages No. of Name of Distance. Stage.

General 1 his route is fit for all arms, including heavy M.T. in dry weather, but after heavy rain quickly becomes unfit for mechanical vehicles of any kind. There are no bridges on the route, and the few culverts over irrigation channels, if in disrepair, can be avoided by crossing the beds of the channels. The route followed is across the desert from Kirkuk (2 A/SW.5b) to Tall ’Ali (138 M/SE.9a), and then forking left, again across the desert to A1 Tat-ha (138 M/SE.31b), where the river is crossed by ferry. From here an engineered road is followed through Baiji (138 N/NW. 6 d), and thence by desert tracks between the railway and Tigris river to Tikrit (138 N/NE.27c). 2. Water There is no water at the end of the first and third stages. At Tall ’Ali unlimited water is obtainable from the Lesser Zab; and at A1 Fat-ha, Abu Rajash (138 N/NE.13d), and Tikrit, from the Tigris. If necessary, water can also be brought by rail to the halt at the end of Stage 5 (Abu Rajash). Ihe only other permanent supply of water along the route is in the neigh bourhood of Yachi (2 A/SW.3d), where there are irrigation channels and karezes which contain water throughout the year. 3. Supplies There is no source of supply along the route except Tall ’Ali, where advance arrangements would ensure the provision of cereals, meat, and fodder for two battalions from the various villages along the river bank. At present, in this area, few crops are grown except those required for local consumption, but the completion of the irrigation scheme at present in progress at Tall ’Ali may alter this considerably. 4. Fuel Very limited. In the neighbourhood of Tall’Ali miscellaneous small trees and shrubs are plentiful along the course of the Lesser Zab ; but as these are generally located on small islands, a considerable period is necessary for their collection. The I.P.C. refinery at Kirkuk supplies only enough oil for itsown consumption. 5. Transport Animal transport very limited and mostly useless for military purposes. In January, 1936, a total of 163 cars and 80 lorries were registered in the Kirkuk Liwa.91 Route Report No. 18 6 . Grazing From the first rains, about the beginning of December to the foHowmg April, there is excellent rough grazing throughout the route. This spring growth is, however, very light, and by mid-April it is burnt up, and file terrain assumes a barren aspect, save only along the banks of the Lesser Zab rivers. 7 • Obstacles Natural.—In its present condition, the only obstacle along the route m dry weather is the river crossing at A1 Fat-ha, where there is no P^ssi e ford, and a ferry or pontoon bridge is essential.

Stages :—(Not defined for wheeled transport.) Authority :—Air Staff Intelligence, ’Iraq. Date: —November, 1939. Map References: —J-in. maps 2A/SW, 138M/SE, 138N/NE. 1. General This route is fit for light cars and field guns in dry weather only. The main feature on the route is the Jebel Hamrin range, which is crossed by the Nukhaila Pass (138M/NE.12a). The passage of the Zaghaitun wadi in 138N/NE.6b is difficult after the first rains until early summer ; otherwise the route is desert except for cultivated land and irrigation channels for a few miles at each end. Excepting the crossing of the Jebel Hamrin, the track is earth throughout its length. 3. Water There are permanent \yells at Miles 7 and 8, and springs in the Jebel Hamrin at ’Ain Khalid (Mile 48) and 'Ain Nukhaila (Mile 50). Their water contains salts which are highly purgative. The water at Mile 50 would suffice one platoon and that at Mile 48 slightly less. In the spring and early summer there is water in wadis and depressions in the desert as well as the hills, and at the Zaghaitun crossing there are Arab water holes throughout the year. The river at Tikrit contains water for a force of any size. 3. Supplies Nil. 4. Fuel Nil. 5. Transport Nil. fi. Grazing Nil, except in spring—as for central 'Iraq.Route Report No. 18a 98c 7. Obstacles Ihe track through the Jebel Hamrin is liable to be broken by water channels after rain, but these can be filled in with ease as the ground is soft and earthy. The same condition exists on the approaches to the wadi crossings. No stone or wood exists except in the Jebel Hamrin, where some soft stone may be obtained. 8. Additional Work The approaches to the wadi crossings in Miles 40-42 and Mile 51 could be improved by ten men with spades in two hours. The cutting at Mile 48 requires levelling (20 men with spades and pickaxes for two hours), and the road cut into the hillside at Mile 50 requires widening by at least 2 ft. for 100 yards to make it safe for passage of M.T. The ridges of rock across the road between Miles 46 and 48 should be cut level. A temporary measure would consist of filling in the depression on each side of the ridge with earth to prevent sumps being torn out. To make the passage of the jebel Hamrin fit for regular use by M.T. about one week’s work by 200 men is required. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds Unlimited camping and landing ground exists except in the Jebel Hamrin area. 10. Communications There is a ferry at Tikrit capable of transporting light cars, thence an M.T. route to Baghdad. Telegraph and telephone exists at Kirkuk and Tikrit. 11. Climate Normal for central ’Iraq. 12. Tactical The passage of the Jebel Hamrin is the main tactical feature. Various hills and ridges of high ground along the route form possible O.P.s or defensive positions. 13. Rains and Floods Normal for central ’Iraq. The route from Mile 40 to Mile 53 is impassable by M.T. throughout the rainy season. 14. Inhabitants The inhabitants throughout the route are Arab nomads of the ’Ubeid tribe ; sections of the Sayih (Shammar) wander some miles east of the route south of the Jebel Hamrin. They would be unlikely to try to oppose a military force except in the event of general unrest or when fomented by the ’Iraq authorities. 15. Alternative Routes (a) An alternative route exists from Kirkuk to Tikrit via A1 Fat-ha (138 M/SE.31b), which is possible by M.T. up to A1 Fat-ha. The section from A1 Fat-ha to Tikrit (on the east bank of the river) was used by M.T. several years ago, but has fallen into disrepair. Probably it could be made serviceable for the passage of all arms in dry weather by filling in water channels, etc. (b) A route to Bushairiya (2 A/SW.22a) and thence turning west to join the main route may be used when leaving Kirkuk.9Sd Route Report No. 18a Stages No. of Stage. 1 Name of Stage.

Stages : —3. Authority :—Air Staff (Intelligence), ’Iraq. Date : —4th March, 1934. Map References :—’Iraq Surveys, £-in., 2 A/NVV, 138 M/NE, 137 P/SE. 1. General In dry weather this route is passable for all arms, including heavy motor transport, but after heavy and continuous rain certain sections of the road would become impassable for heavy wheeled traffic for at least 48 hours after rain had ceased. The first 4 • 3 miles of the route passes through the foothills of the Jabal Avanah. The remainder of the country traversed is a large undulating plain. The surface of the road is unmetalled. There are no hedges or ditches on either side of the road and it is possible to drive off the track almost anywhere. The Jabal Avanah is situated to the left of the road at a distance of approximately’ 2-3 miles. There is only one iron and concrete bridge over the Inja Su and one stone culvert at mile 10-3 (1st Stage). 2. Water There is an unlimited supply of clean water at Altun Koprii and Quwair from the Lesser Zab and Greater Zab Rivers respectively. Water is also obtainable at all villages along the route in varying quantities and qualities. The villagers draw their water from wells, and the average daily yield of each well is about 100-150 gallons. The wells at Sorbash and Shaikh Shir wan are inadequate for a force of any size, and hand pumps and field troughs would be necessary for watering animals. There is an irrigation canal and a small stream at mile 4-6. 3. Supplies (a) Without notice supplies sufficient for one battalion for one week could be collected from villages along route. Supplies would consist of sheep and wheat in large quantities from the Dizdai villages along the route and also barley and bhoosa in limited quantities. (b) At short notice (2 to 3 days) approximately two battalions could be maintained for a fortnight from the villages along the route. (c) In the summer and harvest season, approximately one brigade could be maintained for about 40 days from the villages along the route. {d) Normally, supplies for a force moving along the route could be obtained from the four chief centres, viz Kirkuk, Altun Koprii, Quwair, Mosul.Route Report No. 19 100 4. Fuel Fuel is scarce along the route. At Quwair scrub and wood are available m small quantities. An Agency of the Rafidain Oil Company exists in Quwair, but only very small quantities of petrol are normally held. It is procurable at no other point along the route. 5. Transport Motor Transport. —Arrangements for M.T. must be made through Kirkuk or Mosul towns. Animals. —80-100 mules could be assembled at any stage within 48 hours’ notice (except during harvest or cultivating seasons). With 8 days’ notice, about 500-800 mules and donkeys could be assembled at any point on the route. 6. Grazing The grazing during the spring and early summer is fair. Generally speaking, there would be sufficient grazing within easy distance of the route for 200-400 animals. 7. Obstacles Except for the bridge at Inja Su (2 A/NW. 14c.9.4), no obstacles are encountered. 8. Additional work Requires metalling. Additional work would be required over certain sections after heavy rain. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds Camping grounds are unlimited throughout. A landing ground exists at Altun Koprii. Landing grounds could be constructed at practically all section* of the route. 10. Communications Roads :— Altun Koprii-Kirkuk. Erbil-Quwair. Dibega-Quwair. Telegraph and Telephones. —Telegraph station exists at Altun Koprii. There is a telephone at Quwair. 11. Climate Normal for Northern ’Iraq. 12. Tactical (a) The occupation of the hills (137 P/SE.Sq. 31a and b) in the vicinity of Quwair, by the enemy, would close the route between Gamesh Tepe (137 P/SE.25d. 10.05) and Quwair. The occupation of the Jabal Avanah by an enemy equipped with artillery would interrupt communications. (b) The foothills of the Jabal Avanah and the hills in the vicinity of Quwair would require picqueting. Flank guards would suffice over the remainder of the route. (c) The greater part of the terrain is ideal cavalry country and armoured cars could operate over the plains. {d) Concealment from air observation would be difficult.101 Route Report No. 19 13. Rains and Floods (a) After heavy rains certain sections of the road would not be fit for heavy wheeled traffic for at least 48 hours. (b) No section of the road is seriously affected by floods. 14. Inhabitants The greater part of the country passed through is inhabited by the Kurds of the Dizdai tribe. This tribe as a whole is amenable to Government control. The Dizdai were formerly a powerful tribe and their strength amounted to approximately 6,000 armed men. The number of armed men at the present time is approximately 2,400. There are few Arab villages in Stage 3. Altun Koprii is inhabited mainly by Turcomans. 15. Alternative Routes There are two alternative routes, viz. :— (a) Altun Koprii-Erbil-Quwair.

Map References :—£ inch : 2 E/NW, 2 A/NE, 1 D/SE, 1 H/SW. 1. General The route is fit for the passage of all arms including M. f. up to 6 tons in weight for any vehicle (the carrying capacity of the three ferries at Miles 40, 54 and 71). The route is tarred most of its length and short stretches not completed are now being tarred except where the surface is natural gravel or rock ; it is fit for all-weather use except when the Lesser Zab river is in flood. Concrete girder bridges with approaches on the embankments where necessary have been or are being built over all wadi crossings in Stages 1-3. Stages 1 and 2 are over rolling downs interspersed with broken country and small hills. Stage 3 is through hilly tree-covered country. Stage 4 is through a rocky gorge followed by a tarred road winding through hilly country west of the river. Stages 5 and 6 are undulating plain broken only by the mountain range across the route at Derbend-i-Rania (Mile 66). 2. Water Water is obtainable from many springs and streams in Stages 1-3, limited normally to the requirements of one battalion at any one place. From Mile 27 onwards there is ample water for forces of unlimited size from the Lesser Zab which is always within reach. 3. Supplies Villages along the route are poor and produce little beyond their own requirements. Supplies could be collected at the administrative centres of Surdash, Mirza Rustum (Mile 54), and Qala Diza (Mile 75). Each village could supply 40-200 sheep and goats, and large numbers could be collected at 10 days’ notice. Barley and hay are obtainable in quantity during the summer and autumn at 7 days’ notice to collect from the villages. 4. Fuel Tree$ and brushwood are obtainable from the river at Mile 4 (Kaliasan). From Mile 28 to 36 the route passes through hills covered with stunted (mountain) oak trees, and there are small groups of trees in several wadis along the route. The Merga and Qala Diza Plains (Stages 4-6) are bare, but there is brushwood in the bed of the Lesser Zab. 5. Transport No transport except donkeys and a few mules in villages are available after leaving Sulaimaniya.106 Route Report No. 23 6 . Grazing Good grazing throughout the route from February to June or July, except in Stage 3 where it is negligible. 7. Obstacles Natural obstacles are the three crossings of the Lesser Zab, which are crossed by ferries, but are liable to be impassable for a few days when the river is in flood. The ferry near Mirza Rustum (Mile 55) is liable to be blocked when the water is at a certain level owing to a stony bank in the middle which may ground the ferry while the water on the east side of it has not reached a low enough level for M.T. to ford it. On such occasions it would be necessary to alter the position of the ferry with its attendant supports at each end. Artificial obstacles could be created by : • (a) destruction of the ferries ; (b) destruction of the road at suitable points in Miles 41-52 and 65-67 ; (c) between December and May by the destruction of the Kaliasan bridge at Mile 4 ; (d) a minor obstacle could be created by the destruction of the bridge at Mile 28 between December and May. 8. Additional Work Tarring and widening of the road is being carried out. Strong embank ments and bridges are being built over wadis to eliminate narrow curves round them. Bridges in place of the ferries would be required to expedite passage of heavy traffic. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds Baba Geldi (Mile 6). Unlimited camping ground and space for a landing ground, but water limited. Girdabor (Mile 17). Unlimited camping and space for landing ground. Kani Miran (Mile 26). Unlimited camping ground. Water from springs and karezes. Chem-i-Tabin (Mile 28). Camping ground for one brigade. Water from stream. Mile 37-40. Camping ground for a division on bank of river. Plentiful water throughout the year. Space for army co-operation landing ground. Mirza Rustom (Mile 54). Unlimited camping ground on both sides of river. From Mile 55-64 there is unlimited ground for camping and several possible landing-ground sites. Qala Diza (Mile 75). Unlimited camping ground and space for landing ground east of village. Water normally limited to about one brigade. There are marked landing grounds at Sulaimaniya and Sarsian (Mile 64). 10. Communications (a) (i) Telephone line along the route from Sulaimaniya to Mirza Rustum. (ii) Telephone at Sengeser (on north bank of river at Mile 66) to Rania, Koi Sanjaq and Erbil. (iii) Police wireless at Sulaimaniya, Qala Diza and Bingird (near Mirza Rustum (Mile 54), 7 miles east of route). (b) (i) A wooden ferry capable of taking about 2 tons exists in the Derbend-i-Rania (Mile 66) whence there is a fair-weather M.T. road to Rania (1 D/SE. 17d). %107 Route Report No. 23 (ii) Another possible M.T. route to Rania leaves route at MUe 55 on the west bank of the river ; but the ford at Mulla Omar (1 D/SL.3ba) a impassable to M.T. owing to silt being washed down, into which vehicle 3 sink. It is temporarily used from time to time by filling the crossing v j i ou c c (iii) M.T. route exists from Mile 55 to Bingird (1 H/SW.31b). (iv) From July to October M.T. can reach Rania from Qala Diza by a rough track over fords at Zharawa (1 H/SW.19d) and road cut into the rock on north bank of stream through the Derbend-i-Rania. 11. Climate Normal for northern ’Iraq. Route is unlikely to be blocked by snow. 12. Tactical (a) Up to Mile 27 route traverses open rolling country and presents no outstanding feature. It crosses the watershed at Mile 29, thence it is commanded by hills on right up to ferry at Mile 40. (b) The road through the gorge in Miles 41-45 is commanded by the hills on the-east side of the river from where a small guerilla force could close t e route. (c) The route is commanded at the passage of the Derbend-i-Rania at Mile 66 by the mountain range through which the river flows. 13. Rains and Floods The route is not liable to flooding, but after heavy rain the Lesser Zab may reach speeds which render ferry-crossings dangerous. From Mile dd- 75 the* whole country is thick mud during winter, and the tarred road would be liable to sink if used continuously by heavy traffic. 14. Inhabitants Up to Mile 40 the route is through the lands of the Ismail Uzairi and Jafati tribes, and from Miles 41-55 are villages of settled inhabitants of the Shillana, who would be over-run in time of unrest either by the Piran to the west or the Pizhder to the east. The tribe most likely to cause trouble is the Piran The others would be unlikely to operate against British forces except in case of a general rising. The Pizhder are the least under ’Iraq Government influence. 15. Alternative Routes No alternative routes fit for passage of M.T. No. of Stage. 1 Name. Girdabor . . Distance. Inter.

Map References: —£-in., 2E/NW, 2E/NE, 2E/SE. 1. General The route is metalled or tarred throughout* its length and is fit for the passage of all arms, including heavy M.T., throughout the year. In the first stage it winds and undulates along the spurs at the foot of the Gweyzha Dagh, with many sharp bends and bridges round wadis. In the second stage the road is on the plain but within tactical range of the hills. In the third stage a straight tarred road on tarred foundations crosses the soft marshy Sharizur Plain. 2. Water There are numerous springs and streams along the route and the water is good throughout the year. Water for a force of several divisions is found at Serao and Zerdiyan. 3. Supplies The villages along the route have only limited supplies of wheat and barley for their own needs, but 100-300 sheep or goats could be obtained from every village and larger numbers could be collected from the area at three days’ notice. In the spring and autumn when the nomadic Jaf are in the Sharizur Plain, 10,000 sheep and goats or 1,000 cattle could be collected at four days’ notice. 4. Fuel Wood fuel for one company could be supplied from villages along the route without notice, except after snow. If animal transport is available unlimited w r ood can be collected from the north side of the Gweyzha Dagh at two days’ notice. The Sharizur Plain is bare, except for trees along streams. 5. Transport A few mules and donkeys are available at villages along the route, but larger numbers could be collected at one week’s notice. Scarcity of mules in this are.a has proved a difficulty in previous operations ; at present probably 150-200 mules and 1,500 donkeys could be collected in ten days. 6 . Grazing There is good grazing along the route from December to April, and in the Sharizur Plain up to September. 7. Obstacles The only natural obstacle along the route is snow in Stage 1, which may render the road impassable by M.T'. up to five days at a time. Artificial obstacles could be created by the destruction of bridges round wadis in Stage 1, or by the bridges at Miles 32 and 37 at any season except late summer to autumn.Route Report No. 24 109 8. Additional Work There are stretches in Stages 1 and 2 which would require further metalling if the road were regularly used by heavy M.T. in wet weather, owing to the inferior metalling existing. There is unlimited stone along the route, except in Stage 3 where there is none. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds Arbet. —Unlimited camping ground for a force of any size, but water is limited in the dry- season. Suitable landing ground all round. Milan. —Unlimited camping and landing ground in the area and a plentiful supply of water. Sharizur Plain. —Unlimited camping and landing ground anywhere, but is liable to be marshy in wet weather (i.e. until end of April). Halabja. —Camping ground for a force of any size. Marked landing ground on edge of town. Water plentiful. 10. Communications Telephone and telegraph lines between Sulaimaniya-Halabja-and Penjwin. Helio communication between police posts along the route. Motor road from Penjwin meets route at Mile 32. Fair-weather M.T. roads from Nodeh (2E/NE.25d) and Barzinja (2E/NE.35c) join the route in Miles 14 and 21 respectively. 11. Climate The Sharizur Plain becomes very humid and unhealthy in summer ; while the whole route is cold and liable to snow in winter, snow rarely occurs in the Sharizur. December to February are the coldest months. Stage 1 is liable to a violent wind (called the Rashaba) from the Gweyzha Dagh which is very cold in winter and hot in summer. It is liable to blow snowdrifts across the road. Malaria is very prevalent in the Sharizur, except in winter, and the area between Arbet and Muan abounds in a type of black scorpion whose bite is sometimes fatal. 12. Tactical The route is commanded by the Gweyzha Dagh along Stage 1, and from Mile 24-27 the hills on both sides make an excellent ambush. At Mile 32 the rocks of Seyid Sadiq (wrongly shown on map as Seyid Ishaq) command the road and the whole Sharizur Plain. From Mile 33 onwards the country is flat except for ancient artificial mounds 30-40 ft. above the plain which make good O.Ps. 13. Rains and Floods Rains last from November to May and are exceptionally heavy from mid-December to February. Flooding does not occur except in the immediate vicinity of the rivers at Miles 37 and 39, when the bridge founda tions may be weakened or wrecked by the water. 14. Inhabitants In the first stage the inhabitants are under the influence of the Shaikhs of Suiaimania, while in Stage 2 and 3 the villagers are settled Jaf ; the nomadic Jaf cover the Sharizur Plain in the spring and autumn. Some of the villages around Zerdiyan and the Zulm river are under the influence of the Neqshbendi Shaikhs. None would be likely to act against a force except in the event of general unrest. The nomadic Jaf are renowned for petty pilfering.110 Route Report No. 24 15. Alternative Routes (a) An alternative route from Seyid Sadiq to Halabja goes via Khurmal (2I/SW.13a), but is liable to be impassable (especially between Seyid Sadiq and Khurmal) owing to marshes after rain.

Stages : —2. Authority :—Air Staff (Intelligence), 'Iraq. Date : —7th July, 1940. Map References | in. : 2 E/NW, 2 E/SW. 1. General The route is fit for the passage of light cars but lorries have difficulty owing to some short but steep descents about Mile 24. The first 8 miles are across undulating country, and the main physical feature is the crossing of the Gilazerda Range, from Miles 9 to 15. The country from Mile 15 onwards is through hills broken by innumerable wadis. The Tanjero River bed (Mile 6) is crossed by a series of embankments and bridges of a strength and solidity quite unwarranted by the condition of the route beyond this point. From the Tanjero onwards the route is an earthy track, which beyond Mile 16 is sometimes scarcely distinguishable. The route from Mile 16 onward may be impassable for M.T. up to 12 days after rain. 2. Water There are two springs in the vicinity of Mile 3, sufficient for the needs of 2 companies. The Tanjero River (Mile 6) has unlimited water except in late summer and autumn when it may only suffice the needs of about 1 brigade. During this period it passes through rice fields so is not safe without purifica tion. There are small springs in villages along the route, which normally only suffice for 1 company. Qaradagh has only limited spring-water. 3. Supplies Negligible. About 500 sheep and goats could be collected at Qaradagh at three days’ notice, and after the crops are reaped (about June) limited quantities of wheat and barley could be collected at seven days’ notice. 4. Fuel Brushwood in the Gilazerda Range. Unlimited mountain oak could be collected in Qaradagh from the mountain range 4 miles to the south. Trees at Mile 8£ are a shrine and should not be cut. 5. Transport About 50 pack animals could be collected in Qaradagh at four days' notice, and possibly three to five mules or pack horses are available in each village along the route.Route Report No. 24a 113 6. Grazing There is grazing sufficient for the needs of one brigade all along the route between March and June. There is grazing in the Gilazerda Range up to August, and in the Qaradagh Valley it is plentiful during this period. 7. Obstacles The route is usually impassable by M.T. owing to mud during the wet season. A temporary artificial obstacle could be made by the destruction of the Tanjero bridges on the south side' of the wadi. Up to mid-summer destruction of the Tanjero Bridges would close the route to M.T. Destruction of the road from Mile 12 to 14 would block the route. 8. Additional Work Steep descents of 200-300 yards round about Mile 24 could be cleared of loose gravel, or alternatively graded by slight detours. Metalling of several miles of soft patches between Miles 14 and 25 would improve the route for use during the rainy season. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds Marked landing ground at Sulaimaniya. Unlimited camping ground to Mile 8. Ground for two battalions at Mile 14 ; also camping ground at Mile 20. 10. Communications No M.T. routes after leaving Sulaimaniya. Police helio at Gilazerda police post (Mile 14) communicates with Sulai maniya. No communication of any sort at Qaradagh. 11. Climate Normal for lowland mountain country. Hot and malarial in summer. 'Snow is unlikely in winter except on the Gilazerda Range, and it rarely lies more than two days. 12. Tactical The Gilazerda Range commands the whole route except dead ground particularly beyond Mile 22. 13. Rains and Floods Rainfall normal for mountain country. Route is not liable to flooding. x 14. Inhabitants Inhabitants are settled non-tribal villagers. They are poor, extensively disarmed, and unlikely to cause trouble. 1 15. Alternative Routes Alternative route out of Sulaimaniya exists, joining described route at Mile 2. This route is narrow and leads through bazaar, but may be necessary in wet weather as it is rough-metalled, while described route up to Mile 2 is an earth track.113a Route Report No. 24a Stages No. of Stage.

Stages : —3. Authority :—Air Staff Intelligence, ’Iraq. Date : —5th April, 1940. Map References : —£-in. 2 E/SE ; 2 E/NE. 1. General The route is passable by all arms including heavy M.T. and is metalled in all places where the surface is liable to be soft except some stretches of up to 50 yards each after Mile 32. It is tarred between Miles 16| and 22. The route is fit for one continuous stream of traffic with space to pass throughout. The first stage is across the Surajo Plain, and the remainder winds through high mountain country until the Penjwin Plain is reached. There are two stretches of hairpin bends—a series of 12 hairpins and several lesser curves leading to Kani Spika (Mile 18£) and 12 hairpins to the top of Kani Manga Pass (Mile 31) followed by 8 hairpins down to the Penjwin Plain. 2. Water Water is plentiful throughout the route from springs and streams, except at Shah Nadri, where it may be scarce during the late summer and autumn. 3. Supplies Normally negligible from villages along the route, but in the summer when the nomadic Jaf tribe is in the area large numbers of sheep and goats could be collected at one week’s notice. 4. Fuel There are only occasional trees up to Mile 15, but from there onwards there is a plentiful supply of mountain oak on the hillsides. 5. Transport Nil. 6. Grazing There is good grazing in Stage 1 from April to July, and in the hills in Stages 2 and 3 there is fair grazing during the summer ; the Penjwin Plain has good grazing during summer and autumn. e 4 (C42381)Route Report No. 25 115 7. Obstacles The only natural obstacle is snow in winter which is liable to block the route to M.T. from Mile 15 onwards up to 10 days at a time. The Pen]win Plain may be under snow up to three weeks at a time. The ford at Mile 23 may be impassable by M.T. for a few hours in spate. Artificial obstacles could be created by the destruction of bridges at Miles 3,, 13 and 23, and by destruction of the road itself at many points where it is cut into the hillside and held up by stones underneath. 8. Additional Work The road is badly cut about after heavy rains and snow and needs minor repairs annually in the spring. From Mile 32 onwards the road requires proper metalling as the large sharp stones with which soft stretches are metalled are hard-wearing on tyres. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds There is unlimited camping ground in Stage 1 and at the end of Stage 3. Space for one to two battalions may be found in ploughed fields at Mile 22 and in Mile 28 R.I.A.F. emergency landing ground at Penjwin. 10. Communications Telephone and telegraph line between Penjwin and Halabja and Sulai- maniya. Police heliograph at Shah Nadri connecting with Halabja. M.T. route from Basbmagh (5 miles east of Penjwin) connects with Iranian motor roads. Only three small bridges are required to join with this route. 11. Climate Hot and malarial in summer in Stage 1, but temperate in Stages 2 and 3. Extreme cold in winter in Stages 2 and 3. 12. Tactical For the first few miles the route is commanded by hills on the left, and afterwards is open plain until Mile 8, where the hills close in. The rest of the route is through a tangle of mountains which command the route on all sides. The Nalparaiz Pass (Mile 21) and the Kanimanga Pass (Mile 31) are the two commanding features of the route. 13. Rains and Floods The route is not liable to flooding. Precipitation normal for mountain districts. 14. Inhabitants Settled agriculturists live in the villages and are normally peaceful. The nomadic Jaf tribe pass through the area in the summer and autumn, and are renowned for petty theft. The proximity of the Iranian border provides a good escape for small gangs of bandits holding up cars between Mile 21 and 30. 15.

Stages : —3. Authority :—Air Staff Intelligence, ’Iraq. Date : —17th October, 1934. Map References in. : 1 D/SW, 1 D/SE. . General The road is passable in dry season, i.e. between mid-April and mid- November for light cars only. In view of the numerous ascents and descents at the end of Stage 1 which are unmetalled and liable to be washed away by heavy rains and floods and the narrow hairpin bends in the vicinity of Degala, the road is considered impassable for heavy lorries and armoured cars, and extensive repairs are required in this sector to make it passable for heavy vehicles. After heavy rain the whole route becomes impassable and even unloaded light cars have great difficulties in negotiating sections of the road. The road is unmetalled and not graded and culverts and Irish bridges are required in all stages of the route. The road on leaving Erbil traverses easy undulating country for the first 4 miles and then a gradual and continuous ascent to the foothills of the Sinka Dage follows. The country now becomes very broken and steep ascents and descents are negotiated, until the road drops down gradually to the Ash Kaft Saqqa plain. Up to this point, the surface of the road is fair but from now onwards to Koi Sanjaq the surface is composed of red clay with a gravel surface in places and it would be rendered impassable after heavy rain. Between Ash Kaft Saqqa plain and Degala, three severe gradients are encountered. After leaving Degala stream, there is a very steep zigzag ascent. The country again becomes broken and after winding over innumerable spurs and wadis, the road enters Koi Sanjaq. 2. Water During the winter months, water is reported as being abundant all along the route. In summer, there is a fair quantity of water at Kaznazan (decreases in September and October) and unlimited water at Degala, Tob Waza and Koi Sanjaq. There are also springs suitable dor a battalion as Ash Kaft Saqqa and sufficient for a company at Mile 11 (a second spring is in the vicinity—1 D/SW.Sq.21b. 1.2), Aryan, Targina and Mile 2.1 (third stage) ; at all these points such water as there is lies on the surface and no special gear is necessary. In all cases where the water has been limited in this report to the strength of a battalion or company, a trough for animals should be carried. 3. Supplies Supplies vary with the seasons, commodities being most plentiful in September and scarcest in May, while livestock is more plentiful from October till May and less so from June till September, on account of their being awayRoute Report No. 26 118 from the villages at grass. Koi Sanjaq as follows :— Barley Wheat Tibn Sheep and goats Cattle Supplies are available within 5 miles radius of September. 100 tons. 100 tons. 300 tons. 10,000 300 May. 40 tons. 40 tons. 100 tons. 12,000 400 Supplies are also available at Ash Kaft Saqqa and Degala (Stage 2) which are each capable of supplying a sixth of the amount of Koi Sanjaq. Small quantities of wheat, barley and sheep could be collected from villages in vicinity of Stage 1 but by previous arrangement, large supplies could be collected at this stage from Erbil. 4. Fuel Fuel along the whole route is scarce,- and what there is is of poor quality, though it would be very easy to arrange for good fuel, as there is heavy scrub all along the Karrader Dagh and the Hab es Sultan Dagh and wood fuel in large quantities from the western slopes of the Sefin Dagh, which could be brought to the road if a few hours’ notice were given. 1 here is always a limited supply of fuel available in the villages which the inhabitants have brought down from the hills for their own use. 5. Transport Motor Transport .—Arrangements for M.T. must be made through Erbil town. Pack Transport .—In Koi Sanjaq there are usually about 75-100 mules and donkeys immediately available, and with two days’ notice a further 100 could be collected. Often 50-80 camels are available in Koi Sanjaq, employed on caravans between Erbil and Koi Sanjaq. 6 . Grazing In the spring the grazing is good throughout. In the summer as follows :— From Erbil to Kaznazan—Poor. From Kaznazan to Ash Kaft Saqqa—Low scrub, poor. From Ash Kaft Saqqa to Koi Sanjaq—Fair, dry grass and low scrub. 7. Obstacles Stream at Degala, which is reported to be 4 ft. deep in the flood season. The ascents and descents at the end of Stage 1 which are unmetalled and liable to be washed away by heavy rains and floods, the gradients at Mile 2-2, 3-8 and 14-7 (Stage 2) and the descent and ascent in the Degala area provide a formidable obstacle for all M.T. vehicles in the wet season. Road from Mile 7-3 (Stage 2) to Mile 15-4 (Stage 2) would be extremely difficult to negotiate in the wet season. 8. Additional Work Requires metalling. The whole route requires culverts and Irish bridges. Extensive improvements throughout the route are required to make it passable for anything but light cars in wet or dry weather—even light cars have great difficulties in negotiating sections of the road. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds The only place where camping grounds are difficult to find is between Mile 7-5 and Ash Kaft Saqqa. At all other points along the route there would be little difficulty in finding a suitable place for at least a battalion. A landing ground exists at Erbil.119 Route Report No. 26 10. Communications The telegraph and telephone line runs alongside the road in the greater part of the final stage of this route only. Koi Sanjaq is connected to Erbil by telegraph and telephone. Tracks. —Degala-Gomaspan Police Post (passable for light cars). 11. Climate Normal for northern ’Iraq. Rainfall between November and April. January and February are usually the months of heaviest rainfall. Period of floods : February to April. 12. Tactical The stretch of the route which presents the greatest tactical difficulty is that which passes through Sinka Dagh, where the road climbs among some hills of about 300 ft. high. From Mile 7-3 (Stage 3) onwards the road is not generally overlooked except from the Karrader Dagh, and the country is such that flank guards could usually operate. The ridge at Mile 7-3 is a key position for the covering of a retirement to the west. 13. Rains and Floods Heavy rain would seriously affect the condition of the road. The road is also seriously affected by floods. 14. Inhabitants Friendly. Between Erbil and Sinka Dagh the area is non-tribal. From Sinka Dagh to Koi Sanjaq, Girdi tribes. Muhammad Agha, chief of the Koi section of the Girdi lives at Ash Kaft Saqqa. 15. Alternative Routes. Nil. Stages Special Note .—The route has been divided into three stages, but as will be seen, this division is only suitable for a force of not more than one com pany. Any larger force, moving in one body and dependent on the available water supply would have to divide the march into four stages, halting at Kaznazan, Ash Kaft Saqqa and Degala, where the water available is sufficient to maintain them.

After leaving Stage 1 camp site the country becomes very broken and the road, which maintains a fair surface, winds round small hills and climbs to the summit (1 D/SW.21b.62). Three steep descents then follow after which the road follows the course of a broad, flat wadi for about a mile, climbs to the summit, and after winding among the hills for another mile, it again climbs to the summit (1 D/SW.22a.27). From this point the whole water course of the Shalgha River comes into view, and the road after having made its way along the water-shed dividing the Shalgha and the Bastura Chai drops down gradually along a spur on to the undulating Ash Kaft Saqqa Plain which runs parallel to the Karrader Dagh. The general direction then becomes south-east, and the surface of the road, though good in the dry weather, is, from now onwards, of red clay with a gravel surface in places—it would be rendered impassable during heavy rains. After having struck off in a south-easterly direction, the road passes through Ash Kaft Saqqa, Aryan, iargina to Degala, severe gradients being encountered at Targina, Mile 15 - 0 and Degala. Road reaches summit and descends steeply. Road enters broad flat wadi after descending two very short but very steep hills. Gradients 1/5 and 1/6. Steep ascent and then steady climb to summit.

Map Reference : —£-in. Sheets, 2A/SW,'2A/NW, 2A/NE, 1D/SE. 1. General At the time of this report the road was newly built, and was intended to become the main permanent access to Koi Sanjaq. At present there are many sections which might be affected by rain, but which would be permanently fit for all traffic if they were properly surfaced. It is reported that landslips blocked the road in the early part of 1939 in some newly made sections. 2. Water Water is available from the irrigation system between Miles 8 and 15,. at Redar and for about 3 miles after it, and at Chai Shiwasor (Mile 28). Unlimited water is available from the Lesser Zab River at Taqtaq. Water is available from the Rubaj-i-Koi at Mile 45 and the Chai Man Qilinj at Mile 49. . 3. Supplies From Koi Sanjaq, and Taqtaq in the Erbil Liwa, Redar and Kirluik in the Kirkuk Liwa. 4. Fuel As para. 3 above. 5. Transport As para. 3 above. 6. Grazing Not known. 7. Obstacles Any interference with the ferry at Taqtaq or the bridge at Mile 45-3 would close those sections of the road to all traffic ; otherwise, if the wadis were dry, the destruction of bridges would cause a temporary obstacle only. Landslips have occurred on some of the newest built sections in the mountains. 8. Additional Work Metalling is required in nearly all parts of the route. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds Miles 8-20 and Redar ; camping grounds available everywhere ; landing grounds could be prepared. Miles 36-38 and Taqtaq ; space is available for camping grounds ; landing grounds could be prepared.Route Report No. 26a 121c 10. Communications Nil, except the road itself and the Lesser Zab. 11. Climate Normal for northern ’Iraq. 12. Tactical Hills command the road almost continuously from Mile 20 to Mile 49 ; the crossings of the Lesser Zab at Taqtaq, the Chai Shiwasor at Mile 29, and the Rubar-i-Koi at Mile 45-3 are vulnerable. 13. Rains and Floods Miles 8 to 20 and 36 to 38 would be impassable for several days after heavy rain. Much of the remainder of the route would be unfit for use during and soon after rain, but in general it is well drained and would dry quickly. A spate of the Lesser Zab might interfere with the working of the ferry at Taqtaq. 14. Inhabitants. Erbil Liwa : Kurds. Kirkuk Liwa : Kurds and Turcomans. 15.

Authority :—Air Staff Intelligence, ’Iraq. Date: —July, 1938, and November, 1939. P P Map References: —£-in. ’Iraq Surveys 137 —’ 137 — 5 1D/SW. SW SE 1. General This is a first-class motor road suitable for all arms at all seasons of the year. It is now the main route from Mosul to Kirkuk. The first stage is across a plain, while the remaining stages are hilly and undulating, with numerous winter water courses crossed by culverts and small bridges.' The Khazir and Greater Zab Rivers are crossed on Stage 2 by double track steel bridges. 2. Water Plentiful in Stage 2 from the Zab and Khazir rivers and at Stage 4 at Erbxl town. In Stage 1 there is limited supply from wells in villages near the route and in Bartalla village at the end of the stage. In Stage 3 and the earlier part of Stage 4 water is non-existent save for two small wells in Gharok Gora village. Water could probably be obtained by sinking new wells in advance. 3. Supplies Providing the population was friendly, considerable supplies of grain, cattle and sheep would be immediately available on Stage 1, and at short notice (12 hours) very large supplies of each could be collected, particularly grain from the villages of Keramlais and Qaraqosh. On Stage 2 immediately available supplies are less but in the summer months might be supplemented by the sheep of nomads camping on the route. Stages 3 and 4 are practically destitute of supplies for anything more than a company. As far as the Zab River a brigade could be maintained with ease. 4. Fuel In Bartalla, the end of Stage 1, specially prepared dung cakes are available, and at Stage 2 there are scrub and trees growing along the banks of the Zab. Otherwise the route is devoid of fuel. A small quantity of kerosene is available from the R.O.C. agent at Eski Kelek. 5. Transport (i) Water. —Nil. (ii) Animals .—Donkeys and mules are available from villages near the route at short notice, probably about 250 could be collected. A few camels might be had from nomads camping in the summer on Stage 2. However, the main reliance would be on those available in Mosul in large numbers at short notice (for details see report on Mosul, page 176).Route Report No. 29 I2lg (iii) Vehicular. —In 1937, 355 cars and 171 lorries were registered on the Mosul Liwa. The majority of these would be available in Mosul town itself. No vehicles would be found en route. 6. Grazing Good grazing is available for horses, sheep and cattle on Stages 3 and 4 and to a large extent on Stage 2. There is little grazing on Stage 1 as the land is under plough. However, supplies of barley and bhoosa are available on this stage. • 7. Obstacles Bridges. —The destruction of the steel bridges over the Khazir and Zab rivers would close the route. These are of the “ Hopkins ” type, steel girder and tubular steel pillars. There are one or two small stone bridges whose destruction would be inconvenient. (Details on the stages.) On Stages 3 and 4 there are numerous culverts whose destruction would hardly be worth while. The approach to the Zab could be made difficult by destruction of the embankment of the road, and by loose earth brought down by blasting in the cuttings. • 8. Additional Work Nil. 9. Camping Grounds and Landing Grounds On Stage 1, except for interference from standing crops, camping and landing grounds are available almost everywhere. Stages 2 and 3 are not suitable for landing grounds but camping sites are plentiful on the ridges of the hills. At Stage 4 there is a recognised landing ground a mile to the west of Erbil and good camping site. 10. Communications • (а) Rail. —Nil. Mosul itself is now connected by rail with both Baghdad and Tall Kotchek (for Turkey). (б) Telegraph and Telephone. —Lines run along the route from Mosul to Erbil. (e) River. —Nil. The Tigris is navigable as far as Mosul in winter, for small craft only. (d) Roads. —Tracks, fit for cars in summer, run to all the neighbouring villages on Stage 1, and from Eski Kelek to Quwair. 11. Tactical (a) Stage 1 is flat and featureless plain save for the natural defensive position afforded by the ruined walls of Nineveh a short distance outside Mosul. (b) Stage 2 is flanked on the north at a distance of 1-2 miles by Jebel Ain As Safran. The country is slightly undulating and would afford good rearguard positions and flank guards would be necessary. The valley of the Greater Zab and to a less degree the Khazir are major tactical features which would be difficult to force if held by the enemy in strength. (c) Stages 3 and 4 are very hilly and undulating and are ideal for rear guard actions. Armoured cars could operate along the crests of the ridges but would have difficulty in crossing the small but deep water channels. The country is completely devoid of cover, being rather an exaggerated downland, and aerial co-operation would be easy and valuable. The upper slopes of the Demir Dagh would have to be held to prevent a flank attack, and they might be taken in rear by armoured cars proceeding from Eski Kelek via Kaor and Abbasiya.121/* Route Report No. 29 12. Climate Normal for northern ’Iraq. 13. Rains and Floods These would have no effect on the road. 14.

(16) Page 122, para. 1, General. Insert at beginning of this paragraph This is no longer the main road between Erbil and Mosul, having been replaced as such by Route 29. In consequence, little or no maintenance is done on it, and the ferry at Mile 36-5 is only used occasionally. The estimate of the capacity of this ferry given on page 125 should accordingly be treated with reserve. see Stage 4.) The route runs through undulating cultivated country, and under normal conditions is passable for all arms. Within 48 hours after heavy rain, however, the surface of the road becomes badly cut up by wheeled traffic and may be impassable for heavy M.T. for 2 or 3 days. The flood period in the Greater Zab is from April to June. There is unlimited water between Erbil and Quwair ; between Quwair and Mosul difficulty might be experienced in obtaining water during the summer months. There is, however, an alternative route which follows the left bank of the Tigris in this stage, and is passable for pack transport. 3. Supplies Mosul and Erbil form the main centres for the collection of produce from their respective districts. The country intervening is cultivated and a number of prosperous villages are situated close to the route. It is doubtful if any supplies could be obtained between Quwair and Mosul. Wood fuel is obtainable at Erbil, Quwair and Mosul. The time for collection of amounts up to 50 tons varies from 2 to 5 days. 5. Transport The following mechanical transport was registered in January, 1936, in the Liwas of Mosul and Erbil:— About 250 camels could be collected at Quwair on about 3 days’ notice. Downstream traffic from Quwair is by Kellek ; skins and material for the manufacture of these rafts are always available. 2. Water 4. Fuel Mosul . . 383 cars, 96 lorries.

Map Reference :—£ in., Sheets 1 D/SW, 137 P/SE, 137 P/SW. 1 General The route from Erbil to Mosul follows the course of the Chai Shiwasor in a westerly direction to the ferry crossing the Greater Zab at Quwair. From Quwair it turns north-west and gradually converges on the River Tigris which it crosses by a steel trestle bridge at Mosul. (For details of bridge, see Stage 4.) The route runs through undulating cultivated country, and under normal conditions is passable for all arms. Within 48 hours after heavy rain, however, the surface of the road becomes badly cut up by wheeled traffic and may be impassable for heavy M.T. for 2 or 3 days. The flood period in the Greater Zab is from April to June. 2. Water There is unlimited water between Erbil and Quwair ; between Quwair and Mosul difficulty might be experienced in obtaining water during the summer months. There is, however, an alternative route which follows the left bank of the Tigris in this stage, and is passable for pack transport. 3.

About 250 camels could be collected at Quwair on about 3 days' notice. Downstream traffic from Quwair is by Kellek ; skins and material for the manufacture of these rafts are always available.123 Route Report No. 32 6. Grazing The grazing throughout is poor and scattered. Much of the land is cultivated and remainder contains sparse grazing between the mon is o January and May only. 7. Obstacles In Stage 2 the Chai Shiwasor is crossed by an iron girder bridge. The water channel is some 30 ft. across and flows through a depression 15 . the approaches to which would need considerable ramping before an a terna ive crossing could be constructed. , ,, The ferry crossing at Quwair presents no serious obstacle, except when tnc river is in flood, and the cable to which the ferry boat is normally attached is either broken, submerged or of insufficient length to span the swollen water channel. 8. Additional work Nil. The route is in constant use by M.T. and improvements are carried out from time to time. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds Camping grounds could be sited anywhere along the route. Recognised landing grounds exist at Erbil and Mosul. 10. Communications Rail. —Nil. River .—The Greater Zab is stated to be navigable by light draught craft as far north as Kelek (137 P/SE.14d.4.4). Telegraph .—Telegraph and telephone lines follow the route. 11. Climate Normal for Central ’Iraq. 12. Tactical The crossing of the Greater Zab at Quwair would be difficult in the face of opposition. There are a number of positions along the right bank from which fire could be directed on to the ferry. The river is not fordable. 13. Rains and Floods Heavy rain may fall between November and May. The Greater Zab and the Tigris are subject to periods of high flood when the snow melts in the hills ; difficulty may be experienced in crossing the former river as late as mid-June. 14. Inhabitants The majority of the villages between Erbil and Quwair are to a great extent non-tribal, though under the influence of the Dizai Kurds north of the Greater Zab. The majority of the villages adjacent to the Tigris are inhabited by Turcoman Arabs. 15. Alternative Routes There is a pack route from Quwair to Mosul which follows the left bank of the River Tigris.Route Report No. 32 124 Distance. Inter. Total. Remarks. 16 16 General direction. West. Miles. Throughout this stage the route follows the course of the Chai Shiwasor. The country traversed is rich agricultural land, slightly undulating and devoid of any marked characteristics. For the first 6 miles out of Erbil the road is metalled ; after that the track is unmetalled and is difficult for M.T. after heavy rain.

The final stage to Mosul is passable for all arms and presents no physical characteristics calling for special comment. The country traversed is undulating, the cultivated areas increasing as Mosul is approached. Approaching Mosul the road passes to the west of the village of Nabi Yunis and follows the ancient mounds of Nineveh to the Wadi Khosar, at which point the road turns south-east and, crossing the Tigris by a steel trestle bridge, enters Mosul Town. Mosul. —The third largest city of ’Iraq, with a population of about 90,000. It is situated on the right bank of the Tigris and is con nected with the left bank by a bridge of 8 spans Hopkins steel trestles on cylindrical stone piers which was constructed in 1934. The bridge is 984 ft. long and has an 18 ft. roadway with two 5 ft. paths. An approach embankment on the right bank is 345 ft. long. The bridge has a capacity of a double line of traffic up to 80 tons total per span. A pontoon bridge, predecessor of the permanent structure, is situated £ mile upstream of the new bridge. It is cut during the flood season. Mosul contains a considerable garrison of the 'Iraq Army. The surrounding country is gently undulating, with mountainous country about 25 miles to the north. Water .—Unlimited from the Tigris. Supplies. —The following supplies could be made immediately available for one division : Wheat, barley, bhoosa, sheep and cattle. For an additional division 7 days’ notice would be required by the market contractors. Supplies of vegetables and fruit are available in smaller quantities. Fuel. —About 5 tons of wood is procurable daily. Up to 50 tons daily could be obtained from Zakho and the hill districts to the north. Transport .—The following estimates are given for animal, vehicular and river transport in the Mosul district :— Donkeys and mules .. 800 Camels .. . . . . 5-600 Carts, various . . . . 100 Safinas (river craft) (3-ton 50 capacity).

General This route avoids the detour to Nasiriya. It is fit for M.T. and A.F.V.s in dry weather, but there are sections of subkha which are unavoidable, and these render it unserviceable for several days after heavy rain. It is subject to occasional floods. The route follows the railway throughout its whole distance. Between Ur and Bat-ha the track crosses numerous small irrigation ditches by means of culverts. The destruction of these would not create a serious obstacle as they could be crossed by driving on to the railway embankment.

Authority :—Air Staff (Intelligence), ’Iraq. Date : —December, 1932. Map Reference : —|-in. Survey, Sheets 137 P/SW, 137 P/SE, 137 P/NE. 1. General The road is passable in dry seasons for all vehicles, including heavy M.T., but in the wet seasons, after heavy and continuous rain, for pack only. The section of the road most affected by rain is that which crosses the Jujar Plain between Shewari village (137 P/NE.3Id) and the old Levy camp at ’Aqra. The Jujar Plain is mainly cotton soil. The road is metalled only over a few short stretches and very little maintenance repair work has been carried out. The Khazir Su is crossed at Mindan by a Hopkins two-span bridge, which is passable for all arms. In the dry season the river can be forded by lorries and light cars near the bridge site. The other bridges along the route are mainly of stone, with two small iron bridges. They can carry heavy M.T. traffic. There are a few culverts, also fit for heavy M.T. vehicles. The road on leaving Mosul traverses easy undulating country until the foothills of the Jabal Maqlub and Jabal Bardarash are reached. There are several steep gradients on these hills, most of which are metalled. From the Jabal Bardarash the road descends into the Jujar Plain, which is flat and low lying and extends as far as the ’Aqra foothills. 2. Water All the water estimates were made when the rivers were at their lowest. Water at Bir Hallan (Stage 1) is limited. At Mindan (Stage 2) and Jujar Kabir (Stage 3) ample water is available from rivers and streams. At ’Aqra there is an ample water supply from perennial springs, sufficient for a force of about 1,500 men and 500 animals during the summer months. 3. Supplies Wheat, barley, rice, sheep and cattle are available at all the stages in limited quantities. Sufficient grain, bhoosa and meat for one battalion with transport, for 1 day, would be obtainable at each stage without previous arrangement at any time. At short notice (2-3 days) grain, bhoosa and meat would be obtainable at each stage in sufficient quantities to maintain a force of about 1,500 men and transport animals for 3 to 4 days at any season of the year.129 Route Report No. 34 A mixed force of about 1,500 men with transport animals could be main tained at ’Aqra for several months. At the other stages a force of this size could be maintained for 14 days if previous arrangements for supplies were made. Table of annual production from the ’Aqra Qadha for the years 1929-30 is shown in the detailed report on Stage 4. 4. Fuel Fuel of any kind is scarce at the intermediate stages along the route. There are ample supplies of firewood, oil and charcoal in Mosul to maintain a large force marching from Mosul to ’Aqra. There is an unlimited supply of firewood at ’Aqra. At Mindan sufficient fuel to maintain a battalion for a short period is obtainable in the vicinity of the bridge. There is no fuel available at other stages. 5. Transport Pack animals can be obtained from villages along the route in numbers varying from 10 to 30, according to the size of the village. At short notice approximately 100 pack animals could be collected at any point en route while 1,000 could probably be obtained in Mosul. In the Mosul Liwa there were 383 cars and 96 lorries registered on 1st January, 1936. When the Herki tribe are grazing in the Jujar Plain (November to May) about 500 pack animals could be obtained from them. 6 . Grazing Between Mosul and the foothills of the Jabal Maqlub there is scant grazing at any season of the year as this area is mainly under cultivation. In the foothills of Jabal Maqlub and Jabal Ba’shiqa there is grazing for several hundred pack animals in the spring and early summer. In the Jujar Plain, between Jujar Kabir and ’Aqra, excellent grazing exists in spring and early summer. Approximately 2,000 pack animals could be grazed over this area for a long period. 7. Obstacles There are no serious obstacles along the route. The destruction of the Mindan bridge would delay the crossing of the Khazir except in the dry weather season. In the flood season the best substitute would be a cable ferry. Repairs to the iron bridge would require to be carried out by engineers with materials brought from Mosul. Destruction of the bridge would be difficult for an enemy not provided with explosives. The smaller bridges, if destroyed, could probably be repaired temporarily by troops in a few hours. Stone is available in the foothills, but all other material, such as timber, would require to be brought from Mosul. 8. Additional work After heavy M.T. traffic it is probable that portions of the road would require repairs. These could be carried out by troops with local material. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds Bir Hallan .—Sufficient camping ground for one infantry brigade. Mindan .—Camping ground is situated near the north-east end of the bridge and on the left bank of the river. Sufficient for one infantry brigade. Jujar Kabir .—Map reference of the camping ground is 137 P/NE. 7d.3.9. Accommodation available for one infantry brigade. 'Aqra .—Camp site is situated about 1 mile north of the landing ground. Accommodation available for 1 infantry brigade. (C23303) FRoute Report No. 34 130 Landing Grounds .—Landing ground with conventional R.A.F. markings at Mosul (137 P/SW.14b.5.6). Emergency landing ground at ’Aqra (137 P/NE.23b.5.8). This landing ground is unfit for use during the winter months. During the dry season aircraft can land anywhere in the vicinity of Jujar. 10. Communications Telegraph and Telephone line, Mosul-’Aqra. The only roads passable for wheeled traffic communicating with the main Mosul-’Aqra road are the following :— Mosul-’Ain Sifni, Mosul-Ba’shiqa, Jujar Kabir-Khalilkan, Jujar Kabir-Shush, ’Aqra-Kalati, 'Aqra-Shush. All these roads are passable for light cars in dry weather. 11. Climate The climate is that normal to Northern Kurdistan, viz., very hot in summer and cold in winter. There is practically no shade for troops or animals along the route during the summer months. 12. Tactical The Jabal Maqlub and Jabal Bardarash foothills on both banks of the Khazir Su provide positions from which an enemy could oppose the advance of a force from Mosul. It would be necessary to picquet the road in the neighbourhood of the Jabals Maqlub and Bardarash if the enemy were near this locality. Rearguard positions for a force retiring along the route are— (a) Locality in the vicinity of Girdisin police post; (b) High ground between Bardarash and Shewari; (c) High ground on the south bank of Khazir ; {d) Foothills of the Jabal Maqlub between Mindan and Bir Hallan. 13. Rains and Floods Rain falls between November and April. January and February are usually the months of heaviest rainfall, and snow sometimes lies for several days in the neighbourhood of ’Aqra during these months. Heavy rains seriously affect the condition of the road, especially in the Jujar Plain, which is impassable for wheeled traffic for 2 to 3 days after a heavy fall. Rivers begin to rise in November and subside in June. In the event of floods, which are of rare occurrence, there are no alternative routes round the area. 14. Inhabitants The area between Mosul and Mindan is inhabited by a mixed population of Arabs, Shebeks, Turcomans, Yezidis, and Kurds. They are peaceable, industrious people, who have caused no trouble in the past and are not likely to join in any disturbances. They are not well armed.131 Route Report No. 34 The area between Mindan and ’Aqra is inhabited by the following Kurdish tribes :— Ashair Saba .—A friendly and well-behaved tribe unlikely to create trouble. Possess about 400 rifles. Surchi .—A troublesome tribe who must be regarded as potentially hostile. Possess about 400 rifles. Herki. —Nomadic, usually to be found in the Jujar Plain between November and May. Friendly to Government and not likely to join in any disturbances. Possess about 700 rifles. There are several Assyrian villages in this area, the inhabitants of which are friendly and peaceable. They are well armed. 15. Alternative Routes An alternative crossing over the Khazir exists near Qatis (137 P/SE.lc) where the river is reported to be fordable throughout the flood seasons. A well-defined track that leaves the main Mosul-’Aqra road between Tiz Kharab and Bir Hallan, where the road crosses a stone culvert near a shrine on the south side, leads to Qatis. From Qatis the track runs to Bardarash and thence to the main Mosul-’Aqra road in the Jujar Plain. This route is passable for pack animals only. No other alternative routes exist, but it would be possible to make detours around short sections of the road across the plains in dry weather. Stages No. of Distance. Stage. Name. Inter. Total.

For the first 24 miles the route traverses undulating partly cultivated country. From Mile 24 to Mile 27-5 the road is commanded on both sides by the low hills of Jabal Kand. For the last 3 miles the road runs across the Alqosh Plain. 2. Water From May to December water is scarce along the whole route. Tall-Kaif (137 P/SW. 2a and b).—There are several wells in this village but water becomes very scarce during the summer months, when the inhabitants obtain their -water from two springs at Tilimtha (137 P/SW. 2b), 2£ miles away. There is sufficient water at these springs for one infantry battalion and its transport. The water is slightly sulphurous but drinkable. Batnai (137 P/NW\ 32d).—Three wells in the village—sufficient for the needs of the inhabitants only. Nearest water supply, Tilimtha. Sharafiya (137 P/NW. 20c).—Good water from the Wadi al Malah and from two springs sufficient for two infantry battalions and transport. Alqosh. —Sufficient water for one infantry company from two large wells in the village. There is, hov/ever, a danger of pollution. In addition, there are 19 smaller wells and a spring of good water which should supply the needs of three infantry companies. Water is also obtainable at the Monastery of Marth Maryam, 1£ miles east of Alqosh, from two wells which should suffice for one infantry company. 3. Supplies Supplies are available as follows :— Tall Kaif : 1,500 sheep, 300 cattle. Batnai : 2,500-3,000 sheep. Tall Usquf : 1,500 sheep, 150 cattle. Alqosh : 3,000 sheep, 250 cattle.137 Route Report No. 42 From November to the end of April the Ashuti (Assyrian) tribe is encamped in the Alqosh area. They normally have 10,000-12,000 sheep. Considerable quantities of wheat, barley and bhoosa could be obtained from the villages along the route at 48 hours’ notice. No vegetables are obtainable but melons and grapes are available at Alqosh from June to September. 4. Fuel Ample supplies of mountain oak, which is brought down by Assyrian tribesmen. 5. Transport At 1 week’s notice approximately 600 pack mules and ponies could be collected at Tall Kaif and 500 pack mules and ponies at Alqosh. In January, 1936, 383 cars and 96 lorries were registered in the Mosul Liwa. A proportion of these should be available for use on this route. 6. Grazing Good grazing between March and May in the plain below Alqosh. Fair grazing in the Batnai area between March and May. There is no grazing during the rest of the year. 7. Obstacles Serious obstacles to M.T. would be occasioned by the destruction of the stone bridges at Mile F3 and Mile 24. A crossing could be improvised east of the latter bridge. 8. Additional work Improvements are being carried out by P.W.D. as funds permit. The culvert at Mile 25 • 9 requires reconditioning. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds Batnai. —Unlimited camping space. Water scarce. A dry weather landing ground could be cleared east of the village. Alqosh. —A camping site for a brigade is available in the vicinity of the Monastery of Marth Maryam. Space for a landing ground exists south of Marth Maryam ; the surface is hard but would require clearing. 10. Communications Rail. —Nil. River. —Nil. Telegraph and Telephone. —Nil. Roads :— Tall Kaif-Dohuk. Alqosh-’Ain Sifni. These roads are passable for light cars in dry weather only. 11. Climate Normal for Northern ’Iraq. Heavy rains are to be expected between December and May. Floods from January to March inclusive. 12. Tactical Picqueting may be necessary for about 4 miles through the Jabal Kand. Concealment from aircraft would be difficult. The country is suitable for the operation of armoured cars.Route Report No. 42 138 13.

The Monastery of Rabban Hormez is situated on a hill east of the village and the Monastery of Marth Maryam on the foothills of the Alqosh Plain. Water. — (a) From Wadi al Malah and two springs near Sharafiya village ; sufficient for two battalions with transport. ( 6 ) There are two wells in Alqosh village but there is danger of pollution. Sufficient good water for three infantry companies can be obtained from 19 wells in the vicinity of Alqosh, and sufficient for one infantry company from two wells at the Monastery of Marth Maryam. Supplies.— Wheat, barley and bhoosa is obtainable in large quan tities at 48 hours’ notice. There are 3,000-3,500 sheep in the Alqosh Nahiya. Fuel. —Ample supplies of mountain oak brought from the hills by Assyrian tribesmen. Camping and Landing Grounds .—Suggested camp site at 137 P/NW.. 20c, north of Sharafiya village ; space unlimited. The Monastery of Marth Maryam could billet two platoons of infantry. Space for a landing ground exists south of the Monastery of Marth Maryam, but the surface would have to be cleared of stones.140 ROUTE REPORT No. 44 MOSUL to ZAKHO via ALOKA and SIMEL Total Distance :—74 miles. Stages : —5. Authority :—Air Staff (Intelligence), ’Iraq. Date : —August, 1932. Map Reference : —|-in. ’Iraq, Sheets 137 P/SW, 137 P/NW, 137 L/NE, 137 K/SW and SE. 1. General The road is passable between April and November for all arms, including heavy M.T. After heavy or continuous rain, certain sections of the road would become impassable for heavy wheeled traffic for at least 24 hours after rain had ceased. The sections of the road most liable to be affected by heavy rains are between Stage 1, Mile 6 , and Basitka, where the road for the most part is unmetalled. The country traversed is a vast undulating plain as far as the Zakho Pass. There are no large areas liable to serious flood. The surface, where not metalled, is clay, in some parts mixed with gravel. There are no hedges or ditches on either side of the road and it is possible to drive off the track almost anywhere. In rainy weather, maintenance parties would be required over the softer parts of the road. In dry weather, light cars could move some distance on either flank of the road without encountering serious obstacles. There are four main bridges along the route— Mosul . . Steel bridge. Khosar Stone bridge. Baqaq . . Steel bridge. Aloka Steel bridge. In addition to these there are a number of small stone bridges and culverts on the route, the destruction of which w r ould not, in the dry season, seriously obstruct traffic. The country as far as the Zakho Pass is open and treeless. Villages are not numerous. Good observation over the surrounding country can be obtained from many points along the route. 2. Water Generally speaking water is scarce throughout the route. Between Mosul and Baqaq the shortage of water would be a serious problem for a large force. The wells at Filfail are inadequate for a force of any size and hand pumps and field troughs would be necessary for watering animals. As far as Baqaq it would be advisable to move in small detachments.141 Route Report No. 44 Rubar-i-Baqaq and the Rubar-i-Dohuk are both crossed by the route and both have an abundant water supply in dry weather. There are springs at the following stages :— Faida, Simel, ’Asi. Those at Faida and ’Asi have a considerable flow in the dry season. Other villages along the route are served by wells : water is found fairly near the surface. The Khabur provides the water supply of Zakho, but care would have to be taken to obtain water for the troops at a point in the river uncontaminated by the town. 3. Supplies Supplies available for men and animals at villages along the route at any time would be sufficient for one battalion. Supplies consist of wheat and barley, rice (at certain stages), ghee, vegetables (at certain stages), bhoosa, fruit (in season), sheep, oxen. At short notice (two to three days) approximately two battalions could be maintained from the villages along the route. 4. Fuel Fuel is scarce along the route until the Zakho Pass is reached. Within a reasonable distance of the mountains, fuel sufficient for a battalion can always be obtained at short notice. Oil, timber and scrub can be obtained at Mosul in large quantities. Supplies of scrub sufficient for a brigade can be obtained at Dohuk and neighbourhood. At Zakho both scrub and crude oil are obtainable in large quantities. 5. Transport The following mechanical transport was registered in the Mosul Liwa in January, 1936 :— 383 cars, 96 lorries. At short notice approximately 1,400 animals could be made available for transport purposes. At five to six days’ notice (including journey of animals to Mosul) pack transport could be obtained from Dohuk as follows :— Animals—Horses and mules, 300, and at eight days’ notice (including the journey of animals to Mosul) from Zakho as follows :— Animals—Horses and mules, 600. All villages along the route possess pack animals varying in number from 10 to 50 according to the size of the village. 6. Grazing In the spring and early summer there is good grazing over the plain as far as the Zakho Pass. In the dry season grazing cannot be reckoned upon, as the greatest part of it is rapidly consumed by the flocks and herds of the inhabitants and the nomadic tribes. The best grazing area lies between Faida and the Zakho Pass. 7. Obstacles In the event of any of the main bridges being destroyed, special bridging equipment and technical labour would be required to replace them. The lesser bridges and culverts could, if destroyed, be repaired by ordinary military or civil working parties with ordnance tools. Timber and stone is not available along the greater portion of the route except in the neighbourhood of the mountains. Timber (poplar) could be obtained at Mosul, Dohuk, and at Zakho. The road over the Geli Spi could be blocked by large boulders which would have to be cleared by explosives.Route Report No. 44 142 8. Additional Work Road improvement is now being carried on by the P.VV.D. along certain sections of the route, and in course of time it is intended to improve the surface throughout. Additional work would be required over certain sections after heavy rain. Over particularly soft patches it would be necessary to lay stones or branches for temporary repair. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds Filfail. —Camping ground for an infantry brigade immediately south of village on either side of road, but local water supply is not sufficient for a force of this size. Faida. —Camping ground for 1 battalion and 1 battery close to the springs immediately west of the village. A larger force could be distributed north of the village some distance from water supply. Simel. —Camping ground for about 2 battalions south and west of village close to springs. A larger force could be accommodated east of village but some distance from water supply. 'Asi. —Camping ground for a brigade west of village not far from water supply. Zakho. —Camping ground for a division along Khabur and on hills south of town. Landing Grounds .— Mosul .. R.A.F. landing ground (137 P/SW. 14b.5.6) ; Simel . . Unfit after heavy rain (137 L/NE.l lc.40.65) ; Zakho . . Unfit after heavy rain (137 K/SE.26b.94.43). Emergency Landing Grounds .— Filfail . . £ mile south-east of village and on right of road (dry weather) ; Faida .. Midway between Faida and Gir-i-Pan (dry weather). 10. Communications Telegraph. —Mosul-Zakho-Jazirat Ibn Omar. Telephone. —Mosul-Zakho-Bersivi-Shiranish-Faish Khabur. Roads. —Roads passable for light cars in dry weather along the route :— Mosul-Tall Kaif. Faida-Khershinia-Dosteka. Simel-Havrisk. Geli Spi-Faish Khabur. Zakho-Faish Khabur. Zakho-Bersivi. Zakho-Shiranish. The whole of the ' plain ” country as far as the Zakho Pass is intersected by tracks connecting villages, and many of these are passable for light cars. 11. Climate Rain falls between November and April. January and February are the months of heaviest rainfall. Snow lies to a depth of a few inches in winter on the Zakho Pass. Rivers begin to rise in November and subside in July. The period of high floods is from the middle of April to the end of June. There is practically no shade for troops and animals along the route during the summer months.143 Route Report No. 44 12. Tactical The occupation of the Zakho Pass by an enemy would effectively close the route. Picqueting would be necessary through the Zakho Pass. Flank guards would suffice over the remainder of the route. The best defensive positions for a rearguard to a force retreating along the route are :— Zakho Pass. —This position blocks the pass. Excellent observation. Simel. —Position at point 1736 covers withdrawal over Rubar-i-Dohuk. Faida. —Position on Chia-i-Dakhan. Baqaq. —Position on left bank of river. Filfail. —Position on left bank of stream. The plain as far as the Zakho Pass is ideal cavalry country and conceal ment from air observation would be difficult. In the dry season, armoured cars could operate to a limited extent on either flank of the route. 13. Rains and Floods After heavy rains certain sections of the road would be unfit for M.T. for a period of 24 to 48 hours. Sections of the road affected by rains are decreasing as road improvement work continues. No section of the road is seriously affected by floods. The numerous wadis carry off flood water after exceptional rains. 14. Inhabitants Mosul-Baqaq. —Chaldeans, Turkomans, and Arabs—non-tribal. Indif ferently armed. Peaceable and non-fighting. Baqaq-Simel. —Assyrians, Yezidis, Kurds. Assyrians : Various tribes. Well armed, peaceable. Would join any Assyrian rising. Yezidis : Shaikhan division, ill-armed, peaceable.

Kurds : Guli and Sindi, Sloopi. Well armed. At present friendly to Government. Chaldeans and Jews : Peaceable, unarmed. 15. Alternative Routes The only alternative route is that up the western bank of the Tigris crossing the river at Faish Khabur (fordable in summer only), thence along the southern bank of Khabur River through Bachuka to Zakho. This route follows the Mosul-Nisibin road to Bir Ugla, thence to Tall Khanzir, ’Ain Chaqal Baqal, and Khanik. The route is passable in dry weather for light cars.Route Report No. 44 144 Stages No. of Stage. Name. Distance. Inter. Total. 17 17 Remarks.

General The route is well defined throughout and is passable for all arms It is metalled in places and is macadamised up to Mile 3-5 in Stage 1 . Modern stone culverts take the route across the numerous irrigation channels at the end of Stage 1 and beginning of Stage 2 . .... ^ is badl y corrugated at Mile 3-5, Stage 1 , and Mile 15-9, Staee 5 . fhe Dujaih Canal (2 C/NW.2a.3.6) no longer holds water. The route would be impassable for at least 48 hours after heavy rain.153 Route Report No. 49 2. Water Due to the proximity of the river and railway line throughout the route, the supply of water is plentiful. Details will be found in stages. 3. Fuel Brushwood along river bank in small quantities. 4. Transport Other than motor vehicles, details of which are given below, there is no local transport of any military value en route. In January, 1936, the following motor vehicles were registered in the Liwas of Baghdad and Mosul :— Baghdad . . 1,592 cars, 676 lorries. Mosul .. 383 cars, 96 lorries. River steamers can, with difficulty reach Mosul during the high water season (March to April). 5. Grazing Providing a plentiful rainfall occurs during December, January and February, grazing is good between Sumaika and Samarra. 6. Obstacles There are no obstacles of any military importance in this section of the route. The destruction of the Victory Bridge over the Dujaili Canal and the more modern structure adjacent to it (2 C/NW.2a.3.6) would delay the progress of troops, but the canal could be temporarily bridged without much difficulty. 7.

Date: —30th April, 1934. Map Reference: —£-in. ’Iraq Survey, 138 N/SE and NE, 138 M/SW. Epitome 1. General The route is well defined throughout and passes between the railway line and the River Tigris, which are both in alignment with it, and never exceeding a distance of 2 miles from it. The route is passable for all arms. The surface of the route, with the exception of short stretches that are macadamised or metalled, is hard earth with occasional small sand belts. 2. Water Permanent supply from Tigris. Easily accessible for men and animals. Detailed information of water supplies available from railway sources is given in stages. 3. Fuel Nil, except for tamarisk thorn near the river. 4. Transport There is no local transport of any military value en route. River steamers navigate as far as Mosul during March and April. 5. Grazing After the first rains (about December) the whole area is covered with short grass, affording unlimited grazing for horses, cattle and sheep. Towards the end of April the plains assume a barren aspect and grazing is limitep to areas adjacent to the river and major wadis. 6. Obstacles No obstacles of military importance exist between Samarra and Baiji, and movements are more likely to be impeded by weather conditions than any physical feature encountered. The surface of the road is macadamised and metalled from mile 54-9 till entering Baiji. It passes through a wide sand belt. There is no alternative way for transport in the event of the route being rendered impassable. 7. Camping and Landing Grounds Mile 17-9, Mile 22-4, Tikrit. Unlimited throughout Stage 3 and at Baiji. 8. Communications Telegraph communications are available at Samarra, Fikrit and Baiji. 9. Climate The normal sub-tropical climate of Central ’Iraq.

Tactical At Mile 6-4, ruins of Qal’at al Ashiq (A1 Ajik) (138 N/SE.22b.4.8) offer strong defensive positions. At Mile 29-3 remains of old trench systems are astride of route. The ruins of Abu Rajas (138 N/NE.13d.8.7) could be easily converted into defensive positions and would cover the river at this point. Country through which route passes is unsuitable for Armoured Car operational purposes, except Stages 2 and 3. Efficient patrol of the river and armoured train support on the railway would cover both flanks of a force moving along this route. 11. Rains and Floods It is considered that in normal conditions the route would not be impass able for more than 48 hours with the exception of the undermentioned points :— Mile 8 - 8 , Mile 14-0, Mile 15-3, Mile 32-0 and Mile 51-5. which might be impassable for a period up to 4 days.

Water is available from wells in the plain throughout Stage 1 , but a guide would be required to locate them. Water from the Tigris is available when Sharqat is reached. 3. Fuel Nil. 4. Transport Nil. 5. Grazing Excellent and unlimited from December to April. 6. Obstacles Destruction of the concrete ramp over the Wadi Shuraimiya (138 N/NW and N/NE. 6 b.2.7) would only impede military movements when the wadi was in flood. An offshoot of the Wadi Mahah at Mile 44 • 0 is crossed by means of a boulder ramp. If the route at this point was destroyed no alternative method of crossing this big wadi is available. 7.

The coldest months and those in which most rain may be expected are December to February, but heavy rain sometimes occurs as late as May. 10. Tactical The desert is everywhere passable in dry weather and excellent opportunities are afforded for the use of armoured cars in area bounded to the east by the Jabal Makhul and to the west by the Wadi Tharthar. The only serious obstacle encountered is the Wadi Shuraimiya and the sand hills near its junction with the Tigris north of Baiji. Point in the crest of Jabal Makhul at Mile 35 • 3 in Stage 2 commands field of fire across the section of the route from ’Ain Dibs. At Mile 45-4 the ruins of Ashur immediately east of the route offer good defensive positions. Boat ferry to take 6 tons and Blondin overhead cable ferry capable of carrying 3 tons, property of the 'Iraq Petroleum Company located at A1 Fat-ha gorge at Mile 10-1 along the old Turkish marching route at Sharqat. 11. Rains and Floods It is considered that in normal conditions the route would not be impassable for more than 48 hours after heavy rain, with the exception of the section below :— Mile 6-6 in Stage 1 to Mile 26-5 in Stage 2, where it crosses a plain into which Wadis from the Jabal Makhul drain the rainfall. The route in these sections might be impassable for a period up to four days. 12. Inhabitants In the winter and spring numerous Shammar encampments are located east and west of the route.

General The route is metalled or macadamised throughout, with the exception of very short stretches in the earlier stages. Bridges and culverts are built on modern lines and the route is ramped where necessary when passing through the limestone hill country in Stages 4 and 5. Unlimited from the River Tigris throughout the route. 3. Fuel Nil. 4. Transport The main supplies of transport, i.e., mechanical, animal and river, emanate from Mosul. 5. Grazing Between Sharqat and Arij, Stage 4, grazing is plentiful during the months' of December-May. Between Arij and Mosul the country is semi-cultivated with large percentage of limestone ; consequently, grazing is limited and of little military value. 6. Obstacles At Mile 5-8 in Stage 1, the Wadi Jirnaf is spanned by a three-arched concrete bridge which, if destroyed, would seriously impede military move ments owing to the lack of an alternative route across this wadi. If the bridges over che Wadi Jahannam in Stage 4 were destroyed, some difficulty would be encountered, but long delay should not occur. Destruction of a bridge spanning a wadi just before entering Arij (137 P/SW.21d.l.4) would impede progress. Destruction of any portion of this route in Stage 5 would impede military movement considerably, owing to the broken and hilly nature of the country on each side of the route. 7. Camping and Landing Grounds At Mile 4-1 in Stage 1, Mile 14-0 in Stage 2, Miles 28-4 and 34-4 in Stage 3 and the northern section of the Mosul Plain. 8.

Tactical Very limited for armoured cars operational purposes. Movement of troops throughout the route would have to be undertaken with great care, necessitating permanent posts ahead and on both flanks owing to the broken and hilly nature of the terrain, which presents throughout suitable positions for ambushes. Owing to numerous defiles and high ground on the flanks, the route can be kept under constant observation by hostile elements. 11. Rains and Floods The route would be passable for all arms even after heavy rain, with the exception of Mile 2-9 from beginning of Stage 2, Mile 25-7 to Mile 30-5 in Stage 3, which might be impassable for about 24 hours. 12.

One filled-in well, 3 ft. deep, with a top diameter of 6 ft. Water would be found after digging approximately 5 ft. (vi) Ramadi. I.38/N.B.3/25.70. This route only leads to the River Euphrates at the opposite bank to that on which Ramadi stands. There is no village on this bank. There is no bridge or ferry suitable for M.T; a boat ferry operates, for pedestrians only, near the house of Shaikh Hardan. Cultivation is carried on to a depth of 2 - 3 miles from the river bank. The soil is laden with salts and is dark brown. 2. General When using this route it should be noted that in many instances the map is inaccurate. Its description on the 1 : 1,000,000 map 1.38 as a “ Main Road ” is incorrect; there is no defined track and it is therefore advisable to take a guide. After crossing the River Tigris at Samarra by a double boat ferry suitable for all M.T., a good road runs by the side of the branch railway for 2 miles to the main Baghdad-Baiji railway at Samarra station. Crossing the railway line immediately north of Samarra station, the route leads across the landing ground and through a little cultivation to a ridge of hills which runs north and south, approximately 4 miles from the river at Samarra. This ridge is best crossed at approximately 1 mile south of a point opposite the railway station. From here to within 5 miles of its termination at the River Euphrates, the way leads over slightly undulating desert. The above stages offer the easiest route running between higher and more sandy ground to the east and salt marshes to the west. The desert is suitable for all types of M.T., with the exception of heavy transport after rains, when local depressions should be avoided even by light cars. From Tall Qabr Faraj (1.38/N.B.2/55.05), approximately 6 miles from the end of the route, small hills offering no difficulty are crossed until the cultivation is reached. Here a track is met at Mile 66-2 leading in a westerly direction to Shaikh Hardan (1.38/N.B.3/30.90), Mile 70-8, and in an easterly direction to Falluja. Irrigation ditches are crossed by strong culverts. From Shaikh Hardan, a graded road leads straight across the cultivation in a southerly direction to the River Euphrates. There is no crossing here, nor does this road lead to one. The ferry mentioned in Stage (vi), Ramadi, is between this point and Shaikh Hardan. It is reached by a track, unsuitable for M.T., which leads past the Shaikh’s house from the graded road at Mile 70-8. By filling in irrigation ditches, this track could be made suitable for light cars.Route Report No. 50 178 3. Water Besides wells detailed in paragraph 1 , there are other wells situated off the route. The majority of the wells in this desert are disused and would require digging out to provide water. The level of the water is slightly affected by rains. The supply can only be effectively increased by digging. Except for the Tigris at Samarra and the Euphrates at Ramadi, wells are the only available water supply. Though some are brakish, none are unfit for drinking. 4. Grazing. (For sheep and camels.) In the summer a little grazing is found in depressions ; in winter it is good. (For horses). None away from the rivers. 5. Obstacles In the vicinity of Hulaiq adh Dhib, the surface becomes slightly heavy, necessitating lower gear work on upward slopes. To the south of Tarrah there is a salt marsh which should be avoided, by a detour to the west of approximately 1 mile. 6. Camping Grounds Unlimited throughout, the country being open desert between the two rivers. Landing Grounds. —Unlimited. Local depressions should be avoided in wet weather. Patches of grazing should be avoided as indicating rough ground. 7. Communications Nil. 8. Climate Normal for Central ‘Iraq. Abnormal floods would probably make the track impassable from Shaikh Hardan to the river bank. 9. Tactical The hills, crossed 1 mile to the west of the railway at Samarra station, command the railway and, if held by enemy forces, would necessitate a detour to the north of approximately 30 miles, or to the south of approximately 10 miles. These are, however, an isolated range and unlikely to be held by any large force owing to lack of supplies or communications to the west. No other tactical features. 10. Inhabitants Few. Semi-nomadic. Shammar (Jarba) tribe. Sunnis. The Dulaim tribe (Sunnis) mainly agriculturalists, are settled on the Euphrates near Ramadi. Peaceful and friendly (April, 1934).179 ROUTE REPORT No. 54 SHURA to RAWA via AL HADHR (HATRA) Total Distance :—155 miles. Number of Stages: —2. Authority :—Air Staff (Intelligence), 'Iraq. Date: —1st April, 1934. Map References: —^-in.‘Iraq Survey, 138 M/NW, 138 I/NE, and 138 F/NE and SE. 1 : 250,000, sheets 1.38/A and I.38/G. Epitome 1. General Track is passable for all types of mechanical transport in dry weather. During heavy rain, however, several wadis encountered would be impassable. The route leaves Shura in a south-westerly direction, crosses the Wadis Qasab and Baijwaniya, the Jabal Najma and, at mile 12-9, meets the Mosul- 'Ain Dibs track, and at Mile 13-4, the crossing of the Wadi A1 Murr. From Mile 12-9 it follows the Mosul-’Ain Dibs track, due south, to Mile 20-5, where it leaves it on a bearing of 240° across undulating country with firm even surface, intersected by several small wadis, none of which present any particular difficulty. At Mile 39-2 it reaches the Wadi Tharthar at a point 2 miles north-east of A1 Hadhr, and crossing it reaches A1 Hadhr at Mile 41-2. From A1 Hadhr to Rawa the route runs in a general south-west by south direction over undulating country with occasional soft patches to Mile 144-6. From this point to the end of the route (Mile 155) the country is hilly and broken. 2. Water Good wells are situated at Shura, where water is always available. Two salt lakes, approximately one square mile in area, are situated at Mile 88-4 and Mile 98-8. These would probably evaporate to a large extent in summer. Brackish water is available at Mile 103-4 in two pools ; this wadi, however, would probably dry up during the summer months. The town of Rawa itself is situated on the Euphrates. 3. Supplies There are no supplies available at Shura and A1 Hadhr except by arrangements with Mosul or Sharqat. Flocks of sheep are occasionally available from tribes in the vicinity of A1 Hadhr and along the Wadi Tharthar. From A1 Hadhr to Rawa no supplies are available on the route except a very limited number of goats and sheep, which might be available from bedouin encampments in the vicinity of the track. At Rawa, where two water-power flour mills exist, a limited supply of grain is available.Route Report No. 54 180 4. Fuel Wood fuel is available at Rawa only, in the form of date palms. 5. Transport No motor transport is available throughout the route. About 50 horses are available at Rawa. 6. Grazing Is practically unlimited throughout the route in season. Between Miles 111-6 and 113-8, however, it is limited to patches in small valleys between stony ridges. 7. Obstacles The stage Shura-Al Hadhr presents no special difficulty except the crossing of the Wadis Qasab and Tharthar. The Wadi Qasab appears to have only one crossing, which is practicable for light cars and could be made so for armoured cars with the aid of running boards. The Wadi Tharthar appears to be impassable in the wet season, even for light cars ; there are one or two places, however, near A1 Hadhr, where crossings might be made, even by armoured cars, with preparation and labour. Extreme care is necessary when approaching the salt lakes at Miles 88-4 and 98 • 8 , owing to the soft sand and treacherous nature of the ground sur rounding the water’s edge. From Mile 144-6 to Rawa, broken and hilly country is encountered. Wadis exist in this stretch which would be impass able by heavy transport in wet weather. 8. Additional work The approaches to the Wadis Qasab and Tharthar should be levelled. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds The nearest landing ground to Rawa in the vicinity of this track is situated at Mile 153-8. Camping and landing grounds can be made at most other points along the track. Recognised landing grounds exist at A1 Hadhr (138 I/NE.33b.8.8) and ’Ana (138 F/SE.6d.7.1). 10. Communications Nil. 11. Climate As for Central and Northern 'Iraq. 12. Tactical From Shura to Mile 144-6, the country is open and, generally speaking, flat, very little cover being available. From Mile 144-6 to Rawa, the track passes through broken hilly country which would provide extensive cover for hostile parties on both sides of the track. 13. Rains and Floods The country in the vicinity of Miles 88-5 and 98-8 would be extremely difficult for heavy transport in wet weather owing to the soft nature of the surface. The last 10 miles of the track would be difficult in wet weather owing to the number of wadis. 14. Inhabitants Shammar Arabs. 15. Alternative Routes Nil.181 Route Report No. 84 88-4 (47’2).

General From Baghdad to Falluja (Stages 1 and 2), the route traverses the area between the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, known as the Falluja Plain. The first 5 • 9 miles are under cultivation, the remaining country, with the exception of a cultivated area around Khan Nuqta (Mile 17-8), being mainly barren plain with ancient and disused water courses intersecting it at intervals. Crossing the River Euphrates at Falluja by a bridge of 5 truss spans, 900 ft. long by 12 ft. wide, the route follows the general course of the river through considerable cultivation to Ramadi. The river is to the right and a range of sand hills, which in many cases command the road, to the left. Stages 2 and 3 are passable for all arms at all seasons, but Stage 1 and Miles 63-6 to 67-4 (Stage 4) are rendered impassable after heavy rains. From Ramadi to Rutba (Stages 5 and 6 ), the track is well defined and suitable for all types of mechanical transport. Certain sections in Stage 5 would become impassable for approximately 48 hours after heavy rain, though this portion of the route is now (1936) being metalled [see para. 11— Additional Work) and should, on completion be passable at all times. Stage 5 is featureless, plain country, interspersed with tracts of undulating or slightly broken ground. It is improbable that heavy rain would render Stage 6 impassable, the soil being either basalt or limestone. From approximately Mile 217-4 (Mile 78-7, Stage 6 ) until Rutba is reached, the track runs through broken country interspersed with cone-shaped limestone hills varying from 50 to 200 ft. in height. From Rutba to the Transjordan frontier, the track is well defined and suitable for all types of mechanical transport. Crossing the Wadi Hauran, which crossing is narrow, and leaving the Damascus track to the north, the track takes a west-south-west course, and the country undergoes considerable changes of features. Plain, undulating gravel, limestone hills and basalt country alternate. At very few places would heavy rain render this stage impassable for more than twelve hours. In Stages 5, 6 and 7 no bridges or culverts are encountered. Other crossings are as detailed in stages.Route Report No. 55 184 2. Water Water is obtainable from the irrigation channels in the cultivated areas in Stage 1 and from the Abu Ghuraib canal at Khan Nuqta. From this point to Falluja (Stage 2) it is scarce. From Falluja to Ramadi (Stages 3 and 4), due to the proximity of the river, the supply of water is plentiful. Between Ramadi and Rutba (Stages 5 and 6 ) there are no known sources of supply. At Rutba, in addition to numerous wells within a mile or so of the post, there is a well in the courtyard of the fort. The water is good. The ’Iraq Petroleum Company also have four wells about 6 miles from Rutba fort and 2 miles north of the Rutba-Damascus track, with a total capacity of 15,000 gals, a day. 3. Supplies All major supplies are from Baghdad, the only other centres being Falluja and Ramadi. For details, see stages. In the winter and spring, large flocks of sheep normally graze on the Falluja plain. In the summer they are concentrated near the river and may be at some distance from the route. There are no supplies available between Ramadi and Rutba. A very limited number of sheep are available at Rutba. 4. Fuel Fuel is extremely scarce throughout the route. Small quantities of fuel are available at Falluja and Ramadi. For details see Stages. 5. Grazing Between Baghdad and Ramadi (Stages 1 to 4), provided that plentiful rainfall occurs during December, January and February, there is good grazing thioughout the stages from December to May inclusive. Between Ramadi and Rutba (Stages 5 and 6 ), some grass from December to April and camel thorn, in places, all seasons. From Rutba to the Transjordan frontier (Stage 7), owing to the large percentage of basalt and limestone, grazing is practically non-existent, except scrub in the wadis. 6. Obstacles In Stages 1-4, the destruction of the Khirr bridge over the Nahr Washshash at Mile 3-4, the bridge across the Euphrates at Falluja, or the 35 ft. iron bridge over the Khasrawiya canal at Mile 45-3, would form serious obstacles. Flood water between Ramadi and Falluja is liable to cut the route [see paras. 13 and 14 (a) ). At Mile 118-9 the route crosses the bed of the Wadi Muhammadi for a quarter of a mile and is very rough. At Mile 237-9 very rough going is experienced when crossing the bed of a narrow wadi. 7. Camping and Landing Grounds Suitable ground for camping is available throughout Stages 1-4, but the sites would be limited in Stages 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 by lack of water. Suitable landing grounds are available throughout the route ; prepared sites exist at :— Baghdad. Landing ground 1 Landing ground 3 Landing ground 5 Landing ground 7 Falluja (Mile 38). (Mile 84-4). Landing (Mile 138-7). Landing (Mile 182-8). Landing (Mile 225-1). Landing Ramadi (Mile 67-4). ground 2 (Mile 113-9). ground 4 (Mile 163-1). ground 6 (Mile 201-1). ground, Rutba (Mile 246-1).185 Route Report No. 55 From Rutba to the frontier, landing grounds exist at Mile 269 • 6 (Landing ground 10); Mile 283-9 (Landing ground 11); Mile 301-2 (Landing ground R) ; and Mile 315-6 (Landing ground P). Fuel and oil supplies are obtainable at Baghdad, Raxnadi, Landing ground 5, and Rutba. For details see Stages. 8. Communications (а) Government Telegraph. —Baghdad to Falluja and Ramadi. W/T at Rutba. Iraq Petroleum Company pumping stations in the vicinity of the route are in communication by telegraph, telephone and W/T with Kirkuk, Haifa and Tripoli (Syria). Telephone. —Baghdad to Falluja, Ramadi, Rutba, Transjordan, Palestine and Egypt. ( б ) Rail Communication. —Nil. (c) River. —Falluja to Ramadi (for shallow draught native craft only). (d) Road. — See Stages. 9. Tactical The plain traversed during the first two stages offers few tactical positions. From Mile 10 to Mile 20, however, there are a number of disused water channels with banks up to 15 ft. These could, with very little work, be turned into strong defensive positions. Stages 1-5 do not lend themselves favourably to armoured car action, due to the cultivation, broken state of the country, hills and soft patches. Likely points of tactical value would appear to be— Miles. 34 The bridge over the Euphrates. 40 Road passes large palm grove offering good cover for ambush. 46 -3 (61-3). The road traverses a narrow strip of land bordered on the right by the river Euphrates and on the left by mica covered hills, which in places, tower 150 feet above and approach to the edge of the road, thus forming a good position for attack. It would be necessary to hold these hills before a force could advance with safety on the road. 78 • 5 Depression immediately north of the track ; ground falls away ; suitable location for cover. 147-8 Rising ground adjacent to both sides of the track cover it at this point. 182 • 2 Track has gradually climbed to high ground from which an extensive field of fire is obtained to all points of the compass. 272-7 While crossing between hills at this point the track is covered by limestone hills from the north. 10. Inhabitants The country in the vicinity of Baghdad is occupied by various cultivating tribes. From Falluja the route passes through the country of the Dulaim tribe, who are cultivators and semi-nomads The Anaiza tribe graze at certain times of the year in the Ramadi districts. They are normally peaceful. 11. Additional Work “ Metalling ” is available at many points along the route. Surfacing of the track (with bitumen) for the first 50 miles west of Ramadi was commenced in 1935 and is expected to be completed in 1936.Route Report No. 55 186 12. Transport (a) Animal. The number of camels available would depend largely on the time of the year. I he Anaiza tribe, possessing many thousands, pass through the Ramadi sector at different times. {b) Vehicular. —A large number of commercial motor vehicles of all types use this road. The Nairn and other transport companies owning numbers of large passenger and freight vehicles have their headquarters in Baghdad. There is also considerable taxi traffic between Baghdad and Ramadi. In January, 1936, the following motor vehicles were registered in the Baghdad and Dulaim Liwas :— Baghdad—1,592 cars ; 676 lorries. Dulaim—64 cars ; 13 lorries. A percentage of these vehicles would be available for use on this route. 13. Rains and Floods Under normal conditions, the route would not be impassable for mechanical transport for more than 48 hours after heavy rain. During exceptional floods, the route might be cut between Falluja and Ramadi and cross-desert convoys from Baghdad to Rutba would have to use the route outlined in para. 14 (a)—Alternative routes. 14. Alternative Routes [а) If road is cut between Falluja and Ramadi, then after crossing the bridge at Falluja. and proceeding towards Ramadi, at Mile 45 a track leads off to the left, this passes to the south of the Habbaniya lake and joins the Karbala—Ramadi road (Route No. 58) between Rahaliya and Ramadi. ( б ) If the bridge at Talluja is destroyed the alternative route is via Baghdad-Musaiyib-Karbala (Route No. 61) Shithatha-Ramadi (Route No 58). 15.

Authority :—Air Staff (Intelligence), ’Iraq. Date : —1st April, 1934. Map References :— i-in. ’Iraq Surveys 138 J/SW, 138 K/NE, 138 F/NE and SE, 138 B/SE and F/SW. J-in. Survey of India 1-38/N, 1-38/G. Epitome 1. General The route is passable for all arms, excepting Miles 1-4 to 3-4 (Stage 1), 13-8 to 15-4 (Stage 1) and Mile 140-6 (Stage 7), after heavy rain. It is clearly defined throughout, and built up in some sections. With the exception of the wooden bridge at Mile 27, bridges are all built on modern lines and culverts are safe throughout the route. For the most part the route runs across undulating plains, but some broken country with many small wadis is passed. It follows the right bank of the river, touching it at salients, but being some distance from it at re-entrants. 2. Effects of Seasons and Floods Under normal conditions, the track would not be impassable for mechanical transport for more than 24 hours, though near Khan abu Rayat (Stage 1) and the Widyan Krazka watercourse (Stage 7), this period might be prolonged to 48 hours. 3. Climate The normal sub-tropical climate of Central and Southern ’Iraq. The hot season extends from May to August, and the coolest months, and those in which rain may be expected, are December to February. 4. Camping and Landing Grounds Are unlimited throughout the route, except from approximately Hit (Mile 35-8) to a point about 17 miles from the town, and for a few miles east of A1 Qaim (Mile 174-3). There are prepared landing grounds at Ramadi (1-38/N.3b.22.67), Hit (138 K/NE.29a.5.0), Haditha (138 J/SW.35a.5.7) and 'Ana (138 F/SE.6d.7.1).(C 23303) H 193 Route Report No. 57 [zy 5. Supplies At Ramadi, barley and wheat are plentiful. The Jazira district here is noted for its dates and potatoes. Small numbers of sheep are also available, though, generally, meat is not to be depended upon. It is possible to obtain sheep from the tribes en route, but these may be at some distance from the river. It would be advisable for a force to take meat on the hoof. Wheat, barley, rice, flour, dried fruits and dates are available in considerable quantities at all the towns en route. For details, see stages. • 6. Transport The river is navigable for vessels of shallow draught as far as Hit and there is considerable traffic by native craft. Beyond Hit there is no upstream traffic, but shakhturs are floated down the Euphrates from Deir ez Zor and Abu Kamal. Mahailas and shakhturs would be available if notice were given. The number of camels available would depend largely on the time of the year. The Anaiza tribe, possessing many thousands of camels, pass through the Ramadi sector at various times of the year. Likewise, the Albu Mahal tribe in the Hit sector, would be a source of supply. In the Haditha sector, a limited number of camels could be obtained within two or three days. The many riverain tribes on the route could supply an unlimited number of donkeys. In January, 1936, a total of 64 cars of various makes and 13 lorries were registered in the Dulaim (Ramadi) Liwa. A proportion of these may be expected to be available. Other requirements in mechanical transport must be obtained from Baghdad. 7. Fuel Fuel is very scarce, excepting from the towns en route ; Hit (Mile 35-8), Hawiya Arban (Mile 82-6), Haditha (Mile 87'3), Ana (Mile 123-2) and A1 Qaim (Mile 174-0). At many stages of the route the track runs in alignment with the river bank. Low scrub and reeds are available at frequent intervals. 8. Grazing Provided a plentiful rainfall occurs during December, January and February, there is good grazing over the entire route from December to May inclusive. 9. Obstacles Miles. 0 • 8 Bridge spanning the 'Aziziya canal. 22-9 Track crosses Wadi Muhammadi, which would present difficulty after rain. 26 1 Track descends in a series of “ S ” bends through defiles to the level of the river. The destruction of the approach would be a serious obstacle. 29-5 Track passes through defile in alignment with the river bank for about 500 yards, sides of defile 30 ft. high ; destruction of any part of this defile would prove a serious obstacle. 35-7 A two-arched stone bridge crossing a stream running south-west to north-east. 37- 1 A three-arched wood and concrete bridge crossing a large wadi. 38- 1 Track passes between bund 5 ft. high to marshy ground and wadi crossed by stone and girder culvert in bad repair. 43-6 Two concrete bridges crossing the Wadi Marj.&lt;r-' : Route Report No. 57 194 Miles. 46-9 A girder bridge with concrete buttresses, this bridge is 36 yards long and crosses the Wadi Khubbaz. 48 Since Mile 46 • 9, the track passes through broken open stony country, presenting natural defensive and entrenching positions. 61 Track descends by four hairpin bends across Wadi Baghdadi, west bank of river, with hills 200 ft. high on the south side. 61-8 A three-arched stone bridge crossing the Wadi al Asad. 70 A 45 yards long, five-arched, steel girder and concrete bridge crosses the Wadi Hauran. 75-8 Track descends by a number of hairpin bends into a wadi. The road crosses the wadi on a bund built up of stones ; this portion of the route could easily be rendered impassable. 81-7 Concrete bridge crosses a large wadi. 83-7 An eleven-arched stone bridge crosses the Wadi Haqlan. 85-7 Massive limestone and chalk hills tower over the western side of the road, while palm groves extend from the east side of the road to the river. 120 3 A nine-arched stone and girder bridge crosses the Wadi Al Qasr. 122 A one-arched stone bridge crosses the Wadi Judaida. If this bridge were destroyed there would be no other method of effecting a crossing. 123-1 Track approaches a left hairpin bend, to a wadi crossed by a stone boulder bridge, to where towering rocks overhang the west side of the track. There is very little clearance between the hoods of covered-in transport and the rocks. 142 -3 The Widyan Krazka, a dried-up water course, is crossed by a stone and girder bridge. 142-7 Another dried-up water course is crossed by a stone and girder bridge. 149-5 Track is ramped up and crosses wadi. Impassable country for transport on each side of the track at this point. 10. Communications (1) Telegraph and Telephone :— {a) Ramadi-Hit-Hawiyah Arban-Haditha. (b) Telegraph—Al Qaim. (c) W/T—’Iraq Police W/T Station at Ramadi. (2) River .—The river is navigable as far as Hit for mahailas and there is considerable traffic. Above this point there is little traffic. The river would be navigable for launches for most of the year. (3) Roads :— Mile 1 -7, Junction of Rutba, Rahaliya and Hit roads. Mile 36-6, road to Kubaisa. 11. Inhabitants From Ramadi to Al Qaim the route passes through the country of the Dulaim. These tribesmen are cultivators. The Anaiza tribe graze at certain periods of the year in the Ramadi district and are normally peaceful.195 Route Report No. 57 12. Tactical Although efficient patrol of the river would guard the right flank of a force moving along this route, it would have its left flank menaced the whole way from the hills on this side. The route does not lend itself favourably to armoured car action, due to cultivation, the broken state of the country, hills and soft patches. Likely points of tactical value would appear to be— Miles. 30 Track passes through defile in alignment with the river bank for about 500 yards. Sides of defile about 30 ft. high. Destruction of any part of this defile would prove a serious obstacle. 48 Since mile 46 • 9 track passes through broken open country, presenting natural defensive and entrenching positions. 75-4 Track descends by a number of hairpin bends into a small wadi. This part of the track could easily be rendered impassable. 85 • 7 Massive limestone and chalk hills tower over western side of the road, with palm trees between the eastern side of the road and the river. A few deep caves are located in the hillside at this point. 122 A one arched buolder bridge crosses the Wadi Judaida. If this bridge were destroyed there would be no other method of effecting a crossing. 123 1 Track approaches by a left-hand hairpin bend a wadi crossed by a stone bridge, to where towering rocks over-hang the west side of the track. There is very little clearance between the hoods of covered transport and the rocks. 130-5 Small plateau, about 300 ft. high, from where extensive view is obtained to all parts. Good landing and camping ground here. 149-5 Track is ramped up and crosses wadi. Impassable country for transport each side of the track at this point. 150 • 7 200 yards of the track is just wide enough between foothills and river for one-way traffic. 13. Water The proximity of the river at most stages of the route, and numerous towns on route where wells are available, ensure a plentiful supply of water. 14. Materials for Repairs and Additional Work The only metalling available is from the hills. There seems little possibility of improving the track as a whole. At Miles 3-4 and 18-1 track is covered with a layer of subkha or salt. It would be a great improvement if road were metalled at these places. Stages No. of Distance. Stage. Name. Inter. Total.

Low hills on left of track. 2. General The route is the recognised trans-desert route from Baghdad to Damascus and is in constant use by the various transport companies plying between these two towns. [See Route No. 55.) It is fit for all classes of transport, but is liable to flooding at wadi crossings. For some 5-6 miles from Point A westwards, the many tracks are very cut up. Rain, however, would help to consolidate the track here. The track ascends steeply from the valleys on to a flat level plain at Point B. The ascent is stony and rough, but no diversion is possible. From Point B westwards, the surface is excellent. From Rutba to Point A, along the southern branch to Point B and thence to Zuwairiyat, there are signposts painted in black and white stripes, standing about 8 ft. high, at every 5 kilometres. There are no bridges or culverts. 3. Water (i) Two deep wells of excellent water in Rutba Fort. Both wells fitted with hand pumps. (ii) Wells of poor water in wadi bed near Rutba. (iii) Power pumps at ’Iraq Petroleum Company’s wells, 5 miles north-west of Rutba Fort. Water good. For details see Route Report No. 55. (iv) There is no other water available along the route. 4. Grazing There is very fair grazing for camels all along the route, but its value is discounted in summer by the general lack of water.207 Route Report No. 59 5. Obstacles (i) The wadi crossings of Wadi Hauran, Abailli, Mulussa, and Walej, are all stony and rough. The two latter are flat and broad ; the two former are narrow with steep sides and are more liable to flooding. (ii) Ihe ascent on both tracks near Point B is stony and rough and is inclined to be steep. 6. Camping and Landing Grounds (a) Camping Grounds .—For a small force anywhere along the track. For a large force (one brigade, etc.), space is limited in the vicinity of the track between Points A and B, but suitable sites could be found. (b) Landing Grounds :— (i) Rutba. (ii) Landing Ground 9. (iii) Most places west of Point B ; between Points A and B it would be hard to find a suitable place. (iv) Between Rutba and Point A ; no great difficulty in finding a suitable place for landing. 7. Communications (i) Rutba Fort : Post, telegraph, telephone, and wireless station. (ii) 'Iraq Petroleum Company telephone line along the pipe-line with a branch to the ’Iraq Petroleum Company’s wells north-east of Rutba Fort. 8. Climate General ground level is over 2,000 ft. above sea level. Average heat during the summer, but cool nights. Cold in winter (December, 1933, 15° F.) 9. Tactical No difficulty west of Point B owing to flat nature of country. Between Points A and B, tracks are liable to ambush by a mobile force. Pursuit of a mobile and small force would be difficult in this sector owing to the hilly nature of the country. 10. Inhabitants Nomadic. In winter the Ruwalla tribe or other sections of the Anaiza sometimes graze in the area. General attitude friendly.ROUTE REPORT No. 60 BASRA to BAGHDAD via TALL AL LAHM, NASIRIYA, DIWANIYA and HILLAH (3 Parts.) Total Distance: —368-2 miles. Number of Stages: —22.

Its surface of gravelly loam renders it almost entirely free from the effects of rain.209 Route Report No. 60 After passing Mile 17-2 (junction with Busaiya track—signposted) the road converges on the railway and runs parallel with it for a short distance. After this it gradually diverges from railway until, at Mile 59-25, where the track to Ghubaishiya, indicated by a signpost, branches off to the north, the distance of the track from the railway is 6-5 miles. At this point a lone “ sidr ” (acacia) tree of considerable size forms a landmark visible for several miles. The road then gradually closes on the railway again before reaching A1 Luqait, where it passes between the railway station and the low hills lying immediately to its south (B.7662). From A1 Luqait to Jaliba, the general course of the railway is followed, although it is, in most places, a mile or two distant from it. trom Jaliba to Tall al Lahm the surface of the route is still good but much loose dust renders the route difficult to follow in summer, especially in the afternoon, as between these two places one almost invariably encounters much dust-haze. The railway is crossed at Tall al Lahm. From Tall al Lahm to Mile 114, the route is indistinct and hard to follow in summer owing to dust. The whole section from Tall al Lahm to Nasiriya is mainly “ Subkha ” and is liable to be impassable from three to four days after rain. There are several small irrigation canals to be crossed in this section, all of which are bridged by light baulks of timber with an earth surface. These would need to be reinforced, for heavy motor transport or armoured cars. (i) Water Water is unobtainable throughout except at the various specified points along the line. There are gang huts at approximately every 5 miles along the railway between Basra and Tall al Lahm, having 800 gallons of water at each, supplied daily by rail tank wagons from Basra. Wells of the “ hussiyan ” type (see Glossary of Topographical Terms) exist at Kuwaibda, Rumaila and Luqait with a ' Star ” well at Jaliba, but the supply and quality of the water depends on the re-excavation and cleaning of the wells. (ii) Supplies There are no supplies whatsoever available on demand at any point on the route after leaving Zubair. (iii) Fuel The only form of fuel is low desert scrub, which is met with in profusion between Rumaila and Jaliba. The sectors between Zubair and Rumaila and between Jaliba and Tall al Lahm are bare, but there is a small amount of scrub between Tall al Lahm and Nasiriya. (iv) Transport Transport other than the railway does not exist. Camels and motor transport can be most conveniently collected from Zubair and Nasiriya. In January, 1936, the following motor vehicles were registered in the Liwas of Basra and the Muntafiq (Nasiriya):— Basra .. . . 478 cars ; 70 lorries. Muntafiq . . . . 64 cars ; 23 lorries. A proportion of these would be available for use on this route. (v) Grazing Dependent on rainfall. Normally plentiful for camels in winter and spring. There is low desert scrub between Rumaila and Jaliba ; in other sectors it is sparse.Route Report No. 60 210 (vi) Obstacles There are small bridges over irrigation canals on the Tall al Lahm-Nasiriya section which would have to be strengthened if the route was to be used to any extent by transport heavier than a loaded touring car or light lorry. (vii) Additional work See para, (vi) above. (viii) Camping and Landing Grounds Camping and landing grounds are unlimited throughout, the country adjoining the road being dead flat. The area between Tall al Lahm and Nasiriya is unsafe for aircraft, especially in wet weather, owing to numerous irrigation channels, possible flooding, and salt soil. (ix) Communications By Road .—Side tracks leave the route as follows :— To Kuwait (Mile 12). To Busaiya (Mile 15-2). To At Tuba Railway Station (Mile 26). To Ratawi Railway Station (Mile 44). To Ghubaishiya Railway Station (Mile 55-2). To Abu Ghar (Mile 89-6). To Ur, Diwaniya and Baghdad (Mile 104-9). By Railway .—Along the Basra-Baghdad line (metre gauge single track). By Telegraph .—From all stations on the railway by the railway telegraph, and by the railway telegraph or the state telegraph through Basra or Nasiriya. (x) Climate Normal for Southern ’Iraq. (xi) Tactical The country over which the road passes is dead flat and no tactical considerations worthy of mention arise which cannot be appreciated from the map. (xii) Rains and Floods The major portion of the road surface is of firm, gritty, gravelly loam and is scarcely affected by rain. For the effect of rain and floods on the sector Basra-Zubair see Part I, “ General.” The route between Tall al Lahm and Nasiriya is also liable to become water-logged but only after severe rains. (xhi) Inhabitants Apart from Zubair, no towns, villages or other dwelling places are passed through and no population other than that shown below exists. That part of the desert through which the route passes is the recognised area of the Dhafir who, in the late summer, are frequently found at the wells lying near the railway line. In the winter and spring, the Muntafiq shepherd tribes may also be encountered. They are well-armed, but, as a whole, are peaceable and are unlikely to offer opposition to forces moving along the road. In addition, gang huts exist approximately every 5 miles along the line. These huts generally have ten rooms and are occupied by 8 to 10 railway employees with their families. The gang huts have storage tanks for 800 gallons of water.211 Route Report No. 60 (xiv) Alternative Routes An alternative route to the north, liable to flooding, exists from Ghubaishiya to Tall al Lahm via Khamisiya.

This route is at present unsuitable for the passage of armoured cars and heavy mechanical transport. Almost the entire route is “ subkha ” and is thus easily rendered impassable, for periods up to a week, after heavy rain. From Mile 113-6 there are many small irrigation channels, all bridged by rough culverts made from light timber, camel thorn and covered with earth, which would need strengthening to allow armoured cars or heavy trans port to proceed. These could be bridged temporarily by filling the ditches with earth. In summer, for the first 9 miles of this route the track is very indistinct and difficult to follow, and severe dust storms are common.

Nasiriya .—The town of Nasiriya is situated on the left bank of the Euphrates and has a population of approximately 12,000. The headquarters offices of the Administration of the Muntafiq Liwa. &gt;. comprising the Qadhas of Suq ash Shuyukh, Shatra and QaKr* ' A-/KA' 4 /TSikar are situated in the sarai, which is in the centre of the town. The river is spanned by a pontoon bridge of 18 pontoons, a section opening for river traffic. A new bridge is at present under con struction and will be wider than the present bridge and capable of carrying armoured cars and heavy mechanical transport. Armoured cars have crossed the existing bridge (singly) in 1929, but great care is necessary. Water .—From the River Euphrates. Supplies .—A large stock of grain is normally held in the town and 600 tons could be obtained at short notice. There are usually 40 to 60 tons of dates in the town. If arrangements are made with tribes, between 500 and 600 sheep could be obtained daily. A good supply of vegetables is also available in season. Small quantities of assorted goods are available in the “ suq.” Two companies of infantry and 16 armoured cars could easily be accommodated in the sarai. This building, however, is not properly equipped for defence and, situated in the middle of the town, is commanded by several other buildings. The new police barracks on the outskirts of the town on the Shatra road, would accommodate two companies of infantry and 12 armoured cars. These barracks are approximately 300 ft. by 200 ft., with towers at alternate corners, loop-holed for machine-guns, divided, half into barracks and half into stables. Two water tanks which supply the barracks are situated about 150 yards away. Two date gardens near the barracks with high mud walls would give excellent cover for an attacking force. The normal strength of the Liwa police is 200 foot and 400 mounted. Of these, 50 foot and 200 mounted are stationed in Nasiriya. There is a Royal Air Force landing ground with standard markings in juss and whitewash, situated near the railway station. Aviation and M.T. petrol, oil, etc., are obtained from Hajji Talib ibn Hajji Muhammad ’Ali, the local Rafidain Oil Company’s agent (1936). Nasiriya is connected with the main Basra-Baghdad railway by a branch line from Ur Junction ; it is also connected with Basra, Samawa, Hilla and Hindiya by river. Unlimited sites for camping ground can be found either near the railway station or near the new police barracks. Nasiriya is in communication with all main towns of ’Iraq by telegraph and telephone. There is also a post office in the sarai. The following routes, passable by all arms, radiate from Nasiriya :— Nasiriya—Kut al Imara via Shatra, Qala’ Sikar and Kut al Hai. Nasiriya—Suq ash Shuyukh. Nasiriya—Hammar via Albu Salih. Nasiriya—Samawa via Ur. Nasiriya—Samawa via Bat-ha. The town has a hospital, a good rest-house for Europeans and an electric light and power plant.Route Report No. 60 218 Part II NASIRIYA to DIWANIYA via BAT-HA and SAMAWA Total distance :—129 miles. Number of Stages : —7. Map References £-in. ’Iraq Surveys 31/SW, 3E/SE, 3E/SW, 3E/NW, 3A/NE. 1. General The Nasiriya-Diwaniya road is graded throughout and is passable for a force of all arms, including armoured cars. The country traversed by the road is well cultivated ; many culverts are crossed but they are all strongly constructed and offer no obstacle to heavy mechanical transport. From Nasiriya the road follows the river bank until Bat-ha village is passed, after which the road runs parallel with and close to the main Basra-Baghdad railway line, except for a diversion of a few miles in the vicinity of Samawa. From Samawa to Rumaitha (Stage 5) the road is liable to flood, although after the floods of 1929 the bund on which the road runs was made higher and may now be above maximum flood level. The bridge of boats at Samawa is safe for Rolls Royce armoured cars, and there is no necessity to make a detour and use the railway bridge. 2. Water The road follows closely the course of the Euphrates during Stages 1 and 2, whilst in Stages 3 and 4, at the end of each stage, water is available from the Euphrates, which lies at a distance of 2—3 miles from the route throughout the stage. In Stage 5 water is available from the Shatt ash Shuraish, and throughout Stages 6 and 7 from the Shatt al Hilla and irrigation canals. 3. Supplies Large quantities of grain are produced in this district but, normally, are only stored for short periods. Advance supplies from Nasiriya, Samawa, or Diwaniya are essential. 4. Transport (a) Shallow-draft river craft Rumaitha-Diwaniya. Native craft, main Euphrates from Samawa to Baghdad and Basra. (b) Baghdad-Basra railway. (c) Mechanical.—In January, 1936, the following motor vehicles, a pro portion of which should be available, were registered in the Liwas of the Muntafiq and Diwaniya :— Muntafiq .. 64 cars ; 23 lorries. Diwaniya.. 4 cars ; - lorries. 5. Fuel Camel thorn and desert scrub plentiful throughout route. 6. Grazing Limited except from standing crops. Camel grazing good near Rumaitha.219 Route Report No. 60 7. Obstacles The destruction of the railway bridges at Rumaitha, Barbuti and Imam Abdullah (Ref. 3E/SW.10c.2.8) or the destruction of any bund in Stage 5 during the flood season would render the route impassable. Details in stages. 8. Landing and Camping Grounds Royal Air Force landing grounds with standard markings in juss and whitewash are situated at Samawa and Diwaniya. There is unlimited camping ground at end of stage. 9. Communications Railway telegraph. Government telegraph Nasiriya-Samawa-Rumaitha- Diwaniya. Railway telegraph at all stations. Rail and river. There is no alternative road to that reported on. 10. Inhabitants The towns of Nasiriya, Samawa, Rumaitha, and Diwaniya are mainly non-tribal. Tribal areas passed through are — A1 Ghazzi (Shepherds). A1 Zaiyad (shepherds). Adh Dhuwalim. Albu Hassan. Bani 'Ardh. Khaza’il. Mujawir. 11. Rains and Floods The country between Rumaitha and Diwaniya is not liable to flood. Between Samawa and Rumaitha extensive flooding takes place (December- August) but varies in period and extent. Heavy rains make the road impassable for periods varying from two to ten days. This is also applicable to the route between Nasiriya and Samawa, during which considerable stretches of “ subkha ” (salt-impregnated soil) are encountered. 12. Tactical The route from Nasiriya to Samawa offers no tactical considerations. Stage 5.—From Imam ’Abdullah Bridge (4 miles beyond Samawa) to Rumaitha, both road and railway are carried on high bunds. The railway bund, on the east, is somewhat higher than the road bund. The ground on both sides of rail and road are usually flooded or waterlogged. The bridges over the Shatt abu Shuwait (Rumaitha railway station) and Shatt abu Shuraish form important defiles. Stage 6.—During the first half of the stage, the country is rough with many deep, intricate water channels. Camel thorn abounds and there are many plantations of palm trees near the river. Near Rumaitha the road converges to the river and the country during this first half stage would be difficult for an advancing force. In the latter half of this stage the country is featureless except for low bank water channels and desert scrub. Stage 7.—Between Imam Hamza and Diwaniya the country is cultivated, with frequent groups and clusters of sandhills on the east. Phe latter and numerous ruined forts and buildings provide good cover for snipers. 13. Armoured Car Operations In the immediate vicinity of the Nasiriya-Diwaniya road the country is not suitable for armoured car operations except in Stage 3, where uncultivated areas should, in summer, present no difficulties.Route Report No. 60 220 No. of Distance.

Samawa .—The largest and most important town on the river Euphrates between Hindiya Barrage and Nasiriya. It is situated amidst palm gardens on the right bank of the Euphrates, and has a population of about 10,000. It is the market centre and the administrative headquarters of a grain producing Qadha, and acts as a “ desert post ” for caravans from Najd and the Southern Desert. The picturesque covered suq of some 300 shops stores large stocks of grain, rice, dates, oil, cloth and trinkets. The Administrative Sarai and Police Headquarters, on the south bank at the bridge head, is of Turkish origin and is without suitable accommodation for troops or armoured cars. The Mounted Police Barracks, near the railway station on the southern outskirts of the town, a small, strongly constructed, modern building, is well suited for defence. It has stabling for approximately 100 horses and would accommodate six armoured cars or one company of infantry. The pontoon bridge across the Euphrates is of 20 pontoons, strongly built and constructed to meet the 15-ft. rise and fall of the river during floods. It is passable for all arms. One section is removed by hand winches for the passage of river craft. A depot of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Ltd., includes engine repair shops, flour mill, rice huller and wool press. (i) Water .—Unlimited supply of good drinking water from the River Euphrates. There are water tanks at the railway station and mounted police barracks (2,000 gallons), the latter being supplied by pipe from the railway station. (ii) Supplies .—Meat and grain are available immediately for a force of 5,000 men. Fresh fruit and vegetables in limited quantities. Large stocks of rice, dates and oil are stored for trade with desert tribes. It is estimated that there is always 2,000 tons of grain available and that after harvest this stock may increase to 15,000 tons. 52 (1'5). Khidhr village. (See Stage 3). 52 -5 (2).

(vi) Landing and Camping Grounds. —There is a Royal Air Force landing ground with standard markings in juss and whitewash at 3 E/SW. 16a.l.7, near Barbuti bridge. There is not a suitable camping ground at this point. An alternative camping ground lies nearer to Samawa Railway Station. (vii) Obstacles. —The narrow covered Suq at Samawa is difficult at all times for the passage of armoured cars. In times of disturbance the passage of troops or armoured cars through Samawa town would be inadvisable. (viii) Rains and Floods. —Heavy rains are liable to render this road impracticable for mechanical transport during a period of from 3 to 7 days. (ix) Communications. —Railway and government telegraph. Post office on left bank of Euphrates. Railroad and river traffic to Baghdad and Basra. Road : Samawa-Sulman, Route No. 78 ; Samawa-Najaf via right bank of Euphrates. Note. —The latter is a track over desert country ; sand and floods are liable to be encountered. The route was traversed and reported on by cavalry during the war. The road passes through Samawa town, crosses the Euphrates and veers north-west towards the railway again. (See Stage 4, para, (vii), Obstacles). An alternative route, to avoid passing through the town, commences at Samawa Station on the east side of the railway line and leads over saline surface to Barbuti Railway Bridge (Mile 72-5), modern construction, concrete and steel, supported on four concrete piers, approximate height above water level, 45 ft. (30 ft. at flood period). Span, 538 ft. ; width, 12 ft. The track is boarded to take mechanical transport. This alternative route, however, would not be possible after heavy rain or during floods.

Diwaniya is the administrative headquarters of the Diwaniya Liwa, comprising the Qadhas of ’Afaj, Shamiya, Samawa and Abu Sukhair. The town is situated on both banks of the Shatt ad Diwaniya, the larger portion being on the left bank. The population is about 8,000, and there are about 1,000 houses, few of which are well built. The sarai is situated on the left bank of the river between the old sarai and the police barracks. It is a two-storey building of approximately 240 ft. by 90 ft. It has two built-in towers on the corners facing the river, the lower storeys being loop-holed for machine guns. The windows are barred, but they do not appear to be equipped with bullet-proof shutters. The door is of armour plate. The purpose of this sarai appears to be merely to house the offices of the Liwa administration. There is no internal courtyard. The new sarai will be completed and in use by the end of 1934. Two companies of infantry and 12 armoured cars could be accommodated in the sarai and mounted police barracks. The old sarai is an extensive building of Turkish origin, housing the offices of the Liwa authorities and police. The large building of the mounted police barracks, school and civil hospital, form an imposing array on the left bank of the river, north of the town. Liwa police total 193 foot and 433 mounted. Of these 60 foot and 200 mounted are stationed in Diwaniya. The railway station of the main Basra-Baghdad railway is situated about 1 mile from the main town on the right bank of the river. It is an important centre with repair depot, engine sheds, sidings and loading ramps. There is a branch line which runs from the station to the river side, opposite the main town for loading and off-loading of stores and grain to river craft. The station premises include regulation fortified quarters, which could house approxi mately two platoons, but it is commanded by two high water towers. These quarters contain a water tank. There is also a R.A.F. meteorological station at the railway station.227 Route Report No. 60 The new barracks for the ’Iraq Army^situated approximately half way between the railway station and the river, irn iilmnst com pleterl (1934).

The section Diwaniya-Hilla was originally constructed by the Turks to facilitate movement of troops and supplies. The whole route is well defined and passable throughout its stages for a force of all arms, including armoured cars and heavy mechanical transport; it is well bridged by strong modern culverts. The route leaves Diwaniya and proceeds in a north-westerly direction. The country up to Tall Zuna, Mile 21 -8 (2 D/SE.21d) is low lying, salt marshes and minor rice cultivation extending east and west of track for some miles. This section of the road is liable to be impassable for armoured cars during the winter months on account of the ' subkha ” surface. The country between Tall Zuna and Nahr ’Amadiya, Mile 37-6 (2 D/SE.8c) is much affected by rains, as the surface is mainly “ subkha ” and the ground is low. A very small amount of rain renders the road unserviceable, whilst heavy storms will render it unserviceable for about ten days. Between Nahr ’Amadiya and Hilla, Mile 31 -4, the route crosses numerous canals. The bridges spanning them are narrow and care has to be exercised when driving armoured cars on this section of the route. Under normal circumstances this sector is passable throughout the year, but heavy rain would render parts of it impassable for varying periods for wheeled transport. At Mile 51a road branches right to A1 Kabsh. Between Hilla and Khan an Nasiriya, Mile 70-3 (2 D/NW.23b), there is a certain amount of cultivation and grazing for sheep and camels, and the road is lined with young trees. At Mile 55 • 8 a road branches left to Babylon. From Khan an Nasiriya to Latifiya (marked on the map as Khan al Bir), Mile 87 (2 D/NW.5a), there are many patches of soft sand. The surrounding country is covered with light drift sand and the road is partially obscured by it, severe dust storms being often encountered in this neighbourhood. At Mile 72-9 a track branches right to Suwaira, and at Mile 84 a road branches left to Iskandariya. At Mile 84-7 a road branches left to Musaiyib and Karbala. Between Latifiya and Mahmudiya, Mile 91-9 (2 C/SW.35a), there are large areas of cultivation on both sides of the route, which is well defined by willow trees planted on either side. From Mahmudiya the road runs due north into Baghdad via the Khirr Bridge, Mile 109-4 (2 C/SW. 17a) and the Nahr al Washshash. 2. Water Subject to the control of the canal heads on the banks of the Euphrates and the barrages at Hindiya and Daghghara, water can be obtained in almost unlimited quantities from irrigation canals, the Shatt al Hilla and subsidiary channels.229 Route Report No. 00 3. Supplies Minor supplies are available at Khan Mahawil and Mahmudiya. Cereals, vegetables, and meat are available in very limited quantities at Dabla, Hashimiya, and Iman Qasim. The provisioning of a military force would necessitate advance arrangements with Baghdad, Hilla, and Diwaniya. For details see stages. 4. Transport Railways .—The Basra-Baghdad main railway line runs close to the road from Diwaniya to Khan Jadwal, Mile 11 (2 D/SE.34a), where it diverges out to the east of the route, rejoining it again at Hilla, from where it remains in close proximity until near the Khan Mahawil bridge, Mile 64 • 1. Here it branches left to Musaiyib and Hindiya Barrage and rejoins the road at Mufraq station. The route shown on the £-in. survey maps is not correct. River .—Shallow draft river craft between Hilla and Diwaniya. Animal .—Fair number of donkeys, horses, mules, and camels are available en route. Vehicular .—About 100 taxis are available at Hilla and Diwaniya. 5. Fuel A limited amount of desert scrub and camel thorn is obtainable in Stages 1, 2, 3, and 4. Palm logs are available in Stage 3. 6. Grazing Between Diwaniya and Iman Qasim there is rough grazing for camels, goats, and cattle near the water channels. The grazing is good for sheep, cattle, and camels between Iman Qasim and Hashimiya, and it is also good in Stage 3, where the route runs parallel to the Shatt al Hilla. There is good grazing at all seasons of the year in the neighbourhood of Hilla and there is a small amount of grazing for sheep and camels between Hilla and Mahawil. 7. Obstacles The canal at Khan Jadwal, Mile 11, ends at the western side of the railway track. If the bridge at Khan Jadwal were destroyed it would be necessary to construct a loop road across the railway just north of the canal and returning to the main road south of the canal. The destruction of the bridges in Stage 3, Mile 34-4 to Mile 51-4, would present a serious obstacle to the passage of an armed force. Several of the minor culverts would require reinforcing to ensure continuous passage of heavy transport. Loose sand between Khan an Nasiriya, Mile 70-3, and Latifiya, Mile 87, during or after a sandstorm, presents some difficulty, as the track is liable to become partly obliterated. It is advisable in summer time to complete this section of the route in the morning. The destruction of the Khirr Bridge (Mile 109-4) over the Nahr al Washshagh would be a serious obstacle, whilst the destruction of the following bridges would render the route temporarily impassable for wheeled traffic :— Nahr al Wardiya . . .. Mile 54 -3. Nahr al Jadwal (1) .. Mile 56-2. Nahr an Nil Mile 58-3. Nahr al Jadwal (2) .. Mile 58-4. Nahr al Mahawil .. Mile 64 -1. Nahr al Latifiya .. Mile 88. Nahr al Yusufiya . . .. Mile 96-1. (C23303) i 3Route Report No. 60 230 8. Camping and Landing Grounds Between Diwaniya and Hilla, selected camping sites exist at— Diwaniya. Khan Jadwal. Tall Zuna. Hashimiya. Ful details are given in stages. An excellent site suitable for a small force exists near Hilla railway station (Mile 42-8), and at Hilla a camping ground is available for a division, near the permanent landing ground, which is marked out on the right bank of the Nahr at Tahmaziya. Unlimited camping sites at Khan Mahawil (Mile 64 • 4) the best location being north of the village, where a landing ground could be marked out. Unlimited camping sites are also available at Khan al Haswa (Mile 78-8), which is situated on a sand mound in a commanding position, and at Mahmudiya (Mile 91-9). Several suitable positions for camps exist at Yusufiya, Mile 15-5. Permanent landing grounds exist at Diwaniya and Hilla. Possible landing grounds could be found where the road crosses the Nahr Bazal and at Tall Zuna. Aircraft could land at many places throughout Stages 4 to 7. 9. Co mmun ications Telegraph .—Railways and government. Telephone .—Diwaniya to Baghdad, with an exchange at Mahmudiya. Post offices at Hilla, Mahawil, and Mahmudiya. Railway. —Basra-Baghdad metre gauge railway. 10. Inhabitants The inhabitants of both Diwaniya and Hilla are, for the most part, non- tribal. The tribal areas passed through are Mujawin, Albu Nail, Khazail, and Khafaja. Between Hilla and Baghdad the route is sparingly populated ; most of the inhabitants are Shi’ah Moslems. The tribal areas passed through are Zubaia, Ma’amra, Juhaish, Mas’ud, and Jabur. 11. Rains and Floods Floods are extremely unlikely to occur on any part of the route. In Stage 2 the route passes over low ground and “ subkha,” and becomes impass able for 2 to 7 days after heavy rains. Between Hilla and Baghdad, heavy- rains between November and May may render certain sections of the route impassable to wheeled traffic for short periods. 12. Tactical In Stage 1 the route traverses a network of canals (1 ft. to 4 ft.) offering cover for defence and ambush. The hill of Tall Zuna is a commanding feature and is visible from Iman Qasim in clear weather. In Stage 2 the route again traverses a network of small canals whose banks vary in height from 1 ft. to 5 ft. These canals cross the road every two or three hundred yards. For the last 8 miles the high banks (10 ft. to 20 ft.) of the Nahr Jarbu’iya run parallel to the road on the east. In Stage 3 there are numerous used and disused canals crossed by strong brick bridges. These could be easily destroyed and would offer a serious obstacle to the passage of transport. For the last 12 miles the road runs through palm gardens fringing the river. In some places it is enclosed by high walls, and it occasionally runs along the river bank, where a convoy would be exposed to fire from the opposite bank. From Hilla to Latifiya there are many low sandy hills and old irrigation canals which command the road and provide good positions both for defence and ambush. For practical purposes all the water along the route is controlled from the Euphrates.231 Route Report No. 60 i 4 C23303) In the last four stages the country traversed by the route is, on the whole, flat. The village of Mahmudiya is situated in a commanding position and it offers possibilities for defence against a force without air or artillery support. 13. Alternative Routes (i) By Route No. 71 to Daghghara, then by Route No. 70 to Iman Qasim. (ii) An alternative route exists from Hilla to Mahmudiya, via Hindiya, Musaiyib, and Iskandariya, rejoining the main route at Mile 84-7. (iii) Diwaniya via Route No. 71 to Daghghara, thence by Route No. 69 via Imam Hamza to Hilla. (iv) By desert track from Mile 72-9 between Mahawil and Khan al Haswa to Suwaira, thence up the left bank of the River Tigris to Baghdad. At Suwaira the river is crossed by a ferry capable of transporting lorries and armoured cars. 14. Armoured Car Operations The cultivation between Hilla, Khan Mahawil, Latifiya and Baghdad renders the country in the vicinity of the route unsuitable for armoured car operations. The remaining portions of the route, however, are suitable. Stages Distance. Inter. Total. Remarks. 21-8 21-8 General direction, North. Miles. from Diwaniya to Khan Jadwal the road runs close to the railway line. Between Khan Jadwal and Tall Zuna the road passes through low-lying country mainly “ subkha,” and is liable to temporary flooding in winter. There is an extensive cultivation on both sides of the road which crosses many culverts and bridges. These offer no serious obstacles to traffic.

Hilla Town .—Hilla is the administrative headquarters of the Hilla Liwa, which comprises the qadhas of Hashimiya, Hindiya, and Musaiyib. It is situated on both banks of the Shatt al Hilla, the major portion being ort the right bank, and is surrounded by extensive date gardens. The population is 20,000 (approximately), and it has a bazaar of some 1,000 shops and a large number of grain storage khans. The town is lit by electric light, supplied from the municipal power station. It possesses a civil hospital and several government and private schools. Good postal, telegraph and telephone services operate in the town. The police barracks (reconstructed 1930) are large and capable of accommodating armoured cars. The Liwa police total 200, and of these 50 foot and 30 mounted are stationed in Hilla. A recruiting depot of the ’Iraq Army is situated in the barracks near the railway station, which is 1£ miles N.N.E. of the town. There are side and end loading ramps at the railway station. (2) Water .—Permanent and unlimited supply from the Shatt al Hilla, subject to control at Hindiya Barrage. There are two high level water tanks, each of 6,400 gallons capacity, in the railway station. (3) Supplies .—Hilla is the largest and most important grain centre in the middle Euphrates area. Large storage khans exist on the left bank of the Shatt al Hilla and also in the bazaars. Grain is transported both by rail and river craft to Baghdad, Basra, and other ’Iraqi trade centres. Grain supplies up to 10,000 tons are often held in storage pending a rise in prices, and an average supply of 500 tons, wheat and barley (mostly barley), can be relied upon through the year. Rice is not much dealt with by the Hilla merchants. Good supplies of meat and vegetables are obtainable in the bazaars, which extend to both sides of the river. Supplies are not available anywhere else in this stage.Route Report No. 60 234 (4) Transport. —(a) Railway between Baghdad-Hilla.

Authority :—Air Staff Intelligence, ’Iraq. Date :—1935 Map Reference :—| in. ’Iraq Survey 2 C/SW, 2 D/NW, 138 P/NE, 1. General This is the direct route from Baghdad to the Holy City of Karbala. It is passable for all arms during the summer months, but is suitable for light cars only for considerable periods after rain. The route leaves Baghdad by the iron bridge over the Nahr Washshash and proceeds in a southerly direction. It is well defined. The capacity of the pontoon bridge across the River Euphrates at Musaiyib is limited to 1-ton lorries. In emergency, armoured cars could cross in safety. All other bridges and culverts on the route are of strong construction. In summer, soft sand on the descent of the cliff to the Haur abu Dibs (138 P/NE.29d.5.1) is difficult for heavy transport to negotiate. Plentiful at stages, provided control heads on River Euphrates and Hussainiya are held. In Stage 2, there is no water between the Latifiya canal and the end of the stage at Nahr Iskandariya. Between Karbala and Shithatha, water is only available from the Haur abu Dibs and in summer may be brackish. The degree to which this water becomes brackish depends on the floods of the Euphrates during the previous spring. 3. Supplies In normal times, considerable quantities of grain (from Musaiyib and Karbala) and sheep (from the local tribes) could be obtained. Sheep might be scarce in winter when they graze in the Shamiya desert. As the route, as far as Karbala, follows the general course of the Baghdad-Karbala railway, it would be possible to arrange for supplies from Baghdad. For the last two stages, main supplies would be from Karbala. Lucerne is grown in moderate quantities near the villages, between January and May. There is little scrub available on this route between Baghdad and Karbala, but it is plentiful throughout the last two stages. Palm logs are plentiful in the Musaiyib, Karbala and Shithatha districts. Oil depots at Mahmudiya, Musaiyib and Karbala. 4 I 138 P/NW. 4. Fuel239 Route Report No. 61 5. Transport (i) —The Nahr Hussainiya is navigable for small native boats. There is no lock at the irrigation head and only a few craft ply for hire on the river. (ii) Animals. —A number of donkeys are available in villages on the route, and with previous notice a large number of camels could be obtained. (iii) Vehicular. —The main taxi route from Baghdad to Karbala. For the numbers of vehicles obtainable, see the details in stages. In January, 1936, the following motor vehicles were registered in the Liwas of Baghdad and Karbala :— Baghdad .. . . 1,592 cars 676 lorries. Karbala .. .. 173 cars 43 lorries. Baghdad would therefore be the major source of supply. (iv) Railways. —Stations at:— Mahmudiya (main Basra line). Imam Aun ibn Ali (Karbala branch). Iskandariya ,, ,, ,, (Khan al Atashi) ,, ,, Musaiyib ,, ,, ,, Karbala ,, ,, 6. Grazing Camel grazing is scarce between Baghdad and Karbala, but is plentiful between Karbala and Shithatha. After winter rains, grazing for sheep may be available near Stages 3 and 4. Flocks graze until August in the vicinity of the Haur abu Dibs. (Grazing for horses is available in the gardens of Shithatha. 7. Obstacles (i) Bridges. —The destruction of the pontoon bridge at Musaiyib would block the route. Any particular minor bridge or culvert could be made passable with palm logs or brush wood after one day’s work, but the systematic destruction of all or most of the numerous crossings would form a serious obstacle. The destruction of the log bridges across the water cuts at Shithatha would delay an advancing column of troops or motor transport. (ii) Subkha. —Parts of the route are covered with saline deposit (“ subkha ”), which forms the most serious obstacle on route. (See under Rains and Floods). (iii) Soft Sand. —In the numerous wadis traversed and at the cliff descent at the Haur abu Dibs, soft sand causes some difficulty to the movements of armoured cars. 8. Camping and Landing Grounds Details in Stages. There are many, good, intermediate camping and landing grounds on Stages 2 and 4, Stages 3 and 5 being not so suited. In Stages 6 and 7, sites are limited by water available. Soft sand in summer, areas liable to be waterlogged after rain, and scrub, form only minor difficulties in the selection of landing grounds. According to the season, suitable landing grounds could be selected near to camping grounds. 9. Communications (a) Rail. —The railway track (see para. 5) is not shown on the existing maps. The main Baghdad-Basra line runs from a point 2 D/NW.5c.9.3 to Iskandariya, Musaiyib and Hindiya Barrage (Junction) and rejoins the original track at Khan Mahawil.

Tactical (а) The open nature of the country traversed in Stages 1-4 offers few tactical features. At intervals the high banks (up to 12 ft.) of ancient and modern canals cross the route and form natural fire positions. (б) Iskandariya is situated among canals and mounds which form natural defences. (c) The entrance to Musaiyib and Karbala (throughout Stage 5) is through palm groves. The groves in Stage 5 are thick and the undergrowth particularly dense. (c?) At Mile 74-5 the road descends the cliff at the edge of the Karbala plateau by a loose sandy track. The route here is commanded by rifle fire from the hills and vehicles are liable to be bogged in the sand. The route enters a “ bottle-neck ” and then the defile at the south-east end of the Haur abu Dibs with the water on the right and the hills on the left and finally leaves it at Mile 79-5 with the hills some 2 miles on the left. (e) At Mile 98 the route, for 1 mile, passes through small cliff formations, some 50 ft. high, offering good defensive or ambush positions. 1 1. Rains and Floods The surface of the route from Stages 2-5 (inclusive) consists largely of subkha (salt-impregnated soil). In winter, after heavy rain, the route would be out of action for all motor vehicles except light cars for periods of from one to two weeks. Of all the main roads in this area, the bunded road in Stage 3 is one of the most difficult to pass after rain. A large area on the south of the Haur abu Dibs is impassable for heavy transport after rain. An alternative track for light cars could be found to the south of this area, but this alternative track crosses the Wadi Ubaiyidh, which is liable to flood during the wet season. 12. Inhabitants The inhabitants of the area traversed are mainly of the Shi’ah sect. They are cultivators and sheep breeders. The fertile gardens and palm groves on the banks of the Nahr Hussainiya, in the Karbala area, are owned by the wealthy landlords and merchants of the Holy City. The Karbala gardens are famous throughout ’Iraq. The cultivation is largely supervised by Iranians. The following tribal areas are passed from Mahmudiya to Karbala :— Ghurair. Juhaish. Janabiyin. Mas’ud. 13. Climate The sub-tropical climate common to Southern ’Iraq.241 Route Report No. 61 14. Alternative Routes (a) Mahmudiya-Hilla (Route 60, Stages 2, 3 and 4), thence to Tuwairij and Karbala (Route No. 65) or Musaiyib—Tuwairij direct by a bunded track on the left bank of the river Euphrates, and thence to Karbala (Route No. 65.)

The only centre on the Euphrates between Falluja and Tuwairij, it consists of approximately 700 houses and 300 shops situated on both banks of the river, the larger portion of the buildings being on the right bank. Musaiyib is the Administrative Headquarters of a qadha in the Hilla Liwa. The Government offices and police barracks are in the sarai on the right bank. The sarai, of Turkish origin, is noted for its spacious courtyard, which is of greater area than that of any other sarai or police barracks in the middle Euphrates area. The courtyard could accommodate 24 or more armoured cars. The sarai is a rectangular structure, three of its sides are formed by low buildings of one story, whilst the fourth on north-east side facing the river is two storied. The whole is surrounded by thick palm groves and is not well suited for defence. (ii) Water. —Unlimited supply from river Euphrates. (iii) Supplies. —There are 10 khans and 4 grain stores in the town. After the harvest, large stores of grain are available, but these decrease rapidly if there is any demand in Basra for export grain. Estimated yearly produce of the qadha— Wheat, 1,000 tons. Barley, 4,000 tons. Dates, 1,800 Rice, 400 tons. Miscellaneous, such as maize-simsim, 130 tons.

Probably the best site for camping, near the town, is at Mile 48-5 (2 D/NW.16b.2.2) between the courses of the two old irrigation canals. (vii) Alternative Route. —From Musaiyib, a road runs due east from the railway station, through cultivation for some eight miles, when it connects with the main Baghdad-Hilla road between Khan Haswa and Khan Mahawil (Route No. 60, Part 1, Stage 3, Mile 43-5).

General The route may be considered, for the purposes of this report, to begin at its bifurcation from the Karbala—Najaf desert road, a point about 200 yards south of the Karbala railway station. After crossing the railway line, the road proceeds in a south-west by westerly direction. This general direction it maintains throughout its course. For the first 9 miles, it runs over hard sandy desert, with occasional soft patches, for the avoidance of which care is necessary. At Mile 9 the only serious obstacle on the route is encountered, when it runs over the edge of the Abu Dibs escarpment. At this point and for the course of a mile (i.e. between Miles 9 and 10) the surface is heavy sand. At Mile 10 the sand ceases and is succeeded by an excellent surface. At Mile 20, the Ukhaidhir road branches left from the Shithatha road and continues till Ukhaidhir is passed about 1,000 yards on the left (Mile 33). At Mile 40, a faintly marked track from Ukhaidhir to Shithatha crosses the road. From here onwards the route lies over flat, and for the most part featureless, desert, until Nukhaib is reached at Mile 122. Its suiface is generally excellent and it is easy to follow. Short stony stretches are, however, occasionally met with, the worst being between Miles 99 and 101.

Stages : —2. Authority : —Air Staff (Intelligence), ’Iraq. Date : —1st July, 1934. Map References : —|-in. Iraq Surveys 2 D/NW and 2 D/SW. Epitome 1. General The Hilla-Karbala route, via Tuwairij, runs over a well-graded road of modern construction. Irrigation ditches, water channels, etc., are well bridged, and the route is passable throughout for a force of all arms. Some sections of the route between Tuwairij and Karbala are raised above flood level. The pontoon bridge, spanning the Hindiya branch of the River Euphrates at Tuwairij, will take a loaded 1-ton lorry (gross weight 3 tons). It cannot be crossed by armoured cars. Portions of the road between Hilla and Tuwairij have fallen into a state of disrepair and vegetation has encroached on the track. The surface of the road between Tuwairij and a small village (Qariyat Sulaimania) to the right of the track is bad in many places. 2. Water Unlimited supply from the Hilla branch of the Euphrates at Hilla, from the Hindiya branch at Tuwairij, and from the Hussainiya Canal at Karbala. 3. Supplies Obtainable at Hilla, Tuwairij, and at Karbala. Large stocks of grain are normally obtainable in these towns. Tuwairij is a storage centre for the rice grown in the middle Euphrates area. At Hilla and Karbala stocks of dates are available. During the summer months the tribal herds of sheep are grazing in the area traversed by the route. In the winter these flocks move to the desert for grazing and the supply of sheep available would then be small unless previous arrangements were made with the tribes. Details in stages. 4. Transport Rail. —The Karbala branch of the Baghdad-Basra Railway (metre gauge) joins the main line at Hindiya Junction. A service of light motor trucks runs daily between Hilla and Karbala. Motor. —About 100 commercial vehicles are available for hire in both Hilla and Karbala. Pack Transport. —The number of donkeys available for transport varies, but it is thought that about 400 could be collected within a few days under normal circumstances. Camels are scarce and could not be relied on for transport without previous notice.Route Report No. 65 250 5. Fuel Date palm logs and camel thorn plentiful throughout the route. 6. Grazing 1 he area is mainly cultivated and not suitable, except for standing crops or stubble after the harvest. Sheep are concentrated in the area during the summer. 7. Obstacles Route can be rendered impassable by the destruction of the pontoon bridge over the Euphrates at Tuwairij or the destruction of the bridge over the Nahr Bani Hasan (2 D/NW.33a,8.6).. 8. Additional work Nil. All irrigation bridges are modern and strong. 9. Landing and Camping Grounds R.A.F. landing grounds, with standard markings in juss and whitewash, exist at Hilla and Karbala. The country in the vicinity of Tuwairij is cut by irrigation channels and would require considerable labour to render it suitable for use by aircraft. Camping grounds exist at Hilla and Tuwairij and are detailed in stages. 10. Communications Telegraph and telephone facilities exist at Hilla, Tuwairij, and Karbala. 11. Rains and Floods The district between Tuwairij and Karbala is liable to flood. In normal seasons the route would probably remain passable, save for short periods after rain, throughout the year. 12. Inhabitants The inhabitants are tribal cultivators of the Bani Turuf, Bani Hasan, Fatla, and Yasir. 13. Tactical The high mound of Bir Nimrud (2 D/SW. 1 la.2.3) forms a conspicuous landmark to the south and is visible throughout the major portion of the route. The road leaves Hilla and crosses over a continuous system of old and new irrigation canals which practically surround and form a strong natural defence to the town. At Qariyat Abbas (2 D/NW.35d.7.2) the road crosses an old double canal with triple 10-ft. banks. The western channel contains water. The remaining tactical features of Stage 1 are— (i) The old canal bed at point 2 D/NW.35d.3.3. (ii) A police post and houses under construction at point 2 D/NW.35c.5.7. (iii) A small water channel with 5-ft. banks, crossed at point 2 D/NW. 34d.9.9. (iv) A group of old kilns 10-15 ft. high command the road at point 2 D/NW.33b.8.1. (v) The Nahr Jadwal crossed at point 2 D/NW.33b.6.1. Stage 2.—On leaving Tuwairij, high bunds command the road on the left and run parallel with it until the brick bridge which spans the Nahr Bani Hasan at point 2 D/NW.33a.8.6. After crossing this bridge the road runs251 I SO Route Report No. 65 through flat, cultivated land, liable to flood, and is devoid of any tactical features until it enters Karbala through date gardens east of the town.

All irrigation channels are spanned by strong masonry bridges in good con dition. Except for a few sections, where there are deep ruts caused by the passage of vehicles along the route during the winter rains, the surface is good. There are a few patches of “ subkha ” (saline surface) between Hilla and Tuwairij and, after heavy rains, the road may become impassable, except for light cars, for a period of from three to five days. The road leaves Hilla, passing through palm groves parallel with the Shatt al Hilla. Road crosses deep canal, spanned by strong masonry bridge. (Sign post—right to Hindiya Barrage.) Police post on left of road and houses under construction. Extensive cultivation on both sides of the road. The road crosses the River Jarjiya, over a strong bridge. The road enters Tuwairij by the pontoon bridge, over the Hindiya branch of the Euphrates. Tuwairij .—A small town of some 10,000 inhabitants, situated on the right bank of the Hindiya branch of the River Euphrates. A well-stocked bazaar of approximately 400 shops is situated in the southern portion of the town. The police barracks is a well-built structure on the left of the road entering the town from Hilla and is capable of accommodating armoured cars.

No. of Stages : —4. Authority: —Air Staff (Intelligence), ’Iraq. Date: —30th July, 1934. Map References £ in. ’Iraq Surveys 2 D/NW., 2 D/SW., 3 A/NW. Epitome 1. General The route traversed is that used by the pilgrims and motor traffic between Karbala and Najaf. It is a well defined track over slightly undulating desert with little grass or scrub. East of the track is irrigated land, under cultivation, but to the west, all cultivation ceases. The country to the east is low-lying and liable to flood during the winter months. The route is passable for a force of all arms and heavy mechanical transport during the summer months. A regular service of motor omnibuses ply between the Holy Cities. The multiplicity of tracks is, at times, somewhat confusing, but the majority of them will be found to converge at the larger khans en route. Armoured cars could only be handled with difficulty owing to the numerous patches of soft and drift sand, but, by breaking fresh ground some five miles to the west, an easier passage might be found. During and after heavy rain, certain sections of the route would be impassable for wheeled traffic, for periods up to three days. 2. Water Permanent water is obtainable from the Nahr Hinaidiya and subsidiary channels, which run from 1 to 5 miles east of the route traversed. Well-water of doubtful quality and quantity is obtainable from :— (a) Khan Nukhaila (2 D/SW.2b.8.3) 1 well (water brackish). (b) Khan Hammad (2 D/SW.16a.6.6), 4 wells. (c) Khan Musalla (2 D/SW.29a.l.3), 2 wells. 3. Supplies Between Karbala and Najaf no supplies are obtainable. The khans contain limited supplies of native produce for small caravans passing through. Their trade, however, is negligible owing to the rapid increase in the use of mechanical transport. Supplies at Karbala and Najaf are dealt with in stages. 4. Transport 100-150 miscellaneous motor vehicles are usually available at Karbala and Najaf. Some 2,000-3,000 pack animals may be hired in both towns.255 Route Report No. 66 5. Fuel Date-palm logs are obtainable in large quantities at Karbala and in varying small quantities at Khan Hammad and Najaf. Desert scrub is generally plentiful throughout the route. 6. Grazing Plentiful for goats and camels throughout the year. When flood water subsides, good grazing for horses and cattle exists from 1 to 2 miles west of the Hinaidiya Canal. Desert grazing in winter and spring. 7. Obstacles Nil. 8. Landing and Camping Grounds Generally speaking, the khans, though large and affording adequate cover for troops on the march, are too insanitary for military requirements. The water in the various wells is brackish and contaminated by sewage. It is, therefore, advisable for camping grounds to be selected in the vicinity of the Nahr Hinaidiya. Aeroplanes can land almost anywhere, 1 or 2 miles west of the route. 9. Co mmuni cations (a) Government telegraph and telephone at Karbala and Najaf. (b) Road. —From Karbala the following routes are passable for all arms :— Karbala-Tuwairij-Hilla. Karbala-Musaiyib. Karbala-Hindiya-Barrage. Also desert routes to the west. From Najaf the following routes are passable :— Najaf-Kufa. Na.jaf-Abu Sukhair-Diwaniya. 10. Inhabitants The road is through desert and the settled population of the khans is negligible. Sections of the Dahamsha (Anaiza) may be grazing near the river during the summer months, whilst, in the winter and spring, sheep-herders from the settled tribes on the cultivated area east of the river, range far out to the west with their flocks. They return to the river for summer grazing. 11. Rain and Floods Tracks east of the Nahr Chari Sa’adah are liable to flood, but the higher ground to the west remains passable at all seasons. 12. Tactical The only positions of any tactical importance are :— (а) Khan Nukhaila (2 D/SW.2b.8.3), lying amidst undulating sandhills close to the Nahr Hinaidiya, forms a strong defensive position against an attack from the west. (б) The walled village of Khan Musalla (2 D/SW.29a.0.3) lies in a commanding position and the walls are proof against rifle fire. (c) At Abu Fush’aiqa (2 D/SW.29c.5.6) where a cluster of sandhills and ruins near the river, offer possibilities for a defensive position. (d) At 2 D/SW.35a.7.9 an old canal with 8 ft. banks joins the Nahr Chari Sa’ada on the west. A few small towers, ruined, but still defensible against rifle fire, are situated at this junction.Route Report No. 66 256 No. of Distance. Stage. Name. Inter. Total. Remarks. 1 Khan Nukhaila .. 12 12 General direction, S.E. The road leaves Karbala from the south, on a high bund across Nahr al Hinaidiya, and turns sharply to the left near the old i urkish hospital (now used as a police post). It then crosses the Hinaidiya canal over a strong brick bridge (passable for heavy lorries) and finally leaves the town from the south-east, through a large graveyard. After leaving the town, many tracks branch off from the main track and the ground to the west, being slightly higher, is better going for wheeled traffic. The road runs across flat, sandy desert bordered on the east by the Hinaidiya canal and cultivated land and enters Khan Nukhaila. (i) Water .—Well water at Khan Nukhaila unfit for human con sumption. Unlimited supplies from Hinaidiya canal, half mile east of the village. (ii) Supplies .—Advance arrangements with the authorities at Karbala essential. Local supplies for pilgrim traffic only at Khan Nukhaila ; rapidly decreasing. „ (iii) Camping Grounds .—In the vicinity of Hinaidiya canal.

The country is open desert, devoid of any features of tactical or other importance. The bifurcations in the route (2 D/SW.9b.7.0 and 10c.2.2) cannot be regarded as permanent, as traffic between the Holy Cities cuts a continuous series of new routes when the old tracks break up and become too soft for wheels. 12 - 5- Patches of soft sand, avoided by detours to the east and west of 17 the track. 21 Good camping ground between stages ; permanent and unlimited water from Hinaidiya canal.

This is the largest and most populated khan on the Karbala-Najaf ro ote, wi accommodation for some 2,000 men and 500 horses. The an itself is in a fair state of repair and the village totals some 85 inhabitants. There is a small bazaar of 20 shops, from which local supplies may be purchased. A police post is established in the village. (i) Water. —Four wells at Khan Hammad ; water drinkable, liable to contamination. Unlimited water from the Shatt al M jar, 1 mile to the east of the village. (ii) Supplies. —Small local supplies at Khan Hammad; advance arrangements with authorities at Najaf, Kufa or Karbala essentia .

It stands on a ridge of reddish sandstone and gravel, and overlooks, from the north-east, the Bahr or Sea of Najaf. There is low country to the south-west. The town is surrounded by a wall built about a century ago to defend it from the attacks of the Wahhabis. This work is now in a state of decay. There are two main gateways on the eastern face of the town ; of these, the larger is the Bab al Hussain, and the other the Bab al Kufa. On the south-west side is a third gate called Bab Murad. In the western wall is an aperture known as Thilmak which has no gate, but is large enough to afford a passage for field artillery and other vehicles. At the north-east corner of the town is a gate known as the Bab. The principal building in Najaf is the shrine which contains the tomb of 'Ali. The main bazaar runs from the shrine to the large east gate, where are situated the municipal offices. The sarai and police barracks, the latter a modern building capable of accommodating armoured cars or two companies of infantry, are located outside the town near the tram terminus. The total population of the town is in the neighbourhood of 40,000 and it contains some 4,750 houses, 1,200 shops, 70 khans (large and small), and 17 storehouses for grain and merchandise. Many of the private houses have extremely deep “ serdabs ” (underground cellars), in some cases connected with the walls outside the town by passages. Owing to the tortuous character of its innumerable alley-ways, the town is not suitable for military occupation, nor could suitable billets be obtained therein. (i) Water .—Until 1928, Najaf was dependent for its water supply on a pumping plant at Abu Sukhair ; water was conveyed in an open channel on the western side of the ridge and taken into the city by manual labour. A pumping plant and filtration tanks have now been installed at Kufa and water is conveyed by under ground pipes to the Najaf storage tanks. There are also a number of deep wells within the town, but the water is brackish and unsafe. (ii) Supplies .—No local produce, but fair stocks are held. Estimated lowest stocks in spring : 150 tons of wheat, 400 tons of barley, 2,000 tons of rice. Fresh vegetables and meat from external sources (Kufa and Abu Sukhair) according to demand. Local supplies sufficient for 1 battalion for 10 days without affecting the local market. (iii) Landing and Camping Grounds .—Unlimited camping grounds round the city, but no water supply other than the piped supply referred to above. Kufa, 6 miles to the east, affords better facilities. There is no marked landing ground at Najaf. A suit able site exists about 1 mile from the city to the south of the Najaf-Abu Sukhair telegraph line (3 A/NW.5a.0.7). There is a R.A.F. landing ground with standard markings in juss and whitewash near Kufa at 2 D/SW.35c.9.8, 4| miles from Najaf. Note.—Alternative Route .—There are many tracks from Khan Hammad and Khan Musalla which lead to Najaf direct. These are very good motor tracks in the winter, but during the summer months the going is difficult on account of loose sand. In winter, for a Service convoy, the quickest route from Karbala to Najaf would be on a compass course ; the surface of the desert is flat and firm enough to permit this route.259 ROUTE REPORT No. 68 HILLA to NAJAF via AL KIFL and KUFA Total Distance : —42-3 miles. No of Stages : —3. Authority :—Air Staff (Intelligence), ’Iraq. Date : —30th April, 1934. Map References :—\ in. ’Iraq Surveys, 2 D/SW, 2 D/NW. Epitome 1. General A well defined, main road, passable throughout for a force of all arms, including armoured cars. The route is not liable to flood under normal circumstances but would be very heavy going, periodically, during the winter months. 2. Water Permanent and unlimited supply available in Stage 1 from subsidiary channels of the Shatt al Hilla and Shatt al Hindiya, all of which are subject to control from the Hindiya Barrage. In Stage 2, from the Shatt Abu Shaura, in unlimited quantities. In Stage 3, from the Euphrates western channel at Kufa. At Najaf, the main water supply is pumped from Kufa ; wells of considerable depth also exist in the town itself, but the water therein is slightly brackish and contaminated. 3. Supplies Cereals, meat and fodder are available in large quantities at Hilla, Najaf and Kufa. Supplies fluctuate according to season and local requirements ; Najaf acts as a supply centre for many of the desert tribes ; Hilla is usually drawn on, as a supply base, by other towns in the Middle Euphrates area. In normal times, no difficulty should be experienced in obtaining meat, cereals, fodder, etc., sufficient for the requirements of a division, provided 48 hours’ notice is given to the local authorities. A moderate supply of fresh vegetables is available throughout the area. 4. Transport Local river craft, up to 60 tons burthen, are available at Hilla and Kufa river craft is largely employed by local merchants for the transport of grain and other produce. Detail in stages. At Najaf, a number of small ponies and donkeys are available and could be utilised as pack animals. Motor vehicles registered in the Hilla and Karbala Li was in January, 1936, were :— Hilla—160 cars ; 26 lorries. Karbala—173 cars ; 43 lorries. (C 23303) K 2■ Route Report No. 08 260 5. Fuel Camel thorn, scrub, etc., plentiful, the root of the camel thorn yielding tough logs of 2 to 3 inches diameter. Between Al Kill and Kufa, palm logs could be requisitioned in unlimited quantities. 6. Grazing Plentiful for camels, sheep and goats in Stages 1, 2 and 3. Between Kufa and Najaf there is none. Except for small quantities in the vicinity of water channels, there is no grazing for horses. 7. Obstacles The destruction of the pontoon bridges at Muchatim (2 D/SW.29b.l.5) or Kufa (2 D/SW.35d.9.8) would render the route impassable. 8. Additional work No additional work required. 9. Landing and Camping Grounds Numerous intermediate camping grounds exist in Stages 1 and 2. These are not enumerated in the report as the selected stages do not exceed 18 miles. Generally speaking, the area between Hilla and Kufa is too highly cultivated to allow of emergency landing grounds. Aircraft could be landed almost anywhere in the desert south and south-east of Najaf. 10. Communications Telegraph and telephone are available at Hilla, Al Kill, Kufa, and Najaf. The Hilla-Al Kifl light railway, shown on maps, no longer exists. By road from Kufa to Karbala, Najaf, Abu Sukhair, and Sulaichiya. By road from Al Kifl to Sulaichiya; and to Tuwairij direct, on the left bank of the Shatt al Hindiya. The capacity of this latter route is uncertain, but it is at least fit for the passage of light cars. 11. Inhabitants The majority of the inhabitants are Shi’ah Muslims although a few of the Sunni sect are to be found in the towns. There is a fair-sized Jewish colony in al Kifl and another in Hilla. The tribesmen are for the most part cultivators, although there are a large number of sheep herders in the Bani Hasan, Khaza’il, and other tribes who migrate to the desert west and south-west of the Najaf-Karbala road during the winter months. The townsmen of Karbala and Najaf are traders and landowners in the district, but the prosperity of these towns depends largely on the influx of pilgrims to the shrines. There is a considerable population of Iranian origin in both towns, the larger number being in Najaf. The people in these towns are inclined to be fanatical, but are unlikely to be openly hostile unless disturbed by some powerful influence. 12. Climate Normal conditions prevalent in the Middle Euphrates area. 13. Tactical The town of Hilla is surrounded on the west side of the Shatt al Hilla by a series, almost semicircular, of irrigation channels and old canals with high banks, forming natural defences of great strength. Once this system, extending approximately 1£ miles south-west of the town has been passed, the country, save for minor irrigation channels which cross the road, is featureless up to Mile 13-5.261 Route Report No. 68 k 3 (C 23303) The Nahr Rustumiya, crossed at the above points, is a double channel enclosing a belt of rough ground some 250 yards in breadth. It forms a good defensive position across the road, but could be outflanked from the east or west. Between the road junction at Mile 17-9 (2 D/SW.23b.5.7) and the bridge at Muchatim, the terrain on both sides of the road, including the town of A1 Kill, offers innumerable facilities for defensive action against an attack from any direction. High-banked canals intersect this area and there are numerous palm groves with occasional ruined buildings and mounds. Between Muchatim and Kufa, the ground is featureless with numerous palm groves and insignificant water channels. The town of A1 Kufa (2 D/SW.35d.8.9) is naturally defensible on the west bank of the river. The line of the old Nahr Chari Sa’adah (north-west and west of the town) and the mounds of old Kufa to the south-west form a strong natural rampart. From Kufa the desert rises gradually to Najaf, situated in a commanding position and overlooking the surrounding country. The town itself is commanded from high mounds to the west and south-west. Important landmarks en route are the mound of Birs Nimrud (2 D/SW.l la.2.4) and the minaret at A1 Kifl. The ruined tower of Birs Nimrud, once thought to be the original tower of Babel, is an important landmark throughout the whole route Hilla-Najaf. It is visible for many miles on each section of the route and would form an excellent base for visual signals. 14. Rains and Floods In common with all roads in this part of ’Iraq, this route is liable to present difficulty after heavy rain, owing to patches of saline surface which hold water for some days and make progress for heavy transport or armoured cars almost impossible. It is probable that it would be impassable for a period of from 3 to 5 days after heavy rain. The recently constructed section between A1 Kifl and Muchatim is liable to flood in years of exceptionally high flood in the River Euphrates. The old route, avoiding A1 Kifl, might be used as an alternative. 15. Alternative Routes Hilla to Kufa and Najaf via Diwaniya and Abu Sukhair. A route, the capacity of which is uncertain, but which is at least fit for the passage of light cars, exists between A1 Kifl and Tuwairij on the left bank of the Shatt al Hindiya, which may be used if the direct road between Al Kifl and Hilla is obstructed. There is also a route, fit for the passage of light cars only, which leaves the Al Kifl-Sulaichiya branch road about a mile after the latter bifurcates from the road under report (Mile 18-8) and which runs to Hilla via the village of Sughayir at Trad of the Khafaja, joining Route No. 68 about 4 miles south of Hilla town.

The town is situated on the right bank of the river Euphrates ; has a population of 7,000 people with 1,250 houses and 1,000 shops. Large quantities of grain are held in the grain store along the right bank of the river.Route Report No. 68 264 The sarai and police barracks (renovated 1929) are situated at the northern extremity of the houses lining the river embankment. It has a courtyard which would accommodate 2 companies of infantry or 6 armoured cars, but at present the gateway is not large enough to allow the passage of cars. The banks of the river are connected by a well-built boat bridge of 120 yards span and an 8-ft. track, supported upon 28 native boats. Carrying capacity is estimated at 30 cwts. Average depth of water at low water level is 5 ft. ; navigable for river craft up to 60 tons burthen. (i) Water .—Unlimited in the river. A pumping plant and pipe-line supplies the Holy City of Najaf. (ii) Supplies .—A large supply of grain (approximately 1,000 tons) is always available. 200 head of sheep could be provided daily by arrangement. Normal supply of dates available, approximately 300 tons. (iii) Camping and Landing Grounds .—Available left bank of river and behind town 1£ miles to the south.

Authority :—Air Staff (Intelligence), 'Iraq. Date : —December, 1933. Map References :—1 : 1,000,000 Basra—V.2634 Samawa. 1 : 1,000,000 Basra—V. 1618 A1 ’Umaiyid. 1 : 1,000,000 Basra—E.5846 As Sulman. (gridded) Epitome 1. General The route is the main line of communication, with the Headquarters of the Southern Desert Police at As Sulman. With the exception of the first 11 miles, where it is crossed at frequent intervals by camel and donkey tracks, the route is very well defined. Numerous culverts between Samawa and Mile 6-6 are all of concrete and are in an excellent state of repair. The route is passable for all arms, including heavy mechanical transport, except after rain. 2. Water Water of a brackish nature is obtainable at Khannaq, Mile 11-0, where the route passes within a few yards of the Shatt al Atshan, a fork of the Hindiya branch of the Euphrates. The only other permanent water supply on the route is at Al ’Umaiyid, where a well 8-10 ft. deep yields approximately 200-300 gallons per day of slightly brackish water. After heavy rains, water is to be found in rain-pools at Rigla ash Shaikh and Abu Khuwaima ; the latter is about 4 miles from the track. There is unlimited water at As Sulman but it is slightly bitter and contains a consider able proportion of Glauber’s (Epsom) Salts. The inevitable effect of such water on personnel unaccustomed to drinking it, should be borne in mind. 3. Supplies There are no towns or villages between Samawa and As Sulman, and no supplies are obtainable en route. 4. Fuel Scrub is plentiful as far as Al ’Umaiyid, Mile 26-6, but beyond it ia extremely sparse. 5. Transport None obtainable en route. 6. Grazing See para. 4 above.Route Report No. 78 266 7. Obstacles There are no natural obstacles apart from the salt marsh dealt with in para 13 below. The rocky area between Mile 71-0 and As Sulman requires careful driving if damaged tyres and sumps are to be avoided. The only means of blocking the road would be the destruction of the culverts referred to in para. 1 above, but as the irrigation channels served by t ese culverts are now in a state of disuse, the damage could easily and quickly be repaired by filling in. 8. Additional Work It has been observed that where the salt marsh comes into contact with the sand belt, the mixture of salt soil and sand forms an excellent surface in all weather conditions. By dressing the road with sand, of which there are unlimited quantities close at hand, the salt marsh could be made passable at all times. (See para. 13 below.) 9. Camping and Landing Grounds There are no suitable sites for camps or landing grounds between Samawa and A1 ’Umaiyid. The salt soil offers no purchase for tent pegs and a column caught there by rain might be held up for some time. There are numerous excellent sites for camps and landing grounds on the mud-flats between Mile 43‘0 and Mile 63’O. dhe remainder of the country is unsuitable owing to its rocky nature. 10. Communications Supplies could be sent by river craft to Mile 11-0. There is no other communication with the route until Mile 87-0, the junction of the Busaiya 11. Climate Normal for southern 'Iraq. Sandstorms of great severity are frequently experienced on that part of the track which passes through a gap in the sand belt between Mile S'O and 22-0. Rain occurs between the months of November and March. River floods have closed the route on two occasions during the last five years—May-June, 1929, and May, 1931. 12. Tactical At Mile 11-0, the route passes through a narrow gap between a spur of the sand belt and the Shatt al Atshan. This offers an ideal position for ambush in both directions. Ihe steep banks of the river afford a natural breastwork and snipers among the numerous mounds and folds of the sand dunes would be safe from pursuit by armoured cars or cavalry. Ihe mounds south of Al ’Umaiyis are within rifle-shot of the well and offer an excellent position for a hostile force. The only entrance to the As Sulman depression on the northern side is a winding, rocky, gradual descent of 200 ft. It is essential that all these three points be occupied by picquets to ensure the safety of a column advancing. At the same time, they are excellent rearguard positions for forces retreating along the route. 13. Rains and Floods brom Samawa to Al ’Umaiyid, the country traversed consists of “ subkha ” (salt soil) which after rain, becomes impassable for wheels for periods ranging from one to three weeks. An alternative route runs across the sand belt in a direct line from Samawa to Al ’Umaiyid, but this can only be considered as an emergency route for267 Route Report No. 78 light transport, the soft sand being impassable except after rain. Even then, it only avoids the area affected by river floods, leaving 5 miles of salt marsh still to be crossed. 14. Inhabitants With the exception of a few mud huts at Mile 6 • 6, the route passes through country inhabited only by nomadic tribes. The route runs parallel to the Darb As Sulman, a main caravan track to Central Arabia. Bedouin caravans from Najd are frequently encountered, but are invariably friendly. 15. Alternative Routes The only alternative routes are as follows :— (а) Samawa-Ur Junction-Busaiya-As Sulman. (б) Samawa-Diwaniyah-Shabicha-As Sulman. Detailed Report Note (a ).—The route has not been divided up into marching stages. There are no town or villages to mark such stages and the distances of daily marches must vary greatly according to— (i) The formation of the column. (ii) The time of the year. (iii) The state of the weather. The track crosses the railway line at Samawa and runs slightly south of west through an area of salt soil, invariably very uneven as the result of the passage of camels and donkeys when the ground is soft after rain.

General This is the main route from Nasiriya to Kut al Imara. It is, for the most part, mechanically graded to a width of 40 feet ; has a good natural surface, is well bridged and is suitable at all seasons for the passage of all arms, including heavy mechanical transport. The road leaves Nasiriya on the west side of the town and striking northward, traverses that area irrigated by the upper reaches of the Shatra branch of the Gharraf, until Suwaij (Mile 19), when it reaches the main stream and deflects slightly westward. Between Suwaij and Shatra (Mile 28) the road runs on either bank of the river, the road on the north-east bank being the better surface. The use of the north-east bank road, however, necessitates the crossing of this river at Suwaij and the re-crossing of it at Shatra. As the bridges at these two points are not fit to carry more than two tons, the use of the north-east bank is denied to heavy transport. Leaving Shatra the road continues to follow the river bed until reaching Bada (3 I/SW.3c.2.7. Not marked on map) where the Shatra branch joins the Gharraf. It then turns sharp left. Up to this point, only portions of the road have been improved by grader, the surface being naturally good. From Bada onwards, however, throughout the whole remaining length, the work of grading has, with the exception of a few short stretches, been completed. After leaving Bada the general course of the Gharraf is followed on the west bank, the distance from the river varying but usually being half a mile and at several points where the bends of the river protude westwards, within 100 yards. Karradi (Mile 51) is passed on the opposite bank, and the road, continuing on the west bank in a northerly direction, reaches Qal’a Sikar, where it crosses the Gharraf. The crossing is effected in the flood season by means of a double bellum ferry capable of transporting 1 touring car (30 cwt.) or twenty men. It is hand operated. In the summer the crossing is made over the dry river bed, in which the surface is heavy sand. This crossing would present serious difficulties for heavy mechanical transport. After leaving Qal’a Sikar, the road, now on the east bank, continues to follow the course of the Gharraf northward until Mile 63. Between Qal’a Sikar and this point the surface is bad, being of a fine sand which, during the late dry season, would enforce the use by heavy mechanical transport of the numerous short alternative loopways which exist.Route Report No. 81 270 At Mile 63, the road bears sharply westward and its surface begins to improve. Between Miles 65 and 70 it gradually resumes its northerly course. At Mile 75 the village of Hussain az Ziraji is passed, where the road strikes across country, cutting out the bend of the Gharraf round the Haur Saiyid Idris. At Mile 80 it rejoins the river, passes close to the village of Qal’a Saiyid Tahir al Burghif (Mile 83) and, having for the last 3 miles hugged the east bank of the river, enters Kut al Hai. After Kut al Hai, the road continuing its course, northwards, skirts the cultivation and bears away from the river, which is left some four miles distant from the road. After crossing the Nahr Subaili (Mile 102-5) the road bears north-west and the distance between it and the river decreases to about half a mile. This distance is maintained until reaching Mile 110 approximately, where the two again separate. The village of Shaikh Qassab is passed at Mile 107-5 where a pumping station exists and which will generally be the most convenient place for a halt. On leaving the river at Mile 111, the road heads directly for Umm al Hillana which is reached at Mile 116-6. Here a ferry operates across the Tigris. After crossing the Tigris the road turns sharp right for 200 yards along the left bank, then turns left and runs direct to Kut al Imara, which is reached at Mile 118. Eighty-three bridges and about 300 culverts have been built along the route (up to 18-2-31). A motor ferry has been installed at Kut al Imara and a double bellum ferry at Qal’a Sikar where the road crosses the Gharraf. (42) Pages 270 271, para. 2, Water. Delete this paragraph, except heading Substitute :— , 1 he irrigation of the Gharraf is controlled by the Kut Barrage, opened in 1939. The barrage spans the Tigris, about a £-mile above Kut al Imara and allows a controlled supply of water to pass to the Shatt al Gharraf, which formerly depended solely on the flooding of the Tigris. The completion of the barrage has assured the irrigation of an area of 700 square miles, and the subsidiary canals which form a part of the scheme will bring settled conditions to a further 1,200 square miles.

Supplies Shatra, Qal a Sikar, Kut al Hai and Kut al Imara, being towns of some size and importance, would form the natural bases for a collection of supplies for a column moving along the route in question. 1 he quantity which might be expected in each of these centres is detailed in the itinerary of this report, but the amount given as procurable at each place at short notice should not be understood to imply that the amount specified could be collected if demands were made on all these towns simultaneously. Between Kut al Hai and Kut al Imara supplies are very limited and their collection and delivery difficult and unreliable. A heavy fluctuation in the amount of cereals available from month to month exists throughout the route. The factors governing such fluctuations are firstly, the season of the two harvests; secondly, the sufficiency or other wise of the preceding flood and the rainfall; and thirdly, the progress of the export trade to the south. The agricultural routine of the area in question consists of the cultivation of two crops annually, a winter crop (shitwi) and a spring crop (saifi), the former being the one on which the weight of any military demands would fall most heavily. This winter crop, consisting chiefly of wheat and barley is sown with the first rains, depends, for its germination, on the rainfall immediately following the sowing and is brought to maturity by the first floods of the Tigris. It is reaped and threshed in April. Ihe spring crop, which comprises millet, rice, sesame, mash and oats, and which from a military point of view is of minor importance, is sown generally in March and depends almost entirely upon irrigation to bring it to maturity. It is harvested in May. brom this it will be seen that May is the month in which supplies will be most abundant and the period immediately preceding the harvesting of the winter crop (beginning of April) that in which they will be scarcest. I he period of great abundance is, however, short, for export to Basra by means of water transport is begun immediately after the threshing of the winter crop and continues up to the beginning of August, when the fall in the level of the water forbids the passage of mahailas to the Euphrates. Even during August, there still being a continuous stretch of water in the northern reaches of the Gharraf, there is a small export flow to Basra via Kut al Imara and the Tigris until September, when the whole Gharraf is closed to river traffic. It follows that supplies will have been heavily depleted in the area by such time, unless steps are taken sufficiently early in the season to close the export trade. It is probable, however, that with the completion of the barrage at Kut al Imara, native craft will be able to proceed at all times of the year to the Euphrates and stocks of grain are likely, therefore, to be diminished still more rapidly. 4. Livestock Almost all the tribes in Muntafiq have a proportion of sheep-owning sections. The actual proportion varies with each tiibe and in some cases is as high as 80 per cent.Route Report No. 81 272 The majority of these sheep-owning sections follow an invariable annual practice of gracing near the Gharraf during the summer months, moving into the Jazirat Saiyid Ahmad on the east bank of the Gharraf, the Jazirat al Kar on the west bank of the Gharraf, or the Southern Desert during the period of the early rains. They return to the vicinity of the rivers in May or June. Even during the winter and spring, however, large numbers of sheep are to be found close to the Gharraf. Cattle are at all times available in limited quantities, their movements corresponding to those of the sheep. Generally speaking, therefore, the live-stock in the district may be regarded at all times as sufficient to meet the demands of any force, and during the summer months, as unlimited, provided always that the demand should fit in with the wishes of the tribe. 5. Fuel The only timber available from Nasiriya to Kut al Hai is a very limited quantity of palm and heavy bush in the neighbourhood of some dozen villages along the route. The use of this as fuel would only be possible in an emergency. A force moving through the district would be dependent for its fuel on the low scrub which exists everywhere in abundance. Owing to the lightness and fast-burning qualities of the scrub, the collection of a sufficient quantity to meet the needs of a passing column would take a little time, and arrangements made beforehand to have this work done by civilian labour would be advisable. From Kut al Hai to Kut al Imara only very thin scrub exists on the road side and then only at intervals. For all practical purposes it may be reckoned that fuel required can only be supplied through Kut al Imara. 6. Transport (а) Donkeys .—From Nasiriya to Kut al Hai, donkeys are available throughout the route in large numbers at all times. Generally speaking, they accompany the shepherd sections of the tribe in their movements in search of good grazing, but even in that period in which they might be expected to be scarcest, 500 donkeys could be collected at short notice at any point. From Kut al Hai to Kut al Imara, large numbers exist along the route, and in the vicinity of Kut al Imara at all times except in the spring, when the majority are in the Jazira or have moved towards the Iranian Frontier. (б) Camels .—Between Nasiriya and Kut al Hai, camel transport is most easily procurable in September, October and November, and least so in March, in which month the assembly of 500 camels would need four days’ notice. During the autumn 1,000 camels could be assembled with two days’ notice and 50 to 100 produced on the day of demand at Shatra, Qal’a Sikar and Kut al Hai. From Kut al Hai to Kut al Imara, large numbers exist along the route, and in the vicinity of Kut al Imara at all times except in the spring, w'hen the majority are in the Jazira or have moved towards the Iranian Frontier. It is estimated that at the time of greatest scarcity the assembly of 500 camels would need four days’ notice. During summer 1,000 camels could be collected with two days’ notice. (c) Vehicular .—Wheel transport other than motor is unobtainable at all seasons. Motor transport is available at Nasiriya and Kut al Imara only. In January, 1936, the following motor vehicles were registered on the Kut al Imara and Muntafiq Liwas :— Kut al Imara . . 48 cars, 14 lorries. Muntafiq . . 64 cars, 23 lorries. It should be understood that the amount available on short notice is dependent upon the arrangements made in other centres.(£&gt; 273 Route Report No. 81 (d) River .—At present river transport hjn?^ree parage only during the floods as far south as Shatra, but on completion of ifyerKut Barrage, the river will probably be passable for native Qf&amp;t atiall times of the year.

The con- ^ under consideration (1934). a mahaila would take three days to travel from 7. Grazing The grazing available throughout the route is dependent on the season, but close to the road it may be reckoned as poor at all times. From Nasinya to Kut al Hai it consists entirely of low scrub and camel thorn, varying in quantity at different points, but never entirely lacking, brom Kut al Hai to Kut al Imara it is invariably sparse and confined to scattered patches of scrub and camel thorn. 8. Obstacles Other than the innumerable irrigation channels which cross the road, all of which are adequately bridged to give passage to all arms, including heavy mechanical transport, no obstacles present themselves. 9. Additional work With the exception of the road between Nasiriya and Bahiza (Miles 0-10), the mechanical grading is almost finished throughout its entire length (1934). With the exception of this short stretch no additional work is required. 10. Camping and Landing Ground Camping grounds are available throughout the route for a force of anv s i Z e. Recognised landing grounds exist at Nasiriya, Shatra and Kut al Imara. Between Nasiriya and Kut al Hai, there are no suitable sites for landing grounds near the track owing to the presence of numerous irrigation channels. Between Kut al Hai and Kut al Imara, on the west side of the road, landing grounds would usually be difficult to find owing to the cultivation, existing or recent, which has scarred the country with ditches. East of the road, generally speaking, the cultivation is thinner and it would probably not be difficult to find a suitable landing ground within 5 miles of any given point on the road. 11.

Tactical The monotonous flatness of the ground rules out the necessity for con sidering generally any tactical questions dependent upon ground formation. The key positions in the area are Kut al Imara and the barrage at the mouth of the Gharraf and, in a lesser degree, the Bad'a regulator, the control of the water supply being a final answer to the question of the controlling of the area. 1 here are many points at which hostile tribesmen could, with comparative ease, flood the road and render it impassable for wheeled transport during the winter and early summer. 14. Rains and Floods Rain may fall at any time between November and March, inclusive. The surface of the road is on many stretches of such a nature that the formation of mud through heavy rain will render the road impassable to all wheels. The after effects of the rain are naturally dependent on the volume of rain which has fallen, but as a guide, it may be taken that three days of clear weather will put the road in use after a day’s heavy rain has closed it. 15. Inhabitants Though the Muntafiq tribes are generally regarded as being only theoretically in confederation, and having, in modern times, lost the cohesion necessary to united action, co-operation among them is always a possibility. In normal times, the tribes actually touching on the road are well disposed and helpful, in so far as they do not stand to lose by their help. Though there has been some considerable efflux of arms from the district during the last five years they are still well-armed. 16. Alternative Routes An alternative route leaves Nasiriya by the Shatra Gate, proceeds in a general northerly direction, picking up the Shatt al Gharraf (Shatra branch) at Mile 15-4 or about 5 miles south of Suwaij. From this point it follows the west bank of the river to Suwaij, to Mile 20-8 from Nasiriya, where the main route from Nasiriya is joined. Between Suwaij and Kut al Hai, no alternative route exists which allows the passage of wheels, but during the dry season one could usually be constructed at such points as circumstances might dictate by the simple medium of breaking down the dry irrigation ditches which, at such a time, are the only obstacles in an otherwise flat-surfaced country.* During the flood time, however, when irrigation is in progress, it would be impossible to have recourse to such a method in order to afford alternative passage to wheeled transport. At such a time, the movement of even pack transport along a route other than the road itself would be a matter of considerable difficulty. Between Kut al Hai and Kut al Imara, an alternative route is reported * to exist during the dry season from Kut al Hai eastwards into the Jazirat Sayid Ahmad to Ishan Hassan Thabra, thence north-west along the Dujaila valley to Umm Hallana Ferry. During the period of irrigation the road is cut by full irrigation canals immediately east of Kut al Hai and is impassable for wheels. The route is not recognised and is not used unless it is specially desired to penetrate the Jazira, the detour described, being considerable. * The completion of the Kut al Imara Barrage, however, is expected to ensure a supply of water in these irrigation channels at all times of the year.275 Route Report No. 81 l6Zh Itinerary No. of Stage.

Has a prosperous bazaar made up of some 400 shops and forms the normal trading and commercial centre for the surrounding district and for the upper Gharraf. Troops halting here should camp either north-west of the town or on the left bank of the ferry. (i) Water. —Unlimited from the Tigris. (ii) Supplies. —Ihe amount of supplies available varies considerably from month to month, being most plentiful in about June, when the winter crop has been harvested and before its export to Basra. Immediately before the harvest is the period of greatest scarcity. In 1930, owing to low prices and plentiful supply, much grain was retained in the district, and it was reported that at least 300 tons of grain was stored in the town and a considerable amount in the neighbouring villages. Under normal circumstances the town might reasonably be expected to furnish a permanent daily supply of 15 tons of wheat and 15 tons of barley with a corresponding amount of tibn. A fair amount of garden cultivation is carried out near the town and lucerne and vegetables are available in limited quantities while in season.281 Route Report No. 81 Sheep are available in unlimited quantities throughout the year but, in the spring, notice would have to be given to meet large demands, the flocks being at that time some distance from the river in the Jazirat Saiyid Ahmad or in the neighbourhood of the Iranian frontier. A small proportion of cattle are kept by the shepherd sections of the surrounding tribes (iii) Fuel. —(a) Oil. —A depot of the Khanaqin Oil Company exists in Kut al Imara. It holds in store, under normal circumstances, 4,000 gallons of petrol, 1,500 gallons of lubricating oil and 100 tons of black oil, the last for the supply of the numerous pumping machines in the neighbourhood. Depleted stocks are made up from Khanaqin. {b) Wood .—Other than palm, there is no timber available in the district, except that which is brought in from Basra, of which there is usually about 100 tons in the bazaar awaiting sale for building purposes, river craft repair, etc. (c) Charcoal .—About % ton of Karachi charcoal is available in winter on demand. Greater demands would have to be trans ported by road or river from Basra. The normal domestic fuel of the inhabitants is scrub fuel, collected from the surrounding country and brought into the town daily. Charcoal manufacture, from local scrub, is practised, but the quality of the charcoal is poor and the demand small. (iv) Transport. — (a) Vehicular. —Wheeled transport, other than motor is unobtainable. In the town there is usually about 50 cars and 10 light lorries. These are normally used for transport along the Tigris and Gharraf roads. Very little carriage of goods by cars is performed, river transport charges being so much cheaper. {b) River Transport .—Nearly all transportation of goods is per formed by river craft and at Kut al Imara, between four and eight mahailas and 20 bellums are usually to be found.

Authority :—Air Staff (Intelligence), ’Iraq. Date : —1st April, 1934. Map Reference :—Basra Million Sheet, H.38, 1930 (gridded). Epitome 1. General The route may be considered to begin from a point 1 mile west of the Ur railway station where the Nasiriya road crosses the railway line. Leaving Tall al Mugaiyir on the right, the road runs due south over flat and barren desert until Mile 7, when a low sand belt offering no difficulties is crossed. .The general southerly direction is maintained over the flat overgrown surface of the Sulaibiya marsh. After crossing the marsh the road twists right for a mile on encountering the main sand belt stretched across its front, turning sharp left again, and passing through the sand belt by a natural gap some 400 yards in breadth. Here the general direction becomes south-east until Abu Ghar (Mile 53) is reached. I he road, leaving Abu Ghar 600 yards on its left, then strikes due south, and maintaining this general direction passes Buswa (Mile 73) a group of wells immediately on the left, and reaches Busaiya (Mile 79). 2. Water The quantity and quality of the water on the route varies with the seasons, but at all times may be regarded as the sole factor governing the length of the stages for a marching column. Generally water is obtainable on the direct Ur-Busaiya road only at the following points :— Sulaibiya (B.0162—Mile 26), Qasr Nab’a (B.0246—Mile 39). Abu Ghar (B. 1238—Mile 53), and Buswa (B.0912—Mile 73). With the exception of Shahab well, at Abu Ghar, the water available is obtained from a series of open pits varying in depth from 2 or 3 feet to 30 feet, into the pan at the bottom of which there is a constant percolation of water. The yield of each pit differs from that of its neighbours and is variable with the seasons. The Shahab well, at Abu Ghar, is walled with stone blocks. As well mouths are open to weather, unless they are periodically dug out they become choked with blown sand. Normally the digging out of this sand is done by the Bedouin who happen to be grazing nearby, and who are dependent on the well. It is possible, therefore, that if a well area is not used by Bedouin for some time, the well pits will be full of sand. One cannot state that a supply of water will be immediately available at any of these points at any fixed time.283 Route Report No. 89 As a general guide to the potentialities of the wells, however, it may be taken that they are at any time sufficient for the needs of the following forces :—Sulaibiyat al Hamir, half a company. Abu Ghar, two companies, Qasr Nab’a, one company, and Buswa, half a company, conditional upon the possibility of these forces having to do two hours work in digging out the wells on their arrival at each point, and on the assumption that they are moving with horse drawn transport. During the spring, when the yield of the wells is higher, each well may be judged to be sufficient for double the strength given above. In view of the fact that one stage of the march is as long as 26 miles it will be realised that only well disciplined and highly trained troops will be able to perform the march without auxiliary water carrying transport. In addition no column of any size should set out on the march without being in possession of the most recent Bedouin reports on the state of the wells, or, if circumstances permit, should be preceded by a water reconnaissance party. 3. Supplies The only kind of supplies which exists on the route or at either end of it, is livestock in the form of sheep. All other supplies must be obtained from Nasiriya or some other source outside the scope of this report. The presence of livestock in the vicinity of the route depends firstly on the season and secondly on the quantity of grazing. The sheep-owning tribes of the Muntafiq are to be found during the months of December to April, inclusive, scattered over the desert as far as the Neutral Zone, and the presence of good grazing in any particular area, makes for a concentration therein. It is, therefore, impossible to stipulate numbers of livestock which would be available, but during the grazing season, it may be taken that with four days’ notice 500 sheep could be assembled at any fixed point on the road, that a similar number could be collected at Busaiya with two days’ notice, and an unlimited number at Ur with three days’ notice. During the summer months, the number available along the route is much reduced owing to the withdrawal of the sheep-owning tribes to the interior. The Bedouin only keeps a very limited number of sheep, and these for supplying their own wants. It may be expected, at that time, that only 50 sheep could be assembled at Busaiya with two days’ notice, 500 at Ur with one day’s notice and an unlimited quantity at Ur with four days’ notice. These figures are arbitrary, and are intended only to be a rough guide to the potentialities of the route under normal conditions. 4. Fuel Low desert scrub is found in abundance throughout the route. Timber is non-existant. 5. Transport The only form of animal transport available is camels. Though there are large numbers of camels in the desert throughout the year, it would usually be simpler to collect such camel transport as should be required from Nasiriya and the Muntafiq area, owing to the fact that the Bedouin, as well as having a prejudice against hiring out their animals, are difficult to get in touch with, and would, in such a matter, be unreliable. Two days’ notice would be required to assemble 300 camels at Ur, and if urgently required, a camel caravan could do the journey from Ur to Busaiya in two days. Should camels be requisitioned for the purpose of water transport, fantasses, or some other means of carrying water, would have to be provided. Horse drawn wheel transport is unobtainable along the road, or in any of the Muntafiq towns. The cheapest and most effective form of transport for a column moving to Busaiya would undoubtedly be motor transport, which is obtainable locallyRoute Report No. 89 284 in limited quantities. It may be expected under normal conditions that there will be about 20 cars and 4 motor lorries in Nasiriya or within easy reach of that town. Arrangements for the assembly of a greater number can be made through Nasiriya, but the vehicles themselves will probably have to be brought up from Basra. 6. Grazing Low desert scrub is the only form of grazing on the road. Its quality and quantity, of course, vary with the seasons, being generally best in March and worst in October. 7. Obstacles. Nil. 8. Additional work. There is no additional work on the route practicable under existing circumstances which could result in any appreciable advantage, or which would repay the time and labour necessary for its performance. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds The country traversed is flat, and camping and landing grounds are unlimited throughout. 10. Co mmuni cations Recognised tracks exist from Busaiya to Basra, Rukhaimiya, and As Sulman, and from Ur to Nasiriya, Samawa, and Basra. Telegraph and Wireless .—There is a wireless station at Busaiya controlled by the ’Iraq desert police. Telegraphic communication is established along the railway line from L r station, but can only be connected with the State line at Basra, or at Nasiriya. There is no telephonic communication from Ur. 11. Climate Normal to the country. 12. Tactical Owing to the level nature of the country no general tactical considerations dependent on feature and ground formation present themselves. The wells along the roads may be regarded as valuable, though not vital, points for an effective stoppage or opening of the road. Subject to the general limitations set out elsewhere in this report, all tactical considerations may be appreciated from a study of the map. 13. Rains and Floods From Ur to Mile 30 (approximately) the road is liable to be seriously affected by rains, and after heavy rain will be impassable for wheels, remaining so until the ground dries, which may be expected as a result of three or four days dry and sunny weather. The Sulaibiya marsh from Mile 13 to Mile 26, however, being salty soil, will retain moisture longer and may remain impassable after heavy rain for anything up to eight days. 14. Inhabitants The Bedouin, for the most part of the Dhafir tribe, are generally present at all seasons, and from December to April inclusive, the sheep-owning sections of the Muntafiq and Bani Huchaim.285 Route Report No. 89 15. Alternate Routes A route exists from Jaliba to Abu Ghar, but it possesses little advantage over the more direct one from Ur. Under conditions where the Sulaibiya marsh might be impassable to wheels, the Jaliba route could be used, and at such a time (i.e., shortly after heavy rain) the normal sandy surface of this route might be expected to be fairly good. This route from Jaliba to Abu Ghar, and the more usual route from Ur, cross the sand belt at the only two places in the immediate neighbourhood where the sand is sufficiently shallow and firm to give passage to wheels. An examination of the map may raise the suggestion of using Dafina as a watering point, but the sand, in this part of the belt, absolutely prohibits the passage of wheeled transport. Ao. of Distance.

Situated on the tail of the Shaib al Luwaihidh. It houses a small garrison of the ’Iraq desert police, composed of foot police, camelry, and one or two armed cars, and is also equipped with W/T. Supplies for the police garrison are despatched weekly from Nasiriya. (1) Water .—Water is obtained from a number of shallow pits, 10-15 ft. deep, some of which are situated between the barbed wire apron surrounding the fort. In winter, when supplies have been replenished by rain, the water is sweet, but tends to become brackish in the autumn. In seasons of scanty rainfall, the output of the water-holes diminishes through the ensuing summer but should normally suffice for a company throughout the year. For European consumption the water needs purification. A cemented well within the fort provides brackish water. (2) Supplies. —Nil. Fuel, in the form of scrub, is scanty in the vicinity of the fort. See also Epitome, para. 3. (3) Grazing. —Camel grazing is abundant in spring, within a few miles of the fort. At other times of the year it is fair. (4) Camping and Landing Grounds. —Camp sites are unlimited. An excellent R.A.F. landing ground is situated on the west bank of the wadi; standard markings in concrete and snowcrete, size 1,300 by 1,200 yards, surface hard gravel.

Authority : —Air Staff (Intelligence), ’Iraq. Date : —1st April, 1934. Map References :—“ Mesopotamia ” 1 in. = 2m Series, Sheets No. 1 and No. 3. Epitome 1. General The route Basra to Fao is clearly defined throughout its length and is passable for a force of all arms, including heavy mechanical transport and armoured cars, except in the rainy season, when after one day’s rain, it becomes unserviceable. The track runs over desert throughout its length and there are therefore no bridges or culverts on the route. 2. Water A plentiful supply can be obtained from the many channels which irrigate the palm groves adjacent to the road on the north-east side. Space, however, is limited amongst the palms, and tackle including troughs for animals would be necessary. As the water is diverted from the larger channels according to the needs of the cultivators, it is advisable to make previous arrangements for water to be available in any particular area. 3. Supplies Supplies must be regarded as non-existent on this route. Dates and vegetables only, when in season, might be obtained by local purchase from the cultivators, but more satisfactory arrangements can be made through contractors in Basra. 4. Fuel Almost unlimited supplies of palm logs and branches can be obtained. These, however, form poor fuel. No other form of fuel is available. 5. Transport The number of motor vehicles registered in the Basra Liwa on 1st January, 1936, was— 478 cars, 70 lorries. A proportion of these should be available. A few (perhaps ten) are normally employed as taxis on the route under report. The route, in wet weather is totally unsuited to camel transport. If required, small numbers of camels and donkeys might be obtained from Zubair.289 Route Report No. 90 (C23303) L 6. Grazing None in the desert to the south of the route as the soil is all “ subkha ” which grows nothing. Scanty amongst the palm groves. 7. Obstacles Nil. The principal obstacle to the passage of the route during the winter is the nature of the soil after rain. For this there is no remedy. 8. Additional Work A grader and leveller could be used with advantage to resurface the route at the conclusion of the rainy season. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds In dry weather, unrestricted space is available for camping grounds on the south of the road, and, in places, to the north of it, but water is only available as shown in para. 2. Even in the dry season, subkha forms treacherous landing ground for aircraft, as it retains moisture immediately below the surface for long periods, and is consequently slippery. An area suitable for all types, except after heavy rain, is located immediately south of the tomb, Mir Abul Hassanain (' Mir Abul ” on Mesopotamia Sheet No. 1, Ref. 2g). Care should be taken to avoid the telegraph line. 10. Communications Telegraph and telephone line from Basra to Fao (branch line to Abul Khasib and Siba) runs alongside the route throughout its length. The Shatt al 'Arab also runs parallel with the route but is, at some parts, as much as four miles distant. 11. Climate The normal conditions prevalent in southern ’Iraq may be expected. Rain falls from November to April and high tides, which are liable to cause the track to be flooded, may be expected in the spring (late February and mid-April). 12. Tactical The country is featureless to the south of the road. An opposing force holding the palm groves to the north-east of the track would command the water supply. When the area to the south-east of the track is flooded, a strong defensive position could be formed by holding the space between the bund at Mile 22 and the river. 13. Rains and Floods A day’s heavy rainfall renders the track impassable for probably a week. Exceptionally high tides in the Persian Gulf, together with a strong south easterly wind, sometimes result in the flooding of the track from the tails of the Khor ’Abdullah and Khor Zubair. 14. Inhabitants The cultivators living in the various villages between the road and the river are non-tribal. They lack cohesion, are poorly armed and are unlikely to give trouble.Route Report No. 90 290 15. Alternative Routes An alternative route which is used by taxi traffic when the Siba road is unserviceable, runs from Basra to Abul-Khasib. Communicating tracks join the Siba road at Mile 5-5, Mile 12, Mile 14, and Mile 18. On the track which joins at Mile 18, however, a single pontoon ferry across the Nahr Abu Plus must be negotiated.

A wireless station (controlled by the Port Directorate) and a post and telegraph office (’Iraq Government) are maintained. There are also :—School (2 teachers, 70 pupils), hospital with Indian doctor and 20 beds, police post (strength, 1 officer, 10 foot). Customs post, and numerous workshops for carrying out repairs to river craft and maintaining a service of lights in the Persian Gulf. Water. —The question of water supply becomes more difficult as one approaches the sea. Except during the flood season, the water in the lower reaches of the Shatt al 'Arab is decidedly salty.

Authority :—Air Staff (Intelligence), ’Iraq. Date: —1st April, 1934. Map References:—\ : 1,000,000, H.38 Basra. Mesopotamia Series. Sheet No. 1. Epitome. 1. General The road leaves Basra city via the Zubair gate in a west-south-west direction, running for nine miles of the first stage over heavy “ subkha or salt-impregnated soil. After two or three days’ heavy rain this part of the route becomes impassable for mechanical transport. From Mile 9, through Zubair, as far as Mile 91 in the vicinity of Jahra, the country traversed is hard, gravelly, undulating desert, a fast stretch for motor transport and, except for occasional short lengths, entirely unaffected by the heaviest rains, b rom Mile 91 as far as Kuwait, sandy patches and “ subkha alternate. Here again, a few days’ rain makes the track impassable for mechanical transport for several days. 2. Water Stage 1.—A large number of wells are to be found amongst the tamarisk groves in the vicinity of Zubair, but the majority contain brackish water and the supply of drinking water is therefore limited. It would be necessary to ascertain at the time water is required which wells give the sweetest water as the salinity varies in each well from time to time. Stage 2.—A perennial and plentiful supply of slightly brackish water is available from some 20 wells at Safwan (Mile 33). Some of the wells are brick lined with a diameter of 9-12 ft. at the mouth. Depth to water, 17-20 ft. The water is sweetest in the wells nearest the palms. Stage 4 —A semi-permanent water hole named Hissu adh Dhabi (H.6461) is located in the bed of a wadi at the end of Stage 4. The supply is uncertain, as it is entirely dependent on rainfall. At its best, it would probably only suffice for the extreme needs of a company. Stage 7.—At Jahra (H.59.20) there are 65 wells, some of which are used for watering small patches of crops. The supply is permanent and plentiful, though the water in some cases is brackish. The best and largest well belongs to the Shaikh of Kuwait. ^ , No other sources en route can be relied upon and it would therefore be necessary to carry all water for troops and in the intermediate stages, for animals also. l 4 (C23303)Route Report No. 91 296 In winter, if the rainfall has been satisfactory, pools may be found during the months of December, January and February in the vicinity of the road. These would probably suffice for animals. 3. Supplies Meat is the only commodity available and sufficient for the requirements of a division should be obtainable at Zubair or Jahra if three days’ notice were given to the local authorities. Vegetables, dates, etc., are grown in small quantities at Jahra but are only sufficient for the needs of the local populace. 4. Fuel Tamarisk faggots could be requisitioned in almost unlimited quantities from Zubair. After the first twenty miles camel thorn, scrub, etc., is plentiful and a few palm logs might be available at Jahra. 5. Transport In January, 1936, the following motor vehicles were registered in the Basra Liwa. A proportion of these would be available for use on the Kuwait route:— Basra Liwa—478 cars ; 70 lorries. At Zubair, about 200 donkeys and 100 camels could be assembled at two day’s notice. At Kuwait, some 40 cars of various makes might be requisitioned, including those of the Kuwait Transport Company who hold a monopoly, granted by the Shaikh of Kuwait, for all mechanical transport on this route within his domain. The co-operation of the Shaikh would also be necessary if camel transport is required, as the Bedouin are averse to hiring their camels for this purpose. 6. Grazing Between Basra and Zubair, nil. For the remainder of the route it is dependent entirely on rainfall, but is usually plentiful for camels, sheep and goats after Mile 20. 7. Obstacles The flooding of the route between Basra and Jama’ AH (Mile 9-0) would render the track impassable, but this could only be carried out, if at all, at time of high flood by breaking down the railway bunds between the route and the Hammar lakes. No other obstacles are encountered. 8. Additional work The construction of a bund road for the first 8 miles (to Zubair) would make the track passable, at least as far as Jahra, in all weathers. An old railway bund which will probably be utilised by the ’Iraq Government for this purpose, still exists. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds Between Basra and Zubair the soil is totally unsuited to camping sites though aircraft might be landed during the dry season with care. Camps might be made almost anywhere along the remainder of the route, due regard being paid to the limitations of water and fuel as noted in paras. 2 and 4.297 Route Report No. 91 10. Communications There is a telegraph and telephone line between Basra and Zubair and a telegraph line from Zubair to Kuwait. The latter, which follows the western shore of the Khor Zubair, is being re-aligned to run parallel with the route herein described. 11. Climate The normal weather conditions prevalent in Southern 'Iraq may be expected. The rainy season usually commences in late October and ends at the beginning of April, the prevailing rain wind being from the south-east. During this period occasional frosts are experienced with strong winds and thunderstorms. 12. Tactical Broken ground in the vicinity of Zubair forms a suitable position from which an enemy force could oppose movement of troops along the route. The occupation by the enemy of low hills on either side of the road at Mile 87 would also close the route. 13. Rains and Floods Rains .—After 24 hours’ heavy rain, the sector Basra-Zubair is only passable with difficulty by light cars. Four or five days fine weather with drying winds is necessary before armoured cars can negotiate the track successfully. The Jahra-Kuwait sector also is rendered impassable after about 48 hours’ heavy rain, but dries more quickly owing to the sandy nature of the soil. Floods .—No part of the route is liable to be flooded, though with exceptionally high tides the area to the south of the track between Basra and Zubair, but separated from it by the old railway bund, is on rare occasions, submerged by water from the tails of the channels running into the Khor Zubair. 14. Inhabitants Entirely nomadic with the exception of the populations of Zubair and Jahra. Zubair is perhaps the most important of the desert ports of ’Iraq, a distributing centre for the trade between the western desert and Basra, at which nomad caravans from most of the great desert tribes call to barter for food-stuffs and clothes. Individuals from almost every tribe in northern Najd will be found there. The population of Zubair is about 6,000, the majority of the inhabitants being Nejdi and of the Sunni Muhammadan religion. The wealthier members of the community are Nejdi merchants who have settled in the district. The town is therefore always well informed with regard to recent political happenings in the desert, but is unlikely to be openly hostile, owing to commercial interests. Jahra (H.5920) is a small town with a population of about 300, situated in a clump of palms at the head of Kuwait Bay. Its inhabitants are chiefly engaged in cultivating small patches of vegetables, lucerne, etc., for the use of the townspeople of Kuwait, by whom the majority are employed. It is most improbable that they would be hostile in the event of disturbances. A fort at the southern end of the town, owned by the Shaikh of Kuwait, was successfully defended in 1920 against several thousand Akhwan tribesmen, though artillery was not used in the battle. 15. Alternative Routes Between Zubair and Mile 89 near Jahra, any part of the track that may be out of action may be avoided by a detour to right or left, though in the vicinity of al Abatah (Mile 60 to 66) the crossing of sandy wadis would be liable to hinder motor transport.Route Report No. 91 298 No. of Stage.

Kuwait. —A walled seaport town situated on a promontory and bordered on the north and east sides by the sea and on the south and west by the desert. The buildings are constructed of rock extracted from the sea and plastered with gypsum. Kuwait is governed by the Shaikhs of the Subah family, the present ruler (1935) being Sir Ahmad al Jabir as Sabah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., whose territory extends from Safwan to Subaihiya and from the coast to the Batin. He is in treaty relations with the British Government and is advised, in his foreign dealings, by a British Political Resident. The principal industry of Kuwait is pearl diving, which occupies the great majority of its 40,000 inhabitants, and is continually attracting fresh recruits from all parts of Arabia. The population almost without exception belongs to the Sunni Sect. In former years the town was prominent as a desert port at which caravans from the Bedouin tribes replenished their supplies, but its importance in this direction has been on the decline for some ten years past owing to a virtual blockade by Ibn Sa’ud, King of Sa’udi Arabia. In any event, all edible commodities (except fish and meat) have to be procured from ’Iraq, Persia, or India, and large stocks are not usually held.Route Report No. 91 304 The town possesses an excellent hospital with about 40 beds and a resident surgeon belonging to the American Mission. Postal and telegraphic facilities operated by the 'Iraq Posts and Telegraph Department are available in the town. An aerodrome suitable for all types exists outside the wall at the south-east corner of the town. Imperial Airways land regularly at Kuwait. Water. A meagre supply can be obtained from Sulaibiya. In Kuwait itself no springs exist, though unsuccessful attempts to discover artesian water have been made. At present (1931) the drinkable supply is brought daily by sailing ships from the mouth of the Shatt al 'Arab. Supplies. Meat could be provided in almost unlimited quantities, subject to two or three days’ notice, and the same may be said of fish. Of other supplies, only comparatively small stocks are held by the Kuwait merchants—sufficient, perhaps, for a brigade for two or three days—with the exception of vegetables which are almost unobtainable. Fuel .—Scrub is collected from the surrounding desert and brought in to the town for sale. Two days’ notice would be necessary if. a large quantity is required. Transport .—About 40 touring cars of various makes are available. Camel and donkey transport in limited numbers could be obtained with the co-operation of the Ruler of Kuwait. Grazing. —Nil. Camping and Landing Grounds .—The most suitable area for camp sites is at the south-east corner of the town outside the wall, though space for a brigade could be found inside the wall at the east end of the town. Landing Grounds. The best is that already detailed at Kuwait. Aircraft have landed at the western end of the town at Mile 112-6, though part of the area is scarred with deep camel tracks. Care should also be taken to avoid the telegraph line.305 ROUTE REPORT No. 92 ^ BASRA to BUSAIYA via SHTJ’AIBA and RUHAIL (“ A,” “ H,” ' C ” and “ B ” Tracks.)

Map Reference :—1 : 1,000,000, H.38, Basra Sheet, 1930 (gridded). Epitome 1. General The first 17 miles of this track, as far as its sign-posted junction with the track to Ur, are described in Route Report No. 60 (q v.). From this junction, the route passes over desert, which is totally devoid of any permanent habita tion with the exception of 'Iraqi police garrisons at the forts of Busaiya, As Sulman, etc. The desert tracks under report are none of them metalled nor is metalling available at any point on the route. They are, in fact, no more than wheel tracks, faint where the going is hard, plainly marked by wheel ruts where muddy patches are encountered in the winter, and liable to be totally obliterated, in the sandy stretches, by dust or sand storms. Land marks, especially after the track has left the Batin, are few and are not easily identified. For greater clarity therefore, identification letters (each 6 ft. in size, so that they may also be visible from aircraft) have been dug at intervals of approximately 10 miles along each of the desert tracks. Numerals in Roman figures, accompanying these letters indicate the mileage from the starting point. The “A” track commences at Mile 17-3, the junction of the Basra-Ur and Basra-Busaiya routes and bears left in a south-westerly direction, which course it maintains to Jarishan. From Shu’aiba to Hulaiba the track, which is passable for all classes of traffic at all seasons of the year, crosses the delta of the Batin, a flat featureless desert of hard gravel soil, practically devoid of scrub and a fast stretch for motor transport. At Mile 50-5, Hulaiba, a bushyRoute Report No. 92 306 hollow about 3 miles in length, with a water hole, is reached. From this point onwards, the banks of the Batin become more prominent and the channel commences to assume definite shape as a watercourse. At Jarishan, a conical hill, the summit of w r hich is light coloured, and which lies to the West of the route, the track bifurcates. At the point of bifurcation there is a signpost, and the two tracks are clearly marked with track letters. The right fork leads to Busaiya by way of “ B ” track (see alternative routes, para. 12). I he left fork (“A” track) leads in a south-south-west direction, with scrub on either side of the track to Ruhail (Mile 89), a prominent hill with a double hummock lying to the west of the track. At this point, “ H ' and C ” tracks branch right in a westerly direction. This junction is also signposted and marked with the directional arrows and track letters. At Mile 91, the track winds up an incline which is liable to be cut up after rain and at Mile 94, “ C ” track branches right in a north-westerly direction. The junction of H and ‘ C ” tracks is signposted and directional arrows and track letters are clearly marked. At Mile 97, a patch of deep soft sand, 300 yards in length, is encountered and the track bears sharp left around a small prominent hill. From Mile 98 to Mile 145, the junction of “ C ” and “ B ” tracks, the track winds over soft gravel desert with thick scrub en route. This junction is marked with directional arrow and letter for “ C ” track only. ( C and B tracks are co-incident from mile 145 to Busaiya). From this point to Mile 160, the track runs in a westerly direction, over soft sand and thick camel thorn. Heavy dust and sand storms make the going very difficult and almost obliterate the track. At Mile 150, the ground changes to hard gravel and is good going to Busaiya. At Mile 168, the track bears north, and at Miles 169 and 170-3 “ D ” and “ E ” tracks join from the south-west and run in conformity with “ B ” track, reaching Busaiya at Mile 171. 2. Water Miles 15-5-20-5, wells in tamarisk groves are perennial. Without puri fication, the water is fit for animals only. Mile 50-5, Hulaiba. After rain, water collects in a hole at Hulaiba, but is unfit for consumption by Europeans. Animals can, however, be watered here. Between Hulaiba (50-5) and Busaiya (171), no water is available. 3. Grazing The grazing available throughout the route consists almost entirely of low scrub and camel thorn. It is dependent on the season and, in winter and spring, small patches of grass may usually be formed. Given satisfactory winter rains, grazing for camels in the Dibdibba, the area between the Batin and the Hanniya ridge is usually excellent. It is generally at its best in March and at its worst in October. 4. Obstacles Mile 97—soft sand. Miles 119-124—very soft gravel ridge, which may be avoided by making a wide detour to the left. Miles 145-160—soft sand and thick scrub render the track difficult to follow, particularly after dust and sand storms. 5. Camping and Landing Grounds Camping grounds are unlimited between Shu’aiba and Busaiya, and fuel, in the form of low desert scrub, is abundant on most parts of the route. No permanent water or supplies are, however, available at any intermediate point. Landing grounds are available in vicinity of track and in any direction between Miles 19-5 and 63-5. Few other suitable landing grounds exist along the route until reaching Mile 160 (B. 1) when, from this point to Busaiya, it is possible to land at any season of the year and in any wind direction.307 Route Report No. 92 6. Communications Basra has the usual telegraph, telephone and W/T facilities to all parts of ’Iraq. At Shu’aiba there is a R.A.F. W/T station, and at Busaiya a W/T station operated and controlled by the ’Iraq police. Other than the desert tracks, which radiate to all parts of the southern desert and are negotiable in all weathers, there are no other means of communication. 7. Climate Normal for southern desert. 8. Rains and Floods With the exception of the first 10 miles of the route, no part of the track is susceptible to floods nor does it deteriorate under heavy rains : in fact the rains which may be expected between November and March tend to harden the sandy stretches. The effect of rains and floods on the sector Basra—Zubair has been dealt with in Route Report No. 60. 9. Tactical Generally speaking the country is fiat and few tactical considerations dependent on feature and ground formation present themselves. From Mile 50 to 64 the route follows the bed of the Batin with gently sloping banks rising to 30-40 ft. above road level, at distances varying from £ mile to 1 mile each side of the road. The usual flank protection would be necessary for a force moving along this stretch. The descent of the Hanniya ridge, a sloping cliff face some 50-70 ft. in height facing westwards, would form a suitable rearguard position for a retreating force. The surface of the area, between Miles 15-89-5 and 160-171, is suited to armoured car operations. Between Miles 89 • 5 and 145, going is soft and would materially affect the speed of a convoy—whilst from Mile 145 to 160, sand and thick scrub render the area totally unsuitable for manoeuvres by armoured vehicles. 11. Inhabitants Nomadic. The area is the normal grazing ground of the Dhafir tribe and is also occupied in winter by shepherd sections of the Muntafiq tribes from the riverain areas around Nasiriya. They are well armed but their attitude is normally friendly. 12. Alternative Routes Via “ B ” track from Jarishan to Busaiya ; this shortens the distance to 149 miles but soft sand and camel thorn render the first 74 miles difficult, especially after dust and sand storms.

It houses a small garrison of the ’Iraq desert police, composed of foot police, camelry, and one or two armed cars, and is also equipped with \\ /T. Supplies for the police garrison are despatched weekly from Nasiriya. Water. —Water is obtained from a number of shallow pits, 10-15 ft. deep, some of which are situated within the barbed wire apron surrounding the fort. In winter, when supplies have been replenished by rain, the water is sweet, but tends to become brackish in the autumn. In seasons of scanty rainfall, the output of the water holes diminishes through the ensuing summer but should normally suffice for a company throughout the year, bor European consumption, the water needs purification. A cemented well within the fort provides brackish water. Supplies. —Nil. Fuel, in the form of scrub is scanty in the vicinity of the fort. See also Route No. 89. Epitome, para. 3. Grazing. —Camel grazing is abundant in spring, within a few miles of the fort. At other times of the year it is fair. Camping and Landing Grounds. —Camp sites are unlimited. An excellent R.A.F. landing ground is situated on the west bank of the wadi; standard markings in concrete and snowcrete, size 1,300 by 1,200 yards surface hard gravel. Fuel and oil supplies are maintained in the fort. Communications .— (i) W/T police installation. (ii) By desert tracks to Nasiriya, As Salman, Tuqaiyid, Rukhaimiya, and Al Hafar.310 ROUTE REPORT No. 97 BUSAIYA to AL HAFAR via RUKHAIMYA Total Distance :—171 miles (approximately). Inter Distance : —Rukhaimiya, 83 miles. Authority :—Air Staff (Intelligence), ’Iraq. Date : —25th May, 1934. Map Reference :—1 : 1,000,000 Basra Sheet. (Gridded) 1930. 1. General As far as Rukhaimiya (F. 59.07) the track runs parallel with the Hanniya ridge, a prominent natural defence to the east of the route and preserves a south by south-west direction. Thence, onwards to A1 Uqubba (L. 53.60) the general direction is almost due south whilst from Uqubba to A1 Hafar (L. 98.17) the track runs towards the south-east. Going is over gently undulating, soft gravel desert with patches of grass and soft low mounds, which latter should be avoided by transport. Between Rukhaimiya and A1 Uqubba the going is inclined to be soft, but improves south of A1 Uqubba where the track crosses a level plateau with a pebbly surface, bare of vegetation. 2. Water During the winter months, water in numerous pools may be expected, provided rainfall has been satisfactory. In summer, at Mile 32, small quantities of water are usually available from the water holes of Laiya (G.08.70) and also from those at Abtiya (F.89.39) a few miles to the east of the track at Mile 57. At Rukhaimiya (F.59.07—83 miles) to Samah (L.55.87—112 miles) and A1 Uqubba (L.53.60—130 miles). Perennial water is available from deep wells (Rukhaimiya, 150 ft. ; Samah, 60 ft. ; A1 Uqubba, 130 ft.) for which tackle, ropes, etc., are necessary. At Umm al Abid (F.46.05) (Mile 105), there are some 15 water holes, from which water at a depth of approximately 20 ft. may be obtained in winter. 3. Grazing and Fuel Fuel in the shape of camel thorn is sparse at first, but becomes more plentiful as the track nears Rukhaimiya, where also the grazing, given satisfactory rains, is usually very good. Between Al Uqubba and Al Hafar both grazing and fuel are scarce. 4. Obstacles Nil.311 Route Report No. 97 5. Camping and Landing Grounds Space for camping grounds is unlimited and sites are only dictated by considerations of water. Landing Grounds .—There are many areas along the route where aircraft may land with safety and a moderately good landing ground marked with an entrenched position on its west, south and east sides is situated some 5 miles north-north-west of Rukhaimiya. 7. Communications The ’Iraq police maintain a W/T station at Busaiya. Other communica tions, nil. Transport can move in any direction in this area. 8 . Climate Normal for southern ’Iraq. As the area around Rukhaimiya is at an altitude of some 1,100 ft., nights are usually cold. 9. Tactical The route offers no tactical considerations and the area on each side of the track is generally suitable for operations by armoured cars. 10. Inhabitants As far as A1 Uqubba the area is the normal pasture of the Dhafir, though the Mutair and Shammar tribes occasionally use the wells in the neutral area. When satisfactory rains produce adequate grazing, the Muntafiq shepherd tribes also frequent the area in the winter months.ROUTE REPORT No. 98 BUSAIYA to AS SULMAN (“ F ” track.) Total Distance : —122-6 miles. Authority : —Air Staff (Intelligence), ’Iraq. Date : —30th April, 1934. Map Reference : —1 : 1,000,000, H.38, Basra, 1930 (gridded). 1. General The route is a desert track. It is not surfaced or graded or metalled at any part of its length and, except for the terminal points of Busaiya and As Sulman, passes no permanent habitations. The surface is everywhere gravelly loam, soft in patches at first, but hardening towards the middle and western end, where the track winds between shallow rock outcrop and low ridges of limestone. The route leaves Busaiya in a northerly direction and at Mile 3-5 bears west. Soft patches are encountered at Miles 18, 30 and 31. At Mile 36, in the tails of the Shaib al Ghanimi (A.6301), pools of the “ Ihaqab ” type (see Glossary) surrounded by large bushes, are passed. These contain several feet of water after satisfactory winter rains. Mile 48 marks a short, fairly steep descent into the Zuhra basin, where for some miles going is excellent, over smooth stoneless loam, a suitable dry weather landing ground. Ar Rifai, a bush-studded depression scored with numerous water runnels (dry in summer) is passed at Mile 75 and the long, dark-coloured cliff of Al Galaib at Mile 80. Shawiya, a similar depression to that of Ar Rifai, is the next landmark, at Mile 99, after which the track veers in a south-westerly direction and descends into the enormous hollow of As Sulman at Mile 116. 2. Water The only permanent sources are at Busaiya and As Sulman from shallow pits of the “ hussiyan ” type. Water should be purified before consumption by Europeans. That of As Sulman is bitter to the taste and contains a considerable proportion of Glauber’s salts, with consequent laxative effects. 3. Supplies Nil. Rations for the garrisons of the ’Iraq police and their families at Busaiya and As Sulman are procured at frequent intervals from Nasiriya and Samawa and are sufficient only for this purpose. 4. Fuel Scrub is plentiful (in patches) along the route. Petrol and oil supplies for R.A.F. and police are maintained at Busaiya and As Sulman. 5. Grazing Grazing is dependent entirely on the rainfall. In the winter months of normal years, it is satisfactory for the flocks of the shepherd tribes and fairly good for camels. In summer, all grazing is scanty.313 1&lt;$l Route Report No. 98 6. Obstacles Nil. 7. Camping and Landing Grounds Space for camp sites is unlimited though no water is available, except in winter when precarious supplies are usually to be had from rain pools. Apart from the recognised landing grounds at Busaiya and As Sulman, areas fit for landing are to be found at Miles 20, 48 (Zuhra) and 55 (A1 Haishiriyat). Pilots accustomed to the desert have been able, with care, to land at many other places along the route. 8 . Communications W/T stations operated by the ’Iraq police are maintained at Busaiya and As Sulman. With efficient guides transport may proceed in any direction over the surrounding country. 9. Climate Normal for southern ’Iraq. 10. Tactical The wells and fort at As Sulman are situated in an immense crater-like hollow some 5 miles long and 3 miles wide, which is bordered by a steep cliff about 80-100 ft. high. The cliff can only be surmounted by wheeled transport at certain points which should be occupied by picquets before the advance of a column and which would form suitable rearguard positions for a retreating force. The first 40 miles of the route may be described as generally suitable for armoured car operations. Beyond this the country becomes more and more rocky until, in the vicinity of As Sulman, little progress can be made off the track. 11. Inhabitants The area is more favoured by the shepherd tribes of the riverain areas than by the Beduin, and the flocks of the Bani Huchaim and Muntafiq confederations usually occupy the area from December to March. Dhafi and Shammar Beduins in small numbers sometimes camp in the area. The Dahamsha (Anaiza) occasionally spend part of the summer encamped in the Sulman hollow. Although all are well armed they are unlikely to be hostile to an armed column. Detail The track leaves Busaiya in a northerly direction.

A huge, crater-like depression, roughly oval in shape, 5 miles long and 3 miles broad, surrounded by a cliff 80-100 ft. in height. Recognised entrance for wheeled transport into the depression are situated in the north, on the Samawa track, in the south, on the Takhadid track, and in the north-east on the Busaiya track. Lightly loaded touring cars might, with much labour, effect an entrance at other points. Headquarters of the ’Iraq desert police is located at As Sulman and, in addition to a large stone built fort, a number of new brick buildings have been constructed as administrative offices, police barracks, residences of the Commandant, Officers and Clerks, etc. (i) Water .—A number of water holes, situated at the northern end of the depression, yield brackish water which is impregnated with laxative salts. The pits are 10-15 ft. deep and the supply of water is unlimited and perennial, although when in use by large numbers of tribesmen the wells do not refill rapidly.

Map References :— 1. General (a) As Sulman-Shabicha .—The route leaves As Sulman depression by the only northern outlet. The ascent from the hollow is gradual but very rocky and tortuous. At Mile 4, the top of the cliff is reached and a signpost marks the junction of the “ L ” (Shabicha) and the “ N ” (Samawa) tracks. From the signpost, the general direction is west-north-west and for the first 15 miles the track passes through a featureless area of stony ground with a soft chalky subsoil and occasional rocky outcrops. From Mile 15 the track bears north-west and the country traversed is composed of black flint debris with occasional sandy patches. From Mile 19, excellent going is provided by a firm sandy subsoil generously besprinkled with flint fragments. General direction now west. At Mile 23-5 a signpost indicates the junction of a track to Al Jil. At Mile 25. the flint area comes to an abrupt end and going becomes very rocky for about a mile when the track joins the Wadi Firch and follows the bed of the wadi in a northly direction. Mile 28 track leaves Wadi Firch. Mile 29-5 track veers left and heads straight for Nuhaidain (Salman-Busaiya E.2270) on a bearing of 290 degrees. Mile 33-5 the twin hills of Nuhaidain (“the two breasts”) are reached. These constitute an excellent landmark which can be seen for 10 miles in either direction. Mile 46. The track strikes the Wadi Huwaimi (Salman-Busaiya E.0676) at right angles and follows it in a south-south-west direction for 5 miles. The wadi provides excellent going. Mile 51, the track leaves the wadi and bears west. Going becomes very rocky until the edge of the cliff bordering the Shabicha hollow is reached, at Mile 65’4. Salman-Busaiya Shabicha Wadi al Ubaiyidh317 Route Report No. 103 The descent into the Shabicha depression offers no difficulty although there are several patches of soft sand and a few small wadis to be crossed which call for careful driving. At Mile 67.4 the track leaves the water holes of Sichr 300 yards on the left. From this point to Shabicha the going is excellent. Signposts at Mile 69 show junction of Rahaba track and at Mile 71 the junction of track to Sharaf. Mile 75-3 Shabicha. (6) Shabicha-Ashuriya. —A signpost outside the fort indicates the direction of the Nukhaib track (“ O ”). For the first 11 miles the going is good. At Mile 9-8 the track passes 200 yards to the north of the water holes of Aglat As Salatin. Mile 11 marks the commencement of the very rocky ascent from the Shabicha hollow. General direction west-north-west. The going is stony until at Mile 33 the hills of Saigal (Shabicha Sheet D 2295) come into view and the going becomes very soft. At Mile 41 the track follows the direction of north-west to the well of A1 Ashuriya (Mile 44). (c) Ashuriya-Shanana. —1£ miles beyond A1 Ashuriya the track bifurcates, the right branch leading to Lussuf. A signpost marks this junction. At Mile 3, the track leaves the soft chalky area and enters the Sahan which provides 13 miles of flat sandy ground. The general direction across the Sahan is 280 degrees. At Mile 17, a stony area is encountered which persists for 11 miles ; then comes 5 miles of excellent going. At Mile 30 a signpost marks the junction of the Lussuf-Al Barit track. Mile 33 marks the commencement of 3 miles of extremely rocky going. At Mile 52 the track crosses the Sahab Nauman and stony going is encountered until at Mile 61 the crest of the Zaur ridge is passed and the steep, sandy descent is made on to the Shanana mud flat, which provides perfect going for the 5 miles of its length. 1£ miles north-west of the northern extremity of Shanana mud flat, the Shanana landing ground is reached. Here, at Mile 69, two signposts indicate the tracks to Machmi, Barit, Lussuf, Shabicha and Nukhaib. (d) Shanana-Nukhaib. —“ P ” track is now followed from Shanana to Nukhaib. The route runs parallel to the Zaur ridge and practically straight over featureless gravelly soil which provides excellent going. At Mile 17 the track bifurcates, the left branch leading to Nukhba. This junction is not « marked but the Nukhba branch has not been used for some considerable time and is practically obliterated. 2. Water Except immediately after rain when pools abound, water in large quantities can only be obtained en route at Sichr and Shabicha, and in limited quantities from Aglat as Salatin and Ashuriya (300 ft. deep). 3. Grazing Camel thorn. Grassy hollows are to be found in the winter after rain. 4. Obstacles The Sahan area provides the main obstacle, when, in dry weather, the soft sand makes very heavy going for cars and the track is frequently obliterated by sand storms. The same applies, in a minor degree, to the soft chalky soil in the A1 Ashuriya area. A large proportion of the country traversed is of rocky or stony nature, but this offers no real difficulty, given careful driving. Apart from the Shanana mud flat which can be easily skirted, no part of the route is seriously affected by rain.Route Report No. 103 318 5. Camping and Landing Grounds Camping grounds are unlimited in the desert, but sites are dictated by considerations of water (see para. 2 above). Practically the whole of the area between Shanana and Nukhaib is suitable for landing grounds. 6. Communications By other tracks, details of which are given in para. 1 above.

General (i) The track leaves Nukhaib (S.4120) and crosses the landing ground in a northerly direction. After 20 miles over good country, it joins and runs parallel to the Gurmat al Habbariya, crossing the widespread mouth of the Wadi Shafawi. At Mile 35-0 the track approaches within 50 yards of the Sha’ib Taball, which is a continuation of Gurmat al Habbariya. Thereafter, track keeps parallel to Sha’ib, turning first north-west a.nd then west. At Mile 51-0 the track bears in to the south bank of Sha’ib, which it follows closely with occasional detours to avoid tributaries. At Mile 57-0, near Abu Infug (S.0585) the Sha’ib is crossed. Sha’ib Taball, at the crossing, has precipitous banks and a soft sandy bed with many large rocks (1 ft. of water in April). Though careful driving is necessary, the crossing does not present a serious obstacle. Good going thioughout this section of the route. (ii) The track now takes a northerly course for 7 or 8 miles, first through a rocky ravine and then on to a stony ridge. From here high hills an tributaries of Wadi al Ghadaf are avoided by veering west to south-west for 3 miles The going here is good. At Mile 68 - 0 track bears northrwest and on approaching Wadi al Ghadaf, turns west and follows a course parallel to it until a crossing is made at point R.7996. The crossing is dry and consists of boulders and soft sand. Armoured cars may require assistance here. (iii) From this point track runs slightly north of west for 7 miles when Wadi al Hazimi, a narrow wadi which presents no difficulty, is crossed. The track then runs north-west to Sha’ib al Mu’tadala, a wide flat-bottomed wadi, the bed of which affords excellent going for about 12 miles. At Mde 10U the track leaves the Sha’ib al Mu’tadala and turning north-west runs between high hills for a short distance, then emerges into open country and, making excellent going, joins the main Ramadi-Rutba track at a point about 39 miles east of Rutba. This point is marked by an arrow labelled ‘ Nuk, pointing to Nukhaib. This track, which provides good going, is followed for the remainder of the route.Route Report No. 109 324 (iv) Rutba Fort .—A square building, strongly constructed of stone, with loop-holed walls and bastions for defence.

Radiator water is obtainable at Nukhaib and from the wells in Wadi Sha’ib Taball at Abu Infuq, 3| miles upstream from the crossing. In the wet season radiator water is obtainable anywhere along the two main wadis. 4. Obstacles After heavy rain, the Sha’ib Taball and the Wadis Shafawiyat discharge into the Habbariya area causing a huge lake which, in turn, overflows into the Wadi al Ubaiyidh via Wadi Salugi to the east of Nukhaib. This effectively closes the route until the water subsides, when no trace of car tracks remain. The marking of the track and the crossing of the Sha’ib Taball and the Wadi al Ghadaf would be an improvement. The rocky ravine to the north of the crossing of the Wadi al Ghadaf constitutes somewhat of an obstacle, but as it is only 2 miles in length, it would be possible to clear a satisfactory track.

After heavy rain, the road would become impassable for heavy wheeled traffic for several days, and extremely difficult for light cars for at least 72 hours after rain had ceased. This road is graded throughout to Bir Ugla, and bridges, culverts, and Irish bridges, have been constructed wherever necessary. The road is unmetalled. It is possible to drive off the track almost anywhere. Ihe surface of the road between Mosul and Tall Hugena is hard baked mud, but heavy traffic tends to cut up the surface. After wet weather, it becomes soft and muddy. The surface of the road between Tall Hugena and Nisibin is composed of reddish soil and even after slight rains, all cars would encounter difficulties in traversing this section. After heavy rains it becomes impassable for heavy wheeled traffic for a period of 7-10 days, and for light cars for 24 hours after rain has ceased. The road on leaving Mosul traverses easy undulating country until it reaches the neighbourhood of Kisik Koprii, where it passes through the foothills of Jabal Alan. Afterwards the road again passes through undulating country as far as lall Marag. The remainder of the country traversed is a vast undulating plain. The chief physical features en route are (i) the Jabal Atshan, situated south of, and running parallel with, the road from within a few miles of Mosul to Tall Dula’iya (137 L/SE.- Sq. 10a) ; (ii) the Jabal Alan, situated north of, and running parallel with, the road from Badush (137 L/SE. Sq. 6d) to Kisik Koprii and forming with another range of hills (to the south of the track) a wide gap known locally as the “ Hugena Gate.” Various scattered hills along the route provide excellent direction points. 2. Water (a) The shortage of water is most noticeable at the following stages :— Sabuniya. Tall Marag. Bir Ugla. The water on this track up to Bir Ugla is brackish. From a military point of view, all water on this route is contaminated and requires chlorinating.325 ROUTE REPORT No. 110 M 3 (C 23303) MOSUL to NISIBIN via BIR UGLA Total Distance : —122-8 miles.

General The road is passable in the dry season, that is, between mid April and mid November, for all arms including heavy mechanical transport. After heavy rain, the road would become impassable for heavy wheeled traffic for several days, and extremely difficult for light cars for at least 72 hours after rain had ceased.

The road on leaving Mosul traverses easy undulating country until it reaches the neighbourhood' of Kisik Koprii, where it passes through the foothills of Jabal Alan. Afterwards the road again passes through undulating country as far as Tall Marag. The remainder of the country traversed is a vast undulating plain. The chief physical features en route are (i) the Jabal Atshan, situated south of, and running parallel with, the road from within a few miles of Mosul to Tall Dula’iya (137 L/SE.-Sq. 10a) ; (ii) the Jabal Alan, situated north of, and running parallel with, the road from Badush (137 L/SE. Sq. 6d) to Kisik Koprii and forming with another range of hills (to the south of the track) a wide gap known locally as the “ Hugena Gate.” Various scattered hills along the route provide excellent direction points. 2. Water (a) The shortage of water is most noticeable at the following stages :— Sabuniya. Tall Marag. Bir Ugla. The water on this track up to Bir Ugla is brackish. From a military point of view, all water on this route is contaminated and requires chlorinating.Route Report No. 110 326 (b) Sabuniya (Stage 1). Water is only sufficient for needs of inhabitants. It would be necessary, therefore, to transport water by mechanical transport to the camping ground from the Tigris at Badush via the track which forks right from main road to Badush (137 L/SE.Sq. 12a), a distance of approximately 5 miles. In the event of mechanical transport being unprocurable, pack animals would have to be employed. (See Transport, para. 5.) Kisik Koprii (Stage 2). Ample water is available from two perennial springs and a stream. Tall Marag (Stage 3). There is only sufficient water for needs of inhabitants, and therefore mechanical transport or pack transport would have to be utilised for carrying water from Tall Hugena to the camping ground. Tall Awainat (Stage 4). Ample water is available from wells. Bir Ugla (Stage 5). Water is only sufficient for needs of police post. Mechanical transport would have to be utilised for carrying water from Wadi Damir Qapu (located in French Syria) or from the Tigris at Tall abu Dhahir. Kubur al Bid (Stage 7). Water obtained from stream which decreases in summer and extra water would have to be brought by mechanical transport from Dougheur (Stage 8). Damir Qapu (Stage 6) and Nisibin (Stage 8). Ample water is available from streams. (c) A column of troops marching to Nisibin would require to adopt one of the two following alternatives on account of scarcity of water on this route:— (i) Transport of column by mechanical transport to Nisibin, mounted troops and transport proceeding by route march. (ii) Column marching to Nisibin, and sufficient water supplies being concentrated at Sabuniya, Tall Marag and Bir Ugla. 3. Supplies This would depend on the time of the year and the political situation. Along the route only a negligible quantity of supplies are procurable on demand. The areas Mosul—Tail Awainat and Muhile—Nisibin are under cultivation between November and June. Supplies for troops moving along the route would have to be arranged for in advance through Mosul or Nisibin towns. During the winter and spring seasons, the nomad tribes are encamped in areas south of the Mosul-Nisibin road. During summer and autumn they are encamped north of this road owing to the existence of water in the Suwaidiya area. Sheep in fairly large quantities can always be obtained from these nomads, subject to their being encamped in the vicinity of this route. 4. Fuel huel of any kind is scarce at the intermediate stages along the route Near Qamishliya and Nisibin, wood is available in small quantities. There are ample supplies of firewood, oil, and charcoal, in Mosul to maintain a large force proceeding from Mosul to Nisibin. 5. Transport Motor Transport .—Arrangements for mechanical transport must be made through Mosul town. Animals.—200 camels and 200 mules and donkeys could be assembled at short notice (except during harvest or cultivating seasons) from the villages in the Mosul-Tall Marag area. A similar number of camels could be assembled at short notice in the Tall Marag-Nisibin area—subject to the nomad tribes being encamped in the vicinity of the route.f 327 Route Report No. 110 m 4 (C 23353) 6. Grazing Between Mosul and Tall Hugena there is scant grazing at any season of the year as this area is mainly under cultivation. This also applies to the area Muhile-N isibin. There is an unlimited supply, in season, from 3 miles north-west of Tall Hugena to Muhile. 7. Obstacles There are no serious natural obstacles along the route. Small bridges, if destroyed, could be repaired temporarily by troops in a few hours. 8. Additional Work Requires metalling. After heavy mechanical transport it is probable that portions of the road would require repairs. These could be carried out by troops with local material. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds During winter months, camping and landing grounds could be constructed at most sections of the road, but from January to June crops would have to be cleared. An R.A.F. landing ground with standard markings in snowcrete and concrete exists at Bir Ugla. There is ground suitable for landing grounds at Damir Qapu, Kubur A1 Bid and west of Qamishliya. 10. Communications Roads .— Sabuniya-Tall ’Afar-Sinjar. Tall Hugena-Tall ’Afar. Tall Awainat-Tall Sufaiya (137 L/NW.Sq. 10c). Bir Ugla-Quhbal (137 H/NE.Sq. 36d)-Ain ash Shababit.

Rainfalls between November and April; January and February are usually the months of heaviest rainfall. Periods of floods : February to April. 12. Tactical (a) The occupation of Jabal Atshan and Jabal Alan by an enemy would interrupt communications. (h) The Jabal Atshan from Wadi Helela (137 P/SW.Sq. 7c) to Dula’iya and the Jabal Alan, from Badush to Kisik Koprii would require picqueting. It would be advisable to occupy the north-west end of theRoute Report No. 110 328 Jabal Alan—approximate distance from road £ mile. The Jabal al Qusair (137 L/NW.Sq. 36a and b) would also require picqueting. Flank guards would suffice over the remainder of the route. (c) Ihe greater part of the terrain is ideal country for cavalry and most suitable for aerial operations. Armoured cars could operate over the plains. 13. Rains and Floods (a) Heavy rains would seriously affect the condition of the road, especially between Tall Hugena and Nisibin, which becomes impassable for heavy wheeled traffic for a period of 7-10 days. (b) Unlikely to be flooded except as a result of very heavy rain. 14. Inhabitants The area between Mosul and Tall Hugena is inhabited by sedentary non-tribal Arabs. Fall Hugena and surrounding villages are inhabited by Girgiriyah (Kurds) tribe and Turkomans. The inhabitants of Tall Marag and Tall Awainat are Turkoman and those of Abu Winni are sedentary Arabs. The Iraqi nomad Arab Shammar tribe encamps in the vicinity of this route. The Hassinan (Kurd) and the Jubur (Arab) inhabit the villages on the Tigris in the Zummar Nahiya and the nomad Kurdish Miran tribe also encamps in this nahiya. The area between Damir Qapu and Nisibin is inhabited by sedentary Arabs and also Armenian and other Christian elements. The Syrian nomad Arab Shammar tribe and the Tai (Arab) encamp in the vicinity of this route. The attitude of the tribes of this route would depend on the political situation. In most cases, they are fairly well armed. 15. Alternative Routes There are three alternative routes, viz :— (a) Mosul-1 all Hugena-Tall Awainat—Tall Safaiya-Tall Ras as Suwaidi- Tall Rumailan-Damir Qapu-Nisibin. Route passable for all arms and mechanical transport in dry weather, and in wet weather by cavalry, infantry and lightly loaded animal transport. The section Tall Awainat-Tall Sufaiya- Tall Ras as Suwaidi—Tall Rumailan is fairly well supplied with water wells and would therefore be an alternative route to the main Tall Awainat-Damir Qapu section. (b) Mosul-Tall ’Afar-Ain as Shababit-Gaulat-Quhbal-Bir Ugla. Route passable for all arms including heavy mechanical transport in dry weather. This route could be used in the event of the Kisik Koprii— Tall Awainat main section being held by a strong enemy force. (c) Mosul-Tall ’Afar-Tall Hugena, route passable for all arms including heavy mechanical transport in dry weather. Stages. No. of Distance. Stage. Name. Inter. T otal.

General The road is passable in dry seasons, i.e., between mid-April and mid- November, for all arms, including heavy mechanical transport, but in the wet season, for pack and light cars only. With heavy rains it can easily become impassable for light cars and, in any case, towing cables and spades should then be carried. Between Ain ash Shababit and Suwar, especially around A1 Badi, tajami, and Suwar Bridge, areas of several miles become waterlogged and resemble large bogs after heavy rain. It would be imprac ticable to move a force of any size from Mosul to Deir ez Zor, except by mechanical transport, unless extensive arrangements had previously been made for water transport and supplies. The road is graded throughout to Ain ash Shababit. It is possible to drive off the track almost anywhere. In summer the surface of the road between Mosul and Ain ash Shababit tends to become very dusty with heavy traffic ; in winter, after rain, it is soft and muddy, especially the area around Tall 'Afar, which becomes water logged and resembles a large bog. Between Ain ash Shababit and Suwar the surface is gravel in places, but after heavy rains is impassable for heavy transport traffic for a period of 4-7 days and for light cars for about 24 hours after rain has ceased. The area between Suwar and Deir ez Zor is mainly gravel surface with some soft patches after heavy rain. With the exception of the ground in the neighbourhood of Tall 'Afar, where the route passes through the foot-hills of the Jabal Zambar, the country traversed is easy undulating upland or open plain. A characteristic of the route, most noticeable, is the very large number of wadis or shallow ravines it crosses. Hardly a mile of the road that does not include the passage of one or more of these stream beds with either a culvert, a small stone bridge or an Irish bridge to carry the road across it. In most cases the wadis are of no great depth and the destruction of the bridges would impose little delay on a column. The more important bridges are described in para. 7, Obstacles. Some of the smaller bridges are noted in stages. The principal physical features en route are (i) the Jabal Atshan, situated south of, and running parallel with, the road from within a few miles of Mosul to Tall Dula’iya (137 L/SE. Sq. 10a), (ii) the Jabal Zambar, situated southRoute Report No. Ill 336 of and running parallel with the road from approximately Mile 3 • 5 (Stage 3) to Tall 'Afar, (iii) the Jabal Alan, situated north of the road, (iv) the Jabal Sasan, situated north of the road from Tall 'Afar to Ibrat as Saghira, (v) the Jabal Gaulat and Jabal Sinjar, situated north of the road from Ain Sinu (137 L/SW. Sq. 9c) to Sinjar town. Beyond A1 Badi, a route passable for all arms continues to Deir ez Zor, a town of some 20,000 inhabitants, situated on the right bank of the Euphrates. At Mile 40 from A1 Badi, the Syrian frontier post of Fajami is reached. From this point the road follows closely the left bank of the Khabur River, crosses it at Mile 75 (from A1 Badi) by a suspension bridge at Tall Suwar and passing, in a gentle descent over a flat gravel plain reaches Deir ez Zor at Mile 105 (Mile 205’7 from Mosul). 2. Water (a) The shortage of water is most noticeable at the following stages :— Sabuniya. Ba’aj post. Abu Hamdha. Jo . Bir el Kabash./ byna ' The water on this road is brackish and should be purified for European consumption. (b) Sabuniya (Stage 1). Water is only sufficient for needs of inhabitants. It would be necessary to transport water by mechanical transport to the camping ground from the Tigris at Badush, via track which forks right from the main road to Badush (137 L/SE. Sq. 12c), a distance of approximately 5 miles. Abu Maria (Stage 2). Water is obtainable from two perennial springs. Tall 'Afar (Stage 3). Ample water is available from a spring which flows into a stream. The water is very saline. Ain ash Shababit (Stage 4). Water is available from a perennial spring which flows into a stream. Ain Ghazal (Stage 5). Water is obtainable from a mill stream, which flows from two perennial springs at Tepe Iskhafta (137 H/SE. Sq. lid) and Qara Dagh (137 H/SE. Sq. 18a). Ba’aj post (Stage 6). Water is obtainable from a well (perennial). A1 Badi (Stage 7). Water is obtainable from a well and three water holes. 3. Supplies Dependent upon the time of the year and the political situation. Wheat, barley and sheep in fair quantities are procurable from the neighbouring villages along the route at each stage in the sector Mosul-Ain Ghazal inclusive. No grain supplies would be available from Ain Ghazal onwards until Deir ez Zor is reached and supplies for troops moving along this sector must be arranged in advance through Mosul, Tall 'Afar, Sinjar or Deir ez Zor. Sheep in fairly large quantities could always be obtained from the nomad tribes in the sector 'Ain Ghazal-Deir ez Zor, subject to these tribes being encamped in the vicinity of the route. The headquarters towns of Sinjar, Tall 'Afar and Deir ez Zor would be fruitful places of supply if notice were given in suitable season. 4. Fuel Fuel is scarce at the intermediate stages. At Sinjar town (approximately 10 miles off the route from 'Ain Ghazal) wood and charcoal in small quantities are available and a further supply of w T ood and charcoal could be obtained from the Jabal Sinjar. Wood is plentiful in Deir ez Zor. There are ample1^3 337 Route Report No. Ill supplies of firewood, oil and charcoal in Mozul to maintain a large force proceeding from Mosul to Deir ez Zor. Oil. Agencies of the Rafidain Oil Company exist in Tall 'Afar and Sinjar, but only small stocks are normally held. 5. Transport (а) Motor Transport. —Normally, four or five touring cars in Tall Afar and an equal number at Sinjar. A number of light cars and lorries are also obtainable from Deir ez Zor. Arrangements for mechanical transport should be made through Mosul town. (б) Animals. —Between Mosul and 'Ain Ghazal, 50—100 camels and a similar number of mules and donkeys could be assembled at any stage within 48 hours’ notice, except during harvest or cultivating season. About 200 camels, donkeys and mules can usually be assembled without much notice at Tall ’Afar and Sinjar ; with notice, a large number of camels could be brought to Tall ’Afar or Sinjar, but the number would depend upon the nomad tribal situation and locations. Between ’Ain Ghazal and Deir ez Zor, a large number of camels could always be obtained from the nomad tribes, subject to these tribes being encamped in the vicinity of this route. 6. Grazing The grazing during the spring and early summer is excellent along the route with the exception of Stage 1, where the area is mainly under cultivation. 7. Obstacles There are 12 single-arch bridges, the Ibrat as Saghira bridge (Stage 4) and two suspension bridges (Suwar and Deir ez Zor) along this route. Single Arch Bridges. —Small bridges, if destroyed, could probably be repaired temporarily by troops in a few hours. Most of these are little used, as tracks run round them in dry weather. Ibrat as Saghira Bridge [Stage 4). —The destruction of the Ibrat as Saghira bridge would delay the crossing of this stream during the winter months, but pack transport should still get across. Repairs would be the work of engineers with materials brought from Tall Afar. During the summer, however, the destruction of this bridge would not prove an obstacle to light cars as it would be possible to leave the road before entering the village of Ibrat as Saghira and make a detour north of the spring (137 L/SW. Sq. 10b)— thus avoiding the spring—and rejoin the road west of this village. \\ ith a certain amount of labour, this track could also be made passable for heavy mechanical transport. Two Suspension Bridges. (Suwar and Deir ez Zor).—dhese if destroyed, would be a serious obstacle to mechanical transport. In the case of Suwar bridge, there is, however, a similar bridge over the Khabur at Bessireh which forms an alternative route if the bridge at Suwar is temporarily out of action. 8 . Additional work Requires metalling. Bridges, culverts and Irish bridges are required on certain sections of the road from Ain ash Shababit (Stage 4 onwards). Portions of the road would require repair if in constant use by heavy mechanical transport. These could be carried out by troops with local materials. 9. Camping and Landing Grounds Unlimited space for camping grounds at all stages along the route. Suitable sites for landing grounds exist at each stage of the route. Recognised landing grounds exist at A1 Badi and Deir ez Zor.Route Report No. Ill 338 10. Communications (a) Roads .— Sabuniya-Nisibin. Tall 'Afar-Nisibin. ’Ain ash Shababit-Gaulat-Quhbal-Bir Ugla. ’Ain ash Shababit-Sinjar-Umm adh Dhiban-Hassitcheh. ’Ain Ghazal-Sinjar-Hassitcheh. Fa j ami-Hassitcheh. Suwar-Hassitcheh.

[e) WIT .—Mosul and Deir ez Zor. 11. Climate Normal for Northern Iraq. Rainfall between November and April. January and February are usually the months of heaviest rainfall. Period of floods—February to April. 12. Tactical [a) The occupation of the Jabal Atshan, Jabal Zambar, Jabal Sasan, Jabal Gaulat and Jabal Sinjar by an enemy would interrupt communication’. (р) The Jabal Atshan from Wadi Halela (137 P/SW. 7c) to Dula’iya and the Jabal Zambar, from approximately Mile 3-5 (Stage 3) to Tall ’Afar town would require picqueting. The Jabal Sasan, Jabal Gaulat and Jabal Sinjar command the whole of the surrounding country between Tall ’Afar and Fajami and it would be necessary to hold these if serious opposition was to be expected. If the bridges at Suwar and Bessireh were destroyed the crossing of the Khabur might prove a difficult operation, and the crossing of the Euphrates at Deir ez Zor in the face of opposition would be still more difficult. Trees and buildings on the right bank of the Euphrates at Deir ez Zor would give excellent cover to an enemy, while the left bank is almost entirely exposed for miles in each direction. (с) 1 he country is most suitable for aircraft in co-operation with troops, especially between ’Ain ash Shababit and Deir ez Zor in which area landing grounds are common and an enemy would have no cover in which to conceal himself from aircraft. Provided that Ibrat as Saghira, Suwar, Bessireh and Deir ez Zor bridges had not been destroyed, armoured cars could co-operate with the column during the dry season but between Mosul and ’Ain ash Shababit they would be confined mainly to the roads and motor tracks. 13. Rains and Floods On the whole, and in comparison with other routes, this route withstands rain well. Heavy rain would not seriously affect the condition of the road between Mosul and ’Ain ash Shababit, as stone bridges, culverts, etc., have been constructed over this sector since the winter of 1933. Certain stretches of the road between Ain ash Shababit and Deir ez Zor would be seriously affected by heavy rains as these have not been equipped with stone bridges,etc. (see para. 8). The worst places on the road after heavy rain are indicated under para. 1. The road requires about 7-10 days to return to its normal state after continuous downpour.339 Route Report No. Ill 13 • 0 Sabuniya. Village of ten Arab houses, about 1 mile to left of road. One well of slightly brackish water. 14. Inhabitants The area between Mosul and Abu Maria is inhabited by sedentary non- tribal Arabs. From Abu Maria to ’Ain ash Shababit the inhabitants are Turcomans and sedentary Arabs. Tall ’Afar has a population of about 15,000 inhabitants, mostly Turcomans. From ’Ain ash Shababit up to Ba’aj the inhabitants of the villages north of the road are mainly Yezidis and those south of the road, Arabs. The remainder of the route as far as Deir ez Zor with the exception of Suwar village (sedentary and non-tribal Arabs) is uninhabited, but the ’Iraqi and Syrian nomad tribes, Shammar, Tai, Jubur, encamp in this area. Deir ez Zor has a mixed population consisting of Arabs, Kurds, Christians and Armenians. 15. Alternative Routes (a) Roads .—’Ain ash Shababit-Sinjar-Umm adh Dhiban-Deir ez Zor.

The ground rapidly packs after the passage of a few vehicles, but up to Mile 190-8 there is ample room to move about in selecting new tracks. The established track is, however, faster than breaking new ground. Normal rainfall rarely renders this portion of the route impassable for more than 48 hours, and, after extremely heavy rainfall, 4 days ; but the periods could be shortened for medium transport working in convoy, capable of selecting the drier routes and rendering assistance if any of the units became bogged. The 27 miles west of Haditha (Miles 190-8 to 217-8) form a bottleneck, and whilst deviations are possible over some part of it, there are three actual necks through which all transport must pass. Under heavy transport con ditions, the soil breaks up into very heavy dust in the summer months, and is soft after rain. After normal rainfall the track has, upon occasions, been rendered impassable for 3 days. Up to Mile 217-8, heavy trucks with a gross weight of 120,656 lbs., with a maximum axle weight of 17,709 lbs., on four tyres, can be operated at speeds up to 30 miles an hour over those sections where the going is good. In Stages 6 and 7 (Miles 217-8 to 312-5) the general direction of the track is north-east. Up to Mile 257-0 it runs over gypsum country, which rapidly becomes badly corrugated after much use. This portion of the route is, however, well drained and rainfall rarely renders it impassable for more than a few hours. From Mile 257-0 to Mile 281-2 the track runs through country drained by the Wadi Tharthar. The bridging and road work that has been carried out between these points has diminished the period of impassability after rain from weeks to a few days.351 Route Report No. 112a From Mile 281-2 to 312-5 the track cuts into heavy sand during the summer months, but packs well and provides reasonably good going for heavy transport on the beaten routes. It is little affected by normal rains, but heavy rains will render it impassable for periods up to 48 hours. Heavy trucks, with a gross weight of 120,656 lbs. and a maximum axle weight of 17,709 lbs. on four tyres, have been successfully employed, and tractor trains with a maximum weight of 58,240 lbs., giving ground contact pressure of approximately 28 lbs. to the square inch, have been operated after the heaviest rains. No attempt has been made to divide the last 67-4 miles (Baiji to Kirkuk) into stages. From Baiji (Mile 312-5) to Mile 325 • 4, the track takes a northerly course over an engineered road (Route No. 18—Kirkuk to Tall ’Ali and Tikrit). At Mile 315-1 the Mosul road (Route No. 49) forks to the north, and at Mile 323 • 1 it crosses the ferry at A1 Fat-ha. From Mile 325 • 4 it runs in a north-easterly direction to Kirkuk. This part of the track is little affected by normal rains, but heavy rains will render it impassable up to 48 hours. Miles 323 • 1 to 333 • 1 are passable at all seasons, as the route runs through broken country and is well drained. From Mile 333-1 the route runs across irrigated and cultivated country. After normal rains the route is impassable for practically all transport for two days, and after heavy rains it has been found impossible to get transport through for periods of 10 to 14 days. During the dry season, heavy trucks with a maximum gross weight of 67,540 lbs., with a maximum axle weight of 15,015 lbs., on four tyres, have been successfully operated. The route could be considered open all the year round for tractors. 2. Water From the wells at the I.P.C. stations, H.3, H.2 and H.l. Water is also supplied to H.3 by road tankers from Rutba, and to H.l by a 3-in. pipeline from the I.P.C. station T. 1 (approximate Map Reference I.37.d.xi.3.2). At Haditha it is obtainable in unlimited quantities from the Euphrates. At Baiji it is obtainable in unlimited quantities from the I.P.C. water tank at A1 Fat-ha Gorge and from a 1,000-gallon (approximately) water tank at the railway station. At Kirkuk, unlimited good water is obtainable from the Qadha Chai and by pipeline from the wells 3 miles north east of the town. No other known sources of supply exist along the route except at Yachi village, where there are irrigation channels and karezes which contain water throughout the year. For details see stages. 3. Supplies A limited number of sheep are available at Rutba. At Haditha a plentiful supply of sheep and goats, rice, dates, flour, barley, and dried fruits is available if due notice is given (i.e., 24 hours). Baiji. Supplies by road and river from Mosul or by rail from Baghdad, if previous arrangements are made. Kirkuk could support a brigade throughout the year. 4. Fuel Limited quantities of scrub are available along the route. At Haditha, unlimited quantities of firewood (scrub) are available from the islands in the river. There is no fuel between Baiji and Kirkuk. The I.P.C. refinery at Kirkuk supphes only enough oil for its own consumption. 5. j Transport (a) Animal .—Large numbers of horses are available at Haditha, and at Kirkuk large numbers of pack animals and donkeys. (b) Vehicular .—Very limited and mostly used for military purposes. The I.P.C. might supply a number of lorries.Route Report No. 112a 352 6. Grazing There is no grazing country up to Mile 44 • 2, but from this point to Rutba locality, grass is available in limited quantities between December and April, and camel thorn is abundant in the Wadis Hauran and Abaillah. In Stages 3, 4 and 5, between December and April, there is grazing throughout the route for sheep and camels. In Stage 8, from the beginning of December to the following April, there is excellent rough grazing. This spring growth is, however, very light and by mid-April it is burnt up and the terrain assumes a barren aspect, save only along the banks of the Tigris. 7. Camping and Landing Grounds Unlimited throughout the route, except in the neighbourhood of the broken ground in the vicinity of the river crossing at A1 Fat-ha and from Yachi (Mile 370-9) to Kirkuk. There is an R.A.F. aerodrome at Kirkuk (I 38.a.v.4.6) and a defined landing ground at Baiji (I 38.c.iii.5.9). From the frontier to Baiji, landing grounds exist at Mile 0 (L.G. 13), Mile 22-3 (L.G. 12), Mile 44-3 (H.3), Mile 99-7 (H.2), Mile 158-3 (H.l) and Haditha (Mile 217-8) (I 38.d.i.3.1). 8. Obstacles Mile 217-8. The 11-arched stone bridge across Wadi Haqlan (I 38.d.i.3.1) entering Hawijah Arban on the Baghdad track. Mile 218-6. Here the river Euphrates is crossed by two ferries (I38.d.i.4.l) both of which are owned by the I.P.C., and are always available. They are described below :— (а) An overhead cable ferry, capable of transporting up to a maximum weight of about 8 tons (loaded Leyland lorry). T-his ferry takes from 7 to 10 minutes to cross the river. A special grapple is necessary for cars and arrangements should be made with the I.P.C. to have one available. (б) A boat ferry which can carry three armoured cars and three light cars— maximum weight carried is 18 tons. The time taken for one load of cars to embark, cross and disembark at the other side, is approximately 20 minutes. This ferry is propelled by means of a large rudder surface set at an angle to the current of the river and direction is maintained by means of a pulley running on a wire cable. Mile 323-1. The ferry facilities at A1 Fat-ha are as follows :— (a) An aerial cableway operated by a petrol engine which will take a loaded lorry, total weight not exceeding 3^-5 tons. (b) A ferry capable of taking one small loaded lorry or two small cars, operated by a motor boat hired by the I.P.C. (c) A ferry, privately owned, capable of transporting one small loaded lorry or two small cars, operated by oars. This ferry is for public hire. 9. Climate Sub-tropical. Normal for Central ’Iraq. 10. Tactical At Mile 104-7 the track winds along the Wadi Ubaid which at this point has escarpments about 50 ft. high ; the bed is 500 yards wide. No alternative route. Track is covered by flanking fire. At Mile 176-9 the hills of Tall Ubaid,353 Route Report No. 112a (C 23303) N approximately 200 ft. high, command the south flank of the track to Mile 198.5. At Mile 228 • 8 the track reaches the highest point of the plateau, from which the oil tanks of Haditha can be seen approximately 8 miles distant, to the north-north-east. The main features of the route from Baiji to Kirkuk are the passages through the foothills of the Jabal Mak-hul (I 38.b.iv.5.1) and the Jabal Hamrin. (a) The route could be commanded by an enemy from the following points :— (i) Heights of the Jabal Mak-hul and Jabal Hamrin overlooking the route and river crossing at A1 Fat-ha. (ii) The ridge from I 38.b.iv.6.2 to b.iv.7.2. (b) Picquets might be required at the following points :— The passages through the foothills of the Jabal Mak-hul and Jabal Hamrin. The remainder of the route is open desert and has few tactical features worthy of note. The ground on each side is suitable for the movement of armoured cars and tanks, except in small portions as detailed in stages. 11. Inhabitants In the last stage, most of the villages on this route are occupied by the Jubur tribe. At present they are peaceful but their attitude in the event of hostilities is uncertain. Their total armed strength is 900, including 430 mounted. 12. Rains and Floods See para. 1. 13. Communications (a) Telegraph and Telephone .—The I.P.C. private line along the route. This line links with the ’Iraq telephone systems at Haditha, Baiji and Kirkuk. W/T installation at all I.P.C. stations. (b) Roads .—At Mile 70-1 (approximately) the route crosses the Rutba- Damascus track and at Mile 213-0 the Ramadi-Al Qaim track. At Mile 312-5 the Mosul-Baghdad route is met and followed until Mile 315-1. (c) River .—From Haditha, down river only, to Hit by shakhturs. From Baiji the river is navigable up to Mosul at high water for river craft having a draught of 3 ft. 6 in. or less. Rafts (kelleks) loaded up to 12 tons can proceed to Baghdad at an average speed of 3-3-5 knots in the low waiter season. (d) Rail .—Baiji is mtf^standkrd gauge track. Kirkuk is the railhead of the Baghdad-Kirkuk metre gauge track. 14. Alternative Routes If the bridge which spans the broken country crossed by the track just before entering Haditha from Baghdad in the direction of I.P.C. station H I is destroyed, the alternative route entering Haditha from the south-west past K.3 aerodrome would have to be taken. This alternative route is badly corrugated. From Baiji to Kirkuk, Route No. 18, which leaves this route at Mile 325-4 and rejoins it at Mile 368-0, 2-9 miles west of Yachi, could be used.Route Report No. 112a 354 Stages N°. of Distance. Stage.

The route crosses a main road (Mosul-Kirkuk) running north-east to south-west at point I 38.b.v.4.5, and at 379*9 (67*4). enters Kirkuk. Kirkuk is a large town situated upon both banks of the Qadha Chai. It has about 7,000 houses, mostly built of juss and stone, and a population of 40,000. The old town, known as Qala, lies on the left bank of the river and contains numerous tortuous alleyways. The only road passable for 'wheeled traffic is that from the bridge going north along the bank of the Chai to Mosul, Arbil and Sulaimani. The Chai is spanned by a stone and juss bridge of 15 arches, 115 yards long and 15 ft. wide. It will take one heavy lorry, but arches would need strengthening in the event of continuous military traffic. During the summer, this bridge need not be used as there is a ford north of it which is suitable for all traffic. The new town, which lies on the right bank and which, known as Qarwait Kahaliya, is rapidly increasing in size owing to the operations of the ’Iraq Petroleum Company. The new town contains the Sarai, Government buildings, official residences and a barracks which will accommodate a brigade. From the Sarai, two roads cut through the town, one to A1 Fat-ha and the other to Baba Gurgur. The latter is a private, 5-metre, oil road, which was built and is maintained by the ’Iraq Petroleum Company. The road to A1 Fat-ha is suitable for one-way traffic only and that to Baba Gurgur for light mechanical transport. The town possesses three hospitals, two good hotels, its own electric power station, ice factory, and other modern conveniences. (i) Water. —Unlimited.
