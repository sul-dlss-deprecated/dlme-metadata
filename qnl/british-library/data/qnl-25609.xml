Section 3 [88900] No. 1. Mr. \Vratislaw to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 31.) ^ 91, Victoria Street, London, December 21, 1914. I HAVE the honour to enclose herewith some notes on the demarcation of the Turco-Persian frontier from Mohammerah to Vazneh. I have, &amp;c. A. C. WRATISLAW, (Late British Commissioner, Turco-Persian Front ier Commission .) Enclosure in No. 1. Notes by Mr. V ratislaw on the Demarcation of the Turco-Persian Frontier from Mohammerah to Vazneh. A DETAILED description of the frontier line has been drawn up by the Commission in conformity with the provisions of the Constantinople Protocol of the 17th November, 1913, and the considerations on which it is based are fully stated in the proces-verbaux of the Commission, but it is as well to recapitulate it in general terms, indicating the points which presented especial difficulty, and which may possibly give rise to questions hereafter. It is convenient here to note that the fundamental principle which the commissioners were bound to follow throughout was the restoration of the status quo of 1848 (date of the Treaty of Erzeroum), and that the frontier of 1848, so far as it can be discovered, was by no means an ideal one, its deficiencies and anomalies, indeed, having led to the critical relations between Turkey and Persia which originally called for the mediation of Great Britain and Russia. From Ararat to a few miles south of Mendali, the protocol indicated with some detail the general line which the frontier should follow, wffiile the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of the 29th July, 1913 (embodied in the protocol) provided in the same manner for the frontier between the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, and Umm Chir. From Umm Chir, however, nearly to Mendali, the Commission was left a freer hand, it being understood that the status quo was to be restored as far as possible. The first difficulty occurred in connection with the extensive swamps between parallel 31 and Umm Chir. No landmarks exist in this locality, there was no dry passage through the marshes, nor could any channel be discovered coinciding even approximately with the frontier line as laid down by the protocol. The only solution therefore was to lay down a line on the map, and even this could not be made to follow throughout a line of longitude owing to the provision of the protocol by which “ a small lake called Azem ” was to be left in Turkish territory. However, the nature of the district and the extreme paucity of its inhabitants render any disputes unlikely unless at some future time the marshes should be drained. From Umm Chir to the Duvarij River, a distance of about 27 miles, such local testimony as was available indicated the Shatt-el-Amma as the status quo frontier between the territories of the two Empires. The Shatt-el-Amma is the ancient channel of the Duvarij, and is boldly marked on the identic map. In practice, however, it was found to be difficult to trace it throughout its entire length. Portions of the old channel are still broad and deep, but in parts the main bedmas degenerated into two or several courses, which in some cases are little more than ditches, and the Commission was sometimes at a loss to decide which was the real Simon Pure. The mounds of earth erected to mark the frontier line as laid down in these doubtful sections are liable to be carried away by floods, and any dispute will have to be decided by the map. The district is entirely without fixed habitations, but is frequented at times by Arab shepherds, mainly Persian subjects. [2318 hh —3] i2 From the Duvarii to the River Tyb the frontier follows first Jebel Fokka and then Jebel Hamrin both low ranges of sand hills. The country traversed is quite barren, but affords pasturage at certain seasons to Arab flocks from Turkish territory. It is difficult to believe that this section'can ever cause serious misunderstanding, and the map should be a sufficient guide to the frontier, though it was not piacticable to erect p bounda^ marks sand being the Mother side of Zorbathia contains the two districts which Imve given rise to the Wd Ha sa'n^ lli the whole frontier question, viz., Bagsai and the lands of beyjid Hassan. ilieir importance arises from the fact that they are comparatively well-watered, and therefore capably of cultivatiOin the fvontier coincides with the junction of the Pushtikuh foothills and the Mesopotamian desert. AH the evidence before the Commission Cvbich wns not so conclusive as could have been desired, and was found mainly m the writings of Dervish Pasha and General Tcharikof the Ottoman and Russian representatives on the first Commission) indicated that the status q«o in this direction was die hill country to the Persians, i.e .,the Vali of Pushtikuh, a semi-autonomous chieftain and the plains to Turkey; and on the strength of this testimony and geographical considerations, liagsai was awarded to Turkey and Seyytd llassan to PershT as the least unsatisfactory compromise of which the circumstances permitted. The Bagsai district lies entirely in the plain, and therefore fell to iurkey m conformity with the principle adopted by the Commission that the territory of 1 ushtikuh stopped short at the foot of the hills. The “lands of Seyyid Hassan are situated in a gap between the two ranges of hills, and geographically appeared to-belong rather to the Mbs The drawba 1 c ^ s to this settlement are (1) that a small part of the Bagsai fields have for long been cultivated by subjects of the Vali of Pushtikuh, and (-) that the small Turkish town of Zorbathia and its date groves depend for their water supply on the River Goundjiun-Tchem, which first irrigates the “ lands of Seyyid llassan, and that the possessor of the latter territory could, if maliciously disposed, divert the The first ohiection was met by establishing the principle that the private proprietary rights of the Vali should be maintained at Bagsai, while m the second case it was hoped that his good behaviour would be secured by the hostages he gave m ms property at Bagsai, and also at Zorbathia where he is a considerable owner. Hie right hank of the Groundjiun-Tchem is also left in Turkish territory nearly as lar as \ the head of the Seyyid Hassan Valley. + -o i • i;v om i After Sevyid Hassan, the frontier passes along Mount Bend-i-kouiik, and, following a nearly continuous chain of low hills, joins on to Djebel Guerebi, the point to which the protocol brings the boundary down from the north, and distant about 10 miles south-west of the Turkish town of Mendali. From here onwards the Commission had only to apply on the ground the directions of. the protocol, a task which was at times rendered difficult owing to the inaccuracy of the identic map on which the protocol was based. n Apart from the frontier, the Commission was instructed to decide the question oi the division of the water of the Guenguir River between the Persians and lurks. This stream rises in the Persian mountains to the north-east of Mendali, runs for some 40 miles through Persian territory, and then passes through Mendali, the extensive date groves which surround the town absorbing almost all the water For many years the water question has given rise to acrimonious disputes between the townspeople and the Persian kurds who cultivated the valley of Somar through which the Guenguir flows before reading Mendali. In winter and spring there is enough water to irrigate both Somar and Mendali, but in summer when the river is low it barely suffices lor Mendali alone. The townspeople for several generations paid rent to the Persians lor the water, but a few years ago they settled the question in an arbitrary fashion by forcibly driving out the ]mrds from Somar and burning their settlement. The Turkish Commissioner declared that Mendali required the whole oi tlie Cuenguir water, and he therefore proposed that the Turkish Government _ should either^buy the entire water rights or become proprietor of the Somar Valley either by purchase or exchange, which the Persian commissioner also agreed was the bes solution. It was first necessary to ascertain what proportion of ^ the water belonge equitably to either side, and the Commission decided that they ought to be regarded as owning equal shares in a river which ran through the territory of both. The needs of the people of Mendali were certainly the greater, hut I do not seewhat otliei pioportion could justly have been fixed. No arrangement has apparently been come to yet between the two Governments, and the matter is complicated by the tact mat me Vali oi Pushtikuh has by some means become owner of the Somar Valley. / 6 honoured .the Commission by a visit at Bagsai, and did not impress us tavourabiy. lie manifested bitter and unreasoning hostility towards the Turks, of whom he spoke Constantly as “my blood-enemies.” The Persian Government seem to have little control over him. . to my absence through illness, Captain Wilson was in charge of the British commission while the section from Mendali to the Sirvan River was being delimitated. The southern portion of this section, from Mendali to Kasr-i-Shirin, is quite the most barren and desolate tract dealt with along the whole frontier, and is completely abandoned by the nomad tribes once the summer heat has set in. This year, fortunately, the season was quite a month behindhand, and it was found possible to complete the work without incurring undue hardships. Tlie only important question which arose was connected with the right of pasturage of the Sinjabi (Persian) l^urds on territory which was formerly a no-man’s land, and is now placed definitely on the Turkish side of the frontier. The arbitrating commissioners expressed the formal opinion that these rights should be maintained. Northwards of Kasr-i-Shirin the frontier begins to follow, in the main, well-defined watersheds and rivers, and there should be little opening for subsequent disputes. One notable exception exists, however, in the Nowsoud district, immediately north of the Sirvan. Here an ideal frontier was present to hand in the shape of that river up to the lofty Avroman range, and then the summit of the range itself. Unfortunately, j at some time prior to the Treaty of Erzeroum, Persian j^urds had taken possession of certain villages on what should have been the Turkish side of the natural frontier, and the status quo thus formed was necessarily recognised in the protocol. The Commission had therefore to do its best with unpromising materials. The district is full of villages lying in the midst of extensive groves of walnut and mulberry trees, and in some cases there are ‘Continuous plantations extending from a Persian to a j Turkish village with no line of separation between the properties of the two. This ! was notably the case between the villages of Khan Guermele (Persian) and Biare (Turkish), where the properties overlapped one another to a considerable extent, and it was found impossible to run the frontier between the two without leaving Turkish orchards in Persia and vice versa. The matter was complicated by the water supply being common to two or more villages, the Persians usually having the advantage of the up-stream situation. Our solution, arrived at after a minute study of the local conditions, though probably the best of which the circumstances permitted, cannot be regarded as entirely satisfactory, and it may have left a door open to petty quarrels. A somewhat similar situation arose in connection with the village of Tchamperaw (latitude 35° SO'). The protocol instructed the commissioners to decide the fate of this village “ sur la base du principe accepte du statu quo,” and all the evidence procurable tended to show that at the time of the Treaty of Erzeroum, Tchamperaw was Persian. Unfortunately, it lies on the Turkish side of the watershed forming the frontier both east and west of it, and the unavoidable departure from this natural feature resulted in a clumsy compromise with an arbitrary line of demarcation between the fields of Tchamperaw and the adjoining Turkish village of Siah Guvez. From this point onward as far as Y T azneh, where I finally left the Commission, the frontier follows well-defined natural features.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.] r&gt; PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA. ■4 7 C Q [March 2.] CONFIDENTIAL.

This declaration is, except for a few unimportant verbal alterations, identical with the statement previously signed by us under date of the 15th (26th) May, for the information of our respective Governments. M. Minorsky refused at that time to make a joint declaration on the subject to the Commission.

I n vp /vr* A. T. WILSON, Captain I.A., British Commissioner, Turco- Persian Frontier Commission. Enclosure in No. 1. Captam Wilson to Sir L. Mallet. (No. 50.) Sir, Camp Barduk, August 26, 1914. 1 IN continuation of my despatch No. 48, dated the 1st August, I have the honour to submit, for your Excellency’s information, the following report upon the proceedings of the Commission subsequent to that date :— 2. News of the outbreak of war in Europe was received in camp at Margawar on the 4th August. The intelligence was received with undisguised satisfaction by the Persian Commission, who hoped that Russia’s preoccupation in Europe might bring about the evacuation of Azerbaijan by her troops, and they were correspondingly dejected when, two days later, they learned of Great Britain’s participation in the war. 3. The return to Russia of some of the Russian troops at Urmia, exaggerated by local rumour into a complete evacuation of the district, caused much anxiety to the villagers, mostly Christians, along the frontier, and a corresponding elation amongst the Kurds. At the same time the Turkish troops on the frontier professed to fear an attack by Russian troops from Urmia and vice versa, and the resulting unnecessary movements of small bodies of troops on both sides of the frontier served to increase the general nervousness. M. Minorski and I decided that the best thing was to proceed ourselves at once to Urmia to ascertain the facts, the rest of the Commission continuing to demarcate the frontier along the watershed. We reached Urmia on the 5th August, followed a few days later by the Persian and Turkish Commissions. 4. I had hoped to leave Urmia by the 10th instant, but my colleagues showed no anxiety to return to the frontier, and it was not until the 18th August that, after several postponements, the next meeting was held and a further section of the frontier settled, bringing us to “ Mont Zont ” (Khizan), at which point, according to the protocol of the 4th (17th) November, 1913, the frontier leaves the watershed and crosses the Arzin River at right angles. 5. The provisions of the protocol concerning the frontier from this point to Kotoul Dagh are surprisingly vague, seeing that M. Minorski has more than once visited the locality, and would appear to have had ample opportunities to prepare a correct description of the status quo line. The Persian and Turkish commissioners found themselves unable to agree upon the frontier between Khizan and Sari Baydost, and accordingly had lecourse to arbitration during the sitting of the 20th August. The necessary pillars were erected on the morning of the 21st August, the afternoon being devoted by the technical officers of the British Commission to observations of the eclipse of the sun, which -4frontier alone the western border of this district, which involved the passage of three irontier along ills v &amp; f to ; n the protocol, though all are clearly streams, only one of which was referr ^ ^tn of M Millorski an J shown on the identic map. pp ra ; an colleaeues, after some persuasion, agreed at myself, however, our Turkish and Persian colleagues y . a single sitting upon the watershed wWchTs followed till close to Kotom&gt;. where the frontier rises again to the waters , „ , r ,1 , distance of some It is of interest to note that between Khizan and Kotoul Dagn, a aistance 01 some 16 mi es it has been nece ssary to erect no less than twenty-five pillars m order to ' A.

A. G. Wratislaw, C.L., G.L.G. and the Secretary to the Commission, hr. G. E. Hubberd, who had come out from England arrived by the same steamer. Captain A. T. Wilson i Deputy Commissioner was already at Lohamerah making preliminary arrangements, while Captain A. H. Brooke, 18th K.G.O. Lancers, , commanding the dscort, and Captain H. W. lierpoint, I.L.So, medical Officer joined a fortnight later. Captain B. L. Dyer 93rd Burma Infantry was also attached as transport officer. We found a good camp, pitched by Captain Wilson, in readiness in the desert just outside the palm groves of Lohamerah; the Russian Commission being located in a house in the town. The Russian Commission consisted of at a later stage their survey staff Y/as increased by the addition of Lieutenant Colonel Krimeikoff. and escort. and various officers in command of their escort.

Salar kuzaffar military Adviser. Abdur Hezagh Khan Survey officer and two topographers, a medical officer and escort of Persian Cosacks of varying strength. As I have, in my report to the British Commissioner, attacked, given full details of the professional work carried out by our Survey Party and those of the other nations, I propose here only to give a short narrative of the principal incidents that occurred during the 11 months over which the work of the Commission extended. The Persian Commissioner had arrived with the Russians by sea, but the rest of his staff came over land from Tehran, and did not arrive, as did the Turks till the middle of January. Pormal exchange of visits still further de^red the commencement of serious business and the first full meeting of the Commission was held on 21st January in a fine house belonging to the Chief Linister to the Shaikh of Lohamerah. A large proportion of the frontier had already been settled on paper and was embodied in a protocol signed by all four nations, the work of the Commission being that of actually demarcating’ the the wholofrontier on the ground and settling the outstanding questions, the protocol containing a very sound agreement that all matters on which the Turkish and Persians differed were to be settled on the spot by a reference to the arbitration of the Biitish ana Russian Commissioners. Without this provision no progressprogress would have 'been made, as it does not require much imagination to grasp the fact that the Turkish and Persian Commissioners v/ould never agree of their own accord* The frontier along the Shatt-el-Arah was the left or Persian hank, and the Commission only had to make a trip in a steamer down to the mouth of the river to make !t une acte de Presence” and mark the frontier line on the map, another similar trip up river taking us to the point where the frontier left the river and went off into the desert towards the ruins of Kushk-i-Basri. At this point the first pillars were put up, a sheep sacrificed, speeches made, and a heavy lunch given hy the Shaikh of Koh&amp;merah gave the work of demarcation a good start and lent an air of great geniality to the proceedings* Kushki-Basri over 30 miles from Mohamerah was somewhat difficult of access owing to the lack of water, however hy going up the Karun Eiver for a day hy steamer we got within 20 miles of the place, and marched across the desert. Be here had our first experience of desert work, the long weary marc.; , ays in signt of camp hut never getting there, the heat in the day time, wicu its attendant mirage, the cold at night and on our return journey when heavy rain had turned the hard dry desert into a slippery marsh, the difficulty of making any progress at all, all formed an interesting first experience hut one which we had repeated too often during the next three months to appreciate its real delights. A curious feature we noticed was the large number oi parallel lines, having the appearance of canals filled in ; something in the soil on these lines was different, as small hushes grew more frequently there than in the rest of the desert, their v/iuui was from two to four yards and in places they converged wimi arl cue appearance of railway sidings, many theories were advanced out we came to no conclusion as to the origin of these lines. Having put up our pillars near kusnk-i—rasri we returnee to Mohammerah to make preparations for our lurther advance. On 14th February we made our final start each commission marching separately, three long marches up the right hank of the Karun /Karan Eiver, and an equally long, one across the desert brought us to Kut Saiyid All on the Kharklia P.iver, which we crossed the sane afternoon, and having done so halted for two days, one day for rest, and another on account of a stom of wind and rain, which brought down several of our tents and rendered marching 1 impossible owing to the mud. The Khar Mia is a fine river 100 yards wide with a fast flow of fresh water. This river used to irrigate a large tract of country but having changed its course the greater part of it now flows in to the hugh marsh, extending up to the banks of the Tigris, and is lost therein. A simple dam with canals leading therefrom could easily render the tongue of land between the Kanin river and the Tigris once more fertile and able to support a large population. The Arabs in these parts mostly inhabit the banks of the river and marsh during the summer, their huts on both hanks ox the river extending for several miles and turning the river into one long street; they graze their flocks during the winter or rainv season in the desert. Our next two marches to Bisairtin were done by boat, landing occasionally for snipe and partridge shooting while our caravan followed tne land route, h* Ml on 21st February we caught up Major Gowie and the Surveyors who had been working ahead and all marched together 10 Urn - i* ? wnicrx had been agreed upon as the next meeting place ox tne OomnissiciL , a point at which the frontier line issued from tne marsh into which we had consigned it west of Kushk-i-Basri. A week’s halt here made us all the more anxious to get on. as our start from Mohammerah had been very late in the seas:; , and the weather was already beginning to warm up. Froiu here to the Dawairij Eiver, a distance of 26 miles the Identic map proved very unreliable and the old bed of the Snatel—Arnmah wnicn x-aci been laid down as the frontier was in many places hardly visible having been filled up by moving sand dunes. Another week’s xlhxi at the Dawairij Bivor was caused not by the dilatory metnods of our fellow Commissioners this time, hut by a very heavy flood.The English Coiranission had camped in' the bed of the river but jgffirtunately crossed the next morning through the rising water, though we had to move our camp twice to higher ground before we felt ourselves safe from the effects of the flood. For several days the river amused itself by cutting away the bank, large masse* of which fell constantly into the river with a loud roar like thunder. The other Commissions were unable to cross the Fiver for several days, and then did so witl difficulty. Once across however the work progressed with some rapidity as our surveyors had not been wasting their time. We had now reached the foot of a low range of foot hills thrown out to the south of the Pusht-i-Kuli range, the hills remaining in Persia, while the plains inhabited by Arabs were left to Turkey, he followed the foot of this range for 3 days arriving at the Tyb Fiver on the 11th March. Yet another week ! s halt here, rendered very unpleasant by the disgusting nature of the only water we had to drink, concentrated Epsom salts was our verdict. The increasing heat and lack of potable water rendered the work of surveying and demarcation very arduous. After leaving the Tub Fiver we had to march away from the foot of the hills into the desert, camping a night at Oara Tapah, a small mound from which we could see passing boa£s and a steamer on the Tigris, and reaching Baksai on the 19th March, again put in a prolonged hal .. This was in fact our usual custom and unavoidable; at these halts the immediate frontier was settled in detail while often a good streten of frontier ahead of us was also fixed in general terms, and Bub Commissions, consisting of a representative from each Mission, ere sent out to put up necessary pillars while time was thus given for our survevors to get on with their work well ahead of the main body. Baksai and the lands of Saiyed Hassan 30 miles distant had long been in dispute between the Turks on the one side, and the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh on the Persian side, and finally a compromise was effected, disliked by both parties and therefore probably fair. Our departure from Baksai was followed by a severe intertribal fight, both sides having many killed and wounded, the fight taking —- —' ,l ' 1 —''N /Mi \ ' taking place in the presence of some Russian and Persian Officers who had remained behind* Re arrived at Zurbatieb, a small Turkish Town on 6th and Lendeli on 10th April where hr* Wratislaw left for sy Baghdad on account of his health, not rejoining us till Qasr-i- | Shirin* 1 endeli a prosperous little Turkish town, surrounded bp I palm groves and orchards depends for its water and therefore its existence on a stream issuing from Persian territory. The right to use this water had long been in dispute, the Tali of Pusht-i- Kuh often threatening to divert the water and so bring pressure to bear on the Turks to admit his claims in other directions* As usual a compromise was effected, and we entered on 17th April an unpleasant tract of country from which already on account of the heat the nomads had cleared out. Oil wells were here in dispute, and had to be arbitrated on. Brazing was scarce and water bad, but we were relieved by a storm of wind one night which levelled all tents to the ground, followed two days later by a very welcome 1 downpour of rain. On 25th April, assisted by a short bout of cooler weather we arrived at (sasr«i~Shirin, where a general halt had been decreed to give every one a well earned rest, the neighbourhood of Baghdad enabling the Turks and others to enjoy a little civilisation; our time there was not however wasted, fair maps were prepared as far as hendeli and despatched for publication, descriptions of the frontier were compiled and. a general refit of kit etc. was found, very necessary, hr. Raji Abdul Rahim with some khalasis, and ten of the escort returned from here to India via Baghdad. The ruins in the neighbourhood of Qasr-i-Shirin could, well repay a more careful examination than we were able to make. Leaving &lt;&gt;asr~i-Shirin on 11th hay and marcning via the Zuhao plain we reached Rawisi, a small village at the foot of the Bamu m^ountain the following day, and from there entered hilly country, and crossing the Sirwan River on the 22nd arrived at Balkan on the 25th hay. Rain that day and having reached an elevation of 4700 feet brought the temperature down 20° and rendered the prolonged halt at this place and Biare one of the pleasantest we had.had. Trie Avronan range on which snow still lingered towered above us, while the narrow valleys were filled with walnut, mulberry and other fruit trees through which flowed sparkling brooks of cold water fresh from the many springs for which this range is famous. Our halt here was due partly to the intricate nature of the frontier which cut across these fertile valleys, and partly to the local Turkish Officers not having received orders for the evacuation of a post they occupied within Persian Territory. These matters having been satisfactorily adjusted we marched once more on 11th June and dipping down to a plain at a height of 1900 feet (maximum temperature 106° ) crossed the Avroman range by a low pass, Ohakan and camped at Piran, a pretty spot with a pleasant climate. Our stay here was however a disastrous one, as the Persian Doctor, Hussain, met with an accident while out shjiooting, and had to have his right hand amputated. This he hore with great pluck and won our admiration hy his cheer fulness under depressing conditions, he accompanied us, in charge of Captain Pierpoint, as far as Wazneh. Major Cowie triangulating and our surveyors doing the detail survey had worked so well ahead that in the next week we were able to demarcate a long strip of the frontier arriving on 23rd June at the village of Tchampar-av where the frontier left the watershed to include this village in Persia. Prom, here onwards we were well amongst the Kurdish uplands and only went below an elevation of 4000 feet to cross the Lasser Zab Biver on 2nd July. It had been a great strain on every one, owing to our late start, in having thus to push on with the work during the heat of the summer, hut we could now see ahead of us a probaoilitg of Completing the demarcation of the frontier before winter set in, very much earlier in fact than had ever been thought of in previous estimates of the time required. We were now in the neighbourhood of Latitude 36° and the Bussians after some delays took over the main topographical work. The fine upland plain of Wazneh was reached on 17th July •/July height 5300 feet and even there the maximum temperature was always in the neighbourhood of 90°. Here, to our great regret Hr. ITratislaw was obliged to leave for England on-Jick leave. Captain Wilson succeeding him as Commissioner, and Lieutenant-Colonel Ryder becoming Deputy Commissioner in addition to his own duties. le left Tazneh on 24th July, and the following day entered the treiess tract which continue# right up to mount Ararat, and renders the scenery decidedly monotonous. From here onwards the frontier followed with a few exceptions a well marked watershed, forming a natural boundary. It never has and never vail however be a true frontier as the Kurds from either side cone-t^ into the hills for the summer and by mutual arrangement amongst each other, one finds Turkish]6 tribes grazing their flocks on the Persian side and vice versa. This watershed was easy oi demarcation as it was only necessary to place pillars on the main passes, a work carried out by small sub Commissions while the main body of the Commission for convenience of transport could keep to the main roads further away from the frontier, and thus reached the small Persian town of usnnu on 28th Jung* Oiu malt of four days was enlivened by the genial hospitality of a detachment of Russian troops stationed there. Leaving Ushnu on End August we turned again towaro.s # the frontier reaching Hargawar next day and that aiternoon received news of the outbreak of war although it was not till three days later that we heard of our being involved therein. The work of demarcation however continued, but a move was made into uiumieu (bn 8th August to be nearer a telegraph office and to give every one, another well earned rest. Here we were again the recipients of warm hearted hospitality from tne Russian garrison. The political horizon being now cloudy the halt at Li r uni eh was cut short and the Commissions leaving on 15th August moved out again in two marches to the frontier where tne boundary nad ° to be demarcated across valleys situated a march apart. EachEach of these necessitated halts of a few days, after which the main body of the British Coimnission under Lieutenant Colonel Ryder marched for hot our, while Captain Wilson accompanied the other Commissions demarcating along the watershed. Passing through the valley in which Kuhne Shahr is situated we turned again ingto the mountains to cross on to the Turkish side. On 31st August we arrived at the small Kurdish village of Ushnok and that afternoon while out shooting were attached by a Party of armed Kurds resulting in hr. Hubbard being’ severely wounded. Arresting the guilty Parties and to give hr. Hubbard 1 s wound time to heal necessitated several days halt; Captain Wilson rejoined and moved down to Khoi with Captain Pierpoint in charge of hr. Hubbard, who then had to be invalided to England. The Commissions moved on to Kotour, where we arrived on the 6th September, en route obtaining our first view of Lount Ararat, a vision which spurred every one to push on with the work, the end of which was thus in sight. The delimitation of Kotour, where the frontier line has to cross a valley, forms a history by itself, many attempts have been made all resulting in failure, and once more we have to acknowledge defeat, and leave it undemarcated, a length oi. a, miles in a frontier of over 1100 miles forming the only portion of the delimitation which had to be left incomplete. On*- 1 September the Turkish Commissioner announced that he had. received orders to cease work, and we all set to work to complete maps descriptive of the frontier etc. These being completed up to Kotour, our Turkish colleague announced that he had received orders to omit Kotour and continue work to tne nortn. inis oeing agreed to we left Kotour on 18th September, not before naving made a complete map of the district for future us* , .-a gi ossed over on to the Turkish side. On 22nd September major Cowie, Captain Brooke and the escort left to join Captain Wilson at Khoi, from whence they left for India. The above two Officers with Captain Dyer proceeded via Julfa to Batoum where they caught up Captain Hierpoint and hr. Hubbard and although the DardanellesDardanelles were closed they were able to reach Constantinople by sea, and thence by rail to Dedeagatch and by steamer to Portsaid. The escort, under Jemadar Tiwakli, with surveyor Sijawal Kh.gn and •') khalasis, marching via Kermanshah and Ispahan reached L'ohammerah in January. Tlio Ooimriissions continued up the Turkish side demarcating the frontier as far as Kazli-gueno', on the Persian side, which was reached on 27th September, a halt here was necessary for a rather intricate piece of demarcation, but a severo snowstorm on 2nd October drove the Turkish Commissioi} into Bayazid, while the /^remainder moved down to Kilissa Kendi and thence on 6th October to Bazirgan where Captain Wilson rejoined us. This was our last camp and one which we were not sorry to see the last of. The Turkish Commissioner never rejoined from Bayazid and his place after some delay was taken by his Deputy; however three weeks of patience and y/e were able to complete the work across the last valley and up the lava slopes of mount Ararat to the neck joining it to Little Ararat and were able to have a final seance on 28th October and march into Baku that evening. A week previously hr. Slier Jand and Hamid Gul had left with our few remaining men to march via Tabriz to the Persian Gulf. Captain ’Tilson and Lieu tenant Colonel Byder drove on 29th October in pouring rain into Shah takhti 35 miles, the nearest railway station on the Julfa line, here next morning we heard of the Turks having bombarded the Black sea ports; realising that this meant their joining in the Bar, and closing the Constantinople route, we sent our servants with Hr. Abdul Alim to catch up Hr. Slier Jang T s Party, who got through to Bushire towards the end of January and travelling ourselves under the good auspices of Captain Tshahakaya reached Tiflis on 1st November. Staying fife there only a few hours we left the same night after a rousing reception from the crowd at the station, and reached Baku on 2nd. Be then decided that it was inadvisable to travel across Persia by ourselves, and that it would be best to go to Petrogradh, so staying one night at Baku to avail ourselves of the company of Mr. 'ilbon, the Xing's messengermessenger travelling from Tehran to Petrogradli, we left on 3rd and reached Petrogradh on 6th hovemher. Tie were then advised to take the Archangel route and leaving the same night, arrived there on 8th kovernber, and after a delay of several days finally got started, “broke our way through the ice in the river, and got out to the open sea. Cur route lay well into the Arctic Circle, passing the Korth Cape, latitude 71°, then hugging the Norwegian coast and steaming- down the Fjords through magnificent scenery, and great cold, as the whole country was then under snow, and being fortunate enough to see the Aurora Borealis on two nights, we reached England without incident on 21st November.In any further communication on the subject, please quote No - 81455/14. and address— The Under-Secrctary of State, • Foreign Office, PH London, Foreign Office i' ] : F Q ^ D 4 c «'* e r 23th, 1914, , :~v j /'\ fj ’ .y 1 \ Ai / X\v° \\j / Kj / Sir:- / I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you, herewith, to be laid before the Marquess of Crewe, copies of reports which have been received from Mr. Wratislaw and Captain Wilson, \ /A/ O 6 Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner^respectively, on / ^6 recent Turco-Persian Frontier Commission, containing yi y y^ an appreciation of the services rendered hy the members of tne staff selected for the purposes of the Commission.

X 1 / Ml A i ( Sir: - I have the honour to submit the following remarks in connexion with the Staff of the British Section of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission for the period during which I had the honour to be Chief British Commissioner. Captain Wilson has already furnished a report on the % subject, and our remarks necessarily overlap to some extent; but I am reluctant to deny myself the privilege of adding my tribute to the services of gentlemen who lent me such loyal support and efficient assistance. The European Staff consisted of the following officers:- Captain A. T. Wilson, C.M.G',, Deputy Commis sioner (and subsequently Chief Commissioner); Lieutenant- Colonel C.H. Ryder, D.S.O., R.E., and Major H.M. Cowie, R.E., Survey Officers; Captain H. W. Pierpoint, Medical Officer; Captain A.H. Brooke, 18th Lancers, Commanding The Right Honourable Sir Edward Grey, Bart., K.GM , M.P.,^ormianding the Escort; 'Captain F,L&lt; Dyer, 9ord Burmah Infantry, Transport Officer; and Mr. G. E. Hubbard, His Majesty’s /ice-Oonsul at Mosul, Secretary. Io is difficult to overest.ima.te the services rendered by Captain Wilson. All arrangements for the camping, transport, and victualling of the British Commission con sisting of over a hundred men and some two hundred and fifty animals were entirely in his hands, and trie fact that not only did our own system work like clock-work with no approach to a hitch in a journey of many hundred miles through a desolate and difficult country but that also the British Commission was always able in case of need to come to the aid of the other Commissions, speaks volumes for tne forethought and skill with which Captain Wilson formed his plans and carried them out. It was largely due to nis energy and talent for organisation that it was found possible to bring the task of the Commission to a successful conclusion half a year sooner than was originally antici- patec ana just in time to avoid the collapse which the entry of Turkey into the present war would otherwise have entailed. In dealing with the natives of the localities throughthrough which we passed Captain Wilson was particularly successful, and amidst his multifarious duties he found time to collect a mass of inforaation concerning them and the regions they inhabit which should prove very valuable hereafter. During about half the life of the Commission Captain Wilson was in actual charge of it, and he finally terminated the work successfully on Mount Ararat last month. The duties devolving on Lieutenant-Colonel Ryder were two-fold. As head of the British Survey Party he organised ana supervised the topographical work of his numerous staff in addition to executing much technical work himself; But his most important functions undoubtedly arose in connexion wi^i the joint work of the four Commissions end his rela tions with his foreign Colleagues. It is easy to conceive circumstances in which deplorable friction might have occurred amongst officers of four different nationalities all appointed expressly on a footing of equality to execute a controversial end delicate task. Thanks, however, to Colonel Ryder's tact, his great popularity with his colleagues, and the personal ascendency he was able to acquire, ‘ UI //' ( ■■ i acquire, the-moat complete harmony reigned throughout amongst the .urvey Staffs. To avoid confusion in the aor/ey work it was essential that one officer shoulo take the lead, and it seemed tacitly admitted from the beginning tnat Colonel Ryder should do so and this with tne happiest tesults. both the Turkish and Persian Cotaraissioncrs showed, complete confidence in Colonel Ryder and were always ree.oy co aoce -L his statement on technical points r.s final n ' i ''’ Ilia su t?;e3tions as to what v*oul d be a, fair com- V™” 1 ** wh0n a question arose which could not be solved on its-merits« Colonel Ryder attended all meetings of the Commission • .,c, Mo a-cvice was always of the greatest value, i venture to submit that the services of Captain [son and Colonel Ryder merit some special recognition arm to recommend them warmly to your favourable considers- tion. ajor Cowie vae particularly concerned with the carrying out of a fresh triangulation along the whole j rentier necessitated by the inaccuracies of the previous vey end the insufficient records left by his predecessor sur onon the first Commission. He was required to work for tne most part in advance of the Commission under arduous conditions which entailed on him considerable hardships. 1 understand that it is quite unusual for the elaborate computations connected with triangulation to be worked out pari passu with the actual operations, but Major Cowie by indefatigable industry and unfailing accuracy was able to attain this result and never kept the Commission waiting for a single day. Captain H. W. Pierpoint performed his duties as Medical Officer to the British Conrdssion admirably. The reputation he earned along the whole frontier as a -akil ful medical man ready to treat any sufferers who chose to present themselves was of very great value in securing us a friendly reception from the inhabitants hundredfof whom profited by the opportunity. It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that Captain Pierpoint saved Mr. Hubbard's life, and I am deeply indebted to him personally for unwearying and skilful attendance. \Vhen Dr. Hussein, the Medical Officer attached to the Persian Commission had the misfortune to blow off his hand through a gun accident. Captain Pierpoint was calledin to attend him and subsequently placed hie services at the disposal of the Persian Commission, an obligation of which vy Persian Colleague was most sensible. Captain A. H. Brooke, as Commander of the escort detached from his regiment, was in charge of the arrange ments for safeguarding the British camp and our caravan on the a arch through a somewhat sa,v age country. He carried out this duty with great success, end the exemplary conduct of the men under his command speaks well for the discipline he maintained in their ranks. Captain F. L. Dyer was mainly employed in collecting end escorting convoys of provisions from less uncivilised parts of the frontier districts which furnished but little in the way of supplies. This important duty entailed extra marches amounting in the aggregate to several hundred miles with no European society and often under very trying concitions and the punctuality, diligence and unfailing cheerfulness with which Captain Iyer carried it out deserve the fullest recognition. Captain Dyer's thorough know ledge of the Persian language proved very valuable. Mr. Hubbard was nominally Secretary to the British Commission, but the failure of the Russian Commissioner f- !t0 P rovide himself with a secretary and the fact that the Turkish and Persian secretaries were not in a position to render any but very meagre assistance caused the duties of Secretary to the Frontier Commission as a whole to devolve on him. This implied attending all meetings of the Commission, keeping notes of its proceedings, drawing up the Proces-verhaux in French and keeping the Central Archives in order, besides his fundamental duties as Entish Secretary, The amount of labour thus entailed was very considerable and left Mr. Hubbard but the slighest margin for needful relaxation. It was only by conscien tious industry, ability and self-abnegation that he was able to cope with his work which he succeeded in doing not only to ny complete satisfaction but to that of the other Commissioners who repeatedly expressed their appreciation of his services. Towards the end of the Commission Mr. Hubbard was the victim of an unprovoked attack by Kurds and received a severe gunshot wound which caused and still causes excru ciating pain, and which while at the best entailing a lor S and tedious convalescence may possibly result in permanent injury.injury. I vanture to hope that Mr. Hubbard's services and misfortune may not be forgotten in his future career. I should wish to associate myself entirely with what Captain Wilson has said regarding the British Indian Staff and more particularly with his recommendation of Shere Jung Khan Bahadur, I have, &amp;c., (Signed) A, C.

To The Right Honourable AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, Sis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 10th September 1915. Sir, We Lave the honour to invite a reference to Lord Crewe’s Secret despatch No. 1, dated the 8th January 1915, regarding the services of the officers of the Government of India who were employed on the late Turco- Persian Frontier Commission. 2. In compliance with the request contained in paragraph 2 of the despatch referred to, we caused to he conveyed to all concerned an expression of the appreciation of His Majesty’s Government of the services they had rendered, and added that His Excellency the Viceroy cordially endorsed that appreciation. As a recognition of his good work on the Commission, Lieutenant-Colonel C. H. D. Ryder, D.S.O., the officer in charge of the British Survey party and afterwards British Deputy Commissioner, has been appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire, while the title of “ Khan Sahib ” has been conferred upon Munshi Abdul Alim, the Head Clerk and Accountant. 3. With reference to the concluding sentence of Lord Crewe’s despatch, we have had under our consideration the question of according a further general recognition of the services of those officers and subordinates who served with the Commission. We have come to the conclusion that, having regard to the try in o' climatic and other conditions under which they worked, and to the highly satisfactory manner in which they, without exception, discharged their duties, some further reword, hus been well eorned 5 niid thot such lewoid may suitably take tbe form, usual in cases of this kind, of one month’s extra privilege leave. We therefore recommend that, with the exception of Indian military ranks and followers, who have already been granted special leave which was admissible to them under departmental rules, ail officers and subordinates of the Government of India who were employed vith the Commission may be granted one month’s special privilege leave, on the same conditions as those proposed in the Financial despatch fiom Lord Guizon s Government, No. 268, dated the 20th July 1905 and sanctioned m Mr. Brodrick’s Financial despatch No. 113, dated the 13th October 1905, but with the modifications— (a) That the period during which the concession will be available will be two years from the termination of the war. *(b) That the concession mil not he admissible in the case of officers or V J subordinates whose service with the Commission lasted for a shorter period than four months. 4.

The Right Honourable St. JOHN BRODRICK, His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla ) the 20th July 1905. Sir, In our telegram No. 2253-F., dated the 21st June 1905, we informed you that we propose with your approval to grant certain concessions to the members of the Seistan Mission on their return to India in consideration of the very long time they have been absent and the hardships they have endured while employed on this special duty. 2. In framing our proposals we considered the concession recently granted vide our Financial Despatch No. 384 , dated the to the Aden Boundary Commission which 20 th October 1904 . \ s substantially the same as that given in all recent cases of the kind. Had we followed this precedent the concession would have consisted of the grant of one month’s privilege leave which officers might avail themselves of in two alternative ways :— (a) They might take it along with other privilege leave to which they were entitled, subject to the limitation that not more than three months’ privilege leave could be taken at a time. If an officer had three months’ ordinary privilege leave at his credit, in addition to the one month’s special privilege leave, he could take three months at once, and would then still have one month at his credit, which he could take subsequently under the ordinary rules. (b) They could take it in combination with ordinary privilege leave, and with furlough, under the rules relating to combined leave. In this case also they could not take more than three months’ privilege leave as part of the combined leave. Thus, if an officer elected the first alternative method (&lt;2) he would get the full benefit of the concession in exactly the same way as all other officers to whom it has been granted in the past; but if he elected the second alternative method (b) he would in the present case gain nothing by the concession as the effect of the long leave taken would be to cancel the balance of privilege leave remaining at his credit. Such balance would in most instances be a month or nearly a month as, owing to the long period the Mission was at work, most of the officers employed thereon would have three months’ privilege leave to their credit without any special addition thereto. In order to make the latter alternative effective it was suggested that the officer might be allowed to add the extra month’s special privilege leave to whatever amount of such ordinary^ leave he might have earned at the time of his return to India with the Mission : but as this course would have violated the salutary principle which limits the amount of privilege leave to be taken at one time to three months, we were unable to accept it. Since 1897, when the practice of rewarding special duty by the grant of extra privilege leave came into vogue, we have consistently adhered to the principle that in no circumstances should more than three months’ privilege leave be taken at one time. Therefore in order to make alternative (b) effective in theI case of officers who wish to take combined leave, the only course open was to rule/^' as proposed in our telegram, that although the combined leave shall not include more than three months’ privilege leave, yet the excess over three months which may, with the concession, be due, shall not be cancelled by the taking of the furlough which forms part of t^e combined leave. On return from such leave the officer would retain the balance of his privilege leave to his credit, as in alternative (a), and would be allowed to avail himself of it when such leave is again ordinarily due to him, provided that the concession is taken advantage of within three years from the ist July 1905. This modification of similar concessions which have been ranted in the past is, in our opinion, reasonable and we trust that it will meet with your approval. If so, we would further request that we may be authorised to sanction the concession in all cases of the kind which may occur in the future and in which we think the circumstances justify it. 3. The concessions recommended in our telegram for the Native Military ranks, followers and subordinates are of minor importance and call for no explanatory remarks. We have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servants, (Signed) CURZON. „ KITCHENER. „ E. R. ELLES. „ A. T. ARUNDEL. „ H. E. RICHARDS. „ E. N. BAKER. „ C. L. TUPPER.pHHPl Copy.
