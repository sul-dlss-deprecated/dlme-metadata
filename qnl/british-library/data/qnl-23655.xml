I have received a further Note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying: (i)^ Receipts and other credit documents, issued to pilgrims at ports of emoarkation and elsewhere in respect ,01 prepaid fees, dues and charges, should be made out both in Arabic and the official language of the country concerned, (ii) All amounts received a nd relevant details should be shown in such documents. (iii) Bookings for different classes of transport at different stages of the pilgrimage within the Hejaz are not acceptable, e.g. a pilgrim must not be allowed to book a first class bus fare from Jedda to Mecca and a third class fare from Mecca to Arafat. Charges for transport from Jedda to Mecca and Arafat and back to Jedda should be for one class, and similarly for the journey to Medina. This does not of course' imply that transport charges must be precollected. They may be paid after arrival in this•country. (ivj The receipts should oe given a serial number, and should bear the pilgrim's name and nationality and the number of his or her pilgrim pass. (v) In case the receipt should be lost a copy should either be made on the pilgrim's pass or attached to the pass. 2, _ I am pointing out to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the season is ia already well advanced and that it may be too late for many pilgrims to comply with these regulations or for the authorities in British territories to make the necessary clerical arrangements.

This information enabled the British authorities to make the necessary administrative arrangements for the many Arab and Indian pilgrims in their territories wishing to travel to Saudi Arabia.The first document in the file (folio 2) is a circulation slip dated 3 August 1941, indicating that the Political Agent, Bahrain sent copies of the Pilgrimage Tariff and Guide Book for the 1941-1942 pilgrimage, to the following Bahrain and British officials: Adviser to the Bahrain Government; Publicity Officer in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain; Residency Agent, Sharjah. A copy of the Pilgrimage Tariff and Guide Book, which was published annually by the Government of Saudi Arabia, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is not enclosed in the file.The main documents in the file are: two telegrams from the Charge d’Affaires, British Consul, Jeddah, 1947 and 1949; a memorandum from the Political Agent, Bahrain, 1949, to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and the Clerk-in-Charge, British Residency, Sharjah. These contain the following information about the Saudi Arabian Government’s modifications to the pilgrimage tariff for 1947 and 1949: the requirements for pilgrims to keep receipts for all fees, dues and transport costs; to travel in one class of transport within Saudi Arabia; the exemption from fees for pilgrim children, introduced in 1947.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Hadjaz</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Muslim pilgrims and pilgrimages</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0000af#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
