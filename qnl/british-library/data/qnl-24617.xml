My Lord With reference to the latter part of my Tel. No 138 of the ?th inst. I have the Id nour to report that I Explained to Tewfik Pasha yesterday how the Emir of Dhal^s Sheikh at Lakmat es Saleh had been ejected by a Turkisn armed force of four hundred men and his rival, a Turkish partizan^ installed in his place. I did my besu to convince HoE. that the proceedings of this sort were entirely contrayy to the understanding between the two Govts, to maintain, pending further enquiries, the Status Quo existing when the delimitation wq.s proposed an&lt;A I urged that it fell upon the Ottoman Authorities to rectify their mistake and to find means Of persuading their nominee to retire. The Minister explained that when I spoke to him on this subject some days previously ha.had consulted the Grand Vizier who while inclined to admit the Justice of ny demands yet observed that I had insisted upon the Turk ish troops withdrawing from Lakmat es Saleh, and that it wfldb difficult if not impossible for the ottoman autho rities to compel the present Sheikh to withdraw without sending an armed force into the country for that pru^.os§ and to this HoTf. presumed I would not agree. I said that I did not think it would be necessary to send'a military Force but thfitt' it w&amp;di' was their duty to get &amp;im out afr and thet I had little doubt that if they told him that v they could not any longer support him, in consequehce o f the arrangement they had come to with H.M.Govt e Marquess of r.ansdowne K.G. *c^7 Ac. Ac. hehe would probably not attempt to remain. The Minister bought that whether he withdrew or not would entirelyyupon the degree of local support on which he could count. He would however report my remarks to the Grand vizier and see what could be donee We had then some conversation about the meetings of the Commissioners and we agreed in thinking that if j they did not make mor4 progress we should neither of us live to see the termination of their labours. Tewfik Pasha said th&amp; he had tcDld the Grand vizier some time since that it was absurd fd&gt;r them to refer smalli and peoty question)^ to their rtprtoentatiTC respective Govts,, that he for his part was unable to deal with such matters and thahne thought the delegates s oulu e instructed to proceed with the demarcation of the frontier and only reserve a few of the main questions for decision between the central Govts* I expressed my satisfaction at hearing H.H« use this Language and I bagged him very earnestly to persuade the Grand Vizier and the Minister of war to telegraph ■ in this sense to the Ottoman Commissioners.

P.— With regard to my telegram of 24/A November, a report has reached me from Colonel Wahab, under date of 12/A December, that recognition of the inclusion of the Taffai among the nine cantons is still refused by the Turkish Commissioner. TJntil the Turkish Commissioner receives distinct orders from the Forte that the Yaffai are recognised as one of the nine cantons, and that the frontier line is to run in a north-easterly direction from Dakmat-ash- ■shuab, between the Mares districts and the Shaibi districts of the Yaffai, it will be impossible to proceed with demarcation to the north-east. In continuation of my telegram of 11th December, I have to report that Colonel Wahab is still at Dthali.

My Lord, I have the honour to report that I drew the atten tion of the Minister forforeign Affairs on the let inst. to the various incidents reported in the Aden (0^ : ' CSldenVs Tel - of the 30th ult.repeated to rne, and T 1 laid beforej special stress upon the fact that a shot had been fired into the camp of our frontier commis sioners on the 24th ult. apparently by the iA Arab levies who were reported to be withdrawn in the day but replaced at hight. The Minister lost no timein reporting my remarks to the Grand Vizier and seemed genuinely distressed at the repetition of these incidents and complaints on both sides which delayed and interrupted the work of the Commission. Teofik ^asha has since informed me that the Grand Vizier has telegraphed to the Turkish Commissioned , tin substance of my complaints and impressed upon him the necessity of avoiding Incidents such as those related. H.H. added however that what we call A rab levies are simply native Arabs who are apparently opposed to the delimitation, and that as the Turkish troops have been withdrawn the Turkish Authorities have no longer the power of controlling them. I maintained that H.M.Govt had a right to expect the Marquess of Lansdowne K.G. &amp;c. &amp;c. mmthe status which existed beffceethe °ttoman troops had improperly occupied several places in the dis puted territory should be restored and that for instant no opposition should be made to the return of the 'heikh to Lakmat-es-Saleh. r c this the Minister replied that if his people did not wish to recog nise him his attempt to return might create distur bances and they could not employ 'urkish troops to maintain ordee as we §ad insisted on their evacuating the country. I confess it is not clear to me why the British do not summon the Turkish Commissioners categoric ally to proceed together to delimitate the N.E.Fron tier. I cannot think our delegates would incur any risk even if the Turkish escort is larger then their own, while the presence of the two forces would overcome any opposition on the part of the natives and the Turkish oramissioners would share the respon sibility of any delay or untoward event, should the Turkish Delegates refuse, for one reason or another I think I can undertake that positive orddrs will be sent to them to act conjointly with the British Commis sioners. I again saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs yester*- day. I infonped H.*\ of the intention to strengthen the garrison in order that the numtaers of the British Commissioners • escort should not be inferior to the Turkish forces as I had pointed out to him the pre vious day was the case. I also told him that our object in doing so was in no way aggressive and that HisHis Majesty's Govt was anxious it should not be niisinteipieted by the Imperial Govt, I invited H.E's observations but he mede no ciio simply ripbliad that he would report to the Grand Vizier.

I HAVE the honour to forward herewith copies of two letters received yesterday from Hodeidah respecting the state of affairs there. ^ Various vague reports have been reaching Jeddah during the last ten days that Italian war-ships were bombarding, or about to bombard, that port; and a rumour just brought from Suakin avers that Hodeidah (? meaning probably Medi) was bombarded two or three days ago. It is not for me to presume to offer reflections upon Italian policy in the Red Sea, and. my information is as yet very scanty. Still it may be observed that within ten days Italy has on two or three occasions threatened Hodeida with immediate direct castigation upon slight provocation. The Turk has not foigotten the high-handed action of the i( Volturno in June 1899. Whether this time it would not have been more simple and sufficient for Italy to compel payment of an indemnity (of 4,000/. demanded, as I am told) at Constantinople, instead of adopting the painful and offensive course now pursued, that Government alone can decide, knowing best its own true interests. One result of the bombardment will be increased fanaticism and hatred of Europeans on all this coast and at Mecca : even if the desired effect of destroying a nest of Arab pirates and smugglers be attained. I here venture to submit some conjectures as to causes contributory to the present state of mischievous excitement, which may, perhaps, act as sidelights on the situation. Hodeidah can be regarded as one of those Eastern towns where local faction bursts now and again into a vigorous blaze; just as at Van years ago, constant contention and bitter rivalry raged between the two families, Jameshji-Zade and Temir-Oglu. At Bagdad and Konia at various times a precisely similar condition of affairs has been observed, and, no doubt, other examples could easily be found. The local Governor usually favours one party and checks and represses the other, who exert themselves in all sorts of unscrupulous ways to procure the dismissal of that Governor in the hope of reasserting their power and influence under his successor. At Hodeidah the rival parties were Sureya Pasha and a. Notable named Harazi, who was sent to Jeddah a prisoner three or four years ago, but was set at liberty within a few months. The bone of con tention was the farming of the octroi duties of the town, which produced a considerable sum : before 1895 it was usual for Sureya Pasha to purchase annually the right to farm these dues at a low rate, not improbably employing bribes to support his tender; but Harazi, having entered the field of competition, both bidding and bribes ran high. Needless to enter into details of this conflict, but serious accusations were eventually lodged against Harazi with the result above mentioned. About two years ago Sureya Pasha, suffering from a painful disease, had to go to Egypt, where he was operated on, and treated successfully by a young Greek doctor. The Pasha engaged this physician to come to Hodeidah to attend him, promising protection and support, and in due course [2259 aa—3] MLf lie was nominated Mumeipality n ° ct j r e'jdeViwtif a Tur::i-!i diploma; but he :rrry^“-3;v'.b:Lrs ^ -«—»- r doctor, who early last month susp - f ’ t ; ne anc i 0 f interrupted business, &amp;c., Doubtless the fear of the njakdy and of q^ine,^ p J^ enemies may would produce an excite,1 state ^J^t the doctor left the place.

I BEG to confirm my cablegram to you of to-day’s date, informing you that I am unable to leave for Camaran, as my presence is urgently needed here. On the 12th evening the Italian cruiser “Piemonte arrived at Hodeidah from Venice, and was followed on the 15th instant by the Italian gun-boat Caprera At the same time, it was reported there were two other war-ships of the same nationality in this quarter of the Red Sea, the “ Barberega” [ ? ] at Medi, and a fourth at Lohyeia The four above-mentioned ships were specially sent out by the Italian Government to suppress piracy in the Red Sea and to obtain redress from the local authorities tor raids recently made by piratic Arab bands from Medi and the tribes of Beni Marwan and Beni Hakami on the Island of Dahlak, near Massowah. _ . , , 1 . ,. , Failing to obtain satisfaction after four days’ negotiations with the local Mutessaril and the Vali of the Yemen, the Commander of the “ Piemonte” presented an unltimatum to the Local Government on the afternoon of the 16th instant demanding: 1. The surrender of the Chiefs of Medi and of the tribes ot Beni Marwan and Bern Hakam, with their arms, property, and sambouks, on board the cruiser Piemonte by 8 a.m. on the 18th instant. 2. Or that an important Representative of the Government proceed on Medi on board the Italian war-ship with full powers to adopt measures for the capture and surrender of the above-mentioned Chiefs aided, if necessary, by the Italian forces. Should the Government refuse to comply with the first demand, the Italian Commandei threatened to bombard Hodeidah, Medi, and Khor-el-N ahla at 8 A M. on the 18th instant, or should the Chiefs be not delivered on the war-ship £ ‘ Piemonte ” at Medi five days after its arrival there, be (the Commander) notified that he would return to Hodeidah to execute his threat. I cabled immediately to the Commander of His Majesty’s ship &lt;c Harrier ” at Penm, requesting his presence here to protect alll British interests. The above-mentioned gun-boat arrived on the afternoon of the 17th instant, and is lying in port at present. The ultimatum was replied to by the Local Government at 7 a.m:. on the 18 th instant, when Colonel Riza Bey and Fahrin Bey, a Secretary of the Yemen Vilayet, proceeded on board the “Piemonte ” as Delegates on behalf of the Yemen authorities to accompany the Italian Commander to Medi, and take steps in co-operation with the Italian war vessels to capture the three Sheikhs demanded. The Italian Commander accepted the reply of the Yemen Vilayet, and friendly relations have again been established between the Local Government and the Italian Consulate.V One hundred and fifty troops from this the 18th to assist the Italian Commander, n ^pd in the direction of Medi. i The cruiser “ Caprera ” left for Masso sailed for Perim last night. port and 250 from Lohyeia sailed for Medi on 1 wo battalions of infantry are also being wah on the 18th evening, and the “ Piemonte ” were ckculTLVu^otstnigtl 666 ' a Stat6 ° f eXCitement ’ and dis( l uietin g Under these circumstances, I consider my presence at Hodeidah is urirentlv necessary. 11 I have cabled the subject ot the ultimatum to His Majesty’s Ambassador at the 1 orte, as also to the Naval Commander-in-chief at Malta.

The Solution.— In regard to the repression of piracy in the Ped Sea, on account of which Commander Arnone took action, a complete agreement has been concluded between the Italian Government and the Sublime Port on the following bases:— 1* All the pirate sambouks at present being blockaded in the neighbourhood of Midi will he destroyed, where this has not already been done, or the sambquks have not already come into the possession of Commander Arnone. 2. The Turkish authorities formally pledge themselves to inflict exemplary punishment on the above-mentioned Turkish pirates. 3. Further, the Sublime Porte formally undertakes to hand over within two months, at Massowah, such pirates of Erythraean origin as are designated by Commander Arnone, and have not already been arrested. 4. The Sublime Porte finally undertakes formally to repress piracy in the future with the utmost energy. 5. An indemnity of 15,000 fr. will be paid to the families of the two sailors killed at Midi, and another indemnity of 19,600 dollars will he paid as compensation for damages previously inflicted on the Erythraean Administration by the pirates.

They refuse to re-establish the status quo, and demand that until the final decision has been arrived at by Government the present status should be maintained. Wahab has agreed to this demand and to a proposal to postpone the completion of the survey of disputed tract. It follows that Amir of JDthali will continue to be excluded from his territory which the Turks took forcible possession of after it had been decided to demarcate, also that the map to form the basis of information for the two Governments will have to be completed from existing maps. The Turkish Commissioner, moreover, denies that Tafai and Aulaki are among the nine tribes, and continues to claim Shairi country as Turkish. Until these claims are yielded it seems impossible that demarcation north-eastwards can be begun ; and until the Dthali boundary has been settled it will be difficult to find the starting point for this demarcation.

The reply given to the Turkish Charge d Affaires was that, though we did not believe that the alleged preparations had been made, we would make inquiry. We had, however, serious ground for complaint, in the manner in which the Turkish Commissioners were endeavouring to evade the execution of the instructions that had been sent to them. On this subject Sir N.

' ^ Foreign Office, OV(5XJOiruJrC/\98 .—From Resident, Aden, 11th November 1902. {Repeated to Bombay). V.—Following message from Wahab is transmitted :—“ Turkish Com- “ missioner, owing to mistake in transmission of the name, declined to “ evacuate Jabal Suheb without further reference to the Forte. lie has “promised to withdraw from Mtfari and Jihaf It is desirable that “ British Ambassador should explain the Turkish post indicated is Jabal “ Shahad or Suheb, vinmediately south-east of Jaintla.” It appears from Wahab's letter that Turkish Commissioners will not go beyond the actual letter of their instructions regarding the withdrawal of their regular troops. They refuse to re-establish the status quo, and demand that until the final decision has been arrived at by Government the present status should be maintained. Wahab has agreed to this demand and to a proposal to postpone the completion of the survey of disputed tract. It follows that Amir of Bthali will continue to be excluded from his territory ivhich the Turks took forcible possession of after it had been decided to demarcate, also that the map to form the basis of information for the two Governments will have to be completed from existing maps. The Turkish Commissioner, moreover, denies that Yaffai and Aulaki are among the nine tribes, and continues to claim Shairi country as Turkish. Until these claims are yielded it seems impossible that demarcation north-eastwards can be begun ; and until the Bthali boundary has been settled it will be dijficult to find the starting point for this demarcation. I am telegraphing separately to Government of Bombay submitting some suggestions. 119. From Resident, Aden, to Governor of Bombay, 12th November 1902. Repeated to Secretary of State. P.— With reference to facts indicated in my telegram of 11th, I think the Committee that discussed the question in London last August were agreed that demarcation of Bthali territory by Joint Commission was not to be hoped for. We must now apparently rely upon information already collected, as our Commissioner appears to have accepted exclusion from territory in dispute, and no further surveys of it are to be carried out. I suggest when Wahab submits the new map which, in conjunction with the Turkish surveyors, he is preparing from existing materials, he might submit again in a compendious form the information that has been collected. Mean while the Amir of Bthali might, I venture to submit, be told that in his territory which the Turks have taken forcible possession of since demarcation was proposed by them, he can now resume his administration, and that we will support him in this course. A communication might be made to the Forte to the effect that British Government intend to retain for the Amir all territory that in October 1901 was under his jurisdiction; that should Forte not assent the British Commissioners will lay down what they believe to be the lightful boundary, and that we shall support Amir in maintaining it. I think that II.M.S. “Harrier” should return to FLodeida, her presence there having had good effect; and that Aden column should be mobilised, and the Resident authorised to purchase as many as 1,000 camels for additional troops. They would be in all probability very useful for Somaliland Expedition. Actual collision appears to be unlikely. lit .—From Resident, Aden, to Government of Bombay, IQth November 1902. {Repeated to Secretary of State.)

It was not, however till about 5 o’clock next morning, the 1 st November, that the note arrived. I have since learnt that the reason of the delay was that as it was not in accordance with the “ Mazbata ” of the Council of Ministeas which had been sanctioned by the Sultan, His Majesty desired to cover himself by getting the signatures and seals of the Grand Vizier and the Minister for Foreign &amp; ,U9 - Fr0m ^nt,A ( len, to Governor of Bombay, im November 1902.

My Lord, ^ ‘ T Tj \ n J , , . , . Iherapia, October 25, 1902. ti n i f ^ , honOUr lasfc . n, s ht ^ ln m y telegram No. 109, to report to your Lordshin the substance o. my interview with the Sultan on the subject of the Aden frontier delimitation, and I now beg leave to make some further complementary remarks , r f ince re eeiving the Sultan’s message on the 18th instant, stating that within twenty- u ouis a favourable answer would be sent to me in regard to this question, I failed to extract any information either from the Palace or the Porte, nor did I receive any reply to the icquest I made to lewtik Pasha on the 20th for an audience to lay the matter befme the Sultan. J therefore informed his Excellency that I proposed to attend the eelamhk on Friday, the 24th, and expected to he received after the ceremony. Upon this I got urgent messages from the Grand Vizier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the sultans first Secretary begging me not to insist upon an audience, as the Aden question would without fail, be considered by the Council of Ministers on the 26th and an answer given to me next day. There was no new indication, however, of the nature of the answer, or whether it would be favourable or unfavourable. I therefore decided, in obedmnce to the instructions contained in your Lordship’s telegram No. 104 of the JUfh instant, to }8 nore thes . e communications and to attend the Selamlik on Friday. the reception room in the kiosque overlooking the Mosque where the religious ceremony takes place was crowded with visitors, some of them connected with the Corps Eailwa^ 1 ^ 116 ^ 0t leiS Wlth the Administration of the Ottoman Bank and Anatolian a u° n 1 Sul t?! 1 s return the Palace an Aide-de-camp informed the German Ambassador that His Majesty would receive all the visitors t{ en cercle.” Upon learning; this from my German colleague it struck me at once that the Sultan was seeking for some means to avoid seeing me alone. 1 expressed my surprise to Baron von Marshall at this strange deviation from the usual etiquette, and after a few minutes’ reflection M yon Marshall said that it was quite irregular, that he would point this out to the 1 as ; er m tne Ceremonies, and that if the Sultan insisted he would refuse to attend. I readily concurred, and after a short delay the Sultan sent word that he would receive the two Ambassadors alone and separately in the usual way. I was received by His Majesty immediately after the German Ambassador. 1 he Sultan, after a few preliminary remarks about my recent visit to Smyrna, said t at the arrears due to Messrs. Armstrong on account of the cruiser under construction foi his Government would be paid for the Customs loan conversion, and that, to insure the regularity or the remaining payments, he had ordered them to be paid out of the tax levied for war materials. He wanted, besides, two or three smaller ships for coast service, and he would order them from Messrs. Armstrong. I thanked His Majesty ror his promise that the arrears due to Messrs-. Armstrong would be promptly paid, but I said that it was not on this matter that asked for the honour of an audience to-day. I then proceeded to say that I had received instructions from your^^mlship to speak to His Majesty on a much more serious and important question, namely, the Aden frontier delimitation, and I asked leave briefly to recount the history of the negotiations during the last twelve months, which would show His Majesty that, as the question had practically come to a deadlock, owing to the non-fulfilment of the promises made by the ? Porte, it was necessary to appeal to the supreme Arbiter and to -his high intelligence anc jf equitable sentiments in order that the matter should be settled in g. frisndlv manner anc ^ without the danger of a conflict. His Majesty listened patiently for a few mindtfs ant ^in delating*the main point interpi ' eter - 80 that 14 was with S^at difficulty that I succeeded When I had finished the Sultan said that he had no knowledge of the assurance, given to tne by hts Government ; that he was not sufficiently acquainted with the case to discuss the details, but that he had ordered his Ministers to consider the question in the v Council of Ministers on Sunday, and that he would give me an answer on Monday He ■ was most anxious to settle the question in a friendly way, and to maintain the best^ relations with England; but, on the other hand, he could not give up any of his righU ' without exposing himself to great unpopularity and severe criticism. England was so great, and her territory so extensive, that a small district, such as was now in dispute did ot matter to her, and he earnestly appealed to the generosity of His Majesty’s Govern ment not to drive him too hard. After all, tin's territory was of little account to England Empire * ' l ' Ca &lt;Pa t0 ’ ,m ’ as lt ' ,lvo ' ve '-' the preservation of the integrity of his The places occupied have been for years in Turkish possession, and their abandon ment now would be difficult and painful to him personally. He therefore hoped and e *E!' C , t ? d JL' ou d no . t P r f s him- In any case, I was harder on him than I had been with his Ministers with whom I had been negotiating for months. He promised me that the question would be submitted to the Council of Ministers two days hence, and that he would give me an answer on the following day. I said that I was sorry to importune His Majesty or question his words, but that, as a matter of fact, it was the integrity of territory apparently belonging to Chieftains V undei British protection that was being violated; that Suhub, Mafari, Jebel-Jehaf, and * '— Lak m at- es- Sal eh, which were the four places repeatedly mentioned in my representations to &amp;AW Bie Poite, had been occupied since the Delimitation Commission was proposed; that no Delimitation Commission could proceed with its work if one or other of the parties occupied places by force in the disputed territory, and that the object of the Commission was to inquire into the right of ownership and define the frontier accordingly. His Majesty frequently interrupted me by saying again and again that he could not uiscuss details, and then entered into a long account of the question, showing that he was ully acquainted with all that had taken place, though leaving me rather under the impression that he had been told that the occupation'of Suhub and other posts was of ancient date. T said that I did not wish to wrong or annoy His Majesty by any further remarks, and nV r° • r . emai ^ ie&lt; ^ fo r me to say that His Majesty’s Government felt bound to insist upon •uu imi ^ a ^ 10n ^ ron ^ er north-eastwards from the Dhali Plateau to the desert and the withdrawal of the Ottoman troops from disputed territory pending full inquiries as to the right of ownership, 1 believed that the best chance of a friendly settlement lay in placing these demands to-day clearly and definitely before His Majesty, and I was confident that His Majesty s friendly feelings, as well as his great political sagacity, would convince him ^ if^ aS ^ n ^ eies ^ both Governments to have a defined and recognized frontier which would in the future prevent all danger of conflict between two such friendly Powers. His Majesty then rose, and as he did so again assured me that he would send me an answer on Monday. ^ I called at the Porte this afternoon to impress upon the Minister and Grand Vizier the importance of not leaving the Sultan in doubt as to the recent occupation of the four military stations in the Amiri territory. ^ I did not, however, find either His Highness or the Minister at the Porte, but I learned fiom the Secretary that they had been summoned to the Palace in connection with the Aden frontier question, in order to study the question before the meeting of the Council of Ministers to-morrow.

Instant, I have the honour to report that I called upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs last Thursday and enquired whether he was now ready to ad mit that Yaffai was one of the nine cantons of the British sphere about Aden. Upon His Excellency answering in the affir mative I went on to say that I must insist upon categorical orders being given to the Turkish Commis sioners to proceed with the delimitation of the North Eastern frontier from the Dthali Plateau to the de sert and to afford the British Delegates every faci lity for this object. It was my duty likewise to demand that the Ottoman troops should be withdrawn from the posts they had occupied last autumn, namely fte Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.Ur Maferi, Jebal Jehaf, I^akniat-es-Saleh and Jebe] SuheC, as a preliminary to the delimitation of this part of the frontier, and also that the cordon of Turkish levies South of Jebel Suheh should be removed. I was afraid, I said, that His Excellency had not fully realised the importance of the communication made to him by Mr. de Bunsen and I therefore pro posed to read to him again Your Lordship's despatch Ho. 254 of the 18th ultimo. I then asked His Ex cellency* s earnest attention to the contents and gravity of this despatch and I observed that If the Ottoman Government disregarded the warning which it gave in concise and friendly language His Majesty* s Government would he forced to conclude that any further representations on my part would have no effect and that they must take their own measures both for the withdrawal of Ottoman troops from the territory in dispute and for the delimitation of the whole frontier between the Sanjak of Taiz and the nine cantons, or leave the Ottoman Government to take % ' . • ' thethe consequences of its remaining unde limited. I further urged upon Tewfik Pasha the advantages of settling this question through diplomatic channels and in a mutually friendly spirit so as to prevent the recurrence of incidents like that of Ad Parega which we could not afford to treat again with the same indulgence, and I added that the condition of the Yemen was such that a conflict of any kind on the frontier might be followed by very sed ous trouble in the Interior. Moreover I believed that merely send ing instructions v/hich the Ottoman Comriiissloners were at liberty to accept or reject at their pleasure was only a cause of fresh delays and irritation leading eventually to the interruption of friendly negotia tions v/lth its possible consequences. The instruc tions now sent to the Commissioners must be in ac cordance with the assurances of the Porte and of so precise and categorical a character that they cannot be disregarded. Tewfik Pasha seemed impressed and replied that he would Immediately report my language and remarks to the Grand Vizier.I subsequently learnt confidentially that His Excellency had done so very faithfully and that the Minister of War had telegraphed to the Military Com mandant in the Yemen as reported to Your Lordship in my Telegram No. 92 of the 16th. instant. Having occasion to see the Grand Vizier this afternoon I spoke very seriously to His Highness to matter, that he was desirous to see the Commission- j that he had immediately instructed the Minister of War to send the necessary orders to the Ottoman Delegates. I have not yet heard the exact telegram sent by the Minister of War but I am inclined to believe that unless it was altered by the Sultan it D ^.iace, may have appealed directly to the Sultan I ' ers proceeding with the frontier delimitation and ■I .... Commandant Abdullah Pasha, who is in favour at the responded to my demands. It is of course possible that the Military J* withwith a view to overriding the orders of the Minister. If this be the case I propose with Your Lordship’s approval to bring the matter directly before His Majesty, if necessary at a personal interview, and to hold much the same language that I have held to his Ministers.

The suggestion that the Turks would agree to he bought out of this post was regarded as most improbable, and the extreme step of using force to effect their general retirement behind the line drawn 1901 As^n alternative, &amp; it was thought better to proceed gradually by demanding the ' evacuation of all posts occupied or held by the Turks or their Arab levies within the red line, since the date of the Turkish proposal for the appointment of a Joint Com mission of delimitation. These posts were understood to be bain, Jebel Mafan, Jebel Suheb, near A1 Jalela, Lakmat-as-Salah and the line occupied from Jebel Mafan through Anim, A1 Baud, and Jebel Suheb. At the same time it was thought that the Turks might be informed that their occupation of A1 Jalela was not acquiesced in, and that all Amiri rights up to the red line were reserved for further discussion. It was thought that the Turkish proceedings, mentioned m the Aden Residents telegram of the 2nd August, had brought matters to a point at which we should he justified in demanding the withdrawal of the Turks from all newly-established posts as an essential preliminary to any further discussions by the Commission, hut that it was inexpedient to withdraw our Commissioners until the Turks had given reparation lor their recent encroachments. In the event of the Porte making no satisfactory reply to our demand, the dispatch of additional troops to Aden would become necessary. Opinions differed somewhat as to the strength required ; it was supposed that a reinforcement of not less than 2,000 men and a mountain battei y would he requisite, but General Maitland considered that it would he desirable to warn two brigades for service, although it might not he necessary for both of them to leave India. The only conclusion arrived at was that the force sent should he fully adequate to compel the retirement of the Turks, and of the Arab levies, if that step^ had to^ be taken. The employment of one or two ships of war as a demonstration against Mocha and Hodeida was also recommended by General Maitland and Colonel Maunsell, who proposed that, if necessary, the vessels should have orders to stop the landing of Turkish reinforcements. But further consideration of these proposals was reserved until the result was known of our notice to withdraw from places occupied since the Delimitation Commission was agreed upon.

O'Conor to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—(Received September 15.) (No. 396.) ^ -kord, Therapia, September 10, 1902. OJN my return here I lost no time in making inquiries, with a view to ascertaining: the dispatch of the instructions which the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs as well as Costaki Pasha, acting under his instructions, assured your Lordship)and Mr. de Bunsen had been sent to the Ottoman Commissioners to continue the further delimitation from the Dhali Plateau eastwards towards the desert, pending a settle ment of the question between the two Governments on which the Commissioners had not been able to come to an agreement. I found that the orders had been duly transmitted, but that the Ottoman Com missioners replied that they were “ astounded’’ to learn that it was intended to delimit the boundary running north-east between the Sanyak of Taiz and the Yaffai district, the lattei not forming one of the nine Cantons whose boundary the Commission was intended to define. They also said that they understood that''they were to begin the delimitation at the north-east corner of the Sheikh of Dhali’s territory, near Jelala, and proceed towards the sea on the south-western side in the direction of Sheikh Said! I further discovered that the objections raised by the Ottoman Commissioners had been submitted by the Minister of War to the Sublime Porte ; and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had referred the point to one or Ills subordinates, with instructions to report whether Yaffai was or was not one of the nine Cantons. 1 saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday, and told him that there was no possible doubt that Yaffai was one of the nine Cantons, and that we could not permit its being questioned. The Minister replied that he was now searching the Turkish correspondence to see whether this was so or not, and that he would let me know the result of his inquiries without delay. I gave his Excellency to understand that, after the distinct assurances given by him and the Turkish Ambassador, I was not inclined to wait very long or very patiently, and that I would instruct Mr. Fitzmaurice to ask again next day whether the Ottoman Commissioners had been ordered to obey their instructions without raising questions which were out of their province. I can understand the objections of the Commissioners who are on the spot, and know the geography of the country and the importance to us of the delimitation towards the desert, but, fortunately, the declarations of the Ottoman Government are too precise and recent to admit now of any backsliding, and I trust that we shall be able to keep them to them. It is possible, however, that they may attempt to create difficulties for the British Commissioners by intrigues with the Yalfai tribe ; and if I hear that there is an inclination at the Porte to support the views of the Ottoman Delegates I will submit to your Lordship, by telegraph, the necessity of instructing Colonel Wahah to o-pf, into communication without delav with the Yaffai Headman. Colonel YYahab to get into communication without delay with the Yaffai Headman, in order to counteract these intrigues. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) N. R. O’CONOR.

CONFIDENTIAL. No. 1. The Marquess of Lansclowne to Mr. dc Bunsen. (No. 25L) Sir ’ . Foreign Office, August 18, 1902. 1HL reports which have reached His Majesty’s Government from the British members of the Joint Commission appointed to determine the frontier-line between the territory of_ the nine tribes under British protection at Aden and the territory rvi- 1 ll i rklsl1 Jurisdiction, have given evidence of an attitude on the part of the lurkish Commissioners ever since the first meeting of the Commission on the 11th February last so entirely opposed to the understanding upon which His Majesty’s Government consented to the formation of the Commission, as to render any agreement hopeless unless that attitude is materially changed. The original proposal of the Turkish Government made on the 25th October last was that the boundary separating the Vilayet of Yemen from the nine Cantons should be marked out by joint agreement by Turkish and British officers. This proposal was accepted in principle by His Majesty’s Government. Their view as to the method ol procedure to he followed (which appeared to them to be the obvious interpretation oi the lurkish proposal), was that the officers appointed on either side should proceed to ^ mark out the frontier according to the state of affairs which they found actually existing, and that any questions of right on which differences might arise should be reserved for subsequent discussion and settlement. For this purpose it was obvious that the Commissioners on either side should only he accompanied by small escorts adequate for their personal protection, and that no attempt should he made to establish military occupation, either Turkish or British, m places where it had not previously existed. His Majesty’s Government have acted strictly on this principle. Simultaneously, however, with the proposal of the Turkish Government and its accejitance by that of His Majesty, Turkish regular troops occupied Jebel Suheb and a post on Jehel Jahar ; a post was established later on at Jebel Mafari; the village of Lakmat-as-Salah -has since been forcibly seized, and a line of Arab levies has been pushed even further south into country which His Majesty's Government regard as indubitably belonging of right to the Amiri tribes, and which has constantly been in the undisputed practical possession of the Amir of Dthali. It is understood that the Turkish Commissioners seek to justify these proceedings by claims that the territory thus occupied is by right Turkish. This, however, is°a view which is wholly unfounded, and from which His Majesty’s Government must altogether dissent. They have never admitted that the post of A1 Jalela, which has for some years been occupied by a Turkish force, and some adjoining villages which appear to recognize Turkish jurisdiction, are by fight Turkish. They did not, how ever, think it necessary to claim evacuation of these places as a condition precedent to the meeting of the Commission, which was, in their view, intended, in the first instance, to ascertain and define the state of affairs existing at the time of its appoint ment. They must, however, formally protest against the acts of occupation effected by force in some cases which have taken place during the recent discussions, and they think it necessary to demand, before the work of the Commission proceeds further in this part of the frontier, that the Turkish regular troops and irregular levies shall be withdrawn from all places thus recently occupied. This measure appears to them essential if any success is to be attained by the Commission, and they must earnestly insist on the necessity of categorical orders being sent to this effect, and of their being effectively and completely carried out. In the contrary case His Majesty’s Government would reluctantly he compelled to enter a formal protest against the attempt to decide by force questions at issue between the two Governments, and to reserve to themselves the right of taking such measures as they may deem necessary for the protection of their interests. You will read this despatch to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and will explain to him that His Majesty’s Government have thought it more consistent with the friendly relations existing between the two countries to make a verbal communication '[2123 s-1] i 12 on the subject rather than to instruct you to address his Excellency in an official note. In the event, however, of their not receiving a satisfactory reply, they will have no alternative hut to repeat their remonstrance in a formal manner and in such a shape - as to make it clear that, if it remain unheeded, the matter will not be allowed to V rest. They would sincerely regret that the correspondence between the two Govern ments should assume this' complexion, as it could scarcely fail to be the precursor of complications which it has been their earnest desire to avoid.

He said that he would communicate to Shckh Ali Mohsin Askar all that we had told him. 30uii T_,.o British and Ottoman Commissioners met 'by ap- poinumerr, in txie British Camp. Informed the Ottoman Commis sioners that we had received orders from our Government to in- vine them to cooperate with us in delimiting the frontier to '.,ne north-east leaving the Dthala question for future discus- S10n# 1 -‘ replied that they had not received orders in this sense and declined to cooperate without orders. The Ot t oman C omnis s i one rs we re the n inf o nne d that we . cla in that frorioiei uO mie north-east, starting from a point a little north-east of Hat aha, divides the district of Mares from the Snaioi district if the Yafa. They objected that they consider the Shaibi country as forming an important part of the Mares district; moreover that the Mares district includes the north- £2n °T Jabal Harir, and that only the southern part of Hanr, oelonging to the Ealmin, comes within Dthala limits. They were told that to avoid any misunderstanding we would ex- Pxami to them the general lie of the frontier we mean to claim, /xs; a, line dividing the Yafa, including the Shaibi, from Mares, and from me tribeships included in the district of Rada; thence to the north dividing the districts of Be da and Behan on our side from the tribeships of the Rada district, until the line terminates on the edge of the Desert. A rough sketch map was Cithem to illustrate this. They then expressed a doubt as to the Yafa being one of the nine tribes under British influ ence and were amphatically told that such is the case. A list of me nine tribes was written out and given to them. Informed the Ottoman Commissioners that we had received formal orders** orders that if they refused tn i oin in fho . - - us in one delimitation we were to proceed with it *by ourselves. To this Lt-Col Ihrahim' Seifi at once replied that they would regard our entering either Shairi or Shaioi country as a violation of the Ottoman frontier, and would haVe to act accordingly. Proposed that even if we could not start the demarcation it would he a good thing if we could survey the country near the frontier line visiting Mares and Shaihi together for the pur pose. They agreed as to the value of a map,hut said they could not join us in this without orders. Urged the desirability of ge l. o ing to work without delay so as to finish the north-eastern pam 01 one frontier, lying a.s it does in the highlands, during the summer, and so he free to turn to the south-western part in the winter. In the evening a letter was received from Col Mustapha Ramzi from which the following is an extract; ”1 have just received a telegram from my Government containing the following information: H.B.MUs Ambassador states that the English Government has ordered its Commissioners to commence the delimitation between the Kataba district and Dthala and to set up boundary marks in such a manner that the Shairi country, Jahal Jihaf, Jabal Mafari, and their dependencies may remain within the Kataba district, and it desires the Ottoman Government to give orders to its Com missioners in the same sense. I am then ordered to settle the line of demarcation between the Kataba district and Dthala and to put up the boundary marks in the aforesaid manner. I hope you have received the necessary orders with regard to this. I beg you to be good enough to acquaint me with the place and time of the meeting of the Commission for .0 tomorrow with the object of drawing up the programme to be followed on the ground.

Wahab, Colonel Commissioner, Aden Boundary Commission.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government] downe to Mr de Bunsen. (No. .) Foreign Office, Sir, August , 1902. THE reports which have reached His Majesty’s Goyernment from the British members of the Joint Commission appointed to determine the frontier-line between the territory of the nine tribes under British protection at Aden and the territory under Turkish jurisdiction, have given evidence of an attitude on the part of the Turkish Commissioners ever since the first meeting of the Commission on the 11th February last so entirely opposed to the understanding upon which His Majesty’s Government consented to the forma tion of the Commission, as to render any agree ment hopeless unless that attitude is materially changed. The original proposal of the Turkish Govern ment made on the 25th October last, was that the boundary separating the Vilayet of Yemen from the nine Cantons should be marked out by joint agreement by Turkish and British officers. This proposal was accepted in principle by His Majesty’s Government. Their view as to the method of procedure to be followed (which appeared to them to be the obvious interpretation of the Turkish proposal), was that the officers appointed on either side should proceed to mark out the frontier according to the state of affairs which they found actually existing, and that any questions of right on which differences might arise should be reserved for subsequent dis cussion and settlement. For this purpose it was obvious that the Commissioners on either side should only be accompanied by small escorts adequate for their personal protection, and that no attempt should be made to establish military occupation, either Turkish or British, in places where it had not previously existed. His Majesty’s Government have acted strictly on this principle. [752]Simultaneously, however, with the proposal of the Turkish Government and its acceptance hy that of His Majesty, Turkish regular troops occupied Jebel Suheb and a post on Jebel Sahaf ; a post was established later on at Jehel Mafari; the village of Lakmat-as-Salah has since been forcibly seized, and a line of Arab levies has been pushed even further south into country which His Majesty’s Government regard as indubitably belonging of right to the Amiri tribes, and which has constantly been in the undisputed practical possession of the Amir of Dhtali.

[August 8.] Section 1 # [Amended Copy.] No. 1. Memorandum. the .- For ? i g n Office on the 6th August to discuss the question of tile difficulty that has arisen m the demarcation of the Aden Protectorate and to suggest a course of action. * There were present : Sir Thomas Sanderson, His Excellency Sir Nicolas O’Conor, Colonel Maunsell, Brigadier-General Maitland, Sir William Lee-Warner, and Mr. Maxwell. Tne first point raised and discussed was the boundary which would be most in accordance with British interests if it could be secured. General Maitland strongly maintained that the frontier ought to be so drawn as to comprise all territory occupied 1 onn ™ trib 1 eSj mcludm g the enclave which has been occupied by the Turks since 189°, or thereabouts. A.s to the exact line of that boundary opinions differed. olonel MaunseJ argued in favour of a natural boundary, whether river or mountain. General Maitland did not consider it safe to specify the Tiban stream as the frontier, because he oelieved that the Amiri occupation extended beyond it. He indicated the red line claimed by the British Commissioners (Colonel Wahab’s letter of the 7 th Aprfi last) to the west of the line shown on the Map of 1891-92 (a line drawn north from a spur midway between Am Amma and M Kama, proceeding close t0 marked 8811, and then sweeping round to the south of Kataba Amiri ^ Inarked 7395 )’ as representing roughly the limit of actual occupation by the Sir William Lee-W T arner agreed with General Maitland that the “red line” of 1902 was c entirely at variance with Wahab’s line of 1892” (paragraph 37, General Maitland s Minute of the 28th July last). The line of 1891—92 was thus thrown over but, before Hunter’s line of 1880 or the new “red line” was adopted, the extension of our responsibilities would require careful attention. The ill-knit Amiri confederacy consisted of an Amir with doubtful authority, Sheikhs who quarrelled and intrigued against each other,^ and tribesmen who sided partly with the Turks, partly with us. A disputed succession, the decline of Turkish authority, or the rise of Mahdi would draw us forward, and there was no natural boundary as you went north on the plateau. Aden was a fortress, and a ring fence round it which foreign Powers would not cross was all we needed. Some discussion ensued as to whether the red line corresponded with any map of the frontier, or claim advanced before 1901, and it was agreed that further inquiry would be necessary to establish the correctness of the red line and its agreement with the actual present possessions of the Amiris. It was thought, however, that the red line might be provisionally indicated as showing the extent of our claim, subject to further inquiry in the actual localities. The second question was to what extent, or with what modifications, it was expedient to advance this claim at the present moment. This resolved itself into a question whether the Turks could be at once required to withdraw altogether beyond the line in question. General Maitland thought that this should be done at once, but pointed out that troops, including mountain guns, would have to be dispatched from India to Aden to enforce the demand. Objections were taken to so extreme a measure on the ground of the disturbance, possibly international, which such a pro ceeding would involve. In particular it was observed that the Turks had been in [2123 h —1]2 occupation of A1 Jalela for twenty years and more. The suggestion that the Turks would agree to he bought out of this post was regarded as most^ improbable, and the extreme step of using force to effect their general retirement behind the line drawn in 1901-1902 was deprecated. As an alternative, it was thought better to proceed gradually by demanding the evacuation of all posts occupied or held by the Turks, or their Arab levies, within the red line, since the date of the Turkish proposal for the appointment of a Joint Com mission of delimitation. These posts were understood to be Sarir, Jebel Mafari, Jebel Suheb, near A1 Jalela, Lakmat-as-Salah and the line occupied from Jebel Mafari ‘through Anim, A1 Hand, and Jebel Suheb. At the same time it was thought that the Turks might be informed that their occupation of A1 Jalela was not acquiesced in, and that all Amiri rights up to the red line were reserved for further discussion. It was thought that the Turkish proceedings, mentioned in the Aden Resident’s telegram of the 2nd August, had brought matters to a point at which we should be justified in demanding the withdrawal of the Turks from all newly-established posts as an essential preliminary to any further discussions by the Commission, but that it was inexpedient to withdraw our Commissioners until the Turks had given reparation lor their recent encroachments. In the event of the Porte making no satisfactory reply to our demand, the dispatch of additional troops to Aden would become necessary. Opinions differed somewhat as to the strength required ; it was supposed that a reinforcement of not less than 2,000 men and a mountain battery would be requisite, but General Maitland considered that it would be desirable to w’arn two brigades for service, although it might not he necessary for both of them to leave India. The only conclusion arrived at was that the force sent should be fully adequate to compel the retirement of the Turks, and of the Arab levies, if that step had to he taken. The employment of one or two ships of war as a demonstration against Mocha and Hodeida was also recommended by General Maitland and Colonel Maunsell, •who proposed that, if necessary, the vessels should have orders to stop the landing of Turkish reinforcements. But further consideration of these proposals was reserved until the result was known of our notice to withdraw from places occupied since the Delimitation Commission was agreed upon.

Further, they declined to recognise the Yaffai as included among the nine protected tribes.

From here it follows the line shown in the tribal map accompanying the survey report of 1892 ? leaving Lakmat ash Sha’ub, Marfad and all villages shown in that report as Amiri, on the British side. It then passes etween A1 Jalela and Jabal Suheb or Shahad, and between the villages of Dakka and A1 Hud at the eastern foot of Jabal Jahaf: and from here northward along the line indicated by the edge of the hill shading to the northern end of the spur west of Sanah; and thence southward along that spur to the point marked on the m ap Jabal Jahaf 7704. South^the topography is shown in the annexed blue pr^nt from recent survey. It will be seen that the watershed does not, as was supposed, follow the line of the high peaks marked 7033, 7131, between which the Wadi Tabghain breaks through, but runs rather more to the westward^following txie crest of the spur running down to the junction of the Wadi Tabghain with the Tiban. I have therefore entered the boundary *along this spur to the junction cf the two rivers and thence along the Tihan to the Haushahi border on the AM AJ5MA range. 3. I venture again to point out that the district between CTabal «Taliat and A1 &lt; ale3a which the Aden authorities believed to have fallen under Turkish influence between 1886 and 1868^ has been administered by the Amir of Dthala for the last 10 years* At the tine of the rebellion in Yemen in 1891 - lc^2 the Turkish officials and garrisons at Kataba were forced by the insurgents to take refuge with the Amir, who protected them by occupying the line of the Wadi Kataba with a large force of his tribesmen. From that tine until about the begin- mg ol 1901 he has been in undisturbed possession of all. the Aniri villages in the Wadi Safiya and of Dhi Haran, Robat etc, the Turks contenting thenselves with the military occupation of Al Jalela* 4. I hardly think sufficient consideration has been given to the altered situation brought about by the rebellion, which undoubtedly enabled the Amir to re-establish himself in the North Y/est portion of his territories. The situation was clearly pointed out by Major Davies in his report submitted last yea*; but the incidents which led to it have only been fully ascertained within the last few days. 5. The Amir f c books show that he has actually drawn an average revenue of Rs 2700 from this district for the last 10 years, and he is not likely to acquiesce in its abandonment without adequate compensationj if hov/ever compensation is to be paid I would respectfully suggest that it would be much bet ter to pay any reasonable amount to Turkey to relinquish her claim to Al Jalela and the whole District, and so secure a boundary that will offer a reasonable prospect for the future-pe peace of the border. 6. The posts occupied by Turkish troops are shown on t; e accompanying tracing underlined in green. All those on the British side have been occupied within the last year.

Sir, Since writing my letter No-56 I have received a copy of tne Secretary of State’s telegram dated 27th May,and with re* fere nee to -is remark *1 do not see any ground upon which w e can draw a line from JA3AL JAHAF near SANAH eastwards etc-” I have the honour to inform you that some very Important evidence bearing on the AMIR’S rights to that part of the country has just come into my hands, showing, I think conclusively, that the situation has changed materially in favour of the AMIR since the survey of 1891-92; it is as follows; 2- During the rebellion in YEMEN in 1891-92 the Turks were driven out of the AL AUD country and fell back on KATABA- They were followed up by the insurgents and fled to DHI HARAN, DTHALA and other villages in the AMIR’S territory- The AMIR then collected several thousand of his followers and occupied the line of the WADI KATABA, he himself taking up his position at SANAH- The insurgents meanwhile took KATABA looting the Treasury and everything they could lay hands on- Their further advance ’was however stopped by the AMIR and their demand for the surrender of the Turks was refused by him on the ground that they had taken refuge with him- Reinforcements eventually reached the Turks and the refugees returned to their original posts in KATABA and the neighbourhood- Since then the AMIR has moved freely about the northern part of his territory and as his books show has drawn the revenues from the villages i n the WAT I SAFIYA and DHI HARAN, ROBAT etc- for the last tern years. A further proof of his friendly relations with the Turks is the letter of AHMAD PAIZI PASHA, Governor General of YEMEN, written in 1893 or 94 and the letter from the KAIMAKAM in 1892, referred to in my letter No- 6 dated the 28th* February: and until the appointment of the present KAIMAKAM these friendly relations have continued- 3- I think these letters are clear evidence of the fact thatthat the Turks had, in recognition of the AMIR 1 S assistance at a critical time, withdrawn their claims to the villages along the eastern foot of JAHAF, and their subsequent conduct m al lowing him to draw his revenues from this district shows that they recognised his rights, and confined their own claims to the occupation of JALSLA and the SHAIRI villages of JALAS,WABH and AL HAJFAR on the road between JALBLA and KATABA* 4 . x trust it may not yet be too late to point out t o His Majesty’s Government that the situation has changed since 1891 and that whatever the terms of our engagement with the AMIR may be, it would be most unjust to him to deprive nim without protest of so large a part of his lands as is contem plated* I have etc* r t C C) IT F I JD E IT JT A !.•_ No*158 of 1902* Aden Residency* The I5th* June 1902* Forwarded with compliments to the Secretary to Government, Political Department, for favour of transmission to the Govern ment of India in the Foreign Department* 7/ith reference to para. 3 of the letter, the claim of the Turks to the village-5 in quest ion would seem to have been very slight;no greater in fact than their claims to MAFARI, AZRAKI, etc, nfriich have not been admit ted by H* M’s* Government* With regard to para*I,* think i t is doubtful whether the Turks were taking revenue from the villages immediately east of JABAL JAHAF, even in 189x jin \vhon connection please see Colonel Wahab’s representation contained in my telegram of 7th* December 1901*• It is at least certain that in 1877 it was admitted by the Turkish Officials that the 2- AMIR’S boundary ran 'quite close to KATABA** See enclosure 3K to Colonel Wahab’s letter No* dated 28th* February 1902* Maitland Brigadier-General, Political Resident* v'f.Colonel Wahab*s HO.

P. —I have received your telegram of the ISth June, but the tracings for which I asked in my telegram to you of the Zrd June must be awaited. When we have both received an identical map showing the places in Turkish occupation within the territory claimed by your Government to be within our Protectorate and the arguments upon which you base your demand for their evacuation, the said map indicating the line described in m,y telegram of the TUh May beyond which the British Commissioner is not to go, then details can be settled; and ive can thus dispense with further arguments and discussions by telegraph. When we are in possession of these tracings the Besident may be instructed to come to London. If as the Government of Bombay appear to apprehend, disturbances occur in the Protectorate on our side of the line indicated by me, your Government have full power to take all requisite measures for the preservation of order. When our differences of opinion have been put into a definite shape, supported by an identical map, 1 shall have no objection to place this matter before the Cabinet.178 .—From Viceroy, 22&gt;rd June 1902. p.— JVahab in commmiication received 20th June urges that if the Aden boundary indicated by the India Office is accepted twenty villages from which the Amir has received revenue averaging Ids. 2,700 a year during the last nine years will have to be surrendered to the Turks. He thinks that except under compulsion the Amir can hardly be made to accept this settlement.No. .336 M., dated Bombay Castle, the 28 th May 1902 (Confidential). From—S. W. Edgeriey, Esq., C.I.E., Acting Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I am directed to forward herewith, in original, a letter from Colonel Wahab, Commissioner, Aden Boundary Commission, No. 49 (Secret), dated the 16th May 1902, and its enclosure, to the address of the Government of India, which the Political Besident, Aden, has submitted here for transmission, as time did not admit of a copy being made at Aden for the Bombay Government. 2. I am to request that you will be so good as to furnish the Bombay Government with 12 copies of the sketch map which is appended to Colonel Wahab’s letter when it is printed for the Government of India’s Proceedings. No. 116 , dated Aden, the 18 th May 1902 (Confidential). From— Bbigadier-General P. J. Maitland, C.B., Political Resident at Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to forward herewith a letter from Colonel B. A. Wahab, C.I.E., Commissioner, Aden Delimitation Commission, addressed to the Poreign Department of the Government of India. 2. I regret to say that time does not admit of a copy of the letter being made for the Government of Bombay, and there is no spare copy of the map. I would suggest that the shortest way of obtaining the latter would probably be to ask the Government of India to kindly have a copy of the map made in Simla, and sent to the Political Secretary to Government. No. 49 , dated Camp Dthali, the 16 th May 1902 (Secret). From— Colonel R. A. Wahab, C.I.E., Commissioner, Aden Boundary Commission, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department (through the Resident at Aden). I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram, dated the 10th instant, through the Besident at Aden. 2. The line referred to as the “ limit of the shaded portion in the survey map of 1891-92 ” is, I presume, that shown in the accompanying sketch by a broad red band. The parts of this map south-west of Jihaf are from recent survey; the northern part could not be surveyed owing to the opposition of the Turkish Commissioners, but I believe that the course of the Tiban is some miles further to the east than was indicated on the printed map, and that the discrepancy between the boundary which His Majesty’s Government wish to adopt and that suggested in my letter No. 20, dated the 7th April, will be smaller than it seemed at first; and, if a balance be struck between the two lines by exchanging the piece north of Kataba for that between Jihaf and the Tiban valley, an equitable boundary would be obtained recognised by every one locally and representing the actual status. 3. The limit of the 1891 map is not, as has, I think, been assumed, a watershed or definite natural feature; the whole mass of Jihaf appears really to form a more or less broken but cultivated plateau, covering several square miles and containing numerous villages whose boundaries would require demar cation in great detail, if the line is carried as proposed, even if it were practicable to lay down an arbitrary boundary on the ground based neither on natural features or tribal limits, it would, I submit, be a constant source of trouble in the future, the Humedi and Ahmadi tribes would be leit partly out side our border, and would be compelled either to abandon a great part ol their ■ 1 1-•r- V 2 lands or become Turkish subjects; and the Turks would retain a footing on Jebel Jihaf, from which they would undoubtedly continue the policy of intrigue and interference in the Amir’s territory which has caused so much mischief ^ the past. 4. I have the honour to add, with reference to the Secretary of State’s telegram of the 13th May, that the British Commissioners in conducting their enquiries into the status of the Amiri tribes and the extent of the Amir s territories were carrying out what they understood to be the instructions of His Majesty’s Government. In his telegram No. 37 C., dated the 26th November last, His Excellency the Viceroy proposed certain instructions, more especially with regard to the Amiri border, which necessitated enquiries into the actual circumstances, and his telegram, dated 24th January, indicated that, while the survey limits of 1891-92 were to be adopted as the basis of the demarcation, some latitude was left to the Commissioners to amend that line by mutual agreement. These instructions, though not explicitly repeated by the Secretary of State, were understood to have been concurred in by him, and the enquiries of the Commission were undertaken with a view to ascertaining how these instructions could best be carried into effect, and certainly without any idea of extending the responsibilities of His Majesty’s Government beyond the limits of the nine tribes, the preservation of whose independence has been always understood to be indispensable. The expression used in Colonel Abud’s memo randum “ the future administration ” of the Protectorate was merely intended to refer to the political relations with the tribes, and not to imply any more direct administration than is at present exercised. 5. As soon as the Turkish Commissioners are prepared to co-operate, the joint Commission will march along the border and map the country through which the line of 1892 passes. This, it is understood, will be preliminary to the actual demarcation, and I have the honour to enquire whether it will then be permissible to suggest an amendment of the line, if this can be done by mutual agreement, by exchange of outlying territory on either side. / ill :45' / iTelegram, No. 1117 E.-A., dated the 3rd June 1902. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, T° His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. 1 a ™ T r . el ™ t ? nt 1 to accept responsibility of repeating to Aden latest instrue- tit. -j of His Majraty s Gorernment without giving opportunity of reconsider ing what I believe to be entirely mistaken decision. Most careful examination or all papers establishes following propositions. There has been no real confusion as to identity of map. Wahab’s survey map of 1891-92, scale 4 miles to inch, has been map ^ alluded to throughout. But there has been serious discrepancy as to interpretation of so-called line upon that map. In your ietter to Foreign Office of December 4th, you said that Wahab’s survey within limits to which it extends should be basis of our claim. In your telegram to me of 21st January you repeated this definition. Upon this ground we have since rested our case. On May 13th, however, you varied definition in telegram to Besident, ^ instructing Wahab not to go beyond line shaded m upon his map. But in subsequent instructions both the limits of survey and the line shaded in have been ignored. The former clearly includes cross range containing peak 7722; the latter clearly includes shaded range running due north from Jebel Jihaf. Nevertheless, this shading is now ignored, and your proposed line cuts right across it, makes a sweep round Dthali valley, leaving to Turks not merely all the places which they seized from 1872 onwards, but a large number of villages now admittedly belonging to Amir, some of which they have occupied since Commission met. In other words, you have reverted to line traced in Wahab’s coloured sketch map of 3rd March 1892, which you rejected in January, and to line in map accompanying Maitland’s letter of 12th October 1901, which he has since cancelled. Further, the shaded line is unknown to, and is repudiated by, Turkish Commissioners on spot. Justification of your attitude appears to be that we are only concerned with status quo at time of Wahab’s B-eport in 1891-92. I submit that this is in consistent both with previous attitude of His Majesty’s Government and with entire raison d'etre of Commission. In your letter to Foreign Office of 13th March, which they repeated to Turkish Ambassador on 24th March, you said that first object was clear understanding as to exact course of boundary at present recognised by British Government, which constitutes the status quo. In other words, your status quo was not that of 1892 as represented in Wahab’s coloured sketch map of 1892, which you had disowned, but the existing status quo, as determined by the more recent reports of Davies and Maitland, in so far as these were not inconsistent with limits of survey in accepted map. Your latest instructions, however, ignore recent status quo, which is fully described by Davies in his Beport of 15th November 1901, and by Wahab in his letters of 18th and 23rd April 1902, and they order handing over to Turkey of entire valley, in which only a small number of villages were in Turkish possession in November, while remainder, right up to Kataba, are either independent, or under control of Amir of Dthali. Surely this is most unnecessary and unwise concession and is in contradiction of entire proceedings up to date. Moreover, if your status quo is that of 1892, your instructions are also inconsistent, since they propose claiming for ourselves entire Mehrabi country which was admittedly outside Amiri line in 1892. 1 submit that, as we have stuck throughout to Wahab’s map, we should stick to it north of Jebel Jihaf, as well as south; and that status quo should, not be condition of affairs as reported in 1892, and since shown to be both incorrect and obsolete; but status quo when Commission was started. If this view be adopted, partition of valley containing Jaleli might be made matter of agreement, Turks being bought out or given compensation elsewhere. Otherwise I see no advantage in persevering with Commission, since we are now worse off^ than when we began. Government of India have no more desire than His Majesty s Government to expand Aden Protectorate.. But we do not think that all Turkish expansion, the greater part of which has been in direct defiance or Lord Granville’s emphatic declaration of 10th January 1883, should, therefore, be condoned. Wahab, Besident, Bombay Government, and ourselves are at one on the matter: and I feel it my duty to represent that, if this consensus of local authority be ignored, His Majesty’s Government will incur considerable responsibility.&amp; (3k fc&gt;r 16 5*^ (V-H \ 108 .—From Viceroy, 13M June 1902. V. —Our anxiety is not relieved by your telegram of the &lt;dth June. A line appears to be assumed by Ills Majesty's Government where no line but only the limit of a survey by an European officer, exists ; and they seem to regard that limit of survey as supplying a line, and to be ready to allow Turkish encroachments m unshaded valleys between shaded hills, because surveyors do not shade m valleys. This is described by your Lordship as a continuous line; but m our view no line can be regarded as continuous which, while purporting to rest upon shaded mountains, purposely jumps the shaded range at Jebel Jehaj m order to leave to the Turks the valley on its eastern side. TVe would never have recommended delimitation had we foreseen that the limits of Wdhab's survey would have been interpreted in this manner by your Lordship. Your present proposal is to restrict the British Protectorate to one portion of the Amiri tribes whilst not admitting rights of the Turks over the rest. The primary object of the Commission being to define the boundary between the nine tribes (including the Amiris) which are under British protection and the Turkish province of Taiz, this proposal appears to us to be inconsistent with that object, and destructive of the whole idea of demarcation. If a neutral ground is to be left between Bthali and the Turks, over ivhich both sides would quarrel, what delimitation ivill there be? Moreover, though your Lordship bases your case on the shade limit of Wahab's survey, you now appear to entertain the idea of modifying your line between Al Kama and Jebel Jehaf in favour of the Turks. The result is that the so-called line of Wahab's survey will noivhere be interpreted in our favour but everywhere to our disadvantage. Our argument about the status quo is not answered by your Lordship, and we remain doubtful as to the nature and date of the status quo ivhich we claim. We beg to remind you that in your telegram of the ^BSth March you stated that the Turkish Government were being asked to restrict the inquiry to a definition of the actual status quo on the basis of Lord Granville's Note of 10th January 1883. The Foreign Office have thus definitely rejected the status quo of 1892 and endorsed Lord Granville's declaration that His Majesty's Government could not recognise the Sultan's claims to sovereignty over the tribes under the Amir of Bthali, and would not permit interference with them. This position appears to us to be completely abandoned by your Lordship's present proposal. The fact that your Lordship has for the most part issued orders to our officer over our heads and has now repeated your last instructions to Aden without giving us an opportunity of replying to them, has throughout enhanced our difficulties. This procedure is, so far as we are aware, without precedent ; and it places the Government of India in the invidious position of being unable to tender advice until after action has already been taken by your Lordship. The opinions of the Government of India merit, we venture to think, more consideration than they have received from your Lordship. We are not aware whether the decision of the Cabinet is also represented by the advice of the Interdepart mental Committee. If the question has nat been referred to the former, we ask that the recent correspondence, including representations made by the Bombay Government, the Resident at Aden, and Wahab, may now be submitted to them. Before His Majesty's Government are finally committed, it is our duty respectfully to represent that it is the unanimous opinion of all the Indian authorities, who are your Lordship's responsible advisers, that the arrangement now contemplated is injurious to British interests and certain to break down in the near future. Davies is now at home, and we ivould suggest either that your Lordship should see him, or that Maitland should be instructed to join in conference with His Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople.107.
