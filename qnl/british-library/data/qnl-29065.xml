Trade marks have, however, for many years been registered at the Agency on receipt of an application accompanied by 3 copie of the trade mark. A fee of Rs.2/8/- is charged for each regis tration. Thereafter protection is afforded by Article 28 of the Bahrain Order-in-Council and Sectione(^48^to 489 of the Indian Penal Code. However, in the absence of the application of an Act to Bahrain providing for the Registration of Trade l^rks, the registration at present carried out in the Agency probably has no legal effect.

Bahrain is, we understand, the largest of a group of islands in the Persian Giilf near the coast of K1 Kasa and so far as we are aware there are no provisions for obtaining Patent protection in that territory. We believe the islands are under British protection and in treaty relations with the Government of India. If, as we believe to be the case, there is at present no Patent Law affording protection for inventions in Bahrain, we respectfully suggest that an Ordinance be issued on the lines of those covering other minor British Colonies. We recall that some years ago the attention of your office was directed to the fact that there were several islands in the Pacific Ocean which were cable stations where no Patent protection could be obtained, and ae a result of the representations then made an Ordinance was issued covering what are known as the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. We are, Sir, COPY SJtNT BY AIR MAIL of i ^ ySecretary of State for the Colonies. r - oaa v . Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.

As regards ( 1 ) the position appears to be that, under the Bahrein Order in Council, Art, 11(2) and (3), Indian Acts may be applied to Bahrein, but that so far as we are aware, the Indian Companies Act has not been applied.

(SB.) H.W.GARRETT. I see no objection, if the L.A. sees none, to this being done privately, but I should have thought that it might be less invidious to say 'any of the following gentlemen would probably be found conversantmm with the raatter” and give 3 or 4 names.

Gentlemen, With reference to your letter of the 1st November, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to inform you that Indian Acts may be applied to Bahrein under the Bahrein Order in Council, 1913; but that the Indian Companies Act has not as yet been so applied. As regards the regulations to which you refer I am to suggest that you should communicate direct with the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bushire. I am to express regret that the Secretary of State is not in a position to furnish the name of a Counsel qualified to advise on the lavrerelating to the formation of a Limited Company in India. I am, etc., (SD.) L.D.WAKELY. Messrs. Cardew, Smith and Ross, 25, Bedford Row, LONDON, W.C.lP.42 59/19 23 T/N 25, BEDFORD ROW, LONDON, W.C.l Thursday, 1st November 1923. Dear Sir, We should be much obliged if you could inform us whether the Indian Companies Acts are applicable in the State of Bahrein which we understand is on the Persian Gulf, and also whether you can give us any information on the fiscal regulations relating to companies and other commercial enterprises in that State. We are also desirous of consulting a Counsel who specialises in Indian matters and who can give an opinion on the laws relating to the formation of a Limited Company there, and we should therefore be obliged if you would give us the name of any such gentleman. Faithfully yours, (SD.) CARDEW, SMITH Sc ROSS • The Under Secretary of State, India Office, WHITEHALL, S.W.lMINUTE* 2. To the Legal Adviser, 2* ” ' Secretary, R.&amp; S* Dept., For the favour of remarks. J.E. SHUCKBURGH. 9/7/17. I have no information as to the law which is applicable to the countries in Mesopotamia which are now in British occupation. But as regards the districts falling within the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council certain Indian Acts are made applicable and amongst these Acts is the Penal Code - which now incorporates the provisions of the Indian Merchandise Marks Act, 1889. Sec.478 of the Penal Code and the following sections provide for the protection of Trade Marks - and Mr.Gee may be referred to these provisions. The Indian law does not x provide for the registration of Trade Marks. The Indian Inventions &amp; Designs Act ) J.W. SALE, of 1888 does not cover Trade Marks ) nor is it made applicable by the ) 10.7.17. Persian Order in Council. ) J.W. SALE. ) 10.7.17. ) The Iraq Occupied Territories Code shows that the Indian Penal Code has been applied to the occupied parts of Mesopotamia, and the answer to the enquiry, so iar as Mesopotamia is concerned, appears to be the same as it would be for India, viz: that there is no law providing for the/2 the registration of trade marks* hut that recognised trade j marks are protected under in the sense of registration establishing an exclusive right to the use of the trademark. In India a document stating that ^ particular trade mark is claimed by a particular person can be registered, for what such registration is worth, under the Indian Registration Act, but this Act does not appear to have been applied to Mesopotamia. ) ) the Penal Code. As regards Persia, this i * Department has nothing to * ) add to what is said by the Legal Adviser:- except that it maybe remarked with reference to para.4 of the F.O. letter that so far as trade marks are concerned. Articles 28 of the Muscat and Bahrein Orders in Council appear to add nothing to the effect of the Articles applying the Penal Code. (The reply to this reference has been deferred until a copy of the Compilation of Proclamations, etc. applying to Mesopotamia was available. This however appears to throw no further light on the subject). L.D. WAKELY. 13.VIII. L.J.KERSHAW. 13.8.INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, S. W.l. 23 August 1917. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.122411/C, dated the 3rd July 1917, on the subject of the registration and protection of trade marks in certain districts round the Persian Gulf. As regards Mesopotamia, I am to say that the Jraq^ Acquired Territories Code shows that the Indian Penal Code which now incorporates the provisions of the Indian Merchandise Marks Act, 1889, has been applied to the vilayat of Basra, but not to that of Baghdad for reasons of which Mr.Balfour is aware. Recognised trade marks are protected under the Penal Code, Sections 478 et seq, but there is no Indian law providing for the registration of trade marks, in the sense of registration establishing an exclusive right to the use of the trade mark. With regard to Bushire, Bundar Abbas, and other places falling under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1907, the Indian Penal Code has also been made applicable. I am to suggest that in reply to his enquiry, Mr.Gee may be informed accordingly. With reference to the 4th paragraph of your letter, Mr.Montagu observes that so far as trade marks are concerned, there does not appear to be anything in Arts.28 of the Maskat and Bahrein Orders in Council which adds to the effect of the Article applying the Penal Code under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. I am, ScQ •, The Under-Secretary of State, (Sgd.) J.E. SHUCKBURGH. Foreign Office.FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. No.122411/C. 3 July, 1917. Sir, I am directed by Mr.Secretary Balfour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a letter from Mr.H.T.P.Gee, a chartered patent Agent, enquiring whether it is possible to ^ register or in any way protect trade marks in certain districiE / round the Persian Gulf. 2. So far as Mr.Balfour is able to ascertain the protection of Patents, Trade Marks, etc., in Baghdad and Basra was, until the outbreak of war with Turkey, provided for by articles 69 and 119 of the Ottoman Order in Council, 1910. Presumably, however, as those places are now under British military jurisdiction, that Order no longer applies. It is therefore not clear to him what steps are at present being taken to insure such protection. 3. The Persia Order in Council, 1889, (article 292) appears to regulate the matter in so far as the inland districts of Persia are concerned. 4. With regard to Bushire, Bundar Abbas, and other places falling under the Persia Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1907, the position is not clear, for, possibly through an omission in drafting, that Order contains no provision in regard to offences against the Trade Marks etcetera Acts such as existed in the previous Coast and Islands Order of 1889, and as are to be found in the Abyssinia, Bahrein and Muscat Orders of modern date. It seems not improbable that measures exist for the protection of/ The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.V oi‘ Patents etc., in the districts in question, but in the absence of any stipulation in the Order in Council it is not easy to say what they are. 5. As Indian Law is administered under the Order I am to enquire whether the Secretary of State for India in Council is able to offer any information on this point, and to suggest what answer should be returned to Mr.Gee. I am, Ac., (Sgd.) VICTOR WELLESLEY.(122411.) 70, George Street, Croydon. 19th June, 1917. Sir, I have an enquiry as to whether it is possible to register, or in any other way protect, Trade Marks in the districts around the Persian Gulf, such as:- Bushire Basra Bagdad Bunder Abbas and neighbouring territories. ■Will you be so good as to inform me if this can be done. Thanking you in anticipation of an early reply. 1 am, et c., (Sgd.) H.T.P. Gee.
