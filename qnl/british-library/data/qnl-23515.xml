BAHRAIN, 10th February, 19^4., I thought that perhaps you might be interested to hear that a.a.Bankura brought here from Outch Mandvi two hundred and thirty-oigh^ chests of Indian (black) tea. The importer is the firm of kostafa bin Abdul L.atif, whose headquarters are in Bombay, with an important branch here, buch consignments are usually transhi ped hither at Bombay from Calcutta; and I believe I am correct in stating that this is the first consignment of tea received here from such an insignificant port as Cutch Mandi/v, which I understand is not in British India, but a native state. ^ I mention this to you, as I wondered if such an action might be in connection with the restrictions upon the export of tea from India arising out of the recent 'quota' system which has been put into force. l ? h z- Tot- Lieut-Colonel Gordon Loch, I.A., H.B.M's Political Agent, BAHRAIN. .vI &amp; A-/'I No PA/SF//f/?!9.

MEMORANDUM;- I would invite your reference to the Monthly Trade Statistical Reports which are submitted to yourseli' from this Department. This reports covers in general all the imports upon which customs duty is levied, except Pearls and specie. But it does not include the value of the imports of Plant, machinery, lind stores by The Bahrain Petroleum Coy Ltd, which are duty free. It was thought that to include these values, which relate to imports under a special concession, would create total values which would not reflect accurately the value of the 'trade of Bahrain', From another point of view, however, it might be thought desirable to be informed the value of this Company's imports; and therefore I should be glad to have an expression of your opinion as to the desirability or otherwise of including such values in the Trade Report, please, * DIRECTOR 'DF CUSTOMS, and PORT OFFICER.

Taxation#- Private property is practically free from taxation. The income of the State is derjb/ed from the revenues collected from Custom duties. The tariff is fiKed by 'Treaty at 6 per cent M valorem on general merchandise and 10 per cent duty is levied on certain articles of luxury such as Carpets, Gillims, Cycles, Clocks, and Watches| Electrical goods, Furniture, Gramophones, Goldwi and artifical gold thread.

The tax on goods landed at Bahrain in transit to the mainland stands at 2 per cent; and an export duty of lfe.10 per bundle of hides and Ks^S per basket of dates is charged. The Custom work is carried on by a European Director of Customs under the orders of the r&amp;iler of Bahrain# The area of Bahrain is roughly 1,38,000 acres. About 1/20 of the area is cultivated. The area which is suited for cultivation is 1/12 of the whole area. The remaining area is unsuitable as it consists of rocky grounds. All cultivation in Bahrain depends on irrigation, hack of water limits agricultural expansion. The principal crops of the seasons are dates and a variety of vegetables. P. T. 0 ffn Industry»- Bahrain is famous throughout the world lor its pearl industry. In the most part the population is directly dependent for livelihood on the pearl trade. During the season Bahrain is visited by numerous Arab and Continental pearl merchants from i^lurope^ but the present decline in prices has given a severe set-back to the trade and commerce of the Islands. 'Xhe boat building and the manufacture of sails is another important industry in Bahrain, Two local firms viz. Messrs. A.M. Yateem Brothers and Mr# Khalil bin Sbrfthim Kanoo hold agencies of •♦ThomycrolV' and ''Kelvin' engines for steam launches, ihis industry is capable of further expansion,if well organized* Other industries are: reed mats, date cultivation; and there great possibilities of the 'Shell' industry being centralized in Bahrain. ines.- 'itoe Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, a subsidiary Company of the Standard Oil Company Limited of California have found oil and are actively engaged in developing their concession.

The decrease is chiefly 'due to the world-wide fall in prices of com modities and to the lack of ready money, due to the slump in the pearl trade ; actual imports have decreased and the market for better classes of goods is at a standstill. Further, since pearls are a luxury and are only bought when other wants have been satisfied, the depression is being more acutely felt in Bahrain' than elsewhere, since it is almost entirely dependent on the pearl trade for a living. Imports.—The total value of imports amounts to Rs. 97,72 ,360 as against Rs. 1,11,34,650 in 1931-32, showing a decrease of Rs. 13,62,290 or 12-23 per cent.

PERSIA Persian Gulf—Teheran Transport Railhead of the southern section of the new north to south Trans-Persian railway* is now at Salehabad or a short distance beyond that point, nearly 200 miles north of Bandar Shahpur the southern terminus on the Persian Gulf. Due to inadequate arrangements for landing and transporting cargo t at Bandar Shahpur, this port at present deals almost exclusively with Govern ment material and stores, while general cargo practically all goes up the Shatt- el-Arab—the combined estuary of the Tigris and Euphrates—to Mohammerah. There it is either transferred to river craft which carries it up the Karun River to Ahwaz, whence it goes to Salehabad by rail and onwards by road, or it is carried by road throughout from Mohammerah to Teheran. The latter method of transport takes only five days as against 13 to 15 days by river, rail and road, but—according to Economic Conditions in the Persian Gulf, a report, dated October, 1934, published by the Department of Over seas Trade—it is 10 per cent, more costly than the combined methods.■01 1H -10/4 Politlcai. /i^o^cy f Bahrain f tlie 8th May 1935&lt; Director of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain .

During the last three years Japanese imports have increased considerably. They are steadily ousting British imports of Cotton, real and imitation Silk, Yarn, Hosiery and Haberdashery, Toys, Electrical material. Rubber goods. Shoes and Glassware. The goods imported from Japan were of inferior quality but found a ready sale due to their cheapness during a period of economic stress. Imports from England, particularly in the Textile, Cotton and Silk trade, have decreased correspond ingly. In addition to the cheapness of Japanese goods a factor which favours Japanese trade is that Japanese merchants not only visit Bahrain to examine the possible avenues of trade but are will ing to import goods into Bahrain on their own account and dispose of them to local merchants as opportunity oibrs. British firms and merchants could do worse than emulate them. Financial. —The prosperity of the people depends mainly on the pearling trade, which is far from flourishing and which in turn reflects adversely on all other trade. There is a branch of the Eastern Bank Limited at Bahrain which transacts all classes of business. The Hundi system is used by the Hindu merchants. Taxation. —Private property is free from taxation. The income of the State is derived from the revenues collected from Customs duties. The tariff is fixed by Treaty at 5 per cent ad valorem on general mer chandise and 10 per cent duty is levied on certain articles of luxury such as Carpets, Gillims, Cycles, Clocks and Watches, Electrical goods, Furniture, Gramophones, Gold and artificial gold thread. Hosiery, Henna, Motor Cars, Perfumery, Toilet Soap, Silken goods, Sewing machines, Tyres and Tubes, Typewriters, Boots and Shoes, Playing Cards and 15 per cent on Alcohol, Tobacco and Cigarettes, Transit dues on goods landed at Bahrain for the mainland is 2 per cent; and an export duty o( Rs. 10 per bundle of hides and Rs. 2 per basket of dates is charged. The Customs work is under the direction of a European Director of Customs under the orders of the Ruler of Bahrain. Agriculture. —The area of Bahrain is roughlv 138,000 acres, of which 1/12 is cultivable and l/20tli under cultivation. The remaining being rocky ground is unsuitable. All cultivation in Bahrain depends on irrigation. The principal crops are dates and a variety of vegetables. Industry. —Bahrain is famous throughout the world for its pearl industry, on which the greater proportion of the people depend for a livelihood, During the season Bahrain is visited by numerous Indian and Arab and some European pearl mer chants. Boat building and the manufacture of sails is another important industry in Bahrain. Two local firms, viz., Messrs. A. M. Yateem Brothers and Mr. Khalil bin Ebrahim Kanoo hold agencies of ' Thornycroft ' and '' Kelvin ' engines for steam launches. This industry is capable of further ex pansion, if well orgainized. Other industries are : reed mats, date cultivation and there are great possibilities of the shell industry being centralized in Bahrain. Miwes.—The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited a subsidiary company of the Standard Oil Company Limited, California have found oil and are actively engaged in developing their concession.Communications and Transport. —Motor roads suit able for cars and lorries exist over the northern part of the Island. There are about 108 motor cars and 25 lorries of various types, of which 90 per cent are of American manufacture. Motor cars are available for hire. Motor boats ply regularly between Bahrain ind Qatif and Oqair and occasionally to Kuwait and pibai. The fares are cheap. There is a regular weekly steamer mail service (British India Steam Navigation Company) from and to India and 'Iraq. The East and West bound jeroplanes of Imperial Airways Limited call bi weekly. The air service also is used for commer cial freight. Social. —The discovery of oil promises to improve the economic condition of the people. The Bahrain Petroleum Company, Limited, has provided some relief to unemployment, and work in the oil-field is a great attraction for emigrants from India and other neighbouring countries. There is a community of about 70 Europeans and Americans including members of the Arabian Mission. Owing to little or no suitable accommodation being available, specially for European ladies, a number of requests for permission to land at Bahrain have had to be refused. Manamah, the capital town contains two hospitals, four schools (two for boys and two for girls), a Post Office, a Wireless Station and a branch office of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited, who also act as Agents of the Imperial Airways Limited. There is a Municipal Council in Manamah and also in the town of Muharraq. An electric power station exists at Manamah and the power is carried by a causeway and a submarine cable to Muharraq. The Political Agent, Bahrain, who is in close touch with local and mainland affairs, will be glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade from mer chants in the United Kingdom through the Depart ment of Overseas Trade. Enquiries from India should be made through the Director-General of Commercial Intelligence at Calcutta. Time probably would be saved by addressing the latter official direct, as informa tion on most ordinary matters is available in his records. G. A.

M ? 4^ '/J 0 b GThe International Tea Coiiiiaittee, 59, Mark Lane, London, E.G.3 12th Pehruary, 1936. Lear Sir Cecil, I duly received your letter of the 24th ultimo and iLUst apologise for the delay in replying to it, due to enquiries being made as to the trade in tea done by India with the Bahrein market. These enquiries have resulted in the enclosed statement of exports of tea from India to Bahrein, from which you will see that during the depression in the Indian tea trede when prices were very low, that is from 1928 to 1932, considerable quantities of tea were taken by Bahrein. Since regulation was established, however, and export prices improved in consequence the demana has fallen off very considerably, and I am afraid this market must be regarded as one which it is only possible to retain on a basis of very cheap prices at mach below the cost of production in India. It is in markets of this kind that Chinese and Japanese supplies are likely to prove attractive as these alone are available at sufficiently low prices. It is not surprising, therefore, to learn that Japanese tea is being importeu into Bahrein by way of experiment and if the consumer likes the tea I am afraid he will go on taking it as it is not possible, unless we can bring China and Japan into the regulation scheme, to do anything to stop supplies of this kind, as it would not pay India to attempt to compete with the price quoted for Japanese tea; in fact it was because India could not go te cil H. Kisch, K.C.I.S., C.B., on/ *ia Office, Wtuteiiall, S.W.I.2. on taking these low prices that the regulation scheme v.as established. Although we have obtained a certain amount of co-operation from the Chinese we have so far failed to secure any support from the Japanese in connection with the regulation scheme, and I am afraid the present political atmosphere which surrounds Japan does not encourage any hope that support may ultimately be forthcoming. There is one aspect ox this matter which has to be borne in mind and that is that India ana Ceylon tea has been pushing China ana Japan tea out of other markets which are remunerative from our point of view, and if we can retain these and, as we hope, add to them v;e can well afford to let China and Japan have some of the crumbs. I imagine that the consignment of tea the subject of your letter is the produce of Japan, or it may be Formosa. I don't think it comes from Manchuria as there is no record that tea is grown there. It might be China tea imported into Manchuria and exported from there, but this is hardly likely. The India Trade Commissioner has, I see, addressed the International Tea Market Sxpansion Board on this subject and they in their turn have reierred the matter to the International Tea Committee who will, I expect, reply much on the lines of this letter. I am afraid you may not regard this as a very satisfactory reply to your advices but I know you v&lt;ill appreciate the position, and I can assure you that we are very grateful for your continued interest and your present advices on this subject. Yours sincerely, (Sd) R. G-raham.India Office, Whitehall, S.W,1. 13th. February, 1936. Dear Grahaiu, Many thanks for your letter 01 the I3tn February about the Bahrein tea iiiatter.

Dear Colonel / FuTther as regards the information on petrol and Kerosen^imports into Bahrein requested in our letter No. PA-71 of May 2, 1934: It is now our understanding that two distinct types of Kerosene are imported — one for lighting purposes and a different one for power. If the monthly figures for Kerosene requested in our letter PA-71 could be further broken down into the amounts of the two different types imported monthly, such information would be greatly appreciated.
