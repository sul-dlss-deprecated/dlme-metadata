He relates witnessing the looting and burning of the police station in Moqattam, his neighborhood, on January 25.  Although aware of many Egyptians’ discontent with their government, he did not expect the protests of early 2011; he comments on the course of the revolution, emphasizing the importance of the first three days and the early participants.  According to ######, the revolution served as a unifying force for the university’s student body in a way that he had never seen before.</dc:description><dc:coverage>New Cairo; Egypt</dc:coverage><dc:date>2011-10-27</dc:date><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:identifier>20111027</dc:identifier><dc:relation>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution</dc:relation><dc:source>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution oral histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2012, American University in Cairo.
