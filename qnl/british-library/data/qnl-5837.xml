The kit you ask for is not here except for oil, of which X send you a case. I only have a few stores which came here from Pahrain. I fear methylated spirit is quite unobtainable here, but I have telegraphed to Basrah for some which will be sent on by next opportunity. Would it not oe ?.dvisablc to lay in a stock of such tilings before leaving Basrah because the hospitals really cannot spare any these days as they never kuo when they will get any more. The Blockade Officer and I will do our best to help your provisions buying and are very glad to see the existing stocks here exhausted by legitimate buying - send along -11 genuine buyers you can. But would you please state in^each letter approximately the number of camels in the caravan and if possible what sort of things they have come for. Dhari ibn ' uwalahs men turned up with your note *rom Hafar and next day no less than 1300 camels turned up claiming to be with him, and when «e cut down the supplies asked or they admi .ed openly that only 700 were Bhari ’ s^&gt; ^oo unless you state some approximate number e are «had' this end.

Secondly • 7e should be greatly embarassed by an unsnucessful attempt on the part of I S to capture Hail whilst if he was success ful in so doing the military advantage would not be very great and political advantages are balanced by complications v/hich would almost inevitably ensue .

A well-to-do sheikh may use a very little in his , own house but certainly the ordinary person never does. &gt; 2. Dhari’s ’armed forces' may reasonably demand the requirements of their families as from what I know of them they are ordinary Bedouins with tents and families of their own. An average of say ? souls per tent would if they are about 500 amount to 3500. X do not consider they should be given 3 months supply at once as long as they are within a day s journey of Zubeir or Koweit. Their 3 months supply would probably be gone x through much more quickly than anticipated and then we could not refuse them without - alienating their feelings towards us. Dhari does not dif-° ferentiate between his armed forces and the re mainder of his following or friends. I am sure they are all to him part of his forces. 3. Detention of Shammar with their camels is im practicable. Sa'ud es Saleh and the Dhafir are not Phiiby's pigeons. Matters concerning them will be arranged with A.?.0.Zubeir. 4. I am supplying Philby -with necessary details regarding passes to Bin Sa'ud's people. If he wants details regarding Koweit Arabdaar as for Instance Muteir in Koweit territory it is not his affair. • As long as Philby is so far away and Dhari is so near to Zubeir I think it would be much more satisfactory that AMP.0.Zubeir should control the requirements of Dhari and his following.MMG 0 N?IDKHJ 1 AL • NO » 45 —C ' political Agency, Kuwait.

March 1918 Reed. 10th. March 1913, Itn Saud. Philby has reached Bombay and will return at once via Koweit to Ibn Saud with our reply. I had hoped to rendezvous with him here but he was unable to get passage in time. After communication however I now make following final proposals for general approval. Philby will explain to Ibn Saud that we have been unable to find any suitable artillery personnel for his guns among our. prisoners of War and do not think British personnel servos the purpose so he must try and make use of his own men as heretofore and we shall be glad to train another party if necessary. As regards guns reports of our officers show that transport across Arabia through desert sand of field guns in use by us v/ould not be a feasible proposition and as regards small mountain guns he appears to have sufficient for all necessary purposes. In the above circumstances we recognise that he may not find it possible to undertake operations on such a large scale as to enable him to capture Hail and our operations are proceeding so successfully that we feel no ... that there iB^necessity to press him unduly in this connection but at any rate it is still most important that he should maintain more .effective control in Qasira and stop smuggling and put real pressure on Shammar. To this end we are prepared to assist him with 1,000 more rifles 1,00,000 rounds which Mr. Philby will place at his disposal as necessity arises. He may also regard as a gift the advance of two months subsidy made him by Mr. Philby. As regards Hail I do not consider Ibn Saud isreally keen on taking it except in circumstances which make it apparent that he is doing so at our bidding and under our discretion* At the same time should good opportunity arise for his doing so either by diplomacy or force with above meagre assistance I understand that there would be no trcJUblye doing it in principle either on part of H* M's Government. I think we should be prepared to double Ibn Saud's subsidy or give him good lump sum. I trust that general approval will be telegraphed to our proceeding on above linos and that G. 0. C. may be authorised to supply rifles. Baghdad will repeat your reply to me. As regards tribal questions with Koweit regarding Awazini and. Ajman they are in fair way to settlement and Philby will take results to Ibn Saud.

I have contradicted everything said' in the letter and have pointed out how grotesque it is - neverthe less letters like this cannot but do harm and as the writer professes to have obtained some of his information from recent arrivals from Syria. Would suggest that measures be taken to intern all known residents of enemy towns found in Kuwait. sole object is to stir up Ibn Saud against the blockade. I have already asked that genuine residents of NAjd be exempted from the ♦&gt; of‘the blockade in order that my work here may not be prejudiced. received here yesterday in the shape of a letter from Majid ibn Ajil of the Abda, brother of Aqab ibn Ajil who is at Hajr with Ibn Rashid, asking Ibn Saud for Aman. the neighbourhood of Hail Ibn Saud has at my suggestion replied to Majid that if he and all the Abda.Care to come and settle in the Hasa, i.e. south of Safa, he will receive them into friendship but otherwise he will treat them as enemies wherever met with. He has however informed them that they wil on no account be allowed to go to Kuwait and I request that henceforth Musabila with Kuwait be refused to all Shammar except those accompanied by Dhari ’ s agents, regarding whom I frave already written to P.A. Kuwait. Majid wrote from Lina - it remains to be se n whether he and the other Abda Shaikhs accept Ibn Saud’s -terms. The opening sentences make it quite clear that the writers Ample testimony of its effect on the enemy element was As it is important .to get all- Shammar elements away froms-f] If the Kuwait blockade post can 'effectually stop all illicf smuggling i.e. export by any but I bn Baud's subjects it will help materially in the realisation of Ibn Baud's plans, which I hope will begin to operate about the end' of Shaban or beginning of Ramdhan.

Now—adays the papers are full of news and people come to us from Damascus, Baghdad and asra. In short they tell of an increase of troops in Palestine mostly German and Austria. Also they say im Lamia iias r*c uuxned l&gt;o Syria and uhey tell of the Turks treatment * of them and their large gifts to theum-of course this has reached you-of weapons and guns etc. Papers from Egypt etc. telT of the - increased tension of the war specially in Prance-and speak of the state of Itly and of the conclusion of pjeace with Russia. Also the American President has propounded 17 conditions of peace of which they have accepted some and rejected others. The Egypt and Syria papers say that the fighting in Prance now—a-days is in the neighbourhood of Paris and Rome and that the French have moved uheir capital to another place in their territory about ^ - 70 miles from $&gt;aris on the Mediterranian coafct (1) Again we . hear that the reinforcements for Syria number nearly one million and that the Turks have advanced and cut the line of retreat 'Of the English in Jerusalem and that the Sharif's son- Faisal has been defeated near Karak and the Balqa'- The Sharif’s troops fled and all the prisoners were slain and the Turks have advanced against the English as it seems and are about Jaffa and Gaza as regards the defeat of the Sharif’s son they say 300 of the Huwaitat were slain These bits of news we have oaken xrom ohe papers and some of. it from people from Damascus and Baghdad .

M-62 of April 30th (received May loth and sent on same day) and connected correspondence. The turning away was carried out with so little incident that I did not think it necessary to sen^i you any detailed account. What happened was that on the arrival of the two ships I went to see Shaikh , informed him of the enormous quantities of goods asked for by the various uaravans anu. the Mutair ana tola him that it was necessary txiat they suould , with the certain exceptions, leave with only provi sions for the journey. Then the headmen were called in uia I explained the whole thing to them and said that I regretted that it was necessary to take this action,but that I was v/riting to Bin Saud who would make an arrangement with you after which they would get supplies according to whatever was settled between you. I gave each man a letter to his Amir explaining this. Everything went off quite peacefully,the Mutair went off next day and the caravans during the next liwp. They were required to pass by the house at Shuwaikh so that we could see tiiat they went empty . In case of disturbance two machine guns were placed on the Agency ( Shuwaikh) roof. No troops were landed but on tht last day a party of marines aid bluejackets were brought on shore as we wished to search the one remaining caravan ( Shagrah) for axins and ammunition, as we had x’e oeived a report ixiat they were taking them out in their saddles . Nothing was found and the proceedings were quite friendly.

Relations 'between Ibn Saud and King Hussein are becoming increasingly strained and may lead to hostilities or ewen an open rupture by their respective adherents. Accurately to appreciate wariety of points at issue between them is not possible but a warning a/rainst giving provocation addressed impartially to each would be I think salutary. Subject to your concurrence I suggest following message for transmission officially by Cairo and Baghdad respectively to King Hussein and Ibn Saud: 'That His Majesty 1 s Government note with regret the ill feeling shown in their recent correspondence to exist between King Hussein and ^Dnir Ibn Saud and regard it as seriously prejudicial to thsir interest and to the common cause. Any action by either party or their followers liable to aggravate situation or to provoke hostilities would be regarded by m.m.G. with grave 0 disfavour' Subject to your concurrence I will at once notify King Hussein as above and inform him identical warning is being addressed to Ibn Saud by Baghdad. Colonel TJr il son is being instructed to induce King Hussein to recall Emir Abdalla to 7'ecca. King Hussein who is in a nervous state could be assisted by Abdullah and would be kept in closer communication with us at Hecca.

Having made this arrangement hr.Philby set off into the unknown and vre heard no more of him. Neither apparently did )hari for towards the end of Karch he wrote to me as follows:- I beg to inform your honour that 4 months ago I left Safwan as Government wanted me to go to Buraidah. tn obefdionce to the Government orders I came to q,asim side. The British Government promised mo .increase of nay and informed me that my pay and provisions were transferred to buraidah and that Nr.Fhilby A,P.0.3uraidah would give me necessary ord-rs. X wrote many letters to ^uraida and also sent some letters with my men to Mr. Hamilton at Riadh but 1 have not found any politi cal officer at Oasim. I on perplexed as I do not know what orders Government have about me. how I have come this place as ordered by the High Government for whom X have been loyal and this t s known. I beg that my pay and provisions may be sent to mo as promised and orders may also be conveyed to me. I sent letters to the British Consul, K;oweit and Tr r. ITncCollum, \,P.0. Sobeir but no reply has been received. Kindly send reply with the messenger of this letter.' About the same time *'r. Philby reappeared in Basrah. He made no complaint whatever as to the way in which Dhari had discharged the duties entrusted to him. On the con trary hr. Philby paid Dhari Rs.15,000/- the amount due t&amp; him at the WHwh enhanced rate arranged by r.Philby in the preceding November and* returned through his camp to Borcideh vie. the Batin and Hafar. hr. Philby never gave any information to this office, or to the Political Agent at Ko^eit of the further payments m-be by him to Dhari or told us what it was that he now required Dhari to do. Whatever it was, by Mr.Philby*s own showing, Dhari did not do it, but, being now put in possession of ample funds by Mr.Philby 1 s payments, amounting to Rs.24,000/- in ell, etarted trading with the enemy. r. i Philby meanwhile had once more passed ffom our ken and was said to be travelling in Harij and towards the Dawasir valley. The mere mention of these names is'L G - 3 - enou^ig^to show how idle is '\ny talk of )hari and the \s 1 f?jyi being retained under his control, seeing that the latter were encamped ^ithin a day or two of Koweit and 2obeir, but were not within a month ! s journey of Lr. Fhilby. It may also be mentioned once more that no intimation whatever was given by Ir.Philby either to this O'fice or to Koweit, as to Dhari’s shortcomings. In fact up to the 20th April Hr.Philby does not seem to have been aware of them. For an that date he wrote to Koweit asking that persons bearing written authority from Dhari ibn Tuwalla should be given foodstuffs to reasonable amounts. This letter was not presented - before the Political '‘gent at noweix until near the end of May. The incident is in jet itself sufficient proof of the impracti cability of leaving a parcel of scamps, like iihari and his Asian, under the nominal control of an officer who resides in i-he remoter recess of large continent, gives no indication thence of his views or wishes with regard to those whose actions he is supposed to be watch ing. I may add that since Dhari came back to these parts from hafar/noJpayment of his allowance ha* been made l J / to 'him, and the rate at which that allowance is payable has been reduced to the figure at which it stood before lir.Philby took control of l.is affairs. I in communication with the Assistant iolitipal Officer, Zobeir as to the charges against Dhari now made by lr.Philby. He will enquire into them and. submit his report.

Should there cease to be friendship between them a calamity would threat -en the whole Arab people and there would be no advantage to any but those tas who wish them ill. His Kajesty's Government appeal to both to show wisdom and forbearance. A common enemy threatens the independence of the Arabs. How often have the Arabs lost their independence because of being disunited by a power which could not otherwise have conquered them? In this age of world - r ar misunderstanding between Arabs ^ould not only heln the enemy to rob Arabs of the liberties they have won but would impede efforts which KisHajesty’s Government are making to free rest of Arabs who are still under the yoke of the Turkish oppressor.

Thirdly it seems to me very likely if we drive all Shammar away from river to join Ibn Saud they are likely to go to Ibn Rashid. They at any rate will not fight against Ibn Rashid. I quite agree that all Shauimar should be kept short of food but it seems to me much better to leave everyone in their places while Ibn Saud strides his blow.
