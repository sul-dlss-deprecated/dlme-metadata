Letter no.42 of 1854 (folios 202-03) from Kemball to Commodore George Robinson, Commanding Officer Persian Gulf Squadron, dated 6 February 1854. Kemball informs Robinson of intelligence he has received from the Native Agent at Sharjah, Hajjī Yaqoob, relating to the fine imposed upon the Banyan by Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Sultan. Although Kemball understands that the money has now been restored to the Banyan, he requests that Robinson make clear to the Joasmee [Qasimi] shaikhs that the British Government will be prepared to intervene in such cases where the fines levied are of an ‘arbitrary of discriminative character’. Enclosed with Kemball’s letter is a translated extract of a letter sent by Hajjī Yaqoob to Kemball, dated 29 December 1854, containing the original details of the incident. Yaqoob’s letter suggests that the Banyan shopkeeper was imprisoned and fined by Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Sultan because he only sold goods to the people of Debaie [Dubai].2. Letter no.38 of 1854 (folio 204) from Robinson to Kemball, dated 20 February 1854. Robinson writes that, at the time of his interview with Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Sultan at Lingah [Bandar-e Lingeh], Shaikh ‘Abdullāh had not as yet received Kemball’s letter. However, Robinson writes that Shaikh ‘Abdullāh has agreed to comply with Kemball’s demands, presumably in relation to the remittance of the fine.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x00002a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
