As you are aware, my cars are out of commission and consequently my business is decayed. Four or six tyres cannot do anything and will not meet the requirmentsi I am still experiencing difficulties in this respect. I, therefore, request you to look into this and arrange to let me have what remained out of last year’s permit so that the problem of my cars may be solved and my business gets through. I am very confident that you will give your full attention to this and help in my obtaining the remainder of the permit in question for which I shall remain very grateful to you.

COPY t No. C/1646. Dated the 15th November 1944. To His Excellency Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani, C.I.E., Ruler of Qatar. After compliments: On the visits to Qatar which I have made during the past thirteen months I have frequently drawn Your Excellency's attention to reports which have been received that quota goods were being re-exported from your country both to the Persian and Arab side of the Gulf. I have desired Your Excellency on many occasions to take immediate steps to prevent a position which was quite illegal and contrary to the interests of the peoplp of your country. It has now become clear from further reports received from all parts of the Gulf and from other investigations that far from co-operating in the prevention of smuggling Your Excellency has condoned the practice and that your son Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah has both directly and indirectly encouraged persons engaged in this nefarious trade with the result that much suffering and hardship has been caused to the people of your country, who in consequence have been forced to leave it. 2. I have felt it my duty to inform the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf of these facts. The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has decided that in order to ensure a fair distribution of grain, sugar, tea, piecegoods, and in fact all quota goods, to the population it will be necessary to introduce a system of rationing under the direct control of this Agency. It is intended that a representative of this Agency shall take up his residence at Doha and will supervise the distribution of all goods through a reliable merchant who will be appointed by me from Bahrain. This system will be introduced as soon as the arrangements can be completed and I anticipate will be functioning from the 15th of December if not before. 3. As it is clear from the actions of Your Excellency and in particular of your son Shaikh Hamad that you and your immediate relatives and their families are amply supplied with food-stuffs and commodities of all kinds it is not proposed to make any allotment to.you or to them. This prohibition will not of course apply to the members of Your Excellency's tribe who have taken no part in the re-export of quota goods.

Consequent on cessationof hostilities and general improvement in tyre supply position, Government of India have decided to increase existing quotas of tyres and tubes for Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms by 50 % and to allow export of increased quotas during last quarter of current year. The attached statement gives revised quotas and inter-ccmpany allocations approved for 1945. 2. It is also considered desirable that existing procedure for drawing tyre supplies from India by the Persian Gulf Shakhdoms should be modified and the strict control hitherto exercised over release of tyres and tubes allotted to them should be permitted to export tyres and tubes allotted to them to their accredited dealers in Persian Gulf without the Government of India’s waiting for receipt of orders, certified by the Political Agents concerned, from the dealers. This would minimise delay in supply. Government of India would be gald to have your views in the matter before they adopt revised procedure. The issue of the above has been authorised. 3d/- Raja Ram.
