Dear Colonel Galloway, The comments which occupyto me on the subject of Gray, Mackenzie f s a copy of which forms an enclosure to your D.0.No.(90/2/48), dated the 18th September, 1948, are: (a) I do not like monopolies and Gray, Mackenzie are certainly no more deserving of one than any other British firm. It strikes me also that the term ought to be limited to say 10 years - in the case of landing cargo and of the agency for steamers; and (b) Gray, Mackenzie might do well as State pur chasing agents,and, in the case of Qatar,it would probably be well for them to have agents of that kind.

Dear Burrows, I enclose a copy of a letter I have received from Mr. Allcard, the Manager of Messrs Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co., Limited in Bahrain, from which you will see that he wishes (a) to obtain a contract for landing cargo in Qatar; (b) to establish an office at Doha; (c) to obtain an exclusive concession to v act as steamer agents in Qatar, and (d) to act as purchasing agents for the Shaikh. 2. My comments are that while there is considerable criticism of Gray Mackenzie’s work, they, neverthless, are an important factor in our position in the Gulf because of their shipping associations. In 1944, the Bahrain Petroleum Company quarelled with them and only after great difficulty was the matter settled and Gray Mackenzie re-established in their position vis-a-vis Bahrein Petroleum Company. His Majesty’s Government’s attitude at that time was that they ’’attach great importance to doing all that is possible to assist Gray Mackenzie to maintain their position in Bahrain”. 3. As regards (a): I see no objection. Their establishment outside Petroleum Concessions work would increase the British position in Qatar, (b); and (c): no objection. As regards (d): I have no objection but suggest that (a), (b) and (c) be dealt with first. 4. As regards the Treaty position; Article 7 of the Treaty of 1916 is held in abeyance by Sir Percy Cox’s letter of the 3rd November, 1916, and before Gray Mackenzie may approach the Shaikh of Qatar it is necessary that the Political Agent should consult the Shaikh and obtain his agreement to allow British subjects into Qatar for purposes of trade in which, ofcourse, is included landing arrangements. I should be grateful for instructions that I may ask Pelly to ask the Shaikh to permit British subjects to enter Qatar for purposes Of trade. Gray Mackenzie would then be free to approach the Shaikh.

Please refer to Galloway’s letter No,(90/4/48) of 27th September about Gray Mackenzie’s application for a contract to land cargo in Qatar etc. We thought this provided as with a good opportunity to mention to Gray Mackenzies some of the criticisms about their work which have recently come to our notice, and to point out to them that while we were only too glad to do all in our power to promote the interests of British Companies in this area, there was none the less a strong obligation on them to ensure that the service they provided was at least as efficient, if not more efficient than anything else obtainable, and that they must do everything possible to reduce grounds of complaint to a minimum. Mr, Batley, the representative of the company who discussed the matter with us, agreed that this obligation did exist, and while remarking that many of the complaints, which had hitherto been-made against them had on investigation proved.to be ill-founded, assured us that his company were doing every thing in their power to improve their service in the Persian Gulf, and to eliminate any justifiable causes of complaint,. We accordingly agreed to authorise you to take such action as you consider necessary to further their application for a contract in Qatar. I should, therefore, be grateful if you would now ask Pelly to approach the Shaikh with a view to securing permission fornBritish subjects to enter Qatar for purposes of trade. Gray Mackenzie may there-after pursue the matter on their own behalf. I am sending a copy of this letter to Baghdad and Basra, as we took the opportunity to refer in conversation with Batley to reports (in Basra monthly summaries of earlier this year) about the labour conditions of the company’s employees at Basra.

He indicated that he was agreeable to meeting him and to hearing what he had to say. As I mentioned to you verbally, and I understood you agreed, that is, I think, the test way to introduce Gray Mackenzies, rather than to press for general permission to trade.

I agree that a gradual relaxation of the reservations agreed to in the Cox letter of 1916 is the best method of approach. 2. I am not sure, however, that we are wise in supporting the intention of Gray Mackenzie to secure exclusive rights, at least in the fjrst instance. In view of their indifferent record in the Gulf, which is partly the result of a practical monopoly, it might be best at first for the firm simply to be given permission to operate. The question of whether this should later be turned into a monopoly would depend upon how things go. The firm would not be prejudiced by being put on trial in this way since, under Clause V or the 1916 Treaty, tne Shaikh cannot grant monopolies without the consent of His - Majesty's Government and we- could, if we wished, protect the position of Gray Mackenzie should the Shaikh later wish to favour another British or American company without good cause. Itake it that it is most unlikely.that the prospect of their not being granted a monopoly would dissuade the firm from starting business which is surely likely to be profitable. I shall be grateful for your views. (SGD). B.A.B. BURRC1S.Political Agency, S.O.Ho.C/Q-37 Bahrain, September 13, 1949. Dear Wilton Allcard came to see me this morning about some instructions passed to Gray Mackenzie in Qatar by Shaikh Ali through the local Customs. They were to the effect that Gray Mackenzie should cease sending Bahrainis on ships to unload cargo in Qatar and employ local labour instead. 2, Gray Mackenzie maintain as a principle that these men are members of the ships’ crew and as such unloading is part of their work whatever port they may be in. Gray Mackenzie however are quite willing to help Qatar labour problems by admitting trainees on board. But obviously they cannot immediately switch over the work of unloading which calls for considerable experience and some skill to entirely untrained personnel. 3. Allcard is accompanying Lermitte to Qatar on Thursday to convince the Shaikh of this. You should give him every support and you should incidentally train your local Gray Mackenzie to bring their problems to you rather than refer them to Bahrain. Yours sincerely, H.G. Jakins A.J. Wilton, Esq., Political Officer, Qatar, Doha.No.C/Q-48 Political Agency, Bahrain, September 18, 1949 Deer Wilton i* • ^ I wrote to you on September 13 under No. C/Q-37 informing you of Allcard's impending visit to Qatar. The letter was delivered to P.C.L. here at about 1.15 p.m. on the same day but Allcard tells me that you still had not received it by the time he arrived. On the other hand a letter he had addressee to Hart had been received. 2. I know that Hart is in Dukhan and you are in Doha but at the same time much of the advantage of sending stuff by air is lost if someone somewhere sits on it. 3.

Political Agency, Bahrain, September 19, 1949. Derr Sir Rupert, I asked Allcard what conclusions he had reached from his visit to Doha on September 15. 2. He said that the only good available house had apparently been taken by Weightman, that he could get no clear idea of the population and there fore the trade prospects in Qatar, that it would cost Gray Mackenzie £2,000 to have a man there, that they had no suitable person to send and so on. 3. I told him that Darwish was importing rice in Qatar, why not Gray Mackenzie? That a lot of money would soon be pouring into the place and that there would be developmentss a power plant, perhaps a water condenser and so on and that it seemed to me that Gray Mackenzie ought to be in on some of this. 4. Allcard said that their man Hart in Dukhan was not suitable to be the firm's representative in Doha. Their difficulty was that they had had to expand rapidly and had no trained staff. Two new men who were coming along nicely were being sent to Muscat and Dubai respectively but their departure meant that the work in Bahrain would be put back again by the advent of two trainees. He said however that hfe would go through his subordinate staff with the object of finding someone to seed to Qatar to live there. Such a man would not be a fully-fledged representative but would sit about and collect informa* tion and so prepare the way for the future.

Dear Wilton Gray Mackenzies wish to approach the Shaikh of Qatar with the object of making a lighterage agreement Y/ith him as they have with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and hope to have with Dubai. The usual conditions are that in exchange for the right to land all cargo they pay the Shaikh a royalty and the usual term is for twenty-five years. Gray Mackenzies of course provide the lighters which they tell me cost £10,000 each - hence the necessity for an agreement and some security of tenure. 2. I told Allcard, who raised the matter with me, that he might stand a better chance of pulling off an agreement if he waited until Shaikh Abdulla was out of the way. Is there any fresh hope of his going and what do you think of Gray Mackenzies chances? Yours sincerely, H.G. Jakins A.J. Wilton, Esq., Political Officer, Qatar, Doha.Extract of paragraph 6 of letter No.1/30/49 of October 20, 1949, from Mr. A.J. Wilton, P.O., Qatar, to Mr. H.G. Jakins, P.A., Bahrain. received further evidence of the speed with which the Darwish are proceeding to use their influence with the Shaikh to obtain a monopoly of everything worth having in Qatar. I have already reported how they had succeeded in penetrating Khalid al Mani's new company. He has just informed me that the Shaikh, having learned that he was putting a house in order for Gray Mackenzie's, flew into a rage and wished to know why he was doing so, when he, the Shaikh, had already agreed with Gray Mackenzie's to provide them with premises. Khalid tried to say that he had heard of no such arrange ment, either from the Shaikh or from Gi?y Mackenzie's but could not obtain a hearing. I have told him to take the matter up with the Shaikh again when he is in a calmer mood, and if he persists in his opposition to what is a perfectly regular and above-board transaction between two free commercial firms, to advise Hart to bring it to my attention officially, so that I can tax the Shaikh with it. 6.
