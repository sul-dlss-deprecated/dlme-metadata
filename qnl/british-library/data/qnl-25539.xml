In February an examination of the Tigris between Qurna and Amarah was made by Sir George Buchanan. He reported tnat, subject to a confirmation of his views wnen surveys had been made it was his opinion that to improve greatly the channel in the low water season was practicable. This could be effected by easement of bends, and by judicious dredging of bars and by the construction across various canals of temporary emergency weirs taking off from the Tigris with the object of keeping in the river proper the bulk of the low water f® flow. One suitable dredger recently used on the Indus has been ordered from India and the surveys are in hand. Owing to the difficulty of carrying out the work without depriving the local tribes of a large quantity of water to which, for the irrigation of their Crops, they have been accustomed, the proposed construction of emergency weirs has caused some discussion. It is believed, however that arrange ments can be made enabling sufficient water for irrigation purposes to be at the disposal of the tribes. Considerable quantities of plant and material for building the weirs have arrived at Basrah and as soon as possible the work?will be commenced.Buchanan thinks that above Amarah navigation can he improved by survey ing and by marking the channel along length where any difficulties occur, and this will receive attention.puk Wiai lovdijn Jqmvttncnt Simla, the December 1915 .

Secret Department. Prom Viceroy, 11th November 1915. Foreign Secret. Arabia. Your telegram 8th November. We find nothing in McMahon’s telegram of 5th November to palliate in any way position he has brought about, and fact remains that althugh he could apparently, without imperilling the negotiations, safeguard other interests at Alexandretta, Mersina and Syria, he yet found it necessary to guarantee to Arabs the rendition of territories in Mesopotamia won by our arms in face not only of Turkish but also of Arab opposition, without which Turks alone would have been of small account. Moreover, from information received from Sir Reginald Wingate, it appears that leaders in Egypt were quite ready to recognise as a necessity the incorporation of certain portions ofMesopotamia in the British Empire and would not oppose it. Further, it need hardly be pointed out that financing of huge irrigation schemes by which the prosperity of Mesopotamia is enhanced a hundredfold is not likely to be encouraged by fact of the creation of an Arab State and administration, and the whole country would be likely to lapse into a worse condition than under Turkish rule and be a source of danger to British political and commercial interests. The possession of Basra is in our opinion essential for the protection of Abadan and the security of our interests in oil-fields. We are still in dark as to actual quid pro quo to be given by Arabs in return for those sweeping assurances, but trust it may be of sufficiently definite character to enable us, if Arabs fail to perform their part, to repudiate those assurances—at any rate as far as Mesopotamia is concerned. As regards proclamation we agree that in view of chaotic position created by McMahon’s assurances it will be best if General Nixon on occupation of Bagdad issued no proclamation at all except perhaps a formal notice calling upon civil population to acquiesce quietly in our occupation, and assuring them, should they do so, their persons, property, and religion will be scrupulously respected. In India we propose, as soon as Bagdad is actually occupied, to suppress news for day or two, and to publish following proclamation :—“ [R.] His Majesty’s Government have authorised General. Nixon to advance on Bagdad, his forces having once more defeated Turkish opposition on Tigris in vicinity of Suliman Pak. Not only for military reasons is this advance necessary, but in order to relieve British ladies and British Indian subjects who, contrary to usage of civilised war, have been detained at Bagdad ; and in order to break up a focus of German intrigue in middle East. His Majesty’s Government, however, desire that it should be clearly understood that stringent orders have been issued that every precaution should be taken to prevent sacred shrine of Sheikh Abdul Qadir, Gilani, and the other tombs and shrines in the vicinity, from being in any way even accidentally damaged in course of the operations, in accordance with their unswerving policy of respecting the sacred places of Islam and the susceptibilities of the Moslem community ; and they wish it clearly to be understood that in regard to all other Holy Places in Mesopotamia, this policy has been and will be scrupulously followed, and that no obstacle whatever wall be placed in way of Imams, Ulemas, Mujtahids and other religious persons following freely and as usual their ordinary religious practices, after occupation of Bagdad.”r- X ^^Lk.

Irrigation in Iraq.. Sir John Mixon's telegram of 14th June was sent after nerusal of Sir William Willcocks reports. It seems to Army Commander that if an expert could have arrived immediately while the waters were still at highest flood level he might have found it possible without prejudice to Sii William's more ambitious schemes to suggest some measures which would improve the navigation for the purpose of this expedition and at the same time benefit position of the inhabitants in regard to irrigation. Mr. Whitley was consulted but I would mention that the latter is construction Engineer rather than irrigation expert. He concurs with following statements. With Kut al Amareh in our possession improvement of navigation and benefitting of irrigation suggested above woul&lt;3 m y opinion be secured by the control and remodelling on scientific principleds) of various big canals now existing in the neighbourhood of Amardh, The quick returns to be anticipated from these measures would I believe ensure their ultimate financial success well before any possible change of conditions could result from establishment of more far reaching irrigation systems upstream of Kut.

It is however recognised that in view of Sir William's unique experience (of) irrigation in Mesopotamia and his public enthusiasm in regard thereto any scheme at all impinging on his proposals should if possible have his preliminary concurrence in principle or be subjected to expert scrutiny by the light of his complete reports. Indeed the whole problem is of such vital importance and Sir William's knowledge and reputation so unrivalled that Army Commander desires me to urge Government of India to consider expediency of inviting him to visit Iraq this autumn to advise on irrigation questions, if his expenses are paid he might be willing to undertake mission without special salary. Deputation of an exoert with necessary staff by the Government of India would be none the less necessary. He would take executive charge of operations and will act in general in consultation with Sir William Willcocks.Letter No. £6o-5-Q., dated loth (received 2ist) September 1915. From—The General Officer Commanding, Force a D, ’* Basrah. To—The Chief of the General Staff. I have the honour to submit for the information of the Government of India, a report by Lieutenant Stoddard, I. A. R. (Special Irrigation Officer), on &lt;f The Possibilities of the Development of Irrigation in the Basrah District, ” together with a forwarding letter by Brigadier-General Rimington, R. E., and a note by Sir Percy Cox, Chief Political Officer. 2 . Lieutenant Stoddard discusses the Basrah Barrage project, which was the scheme definitely put forward for this area by Sir W. Willcocks in his “Report on Irrigation in Mesopotamia ”, but owing to the lack of information and details, he has been unable to formulate a workable scheme. Moreover, the work would be very costly, with only the prospect of a very moderate return on the outlay. He consequently discards this project in favour of one which gives promise of being very successful and remunerative, vis., the reclamation of 100,000 acres of land West of Gurmat Ali, annually flooded by the spill waters of the Tigris and Euphrates. 3 . This scheme was only lightly touched on by Sir W. Willcocks in his report as one that was suitable for development by local enterprise. From its favour* able financial aspect, and from the fact that it would not interfere with the Barrage Scheme if that should be undertaken later, it appears to me to be one worthy of further investigation, and as such I would recommend it for consideration. 4 . At the same time, l would remark that as Sir W. Willcocks has made a very thorough study of irrigation prospects in Mesopotamia, and has definite y put forward certain schemes, it would appear to be only fair to him, and also very desirable in the interests of the State, that his opinion on the subject be sought. It is very probable that he could provide further information which would throw quite a different light on the Barrage project. 5 . I submit that the undertaking of a large irrigation scheme for the benefit of the country would have the best possible effect in establishing a sense of peace and security and would afford an earnest of our intention to promote the welfare of the people. Note by Sir P. Z. Cox, Chief Political Officer, dated 6 tk September 1915 . Please see your Office memorandum No. 850 - 4 -Q. and original papers for warded therewith, which I now return. I have studied Lieutenant Stoddard’s report and Sir William Willcocks’ proposals in so far as they are available. To generalize for a moment. My be lief is that until the duration of our stay in Basrah and the extent of the country which we intend to control is decided for certain, the Government of India will not take into lively consideration any project involving large outlay, unless it be strongly justified for strategical as well as economic reasons, connected with the occupation of Basrah, and can be shewn not to conflict with any more comprehensive scheme. On the other hand, Government will no doubt agree as to the importance of having our views and plans crystalized, so that as soon as the word is given, no time need be lost in putting them into execution. Again, as you probably know, Sir William Willcocks is a person of strong views and an enthusiast in regard to irrigation. 1 know he holds the opinion that the irrigation of Mesopotamia is a humanitarian problem of world wide interest and significance, and that the handling of it as a whole on the lines best calculated to benefit mankind concerned should be prejudiced by no secular or secondary interest. In irrigation circles he occupies too prominent a position to be ignored. In any project, therefore, which we may put forward we must have his approvalI or must be prepared for his expert criticism. As a layman I am not in a position to express any useful view as to whether Sir William s Basrah Scheme has reasonable prospects of proving a paying concern, but I feet convinced that Government would not in any case commit themselves to it at the present stage of our occupation of Basrah. Turning now to Lieutenant Stoddard’s report. He discusses three minor schemes:— (i) To improve the agricultural position in neighbourhood of Basrah by' placing sluices on existing creeks. (n) To extend some of these creeks inland so as to bring more land under cultivation. (m) To reclaim a small fraction of the marsh area covered by Sir William Willcocks’ comprehensive scheme, by constructing the Euphrates^ Barrage and a drain from the Barrage to the Khor Abdulla via Zubair. I have not the technical knowledge to differ from General Rimington’s professional appreciation of the above schemes but agree with him that projects for the irrigation of the Basrah Area cannot be satisfactorily considered without reference to Sir William Willcocks'' full plans. Judging by the data at present available, it does not appear that the remune rative prospects of (?) or (it) are such as to make it likely that Government would entertain either of them. As regards the (in) project, however, there is to my mind a good deal to be said, as apart from its apparently remunerative character, and the fact that it is an actual slice of Sir William Willcocks’ integral scheme ; it seems to have th ! e strategical advantage of doing away in a great measure with the flooded area between Basrah and Shaiba, which so complicates the defence of Basrah. It will also incidentally be a great boon to Zubair both because it will im prove the route between Zubair and Basrah and because the drain from the Barrage to the head of the Khor Abdulla will provide it with an improved water- supply and possibly communication with the sea. I hardly think it likely that without a good deal more examination, the - Government of India will seriously consider even this scheme but see no reason why Lieutenant Stoddard’s report should not go on, to shew Government the lines on which we are thinking and with the suggestion that the third scheme seems worth immediate further examination with a view to sanction in principle. Even as regards this scheme, however, since it cuts into Sir William* Willcocks’ main project, I think his view's should be asked on it, and to one so familiar with the subject, this could probably be done in a telegram. Memo. No. E.-5-11-39, dated the 26th August 1915, From—The Brigadier General, R.E., To—The Deputy Adjutant and Quartermaster-General, General Head Quarters* I submit 2nd-Lieutenant Stoddard s report on possible irrigation schemes* in the Basrah District. ^ should be very loth to say that the scheme put forward bv Sir W. Willcocks on pages 34 to 40 of his Report on Irrigation in Mesopotamia is impracticable especially as he says he had studied the question for two \ears and had decided that this was the best method of dealing with this tract but I consider that Lieutenant Stoddard has discussed this scheme very soundly, and I agree with him that the information and details given are too meagre to criticise the proposals fairly. It certainly is not evident how a barrage at 2 or even 2 5 metres above mean sea level will suffice to provide water for a large area, the average level of which would appear to be over e metres above mean sea level.- • .* ^ \ s m o r G than probable that Sir W. Willcocks had a good deal more' information on the subject than he thought necessary or advisable to publish in his book. If it should be decided that the Basrah Irrigation scheme should be investi gated and developed, l consider that it would be only right that Sir W, Willcocks himself should be referred to. In the meanwhile, considering the difficulties, the large cost, and the comparatively small anticipated return, I am of opinion that it is not worth while to discuss it further. 2. We next come to the consideration of the much less ambitious proposals put forward in paragraphs 7 to 9 of Lieutenant Stoddard’s report, which consist in putting in automatic tidal sluices on the creeks so as to hold the water up to high tide level, and extending the creeks or canals into the desert, thus providing irrigation only from the river direct. This scheme is a simple one, and is to a certain extent suitable, but it seems to me doubtful whether it would lend itself to linking up with Willcocks’ scheme hereafter as Lieutenant Stoddard suggests, since in this the irrigation would be by lift, whereas Willcocks evidently intended a scheme of flow irrigation for this tract. The levels of the canals would therefore be quite different. Moreover, a large portion of the area is already under cultivation, so it is doubtful whether even the reduced rate of revenue anticipated is justified. In my opinion it would be better to defer all consideration of the irrigation of this area until fuller information concerning Willcocks’ scheme has been obtained; then the irrigation of the Basrah area could be dealt with as a whole. 3. The third scheme put forward by Lieutenant Stoddard, viz.^ reclaiming 100,000 acres of the swamps lying to the west of Gurmat Ali seems to me far more favourable and likely to prove a great deal more profitable. At first I was not inclined to favour this scheme as Willcocks said he had for two years care fully considered the reclamation of these marshes and had finally discarded the idea in favour of the barrage scheme, his reason being that he feared the effect of draining the large flood reservoir which supplied the’Shatt-el-Arab during the months of low supply. Yet we find on pages 39 and 40 that he suggests the re clamation of a part of this area, though he apparently anticipates that it will be done by private enterprise and says no public works of any kind are required. I venture to think that a scheme well considered and properly laid out would be far more likely to be successful and profitable than the crude individual efforts of the local cultivation. I do not think that Lieutenant Stoddard’s scheme which only contemplates the reclamation of 100,000 acres would seriously affect the supply of water from the swamped area, which comprises 800,000 hectares or 2 million acres. If we take the amount of water required to be a depth of ij feet, the total amount required would be 176,600,000 cubic metres, which is equivalent to only 5 days of the lowest supply of the Euphrates. Moreover as the loss from evaporation is about half of the lowest supply, we are only actually reducing the reservoir by about days’ supply. It would I think be quite feasible to arrange this reclamation so that it would not interfere with Willcocks’ barrage scheme if that should be undertaken later. Lieutenant Stoddard has allowed very full rates and even so he estimates the return on the capital outlay at 11 per cent* This is a very high figure and would be far mere profitable than the barrage scheme which, according to Willcocks’ figures, would only pay about 4 per cent. This project I think is well worth further investigation. (Sd.) J. C, RIMINGT 0 N, Brigadier-General, R, E., Indian Expeditionary Force “ D %4 Brief Report on the possibilities of development of irrigation in the Basrah district. The land available for cultivation in the Basrah district consists of two sepa rate tract one being the strip of low desert lying roughly parallel to the course of the Shatt el Arab, ordinarily dry but subject to mundation by high nver floods and the other the perennially swamped marshes through which the Eunhrates is cutting a new channel to Gurmat Ali. This report is concerned wuth the possibilities of die development of both the above tracts, the desert area be- ing dealt with first. 2. This tract is practically level throughout and its irrigation presents certain difficulties. Sir W. Willcocks has proposed a perennial irrigation scheme for an area of 90,000 hectares or about 225,000 acres, which is described on pages 34 to 40 of his report on the “ Irrigation of Mesopotamia. ■- 2. The main outlines of the scheme Sir W. WUlcocks' scheme for the irrigation of the desert tract. are \ id) A barrage in the new Euphrates Channel, a few miles above Gurmat Ali, to retain water to a level of 2 or 2^ metres above mean sea level. (b) Repairs to old Euphrates right bank and construction of embankment to divert Tigris spills to Gurna (Kurna^ and reduce the area of the reservoir behind the barrage. Ic) A canal to Fao passing roughly midway between Zuba.ir and Zubair Gats with branches to the Ashar and Abu Filus creeks. (d) A separate canal from the barrage connecting with the Ashar creek branch of the Fao canal. (e) A main drain into the north head of the Khor Zubair or Khor Abdulla* Sir W. Willcocks proposed to commence by irrigating an area of 35,000 hectares or about 87,500 acres, constructing the Fao canal of reduced width as far as the Abu Filus creek branch. This preliminary is illustrated on map No. 76 of the portfolio accompanying the report. The report on the scheme is so lacking in detail and the available information relating to natural surface and river levels so limited that it is only possible at the present time to form general opinions on the suitability of the proposals. 3. The first point which strikes one on examination of the level shown on ^ map 76. is that the average natural surface level of the tract embraced by the preli minary scheme is a little over 2 metres above mean sea level (about 2 - i m. or 7 feet) while Sir W. Willcocks speaks of the tract as lying at an elevation of only 1*5 metres. It is evident then, if the map levels are correct, that a water level of 2 metres behind the barrage would not command the tract to be served by the canals. The adoption of any higher working level would necessitate the con struction of an embankment from the high desert to the Fao canal, near its head, and, if not over the whole length, along parts of the Shatt-el-Arab bank between the barrage and the old Euphrates right bank. Moreover, as Sir W. Willcocks proposed to allow high floods to escape into the Khor Abdulla between the Fao canal and the high desert on the south-west, an escape regulator would be neces sary in the first embankment spoken of in the preceding paragraph. These works are not mentioned in the report nor included in the estimates of cost. 4. Sir W. Willcocks makes no definite statement as to the manner in which his proposed canals would operate. On page 39 of his report, however, he speaks of covering the plain between the canal and the river with irrigants fed from both ends, and it would appear from this that he intended to join up the existing river creeks to the canal branches or distributaries, but only two such connec tions, one with the Ashar, and one with the Abu Filus creek, are shown on map No. 76. It is also evident from Sir W. Willcocks’ remarks on the provision of The command of the canals. r- ttidal sluices at the river ends of the creeks, that he did not intend to adopt them' as a feature of his scheme, and no allowance is made for such works in his esti mates. The supply level in the canals would consequently be subject to the fluc tuation of the river level with the tide and, except in the head reaches, com mand for flow irrigation could only be obtained during the higher stages of the tide in the high water season. Conditions would be improved at the extreme limits of the existing cultivation but nearer the river the benefits derived from the proposed canals would be very slight indeed. The only records of the river levels which are available are those provided by the gauge at the present Royal Engineer headquarters, which has been regularly observed from January of the present year to date. These records supply the following information :— Height of high tide above M. S. Li Month, Feet, Metres.

Willcpcks during each month. The present has been a year of exceptionally high river flood so that 4 ;he figures given in the above table from March to June, at any rate, are in excess of those which would Obtain in a normal year, in a year such as the present one, it can be seen from the above table that, with a supply level of 2-501. at the barrage, land lying at 2*r metres above mean sea level could be commanded at high water of spring tides from December to June, and at high water neap tides only in May and perhaps part of April and June. In ordinary years the period during which com mand could be gained would be less and then only for a short time at high tide. Winter crops require irrigation from November to May, ordinary summer crops ’and inferior rice from April to mid July and better class rice from April to September. Water would be required in September and October for gardens and cotton. It is evident, then, that early waterings for winter crops and late waterings for summer crops would have to be effected by lift irrigation, even in a year of very high river supplies. 5. Sir W. Willcocks estimates the cost of the preliminary scheme to irrigate 87,^00 acres at L. T. 526,820 or Rs Estimated cost and financial aspect. ' ^ U J i_i ’.i r 71,00,000 about, but doubles the figures to allow for interest charges and subsequent development. The anticipated net annual returns calculated at L. T. ri per hectare or about Rs. 6 per commanded acre of perennially irrigated land amount to 3.7 percent of the doubled estimated cost,- S2701GSB'6 The completed scheme, irrigating 225,000 acres, is estimated to cost L. T. 998,480 or Rs. 1,35,00,000. Doubling the cost again, the estimated net annual returns amount to 5 per cent of the capital outlay {vide page 52 of Sir W. \V1llc0cks report). With the exception of the Nahrwan project this is the least favourable of all the Mesopotamian schemes proposed by Sir W. Willcocks, the estimated returns from which vary from 8*8 per cent to ir 9 percent of the doubled figures of estimated cost. All the schemes and their financial results have been estimated on the same basis, but it has been seen in paragraph 3 supra that the cost of certain embankments and a flood escape regulator necessary to the scheme were not included in the estimates. The schemes higher up the delta would provide per ennial flow irrigation, while in the Basrah tract lift must be largely resorted to . and the canal revenue assessment on the Basrah tract could not in fairness be so high as on tracts provided with all the year round flow irrigation. Furthermore a fairly large proportion of the area included in the project is already cultivated in some measure, so that full water rates could not be assessed on the whole area . * The soil is largely impregnated with salts inju- All these facts tend to render the compari- rious to plant life and until these have bf en elimi- son of the Basrah project with the other nated from the top soil by solution and deposition ... 4-r» on the surface the quality and density of the crops schemes Still more Unfavourable tO the will be very poor. former. 6. The command of the canal system proposed by Sir W. Willcocks could Su;ge&amp;ted i m pro,e m „t of 'sir w. wuicock.' be improved by providing the river creeks scheme. with sluices. The object of the sluices would be to retain water in the main channels and irrigants at a high level, and to render possible a scouring velocity at low river levels when neces sary to remove silt deposits. It would not be necessary to provide all the creeks with these sluices, the smaller ones could be permanently closed by earth dams and connected to those pcssessing sluices. To avoid waterlogging, a drainage system would be necessary, the main drain falling into the north head of the Khor Abdulla. The necessity for boat locks to maintain existing navigation facilities in the creeks could be avoided by building the sluices near the upper end of the creeks, connecting the existing irrigants to the canal system and closing off the present intakes from the creeks. By this means navigation in the existing creeks would not be interfered with at all, but this plan is not recommended, as by its adoption it would not be possible to improve the existing irrigation faci lities until the barrage system was in operation. It does not appear to be advisable to embark on the scheme proposed by Sir W. Wiflcpcks, with or without the modification suggested above, until a real necessity for it is felt, in view of the better returns that the schemes for the irrigation of higher parts of the delta promise. It would be more sound to make a small beginning and work up to a complete and much improved irrigation systerp gradually. 7. The following procedure for the development of the desert tract is „ , , f . recommended if it is decided to under- Suggested programme ot operations. , . ' n tclKC it ({) Improve the irrigation of the existing cultivated area by building automatic tidal sluices of cheap construction near the river ends pf the creeks, which would open when the level of the tideway rose above retained creek level. (h) Extend some of the existing creeks into the desert to bring more land under cultivation. (in) Construct the Euphrates barrage and supply canal, linking up exist ing systems of supply channels and connect the automatic tidal sluices into controllable regulating sluices, when the advisability of incurring the extra expenditure arises. 8. The tidal sluices would be built about \ mile from the mouth of the.

By this means large f)oats. could enter the creeks, as fat as thesluices, to lie up for repairs. Small boats or bellums could pass through the sluices when they were open, as the velocity of flow would be small with a sluice of sufficient waterway. If the necessity were felt, however, boat locks could be constructed in the Ashar, Khandak and possibly one or two of the other principal creeks, and the channel dredged from the sluice site to the mouth to permit of boats entering the creeks at all stages of the tide. The sluices would be built with masonry abutments, piers and floor and provided with simple sw : ng gates hinged at top and bottom. The provision of these sluices would vastly improve the conditions under which cultivation is carried on at present. The irrigants would receive a better supply and, owing to the water surface being retained continuously at a level only a little below high tide in the river, the average height of lift on to the fields or gardens would be greatly reduced. In order to avoid a high lift the cultivators must, at present, do their watering at or near the period of high tide, but the installation of the sluices would render the whole day available for the task. The average water level in the creeks and irrigants, inside the sluices allowing for leakage and withdrawals for irrigation, may be assumed to be, at the outside, one foot below high tide level, although the difference during neap tides would be less than during springs. On this assump tion the figures of the table in paragraph 4 show that the maximum amount of lift necessary to irrigate land at 7 feet above mean sea level would be about 2J feet, from August to January. At spring tides the maximum lift would be about 2J feet, in September and October only. The existing creeks between the Khora creek and Gurmat Ali are, on the average, about fth of a mile apart, but the existence of the tide sluices would permit of the main irrigating channels being placed at less frequent intervals, and as stated in paragraph 6 it would be unnecessary to provide all the existing creeks with sluices, bor want of detailed surveys, it is not possible, at the present time, to propose the sites for sluices below the Khora creek. Between the Khora creek and Gurmat Ali, how ever, sluices might be constructed in the Khora, Khandak, Rubat, Jubela and Abusabar creeks. The Ashar creek might be left as it is at present, to begin with, its irrigants closed off from the creek and supplied from the Khora and Khandak creeks. The other intermediate creeks could be closed by earth bunds J mile from their mouths and their irrigants connected up with the Rubat, Jubela and other creeks provided with sluices, those irrigants taking out below the bunds being closed off from the creeks. These proposals are tentative merely, detailed survey being necessary to determine the best arrange ment. 9. As need arose the system just described could be extended to bring more land under cultivation, by excavating Extension of system into desert. canals running approximately parallel and at right angles to the river about ij miles apart connected with those creeks possessing tidal sluices. Unless the desert spill from the Euphrates ^swamps is closed off (as recommended in another report) the new area brought under cultivation would require a new protective embankment to prevent inundation from the desert spills in years of high river supply, but the cost of this would be only a small proportion of the cost of the new canal system. In years of high flood a drainage system would be required to prevent waterlogging, since the crops would be flooded with seepage water if the supply level in the canals remained, as, in the present year, above natural surface level for any length of time. The north head of the Khor Abdulla provides a very suitable outfall for the main drain, and was chosen by Sir W. Willcocks for this purpose. If the alignment for the main drain proposed by Sir W. Willcocks and shewn on map 76 were adopted, it would be necessary to provide syphons under the main irrigation channels. By locating the drain on the insidq of the protective embankment, however, the syphons would be avoided, and if the irrigation system w'ere extended still further into the desert the drain could serve as an irrigant and a new main drain made inside the new protective embankment. jo. The proposals suggested ip paragraphs 7 to 9 of this report are illustrate on the accompanying map, scale r 100,poo Ultimate development Of th? schema ^ already stated, the arrangement ofl 8 : channels is merely intended to indicate the general nature of the scheme and 'he alignments shewn are not, at this stage, proposed or actual adoptton. 1 he svstem Troposed here would readily lend itself to linking up with a mam supply cfnal such as that proposed by Sir W. Willcocks when the times became npe for the Inauguration of the more ambitious barrage scheme, and practically no super- f fluous expenditure would be incurred by developing the tract in the manner now suggested. Limiting the tract under consideration, for present purposes, to the present cultivated area lying within the Approximate estimate of cost. 35,000 hectares included in Sir W. Will- cocks’ preliminary scheme, it is considered that about 16 sluices at Rs. 25,000 each would suffice,, costing in all about Rs. 4,00,000. To this a further sum of Rs. 2 ooooo should be added for the cost of bunds and channel improvements, making a total of Rs. 6,00,000 for works only ; adding 33J per cent for estab lishment and contingent charges brings the total to Rs, 8,00,000. The culti vated area affected, as determined from Sir W. Willcocks’ maps, (the only ones available for the'purpose) is about 10,000 hectares or 25,000 acres, so that the incidence of cost per acre would amount to Rs. 32* The extra cost of extending irrigation to the remaining 25,000 hectares or 625,000 acres is estimated in the following manner. If the bed of the canals be placed at mean sea level, the minimum depth of water in them would be about 4 feet. With this depth the theoretical velocity of propagation of the tide wave along the canals would be nearly 8 miles per hour ; frictional resistances would reduce this velocity^ some what, but it is considered that the actual wave velocity would be sufficient to 1 ensure the maintenance of canal surface level at only a little below high water level in the tideway. The bed level suggested would entail a mean depth of digging of about 7 feet. A suitable bed width for canals spaced miles apart would be 40 feet. With these dimensions the canals would cost about Rs. 23,000 per mile, including cost of establishment and contingencies. Each mile of canal would serve an area of square miles or 960 acres.-1 he incidence of cost per acre would thus be about Rs. 24 and the total cost of the canals for the irrigation of 62,500 acres would amount to Rs. 15,00,000. An efficient drainage system would probably cost about Rs. 5,00,000 includirg the cost of a tidal sluice at the outfall of the main drain into the Khor Abdulla. The total cost of the entire system irrigating the full area of 87,500 acres would thus amount to Rs. 28,00,000. To allow for interest charges and unforeseen expenditure, however, this figure should be increased by about 50 per cent which would bring the estimated cost to Rs. 42,00,000, and the incidence of cost per acre to Rs 48. The cost of the watercourse system is not included in the estimate' since it would, as in India, be made by the cultivators or at their expense. 12. Sir W. Willcocks estimates the annual returns from his scheme at abdut „ . . £ Rs. 7-8 and maintenance charges plus working expenses at about Re. 1-8 per commanded acre. In consideration of the fact that the irrigation would be lift and not flow, however, with the system now under consideration, no more than half flow rates or R5.3*12 per acre could fairly be assessed. The mainte nance charges and working expenses would be less in this scheme, probably about Re. 1 per acre. The net annual returns are estimated in this manner to be Rs. 2-12 per acre, whi.h is 5! per cent of the estimated figure of cost. 13. The financial aspect of the barrage scheme will entirely depend on the Cost and financial ■•'speet of ultimate scheme. area brought within its SCOpe, since the greater the commanded area the less will be the incidence of cost per acre of the barrage and the embankments. Con-' sidering, for the present, the area of 87,500 acres to be developed first, the cost of linking up the tidal system to the Euphrates barrage is estimated as follows :—~ Rs. (а) Barrage ... ( б ) Making up old Euphrates bank . ; . \c) Retaining embankments' ... .**- {(/) Main canal , i; t 18.00. 000 10.00. 000 2,00,000 14.00. 000 Total 44,00,000Adding Estabiishment and Contingencies at 33 per cent brings the cost up to Rs. 58,70,o°o and increasing by 50 per cent to allow for interest and unfore* seen charges gives a total cost of Rs. 88,00,000. Items (a) and (3) are Sir W. Willcocks’ figures. Item (c) has been included to allow for the cost of embankments from the high desert to the head of the main canal and along the Shatt-el-Arab between Gurmat Ali and Gurna. Item (a?) is the cost of the main canal of the dimensions proposed by Sir W. Willcocks. I he cost of the Basrah Canal in Sir W. Willcocks’ scheme has not been included since it would not be necessary if the scheme were carried out in the manner suggested in this report. The total cost of the ultimate scheme to com mand 87,500 acres would thus amount to (Rs. 88,00,000 plus. Rs. 42,00,000) or Rs. 130,00,000, the incidence on one acre being about Rs. 148. Sir W. Willcocks’ estimate of the cost of his preliminary scheme to irrigate 87,500 acres was Rs. 71,00,000, but this figure did not include the cost of tidal sluices and retain ing embankments and allowed only about Rs. 1,00,000 for drains. To make a fair comparison with the present proposals it is necessary to increase his figure by Rs. 4,00,000 for tidal sluices, Rs. 2,00,000 for cost of bunds and improve ments to existing channels, Rs. 2,00,000 for the retaining embankments and Rs. 4,00,000 for excess cost of the drainage system over Sir W. Willcocks’ allowance, or Rs. 12,00,000 in all. Adding this sum to Rs. 71,00,000 and in creasing the total by 50 per cent to allow for interest charges, etc., brings the cost of Sir W. Willcocks’ scheme improved by the addition of tidal sluices on some of the existing creeks to Rs. 1,24,50,000, or only Rs. 5,50,000 short of the final estimated cost of the present proposals. Accepting for present pur poses Sir W. Willcocks , estimate of a net annual return of Rs. 6 per acre from the barrage scheme the direct profits accruing from the final scheme would amount to 4*05 per cent of the capital outlay. If, then, irrigation were fully extended to the whole area of 87,500 acres under consideration, and half flow rates assessed on it, it would not pay to undertake the construction of the barrage and main supply canal to convert lift into flow irrigation over this area alone. It is possible to determine the minimum area which must be brought within the scope of the barrage scheme to obtain a net annual return of 5f per cent in the following manner. A net annual return of Rs. 6 per acre limits the capital outlay to Rs. 104 per acre to pay 5! per cent. The items of cost which are independent of the area taken up are : — Barrage r 3 . ... 18,00,000 Making up old Euphrates bank • • • » • • ... 10,00,000 Retaining embankments • • * • • • ... 2,00,000 Establishment and Contingencies • •• 30,00,000 ... 10,00,000 Total ... 40)°o,ooo Interest and unforeseen charges ... ... 20,00,000 Grand total ••• 60,00,000 The cost of all other works may be roughly assumed as being directly pro portional to the commanded area. It has been seen in paragraph 11 that the cost of the irrigation and drainage channels and tidal sluices amounts to Rs. 48 per acre. The only remaining item is the main supply canal, of which the inci dence of cost per acre on an area of 87,500 acres, allowing for establishment, interest and contingent charges, amounts to I -^'-^ 5o 1 Q 4 ’ oo ’ 0O °=Rs, 32. To allow roughly for its necessary increase of capacity as well as of length, however, the incidence of cost of the main canal can be taken at Rs. 40 per acre.

Turning: now to the swamped area lying to the north of the desert tract * j a ^ J /-i Vi a ti’C! O T* f* 1 Q 1 Reciamationof marshes above GurmatAii. reclamation and cultivation will next be Sir W. Willcocks, on page 35 of his report, states that he at first entertained the idea of draining these swamps but, after a two years’ study of the question, abandoned it in favour of the Basrah barrage scheme. His argument was that the drainage of the swamps into the Khor Abdulla would convert 800,000 hec tares of land, worth something even to-day, into a desert, and the Shatt-el Arab, deprived of this reserve of fresh water, would fill with sea water for many months of the year to the detriment or even destruction of the enormous number of date palms along its banks. The swamps effect a large control on the floods in the Shatt-el-Arab by storage and evaporation, and the conservation of the greater part of them, for this purpose alone, will certainly be necessary for a long time to come, but it is quite practicable to bring a part of the tract under the bene fits of cultivation without harm to other interests. Sir W 1 . Willcocks anticipated that the people would themselves reclaim a part of the swamped area by building embankments and erecting pumping plants to control the water level in the reclaimed area, and estimated the cost at L. T. 8*5 per hectare or Rs. 46 per acre (vide page 40 of his report). Reclamation carried out in this way, by the people, would develop very slowly, however, and to obtain revenue for adminis trative purposes it would be necessary to take up a definite area and bring it under cultivation as a public work. For want of adequate maps and other data it is not possible at this stage to give any reliable figures of cost, but an attempt will be made to arrive at a rough provisional estimate. To begin with let it be assumed that an area of 100,000 acres would be taken up, situated approximately as shown on the accompanying tracing, scale 1:500,000. The area would frst be enclosed by the embankment A. B. C. which would be made partly by dredging and partly by hand digging. A drain D. E., falling into the west head of the Khor Abdulla, would be required to drain off excess irrigation supplies and seepage water when cultivation was established and to effect the initial reclamation . A tidal sluice would be necessary near the tail of the drain. The supply for irrigation would be drawn through regulators constructed in the enclosing embankment; the necessary supply channels would be smalTand could be made by the cultivators. The public works would be confined to the con struction of the embankment, regulators, and main drain. The question of the capacity of the drain and its design would need very careful investigation but for present purposes it will be assumed to require a bed width of 100 feet. Sir W. Willcocks states that the natural surface level of the swamps is 1 metre above mean sea level, the fall from this level to low tide level at the head of the Khor Abdulla would be about 2^ metres. The length of the drain would be about 32 kilometres and the maximum surface slope 1*13,000. At this surface slope a drain running 6^ feet deep with a bed width of 100 feet would discharge about 1,200 cusecs. With this design the discharge of the drain would practically be unaffected by the rise of the tide until the rise exceeded feet, after which the discharge would decrease to zero, when the tide had risen 2^ metres or 8*2 feet. The mean discharge of the drain would exceed one half the maximum discharge but allowing for the period when the sluices would be closed and the drain not acting at all, the average discharge will be taken at 6oo cusecs or about 1,200 discussed.feet acres per diem. The drain would thus be capable of lowering the water level over 100,000 acres by i-yth of an inch in one day. The average daily depth of'watering required for the irrigation of summer crops may be put at about inch. The drain would therefore be capable of dealing effectively with surplus supplies and seepage, and assisted, as it would be to a very large extent, by evaporation would dry the whole area enclosed by the embankment in a few months. The average depth of digging required to excavate the drain would be about 13 feet, and the cost of the channel would probably amount to Rs. 16,00,000. The excavation of the drain would entail some difficulty ; the best method would be to excavate from the tail upwards by a suction dredger. The enclosing bund would be about 9 feet high, top width 10 feet with side slopes of 2 to 1 on the water side and 3 to 1 on the downstream side. Allowing Rs. 20 per cubic foot the embankment would cost Rs. 26,400 per mile. The total length necessary would amount to 30 miles and the total cost of the embankment would be about Rs. 8,00,000. A further sum of Rs. 3,00,000 might be allowed for the supply regulators, the tidal sluice in the drain and the Basrah Zobair railway bridge bringing the cost of works to Rs. 27,00,000, and the total cost including estab lishment and contingent charges to Rs. 36,00,000. Increasing this figure by 50 per cent to allow for interest and unforeseen expenditure, the estimate for reclaiming 100,000 acres amounts to Rs. 54,00,000 which is at the rate of Rs. 54 per acre. A net annual revenue of Rs. 6 per acre would give a return of in per cent on the capital outlay. The reclamation of 100,000 acres out of a total swamp area of about 000,000 acres (as given by Sir W. Willcocks) would exert no appreciable in fluence on the flood assorptive capacity of the tract, nor on the supply of fresh water to the Shatt-el-Arab. As an increasing area of land was brought under reclamation, the intensity of floods in the Shatt-el-Arab would increase but the change of conditions would be gradual and the river would increase its discharging capacity by scour, chiefly of the bed. This project, which would provide perennial flow irrigation to the area within its scope, appears far more promising than any scheme for the irrigation of the Basrah desert tract, and would not interfere in any way with the subsequent development of that tract whenever it is considered advisable or necessary to undertake it. 15. If the whole of the Tigris-Euphrates delta lay under the control of a single administration, the soundest princi- Concluding remarks. ^ ^ eve } 0 p men £ t0 follow WOllld be tO commence reclamation and irrigation in the higher tracts and extend towards the lower tracts. If carried out in the reverse order the withdrawal of low river supplies for the irrigation and the construction of flood control works for the reclamation of the higher tracts would affect the lower tracts and entail modifications of the schemes undertaken in them. The political situation may, however, compel a departure from the above principle and the necessity for proceeding with reclamation and irrigation schemes in the tract dealt with in this report may arise at an early date. The estimates of the cost and financial results of the schemes outlined in this report are necessarily very rough ; detailed surveys and closer study of the factors involved are necessary before definite and detailed schemes for the development of the tracts under discussion can be prepared. It would be a great help in the conduct of future surveying operations if copies of Sir W. Willcocks original plans and levels could be obtained, which must of necessity contain far more information than is supplied by his published reduced scale maps. P. A.

Mesopotamian irrigation andTnavigation run* survey. Reference to your telegrams of June/'23rd.and No. 3063 dated September 21st. to Army Department. Cox has dis cussed the question with Whitley, who is construction engineer rather thaii irrigation expert, and submits following joint opinion ” With Kut-al-Amarah in our possession improvement of the navigation and benefiting of irrigation would in my opinion be secured by controlling and remodelling on scientific principle of various big canals now exist ing in the neighbourhood of Amaraii. The quick return j to be anticipated from these measures would I believe ensure their ultimate financial success well before any possible change of conditions could result from estab lishment of more far reaching irrigation systems up-streams of Kut. Failing such measures the usual intensely unsatisfactory state of Tigris navigation during low water will continue if indeed it does not still further,^ deteriorate as is probable. As regards vicinity of Basra, Army Conmiander^engineering staff have submitted to him two or three unpretentious projects for consider ation and as it appears that one of them could be carried out without prejudice to Willcocks’ more comprehensive scheme reports are bding submitted for information o.l G overnment of India end it is hoped an eminent irrigation officer of the Government of India with adequate staff will be deputed forthwith to examine them authoritatively. Cox urges that in addition to expert irrigation officer Willcocksshould also himself be invited to visit Irak this autumn to advise generally on schemes under consiaeration, and we think it would be desirable also to associate Sir G.Buchan an with undertaking to advise on dredging operations. Vj propose therefore,with your approval, at once to depute Mr. Gwyther, who has just retired from Punjab Irrigation Depart-■i; (( 2 )). t ment and is specially qualified to undertake executive control o l °P e rat&amp;pns, on a consolidated remuneration of Rs.3750 per mensem,without pension, plus travelling allowance, with a staff at a cost of approximately Rs.2000 a month, and to ask Sir G. Buchanan at the same time to proceed and advise on dredging portion of scheme. Je should be glad also if it could be arranged for iHllcocks to visit Irak as proposed,or,if this is impossible,to secure his advice on schemes when finally elabor ated. Question of Sir G. Buchanan’s salary, if his deputation approved, can be settled later.

I should like to assemble a Committee, representative of every interest in Basrah and Ashar, in order to go into and record all matters which require attention and remedy here, and to draw up schedules in order of urgency of all major and minor works of every kind which can he carried out or begun within the next ten years. My object is that a thorough examination of the whole conditions of the place should he made and a policy of improvement laid down by adherence to which some continuity in works may he assured. The main points seem to me to be sanitation, lighting, water conservancy and irrigation, defences against water, port improvements and communications. All these cost money, and if the hearings of each are separately considered and compared, the claims to money for them can he roughly settled on a proper basis in a roster of priority and there is likely to be less waste of public money when working to a well thought out schedule than in its absence. It does not concern the military so much as it will, in the future, the civil side, and I shall be much obliged if you will kindly send me a list ^ of names of persons whose services would be useful on such a Committee, which would include such officers of the Porce now here whose technical experience on the various matters would be of value.

Development of Basrah, Preliminary meeting held at the Governor’s house at 10-15 a.m. on Monday, 26th duly, to obtain views of representatives of the several com munities and departments interested, in confirmity with the desire of the Army Commander as expressed in his memorandum No. 669—IQ., dated 18th June 1915 (copy attached). A list of those invited to attend and present is attached, indicating the special interests each represents. The purpose of the meeting having been explained by Sir Percy Cox to those present the discussion was proceeded with under the following categories: — Land communications. Water communications. Water-supply and conservancy, and sanitation, r- -* , 1. 2 . &amp; ■ r b ‘ViL. f-cttci 3 6 jj Fated ow i! k ua IyiP 4. Improvement of Port. 5. Lighting of Town. 6. Miscellaneous suggestions for the benefit of the communities. A list is attached comprising the various projects suggested and discussed. At the termination of the discussion, the opinion of the meeting was canvassed as to which of the projects should be selected as the most pressing, for submis sion to the Army Commander. These were— (1) Strengthening of embankment and culverts of the Ashar Creek with a view to construction of a metalled road from Ashar to Basrah. It is understood that the Military Deputy Director of Works has authority to proceed with the work within the limit of the funds sanctioned for the purpose, at the earliest possible moment. (2) Dredging the mouth of the Ashar Creek up to the end of the Customs HouiTe premises to enable lighters to get alongside at all tides. (3) Provision of a drinking-water supply on improved modern lines. It would be the function of the sub-committee appointed to report on the best method of financing such a scheme and having it carried out; it being the opinion of the meeting that the capital required should be obtained as far as possible from the Municipality and inhabitants of Basrah. It was suggested that the -water-supply might eventually be extended to Zubair. (4) The construction of a Jail, the present building used for the purpose being in every way unsuitable and quite inadequate for the needs of Basrah. (5) Building and equipment of a Civil Hospital, with accommodation for in-patients. (6) Sanitation. It is recognized that the state of sanitation in Municipal limits leaves much to be desired, but it is considered that there is no middle course between continuance on existing lines, with such improved supervision as our present administration can provide, and the introduction of a modern sanitary and sewage system based on the examination and advice of a selected Sanitary Engineer. This being the general view of those present, no member of the meeting had any useful suggestion to put forward. Note .—Subject to the Army Commander’s concurrence, Major B. E. A. Hamilton, Deputy Military Governor, Basrah, will act as Secretary of the General Committee, when formed, and is functioning in anticipation of its formation. P. Z. Cox. Enclosure No. 3. Note on suggestions for the development of Basrah made at a meeting of representatives of all interests, which was held at the Governor’s House, Ashar, on Monday, 26 th July,, at 10-15 a, m. 1. Land Communications. It was agreed on all hands that the construction of a permanent road „ , ^ , from Ashar to Basrah is a work of prime Asnar-Basrah Koad. . . rn j ii importance. Tramways would no doubt follow. Major Greenstreet, B. E., Deputy Director of Works, explained that it was necessary, before attempting to put down metal, that the embankment of the Creek and the culverts, some of which were already giving way, should he strengthened and, where needed, rebuilt. This would make a proper frame work for the road. He had a grant at his disposal and intended to commence the work as soon as it was possible for him to provide the necessary establish ment. This would probably be in August. It was urged by several members that a road should be taken through the Sarai premises. It might even be possible to demolish that part of it, which stands on the edge of the Creek* so as to allow of the strand being continued up to the Baghdad Gate Post.3 It was suggested that in so far as it eonid be done without unreasonable demolition, sidings should be arranged at conyenient intervals to enable carriages meeting from different directions in the narrow streets of Basrah to pass one another. The provision of a good road from Ashar Bridge to Makina Maksus was many places undermined with sewers and cesspits, and short of filling them in, and providing other drainage, which might be a formidable task, it was realised* that little effective could be done, but the matter deserved further investigation. Khandak Creek.—It was considered that a bridge should be constructed Provision or improvement of bridges and cui- over this Creek connecting the Fish ing bridges raised to allow date bellams to pass. Certain bridges and culverts have for a long time been in need of repair, especially the bridge at Manawi and certain culverts along the Fao Boad. Among the most urgent projects to the community is the deepening of the Similarly the Khandak Creek should be cleared and deepened at any rate from its mouth as far as the bridge on the Makina Maksus Boad. Both Creeks require scouring and it would be very convenient to give lateral communication for boats between the two. It is thought that this could be most easily effected by widening and deepening one of the irrigation channels which already connect them, viz., that entering the Ashar Creek just above the Sarai or another near the Turkish Bath. It was further suggested by one or two of those present that if the to the travelling public. The meeting, however, on the whole doubted whether this project interested the general public or came within the scope of the objects to be considered. It was recognised that it was primarily the duty of the riparian land-owners to keep this waterway open, and it was to their interest to do so. The problem was discussed. It was considered that short of large scientific control measures, ordinary local control lay with the land-owners whose recognised duty it was to keep their dams in repair. Proper supervision was however very necessary. The circumstances of the present year were exceptional. Dr. Borrie was of opinion, and other members agreed, that for the present and, until a completely new system had been considered, it was advisable and necessary to carry on the existing arrangements with such improvements as the present administration could provide. The subject was essentially one for treatment by experts {vide proposals submitted for Army Commander’s consideration). There was some discussion on the question of piers and jetties which indicated that, from the point of view of the public, these erections greatly impede the navigation of the Shatt by native craft. Their existence drives boats and muhailas out into deep water where they cannot pole and become un manageable. advocated.

On the above grounds the commercial view is that as a question of permanent arrangements, it is important that the number of piers and jetties should be reduced to the minimum, and the absence of them remedied by providing by dredging sufficient depth of water close to the banks and wharyes. 6. Miscellaneous. (а) In order to do away with confusion resulting from the use both of English and Arabic time, it is recommended that one or more large Town Clocks should he provided with separate faces showing English and Arabic hours. (б) A nursery garden should he prepared with a view to raising suitable trees and shrubs for shade and ornament along the roads and on the river front. (c) A scheme for lighting the town by electricity or other lighting system was considered very desirable, and the meeting were strongly of opinion that it should be taken up, under advice, as a municipal project. (d) The Military Governor and medical members of the meeting strongly urged the provision of a suitable jail, adequate for the needs of Basrah and the future accommodation of convicts from outlying districts now coming under British occupation. The present, building is undoubtedly entirely unsuitable and inadequate and all long-term prisoners are being deported to India in consequence. (e) A good hospital would be greatly appreciated by the people and would be further proof to them of our benevolent intentions. It is considered that the provision of a large and properly equipped hospital is a great and urgent desideratum, and would be greatly appreciated by the populace. It -appeared to be the opinion of the meeting that in the first instance it must be built and equipped at Government expense.

From—The Chief of the General Staff, T 0 —The General Officer Commanding, Force “ D, ” Basrah. I have been informed that, in the opinion of Sir William W ill cocks, the con struction of weirs across the offtakes of the following branches of the main stream, viz. Michriyah, Jahalah, and Majar Kabir, would improve the navigation of the Tigris below Amarah. If there is no objection politically, this idea of weirs is perhaps worthy of consideration, particularly as he also thought their non construction would seriously menace the navigation of the Lower Tigris.

Entirely concur with you that navi- eation of Tigris might be improved by weirs, but it is a very large question affecting interests of all the tribes and also the effect on the river itself and adjoining country must be considered. I have already written on the subject and am shortly repre senting it to Government and requesting that the biggest expert irrigation man t hev have and a large staff should be sent out to study the question now when the rive^ is fairly high. 8 Taking one instance, the river where Jahaiah and Musharrah canal take off at Amarah is very strong and is about one hundred and fifty yards ' any weir not in the right place might wash Amarah itself away and do incalculable damage. The water almost tops the bank and if water is stopped over flowing in one place it will probably force its way through somewhere e se and no improvent wilAe made to the bad part between Ezra s tomb and Qalat Sa.eh. These weirs will take time and what is wanted at once are dredgers to improve the bad part and keep it open when the river falls as it has begun to do as nothing must be allowed to endanger free course of supplies to Amaiah.

Will you, in communication with Dobbs, enquire, for information of Army Commander, into conditions of land tenure and of water rights in tracts irrigated by Tigris water from Kut-el-Amarah to Qurna. Supposing preliminary active mea sures were taken with view towards ultimate control of irrigation including re clamation of country now water-logged and incidental improvement of Tigris as a navigable waterway it is absolutely necessary to bring home to the natives of the various tracts affected that these measures would be for their benefit. In connec tion with question of land tenure and water rights, page 1891, Volume II, Gazetteer, Persian Gulf, says that Majar Canal is property of an individual Shaikh. Is this accurate statement of tenure ? Is the irrigation from Chehala and Majar Chabir and Michnyah canals flow or lift and is it of important extent ? Please wire brief resume of general result of your enquiries. You know Army Commander’s view that control of the Arab tribes will be maintained very largely by proper treat ment of the irrigation question and it is most important to make them see that their interests coincide with ours.

Leachman away •Enclosure above for some . da y s and a11 '“formation at present available regarding land tenure and water rights is, I believe, with me. Almost entire stretch of country between Kut- al-Amarah and Qurna on both banks Tigris together with water right property of State or of Crown now merged in State. On these State lands there are no cul tivators or tenants permanently attached to soil. Government leases out for cash rents large tracts usually for five years to tribal Shaikhs or private speculators, it being roughly understood that certain tracts should ordinarily be leased to certain tribes but, except for the Bani Lam country on left bank above Amarah which is never leased outside Bani Lami Shaikh, Turkish Government does not seem to have invariably considered tribal boundaries in distributing leases. Each new farmer brings in new set of sub-farmers and cultivators. Each farmer usually makes sub-contracts in cash with several sub-farmers for whole period of lease while agree ments between sub-farmers and cultivators usually for one year only. Majority of leases terminate March 1916 or March 1917 after which land and water will technically be at disposal of Government. It would be difficult to terminate leases earlier as large and complicated system of sub-farming would be upset. Following is detailed statement of rights from Kut-al-Amarah to about six miles above Amarah. Whole country both banks Government property, thence to Amarah strip along right bank private property or Government property leased permanently to occupancy tenants who cannot be dispossessed without compensation, left bank mostly Government property. Musharra and Chahala canals all Government property except few patches private property on banks near Amarah. For about four miles below Amarah strips of private property along both banks with whole hinterland Government property. Thence to Azair all Government property both banks except few strips round Qalat Saleh. Between Azair an I Qurna shores where cultivated are private property all rest with swamps Government property. Gazetteer statements about Majar wrong. Whole canal Government property. Proportionate area of spring to autumn crops on canals specified as follows : Chahala about one-sixth, Majar Kabir about one-sixth, Michariya about one quarter, spring irrigation entirely flow aided byYain. I recently sent preliminaryI demi-official report on Government lands to Chief Political Officer and have detailed report almost ready. Hope to reach Basrah with it in about ten days. Telegram No. Ig.- 812 , dated the 3 rd July 1915 . T'rom—The Army Commander, To— Mr. Dobbs, Revenue Commissioner, Amarah. Army Commander is much obliged for your interesting telegram* 26-C. of ♦Enclosure above. yesterday and for information you gave. He has no desire to disturb any occupiers or interfere with farmers’ rights m any way. He has asked Government of India to send out irrigation engineers and staff to consider works required to conserve water now running to waste out of Tigris into marshes and to control irrigation for agricultural purposes. Uncon trolled outflow in the various canals not only means waste of water which could be utilised on opening up more land for cultivation but also perpetuates marshes and allows river to get dangerously low in certain months which is a military danger if supplies for troops are interrupted and it also stops flow of commerce up and down river. He wants it made clear to the tribes in due course that control of water, even if volume in the various canals is reduced and level lowered is necessary in their interests and he wishes to get them to see that it will benefit them and that their rights such as they have will not be injured. For instance, if the engineers decide to start with the Chabala the first step will be collection of reeds am? brush wood for some months before any digging starts and it is necessary that tribes should be assured beforehand so that unnecessary suspicions as to our motives be not engendered. Army Commander will be glad if you will consider what can be done to attain this end and if you will kindly tell him your views on your return here. m w m G, If. Emm, Sital*.— No. 6288 (w) F.

At the desire of the Army Commander, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copies of a Memorandum by Sir John Nixon to Mr. Dobbs, ashing for a forecast of the potential revenue value of the Province of Basrah to the British Empire, and a copy of Mr. Dobbs’ reply. Enclosure No. 1 . General Headquarters, I. E. E. “ D ”, Basrah, the 6th August 1915 . Copy of a Memorandum from the General Officer Commanding, I. E. F. “ D ”, to the Revenue Commissioner, Basrah, dated the 31 st July 1915 . I shall he very much obliged if you will be so kind as to give me, as concisely as possible, some information regarding the potential revenue this province may be expected to gather. To my mind the subject is complicated and must be resolved into several factors, for instance, the revenue of the Basrah Vilayet would be affected by the ownership of the Baghdad Vilayet, i.e., whether the latter belongs to us or not, and again the ultimate execution of irrigation works—a matter of years— would vastly increase the revenue that we can expect to receive prior to the execution of such works, other factors too exist. Put very shortly my question is, what do you forecast as the money value to the Empire of the Basrah Vilayet by itself, and secondly, if the Baghdad Vilayet is added to it, both in the immediate and in the remoter future. Enclosure No. 3 . General Headquarters, I. E. E. “D”, Basrah, the 6th August 1915 . Copy of a Memorandum from the Revenue Commissioner, Basrah, addressed to General Staff Officer ( 1 ), I. E. F. “ D”, No. 624 , dated the 4 th August 1915 . 1. Please refer to the Army Commander’s note of 31 st July 1915 asking for some information regarding the potential revenue that may be expected from this province. 2 . I now put up statement containing a summary of estimated receipts and expenditure in the immediate and remoter future, and detailed statements showing how these have been arrived at. It has been possible to prepare the estimates for revenue in the immediate future (by which I understand the first two or three years after annexation) with some approach to accuracy, as We have most of the figures. But for expenditure in the immediate future and both revenue and expenditure in the remoter future, I have had to make somewhat vague estimates. 3 . It will be seen that I estimate receipts in the immediate future at * This is the amount of contribution to the cost of £lo2,000 and expenditure at £ 306 , 000 , the Army of occupation in Egypt by the Egyptian leaving the Small SUm of £ 146 , 000 * to Government. p a ^ c0gt an y ^ ro0 p s re q u i rec p does not allow for any contribution from the province to the Indian or Home Bevenues. The province is, however, so undeveloped that we may, I think, congratulate ourselves if it needs only a small subsidy of some £200,0002 per annum to carry it oyer the first few years after annexation and pay for all the troops employed to guard it. 4. As to the remoter future I have assumed that two of Sir W. Willcocks* projects will be carried out, viz., the Hai Irrigation Projected the Project for irrigating the land between Basrah and Zubair and fitting it for date cultiva tion. I have added the receipts estimated by Sir W. Willcocks in the case of the Hai Project to Crown Land Receipts (as all the lands there belong to the Crown) and in the case of the Basrah Project to Land Revenue Receipts. I have similarly charged the annual estimated maintenance cost of these two projects against Crown Lands and Land Revenue, thus making no separate Irrigation Department receipts and expenditure. I may mention here that Sir W. Willcocks has greatly underestimated the Hai Project Receipts, and probably also the Basrah receipts, because he has assumed that Government will take only one-fifth of the gross produce, as it does from private lands. Whereas the lands being Crown waste lands, it will be entitled by Turkish custom to take one half. As to the capital cost of these two projects I have made no provision, because it can be more than provided by sale to settlers of occupancy culti vating rights in the land as has been done in the Chenab Colonies. 5. My estimates for the remoter future on these lines are, it will be seen— £ Receipts ... ... ... ••• Ij 388,000 Expenditure ... ... 602,000 This will give an ample margin for payment of the cost of the Army of Occupation and for a large contribution to the Empire. 6. I have felt some difficulty in estimating Customs receipts. All reports agree that only one-third of the normal customs takings under the Turks were on account of goods consumed in the Basrah Vilayet. Presumably we should not charge transit dues. Therefore, as long as we are sundered from Baghdad, we can expect only one-third. A great part of the goods that go on to Baghdad are destined for Persia; and if Baghdad is separated from Basrah, goods for Persia vid Baghdad will have to run the gauntlet of three Customs Houses, the British, the Turkish, and the Persian. I suspect that, in the end, in these circumstances, all goods that used to go to Persia vid Baghdad will find their way to Persia either vid Mohammerah and Khoremabad, or via Ahwaz and Ispahan, or possibly via Ali-al-Gharbi and Pusht-i-Kuh. In any case, so long as Basrah is separated from Baghdad, we cannot expect much, expansion of Customs dues, nor much expansion of trade in Basrah. The Basrah trade has always been largely an entrepot trade for Baghdad and it can cever flourish if cut off from Baghdad by a Customs tariff. 7 . As to the Army Commander’s request for some estimate of the Basrah revenues, if Basrah is joined to the Baghdad Vilayet, I have found my knowledge too vague for me to attempt it. I do not think the cutting off of the Baghdad Vilayet would affect the irrigation; for, so far as I understand Sir W. Willcocks’ report, he proposed the two irrigation projects inside the Basrah Vilayet after allowing for the absorption of all the water that could possibly be required by Baghdad Vilayet Projects. So I imagine that our receipts in Basrah would, if we were joined on to the Baghdad Vilayet, only increase under the heads of Customs, Traders’ or Income Tax, Stamps and Registration. I should roughly put down the probable increases in the Basrah Vilayet under these heads in the immediate future, if we were joined to the Baghdad Vilayet, as under— £ sterling. Customs ... Traders’ Tax Stamps Registration „. 120,000 ... 4,000 5,000 5,000 Total 134,000f This would probably save us from having to ask for any contribution from the Empire during the first few years after annexation. 8. As to the revenues of the Baghdad Vilayet itself, I have no later information than that given at page 857 , of the Persian Gulf Gazetteer, Volume II ; and I fear that is much out of date. 9 . One point remains, namely, the disposal of the Public Debt. The Ottoman Public Debt, most of which is held by Drench subjects, is secured upon the revenues from stamps, excise, fish, and a share in the Customs revenues. After the war it seems probable that each portion of the Turkish Empire will by arrangement have to pay a proportionate contribution to the Public Debt; and we may find that the Basrah share will amount to some £ 30,000 which will make rather a hole in the revenues.Prom - The Director, Royal Indian Karine, Bombay, To - The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine ^2^ r Department No. 4399 0 Dated the 8th July 1915. c - ^ . :* ) v - • — 7/ith reference to paragraph 1 of Lahine Department letter No. H.-5031, dated 21st May 1915, I have the honour to forward for your information copy of a report received from Commander C. S. Hickman, B.I.LI., in connection with the Mesopotamia rivers survey and to request you will he pleased to issue definite orders whether survey work is to he carried out before October next, in view of the fact that the Military Survey party have been withdrawn, and the i-Iarine Survey Officers, as also the vessel detailed for Marine Survey work, and which was being used as a floating base, have been requisitioned for other work. If, however, it is decided to proceed with Survey work in October I should recommend that the Survey Officers be returned to India during the hot weather, as otherwise it is more than likely that they will be on the sick list, when reouired for their special work. I would observe that the B.I.M.S. 'Palinurus' is in use on Examination Service and cannot be spared, she would be of little use, except in the low reaches of the river while the tug originally detailed for use as Surveying base can be used in any of the surveys mentioned.

Hickman, B.I.M., Surveyor in Charge, Marine Survey of India ToTo The Director of the Royal Indian Marine* Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge your No. 3675 dated the 27th of May 1915, and forward my report on paragraph 1 as instructed. The portion of the river Shatt-al-Aral, from Basra to Kurna is considered of first importance, I would suggest that this he surveyed on a scale not less than one inch to one sea mile, and the time required would he two months with a staff of three Officers. The river hanks at present are not well defined owing to the flooded state of the country, small light draft steamer would he required always as a base to work from, camping not being possible. The channel of the New Euphrates from Qurmat Ali has been started and progress made as far as the end of the creeks or to Harril Village, orders were then received to stop and carry out a survey of the channel across the Hammar Lake. The New Euphrates channel from Gurmat Ali westwards shoals considerably after passing Harril Village, and as a waterway is of little use except when the river is in flood; during the dry season there is in some places only a depth of two feet across the lake. The best channel is from Kurna, through the creek toward the Hammer Lake as across the latter a depth of four feet should always be had unless the river is abnormally low. Reports show that the Shatt-al~Arab bar has altered rather considerably since the last survey about three years ago, and I would recommend it being resurveyed as soon as possible. I would point out that at present under the existing circumstances no large piece of work has been taken in hand by the survey party attached to this force, only portions have been examined as required; for the first month no steamer was available the Survey Party at one time camping at Gurmat Ali; again since the 24th of Lay the steamer then used by the Survey Party was again requisitioned for the military operations at Kurna, and is still in use, also the two Officers, Lieutenant Campbell and Sub-Lieutenant Sanderson attachedattached for surveying work have heen lent to the Senior naval Officer for other work. I consider the port of Basra on a large scale of twelve inches to one mile is required this is most necessary for information for the Port Authorities Before such work as dredging, shore revetments, laying down mooring Buoys, and fixing sites for piers and pontoons is carried out. The lower portion of the river from Basra to the sea might he left till a later date hut two portions should he examined earlier.that is the Mohomerah har and the portion above Mohomerah where the two vessels are lying' sunk near the channel. After the survey from Basra to Kurna is completed I co-nsider a sketch survey of the Tigris to Amara and Baghdad should he carried out hut that does not appear of such immediate importance as its only suitable for shallow draft steamers and except for some very sharp turns presents no difficulty to navigation. I consider the 'Palinurus' would he a very suitable vessel for carrying out the main portions of this river, hut owing' to her draft it would he necessary to charter a vessel of less draft to work out the narrow creeks and such places as the New Euphrates channel and the Hammer make. Surveying should not he carried on after the middle of April or the first of May and not before the first of ue«,ouei during normal conditions as the heat during the summer months is excessive.

I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with your letter Bo. 4399, dated the 8th July 1915, forwarding a copy of Commander Hickman’s report in regard to the Kesopotamian rivers' survey and requesting definite orders whether survey work is to he carried out before October next. 2. In reply I am to inform you that as the survey party is under the orders and at the disposal of the General Officer Commanding, Force ’D’, the Government of India consider that the question can best be arranged on the spot by Commander Hickman in consultation with the military authorities. The whole matter being dependent on the military exigencies of the moment it will probably be difficult to execute any previously arranged programme in its entirety. Commander Hickman should be instructed to (1) Submit, in consultation with the General Officer Commanding, a programme of the various river surveys mentioned in his report, placing them in order of urgency; (2) obtain the opinion of the General Officer Commanding as to the relative importance of the survey of the Shat-el-Arab Bar, as compared with the river surveys; and (3) settle with the General Officer Commanding whether survey operations are to be proceeded with now, as far as may be possible, or, if not, when they are to be resumed.Flease refer to the Viceroy’s telepram of the 1st April last and to the subsequent correspondence, ending with the Secretary of State’s telegram of 24th ! ay, regarding proposed surveys in the Persian Gulf. It does not appear that the Government of India’s proposals, as set out in the telegram of the 1st April, have ever been formally sanctioned by the Secretary of State in Council, and we are not quite clear whether these proposals are still to stand part of the prograrane contemplated by the Government of India. If they do we shall have to ask the Treasury to bear half the cost. Will you please let us know what the Government of India’s wishes are? Yours faithfully, , ^ J. E. SHUCKBURGH.

In continuation of my telegram No. 1225, dated 13th J une. From what has been seen of river and canals and land up to and 40 miles beyond Amara, it is evident that country is very rich and has immense potenti alities, and that keystone of its future prosperity lies in conservancy of its waters and that interests of our Government and of people demand establishment of irrigation system administered by most expert irrigation engineers that India can furnish. Irrigation will be great lever whereby to work out pacification of people and bring in good revenue, and its adminis tration will mean content or reverse of tribes. Destruction of ancient system has led to enormous waste by leading off of water by large canals which run into marshes and in most uneconomical manner flood land for a season or else leave it permanent and stagnant marsh. Only expert exami nation of present condition of high water can show directions in which improvement is required and can be made not only for irrigation purposes but for safe navigati on of T igris. I consequently urge immediate deputation here of a^higEIy qualified engineer with a considerable staff to view country and report what should be done to lay foundation of Irrigation and River Conservancy Department in Mesopotamia.H .All Comrnufiicatwns addressed to the Company.

M. S. “ Palinurus ” in the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to inform you that the vessel as at present staffed cannot carry out this work, but these observations can be carried out when she proceeds to the Persian Gulf next September 1914 to continue her survey work, provided her complement is further strengthened by 8 tide watchers and 12 extra hands for 6 weeks or more, at a monthly cost of about Rs. 668. 2. If the Government of India are pleased to accord their sanction to the work being undertaken by the R. I. M. S. “ Palinurus ” it will be included in the survey programme of the vessel during 1914-15. Dear Commander Hickman, HYDROGRAPHIC DEPARTMENT, Admiralty, Whitehall, London, S.W. 3/st January IQ14. In 1907 the question was raised as to the desirability of an investigation of the tides of the Persian Gulf generally and it was then proposed to erect for this purpose automatic gauges at Bahrein and Kuweit. On account, however, of the very great cost involved, this project was dropped, I would suggest, however, for your consideration whether, in the course of the surveys in which you are now engaged in the Gulf, some valuable preliminary investigations of the tides generally in the Gulf might not be made, from the results of which it is possible that tidal constants on Bushire could be calculated. This would involve simultaneous observations at half hourly intervals, with extra observations at high and low water, for one complete lunation at Bushire, Bahrein, Kuweit and entrance to Shatt-al-Arab, the observations being connected with a known datum at each place.

The details of interesteef 1 ^ arrangemeilts are left for subsequent settlement between the parties His Majesty’s Government regret that they are unable to accept these proposals, it a new company is formed for the construction and working of the railway south ot -Bagdad, and if it is to be constituted upon an international basis, His Majesty’s Government can only accede to such an arrangement provided that British interests are represented m a degree at least equal to that of any other Power including turkey, and, in order to effect this and with a view to emphasising the international anc commercial character of the undertaking, they would suggest that Russia should 1 a ™ ltted t0 participation and that the percentage allotted to each country should be 20 per cent. Assummg that this distribution is adopted, His Majesty’s Government consider tnat a Convention should be concluded by the Powers concerned providing for the exclusion of differential rates on any railways in Asiatic Turkey, and for equality o treatment m regard to transport facilities and cognate matters; for the alignment or tne railway south of Bagdad and the conditions under which it is to be constructed ; ror tne introduction of approved financial arrangements tending to foster the develop- men o tiafhc ; and for guaranteeing that the interest in the enterprise of the several :P *’• p°? ce ™ ed sllad be of lasting duration and not subject to termination on the xpny ol the Bagdad Railway concession. [2123 f—1]K r r,-~ Tt would furthermore be necessary for the Ottoman Government to undertake formal improver dues on British shipping or cargoes wUhout the assent 0f H S remains^qutstion of the terminal port: having regard to the fact that important commercial interests are already established at Bussorah, His Majesty s (^wnment cannot but feel that substantial advantages would accrue from the establishment of the terminus at that point; and they consider that the port should be constructed and controlled by the proposed new company m the interests of the unrestricted (Ximmerce of all nations. But if such an arrangement is adopted, they miist stipulate that, in the event of the railway ever being prolonged to the Persian rulf it must be brought to Koweit under conditions to be settled by agreement between Great Britain and Turkey alone, and a clause to this effect must be embodied in a convention dealing with these matters. (a.) The respective Interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the Region of the Persian Gulf. His Maiesty’s Government are willing to meet the wish expressed in the concluding paragraphs of the Turkish memorandum that a precise definition may be reached as to the respective position of the two countries, commercially and politically, m the Persian Gulf; and they see no reason why a lasting settlement of the questions involved should not be reached. His Majesty’s Government are m no- sense opposed to the legitimate claims of the Turkish Government. 1 he most southeily point to Avhich they have ever recognised such claims on the littoral of the Persian Oieir n the district of El Katif. South of this point there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; in 1870 the Ottoman Minister or Foreign Affairs conveyed to Her Majesty’s Ambassador formal assurances that the Sublime Porte did not entertain any intention of obtaining supremacy oyer Ba^ein; Muscat or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf ; and it is °^y 8™“ ‘ha date that certain attempts have been made by the Ottoman Government to estab mudirates and other emblems of Turkish authority at points to the south . y®'’, The position of His Majesty’s Government m regard to these tubes has bee entirely different. With Bahrein they have had direct relations since ] 80o, t relations have found concrete expression in a series of treaties dating from 1 having as their objects the suppression of piracy and the slave trade , the of the succession to the throne ; the protection of the island against oieign &gt; and the safety of the pearl industry, of which Bahrein is the centre. n and the territories of the Trucial Chiefs His. Majesty s Government have, to virtue of various treaties and agreements, conferred similar benefits tor many yeai , their policy in each case has been inspired by the importance of upholding maritime peace, of securing open markets to the commerce o a conn lies, of protecting the long-established interests of British-Indian subjects. His Maiesty’s Government cannot acquiesce in any arrangement wHicn mig restrict or*'undermine the authority which they have exercised ; with such beneficent results ; they conceive that any extension of lurkish junsaiciio along the littoral of the Persian Gulf to the south of Ojeir would be prejudicial to those results and unsupported by any legitimate claims of Turkish sovereignty, they have accordingly resisted any attempts which have been made to encnoac P these regions. They are therefore of opinion that any lasting settlemen n _ the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman ment of Bahrein and adjacent islands and of the whole of the Peninsula o (including El Bidaa), where the Sheikh of Bahrein has important rights; ana tne&gt; consider that such a settlement would finally remove a perennial somce o The Ottoman Government express a wish to regularise the relations of ^vcit towards the Ottoman Empire, and His Majesty’s Government will glad y con to such a solution, on the understanding that their rights and claims are no regarded as prejudiced by any proposals which may now be put forward, s ou proposals prove abortive. . , ^ lipver As the Ottoman Government are aware, His Majesty s Government nce admitted that Koweit is under Turkish protection, and, inasmuch as some ® a of opinion was manifested between the two Governments as to the P osl 10 n modus vivendi was reached in September 1901 by His Majesty’s Governmen ing to give an assurance that, provided the Turkish Governmen asending troops to Koweit and respected the status quo there, they would not occupy that place or establish a British protectorate over it. British trade relations with the Sheikhs of Koweit have existed for upwards of two centuries and, inasmuch as the place has attracted merchants from all quarters by the equity of its rule and the freedom of its trade, His Majesty’s Government could not consent to any interference with the succession or with the internal administration, or any infringement of the complete autonomy of the Sheikh. On the other hand, they are prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit, and to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish Kaimakam, provided in other respects the status quo is guaranteed, and the validity of certain agreements which the Sheikh has concluded with the British Government is recognised ; provided the islands of Warba and Bubian are admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, and Turkish military posts are withdrawn ; and provided finally the Sheikh is admitted to the full and undisturbed enjoyment of any properties he may own or hereafter purchase on Turkish territory. Koweit would thus form a sort of enclave within, and forming part of, the Ottoman Empire, but enjoying complete self-government under Turkish suzerainty. Certain difficulties have recently arisen in regard to the buoyage of the Shat-el- Arab. For a great number of years British shipping has, owing to its volume, been predominantly, and until recently almost exclusively, interested in these aids to navigation. For over fifty years the work of surveying, buoying, and lighting the river has been carried out by British agency to the general satisfaction of all concerned. In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government have some difficulty in appreciating why the Ottoman Government have taken exception to existing and long-standing arrangements ; but, being desirous of dealing with the difficulty in a spirit of conciliation, they would propose to the Ottoman Government the appointment of a small riverain commission, composed of a British and a Turkish representative, with an engineer to be mutually agreed upon. This commission would superintend all matters pertaining to improvement of navigation, and it would likewise superintend the requisite periodical surveys. As regards the rest of the Persian Gulf, on the other hand, the Turkish Govern- 'ment, so far as they are concerned, would recognise the right of Great Britain (a) to control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; (5) to police its waters; and (c) to conduct all quarantine arrangements. (iii.) The Increase from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem in the Turkish Customs Duties. His Majesty’s Government have consistently maintained that they could in no circumstances assent to the increase in the Turkish customs duties unless a previous and satisfactory settlement had been reached in regard to the Bagdad Railway question. To this attitude they adhere ; and while they consider that such a settlement might be promoted on the lines of an agreement such as has already been indicated, they could not regard a settlement confined to the railway as either satisfactory or complete, since it would leave in a state of uncertainty a number of questions closely affecting British interests in the regions of Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Government are in principle favourable to railway construction in Turkey; but they cannot directly contribute to the completion of the Bagdad Railway if it is to introduce a further element of possible disturbance into an area where British rights and interests have, especially of late, been wantonly assailed; nor do they feel that they could justify to British public opinion the imposition of a tax which will affect British trade,—amounting in Mesopotamia to some 60 per cent, of the whole,—unless they have provided for a general settlement of political issues in the Persian Gulf, such as the Ottoman Government themselves desire to bring about, and unless they have obtained some compensation for and a guarantee against the con tinuance of arbitrary acts such as the demolition, on no adequate pretext, of British property in Bagdad. If the Ottoman Government are prepared to enter upon a negotiation on these lines, and to concur, as already stipulated, in a removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt,—a measure which is called for in the interests of financial reform in Egypt,—His Majesty’s Government will make it their first aim to con tribute to an agreement likely to remove all causes of friction between the twor 4 Powers ; and they will not only consent, subject to the concurrence of other Powers and to the due observance of such agreement, to the further increase of the Turkish customs for a fixed period, but they will likewise agree to the continued levy of the 3 per cent, customs increase, which had only been sanctioned provisionally till the year 1914.

Grey to state, I oi one infonaation of the Lords Coraniissioners of the ■Treasury, that he has recently had under consideration, in consultation with the Secretary of State for India, the question of making a survey of certain portions of the Persian Gulf. In a letter dated March 14th, 1911, the Naval CousiUinder-in-Chief, East Indies, reported as follows •'The charts of the Persian Gulf which cover the tracks used by ships proceeding from the Rhatt-el-Arab to Koweit, from Koweit anywhere to the southward, and into Bahrein from the northward, are most inadequate and untrustworthy; new dangers are often being reported, and it is highly probable that we do not know nearly all that exist'.

Aft-esr full consideration of the details, in con cert with the Admiralty end. the Government of Indie, the Secretary of State for India estimates that the cost of carrying out the work in question, by employ ing the Royal Indian Marine Ship 'Palinurus', will be about Pour thousand, six hundred and sixty seven pound# eight shillings per annum for a period of eigt^t years, although the assistance to be rendered by His Majesty's Ship •Odin' as opportunity offers will probably reduce this period to some extent. The Secretary of State for India in Council is prepared to defray from Indian Revenue a moiety of the expenditure( 8920 / 12 ) expenditure on the condition that the Lords Pcmission- ere of the Treasury will accept the other moiety as a charge against the British Exchequer. I eta to express r ir F.. Grey's hope that the Lords CptamlfiBloners will assent to this charge; the claim which His I'ajesty's Government have advanced that, in matters relating to the Persian Gulf, this country is entitled to special consideration, is largely based upon the services rendered by Great Britain in the past in facilitating coraaerce by the supjression of piracy, carrying out of surveys, and by supplying other aids to navigation. Recent investigations have, however, served tc show that existing surveys are inadequate; and, such being the case, there is a consensus of opinion that fresh surveys should be made by British agency before the Importance of the Persian Gulf as an international trade route becomes more accentuated - a development which is generally unticiiutwi upon the completion of theCopy of a letter from the Secretary to the government of India, Marine Department, to the Director of the Boyal Indian Marine, Mo*72-114-M, dated the 4th December 1911, With reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No.8199, dated the 20th November 1911, I am directed Telegram from Secretary of State for India, { to forward the accompany- dated 18th November 1911. } Letter from Admiralty to India Office,dated ( 31st October 1911. $ ing copy of correspond- Letter from India Office to Foreign Office, j No.P.4523, dated 6th November 1911. 5 ______ 0 ence in connection with the surveys in the Persian Gulf, and to request that you will be so good as to furnish, very urgently and in consultation with His Excellency the Navel Commander-In-Chief, the informa tion required by the Most Hobble the Secretary of State for India.Copy of a letter from the Director of the Hoyol maian Kariae, to the Seoretary to the Comment of male.

The allocation of cost will not in these circumstances affect the Admiralty. ’ 3.- In their Lordships opinion, while it is important to show that the survey is being steadily carried out, its rapid completion is not regarded as of such importance as to take precedence of all other work. The most urgent part of the service appears to be the completion of the survey of the Northern portion of the Gulf, as if ships of other nations were to take the ground in these waters representations might be made to the Turkish Government which i&amp;wkk be inconvenient to The Under Secretary of State India Office.

His Majesty’s Government authorise survey as soon as practicable of the waters of Ivhor Abdulla and Khor Assabiya, which adjoin islands of Warba and Bubian, also of the approaches to Bahrein, but, as regards territorial waters of El Katif, since His Majesty’s Government have recognised Turkish claims as far south as Ojeir, no survey should take place there, and operations should be kept within limits indicated in British reply to Turkish Government 29th July, sent by mail of 28th July, without encroaching on regions therein admitted as under Turkish sovereignty. From Viceroy, 2nd September 1911. lour telegram of 5th May 1911. Surveys in the Gulf. The Marine Survey of India has in the past from time to time undertaken surveys in the Gulf, but they have been of short duration. Surveys now projected are estimated to take four years or more if our two survey vessels are employed. It is undesirable that Indian Coastal Survey should be neglected for so long a period, particularly as survey of Burma coast is urgent. Survey work in India still undone is considerable, and will be further retarded if both vessels are employed in the Gulf. In the circumstances only on e vessel can be spared, but this will unduly prolong the work, and we should be glad to know whether the Admiralty can assist by detailing a vessel and thus expedite the work which is politically important, is of international interest, and as closely concerns His Majesty’s Government as the Government of India. In these circumstances the Government of India suggest that the entire cost be equally divided between the two Governments. Cost of employing Admiralty vessel and that of employing Royal Indian Marine vessel being calculated on similar basis. With reference to your telegram of 3rd July, survey of areas proposed to be omitted will not be carried out pending your further instructions.

Political Resident at Bushire reports that Russian Consul-General has hoisted flag staff, and lights at night two powerful lanterns, simplex automatic make, burning incandescent light. Russian and Turkish Consulates Bushire now show four lights all night, and Lloyds and shipping companies are making enquiries. Admiral points out that this is weakening our position, and that if we were to claim preferential rights on account of what we have done for navigation in the Gulf, the reply will be that we have not done what we have acknowledged to be necessary and that other Powers have had to act for the safety of their own ships. Admiral strongly urges immediate action and particularly the installation of inner lighted buoys at Bnshire and lighted buoys at Bahrein.

The Marquess of Crewe had not, I am to explain, apprehended that the work contemplated would be so laborious or occupy so long a period, and he would be glad, before considering the matter further, to receive the observations of the Lords Commissioners on the proposals made in the telegram of the Government of India. If the Lords Commissioners should be prepared to detail a vessel, he would be glad to learn (1) the estimated cost, and (2) the basis on which such cost is calculated, with a view to addressing the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as to the division of the expenditure. A suggestion has been made in connection with a scheme for providing additional lights in the Persian Gulf that a vessel may have to be obtained for use as a lighthouse tender, but his Lordship is not at present aware whether it could, if provided, be used also for survey work, in substitution for one of the two vessels that the Government of India propose should be employed.

Z. The Charts of the Persian Gulf which cover the tracks used by ships proceeding from the 3hatt«al«Areh to Kuwait,from Kuwait anywhere to the southward, and into Bahrein from the northward, are moat inadequate sad untrustworthy# Hew dangers are often e being reported,end it is highly probably that we do not know nearly all that exist# 3* It is most important that this state of things should be rectified as soon as possible, unless we are to run the risk of s repetition of the recent action taken by the Turkish authorities in the 3hett~sl~Ax*b en complaints from German shipping# 4. A farther reason for undertaking this work is the likeli hood that Kuwait and Bahrein may increase in importance and the trade grow in consequence# The approaches to Kuwait and the Shatt-el-Arab in particular must be surveyed thoroughly if the harbour of Kuwait is ever to be developed as the terminus of the Baghdad Bailway, and if we do not take it in hand it may be forced upon us st some future period in a manner which will -not be conducive to the maintenance of our prestige in those mmitssm waters# 5 #Th« survty of the bar will shortly he completed;, and I would recommend that the following work should he taken in hand as soon afterwards as possible:- o (a) Approaches to 3hatt~al-Arab us far iSast aa 49 40 T S, am far South as far West aa limits of chart Kuwait Harbour Ho*a£,as marked. on attached chart, and shown in red* (b) Approaches to Bahrain, Between limits of 50°I5,and (m£i» Bounded en the Uorth by parallel 27 o 10 , II .between 50*S and 51 # S.

Commander-in-Chief*s Office, 0 % Bombay, No.54/1462 X. l4th Mapch 191l&gt; Sir y With reference to correspondence which has alreac^ passed concerning the surveying of the waters of the Northern end of the Persian Gulf, be pleased to lay the following remarks before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General of India in Council. 2. - The charts of the Persian Gulf which cover the tracks used by ships proceeding from the Shatt-al-'Arab to Kuwait, from Kuwait anywhere to the Southward, and into 1 Bahrain from the Northward, are most inadequate and un trustworthy- New dangers are often being reported, and it is highly probable that we do not know nearly all that exist* 3. - It is most important that this state of things should be rectified as soon as possible, unless we are to run the risk of a repetition of the recent action taken by the Turkish authorities in the Shatt-al-'Arah on complaints from German shipping. 4. - A further reason for undertaking this work is the likelihood that Kuwait and Bahrain may increase in importance and the trade grow in consequence. The approaches to Kuwait and the Shatt-al-'Arab in particular must be surveyed thoroughly if the harbour of Kuwait is ever to be developed as the terminus of the Bagdad railway, and if we do not take it in hand it may be forced upon us at some future period in a manner which will not be conducive to the maintenance of our prestige in those waters. 5. - The survey of the bar will shortly be completed, and I would recommend that the following work should be lecretary to the Government of India, Marine Department. takentaken in hand as soon afterwards as possible (a) Approaches to Shatt-al-'Arab as far East as 49 o 40'E., as far South as 29°N., as far West as limits of chart Kuwait Harbour No.22, as marked 'A' on attached chart, and shown in Red.

On attached chart, “Persian Gulf, Sheet 2, No.2837(b)“, the limits of the recently surveyed plans of Kuwait and Bahrain are shown in black. 6.- It is already late in the season and it may be impossible to do very much before it becomes too hot to continue the survey, but as much of the preliminary work as possible should be carried out now, so that delay may not be caused in going on with it next September. 7.- It is suggested that the R.I.M.Surveying Staff should undertake the survey; as much assistance as possible will be afforded by H.M.Ships, provided that they can be spared from the blockade.
