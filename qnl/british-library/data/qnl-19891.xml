BUSHIRE RESIDENCY. /Vo..... rONFIOEHTML RECORDS Belgrave has asked for an interpretation of a cer tain point in connection with the Law regarding ownership of immovable property in Bahrain. As apparently this law was drafted and approved by us I assume that it is our bu- siness to construe it. 2. The point is this. Under Article 3 of the Law the Bahrain Government may compulsorily acquire the property of a foreigner belonging to a 'notified State', but the price to be received by the owner may not be less than the sum de termined by the procedure described in Article 4. Article 4 requires that within three months of the date of the foreign country being notified, every foreigner who is a subject of that country shall submit a list of his immovable property to the District Court, i.e. to the Political Agent. There after the Bahrain Government appoint an assessor and the owner may do likewise, and in case of disagreement betv/een them the .district Court (i.e. the irolitical Agent) appoints his own assessor to give a final decision. Nov; Iran was notiiied on -[ovember 1st, 1937 and the three months ext)ires tomorrow. 3o far only one Persian national has submitted a list of property. Lly information is that there has been a good deal of discussion amongst the Persians whether or not they should acquire Bahrain nationality in order to assure their property, and there is a strong party which believes that/- Ko n^ble Lieutenant-Colonel blr -renchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. j, ^/c-2- that the Property Lav/ is only a bluff by the Bahrain Go vernment to induce Persians to acquire Bahrain nationality. Consequently there is quite a number of Persian property owners who do not propose either to acquire Bahrain nation ality or to submit lists of property. There are also some big Persian property owners who do not reside in Bahrain and naturally none of these have sent in lists either. Anyway, whatever the reason may be, there can be no doubt that 1 ' ' s who do not comply The law c ontains no definite provision for the action to be taken if such lists are not submitted. The obvious sol ution is for the Bahrain Government to proceed ex parte, appointing their own assessor who will submit his report to the District Court, end the District Court should, I think, automatically accept that assessment unless it is satisfied from any infonnation in its possession that the assessment is deliberately partial. Then on the expiry of the year prescribed in Article 3 the Bahrain Government will proceed either to acquire the property or to sell it. 3. Jince, however, the law v/as drafted and approved be fore my time I should like to have an assurance that this procedure is correct and to be authorised to inform the Bahrain Government so officially. with submitting lists Yours sincerelyConfidential. /fh d.o.n q» ^t/ ^6♦ Office of tne Political Resident in the Persian v #ulf f Camp, Bahrain.

These have the right to obtain Persian nationality by registering as such at the Political Agency before tne 7th May 1938 (vide Article 2 (b)). This class is probably larger than class (b) dealt «ith below. - (b) Those persons who are not covered by Article 2 of the Nationality Tiaw. 3uch an individual would be a Pe sian who / 31 r Aubrey Metcalfe, KC1B. ,031. ,UVO., Secretary to tne dOTernment of India, External Affairs department, new Delni,who was neither himself born In Bahrain nor was nls father.

We now learn from Edmonds that the Iraqi deoartmental experts are disposed to take the line that Bahrain, as well as Koweit, was not finally detached from the Ottoman Empire until tf.e date of the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne and that, in consequence, tie inhabitants of both territories come within the scope of Article 3 of the Nationality Law (of 1924), whereby former Ottoman subjects, habitually resident in this country, are declared to have acquired Iraqi nationality on the 6tn August, 1924. 4. as you know, we have hitherto avoided entering into retailed discussion of this complicated master by adoptin;- the tactics approved in your duspa'tch Ko. 119 (a 762/762/91) of the 7tu February, 10X55, but it now seems clear that if we are to savu from conscription Bahrainis of the type of those on wnose behalf we have already intervened, we must produce arguments to destroy the thesis on which the Iraqis a rkndsl, esq., c.m.g. u base.base their arguments (indicated in paragraph 3 above). • f ' 5. In your despatch No. 366 U 7283/1527/91) of the 13th ijeoeraber, 1934, you supplied us with argomonts which we were to use in the ev^nt of its ulti ately oroving necessary to reply to the enquiry originally addressed to us hy the Iraqis in October, 1933. We cannot help feeling, however, that the Iraqis are almost certain to know of the reference to jiahrain contained in the nnglo-Turitish Convention of 1913, which, they will contend, provides evidence that Turkish sovereignty then existed over that island and that, as the agreement was never ratified, that sovereignty persisted until the aate of the Treaty of Lausanne. we should like to know whether the Legal Advisers can meet this point or can in any other way strengthen the abovernentioned arguments which, we fear, may not convince the Iraqis as they stand. 6. We are not unmindful of the fact that, as stated in paragraph 1 of the same despatch, you would prefer, owing to the delicate ana debatable points involved, not to enter into a controversy on this matter at all, but I fear that unless we do so we must give up all idea of saving Bahrainis resident in Iraq from conscription. On the other hand, it is clearly worse than useless to try and save them by means or arguments wnich will not convince the Iraqis. A further difficulty has been suggested by Drower, who points out that Article 1 of the old Ottoman Law of ationality, which was passed in 1369 and, so far as he is awara, still in force in 1924, says simply that the child of an Ottoman father is an Ottoman subject. This is subject to no qualification so that, even had Bahrain been an independent State for many years previously, a native of Bahraia might be posaeeasd of Ottoman nationality pasaed on/on to him In the direct male line from an ancestor some way back.

C/171, aiSTyiP. unl-%c)The Bahrain Property Law is a retaliatory measure and presumably treats the Iranians in the same way as the Iranians treat the loreigners. 2. On the publication of the notification declaring that the nationals of Iran are prohibited from owning immoveable rooerty in Bahrain such nationals would automatically come under the ban. But they are under Article 3 given one year's grace and thereafter their property is liable to be compulsorily acquired or put up for sale by the Bahrain Government. The amount of compensation to be paid for sucn compulsory acquisition or sale is however not to fall short of the amount to be fixed under Article 4. li trie foreigner concerned omits to take the requisite steps menoicned in Article 4 Bf for the valuation of the property the result would be that there would be no 'sum detemined by the valuation prescribed by .orticle 4' and consequently the )\0 compensation payable rail be subject to^minimum. The_ foreigner cannot by his own inaction render the lav/ iijope- rative. 3. Tne procedure, therefore, to be adopted in 'ohe event of a foreign national of a notiiied country failing ^o take BEf action under Article 4 within the prescnoea time will not be that of proceeding ex oprte under that AnToicle- for which there is no provision - but that of pr ocee dingft compulsory acquisition or sale under .rticle 3 as if ohere were *minimum sum payable aa compensation.

' 1069/14/91) 21st March, 1938 h (&gt;9 My dear Gibson Under cover of India Office letter No.P.Z.1236/38 of 24th February we received a copy of Powle f s letter D.O.No.C/56 of 15th February to Metcalfe about the operation of the Bahreini Nationality Law and the Law governinp; the ownership of property in Bahrein by foreigners. We have the following observations to offer on the points raised. 2. In the first place, in paragraphs 3 (a) and (b) Powle uses such phrases as 'to obtain Persian nationality' and 'to retain their Persian nationality'. Again in paragraph 6 appears the phrase 'obtaining Persian nationality 1 '. But it is Persian Law and not Bahreini law which regulates Persian nationality, although the 'master nationality' rule prevents Persian nationality being invoked in Bahrein by a person who possesses dual Bahrein and Persian nationality. It v/ould therefore be more correct in the paragraphs referred to to refer to 'the right (under Article 2 of the Nationality Law) to 'avoid the acquisition of Bahrein nationality 41 • 3. As regards the two classes of Persian nationals to which Powle refers in paragraph 3 of his letter v/e are for the purposes of this letter only concerned with those in category (b), i.e. those who fail to register their property as required by Article 4 of the Property Law. As regards this class, the law is now seen to be defective in that it does not provide very clearly what is to happen if a person who should register his property fails to do so. One reading, which is a possible one, is that the words 'in that event' in the 3rd sentence of Article 4 (line ?) mean that the owner has only the right to appoint an assessor if he has submitted G ibson, Esq., ^ Office.^i 2 ■gj) a list; 'but unfortunately, as Article 4 is drafted, the Bahrein Government also only gets the right to appoint an assessor after a list has been filed. It seems necessary therefore to have a new article (which in turn will necessitate a fresh King^ Regulation as well) in order to fill the gap in the law. 4. We suggest therefore that an amending law be enacted on the following lines; 5# At the end of Article 3; after the words 'Article 4' add the words 'or Article 5 as the case may be' and add a new Article 5 - as follows: 'If a foreigner to whom the provisions of Article 3 apply fails to submit a list of his property as required by Article 4, the Bahrein Government may apply to the District Court for the valuation of the property with a view to its compulsory acquisition. In this case the District Court shall give notice to the owner of the property, who shall be permitted to appear, and shall then determine the valuation of the property; and may adopt for its purpose such procedure as the Court shall deem just and appropriate in the circumstances'• 6. Under this text the District Court could in fact still allow the owner to appoint an assessor, as in Article 4, and it may be, in many cases, best that it should do so, as we want to go a long way to avoid any reasonable ground of complaint; but it will not do to provide in terms that a man who does not obey the law and register his property is still just as well off as a man who does. Moreover, even if this amending legislation takes time to effect we think that the District Court should in practice so deal v/ith the matter in the meanwhile, i.e. should in general give a man whose property is to be confiscated a chance of appointing an assessor unless there is something very much against him. 7. There is just one other point to which it is necessary to draw attention. In the English text of the Property Law which formed an enclosure to the Political Resident 1 s/3^ 4° 3. Resident's Express letter No.C/253 of 24th September 1937 to the Government of India (a copy was sent to us in India Office letter P.Z.6717/37 of 14th October 1937) the words 'benefit, except within the limits required for their' are omitted between the v/ords 'their' and 'residence' in Article 1.

I felt sure that Iranian Government would take no action until they had heard the other side. Leaving aside Iran's claim to sovereignty the Shaikh was within his rights in expropriating and simple time had been given to Iranians to make their choice. The Shaikh's policy was analagous to that enforced a few years ago as regards Bahrainis in Iran. Iran's claim to sovereignty could not reasonably debar the Shaikh taking administrative steps that in his judgnent had become necessary. 2. 1 felt perfectly certain however that H^s Majesty's Government would gladly use their influence in the sense { ? that ) expropriation and expulsion if necessary should be carried out with all possible consideration.

You will -- a ^7 see from the enclosed copy of a letter from Po.vle that the G-overnment of India's view appeals to him as a ..le^ns of avoiding inconvenience and delay. Bat we feel doubtful here whether as a matter of construction the aov^rnment of India 1 s solution can be derived from the language of the Bahrein Property Law, and even if it could it would seem open to objection on the ground that no guidance is given as to whether any compensation at all is payable. On the point of construction I enclose a copy of a note by our Legal Adviser. We should, however, be glad to know whether the views conveyed in your letter of the 21st March are affected hy --/t-S/. those expressed in Hay's letter of the 8th ^_jril. (3d.) J. P. Gibson. ,r - V.

Z. 2748/38). It ^ r-1% - may be said that Article 3 permits compulsory acoiisition in general terms; and so it does, but unfortunately with the rider that the owner is to get not less than the sum deter dned by the valaation prescribed in article i+. That is as much as to say that the concluding sentence of Article • A ^ necessarily imports the procedure of Article 4, which in turn is dependent for its exercise upon the foreign owner submitting a list of property and a co^;y being furnished to the Bahrein Government. I do not think any ./arrant for ex parte proceedings is to be extracted from the language of the Law. (3d.) H. G-. Pearson, 20.5.38.|I V P.Z.4128/1938.

We agree generally with the views expressed in your letter and with the opinion of your Legal adviser on the interpretation of the law. It seems to us doubtful whether the solution suggested by the Goveniuent of India js tenable on a strict interpretation of the text. 3- But leaving the cjuestion of legal interpretation apart, we feel that it is in any case desirable, in order to avoid confusion in the future, that a new King's Regulation should be published embodying an amendment which makes the position absolutely clear for those who are likely to be affected. Otherwise a Persian subject who had not con lied with the provisions of Article 4 might have some justification for complaining, if his property were disposed of in the manner suggested by the G-overnment of India, on the ground that it was not stated that a particular penalty, or indeed any penalty, i * was involved. k- Moreover, as indicated in ijaragraph 6 of my letter of the 21st March, it seems most desirable to avoid giving the Persian G-overnment any presentable cause of complaint or doing anything which might lead to further difficulties with them. 5. ye feel, therefore, that the very least that is required is that if the Bahrein O-overnment do move ex ..arte, they should do so in the sense of putting the assessment procedure/ Gibson Esq..lit - 2 - procedure into motion of their own volition and snould only jut che property up for sale, or acquire it at their own valua oion, ^xtnoj.t carrying the assessinent procedure through, iii the event of une ovimer concerned failing' to appoint an assessor.

Dear Chancery, /f- i Your letter No.192/19/38 dated the 6th July 1938. 2. ^e enclose herewith a copy of King 1 s Regulation No.2 of 1937. 3. Iranians can only enter Bahrain if they hold a proper passport bearing a visa for Bahrain granted by a British passport authority. Such visa is not given on an 'ilnwi-Khabar 11 f which is not recognised by either British or Bahrain authorities as it implies that Bahrain is an Iranian port. As the Iranian authorities persist in granting only 'ilm-i-khabars' to Iranians applying to travel to Bahrain, it follows that Iranians are unable to enter Bahrain. In a few exceptional cases, generally on humanitarian grounds, e.g. medical treatment, Iranian applicants are granted by this Residency a certificate requesting the Bahrain authorities to permit the holder to land without being in possession of a visa. The 'ilm-i-khabar' which such persons have to obtain from the local Iranian authorities in order to leave the country is not displayed at Bahrain.

' L.Mo .192/17 Afl ^miahiLegati on, ,^3 2nd July,1938. • Dear Sir Aubrey, I expect that you will have seen telegrams about the expulsions of about a hundred Persians from Bahrein. I am rather hazy about conditions as regards entrances to, residences in and exits from Bahrein, but 1 observe that the expulsion orders are countersigned by the Political Hesident. 2. There is therefore this quaint position, that an official whom the Persian Government do not recognise, residing on Persian soil, has expelled Persians in considerable numbers from and imprisoned them in, territory that Persia lays claim to. 3. The Political Resident has given some useful information and a breathing space administratively - see my telegram*No.57 of to-day, and 1 trust that, with a new and friendly Minister for Foreign Affairs in the person of Scheily, the trouble will die down- But it seems to me possible that the Persian Grovernment might make repetition of such expulsions an occasion for objecting to the presence of the Political Resident in Bushire, telling us at the same time that they have no objection to a Consul-General or Consul remaining there. 4* I am sending no copy elsewhere of this expression of a personal misgivir^s I Yours very sincerely, Sd: Navile ButlerSl-Tla, the llth July 1938. iary thanks for your letter No.192/17/38 of 2nd July 1938 regarding'; the expulsions of Persians from Bahrein. I was not avtare that the expulsion orders had been uountcrsigned by Fowle and I agree with you that this feature of the business -night produce a soTOwhat avvkv.ard situation vls -a-vls the Persians. So far as I can see, the expulsions themselves ere fully Justified on the grounu of Uescitutlon and,as the Persians are so fond of exielllng foreigners from their territory even without this excuse, I feel that on the •.or Its they cannot retsonably object to the return of their subjects to Iran, It Is, on the other hand, obvious that they -light use It es en excuse for a further protest regarding Bahrein end also perhaps as a pretext for refusing to pemlt the Political ilusldent to renaln at Bushlre. Fov.ie, as you probably know, is proposing to take his ordinary two month's leave i;ome from the end of this •month and our Idea Is to put ■el^itman In as Political nesldent, which would of course entail his moving over from .jahreln to iJunhlro. e shall be asking you about this officially In order to obtain an exequatur for elghtman.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the Bahrain Governmen is concerned by the fact that a great proportion of the most valuable land property in Bahrain^ especially in Llanama, is in | x-he hands of foreigners v/ho acquired it in the past by purchase recent legislation affecting Iranians has restricted own ership by Iranians to their residences and places of work. Other nationalities who have acquired much property in the vrst and who a re continuing to buy land are Saudi Arrbians and, to a lesser extent, Iraqis, the latter are mostly Jews. 3. The Bahrain Government understands, from unofficial enqui ries which have been made, that no foreigner is allowed to purchase land or property in Iraq or in Najd or Hassa, except 1 ' ^ under special circumstances by permission of the respective .! J Governments. It therefore follows that Bahrain subjects cannot buy land or house property in those count ires although 'there is no such restriction against nationals of those countries purchasing property in Bahrain. 4. The Bahrain government is considering the advisability of adopting reciprocal measures in Bahrain by means of a law forbidding Bahrain subjects to sell land to Iraqis or iaudi _ —* - ry. *•»••*»&gt; —•' - * ^ 1 Arabians, but before any further discussions take place I should be grateful if you would confirm the fact that a law- exists in Iraq, Kassa and Tajd forbidding foreigners to pttB*. chase pro )erty.

' lVe see no objection in principle to the enactment of legislation by the Bahrein Government forbidding or limitinr the acquisition ol property in Bahrein by foreigners generally. At the same time we would prefer that at this moment of all moments the Bahrein Government should defer taking action which, however legitimate and justifiable in itself, may inevitably give rise to some complaint in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. 2. A further point which I suggest should be considered is whether fresh legislation is required at all. If Saudi Arabia and Iraq in fact restrict the holding of property by foreigners, or certain classes of foreigners which include T : ahreinis, can the Bahrein Government not simply 'notify' these countries under the Law of the 17th February, 1937, (which incidentally is not exactly 'legislation affecting Persia' in the sense of affecting Persia alone) as has already been done in the case of Persia? If, on the other hand, either Saudi Arabia or Iraq fails to impose the necessary restrictions on foreigners or at any rate on Bahreinis, and it is important to restrict the ownership of property by Saudi or Iraq 'ibson, Egq #) nationals/vL nationals, as the case may be, special legislation may be necessary. This legislation could clearly not be aimed at Saudi and Iraq nationals alone, as the Bahrein Government seem to contemplate. It would have to be uni/ersal, In fact, from our point of view universal legislation would in many ways be preferable at the present jucture to 'notification' of either Saudi Arabia or Iraq under the existing legislation. 4. This is, in the circumstances of today, only a hurried line, T have not had time to go into the question thoroughly, but we do think it important that the Bahrein Government snould avoid any action likely to give rise to a wrangle with the Saudi Arabian or Iraqi Governments just now.

We have now got rid of the majority of indigent Persians who had oeen living for some time in Bahrainj and deportations now only affect those persons who from time to time attempt to effect entry without a passport. 3. These people are normally caught inside a week and each 'dhow-load' comes up to be dealt with by the Court separately. Persians so caught normally get a sentence of imprisonment and are deported after release. Thus, though T may as District Magistrate pass an order of deportation against four or five 'dhow-loads' at once, the actual date of deportation depends on the date of release from jail. Thus of the batch who are up for deportation at the moment some are due to go on the 3rd October, others on the 20th October, 30th October, 8th November and 24th November.

Dear Baxter, / ft * Foreign Office printed despatch No. 244 (E5843/53/91) dated September 5th transmits for our observations copies of correspondence relating to the Bahrein lav/ on the ownership of land by foreigners. 2. I reported on this question in my des-oatch of June ^ tn 12th, 1957, No. 113 (928/227/4). No person not a Saudi subject is allowed to own real property in the Hejaz, but tixe^e is no restriction on the ownership of real property in other parts o.i Saudi Arabia. No complaint has ever been raised by a Bahraini in the Hejaz on thi-s score, and it appears probable that no person claiming Bahraini nationality is domiciled in the Hejaz. According to a letter addressed by the Political Resident Bushire to the s fa* 11+ % Government of India on August 3rd, 1937, no Bahrain subjects are known to own real property in Saudi Arabia. It will be seen, then, that the disability of the foreigner to own land in Saudi Arabia only applies to part of Saudi Arabia, that apparently no Bahraini owns real property in those parts of Saudi Arabia where there is no restriction on ownership by foreigners, and that no Bahraini has a practical grievance on this account at present. 3. In view of the state of affairs described above, and of the necessity to maintain good relations with Ibn Saud at this difficult time, I endorse heartily the opinion ^ expressed/ Baxter, Esq., C.M. G ., M.C., oreign Office.expressed in the last paragraph of the letter addressed hy Eyres to Gihson of the India Office on September 4th (No. 5843/53/91) and trust that the Bahrain Government will 3 ind it possible to postpone action in the matter in so far as it would affect subjects of Saudi Arabia.

If, therefore, the Bahrein G-overnment consider it essential to introduce a law restricting the acquisition of land by foreigners, we would urge that such legislation should be of an universal nature, as was suggested in parapraph 3 of my letter L 5843/53/91 of the 4:th September# 3» But, o-i course, we should much prefer them to leave the matter alone for the present.

In his memorandum 110.646/9-A# dated the 13th July 1937, to the Political Agent, Bahrain, the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain stated that no Bahrain subjects were known to own real property in the Hejaz# No mention was made of the rest of ^audi Arabia, and the substitution of ^Saudi Arabia* for /f/y •the Hejai* in the Hesidenoy Express Letter quoted above was apparently an error as it is believed that some Bahrain subjects do own property in i«ejd e.g. at ^atif. yf f j 3. further, in paragraph 4 of Jedda despatch Iio.113, dated the 12th June 1937, to the Foreign Office, His Majesty's Minister reported that the restrictive Saudi legislation applied only to the Hejaz, and in paragraph 2 of Jedda despatch No# 2265/2265/1185/3, deited the 7th October 1939, the legation confirm that this le still the caee.

It is totally inaccurate to state that 'no Bahrainis are known to own real property in Saudi Arabia'. Several Bahrain subjects do in fact own landed property in Qatif. 3. Equally the Advisees statement that no foreigner is allowed to purchase land or property in Nejd or Hasa is incorrect. There has been no interference with Bahrain subjects who own property in Qatif and the basis of the Bahrain Government's belief was apparently an inaccurate statement made by some Shia residents of Qatif who are not themselves Bahrain subjects. So far as can be discovered no Bahraini has recently attempted to acquire property in Saudi Arabia but I happen to know that Ibn Saud gave a garden on the mainland to Abdullah bin Jabr, Secretary to His Highness the Shaikh, during his recent visit to Bahrain. 4. So far as Saudi Arabia is concerned therefore there can be no question of retaliatory prohibitive legislation. As for Iraq we can, I think, advise the Bahrain Government to take no action so long as war continues, but thereafter- 9 _ IE* I suggest that His Majesty 1 s Government should reconsider their objections to utilising existing legislation to apply- to Iraqis in Bahrain identically the same restrictions as affect Bahrainis in Iraq. To enact legislation of universal application in order to avoid untenable objections from the Iraq Government seems to me an unnecessarily cumbersome procedure.

No question, therefore, arisee, of retalia tory legislation against Saudi Arabia. 3. In the case of Iraq, as no alterations have been made since 1937 in the rights of foreigners to own property, yf 7 Bcihrainis, like other foreigners, cannot acquire more than one dwelling house. From the local point of view it would there fore appear preferable to utilise existing legislation to apply to Iraqis in Bahrain the sa e restrictions as affect Bahrainia in Iraq, rather than to enact fresh legiilation of universal application. With regard, however, to the possibility of such action provoking resentment in Iraq, I am instructing the Political Agent to advise the Bahrain Government that the whole question should be left in abeyance for the duration of the war, which advice I have no doubt will be accepted. sd.

We concur in your proposal to authorise the Political Resident to inform the Bahrain Government that there is now no objection to their 'notifying' the Persian Government. 3. But we still feel obliged to stipulate that in the event (not necessarily very probable) of the Persian Government complaining of discrimination as between Persia and other countries, their complaint will have to be examined and dealt with on its merits. As regards Saudi AraOia, I think we could show that the question of discrimination did not arise, if only because foreigners may apparently own property in Nejd; but as regards Iraq, I think our task might be rather harder. The fact that the Bahrains in Iraq have not as yet encountered any difficulties is certainly hopeful, but this is possibly because the Iraqi authorities regard them as Iraqi subjects. The effect of a Persian complaint following upon the 'notification' of Persia in Bahrain might in fact ^e ^o create difficulties for these people where none existed beiore. 4.
