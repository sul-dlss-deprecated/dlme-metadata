THE position in regard to the arms traffic on the various sections of the Persian Gulf littoral is briefly as follows :— 1. Muscat. —Muscat has for many years been an emporium for the arms traffic, and the trade has now attained to such dimensions that in 1906-7 the total value of the imports of arms and ammunition amounted to 112,338/, The situation is governed by.the fact that the Sultan of Muscat has Commerciul Treaties with France, Holland, and the United States, under the terms of which it would be impossible for him to impose special restrictions on the importation of arms and ammunition into his dominions without the consent of the Powers in question. The result is that arms flow freely into Muscat, and are thence distributed throughout Persia, Arabia, and Afghanistan. From the last-named country a considerable proportion of the arms find their way to the tribesmen of the [1226] BIndian North-West Frontier, Trith results which have been described by the Government of India as ''constituting a grave menace to the peace of the border.' To such an alarming extent has this process been going on that in JFebruarv 1907 the Government of India esti- Government of India s letler of mated that out of the 270,000 men belonging February 21,190 to the frontier tribes no less than 94,000 possessed breech-loading rifled arms. The view is pretty generally held that, until Muscat is closed to the importation of arms, it will be impossible to place any effective check on the export trade by native dhows to other ports on the Gulf littoral. The total number of rifles imported from Great Britain into Muscat reached 13,831 in the year 1900. During the two following years there w T as a marked decline, but in 1904-5 the total number of imported rifles was believed to be not less than 20,000. Recent figures point to a still more remarkable increase, and the custom-house returns show that, during the quarter ending the India Office to 30th September, 1907, some 10,000 rifles and ^vember^,' 7,000,000 cartridges were shipped from the 1907. United Kingdom to Muscat. Besides the imports from this country there is known to be a con siderable trade with the port of Marseilles. The Government of India calculated in Eebruary 1907 that, whereas in 1899-1900 only about one- seventh of the imports w r ere from France, by 1905 the proportion of French arms had risen to two-fifths. M. Goguyer, a local French mer- cbant, who has from time to time lent large sums of money to the Sultan, is known to be deeply involved in the arms traffic. Another French merchant, M. Caracalla, was reported in July 1906 to have arrived at Muscat, with the apparent intention of taking part in the trade. In the returns for 1906-7 Belgium appears for the first time as an importer of arms into Muscat, though it is believed that rifles of Bel gian manufacture have for many years past been imported in considerable numbers. In 1897 the Government of India determined to make an effort to check the arms traffic at Muscat, and, accordingly, in January 1898 joint representations were made to the Sultan by the British and Persian Governments, urging him to co-operate in the suppression of the traffic. His Highness fell in with the suggestion, and on the 13th January of that year issuedGovernment of India's letter of February 10,1898. India Office to Foreign Office, October 19, 1,898. Government of India's letter of March 31,1904. 1 Mr. Brodrick's telegram of June 24, 1908. (1) a Notification warning his subjects that the importation of arms and ammunition into India and Persia was illegal; and (2) a Proclamation authorizing British and Persian vessels of war to search, within Muscat territorial waters, vessels carrying the British, Persian, or Muscat flag, as well as Muscat vessels in Indian and Persian waters, and to confiscate arms and ammunition intended for Indian and Persian ports. The right of search does not extend to the vessels of other nations, and, as has been stated above, the terms of his Commercial Treaties render it impossible for the Sultan, without the consent of the Treaty Powers, to impose any general restriction on the import of arms into Muscat. In the same year, 189S, with a view to imposing a further check on the arms traffic in Oman, rules were issued requiring all British subjects possessing arms within the Sultan's territory to register the same at the British Consulate. It may be doubted, however, whether this measure has done more than throw the trade to an increasing extent into foreign hands. In the same way, it seems not unlikely that the action recently taken by the British India Steam Navigation Company to check the smuggling of arms in small quantities by the Company's steamers in the Gulf may only result in diverting traffic of this kind to vessels which are not placed under such restrictions.* It may be added that the import of arms at Gwadur, the Sultan of Muscat's dependency on the Mekran coast, was prohibited by a Proclama tion issued by His Highness on the 3rd March, 1891. In March 1904, the Grovernment of India proposed that the terms of the Muscat Proclama tion of 189S should be extended so as to cover the export of arms to Turkish ports, and to the territories of the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit, and of the Trucial Chiefs, as well as to ' Indian an(t Persian ' ports, which already fell within the scope of the Proclamation. This proposal was not carried into effect, it being at the time held undesirable, in view of the Sheikh's position in regard to the warfare in Central Arabia, # to impose any fresh restrictions on the importation of arms at Koweit. The necessary arrangements with Turkey also presented some difficulty. * See below, under Koweit.The Government of India have also from time to time recommended— (1.) That the French Government should be approached with a view to their being induced to agree to the total prohibition of the arms traffic at Muscat; and (2.) That the Porte should be asked to agree to our patrolling the Turkish littoral against arms smugglers, or at least to declare the illegality of the traffic. Neither of these suggestions has hitherio Government of . 33 . . . India's letter of borne fruit. The question was passed in review February 21,1907. by the Government of India as recently as February 1907, and the conclusion at Vhich they arrived, after a careful and detailed ex amination of the case, was that the arms traffic would continue to flourish and increase until an Agreement with France was arrived at, and a complete prohibition was enforced against the importation of arms and ammunition into the territories of the Sultan of Muscat. The whole question will come up for discussion at the forth coming International Conference at Brussels. Under the Brussels Act of 1890 for regulating the traffic in arms, any one of the Signatory Powers that has occasion to authorize such traffic in territories of its own lying within the region affected by the provisions of the Act is required to establish a &lt;e public warehouse' under the control of its local Administration, in which all imported arms must be deposited, and from which they may not be withdrawn without the previous authorization of the Administration. There seems no hope of obtaining the consent of France and the other Powers having Treaty relations with Muscat to the Sultan's prohibiting, propno ivotu, the import of arms into his dominions. The only remedy for the present evil would, therefore, appear to be to bring Muscat, at the forthcoming Conference, within the scope of the Brussels Act of 1890, and to enforce there the provisions requiring the establishment of a warehouse under proper supervision. If this is done, two questions will arise :— (a.) What inducement shall be offered to the Sultan, a Sovereign whose independence has been guaranteed by Great Britain and France, to accept restrictions on a traffic amounting to- 0 x^- w: / 112,338/.per annum, and yielding a customs revenue of 5,617/. per annum ? (&amp;.) How will it be possible to provide efficient machinery for carrying' out the provisions of the Act, without admitting a system of inter national control inconsistent with the main tenance of the present political predominance of Great Britain ? The control of the arms traffic would pre sumably be vested in the Sultan's Customs Department. There is thus afforded an additional arsrument in favour of the Government of India's o proposals,! renewed during the present year, that they should acquire the control of the Customs Administration of Muscat, guaranteeing the Sultan a minimum income of 20,000 dollars per mensem (25,600/. per annum at the rate of exchange current in 1907). It has been suggested that a suitable compensation to the Sultan for the Viceroy's loss of income entailed by the prohibition of the February 'is, 1908. arms traffic would be to double the present subsidy he receives from Indian revenues (5,760/. per annum), and to raise it gradually, as may be necessary, to 15,000/. per annum. It is to be feared that if other Powers contribute towards the compensation paid to His Highness they will obtain a locus standi for interference in the Muscat Customs Administration, which would constitute a serious disturbance of the status quo. 2. Bahrein. —On the 30th April, 1898, the Sheikh of Bahrein, on the advice of the President in the Persian Gulf, agreed 44 absolutely to pro hibit the importation of arms into Bahrein territory or exportation therefrom'; and to enforce the prohibition, he issued on the same day— (1.) A Notification declaring that the import and export of arms into and from the Islands of Bahrein was absolutely forbidden, and that in future all arms and ammunition imported or exported would be seized and confiscated as property of the State. (2.) A Proclamation conferring on British and Persian vessels of war permission to search vessels Government of India's letter of July 7, 1898. * Value of imports of arms and ammunition in 1906-7; 5,617/. represents 5 per cent, (the amount of the customs duty at Muscat) on this sum. f See pp. 14, 15 of Foreign Office Memorandum of the 12th February, 1908. [1226] 06 carrying the British, Persian, or Bahrein flag in Bahrein territorial waters, as well as Bahrein vessels in Indian or Persian waters, and to confiscate all arms and ammunition (weapons of war) intended for Indian or Persain ports, or for the Islands of Bahrein. The effect of the prohibition at Bahrein was at once perceptible in the customs returns, the total value of the imports of arms aad ammunition, which had amounted to 30,849/. in 1S97, falling to 813/. in the following year. In October 1905 the Sheikh of Bahrein addressed a Memorial to the Government of India, in which, among other alleged grievances, he complained of the fact that he was obliged to interdict the sale of arms, and was thereby deprived of an advantage enjoyed by all May 31,1906. the Arab Chiefs along the Arabian coast. He was informed, in reply, in May 1906, that the restric tion on the importation of arms at Bahrein had first been imposed in 1895 by himself on his own initiative, and his attention was drawn to the measures he had himself spontaneously taken from time to time to stop the traffic. It was also pointed out to him that the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast had simi larly prohibited the traffic of arms in their terri tory, and he was given to understand that the Government of India would not consider for a moment the possibility of cancelling or modi fying the Agreement he had concluded with the British Government on this point. There seems srood reason to believe that a con- Major Co x to 0 , Government or siderable amount of illicit arms traffic goes on at Ma, Bahrein. W riting in December 1906, Major ^ e(eni ^ er -&gt; Cox furnished evidence that the port was rapidly rising to importance as a centre of the trade. The business in arms there, hitherto confined to one dealer, had been taken over by a Company, two of the shareholders being friends of Sheikh Esa and opponents of customs reform. He added that the business had been largely extended, and Bahrein was being used as a distribution centre for supplying Persia. 3. Koweit. —On the 24tli May, 1900,the Sheikh Government of .... i. ' au ai- India 's letter of of Koweit entered into an agreement with the j uly 5&gt; 190a British Government, by which he engaged ' abso lutely to prohibit the importation of arms into Koweit or exportation therefrom. 1 ' To carry out this engagement he issued on the same day (1) a Notification declaring that ' the importation© Viceroy's telegram of May 29,1904. Mr. Brodrick to Government of India, June 24, 1904, Major Knox to Government of India, May 7, 1907. of arms and ammunition into Koweit and the territory under my control, and the exportation of the same are absolutely prohibited,' and that ' all arms and ammunition imported into any parts of Koweit territory, or exported therefrom, in future will be seized and confiscated (2) a Proclamation conferring on British and Persian vessels of war the right to search, in Koweit territorial waters, vessels carrying the British, Persian, or Koweit flag, as well as Koweit vessels in Indian and Persian waters ; and to confiscate any arms and ammunition destined for Indian, Persian, or Koweit ports. In spite of the above Notification little serious attempt has been made to check the import of arms into Koweit. In April 1904, at a time when tribal warfare was in full progress in the interior of Arabia, the Government of India pointed out that no arrangements had as yet been made with the Porte for the combined suppression of the traffic, and that the impor tation of arms was proceeding briskly. In view of the support rendered by the Turks to Bin Kashid, Amir of Nejd, one of the warring Chiefs of the interior, the Government of India were anxious that no additional check should be imposed on the arms traffic at Koweit, which afforded the main source of supply to the rival Chieftain, Bin Saoud, Amir of the Wahabi. It was explained that this did not involve autho rizing the Sheikh of Koweit to import arms, or even relaxing measurs actually in force, but merely letting matters remain as they were. His Majesty's Government accepted this view, and the Government of India were informed on the 24th June, 1904, that fresh measures for the prevention of the importation of arms at Koweit would for the present be deferred. The latest reports of the Political Agent at Koweit show that a large and increasing traffic in arms is being carried on at that port. Major Knox, in his Trade Report for 1906-7, drew attention to the large increase during the year in the value of the arms imported in country sailing-boats, and remarked that ' the well-known dislike of the British authorities to this traffic, while it has had no effect in checking the import of arms and ammunition, has had the very un fortunate result of losing to a British Companv (the British India Steam Navigation Company) the freight on 13 lakhs' worth of goods.'8 Maior Knox found it necessary in Mav 1906 Ma j or Cox to •' , Government to remind Sheikh Mubarak formally of his Arms of India, Prohibition of 1900, and to request that it Au 8 ust 19 ' 1&lt;Jub - might be more strictly enforced. The Sheikh did not take the reminder in good part, and the Ilpsident in the Persian Gulf gave his opinion that the question was one which might at any time endanger the good relations between the Sheikh and the Political Agent. Major Knox put the case still more strongly in a letter to the Resident. 'The Proclamation,' he wrote on the 3rd July, 1906, is not worth the paper it is written on, and is only a cause of friction.' 4. Trucial Chiefs. —At the close of 1902 the Trucial Chiefs entered into engagements respect ing the arms traffic, similar to those of the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Kosveit. 5. Turkey. —The importation of arms and munitions of war of all kinds into Turkey was prohibited by an Imperial Decree which was notified to the British Embassy in February 1862. The orders issued under this Decree to the custom-house authorittes were communicated to the British Embassy by the Ottoman Govern ment on the 11th February, 3 863. They forbade absolutely the import into any part of the Ottoman Empire of all arms and ammunition, except ' les armes de chasse et de luxe, les armes blanches, tels que sabres, epees et couteaux, et la poudre de chasse en petite quantite, destines a I'usage priv^' ; and stated that all contraband articles would be confiscated by the State. On the 4th October, 1893, the Porte made a fresh communication to the Powers, inclosing the Regulations which had been accepted in the Turco-German Commercial Treaty just then concluded, and notifying them as those in force. The acceptance of these Regulations was not at the time considered opportune by Great Britain and the other Powers, but it would seem that, nevertheless, the Turkish Government con tinued to regard the Ptegulations as those in force in the Ottoman dominions. In their despatch of the 30th July, 1903, the Government of Government of India recommended that an en- In(lia ' s letter of i ill! . July 30, 1903. deavour should be made to come to an arrange ment with Turkey permitting vessels under the Turkish flag to be searched for arms by British ships of war, or, failing this, that the Porte should be asked to notify formally to His Majesty's Government that the importation of(s Sir N. O'Conor to Lord Lansdowne, November 16, 1903. ; * Mr. Thomson to Lord Granville, July 12, 1881. ■I Sir M. Durand to Lord Salisbury, June 10, 1898. arms into Ottoman dominions without special licence was prohibited. Sir N. O'Conor, who was consulted on the matter, drew attention to the notifications that had already been made by the Turkish Govern ment, and suggested that they might sufficiently serve the purpose the Government of India had in view. As regards the right of search. Sir N. O'Conor wrote : In conversation with, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, I gathered that the Turkish Government would be willing enough to co-operate in our endeavours to suppress the traffic in arms, but that the right to search Turkish vessels could only be conceded in exchange for a reciprocal privilege; an arrange ment which, however one-sided it might prove in practice, would, in principle, be open to obvious objections.' 6. Persia. —In 1881 the Persian Government issued a Decree that ' no arms or munitions of war, such as guns, caps, gunpowder, &amp;c., should enter Persian territory without the per mission of the Great Government.' In an nouncing the issue of this Decree to the British Legation, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote as follows on the 3rd July, 1881 : ' Since the right of purchasing arms and introducing the same into Persia belongs to the Persian Government, who exercise it through their own specially appointed officials, and if this absolute right were not exclusively confined to the Govern ment, and everybody who thought fit to do so were allowed to purchase such articles and intro duce them into the country, this great govern mental privilege would become obsolete, and considerable evils would result to the State. Therefore, His Majesty the Shah has issued orders that no one shall import arms of any description whatsoever into this country from abroad, and any person in whose possession arms of foreign make are found will be liable to have them confiscated by Government.' As regards the measures taken by the Persian authorities to enforce the Decree of 1881, it may be noted that in May 1891 both the Shah himself and the Amin-es-Sultan telegraphed to the Governor of Bushire complaining of the sale in Tehran of arms by British and Parsee merchants, and giving strict orders that the prohibition on imports should be maintained, and all arms [1226] D10 imported should be confiscated. In the year 1S93 the local authorities seized seventeen cases of arms consigned to a Muscat firm, which were landed at Bushire for transhipment, on the ground that complaints had been received from the Turkish Government of arms being smuggled from Persian territorv. The s'oods were confis- cated. In the year 1895 the British steamer ' Zulu' landed by mistake at the Bushire custom-house several cases of arms consigned to Muscat; these were seized by the local au thorities. In January 1897, while the 'Zulu' case was still pending, the first preventive officer was appointed at Bushire by the Persian Govern ment. Apart from these incidents, there is nothing Sir M. Dnrand to to show that effective measures were taken to isfisd Z ' prevent the smuggling of arms, and on the 15th April, 1896, Sir M. Durand, in a despatch to Lord Salisbury, admitted that there could be ' little doubt that a considerable illicit import of arms into Persia is being carried on, and that European firms are not wholly unconcerned in it.' At the close of 1897, as a result of British Mr. C. Hardmge to Lord Salisbury, pressure, the Persian Government agreed that January 5,1898. in addition to such measures as may be taken by Persian officials. Her Majesty's ships should examine and search all merchant-vessels trading in the Persian Gulf, and confiscate and hand over to the Persian Government all prohibited arms found on board.' The Grand Vizier's note of the 18th December, 1897, in which this Agree ment was embodied, further stated that the Persian Government was ready ' to join with Iler Majesty's Grovernment in requesting the Sultan of Muscat to notify in the ports and territories of Muscat that arms should not be imported from that side into Persia or Hindustan, also that English ships should exercise in regard to search and confiscation the same rights in Muscat as in Persian waters.' The joint representations to the Sultan were successful, and it was owing to the conclusion of an Agreement with Muscat that Her Majesty's ship 'Lapwing' was able, on the 24th January, 1898, to seize the steamer u Baluchistan,' near Muscat, and capture the cargo of arms she was carrying. An action was brought by Messrs. 'Times' Law Eracis, Times, and Co., who had shipped a consign- fsTs^and^July 9, ment of arms by the ' Baluchistan,' against the 1901 -11 y Sea Insurance Company (Limited) to recover a loss under a policy of marine insurance on the consignment. This loss the Company had refused to pay on two grounds : (1) That the plaintiffs had, when effecting the insurance, concealed a fact material to the estimation of the risk, viz., that the importation of arms was forbidden by Persian law ; and (2) that the adventure was illegal, as being in contravention to the law of nations. Mr. Justice Bigham, in giving judg ment for the plaintiffs, held that ' the import of arms was not illegal according to the law of Persia, as that law was administered in practice and enjoined,' or, in other words, that no real prohibition existed on the importation of arms into Persian ports. As regards the legality of the act of seizure, the question was determined by the further action brought by Messrs. Pracis, Times, and Co. against Captain Carr, H.N., the officer who had seized the ' Baluchistan,' for wrongful deprivation of property. Mr. Justice Grantham, who tried the case in the first instance, found for the defendant, and his judgment, after being reversed by the Court of Appeal, was finally upheld by the House of Lords, on the ground that the seizure had taken place in Muscat territorial waters, and was, under the Sultan's Proclamation of January 1898, justifiable according to the law of Muscat. Mr. Spring-Rice On the 1st January, 1900, the Shah promul- May^S, i900 bUry ' a law reaffirming the prohibition against the importation into Persia of arms and ammuni tion, as well as various other commodities. The case of the British steamer 44 Hathor,' on board of which arms were seized at Bushire in November 1900, led to an Order in Council being issued, on the recommendation of the Law Officers of % the Crown, by which, the Persian Law of the 1st January, 1900, was made applicable to r British subjects, in so far as the provisions respecting arms and ammunition were concerned. Mr. Grant Duff It may be said generally that the efforts of the of £dia rnment Persian authorities to put down the traffic have July 28, 1906. been quite ineffectual. ' Possibly,' wrote Mr. Grant Duff in July 1906, 'when M. Naus has received the launches, now building for the Persian Government at Bombay ' (since supplied) ' something may be done by the Belgian officials to check the arms traffic. But there is no present likelihood of the Persian Government taking the slightest trouble to put an end to it. Even if r12 they desired to do so, I doubt if they have the power.' The Government of India have done their best to check the trade at the Persian ports. In 1900 a Vice-Consul was appointed to Bunder Abbas, where it was hoped that the presence of a British officer might lead to the display of greater vigour in the repression of the illicit importation of arms along the neighbouring portions of the Persian coast.' In 1902 measures were con certed with the Persian Governor-General of Mekran to prevent the importation of arms into Persian Baluchistan, and to impose restrictions on their possession in that province. A further Conference on the subject took place between the Persian officials on the Mekran border and the British frontier officers in 1906, and the desire to cope with the illegal traffic in arms was one of the reasons which led, in the same year, to the temporary appointment of Lieutenant G. D. Ogilvie as Vice-Consul at Bam. But the nature of the country is such that, once the consignments are landed and clear of the coast, it is virtually impossible to catch the caravans conveying them into the interior. This view is confirmed by the Report furnished by Lieutenant Ogilvie, who travelled through Persian Baluchistan in June 1906 on his way to take up his duties at Bam. He said that the local Persian authorities were quite incapable of dealing with the traffic, and that the Afghans employed in smuggling arms up country from the coast were invariably well armed, and could overcome any opposition offered to them with the greatest ease ; and he explained in a later Eeport that the communications in Baluchistan are so unspeakably bad that large caravans, when once they have left the coast, can travel without any fear of interference, even if such interference were contemplated by the authorities, and with the utmost secrecy.' It may he added that the Sirdars of Persian Baluchistan are not beyond the suspicion of having a pecuniary interest in the trade. As recently as November 1907 further measures were introduced by the Government of India, at the suggestion of Mr. New, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, for dealing with the arms traffic on the Mekran coast. These measures included the creation of a small corps of camel sowars to patrol the coast between Jask and13 Cbalibar, in order to collect information about the movements of Afghans, expected consign ments of arms, &amp;c., which they will communicate without delay to British ships engaged in the suppression of the trade. How far these measures will be successful remains to be seen. Eor the present the situation may be summarized in the words used by the Government of Government of India in their despatch of the India s letter of February 21,1907. ^Ist February, 1907. ' We regard it as certain,' they wrote, ' that effective action for the suppres sion of the arms trade cannot be taken by the Persian authorities. On the coast, the Belgian Customs officials are few in number, and although, perhaps, willing to give assistance for the suppression of the traffic, they have not the means at their disposal ically to take efficient measures to deal with the evil. Inland, as is well known, the Persian authorities are powerless outside the towns, and large caravans can travel by unfrequented routes without the slightest risk of interference.' 11.— Quarantine, (Communicated by the India Office.) A. ' The sanitary defence of the Persian Gulf,' wrote Dr. Theodore Thomson in his Report of the 12th July, 1906, ' has in the past received, and still continues to receive, considerable attention, not only in the interests of countries adjacent thereto, but also because it is maintained b y some authorities that cholera and plague are particularly likely to invade these regions by reason of their nearness to, and frequent commu nication with, India, and thence to extend over land to Europe. This view was voiced by M. Barr^re, one of the French Delegates at the International Sanitary Conference of 1897, when he classified the Persian Gulf, along with the Hed Sea, as the ' routes naturelles des maladies pestilentielles.' In relation with this aspect of the matter, the question of what measures should be adopted with a view to guarding against the suggested danger to Europe was discussed at the International Sanitary Conferences of 1891, 1897, [1226] E14 and 1903 ; and in each of the Conventions drawn np at these Conferences clauses were incorpo rated embodying measures intended to secure this end.' Stated briefly, the Kegulations framed under the Paris Convention of 1894, which had special reference to cholera, have in the main been a dead letter. The Regulations contemplated the establishment of a number of sanitary stations, under the control of the Turkish authorities, in the Persian Gulf, and the enforcement of quarantine against arrivals. The British Govern ment, in adhering to the Convention, refused to accept the Appendix containing the Persian Gulf Jlegulations, on the grounds (1) that the posts were unnecessary ; (2) that Turkey and Persia were too far off to maintain effective control; and (3) that the great expense entailed in establishing the ports would fall chiefly on British shipping, which formed 98 per cent, of the shipping in the Gulf. The scheme was not carried out. When plague appeared in India in 1896 the Constantinople Board of Health* discussed at great length and on repeated occasions the question of new ports and the regime to be applied in the Gulf ports. It was ultimately decided to establish a permanent port at Pao, and to repulse plague-infected ships from Bussorah. A Commission was sent to Pao to select a site, but nothing further was done, and Pao remained a sanitary office with no lazaret and no sanitary apparatus. In the Venice Sanitary Convention of 1897 pro vision was made simply for a sanitary station near Bussorah and another at or in the neighbour hood of the Island of Ormuz or of Kishm, near the entrance of the Gulf, these stations to be under the control of the Constantinople Board of Health. The establishment of the Ormuz * This is a body of international composition, Great Britain being represented on it by Dr. F. G. Clemow, Physician to Ilis Majesty's Embassy at Constantinople. Dr. Dickson, Dr. Clemow's predecessor. Physician to the British Embassy, thus described the Board in January 1898: 'Notwithstanding its nominal international character, the Board is in reality a Turkish Department, guided by the real or pretended will of the Sultan, and administered by its Turkish members '; and the British Government has always consistently maintained the view that the Board u is not independent of the Turkish Government, .... and that the Porte is responsible for all measures adopted on its advice.'station was to be subject to an agreement between Turkey and Persia. The Indian authorities objected to the proposed station at Ormuz on political grounds, holding that it would give the maritime control of the Persian Gulf to Turkey, and might become a means of harassing British shipping. The proposals were, however, accepted by the British Government, and Persia also ratified the Convention, subject to the reservation that the station at the entrance of the Gulf should be under the Persian flag and should have Persian guards. The provisions of the Venice Convention, in so far as they relate to the Persian Gulf, have remained, like those of the 1894 Convention, a dead letter. No lazaret was established at the entrance of the Gulf, and the Bussorah lazaret remained, to quote the words of Dr. Clemow, ' the sole and very imperfect quarantine station in those regions.' The Paris Sanitary Convention of 1903, which was ratified in April 1907, provides for the Bussorah station as before, and for a sanitary station at Ormuz, both to be under the control of the Constantinople Board of Health. The Convention was signed by the British Delegates, subject to reservations which, it was hoped, would result in the abandonment of the Ormuz scheme. These reservations were (1) that the establishment of the Ormuz station should be deferred until the Board of Health had been reformed in the manner provided by the Con vention ; (2) that nothing should be done to carry out the scheme until the Mixed Com mission, on which we with other European Powers are represented, should have unnnimouslu voted the necessary funds. Doubts were at the same time expressed by His Majesty's Govern ment, through the British Delegates, as to the necessity for a station near the entrance of the Gulf, which was not proved by the experience of recent years, and as to the suitability of Ormuz, with its unhealthy climate, as a site for the purpose proposed. The Persian Government made a further pro posal, in the form of a ' Declaration Addition- nelle ' to the Paris Convention, that the station at the mouth of the Gulf should be controlled by Persia, and should be placed on the Island of Henjam instead of Ormuz. In this connection Dr. Faivre was sent by the French Government in the early part of 1905 to16 the Persian Gulf, to ascertain and report whether the Island of Hen jam would or would not be more suitable as a site for a ' sentinel' station near the entrance of the Gulf than the Island of Ormuz. He reported in September 1905. Stated briefly, his recommendations, which went beyond the terms of his reference and dealt with the whole question of the sanitary defence of the Gulf, were as follows :— 1. That lazarets should be established at Hen jam and Fao, to be controlled respectively by the Persian Government and by the Constan tinople Board of Health ; and 2. That sanitary stations for purposes of ' observation ' should be erected at Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Bushire, and Mohammerah, under the control of the Persian Government, and at Bnssorah, Koweit, Bahrein, Debai, and Muscat, under the control of the Constantinople Board of Health. Dr. Faivre's Report did not reach His Majesty's Sir F. Bertie to Government until December 1906. In the mean- December '3, 1906. while, it had been decided in November 1905 that Dr. Theodore Thomson, of the Local Government Board, should visit the Persian Gulf on behalf of His Majesty's Government, and report ' on the Mr. Brodrick to sanitary requirements of those regions in respect, ^ not only of Persia, but also of Europe, as well as September 8,1905. on the question of the need of a sanitary station and the suitability of Ormuz, Henjam, or other sites for the purpose' The Government of India, who were consulted as to the proposal, agreed that it might be advantageous at any future discussions for the British Government to have at its disposal expert information indepen dent of that collected by Dr. Faivre, but expressed the earnest hope that 44 British opposition to ^® r r 0 a y m s of establishment of sanitary station will be uncom- November 6.1905. promisingly maintained.' It may here be noted that the objections of the British Government to the establishment of an international sanitary station in the Persian Gulf, as classified by the Foreign Office in April 1906, are (1) political, in so far as the station would introduce a certain amount of international control in a sphere of British influence; (2) commercial, as placing within the reach of other Powers a ready means of hampering and restricting the shipping trade with Bombay and Kurrachee, against which a17 fair pretext for quarantine can always he found, and through which the bulk of English as well as the whole of Indian trade with Persia; (3) sanitary, it being considered that the proposed station, far from acting as a check upon disease, would serve rather to spread that insalubrity which it would be destined to prevent, by sub jecting the crews and passengers on the vessels detained, the large majority of which would be British, to the dangers of a pernicious climate and unhealthy surroundings. Dr. Thomson left for India, on his way to the Gulf, in January 1906. His Report, which will be discussed hereafter, was submitted in the following July. The terms of the Persian ' Declaration Addi- tionnelle ' to the 1903 Convention (viz. (1) that the station to be established at the entrance of the Gulf in accordance with the Venice Con vention of 1897 should be under Persian, and not international, control; and (2) that it should be placed on the Island of Henjam, and not Ormuz) were communicated by the French Government to the British Ambassador at Paris in December 1905, with an intimation that the Persian proposals were favourably viewed by them. These proposals did not commend them selves to the Briti«h Government, partly on the ground that any such arrangement would defeat the object of the British reserves, viz., the post ponement of the scheme for a station at the entrance of the Gulf, and partly because they doubted the ability of the Persian authorities to provide the necessary funds for the purpose.* In regard to this latter point, Mr. Grant Duff, writing from Tehran on the 15th November, 1905, said that he did not think &lt;e there is the slightest prospect of the provisions of the Con vention, or any other sanitary measures, being carried out, except in those ports where the quarantine arrangements are under European control, so long as Persia remains under its present Government.' The French Government, however, continued to press the point, and in * In his despatch of the 27th April, 1906, to Sir F. Bertie. Sir E. Grey wrote: ' The unsatisfactory state of Persian finances makes its hard to believe that that country would be ready to incur the necessary expenditure, and it would seem clearly indicated that she is relying on outside assistance, and that the scheme may be said to have originated rather in St. Petersburgh than in Tehran.' [1226] . y18 support of the Persian proposals stated that Dr. Faivre (whose Report His Majesty's Govern ment had not yet seen) had pronounced in favour of Henjam, the island chosen by the Persian Government, as being a suitable position for the station, while, at the same time, they pointed out that it would be difficult for them to explain to Persia that one of the reasons for which Great Britain had decided not to accept the Persian proposal was the incapacity of the Persian Treasury to bear the expenses. It was also urged that, if the Persian offer were declined, Persia might refuse to ratify the Paris Conven tion or make her ratification conditional on reserves, which would cause still further delay in bringing the Convention into operation. At this stage of the discussion Dr. Thomson's Report reached the hands of His Majesty's Government in July 1906. Its general conclu sions were opposed to the creation of a sanitary station at the entrance to the Gulf (1) because it still remained to be proved that epidemics had been conveyed to Europe by that route; (2) because a sanitary station at that point would be infective, inasmuch as it would be evaded by native sailing craft, the most dangerous class of shipping; and (3) because no suitable position could be found for such a station, Henjam, though upon the whole the most suitable site in other respects, being open to serious objections on account of its climate, its inadequate water supply, and its lack of provisions. Dr. Thomson's own recommendations were summarized as follows at the close of his Report:— ' lu substance, therefore, the scheme best adapted, in the circumstances, to secnre a reasonable degree of protection to Europe and the minimum o^ interference with commercial interests in the Gult of Persia con sists in the perfecting of the present sanitary stations at Mohammerah and Bushire,* the establishment of a sanitary station at Kovveit, and the creation of a new station in place of that now existing at Bussorah. Sani tary defence of the Gulf based on these lines will afford a greater degree of protection to Europe against plague and cholera than would be secured by a ' sentinel station' near the entrance of the Gulf, combined with a terminal station at Bussorah, and will not impose on * Dr. Thomson further considered that there would 'be advantage to commerce in also fully equipping the sanitary station at Bunder Abbas.'r 19 shipping the unnecessary and prejudicial restrictions that would result from the latter scheme. ' If this view should meet with acceptance, I would urge that steps should bo taken to put the scheme I have suggested in operation with all possible speed. I view the alternative 'sentinel station' project with apprehension, as calculated to be ineffective, expensive, and gravely detrimental to commercial interests—and these are mainly British—in the Gulf. Abandonment of this 'sentinel station' project is much more likely to follow on knowledge that defensive measures, of the kind and at the places I have indicated, are in actual operation than on mere . announcement that such measures are in contemplation.' Dr. Thomson's views as to the ' sentinel station' were adopted by His Majesty's Govern ment, and the Erenqji Government were in formed that the Persian proposals were inaeeept- able, a decision which was in due course commu nicated to Persia and to the other parties to the Convention. Sir C. Spring-Rice si r Q. Spring-Pice at the end of 1906 ex- to Sir E. Grey, ,.-,-^.1 January l, 1907. plained the position to Dr. Schneider, President of the Tehran Sanitary Council, 0 who promised to do his best to prevent the question being again raised. Dr. Schneider observed, how ever, that it would greatly facilitate his task, should the matter be brought before the Sanitary Council, if the Government of India would consent to improve the conditions under which quarantine measures were at present carried out in the Gulf, i.e., by increasing the European personnel and by supplying disin fection stoves and rat-destroying apparatus at each of the five ports (viz., Mohammerah, Push ire, Lingah, Punder Abbas, and Jask), instead of at Pushire only. Dr. Schneider added that the Persian Government had not the neces sary funds at their disposal, and that the expense would necessarily fall on the Indian Govern ment. P. It will be convenient at this stage to give a brief account of the quarantine system hitherto administered in the Persian Gulf by officers of * This body was instituted by the Shah iu 1904 as a result of the cholera panic. It comprises the European physicians of the Shah as well as several Legation physicians and Persian doctors. Its functions are purely advisory, and it has neither funds nor executive of any sort under its control.the Indian Government. In Septsmber 1904 Major Cox, after examining the old records Major Cox to regarding the sanitary control in the Persian o^Indk^ ^ Gulf, reported that 'since 1S64, and probably September 5,1904. before, it has been entirely in our hands ; but our control seems to have come into existence auto matically, and I can trace no original arrange ments with the Persian Government.' The appearance of plague at Bombay in the autumn of 1896 rendered it imperative to adopt quaran tine precautions in the Gulf. The resources of Persian Gulf the Persian Government were unequal to the AdmiSation inauguration of adequate measures, and the task Report, 1896-97. was, with the consent and at the desire of the Persian Government, undertaken by the British Residency at Bushire. After some difficulty, quarantine was placed on satisfactory and efficient footing at Bunder Abbas, Lingah, and Moham- merah, for which the services of assistant surgeons were lent by the Government of India, as well as at Bushire. In August 1903 the Government of India Viceroy's reported that three assistant surgeons were em- Au^st^^aud 20 ployed exclusively on quarantine duties at 1903 - Mohammerah, Bunder Abbas, and Lingah, while at Bushire and Jask the duty was done by the assistant surgeons attached to the Residency and the telegraph station respectively. The cost of the quarantine establishment at the first three ports, estimated at 1,480 rupees a-month (1,184/. per annum) was borne by the Persian Govern ment, while a charge of about 340 rupees a-month (272/. per annum) fell upon Indian revenues in respect of the quarantine duties discharged by the doctors at Jask and Bushire. The assistant Colonel Kemball surgeons were placed under the immediate orders ^ nment of the Residency Surgeon at Bushire, who was in February 3,1904 the executive charge of the quarantine arrange ments. Financially, control was vested in the Customs Administration, to whom all fees were made over by the quarantine officials. Attempts have from time to time been made to undermine the position of the British Quarantine Administration. On the 6th August, 1903, Sir A. Hardinge Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed that the Russians LatSwne, were pressing the Persian Government to take August 6,1903. the Gulf quarantine arrangements out of the hands of the British doctors and to place them under the Belgian Customs Department. Six da} s later the Government of India telegraphed Viceroy's telegram that they had 44 positive proof ' that the Persian i9 0 ^ ugust 12 '21 Government intended to carry out tliis suggestion, and recommended that the ' strongest protest should be made against a change so injurious to British interests,' and that His Majesty's Govern ment should resolutely resist the ' principle that quarantine arrangements in the Gulf .can be subverted, without our knowledge or consent, or that a body of foreigners can be put in expressly to hamper British trade, the tonnage of which is over 90 per cent, of the total.' The Persian Government, on being approached by Sir A. Hardinge, disclaimed all intention of removing the British doctors ; but the British Minister was informed by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs that certain complaints against the manner in which they administered the quarantine 'had suggested to the Shah the idea that it might be advisable to establish some closer supervision over their work.' The question was again raised in February 1904 by Colonel Kemball's com plaints of interference by the Customs Depart ment in the executive work of the quarantine. Viceroy's telegram The Government of India recommended ' that a of March 19 1904. vigorous protest should at once be made against the disturbance of existing sanitary arrangements, but Sir A. Hardinge preferred to reserve any strong remonstrance until we were confronted with some definite act of encroachment bv the Persian * Government itself. Further interference on the part of the Customs authorities, coupled with the activity of M. Bussi^re, a doctor in the employ of the Customs Department, and attached to the French 'Vice-Consulate, and also, as subsequently appeared, to the Bussian Consulate, at Bushire, again raised the question in an acute form. Sir A. Hardinge to Bepresentations were made by Sir A. Hardinge Lord Lansdowne, . ^ September 8,1904. ^o the Persian Government and to M. jSaus, the Head of the Persian Customs, with the result that in September 1904 the Grand Vizier promised to send telegraphic orders to Bushire that the Custom-house officers should abstain from interfering in the quarantine administration of the Gulf ports. The actual text of the instructions sent to the Director- General of Customs, Bushire, was as follows : ' You are to abstain as far as possible from all interference with quarantine, llecom- mend this especially to Bussi&amp;re. At the same time, this does not deprive you of the right to report to Tehran any steps by the quarantine officials which may be prejudicial to the Persian [1226] G22 Government.' The Grand Vizier told Sir A. Hardinge at the same time that he proposed to reopen the question on M. Nans' return from leave. Nothing further was done, however, and the settlement of the case remained for the time being undisturbed. Arising out of these incidents, Sir A. Sir A.^IIardinge to Hardinge, in a despatch dated the 16th August, August 16,1904.' 190i, proposed that, in order to strengthen our position, the Government of India should decide '• (1) itself to pay the salaries of the Indian doctors in the Gulf ports; and (2) to depute for these duties European rather than, as at present, native Indian assistant sursreons.' The Govern- ^ iceroy's telegram 0 of Oct^'- 97 ment of India doubted the advantage of raising 1904. the former point, unless it was pressed by the Persian Government; they considered, moreover, that the ' delegation of quarantine functions to British-paid officials seems to involve greater derogation from Shah's dignity than employment of British officers paid by Persian Government.' The latter recommendation, however, was accepted, and the Government of India telegraphed, on the 31st December, 1904, that steps were being taken to provide ' suitable Europeans to replace the present assistant surgeons at Mohammerah and Bunder Abbas as soon as possible,' and that it was also proposed ' to carry out a like change at other ports in the Persian Gulf if suitable men can be obtained.' In ' March 1905 the Government of India were able to report that the necessary measures had been taken in regard to Mohammerah and Bunder Abbas, and that arrangements were being made for similar action in respect of the other ports. During the year 1906 the question was again to the front. In the middle of September the Darya Begi, Governor of the Persian Gulf, wrote to the Ilesidency Surgeon at Bushire, in his capacity as Chief Quarantine Officer for the Persian Gulf, informing. him that the Persian Government would require the Persian flag, as well as the quarantine flag, to be flown, not only on all boats employed in quarantine work, but also on all ships undergoing quarantine in Persian ports. This step was believed to be the outcome of the action of the Bussian Consul-General, who had informed the Darya Begi that Bussian vessels would, in future, recognize no quarantine authority unless covered by the Persian flag, and that no correspondence would be carried on with23 the quarantine authorities in English, but only in Persian or Erench. A similar communication was made bv the German Consul. Negotiations * o took place between the British Legation and the Persian Government, with the result that the latter tacitly dropped the requirement that ships in quarantine should fly the Persian flag, on finding that it was contrary to the general practice in other countries. They showed a disposition, however, to maintain their attitude as regards the flying of the Persian flag by boats engaged in quarantine duties. In December 1906 the Husssian ship ' Trouvor ' refused, on the advice of the Russian Consulate, to admit the quarantine officer on board at Bunder Abbas to carry out the inspection laid down by the Venice Convention. The same thing occurred at Lingah, but at Bushire the Trouvor' fulfilled the usual formalities. The Bussian Minister at Tehran at first attempted to argue that the conduct of M. Ovseenko, the Russian Consul at Bunder Abbas, was perfectly correct, but he finally agreed to send a telegram to M. Ovseenko enjoining a general compliance with the quarantine rules. Eventually, it w r as settled between the British and Russian Ministers that the question should be disposed of by the Tehran Sanitary Council, and on her return to Bunder Abbas the ' Trouvor' accepted the inspection of the Sanitary Officer. Eurther instances of interference on the part of M. Ovseenko occurred in March 1907 in connection with the British steamer ' Madura ' and the Russian steamer 44 Euphrates.' C. In his despatch of the 1st January, 1907, reporting conversations with the President of the Tehran Sanitary Council, the British Sir C. Spring-Rice Minister at Tehran (Sir C. Spring-Rice) January 1^1907. recommended that Dr. Schneider's suggestions for the increase of the European personnel and the improvement of the apparatus of the quarantine stations in the Gulf should be sub mitted to the Government of India for their con sideration. These proposals, it may be noted, went somewhat beyond those made by Dr. Theodore Thomson in his Report of 12th July, 1906, inasmuch as Dr. Schneider contemplated im provements at all five of the Gulf ports, whereas24 Dr. Thomson's recommendations, so far as the coast of Persia was concerned,* were limited to perfecting the existing sanitary stations at Mohammerah and Bushire, and possibly im- proving the station at Bunder A.bbas. The Government of India, in a telegram dated the 6th February, 1907, expressed their agree ment with Dr. Thomson's recommendations, and their willingness ' to bear, for the present, the cost of necessary preliminary measures, including supply of disaffecting apparatus at Gulf ports, reserving right of subsequent recovery from the Persian Government in case of Persian ports, and subject, in the case of Koweit, to acquiescence of Sheikh in proposed arrangement.' In April 1907 the British Minister at Tehran telegraphed that o i an attack might shortly be anticipated upon our control of the quarantine in Southern Persia, and that he trusted that steps would be taken to secure the maintenance of existing arrange ments. He subsequently explained that his apprehensions were based upon (1) the impend ing retirement of the President of the Tehran Sanitary Council, who was friendly to British interests, and the possibility of his being replaced by some one hostile; and (2) the frank hostility shown towards our quarantine officers both by the Russian Consul at Bunder Abbas and by the Belgian Customs officials. Sir C. Spring-llice recommended, in addition to the improvements of the sanitary service on the lines indicated in his despatch of the 1st January, that a com munication should be made to the Bussian Government to the effect that, in view (1) of the predominance of British trade and shipping; (2) of the impossibility of securing an efficient Persian service; and (3) of the necessity for good administration. His Majesty's Government expected that the Bussian Government would offer no objection to the continuance of the present system. His Majesty's Government decided to postpone making any representations to the Bussian Government until the estimates of the cost of the proposed improvements had been received from the Government of India. The outbreak of plague at Bahrein in April 1907 brought into notice the deficiency in the disinfecting equipment of the southern ports, * Dr. Thomson algo proposed the establishment of a station at Koweit, on the Arabian side of the Gulf.and lent additional urgency to the question of improving the sanitary defence of the Gulf. w's?' | P G r n ey Rice With a despatch dated the 19th May, 1907, May 19, 1907. Sir C. Spring-Eice transmitted a Memorandum by Dr. Schneider, President of the Tehran Sanitary Council, on the measures he recommended for the improvement of the quarantine service. These measures included the appointment of commissioned officers of the medical service to all five ports, and the provision of a stove and Clayton apparatus (for destroying rats, &amp;c.), as Sir ^P* 5 p ^ ing ' Rlce well as a reserve stove, at Bushire. Sir C. Sprinjc- to Sir E. Grey, . ' in May 30,1907. Eice added, in a telegram dated the 30th May, that the Sanitary Council, while strongly approving the measures proposed, did not possess the necessary personnel, appliances, or funds to carry out the scheme, and would be very grateful for the assistance of the Government of India. Sir C. Spring-Ilice expressed himself strongly in favour of the proposed improvements being undertaken by the British Government, and in this view the Eoreign Office concurred, the following statement of policy being made in Mr. Mallet's letter of the 21st June, 1907:— FQmgn Offie 0 to During the eleven years in which the control India Office, c - June 21, 1907. of quarantine arrangements in the Gulf has been in British hands the Government of India have spent large sums on the service, which would be entirely lost if any change in the control were now to be made; and Sir E. Grey entirely agrees with His Majesty's Minister in considering it of great importance, both politically and commer cially, to endeavour to maintain the status quo by improving the efficiency of the medical service.' Sir C. Spring-Rice In July 1907 the Sanitary Council reported in Jul? idol ' favour of an extended scheme of improvement, including sanitary stations at Bunder Abbas, Bushire, Mohammerah, Jask, and Lingah, with a mobile service under a European doctor. The Russian Bepresentative on the Council proposed that the sanitary service should be in ' strict collaboration with the Customs,' who should use the five small steamers they had recently ac quired ; he also desired the appointment of the French doctor of the Russian Consulate at Bushire as Inspector-General. Representations were made to the Russian Government on the 24th July, in which it was pointed out that His Majesty's Government considered ' the present quarantine arrangements as one of their [1226] H26 special interests in the Persian Gulf and a part of the status (juo' On the 27th July the Russian Minister at Tehran assured Sir C. Spring-Uice that the proposal of the Russian doctor had been made without his knowledge, and that care would be taken to prevent the recurrence of a similar incident. On the 7th November, 1907, the following Mr. Morley to measures were actually sanctioned by His ^ f 0 j®™ ; J Qent Majesty's Government: — November 7,1907. 1. The provision of four stoves at Jask, Bunder Abbas, Lingah, and Mohammerah, under the charge of the present assistant surgeons; and of one stove at Bahrein under a military assistant surgeon, to be appointed on a salary of 208/. per annum. The initial cost of the five stoves was estimated at 1,250/., and the annual recurring expenditure on them at about 333/. 2. The provision of a Clayton apparatus at Bushire, at an initial cost of 1,000/. 3. The appointment of a mobile assistant, of the Indian Medical Service, at Bushire, at a cost of 560/. per annum. The total estimated cost w T as : 2,250/. initial; 1,100/. recurring. On the 4th January, 1908, the purchase of a portable stove for the mobile assistant w r as sanctioned, at a maximum cost of 40/. The w r hole of this expenditure is to be shared equally between the Indian and Imperial Ex chequers. The sanctioned strength of the Quarantine Establishment in the Persian Gulf thus w^orks out as follows :— At Bushire. Paid hy the British Government— One Residency surgeon (in executive charge of the Quarantine Service). One mobile assistant (of the Indian Medical Service). One assistant surgeon (in sub-charge of Residency dispensary, stove, &amp;c.).

Bahrein was declared free of plague in the following July. « £ Government of India's letter of March 31, 1904. III.— Question of British Consular Representation in El Hasa and Katif. (Communicated by the India Oflice.) The question of British Consular representation in El Ilasa and Katif was raised by the Govern ment of India in 1904. In a despatch dated the 31st March of that year, Lord Curzon's Govern ment represented that the Indian merchants of Bahrein, trading with the mainland, were subjected to many vexatious restrictions by the Turkish Customs farmer, and that official regulations at the Katif Custom-house had been so used as to destroy the British trade previously established at that place. It was pointed out, in illustration, that the Bania community of Katif had, in 1900, been reduced from one of 70 or 80 persons to a single trader, and, further, that those still desirous of carrying on trade at the port had, in the same year, expressed their willingness to pay, in advance, the cost of main taining a British Agent to protect their interests on the spot. This request, it was added, was repeated during Lord Curzon's visit to the Persian Gulf in 1903,f when the British Indian merchants of Bahrein petitioned his Excellency for the appointment of a British Ilepresentative to protect their interests at Katif. The Govern ment of India accordingly recommended (1) that the Political Agent at Bahrein should be * At Jask the quarantine duties are discharged by the assistant surgeon attached to the Eastern Telegraph Depart ment station. lie receives a special local allowance for the purpose. f It was again repeated to Major Cox in July 1904, the merchants offering to pay a fee equivalent to 2,000 rupees per annum towards the cost of the appointment.28 appointed Vice-Consul for El Hasa, and (2) that a .Native Consular Agent should be stationed at Katif. Sir Is x . O'Conor, who was consulted, thought ? ir J - r 0 Conor to ' 0 Lord Lansdowne, that these suggestions should not be pressed for June 28,1904. the moment, and his view was accepted by His Majesty's Government. In commuoicating this decision to the Government of India, Mr. Brodrick wrote as follows, in a despatch dated the 5th August, 1904 : ' It will be seen that Mr. Brodrick to His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, o^India? 6 ^ . . . . , having regard to the interpretation Au g' u st 5,1904. which the Turkish Government might place on the appointment of a Consular officer for El Hasa, and to the objection they would feel, at present, to recognizing such an officer, does not consider it advisable that effect should be given to the suggestion that the Political Officer at Bahrein should be invested with Vice-Consular jurisdiction over the Turkish district of El Hasa. Eor similar reasons, Sir 1$. O'Conor is of opinion that the present moment is unsuited for appoint ing a Native Consular Agent at Katif, and he suggests that the consideration of this proposal should be deferred till the result is seen of the representations which he has addressed to the Turkish Government in regard to the grievances of the Indian traders, which formed the subject of the Government of India's letter of the 31st March, 1904. These views are approved by His Majesty's Government.' In September 1904, the British Consul at Mr. Townley to Bussorah reported that the necessary instructions Xn^mber 22^ had been sent to the Mutessarif of Hasa 190 ^ regarding the abatement of the excess duties at Katif, of which British Indians had complained ; and Mr. Brodrick informed the Government of Mr. Brodrick to India, on the 20th December, 1904, that he had o^Ind^™ 61 ^ intimated to the Foreign Office that, ' if practical ^yQ^ mber 20 ' effect is given to these orders, it will be unnecessary to press for the appointment of a Consular Agent at Katif.' The question has not subsequently been raised.29 IV.— Mohammerah. Mr. Spring-Rice, No. 15, March 20, 1900. * r r * A Sheikh Khazal is the acknowledged Head of the Muhaisen tribe of the Chaab Arabs, living on both sides of the Karun, from near Shuster to its junction with the Shat-el-Arab near Mobammerah, and on the left bank of the Shat-el-Arab from Mohammerah to its mouth, and between the Tigris and the Shat-el-Arab to the west, and to the Jerrish River on the east. As regards the Persian Government, the position of the Sheikh, who murdered his brother. Sheikh Mizal, in 1897, has always been that of a great feudal Prince, who in smaller matters has thought it well to humour the Central Govern ment while remaining at the same time extremely jealous in matters touching his quasi-indepen- dence. His attitude to British interests has been friendly, and in striking contrast to that of the Persian officials in South-west Persia. Ever since 189S the Sheikh has shown himself nervous about his position in the event of the break-up of the Persian Empire, and anxious to obtain guarantees regarding the independence of his territories in certain eventualities. In November 1899, whep Sir M. Durand visited the Karun, the Sheikh made a request for assurances. While declining to afford guarantees of the nature desired. Sir M. Durand intimated to him that ' he might rely upon our help whenever we could give it without ill-faith to the Persian Government.' The intention formed by the Central Govern ment in 1900 to include Mohammerah in the newly-organized Customs system increased the anxietv of the Sheikh to obtain some kind of guarantee, the more so, since rumours were prevalent that the contemplated changes would be used as a pretext for putting an end to his power as that of the last of the great feudal Chiefs of Persia. Fears were also entertained that if the Sheikh were forcibly to resist any such attempts the Persian Government would retaliate by their favourite method of intrigue, and endeavour to create dissension in the Chaab tribe by setting up the nephew of Sheikh Khazal, Sheikh Aboua, who resided at Ahwaz, and was not on the most cordial terms with his uncle. [1226] I ,30 In March 1900 a Memorandum was commu nicated to the Persian Government by Iler Majesty's Charge d'Affaires. In this paper it was stated that the British Mr. Spring-Rice, Consul-General at Bushire had recently called March 27,1900. Lord Salisbury's attention to the state of aiMrs at Mohammerah. In order to avoid difficulties in the future his Lordship thought it best that there should be a clear understanding of his views as to the ports of Mohammerah, Bushire, and Bunder Abbas, and other ports of the Gulf. The control of these ports by a foreign Power might lead to a state of things which Her Majesty's Government, in the interests of the Indian Empire, would be bound to resist. This had been recognized by the Persian Government, who, on the 23rd October, 1897, gave a written promise that the customs of Southern Persia should never be placed under foreign control and supervision. Her Majesty's Government must hold the Persian Government to the strict observance of this engagement. As the Persian Government were aware, far the larger part of the trade of the above- mentioned ports was British. This trade imposed certain duties upon Her Majesty's Government, and they could not pass without notice any measure likely to effect its position and prospects. It was from this point of view that the Marquess of Salisbury desired to inform the Persian Government that, in view of British interests in the trade of Mohammerah and in the navigation of the Karun, Iler Majesty's Government must insist upon their right to be consulted before any change were made in the administration of the customs or in the position ot the Sheikh. In claiming such a right oi consultation, the Persian Government could have no doubt as to the anxiety of the British Government for the preservation of order, the maintenance of the Persian sovereignty, and the improvement of Persian resources. In all these the interests of Her Majesty's Government were second only to those of Persia herself. The reply of the Persian Government was verbal:— ' Not only in Mohammerah, but in every part Mr. Spring-Rice, of Persia where British interests were concerned, ApriU, 1900. the Persian Government, before taking any steps of importance, would consult the British Govern-(9 ' 31 ment, but Persia could not give a definite Agree ment with regard to a special point of lier territory, as such an Agreement might appear to others like a consent to partition.' On the 10th May, 1900, Lord Salisbury addressed a despatch to Her Majesty's Charg6 d'Affaires at Tehran, in which he wrote as follows :— 'You should take any opportunity that may offer itself to explain that Her Majesty's Government have no desire to diminish, but rather seek to uphold and confirm, the authority of the Persian Government in the southern provinces, and that it is in the interest of Persia, as well as of Great Britain, that they endeavour to prevent the intrusion of other Powers.' Sir A. Ilardinge, No. 118, July 28, 1901. The annexed extracts from a despatch, dated July 1901, from His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, show in some detail how the question of giving a British assurance to the Sheikh arose :— ' The Sheikh is evidently nervous about the designs of the Persian Government, and looks to us for assistance and protection. ' If a Russian Consul-General should come to Bushire the Sheikh may, should such support be withheld by us, be tempted to coquet with him, or at any rate to modify to some extent the friendly relations which he has hitherto cultivated with the British Resident at Bushire. ' It is undoubtedly important that he should continue to be our friend and to be guided by our advice, and I am therefore anxious to be able to give him such assurances of support as will prevent him looking for help elsewhere. ' I shall visit him in the course of the tour to the Persian Gulf ports which I hope to undertake next October, and I should be grateful if your Lordship would instruct me as to the language which I should hold to him in reply to the questions which he will almost certainly put to me in regard to possible diffi culties between himself and the Persian Government. ' My idea is that we should endeavour to persuade him to come to a fair arrangement with the Persian Customs, as it is impossible that M. Naus, in reor ganizing that service, can allow so important a port as Mohammerah to remain beyond his control, but that we should, in view of possible Russian activity in Southern I ersia, attach him to ourselves by a promise that we will not let his political authority over his tribesmen be destroyed or undermined by the Persian Government. ' I am fully aware of the difficulty of supporting [1226] Klocal quasi-hereditary Chiefs who are subjects of the Shah against endeavours by the Persian Government to weaken their positions and extend the power of the Central Government at their expense. Seistan is a case in point. ' At the same time, our neglect or reluctance to do this may be taken advantage of to the detriment of our interests by our rivals, and it is clear that Colonel Kemball thinks that some definite assurance of assist ance in certain contingencies should be given to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. ' 1 would propose to urge him to be loyal to the Persian Government, to come, with the help and, if necessary, mediation of His Majesty's Vice-Consul, to an arrangement with the Customs which would indemnify him for the loss of their administration by himself, and to trust to us to protect him against any attempt from Tehran—in my opinion, a very improbable one—to diminish or encroach upon his authority as Chief over his people. If we give him an assurance that Ave shall so protect him, we ought to be prepared, in the unlikely contingency of such an attempt as I have suggested, to send a gun-boat to Mohammerah and to let the Persians know that we shall not acquiesce without good reason to the deposition of the Sheikh, or in interference by the Governor-General of Arabistan in the internal affairs of his tribe. ' Your Lordship can, of course, judge better than I to what extent the grant of such an assurance is in accordance with the general policy of His Majesty's Government in Southern Persia, and how far it would be wise and safe to give it. It is clear that the Sheikh is, perhaps, unnecessarily anxious about his future, though no doubt he is more or less trying to bluff us into giving him pledges of support; but I would venture to submit that the time has come foi- us to decide how far we are prepared to back him up, should the Persian Government, perhaps at Russian instigation, determine to destroy his, so to speak, autonomous position, and what counsel Colonel Kemball and I should give him should he appeal to us, as he seems disposed to do, for our advice.' The upshot of this correspondence was that Sir Sir A. Hardinge informed the Sheikh on the 7th December, 1902, under instructions from Lord Lansdowne, that ' we shall protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign Power, whatever pretext for such action may be alleged, and also, so long as you remain faithful to the Shah and act in accordance with our advice, shall continue to give you our good offices and support.' This assurance was really necessitated by the urgency of arriving at a solution of the question.33 Sir A. Hardinge, No. 65, April 7, 1904. Consul McDouall, No. 1, August 25, 1904. as Sir A. Ilardinge reported in March 1902 that the Russians had been making offers for over a year to reduce the Sheikh of Mohammerah to subjection hy force, and that they had been pressing the Persian Government to adopt towards him an uncompromising attitude. The assurance was actually given after an Arrange ment about the Customs had been concluded, largely owing to the Iriendly intervention of His Majesty's Government; but it was probably only in consequence of this assurance that the Sheikh consented to avoid friction and to make the new Arrangement work smoothly. On the 24th December, 1903, Sir A. Hardinge addressed a note to the Sheikh confirming the assurance of 1902, and adding that he might rest assured of the support of the British Government so long as he on his side observed the con ditions of the Arrangement made with the Persian Government. In 1904 a Russian decoration was conferred on the Sheikh and a Commercial Mission was sent to Mohammerah. One of the principal reasons for avoiding a conflict between the Persian Government and the Sheikh of Mohammerah has been the fear that such an event would raise the much larger question of the Turco-Persian frontier dispute. Mohammerah and the surrounding district have always been a bone of contention between the Turks and the Persians, and only recently the Sheikh expressed his apprehensions to His Majesty's Consul-General at Bushire in regard to recent developments at more northerly points of the frontier. The views of His Majesty's Government are explained in the subjoined despatches. s ' Sir Edward Grey to Mr. Marling. «(No. 21.) ' Sir, ' Foreign Office, February 25, 1908. ' I have received your despatch No. 17 of the 28th ultimo, in which you forward telegraphic correspon dence with His Majesty's Consul-General at Bushire relative to the apprehensions of the Sheikh of Moham- merah in regard to recent developments on the Turco- Persian frontier. ' I concur in your opinion that a gun-boat need not be sent to the Shat-el-Arab under existing conditions, and I consider that when an attack appears more imminent the precise action to be taken by His Majesty's Government can be determined.' It would, however, be advirable, in order to allay the Sheikh's apprehensions, to inform him that His Majesty's Government are fully alive to the situation, but that they do not anticipate Turkish aggression in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, and you should instruct Major Cox accordingly.' ' Sir Edward Grey to Sir N. 0'Conor. ' (No. 75.) ' Sir, ' Foreign Office, February 25, 1908. ' I transmit to your Excellency herewith a copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran relative to the apprehensions of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in regard to recent developments on the Turcc-Persian frontier. 'As you are aware, His Majesty's Government have been content to allow the Russian Government, as being more closely concerned, to take the lead in regard to making any proposals for arresting the Turkish encroachments so long as they are confined to the northern portion of the frontier ; but it is desirable that your Excellency should clearly understand that the position would be materially altered if there were to be an advance of Ottoman troops to the south, more especially in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. In this district His Majesty's Government are not prepared to recognize any other frontier than that laid down by the mediating Commissioners in 1850, as indicated in red on the accompanying sketch map; and in this connection I may recall the admission made by the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs to Her Majesty's Ambassador on the 18th November, 1893, to the effect that ' the Turkish Government laid no claim whatever to Mohammerah.' ' Any disturbance of the status quo at Mohammerah would affect British interests, and might not impro bably lead to the active intervention of His Majesty's Government, who have given the Sheikh certain assurances in regard to his territory. 'Your Excellency should accordingly instruct H'S Majesty's Consuls at Bagdad and Bussorah to furnish by telegraph early information of any aggressive designs in the district in question.' In January 190S the British Consul-General Ma Office, February 25, at Bush ire reported that the Sheikh was anxious that His Majesty's Government should guarantee himself and his own family as heirs in the enjoyment of their present position. Sir E. Grey considered that it would be advisable to maintain an attitude of reserve on this subject.
