Sir, with reference to Foreign Office letter No. LD177/208/405 of the oOth August last, I am directed hy Viscount Halifax to transmit to you herewith, for the information of the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names, a further list of place names in Iran which have recently “been shanged. 2. These names were taken from an official Iranian publication containing many other names which His Majesty's Legation at Tehran have heen unable to trace on the maps, hut none of these plaoes are of any importance. Two of the names on the present list, Nos. 5 and 6 (Arablang, Arab Oghlu), were included in the Foreign Office letter mentioned above but have been repeated for the sake of completeness, since the list contains a large number of places in the same district of Saq_qiz (Iranian Kurdistan), and gives additional details of longitude and latitude. 5. I am to aad that items No. 5 to the end on the enclosed list are all small villages or settlements in Kuraish districts. Great trouble was experienced by His Majesty's Legation in locating many of these places on the maps, owing to their insignificance and to the fact that Kurdish names are liable to frequent recurrence, and to numerous local variations in pronunciation, which partly/ The becretary, permanent Committee on Geographical Names, C/o Royal Geographical Society, Kensington Gore, S.w.7.partly acoount for the different spellings quoted from the Degree Sheets. 4. For the reasons set forth in the preceding paragraph His Majesty’s Legation are now doubtful as to the exact location of Altun Sufla, Altun Ulia and Bash Bulaq, which were mentioned in one of the lists enclosed in Foreign Office letter Ho. L 5177/268/405 of the 30th August. All are names which are likely to recur in Horth west Iran, and though Altun Sufla and Altun Ulia, according to Sheet l L, would he just outside Saq.qiz, they were not included under the heading n District of Saq.q.iz” in the Iranian official publication referred to in the first paragraph of this letter. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran advises that if any of these three names are incorporated in any new editions of maps, they should be included under reserve. 5. Sir Reader Bullard has also suggested that in view of the uncertainty of many of these geographical locations, and the additional consideration that especially in remote regions and in smaller townships, the old names die very hard amongst the inhabitants in spite of official pronouncements, it would be preferable, where new names are introduced into published maps, to retain the old names in parenthesis. 6 . An error has been discovered in the list which was communicated to you under cover of Foreign Oil ice letter Ho. L 1828/268/405 of the 29th March last. In this list the new name of item 12 should read u Salad , not ’'Sarlad 1 '. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant $Sd.) S.

Sir, With reference to Foreign Office letter No. L 1828/268/405 of the 29th March last, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to transmit to you herewith, for the information of the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names, two further lists of place names in Iran which have recently been changed. 2 . I am to invite attention to the fact that the first five place names, given in the second enclosure to this letter have already been notified to you in Foreign Office letter No. E 2589/216/34 of the 3rd May last; it is thought, however, that the names now furnished are more correctly spelt. 3. I am to take this opportunity of mentioning the difficulties which are encountered by His Majesty's Legation at Tehran In dealing with changes in place names. The authoritative source of these new names is the Ministry of Justice Gazette, which never prints more than a bald list of the old and the new names, sometimes, but not always, with a heading of the district or' province to which they refer. As the Gazette never gives a topographical or map reference to places, His Majesty's Legation The Secretary, Permanent Committee on Geographical Names, c/o Royal Geographical Society, Kensington Gore, S.W.7.Legation have great difficulty in locating them, the task being further complicated by incorrect spellings adopted in the Indian Degree Sheets. His Majesty s Legation have explained that the practice which they are now adopting is to give fairly strict transliteration of the original script in their reports to this department, adding in brackets the version on the map if necessary. 4 , His Majesty's Minister at Tehran has also reported that a circular of the Ministry of Justice dated the 15th February 1939 notified the change of the name of a tribe described as Yarahmadzai into Shahnavaz (meaning loyal to the King). The name Yarahmadzai cannot be traced, and in the opinion of His Majesty's Minister is probably a mistake for Yarmuhammadzai, which is frequently abbreviated, in writing, into Yarmohdzai. 5 , A similar notice published on the 23rd February notified the change of name of the Ismailzai tribe into Shahbakheh (meaning pardoned by the King).

My Lorrt, With reference to my despatch No# 186 of the 20 th May, 1937, I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordshi herewith a list of places in Iran the names of which have recently been changed. 2. The geographical position of each place is indicated by reference to the million sheet and square of the Government of India Survey map on which it is to be found. This system appears to be simp] ar than the indication of the exact latitude and longitude, and I trust that it has Your Lordship’s approval. 3. Many of the places at which there are now railway stations have been assigned new names. But as the great majority of these are only small villages, and are not to be found on any map yet published, I have included only the more important ones in the enclosed list# 4. In some instances it is difficult to see any reason for the allotment of new names, other than a desire for change for its own sake. The following motives may, however, account for a number of cases: (a) The desire to substitute pure Persian for Arabic or Turkish names. The new names are often, but not always, translations of those which they replace. (*) The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G. G.C.3.I., G.C.1.3., etc. , etc. , etc. &gt;4. — —- • 1The wish to eliminate place-names connected with persons who previously had. strong local influence (e.g* Khaz'alahad and Khaz T alieh, hoth situated in the onetime domains of the late Shaikh Khaz’al).

Sir, I haYe had under consideration your deapatch tio. 579 of 89th December, 1934, regarding the request of the Persian Sov^rnment that the terms 'Iran' and 'Iranian' shall be used by His Majesty’s Legation as from 8 lat March, both in conversation and in correspondence instead of the terms 'Persia' find 'Persian’. 2 . notwithstanding the inconvenient and somewhat unreasonable character of this request, I con»ji* : oi tii* t ,iis Majesty’s Government have no choice but to acquiesce in it, more especially in view of the fact that they have in the past not only acquiesced in numerous analogous changes elsewhere, but that they have themselves been responsible for changing th^ name 'Mesopotamia' to 'Iraq'. 3 , You are accordingly authorised to accede to the Persian Government’s request in the matter of ofticial ooixcs- pondecoe and conversation. At the same time you may. If you think it desirable, indicate to the Persian Ministry for joreign Affairs orally and unofficially some of the practical inconveniencet which may be caused if any attempt is made to apply the present measure too rapidly or rigidly. In particular their attention might be drawn to the fact that some time must necessarily elapse before the world in general grows accustomed to an innovation of this kind, more especially as the measure affects not so much the Persian name for the country as the name in com ;on usr in other languages. It could be pointed out that in the converse case Persian naroes for 1 uropean countries constantly differ from those used in the countries themselves, and that the : ersian Government no doubt would hotly resent any attempt by the European countries concerned H* M. £natchbuli-Hug&lt; son, Ssq., C.M.G. etc., etc., etc., Tehran.

As His Majesty's Government do not. however, wish to raise any objection to the proposed change, which in any ease Is not of great intrinsic Importance, you may thin* it preferable merely to acquiesce In the Persian Government's requirements with as good a grace as possible, limiting your comment to the purely practical consideration of urging that the change should not be imposed so rigidly and rapidly ae to interfere with the normal course of private and international ooramunloations. 4 . X entirely agree in your view that there can he no onestion whatever of changing the naaia of the peroian CriUi even in official correspondence; but, ae I am informed that the Persian name for the Gulf is 'Khali j-i-Kare' it is possible that th* Persian Governraent will not raise thio poim • I am, etc. v (for the Secretary of State) (Signed) G. ?i.

D.3528-N/35, Caroe of the Foreign Department referred to a Foreign Office despatch to Tehran in which it was decided by His Majesty’s Oovernment that there could be no question whatever of changing the name of Persian Gulf even in official correspondence in consequence of the Persian Government's request that we should use the terms w Iran w and 'Iranians' instead of 'Persia' and 'Persians', and he asked him to get Imperial Airways to avoid the use of the expression 'IranianGulf' in their publications, correspondence, etc. Walton has recently drawn our attention to the fact that in your Notice to Airmen No.3 of 1936, you use the vetoed expression in paragraph 12 , and he has asked me to suggest that you may like to know of Caroe's letter and put matters right at a suitable opportunity.

The authorities of the Imperial Persian Government, having on geographical, historical and eij^fhnological grounds found that the word Persia and its equivalents in other foreign languages is not an all-embracing word for the country of Iran, have, after due consideration of the case, decided to make efforts to have the word replaced by the country’s historically correct name ’♦Iran*. Ihe foreign Legations in Teheran have been notified of this decision, and requested to use the ^ord *Iran H in place of the word Persia and 'Iranir^n* in place of the word Persian. With a view to giving mcrinuucKk universal publicity to this request, the Imperial Government of Iran have instructed their representatives abroad to inform the Governments and the public institutions of the countries to which they are accredited of this decision, and request them to use the words '•Iran* and ^Iranian* whenever they have occasion to make references to the country of Iran and its people. The Government of Iran expects that the change will become universal not later than the 21st March, 1935 corresponding with the 1st forvardin, 1314 - the beginning of the Iranian New Year. I ii?

I have the honour to be with the highest consideration, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State' Mirza Hussein Khan Ala, C.k.G., ate., etc., et-.(E 1975/305/34) L No* 106 British Legation, Tehran Confidential; 6 th March, 1935 The Anglo-Persian Oil Company have naturally been studying with considerable care the implications of the request advanced by the Persian Government that the words ”Iran M and 'Iranian' should henceforth be substituted for 'Persia' and 'Persian.' The question has recently been under discussion between Mr. Gass, a representative of the London office of the Company who has just paid a visit of three weeks duration to Tehran, and the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, and Mr. Gass has informed a member of my staff, in confidence, of the outcome of his conversations 2. Mr. Gass said that he had made it clear that the Persian Government’s request raised endless difficulties and that the only result of an abrupt change in the Company’s title would be a considerable blow to their goodwill with a consequent loss of trade. In this the Persian Government held a direct financial interest, which was even greater than that of the shareholders, in that the former obtained a 5/6d royalty of five shillings and six pence on every ton sold whereas the potential loss to the latter was certainly not as much. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister of 3 Finance had seemed very much impressed by the above argument and the position was now as follows; In so far as their activities in Persia were concerned, the Company would /endeavour The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.3.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Officeendeavour to give effect as soon as possible to the wishes of the Government* Thus they were proposing to change their telegraphic address in this country from ’’Anglopers’' to M Angloiran M and they were further exploring the question of amending the Company^ title. As double registration was forbidden, a possible solution seemed to be to add a rider to the Company’s deed of registration to the effect that, consequent upon the decision of the Government, the Company would also be known within the country as the Anglo-Iran Oil Company Limited. It would naturally be necessary to take steps to prevent any other company from registering in the meanwhile under this title. Such a modification of title by the Company could only be contested in the Persian Courts and the Company felt confident that in the event of an action being brought against them the Courts would be bound to decide in their favour, since they would otherwise be failing to support the standpoint of the Government. 4. As regards any change in the title of the Company outside Persia, Mr. Gass had explained the lany considerations of a practical nature which precluded them from taking hasty action. Feroughi had seemed to appreciate that, apart from any question of loss of goodwill, there were numerous problems of a more or less technical order which would have to be faced, and he had pointed out that the desires of the Government had only been expressed in the form of a request by a Government department and did not possess legislative force. The Government had, therefore, full power to take note of any difficulties which might arise in particular cases and it was not in any event part of their wish to precipitate any form of crisis. The final suggestion which had emanated from the Persian side had been that if the Company would accept the idea of a change of /title(vy | title ae an ultimate goal* the Grovemraent would he content to let them introduce the necessary measures as and when they thought fit. 5. Mr. Gass, in informing Mr. Loxley of the above, made it clear that the only decision which had so far been reached had been to change the Company’s telegraphic address in Persia. The remaining points were still under consideration and Mr. Gass had received a telegram from the Board to say that they proposed to await his return before deciding anything further.

Our honourable officers ore aware of the fact that in most European languages, 'Iran* and ’Irani* are* in imitation of ancient Greek historians, named ’Perse 1 , •persone’, 'Persia*, 'Persian*, 'Persiene’ and 'Perese* , etcetera, whereas tin se terms are not consistent with the real meaning of the words ’Iran* and •Irani* for historical, geographical and racial reasons, etcetera, *rtiich will be giwen as follows:- 1, 'Pars* was the name of a section of the large country which at various epochs was in possession of the Persian Kings; but as the Greeks happened to come into contact with Persia at a time when Pars was the place of residence of the rulers of Persia, they called 'Iran* •Persia* and other European countries have followed their example and given us the same appellation with a slight change* 2* Iran geographically comprises all the vast area the whole of which or a part of which has at various epochs been included in the territory reigned over by Irani rulers; « we are therefore entitled to adopt the word 'Iran for our country* 3. From the racial standpoint, as Iran (Persia) was the birthplace and cradle of the Aryan race , it is natural that we should make use of this name, particularly today when some of the great countries of the warld are making claims for tte Ary* n race which are significant of the grandeur of the race and the civilization of the old Persia, and when certain nations are boasting of being of Aryan race. 4 Another4© Another point of great importance is the fact that whenever the word ’Peree 1 is spoken or writtent it immediately recalls to foreigners the weakness, ignorance, misery, lack of independence, disorderly conditions and incapacity which marked the last century of Persian history, whereas in view of the change in the situation of the country brought about under th5 care and guidance of His Imperial Majesty, and the progress achieved in recent years, it is fitUhg to abandon the term •Perse* tfhich always calls to mind past conditions, and to adopt the real name of the country, namely ’Iran*. For the above reasons, the Imp erial Legation in Berlin some time ago put forward a proposal asking for steps to be taken that in foreign speech and writing ’Iran* and *1 rani * should be used. Just as in Persian both orally and in writing we call our country •Iran* and our people •Irani*• This proposal, which was fully agreed to by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, was later carefully considered by the competent quarters with the support of this Ministry, and finally approved by the High Authorities of the country, who decided that it should be out into effect as from the 1st Farvardin 1314 (22nd March, 1935). The proposal was then communicated to the foreign Legations with the request that they should observe the point in conversation and correspondence; but as the words in question are used more in foreign lands, it is necessary that the honourable officials (Persian) should support the idea to the fullest possible extent and should make every effort to ensure its being put into practice. For instance, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs considers it advisable that: First,First, they should communicate the matter to the Government authorities of the countries where they reside, requesting them to call Persian Legations ’Irani Legations instead of ’Persian Legations' in future. Secondly, the paper and envelopes used by the Persian Legations and Consulates should be marked ’Iran’ instead of ’Persia’ , as from the 1st Farvardin. Thirdly, all officers should from now on, by writing articles in newspapers and holding conferences, etcetera, , enlighten public opinion in this matter and should carry on propaganda. Fourthly, the Ministry of Education and the authors of dictionaries and those drawing up maps, etcetera, should be advised of this change. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs expects to be informed of the results of the steps thst the Persian officials are to take in this matter.

[E 305/305/34 ] No. 1. Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Sir 'John Simon. — (Received January 14, 1935.) (No. 579.) , t ^ Tehran, December 29, 1934. ’ I HAVE the honour to transmit to you the accompanying translation of a circular which has been addressed to all diplomatic missions here by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the substance of which has also appeared in the press, requests that from the 21st March next the words k 1 Persia ' and ‘ ‘ Persian may no longer be employed and that in their stead the words Iran and Iranian be used both in conversation and correspondence. 2. The word “ Iran/’ as I understand it, means, in English, not the national unit which we call Persia, but either the geographical formation known as the “Iranian plateau” or the ethnographical entity comprised in the ‘‘ Iranian race or peoples of Aryan stock inhabiting a region which includes most of the Persian plateau (but not Khuzistan, which is Arab, nor Azerbaijan, which is large y Turanian) plus Afghanistan, part of the North-West Frontier District ot India and perhaps part of Russian Turkestan. Equally, the Iranian languages might be held to include Pushtu and perhaps Hindustani, whereas the language spoken by the inhabitants of this country is invariably called by them 1 larsi, the literal English translation of which is “ Persian.” 3. In one respect I welcome this circular, as it shows that the Persian Government themselves draw a distinction between their country of Iran and the “Persian Gulf.” I assume that, whatever reply you wish me to make to circular, you will in no case desire me to use the term Iranian Gulf, which would stultify the representations recently made to the I nited States ciqcernment as to the Senate's reservation to the Arms Traffic Convention, and which would indeed constitute an admission of Persian claims to the Gulf which could never i be tolerated. . • j ui 4. In other ways the new proposal, if adopted, may lead to considerable embarrassment. It can hardly be anticipated that the Anglo-1 ersian Oil Company will change its name; yet this may be expected of the company, unless it is to enjoy the privilege denied to foreign Governments of using the forbidden word “Persian.” , . 5. Again, much confusion would be caused if letters addressed to this country were to be inscribed “Iran owing to the likeness of that word to “ Iraq.” Many letters might never reach their destination. Moreover, it is not inconceivable that the Persian Government might issue instructions that letters not inscribed “ Iran shall not be admitted. I had a somewhat similar expeiience recently in the Baltic States in the case of letters addressed to Libau and not to the Latvian synonym “ Liepaja. I feel strongly that precautions should be taken at the outset to guard against this. 6 . I shall be grateful for your instructions regarding what attitude to adopt towards this request. On general grounds it seems impossible to do more than to agree to use the expressions ‘ 1 Iran and ‘ ‘ Iranian in official corres pondence with the Persian Government where they apply to purely Persian territory and not to the Persian Gulf. Even so, the proposal seems hardly practicable or reasonable, considering that it is not, as in the change from Christiana to Oslo, a case of a change of one name, but rather aspires to dictate as to the correct English form of a term which from the dawn of Western civilisation has always been rendered throughout Europe by some word equivalent to “Persia.” It is relevant to the matter that the English translation of “Deutschland” is “ Germany” and of “Hellas” “ Greece”; it is perhaps also relevant that the Persians call Greece “ Yunnan ” and Poland “ Lohistan.’ [315 o—6]2 - 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 96), and to the honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 208). I have, &amp;c. H. M. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN. Enclosure in No. 1. Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty's Legation, dated Dey 4, 1313 {December 25, 1934). (Translation.) Circular memorandum : AS the members of the Legation are aware, the words “ Iran and Irani are rendered in most foreign languages, following ancient Greek historians, by the words “Persia,” “Persian,” “ Persien,” “ Perser,” &amp;c. Nevertheless, these appellations, as is shown by historical, geographical and racial evidence, do not correspond with the real significance of the words “ Iran and “ Irani ; and the proper course is to translate “ mamlikat-i-Iran (“the country of Iran ) into the various foreign languages simply by “ Iran,' and to represent the word “ Iraniha” (“people of Iran ”) by “ Iraniens ” or the like in the other European languages. For this reason the authorities of the Imperial Government are proposing to remedy this etymological and historical inexactitude. Therefore, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs will be exceedingly obliged if, from the first day of Farvardin, 1314 (21st March, 1935), the Legation will cease to employ the words “ Perse ” and “ Persan ” in conversation and correspondence, and will emplov in their place the words “ Iran and “ Iraniens.’ (Seal of the Ministry.)(£ 505/305/34) hO» J.UC* WOKhim OFi’iOK, 8 .W.I. 19th FehruaiTt 1955. Sir, 1 have had under eonslderotlon your despatch lTo.579 of 29th December, 1934, recaraing the requeet of the Persian Government that the terns 'Iran* and 'Iranian** shall be used by His fradesty’s legation as frow 21et ru^rch, both in conversation and in correspondence instead of the terms 'Persia'* and ’'Persian**# 2 &lt;&gt; Hotwithetanding the inconvenient and somewhat unreasonable character of this request, I consider that His Majesty’s Government have no choice but to acquiesce in it, more especially in view of the fact that they have in the past not only acquiesced in numerous analogous changes elsewhere, but that they have themselves been responsible for changing the name ‘’♦.esopotamia 5 * to 'Iraq**# 3. You arc accordingly authorised to accede to the Persian Government’s request in the natter of official correspondence / and conversation. At the same time you may, if you thintc it desirable, indicate to the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs orally and unofficially some of the practical inconveniences which may be caused if any attempt is made to apply the present measure too rapidly or rigidly# In particular their attention might be drawn to the fact that some time must necessarily elapse before the world in general grows accustomed to an innovation of this kind, more especially as the measure affects not so much the Persian name for the country as the name in common use In other languages# It could be pointed out . Knatchbull-Hugesaen, Esq., C.M.G., etc . 9 etc. &gt; etc., Tehran.out that in the converse case Persian notes for European countries constantly differ from those used in the countries themselves # and that the Persian Government no douht would hotly resent any attempt by the European countries concerned to dictate to Persia what word should he used in Persian to describe those countries. It would he equally impracticable for Germany to insist on being called Pcutschlond* or for Greece to insist on being called Hollas* in Knglieh and French* and the procedure now adopted by Persia is therefore at complete variance with the attitude adopted in such matters by most civilised countries. As Ris lia^esty^G Government do not, however* wish to raise any objection to the propoeed change* which in any cose is not of great intrinsic importance* you may think it preferable merely to acquiesce in the Persian Government*a requirements with ao good a grace as possible* limiting your comment to the purely practical consideration of urging that the change should not be imposed so rigidly end mpidly as to interfere with the normal course of private and international communications. 4. I entirely agree in your view that there can be no question whatever of changing the name of the Persian Gulf even in official correspondence; but* as I am informc*d that the Persian name for the Gulf is ’*KhaliJ-i-Fars’* it is possible th the Persian Government will not raise this point.

What we are doing is simply to ask others to speak and write of us by our real name, by the name we have always used ourselves. Our action is not prompted by any insidious desire to lay claim to Afghanistan or any other land outside the boundaries of Persia. We want to remove the anomally of a country being known by foreigners as Persia when it really is called Iran. As for the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, they have long been known in Persia as “ Banke I Chahenchahi Iran ” and “ Sherkatd Nafte Englisva Iran.” No harm will be done to their prestige and importance if they are henceforth known abroad as the“Imperial Bank of /ran” and the “ Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Limited.” Yours faithfully, HUSSEIN ‘ALA (Persian Minister in London).

L 3433/41/405 of 5th July last regarding the changes in place names in Persia, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to state for the information of the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names that His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has been notified by the Persian Government that the name of Husseinabad in Pushti-Kuh has been changed and that in future it will be * called 'Shahr-i-Elam ( *Y. )”. As the result, however, of enquiries made by His Majesty’s Minister, it has become apparent that the ’’Shahr” is not part of the name so that the place ought to be shown as simply ,T Elam ( to point out that the only correct transliteration of the name is ,n Il4m', though you may prefer to retain 'Elam' as a conventional spelling, as the Persians consider it as perpetuating the name of the ancient kingdom of Elam. 2. As regards the geographical position of this town, I am to state that Husseinabad will not be found under that name on most maps but under that of Deh Bala which lies at about 46° 24 *E by 33° 37 1 ft• The new town of Elam is being built about two miles from the old.

With considerable difficulty we haveUt last extracted from the Ministry of the Interior the information you requested in your letter to us No. 34/368 of Feb ruary 18th. Persia is divided into the following provinces and vilayats in their order of priority as far as the Ministry of the Interior are concerned The Governorship of Tehran and province which comes among the central Departments of the Ministry : The Province of Azerbaijan ; The Province of Khurassan ; The Province of Ears ; and The Province of Kerman and Baluchistan ; the latter section is though for the present under a Military Governor but the. Ministry is planning to send an independent Governor there if and when normal conditions are re-established there ; The vilayats are in their order of precedence ; Isfahan ; Gilan and Tavalesh ; Burujerd and Lurestan ; Khuzestan ; Kermanshah ; Kurdestan ; South Persian Ports (with the Governor in Bushire) ; Mazanderan ; Astrabad ; Yezd ; Hamadan ; Sultanabad ; Khamseh (Zenjan) ; Kashan ; Malayer, Touyserkan and Nehavand ; Gulpayegan, Khunsar and Kamareh ; Kum and Khalajestan ; Shahrud ; Seman ; Garrus * and Saveh ; The Governor of Bunder Abbas comes under the vilayat of the South Persian Ports whose Governor is residing in Bushire; The Acting Oriental Secretary has added a few notes to this list which may be of interest ; A province, Persian “ lyalat ”, is governed by a “ Vali ”, i.e., a Governor- General ; A “ Vilayat ” is of a lower status and is governed by a “ Hakim ” or Governor ; Theoretically there are four classes of governors ; Smaller officials in charge of minor towns are called “ Naib-ul-Hukumah.

Sir, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a Circular memorandum from the Protocol Department ol the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that the name of Nusratahad, the chief town of Sistan, has Been changed to 'Zahul' and that of Duzdap- to ’’Zahidan”. 2 . These changes, which will necessitate a corresponding change in the Royal Commissions issued in future to consular officers at the two posts, are the result of a whim of the Shah, who recently visited Sistan for the first time. Zahul was the ■birthplace of the Rustam of Iranian legend, and is probably, though not certainly, identical with the town of Nusratabad. As for Zahidan, (which, if it means anything, means ’’Hermits”), I have heard no reasonable explanation of the change: before the coming of the railway Duzdap ,was an insignificant place, without historical associations. 3 . I am sending copies cf this despatch, with i^s enclosure to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, his Majesty’s High Commissioner for ’Iraq and to His Majesty’s Consular Officers in Persia.

THE Turco-Persian Frontier Commission has suspended work for the winter. The Persian representatives have returned to Tehran. It is understood that the Persian Government have agreed in principle to concede the area around Power Ararat to the Turks in return for some territory further south. At the same time the Government have forwarded to Angora certain counter-proposals m this connexion. Sirdar Intisar, chief Persian representative on the wmmission has reverted to his previous appointment of Governor of Bushire and the Gull Port j. General Salar Nizam Koupal has been relieved of his appointment as chiel of police, and General Fazlullah Khan, Zahidi, appointed in his place. Ihe latter was formerly chief of the Amnieh or road guards and later, when com manding the Gilan Brigade, fell into disgrace for selling sleepers which were tho property of the Shah. He was degraded but subsequently reinstated and allowed to proceed to Europe for his health, whence he returned a few months ago^ Yahya Khan, Qaragozlu, Itimad-ed-Dowleh, Minister of Education, has lett for England as the official Persian representative to the Persian Exhibition, which opens in London on the 6th January. . , v j j Sarhang Zia-ed-Din, Military Governor of Laristan, has been relieved and replaced by Sarhang Kazim Khan. 2.

Tamarine, Soviet commercial attach^ has left Tehran for Moscow. Afghan. —Sardar Sher Ahmad Khan has been appointed Afghan 3. The Majlis. The eighth Majlis was opened by the Shah on the 16th December. In his opening speech the Shah stated that diplomatic relations vath all foreign coun nes were satisfactory. He wished the Majlis to concentrate on economic matters, and stressed the importance of balancing the national budget and allowing no was ein public or official revenues. As in former speeches, the Shah drew attention to the importance of public morals, patriotism, devotion to duty and piety, both amongst the officials and the general public. It is understood that the present Gabine will remain in office during this session, although it is probable that two turther appointments will be made to relieve the two Ministers, who hold dual port!olios, of their extra duties. [336 i—1] i2 For the first month, before embarking on their two years’ term of duty, the members of the Majlis are employed on matters of internal organisation. Mirza Hussein Khan, Dadgar, has been appointed President. 4. Military. ♦V It is reported that the 2nd Regiment (Ahanin Regiment) of the 1st Infantry Brigade of the Central Garrison have returned to their heaquarters at Tehran after two years' detached duty in Luristan. 6. Naval A ff airs. Two Persian officers, Sultans Ibrahim and Salim Pio, are reported to have been sent to fetch from Germany the ship “ Chelcheleh,” which has recently been purchased by the Persian Government for 20,000 tomans. 6. Education. Ihe authorities of the American College in Tehran propose to extend their present educational facilities by establishing a local university. 7. Anglo Persian Oil Company. Workings in Southern Area. As a temporary measure it has been decided, chiefly on the grounds of economy to suspend operations in the Mishun area, whicn includes the points based on Ganowah; work will probably be resumed there next year. Work at Aghajari ceased some time ago, as it was purely a test area. Work at a/.anun is still in progress, but only on one well. These last two areas are small test areas based on Ahwaz. During the suspension of work in the Mishun area, wells are mudded up and can be reopened on very short notice. Surplus plant is being used at Haft Kel aild irk a Und ’ w ^. ere drilling is of greater importance at this moment. • “ e '^■ n ^ 0 ‘^ &gt;ers i an Od Company have just received permission from the Persian (government to send a geological party to examine the mountains in the neighbourhood of Kuh-i-Mund, Kuh-i-Nimak and Kuh-i-Dirang, and the party has already left Bushire on a tour of about three months’ duration 8.
