Dated Aden Residency, the 3rd June 1916. ■t- To — L. Robertson, Esq^/Secretary to the Grovemment of Bombay, Political Department. From a letter received from Sultan Abdul Kader, grandson of the Fadli Sultan, it appears that the Fadli Sultan is still in correspondence with Ali Saeed Pasha. He has suggested that 800 Turkish troops and two guns should be sent to him as protection against us in case we move against him on hearing that the Turks are in Abyan. Sheikh Saleh Mohsin Askar of the Mausatta reports that the Amir of Dala is causing considerable trouble to his people by raising contributions on them for himself and Ibn Naser Mokbil. A report from Sheikh Abdul Rehman bin Kasim, the Muflahi, says that the Turks are supposed to have made a temporary peace with us, due to fear inspired by the seaplanes. The writer warns us that this is merely a ruse, to enable Saeed Pasha to get the reinforcements he expects from Syria. Sheikh Saleh Mohsin Ali Askar gives us a rumour that Turkish troops are expected to come down from Mecca to the sea coast with war material. He gives it as hearsay only. The Abdali Sultan forwards us a letter from Saeed Pasha addressed to the Fadli Sultan. In his forwarding letter he states that the document referred to in Saeed Pasha’s letter is probably a treaty and points out that the Turks are probably anxious to execute treaties with Sheikhs and Sultans in our limits so as to strengthen their claims to a permanent occupancy. Later on the Abdali refers to the j loss he has suffered and the permanent loss he may suffer if the caravan routes are deflected from his territory. He requests us to keep him in our mind in the event of our making peace terms with the Turks prior to their evacuation of his country. The letter from Saeed Pasha to the Fadli is interesting as it clearly implies that Saeed Pasha had forwarded a treaty to the Sultan for signature; one copy was to be retained by the Sultan and two copies were to be returned to Saeed Pasha for transmission to Constantinople. Saeed Pasha upbraids the Sultan for having failed to return the documents and orders him to send two copies at once. In a postscript he adds that the Government (Turkish) are anxious to acquire some fields belonging to Ahl Haidara Mansur, which land is to be defined as belonging to the Sublime Turkish Government, and is to be called after Saeed Pasha. He also orders the Fadli to prevent the Ahl Foolesi from taking Jawlis and reeds into Aden. From a letter from Sheikh Abdul Rehman, A1 Muflahi, we learn that his brother Saleh Kaseim, who had gone over to the Turks, was killed in the last fight at Imad. The Sheikh expresses his joy at this.

Robertson, Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. Please see paragraph 7 of last week’s letter. Sheikh Abdul Rabb bin Badr of A1 Jof (Fadli) writes that one Ahmed am Maghrabi brought a message from Said Pasha asking him to go in and get a Turkish stipend, but that he replied to the messenger that he would not act treacherously towards th0 British Government; that after him came another emissary, one Husen bin Ahmed al Hammami, an Upper Aulaki Sheikh, with the same offer. Sheikh Abdul Rabb asks us to befriend the Fadli Sultan who, he says, is at heart friendly to the British Government in spite of hisvagaries. He adds “ Do not embitter your relations with Islam, for Moslems desire none but you. The Turks will not stay here for ever. It is only the British who lie not that will stay permanently.” 2. I gather the following from Saiyid Yahia al Makki, who is a wandering priest and friendly to the British Government. He left Mecca to see the Idrisi and his Minister Ba Sahi. He found their administration good. He then went to the Imam of San a, found there is a bitter enmity between the Idrisi and the Imam. He then journeyed to Juban, Nawa and Rubieten and found all the tribesmen friendly to the British Government. 3. The friendly Fulesi Sheikh Akil bin Said (Fadli) reports that Said Pasha is everywhere amicably arranging Arab differences a role winch he is able to assume with advantage to all concerned because his diplomacy is backed by force. 4 Early in April I visited the Abdali Sultan and pointed out to him that it was desirable that the Arab Chiefs should prove their friendship by something more than professions ; that it was their country that was invaded by the Turks and they should do something to defend their own country if they wished it to be regarded in future as belonging to them ; and that it would be very easy for them to boycott the lurks and to raid their communications. He then wrote round to all neighbouring rulers and many of the chiefs have replied professing their willingness to do something to injure the Turks but fearing reprisals. But it appears that the advice given is bearing fruit. Reports tend to show that the Turks are m difficu ties. The price of jowari and kerosine oil is excessive m Lake] and the Turkish officers are said to have gone to Said Pasha and told him that a year had passed without any actions on their part; and that he should either start fighting or evacuate the country and allow them to return to San’a as the soldiers cannot get sufficient food and that they are like a besieged party. It seems quite probable that their advice will shortly be followed. i r No. C.-520, dated Mien Residency, the 31st May (received the 8 th June) 1916. Endorsed by the Acting Political Resident, Aden.

He asks for ten shells “ which can blow up strong houses,” on the score that his enemies the Ahl al Jauf are at enmity with him and he would quell them. This man is pro-imam and pro-Turk and flies a Turkish flag. He is a Zeidi by religious persuasion. It is not proposed to interfere in tribal disputes. 3.

His Highness Sir Ghalib of Makalla writes and encloses a letter received from the two Jahwari and Hurebi Shaikhs of Upper Yafa now in Lahej. The letter is clearly inspired by Saiyid Pasha. It relates as usual the great victories everywhere won by Turkey and Germany, and says that the whole of our Hinterland is against us and our day is over. The Sultan will not reply to the invitation made him to come in to Lahej and join the army of “ Mujahidin. ” 2. The Sultan further reports that Saiyid Jafar Mihdar who has passed through Audhali and Aulaki tracts has reported to him that the Imam’s intention is to move ultimately towards Hadramaut, but his mind is not yet fully made up. Sir Ghalib asks for considerable grants of arms and ammunition to withstand any such contingency. Government have already been addressed, and certain stocks have been sent to Makalla. 3. Sir Ghalib further sends a letter addressed to him from the Audhali Sultan in which he says that his hills are too strong an obstacle to a Turkish or Imamic advance ; that the Turks in Lahej have addressed him, but he has refused to reply to their letters. 4. The Kotaibi Shaikh writes (as often before) that he still continues to dis regard all overtures from Lahej and he fears Turkish vengeance in consequence. 5. The Abdali Sultan wrote letters to all the stipendiaries in our Protectorate seeking to gauge their attitude in the event of a movement from Shaikh Othman. Many of the Shaikhs have replied with friendly letters stating that they will act when the time comes, but ask for arms and ammunition. 6. Our friend Saiyid Taha of Jabel Jihaf asks us to move against the rebellious people. As the Arabs have felt the tyranny of the Turks, he thinks, they will all surely co-operate with us if we move up. 7. Please see paragraph 4 of Weekly Letter, dated 22nd April 1916. The Fadli Sultan has written reiterating his friendliness towards us and asking us to send 4,000 men to safeguard his interests in Abyan against the Turks. I have told him that he will be given a chance later on to prove' his friendship. No. C.-496, dated Aden Residency, the 24th May (received the 1st June) 1916.

The Sultan of Shehr and Makalla writes that his minister has not yet returned from his expedition. The Ashraf are in receipt of letters from the Imam and from Lahej, and the- Kathiri is apparently involved. The Sultan says that he has deputed messengers to Marib to learn the news. He thinks that the Imam’s mind is bent on going to the Hadramout. He asks for rifles and ammunition and guns to secure his position. He is anxious to obtain more control over his subjects who are engaged in trade with Singapore and Java. 'With this object in view he has asked us to require the production of a pass issued by him from all traders passing through Aden from Makalla to these places. By gaining this power over them he will be able to prevent them from intriguing with the Kathiri.

Robertson, Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay. Kadi Atik bin Ahmed Bakir of Behan, an influential friend of the British Government, writes that he had to escape for his life to Wadi Markha between Behan and Upper Aulaki country, owing to the conspiracy of two Imamic commanders who wrote letters to certain Saiyids of Behan asking them to seize and kill the Kadi because of his British proclivities. Letters were at the same time written by the same Saiyids to a friend of the Kadi, one Saiyid Salim bin Ahmed bin Duran, urging him to bring in the Kadi who, if he were complacent, would be made the paid Administrator of the Province of Badman. The Kadi luckily received a letter from a friendly Imamic leader^—one Saiyid Ahmed bin Bubaker—- warning him against compliance with the Imamic overtures. As he a^ked for assistance he was given Bs. 500. 2. Sheikh Saleh Mohsin Askar of Mausata (Upper Yafa) writes that Ibn Nasir Mukbil, the Mawia Sheikh and Arab are proceeding to Kataba accompanied by Amir Nasr. Their objective is said to be Shu’aib. Amir Nasr had been to Lahej with an offering to Said Pasha of bullocks and goats. 3. The Fadli Sultan has again written reiterating his demand for the payment of his stipend and saying that he w^nt to Lahej to save his country from ruin and because his relatives and Sheikhs forced his hands. He adds that he is under the British Government, who will be to blame if he suffers any hurt. He denies that he is assisting the Turks in any way. It is true that caravans through his country come in pretty freely but it is equally certain that some go to Lahej too. The Sultan has been addressed to the effect that after the expulsion of the Turks from Lahej he will be given an opportunity to justify his actions. No reply has been given as to his stipend which has been suspended. 4. The Fadli’s grandson writes that the former has been addressed by Said Pasha to stop dhows taking firewood to Aden and also to obstruct all goods for upcountry arriving from Aden to Shukra by sea, threatening an expedition against him if he fails to comply. The grandson says that the Sultan made some reply and that he will try to ascertain the purport of it. He adds that his own allowance has been stopped by the Sultan and he wishes to visit Aden. It has been considered advisable not to encourage the writer Abdul Kadir at this time. The Fadli Sultan is an old man of 70 years and his position is doubtless a difficult one. 5. The Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla, in reply to this Besidency letter (vide paragraph 1 of Weekly Letter dated 1st instant), writes that he has written to all his officials to be on the lookout to report in future such events as the arrival of the German schooner at Balahaf port. 6. The Sultan reports that the “ Ashraf ” of Hadramaut in combination with “ Xbn Abdallah,” i.e., the Kathiri Sultan of Terim, had mustered some men and were in possession of a small gun ; that he at once deputed his Minister with 500 picked men to go to the scene of the disturbance. He promises to give this Besidency reliable news when received. It is noteworthy that quite recently Sultan Ghalib of Mokalla reported the Kathiri to be well under his thumb. But it appears that he calculated without the “ Ashraf,” who are always fomenting trouble. Received on 12 -JUn | INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S | Letter.

A Shairi Akil (Amiri) Ahmed Kasim al Haddad writes that Saleh Kassim, the brother of our stipendiary Sheikh, Abdul Rahman bin Kassim of Muflahi (Upper rafa) who went to Lahej was killed in the action lately at Imad. 2. Sheikh Kasim Mahomed al Zubedi (Amiri) writes that it is said that the Imam s men are preparing an expedition against the territories of Ibn Nasir Mokbil, the Arab in Turkish employ of the districts of Shurman and Kamaira. This is hardly credible. 3. It appears to me from various information that the Turks have formulated a new policy in relation to the Arabs. They have told the Arabs that they have come to assist them as their co-religionists and that as soon as they have expelled all foreign enemies they will leave Arabia to the Arabs. 4. Sultan Umar bin Kahtan who recently left Aden via Shukra (Fadli’s capital) for his country of Upper Yafa writes that he saw and remonstrated with the Fadli Sultan for going to Lahej* He says that the latter fears the British Government who were wrongly informed by Aden people of his alleged treachery. The Yafai Sultan thinks that the Fadli is at heart loyal. 5. Please see paragraph 4 of Weekly Letter dated 1st April 1916. The Audhali Sultan writing on the 14th instant states that he has heard from Said Pasha, and asks what reply he should give him. He says that one of his relatives has been killed by the tribesmen of Ahl Audhillah and he asks for guns and ammunition to avenge the insult. The Sultan has been counselled to give Said Pasha no reply; and as to his request for guns, it has been pointed out that while we have none to spare, it is not a part of our duty to interfere and keep his tribesmen in order, for that would be prejudicial to his authority. 6. Muthanna Ali Al Shafi, a Shairi of Al Jalila (Amiri), writes that 15 Germans have left Sana and have been sketching at lb, Taiz and other places. He further reports that the Sana Government have issued a proclamation that peace has been made and all who have complaints at Sheikh Othman and Lahej should at once proceed to Turkish Courts to seek redress {sic). I don’t understand what he means. *.\To. C.-401, dated Aden Residency, the 29fch April (received the 8 th May) 1916. Endorsed by the Political Resident at Aden.

The Upper Aulaki Sheikh, Mohsin bin Farid, has written deploring the action of the Fadli Sultan in going over to the Turks at Lahej. As regards Turkish activity on his side, he states that the Turks and the Zaidis are in correspondence with Behan and the country northwards. He hears that they intend to go down to the Yahari clansmen of Lower Yafa and Beda and that the Turks have supplied arms, ammunition and money to many of the tribes including the Nisiyin of Am Harfa, near Yashbum, his capital. He says that Said Pasha has addressed him, but he has not given any reply. He adds that he knows only too well what has befallen Lahej, and will have nothing to do with the Turks, or a jihad. Finally, he makes the common request to be supplied with arms and ammunition. 2. During the short stay here of His Excellency the Naval Commander-in- Chief, East Indies and Egypt, a few sea-planes flew over Lahej area, and dropped a number of bombs. This, it is reported, has caused great consternation amongst the Arabs who are leaving Lahej and vicinity and travelling up-country. Said Pasha is said to have warned all who go that their goods and houses will be forfeited. He tells the Arabs that he has wired to Sanaa for aeroplanes, and promises them that he will retaliate on Aden. Since the bombing ceased, the friendly Arabs have shown that they are impressed by this oflensive movement, and elated at the discomfiture of the Turks. 3. The Shairi head Sheikh of A1 Malaha (Amiri), Saleh bin Salim, reports that some of the Yafa’i tribesmen in the service of the Turks at Lahej have returned home after seeing the discomfiture of the Turks in a^recent engagement with the British before Imad. 4. The Beda Sultan Abdallah bin Alawi al Rassasi, in a letter to this Resi dency, asserts his firm friendship with the British Government. He says that many Turkish letters have come to Beda but that he has warned his people not to reply to them. No. C.-365, dated Aden Residency, the 14th (received the 24th) April 1916.

Robertson, Esq., Secretary to Government of Bombay. On the 10th instant, a party of six strangers, believed to be G-ermans and a Saiyid, arrived in a schooner, and landed at a place called Sheikha Hurba, in the Lower Aulaki country (on the east coast of our Protectorate). The party then proceeded to Lahej. The first intimation I had of their arrival was a letter from the Aulaki Sultan, received here on the 14th idem, and written after the departure of the party, asking me to despatch a warship, without loss of time, to tow the schooner to Aden. H. M. S. “ Northbrook ” immediately left after the receipt of this letter, and returned to Aden with the Sultan on board. The schooner sank, whilst being towed to Aden. There was no crew on the schooner, and the Sultan says she was emptied of her contents. His account is that after the party landed at Sheikha Hurba, the Saiyid interpreter took them to Ahwar, the Aulaki capital, on the 12th instant, where the Sultan interviewed them at night. He says that three of the party gave Turkish names, and that the remaining three were of darker complexion, and that all wore Eastern dress and turbans. He says he was suspicious, but never divined the German origin of the men. The Saiyid told him that they were all Java j Moslems, and that they were going to do the Hajj at Mecca. The party pressed forward from Ahwar, and their luggage, vit'., boxes and portmanteaus, were carried on ten camels. The Sultan does not know the contents of the boxes. He says that it was only after their arrival at Shukra (Fadli) that he heard that they were Germans. He expresses great contrition. German papers found on board the schooner go to prove German identity, and an Arabic scroll gives the likely places on the Hadramaut, where a landing might be effected. The Arabic shews that the Arab writer was not of these parts, though he had knowledge of the coast. The places mentioned were His, Shehr, Mokalla, Balahaf, Bir Ali, etc., and it was written that the best landing was between Burum and Fuwwa (Mokalla), and the final destination was given as Lahej. It would appear that these men were exiles escaping from Java ; though it is ‘possible they were on some secret mission to Lahej. Sheikha Hurba, where the schooner dropt anchor, is a stronghold of the Ba Kazim tribe who, though nominally under the Lower Aulaki Sultan, have always proved a thorn in his side, and expeditions against them are the order of the day. The Fadli Sultan writes that six men like Germans landed on Aulaki soil, and that the party were escorted by one Sheikh of the religious faction of Ba Muzahim to his country of Abyan, whence they proceeded to Lahej. He atributes ‘mala fides ’ to the Aulaki, but says nothing of his own share in the business. He reiterates his demand for his stipend. I have addressed the Sultan a strong letter, pointing out this final act of hostility against us, and have told him that his stipend is stopped, and that we shall deal with him later. It is reported that in the recent Turkish attack on Sheikh Othman which was repulsed, there were a few Germans aiding the Turkish forces. These are apparently the same that arrived from Java of whom one is said to have been killed in the above attack, and the remaining have since left, it is said, for Sana. i No. C.-312 dated Aden Residency, the 25th March (received the 3rd April) 1916.

The Upper Aulaki Sultan, Saleh bin Abdullah, writes that Zaidis with some Turks have come Behan-wards ; that they were interviewed by Sheikhs ofAbbeda Bani Sef, Wahm, Musa’bain and Bal-Harith ; and that they then entered into friendly relations with a view to penetrating the Hadramaut. He anticipates a fight, and since he is short of arms and ammunition asks us to supply the same. We have long heard of a Zaidi advance in this direction, though so far it has proved abortive.

He says that he is now better, and will meet Colonel Jacob, as soon as possible. He assures me that he is still friendly with the British Government, and asks for the payment of his stipend. I have written to him to come in, if he has anything to urge, and have promised safe-conduct. 2. Sheikh Abdallah bin Abdul Jabbar, brother to the Mansab of the Fadli and the Lower Aulaki, who is now in Aden, states that the Fadli Sultan and his grandson Abdul Kadir are on very bad terms ; that the latter is well disposed towards ug, and that in consequence the Sultan threatens to bring in the Turks to punish him. The Sheikh further states that the Sultan has received 2 months’ stipend from Said Pasha ; that he is delighted at the Pasha s gift to him of 200 acres of Abdali soil for cultivation ; that the Sultan believes the British cannot oust the Turks from Lahej territory, and that he (the Sultan) promised the Pasha to return to Lahej on the expiry of two months. The Sheikh also reports the arrival of letters from the Hadramaut to the address j of Said Pasha. 3. A police report alleges that the Turkish Government is displeased with Said Pasha’s inactivity, and is replacing him by Edham Pasha. Bazaar reports state (1) that considerable Turkish reinforcements have arrived at A1 Anad ; (2) that Said Pasha has arranged to visit the Fadli Sultan with 1,000 troops ; (3) that Said Pasha has addressed his officers, saying that he regrets he is not strong enough to attack Aden, and that they must exercise patience. Except, as showing that many rumours are going about, I am at present unable to attach any special importance to any of these. 4.

Mausata ask for arms and money. As we are “ friendly to Islamic people, ” Mausata hope God will frustrate the Turkish tricks, and give no success to Turkish arms. (5) Shu’aib send a letter, written to them by Amir Nasr of Dala, who summons them to Dala to sub mission to Sublime Government. Mausata cau tions Shu’aib to have nothing to do with the summons. The Turks have also written direct to Ahl Shu’aib. (c) A Dubi stipendiary Sheikh corroborates the above news. 23. The Audhali Sultan (10th February 1916) writes, he hears of a Turkish intention once again to invade Beda. 24. The Fulesi Sheikh, writing to Abdali Sultan in Aden, cries out for British support; that Arabs run to Turkish summons either from fear or in hope of plunder. If the British Government would retain Arabs, they must call them in, and make arrangements for a combination—or otherwise the troops at Sheikh Othman should go out and give Turks a severe blow, in order that the Arabs may see the power of Government. The Fulesi adds that he is sending his family to the Audhah country to secure them from harm. Nil. 25.

The Sultan’s son-in-law met him with a cavalcade at Dar-al-Munasara. A1 Umairi returned to Lahej in the evening. 28. One of the Fadli Askaris arrived with caravan this day, announces that Said Pasha has addressed a remonstrance to the Fadli Sultan for allowing caravans to go to Aden from Abyan, and told him he was acting contrary to his undertakings. The Sultan then called a conclave of all the petty Sultans to get their views, so that he personally might not be blamed thereafter for any decision made. The Sultan’s son-in-law as spokesman said that the Fadli was dependent for supplies on Aden, and it was inexpedient to stop the free passage of caravans in. He asked why the Pasha was him self unable to stop Lahej caravans from going to Aden. The Sultan then wrote to the Pasha, and gave him the tenor of the Fadli opinion, and added that he placed his affairs in God’s hands, and the Pasha might take any steps he liked. Nil.

Another report was to the effect that he had been commissioned by Saiyid Pasha to collect men, and return to Lahej. 47. Abdali Sultan in Aden confirms (see No. 41 above) wholesale gifts to Fadli by thn Pasha of Abdali Sultan’s lands and houses. The Fadli believes his lineage is linked with that of the Ottoman Turks ! Behan. 48. The Kadi of Behan, who has always been well- disposed to this Residency, writes that he is doing his best to further the British cause in that part of the country. He lacks arms and ammunition, and wants us to give him what Government had issued for him some time back, which the arrival of the Turks precluded him from receiving. Recalls the fight last July with the Zeidis, and corrobo rates the informant of item No. (44) in the intention of Riyashiya to fight once more the people of our protectorate, when fortunately the Imam’s party, and that of Riyashiya* fell out, and the attack has been deferred. This fracas took place at Damt. The tribesmen of Rashid wa Bakil were with A1 Arashi, and some of Khaulan. (2) Further that Imam has called the Shaikhs of Saba to him : reason not known. (3) That by closing the ports in Red Sea, and limiting the flow of supplies from Aden up-country, all the Yemen is in a bad way, and it is said that some Sana’ani merchants have represented their case to Stamboul. The Kadi would like to see the Resident, occasional visitor. He is an 49. Writing on 19th January, the Kotaibi Shaikh, ' Shaikh Muhammad Saleh A1 Akhram, notifies he has heard from Saiyid Pasha, who has accepted the Shaikh’s apology for sending his caravan to Aden ; that after the arrival of the said caravan (now in Aden) in the Kotaibi country, the Shaikh is expect ed to go to Lahej. The Pasha has sent him a safe- conduct. The Kotaibi says he does not anticipate any good from all this since he well knows the behaviour of Turks in other parts of the Hinter land. The Shaikh is not sure of the prowls and spirit of the Radfan tribes,f and knows thdy can not oppose successfully the Turks. He asks for ammunition from British Government, and longs for us to oust the Turks from Lahej. He trusts this may be done to preclude the Turks attacking his country, and to divert their interference.

He has already proffered to the Pasha his excuses for non-attendance at Lahej, and he wants to know what reply he can now give the Pasha. 50. One of our Dubi (Upper Yafa) stipendiaries, by name Shaikh Salim bin Saleh, declares his alle giance to British cause in spite of the fact that some of the Yafais have gone to Lahej. He asks us to reinstate the Abdali Sultan of Lahej, and states that the Hinterland as a whole follows the Abdali’s lead. 51 52. The Italian Consul in Aden says that he has heard indirectly from M. Caprotti, an Italian merchant long resident in Sana’a, that the imam is well stock ed with food supplies, and the Consul seemed to thinkffhat some come from^Eridi?^ 53. Reported that before Sultan Husen bin Ahmed, the Fadli, left Lahej for Abyan he wrote letters at the instance of the Pasha to the Aulaki Sultans, and the Audhali, Beda, etc., extolling the'good treatment he had received in Turkish hands, and urging their surrender to Lahej, failing which, he (the Fadli) would close the road to Aden. The Sultan has, it is said, brought back arms and am munition with him from the Turks. 54. A man of the Maisari (Fadli) tribe has come to say that he personally heard the Fadli Sultan tell his Marakisha Shaikhs to plunder all caravans that come through Abyan from Aden, and that this would be notified by beat of tom-tom. 55. See (54). New ? comers in corroborate the above, and state that the Fadli has announced by beat of tom-tom that the road to and from Aden is closed, unless the outgoing caravans from Aden are as liberally laden with supplies, as those that have hitherto been coming in. For three days no caravans have arrived, and this points to activity of Fadli Sultan on the lines of his proclamation. G. M.

He will communicate further news on the Fadli Sultan’s return to Abyan. Allowance must be made for the Italian animus against Idrisi, since their pact with him; more especially when they came to know that the Brit ish Government was approaching the Idrisi. In this connection, and from an oppo site view, see item 48 above—clause 3, which would go to show that the country as a whole was suffering from our closure of the Red Sea ports, and restrictions against trade by land from Aden.■———” SECRET.

Fadli Sultan’s messenger (see 56) at interview says the Sultan arrived eight days ago at Ba Sha- hara near Zanzibar (Fadli). He has not deserted the British Government, but fear drove him to Lahej. He says the Sultan did not proclaim by beat of tom-tom that Aden’s supplies should be cut off. He adds, however, that the Bedouin importers of food to Aden are dissatisfied with Police at Barrier Gate who do not allow goods in any quantity to . pass the Gate outward. The Sultan’s grandson is ^ Shukra, but Fadli has called him to Abyan.

W. i inch sheet, E. Long. 45 and N. Lat. 14° 30'), urging him to own the Imam and Turkish sway, and to leave the Kafirs. The Imam’s letter is as usual full of pious platitudes. (The Humekani had evi dently been corresponding with Kaifa, but says he knows we are stronger than Turks, and is sure we shall prove victorious.) 2nd February 1916 % 3. Fairly reliable news received that Fadli Sultan has come to an agreement with Saiyid Pasha to close 1 the Aden road from Abyan. The Sultan was given permission to return to Abyan, and promised to return after two months. Sultan proclaimed that he was not responsible for the plunder of any one that went to Aden, and further he gave orders to his principal tribesmen of the Marakisha to interrupt the route into Aden. . The Sultan has been addressed in forcible terms. 4. Kadi of Behan reports by letter (12th January 1916) that a force of Zeidis with five guns attacked Beda, and were routed with loss of two guns and many rifles. The Zeidis returned northwards. 3rd February 1916 5.

The Pasha has urged on the Fadli Sultan that he should not meet the English, and that the Pasha will recompense the Fadli for what he will lose by the stoppage of British doles ; that the Sultan on return from Lahej has proclaimed that camels going into Aden will be plundered : that thfe Sul tan has been given by the Pasha 200 acres of field and gardens belonging to the sons of Fadl bin Ali to the family of the present Sultan of Lahej). Sultan Husen the Fadli writes (31st January 1916) that his enemies the Haidara Am Mansur and the Marakisha are numerous. They go to Lahej, and lie against him. He went to Lahej to clear him self, and to make arrangements for his subjects; and the peaceful enjoyment of their fields. On his return to Abyan he heard that Shukra was close to sea traffic. He now accuses his Aden agent A1 Ramah of sending goods to Shukra for Turkish consumption. He says he has imprisoned some of his subjects for this action, and has substituted another agent in place of A1 Ramah. Hopes Resident will remove embargo on trade to Shukra, as by it our proteges up-country will be the sufferers !! Undertakes that nothing will go to the Turks. (b) The same messenger brings a letter from the grand son, Abdul Kadir, who writing from Abyan (no date) acknowledges the Resident’s letter, and pleads for clemency towards his aged grandfather. Says he is willing to meet the Resident in Aden. 5th February 1916 Letter from Fadli Sultan (dated 2nd February 1916), acknowledging Resident’s letter of 31st December 1915. Says he only did what he said would be necessary, when the Turks entered the Haushabi tract adjoining his frontiers, i. e., he went to Lahej to preclude the invasion of his country by the enemy. This would have meant devastation and ruin, and the stoppage of the routes leading to the Friendlies in the North. He went to Lahej to save his country and people. He was at his wit’s end. The Pasha has received no benefits from him. His friendship with the British is as strong as ever. He has not received Government’s favours for 40 years, without being indebted for the same. He acted solely under Turkish pressure. He did not pro claim that caravans should not go to Aden. The tribes men complained of ill-treatment at the Barrier Gate, and tribesmen should not be so treated. It was the tribesmen, who proclaimed by beat of tom-tom, but he (the Sultan) forbade them to do so. The trafe-route is not closed as stated. He has not sefit supplies to Lahej. Some irresponsible fellows did, and he has imprisoned them. It is true the Pasha gave him lands, and a place in Lahej. He did not ask for these, but returned to Abyan. When the Abdalis return to Lahej, they will come back in to their own. He asks that the embargo may be removed, and requests his stipend be paid. He ignores the proposal for an interview. (6) The new Fadli agent, /hmad Abdallah Am Uragi, interviewed states, he remonstrated with Fadli Sultan in the Abyan for having stopped the trade- route to Aden, and pointed out to him that this would call for retaliatory measures from British Government, and that such would affect the Friend lies above Shukra, to say nothing of loss of Fadli taxes. That the Sultan replied, he had [enforced the embargo outwardly to please the Pasha, but that he did not mean it should be carried out, and he told the tribesmen to travel through as usual. Am Uragi said this was insufficient, and the Sultan Remarks and references to Appendices. n oth* He omits to mention that the Military prevented the Turks entering his country by demon strating against the Turks at Lahej.

To this latter proposal the Sultan rather demurred, as he feared he would be detained in Aden ! After some talk he agreed to meet the First Assistant Resident in Shaikh Abdallah. (The Sultan’s letter is silent on this point.) The agent also states that he saw Sultan Abdul Kadir, the grandson, who said he would personally meet the First Assistant Resident at Shaikh Abdallah on board the warship, and, thereafter, contrive to bring the Sultan himself and others of his near relatives. 8. Alawi Shaikh, Ali Nashir, writing (30th January 1916) says his property was looted by the Turks, and, be cause the crops were good, and his tribesmen molest ed, he had perforce to go to Lahej to treat. Saiyid Pasha accused him of disobedience, and refractori ness, but he replied he could withstand neither English nor Turks. He stoutly protests his loyalty to British Government, and wants to visit the Resident. • 9. Kotaibi Shaikh. Muhammad Saleh A1 Akhram writes (20th January 1916) from what it appears there was no fighting with the Turks, as reported, but the Turks persistently assert they will come into the Radfan Hills, if the Shaikh does not go to them after the arrival of the Kotaibi caravan from Aden for which a safe-conduct was promised by the Pasha. He says that his nephew, Mokbil Abdallah, returned from Lahej, and stated it was the Pasha’s programme to draw the Arabs to his cause. The Kotaibi Shaikh said the Turks’ be haviour was disliked by the Arabs, but the British Government should act at once, either by sending up troops, or with arms and ammunition. Other wise it would be useless hereafter, when the mischief was done, to blame the Shaikh. He was not a Government, but a collection of tribesmen merely. If British Government failed to assist him the dis grace would be theirs’. The caravan has al ready left for his country. 1 G. ML.

S. “ Northbrook ” with Colonel Wauhope, R.E., returns at 3 p.m. 17th January 1916 28. Reports differ as to numbers of followers the; Fadli Sultan took with him to Lahej on Friday night, the 14th instant. 29. Reports allege that Saiyid Pasha has wired to Sana’a for more troops. No reliable information hitherto received, as to the casualties of Turks on 12th Jan uary ; average estimate 300. 30. The Fulesi Shaikh; who came from Abyan, states that, when reports increased as to likely Turkish attack from the Lower Yafai country he left his place, and went to see Fadli Sultan. Arriving at A1 Musemir (Fadli) he saw H. M. S. “ Northbrook ” at Shaikh Abdallah. Thereupon the Sultan’s son- in-law asked the Sultan to wait and see the “ North- . brook’s” errand, but he would not listen, but said that he would be back in Abyan shortly, and the warship might await his arrival. The Fulesi is fully determined in his own mind that none of the Fadli people had any heart for opposing the Turks. They said they were powerless to do so, and feared their country would be ruined. The Fulesi gives a detailed list of prominent men, who went over to Lahej ; mostly Marakisha, some Dathina people, and others. See item No. 27. Colonel Wauhope’s report is attached, dated 17th January. It confirms Sultan’s depar ture to Lahej. He left Shukra on 11th January, ostensibly to punish certain marauders, who were looting his crops, but really his move was to proceed to Saiyid Pasha. Hearing of the fight in front of Shaikh Othman, on 12th January, he sent men to d scjver who in the fight were victorious. In mean time, as “ Northbrook ” waited at Shukra, the Fadli sent a letter to say that he was “ drawn ” to Lahej, and if the warship waited a day or two he would, if waited, board the ship, and proceed to Aden. The “ Northbrook ” left for Aden early on 16th January. 31. Police report (hardly credible) states the Fadli Sultan has returned to Abyan from Lahej. 32. Sultan Abdul Kadir, the grandson of the Fadli Sultan, has sent us a letter, saying that his grand father has gone tr Lahej.

Saiyid Ali Aun, a reliable Abdali man at Nobat lyad, states that the Turkish force that went to Harur and the Shairi country have returned to number of 200 men. The Harur party participated in fight against us on 12th January. Some Shairis have been brought down as prisoners. 35. Abdul Karim, the Abdali Sultan, has heard from an eye-witness of fight on 12th January, that numerous Turks were killed ; that Saijid Pasha brought down 800 Turks from Lahej, and before their arrival, the Turks were preparing to retreat. Saiyid Pasha has not been wounded, as reported. The Fadli Sultan was honourably received, and an escort fetched him to Lahej from A1 Tha’lab. After the interview Sultan Husen begged to be allowed to return to his country. The Pasha hoped he would stay, and see the British defeat shortly, and that the Sultan’s presence was a good augury for Turkish success. It is said the Sultan was depressed, and realises he has put himself into an awkward position. 36. Police report says the Audhali Sultan, Upper Yafa Shaikh, are asked by Kuaiti Sultan of .Mokalla to combine to fight the Turks. Kauiti promises to aid with ammunition. 37. Fulesi Shaikh Akil has an interview with Resident, and assures him of his loyalty to Government. He will go backhand impress upon his people the un- Lahej, and will decry the same, as an injustice to the British Government. 38. The Kotaibi Shaikh Muhammad Saleh writes on 14th January a friendly letter, insisting on his faithfulness to Government, and assuring the Resi dent he will resist any Arab attacks made on his tribesmen. He says “ Mawia ” is still at Dala, but believes all Turks have left. Confirms the report that the Turks, who were at Shairi, and from A1 Raha, retired on 12th and 13th January, when the fighting took place before Shaikh Othman. Trusts that the action of his nephew Mukbil Abdallah, who went perforce to Lahej may be condoned. Believes Turks will shortly return to his hills. Asks for arms and ammunition. 39. Shaikh Saleh Salim, who is in Aden, says that Amir Nasr of Dala called on all Shairi Akils to tender their submission to him and Turkish Government, but they declined to do so. Whereupon he, accompanied by the Kaim Makam of Kataba and “ Mawia,” played havoc with several Shairi “ dars, and removed plunder. 40. His Agent at Bir Ahmed reports that Shaikh Fadl, the Akrabi, has been set free at Lahej, but not allow ed to return to Bir Ahmed, unless he takes with him a Turkish guard. To this the Shaikh demurred. (b) The same informant alleges that Saiyid Pasha has wired for reinforcements of 500 Turks, ammunition and money from Mawia.3 Political Intelligence Summary — concld.

Report says that the Padli Sultan is still at Lahej, where the Pasha has offered him many acres of cultivable land, belonging to Abdul Majid, brother of the deceased Sultan Ahmed Fadl. 21st January 1916 42. A Maisari (Fadli) Shaikh, who came from Lahej yesterday, says the Fadli is anxious to return to Abyan, but the Pasha presses him to stay ; that the Pasha has called in the Haidara Am Mansur and the Lower Yafais, in order to patch up their differ ences with the Fadli Sultan ; that the Sultan wrote to his son-in-law Ah bin Ahmed, to his son Abdallah, and his grandson Abdul Kadir to come to Lahej. The son-in-law replied he was too busy with harvest ing his crops. r 43. Kptaibi writes that he warned Dambari tribesmen not to traffic with Lahej. They send live-stock there, and almost daily go to see the Pasha. The Kotaibi beheves the Pasha sent the Dambari Shaikh Salim bin Husen some money, which the latter declined to receive (?); &gt; (b) that Amir Nasar of Dala had written to all the Radfan tribesmen, including Kotaibi, to meet him at Dala. Kotaibi wrote to them not to go, but that he might represent them later —rendezvous at Hardaba. 22nd January 1916 9 « 44. A prominent Azzani (Beda) tribesman Shaikh Abdallah bin Salim interviewed to-day says, that the people of Riyashiya (Shafai persuasion) (new boundary map 1 to 4 in. N. Lat. 44 • 10 and E. Long. 44'45) were planning an attack on Beda Sultan, but the leader became at variance with the Imamic Lieutenant “ Sef al Islam ” and so deferred his attack ; that the newly elected Rassasi Sultan of Beda, Abdallah bin Alawi bin Husein, was a stout warrior, and he did not think the Turks or Imam could get a foot-hold in these hills. 45. The Maisari Shaikh Abdallah Am Muhammad is willing to come in to help the British Government, if his Sultan, the Fadli, is not amenable, but he wants ammunition to resist the Marakisha and Nakha’i tribesmen, who are devoted to Sultan (see No. 42 above). -4 Aden Residency, 17th January 1916. Subject— The FADLI SULTAN. Resident, I left Aden on the 14th instant, in H. M. S. “ Northbrook ” with letter for the Fadli Sultan. On arrival at Shaikh Abdullah in the Abyan, where he was believed to be, it was impossible to communicate with the shore, owing to the rough sea ; it was evident, however, that the Sultan was not at Shaikh Abdullah, and it was decided to sail to Shukra early next morning. We were there met by a messenger sent by Abdul Kadir, the Fadli’s grandson, who said the Sultan was at A1 Khamila in Abyan, about eight miles north-west of Shaikh Abdullah. The interpreter, Ali Ibrahim, then went ashore to interview Abdul Kadir, and returned at 2-30, with the following news :—The Sultan left Shukra on the 11th for Abyan, intending to make terms with the Turks, but ostensibly to punish some marauders who were looting his crops. He there heard of the engagement of the 12th between the British and Turkish forces near Lahej, and he sent men out to see which side was victorious, before committing himself further. He had not, as far as was'known then, actually gone to Lahej, so I sent him a brief letter to say the “ Northbrook ” would be off Shaikh Abdullah next day, and asked him to send a reply to the Resident’s letter there, as early as possible. At 6 p.m. another messenger came on board, briniging the accompanying letter from the Fadli himself to say he was going to meet the Pasha, and the messenger, who brought the Sultan’s letter, said that immediately after signing and despatching the letter he had started for Lahej, i.e., on the morning of the 15th. Early on the 16th the “ Northbrook ” left for Aden, but we waited off Shaikh Abdullah for some time in the hope of being able to gain some information there. Owing to the weather, however, we could not land there, and there were no fishing boats in the neighbourhood by which communicatioa with the shore could be made. Everything seemed quiet there, and at Shukra where Abdul Kadir is, as is usual during his grandfather’s absence, in charge. He expressed his loyalty to Government, and his readiness to obey any instructions the Resident might send him. R. F. WAUHOPE, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political and Military Intelligence Officer. G. M.

The Ashraif of Al Raha (Haushabi) then went to the Shaikh, and strongly advised him to tender submission. The Shaikh accordingly went to the Turks with sacrifices, and accompanied by the Sharifs, but was made a prisoner, and sent to Lahej. The lurks then proceeded to the Kotaibi country. 9. The Kotaibi’s agent says that some of the Abdali caravanmen, who arrived here on the 8th instant, reported that the Turks have been sending troops in the direction of the Kotaibi country for three successive days. 10. The Lower Aulaki Sultan in his letter, dated 24th December 1915, requests that a ship be sent to Ahwar for him to come to Aden to pay respects to the Resident and the Abdali Sultan and his brothers, and to discuss matters with the latter, with a view to his co-operation with them. 11th January 11. Colonel Jacob returned from Jezan in H. M. S. “ Lama. ” 12. It is reported that the Fadli Suitan deputed Shaikh Ahmed Ba Muzahim to the Turks in order to obtain pardon for the Abyan people, but that the Turks re fused his mediation, unless the Eadli punished the Abyan people. The latter are said to be fleeing to Shukra. 12th January 13. The Amir of Dala’s intrigue with Kotaibi Shaikh was unsuccessful, but the Kotaibis are now, after a fight with Turks, reported to have gone to treat with them at Lahej. (This is all due to ‘ force maMure? as prophesied some time back.) 14. The Alawi Shaikh also was captured, and taken to Lahej. •• 15. Ibn Kasir Mukbil with Turks is reported at Harur. Not confirmed. Shaikh Othman force going out to make a reconnais sance and feint encountered Turks, whose Infantry attacked and fell back. Artillery duel throughout the day. 13th January 16. Report says that Haushabi Sultan warned the Fadli Sultan that Turks were advancing on him. He should either fight them or remain quiet. The Fadli marched with his men from Shukra to Abyan. 17. Kotaifci Chief says his nephew Mokbil Abdallah had gone to treat with San id Pasha for safe conduct of the Kotaioi caravan. Kotaibi asks for ammunition, and says he will fight Turks.

The Dubi stipendiary Shaikh Omar Muthanna im peaches the Muflahi Shaikh Abdul Rahman, whose brother has gone to Lahej. He further accuses the Mausta Shaikhs of trafficking with Lahej. He eulo gises Sultan Umar bin Kahtan of Upper Yafa, and the Hadrami Shaikh. This letter is not re liable. Dubi has always been hostile to Mausta owing to family divisions. 20. An Aulaki tribesman reports arrival of Turks at A1 Rawa and Al Husn (Lower Yafai country) with ob jective against Al Khanfar (Fadli). The Fulesi Shaikh Akil has pressed the Fadli Sultan to move to attack. Not confirmed. 14th January 21. Colonel Wauhope, R.E., proceeds in H. M. S. “ Northbrook ” to Shaikh Abdallah and Shukra to investigate matters, and interview the Fadli Sultan. 22. Prominent Shairi Akils interviewed from Al Malaha, Al Ishari, Khoreba, and Ghol Sabula, say that Kaycd Saleh, the Kaim Mokam of Kataba, is in Jabel Jihaf and levies dues. There are no* Turks in Dala plateau. “ Turkish Position ” is fortified by Shairis. They are uncertain whether Amir Nasr gets a Turkish stipend, but he is unmistakably pro- Turk. They say that Shaikh Ali Nashir, the Alawi, was persuaded by Ashraf of Al Raha (Haushabi) to go over to Turks, who would otherwise overrun his country. They say they are unaware of a fight between Turks and Kotaibis. It seems that the Kotaibi Shaikh was compelled to treat with Turks. * Very doubtful. 15th January 23. Audhali Sultan sends in a letter from Saiyid Pasha, urging him to join the Islamic Standard, and turn out the infidels. He asks what reply he should make to the letter. A suitable reply is being sent to Audhali. 24. With reference to item 17, dated 13th instant, the Al Malaha Shaikh now in Aden has just received a message to say that Ibn Nasir Mukbil, with 50 Turks and many Arabs, went to the Shairi country, and demolished his village (Al Malaha). Histv. o children and a cousin perished. A cousin of Al Thuer (Akil of Ghol Sabula) was also killed. It is more likely that enemy force went up to Shairi country, and prob ably not to Harur. 1 25. A letter from Fadli Sultan Husen bin Ahmed, dated, arrived by special messenger. The Sultan was last seen by messenger at Al Khamila in As Salum country, north-west of Shaikh Abdallah, and was bound for Lahej. The letter asks permission to go in to treat, and winds up by assertion that the die is £ efast, and he is going in ! Alleges that Saivid Pasha’s 'bribery of Fadli Akils has cut the ground under his (Sultan’s) feet, and it is useless to live amongst a people, who are bought over by Turkish gold. Hopes the Political Resident will look kindly on this business. The friendship between him and Gov ernment will increase rather than decrease. A letter of remonstrance was addressed to The Sultan in hope of catching him en route. This evening Shaikh Akil, the Fulesi, came in, and told us the Sultan had gone to Lahej, and had addressed a letter to the H. M. S. “ Northbrook ” which he espied at Shaikh Abdallah, giving his reasons for this departure. &gt; N.B .—Aden weekly letters Nos. 50 and 51, dated the 11th and 18th December 1915, respectively.

Amir Nasir is now reported to have arrived at Dala, with an escort of 300 Turks and Arabs. It is said that in addition to the 50 rifles, the Turks have also given him $ 400. 2. It is further reported that the Turks have allowed the Amir to retain possession of the villages of Jabel Jihaf, Azraki, Ahmadi and al-Fajara, the latter agreeing to pay an annual tax of $ 8 to 10,000 to the Porte. These villages were formerly under the Turks, but as the result of the last Boundary Commission, they were placed under the Amir’s suzerainty. 3. Saeed Bey, the Turkish Commandant at Lahej, it is reported, sent letters with $ 400 to the Shaikhs of the Dambari, an independent tribe in the Aden Protectorate, inviting them to Lahej, but the latter replied declining. iV.

Th.e Master of the S.S. “ Koweit ” of the Bombay and Persia Steam Naviga tion Company has furnished the following interesting information to the Port Officer here :— (1) “ The cargo coolies and boatmen (at Jeddah) are far less truculent and offensive than last year. I heard from several sources that the Turks have already got one big gun, of what calibre could not ascer tain,' but as they are making a concrete foundation for mounting it, presume it to be of good size : from what I was told, it (the gun) was transported from Yembo, via Medina and Mecca to Jeddah, and that there is another of the same size in transportation. I do not make this statement from personal observation, but think there is good foundation for reporting to you, it being common talk among the boatmen.” (2) “ I landed six passengers on my way up—Company’s servants, and on my return to Jeddah, found that they had been detained as suspected spies. They were not maltreated bodily, but were given no food, nor allowed to buy any.” (3) “ There seems to be an unlimited supply of English soveregins in Jeddah: all purchases made by the ship have to be paid in gold through the agent: no Turkish gold is in circulation,[nor are rupee notes accepted by the Arabs.” (4) “ I believe from what I heard that the Bedouins are very bitter against the Germans : at the same time they are also opposed to British domination, Arabia for the Arabs seems to be their theme.” Dated Aden Residency, the 20th November (received the 2nd December) 1915.

Amir Nasir appears to have now come to some settlement with the Turks, whereby the latter have reinstat ed him, and given him 50 rifles, and 10 rifles to Sheikh Kassim of Zubed (Amiri), who accompanied him to Lahej. It appears further that the Amir has agreed to keep his son with the Turks, as a hostage, in place of the 14 or 15 hostages taken from him some months ago. In this connection please see Weekly Letter dated 29th May 1915. The Amir left Lahej on 30th ultimo. 2. The Kotaibi Sheikh writes that the Turks repeatedly send him letters, in viting him to come to Lahej, and that though they have so far put up with his excuses for non-compliance, he cannot be sure that they will not eventually make an ingress into his territory. I have written to assure this Sheikh. I do not think the Turks are strong enough to detach troops in that direction. N.

The Barhimis (Subehis) the other day raided Little Aden, and carried away about 200 goats, but the inhabitants of Little Aden pursued the raiders, and re covered the property. 2. An informant reports that the Arabs are discontented with the Turks, who loot them when they refuse to give camels or supplies, and who, unlike the British, do not pay for what they take. The informant says that the prevailing opinion among the Arabs in the interior is that the Turks have ruined the Yemen by enter ing into the war. 3. A regrettable incident took place lately at Khokha, believed to be a friendly port, when H. M. S. “ Lama ” anchored off the place for the purpose of examining the dhows lying in the Khokha harbour. The ship’s steam cutter was fired upon by a hostile dhow from another tribe, as well as from men of another tribe from the shore who wounded two of the crew of the cutter of whom one subsequently died. The dhow escaped. The Shaikh, who was lately in Aden and had returned to Khokha only that day, came on board the “ Lama, ” but declared his inability to arrest the delinquents. He was, therefore, made a prisoner, and brought to Aden. After inquiry in the case, I am releasing the Shaikh, but prohibiting tentatively commerce from Aden to those ports. The Shaikh is a figure-head and powerless, but certainly inimical to the Turks. It has been our policy to win over such Arabs to our cause by allowing occasional dhows to ply there from Aden. A. B.

People who have recently arrived from Dala report that Saeed Bey, the Turkish Commandant at Lahej, has deputed some of the Amiri tribesmen to bring Amir Nasir to Lahej, and that the Amir’s youngest brother Ali will be in charge of the Amiri afiairs during the former’s absence in Lahej. 2. It is reported that a section of the Fadthli Tribe, called Ahl Haidara Mansoor, recently went to Saeed Bey at Lahej with sacrifices of cattle, and asked for his support against the Fadthli Sultan on the ground that the latter did not treat them well, and that Saeed Bey advised them to go on committing depredations on trade routes in the Fadthli country, especially the route leading to and from Aden, and promised to look into their grievance later. The Fadthli is said to be contem plating an expedition against this section, and to have already imprisoned his grand son for being in league with it.

They say that the Abdah s call for assistance reached them too late, otherwise they would certainly have given him material help. (This statement is untrue.) They further say they are prepared to prove their friendship to Government in deeds, and not by words : and propose a plan according to which Government must send to Yafa one or two of the most influential members of the Abdali family, to personally call in the aid of the Yafais, and take with them large quantities of arms and ammunition. Thus they are confident, the Abdali will be able to enlist the sympathies of the Yafais, who wnl then attack the Turks at Dala or Kataba, while simultane ously we take the onensive against Lahej. . These Shaikhs are loyal to us, being drawn to us by receipt of stipends. They might join us, if we were on the spot, but otherwise certainly not. The Yafai can never be trusted, this is mere lip-service. N.B .—Weekly letter No. 39, dated the 25th September 1915. No news to record. Dated Aden Residency, the 2nd (received the 12th) October 1915.

The Idrisi confiriiis the death of the Tnrco-Arab leader, mentioned in the last week’s letter, and states that he inflicted another defeat on the Turks, after an attack against their strongest position. He says that the Imam has already sent his forces to co-operate with the Turks against him. 2. It is reported from Perim that a reinforcement of 5,090 Tarks, including 100 German officers, has arrived at Taiz (Yemen) from Constantinople of which 3,000 have already left for Lahej, and that further reinforcements are on their way. Another report says that a reinforcement of 5,000 Arabs has arrived from Syria. I await confirmation. 3. One of the informants of the Assistant Resident, Perim, reports that the Shaikhs of Hashid wa Bakil have written to the Imam, protesting against his assisting the Turks, on the ground that the Arabs have nothing to gain by it, but on the contrary much to lose in the way of trade, etc., by opposing the English.

One Shaikh Fara Ahmed-el-Kotebi, who is not known to this Residency, writes from the Hinterland that after the capture of Lahej, the Turks wrote to several Shaikhs in the \emen, as well as Yafa (British), asking them to join them, but the former replied that being tax-payers, they naturally looked upon the Turkish Government to protect them. The Yafa Shaikhs, the writer says, did not send any replies at all. Our stipendiaries in the main are not likely actively to join the enemy. 2. The writer further reports that the Turks have enjoined upon the Haushabi Sultan to supply 3,000 fighting men, failing which he is threatened with imprison ment. If this is true, it will be impossible for the Haushabi to comply with such a demand, and he is said to have already fled to the Azraki country. His adhesion to the Turkish side was prompted largely by “ force majeure.” 3. Ahmed Fitini, one of the Shaikhs of the Zaranik near Hodeida, who lately arrived here reports that there are very few Turks at Hodeida ; and that the im habitants of Hodeida are in a wretched plight for want of foodjsu^Jies.

Fifty soldiers arrived from Sheikh Said on or about the 29th July 1915. Elias Bey came to Lahej with about 1,000 Arabs on the 3rd July 1915. There are three camps as follows :— (^) At Hait Saleh Saeed or Hait Abdul Hamid to the north of Lahej. This is the biggest of the three, where most of the guns are kept; (2) At Hait Mahomed Suwaibh to the north of Lahej ; (3) At Hait Am-al-Kafa’ to the east of Lahej. The total number of guns at Lahej are about 36, most of which are small ones. Patrols of ten men each are posted at Nobat Ayadh and A1 Mahela to prevent export of kirbee, etc., to Aden. ^ The Turks mistrust Arabs, especially the Subehis and others within the Aden Protectorate.

Abbas Hassan, the Abdali’s Town Overseer, who has lately arrived here, reports the following news. He has impaired eyesight, and so the news he has brought is largely gleaned from others :— were pushed up to meet the British attack, which was fully anticipated on hearing the firing at Shaikh Othman. The Shaikhs (Turkish), who accompanied the Turks in their attack on Lahej have left with their men for their homes to return after the Id. The Haushabi Sultan has also left, and taken away his gun, which was with the Abdali people. There are seven British prisoners at Lahej, one of whom is an European, and the rest are Indians. The latter are given their liberty to go about the town, but the Englishman is not seen out. The Turkish Commandant has ordered various Abdali sub-tribes to surrender their arms, and some of them have agreed to do so. On the night of the Turkish attack on Lahej, there was wholesale looting by the Turks and Arabs. After the third day, the Turkish Commandant, Saiyid Bey, stopped it, and collected all the grain in the Government godowns. Most of the grain, etc., has been sent to the Yemen ; also iron bars removed from houses, and sent up-country. Price of grain is rising in Lahej : Turkish soldiers are living on jowari. The Turks have given out a story that a German fleet is to attack Aden, and that as soon as the attack is made from the sea the Turks will attack from landward. 2. The Assistant Resident, Perim, sent one of his informants to the interior in June. He has now returned, and brought the following news :— (1) Muhammad Nasir Mukbil was not ready to join in with the Turks in their attack on Lahej, and was imprisoned, but has since been released. (2) Abdul Wahab is Qaim-Makam in Ahmed Noman’s place (vide paragraph 1 of Weekly Letter, dated 12th June 1915). A few days ago he received orders from the Wali at Taiz to arrange for the renewal of the bom bardment of Perim. He replied, that he did not wish to do so, as there were very few Britishers there, and the Arabs, whose number was larger, would be the sufferers. The matter has been referred to Constantinople. (3) In the recent fighting near Aden, the Turks tried to persuade the Arabs to make an attack on Aden, but the latter refused to do so, till the German fleet attacked it from the sea. (4) Reinforcements of 1,200 Turks passed through Taiz, en route to Lahej, about a week ago (i.e.,the third week of July). Four hundred of these were wearing Astrakan caps, and had dogs with them. (5) Three hundred and thirty-five Turks with three guns, under Ali and Abdul Effendi, are one day’s march from Shaikh Said. They are at present engaged in collecting taxes.

The following news has been received during this week from various sources :— 1. The Turks at Lahej have written to the Fadthli Sultan, asking him to stop all supplies from his country to Aden, failing which they threaten to overrun his country. They (Turks) have also invited all the Fadthli Sheikhs and Akils to come to Lahej with their arms. 2. Sheikh Abdurrab Shub’ain of A1 What (Abdali) intercepted a caravan coming to Aden, and carried it to the Turks at Lahej. It consisted of 6 camels, laden with fowls, eggs, etc., belonging to Turkish Arabs across the Subehi border. 3. Three hundred Arabs have arrived at Lahej, from Wadi Maadin, (Turkish) headed by Mahomed Ali Mokbil Al-Homaidi. 4. Letters have been written to the Dubeni Sheikhs (Subehis), asking them to come to Lahej at once with their clansmen, as the British troops are threatening to attack Lahej. They have replied, that they cannot come just now, as they have their irrigation work, but they will do so after the Id. 5. Abdul Wahab bin Saleh Ubeyid Al-Yamani was employed by the Turks to carry messages to the Subehis. His object in coming to Aden lately was to carry information to the Turks.

According to the informants of the Assistant Resident, Perim, there is much sickness among the troops at Shaikh Said, about five dying daily from dysentery. The Turks there are said to be also suffering from the climatic effects, and to be endeavouring to get Arabs to relieve them. 3. From the same source it is reported that a telegram from Sana’a was receiv ed at Shaikh Said on the 14th instant, asking for full details of the garrison, guns, forts and ships at Perim, and another was received on the 16th idem, stating that the Turks at Lahej will not assume the offensive, pending arrival of the reinforce ments from Sana’a, which had already started ; that all available camels round Moza have been collected, and are engaged in taking ammunition from Shaikh Said and Moza to Taiz ; also that every available Turk is being sent to Taiz, Arabs taking their places ; that Shaikh Nasir (Mukbil ?) is friendly to the British, and as long as he remains friendly, there is no fear of an attack on Perim ; that all I the Arabs of Dubab, Mocha, Moza, etc., would help the British, if the latter were to attack the Turks from that direction.

We are partially cut off from our Hinterland, but matters will shortly improve. It is difficult to gauge just now the attitude of our stipendiaries towards us, but their failure to help us is in no sense indicative of a bias towards the Turks.

Please see paragraph 2 of Weekly Letter, dated 12th June 1915. The Abdali has now ascertained the strength of the Turkish forces at Mawia which number, he says, about 600 men. The Turks are said to have asked all the Sheikhs in the Yemen to supply them 500 men each, fully equipped and provisioned by the Sheikhs themselves. 3. It is reported that a small number of Turkish Arabs have occupied Dar Ubada at Ad Darej a, in the Haushabi territory, and that the Haushabi Sultan has left his capital with his family and gone to Dabayat in the Amiri territory. The reasons for this are not known. 4. It is rumoured that the Turks have made Ibn Nasir Mukbil a prisoner in his house, as they suspect him to be in league with us, as also Haj Ali Nasir-al-Kamarani (the man who signed the agreement with us on behalf of Ibn Nasir Mukbil) whom the Turks have taken to Taiz.

Ibn Nasir Mukbil, who returned to Mawia (his headquarters) after the occu pation of Dala by his troops, is reported to be seriously ill. Two Turkish doctors are said to be in attendance. 3. Amir Nasir of Dala is reported to have been shot and wounded by one of his brothers. The wound is not serious. The cause of the outrage is not known. 4. The son of the Chief Sheikh of the Zaranik (a tribe in the vicinity of Hocleida) accompanied by a number of other Sheikhs have arrived at Aden. The object of their mission is to try and get themselves placed under the protection of the British Government. With the assurance of this and the necessary aid in money and munitions received from Government they are prepared to fight the Turks. The Zaranik tribe is always at loggerheads with the Turks, in whose side they are a thorn. 5. As I write the Haushabi Sultan has come in with news of the arrival at Mawia of a Turkish force estimated variously at from two to six battalions.^ The Abdali Sultan is sending out troops towards his border in consequence. It is not yet possible to judge of the true significance of this news. I Dated Aden Residency, the 12th (received the 19th) June 1915. Endorsed by the Political Resident, Aden.

The occupation of Dala by Turkish Arabs is reported to be in consequence of a night attack recently made on the Turkish camp at A1 Jalila in the Amiri territory. As the result of the attack, one Turkish soldier was killed, and two wounded. The identity of the attackers has not yet been definitely established, but the Amir’s party is suspected. The Haushabi Sultan writes that, after the occupation of Dala, all the Amiri Shaikhs and Akils went and saw Shaikh Mahomed Nasir Mukbil, who, however took from them seven hostages, in addition to the eight taken a month or two affo.' The Haushabi says he has heard that the Amir and his brothers with their famihes have left for the Kotaibi country, but other informants report that they are at Taf’wa in their own country.

There is no news to report this week, except that what is reported by a nalhuda of a dhow, lately arrived from the Idrisi port of Medi. The report is to the effect that 75 Germans dressed as Sharifs, were going from a place called El-Lieth (in Turkish Arabia) to Jedda, en route to Medina ; but that they were recognized, and attacked by some 13 Arabs of the tribe of Jud’an in the neighbourhood of Jedda. The Germans opened fire with their Maxim, and a fight ensued. Eventually the Turks, who heard the firing at Jedda went to the assistance of the Germans, thus enabling the latter to reach Jedda. The Germans and the Turks lost 2 officers with 3 soldiers, and 14 soldiers, respectively, and the Arabs 12 men. The Jud’an tribe would have given trouble to the Turks, but for the timely arrival of the Sharif of Mecca, who settled the matter by paying com pensation to the Jud’ans.

A well known merchant of Sana’a, Shaikh Muhammad bin Husain-al-Ammari, recently called on the Abdali on bis way to Aden. According to him the Turks are fast loosing their influence in the Yemen, their very existence there at the present moment depending entirely on the Imam. 2. The merchant told the Abdali that about two months ago 70 Germans landed at A1 Mandar, near Hodeida, of whom 30 were employed as soldiers at Hodeida, and the rest sent up to Sana’a; that about February last, some of the Yafa Akils with their followers—in all about 80 men—visited the Governor-General of the Yemen at Ibb, and returned after assuring the latter of their loyalty to the Turkish Government; that immediately after the return of the Yafais, a representative of the Haushabi Sultan, Amir Ali Ba Saleh Ba Hashim, accompanied by a clerk of Shaikh Muhammad Nasir Mukbil of Mawia, went and saw the Governor-General, and an agreement was signed on behalf of the Haushabi Sultan, declaring his allegiance and obedience to the Turkish Government. Inquiries will be made to find out the truth of this latter item, which sounds grossly exaggerated. 3. The merchant on arrival at Aden was interviewed. He said that, soon after the declaration of the war by the Turks, the Governor-General was keen to incite the Arabs to make an advance on our Protectorate, but the Imam and the other Shaikhs in the Yemen would not hear of it. 4. As regards the recent raid on Beda (vide paragraph 1 of Weekly Letter, dated 20th February 1915) he said that the raid was made by the Imam’s men without his sanction.

He compared the Turkish gun on Jabel Jihaf to “ an ice-cream machine.” The people of Dala, he said, are opposed to the Amir’s House, and want none of the family as Amir ; that Abdul Hamid (brother of the &gt; •v.i c • ~x • •• j 1 1 j_T 1 „ TT ^ ^ 2.

Two days after the Amir of Dala arrived at El Wa’ara (Amiri) with 15 Turks, and about 100 local and Turkish Arabs. On the 6th, 2,500 Zaidis (Imam’s soldiers) arrived at Kataba, and Sheikh Kayed Saleh was recalled. The object of these movements is not known, but it appears that the Zaidis, who behaved highly irreverently towards the Sharia creed, had to leave Kataba at the instance of the Kaim Makam, as the people were in great excitement, and trouble between them and the Zaidis was imminent. 3. The head Sheikh of the Zaranik, a tribe near Hodeida, has written letters,, | offering to fight against the Turks and to place himself under the protection of the British Government.

The people immediately raised a force of 1,000 strong, but the Turks on coming to know of it fled. The Beda people pursued them, killing ten, and wounding many. They also captured three camels laden with foodstuffs, some shells and tents. They expect the Turks to return again, and the headman of Beda asks for ammunition, and says that the Beda people will defend their country to the last. I have sent Beda ammunition. 2 . One of the four Sheikhs of Nawa, Ahmed Hasan, has come to Aden, and reports that one of his peers has submitted to the Turks, and has received a Turkish flag. He himself refused to comply with the Turkish summons. The Rubeaten Akils are also said to have been offered two Turkish flags, and to have accepted them, as they are powerless to resist the Turks. 3. Sheikh Mahomed bin Mohsin Askar Ali from Upper Yafa writes that AlTairi, a Turkish Sheikh, has sent letters to all the Akils in Upper Yafa, including himself, inviting them to Juban to discuss matters relating to the Jehad ; that some irres ponsible persons have gone to him, but that he (Sheikh Mahomed) replied A1 Tairi to the effect that he was a friend of the British Government, and that one man could not serve two masters at one and the same time. 4. Further reports have been received, confirming the ascent by the Turks of Jabel Jihaf, and other points within the domains of the Amir of Dala. Amir Nasir is still at Sanah, and in a letter, dated the 13th instant, writes to me that he allowed the Turks to enter his country, in order that they might assist him in keeping order, and maintaining security on the roads.

The Amir’s brother writes that the people of Dala are unable to offer any resistance to the invaders for want of arms and ammunition supplied to him by Government from time to time. He is asking Government to take immediate steps to oust the invaders, and to protect their borders. It is reported that the boundary pillars along the Amiri borders have been destroyed by the order oDthe Commander of Turkish Forces at Taiz. Please see paragraph ^ of last week’s letter.

Please see paragraph 1 of my last week’s letter. One of our news correspond ents at Dala, reports that the Amir of Dala and Sheikh Kayed Saleh, the Kaim Makam of Kataba, are at present at An-Nadira, in the Yemen, and' that it is rumoured in Dala, that the Imam has given to the Amir a force of 2,500 men, under the command of three of his lieutenants, and also a regiment of Turkish troops, and that they are expected to arrive at Kataba shortly. The correspond ent says that he has sent his brother to An-Nadira, with instructions to go and stay with the Amir, and Sheikh Kayed Saleh, and to find out the real facts. Another correspondent at Jabel Jihaf (Amiri), Saiyid Muhammad Taha, con' firms the Amir’s stay at An-Nadira, and adds that an arrangement has been made between the Amir and Sheikh Kayed Saleh, under which the former is to proceed to Sana’a in person, and ask for assistance in men, money, and munitions. Amir Nasr has written, declaring his innocence. I think his commerce with Kaim Makam of Kataba may be on the subject of inter-border disputes only, but we shall know the truth presently. Saiyid Muhammad Taha says that he himself has entered into a solemn engagement with his own people, the Jihafis, that they will resist any invasion on the part of the Turks. He says that the many reports spread by the Turks, which cannot be believed by sensible people, have been increasing of late. Dated Aden Residency, the 16th (received the 25th) January 1915.

Please see paragraph 1 of weekly letter, dated 26th December 1914. News received from various sources, confirms the intrigues with the Turks of the Amir of Dala, who is still reported to be on the Turkish side. His subjects fear lest he might advance on Dala, with Turkish troops. I have warned him that, if he does not cease to traffic with Turkish Arabs, and return forthwith to Dala, his stipend will be forfeited, and another recognised as Amir. 2. Sharif Abdul Rehman bin Husen of Saba (Marib) writes that there is a plentiful crop in the Yemen, and that the Imam and the Idrisi have patched up their differences, and are combined to resist the enemies of Turkey.

I bear that the Amir of Dala has married the daiigbter of a Turk at Kataba, and bas been staying there ever since, as be is afraid to return to Dala, lest bis brothers may kill him. 2. It is reported that the Turks have moved almost all their forces from Kataba to Sheikh Said, leaving a small garrison at the former place. ^ 3. A number of letters, received by the Abdali Sultan, from Subehi Sheikhs, show that Sheikh Ahmed No’man, and other Turkish Sheikhs are trying their best by offering monthly stipends, etc., to induce the Subehis our side the border to join the Turks. This is not likely to happen. 4. The Abdali Sultan has received news from one of his informants in the Yemen to the effect that orders have been given for the installation of a telegraph line in the Yemen, which will be extended towards Mavia, and that Sheikh Mahomed Nasir has been asked to despatch camels to Ta’iz for the transportation of telegraph wires, and to arrange for 500 poles. 5. His Majesty’s Ship “ Empress of Russia ” intercepted a dhow, carrying Abyssinian slaves to the Idrisi country. The slaves have been brought to Aden. The same ship caught and sank three dhows, carrying orders from the Turkish authorities to stop the working of lighthouses in the Red Sea. Another dhow, dying Italian colours, but having also Turkish colours in its possession, was intercepted by the same ship at Khoka (Turkish). The dhow had recently left Aden with a Port Clearance for Assab (Italian), and must have been smu^imv supplies to enemy country. She was seized, and was being towed to Aden, 'when she sank in rough weather. Her crew, and part of her cargo, was saved, and are now in Aden. A. B.

India, Fokeign Secrevagt'g No 1 .1, datedDated Aden Residency, the 5th December 1914. From—The Political Resident at Aden, T°' D. Robertson, Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay. The Abdali Sultan has sent me a strange letter, addressed to him by the Amir of Dala, in which the latter asks victory to the Ottoman G-overnment, who have waged war against us, and informs His Highness that the Turks have captured Cairo, blocked the Suez Canal, reinforced their fort at Babel-Mandeb with troops, and are advancing with strong forces against Aden. He adds that the Turks have heard * His Highness has given Rs. 8,000 towards that His Highness has given Rs. 50,000* the Imperial Relief Fund. to the British Government, and that when they come to Lahej, they will demand from His Highness double that amount. The Amir has been well fed with lies, which are circulated by Turks, and is panic striken, but I have written to him, warning him against giving currency to false rumours, and directly or indirectly espousing the cause of our enemy, and told him that he must take a saner and corrector attitude, and be prepared to defend his own borders against attacks, otherwise Government would stop his stipend, and cease to recognize him as Amir. 2. The Akrabi Sheikh has sent in a letter, addressed to him by Sheikh Ahmed Noman, accusing the English, and inducing him to make common cause with the Turks agaist the infidels. The Akrabi Sheikh has written me a letter, expressing his firm loyalty to the British Government, and enquiring whether he should send a reply to Ahmed Noman, expressing his disapproval of his (Ahmed Noman’s) action. I have sent the Akrabi a suitable reply, and asked him to send a reply to Ahmed Noman in terms thereof. 3. From the reports of the Assistant Resident, Perim, for the week ending 27th November 1914, the Turks appear to be very active about Sheikh Said, especially on a flat-topped hill, immediately south of Jabel Barika, and on the south ern slope of that hill, where, the Assistant Resident presumes, the Turks are constructing a gun emplacement, facing the Perim fort. The SS. “ Teenkai,” which passed Perim, outward bound, probably with pilgrims on board, reported to the Assistant Resident that Java pilgrims had all left, and that the Turks were fortify ing Jeddah, and making trenches. The pilgrims in Jeddah seem to be in a bad plight owing to the shortage of food stuffs, which are reported to be sold at exorbitant prices. I have asked Messrs. Cowasji, Dinshaw and Brothers to send 500 bags of flour and 500 bags of rice to Jeddah by the pilgrim ship “ Jelunga ” bound for Jeddah, and to sell the stuff to pilgrims on board at cost price. p His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Jeddah, Mr. Abdul Ragman, who went through Aden en route for Bombay, told me that the Agents of Pilgrims ship line had enhanced the cost of a single ticket from Jeddah to Bombay from Rs. 50 to Rs. 100, and that this was reduced to Rs. 75, at the instance of the Turkish Governor of that Port. If this is true, it is time that measures were taken to curb the rapacity of these Agents. 4. The Turks are evidently massing troops at three centres, and giving out Turba, Mavia, Ibb. that this a ‘jihad’. They are apparently not going to move, unless the Imam s forces join them. We have not yet heard from the Imam, as to his part in this business. He appears to be 44 sitting on the fence.” We may hear from him any day. There is a very influential, and on the whole a friendly Saiyid, Haj Ali al Kamarani, living on the border, with whom we are in communication. He says that Ibn the Turkish Arab Commander at Mavia, is averse to llagainst the British, but the Turks are bringing pressure to bear on him. written to this Commander, and it is possible he may not move his force at all. fighting We hav The people upcountry have been informed that the Aden gai rison is mobiliz ing, and I think they will await our attack, unless some fanatic succeeds in exciting them to make a forward movement. It is said by our news agent that many of the Arabs are defecting from the Turks. The Abdali Sultan writes that the force at Am Turba* is negligible, but that at Sheikh Said there have been brought •In Ahmed Noman J s territory. ^ large and 5 small guns by Ahmed Noman, who intends rebuilding the Fort, and gives out that when this is done, he will march towards Lahej and Aden. This latter is pure bluff. I think that, if any violation of our border is made, we should proceed against them. Were this done, this movement of Arabs would collapse. I hear from Yafai Chiefs that they will repel any Turkish invasion. Dated Aden Residency, the 5th(received the 16th) December 1914. Endorsed by the Political Resident, Aden.

The Abdali also reports that the Arabs who joined the Turks in the fighting were the people of Shaikh Ahmed Noman (vide paragraph 4 of Weekly Letter dated 24th ultimo), and that a brother of this Shaikh was present. It is reported that a large force has been collected by the Turks at Am Turba It is also rumoured in the Hinterland that Mahomed Naser Mukbil and Ahmed Noman with the Turks intend invading Lahej; that camels are being impressed by them for the conveyance of troops, etc., and that recruitment is going on on a large scale.

Robertson, Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay. Please see paragraph 3 of Weekly Letter, dated 10th instant, in which it was reported that the Sheikh of Mares had occupied the Amir of Dala’s fort at Sanah. It is now reported that the brother of the Amir, in return, proceeded to Husu-az-Zani’, and occupied the fort of the Sheikh of Mares there ; matters would have gone serious but for the timely intervention of Sheikh Kayed Saleh, the newly appointed Kaimakam of Kataba, and nephew of Sheikh Mahomed Nasir Muqbil Pasha. Sheikh Kayed is said to have settled the dispute, and the forts have been evacuated by both the parties. Our news correspondent at Jabel Jihaf, Saiyid Mahomed Taha, and other correspondents in Dala, report that several Shed :hs on either side of the border were invited by Sheikh Kayed Saleh, who received them in a friendly spirit, and impressed upon them the necessity of more friendly relations amongst them for the mainte nance of peace in their territories. He is said to have given them presents. The Abdali writes that he has learnt that the Amir of Dala also called on Sheikh Kayed, and that they have mutually undertaken to maintain peace, and protect travellers in their territories, and to hold themselves responsible for the acts of their respective subjects, and to compensate sufferers. The action of Sheikh Kay T ed Saleh may seem unusual, but it must be remembered that Arabs on both sides of the border have for y^ears before our advent on the scene been used to meet, and arrange matters, without reference to their respective Gov ernments. On this special occasion this action may have been prompted by honest motives to check the ill-feeling, consequent, on the dispute between the Sheikh of Mares and the Amir of Dala, or it may have been the outcome of the restless ness of the Turks. I think the former is the real reason. i P 2. The death is reported of Sheikh Ali Mani As-Saqladi, a stipendiary Sheikh of Shaaib (Upper Yafa). 3. The Abdali Sultan has received news to the effect.that a Turkish Staff officer, accompanied by four other officers, and by a brother of Sheikh Ahmed No’man, visited the border in the direction of Ad-Dareja in the Haushabi territory. This officer is reported to have climbed the summit of the hill of Mavia (Turkish), and surveyed all the country around. 4. The same brother of Sheikh Ahmed No’man, named Sheikh Abdul Wasa’ Noman, paid a visit to the Abdali Sultan on the 20th instant, with an introductory letter from Sheikh Ahmed No’man. This gentleman is well acquainted with all Turkish movements in Yemen, and the Abdali Sultan gleaned the following infor mation from him :— (1) The staff officer and four officers mentioned above visited Mokha and Shiikh Said in July, travelled through the Hajaria district on our border, and are near Ad-Dareja and its vicinity to inspect strong positions on the hills there. (2) The object of the interview of the Governor-General of the Yemen with *Vide Weekly Letter dated 3rd October 1914. ^ Imam * was to ask the latter for help in men, and co operation in other directions in case of need. The Imam is said to have promised to send 500 of his men to our border, but owing to the assistance promisedf by Sheikh Mahomed Nasir Maqbil fFirfe last week’s letter. Sheikh Ahmed No man, this assistance was waived temporarily. The Imam, however, promised to strengthen the Sheikh Said fort.2 (3) When Ahmed No’man, the Kaimakam of the Hajaria district, and V ^ Sheikh Mahomed Nasir, the Kaimakam of the Kama’ira, were summoned to Taiz, and offered the post of Governor of Taiz, Sayed Ahmed Shira’i of Taiz was simultaneously invited, under the instruc tions of the Governor of the Yemen. It was arranged with them that they should take upon themselves to protect the frontiers in the event of their disapproving of the sending of a Turkish garrison to the frontiers. They have been directed to make complete pre parations, and be ready with their Arab tribesmen at the shortest notice. The aforesaid Sheikhs and the Sayed undertook to comply with this request, but asked for assistance in ammunition and 1 supplies. The Government consented to supply them with the same, and have issued orders allocating about 400,000 rounds. The Sheikhs were informed that when the occasion arose, supplies from abroad might cease, and they must then try to help themselves, though the Government would do their best to help them. (4) There are two regiments of Turkish troops, with all their military equip ment, and full complement of artillery at Taiz, ready to proceed shortly to Sheikh Said. The Abdali says that Sheikh Abdul Wasa made enquiries about the present condition of Aden, the temper of the people, our preparations for defensive and offensive operations, to which the Abdali gave very apt and diplomatic replies, proving his loyalty to the British Government, 5. The following is the gist of a report from a correspondent at Hodeida :— (1) The Mutasarrif of Hodeida received orders on the 17th September 1914 to disburse half pay to all Government officials during the continu ance of the war. (In this connection please see Weekly Letter, dated 3rd October 1914.) (2) The Turks have notified to all foreigners in Hodeida the increase in the levy of customs dues at 15 per cent, on all exports. (3) On the 7th instant a meeting was held at the Government House at Hodeida, at which one of the Members of the Turkish Parliament read a speech, advocating the training of school boys in the use of fire arms, and for service as volunteers in the defence of their land. The audience consisted of the Mutasarrif, Chiefs, Members of the Turkish Parliament, and other prominent men of the place. There was a band, which played at intervals. The boys have already been armed, and were marched through the town. (4) Abundant supply of grain continues to come in from the interior, and the Yemen is in full prosperity at the present time. There is no need of grain from outside. (5) Government are busy with war preparations. After the withdrawal of the gunboats from the Eed Sea, they have removed the troops station ed at the Parsan Islands, together with all the materials including guns. These were brought to Hodeida and, subsequently despatch ed to Sheikh Said, along with other war materials sent from Taiz. The fact that guns, etc., have been sent from Taiz to Sheikh Said is confirmed by an informant of the Abdali Sultan. The Assistant Resident, Perim, also writes that the Turks have brought long-range guns to Sheikh Said, and that the Telegraph office there is seen to be occupied by Turkish soldiers.

Also that he has heard from Members of Parliament returned from Constantinople that thousands of Turks are alreadv fighting in the 5 German ranks.

Customs dues at Hodeidah and other ports have been raised to 15°/ and the monies collected go in moiety towards pay of the troops. This will encourage smugglers, more especially since the Turks have raised the blockade of the Asyr ports.41st Weekly Letter. Dated Aden Residency, the 17th October 1914. From—The Political Resident at Aden, To—L. Robertson, Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay. The Abdali Sultan writes that he has received information from a reliable source of the intention of Turks to move troops towards the frontier of our Pro tectorate, but two of their most important Sheikhs, Mohamed Naser Muqbil a$d Ahmed No’man, expressed their disapproval of this movement, but un- f willingly undertook to co-operate with the Turkish authorities against us in case of necessity. It appears that the Turkish Government also offered both these chiefs in succession the post of Mutasarif of Taiz, but the offer was declined in each case, the Sheikhs apparently fearing to move away from their own spheres of influence. These are two important men on the Turkish side, but it is believed | they are not overloyal to the Turkish cause. Dated Aden Residency, the 17th (received 27th) October 1914.

One of the Yusifis (Subehi), named Fugaishbin Saleh am'Tholtain, who was implicated in the murder of our Postal runner at Sheikh Othman in 1906, is said to have been killed in an attempt to loot a caravan going from Aden. Fugaish it appears, accompanied by others of his tribe, waylaid the caravan and killed three men. The caravan men fired, killing Fugaish. 3. The state of affairs in the Amiri country does not appear to be very satis factory at present. This is, apparently, due to the inability of the Amir to exercise any real control over his own brothers and tribesmen. One of his brothers is reported to have detained goods belonging to Turkish subjects of Mares and others. The Sheikh of Meris, after having failed in his endeavours to recover the goods, is said to have occupied the Amir's fortlet at Sanah. The Sheikh of Shaaib reports that he is endeavouring to bring about a settlement between the parties. 4. The Haushabi complains that the Amir of Dala has not respected the truce concluded at Lahej {vide my Weekly Letter dated 4th July 1914, paragraph 2) as the raids of Ahl Hasan of A1 Haiq (a section of the Ahmadi tribe under the Amir) on the Haushabis have not ceased. The Sultan is threatening to attack them. The Abdali has also written to me expressing his displeasure at the conduct of the Amir. I have addressed the Amir on the subject, and trust that matters will improve. 5. The Sheikh of the Muflahi Section of Upper Yafa writes that there is every likelihood of a settlement between Sultan Omar bin Kahtan and his uncle. In this connection, it will be remembered that Government have withheld recognition of Sultan Omar, as our nominee in Upper Yafa, pending his rehabilitation. 6. Fighting is reported to have ceased between the Imam and the Idrisi. In this connection, please see my last week’s letter. It is rumoured that the Imam is sending an Arab army to the coast. 7. A local correspondent reports that news from Hodeida indicates prepara tion for war. Earthworks are being thrown up at Hodeida, and ammunition is being stored at places some miles distant from the coast. Movements of troops are reported from Asir to Hodeida and Jeddah. 8.

The following is the gist of a report, dated 22nd September 1914, from a corre spondent at Hodeida :— The Governor-General of the Yemen paid a visit to the Imam lately, and held an interview with him. It is certain that the Governor-General is now tonring in the Province of Taiz and adjacent districts. The object of this tour is said to be an important one, viz., the raising of a National Army. The Porte have sent telegrams to both the Imam and the Idrisi, asking them to cease fighting. The three gunboats, which were blockading the Idrisi ports, have been with drawn, and two big cruisers, which came to Hodeida lately, have been recalled to Constantinople. The Porte have notified to all their servants throughout the Empire, includ ing the Yemen, that during the continuance of the war, they will only disburse them half their pay, and that those who object to it will be dismissed from the service. There has been a heavy rainfall throughout the Yemen, and, consequently, the cost of grain has fallen from $ 11J to $ 7J. The new grain pro duct is expected to be out in about a fortnight. Orders from the Minister for Finance in Constantinople have been received prohibiting the export of Turkish and other sovereigns and gold bars to any foreign country under the penalty of confiscation. 2. Please see paragraph 4 of my Y eekly Letter dated 22nd August 1914. The Sultan of Mokalla has sent me a letter from the Chief of Bir Ali, reporting to him that a German (?) warship appeared there on the 23rd September, and that a boat went out, and tried to hold a conversation with the Chief. On the latter prevaricating and saying that his people were in the interior, and would not come to the coast till the month of November, the officers departed saying that they would come back to make arrangements with them. This from a subsequent enquiry is believed to be untrue. 3. The Italian mail steamer “ Porto Said ” arrived here the other day with 9 Germans on parole from British East Africa, and a German missionary and an Austrian labourer from the Italian Somaliland, on board. They were allowed to proceed in accordance with the orders of the Government of India, as a mail ship is considered a public vessel. The steamer sailed for Genoa.

Robertson, Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, The Audali Chief has come in to Aden to sign the Protectorate Treaty, approv ed by Government, and will then proceed on a pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. The Beda Chief has sent a letter to me couched in a somewhat independent and importunate tone. He states that, unless I can promise to pay his stipend, commencing from his last visit to Aden, and to give him 100 rifles with ammunition, 2 cannons and gun-powder, he will not sign the Treaty. I have not replied to his letter, and propose to remain silent, until I can know more about his real intentions. In the meantime, I would invite your attention to my letter No. C.-326, dated 18th July 1914. 2. The Haushabi Sultan came in to Aden yesterday to sign the Treaty about the safety of the Aden-Dala road. The Kotaibi promised to come in to sign his Treaty after the Ramadan Id, but he has not yet turned up. 3. Pldase see paragraph 3 of the Weekly Letter of the 22nd August, and the Weekly Letter of the 29th August, in which I reported on the professions of loyalty tendered by the Protected Chiefs. It would have been a good thing if, as requested in my telegram of 11th instant, a recognition of this loyalty had been publicly made, as has been done with regard to Indian Chiefs. From a telegram, dated 18th September 1914, received from Foreign, Simla, it appears that our intimation regarding the Arab Chiefs arrived too late for announcement. 4. M. Roux, the French Consul at Hodeida, reports that there is a pro-German feeling in that part, and the wildest rumours are circulated as to the losses of the Allied Forces. He remarks, however, that the ‘ hoi polloiand the merchants generally sympathise with Great Britain and France. Turkish gun-boats are active between Djazan and Mokha capturing sumbuks. 5. The Turks are said to be enrolling a national army of Arabs at Sana'a and are paying the men $ 12. The Government have forbidden the export of food stuffs to foreign ports, and also the export of gold. The Maria Theresa dollar has fallen in value, and notes are not negotiable.

The Senior Naval Officer now in Aden says tffis is cleariy the Komgsberg and three armed German merchantmen. These have left Burum and were on the 10th August at Kuria Muria Islands (under this Residency) £ would appear they have colliers there, and after going out for prizes the “ Konigs- berg returns to Kuna Mum to call. Our warships do not frequent this coast which is outside the usual steamship trade route. All this has been cabled to Admiral, and I merely quote it to urge upon Government the necessity of having a British warship permanently in the waters of Aden and the Arabian Sea to s W the white ensign. The Sultan of Mokalla asks when he may exneet to Z™ British warship there. It was the absence of our frequent visits to this coast that opened the way, some two years ago, to the Italian armed dhows which patrolled that sea-board continuously in the fair season, and seeing vast possibilitfes there the Italians made the proposal to plant a radio station at Mokalla.

I cannot write too stronglv on this point. This Hadramaut littoral is the weakest spot in our Arabian Protectn rate. Gennan warships can at this time go there with impunity and are going there.

A correspondent from Hodeida reports that a formidable force of the Imam of Sana a under his Lieutenant Abu Naib occupied Jabal Razeh An Nadir and Art daTa (which places are about six hours distant from Abu Arishand Sabiaiaftar inflicting a heavy loss on the Idrisi force. The latter is said to have imprisoned hZ Lieutenant charged for treason. r It is reported that the Idrisi recently received money in gold but the souren from which it came is not knqwn : it is probably Italian. 2S India, Foreign Secretary'! No 36 M, dated 3 SEP 19142 I attach copies of two letters, Nos. 107 and 119 dated 1st and 19th August 1914, from the Abdali Sultan giving some information about the Imam and his relations with the Turks, etc. 6 The Hodeida correspondent reports that two warships have been sent to Hodeida lately from Constantinople at the request of the Governor-General of the y^men in addition to the four gunboats which are already there for the defence of the coast and for maintaining the blockade of the Idnsi s ports of Jaizan Ma.di and Habil and that another warship is expected shortly He also writes thattwo Turkish regiments have been ordered by the Governor-General of Yemen to pro ceed from Sana’a to Hodeida on the coast. It is also believed at l erun that the Shaikh Said Fort is being quietly reinforced by men and munitions. The British Vice-Consul at Hodeida fomplains that the Turks do not deliver his telegrams for days together, and it is reported from another source that orders have been issued to send telegrams in French only. It would seem that the Turks are maintaining a strict censorship. 7 The trade of Aden is practically at a standstill, but there is no excitement among the people who seem to be watching the events calmly. Leading men of all communities were invited to the Residency Office and the necessity of measures taken bv the Military were explained to them. They expressed their satisfaction and confidence in Government. Everything possible has been done to exercise supervision over the foreigners and strict surveillance is maintained over the few Germans and Austrian subjects at present m Aden. Three German and one Austrian merchant ships have been detained m Aden and will shortly be brought before the Prize Court. Dated Aden Residency, the 22nd (received the 31st) August 1914. Endorsed by the Acting Political Resident, Aden. Copy forwarded, with compliments, to the Deputy Secretary to the Govern ment of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. No. 107, dated the 9th Ramadan 1332 (1st August 1914). From— Sultan Ali bin Ahmed bin Ali, the Abdali, To— Lieutenant-Colonel H. F. Jacob, Acting Political Resident, Aden. After compliments, We have received your letter No. C.-326, dated 24th July 1914, and in reply we inform you oh friend, that when the time became propitious we began and have taken in hand the matter of establishing our relation with the Imam. We addressed him with a letter in the month of Rajeb 18th, 1332 (June 12th,.1914) an sent it via land. We are awaiting the reply thereto ; but during the present week Sayed Mohamed Ali Sharif has arrived on behalf of and at the instance of Imam with a view of strengthening the relation and for feeling the attitude we maintain towards him. We conversed with Sayed Mohamed about the news of Turkish Arabia and learnt the following :— (1) The country of Sham in which Saidan, Saada, Saqin and Razeh are comprised and which was attacked and occupied by the Idrisi has been re-taken by the Imam. Peace and security have established there and the Imam kept there his men with 1,200 Turkish soldiers together with guns, etc., to look after the defence of the place. (2) At the end of Raieb (June), Sharif Husen bin Khudan and Shaif Ali bin Khudan, together with several \ idrisi followers now joined imam. Sharifs residing in Bani Mar- van and Belad Mistaba in the vicinity of Tehama, have paid a visit to the Imam. These Sharifs were in past time in the service of the Idrisi as Lieutenants of his army and helpers. Subsequently, however, they seceded and joined the Imam. They applied for men and assistance against theMistaba and the Bani Marvan country. The Imam prepared an y. expedition on that very day and despatched it under the leadership of Kadi Mohamed bin Saad Ash-Sayie and Syed Kasim bin Imam A1 Hadi with an adequate force. Two guns have also been attached to the expedition. The result of the success of this expedition is not yet known, but a letter to the aforesaid Sayed Mohamed was received from the Imam in which it was stated that the force in question has succeeded in subjugating five tribes of that country. (3) The advent of Mohamed* Nadim to Lohia and his frequent visits to Jaizan and Hodeida was to bring off some negotiation between the Idrisi and himself. He (Sayed) does not know the issue. In the * „ „ , middle of Shaban (end of June), however, the Imam has received a letter from Mohamed Nadim at Suwaida near Amran (in which place the Imam intends to spend the summer season) informing him (Imam) that he will wait on him while going to Sana’a. (4) The Sayed (Mohamed Ali Sharif) states that something has occurred between them (Nadim and the Imam) which displeased the latter. That is to say when peace terms for the restoration of the Turkish captives with the Imam were arranged a special condition was made to the effect that should necessity arise for the service of officers and men, the Sana’a Government (Turkish) should supply the Imam with such numbers as he may want. When he (Imam) marched to restore order in Sham, he applied to Turkish Government to furnish him with a force of 2,000 men and officers. When the disturbances sub sided the Government have recalled 500 men which were duly sent back ; then 300 men additional were recalled and sent. Finally the rest of the force was recalled, but the Imam has up to the present time declined to permit them to go and on this account his mind has rankled. (5) The Imam received complaints from the Taiz district against the Turkish officials on score of oppression and ill-treatment done to some of the Imam’s subjects. His (Imam’s) intention is to depute a committee to enquire into the causes of grievances and to meet with force. (6) The Sayed is pressing me (Sultan) very hard to get him by hook or by crook a man who can manufacture best quality gun powder and at any cost asked. He is pressing strongly for the same. No. 119, dated the 28th Ramadan 1332 (19th August 1914). From— Sultan Ali bin Ahmed bin Ali, the Abdali, To —Colonel H. F. Jacob, Acting Political Resident Aden. After compliments, We have received your letter No. C.-488, dated 14th August 1914, and in reply we inform you that there is probability that the compact between the Turks and the Imam will continue, on the other hand there is fear that it might fall through. 1. Its continuance hinges on the attitude of the Turkish officials towards the Imam, and so long as they follow the footstep of Mahmood Nadim (the present Governor) there is likelihood of its lasting. The aforesaid Wali is serving the wishes of the Imam more than the provisions of the convention, so much so that he (Governor) by his behaviour has incurred the displeasure of the Turkish officers. We know this for certain as all the Mutassarifs and Qaim Maqams generally pass by us on their way back from Yemen. We gathered from them the same informa tion, in addition to that we have obtained from the Imam’s emissary. In the event of a new Governor being appointed and, if he be particularly of the “ Liberal ” party and ignorant of the character of the Arabs in Yemen, there will be disagree ment between the two and difficulties will instantaneously arise.■pri w j* 1 mT .1 P j * j r j f| ^ J iLLiL • 11 im 2. The Turks are desirous to conclude a fresh compact with the Idrisi. Espe cially at the present condition of affairs Mahmood Nadim is anxious to make a settle ment with the Idrisi, and he is not reluctant to recognise certain rights of the Idrisi qua Suzerainty, for the purpose of stopping the troubles and difficulties which have been going on, and for taking rest—for the time being—from pursuing the Idrisi, They (Turks) have considerable advantage in this. Yet they mostly are sure that concord between the Imam and the Idrisi is impractica ble, unless by subjugating the one and causing him to surrender to the other. This is, however, a remote possi bility, and thus the disturbance will continue and keep the Imam and Idrisi engaged one with another while Government remain on the safe side. At any rate Mahmood Nadim is watching the time for the conclusion of the settlement by means of obtaining the previous consent of the Imam, because it is expected that if any settlement is made without the participation of the Imam, the fate of the former compact (Twixt Turk and Imam) is doomed. We therefore have formerly hinted to you about the intention of Mahmood Nadim that on his return from Lohia and Jaizan he will call on the Imam. 3. There is great difficulty in satisfying the Imam on this subject, because it does not very well suit him on points of the Zaidi creed, rather than in matters of politics. From political point of view, too, the Imam claims that Sabia and its dependencies, in which the Idrisi has extended his sway, originally belonged to his fathers and forefathers who used to depute the Sharifs of Az-Zahra as Governors on their behalf at Harad and at Sabia and till the power of Turkey became predomi nant in Yemen, and most of the country had surrendered to the Turkish yoke. Though this portion of the country was amongst those which surrendered, yet the Ashraf still maintained their relations with, and subordination to, the Imam. When the Power of Turkey began to decline, the relations between the Ashraf of the country of Az Zahra, Harad, Sabia and these parts became publicly manifest, and so the Idrisi visited this country in the guise of a Darwesh and preacher. He succeeded in winning the hearts of the Ashraf who became hi ssupporters and rebelled against the Imam. Some of them though have since returned and joined the Imam. On this particular account he (Imam) could never now condescend to admit the claims of Suzerainty of the Idrisi over that district. We have received a communicated news to the effect that the forces which advanced in the month of Rajeb—about which we had informed you in our letter No. 107, dated 9th Ramadan—have taken possession of Bilad Harad—about half a day’s journey from Sabia—Confirma tion in writing of this bit of qews is awaited. From the religious point of view the Zaidi creed is notably known to be sub missive to one Imam who ought to be the descendent of the pedigree of Zaid bin Ali bm A1 Husen, whom they call the Commander of the Faithful. Whoever shall deviate from his orders shall be treated as disobedient, and infidel and devoid of the faith. It is ever binding on them to fight such a one. They are particularly con- ^e Idrisi is not a Moslim and feel doubtful of his acts and religious beliefs. For these reasons it is illegal and even impossible for them to become his friends according to their religious principles. They treat him as an outlaw who usurped a country claimed by the Zaidis to be the property of the Imam, unless he repent and surrender to the Imam. The difficulty in bringing about a compact between the two (Idrisi and the Turk) without the approval of the Imam lies here. Ihe will or God, however, predominates over all opinions. There is a limited time of ten years to the compact between the Turks and the fmam commencing from 1329, and on its termination it will be either renewed or abolished. We realize that the Imam is conserving during this period his power tor future contingencies. The emissary of the Imam, Sayed Mahomed bin Ali Sharif, will be going back to his country soon. If you have leisure and wish to see him we can hint to him the same. G. M. Press, Sjm]a.-No. C. 381 F. D.—2-9-14.—16.—C. W. M fereto Secrete r ®iou sSECRET. «ai V- 'v... . J 31st Weekly Letter.

The brothers of the Amir of Dala are reported to be dissatisfied with the latter’s rule, and to have started levying taxes independently at Al-Tafwa. They declare that so long as he continues his high-handedness, they will not submit to him. The Amir, who was in Aden, left yesterday. I carefully instructed him to put matters straight. We relied on him as a stipendiary to do the needful and to be conciliatory. 2. Please see paragraph 2 of Weekly Letter, dated 4th July 1914. The Abdali Sultan reports that after great difficulty, and much expense to himself in entertaining the parties for days together, he had brought about a settlement of the Haushabi- Amiri dispute, but that the Amir has not been able to carry out his obligations, and the matter is still hanging fire, much to the discontent of the Haushabi.

Reports having been received that the Ahl-Yehia (who are related to the Haushabi Sultan) were levying unauthorised dues at a place called Sailat-Bilah, the Abdali Sultan was Asked to investigate the matter and bring some pressure to bear on the Haushabi Sultan. News has just been received that the Ahl-Yehia have withdrawn the taxes in consequence of the Abdali ’s intervention. 2. It is reported that a riding camel of the Amir of Dthala, who was the guest of the Abdali Sultan lately, was stabbed by a soldier of Sultan Abdal Majid, brother of the late Sultan, Sir Ahmed Fadthl. Sometime before this, a camel of Shaikh J Moqbil Abdulla, the Kotaibi was also killed. These acts are believed to be the out come of intrigues on the part of the late Sultan’s family. 3. The Amir of Dthala has come to Aden, so also the Alawi Shaikh, Ali Nasir, and one of the Dthubi Shaikhs named Omer Muthana. There is a very large in flux of Shaikhs this year to our guest house. 4. A correspondent from Hodeida reports that the people of Farsan Islands (Turkish) have subscribed a sum of £220 towards the construction of a Turkish battleship. ^ 5. The blockade of the Turkish ports referred to in paragraph of last week’s letter is reported to have now been made more effective and that in conse quence the prices of foodstuffs have risen. r 6. A grain mill is reported to have arrived from Constantinople with two en gineers, for Sana’a. It was shipped in a French boat to Mokha whence it will be conveyed to Sana ’a. 7. Owing to scarcity of rain famine conditions are prevalent in the Yemen and other parts of Southern Arabia. People are chiefly dependent on food stuffs imported from India at exorbitant prices. 8. An Aden dhow bound for certain Turkish ports was attacked and looted by Zaranik pirates (Turkish Arabs). The merchants concerned have made representations which have been sent to His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Hodeida as usual. With reference to this incident our Hodeida correspondent writes that Shaikh Ali Kashi of Ghulaifqa went to Hodeida and reported the incident to the Mutasar- rif and asked him to send a gun boat to co-operate with him in recovering the goods from the pirates.

A correspondent writes from Hodeida that the Turkish Governor-General of Yemen has invested both by land and sea the country under the influence of the Idrissi and that he is directing the operatic ns in person. 3. The same correspondent writes that the Imam has withdrawn his judges from Sana’a as the people were not satisfied with the decisions given according to the Zaidi doctrine. It appears that the Imam has discretly yielded to the wishes of the people, who now resort to Turkish Courts in cases of disputes between the Hanafi and Shaf’i sects. 4. It is reported that the Italians and Abyssinians are fighting on the border land over some salt rights and that the Italian Commissioner left on the 25th ultimo for the Abyssinian border with a small force. 5. The Assistant Resident, Perim, has received a report from an old Arab, who formerly used to run the mails between Aden and Perim, that the French at D’Jibouti sent one Suleman Kulail in a dhow to Mocha witha view to bribe one Ali Jabi who is believed to have much influence in that quarter and that they are anxious to re-acquire the influence they had about fifty years ago in this part of the country. I have received other reports about the activity of the French at Hodeida. It is believed that they have established a Consulate there instead of a Vice-Consulate and that the Consul is doing his best to gain influence with the Turkish officials there. It is also said that it is contemplated to have a regular French steamer service between D’Jibouti, Hodeida, and Aden and some.trials have already been made by the S.S. Tadjoura which carries the mails between Aden and D’Jibouti. It is reported that one Mons. Biskey has already had conferences on the subject with the Turkish authorities and the local merchants and that he has proceeded to France to form a Company. It is further reported that the same gentleman has obtained a concession for building a condenser and ice factory at Hodeida. Dated Aden Residency, the 13th (received the 23rd) June 1914.

Saiyid Muhammad Taha, our news correspondent at Jabel Jihaf, reports that famine is increasing in the Hinterland and consequently disorder, thefts and acts of depredation are rife all through the country and more particularly on the trade route between Dthala and Lahej. The Saiyid further states that rain has recently fallen in Jabel Jihaf and that floods have caused considerable damage to many villages in the country. 2. Shaikh Husen Saleh, the Azraki, reports that the Amir of Dthala has sent an expedition against an Ahmadi Shaikh named Husen Saleh of Ma’zaba and reduced him to subjugation. A numbr of Haushabis there took the part of the Shaikh, but without success. The Azraki further reports that the Kotaibi is behaving very badly on the Hardaba route, plundering travellers and imposing transit dues at the rate of Re. 1 and annas 4 per load. 3. The Assistant Resident, Perim, reports that several bungalows have left the Gulf of Tadjurrah lately and picked up cargoes of slaves near Shaikh Sayun (on the French Somali Coast opposite to Perim), conveying them to Red Sea Arbian ports.

Reports have come from various sources and also from the Abdali Sultan that Mokbil Abdalla, the nephew of the Kotaibi Sheikh, Ijas stopped a caravan of 95 camels laden with merchandise going northward and detained the goods at A1 Thomair. This is believed to be the outcome of a personal disagreement between Mokbil Abdalla and the Amir of Dthala, arising out of money dealings. The Kotaibi Sheikh has been asked to restore the goods and re-open the route, and warned that such attitude on the part of his nephew is regarded unfriendly and will be detrimental to his prospects with regard to the enhanced stipend recently, sanctioned by Government. 2.

Sultan Ali bin Ahmed bin Ali, the newly elected Abdali Sultan, is at pre- * 403 in all sen t in Aden with a large following* of relatives and tribesmen, on an official visit to this Residency. This is his first visit and he is being hospitably treated. It seems he is very popular with the tribesmen, and, so far as present indications go, he appears to be quite loyal to Government and inclined to work harmoniously. 2. The Fadthli Sultan is also here on his way to Bagdad on a pilgrimage. He reports that he has settled the long-standing claims of certain Yafais who had suffered during the disorders mentioned in the Weekly Letters of the 30th August and 6th September 1913 ; this settlement has been brought about after a long correspondence between this office and the Sultan. 3. The Government Guest House is at present overflowing with the stream of visitors constantly pouring into it. The Arab [is a professional beggar, but it is difficult to refuse him admission, as he vents his rage on the first caravan that he finds on the trade route to Aden. The Abdali’s large following, too, is according to custom and Precedent and will entail a heavy demand on the grants for Durbar Presents and : Entertainment, necessitating a supplementary allotment before the close of the year. 4. Please see the Weekly Letter of the 4th ultimo. The Amir of Dthala declines the mediation of the Abdali Sultan with regard to the Ahmedi country which he claims to be his own. He has again been advised to submit his claims for investigation by the Abdali and the latter has been asked to go carefully into the matter. 5. Certain sections of the Jorabis (Subehis) have been giving trouble on the trade routes, attacking and plundering wayfarers. The Abdali Sultan has pro mised to give his attention to them. 6. The Assistant Resident, Perim, has received reports of the arrival at Mocha of some French Engineers who are stated to be surveying for a railway to the interior. It is possible the party is the same as that mentioned in paragraph 3 of the Weekly Letter of the 28th March last. 7.

Reports of frequent interruptions on the trade route by the Dthambaris (Haushabi tribesmen) have been continuously coming for some days past. The Abdali Sultan has been negotiating with the Haushabi Sultan to make good the losses sustained by the travellers and to maintain order within his territory. 2. The Assistant Resident, Perim, reports that he heard from more than one source that about 3rd April a buggalow from Tadjourah (French Somaliland), with 50 slaves on board, grounded near Assab. The slaves escaped and the crew disappeared. . • 3. I have received the following news from Hodeida :— Mahmood Nadim Bey, Governor-General of Yemen, came to Hodeida last week. After his arrival a disagreement took place among the Shaikhs of Abs, half of whom are attached to the Idrisi and the other half to the Turkish Govern ment. Yehya bin Tawah, the leader of the former party, collected his men and with two cannons supplied by the Idrisi attacked and defeated Shaikh Mukbil Zayed and Saiyid Hadi bin Ahmed al Haij. The Turkish Commandant, stationed at Al-Wahdthat, on hearing of the battle, went with troops and cannons to the scene of battle and completely routed the adherents of the Idxisi. This officer, whose name is Raf at Bey, instead of being rewarded for his zeal, was suddenly dismissed and ordered to go to Constantinople for trial. The Governor-General of Yemen has ordered two regiments fully equipped to proceed to Al-WaTdthat, intending himself to follow them by sea to Lohia. The general opinion is that the Idrishs power is much weakened at present and that should an expedition be directed against him, he will be easily vanquished. Famine is reported to be prevailing in his country. Dated Aden Residency, the 25th April (received the 2nd May) 1914. Endorsed by the Political Resident, Aden.

It is reported that some ill-feeling has arisen between Sheikh Mohamed Naser Mokbil and the Imam owing to a supposed attempt on the former's life by the latter's Zaidi troopers. Consequently the trade route is practically blocked as the Zaidis are afraid of coming down southwards and Mohamed Naser's people do not dare to go towards the north of Yemen. 2. The Fadthli and Audali Chiefs have sent to this Residency letters addressed to them by a certain commandant of the Imam, 'named Saiyid Ahmed Naser Ar Rownel. The purport of the letters is that the Imam, on hearing of the disorders prevailing in the easterly countries ruled by the Shaf'i Mohamedan Chiefs, has resolved to send his emissary with a small party of troops to instruct the Chiefs to behave righteously, pay the lawful tithes as commanded by religion, and to recog nise the Imam as the Chief sovereign and leader of the faithful Mohamedans. The above Chiefs have been thanked for their action and informed that, if the letters are genuine, they must have been sent with a view to ascertain their attitude towards the Imam, and that, the latter being engaged in fighting with the Idrisi, there was hardly any possibility of his coming against them. 3. A party consisting of the following foreigners 1 Baron de Breuil, 2 Paul Marcheret (Banker), 3 Tenassier (Explorer), 4 Bayard (Explorer), 5 St. Martin (Engineer), 6 Joseph Metont (Interpreter), has arrived in Aden with the intention of going to Djibouti and thence to Mocha.

This report confirms the truth of the denial made by Shaikh Ahmed No'man of having trespassed on the British Protectorate, as reported in paragraph 1 of my letter, dated the 24th January 1914. 2. The Assistant Resident, Perim, reports that a week or so ago a small French flag was found planted on the Arabian Coast, east of Shaikh Main. The Turks from Turba took possession of the flag, and are reported to be keeping a strict watch by patrols night and day along the coast. Another report describes the flag as German or Dutch. 3.

Although no settlement has as yet been concluded between the Amir and some of the Shaaris, there is no fighting among them. The Sheikhs further observed that the state of affairs in the Amiri territory is at present tolerably good, but that the Dthambaris (a Radfan clan, nominally under the Haushabi Sultan) have been harassing the Shaaris, and other Amiri tribesmen on the road, and although the Haushabi Sultan was addressed, he has as yet given no satisfaction.

Further confirmation is awaited from the Amir. 1 tUf A reprisal is reported to have been made by the Kataba (Turkish) subjects against the people of Lakamat A1 Ash’ub (Amiri). The Amir of Dthala tried to settle with the Kaim Makam of Kataba, locally, but his negotiations proved un successful. The matter is still pending, and this Residency is watching its development. Such reprisals are mutual. Some 40 or 60 of the Imam’s soldiers were taken by Mokbil Naji Az Zindani to Jabal Jihaf, and they were accommodated in his house. This was evidently done to gauge the feelings of the Jihafis, and, should it have proved successful, more would undoubtedly have followed ; but the inhabitants were exasperated at their advent, and stood at the forts and strongholds to resist them. Later reports indicate that the Imam’s men left (all of them) Jabal Jihaf, and returned to Kataba. I will report officially on this matter, after full confirmation of the facts. 2. The Assistant Resident, Perim, writes that an armed force of about 1,000 of all ranks—Africans and Turks (sir) —is reported to have arrived at Assab from Massowa, but whether in the ordinary course of rehef or not is not known.

Robertson, Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Special Department. Reports have been received of the insecurity of trade routes, passing through the Haushabi country, and of the seizure of a caravan belonging to Turkish sub jects by the Haushabi Sultan. It appears that the Haushabi Sultan is getting dissatisfied at the collection of his dues by the Abdali Sultan at Lahej. A letter is being sent to the Chief, reminding him of his convention with the Abdali in 1895 under the terms of which he is bound to recover his dues, under the supervision of the Abdali, and advising him to behave well. His case for special treatment is before the Secretary of State for India, but he is chafing under the long delay. 2. Haji Ali Kamarani, a priest residing on the Haushabi border, has forwarded a letter addressed to him by Ahmed No’man (a Turkish farmer), complaining of the constant outrages of the Subehis on the road. He has also submitted for the approval of this Residency a scheme of a confederacy between Sheikh Mohammed Nasir Mokbil Pasha (Kayam Makam of the Kama’ira) Ahmed No’man (Kayam Makamofthe Hojaria), both Turkish, the Haushabi Sultan and the Abdali Sultan for taking combined action for punishing the Subehis. This Haji is a busy body, and I do not propose to correspond with him. I think, however, the time has come for inflicting punishment on these turbulent Subehis, and I think the Chiefs with in our border are alive to the necessity of reading them a lesson. 3. Raghib Bey, who is believed to be a sort of an Educational Inspector in Yemen, called on Colonel Jacob, and expressed his friendly feelings for the British Government. He said that the Turkish rule is on the decline, and offered his services in the way of keeping this Residency informed of what is going on in the Turkish official circles in Yemen, especially on matters relating to Aden, etc. The Yemeni authorities in cinjunctbn with the Imam have mce before intri gued in the Hadthramout, and, should any correspondence of this nature be re sumed, he promised to write about it. He was informed that this Residency is well disposed towards the Turks, and that it was much better that he should strive for still better relations. 2V.

Dated Aden Residency, the 7th December 1913. From— The Political Resident, Aden, To— C. C. Watson, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of Bombay. Sheikh Atik bin Ahmed, the Kadthi of Behan, came to Aden last week He said that he left Behan with the intention of visiting the Idrisi en route to Mecfa but, on the arrest of his companion, Saiyid Muhammad A1 Ahdal by the l,,w’ men at Arhab he proceeded to Khamer to see the Imam, and intercede in favour of the Saiyid. As, however, he found that the Imam had already started for Sta r, he went to Mecca direct. On arrival, he was hospitably received by the Sherif oi Mecca. The Sherif, the Kadthi said, is a noble and honourable person who devntp« considerable attention to affairs relating to the Hedjaz district, which is under bk control. He was neutral m the fightings which took place between the Imam and the Idrisi during the months of August and September in which the former was defeated and the Kadthi cannot say to which side the Sherif’s sympathy e At any rate since the Turkish power is now weak, he is sitting on the fence' 7 The Sherif intends, after the Haj, either to proceed to the Idrisi personally or to send his son to mediate between him and the Turks, and effect a settlement The Kadthi does not seem to like the Imam, and his inclination is more in favour of the Idrisi. This is of course due to religious bias, the former bein^ a Zaidi (Shiah sect), and the latter a Maaliki (Sunni sect) to which the Kadthi hi ^ self belongs. L m ' The Kadthi observed that the Imam’s power and authority is gaining throuel- out the Yemen, and at present the administration is practically in his sole charge. There are not now many Turkish soldiers in Yemen, and he has, therefore got the upper hand. The Imam’s ambitions are great; he aspires to conquer the whole of the Yemen, including the Hadthramout. The Kadthi said that he saw some letters with the Imam’s officials at Radia (Turkish), in which the Imam declares his aims. Had he not been engaged in the fightings with the Idrisi he would,'says the Kadthi, have begun his invasions in the easterly direction and in the Hadthramout. (This of course includes Behan, Beda, Upper An la hi all in the British sphere.) ^ Mahmud Nadim Bey, the present Governor of Sana’a, is pio-Imam in hi policy. _ He is, however, disliked by a great many of the Turkish officials and even the soldiers condemn his policy, but he has the advantage of the Imam’s sun f It is expected that the present alliance between the Trrks and the Imam will come to an end with his fall. The Kadthi cautions this Residency to beware of the Imam’s sway in th Yemen, and advises Government to be vigilant in watching his movements 6 With regard to Behan, the Kadthi said that there is now peace betwppr, rr Saiyids (of Ahl Dar’an) and the Ashraf. The Sheikhs of Masa’bain and the Saivids are anxious to come to Aden, and make friendship with Govern mpnf b way as the Aukkis and other stipendiaries. eminent, m the same ll With regard to Marib, the Kadthi said that since the Turkish flag was d stroyed by the people of that place, Sharif Abdurrahman lost his prestige' Th ~ Sharif went to Sana’a, and applied to the Turks for support but nn ne paid to him on account of the Turkish weakness.

The Reverend Mr. Hoyer of the Danish Mission in Aden who has just returned from Hodeida tells me that the Italian Government quite recently rented a house there and opened a Hospital for treatment of the indigent sick, but that on receipt of a letter from Constantinople, the institution was closed, and the Italian warship “ Yolturno ” carried away the medical staff. Yet, another instance of Italian interest in this littoral the same gentleman gave me, viz., that the Italians volunteered to dispense 1,000 francs in charity in Hodeida, but the Turkish Governor demurred, and asked that the amount might be paid over for disbursement to a local committee. The Italians asked that one of their own countrymen might sit as a member, but this proposal was negatived.

He said that, though there were rumours that Mocha was going to be ceded to Germany, there was no official correspondence on the subject in Yemen. He admitted, however, that Germany had been trying hard to obtain either Mocha, or any other sea port in the Red Sea, but he did not know on what condition they wanted it. The Mutasarif believes that Turkey is not likely to yield to Germany's wishes, and will avoid annoying England. He further observed that there is a proposal under the consideration of the Porte for placing Sana'a and the northern division entirely under the Imam; Manakha and the southern division being retained, and administered by Turkey. With regard to the Railway, he said that the scheme had fallen through, and that the Company, which had the concession, is claiming damages at Constantinople. ,He thought that the work is not likely to be put in hand soon. 2. The Shujaifi Shaikh reports that the Turkish custom officials at Mafalis intend to build at A1 Harsha—which he believes to be on the British side of the border—a post in order to prevent smugglers from evading the Turkish Custom House at Mafalis.

According to news received from another source, it appears that the Imam was victorious, and that the Idrisi lost about 400 killed, and/bout 800 wounded, and captured. The Imam’s army arriv ed at Jabel Razih and Bani Joma’a, and is now marching in a westerly direction. 3. It is reported by certain Aden merchants that the Turkish troops have re occupied the Farsan Islands, after a fight with about 200 followers of the Idrisi, Saiyid Ibrahim, the Idrisi leader, together with the Shaikh of the Island, have been seized by the Turkish troops. 4. It is further reported that the Turkish Government have succeeded in making a settlement with the inhabitants of Farsan, and made arrangement with them for posting an officer with a few men in the Island to look after the revenues of Govern ment. An Aden merchant, who went recently to Hodeida, reports that he learnt from trustworthy sources of the existence of minerals and kerosine oil in the Islands, and that the Germans have been trying to obtain a concession for working the mines, but that the Turkish Government would give preference to local merchants and companies. One or two Arab merchants of Hodeida intend to float a company for the purpose. He says that the Mutasarif of Hodeida has gone to the Islands. 5.

The Fadthli Sultan came to Aden this week and was interviewed by me. He was given to understand that Government are interested in the safety of the roads, trade-routes and way-farers, but decline to interfere in tribal matters. He was further advised to see the Abdali Sultan who is sojourning at Dar-al-Amir on the frontier of Aden mainly for helping to settle the question of the maintenance of order on the routes. It was also pointed out to him that this Residency dis approved of the prolonged hostilities between him and the Lower Yafais. The Sultan agreed to go and see the Abdali Sultan, for whom, however, he did not express any great admiration or esteem. Probably there is a good deal of feeling and jealousy between the two. 2. Please see paragraph 2 of the Weekly Letter of the 26th July 1913. Our news correspondent at Jabel Jihaf, Sayed Mahommed Taha, reports that Mukbil Naji Az Zindani went to Sana’a about 4 months ago and it was presumed that he met the Imam. He has now returned to Jabel Jihaf after calling on the Mutasariff of Taiz and Sheikh Mohammed Naser Mokbil. He says that the Imam has appointed him as the sole ruler of Jabel Jihaf and given him two of this officers to find out whether the people are obedient to him. 3. Our local news correspondent reports that Turkish gun-boats have captured a dhow belonging to an Arab merchant from Djibouti containing money. It is said that the dhow was returning to Djibouti after having discharged arms bought by the Zaranik. The Commander of the Turkish man-of-war is said to have issued a proclamation at Hodeida, Mocha, Khoka and other places prohibiting all dhows from carrying any tobacco, arms and ammunition and declaring that any dhows found infringing the prohibition would be confiscated, the Nakhodas b^^eaded and the crew punished. Owing to this many dhows from Khoka are lying at Maala, as they cannot take any cargo of tobacco. 4. It is reported that the Parsan Islands are blockaded by Turkish men-of-war. 5.

Disorder is still prevalent on the trade routes in the Fadthli country. In the raid mentioned in paragraph 1 of my letter of the 30th ultimo two Abdali tribesmen of the Manasira section were killed and it is now reported that two Haushabi Sheikhs have been killed by the Fadthlis at a place called Haraar. Feeling is running very high among the Abdalis at these outrages and the tribesmen may begin reprisals any time. The son of the Fadthli Sultan, with some of his principal men, has, however, gone to Lahej to see the Abdali Sultan about these matters and it is hoped they will be settled satisfactorily. 2. “ Re ” paragraph 3 of the Weekly Letter of the 23rd August 1913. The information about the German negotiations for the purchase of Rahaita was glean ed by Captain Hankin, Assistant Resident, Perim, when he went recently to spend a few days’ casual leave in Italian Somaliland and may be depended upon. We have now heard enough to form an opinion that the rumoured German activity in the Southern portion of the Red Sea is not a myth. It is more than a conjecture that the Germans and Italians are working hand in hand, the former to have a port either at Mocha or at Rahaita, on the other side of Mocha, and the latter to establish their influence in Yemen through the Idrisi. I think it very desirable that His Majesty’s Government should be informed that if they can get Turkey to agree, the Government should obtain possession of Kamaran, which is one of the finest natural harbours in the world. Farsan also is desirable. 3. As hinted in paragraph 2 of the Weekly Letter of the 2nd August 1913, the Wazir of the Idrisi came to Aden via Massowa and called on Jacob. He admitted that the Italians had given the Idrisi material assistance in money, arms, ammu nition, etc., during the war with the Turks and stated that even now they were assisting the Idrisi with everything he asked for. He asserted that, so far as he was aware, there was no treaty or agreement between the Italians and the Idrisi and that he could not say whether the Italians had any ulterior motives in assisting the Idrisi. It seemed he was anxious for an expression of our friendship, but did not openly broach the subject. Sheikh Saleh Balaxa, the Aden merchant, how ever, tried to pave the way for him and give sufficient expression to the Wazir’s mind. Balaxa stated that the Idrisi requires the shelter of some European Power, that he prefers ours, but that, baulked here, he will place himself under the protection of the Italians, though he does not like them because he thinks that they left him in the lurch when they patched up their affairs with Turkey. Jacob did not commit himself to any statement and bid good bye to Wazir Sheikh Mahomed Yehia Ba Sahi with a formal expression of our friendly feelings for his Master. 4. It was gathered from the conversation with the Idrisi s Wazir, that the Turks have cut off the Idrisi pretty effectively from the sea, but that they have left the fighting by land to the Imam and Ibn A1 Haij ; that the Idrisi is not afraid of being overwhelmed by them, especially as the Sharif of Mecca is at present hold ing aloof and not co-operating against the Idrisi.

I have received two more letters signed by Sheikhs Mahomed Yehia Hiba Fashiq, Hassan Yehia Fashiq a,nd Ali Yehia Fashiq, Sheikhs of the Zaraniq tribe in Yemen, press ing for negotiations to take over any portion of their territory which we may require. They say among other things:— “We hear that the Germans are building at Mokha. We desire your Government to take Yemen ; we do not at all want the Germans I cannot vouch for the genuineness of the letters, but from inquiries made it appears that the signatories are brothers and the most influential Sheikhs of the Zaraniqs, and that Mahomed Yehia is recognised as the leading Sheikh of this powerful tribe. I told the messenger that I could give him no reply, but salaams to his Sheikhs. A perusal of this and of my letter of the 2nd instant will show what the hopes and fears of the Arabs at present are and how fast the Arabs move on hearing of Turkish misfortunes.

Three torpedo boats built in Germany for the Chinese Republic are at present in Aden on their way to China.

A Rnbetain Shaikh writes that Imam’s men are scattered about the districts in the vicinity of Eada and are expected to move towards Juban and Bubetain during the harvest season; that the Eubetain Sh dkhs had received further communications from the Imam’s emissaries which they ignored ; that it is believed that Mahomed Ali An Nawi (British sphere) gets an allowance from the Imam and he is the cause of all the mischief in having induced the Imam’s men to enter places within the British sphere of influence. 2. The news correspondent at Ad-Dareja reports that one of the Wajihi’s men (Turkish side) attacked a subject of the Haushabi Sultan and that the matter has been placed before Haji Ali A1 Kamarani, a man of much local repute, about whom I have written to Government officially in my report regarding the Hau shabi border dispute. 3. Sultan Kahtan bin Omer of Upper Yafa is now in Aden. He has grown old and is generally debilitated. The Alawi and Kotaibi Shaikhs have also come in expecting to receive arms, ammunition and stipend in accordance with the pro visional agreement they recently signed at Lahej for the safety of the Aden-Dthala road. This matter has been reported by me to Government officially and might be expedited. The occasion is an unique one to secure a lasting peace. 4. Our local news correspondent reports it is remoured that the Turkish Government intend to appoint the eldest son of the Imam as Governor of Sanaa with Mahmud Nadim Bey as his Deputy, and that the Imam will personally hold his present position. * Dated Aden Residency, the 9th August 1913.

Dated Aden Residency, the 2nd (received 11th) August 191, From—The Acting Political Resident at Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Special Departments One Shaikh Kolaib bin Sinan, an Arab across our border, came to vTsit me with T No man, to whom alius™ was ade p agraphs 3,4 and 1 of my \\ eekly Letters of the 24th, 31st May and 14th June respectively. Shaikh Kolaib states that Shaikh Ahmed Noman is keen on entering mto friendly relations with the British Government and that he is ready to act m this directmn the moment he is assured of British support (!). He said that the existing peace between the Turks and the Imam would not last long, that the time of disagreement was not far off and that it would probably date as soon as a decisive battle was fought between the Imam and the Idrisi; that it was the general belief that as a result of these internecine troubles, the Turks would disan- pear from the scene and the British enter thereon without any bloodshed. Appar ently Shaikh Ahmed Noman s interest in befriending us is the outcome of popular opinion, and a general mistrust of the Turk. ^ 2 - -J- h ave received a similar hint from another and more influential source. Shaikh Saleh Balaxa, a merchant of Aden, recently went to the Idrisi Saiyid to recover some debts due to him by one of his proteges. Shaikh Saleh Balaxa reports that the Idrisi is full of resources, quite at ease and not the least frightened of the Turks and their allies. The Idrisi hinted to Shaikh Saleh Balaxa that he would like to make friends with the British Government, that he required nothing from them except protection against Foreign Powers and assistance in any emergency. He said that he had no agreement with the Italians, but that the latter were striving to enter into one with him. Balaxa says that the Wazir of the Idrisi, named Muhom- ed Ba Sahi (of Hadramaut), is shortly coming to Aden via Massawah (Italian port of Eritrea) with a view to feel the pulse. 3. Our local news correspondent reports that fighting is going on between the Turks and the Idrisi at Sabia and that the Turks are blockading the coast from Maidi to Konfuda. 4. The Assistant Resident, Perim., reports that the permanent way at Mocha is proceeding and that German steamers carrying the railway lines, etc., are expect ed shortly. One Herr Georg Pankow from Swakapmund, D. S. W. Africa, called on me on the 26th ultimo with the German Consul at AdendHerr Ernst Vogelsang. He said that he represents the London Guano Importers, Daniel de Pass and Com pany, of Fenchurch Street, and that he has been asked to visit the islands off Mocha to prospect. He asked me if it were all safe and I replied that I knew nothing. He said that most of these islands were without inhabitants, but that the larger one to the north had four Turkish soldiers thereon. He seemed to know a good deal about them. He said that he would go to Perim and there charter a steamer o,f the Perim Coal Company, and proceed further. There seems on the whole some truth in the rumour about German activity in the region about Mocha, though Mr. Richardson, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Hodeida, who called on me the day before yesterday, thinks that it is quite unlikely that the Germans will get any concession there.

Sultan Ghalib writes to say that he intends to leave India for Mokalla on the 8th September next and explains that he was detained in India longer than he expected on account of the marriage of his daughters. His locum tenens at Mo kalla writes that he is giving his best attention to settle the trouble with the \\ ahidi Sultan of Bir Ah and that he will hold a conference in September next with the Sultan of Bir Ah and his Shaikhs to discuss the matter and bring it to a satisfactory solution. 2. Our local news correspondent reports that it is said that a proclamation has been issued by the Turkish authorities in Yemen offering a very large reward to any one who will catch the Idrisi alive or will kill him. 3.

I have now received a report from the Amir of Dthala regarding the rising at Dar Robat. The Amir writes that on his return to Dthala he found that in appearance the disturbance had subsided but that evil intentions were still harboured in the minds of some ill-disposed persons, who intended to do mischief on the roads. I think that there is at present no need to grant the Amir the loan of Rs. 3,000 sanction d by Government and am writing to Government officially. 2. The Amir reports that the Turks and Imam are quiet, that Saiyid Muhammad bin Ali, one of the Imam’s Commanders, is stationed at Dimt and that it is ru moured that he has orders to rebuild the old fort at Dimt and proceed to Jebel Jihaf with 300 men on behalf of Mokbil Naji-az-Zindani who is still wandering from place to place in the Yemen, vide paragraph 2 of the Weekly Letter of the 7th June 1913. The Amir promises to report the Saiyid’s movements when he leaves Dimt. 3. The Subehis have committed some cases of robbery in the Haushabi country. The Sultan has been asked to give redress to the sufferers and preserve peace within his limits. 4. Shaikh Abdul Kawi of Shaab (in the Subehi country) reports that some Turkish Arabs, called the Dalawil had attempted to erect posts within Shaabi limits and to rebuild the dars which had been demolished by the Boundary Com mission, but that he stopped them from doing so. He says that the same Arabs have usurped some lands from the Shaabis ,and are cultivating them now. I have asked the Abdali Sultan to make inquiries and let me know the result. 5. Please see the concluding paragraph of the Weekly Letter of the 29th March 1913.

I have not yet received any report from the Amir of Dthala regarding the rising at Dar Robat, but our news correspondent at Jebel Jihaf reports that the trouble is over and that the power of the Amir has been re-established in the place without any serious consequences to either the Amir or the tribesmen. The correspondent also writes that the country is infested with thieves and that there is little control over them. 2 Further complaints against the Subehis, especially of the Jabbera ^ clan, have been received by the Abdali Sultan from the Mutasarrif of Taiz. It is ex tremely difficult for the Abdali to have any control over these roving free hooters, who oeriodically ply their time-honoured occupation of looting. I, however, hope that, if my proposal to strengthen the hands of the Haushabi Suit an be approved at an early date, we shall have given an able co-adjutor to the Abdali to keep the Subehis in check. 3 The Turks are reported to be erecting a permanent way for a light railway from Mocha to Taiz. The construction of the break water mentioned m para graph d of my Weekly Letter of the 21st ultimo is said to be steadily progressing. ! 9 [ 5 | Dated Aden Residency, the 12th July 1913.

Special Department. It is reported that Mahmud Nadim Pasha the Governor-General of Yemen and Saeed Pasha, the General Officer Commanding the troops, have been recalled and are being replaced by Shakir Pasha and Hamdi Pasha ; that troops are disaffected at Hodeida ; that disturbances are prevalent everywhere, and that consequently import and export trade is at a stand still. 2. It is rumoured that the Turkish garrison at Shaikh Saeid is to be withdrawn shortly and that Arab levies will be quartered in their place. 3. The Sharif of Behan writes that on his paying a visit to Sharif Abdul Rahman of Marib, the latter showed him some letters from the Turks in which it was stated that the Aden authorities were contemplating an advance to the hinter land through Behan. The Sharif of Behan further states that there is a belief that we are working in harmony with the Idrisi. It is possible the local Turkish officials think it desirable to create an opinion against us by mixing us up with the Idrisi, who is the common enemy of the Turks, the Sharif of Mecca and the Imam of Sana’a. 4. The Upper Aulaki Sultan has sent in a long letter remonstrating against the decision of Government in not presenting him with cannons which he applied for 2 years ago. He states that he had never left his head quarters for 25 years nor was it customary for his ancestors to travel to the coast, but owing to the murder of his brother by his own tribesmen, he was obliged to come down to Aden with a request for 2 cannons. He complains that by their refusal, Government have made him an object of ridicule in the eyes of the Arabs and, what is worse, weakened his control over his tribesmen, who see that his friendship with Gov ernment is not worth 2 cannons. Government have already stated that they do not wish to give these guns on the principle of non-intervention m Arab affairs. Other Chiefs have been more favoured by us, and it would be politic to give the Aulaki Sultan what he asks, ignoring the matter of subjugating his tribesmen, and on the plea of respect to a powerful and friendly Chief. 5. It is stated that the Governor of Djibouti has paid a visit to Obock with a view to selecting a site for a proposed fort in the neighbourhood of Tadjura. Dated Aden Residency, the 5th July 1913.

A letter received from Hodeida confirms the failure of the Turko-Imamic negotiations for peace with the Idrisi. It states that the Governor-General of Yemen, the Mutasarif of Hodeida and other officials have returned from Loheia to Hodeida, that the Idrisi remains in possession of Maidi, Habl, - Jaizan, Farsan, Abu Arish and part of Sabia, and the Imam has resumed hostilities and already occupied 20 villages which were under the Idrisi’s influence. 2 . The Subehis of the Jabbera clan have carried away one donkey load and seven camel loads of skins from a trade route in the Haushabi country. I have asked the Sultan to inquire into the matter and let me know the result. 3. Paragraph 4 of my Weekly Letter of the 17th May 1913.

Jacob, Acting Political Resident at Aden, To—C. C. Watson, Esq., C.I.E., I.C.S., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Special Department. The Abdali Sultan has sent for my perusal two letters, which he received from Shaikh Ahmed Noman of Hoj aria and the Shaikh of the Aabus (both on the Turkish side), complaining that the Subehis of the Bughaili section and others have looted a camel with its load of goods belonging to one of their subjects and demanding restoration of the same. They say that these robberies of the Subehis have become so frequent that people on their side are eager to retaliate. They remark that unless the Subehis are placed under proper control, they will have to find a safer route for their trade to Mokha or Khokha. I have advised the Abdali to reply to the Shaikhs that the Subehis are not his tribesmen, but that he has always tried to give redress to Turkish sufferers of Subehi mis deeds. I understand that the Abdali has persuaded these Subehis to settle the claims. 2. There is a long-standing dispute between the Sultan of Mokalla and the Wahidi Sultan of Bir Ali in consequence of the former stopping the river water going into the Wahidi’s fields at Haifa, contrary to an agreement existing between the parties. Several letters addressed by this office to Mokalla have remained unheeded, the Sultan remaining perpetually absent from his estate and his locum tencus shirk ing responsibility. I have written to Sultan Ghalib at Hyderabad pointing out the necessity of his returning to Mokalla and settling this and other affairs. Owing to his continued absence the people of Mokalla seem to be getting quite out of hand and unless Sultan Ghalib listen to my advice, it will be necessary to put some pressure on him to return to Mokalla. 3 Our local news correspondent reports that the Imam has sent out agents to the several districts of Yemen to report to him whether the Shaikhs and other officials are performing their duties properly. He says that people from all parts of Yemen go to pay him respect and lodge their complaints^ and are genera y satisfied ; that his revenue is coming in regularly and shows an increase this year. 4 It is reported that arms and ammunition are abundant in the interior of Arabia, that they mostly come from Mocha and are publicly sold at a place called Eamadah, that the Turks do not prohibit their impoitation as m former years, that rifles of both old and modern type are sold at an average price ot 30 dollars. 5. There has been good rain in some of the districts of Yemen, such as Kataba, Ibb and Tam and consequently the price of gram has fallen. 6 About 2 500 Turkish troops are reported to have come down to Hodeida on their way home. It is said that they will be relieved by troops coming from Asia Minor.' The contemplated settlement with the lonsi appears to Ja e fallen through. The Cruiser “ Hamidiah ” is cruising about the Idiisi coast and the Turks are reported to be slowly mustering troops and collecting pio\ . j at Loheia. 7 It is reported that the Abyssinians have hoisted their flag at Harr, ma and MadhY on the'coast of Erythrea and that, the Italian Governor of Assab has proceeded to Adis Abeba vii Djibouti, presuma } o re 1 c2 Dated Aden Residency, the 14th June 1913. f Endorsed by the Acting Political Resident, Aden.

While the Amir of Dthala was at Lahej, on his way back to Dthala, he received a letter from his brother informing him that the Shaaris, Jahafis and several of his other tribesmen had rebelled against him and driven away his garrison at Dar-al- Robat. He returned to Aden instantly with this letter and asked me for 24,000 rounds of ammunition on payment and for a loan of Rs. 4,000, which he promised to liquidate by instalments chargeable to his stipend and transit dues. I have given him the ammunition from the reserve stock at my disposal as I consider this a reasonable amount in the circumstances prevailing. He is a frontier Chief and it is of the utmost importance to uphold his suzerainty in the face of contu macious tribesmen who are prone from time immemorial to enlist the assistance of trans-frontier Arabs. I have cabled to Government with regard to the loan but await a further report from Amir Nasr after his return to Dthala. 2. Shaikh Mokbil Naji-az-Zindani, to whom allusion was made, in the Weekly Letters of the 22nd March and 5th April last, is still hanging on at Kataba with the hope that the Imam and the Turks will reinstate him in the chiefship of Jebel Jihaf. I do not know whether they will do this, but if it is done, this hill, once Turkish, will become a fruitful source of intrigue and unrest. % Dated Aden Residency, the 7th June 1913.

He says that though the Turks and the Imam am workinl in concert, no Turkish soldiers accompanied the recent Imam’s emissaries to *Nawa is considered within our sphere. Ra wa and Juban. He states that Shaikh , Muhammad Ali Mohsin An Nawi* is entirely responsible for bringing the Imam’s men into Nawa. This fact seems quite clear from a letter of Muhammad Ah to the Naqib of Mausata, a copy of which has been sent to me by the latter and extracts from which I quote below. Saiyid Yahia says that the Imam is a powerful chief and at present working in harmony with the Turks, but that he is not as popular as the Idrisi His admi nistration is not just and he re-covers exhorbitant dues in three or four forms in addition to the Turkish demands. The Idfisi, on the other hand, receives only the customary Zakat and is liberal to his men. Saiyid Yahia thinks that the Idrisi’s power and influence are much greater than the Imam’s that he keeps the country under his control m proper order and that internal peace prevails wherever the Idrisi’s influence is extended. The Saiyid opines that the Idrisi is not likely to settle with the Turks as he (Idrisi) believes that their days in Yemen terminated with the return of Izzat Pasha to Constantinople {i.e., during the Turko-Balkan War). The latest reports however, say tnat the Idrisi has settled with Turkey and the result of the conference has been posted to Constantinople by the Grovernor-General of Yemen. , m 2 - Paragraph 1 of the Weekly Letter dated the 26th April 1913, the obiect of Shaikh Muhammad Ah Mohsm An Nawi in inviting the Imam’s men to Nawa seems to be to frighten us into granting him a stipend. The following extracts from two letters written to Naqibs of Mausata by him and his brother Mohsin bin Ali Mohsin An Nawi respectively are worth noting:- I. The Governors of the Imam are being sent to every district and they have soldiers whose number God alone can know. There is a strong tJust beyond our border. if? 106 a t Muresf which recovered the tithes due by the people of that place. They have settled the road and gone to Dimt and the Rada country with their troops. The Imam and the Turks intend to send a Governor to Juban who will remain there permanently. They have been sending invitations to all Shaikhs of Rubeaten* + rr. , BaniDthabyant, etc., to tender alle giance to tliem. * * * *. You advised us not to meet the Government (Turk and Imam), but be it not hidden from your that no one likes the locusts to destroy his country ; they are a multitude that swarms over every part of Yemen.

II. As regards the British Government, if they will fix a stipend for us we shall not hesitate to make friendship with them, but if no stipend is given to us, we shall not neglect our interests and shall try to gain benefit wherever we can find it.” There is no need to be frightened into compliance with the wishes of these young firebrands. The Imam does not appear to be an amiable master and self- interest must teach the Nawais on what side the line to dwell. 3. Please see paragraph 3 of the Weekly Letter of the 17th instant. There appears to be some misunderstanding on the part of the people of Mocha and there abouts regarding the rumoured sale of Mocha or a part of it to Germany. An Arab Shaikh, Ahmed Noman, holding a high appointment under the Turks, and other officials, had been deputed to Mocha to find out the persons who fired on the residence of the Italian Consul, and popular suspicion and the dislike the Arabs have for the Germans and Italians seem to have put a wrong interpretation on the operations of these officials. I have it on good authority that Shaikh Ahmed Neman as well as the Eaim Makam of Mocha deny the accuracy of the rumours and state that even if the Turks were secretly to arrange for the transfer of Mocha to Germany, the Arabs would hotly oppose the transfer. As a matter of fact the rumour seems to have induced many people to leave Mocha, which is a dilapidated place with an unprotected harbour exposed to the North-East winds. The great desideratum in my opinion is for us to shew the white ensign in the Red Sea pretty freely. Dated Aden Residency, the 24th May 1913. Endorsed by the Acting Political Resident, Aden.

Our news f correspondent persists in his report about the survey of Mocha with a view to a part of it being made over to the Germans and remarks that Shaikh Ahmed Noman is being tempted by the Germans with a monthly stipend of $1,000 in the hope of the trade route being diverted to Mocha. Not much reliance can be placed on this news, but it shows how the local minds are agitated through fears of German activity.

The Sheikh of Juban writes that the Imam's emissaries, after leaving Juban and Nawa, are stationed at Dimt a few miles from Juban on the Turkish side. 2. The Turks appear to be experiencing some difficulty in collecting their revenue in the district of Kataba owing to the Imam also collecting his dues. A local news- correspondent reports that some fighting and casualties have taken place in consequence of the people refusing to pay taxes to the Turks. 3. Please see paragraph 3 of the Weekly Letter of the 19th April 1913. The same correspondent reports that some Turkish officials and Shaikhs of Taiz are at present at Mocha surveying the places which are to be given to the Germans. He says that they have assigned two places—one opposite the Minaret of Mocha and the other at the eastern end of Mocha near Al-Tayar for the storage of coal and iron. He adds that the peopte are opposed to this but have been informed by the authorities that the ground will be leased to a German Company, but there will be no change in the government which will be Turkish. 4 Our news correspondent in Upper Yafa writes that a shepherd has come forward as prophet at Marib and working on the popular imagination, is claiming authority over Yemen. 5, Please see paragraph 3 of the Weekly Letter of the 26th April 1913. From a copy of the reports of the Vice-Consul at Hodeida to His Britannic Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople, which I have received, it appears that the Turk- ish Governor-General of Yemen has not yet been able to effect a settlement wth the Idrisi who is believed to be avoiding a conference with the Turkish mission. Mr. Richardson remarks that the Idrisi “ is undoubtedly aware of the critical con dition in which the Ottoman Government finds itself at the present moment and open intrigue by a foreign power has at the same time not improbaUy lent itself to his persistent and preposterous demands. In ^ ° f the given by His Majesty’s Ambassador m Home regarding the Italian design flmen there seen/some reason to believe that they are still at the back the Idrisi.

From—The Political Resident at Aden, To — C. C. Watson, Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Special Depart ment. Several letters from the Imam’s emissaries and the Kaim Makam of Rada, calling on the Shaikh of Juban to submit, have been sent to me by the Shaikh, who asks me to give him assistance in money, arms and ammunition. As Juban lies within the Turkish sphere, we are not responsible for his protection. 2. Certain Shaikhs of Rubeaten write to me about the advent of the Imam’s troops in Nawa and Juban and state that the Rubeaten people are much alarmed. They also report that they have been working in concert with the Juban Shaikh and helping the Jubanis to drive the Imam’s troops out of the country. Juban Nawa, Bani Dthabyan ^nd Rubeaten being from old time in close friendship, it is idle to counsel them to respect the line delimited, in other words, to expect Rubeaten Shaikhs on our side the line to refrain from going across to assist Juban when they have done so from time immemorial. The inclusion of Juban within the Turkish side was a grave error, and this has been the one weak spot along the border and a fruitful source of Turkish intrigue. Far better, had all these principalities gone over ‘ en bloc ' to the Turks than this time-honoured confederacy been split up as is now the case. 3. There has been a fight between the people of Jebel Jihaf and Amiri tribes men in consequence of the former having lifted 40 sheep belonging to the Amiris. The Amir is at present in Aden.

He tells a long story of the arrival of the Imam’s troops in Juban and Nawa, ascribes the move to the machina tions of Shaikh Muhammad Ali Mohsin of Nawa and ends by saying that the Imam’s men have withdrawn from Nawa owing to the determined opposition of the Jubanis. I hope to hear something again from Shaikh Mohsin Askar, the Naqib of Mausatta. 2. A local news-correspondent reports that Mahmud Nadim Bey, Governor General of Yemen, has concluded peace with the Idrisi on the lines drawn up by the Porte and that the Imam has also made his settlement with the Idrisi.

Please see paragraph 1 of the weekly letter of the 19th April 1913. The Naqib of Mausatta, Shaikh Mohsin Askar, reports that some 30 of the Imam’s soldiers have entered Nawa and have been welcomed by one of the influential Shaikhs, Muhammad Ali Mohsin An Na’wi, while the other Shaikhs have fled away. Nawa is an appanage of Mausatta and is within our sphere. The Naqib says that in accord ance with my advice he has taken no steps against the interlopers and fears that, unless Government intervene, this encroachment will provoke bloodshed and become the genesis of feuds which will be damaging to the reputation of our Govern ment Arabs are unnecessarily nervous, and I am watching events and counselling patience. It is said that the people of Juban, who are next to our border line and most anxious to come with n our sphere, have resisted the Imam’s men and com pelled them to withdraw. We may possibly hear the same story from Nawa very soon. I have so far received no reply from the Governor-General of Yemen with regard to Turkish interference in Nawa some time ago. I shall address Government officially on this matter 2 Saiyid Muhammad Taha, our news-correspondent at Jebel Jihaf, reports that 'the people of Jihaf are in communication with the Imam’s representative, and will welcome a portion of his force to Jihaf with a view to its occupation. I am calling for further reports on this subject. 3. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Hodeida, in a report of the 25th March 1913 to His Maiestv’s Ambassador at Constantinople, confirms the negotiations men- tioned in paragraph 2 of my weekly letter of the 12th April 1913 between the Turkish authorities and the Idrisi Saiyid. He says that from all accounts it would appear that the Porte is prepared to grant the Idrisi a liberal form of autonomy over a large tract of country under Ottoman suzerainty. He explains that the anxiety of the Turkish Government to come to a speedy understanding with this Pretender in spite of having a sufficient force under the Turkish Commander-in- Chief and’the son of Sharif of Mecca ready at hand to subjugate him, is generally attributed to their desire to counteract Italian intrigue and influence m the Saiyid s snhere as well as to give a set-back to the fast growing influence of the Imam, who has Veen a serious drain on the resources of the Turks by virtue of the agreement existing between them.

Please see paragraph 3 of last week’s letter. The Abdali Sultan writes that several sections of the Jorabi tribe (Subehi) who carried away camels and their loads of kat have now appeared before him. He is doing his best to recover the plundered property. 2. Please see paragraph 4 of the Weekly letter of the 22nd March re Nadim Pasha’s movements with the object of coming to terms with the Idrisi. His Highness the Abdali Sultan has received a letter from a merchant in Hodeia stating that the Wall and other members of the mission are still at Loheya that nothing has been heard of their meeting with the Idrisi but that there is no fighting going on, and that the Imam’s men remain in the places from which they had driven the Idrisi’s men. With reference to the W eekly letter of the 29th March 1913, the local news correspondent reports that the Imam Yahia is willing to make peace with the Idrisi; also, that the Sharif of Mecca and the Tdrisi are on good tprmq and that they regularly communicate with each other, that the Shant made’a settlement with all the tribesmen of the hinterland of Mecca and Medina, and secured the roads lying between Jedda, Mecca and Medina.

A local news correspondent reports as follows :—• Ibn Al-Ahmer and a number of Hashid tribesmen are espousing the cause of the Idrisi, as also the tribesmen of Kohlan, Du-Mabomed and Du-Hasen. The change is attributed to the fact that the Imam has stopped the payment of allow ances drawn by the Akils of these tribes and fixed the pay for a soldier at $ 5 per mensem. The Idrisi pays his soldiers 2 guineas per mensem. The Turks have settled with the Idrisi. The Imam has refused to follow suit and wishes to continue the fighting. The Turks have consequently declared themselves neutral. The cost of grain in Yemen is gone very high, thereby in creasing the Idrisi’s chances of getting more followers. The people of Suada have informed the Imam and the Idrisi that they are independent, and that, if they try to interfere with them (the people), they will fight them.

With reference to the Zindani Shaikh’s recent threats of invasion of Jabel Jihaf with the aid of Turkish troops (vide paragraph 2 of my letter of 22nd March 1913), our news correspondent, Saiyid Muhammad Taha, reports that the Shaikh is an imbecile and he has lost all influence over his people. 2. Saiyid Muhammad Taha further reports that a mixed force of Turkish and Imamic soldiers has destroyed all the stone buildings in the village of Hamar, near Kataba, and taken away animals from the village. It is reported, and confirmed by the Amir of Dthala, that a similar force to the above has destroyed stone build ings in Mures (Turkish) and has arrested the Shaikhs of the place. This is believed to be in connection with the recent murder of the Kaimmakam of Kataba. The people of Mures failed to hand over the murderers, who are said to have taken refuge in Upper Yafa (British). 3. The Mansab of the Sanawi reports that the Masfari, Bughaili and Shukri sections of the Jorabi (Subehi)have carried away from the trade route five camels with their loads of 4 4 kat ’ ’. Two of the camels were subsequently restored to their owners, and the remainder were sold by the marauders for $ 80. The Abdali Sultan has demanded early restitution on behalf of the sufferers. The result is awaited. The Somati (Subehi) is also reported to have carried away six camels laden with 44 kat ” on the 30th March 1913. Dated Aden Residency, the 5th April 1913.

Eighty thousand volunteers have already left Medina in the Railway and a consider able number are ready to leave. They are carrying their own arms and ammunition. “ The Mavia road now-a-days is insecure. The road above and at Musa- mir (Haushabi capital) is in a very disturbed state owing to Subehi outrages. “ The inhabitants of Rada have petitioned the Imam praying that an official may be sent to replace their Shaikhs, who have been taxing them over and above the authorised taxes, and assuring him of their readiness to join him whenever he is in need of troops. “ In consequence of scarcity of grain in Yemen, murders are committed daily. The Imam recently arrested eight men who were accused of murders and beheaded them. “ Shaikh Muhammad Naser Mokbil of Shurman, who was summoned by the Imam, refused to go to him. The Imam has now written to the Governor-General of Yemen asking him to order the Shaikh to appear before him. “ All buggalows arriving at Maidi are being inspected by the Idrisi men. The Italians continue to send the Idrisi arms, ammunition, etc., which are brought by buggalows at Maidi and landed by the Idrisi in boats which he keeps for the purpose. “ On receiving a complaint from The people of Hogaria against their Shaikh, Ahmed Noman, to the effect that he treated them oppressively and imposed unlawful taxes, the Imam advised him to be moderate ; but the Shaikh is said to have sent him an impertinent reply, and serious trouble is, therefore, anticipated between them.

This has been his practice for years. 2. The Nawa Shaikhs have sent me a letter addressed to them by the Court of Rada (Turkish). I attach a copy of its translation. I am addressing the Governor-General of the Yemen on the subject and asking him to check such action on the part of the authorities at Rada. There has been a sort of inter-regnum since Izzat Pasha left for Europe, but I hear his locum tenens Mahmud Nadim Pasha has lately been appointed substantively. 3. His Highness the Abdali Sultan reports that the Imam’s power is somewhat weakened owing to some of the important sections of the tribes under him having fallen away, being enticed by the Idrisi’s gold. Turkish troops co-operating with him against the Iddsi appear also to have been withdrawn. 4. A new pretender named Shaikh Ali Sombali Abu Sabula is said to have risen at Marib.

Caravanmen are afraid to pass through these places except in bodies of not less than 100 men. The D’thala road is also insecure on account of the Kotaibi interference with travellers. “ The Mutasarif of Taiz has been deposed and lately passed through Aden. “ Shaikh Ahmad Noman, Kaimakam of Ho j aria has been summoned to Sana’a. It is believed that he will be deposed, as the Turks and the Imam have received a number of complaints against him.

His Highness the Abdali Sultan reports that the Mansuri clan, which was until recently considered the best behaved among the Subehis, has now taken to maraud ing like the others. The other day some 250 men of this clan raided an Abdali vil lage called Zaida, carrying away about 300 goats. They were pursued by Abdali soldiers who succeeded in recovering about 200 goats. One casualty on either side is reported. 2. It is only recently that the Sultan recommended the Mansuri Shaikh for some special considerations in connection with his claim to certain extra taxes and the matter was being considered by me. The reasons for this sudden change in the Mansurhs behaviour are at present not known. 3. A subsequent report has been received from His Highness to the effect that the Mansuris have raided a caravan on the road near Al-Amad in the Abdali terri tory and that they have wounded a camel and set fire to 2 stacks of dry ‘ kirbi/ 4. The Mansab of Sanawi reports that the brother of the Somati Shaikh (Subehi) recently carried away 2 camels with their loads, of which one was subsequently recovered by its owner on a payment of $12, and that the Mansuris have killed a camel belonging to a traveller named Alwan Al-Mashaki and carried away an other. 5. The Abdali complains bitterly of the misdeeds of the Subehis. He says that they have no regard whatever either for Government or himself and that the more leniently they are treated the more trouble they give. He suggests that Government should punish them by sending an expedition or give him assistance in money and arms and. ammunition and he would be prepared personally to conduct the same. He says there is no other way of punishing them. Had co-operation with the Sultan by us been allowed within the 35 mile limit as originally proposed, these nuisances would abate. I am in favour of helping the Sultan with arms and ammunition on a large scale. Kindly treatment is wasted on these miscreants. I don’t approve of Government interfering except by assistance of grants of more arms and ammunition. Dated Aden Residency, the 22nd February 1913. Endorsed by the Political Resident, Aden.

Our news correspondent at Jabel Jihaf reports that Abdul Hamid and Sef, brothers of the Amir of Dthala, while going to the village of Al-Husen (Amiri) were detained by some of the villagers, who objected to their entering the village, and that, in consequence, a fight would have taken place but for the timely inter vention of some of the more sensible villagers who settled the matter and allow ed the Amir’s brothers to enter the village. 2. Our news correspondent in Upper Yafa reports that some of the petty Shaikhs of Upper Yafa, who had written to the Imam proposing to call on him, have received evasive replies. 3. A local news correspondent reports as follows :— “ The Idrisi is now living at a place called Hasinayah between Sabia and Maidi. He has collected a number of guns and ammunition and other material. His followers are liberally paid as well as provided with all their requirements. “ A truce for 3 months exists between the Idrisi on the one hand and the Imam and Ibn Al-Haig, the Shaikh of Asir on the other. “ The Shaikh of Asir has a large number of troops. The Idrisi Saiyid is trying to win him over to his side. If he succeeds the Saiyid will be too powerful for the Imam. The Shaikh of Asir, however, is m- terested more than the Imam himself in driving the Saiyrdout of the country ; it is, therefore, unlikely he will join the latter. The Turkish officials in Yemen are said to be divided in opinion as to whether the Idrisi should be recognised as the Chief of Asir. Dated Aden Residency, the 25th January 1913.

Watson, Esq., I.C.S., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Special Department. Our news correspondent at Jabel Jihaf, Saiyid Muhammad Taha, reports a recrudescence of disorder in several Amiri villages. 2. The Saiyid has also sent in a letter (dated 5th September 1912) from the Kotaibi Shaikh to his address, in which the latter states that he has received some letters from the Imam and requests the Saiyid to send him one of the Imam’s men, who are in the habit of paying occasional visits to the Amir of Dthala, as he wishes to pay a visit to the Imam. The Saiyid, who has since paid a visit to the Kotaibi Shaikh, says that the reason why the latter is corresponding with the Imam is because we have not paid him any compensation for the losses he suffered by the expedition we sent in 1901 against his tribe. The Kotaibi, like all Arabs, is trying to see what he can get out of us by frightening us with the bugbear of the Imam. It is interesting to note that the initiative has been taken by the Kotaibi Shaikh and not by the Imam. 1 shall address the Kotaibi. 3. Shaikh Muhammad Ali Mohsin Askar, one of the Nakibs of Mausatta (Upper Yafa) reports that the Imam is still corresponding with the people of Nawa and that the Nawa Shaikh, Muhammad Ali, is to be interviewed shortly by one of the Imam s representatives at Nawa on the subject of the payment of tit eo o e mam y the Nawa people. 4. Now that both Izzat Pasha, the Governor-General of Yemen and his Deputy, Mahmud Nadim, have left the Yemen for Europe, it is that the Imam is likely to try his hand in winning his former P 0 ^ a U y® stl ^ He is said to be now at Menakha, while a Yemam Parhamentenan represents the Turks in Sana’a. The Turkish influence m Yemen is on the wane aim not unlikely but that the Imam may wish to extend his power a^d rale and t^e advantage of the removal of Turkish troops to intrigue with, or seek to mtimi date, some of our discoij/ted stipendiaries.

Watson, Esq., I.C.S., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Special Department. I have received a letter from one Shaikh Hasan Yehia Haba, who is believed to be the Chief of the Zaraneek tribe in the neighbourhood of Hodeida, saying that he will arrange to sell us a portion of the coast if we wish to have it. I have not replied to the letter which may not be genuine and is even less likely to be authentic. 2. Please see paragraph 2 of the Weekly Letter, dated 30th November last. At the instance of the Abdali Sultan, the Mansuri Shaikh and the Maccadums of caravans have come to an arrangement by which the Mansuri Shaikh agrees to forego all dues (either in money or kind) on caravans in consideration of a monthly sum of $ 60 which the Maccadums have agreed to pay him through the Abdali Sultan. 3. The Upper Aulaki Shaikh has written drawing my attention to a case (vide paragraph 2 of Weekly Letter, dated 19th October 1912) in which the Markashis—a section of the Fadthli tribe—had plundered goods belonging to cer tain Upper Aulaki tribesmen. The Shaikh requests my intervention in the mat ter with a view to a suitable compensation being paid to the sufferers. He says that his tribesmen are wild and disorderly, and he fears that a failure to com pensate the sufferers may entail reprisals which might extend beyond Fadthli territory to the British limits. I have already addressed the Fadthli on the sub ject but I have not received his reply. I am writing again impressing on him the necessity of making an early settlement. 4. The Abdali Sultan has written to say that the Imam has asked him to procure some parts of the minting machine, which have gone out of order, and that he would, with the 'Resident’s approval, obtain the same, as the service would be appreciated by the Imam and be considered an act of friendship on the part of the Abdali and the British Government. A hint has been given to the Abdali to procure the articles through the firm from which he had obtained the mint. There no longer arises the question of our neutrality since Turks and Imam have settled their differences. 6. A local news correspondent reports as follows :— 1. Hodeida is full of Turkish troops under orders for Constantinople. Soldiers from the interior of Yemen are daily arriving there. Sana’a is garrisoned by Arab soldiers. 2V.j9.

The Imam has sent out his officials with escorts to collect tithes from vari ous districts. The people are submissive to the Imam and pay the tithes willingly. The Turks have not commenced taxation pending sanction of a new Bill to be introduced in the Parliament. The bnaikhs, who usually collect the taxes, are anxiously awaiting orders to commence the work of collection which is said to be very profit able to them. The Shaikhs of Asir are said not to approve of the amnesty granted to the Idrisi Saiyid by the Sublime Porte. They desire to drive him out, as they think his presence in Asir is detrimental to the well-being of their country. &amp; ' 4 &gt;°00 Albanians have recently left for Constantinople and more are expect ed to leave shortly.

The Turks and Imam are said to be engagmg mercenaries and buying a number oi horses and donkeys in connection with their operations against the Idrisi. 4. I ha\e it on the best authority that the Consul General for Italy in Aden has addressed a letter to the Imam of Sana’a, whether in reply to a letter received from the Imam, or written for any other purpose, I do not know. This fact taken in connection with the recent advances made by Italian warships to establish a Marconi system at Mokalla by direct communication with the Sultan of that place which is under our protection, lends colour to the suspicion that Italy has aspirations in this quarter. Italy bought over the Idrisi when she was at war with Turkey, and it is common property that Turk and Imam may not remain friends for longer than suits the Imam. Though hostile at present with the Idrisi, it is quite conceiv able that the Imam would join hands with him if Turco-Imamic relations become once more strained. This matter will be watched.

The Muflahi stipendiary Shaikh of Yafa now in Aden assures me that the Imam has no active intentions towards our parts, and it is, moreover, obvious that the Turks will not countenance such acts of aggression. The initiative has doubtless been made by certain disaffected Shaikhs, who receive no doles from us, but the Yafais as a whole would oppose any hostile in cursion on the Imam’s part. It must be remembered that the whole of the Yemen was, in old times, under the Imamate of Sana’a and therefore at this juncture—peace restored with the Turks—the Imam would naturally feel an interest in parts once his, and in Shaikhs, who originally represented him in his outlying districts and acted under his imprimatur. The Imam does not recognise the boundary line ’twixt Turks and us, though the Turkish Governor-General of Yemen has of course, recently, written to say that he has written to warn their present ally against violation of the British border.

He will return to Lahej after he has seen Sir James Bell who is expected to arrive by the P. &amp; 0. steamer ‘ c Maloja ” to-morrow. 2. Please see paragraph 4 of weekly letter dated 10th August 1912. The Amir of Dthala writes that on his way to Dthala he met at Lahej Saiyid Muham mad bin Ah, the soi-disant emissary of the Imam. This individual offered him $ 100 as a present from the Imam and told him that there was a letter for him from the Imam. He also told him that the Imam intended to send him another present of a horse and to give him assistance in arms, men and provision to enable him to restore order in his country. The Imam, he said, required the Amir to fix a camp for his soldiers either at Jabal Jihaf or Sanah (Amiri). The Amir refused to accept the 100 dollars. Consequently the Saiyid got angry and refused to deliver him the Imam's letter. The Amir says that the Imam is sure to advance on Yafa and Dthala and wishes to know the line of action Government will take in such event. I am verifying the Amir’s story and if found true, I propose to send the result to the Governor General of the Yemen. Saiyid Muhammad bin AH is to my mind a mischief-monger and there is no other way of putting a stop to his machinations than by bringing instances of the same to the notice of the Governor General who is interested in watching the Imam’s attitude, or alleged inclinations in our parts and has acknowledged Turkish responsibility for the same. _ I still adhere to my opinion that the servant has outrun his master and has attributed words and let ters to the latter of which he (Muhammad Ali) is the sole author. 3. A local news correspondent reports at follows:— (1) The Idrisi’s followers of Bani Merwan are said to have given up his cause owing to his connection with the Italians and have informed the Turks, Imam and the Sharif of Mecca accordingly. (2) The Turks are said to be trying to obtain a fixed number of troops from V each Shaikh in Yemen or in default a contribution for the mainte nance of mercenaries. The object of this is believed to be to with draw the Turkish troops now in Yemen and replace them by indi genous levies. ^ jg Aden Diary, No. 39, dated the 5th October 1912 was blank.

The Sharif of Behan reports that he has been sent for by the Idrisi Saiyid. The Sharif has sent his sons to Aden for advice. I have seen them and imagine the Sharif is looking for another source of increasing his revenue qua an enhanced dole at our hands. 2. The Snbehis are again giving trouble on the trade routes. The Barhimis are said to have carried away a camel belonging to a British subject; and the Dubenis have intercepted a caravan and a camel with its load coming to Aden. The Jorabis are also said to be interrupting “ kat.” They signed an agree ment with the Abdali Sultan in March last to maintain peace on the trade routes and to have their dues collected, by the Abdali, at Dar-al-Amir —vide para graph 2 of Weekly letter, dated 6th April 1912. Major Condon had then express ed his misgivings about this arrangement lasting a fortnight. It is a wonder that it lasted for five months. 3. A local news correspondent reports that the Turks propose to levy taxes in Yemen at the rates levied before the war and that the Imam wishes to impose his own dues also. There is said to be great feeling against this double taxation and that the inhabitants of two places called A1 Awad and An-Nadira have already commenced fighting with the Turks. 4. It is reported that the Hurebi Shaikh (Upper Yafa) sent letters to the Imam but that the messenger was advised in Yemen to take them back as the Imam was too busy with his expedition against the Idrisi. They were, therefore, brought back. I believe some of our discontented Shaikhs are approaching the Imam, rather than he them. The discontent arises from their exclusion from our list of stipen diaries. 5. Reports regarding the Imam s victories over the Idrisi Saiyid and the latter’s flight continue to come in.

The ‘ Amir of Dthala writes that on his return to Dthala he found the Head Shaikh of the Azraki, Hasan Ahmed, was creating trouble in the country and endeavouring to waylay a caravan from Aden going to Yemen ; that he summoned the Azrakis and arranged with them for the safety of the trade route ; that the Azrakis, who dis approved of the Shaikh’s conduct, deposed him and appointed his cousin, Husein Saleh, in his place ; and that in consequence a fight ensued resulting in three killed and two wounded, A truce has been concluded owing to Ramzan Id. 3. News from reliable sources has been received to the effect that the Idrisi Saiyid has received a crushing defeat at the hands of the Turks. The Saiyid’s loss is estimated at 1,500 men in killed and wounded, 2 cannons and a large quantity of arms and ammunition. The Saiyid is said to have fled. 4. It is said that the Zaranik tribe, who are constantly at loggerheads with the Turks received a large sum of money and arms from the Italians on a promise of attacking the Turks by land, while the Italians attacked them by sea, but that the Zaraniks went back on their word and did not attack the Turks. 5.

There were heavy losses on both sides. The Imam's forces captured a large quantity of arms and ammunition. The Imam has given orders for the recruitment of more troops to proceed against the Idrisi after the Ramadthan. e&lt; Food-stuffs are scarce in Aseer and the followers of the Idrisi are already feeling the pinch. The rates of grain are easier at Ibb and Taiz.' 2. The high rates of food-stuffs in the Idrisi's country cannot be reconciled with the Aden shipping by country craft almost all of which take out port clear ances for the IdrisFs ports of Maidiand Gizan. The inference is that the block ade is slack and is being energetically run by owners of country craft. The usual trade by country craft along the Somali and South Arabian Coasts is almost at a stand-still, all native vessels negotiating in the Red Sea. Dated Aden Residency, the 24th August 1912.

A Kincaid, Esq., C.V.O., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Special Department. Shaikh Muhammad Ali Mohsin Askar of Mausatta (Upper Yafa) writes that the Akils of Yafa, who are not subsidized by Government, are in communication with the Imam. He says that they wrote to the Imam asking for monthly stipends, but that the latter replied that he would grant them the same rights which their fore fathers enjoyed; that^ this has caused much excitement among the Akils, who might create trouble in Mausatta. Shaikh Muhammad Ali suggests our granting the stipends thereby winning over the discontented Akils. g g This is extremely chimerical as Sultans and Shaikhs are like “ the caterpillars innumerable ” and again we should net-in a very useless rabble, who would mis construe our action as weakness. Yafa is a House divided against itself, and we have many stipendiaries there to whom the name of Imam—or “ A1 Mundai ” the Pretender—is anathema. The Imam, if he got a foothold in Yafa, which is improbable, would live to regret his precipitate act. We yet await the reply to our letter addressed to Governor-General at Sana’a in which he is asked to restrain the Imam from committing an unfriendly act. 2. A local news correspondent reports as follows :— That Sana a is not so full of troops now as before; that grain is scarce in Yemen, but that the Turks have sufficient for their immediate wants; that the people speak well of the justice and the administration of the Wali (Governor-General) ; that when the heads of the Zaidis pay a visit to the Wali, they are dismissed with presents ; that the residents of Hodeida have removed their families to the interior for fear of the Italian bombardments ; and that Shaikh Said is well protected with troops and provisions.

Please see paragraph 3 of weekly letter, dated 11th May last. The Shaikh of Juban, to whom I wrote that we did not claim Juban as part of our Protectorate, has sent in a long letter of protest. He says that Juban formed part of Upper Yafa since time immemorial and that even the Turks and the Imam recognized it as such. He proposes to visit Aden for the purpose of making a treaty of friendship with Government.
