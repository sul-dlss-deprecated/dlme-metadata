The Government of India’s figure of Rs.1,000 for telephones should therefore be reduced to As.690 by subtracting As.310 on account of the armed police (vide P.1815/30,and 4086/30 in the attached file).

Dear Knight, Please refer to correspondence resting with Clough’s letter of the 14th instant under the above reference regarding the treatment in the accounts of expenditure relating to Aden of the cost of certain activities unconnected with the defence of Aden, and the provision of a certificate in support of the claims for the Indian contribution* It has been observed that in connection with the recent outbreak of hostilities between King Ibn Saud and the Imam of the Yemen, aeroplanes of the Aden Command proceeded to Hodeidah for the purpose of preserving order. This, of course, is a measure which is definitely extraneous to the normal functions of the Aden garrison, and such activities as these constitute the sort of contingency that we are anxious to provide against. I presume that their cost will be excluded from the claim to be rendered to this Office in due course and shall be glad to receive your confirmation. Yours sincerely, ($d,) SIDNEY TURNER 2 3 MAY 1934 . N. Knight, Esq., Air Ministry, Kingsway, J.C. 2.A. &amp; 13081/32. Political Secretary, ' Auditor, This matter has now been discussed with you and the following is a summary of the riew taken: The position in the Aden Protectorate, in military matters in particular, may be regarded as analogous to that on the North West frontier of india and defence expenditure incurred within its confines may reasonably be held to be cowered by the terms of the Agreement with His kajesty'a Government and not to infringe the Government of India P.Z. 766/33. Act. On the other hand, circumstances might arise in which acceptance of a share of expenditure relating to operations conducted beyond the border would iniringe the Act. To take an extreme case, Aden might be used as a base for operations in Somaliland, in which there would certainly be no Indian interest. It is accordingly necessary to require the Air Ministry to specify items falling in the category of extra-Protectorate expenditure. The Political Department is aware of the nature of all operations based on Aden and is, therefore, in a position to give an opinion on the legitimacy of the charges in question. This opinion will be sought by this Department on each occasion before the year's account is passed to the Auditor. As regards the terms of the certificate, it is proposed to suggest the following: ”1 certify that the attached statement of expenditure, amounting to £ ^- n respect of military and political services at Aden for the year accordance is correct, that it is compiled in with the Agreement relating to the division/2 . division of expenditure oonneoted with Aden and that: (a) the charges, including charges for stores taken from stock, incurred in respect of military operations conducted beyond the borders of the Aden Protectorate( (Either (a) or are specified ((b) to be struck (out according to (b) no charges were incurred in respect of military (circumstances operations conducted beyond the borders of the Aden Protectorate' 1 It was felt that the provision of a full certificate in these terms to the claim under reference could hardly be insisted upon if the Air Ministry found difficulty in supplying it. The Air Ministry have raised d'emi-offioially the question of the status of the signatory to certificates, suggesting an officer of the rank either of Assistant Secretary or Principal. This, it was agreed, is hardly a matter for this Office to express any decided views upon, as any signature would be regarded as carrying the authority of that Department. It is proposed to convey the requirements of this Office to the Air Ministry demi-officially in the first place and I append a draft letter for observations. (Sd.) SIDNEY TURNER. 6.2.33• I suggest certain minor alterations both in the draft | and in the record below of the discussion. We should be glad to have copies of both for record in the form in which they are finally accepted by the Auditor. (Sd.) J. G. LAITHWAITE. 7.2.33. 1/3. I agree with the amendments proposed hy Mr. Laithwaite and suggest further modifications in both the record of the discussion and in the draft letter. An amendment has also been suggested in the form of certificate to cover charges for stores ■ removed from stock. With reference to the procedure for dealing with expenditure on operations outside the Protectorate, it would be helpful if the Political Department would bring to notice any such operations, witiiouc awaiting notification by the Air Ministry of expenditure on them.

C. £.3757/33 The Political Secretary. April 3 &lt;■} The reply of the Government of India regarding the renewal of the arrangement with the Colonial Office, relating to the allocation of divisible expenditure at Aden, will be found below. It will be seen that the Government of India agree that the arrangement has been generally satisfactory. As regards the modifications stated to be - necessary in the light of subsequent developments, the following call for remark: 3 (iii) Civil Surgeon . Readjustment of charges in respect of the Civil Surgeon,in consequence of the agreement referred to,has already been taken up with the Accountant-General, Bombay. It is not clesr whether India propose to include the contribution in these divisible accounts in future and this will be ascertained. In this connection, the Government of India have lumped together the two categories of Civil Surgeon and Establishments, vide India Office letter A.G.9675/32 M.l of 27th September 1932. In both cases it was merely a question of formal embodiment of the arrangement in the agreement, 3 (iv) Telephone charges . The contribution of Rs.1,000 for telephones included Rs.310 on account of the Aden Armed police, vide p.1192 of 1930, and only Rs.690 has been charged in the divisible expenditure account. This must be made olear to the 3 (v)/ ( Colonial Office.3 (v) Allocation of rent in respect of Residency, etc. The political Secretary will doubtless note the decision, if this has not already been comaunicated to him. 3 (vii) Personal Assistant. Having regard to the views of the Chief Commissioner, with which the Government of India agree, the Colonial Office will doubtless accept the principle that the incidence of the emoluments of this officer should be the same as for the Aide-de-Camp whom 1 e replaced, although it would appear that certain additional duties carried out by him are civil rather than political. 3 (viii) end (ix) Assistant Confidential Clerk and Clerk, Arabic Branch. No question of princinle is involved here. India have simply omitted to carry out the understanding regarding incidence. See in this connection the Chief Commissioner’s letter of 3.12.32 to the Government of India, and Bombay letter of 23.12.32. It is questionable whether the Colonial Office will agree to accept the charge for three years’ arrears, as suggested by the. Government of India. 3 (xi) Water supnlied to Chief Commissioner and Personal A ..s b 1 stant. This is a fresh item regarding which no difficulty with the Colonia) Office need be anticipated. Nothing is said about the date from which the division in moieties should come into effect, but presumably it is from the 1st April 1933, i.e., for the current triennium, and it is not proposed to charge arrears.1233/33 K.l. 23?

Subjects- Divisible Aden Expenditure : Beview of arrangement relating to . With reference to the Foreign and Political Department letter HO.P/353-E/32, dated the 9th November last, I am directed to state that the Governor in Council sees no objection to the arrangement at present in force for the allocation of the divisible expenditure at Aden being renewed at the end of the current financial year, nor to inclusion in the new agreement with the Colonial Office, of the items which have cropped up after the terms of the present arrangement were settled, or are likely to come into existence in the near future. A list of such items is enclosed herewith. In this connection, I am also to refer to the Chief Commissioner^ letter ho.c/675, dated the 3rd instant, in paragraphs 2 and 3 of which the following two items for inclusion in the new%reement are suggested* (1) Assistant Confidential clerk-f Political civil (2) Clerk (Arabic Branch) - wholly Political. In the absence of any explanation for the omission to include these two items in the present agreement, the Governor in Council is not in a position to say whether, or not, these could, rightly be included now. In any case, the cost of the entire Arabic branch is ’political* and the question of charging the pay of a particular clerk to the Colonel Office hardly arises. I am to add that the items ‘’Reservist* and ’’Resident’s gig” should disappear from the new agreement.List of items which cropped up later, or are likely to come into existence in the near future 2* Cost of water supplied to the Civil Surgeon 1. Post of Stenographer i Civil* i Political* in the proportion in which their pay is shared* and Establishments* } Uote•-At present the coat of water supplied to the Chief Commissioner and his Personal Assistant is borne by the Government of India alone* Since the pay of both is shared in the ratio 50 * 50, the question of sharing the cost of free supply of water to both in the same pro portion may be considered. 3* Telephone charges - Rs.25Q0 Civil* 1000 Political. 4.

In considering the matter certain points have arisen regarding which we think it would be desirable to have further information. Will you please refer to our official letter of the 25th of July in this connection. As regards the position of the Extra Assistant Commissioner (Deputy Assistant Resident), would you be good enough to confirm that the whole of this officer’s emoluments will be borne by India.
