Sheil states that he brought the contents of this despatch to the attention of the Persian Minister [Mīrzā Taqī Khān, known as Amir Kabir], together with Hennell's recommendation that the Prince Governor of Fars [Firouz Mirza Nosrat-ed-Dowleh] should proceed without delay to Bushire. Sheil writes that the Ameer-i-Nizam [Amir-e Nezam, Mīrzā Taqī Khān's title] had anticipated Hennell's suggestion and had directed the Prince to proceed immediately with troops to Bushire. Sheil states that the Ameer-i-Nizam is not averse to the prospect of Sheik Nasir, who is now a prisoner in Tehran, returning to the Government of Bushire, providing that the Sheik can both guarantee the regular payment of the revenues of that town and agree to having a garrison within its walls. However, Sheil writes that should the Prince Governor secure possession of Bushire, it can hardly be anticipated that Sheik Nasir will be allowed to resume his authority.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x000055#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
