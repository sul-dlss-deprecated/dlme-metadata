Among the raised issues was the suggestion of setting up a Diving Court in Manama where it would be in closer touch with other courts. Letters were sent by the Political Agency to influential merchants and nakhudas (ship captains) asking them if they could sit in the court during diving cases. Also, because the diving law in Qatar and Oman was not exactly the same as the law in Bahrain, there was some discussion as to whether the cases concerning Bahrain subjects who went to Qatar and Oman for diving should be treated the same as those cases relating to divers from Qatar and Oman who had come to Bahrain. This was brought to the attention of the Ruler of Qatar for advice.The main correspondence is between the Political Agency, Bahrain, the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, (Charles Dalrymple Belgrave) and the Ruler of Qatar, Abdullah bin Qasim Al-Thani.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Divers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00027d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00027d#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00027d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
