This correspondence includes details of Mr Kadoo’s remuneration, family background, past employment and the importance of his role to the work of the British Agency in Kuwait. There is also a passing reference to the increased pay of Mr Abdul Mohsin, the Passport Clerk. Both the Political Agent and the Political Resident express the view that Foreign Office approval for an immediate increase in pay and allowances to the Kuwait Agency’s two clerks is essential for the retention of their services, given the high cost of living in Kuwait and the higher pay offered by the oil companies.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Political Agency</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office, Establishment and Organisation Department, London</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Israel Kadoo</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Personnel</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00016f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00016f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
