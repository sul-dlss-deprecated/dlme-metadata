Would you please let us know how to reply to these enquiries? Yours ever, Agency.^-2-7? [ XS 01/4750/G ] CIRCULAR No. 65 Class Z and Equivalent Reservists u Sir, The Record Offices of the Service Departments are bringing up to date the records of the Class Z and equivalent reservists. S This includes practically everyone who served in the armed services during the recent war. 2. Forms asking for details of the present employment of reservists will shortly be reaching them. Part I of these forms must be counter-signed by the employing department, and the form should therefore be sent to the Personnel Department for completion and not returned direct to the Service Department concerned. 3. It is open to members of the Foreign Service who are not in one of the reserves to volunteer for one of the armed services. But there are certain difficulties about releasing men and women who are performing essential civilian duties and anyone wishing to ( volunteer must therefore seek the advice of the Personnel Department in the first instance. 4. A similar circular has been addressed to His Majesty’s Representatives (as No. (L09). I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, C. R. ATTLEE. His Majesty’s Consular Officers 16388 39266-23His Britannic Majesty’s Service V?)4 1 On His Britannic Majesty’s Service \ UNCLASSIFIED 1+77/4/50 The Political Agency, BAHRAIN.THE RESERVES OF OFFICERS AND HOW TO JOIN THEM 1. It is hoped that as many officers as possible who have retired or have been released from either the British or Indian Armies and who fulfil the necessary conditions will volunteer to join the reconstituted Territorial Army. Full details can be obtained from the local T.A. and Auxiliary Forces Association or the nearest T.A. unit. ANY OFFICER WHO CAN SPARE THE TIME SHOULD JOIN THE TERRITORIAL ARMY. &gt; 2. There are, however, many officers who will be unable to afford the time to carry out the duties of an officer in the T.A., but who would be required to serve again, either in time of crisis whilst the present state of emergency continues, or in any future emergency. All released officers are liable to recall until the present emergency is declared at an end. In the event of recall being necessary, or in any future emergency, it is important, both to the country and to the individual, that officers should be fitted quickly into appropriate appointments. For this reason it is proposed to compile new lists of officers in reserve, so that they can be fitted smoothly and quickly into suitable appointments should the need to recall them arise. 3. Separate arrangements have been made for the following classes :— (а) Released officers of the Supplementary Reserve and the Territorial Army. —Officers of these classes who have not joined the reconstituted Supplementary Reserve or Territorial Army will, as explained in para. 5, be retained on the appropriate Reserve Lists without application until they reach the age limits applicable or the emergency ends and they apply to resign their commissions. (б) Released women officers. —A separate announcement regarding the appointment of these officers (women doctors and dentists, nursing officers and A.T.S. officers) to an appropriate Reserve will be made in due course. 4. The Supplementary Reserve of Officers is also being reformed on a limited scale to provide units of types which are not suitable for organization on a T.A. basis ; examples at present are R.E. (Transportation) and R.E. (Postal) ; other categories may be added. Officers for these units are being found by direct approach through the appropriate civilian organizations. Supplementary reserve officers who have not joined units of the post-war Supplementary Reserve (S.R.) will be automatically retained on the appropriate reserve list. 5. The Territorial Army Reserve of Officers (T.A.R.O.) is the special reserve for the Territorial Army, and entry to it will, therefore, in future be restricted to officers who have held T.A. commissions. They will thus be on the most suitable reserve to ensure that they are kept on the appropriate Regimental list and are most readily available for posting to units if required when the T.A. is embodied. Existing T.A. officers who have been released from embodied service, and who have not joined units in the reconstituted T.A., and who have not reached the age for compulsory retirement, are being transferred automatically to the T.A.R.O. They will be held to serve on that Reserve until the present emergency ends and, if they then continue service voluntarily, will be liable to be called up in a future emergency whenever the T.A. is embodied or before embodiment when necessary for the defence of the United Kingdom. 6 THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE OF OFFICERS AND THE ARMY OFFICERS EMERGENCY RESERVE ARE, HOWEVER, NOW OPEN TO RECRUITMENT, AND THE FOLLOWING CLASSES OF OFFICERS AND EX-OFFICERS ARE NOW INVITED TO JOIN (а) Ex-officers of the Regular Army who resigned with less than 10 years’ service and have not yet applied to join the R.A.R.O. (б) Released emergency commissioned officers. (c) Ex-officers who have relinquished short service commissions since the end of hostilities. {d) Retired and released officers formerly of the Indian Army, whether they held regular or emergency commissions. N.B.—Retired officers of the late Indian Army whose substantive rank is Lieut.-colonel or higher are unlikely to be able to join the T.A. owing to lack of vacancies. It is hoped therefore, that as many as possible will join the Regular Army Reserve of Officers. The essential differences between the Regular Army Reserve of Officers and the Army Officers Emergency Reserve are described in the following paragraphs. p ur p ose THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE OF OFFICERS (R.A.R.O.) 7. The Regular Army Reserve of Officers is designed to bring the Active Army up to strength, to raise units from lower to higher establishments, and to provide a reserve of officers for reinforcement ptrposes. Members are liable to be called to Army Service at a time of national emergency, or when a national emergency appears imminent. Eligibility 8. Officers of the categories mentioned in para. 6 who have been released from the British or Indian Armies are invited to join the R.A.R.O. as under :— (а) Officers with the requisite qualifications who have held ranks of any sort of major and below, up to the age of as years (S3 years for quarter-master) :— ^ R.E. R.A.S.C. R.E.M.E. R.A.E.C. R. Signals. R.A.M.C. R.A.P.C. R.A.D.C. R.A.Ch.D. R.A.O.C. R.A.V.C. R. Pnr. Corps. Int. Corps—Officers of all Arms with qualifications for employment on intelligence duties. R.M.P.—Officers of all Arms qualified in provost work. Staff—Officers of all Arms who have had staff training or experience. (б) Officers suitable for employment at regimental duty in all other Arms, provided they have not passed the following ages and held the undermentioned ranks while serving :— W/S Capt. J W/S Lieut. \ „ Quarter-master —53 years. T/Major 35 yearS ’ T/Capt. / — ' -30 years.M inutes. r* j i (c) Officers of the rank of W/S major or who have been T/lieut.-colonels provided they are below the age of 48 years. Applications from these officers will be dealt with on their individual merits. (&lt;*) Officers of the late Indian Army, provided they are below the following ages :— Majors and below ... ... ... ... ... ... 45 years. Lieut.-colonels ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 5 ° years. Brigadiers and Colonels ... ... ... ... ... 54 years. General officers ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 57 years. Notes : (x) Retired or releas:d officers formerly of Regiments of the Gurkha Brigade of the late Indian Army may apply to be appointed to the R.A.R.O. of thj Brigade of Gurkhas, and it is hoped that as many as possible will do so. (2) Officers of the late Indian Continuous Cadre of R.A.V.C. may apply to join, irrespective of age. Rank on appointment 9. Officers whose applications to join the R.A.R.O. are accepted will be appointed in the substantive rank they already hold, or, if they hold a war substantive rank of major or lower, they will be given that rank as substantive in the R.A.R.O. Substantive rank based on war substantive rank above major will not be granted. The reason for this is that, under Army Order 144 of 1947, officers who have continued to serve have been gradually losing war substantive rank above major, and it is desirable that officers who join the reserves should be in line with those who have continued to serve. In the event of an emergency, officers may be employed in higher “ temporary ” rank under the regulations then in force. THE ARMY OFFICERS EMERGENCY RESERVE (A.O.E.R.) 10. The Army Officers Emergency Reserve is a register of gentlemen who volunteer to serve as officers in any future war. All applications for registration will be considered on their merits, but applicants cannot be considered over the age of 55 years. Officers who join the A.O.E.R. will continue to be liable to recall under the emergency regulations until they lapse.' Apart from that they will have no legal liability to recall, other than whatever may be imposed by national service legislation on citizens generally in a future war. Registration on the A.O.E.R. affords, however, a means by which officers can be selected according to their qualifications for employment in any future war. Training GENERAL 11. (a) A scheme whereby officers of the R.A.R.O. may train on a voluntary basis is under consideration. If this can be arranged, a separate announcement will be made later. (ft) There will be no training for the A.O.E.R. in peace-time. The Registered Reservist Scheme 12. The Registered Reservist Scheme provides a means whereby the released officer can affiliate himself to a local T. A. unit of Anti-Aircraft Command for immediate service with that unit in the event of emergency. There is no objection to an officer registered under the Registered Reservist Scheme joining the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R., in which case he must clearly understand that he undertakes the full liability of the reserve in question, though every effort will be made to allow him to serve in an emergency initially with the unit for which he has registered. He must, however, state in his application that he is so registered. A released officer who has applied to join the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R. should not register under the Registered Reservist Scheme until he has been officially informed that his application has not been accepted. Uniform 13. Officers appointed to the R.A.R.O. in response to this invitation, when called out for service, will be issued with battle-dress and/or required to provide it and other uniform in respect of which an allowance will be issuable. Change of Address 14. Officers of the Army Reserves are required to inform the War Office of any permanent change of address. In the event of temporary absence abroad for a period of over six months officers of the R.A.R.O. are also required to obtain formal leave of absence from the War Office. This leave of absence is seldom withheld. Removal on account of age from the Army Reserves 15. Officers will be removed from the reserve on attaining the age limits for their rank. These age limits are now under consideration and will be published by Royal Warrant. 16. IF YOU ARE WILLING TO OFFER YOURSELF FOR SERVICE IN A FUTURE EMERGENCY, AND ARE UNABLE TO JOIN THE S.R. OR THE T.A., YOU SHOULD APPLY TO JOIN THE R.A.R.O. IF, FOR AGE OR OTHER REASONS YOU ARE UNABLE TO JOIN THE R A.R O. BUT ARE NONE THE LESS WILLING TO BE REGISTERED AS A VOLUNTEER FOR SERVICE AFTER THE PRESENT EMERGENCY ENDS YOU SHOULD APPLY TO JOIN THE A.O.E.R How to join 17. If you are willing to join the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R. please complete the appropriate sections of the attached form, tear it off and post it. Receipt of your application will not be acknowledged but you will be notified as soon as possible whether it has been accepted. Do not make any further enquiries until four weeks have elapsed. N.B.—As indicated in para. 6, the invitation in this leaflet is at present only extended to officers who have already held commissions, other than S.R. or 1 .A. commissions, on full pay. Applications cannot at present be considered from gentlemen who have never held commissions nor can they be accepted from officers beyond the ages set out in paras. 8 or 10 as appropriate.

R.A.S.C. R.E.M.E. R.A.E.C, R. Signals. R.A.M.C. R.A.P.C. R.A.D.C. R.A.Ch.D. R.A.O.C. R.A.V.C. R. Pnr. Corps. Int. Corps—Officers of all Arms with qualifications for employment on intelligence duties. R.M.P.—Officers of all Arms qualified in provost work. Staff—Officers of all Arms who have had staff training or experience. (б) Officers suitable for employment at regimental duty in all other Arms, provided they have not passed the following ages and held the undermentioned ranks while serving :— W/S Capt.\ T/Major J -35 years. W/S Lieut T/Capt. 30 years. Quarter-master —53 years.PART Type o Techni Course Stafi e: Brief r&lt; If be stat to join (c) Officers of the rank of W/S major or who have been I/lieut.-colonels provided they are below the age of 48 years.

Brigadiers and Colonels ... ... ... ... ... 54 years. General officers ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 57 years. Notes : (1) Retired or releas:d officers formerly of Regiments of the Gurkha Brigade of the late Indian Army may apply to be appointed to the R.A.R.O. of thi Brigade of Gurkhas, and it is hoped that as many as possible will do so. (2) Officers of the late Indian Continuous Cadre of R.A.V.C. may apply to join, irrespective of age. Rank on appointment 9. Officers whose applications to join the R.A.R.O. are accepted will be appointed in the substantive rank they already hold, or, if they hold a war substantive rank of major or lower, they will be given that rank as substantive in the R.A.R.O. Substantive rank based on war substantive rank above major will not be granted. The reason for this is that, under Army Order 144 of 1947, officers who have continued to serve have been gradually losing war substantive rank above major, and it is desirable that officers who join the reserves should be in line with those who have continued to serve. In the event of an emergency, officers may be employed in higher “ temporary ” rank under the regulations then in force. THE ARMY OFFICERS EMERGENCY RESERVE (A.O.E.R.) 10. The Army Officers Emergency Reserve is a register of gentlemen who volunteer to serve as officers in any future war. All applications for registration will be considered on their merits, but applicants cannot be considered over the age of 55 years. Officers who join the A.O.E.R. will continue to be liable to recall under the emergency regulations until they lapse. Apart from that they will have no legal liability to recall, other than whatever may be imposed by national service legislation on citizens generally in a future war. Registration on the A.O.E.R. affords, however, a means by which officers can be selected according to their qualifications for employment in any future war. Training GENERAL n. (a) A scheme whereby officers of the R.A.R.O. may train on a voluntary basis is under consideration. If this can be arranged, a separate announcement will be made later. (b) There will be no training for the A.O.E.R. in peace-time. The Registered Reservist Scheme 12. The Registered Reservist Scheme provides a means whereby the released officer can affiliate himself to a local T. A. unit of Anti-Aircraft Command for immediate service with that unit in the event of emergency. There is no objection to an officer registered under the Registered Reservist Scheme joining the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R., in which case he must clearly understand that he undertakes the full liability of the reserve in question, though every effort will be made to allow him to serve in an emergency initially with the unit for which he has registered. He must, however, state in his application that he is so registered. A released officer who has applied to join the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R. should not register under the Registered Reservist Scheme until he has been officially informed that his application has not been accepted. Uniform 13. Officers appointed to the R.A.R.O. in response to this invitation, when called out for service, will be issued with battle-dress and/or required to provide it and other uniform in respect of which an allowance will be issuable. Change of Address 14. Officers of the Army Reserves are required to inform the War Office of any permanent change of address. In the event of temporary absence abroad for a period of over six months officers of the R.A.R.O. are also required to obtain formal leave of absence from the War Office. This leave of absence is seldom withheld. Removal on account of age from the Army Reserves 15. Officers will be removed from the reserve on attaining the age limits for their rank. These age limits are now under consideration and will be published by Royal Warrant. 16. IF YOU ARE WILLING TO OFFER YOURSELF FOR SERVICE IN A FUTURE EMERGENCY, AND ARE UNABLE TO JOIN THE S.R. OR THE T.A., YOU SHOULD APPLY TO JOIN THE R.A.R.O. IF, FOR AGE OR OTHER REASONS YOU ARE UNABLE TO JOIN THE R.A.R.O.

Officers of Gurkha Regiments of the late Indian Army may apply to join the reserve of the Brigade of Gurkhas.THE RESERVES OF OFFICERS AND HOW TO JOIN THEM 1. It is hoped that as many officers as possible who have retired or have been released from either the British or Indian Armies and who fulfil the necessary conditions will volunteer to join the reconstituted Territorial Army. Full details can be obtained from the local T.A. and Auxiliary Forces Association or the nearest T.A. unit. ANY OFFICER WHO CAN SPARE THE TIME SHOULD JOIN THE TERRITORIAL ARMY. , 2. There are, however, many officers who will be unable to afford the time to carry out the duties of an officer in the T.A., but who would be required to serve again, either in time of crisis whilst the present state of emergency continues, or in any future emergency. All released officers are liable to recall until the present emergency is declared at an end. In the event of recall being necessary, or in any future emergency, it is important, both to the country and to the individual, that officers should be fitted quickly into appropriate appointments. For this reason it is proposed to compile new lists of officers in reserve, so that they can be fitted smoothly and quickly into suitable appointments should the need to recall them arise. 3. Separate arrangements have been made for the following classes (a) Released officers of the Supplementary Reserve and the Territorial Army— Officers of these classes who have no/ joined the reconstituted Supplementary Reserve or Territorial Army will, as explained in para. 5, be retained on the appropriate Reserve Lists without application until they reach the age limits applicable or the emergency ends and they apply to resign their commissions. {b) Released women officers. —A separate announcement regarding the appointment of these officers (women doctors and dentists, nursing officers and A.T.S. officers) to an appropriate Reserve will be made in due course. 4. The Supplementary Reserve of Officers is also being reformed on a limited scale to provide units of types which are not suitable for organization on a T.A. basis ; examples at present are R.E. (Transportation) and R.E. (Postal) ; other categories may be added. Officers for these units are being found by direct approach through the appropriate civilian organizations. Supplementary reserve officers who have not joined units of the post-war Supplementary Reserve (S.R.) will be automatically retained on the appropriate reserve list. 5. The Territorial Army Reserve of Officers (T.A.R.O.) is the special reserve for the Territorial Army, and entry to it will therefore, in future be restricted to officers who have held T.A. commissions. They will thus be on the most suitable reserve to ensure that they are kept on the appropriate Regimental list and are most readily available for posting to units if required when the T.A. is embodied. Existing T.A. officers who have been released from embodied service, and who have not joined units in the reconstituted T.A., and who have not reached the age for compulsory retirement, are being transferred automatically to the T.A.R.O. They will be held to serve on that Reserve until the present emergency ends and, if they then continue service voluntarily, will be liable to be called up in a future emergency whenever the T.A. is embodied or before embodiment when necessary for the defence of the United Kingdom. 6. THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE OF OFFICERS AND THE ARMY OFFICERS EMERGENCY RESERVE ARE HOWEVER, NOW OPEN TO RECRUITMENT, AND THE FOLLOWING CLASSES OF OFFICERS AND EX-OFFICERS ARE NOW INVITED TO JOIN (a) Ex-officers of the Regular Army who resigned with less than 10 years’ service and have not yet applied to join the R.A.R.O. (b) Released emergency commissioned officers. (c) Ex-officers who have relinquished short service commissions since the end of hostilities. (d) Retired and released officers formerly of the Indian Army, whether they held regular or emergency commissions. N B Retired officers of the late Indian Army whose substantive rank is Lieut.-colonel or higher are unlikely to be able to join the T.A. owing to lack of vacancies. It is hoped therefore, that as many as possible will join the Regular Army Reserve of Officers. , ^ „ The essential differences between the Regular Army Reserve of Officers and the Army Officers Emergency Reserve are described in the following paragraphs. Pur p ose THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE OF OFFICERS (R.A.R.O.) 7 The Regular Army Reserve of Officers is designed to bring the Active Army up to strength, to raise units from lower to higher establishments, and to provide a reserve of officers for reinforcement purposes.

PART IV TO BE COMPLETED BY OFFICERS OF THE LATE INDIAN ARMY Type of commission and date Decorations Previous O.R. service (i/ any) Technical, academic or other qualifications Courses attended Staff experience (i/ any) Brief record of service :— If applicant was formerly of the Indian Armoured Corps or Indian Infantry three choices of British Service Regiments should be stated, with details of any family, territorial or other claim. Officers of Gurkha Regiments of the late Indian Army may app y to join the reserve of the Brigade of Gurkhas.aid ply THE RESERVES OF OFFICERS AND HOW TO JOIN THEM 1. It is hoped that as many officers as possible who have retired or have been released from either the British or Indian Armies and who fulfil the necessary conditions will volunteer to join the reconstituted Territorial Army. Full details can be obtained from the local T.A. and Auxiliary Forces Association or the nearest T.A. unit. ANY OFFICER WHO CAN SPARE THE TIME SHOULD JOIN THE TERRITORIAL ARMY. 2. There are, however, many officers who will be unable to afford the time to carry out the duties of an officer in the T.A., but who would be required to serve again, either in time of crisis whilst the present state of emergency continues, or in any future emergency. All released officers are liable to recall until the present emergency is declared at an end. In the event of recall being necessary, or in any future emergency, it is important, both to the country and to the individual, that officers should be fitted quickly into appropriate appointments. For this reason it is proposed to compile new lists of officers in reserve, so that they can be fitted smoothly and quickly into suitable appointments should the need to recall them arise. 3. Separate arrangements have been made ior the following classes (a) Released officers of the Supplementary Reserve and the Territorial Army— Officers of these classes who have not joined the reconstituted Supplementary Reserve or Territorial Army will, as explained in para. 5, be retained on the appropriate Reserve Lists without application until they reach the age limits applicable or the emergency ends and they apply to resign their commissions. (b) Released women officers. —A separate announcement regarding the appointment of these officers (women doctors and dentists, nursing officers and A.T.S. officers) to an appropriate Reserve will be made in due course. 4. The Supplementary Reserve of Officers is also being reformed on a limited scale to provide units of types which are not suitable for organization on a T.A. basis ; examples at present are R.E. (Transportation) and R.E. (Postal) ; other categories may be added. Officers for these units are being found by direct approach through the appropriate civilian organizations. Supplementary reserve officers who have not joined units of the post-war Supplementary Reserve (S.R.) will be automatically retained on the appropriate reserve list. 5. The Territorial Army Reserve of Officers (T.A.R.O.) is the special reserve for the Territorial Army, and entry to it will, therefore, in future be restricted to officers who have held T.A. commissions. They will thus be on the most suitable reserve to ensure that they are kept on the appropriate Regimental list and are most readily available for posting to units if required when the T.A. is embodied. Existing I .A. officers who have been released from embodied service, and who have not joined units in the reconstituted I.A., and who have not reached the age for compulsory retirement, are being transferred automatically to the T.A.R.O. They will be held to serve on that Reserve until the present emergency ends and, if they then continue service voluntarily, will be liable to be called up in a future emergency whenever the T.A. is embodied or before embodiment when necessary for the defence of the United Ivingdom. 6 THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE OF OFFICERS AND THE ARMY OFFICERS EMERGENCY RESERVE ARE, HOWEVER, NOW OPEN TO RECRUITMENT, AND THE FOLLOWING CLASSES OF OFFICERS AND EX-OFFICERS ARE NOW INVITED TO JOIN :— (а) Ex-officers of the Regular Army who resigned with less than 10 years’ service and have not yet applied to join the R.A.R.O. (б) Released emergency commissioned officers. (c) Ex-officers who have relinquished short service commissions since the end of hostilities. (d) Retired and released officers formerly of the Indian Army, whether they held regular or emergency commissions. N b Retired officers of the late Indian Army whose substantive rank is Lieut.-colonel or higher are unlikely to be able to join the T.A. owing to lack of vacancies. It is hoped therefore, that as many as possible will join the Regular Army The essential differences between the Regular Army Reserve of Officers and the Army Officers Emergency Reserve are described in the following paragraphs. Pur p ose THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE OF OFFICERS (R.A.R.O.) 7 The Regular Army Reserve of Officers is designed to bring the Active Army up to strength, to raise units from lower to higher establishments, and to provide a reserve of officers for reinforcement purposes. Members are liable to be called to Army Service at a time of national emergency, or when a national emergency appears imminent. Eligibility 8. Officers of the categories mentioned in para. 6 who have been released from the British or Indian Armies are invited to join the R.A.R.O. as under :— . , . ,, (а) Officers with the requisite qualifications who have held ranks of any sort of major and below, up to the age of 45 years (53 years for quarter-master):— ^ „ r\FT r.E. R.A.S.C. R.E.M.E. R.A.E.U R. Signals. R.A.M.C. R.A.P.C. R.A.D.C. R.A.Ch.D. R.A.O.C. R.A.V.C. H- Pnr. Corps. Int. Corps—Officers of all Arms with qualifications for employment on intelligence duties. R.M.P.—Officers of all Arms qualified in provost work. Staff—Officers of all Anns who have had staff training or experience. (б) Officers suitable for employment at regimental duty in all other Arms, provided they have not passed the following ages and held the undermentioned ranks while serving :— W/S Capt.J W/S Lieut. \ Quarter-master—53 years. T/Major / 30 yearS * T/Capt. / -30 years.PART Type c Techni Course Staff e Brief r If be sta te joir M inutes. fs (c) Officers of the rank of W/S major or who have been T/lieut.-colonels provided they are below the age of 48 years. Applications from these officers will be dealt with on their individual merits. (d) Officers of the late Indian Army, provided they are below the following ages :— Majors and below Lieut.-colonels Brigadiers and Colonels General officers ... Notes 45 years. 50 years. 54 years. 57 years. (1) Retired or released officers formerly of Regiments of the Gurkha Brigade of the late Indian Army may apply to be appointed to the R.A.R.O. of th^ Brigade of Gurkhas, and it is hoped that as many as possible will do so. (2) Officers of the late Indian Continuous Cadre of R.A.V.C. may apply to join, irrespective of age. Rank on appointment 9. Officers whose applications to join the R.A.R.O. are accepted will be appointed in the substantive rank they already hold, or, if they hold a war substantive rank of major or lower, they will be given that rank as substantive in the R.A.R.O. Substantive rank based on war substantive rank above major will not be granted. The reason for this is that, under Army Order 144 of 1947 - officers who have continued to serve have been gradually losing war substantive rank above major, and it is desirable that officers who join the reserves should be in line with those who have continued to serve. In the event of an emergency, officers may be employed in higher “ temporary ” rank under the regulations then in force. THE ARMY OFFICERS EMERGENCY RESERVE (A.O.E.R.) 10. The Army Officers Emergency Reserve is a register of gentlemen who volunteer to serve as officers in any future war. All applications for registration will be considered on their merits, but applicants cannot be considered over the a^e 55 years. Officers who join the A.O.E.R. will continue to be liable to recall under the emergency regulations until they lapse. Apart from that they will have no legal liability to recall, other than whatever may be imposed by national service legislation on citizens generally in a future war. Registration on the A.O.E.R. affords, however, a means by which officers can be selected according to their qualifications for employment in any future war. If this can Training GENERAL 11. \a) A scheme whereby officers of the R.A.R.O. may train on a voluntary basis is under consideration, be arranged, a separate announcement will be made later. {b) There will be no training for the A.O.E.R. in peace-time. The Registered Reservist Scheme 12. The Registered Reservist Scheme provides a means whereby the released officer can affiliate himself to a local T-A. unit of Anti-Aircraft Command for immediate service with that unit in the event of emergency There is no objection to an officer registered under the Registered Reservist Scheme joining the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R., in which case he must clearly understand that he undertakes the full liability of the reserve in question, though every effort will be made to allow him to serve in an emergency initially with the unit for which he has registered. He must, however, state in his application mat he is so registered A released officer who has applied to join the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R. should not register under the Registered Reservist Scheme until he has been officially informed that his application has not been accepted. U niform u J3- Officers appointed to the R.A.R.O. in response to this invitation, when called out for service, will be issued with battle-dress and/or required to provide it and other uniform in respect of which an allowance will be issuable. Change of Address 14. Officers of the Army Reserves are required to inform the War Office of any permanent change of address. In the event of temporary absence abroad for a period of over six months officers of the R.A.R.O. are also required to obtain formal leave of absence from the War Office. This leave of absence is seldom withheld. Removal on account of age from the Army Reserves ^ ° n attainill g the a g e limi ts for their rank. These age limits are now under consideration and will be published by Royal Warrant. 16. IF T OU ARE WILLING TO OFFER YOURSELF FOR SERVICE IN A FUTURE EMERGENCY AND ARE UNABLE TO JOIN THE S.R.

It is hoped that as many officers as possible who have retired or have been released from either the British or Indian Armies and who fulfil the necessary conditions will volunteer to join the reconstituted Territorial Army. Full details can be obtained from the local T.A. and Auxiliary Forces Association or the nearest T.A. unit. ANY OFFICER WHO CAN SPARE THE TIME SHOULD JOIN THE TERRITORIAL ARMY. &gt; 2. There are, however, many officers who will be unable to afford the time to carry out the duties of an officer in the T.A., but who would be required to serve again, either in time of crisis whilst the present state of emergency continues, or in any future emergency. All released officers are liable to recall until the present emergency is declared at an end. In the event of recall being necessary, or in any future emergency, it is important, both to the country and to the individual, that officers should be fitted quickly into appropriate appointments. For this reason it is proposed to compile new lists of officers in reserve, so that they can be fitted smoothly and quickly into suitable appointments should the need to recall them arise. 3. Separate arrangements have been made for the following classes :— (a) Released officers of the Supplementary Reserve and the Territorial Army. —Officers of these classes who have not joined the reconstituted Supplementary Reserve or Territorial Army will, as explained in para. 5, be retained on the appropriate Reserve Lists without application until they reach the age limits applicable or the emergency ends and they apply to resign their commissions. (b) Released women officers. —A separate announcement regarding the appointment of these officers (women doctors and dentists, nursing officers and A.T.S. officers) to an appropriate Reserve will be made in due course. 4. The Supplementary Reserve of Officers is also being reformed on a limited scale to provide units of types which are not suitable for organization on a T.A. basis ; examples at present are R.E. (Transportation) and R.E. (Postal) ; other categories may be added. Officers for these units are being found by direct approach through the appropriate civilian organizations. Supplementary reserve officers who have not joined units of the post-war Supplementary Reserve (S.R.) will be automatically retained on the appropriate reserve list. 5. The Territorial Army Reserve of Officers (T.A.R.O.) is the special reserve for the Territorial Army, and entry to it will, therefore, in future be restricted to officers who have held T.A. commissions. They will thus be on the most suitable reserve to ensure that they are kept on the appropriate Regimental list and are most readily available for posting to units if required when the T.A. is embodied. Existing T.A. officers who have been released from embodied service, and who have not joined units in the reconstituted T.A., and who have not reached the age for compulsory retirement, are being transferred automatically to the T.A.R.O. They will be held to serve on that Reserve until the present emergency ends and, if they then continue service voluntarily, will be liable to be called up in a future emergency whenever the T.A. is embodied or before embodiment when necessary for the defence of the United Kingdom. 6 THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE OF OFFICERS AND THE ARMY OFFICERS EMERGENCY RESERVE ARE, HOWEVER, NOW OPEN TO RECRUITMENT, AND THE FOLLOWING CLASSES OF OFFICERS AND EX-OFFICERS ARE NOW INVITED TO JOIN (a) Ex-officers of the Regular Army who resigned with less than 10 years’ service and have not yet applied to join the R.A.R.O. (b) Released emergency commissioned officers. (c) Ex-officers who have relinquished short service commissions since the end of hostilities. (d) Retired and released officers formerly of the Indian Army, whether they held regular or emergency commissions. N.B.—Retired officers of the late Indian Army whose substantive rank is Lieut.-colonel or higher are unlikely to be able to join the T.A. owing to lack of vacancies. It is hoped therefore, that as many as possible will join the Regular Army Reserve of Officers. The essential differences between the Regular Army Reserve of Officers and the Army Officers Emergency Reserve are described in the following paragraphs. Purpose THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE OF OFFICERS (R.A.R.O.) 7. The Regular Army Reserve of Officers is designed to bring the Active Army up to strength, to raise units from lower to higher establishments, and to provide a reserve of officers for reinforcement purposes. Members are liable to be called to Army Service at a time of national emergency, or when a national emergency appears imminent. Eligibility 8. Officers of the categories mentioned in para. 6 who have been released from the British or Indian Armies are invited to join the R.A.R.O. as under :— (а) Officers with the requisite qualifications who have held ranks of any sort of major and below, up to the age of 45 years (53 years for quarter-master) :— * R.E. R.A.S.C. R.E.M.E. R.A.E.C. R. Signals. R.A.M.C. R.A.P.C. R.A.D.C. R.A.Ch.D. R.A.O.C. R.A.V.C. R. Pnr. Corps. Int. Corps—Officers of all Arms with qualifications for employment on intelligence duties. R.M.P.—Officers of all Arms qualified in provost work. Staff—Officers of all Arms who have had staff training or experience. (б) Officers suitable for employment at regimental duty in all other Arms, provided they have not passed the following ages and held the undermentioned ranks while serving :— W/S Capt. \ W/S Lieut. \ „ 0 . jrc Quarter-master —53 years.

(2) Officers of the late Indian Continuous Cadre of R.A.V.C. may apply to join, irrespective of age. Rank on appointment 9. Officers whose applications to join the R.A.R.O. are accepted will be appointed in the substantive rank they already hold, or, if they hold a war substantive rank of major or lower, they will be given that rank as substantive in the R.A.R.O. Substantive rank based on war substantive rank above major will not be granted. The reason for this is that, under Army Order 144 of 1947, officers who have continued to serve have been gradually losing war substantive rank above major, and it is desirable that officers who join the reserves should be in line with those who have continued to serve. In the event of an emergency, officers may be employed in higher “ temporary ” rank under the regulations then in force. THE ARMY OFFICERS EMERGENCY RESERVE (A.O.E.R.) 10. The Army Officers Emergency Reserve is a register of gentlemen who volunteer to serve as officers in any future war. All applications for registration will be considered on their merits, but applicants cannot be considered over the age of 55 years. Officers who join the A.O.E.R. will continue to be liable to recall under the emergency regulations until they lapse. Apart from that they will have no legal liability to recall, other than whatever may be imposed by national service legislation on citizens generally in a future war. Registration on the A.O.E.R. affords, however, a means by which officers can be selected according to their qualifications for employment in any future war. Training GENERAL 11. (a) A scheme whereby officers of the R.A.R.O. may train on a voluntary basis is under consideration. If this can be arranged, a separate announcement will be made later (b) There will be no training for the A.O.E.R. in peace-time. The Registered Reservist Scheme 12. The Registered Reservist Scheme provides a means whereby the released officer can affiliate himself to a local T. A. unit of Anti-Aircraft Command for immediate service with that unit in the event of emergency. There is no objection to an officer registered under the Registered Reservist .Scheme joining the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R., in which case he must clearly understand that he undertakes the full liability of the reserve in question, though every effort will be made to allow him to serve in an emergency initially with the unit for which he has registered. He must, however, state in his application that he is so registered. A released officer who has applied to join the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R. should not register under the Registered Reservist Scheme until he has been officially informed that his application has not been accepted. U niform 13. Officers appointed to the R.A.R.O. in response to this invitation, when called out for service, will be issued with battle-dress and/or required to provide it and other uniform in respect of which an allowance will be issuable. Change of Address 14. Officers of the Army Reserves are required to inform the War Office of any permanent change of address. In the event of temporary absence abroad for a period of over six months officers of the R.A.R.O. are also required to obtain formal leave of absence from the War Office. This leave of absence is seldom withheld. Removal on account of age from the Army Reserves 15. Officers will be removed from the reserve on attaining the age limits for their rank. These age limits are now under consideration and will be published by Royal Warrant. 16. IF YOU ARE WILLING TO OFFER YOURSELF FOR SERVICE IN A FUTURE EMERGENCY, AND ARE UNABLE TO JOIN THE S.R. OR THE T.A., YOU SHOULD APPLY TO JOIN THE R.A.R.O. IF, FOR AGE OR OTHER REASONS YOU ARE UNABLE TO JOIN THE RARO BUT ARE NONE THE LESS WILLING TO BE REGISTERED AS A VOLUNTEER FOR SERVICE AFTER THE PRESENT EMERGENCY ENDS YOU SHOULD APPLY TO JOIN THE A.O.E.R How to join 17.

Receipt of your application will not be acknowledged but you will be notified as soon as possible whether it has been accepted. Do not make any further enquiries until four weeks have elapsed. N.B.—As indicated in para. 6, the invitation in this leaflet is at present only extended to officers who have already held commissions, other than S.R. or T.A. commissions, on full pay. Applications cannot at present be considered from gentlemen who have never held commissions nor can they be accepted from officers beyond the ages set out in paras. 8 or 10 as appropriate.(Note. — An officer of the late Indian Army must also complete PART IV). tY1306/5O) 20,000 3/50 W.O.l’. 33035.

Officers of Gurkha Regiments of the late Indian Army may apply to join the reserve of the Brigade of Gurkhas.THE RESERVES OF OFFICERS AND HOW TO JOIN THEM 1. It is hoped that as many officers as possible who have retired or have been released from either the British or Indian Armies and who fulfil the necessary conditions will volunteer to join the reconstituted Territorial Army. Full details can be obtained from the local T.A. and Auxiliary Forces Association or the nearest T.A. unit. ANY OFFICER WHO CAN SPARE THE TIME SHOULD JOIN THE TERRITORIAL ARMY. , 2. There are, however, many officers who will be unable to afford the time to carry out the duties of an officer in the T.A., but who would be required t© serve again, either in time of crisis whilst the present state of emergency continues, or in any future emergency. All released officers are liable to recall until the present emergency is declared at an end. In the event of recall being necessary, or in any future emergency, it is important, both to the country and to the individual, that officers should be fitted quickly into appropriate appointments. For this reason it is proposed to compile new lists of officers in reserve, so that they can be fitted smoothly and quickly into suitable appointments should the need to recall them arise. 3. Separate arrangements have been made for the following classes (a) Released officers of the Supplementary Reserve and the Territorial Army.— Officers of these classes who have not joined the reconstituted Supplementary Reserve or Territorial Army will, as explained in para. 5, be retained on the appropriate Reserve Lists without application until they reach the age limits applicable or the emergency ends and they apply to resign their commissions. {b) Released women Officers. —A separate announcement regarding the appointment of these officers (women doctors and dentists, nursing officers and A.T.S. officers) to an appropriate Reserve will be made in due course. 4. The Supplementary Reserve of Officers is also being reformed on a limited scale to provide units of types which are not suitable for organization on a T.A. basis ; examples at present are R.E. (Transportation) and R.E. (Postal) ; other categories may be added. Officers for these units are being found by direct approach through the appropriate civilian organizations. Supplementary reserve officers who have not joined units of the post-war Supplementary Reserve (S.R.) will be automatically retained on the appropriate reserve list. 5. The Territorial Army Reserve of Officers (T.A.R.O.) is the special reserve for the Territorial Army, and entry to it will, therefore, in future be restricted to officers who have held T.A. commissions. They will thus be on the most suitable reserve to ensure that they are kept on the appropriate Regimental list and are most readily available for posting to units if required when the T.A. is embodied. Existing T.A. officers who have been released from embodied service, and who have not joined units in the reconstituted T.A., and who have not reached the age for compulsory retirement, are being transferred automatically to the T.A.R.O. They will be held to serve on that Reserve until the present emergency ends and, if they then continue service voluntarily, will be liable to be called up in a future emergency whenever the T.A. is embodied or before embodiment when necessary for the defence of the United Kingdom. 6. THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE OF OFFICERS AND THE ARMY OFFICERS EMERGENCY RESERVE ARE, HOWEVER, NOW OPEN TO RECRUITMENT, AND THE FOLLOWING CLASSES OF OFFICERS AND EX-OFFICERS ARE NOW INVITED TO JOIN (a) Ex-officers of the Regular Army who resigned with less than 10 years’ service and have not yet applied to join the R.A.R.O.

Apart from that they will have no legal liability to recall, other than whatever may be imposed by national service legislation on citizens generally in a future war. Registration on the A.O.E.R. affords, however, a means by which officers can be selected according to their qualifications for employment in any future war. Training GENERAL 11. (a) A scheme whereby officers of the R.A.R.O. may train on a voluntary basis is under consideration. If this can be arranged, a separate announcement will be made later (6) There will be no training for the A.O.E.R. in peace-time. The Registered Reservist Scheme 12. The Registered Reservist Scheme provides a means whereby the released officer can affiliate himself to a local T.A. unit of Anti-Aircraft Command for immediate service with that unit in the event of emergency. There is no objection to an officer registered under the Registered Reservist Scheme joining the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R., in which case he must clearly understand that he undertakes the full liability of the reserve in question, though every effort will be made to allow him to serve in an emergency initially with the unit for which he has registered. He must, however, state in his application that he is so registered. A released officer who has applied to join the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R. should not register under the Registered Reservist Scheme until he has been officially informed that his application has not been accepted. Uniform IS- Officers appointed to the R.A.R.O. in response to this invitation, when called out for service, will be issued with battle-dress and/or required to provide it and other uniform in respect of which an allowance will be issuable. Change of Address 14. Officers of the Army Reserves are required to inform the War Office of any permanent change of address. In the event of temporary absence abroad for a period of over six months officers of the R.A.R.O. are also required to obtain formal leave of absence from the War Office. This leave of absence is seldom withheld. Removal on account of age from the Army Reserves 15. Officers will be removed from the reserve on attaining the age limits for their rank consideration and will be published by Royal Warrant.

Officers of Gurkha Regiments of the late Indian Army may apply to join the reserve of the Brigade of Gurkhas. W &amp; C? ta OTHE RESERVES OF OFFICERS AND HOW TO JOIN THEM 1. It is hoped that as many officers as possible who have retired or have been released from either the British or Indian Armies and who fulfil the necessary conditions will volunteer to join the reconstituted Territorial Army. Full details can be obtained from the local T.A. and Auxiliary Forces Association or the nearest T.A. unit. ANY OFFICER WHO CAN SPARE THE TIME SHOULD JOIN THE TERRITORIAL ARMY. , 2. There are, however, many officers who will be unable to afford the time to carry out the duties of an officer in the T.A., but who would be required to serve again, either in time of crisis whilst the present state of emergency continues, or in any future emergency. All released officers are liable to recall until the present emergency is declared at an end. In the event of recall being necessary, or in any future emergency, it is important, both to the country and to the individual, that officers should be fitted quickly into appropriate appointments. For this reason it is proposed to compile new lists of officers in reserve, so that they can be fitted smoothly and quickly into suitable appointments should the need to recall them arise. 3. Separate arrangements have been made lor the following classes :— (а) Released officers of the Supplementary Reserve and the Territorial Army. —Officers of these classes who have not joined the reconstituted Supplementary Reserve or Territorial Army will, as explained in para. 5, be retained on the appropriate Reserve Lists without application until they reach the age limits applicable or the emergency ends and they apply to resign their commissions. (б) Released women officers. —A separate announcement regarding the appointment of these officers (women doctors and dentists, nursing officers and A.T.S. officers) to an appropriate Reserve will be made in due course. 4. The Supplementary Reserve of Officers is also being reformed on a limited scale to provide units of types which are not suitable for organization on a T.A. basis ; examples at present are R.E. (Transportation) and R.E. (Postal) ; other categories may be added. Officers for these units are being found by direct approach through the appropriate civilian organizations. Supplementary reserve officers who have not joined units of the post-war Supplementary Reserve (S.R.) will be automatically retained on the appropriate reserve list. 5. The Territorial Army Reserve of Officers (T.A.R.O.) is the special reserve for the Territorial Army, and entry to it will, therefore, in future be restricted to officers who have held T.A. commissions. They will thus be on the most suitable reserve to ensure that they are kept on the appropriate Regimental list and are most readily available for posting to units if required when the T.A. is embodied. Existing T.A. officers who have been released from embodied service, and who have not joined units in the reconstituted T.A., and who have not reached the age for compulsory retirement, are being transferred automatically to the T.A.R.O. They will be held to serve on that Reserve until the present emergency ends and, if they then continue service voluntarily, will be liable to be called up in a future emergency whenever the T.A. is embodied or before embodiment when necessary for the defence of the United Kingdom. 6 THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE OF OFFICERS AND THE ARMY OFFICERS EMERGENCY RESERVE ARE, HOWEVER, NOW OPEN TO RECRUITMENT, AND THE FOLLOWING CLASSES OF OFFICERS AND EX-OFFICERS ARE NOW INVITED TO JOIN (a) Ex-officers of the Regular Army who resigned with less than 10 years’ service and have not yet applied to join the R.A.R.O. [h) Released emergency commissioned officers. (c) Ex-officers who have relinquished short service commissions since the end of hostilities. {d) Retired and released officers formerly of the Indian Army, whether they held regular or emergency commissions. N.B. Retired officers of the late Indian Army whose substantive rank is Lieut.-colonel or higher are unlikely to be able to join the T.A. owing to lack of vacancies. It is hoped therefore, that as many as possible will join the Regular Army Reserve of Officers. _ „ The essential diff erences between the Regular Army Reserve of Officers and the Army Officers Emergency Reserve are described in the following paragraphs. p ur p ose THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE OP OFFICERS (R.A.R.O.) 7. The Regular Army Reserve of Officers is designed to bring the Active Army up to strength, to raise units from lower to higher establishments, and to provide a reserve of officers for reinforcement purposes. Members are liable to be called to Army Service at a time of national emergency, or when a national emergency appears imminent. 6 who have been released from the British or Indian Armies are Eligibility 8. Officers of the categories mentioned in para, invited to join the R.A.R.O. as under :— (a) Officers with the requisite qualifications who have held ranks of any sort of major and below, up to the age of 45 vears (53 years for quarter-master) :— 45 7 R.E. R.A.S.C. R.E.M.E. R.A.E.C. R. Signals. R.A.M.C. R.A.P.C. R.A.D.C. R.A.Ch.D. R.A.O.C. R.A.V.C. R. Pnr. Corps. Int. Corps—Officers of all Arms with qualifications for employment on intelligence duties. R.M.P.—Officers of all Arms qualified in provost work. Staff—Officers of all Arms who have had staff training or experience. (b) Officers suitable for employment at regimental duty in all other Arms, provided they have not passed the following ages and held the undermentioned ranks while serving :— W/S Capt. 1 W/S Lieut. \ _ Quarter-master —53 years. T/Major P Y™™- T/Capt. ) -30 years.Minutes. The War Office, December, 1948 . rs 48 years. Applications from these officers will be dealt with on their individual merits. (d) Officers of the late Indian Army, provided they are below the following ages :— (c) Officers of the rank of W/S major or who have been T/lieut.-colonels provided they are below the age of Majors and below Lieut.-colonels 45 years. 50 years. 54 years. 57 years. Brigadiers and Colonels General officers ... Notes : (1) Retired or releas:d officers formerly of Regiments of the Gurkha Brigade of the late Indian Army may apply to be appointed to the R.A.R.O. of thj Brigade of Gurkhas, and it is hoped that as many as possible will do so. (2) Officers of the late Indian Continuous Cadre of R.A.V.C. may apply to join, irrespective of age. Rank on appointment 9. Officers whose applications to join the R.A.R.O. are accepted will be appointed in the substantive rank they already hold, or, if they hold a war substantive rank of major or lower, they will be given that rank as substantive in the R.A.R.O. Substantive rank based on war substantive rank above major will not be granted. The reason for this is that, under Army Order 144 of 1947, officers who have continued to serve have been gradually losing war substantive rank above major, and it is desirable that officers who join the reserves should be in line with those who have continued to serve. In the event of an emergency, officers may be employed in higher “ temporary ” rank under the regulations then in force. THE ARMY OFFICERS EMERGENCY RESERVE (A.O.E.R.) 10. The Army Officers Emergency Reserve is a register of gentlemen who volunteer to serve as officers in any future war. All applications for registration will be considered on their merits, but applicants cannot be considered over the age °f 55 years. Officers who join the A.O.E.R. will continue to be liable to recall under the emergency regulations until they lapse. Apart from that they will have no legal liability to recall, other than whatever may be imposed by national service legislation on citizens generally in a future war. Registration on the A.O.E.R. affords, however, a means by which officers can be selected according to their qualifications for employment in any future war. Training GENERAL 11. (&lt;z) A scheme whereby officers of the R.A.R.O. may train on a voluntary basis is under consideration. If this can be arranged, a separate announcement will be made later (6) There will be no training for the A.O.E.R. in peace-time. The Registered Reservist Scheme 12. The Registered Reservist Scheme provides a means whereby the released officer can affiliate himself to a local T.A. unit of Anti-Aircraft Command for immediate service with that unit in the event of emergency. There is no objection to an officer registered under the Registered Reservist Scheme joining the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R., in which case he must clearly understand that he undertakes the full liability of the reserve in question, though every effort will be made to allow him to serve in an emergency initially with the unit for which he has registered. He must, however, state in his application that he is so registered. A released officer who has applied to join the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R. should not register under the Registered Reservist Scheme until he has been officially informed that his application has not been accepted. 13. Officers appointed to the R.A.R.O. in response to this invitation, when called out for service, will be issued with battle-dress and/or required to provide it and other uniform in respect of which an allowance will be issuable. Change of Address 14. Officers of the Army Reserves are required to inform the War Office of any permanent change of address. In the event of temporary absence abroad for a period of over six months officers of the R.A.R.O. are also required to obtain formal leave of absence from the War Office.

Officers of Gurkha Regiments of the late Indian Army may apply to join the reserve of the Brigade of Gurkhas.THE RESERVES OF OFFICERS AND HOW TO JOIN THEM 1. It is hoped that as many officers as possible who have retired or have been released from either the British or Indian Armies and who fulfil the necessary conditions will volunteer to join the reconstituted Territorial Army. Full details can be obtained from the local T.A. and Auxiliary Forces Association or the nearest T.A. unit. ANY OFFICER WHO CAN SPARE THE TIME SHOULD JOIN THE TERRITORIAL ARMY. , 2. There are, however, many officers who will be unable to afford the time to carry out the duties of an officer in the T.A., but who would be required to serve again, either in time of crisis whilst the present state of emergency continues, or in any future emergency. All released officers are liable to recall until the present emergency is declared at an end. In the event of recall being necessary, or in any future emergency, it is important, both to the country and to the individual, that officers should be fitted quickly into appropriate appointments. For this reason it is proposed to compile new lists of officers in reserve, so that they can be fitted smoothly and quickly into suitable appointments should the need to recall them arise. 3. Separate arrangements have been made lor the following classes :— (а) Released officers of the Supplementary Reserve and the Territorial Army. —Officers of these classes who have not joined the reconstituted Supplementary Reserve or Territorial Army will, as explained in para. 5, be retained on the appropriate Reserve Lists without application until they reach the age limits applicable or the' emergency ends and they apply to resign their commissions. (б) Released women officers. —A separate announcement regarding the appointment of these officers (women doctors and dentists, nursing officers and A.T.S. officers) to an appropriate Reserve will be made in due course. 4. The Supplementary Reserve of Officers is also being reformed on a limited scale to provide units of types which are not suitable for organization on a T.A. basis ; examples at present are R.E. (Transportation) and R.E. (Postal) ; other categories may be added. Officers for these units are being found by direct approach through the appropriate civilian organizations. Supplementary reserve officers who have not joined units of the post-war Supplementary Reserve (S.R.) will be automatically retained on the appropriate reserve list. 5. The Territorial Army Reserve of Officers (T.A.R.O.) is the special reserve for the Territorial Army, and entry to it will, therefore, in future be restricted to officers who have held T.A. commissions. They will thus be on the most suitable reserve to ensure that they are kept on the appropriate Regimental list and are most readily available for posting to units if required when the T.A. is embodied. Existing T.A. officers who have been released from embodied service, and who have not joined units in the reconstituted T.A., and who have not reached the age for compulsory retirement, are being transferred automatically to the T.A.R.O. I hey will be held to serve on that Reserve until the present emergency ends and, if they then continue service voluntarily, will be liable to be called up in a future emergency whenever the T.A. is embodied or before embodiment when necessary for the defence of the I nited Kingdom. 6. THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE OF OFFICERS AND THE ARMY OFFICERS EMERGENCY RESERVE ARE, HOWEVER, NOW OPEN TO RECRUITMENT, AND THE FOLLOWING CLASSES OF OFFICERS AND EX-OFFICERS ARE NOW INVITED TO JOIN (а) Ex-officers of the Regular Army who resigned with less than 10 years’ service and have not yet applied to join the R.A.R.O. (б) Released emergency commissioned officers. (c) Ex-officers who have relinquished short service commissions since the end of hostilities. {d) Retired and released officers formerly of the Indian Army, whether they held regular or emergency commissions. N.B. Retired officers of the late Indian Army whose substantive rank is Lieut.-colonel or higher are unlikely to be able to join the T.A. owing to lack of vacancies. It is hoped therefore, that as many as possible will join the Regular Army Reserve of Officers. The essential differences between the Regular Army Reserve of Officers and the Army Officers Emergency Reserve are described in the following paragraphs. Pur p ose THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE OF OFFICERS (R.A.R.O.) 7. The Regular Army Reserve of Officers is designed to bring the Active Army up to strength, to raise units from lower to higher establishments, and to provide a reserve of officers for reinforcement purposes. Members are liable to be called to Army Service at a time of national emergency, or when a national emergency appears imminent. Eligibility 8 . Officers of the categories mentioned in para. 6 who have been released from the British or Indian Armies are invited to join the R.A.R.O. as under :— (а) Officers with the requisite qualifications who have held ranks of any sort of major and below, up to the age of 4s years (‘n years for quarter-master) :— R.E. R.A.S.C. R.E.M.E. R.A.E.C. R. Signals. R.A.M.C. R.A.P.C. R.A.D.C. R.A.Ch.D. R.A.O.C. R.A.V.C. R. Pnr. Corps. Int. Corps—Officers of all Arms with qualifications for employment on intelligence duties. R.M.P.—Officers of all Arms qualified in provost work. Staff—Officers of all Arms who have had staff training or experience. ( б ) Officers suitable for employment at regimental duty in all other Arms, provided they have not passed the following ages and held the undermentioned ranks while serving :— W/S Capt.\ T/Major J -35 years. W/S Lieut T/Capt -30 years. Quarter-master —53 years.M inutes. The War Office, December, 1948. (c) Officers of the rank of W/S major or who have been T/lieut.-colonels provided they are below the age of 48 years. Applications from these officers will be dealt with on their individual merits. (d) Officers of the late Indian Army, provided they are below the following ages :— Majors and below ... 45 years. Lieut.-colonels ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 50 years. Brigadiers and Colonels 54 years. General officers ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 57 years. Notes : (1) Retired or releas;d officers formerly of Regiments of the Gurkha Brigade of the late Indian Army may apply to be appointed to the R.A.R.O. of tli; Brigade of Gurkhas, and it is hoped that as many as possible will do so. (2) Officers of the late Indian Continuous Cadre of R.A.V.C. may apply to join, irrespective of age. Rank on appointment 9. Officers whose applications to join the R.A.R.O. are accepted will be appointed in the substantive rank they already hold, or, if they hold a war substantive rank of major or lower, they will be given that rank as substantive in the R.A.R.O. Substantive rank based on war substantive rank above major will not be granted. The reason for this is that, under Army Order 144 of 1947, officers who have continued to serve have been gradually losing war substantive rank above major, and it is desirable that officers who join the reserves should be in line with those who have continued to serve. In the event of an emergency, officers may be employed in higher “ temporary ” rank under the regulations then in force. THE ARMY OFFICERS EMERGENCY RESERVE (A.O.E.R.) 10. The Army Officers Emergency Reserve is a register of gentlemen who volunteer to serve as officers in any future war. All applications for registration will be considered on their merits, but applicants cannot be considered over the age °f 55 years. Officers who join the A.O.E.R. will continue to be liable to recall under the emergency regulations until they lapse. Apart from that they will have no legal liability to recall, other than whatever may be imposed by national service legislation on citizens generally in a future war. Registration on the A.O.E.R. affords, however, a 'means by which officers can be selected according to their qualifications for employment in any future war. Training GENERAL n. (a) A scheme whereby officers of the R.A.R.O. may train on a voluntary basis is under consideration. If this can be arranged, a separate announcement will be made later (b) There will be no training for the A.O.E.R. in peace-time. The Registered Reservist Scheme *2. The Registered Reservist Scheme provides a means whereby the released officer can affiliate himself to a local T.A. unit of Anti-Aircraft Command for immediate service with that unit in the event of emergency. There is no objection to an officer registered under the Registered Reservist Scheme joining the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R., in which case he must clearly understand that he undertakes the full liability of the reserve in question, though every effort will be made to allow mm to serve m an emergency initially with the unit for which he has registered. He must, however, state in his application that he is so registered. A released officer who has applied to join the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R. should not register under the Registered Reservist Scheme until he has been officially informed that his application has not been accepted. Uniform Lb Officers appointed to the R.A.R.O. in response to this invitation, when called out for service, will be issued with battle-dress and/or required to provide it and other uniform in respect of which an allowance will be issuable. Change of Address These age limits are now under 14. Officers of the Army Reserves are required to inform the War Office of any permanent change of address. In the event of temporary absence abroad for a period of over six months officers of the R.A.R.O. are also required to obtain formal leave of absence from the War Office. This leave of absence is seldom withheld. Removal on account of age from the Army Reserves 15. Officers will be removed from the reserve on attaining the age limits for their rank consideration and will be published by Royal Warrant. 16.

Notes : (1) Retired or releas:d officers formerly of Regiments of the Gurkha Brigade of the late Indian Army may apply to be appointed to the R.A.R.O. of thi Brigade of Gurkhas, and it is hoped that as many as possible will do so. (2) Officers of the late Indian Continuous Cadre of R.A.V.C. may apply to join, irrespective of age. Rank on appointment 9. Officers whose applications to join the R.A.R.O. are accepted will be appointed in the substantive rank they already hold, or, if they hold a war substantive rank of major or lower, they will be given that rank as substantive in the R.A.R.O. Substantive rank based on war substantive rank above major will not be granted. The reason for this is that, under Army Order 144 of 1947, officers who have continued to serve have been gradually losing war substantive rank above major, and it is desirable that officers who join the reserves should be in line with those who have continued to serve. In the event of an emergency, officers may be employed in higher “ temporary ” rank under the regulations then in force. THE ARMY OFFICERS EMERGENCY RESERVE (A.O.E.R.) 10. The Army Officers Emergency Reserve is a register of gentlemen who volunteer to serve as officers in any future war. All applications for registration will be considered on their merits, but applicants cannot be considered over the age °f 55 years. Officers who join the A.O.E.R. will continue to be liable to recall under the emergency regulations until they lapse. Apart from that they will have no legal liability to recall, other than whatever may be imposed by national service' legislation on citizens generally in a future war. Registration on the A.O.E.R. affords, however, a means by which officers can be selected according to their qualifications for employment in any future war. Training GENERAL 11. (a) A scheme whereby officers of the R.A.R.O. may train on a voluntary basis is under consideration. If this can be arranged, a separate announcement will be made later (b) There will be no training for the A.O.E.R. in peace-time. The Registered Reservist Scheme 12. The Registered Reservist Scheme provides a means whereby the released officer can affiliate himself to a local X. A. unit of Anti-Aircraft Command for immediate service with, that unit in the event of emergency. Xhere is no objection to an officer registered under the Registered Reservist Scheme joining the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R., in which case he must clearly understand that he undertakes the full liability of the reserve in question, though everv effort will be made to allow him to serve in an emergency initially with the unit for which he has registered. He must, however, state in his application that he is so registered. A released officer who has applied to join the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R. should not register under the Registered Reservist Scheme until he has been officially informed that his application has not been accepted. Uniform Officers appointed to the R.A.R.O. in response to this invitation, when called out for service, will be issued with battle-dress and/or required to provide it and other uniform in respect of which an allowance will be issuable. Change of Address 14. Officers of the Army Reserves are required to inform the War Office of any permanent change of address. In the event of temporary absence abroad for a period of over six months officers of the R.A.R.O. are also required to obtain formal leave of absence from the War Office. This leave of absence is seldom withheld. Removal on account of age from the Army Reserves 1? Officers will be removed from the reserve on attaining the age limits for their rank. These age limits are now under consideration and will be published by Royal Warrant. AAm? Y °y A m 5 ?° FF S 5 YOURSELF FOR SERVICE IN A FUTURE EMERGENCY, AND ARE UNABLE TO JOIN THE S.R.

Officers of Gurkha Regiments of the late Indian Army may apply to join the reserve of the Brigade of Gurkhas.THE RESERVES OF OFFICERS AND HOW TO JOIN THEM 1 It is hoped that as many officers as possible who have retired or have been released from either the British or Indian Armies and who fulfil the necessary conditions will volunteer to join the reconstituted Territorial Army. Full details can be obtained from the local T.A. and Auxiliary Forces Association or the nearest T.A. unit. ANY OFFICER WHO CAN SPARE THE TIME SHOULD JOIN THE TERRITORIAL ARMY. , 2 There are however, many officers who will be unable to afford the time to carry out the duties of an officer in the T A but who would be required to serve again, either in time of crisis whilst the present state of emergency continues, or in any future emergency. All released officers are liable to recall until the present emergency is declared at an end. In the event of recall being necessary, or in any future emergency, it is important, both to the country and to the individual that officers should be fitted quickly into appropriate appointments. For this reason it is proposed to compile new lists of officers in reserve, so that they can be fitted smoothly and quickly into suitable appointments should the need to recall them arise. 3. Separate arrangements have been made for the following classes (a) Released officers of the Supplementary Reserve and the Territorial Army— Officers of these classes who have not joined the reconstituted Supplementary Reserve or Territorial Army will, as explained m para. 5, be retained on the appropriate Reserve Lists without application until they reach the age limits applicable or the emergency ends and they apply to resign their commissions. t _ lb) Released women officers. —A separate announcement regarding the appointment of these officers (women doctors and dentists, nursing officers and A.T.S. officers) to an appropriate Reserve will be made in due course. 4. The Supplementary Reserve of Officers is also being reformed on a limited scale to provide units of types which are not suitable for organization on a T.A. basis ; examples at present are R.E. (Transportation) and R.E. (Postal) , other categories may be added. Officers for these units are being found by direct approach through the appropriate civilian organizations. Supplementary reserve officers who have not joined units of the post-war Supplementary Reserve (S.R.) will be automatically retained on the appropriate reserve list. &lt;5 The Territorial Army Reserve of Officers (T.A.R.O.) is the special reserve for the lerritorial Army, and entry to it will therefore, in future be restricted to officers who have held T.A. commissions. They will thus be on the most suitable reserve to ensure that they are kept on the appropriate Regimental list and are most readily available for posting to units if required when the T.A. is embodied. Existing I.A. officers who have been released from embodied service, and who have not joined units in the reconstituted T.A., and who have not reached the age for compulsory retirement, are being transferred automatically to the T.A.R.O. They will be held to serve on that Reserve until the present emergency ends and, if they then continue service voluntarily, will be liable to be called up in a future emergency whenever the T.A. is embodied or before embodiment when necessary for the defence of the United Kingdom. 6 THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE OF OFFICERS AND THE ARMY OFFICERS EMERGENCE RESERVE ARE HOWEVER, NOW OPEN TO RECRUITMENT, AND THE FOLLOWING CLASSES OF OFFICERS AND EX-OFFICERS ARE NOW INVITED TO JOIN :— (a) Ex-officers of the Regular Army who resigned with less than 10 years service and have not yet applied to join the R.A.R.O. {b) Released emergency commissioned officers. ( c \ Ex-officers who have relinquished short service commissions since the end of hostilities. {d) Retired and released officers formerly of the Indian Army, whether they held regular or emergency commissions. N.B. Retired officers of the late Indian Army whose substantive rank is Lieut.-colonel or higher are unlikely to be able to join the T.A. owing to lack of vacancies. It is hoped therefore, that as many as possible will join the Regular Army Reserve of Officers The essential differences between the Regular Army Reserve of Officers and the Army Officers Emergency Reserve are described in the following paragraphs. p urpose THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE OF OFFICERS (R.A.R.O.) 7. The Regular Army Reserve of Officers is designed to bring the Active Army up to strength, to raise units from lower to higher establishments, and to provide a reserve of officers for reinforcement purposes. Members are liable to be called to Army Service at a time of national emergency, or when a national emergency appears imminent. Eligibility • , , T j- a • 8.

Officers of Gurkha Regiments of the late Indian Army may apply to join the reserve of the Brigade of Gurkhas.THE RESERVES OF OFFICERS AND HOW TO JOIN THEM 1. It is hoped that as many officers as possible who have retired or have been released from either the British or Indian Armies and who fulfil the necessary conditions will volunteer to join the reconstituted Territorial Army. Full details can be obtained from the local T.A. and Auxiliary Forces Association or the nearest T.A, unit. ANY OFFICER WHO CAN SPARE THE TIME SHOULD JOIN THE TERRITORIAL ARMY. , 2. There are, however, many officers who will be unable to afford the time to carry out the duties of an officer in the f A but who would be required to serve again, either in time of crisis whilst the present state of emergency continues, or m any future emergency. All released officers are liable to recall until the present emergency is declared at an end. In the event of recall being necessary, or in any future emergency, it is important, both to the country and to the individual that officers should be fitted quickly into appropriate appointments. For this reason it is proposed to compile new lists of officers in reserve, so that they can be fitted smoothly and quickly into suitable appointments should the need to recall them arise. 3. Separate arrangements have been made for the following classes (a) Released officers of the Supplementary Reserve and the Territorial Army— Officers of these classes who have not joined the reconstituted Supplementary Reserve or Territorial Army will, as explained in para. 5, be retained on the appropriate Reserve Lists without application until they reach the age limits applicable or the emergency ends and they apply to resign their commissions. lb) Released women officers. —A separate announcement regarding the appointment of these officers (women doctors and dentists, nursing officers and A.T.S. officers) to an appropriate Reserve will be made in due course. 4. The Supplementary Reserve of Officers is also being reformed on a limited scale to provide units of types which are not suitable for organization on a T.A. basis ; examples at present are R.E. (Transportation) and R.E. (Postal) ; other categories may be added. Officers for these units are being found by direct approach through the appropriate civilian organizations. Supplementary reserve officers who have not joined units of the post-war Supplementary Reserve (S.R.) will be automatically retained on the appropriate reserve list. 5. The Territorial Army Reserve of Officers (T.A.R.O.) is the special reserve for the Territorial Army, and entry to it will, therefore, in future be restricted to officers who have held T.A. commissions. They will thus be on the most suitable reserve to ensure that they are kept on the appropriate Regimental list and are most icadily available for posting to units if required when the T.A. is embodied. Existing I.A. officers who have been released from embodied service, and who have not joined units in the reconstituted T.A., and who have not reached the age for compulsory retirement, are being transferred automatically to the T.A.R.O. Ihey will be held to serve on that Reserve until the present emergency ends and, if they then continue service voluntarily, will be liable to be called up in a future emergency whenever the T.A. is embodied or before embodiment when necessary for the defence of the United Kingdom. 6 THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE OF OFFICERS AND THE ARMY OFFICERS EMERGENCY RESERVE ARE, FIOWEVER, NOW OPEN TO RECRUITMENT, AND THE FOLLOWING CLASSES OF OFFICERS AND EX-OFFICERS ARE NOW INVITED TO JOIN (a) Ex-officers of the Regular Army who resigned with less than 10 years’ service and have not yet applied to join the R.A.R.O. (b) Released emergency commissioned officers. (c) Ex-officers who have relinquished short service commissions since the end of hostilities. (&lt;f) Retired and released officers formerly of the Indian Army, whether they held regular or emergency commissions. N b. Retired officers of the late Indian Army whose substantive rank is Lieut.-colonel or higher are unlikely to be able to join the T.A. owing to lack of vacancies. It is hoped therefore, that as many as possible will join the Regular Army The essential differences between the Regular Army Reserve of Officers and the Army Officers Emergency Reserve are described in the following paragraphs. Pur p ose THE REGULAR ARMY RESERVE OF OFFICERS (R.A.R.O.) 7 The Regular Army Reserve of Officers is designed to bring the Active Army up to strength, to raise units from lower to higher establishments, and to provide a reserve of officers for reinforcement purposes. Members are liable to be called to Army Service at a time of national emergency, or when a national emergency appears imminent. Eligibility . 8. Officers of the categories mentioned in para. 6 who have been released from the British or Indian Armies are invited to join the R.A.R.O. as under :— . , , , , ,, (а) Officers with the requisite qualifications who have held ranks of any sort of major and below, up to the age oi 45 years bs. years for quarter-mast^- s c R.E.M.E. R.A.E.C. R. Signals. R.A.M.C. R.A.P.C. R.A.D.C. R.A.Ch.D. R.A.O.C. R.A.V.C. R. Pnr. Corps. Int. Corps—Officers of all Arms with qualifications for employment on intelligence duties. R.M.P.—Officers of all Arms qualified in provost work. Staff—Officers of all Arms who have had staff training or experience. (б) Officers suitable for employment at regimental duty in all other Arms, provided they have not passed the following ages and held the undermentioned ranks while serving :— W/S Capt.J T/Major / -35 years. W/S Lieut T/Capt. }- 30 years. Quarter-master —53 years.Tech Cour Staff Brie! be st to jo M inutes. r* (c) Officers of the rank of W/S major or who have been T/lieut&gt;-colonels provided they are below the age of 48 years. Applications from these officers will be dealt with on their individual merits. (d) Officers of the late Indian Army, provided they are below the following ages :— Majors and below ... ... ... ... ... ... 45 years. Lieut.-colonels Brigadiers and Colonels General officers ... Notes 50 years. 54 years. 57 years. (1) Retired or releas;d officers formerly of Regiments of the Gurkha Brigade of the late Indian Army may apply to be appointed to the R.A.R.O. of th? Brigade of Gurkhas, and it is hoped that as many as possible will do so. (2) Officers of the late Indian Continuous Cadre of R.A.V.C. may apply to join, irrespective of age. Rank on appointment 9. Officers whose applications to join the R.A.R.O. are accepted will be appointed in the substantive rank they already hold, or, if they hold a war substantive rank of major or lower, they will be given that rank as substantive in the R.A.R.O. Substantive rank based on war substantive rank above major will not be granted. The reason for this is that, under Army Order 144 of 1947, officers who have continued to serve have been gradually losing war substantive rank above major, and it is desirable that officers who join the reserves should be in line with those who have continued to serve. In the event of an emergency, officers may be employed in higher “ temporary ” rank under the regulations then in force. THE ARMY OFFICERS EMERGENCY RESERVE (A.O.E.R.) 10. The Army Officers Emergency Reserve is a register of gentlemen who volunteer to serve as officers in any future war. All applications for registration will be considered on their merits, but applicants cannot be considered over the age of 55 years. Officers who join the A.O.E.R. will continue to be liable to recall under the emergency regulations until thev lapse. Apart from that they will have no legal liability to recall, other than whatever may be imposed by national service legislation on citizens generally in a future war. Registration on the A.O.E.R. affords, however, a means by which officers can be selected according to their qualifications for employment in any future war. Training GENERAL 11. [a) A scheme whereby officers of the R.A.R.O. may train on a voluntary basis is under consideration ^ If this can be arranged, a separate announcement will be made later. (6) There will be no training for the A.O.E.R. in peace-time. The Registered Reservist Scheme 12. The Registered Reservist Scheme provides a means whereby the released officer can affiliate himself to a local d.A. unit of Anti-Aircraft Command for immediate service with that unit in the event of emergency. There is no objection to an officer registered under the Registered Reservist Scheme joining the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R., in which case he must clearly understand that he undertakes the full liability of the reserve in question, though every effort will be made to allow him to serve in an emergency initially with the unit for which he has registered. He must, however, state in his application that he is so registered. A released officer who has applied to join the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R. should not register under the Registered Reservist Scheme until he has been officially informed that his application has not been accepted. U niform 13. Officers appointed to the R.A.R.O. in response to this invitation, when called out for service, will be issued with battle-dress and/or required to provide it and other uniform in respect of which an allowance will be issuable. Change of Address 14. Officers of the Army Reserves are required to inform the War Office of any permanent change of address. In the event of temporary absence abroad for a period of over six months officers of the R.A.R.O. are also required to obtain formal leave of absence from the War Office. This leave of absence is seldom withheld. Removal on account of age from the Army Reserves 15. Officers will be removed from the reserve on attaining the age limits for their rank. These age limits are now under consideration and will be published by Royal Warrant. 16. IF YOU ARE WILLING TO OFFER YOURSELF FOR SERVICE IN A FUTURE EMERGENCY AND ARE UNABLE TO JOIN THE S.R. OR THE T.A., YOU SHOULD APPLY TO TOIN THE R A R O IF, FOR AGE OR OTHER REASONS YOU ARE UNABLE TO JOIN THE R.A.R.O. BUT ARE NONE THE LESS WILLING TO BE REGISTERED AS A VOLUNTEER FOR SERVICE AFTER THE PRESENT EMERGENCY ENDS YOU SHOULD APPLY TO JOIN THE A.O.E.R How to join I 7 ; y™ are w .il lin g to join the R.A.R.O. or A.O.E.R. please complete the appropriate sections of the attached form, tear it off and post it. Receipt of your application will not be acknowledged but you will be notified as soon as possible whether it has been accepted. Do not make any further enquiries until four weeks have elapsed. N.B.—As indicated in para. 6, the invitation in this leaflet is at present only extended to officers who have already held commissions other than S.R. or T.A. commissions, on full pay. Applications cannot at present be considered from gentlemen who have never held commissions nor can they be accepted from officers beyond the ages set out in paras 8 or 10 as appropriate. t 1 ■ APPLICATIOP &lt; PART I (To bee Highest rank held : Substantive W/Substantive Temporary Nationality at birtt Yourself Nationality now (if Yourself Technical and aca obtained since rel PART II I request that (a) in my present I Note.— If an reasons in a coverim I understand tl national emergency Address..
