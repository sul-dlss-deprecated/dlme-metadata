Around the middle of the dynasty, the Egyptians sought to combat an increase in infant mortality with a new amuletic form. Beginning with Amunhotep II (circa 1426&ndash;1400 <small>B.C.E.</small>), the birth-god&rsquo;s body assumed the characteristics of a dwarf with short, thick limbs, sunken chest, and fleshy buttocks. Because dwarfs rarely survived infancy in antiquity, one who did was considered magical. By combining the attributes of these &ldquo;charmed&rdquo; dwarfs with the ancient lion-man, craftsmen produced a new, more powerful protector of women and children.", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2016-03-01", "date_added": "2016-04-12 17:05:29", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 648, "title": "Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity"}, {"id": 3329, "title": "Ancient Egyptian Art"}], "related_items": [{"accession_number": "37.912E", "object_id": 4111}], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 6863634, "name": "Egypt", "type": "Place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "CUR.16.580.13_NegL897_7A_print_bw.jpg", "id": 136317, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/CUR.16.580.13_NegL897_7A_print_bw.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/CUR.16.580.13_NegL897_7A_print_bw.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 96, "height": 65}, {"size": "1", "width": 192, "height": 131}, {"size": "2", "width": 384, "height": 263}, {"size": "3", "width": 768, "height": 526}, {"size": "4", "width": 1536, "height": 1052}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/CUR.16.580.13_NegL897_7A_print_bw.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em>Male Birth God</em>, ca. 1426-1292 B.C.E.
