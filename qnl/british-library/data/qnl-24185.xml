After the end of the war we have been getting offers of exports of several items from them which have been released for export by Hie Ministry of Food but whenever we have placed orders they have refused permits to our principles by replying as follows 'Without the establishment of a programme we cannot help you and Bahrain has made no request through the British Middle East Supply Misson no programme can be arranged. n Many items of British provisons are now being allowed for export to many parts of the world and particularly to t-e Middle East and the British Government is very anxious to widely develop their export trade as is apparent from various circular letters we have been receiving from our principals and Government Export Development Departments. 'We ourselves are also very anxious to build up good trade with United Kingdom and resume the pleasant relations that we had with various firms and moreover most of the goods which the manufacturers or their suppliers are offering us are very badly needed in Bahrain , Vfe shall be very grateful if your honour will take up the matter with the Ministry of Food and let Bahrain be included in Ministry of Food«s approved list.

E.1138/47 Reference your Express Letter No. 288-80/34 dated 4th February, 1947 (and enclosures), regarding the export of sugar confectionery and chocolate from the n.K. to ^threin. 2. The raw materials for sugar confectionery and chocolate, i.e. sugar and cocoa, are still subject to international allocation and in the U.K. they are in short supply and strictly rationed. The sugar and cocoa quotas for the II.K. are intaided to cover internal needs only, bu^ it is the practice of the Ministry of Food to allow small quantities of sugar confectionery and chocolate to be exported to certain dependencies where a particular case of need is established. Since the amounts exported represent a direct reduction in the limited quantity available for home consumption, it follow- that the Ministry of Food would only agree to exports to a new destination where strong arguments are put forward on its behalf. 3. For this purpose your letter and the enclosures under reference are not sufficient. If you wish me to pursue the matter from this end I suggest that you put up a reasoned case for the import of a specified quantity of sugar confectionery and chocolate into Bahrein and include the following information:- (a)/r * (a) The average quantity imported before the war, with sources, (b) Quantity, if any, imported during and since the war, with souroea.
