Each report is compiled by the Director of Customs and Port Officer and comes in the form of a table with the following information:name of ship;nationality of ship;name of owners;date of arrival;date of departure;number of packages landed at Bahrain (in tonnes);number of packages transhipped to the mainland (in tonnes);quantity (in tonnes) and nature of cargo shipped from Bahrain (including goods from mainland transhipped at Bahrain);destination.Included within the file is correspondence between the Bahrain Political Agency and the Director of Customs and Port Officer. This is mostly concerned with the exclusion of figures on petroleum products in the reports, which was viewed as a security risk during the Second World War. From May 1947 these figures were reintroduced. From July 1947 they were included as separate statements to those on general cargo.Folios 144-53 are internal office notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Shipping</topic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000153#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000153#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
