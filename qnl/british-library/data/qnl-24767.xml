From —The Director, Persian Gulf Section, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to your telegram No. 1058-E.A, of the 26th instant, I have the honour to send you copy of Mr. New’s report No. 9 of the 16th March 1909, together with copy of a note by me. Mr. New’s report is up to the 31st December 1908 only, but a supplementary report up to the 31st May last has been called for and a copy of it will be forwarded as soon as possible. Copy of Mr. New's report No. .9, dated the 16th March 1909, to the Blreetor, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, Karachi. I have the honour to submit a report on the importation of arms and am munition on theMekran Coast covering a period of seven months, betwen the 1st June 1908 (the date of submission of my last report No 22-P. of the 1st June 1908) to the 31st December 1908 2. The full number of patrols (viz. 12) were maintained till the end of June. Although Afghans ceased their operations on the coast in May, the patrols were engaged in tracking their route up-country, and during the month of June there were indications of activity in the traffic by Baluchis, which caused me to keep up the full strength of patrols till the end of the month. From the 1st July the services of six patrols were dispensed with and the remainder (one Jemadar and six patrols) were retained throughout the summer. The services of all telephones established were also retained, throughout. On the 25th December two patrols were engaged and posted to the west ward of 4 ask to watch the movements of Afghans who commenced to arrive on the coast about this time. 3. It will be seen by Appendix A that nearly all rifles imported during the period of my report were consigned to Baluchis. The total is practically the same as for the corresponding month* for last season, showing only an increase of 78 rifles, and as usual imports slackened during July, August and September. 4. Only in a very few instances information of the amount of ammunition imported could be obtained, but it was sufficient to verify the opinion that ammunition is also imported with all consignments of rifles. As it is generally known that the selling price of a rifle in Maskat also included 100 rounds of ammunition, it is safe to assume that the total shown in the statement represents but a minimum of the quantity actually imported by Baluchis. 5. Landings by Baluchis were confined principally to the coast between Sadech and Tank. Their consignments are numerous and consist mostly of small lots. Although much information of indicated landings was obtained through the land patrols and telephone stations, it was of course quite impos sible to even guess with any accuracy the actual time and date of a particular landing, and it was also most difficult to discriminate as to whether the information received at the time was reasonably reliable and worth acting upon. I did my utmost to carefully follow reports, and always worked in co-operation with Commanders of His Majesty’s ships, but in the circumstances it was obviously futile for ships to steam many miles down the coast from Jask on the chance of making an insignificant capture, and consequently Baluchis were able to carry out their operations with very little risk or hindrance., consignment of rifles was 6 During the period under review the end of December there Mir Barkat of Bierban hasagam ing 0 boa t s for the conveyance of engaged in the traffic to an(1 w jth transport. _ their consignments, and in 1 S fT „ qV has implicated himself with Mir l fear too that MirMustapha Khan of Jask hM P unable to verif tbl statement and will reserve my u be able to investigate the matter ^ ^ verifled tlia t four out of five 7 With reference to Append ’ , • , by gun runners, losses contained in the statement were sustained by g ^ 5 , of the 9th 1.

The example of burning of native boats which are captured is haying a very good effect among Nakhodas and owners. They now demand the liberty of discharging their illicit cargoes if they are approached by Naval ships, with the idea of course of saving the boat from being destroyed. If the example could be extended, and special efforts made to capture suspected boats engaged in the traffic, and to destroy the^if sufficient evidence can he obtained, I think it would have some deterring effect on small importers, and even importers of larger consignments who are not able to guarantee the insurance of boats against risks of capture.APPENDIX 0.

The importation of arms by Baluchis has continued on much the same scale as last year. During the 7 months covered by this repoit about 4,55o rifles with probably 100 Sounds of ammunition per rifle were imported by them showing an increase of about 78 rifles only as compared with the corresponding months of last years. Every endeavour was made to intercept landings arrang ed for hy Baluchis, but as their consignments were numerous and made as a rule in small lots only it was practically impossible to definitely locate them, and as it would have been obviously futile for His Majesty s ships to steam many miles up and down the coast on the chance of making an insignificant capture the Baluchis were able to carry out their operations with very little risk or hind rance. Such losses as they did incur before landings were effected were more or less fortuitous. Bor instance 75 rifles and about 7,500 rounds of ammuni tion consigned to Mir Barkat bin Abdul Nabi of Biaban and to people of Jask were thrown overboard of Kuh Mubarak on the 15th June 1908 on the approach of His Majesty’s “ Readbreast ”, and 100 more rifles with 10,000 rounds of ammunition consigned to Mir Islam Khan of Bint were similarly disposed of off Khunarak on the 1st December 1^08 on the approach of the “Persepolis’. In addition to the above the only other verified loss incurred was the capture and confiscation hy the Persians of a boat on the 7th December 1908 off Bris Bunder after the landing of 600 rifles. Mr. New reports that the example of confiscating or burning boats, which are captured, is having a very good effect on N akhodas and owners of boats who now demand liberty to discharge ^ illicit cargo, if approached by Naval vessels. If the example can be extended it may have the effect of stopping the import of small consignments altogether and large importers will also be hampered by being called upon to pay higher rates hy way of insurance against capture. In the latter part of November 1908 Captain Heath with 50 men of the 110th Mahratta Light Infantry arrived at J ask to strengthen the military detachment there. There has however been no cause for anxiety for the security of the Telegraph station. It was thought that Mr. New while travelling along the Telegraph line between Jask and Gwadur on his annual tour of inspection might possibly be interefered with and his escort was accordingly increased by a detachment of 30 Mekran levies. Nothing however occurred during his tour. (Sd). H.

SPECIAL REPORTS ON THE MASQAT ARMS TRAFFIC, SEASON 1908-09. SIMLA: DIVISION OF THE CHIEF OF THE STAFF, ARMY HEAD QUARTERS, INDIA.TN compiling last year such official information as was available regarding the Masqat Arms Traffic it was impossible not to be struck by the numerous lacmce in our knowledge of that trade. An attempt has accordingly been made, by means of special agents of the Intelligence Branch, to throw some light on the many obscure points regarding which further information was most desirable. The reports which follow give the results of our investigations down to the present time. It is not claimed that they in any way exhaust the subject. On the contrary, our enquiries are still proceeding, and we are endeavouring to trace a few typical consignments of arms right through from the merchants of Masqat to their ultimate destination—the hands of the frontier Pathan. But there will probably be found in the reports now printed much information of value. Attention may be invited to the original letters and quotations on pages 35 to 39, which show at what marvellously cheap prices perfectly efficient rifles can be shipped at European ports. The enormous profits which are made at every stage ; the manner in which practically all Masqat, from the Sultan down to the meanest of his subjects, has a direct interest in the trade ; the swindling of the Sultan by his own officials ; the falsification of returns whereby we must be left more than ever in doubt regarding the real percentage of the traffic which finds its way to the neighbourhood of our frontier; the methods adopted by the Afghan and Pathan dealers in purchasing and shipping their arms ; and the facility with which, apparently, arms can be smuggled into India itself—all these points will be found in the reports which follow. In connection with these enquiries I paid a brief visit to Masqat in March last, and was enabled to visit the sample rooms of several of the rifle merchants and, accompanied by the owner, the outside of M. Goguyer’s large warehouse, which certainly looked as if it contained the 100,000 arms which some of our informants speak of. A further selection of these reports will be printed in due course. Meanwhile, as our agents run very serious risks in carrying out their investigations, it is particularly requested that this pamphlet be kept under lock and key, that it never \ goes out of an officer’s hands, and that it be not quoted or alluded to in any way except in secret papers. W- MALLESON, Colonel, Assistant QuafteT Master General for Intelligence,[SECRET.! Method of raising money for buying arms. REPORT OF SECRET AGENTS “A ” AND “B.” * The people (Afghans) who trade in arms may be divided into three categories:—» (1) Big merchants who have been en gaged in the arms trade for years, such as Nurakai. (2) Merchants who are regular traders in India or Afghanistan in cloth, carpets, etc., and who have recently taken to arms trading. (3) The poor adventurers attracted by the quick and big profits to be made in the arms trade. Class I have usually sufficient cash of their own, but if they require more the Amir will lend it to them. Some reports say that the Amir takes no interest on these loans, but other reports mention ‘ Chihlak' or one -fortieth, i.e., 2J per cent. The money is said to be repaid in five yearly instalments. (Probably, directly or indirectly, the Amir makes something out of the bans.) Class II have either enough cash of their own or, from their regular trade deal ings, have credit with the banias and dalals at places like Peshawar, Dera Ismail Khan and Calcutta. They are accustom ed to take advances from these men, and the banias, although they probably know well enough {vide reluctance of Dera Ismail Khan brokers this year) need not neces sarily be told that the money is required for arms trading. The interest charged is 10 per cent, for a 4 months' loan if security is good and 13 per cent, to 16 per cent, for 4 months on less security. Mathra Das of Peshawar is one of these brokers. Class III cannot approach the Amir and have no introduction to the Hindu brokers. They usually combine m small parties, each, perhaps, contributing Rs. 500. If they have not this amount of their own * The .e mea visited Masqat, etc., and January 1S03. in December 1008 14 I. B.2 they will borrow at interest from their friends and relations. This is also the procedure of the Adam Khel Afridis. Like the Ghilzais, they will also take interest on loans.* Some of the Adam Khel who went this year had practically no money of their own. They agreed to pay the lenders from one-third to half of their profits. In addition to the above-mentioned capitalists a few poor individuals follow m the train of the bigger merchants. The merchants engage them as camel-drivers and pay them Rs. 2 per camel they are m charge of. One man can manage from six to eight camels. The merchant allows him to take his wages in rifles at Masqat rates, so on arrival at Kabul he may find himself the possessor of three Martini rifles. Our men could hear nothing of the Amir or Nasrulla personally, or -of the State, having commissioned the traders to buy rifles for them; neither did they hear of the Amir having purchased rifles from the traders last year. There was a report at Jashk that the Amir had given Nurakai permission to im port 100,000 rifles this season. 1. The principal tribes that are engaged in the arms trade are — Sulaiman Khel, Kharoti, Nasir, Taraki, Andar, also Mahi . Ghilzais, Nasero and Murad Ghilzais are men- and also Mahi Khel, Khel Sub-sections of tioned. Wardaks. Adam Khel Afridis. 2. From all the reports our men heard and from their conversations with Afghan arms traders it appears that an insignificant pro portion of the traders reach the Gulf ports overland. Nearly all come by sea from Bombay and Karachi. They appear all to go by steamer, and no case was heard of in which the traders had gone up the Gulf *In former reports I have mentioned that Malik Feroz, Aman Khel, of Kohat Pass, finances many of the ‘ Pass ’ Adam Khel. Amir and arms trade- Tribes engaged in trade. Method of procedure-by sailing boat from Karachi. They do. not even arrange for their men with caravans to meet them on the Persian coast. There is, however, a considerable trade in fruit and cloth between Afghanistan and Bandar Abbas, and Afghan traders, after selling their goods at Bandar Abbas, sometimes go on to Masqat and purchase arms. The arms traders who come by sea usually send the greater number of their party to Bandar Abbas to purchase camels there, as they prefer the Afghan camel to the weak animals of Makran. The majority of the arms traders were well-known Ghilzai merhants whose nor mal trade is with Calcutta, Bombay and Central India in the winter. These men come from Kabul, Ghazni, etc., by the ordinary Peshawar or Dera Ismail Khan routes. Being merchants on a big scale, with business connections of many years’ stand ing, they have either the money or the credit to finance their operations, and for the last two years these men have been engaging in the arms trade, finding it more profitable than this ordinary business. They generally embark in small parties of from 4 to 10 men at Bombay or Karachi, and in most cases they book to Bandar Abbas or Basrah —do Afghans being allow ed to book direct for Masqat. They make their purchases and other arrangements independently and only collect to form a big caravan when they have completed their purchases. When buying their steamer tickets they frequently describe themselves as pilgrims going to Baghdad or Kerbala and book to Basrah to avoid suspicion, but, if oppor tunity offers, they will leave the ship at some nearer port. By bribing minor officials they can sometimes disembark at Masqat. If they have had to go straight through to Basrah they return by steamer to Bandar Abbas or Jashk—but mostly to Bandar Ab bas whence they proceed by land to Jashk, A certain number also book direct to Jashk.4 and Chalibar b}' British India boats.^ How ever, they do not like to do this in large numbers as it would create suspicion. The party now divides up, the majority remaining at or going to Bandar Abbas while a few, among whom are the leaders, go to Jashk, Chahbar or some port in the vicinity. The men at Bandar Abbas either remain quietly there until the pur chasers have completed their business, or else—as is usually the case—they wait for the arrival of caravans from Afghanistan and secure the necessary camel trans port. When they have collected the camels^ and they think that the rifles ma\ be shortly expected, they movfe down tl\e coast and lie up in places where there is good grazing near the expected landing places. The leaders who have gone to Jasak, Chahbar or other ports close by, enlist the services of the local Baluch Sardars. They agree to pay the Baluch Sardars a fixed rate for each rifle landed, and in return for this the Sordars arrange for a sailing boat for the crossing to Masqat, provide them with one of their own men as a guide, and advise them as to where to land their arms. Frequently one or two of the party remain on the Persian side—say at Jashk—to complete arrange ments there and to keep in touch with the rest of the party at Bandar Abbas. The headmen and the guide then em bark for Masqat, but they usually make for Batinah or Barkah, or some other small port above Masqat, and then bear down the coast to Masqat. If starting from Chah bar they may make first for Quryat, Jalan and Sur, small ports east of Masqat. This especially applies to Baluchi traders. (The Baluchis sometime cross from Jashk or Chahbar by steamer, the Afghans seem to go by dhow always.) In Masqat the Afghans have to try to keep clear of any spies the British Consul may have in his pay, and they usually wear Baluch clothes, but the risk is very sight as everyone, even those in consulate employ, is more or less openly favourable our man gives the following figures 60% book to Bandar Abbas. 2fto/ Gwadar, Chahbar and Jashk 20% ”, Lingeh, Bushire and Basralv8 (d) Although there are two British min-boats cruising in the Gul Oman the people say that they cannot take any hostile action on Persian soil and that once landed the gun-runners are safe. Also the gun-boats are watching the coast west of Jashk and most cfthe Afghans The places that have been definitely^ de cided upon as landing places are Gnsikm and Chf.ikalau which are between Gabng and Sadaich. The Afghans who are working through Mir Mustafa Khan, Baluch Sardar, of Jashk, are landing their arms at Grishkin and those who are employing his brother, Nur Muhammad Khan, will land at Chaika- lau. Others, who are getting assistance from the third brother, Mir Barkat Khan, will land at Bunji, Brijak, Biriz, Gunari, Sirik or Bnndram, west of Jashk, all in Biaban. One consignment of 400 rifles has already been landed at Bunji and they have been taken away to Shirahan, about one march away, where they are waiting for camels and the caravan to start. The Afghans who are employing Islam Khan of Bint, and Mahmud Khan of Dashtiari, both Baluch S .rdars, will land west of Ohahbar, most probably at Puzim, but there are other possible places also west of Chahbar, namely, Kunarak, Gurdim, Tank, Darak, Galag and Sadaich. To the east of Chahbar arrangements are made by Sardars Mahmud Khan, Mir Ahmad Khan and the latter’s brother, Jan Muhammad. Arms are intended to be landed this season at Pasa Bandar. Baluch gun-run ners intend to land here. * This was in December 1908 Other possible landing places on this side of Chahbar are Kinj Dap, Gwatar and Pishukan. Last season some of the Afghansf landed t (Only 2 or 3 men.) their consignments near Bandar Abbas and between that place and Lingeh. The ports where landings can be effected are Pul, Khamir, Listaghan and Kung. The inhabitants of Laristan land arms at Nakhilu, Charak, Gazir, Mahrikan • UcalTrade ' these places are west of Lingeh.7 \ Detail of procedure of one party. ! trade is said to be mostly in the hands of the people of Gaoband, Rigabad, Tangsir. To see in detail how things are managed it might be of interest to trace the move ments of one party whom our men got to know well. i The headman was one Muhammad Ali, Mush Khel, Suluman Khel, of Urgun, son of Shinkai; address in Kabul, care of Ibra him, Mush Khel, Sarai Dada Sher; has dealings with Seth Mathra Das of Peshawar. He is a well-known cloth and carpet mer chant trading between Kabul and Calcutta. Has traded in arms before, but would give no particulars. This winter (1908 09) he camera Kur- ram and went to Calcutta. There he collected money from dalals, i.e. brokers— with whom he had dealings, and left by train fur Bombay with two of his relations and a party of five other men under Darya Khan. Muhammad Ali and his two relations had Rs. 7,700 and Darya Khan and his party Rs. 5,000 with them. They all went by steamer to Jashk where our men ran across them. Our men were passing them selves off as arms traders and had approach ed Mir Mustafa Khan for assistance. Muhammad Ali also went to the same man, (i.e., Mustafa Khan). Our men, Muhammad Ali and Mir Mustafa Khan, all met at a store keeper's house at Jashk and they came to an agreement with Mustafa Khan. They were to pay him Re. 1 for each rifle safely landed and in return for this Mir Mustafa Khan arranged for them to land their rifles at Grishkin where one of his men would be ready to meet them. (The man was to be either Isa, an assistant or servant of the British doctor at Jashk or an Afghan, named Sarfaraz.) Meanwhile it was arranged that the rest of Muhammad Ali's party should go to Bandar Abbas to procure camels and they would bring them down to Yakdar— near Gabrig—where they would wait until the arms arrived. Mustafa Khan then told off his father-in- law, Dur Muhammad Khan, to go with them to Masqat as a guide. Dur Muhammad8 Khan had some married sisters living on the Masqat side and he promised to put t e party up in one of his brothers-in-law s houses. He said that he, Muhammad All and Darya Khan would wear Baluch clothes and he would take them to the merchants houses. Dur Muhammad Khan had been three times previously to Masqat in this capacity. Dur Muhammad Khan procured a sail ing boat from one Rahim Dad of Jashk, and they loaded this up with dates, fish, etc., to remove suspicion. They intended to sail for Batinah and thence make for Matrah. Mustafa Khan also gave them a letter to Islam Khan of Bint, a relation of his, through whose district they would have to pass when they finally started off for Afghanistan with the caravan. (Our men did not go to Masqat with them.) Of Muhammad Ali’s party of eight men, six went to Bandar Abbas for camels and only he and Darya Khan crossed to Masqat with the guide. &gt; If matters went well Muhammad Ali had promised to write to his Ghilzai friends at Calcutta and Bombay and they would also come to Masqat, make their purchases independently and join his caravan for the return journey. He would also have more money sent to him and would make further purchases on a much larger scale. The above is a fair example of the way the traders manage the gun-running. The gun-runners, who are landing their arms this year at Grishkin and Chaikalau, intend to make for Afghanistan by the following route:— Grishkin or Cha ilka lau. A. Parkau. * Tratakan. Gavabra.

Another route from Chahbar and ports in its vicinity isj—Dashtiari, Bahu- Kalat, Sarbaz, Magas, Sib, Shastun, Jalk, Mash Khel, and thence to Sistan. This route was taken last year by Lai Jan and Din Muhammad and 48 men with about 1,000 rifles and 200,000 cartridges. They landed their rifles at Puzim. 14 LB.Baghu (or Yagliu). Hasan Langi. Gurband.

A caravan of arms went by this route last year. They said it was a difficult road for Afghans. The people of Kirman were hostile to them. According to Afghan statements practi cally all the caravans when once they have crossed into Afghanistan make straight for Kandahar via the Helmand. A small amount of their arms is sold there and they then proceed to Ghazni, near which most of them live. They stay a short time near Ghazni and dispose of some rifles and then go on to Kabul. By far the greater number of arms are sold in Kabul. The merchants have their shops or godowns there where they can store their arms and sell at their leisure. The traders say that the caravan takes about 65 days to reach Kabul from the coast. This is actual day s marching with out halts. 1. A. Goguyer, French. 2.

The merchants believe that this season will not be such a good one as last. Their fears are due to the action they believe the British Government are taking to prevent Afghans from coming. There is also a report that the British Government means to buy out the trade at Masqat. The customs duty levied by the Sultan on rifles and ammunition is 6 per cent, ad valorem, and the merchants think that the British Consul will offer the Sultan a larger sum than he can rely on from the customs, in order to stop the trade. For these reasons most of the merchants had not risked ordering out very large consignments this season. Only Gqguyer, who is inti mate with the Sultan, had imported as large a quantity as usual, and he was con tinuing to send large orders to Europe. So far this season not many Afghan buyers had been to Masqat, and prices had dropped in consequence.* The merchants said that formerly their business depended on the Arab trade with the “ hinterland/* and that only the last year or two there had been this extraordinary rush of Afghans. The Afghan purchasers were very welcome as they bought in large quantities and were very free with their money. They were ready to bribe anybody and every body. It is very hard to say, even approximate ly, what stock of rifles there is in Masqat. Our man made careful enquiries from several firms, and he was told by Malcolmand Harman that he could get 77,000 good rifles (magazine, Martini-Henri and Martini-Metford ('303) and good quality Gras rifles from the various firms in Mas qat now, exclusive of Goguyer’s stock, and that of the older pattern rifle such as Sniders, Gras, etc., there were probably 100.000 in Masqat.* The total of 77,000 was arrived at after carefully calculating the numbers of dif ferent kinds of rifles. The 100,000 is merely an approximation. Our man was told by Abdul Ghafur, the Inspector of Customs at Masqat, that Goguyer had 5,000 cases of rifles in stock, and each case seems to contain at least 20 rifles. Most of them were believed to be Martini-Henri and short Martini-Metford rifles. This would mean 100,000 rifles, and altogether there are apparently about 250.000 rifles in Masqat. This season the merchants are giving 400 rounds of ammunition with each rifle priced at Rs. 100 or over and 100 rounds with each rifle at less than Rs, 100, and it is believed that they have enough ammunition in stock to do this, as well as to meet demands for extra ammunition. Last year the merchants gave 200 rounds per rifle of whatever quality or descrip tion. Our man asked Malcolm what cartridges he could supply apart from any purchase of rifles he might make. The merchant offered to supply the following at once, not necessarily from his own stock, but he could procure them locally:—- 30,000 *303 cartridges 300.000 M.H. 200.000 Gras ,, It appears that a certain number of men come to Masqat to buy only cartridges, and the merchants keep an extra stock for this purpose. There were no signs of the Afghan market being glutted with rifles and of the demand being only for cartridges, though the course of trade may incline gradually in this direction in a few years’ time. * See “ d.e3cription and prices Masqat.” of rifles at Stock of ammunition-13 Our man heard nothing about the stock of ammunition being short last year. All the Afghans appear to have taken their full complement, but one d'.ow-load of ammunition was too late to catch the caravan, and the Afghans told Barkat Khan to keep the ammunition in payment of his services instead of cash. The most popular rifles with the Af ghans are the M.-H.—especially the N. S. W. rifles marked with a crown and known as Tajdar rifle—and the *303 Martufl- ; Metford carbine, this is called by them the ‘ Dixon ’ rifle. There is a very small demand for the Mannlicher and Mauser rifles, presumably on account of their unfamiliarity, the diffi culty in quickly replacing ammunition, and the absence of components and spare parts. The demand for the '303 magazine rifle would be very large, only the merchants cannot as yet procure them in large quan tities. When our man especially asked Malcolm to get some '303 rifles for him, he said that he would try, but that he was not hopeful. The Arabs usually only buy the cheaper kinds of rifles ; Sniders, Werndl and Gras rifles are in demand with them. The Baluchis prefer the cheap M.-H. rifles marked “ Martini-Muscat/' made by German firms. The people of Kirman mostly buy the M.-H. rifles, but only a small trade is done with them. Of their last season’s sales (winter 1907-08), the merchants estimate that § of the rifles taken across the Gulf were for Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier and J for Persia and Makran. Trade with Arabia- The Masqat merchants say that for their regular business they have to depend on the Arabs who come and buy all the vear round. The Arabs usually buy in small quantities at a time, but the total trade is large. The Arabs take the rifles to Dibai and Kuwait and Dalmah, and it appears that they keep a stock of rifles, brought from Masqat, for sale in thes® 14 LB.Our men heard of a certain number o rifles being sold to Persians -m '.ese Arab ports r,nd taken across tbe Gulf to La- ristan, etc., and some of the Afghans sai that if the British stopped them fio.n going to Masqat they would go to D »ai or Kuwait for their rifles. However, Persians and Afghans prefer to purchase direct at Masqat, as this saves an extra middleman’s profits and the purchase of rifles in the Upper Arabian ports for taking across the Gulf is exceptional. It appears that practically all the rifles bought by Arabs stay m Arabia and are sold in the ‘ hinterland.’ Malcolm and Baijeot said that the Arab trade averaged about 100,000 rifles annually, but, as they made this remark when our men suggested a reduction ot prices on account of the slackness of sales, it cannot be taken too literally. At the same time there is certainly a large trade with the Arabs, and the merchants said that only last year the Afghan trade equalled the Arab trade. The Arabs can sometimes ship their rifles to Dibai and Kuwait by the British India boats. The Inspector of Customs at Masqat said that if the Arab merchants made it worth his while he could bribe the Captain, Chief officer, booking clerk, etc., of the steamers and get rifles and am munition shipped at Masqat for Dibai and Kuwait, as Masqat ‘ Halwa ’ (sweets). This was done in the S.S. Dwarka, Dumra, and Kola. But, as a general rule, the smaller men all take their arms up the Arab coast in dhows. While our men were in Masqat they saw a good number of Arabs buying arms. At Karachi .—The Amir’s Agent, Dost Muhammad Khan, gives all the help he can to the Afghans. His name was often mentioned by the Afghans (our men did not know that he was the Amir’s Agent). Durani,* whose rifles had been landed at fehirahan and who People who assist the gun-runners. One of Jan Muhammad,’party.had been unable to collect sufficient men and camels, went back to Karachi to get help from Dost Muhammad. The big dealers usually visit him on their way through Karachi. At Bandar Abbas. —There is a man Jan Muhammad, Sulaiman Khel, a broker, who lives there with his family, helps them in collecting camels, changing their money and hundis, gives information re routes, boats, etc., receives money on deposit. Does a large business. . n O'- 0 V At Qishm Island. —There is a man Abdul Ghafur, an Afghan, who helps them in getting boats, guides, etc. His assistance is sought by the men who go from Bandar Abbas to Dibai. * 1 1 ■ t- J ! ] • i id At Dibai —There is one Saiyid Umar, who keeps a langar there. Afghans going for arms make the excuse of going to visit him as a holy man. He helps them in every way. At Masqat. —All the gun merchants help the Afghans to procure boats and get their arms away. Ali Khan bin Musa Khan and Haroun bin Khamas were especially pro minent in this respect. The Sultan of Masqat’s Inspector of Customs, Abdul Ghafur Khan, a native of Poona. This man helps the Arabs in ship ping their arms by British India boats to the Upper Gulf ports. One of our men got to know him well. He offered to procure him any arms he want ed, and said that he had 250 rifles and a large number of cartridges of his own which he was prepared to sell at cheaper rates than the merchants. He offered to arrange for sailing boats at Matrah, and he also said that he could get our man’s arms landed at some small post on the Persian side—not at one of the regular points of call—by the Bri tish India S.S. Dwarka. He gave our man a letter of introduction to the Police Jemadar at Gwadar. His uncle, Abdul Karim, is Col lector of Customs at Masqat, and between the two there are doubtless many schemes for smuggling, etc.• As Abdul Ghafur bad 250 nfles and be had disposed of many more before th , an d much ammunition in h.s own posses sion, which he probably got r °™ Masqat merchants, it seems a fair mferen to assume that he helps them to land more rifles than they declare in their customs de clarations, and he is, probably, hand glove with the shipping people too. The Sultan of Masqat.—The trade means so much to him that he is willing to assist as far as lies in his power. If British gun boats capture dhows within the 3 -mde belt, they hand them over to the Sultan. He gives the cargo back to the boatmen an allows them to ship away again at nig . Abdul told our man that on 25th or 26t i December 1908, a boat belonging to Arabs with 250 rifles was captured by a British oun-boat and handed over to Sultan. The latter gave them back their rifles and let them go at night time. On Makran Coast.—At Gwadar the Sul tan’s Collector of Customs is a Hindu called Jetta. He is a friend of Abdul Karim at Masqat. He is ready to help in procuring p.n.mels. etc. From Gwadar to Chahbar.—Uhe Baluch Sirdar Mahmud Khan of Dashtiari makes all arrangements for the Afghans in the same way as Mustafa Khan and his brothers do at Jashk. Also Mir Ahmad Khan, son of Mir Afzul Khan, and his brother Jan Muhammad. Mir Ahmad Khan lives at Bahu near Dashtiari, and Jan Muhammad lives at Gwatar. These men help the gun-runners on the coast and inland as far as Sarbaz. From Sarbaz on, the Hakim of Sarbaz, Mir Bahram Khan, takes them over as far as Magas- From Magas the Hakim ot Sib, Mir Ghulam Rasul Khan, takes them as far as Shastun ; and from Shastun to Jalk Madat Khan carries on. From Jalk to Mashkhel Hakim Kimroz helps. From Chahbarto Gabriz .—The Baluch Sir dar Islam Khan ot Bint arranges for landing, guides, etc. Also at Chahbar the man Tursia Mul, storekeeper, broker and an17 agent of the British India boats, is ready to help. Minab .—The three brothers—Mir Mustafa arrangements. In and at Karvan, Kalifa Khair Muhammad, Kandahari, and Ghulam Muhammad bin Maluk assist. The Afghans usually hire their boats on the Persian side through the Baluch Sir- dars. The principal boatmen employed in this trade are:— Bahim Dad of Jashk. Gol Muhammad at Masqat. Dad Bahim at Matrah. Chotukai i ! (at Barkah. These men know the coast, ports and routes perfectly. They are also well in formed as to the position and movements of the gun-boats. Men supplied by Baluch Sirdars to ac company arms traders over to Masqat: Dur Muhammad, father-in-law of Mir Mustafa Khan, lives at Jashk. Murad, goldsmith, at Chahbar. Mir Yusuf of Komitag in Sarbaz dis trict. Jan Muhammad at Gwatar (the same * man mentioned among Baluch Sirdars, but he sometimes accompanies men to Masqat).

The Masqat merchants, like most tradesmen, exaggerated the amount^ and value of their business, and, as trade rivals, they did not know the statistics of other firms, and were not inclined to impart the truth about their own. [Malcolm put last season’s trade with the Persian coast (Afghans, Baluchis, Per sians, North-West Frontier tribes), down at 200,000 rifles, but our man considered this greatly exaggerated.] To arrive at even approximately cor rect totals, it would be necessary to have men stationed permanently at Masqat, Jashk, Chahbar, etc. The Arab trade is particularly hard to estimate, as the Arabs are buying rifles in small lots of tens and hundreds all the year round. We have the following few points to go on :— A.—Mahi Khel and Kharotis seen at Bandar Abbas, Jashk and Karachi, and questioned separately, all gave more or less the same information with regard to the big caravan they got through last year. They say that this caravan reached full strength at Bazman, and from there on it consisted of over 1,500 camels carrying 30,000 rifles with 200 rounds per rifle (less one boat-load of ammuni tion, probably about 100,000 rounds), The distribution of this caravan they give as:— Murad Khel 6,000 rifles : Kharoti 12,000 rifles; Mahi Khel 12,000 rifles : Total 30,000 * ~ }S. ^rom another source one of our men heard that the Nasero tribe had imported 3,300 rifles, but it is probable that these are included in the above 30,000. B.—If we try to arrive at the figures from the number of camels taken, we get nearly the same number. Number of rifles exported to Persian coast dur ing winter season, 1907-08.19 1. The Afghans say that they load up at least 20 rifles and 200 rounds am munition per rifle on each camel. Also all agree that the big caravan consisted of over 1,500 camels. If we make the liberal allowance of 10 per cent, camels being used lor kit and rations we get 1,350 camels loaded wuth rifles, and this would give us 27,000 rifles as a minimum. There were between 700 and 800 men with the caravan, each carrying, presumably, a rifle, and we know that one boat-load of ammunition was short, so this should bring the total to over 28,000 rifles. 2. We know that a caravan of 50 men and 60—70 camels under Lai Jan and Din Muhammad, Sulaiman Khel, went sepa rately from the big caravan. Allowing 10 camels for food, etc., this would give us a total of, say, 1,000 rifles. C. \\ e can also get some idea from the amount paid in bribes to the Baluch Sirdars. 1. Lai Jan and DinMuhammed (as above) landed 800 rifles at Parsa Bandar and Kmj Dap. They were being helped by Mir Mahmud Khan, Mir Ahmad Khan and Jan Muhammad. They paid them Rs. 8,000 at Rs. 10 per rifle. The same men also landed 200 rifles at Puzim. 2. The party that landed at Gabrig paid Nur Muhammad commission on 2,000 rifles. 3. Those that landed close to Jashk paid Mir Mustafa Khan on 500 rifles. 4. Those that landed west of Jashk at Bunji, etc., paid Barkat Khan Rs. 9,000 in cash, and gave him a boat-load of cartridges said to be worth from Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 7,000. Total Rs. 15,000. The contract with him was at Rs. 1-6 per rifle, but the landing was hurried owing to the arrival of a gun-boat, and a careful settle ment of accounts could not be made. The Kharotis told our men that most of them had got off at about 12 annas per rifle. This would bring the average toabout Be. 1 per rifle = 15,000 rifles. 1 2 3 and 4 give the amounts paid to only six Baluch Sardars, and the total of rifles comes to 18,500. Neither A, B, „or C include the Baluch or Persian trade. They also do not include any trade via TT* I ~ AVvVvOCJ From the above we can safely put down be direct importations from Masqat into Jghanistan at least 30,000 rifles for the 907-08 winter season {i.e., October o May 1908), it was probably greater, an icrhaps 40,000 would be nearer the mar . Also a good many rifles find their way nto Afghanistan through Baluchis. Our men heard the names of the follow- ng men of last season’s trade Lai Jan and Din Muhammad, Sulaiman Kiel. Hakim Jan, Haji Khan ^ and [brahim Khan with mixed party of Nasirs, Kharotis and Sulaiman Khel. Abdul Jhafur, Saiyid Khan and Islam Khan with a party of 124 Nasirs and Su'aiman Our men went too early in the season to judge what the Afghan trade will be this year (1903-09). Buying had scarcely commenced, and they only heard of one consignment of rifleshaving been landed on the Persian coast by Afghans. The people they met were mostly advance parties, who had gone to make arrangements and to see whether the prospect for this season were favourable. They are likely to be joined by many others if things go well.* Our men came across the following parties :— Last year’s traders. This year’s trade and traders. * T' e man we sent in January should he able to tell us all about this if he succeeds. 1. Muhammad Ali and Darya Khan, Afghans, with six men, Mush Khel, Sulaiman Khel.

Jan Muhammad, son of Taj Muham mad, Kabuli, who said he had been a re fugee in Persia for some time. Was with Durani and a party of men at Ja .hk. They had already landed 400 rifles at Bunji through Barkat Khan and were waiting for camels. 13. Muhammad Shah, Kandahari and two men, said he had come from Peshin to Karachi with Rs. 5,500; was waiting to start at Karachi. 14. Yezj Khan, Wali Muhammad, Umr Din, Darak, Barak, and Dost Muhammad, all traders at Cawnpur as a general rule. Tribe Taraki. Came Dera Ismail Khan; and Karachi. First 2 men landed at Chah- bar, rest at Bandar Abbas. These men also came last year. 15. Mir Hasan, Ahmad Khan, Ghulam Banus, Jumma, Dilbar, Ali Mir, Akhmad Din, Jan Khan and Nnr Ali, all Adam Khel, with about Rs. 500 each, went from Karachi to Band:.r Abbas. 16. Sher Hasan and Mir Was and 14 men, Adam Khel, all booked to Bandar Abbas, but 7 got oh at Chahbar, rest went on to Bandar Abbas with Mir Was. 17. Lai Sher, Adam Khel (one-eyed man), with two other Adam Khel, was at Bandar Abbas. 18. Abdul Majid, with 3 men, all Swatis, went from Karachi to Basrah and intend ed to return to Bandar Abbas and Masqat. Airldis Swatis. Abdul Majid had been in the Police at Quetta, and had served in the 126th Balu chis from which he had cut his name in October 1908. This party intended to buy rifles and gun-caps at Masqat. The people with the rifles would return with the Afgha n caravan, and those with gun-caps would take them to Karachi in rice bags. Abdul Majid had a cane (walking stick) with his police crest or number on it and he said that by showing this at Karachi he had passed ?s a policeman on special service. 19. Abdul Ghafur of Shamozai village near Chakdara, Swat, and Rahmatulia, also a Swati of Gulabad village. Abdul Ghafur was at Jashk with Mustafa Khan, and Rahmatulla was going to Dibai. Abdul Ghafur said for many years past he had been going to the Gulf to buy Manser pistols which he could buy for Rs. 70 each at Masqat, and sell for Rs. 400 each in Swat. He gets 100 cartridges with each pistol. He buys 3 or 4 pistols and returns by land along the telegraph line and then branching off inland reaches the North-Western Railway at Dadu or Sehwan station. Thence by train to Dargai and on to Malakand. He said that he had never experienced any difficulty f Might be of interest to the Police. toiiMiin. 'Knilj t Might be of interest to Police and Political Agent, Malakand. w23 Bfliuch Traders, 1908-09. Arms in Makran- Rifles procurable at Masqat. The following particulars were heard of this year's trade with Baluchis of Makran, etc.:— (1) A consignment of 990 rifles was brought to Pasa Bandar for Mir Ghulam Rasul Khan of Sib, of which 90 rifles were intended for Baluchis of Dizak and Sarbaz. This was in December 1908. Mir Ghulam Rasul hopes to sell these rifles to Afghans. (z) Abdul Nabi, son of Dad Rahim of Hyderabad (Sind), and Fazl, who have been carrying on the business of cloth merchants in Bint for many years, went to Masqat with some Baluchis and bought 100 rifles and 11,000 cartridges. These are for sale in Bint. (3) Sirdar Islam Khan, Hakim of Bint, himself went to Masqat this winter and purchased 190 rifles and a lot of cart ridges. He put his purchases into two sailing boats and returned himself by steamer to Chahbar. On the way across the Captain of the dhow, which had 90 rifles on board, caught sight of one of the British India boats and, thinking she was a gun-boat, threw all the rifles over board. The remaining 100 were landed safely. (4) Mir Saiy:d Khan of Geh imported 170 rifles from Masqat this season. Our men believe that the majority of the rifles purchased by Baluchis find their way into Afghanistan. The Baluch traders sell at 100 per cent, profit to Afghans and 50 per cent, profit to other Baluchis. On the Makran Coast most of the people had rifles. Our men do not know to what extent the people living inland are armed. Nimroz, Hakim of Mash Khel, is buying rifles for himself to arm his following with. He buys at Dizak and Sarbaz. N.B.—The Lee-Metford and Lee-Enfield cannot be bought at Masqat in any num bers.• Our man arrived at theie figures in the following manner : He made himself out to be an agent from the Nawab of Dir, and he said that he had been commissioned to make purchases on a very large scale for the a ming of the whole state. The firms in Masqat appear to form small rings, each composed of 3 or 4 merchants. The mer chants in one ring mutually help each other in making up deficiencies of stock, etc. Our man went to Malcolm first. In his ring are included Baijeot and Harun-bin- Khamas. He then went to Muhammad Abdulla, with whom are one Abdur Rahim, Ali Khan-bin-Musa Khan and another man (not known). He was not able to enter into negotiations with each firm, as he could not have kept it secret from the others and by patronising rival establish ments he would have been thrown over by the people upon whom he was relying for his information. For quantities in which rifles can be procured in Europe see letter ‘ G ’ and catalogue ‘ H. ’ While looking through the files in Baijeot’s shoo, our man saw receipts for one lot of 20,000 Wemdi rifles and 5,000 Mausers from some Belgium firm. Baijeot said that he had bought these two job lots very cheap. He did not approach Goguyer, but he says that the Afghans nearly all work through either Harjn Ali Khan-bin-Musa Khan or Muhammad Abdulla, and that he believes Goguyer goas in mainly for the Arab trade.* * But later reports state that Goguyer did a large business with Afghans this last season. The figures he gives are the totals he got from the Malcolm and Muhammad Abdulla rings, and were given him as the number of rifles he could procure immedi ately on the spot in Masqat. Malcolm said that he could cable to Europe and get out any particular sort of rifle in any quantity required, also cart ridges, within two months. The native firms required three months’ notice.

The cost of the various rifles is given in pf^s madr P ° rtinS rifleS in&lt; ° Afsham * &lt;ai1 detail under “ Description of Rifle and prices at Masqat.” The amount the Afghans31 have to pay the Baluch Sardars for their help, boat h.ire and guides varies somewhat according to which individual they employ and the number of rifles they are importing. Barkat Khan, who arranges for traders landing west of Jashk, did the largest business last year. His rates were— Rs. A. P. For himself, one-cart- 1 6 0 per rifle landed, ridge and For boat and boatmen 10 0 ditto. For guide .. ..0 8 0 ditto. Total .. 2 14 0 and 1 cartridge per rifle. As has been described elsewhere (number of rifles exported to Persian coast, 1907-08) many Afghans got off with only having to pay Barkat Khan at 12 annas per rifle. Barkat Khan is also charging Rs. 1-6-0 for his own share this year, but he is not demanding the one cartridge. His brothers—Mir Mustafa Khan and Nue Muhammad—only claimed Re. 1 per rifle as their share last year. Mustafa Khan is also only asking Re. 1 per rifle this year. He hopes to get more trade by under bidding his brother. Afghans who landed their arms last year, west of Chahbar, paid Islam Khan Rs. 2-12-0 and one cartridge per ride. This did not include boat and guide, but the consignments were small. Aighans who landed their arms east of Chahbar last year had to pay Mahmud Khan, Mir Ahmad Khan and Jan Muham mad at Rs. 10 per rifle. This include guide and boat hire. These rates were so unfavourable that v ery few Afghans have employed these three men this year. Jan Muhammad offered to help our men at Rs. 2 per rifle under 2,000 rifles, and at Re. 1 pm rifle over 2,000 rifles. The Headmen and Sardars through whose districts the caravans have to pass on tSr journey inland to Afghanistan are32 usually given a rifle or two as ‘bakhshish/ and tor this they supply a few sheep and goats for food and men to show the caravan the road. The Afghans bury a few cheap rifles in Masqat for this purpose. Once in Afghanistan they have to pay nothing. No tolls or duties are levied upon them, and it appears that the hakims and toll collectors do not even dare to levy the usual bribes. I believe, though, that an occasional hakim is presented with a rifle. The Afghan traders themselves say that • it cost them Rs. 20 per rifle and its com plement of cartridges by the time they have got to Kabul, This is all expenses including their own food, but naturally this must vary greatly (and in inverse ratio) with the number of rifles they are importing. The examples our men quote are mostly for small traders importing from 200 — 300 rifles. Their expenses per rifle work out as follows — Rs. a. p. Paid to Baluch Sardar for help .. 18 0 Paid to boatmen and hire of dhow .. 10 0 Paid to guide .. .. ..080 Paid to fitting out camel with saddle, ropes, etc. .. .. ..100 Paid to camel driver at Rs. 20 per camel of 20 rifles .. .. = 1 o 0 Paid as cost of camel at Rs. 120 to Rs. 160 each carrying 20 rifles .. =8 0 0 Paid as bribes and minor expenses at Masqat ,. , # 1 0 0 Paid as bribes to Baluch Sardars inland and Afghan Hakims in rifles, say, at 1 0 0 Per rifle ,. J5 0 0 Supposing that the man has bought 250 rifles, the above charges will come to Rs. 3,750, and at Rs. 20 per rifle it would total Rs. 5,000. This lea yes Rs. 1,250 un accounted for. Out of this has to come his journey to Karachi and thence to Gulf ports and his own food on the whole trip. And if in addition he has had to borrow some of his capital and pay interest, commission, etc.,33 he may well have spent as much as R s 1,250. The traders say that after deducting their expenses at Rs. 20 per rifle they make a profit of 400 to 450 per cert, on each rifle, and in addition to this they are one camel to the good on each lot of 20 rifles. 1. Last year after the Afghans had their dhow captured by the gunboat at Jashk, they wanted to attack the British Con sulate there. They were dissuaded from this by Mir Barkat Khan (who was running all their business) as he said be would get into trouble. 2. This year there was no talk of attack ing the Consulate or Telegraph Station, nor ol damaging the telegraph and tele phone lines. 3. The Afghans apparently do not con nect their loss of last year with the Tele graph Department, they think it was en tirely due to the gun-boats. Our men did not hear Mr. New’s name mentioned. From what they saw and heard, the gun-runners considered themselves per fectly safe when once they had landed their arms on the Persian coast. 4. Our men heard and saw nothing of dhows flying the French flag. Answers &lt;o miscellaneons questions. These points were not mentioned in the ori ginal instructions given to our men. The Sultan of Masqat is reported to have bought recently six cannons for his own use. 5. Neither Afghans nor Masqat mer chants mentioned orders for cannon or machine guns. 6. The Afghans have no system of espionage on the Navy. The nakhudas do whatever there is to be done in this line. They seem to be quite confident of giving the gun-boats the slip. 7. The Afghans say that they mean to fight hard if the gun-boats attack them. They hear that in last year’s fight their Mauser bullets went through the side of the gun-boats, and they now think that they will be able to do a lot of damage to the ,crews.As far as our men could discover none of this goes on on at all a large scale. It appears that a few revolvers are smug gled over on the person or in traveller’s kit and bedding, and that this is not very difficult to do. ' Our men, who were both Pathans and who were not known to the Customs people or Police at Karachi, did not have their kit searched. One of our men had a sword and a dagger in his bedding, and these were not noticed. Formerly a considerable number oi cartridges were smuggled across to Bom bay and Karachi in date packages, but since one man was discovered and im prisoned less of this has gone on. A man who keeps a fancy goods shop at Masqat named Jabfur, son of Nur Muham mad of Karachi, says that he often takes one or two revolvers with him when he goes to Karachi, and that he can do this without any difficulty. Jewuspi Might be of interest to the Police. Our man met a man, Hakim Taj Muham mad, Baluchi, at Gwadar. This man had been 18 years at Karachi, where he had served as a Head Constable in the Railway Police, and was for a long time in the employ of the Civil Surgeon. He said that in Karachi he could buy any kind of pistol he wanted to from the British Gunners there. (I suppose they bought for him at Haji Dosul or some other gun-shop). 'He recommended our man to go to his brother Dilshad at Juna Dhobi Ghat, Karachi, if he wanted anything in this line. ■ 1 Enctqm Might be of interest to the Police.41 Routes taken by Afghans to the Gulf. Money, how raised- Participation of Amir- REPORT OF SECRET AGENT “E” Afghan Arms trade in the Gulf. 1 . By far the larger number of traders reach the Gulf ports by sea from Karachi and Bombay. Of the Afghan traders nearly all are Ghilzais of the Kharoti, Nasir, Sulaiman Khel sections and some of the Niazi tribe. These men are traders by profes sion and have taken to gun-running as the most profitable line of business. Many of these men have traded regularly with Bandar Abbas for many years, there be ing an export of cctton, wool, etc., from Afghanistan to that port. Now that they have taken to the arms trade these men send their camels and servants overland to Bandar Abbas loaded with ordinary merchandise, while they themselves go round by sea. They rejoin their camels at Bandar Abbas, and bring them down the coast to the ports where rifles are dis embarked. However, the majority of Afghan arms traders inake no overland arrangements. They book from Karachi and rely upon being able to buy camels at Bandar Abbas. Good Herat! camels are sold at from Rs. 250—350—Kabuli. The Adam Khel and other frontier tribes all buy their camels at Bandar Abbes. 2. The Ghilzais take most of their money in notes. They combine among them selves to collect their capital, and they also borrow from their own people at interest. None of the men he was associated with had borrowed from Hindus in Bri tish Territory, and the same applies to Adam Khel. 3. Influential men and merchants of standing can borrow from the Amir. He does not take interest, but he requires them to collect a considerable party of men to trade, and he also lays down in what district he wants them to sell the rifles. For instance, Aupo and Muhammati. Jan, Nasirs, were lent Rs. 50,000 (Kabuli) by the Amir, and they are to sell in Herat and Afghan Turkistan. Last year Shah42 Dad, Dadar tribe, got money from tbe Amir and bought Rs. 1 , 20,000 worth of rifles This year Shah Dad had a dispute with Barkat Khan about his commission. Barkat Khan showed Shah Dad a letter which he said was from the Amir, and told him that if he did not pay the Amir would take it from him at Kabul and send it to him (Barkat Khan). Also Ali Khan bin Musa Khan of Masqat had a letter from the Amir asking him to give credit as far as he could to people whom he con sidered trustworthy. Ali Khan let Janai, Niazi, have 220 rifles this year on credit. (Janai was the man who lost heavily when the dhow was captured last year.) (Again this year Janai lost his 220 rifles, and, in addition to this, 200 rifles which he was taking across to sell for Ali Khan.) He says that as far as he knows neither the Amir nor Nasrulla are buying for themselves. They only exercise a bene volent supervision over the trade and indi cate the special markets to be exploited. 4. There is no difficulty at Karachi. The Arrangements at Karachi. Afghans take care to separate into small parties, and they keep quiet in different serais until it is time for them to be medi cally inspected before going on board. Practically no enquiries were made by police or port officials, and these are easily answered by saying that they are going to Karbala or Baghdad. 5. Nearly all the Afghans book to Ban- Movements of Afghans after leaving Karachi, dar Abbas. They are frightened of being followed by spies if they disembark at Jashk. The people of the party our man was with, who were selected to do the purchas ing, got out at Gwadar. These men had been there the year before, and they said that they would have to go 3 days’ march up the coast, and they then would get a boat to cross over to Masqat in. This arrangement did not work this year, and they had to re-embark at Chahbar. Two of them, by bribing the port officials with Rs. 30, managed to disembark at Masqat, and the rest got out at Jashk. Therest of his party went straight to Bandar Ab bas. There, as soon as they got out of the quarantine, they went and bought camels the coast and marched slowly to Zaravat, stopping in places where the grazing was good. They sat quietly at Zaravat un til the rest of their arrangements matured. As mentioned above some of these men manage to land direct at Masqat by brib ing. Most of them, though, have to land on the Makran Coast, and then cross by dhow to Masqat and its vicinity. At Masqat they usually lie up in the hills or stay wdtb the arms dealers and only come into the town at night. They fall in with the native touts of the gun merchants and they are taken to the merchants’ houses. The merchants show them samples of rifles, pistols and ammunition. They give their orders and pay the money. Negotia tions usually take several days. Also the merchants will make all arrange ments for shipping the arms, hiring the boats and deciding where they will try to Afghans paid the money over to the mer chants who promised to try to get the rifles without any rifles on board. This year some of the Masqat merchants allowed their old customers to have a certain number of rifles on credit. Arrived on the Makran Coast they found out from the local Baluchis where the camels were lying up. One or two men went off to get in touch with the rest of their party, and the remainder stayed on the coast at the points where the rifles were expected. If none of the Afghan purchasers accom pany the rifles in the dhows, then the Masqat merchants give the nakhudas a list of the owners and the numbers of their from Kharotis, and they left at once down * (Our man did not go to Masqat himself.) To return now of the actual purchasers.* t That is to say if this has not already been done by one of the Baluch Sirdars. land on the Persian Coastf. In many cases (this occurred with his own party), the across in so many days to such and such places, and the Afghans crossed over ahead44 several consignments. As soon as they reach the Makran Coast they show their papers to Earkat Khan, or one of the other Baluch Sardars, and he at once informs the owners The dhows are unloaded at once. If the owners and camels are on the spot the rifles are taken off immediately to their 1 \ ing up place, and if the owners are not present they are stored in the nearest village. As the actual landing place depends on wind, tide, gun-boats, etc., it frequently happens that the rifles are landed many miles up or down the coast from where they were expected. All difficulty and risk of loss is prevented by the assistance at once rendered by the Baluch Sardars. 6 . As mentioned above, Afghans who have gone direct to Masqat without enlist ing the help of one of the Baluch Sardars can hire their boats and make all other arrange ments for the crossing through the Masqat merchants. However, the majority em ploy the Bc.luch Sardars, and in any case the help of the latter men will be necessary when once the rifles have reached the Makran Coast. The Afghans usually have to make a separate payment for the hire of a boat from the Makran Coast to Masqat. The ordinary hire isKs. 120 for this single journey. For the return journey with arms the usual charge is Re. 1 per rifle. Owners of small consignments of arms may have to pay more if they are not prepared to wait for the full cargo to be made up with other peo ple’s purchases. Sometimes the nakhudas make up the full freight with other goods. The Masqat merchants make the same charge of Re. 1 per rifle when dhows are arranged through them. Arab nakhudas are to be found willing to take arms at 8 annas per pfle, but they are not considered reliable, and the Afghans prefer to deal with the nakhudas from the Makran side over whom, through the Baluch Sardars, they have much more control. Pistols are usually shipped free if in small proportion to the number of rifles. This ia Hire oi Boats± Baluch Sirdar. 45 also the case with ammunition, unless large extra supplies of cartridges are being taken. As many as 1,500 rifles are sometimes car ried in one dhow. The usual number is 1,000 rifles with a proportionate quantity of ammunition. The nakhudas when they have arms on board generally sail up the Batinah coast and. then seize a favourable opportunity for making a dash across the Gulf at night. There is a considerable trade up and down the coast, as well as from one shore to the other, and the nakhudas get good information given them as to the whereabouts and movements of gun-boats by the skippers of other boats. Cases oc curred this year where Arab nakhudas, bringing over rifles without their owners, secretly deposited 30 or 40 rifles in their homes on the Arab Coast, so as to insure themselves against eventual loss if their dhows were captured by our gun-boats. After getting the rifles safely across, they went back for the remainder. The trade was at its busiest early in March and it appears that some method was adhered to in shipping the arms across. The Masqat merchants would not let the dhows straggle across as they liked, but they were kept collected along the Batinah coast, and two or three started off at a time. As soon as their arrival was safely reported, the next party made a dash for it. The dhows were mostly obtained from Bunji. The following are some of the principal nakhudas :— Ibrahim, Mad Ghu.am Ba’uch of Bunji (he brought across 3,000 rifles, while our man was 'h re). M (brought over 2,600 rifle:;). Muhammad Wali Ja'ar &gt;* »» Mulla &gt;* ” Khudad^d »* »» Had Yusuf »» ” 7 . Our man was attached to a party which remained at Zaravat and Jashk, and which landed their arms at Bunji. He consequent ly only came in contact with Barkat Khan. 14 LB.46 Again this year this man seems to be taking the leading part among the Ba uch Sardars. Nearly all the Afghans are deal- ing with him, and he must be making large profits. At the same time he certainly renders great services, and without his ac tive help and goodwill the Afghans won find the trade much more difficult and nsky.- Barkat Khan received for the first con signments that were landed this year Re. 1-6 per rifle. This is for his personal services , 1 and does not include hire of boat or pay of guide, if provided, and out of which he no doubt makes a separate commission. The later arrivals refused to pay more than Re. Iper rifle, and after some discus sion Barkat Khan agreed to this. He has two agents wbo do most of the work for him. These are Dadulla and Dosti, both Baluchis. As was mentioned above, Barkat Khan appears to have been given a firman by the Amir. 8 . Zaravat was selected as the final ren dezvous for the large caravan. This place is about 30 miles, north-west of Jashk, on the road to Minab. It is quite close to Agushki and Shirahan. It was selected on account of the good camel-grazing to be got there, and also because it was considered a safe and secluded spot. The various parties of Afghans had been slowdy collecting there for some three mouths. It had become a regular Afghan colony by the middle of March. New arrivals were coming in daily, and all were very pleased with them selves. Those whose purchases had all arrived busied themselves with clean ing and packing up their rifles, they were also continually testing their rifles. Our man says it was as though field firing v^as going on. Many of the Afghans had used up their allowance of cartridges, and in many cases the owners of Mauser pistols had fired away all their 400 rounds. All had assembled by the afternoon of the 20th March, and the caravan started on the morning of the 21st March. Rendezvous.47 The Caravan. Men who had landed their arms at Gabrig and elsewhere, east of Jashk, had all ren dezvoused at Zara vat. Our man knows' that two boat loads were left behind, as the caravan refused to delay any longer, but, excepting these, he believes that the trade is over for the season. 9. The caravan consisted of 1,100 camels accompanied by about 400 men. Alto gether there were about 700 Afghans and frontier tribesman collected at Zaravat, but 300 of these are returning by sea. 20 rifles with a proportional amount of ammu nition (100 rounds for single loading and 400 rounds for magazine rifles) is the ordi nary load per camel. But each man had arranged to carry 1 | maunds of flour and a 4 days’ supply of water in a mussak, this and a certain amount of kit reduces the average number of rifles to about 16 per camel. As some of the Afghans had pur chased extra amounts of ammunition and a considerable number of pistols, our man makes a further reduction on this account, and calculates the total number of rifles at 16,000 flus about 2,000 pistols. As regards the rifles I think this may be looked upon as a moderate estimate, and the number is not likely to be less than this. He divides this number up into— 6.000 Martini-Henri rifles and carbines, 5.000 Martini-Metford rifles and carbines, 5,000 Rifles of the Snider era. These are old cheap rifles, probably Gras and Werndl. In addition to the above he knows of 50 magazine rifles, 5 shot Mausers and Mannlichers. He estimates the number of pistols at 2,000 (mostly Mauser). The caravan is going to march from Zaravat by route No. 8 (green pamphlet) crossing the Persian-Afghan frontier at Sar-i-Shela, which they hope to reach in about 50 days. They originally intended to march via Bazman, but this plan was afterwards dropped, as it was not considered as safe as that now taken.48 They were frightened of passing too close to Robat, and they also wished to keep clear of the telegraph line. Attempts on the part of the Persian Gov-^ ernment to interfere with the march of the hajilehs is neither anticipated nor fear ed. Caution is only observed while pass ing through Sistan, where opposition by British forces is thought possible. Their spies precede the caravan by about four days and give warning of any danger. Each man with the caravan keeps out a good rifle and plenty of ammunition in case of emergencies on the road. The names of the principal men in the trade are*— * These are the important people, but, if the names of the ordinary small traders are required^ I can give many more. (a) Nasirs. —Majid. Ghulam Khan. Aupo. Ahmad Jan. Rasoul Khan. (b) Kharotis. —Bayan. Isa Khan. Haji Ramzan. Bhawal. (c) Sulaiman Khel .—Haibat Khan. (d) Niazis. —Janai(or Jan Muhammad).

The Nasirs were there in greater numbers than any other tribe, and their headmen were the most important people in the caravan. After them came the Kharotis. About 70 Adam Khel were engaged in the trade this year. Of the Afghans, Jan Muhammad, son of Nurakai, purchased the best quality of rifles. He was first on the scene, and he bought up 320 Tajdar M.-H. rifles (see Agent “A’’ report) and 70 Martini-Met fords. The magazine rifles (about 50) were all bought49 Destination of Rifles. Feeling against British officials- Rifles and Prices- * British Government pattern marked N. S. W. by the Afridis. The cheap rifles were pur chased by the Afghans, the Afridis would not look at them. Most of these will probably be sold in Herat and Afghan Turkistan. 10. It appears that very little of this year’s trade will go to Kabul, which is fairly well stocked. Jan Muhammad, son of Nurakai, and the Adam Khel, will bring their rifles to the Peshawar border via Kabul, but the bulk of the Af ghan trade will go to Herat, Afghan Turkistan, Ghazni, Urghun, and the Khost and Jadran border. Aupo, Ahmad Jan, Naibat Khan, Ab dulla Khan (Kandahari) are all big mer chants who are going to take their rifles to Herat by the Amir’s orders. They own at least 3,000 rifles. The Kabul market seems to be well-stocked, and the best prices are not to be expected there. 11. There seems to be no intention on the part of the Afghans to take any revenge on our officials in south-east Persia for previous losses and attempts to interfere with their trade. Their main desire is to get their arms in Afghanistan with as little trouble as possible. They seem to look upon the losses caused by gun-boats as all in the day’s work, and they are prepared to take this fair sporting risk. The Afghans said that, if we stopped them from booking at Karachi and Bombay and forced them to go all the way round by land, then they would attack our telegraph station at Jashk. 12. The following are the descriptions and prices of the rifles most in favour this year. Es. usually (1) Martini-Henry (Tajdar)* .. 53 (2) Martini-Henry stamped with a crown on each side .. .. 51 (3) As No. 2, only carbine size with wood to end of stock.

Two Arab-owned dhows were crossing over from Batinah to Bnnji. A storm arose in the night, and very early in the morning they found themsel\es opposite the European buldings at Jasak and in close proximity to the gun-boats. The larger of the two dhows had one Afghan, Shah Dad, and nine Arab sailors on board.t The Arabs wanted to throw the rifles over board but Shah Dad threat ened to shoot them all and got them to make a bolt for it down the coast while it was still dark. This they did, and they drew the boat up in a small creek three miles below Jasbk and, sending to Barkat Khan for men, they unloaded the arms there and stored them within 60 yards of the shore. They remained here three days with Shah Dad keeping watch over them until camels arrived from Zara vat. It was said that the Customs sent camels to take the rifles away, but Shah Dad fired on them and they fled. Capture of dhows by gun-boats. f(The purchases of cur man and his party were on board this boat.) The small boat was less fortunate. It was carrying arms belonging to Kharotis, but there were no Afghans on board. It got separated from the bigger boat and was captured. It is said that 700 rifles were taken on this boat. The second dhow was captured near Bunji. It is said that it contained 1,500 rifles. Among these were 220 rifles given to Janai on credit by Ali Khan bin Musa Khan.i 51 Absentees from main caravan. Masqat merchants. Trade prospects, seasons, 1908-09 and Local Trade. 14. Of the two boats that were too late for the caravan, one boat was known to have landed at Gabrig just as the caravan was starting. The second boat with rifles purchased by Kharotis and Sulaiman Khel was delayed at Masqat. The caravan, would not wait any longer for these, as they had already been col lected some time, and they said that the hot weather was upon them. The owners of these two boat loads have remained behind. 15. Most of the Afridis and Afghans have traded with the following mer chants :— Ali Khan bin Musa Khan. Ibrahim. Goguyer. 1909-10. 16. Not so many rifles were bought this year as last, partly because prices have dropped in Afghanistan and partly because they could not get enough of their favourite “Tajdar” rifles. Orders for these for next year have been placed with the merchants at Masqat. A large number of extra cartridges have been bought this year. Many Afghans and Adam Khel bought 4,000 or 5,000 extra rounds. The proportion of cartridges is likely to be greatly increased next year. The Afghans are making plans for going again next year. The Kharotis said that they intended to go very early, before the end of this hot weather. They would thus get the pick of the market, and would be able to ship their arms across the Gulf with little risk, as the gun-boats would not be on the look-out at that time of year. They would store their rifles with the local Baluchis until the next caravan season. The traders are expecting to make 200 per cent, net profit this year. 17. No rifles were sold locally in Makran or Persia. The Baluchis on the coast all had their private rifles, and they do not do any trade with the Afghans. The few rifles that they had for sale were ofbad quality and were priced high. The Afghans tried to dispose locally of some rifles that had got damaged by sea water. 18. There was no mention of Afghans buying machine guns or small cannon. 19. He neither heard of nor saw any dhows flying the Trench flag.

The precautions taken by our politicals along the coast of British Makran appear to be good, and the difficulty and risk of getting the rifles away inland seem to have discouraged gun-runners from making the attempt. No doubt the smuggling of a few rifles and pistols and such like operations on a very small scale do take place, but no definite information to this effect was ob tained. The first signs of any landing of arms were noted at Gwadar. t Here, there is a cloth merchant, one Mul- la Bahram, son of Mulla Jumaat, who is secretly employed by Mulla Abdur Rahini, to smuggle rifles. Abdur Rahim is believed to be in the employ of the Indo-Persian Tele graphs (not in his capacity of smuggler!). The way Abdur Rahim works is that, when the Wali of Gwadar goes over to Masqat, he or one of his men follows him there. He buys a few rifles and hands them,over to the servants of the Wali. As these men are not inspected by the Customs, they can land the rifles at Gwadar to hand them over ,to Mulla Bahram. There are also a few Hindu shopkeepers at Gwadar who offered to sell our man one or two rifles. - Presumably they get their rifles across by similar means, but this smuggling is only on a small scale. Gwadar is not used as a landing place for rifles as, although it may be possible to get them ashore there, there are no means of getting them away from the place. East of Gwatar (between Jini and Gwatar) there is a small place called Sukkur. While at Gwatar our man heard that on 23th February 1909 one Abdulla, son of Din Muhammad, Dewari Baluch of Kila Nasari near Dizak, landed 800 rifles and 9 boxes 141.B.of ammunition here. He managed to get them safely away to Bakhu Kalat where Mir Nawab Khan (Hakim or Sirdar) took 6 rifles and 1,200 rounds as his commission. Abdulla was acting as agent for Din Mu* hammad, Mahi Khel Afghan, who gave him Re. 1 per rifle landed. This was the only case our man heard of any large consignment of arms being landed w.thin British territory. In the report of secret agent E it is stated that Mulla Isa of Sur is secretly engaged in the arms trade. The present agent denies this, and as he was in a better position to judge than they were, I am inclined to accept his statement. Jalal Khan Hakim, of Gwatar, appears to be somewhat obstructive to the gun runners, but from our man's report it is not clear whether this is from a sense of duty, or whether his own demands are too exhorbitant—probably the latter. In December 190S some Baluchis landed 400 rifles near Pasa Bandar. Jalal Khan tried to stop them, and only let them go after they had given him 12 rifbs and 600 cartridges. The boat, in which the arms were brought across, belonging to Sol Mu hammad, was confiscated. From Gwatar our man worked up along the coast to Jashk. The landings which he saw or heard of are given in the tables at the end of the report. Mahmud Khan of Dashtiari is an active helper of the Afghans. His methods are the same as Barkat Khan's {vide former reports). At Dizak .—Mir Bahram Khan and his brother Mir Ali Muhammad Khan, Now- sherwans. At Baku Kalat -—Mir Ahmad Khan and his brother Dost Muhammad, also Mir Na wab Khan. At Jashk .—Barkat Khan and Mir Mustafa Khan. At Bint -—Islam Khan.

Nearly all the Afghans had left the coast before our man arrived, he met very few. There were 6 Afghans at Jashk at the end of April. These were Khuda Dost, Nur Mu hammad, Jan Muhammad, Alidad and two others. These men had given Rs. 4,000 to Barkat Khan, who will purchase rifles for them now and store them for them until next season. Caravans. f Two of the above-mentioned Afghans intended to stay through the hot weather with Khalifa Khair Muhammad, and the others were going to return by ship to Karachi. | &lt;• He also heard that there were still some 15 Afghans at Minab. According to what he heard it appears that the Afghans who landed their arms even as far east as Pasa Bandar all made their way up the coast and joined the main caravan at Biaban. He heard nothing of any smaller caravans taking a more easterly route, but it seems probable that the Afghans, who were working from Dizak as a base, managed to get their rifles across the Afghan border independent- iy- He heard at Jashk from some of Mir Mustafa Khan’s men that a second caravan, consisting of 50 men and 100 camels, with Niaz Muhammad, Niazai, as headman, left Jaghin on 15th April. His informants said that tlvs caravan was going to follow the Rodan (Rigan ?) route. This is the only information any of our men have given of a second caravan, and as this is only hearsay evidence it cannot be con sidered thoroughly reliable. It seems pro bable that there would have been a second caravan judging by the number of rifleslanded late in March and early in April which were all too late for the big caravan. The information is important if true, and it should be possible to verify it from Mr. Nbws’ reports. li the caravan existed, and if it contained 100 camels, this would probably mean about 2,000 rifles. He gives the description and marks of pattern ot rifles, several rifles seen on the Makran Coast. These were mostly Martini-Henrys, including the Peabody rifle; the Gras; the Mauser^ one Winchester repeater; Mauser and Browning pistols. The descriptions and prices he gives agree exactly with those given in Secret Agent “A” ’s report {vide his types of rifle Nos. 5, 13, 34, 41, 42 and 43), and I have not considered it necessary to give them a second time. He gives the following prices heard from Masqat and Afghan prices, some Afghan traders:— No. Rifles. M ,sqat price. &gt; Kabul and Kandahar price. '—V- Herat and Mazar-i- . Sharif price. Rs. Rs.

REPORT OF SECRET AGENTS B. ” AND “ D.” Pathans travelling either up or clown the Gulf manage to land at Masqat direct from the steamer in one of the following ways. At Bombay or Karachi, if they can disguise the fact that they are Path am and can pass themselves off as PanjabD or Hindustanis, they can book direct to Masqat. This is not very difficult. Our two men, who are both Pathans, wore Pan jabi clothes, and without disclosing the fact that they were travelling on Government duty took tickets to Masqat without ques tions being raised. When the steamer reaches Masqat the quarantine doctor with his native assistant and some chaprassis comes on board. He is given a list of the native passengers to Masqat, and they are taken off to four days’ quarantine by the native assistant. At the present time this man is one gaiyid Mukhdum Shah, and he has dis covered many ways of turning the quaran tine regulations and the gun-trade to his own advantage. If made worth his while he will allow natives who are supposed to be in quarantine to go off for three days, and they put in an appearance on the afternoon of the fourth just in time for the final inspection by the British doctor. He also takes advantage of the fact that the quarantine staff are the only Government officials on the spot who could possibly make things objectionable for any Pathans trying to land. Mukhdum Shah at once re cognised agent “D” as a Pathan, and threat ened to report him unless squared. Rs. 20 to Mukhdum Shah and Rs. 3 to each chap- rassi smoothed the way, and no more ques tions were asked. Many other Pathans who have booked to other ports also manage to land at Masqat. As soon as the steamer comes to anchor there it is at once surrounded by a lot of small boats. Gun merchants touts come on board from them, and they and the native quarantine officials wander about among the native passengers look- in* for likely Pathans. They qmetlyif 60 apprcach individuals, and ask them if they would like to land. This can be arrange- ed for a consideration, varying from Ks. 5 to Rs. 40 according to the substance of the individual. The bargain made, the man shoulders his kit, walks down the ladder into a bo d and is taken off to Matrah. On the 24th March, 21 Af ghans who came from Bandar Abbas by steamer managed to land at Masqat by paying Rs. 200 in bribes to quarantine and other officials. The ship’s officers apparently take no notice of this, and the onlv official who could make things un pleasant is the quarantine assistant. He has either been bribed directly or, if arrang ed through the touts, he gets his commis sion from them. Mukhdum Shah’s activities do not end on board the steamer. He has built a guest house at Matrah, and he takes the Pathans, who have secretly land ed, off to this. Here he has samples of rifles that are for sale in Masqat, and he persuades hi&gt; Pathan guests to deal with whichever merchant pays him the most commission. It will be seen that he is very favour ably situated. He is the only native with any official position on the spot, and he is the first in the field. In addition to building this house at Matrah, he is believed to have saved up 5,000 reals in cash out of the business. The quarantine chaprassis and the touts manage to sell a certain number of pis tols to Afghan passengers on board the India-bound ships. The Afghans con ceal them in their trousers and land thus at Karachi, where only the kit and not the person is searched. In addition to the above there are other methods of smuggling arms into Bom bay and Karachi. The gun merchant, Damodar Mul, does a large trade in dates and dried fish (for manure) between Masqat --and Bombay and Karachi. Ali Khan bin Musa Khan* and Saiyid Yusuf give pistols and ammunition to the nakhudas of Damodar Mul’s boats Silling of pistols on board steamers. Smuggling arms into India- * Afterwards exerted to in this report as Ali Musa61 Business enterprise in catching customers- (it is not known whether Damodar Mul r lso does this), and these are hidden under the boarding of the boats. When the boats arrive at Karachi or Bombay the dates and dried fish are taken off to the Customs, and the seemingly empty boats remain at or near the wharf. After a few days, when no suspicion is likely to be excited, men come down and carry off the pistols. The names of the men in Karachi who take over the pistols are not known, but they live in the Karadar quarter of the city. In Bombay the places are the Ali Chakla and Mandawar quarters, and the name of one of the recipients is believed to be Hasim Banda Ali. It is expected that this trade will be brisk in August and September, which is the date and dried-fish season. Another scheme is to put pistols and ammunition into kerosine oil tins and solder the top on again. The tins are then packed in wooden packing cases. When the boat gets to Karachi, and just before reaching the wharf, a chain or rope is fixed to the case, and this is lowered into the water and the chain fastened to a ring somewhere below the side of the boat. When a convenient opportunity offers the cases are pulled up and the pistol disposed of. A good number of pistols are taken over to Persia by Baluchis concealed on their persons. The Muhammareh Arab horse dealers buy rifles and pistols at Masqat, and they conceal pistols in the grain or horses’ nose bags and rifles in the fodder, and thus get them into Bombay. The gun merchants have now taken to sending their Agents to Karachi, Chahbar, Jashk and Bandar Abbas. These men take three different sets of clothes with them—Baluchi, Arab and faqir garments —they get to know the Afghans who in tend to go to Masqat, and rig them out with whichever type of garment seems most suitable for each particular cast of 14 I.B.62 countenance. This enables the Afghans to land at Masqat without trouble. All the Masqat gun merchants have large guest houses. Having caught their cus tomers they lodge and feed them thro igh- out their stay at Masqat. I bis is to prevent Afghans from being seen wandering about the streets and also to prevent them from approaching other firms. Afghans are not to be seen in the Masqat st reets, they all remain shut up in the houses. The Afghans and Baluchis mostly hire their boats on the Makran coast. They generally land at or above Matrah. The Masqat merchants are also prepared to make all arrangements for hire of boats. Dhunjee Mararji, gun merchant, owns 3 ‘bagalas’—(a type of boat) which he hires out for gumrunning. On the Masqat side the rate charged is one real (Its- 1-5-0) per rifle, on the Ma.kran coast the raf^ is Re. 1. The loading of rifles into small boats at Masqat is done quite openly, nobody knows where they are bound for, and the merchants declare them for Kuwait. This goes on just below the palace. The small boats then go to Matrah where the sailing boats usually lie up. From here they usually work up the Batinah coast, and then make a dash for the Makran side. With a favourable wind boats can cross in one night. Those who intend to land further down the M d&lt;ran Coast at Chahbar, etc., usually work down the Arab Coast to Sur and then bolt across. The gun merchants have to give a week ly return of arms they have received and sold to their respective Consulates. In these returns they show Afghans and Baluchis as Arabs. With reference to the trade in 1907-08 the Mr.sqat merchants say that the Af ghans bought about Rs. 9,00,000 of rifles and ammunition, and they calculate the number of rifles bought by Afghans and frontier Pathans at 30,000. The Customs people also put down the num ber at this. Hire of boats. Falsification of returns The 1907-08 trade-63 Change of venue from Jashk to Chahbar- This is only for the direct Afghans trade, and does not include the rifles brought by Baluchis and afterwards sold to Afghans. After the capture of the second dhow the Afghans began to get nervous of the Batinah-Jashk crossing, also Bandar Abbas, and Jashk were in a disturbed state owing to the Persian revolution. These facts decided the Afghans to change the venue of their operations to Chahbar. Nearly all the business that is now going on is based on this place. Facilities for buying on Makran coast. Towards the end of April the Sultan of Masqat also issued an order to the gun merchants that they were to discourage the Afghans from coming to Masqat, but that in future they should arrange to send their rifles to the Makran Coast for sale. * April 1909. This is now being done. The gun mer chants—especially Ali Musa, Harun and Saivid Yusuf—are sending their agents across to the Makran Co£&gt;st with rifles for sale. They have to come to an arrangement with the local Baluch Hakims or Sardars before they can do this. In some cases the Afghans are entrusting their money to Baluchis, working through the Hakims, and these Baluchis cross over to Masqat and purchase for the Afghans there. In some cases Baluch capitalists buy for themselves at Masqat and retail to Afghans on the Makran Coast. Bifles are naturally more expensive on the Makran Coast, and a Martini-Henry which is priced Bs. 40 at Masqat will fetch Bs. 60 on this side. Saravan, Sarbaz, Dizak, Dashtiari are becoming centres for the sale of rifles. Our men think that there are still* a good many Afghans hanging about the Makran Coast near Chahbar. They will buy rifles bv one of the above-mentioned methods, and they will store them locally until next caravan season. Thev have heard of rifles being thus stored with Khalifa Kb air Muhammad at Karvan and with Mahmud Khan of Dashtiari.64 Rifles being sent to Makran Coast for sale. On the 13tb April Mahmud Khan, Hakim of Dashtiari, sent over six Baluchis to Mas qat to inform the merchants that a party of 30 Afghans were with him, and asking them to send over 1,000 rifles. The Arab merchants, Harun and Muham mad Abdulla Katuri, were making arrange ments to send the rifles over in charge of one of their agents.

(1) Muhammad Bahim, Khoja of Gwa dar, owns many “ bagalas ” (boats) at Jashk, Chahbar and Pasni. He brings ghi, matting, dates and cotton to Matrah. These he sells to Saiyid Yusuf and Damodar Mul, and takes back rifles to the Makran Coast. ( 2 ) Abdur Rahim, Baluch Native Assist ant at Gwadar, takes an interest in the arms trade and makes what he can out of it. Haji Najaf of Bushire does a large trade in rifles apparently with Persians. He used to buy his rifles from Ali Musa, but he now has his own agent at Masqat who orders direct from Europe. From Mas qat his rifles are first shipped to Kuwait, and are then taken over to Bushire. These are not landed actually on the peninsula, but at various small ports on the coast of Tangistan. Shaikh Khazal of Muhammareh, about 8 months ago, sent a large tent, a jewel stud ded sword and two horses as presents to the Sultan of Masqat. He asked that a free trade in arms might be allowed between the two countries. Shaikh Mukaddam of Dibai has also approached the Sultan of Masqat in the same sense. French — Goguyer. Baijeot. M.

These were some of the men who came over to Masqat, but in addition to them the rifles also belonged to the follow ing men who remained on the Persian coast:—Mauladad, Musa, Paigor, Afzal Khan, and Abdul Karim. Whenever Baluch Sardars cross to Masqat they are well entertained by the Sultan, and on their departure he usually gives each of them a good rifle as a personal present and a cheap rifle to each of their servants. When Barkat Khan came over in March the Sultan gave him 6 Martini- Henry rifles. The Sultan wishes to en courage the Sardars who help the Afghan gun merchants. At Sur, the port on the Arab Coast below Masqat, a very large type of lagala is kept. The owners of these mainly trade in dates and dr ed fish from Masqat and rice from Bombay. Their boats can carry 3,000 sacks as cargo. Many of these men sell a portion of their cargo at Masqat and buy rifles, which they take over to the African coast. Our men heard that they trade with Zanzibar and the Somali coast and also with the Yaman. When in fear of being searched they fly the French flag. At Masqat they generally deal with Jai Ram, bunia, who is one of Damodar’s agents. The Arab trade was very slack at this time of year. Only a few individuals were coming into Masqat and taking off 2 or 3 rifles. The Arab trade is brisk during the date season. They appa rently make their livelihood out of dates, and at this time of year they come in large numbers by sea with boat loads of dates. They dispose of these and buy rifles. They take away rifles openly from Masqat. They mostly go to Kuwait or Dibai, and from there the rifles are sold into the interior; a good many also find their way over to Persia. Our men believe that the Arab trade is bigger than68 the Afghan trade. The Arabs do not take any rifles away overland. The immedi ate hinterland of Masqat appears to be a dangerous neighbourhood, and they are afraid of being looted. As mentioned under “ African trade ” the people of Sur do most of the trade with the Southern Arabian ports. In this direction, too, there is little trade until July and August. The favourite rifle with the Arabs is a short M.-H. rifle (or carbine), in which the wood does not come to the end of the barrel. These rifles are priced at Rs. 22 with 100 cartridges. It is not a good rifle. A similar rifle to the above with regard to length and make, is the Martini-Metford, priced at Rs. 40. This is also a favourite with the Arabs. A large share of the Arab trade falls to Damodar Mul. About 8 months ago Habib-bin-Salin, an Arab, brought some German tele phones and lamps valued at Rs. 30,000 as presents to the Sultm of Masqat. He was expected at Masqat again on 25th April with a motor car and motor boat which are believed to be presents from Germany. He is coming from Mom basa in the Sultan’s yacht “Nur-ul-Bahar.” About 40 yeais ago Habib lived at Masqat^ The merchants there say that he is a poor man, and that he could never afford to give presents on this scale, and they think that Germany is trying to get round the Sultan of Masqat, in order to increase her influence and obtain a Consulate there. Our men think that the Masqat mer chants and the Baluchis will be busy sending across rifles to the Makran Coast all this summer. There are also still a considerable number of Afghans hanging about the Gulf, and they will certainly try to make their purchases early. They will store their rifles with Baluch Sardars along the Makran coast until the next caravan season, while the Masqat mer chants and Baluchis will .collect rifles on * Suspected German enterprise- Plans for next season. This is confirmed by our other reports which all predict a busy hot weather and an early season.69 This year’s trade, 1908-09- Correction- Suggestions. that coast ready for the Afghan rush in the autumn. At the present moment the greatest activity seems to be in the vicinity of Chahbar, but this is liable to be changed according to circumstances. ('When the first party of our men went to the Gulf early in December, Gabiig and other landing places, east of Jasbk, were popular. Possibly, owing to the watch fulness of our gun-boats, this was chang ed to Bunji and other places, west of Jashk, in February and March. Then, owing to Persian disturbances and the capture of two dhows, the popular centre was shift ed to Chahbar in April.) It certainly appears that much fewer Afghans will personally purchase in Mas qat during the next season. The Sultan’s order regarding this has already been mentioned, and it appears that he is a little nervous of being called to book. When he heard that Major Cox was coming to Masqat he went off to Sib, possibly to avoid meeting him. See lists marked A, B, C, D, which give the consignments personally seen or heard of by our agents. They represent, of course, only a fraction of the whole trade. These give the following totals :—- (а) For shipments from Masqat in time to join the big caravan of March 1909-- Shipped by Pathans—4,236 rifles. Shipped by Baluchis—871 = 5,107 (б) For shipments from Masqat too late for the big caravan— Shipped by Pathans—1,500 Shipped by Baluchis—4,745=? 6,245 11,352 Nearly all the Pathans who proceeded to the Gulf to purchase rifles pass them selves off as pilgrims going to Baghdad and Karbala. Our men think that it would be an excellent measure to insist on all Pathans travelling to the Gulf being provided with a Raldari (passport or certificate of iden- tincation) without which they would not be allowed to purchase steamer tickets. This would certainly have an excellent effect on men of our politically controlled 14 I.B.tribes, whom we may expect to see going to the Gulf in increasing numbers every year. It would also be a deterrent to the Afghans, if the difficulty as to who should be the issuing authority can be overcome. Like the first two men we sent out these men lay great stress on the laxity of the Custom's inspection of passengers returning to Karachi. A very casual examination of kit is performed, but there is no search of the person. One of our men brought over a Browning pistol which he smuggled through without the least difficulty. In the first part of the report mention is made of the smug gling over of pistols, especially Mausers, and, bearing in mind the voluminous nether garments worn by the Pathan and Baluch, it will readily be seen that their carrying—and concealing—capacity is great.

In September, 1908 , an attempt was made to compile, from such official information as was available, a statement regarding the proportions assumed during recent years by the Masqat arms traffic. This pamphlet brings the statistics then given down to the latest available date. At the same time it may be mentioned that separate confidential investigations which have been carried out by the Intelligence Branch of this Division during the arms season of 1908-09 would seem to make it clear that more arms and ammunition than appear in the returns officially supplied are actually imported into Masqat, and that, in con sequence, the trade is of even more serious proportions than is shown in these returns. The situation was considered by the Government of India in the autumn of last year. Proposals to check the traffic by means of a cordon of British troops aligned across the direction taken by the arms caravans, i. e. along the western portion of the Nushki-Robat route and so on into Persian territory, were rejected as impracticable from the military and undesirable from the political point of view. Similarly a suggestion to station British troops during^ the arms season along the coast of Persian Makran was dismissed. The opinion was expressed that perhaps the best hope of checking the trade was by means of increased naval activity in the Gulf of Oman, a scheme which would have involved a considerable increase in the number of ships on the station. This was also rejected on financial and other grounds. It is this scheme, however, which has again been put forward by the new Naval Commander-in-Chief after a consideration of the position. A new feature in the traffic, however, has to be taken into account in this connection. Confidential information recently obtained seems to indicate that the gun running may in the near future be spread over the whole year instead of taking place chiefly in the months January-April. The matter is being further investigated, but it seems that at the present time numerous small consignments of arms are constantly being sent across to the Makran coast, where they are taken charge of by the Baluch sirdars interested in the traffic and stored in safe custody pending the ^ arrival of the Afghan caravans during the cold weather months. If this be so it is obvious that naval precautions, to be efficient, would have to be carried out throughout the year. It will be noted that the statistics given in the appendices are very incom plete. For our main facts we must rely on the actual arrivals at Masqat, which are summarised on pages 1 and 2 . As regards the destination of arms subse quently reported from Masqat the official information is frequently very vague, e.g.) we are told that a boom, laden with arms and ammunition has left Masqat. This may mean anything from a dozen to several hundreds of rifles, and similarly with ammunition. It is hoped that in future improved arrangements may possibly result in more accurate intelligence. W. MALLESON, Colonel, Division of the Chief of the Staff . Simla ; yth July iqoq.* i It is not necessary to rewrite the poliiical aspects, and the past history of the Arms Trade in the Persian Gulf. This has been fully and completely discussed by Mr. Lorimer in his memorandum on “ The Arms and Ammunition Traffic in the Gulfs of Persia and Oman ”, The various Appendices herein, however, deal with the history of the trade in detail during the past three years. 2 . The trade during the last few years has increased enormously, having nearly* quadrupled itself. The Consular Trade Report for Masqat for 1905-06 gives the total value of the arms trade as Rs. 1 , 074,380 and that of 1907-08 as Rs. 4 , 185,390 (vide Appendix IV). 3 . The fact is also apparent that the coming of the Hamburg American steamers to the Gulf has given an immense impetus to this trade on the Conti nent, and that a large proportion of the trade is falling into the hands of non-English manufacturers. (For details vide Appendix V.) 4 . During the last two years attempts have been made to stop the import of arms into Persia, but with comparatively small results. A couple of dhows were captured by the Navy, and one or two small shiploads thrown overboard by dhows when chased in 1908 , but in March 1909 two dhows with 1,550 rifles and 170000 rounds on board were seized on the high seas. What little success there has’ been is due to the efforts of Mr. New of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, who has instituted a system of guards along the Makran coast to watch the gun-runners. A short resume of the scheme wdl be found in Appendix I. 5 . The Persians were also induced to make an attempt to stop the caravans between the coast and the Afghan Border, but the results effected were ml. _ A history of the action taken will be found in Appendix III. Appendix II contains all particulars available regarding the caravans, and the routes followed by them. 6 The double company at Robat was in 1908 increased by_ 500 men whilst the caravans were on the move, and the Jashk detachment was reinforced by 200 men owing to rumours that the gun-runners intended to avenge themselves on the posts for injuries and losses sustained at the hands of the - avy urmg a year and at the hands of the Robat detachment during the previous one the garrisons at Robat and Jashk remained at 200 and too men respectively during the 1908-09 season. 7 . To sum up : the traffic has increased to an enormous extent during the past three years, and all steps taken materially to interfere with it ave prove in^ ec tual. The Navy appear to admit that they are practically powedess t^o accomplish much with the means at their disposal, the Persians have ^ r °yu- ^ infprfpro helpless, the detachment at Robat has shown that it can do nothing to intertere with the progress of the caravans, whilst the proceedings at the Brussels Arm Conference have not as yet afforded any hope of a satisfactory se emen 8 .

There is very little information as regards ammunition but latest reports tend to show that about 200 rounds on the average are sold with each nfle purchased in Masqat, we have had no estimates of recent years as to the numbers of rifles imported into the Masqat hinterland. 9 . Appendix IX shows the various species of rifles and ammunition imported into Masqat and the Gulf. The Martini-Henry shows a constant percentage of t Working on Such statistics as are available the propo tion of cases of rifles to cases of ammunition is I to't The average number of rifles per case is at least 25 . and of cartridges per case of ammunition 2,0 &lt;0 rounds.

With all the better quality rifles 400 rounds are now given.4 r&gt; O over 75 per cent during the last three years. However, it must be recollected that probably the greater proportion of the small bores imported come from the continent and are not included in the data for the figures given in the Appendix, not being available. A considerable number of ‘303 rifles, and a large amount of the *303 ammunition have in the past been absorbed by the Persian 'Province of Pars, vide this Division’s report on the subject of the distribution of arms in Southern Persia. But the tendency now is for all the better quality rifles to go to Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier, where, especially, there is a strong demand for *303 arms. 10 . A list of the firms connected with the arms traffic into Masqat is to be found in Appendix VIII. It will be noted that the numbers shown in that state ment only represent a small proportion of the arms and ammunition actually imported into Masqat, when compared with the tables on pages 1 and 2 . The latter numbers are obtained from cases, etc., reported as landed in Masqat; while the former is a record of statistics—admittedly incomplete—furnished by the Customs authorities at various English ports, and, in rare instances, by consular agents at Antwerp and elsewhere on the continent, reporting shipments of arms and ammunition destined for Masqat. The principal exporters of rifles during this and last year have been— Laubenherg &amp; Co. ... ... ... Birmingham. Livingstone, Zeytoon &amp; Co. ... ... Manchester. S. K. R. Cama &amp; Co. ... ... ... London. The principal exporters of ammunition have been— Haji Ali Akbar &amp; Son E. W. Carling &amp; Co. Livingstone, Zeytoon &amp; Co Langstaff, Ehrenberg &amp; Poliak... The principal importers of rifles have been^— Ali Khan bin Musa Khan. A. Goguyer. Purshotum Dhunji. Mirza Muhammad. The principal importers of ammunition have been— Padumsi Mulji. M. Husain. Manchester. London. Manchester. Liverpool. Ali Khan bin Musa Khan. A. Goguyer. 11 . Attention must be directed to the discrepancy existing between the value of British arms and ammunition trade into Masqat between 1 st April 190 ; and 1 st April 1908 as given by the Masqat Consular Trade Report, and as obtained from the Shipping Returns. The former shows the value of the trade at Rs. 1 , 521,480 and the latter at Rs. 1 , 067,298 a difference of Rs. 454 , 182 . Less than Rs. 100,000 of this difference is accounted for by the fact that some of the ships had sailed from England during the previous year, and that some had sailed from England before the ist April 1908 and had not reached Masqat in time to be included in the Trade Report.4 APPENDIX I.

Chahbar. These are pOSt- Nr'^!! edon the principal roads at March i9°8. points about miles trom the coast, while the remainder patrol in the vicinity of the tele graph line and along the coast. ( 2 I Telephone stations have been established along the telegraph line at ' Arduri (24 miles from Jashk), Gabng (40 miles from Jashk), Sadaich (62 miles from Jashk), Surug (80 miles from Jashk), Rapch (100 miles from .Jashk and Chahbar), Bandam (80 miles from Chah bar) Bir (60 miles from Chahbar), Kair (50 miles from^ Chahbar), Sirgan (25 miles from Chahbar), and Rod! (30 miles east of Chahbar). The line guards in charge of these stations watch the country along the telegraph line. (t) News of intended landings of arms obtained by any of the patrols is immediately sent in to the nearest telephone station and transmit ted to Jashk or Chahbar. It is then forwarded on to His Majesty s ships and to the Political Agent at Masqat. ( 4 ) Arrangements have been made with a few trustworthy Baluchis at various points above the telegraph line to impart information, for wViirk tkev are rewarded. (s) The Telegraph Officers in charge at Jashk and Chahbar have been supplied with maps showing rivers, hills, villages, roads from up country, and telephone stations, with full particulars of the scheme to guide them in transmitting information received from the line.

One of these is always at Jashk or Chahbar and instead of, as formerly, ineffectually cruising off the coast, now relies wholly on the information supplied by the patrols before running out.. It will be seen from the events of this year that these arrangements have met with some small measure of success. It is hoped at any rate that they will act as a deterrent to arms traffic between Masqat and the Makran coast which up to the time of their institution has been carried on practically with impunity.5 APPENDIX II. ^ List of the arms caravans known to have made their way from the Makran Coast into Afghan territory during the years / 907 , 1908 and 1909 giving the routes followed by them. (Based on official reports only.) 1. An arms caravan of 150 camels travelled in March 1907 by the following route : — Bazman. Pan sura. Hanjira. Ab-i-Rais. Shuru. Mazarab. Nakbilat. Kal Amas. Ab-i-Khara, Chah-Duzak. Chah-i-Mastan. Kusagu. Chah-i-Kaftargu. Chah-i-Butago. Safidava. Chah Nafar. Bal-i-Kumab. Chakau Spr. Lash Juwain. From Bazman to Gurg this route lies in the Kirman desert and seems to be little known. From Gurg it follows the caravan road to Neh. It then turns east across the Palangan Kuh range. The Bandan-Baring road is crossed on the Kain border neat Hauz. 2. A caravan of about 200 camels with 80 men, in spite of an attempt to intercept it in the Kacha Gorge being made by the Chagai levies succeeded in reaching the Helmand in March 1907. They took the following route Bazman. Pansura. Shurab. Murghak. Padai. Kaleh-i-Bid. Chaunali (?). Dukduh. Katar Kanjak. Kharnai. Manzilab. Siah Karai. Ab-i-Ahuao, Kacha. Zireh. Helmand. q. On the ^oth March 1907 an arms caravan which was following^ caravan No. 2 above mentioned, was ambushed by the Robat and Saindak levies in the Kacha Gorge and captured.The capture proved to consist of nearly 800 rifles and 70,000 rounds of 4. A caravan of 200 camels received news of the Kacha capture at Bazman and being bound for Kandahar proceeded as under in May 1907 Bazman. Din. Shurab, Dig*i-Shikan. Chah Ghabi. Khwash (Vasht). Dehan-i-Gazu. Rig-i-Malik. Juzhak. Lut of Zeh. Zalu Chah. Chah Azam Khan. Hasan Khan of Khwash is reported to have taken 60 rifles and $ pistols from this caravan, while Mir Jiand furnished guides, no doubt for a consideration. 1 - This was a caravan of 30 camels for Herat, It travelled with caravan No 4 as far as Bazman and then followed the same route as caravan No. 1 as far as Ab-i-Khara on the Nasratabad-Neh track. From this point it turned south east to Turshab, apparently with the idea of crossing the frontier near Bandar-i- Kamal Khan; becoming aware of the presence of a force of Sistanis at ^ Baluch Ab, a very short distance off, it turned from its line, and making north, joined the route followed by caravan No. 1 at Safidava. 6 . A caravan consisting of 1 20 camels with 50 men made its way through into Afghanistan in April 1908 and took the following route :— Narmashir. Mazarab. Darshur. Panj Angusht. Baluch Ab. Jam. Shila. Helmand (S. bank). Khwajeh Ali. Girishk. Kandahar. 7 . An arms caravan consisting of about 80 camels with 50 men attempted to cross a corner of British Baluchistan in May. It started from Dashtiari and proceeded via Dizak. Kuh-i-Safid. Talab River. Juzhak (S. of Amalaf). Meeting however at this point the reinforcement proceeding to Robat under Colonel Fowler and being turned back by them it escaped with all rapidity from such a dangerous vicinity and doubling Robat proceeded via :— Mirjawa. Ladis. Dizak. Galugheh. Dumagh. '• - f Baluch Ab (Pain). ‘fDak-i-Dila (on the Helmand). 8 . The main Afghan Arms caravan consisting of some 1,500 camels with about 1,200 men and carrying about 30,000 rides and 2 million rounds of ammunition, most of which had been landed in the vicinity of Jashk, started from the coast at the beginning of May 1908 and proceeding by two routes one being via \— pistols ration, aravan as far sootli- idar-i- lalucli ed the roagl Angushki, Sirik, Taling, Jaghin, Manujan, and the other by— Jaghdan, Anguran, assembled at Chah-i-Malik 10 miles south-east of Rigan on the 22 nd May. On the 26 th May it was attacked at Dashtak by 50 Persians under Shaukat-ul- Mamalik but after a skirmish proceeded unharmed to Garagheh via :— Shuru, Mazarab, Gurg, Nasratabad Sipi. npted •i and inder from , At Garagheh the caravan split up into two parties in order to facilitate the march through the difficult country between that place and the Helmand. 1 he river was reached by one party on the gth June via :— Tappeh-i-Khak-i-Darvish. Rigavak. Dak-i*Dila. And by the other party on the 1 ith June via :■=- Baluch Ab (Pain). Shila. Dasht-i-Tarakhun. Bandar-i-Kamal Khan. It was reported later that the Dak-i Dila party marched for Herat and the Bandar-i-Kamal Khan party for Ghazni. 9 . A small caravan headed by one Jodha a Kubdani crossed, in May 1908 , a corner of Baluchistan into Afghanistan. From jalk he appears to have taken the following route Talab River. Talab Spr. Nodu. Borghar where he crossed the trade route. Parana Koh. Zireh.r i 10. About August a caravan was reported to be proceeding via ^ Bampur and Baluch Ab to the Helmand. There seems some doubt about it as it w r as an unlikely time of year. 11. A. S. A. caravan of 6 men and 4 camels was captured by Chagai levies nearMashki Chah on October 14th 1908, after a fight. 12. The following arms caravans reached Bandar-i-Kamal Khan during 1908-09 season. Camels. Men. Leader. Arms bought in. 20 15 Lai Muhammad Sarhad. 34 26 D i n Muhammad Karoti. Persian Baluchistan 400 200 Mohim Khan, Barakzai Masqat. 30 24 Saiyid Khan Bampur. 12 6 Khalifa 70 24 N izam-ud-Din, Popalzai, Masqat. Most of these passed North of Kuh-i-Malik Siah and South of Sistan. 18. A caravan of 250 men and 750-1,000 camels passed through Aliabad earlv in May, and reached Barah on May 26th. £r,APPENDIX III. A precis of the action taken by the Persian Government to suppress the running of arms caravans through South-East Persia in igo8 and igog. Although the Persian Government gave certain assurances as to the measures it proposed to take for the suppression of illicit arms traffic and issued orders to the local administrations of Provinces through which the caravans of arms traders would pass, no practical result ensued. The sum-total of effort, however, consisted of certain half-hearted and isolated attempts to intercept arms caravans on their way from the Makran Coast to the Afghan border. The first attempt was made near Rigan where a large caravan of about 750 Telegram from Mr. James, telegraphist at Bam, and ? ver ' &gt;°°° Cfmels had assembled, to the Agent to the Governor-General, Baiuchistah, Under orders of the Bam authorities Shau- 20th to 28th May 1908. kat-ul-Mamalik with 50 men attacked this caravan at Dashtak on the 26 th May, but his force being insufficient he retired after a skirmish and the Afghans proceeded on their way unharmed. On the same date a force of 400 men under Rifat Nizam left Bam with the avowed intention of attacking and capturing the above-mentioned caravan, but were, of course, too late and never came up with it. Rifat Nizam on reaching Fahreh disbanded his troops and returned to Bam. Peremptory orders were also issued to the Deputy Governor of Sistan Telegram from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul 3.nd Kain to Send Out troops tO intercept for Sistan and Kain to the Foriegn Department. Slich arms Caravans aS attempted tO paSS through their territories, but no expenditure was sanctioned or organised arrange ments made for supplies. Sardar Purdil Khan was put in charge of the operations in Sistan. He succeed in assembling about 200 sarbazes Sistan Diary No. 16 of Apni 1908 . ^ oQ gj stan i sowars and placing his main body at Turshab, sent spies down the various roads by which caravans might approach. About 5 ® men also were collected at Varmal but little was expected of them. It was reported, moreover, that out of Chagai Diary No. 21 of July 1908. these numbers only about a hundred were armed with rifles, On the 18 th May Purdil Khan hearing of the advance of an arms caravan made dispositions to cut it off and moved out towards Baluch AK This caravan (No 7 ) was the one that had essayed to cross a corner of British Baluchistan v * 7 but had been turned back at Juzhakbya Col'l^t'h fo °“'„f C M 0 a7'o8: ng the Rob “ detachment of Colonel Fowler’s force pro- Sistan Diary No. 24 of July 1908 and Chagai ceeding from Quetta tO Robat. it COnSlSt- Diary No, 22 Of July 1908. e d of about 50 men and 80 camels. Soon after passing Baluch Ab it came into collision with the Sistani force. As was to be expected the latter did not show up well. Apparently the men took good care to kept out of danger with the result that the loss they inflicted was mi and the caravan escaped with ease. After this fruitless effort Purdil Khan and his men returned to Lutak. No resistance Sistan Diary No. 25. of July 1908. wag 0 ff ere ^ to t h e ma in caravan which passed through shortly afterwards, beyond the capture and decapitation of two Afghan stragglers, who were found asleep, Purdil Khan contending that as the attempt to capture the smaller caravan had been a failure, there was still less chance of succes with the larger one, and his force might as well be withdrawn. Certain inadequate arrangements were, at the same time, under the orders of the Governor-General of Khorasan, made by the Shaukat-ul-Mulk, the Deputy Governor of Kain, for dealing with Afghan arms caravans that might pass through his Province.10 Muhammad Yusuf Khan was put in charge of a force of about 800 men sistan Diaries No. 4 of May loos and No. 24 of with his head-quarters at liandan. Doubt- June 1908 • less the Shaukat-ul-Mulk did his best, but the bulk of these troops were armed with obsolete weapons and could not be expected to effect anything against strong parties of well-armed Afghans. It was a cause of much relief to the Shaukat-ul-Mulk that all the Afghan caravans made their way through Sistan and that he was not called upon to oppose them. To sum up; although ample warning had been given to the Persian Government of the march of Afghan arms traders through south-eastern Persia and full information of the movements of the various caravans communicated to the local authorities, not a single one of these caravans was intercepted or so much as turned from its way: all that had been done was to incense Afghan feeling against the Persians by the latter’s attempt to interfere with the caravans and by the murder of the Afghan stragglers. The arms smuggling traffic has now almost assumed the character of an armed invasion of Persia, and as the Persian Government would appear to be totally incapable of protecting its frontiers, it seems that once the arms have been safely landed on the Persian coast there is little or no further impediment to be feared by the caravans. During the 1908-09 season the Persian authorities took no steps to stop the tralhc in arms through their territory. 1 Capture of Dhom in Persian Gulf by H. M. S. Fox in March 1909. On March 7, H. M.

They were only allowed to purchase three rifles :— (2) Kassim, Sunjee and Washu, residents of Old Jask, were not allowed to land and proceeded to Karachi. (3) Nakhoda Kadir Bux was this time made to return to Khonarak without arms. (4) Nakhoda Saul Muhammad of Mutrah, who was on the point of leaving for Mekran with 170 rifles, has now been prohibited to carry arms to Mekran by the owner of the boat, a British Indian subject. 3. I have freely discussed with His Highness the Sultan all the above mentioned cases. The Sultan, as you are aware, agreed with my predecessor in * 1907, to prohibit his Arab arms • Secret e. 3 April nos, Nos. 428-451. tr ad e rs selling arms, etc., to Afghans. This prohibition has been of little practical value, Ali Moosa and others have carried on their trade without any check or punishment. The Sultan is averse to being pressed seriously on this matter. His private interests coincide too closely with those of these traders and therefore he is unwilling to take active steps to thwart them. 4. Since July, the Baluch trade in arms has not been on an extensive rr ri ^ scale (about 1,000 rifles have been landed). The date harvest in Mekran is over. The Bazaars in Mutrah and Muscat are now becoming crowded with Mekranis and the trade will become brisker This trade is carried on mostly by small local Mekram traders. This class is without capital and is not in a position to suffer any serious loss. A closer watch will also have to be kept this year on the better class of Baluchis. The Afghans are beginning to use them as their go- betweens in Muscat I am personally acquainted with most of the Sirdars and headmen of the Mekran Coast and will be able to keep a watch on them. A capture of one or two of these small consignments would have a very good effect. To collect reliable news is hard, but it is still harder when one has the nevrs not to be able to make any use of it owing to the absence of a gunboat or any other means such as a steam launch. 5. A few small parties of Afghans are already reported to have arrived on Afghan Trade. the Mekran Coast. Aii Moosa (the well known gun merchant in Muscat) is reported to have lately received a letter, the purport of which is that he is shortly to expect the arrival of about 50 Afghans at Galeg. There is, I am afraid, no reason at present to suppose that the o Afghan trade will be less keen this season. On the other hand, a brisker trade may well be anticipated as in every probability the distant tribes lately engaged on the North-West Frontier may attempt to improve their arms. The Afghans are also beginning to purchase a better class of rifle which enhances the value of this trade to the local dealers in arms. 6. At the present time Persian Authority in Persian Baluchistan is non existent. Mir Bairam Khan of Sarbaz is reported to have surrounded the Fort of Fahraj (Bampur) and to have seized some of the surrounding villages. There appears to be no local Governor at Bampur. If serious steps are to he taken this season to try and prevent the Afghan trade, I would like to urge the advantages of making the attempt on the Persian Mekran Coast which is in our sphere of influence. This would remove the scene of operations 18away from ihe Afghan Frontier. Action along the Mekran Coast has the certain following advantages, in addition to the support of the Navy, over action m the interior :— J (1) Good telephonic communication all along the Coast between Jask and Chahbar. (2) The tracks leading from one small harbour to the next run parallel to and are close to the Coast line. Thus the question of transport for stores, etc., is greatly simplified. (3) The Country is level and going good, except after heavy rains. (4) The local people are, I know, more friendly disposed than those of the interior. 7. I do not propose in this letter to deal with the extensive trade in arms with Koweit and the other parts of Arabia, This trade appears at present to be in a a fluctuating stage. The meeting of the Conference had a retarding influence, but as soon as the news arrived that no agreement had been come to, extensive orders to Europe for fresh supplies were sent. The recent rumour that Basreh is to be an open port is creating a great stir in the local Market, as this would mean that the more extensive and profitable part of the trade would desert Maskat for Basreh. 8.

When this post is finished, it would be as well to complete the line of frontier posts by building two others, viz., one at Piran and one at Juzhak. Doing so would effectively block this section of the frontier and render the passage of any arms caravan a matter of very great difficulty. Leading down near Chah Muhammad Raza there is a foot-path which is used by donkey caravans wishing to escape observation. A small blockhouse near the crest of the hills manned by a few khassadars would effectively mask this. 5. A small dealer, named Yakub Khan, who recently arrived in Nushki from Garmsel, states that a very large caravan has left Farrah for Nushki.

Unless, owing to simultaneous deve lopment of situation north of Persia, the principle of non-intervention is to be mutually abandoned by ourselves and Russia, the policy of the British Govern, ment will presumably not admit of our putting troops into Persian territory except so far as is necessary for protection of lives of British subjects. His Majesty’s Government will in any case hardly entertain proposal if it is probable that result of Brussels Conference will shortly enable us to stop import to Maskat. I have no information on the latter point, but I understand that Conference re-assembles in a few days. If therefore its results are at all likely ^ to be speedy and favourable, I recommends suspension of preventive operations until they are known. Meanwhile it seems unlikely that small parties of Afghans will make unnecessary difficulty for themselves by inter ference with the telegraph line or officials on their downward journey unless we show renewed activity, so that safety of coastal telegraph line and officials should be assured, if present arrangements as regard Jask, Charbar, and New are maintained and one guardship is kept on coast to watch position. As regards Central Persia line; if Legation cannot induce Central Govern ment to provide security for employes and stations we must do it to the extent which the department demonstrates to be necessary. 2. If, on the other hand, results of Brussels Conference are likely to be long delayed or unfavourable and if His Majesty's Government nevertheless con tinues to object to intervention inland then the only course is for us to make our preventive arrangements by sea more effective. Existing resources are quite inadequate for this purpose. One of subsidised ships is on deputation in the Shatt-uI-Arab and will probably not be available till end of January 1909. The other two cannot communicate by wireless telegraphy and are not suffi cient for arms work alone, apart from other Gulf requirements. At least three ships would be necessary for Mekran and, I suggest, subject to views of Commander-in-Chief, if latter alternative is decidid on, that in addition to provision of one or preferably two more of our ships, Persian Government should be pressed to place at our disposal three or more of their launches; these being manned and commissioned by us and used by His Mejesty's ships as tenders.

Mr. J. A, Pease. —The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. As regards the second part, representations were made at the time to the Persian Government, and His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran reported that the Persian local authorities did their best to comply with the orders sent from the Central Government and to check the progress of the caravans.

Since I despatched my telegram No. 674 of 12th instant I have heard informally from Major Grey that it is unlikely that ; e conference will reassemble before next February, but that there is probability of favourable results. I have now bad consultation with Commanders of Perseus and Sphinx and with Messrs. Holland and New. We are unanimously agreed that the continuance of measures for suppressing traffic with present resources is useless. It is now for Government to decide whether they aie m a position to make measures effective, either by placing a land cordon along nearly 400 miles of coast from ( ? Bander Abbas) to Gwetter Bay, m conjunction with the patrolling of the coast by His Majesty’s ships, or, if land cordon is politicallv P out of the question, then by effective blockade by ships alone. It is estimated that in the former case, two regiments will be necessary and three shins all three possessing wireless telegraphic installations and search nLX cafe five ships all similar.y equipped be n ary&gt; and they cWmlrl he assisted by Persian launches if possible. II neither ot these alternatives is feasible, we recommend that pending the result ot conference, “revenue measures should cease entirely.

Extract from Diary No. 40 of Major P. C JPrbb-Warr, I.A., C.I.E., Political Agent, Chagai, for the, week ending the 31st October 1908. ■With referenceto paragraphs 12 and 3 in Diaries Nos. 34 and 36 for the weeks ending the 16th and 30th September, respectively, the Deputy Commissioner, Quetta-Peshin, writes that he has received information through the Native Assistant, Chaman, that, on or about the 16th October, 100 Afghans with fifty camels left Panjwai near Kandahar for Garmsel and tbe Gulf to brin 0, up rifles, and be adds tbat another and much larger caravan was preparing to leave shortly afterwards. The Consuls, Seistan and Kerman, have been informed and intimation has been sent to the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs. The various levy posts have been warned to keep a vigilant look-out, steps are being taken to obtain early information of tbe^ arrival of these caravans in Western Garmsel, and tbe Officer Commanding the Kobat Escort has been notified. During the last few weeks there has been a very marked increase in the number of rifles landed along the Gulf littoral, and it would appear as though the arrival of these Afghans is being expected. In the history of the arms trade this is the first occasion where Afghans have openly assembled near Kandahar and taken the Garmsel route down to the coast. This is of some significance, for it points to gun-running, which has hitherto been carried on more or less surreptitiously, having now become a recognised legitimate enter prise in which Nasirs can employ their camels with much advantange to them selves during the w inter trading season. It would appear that this traffic^ can only be suppressed in one of the following four methods, viz., by (a) international arrangement; (b) subsidising the Sultan of Maskat, etc.j (c) a system of gun-boats associated eaeh with its own launch patrols which would cover the entire Persian Mekran coast and would extend from Bandar Abbas to Gwatter ; (d) an arrange ment with the Persian authorities which might take the form ^either of permit ting small detachments of Indian troops to operate in Persian territory or, if this is considered inexpedient for political reasons, of permitting the raising in Persia of a force of Persian Baluch guards. The latter are good fighters, and if well trained and led should experience no great difficulty in giving an excellent account of these long unwieldy arms caravans as they struggle painfully across the desert and Dasht plains which lie on their road to the Helmand, As regards (a) and (6), these are without the province of a mere diary, but (&lt;?) is feasible and is the method which was employed successfully to put down slavery on the east coast of Africa. The hardships of boat service in the Gulf would naturally be considerable, but against this it is to he recollected that a dhow laden with rifles and ammunition is a prize of such high value that a few captures of this descrip- tic n would assuredly bring the wholesale trade in arms, on the scale it is conducted at present, to an end. The Arabs who run these cargoes across the Gulf so freely do so because the risk at present to life and property is almost infinitesimal and is amply covered by the profits realised by each successful run they make; but once let these conditions be reversed and the chances of capture be increased, it is then only a matter of time for the expenses to rise to a figure which will render the trade unremunerative. If we take the number of rifles which entered Afghanistan lastyear as being 25,000 and assuming that the importation remains at this figure, this would give an increase of not less than a quarter of a million rifles in Afghanis* tan in a period of ten years and would very materially enhance the difficulties on the North-West Frontier where it is that the best market for rifles is found. The Political Agent is perhaps more directly interested in the suppression of this traffic from the point of view of the Nushki-Seistan trade route. Posts which are strong enough to protect the trade route from thieves and ordinary raiding are not strong enough to prevent the passage of well-armed arms caravans, and as traders are timid of their goods suffering loss any fighting which may take place would tend to adversely affect the reputation of the route and so to frighten away trade. Extract from the Diary of Major F. C. Webb Ware, C.I.E., Folitical Agent, Chagai, No. 41, for the week ending the 8th (received on the 25th) Nov ember 1908. 7. From Shah Powlah Khan, the Political Agent has received some interesting items of information regarding the large arms caravan which passed along the Helmand a few months ago. It appears that the numbers which actually passed Landi Wali Muhammad were not less than 1,000 camels and that the arms which they carried were, for the major part, magazine rifles taking five to eleven cartridges. They had other arms as well, but better class rifles apparently predominated. Shah Dowlah Khan states that they disposed of about 300 rifles in Garmsel and that their destination was Ghazni. A certain number of cartridges were sold with each arm, and for the better class of magazine rifles they asked high prices as they said that they could get these prices further on. From the same authority, the Political Agent learnt that Muhammad Alam Khan, the gun-runner who ran five camel loads of rifles through from Kharan to Garmsel via the Kani route, vide diaries Nos. 25, 26 and 35 for the weeks ending the 8th and 16th July and 24th September, res pectively, emerged on the Helmand at Targaz, but hearing that Muhammad Umar was in the vicinity, and that as soon as he learned of his arrival he would certainly seize several rifles for himself, he at once loaded up his camels again and crossing the Helmand marched to Siahband, where he still is. Shah Dowlah Khan stated that the arms which Muhammad Alam Khan had with him were nearly all carbines, and from the description he gave they were apparently those known as Maskat Martini-Henry. He said that he knew Muhammad Alam Khan personally very well and that he was quite the most successful gun smuggler on the Helmand. The tactics he pursues is to take his arms to Kharan, where, thanks to his being Khuda Nazir’s agent (Khuda Nazir is Sardar Naoroz Khan’s brother-in-law), he was always well received, and when a favourable opportunity offered he ran them across the hills at night, and so on to the frontier.36 Telegram P., No. 710, dated the 3rd (received 4th) December 1908.

The man had two rifles with him one a ^ German made Martini-Henry (locally called Nawai) and another, a smalh barrelled breech-loader, locally called Sultani. He said that the rifles were given him to sell by one of the caravan men, who had brought the fire-arms from Maskat side last summer; that nobody was going to purchase them although the prices were much reduced. It is said that the gumrunnino- kafilas have been much discouraged this time. They could not dispose of their rifles as they expected. Those who went into the country to sell their lot also met with disappointment. The loss of 1,500 rifles that were captured in a dhow near Jask by His Majesty’s Ship Proserpine, the immediate despatch of troops to Robat to intercept the caravans who, though not intercepted and encountered, came, however, to know of the arrival ^ of troops, and their en counter with Persian detachments, specially their fight with the Persian cavalry at Rigan, aie facts which apparently add much to their discouragement From what I inferred from the short, but useful, conversation which I made at random and quite uninterestedly with that simple Pathan about the disappoint ment of the gun-runners in ^ disposing of their rifles which they bring at the risk oi rather joss of their lives, and from the other facts mentioned above, it can be hoped that the gun-runner Afghans will hesitate to start again or to start so soon again in large numbers on such expeditions, unless they receive a fresh and prompt encouragen ent from the Afghan Government.

In reply to your telegram, S.-690, of 27th ultimo, be pleased to acquaint His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council that at present I have three ships in the Persian Gulf and lam afraid I shall very soon be forced to withdraw one of them, the Perseus as her boilers will shortly requite considerable repair. Unless the Home Government release the Fox anti. Proserpine from the blockade of the VVarsangli Coast I shall have no vessel to replace the Perseus. The ships in the Persian Gulf will then be reduced to two. Should a vessel be required in the Shat-el-Arab until the end of January, as indicated by Major Cox, there would be only one ship available for the Mekran Coast and any other services required in the Gulf. 2. Should the Government of India require an effective blockade, I should require seven ships, five being always on the Mekran Coast, and in that case application would require to be made to the Home Government. 3. I am quite in accord with the employment of Persian launches if they are available, but I would remind the Indian Government that even after they are obtained, which would probably not be for some considerable time after negotiations with the Persian Government had begun, their engines would probably require some overhaul before they were fit for service. 4. On the question of employing more effective measures at once, or pursuing a policy of watching only in view of an early favourable result of the Brussels Conference, I feel sure that it is very well known both by the importers of arms and also by the Afghans that such a Conference is sitting. The Arms Traffic is probably receiving this season a renewed stimulus to activity, and unless the safety of the Telegraph officials and line demand a policy of non-intervention, I am of opinion that even with the small naval force available we should display as much activity as possible in checking the traffic.Telegram (P.), No. 341-C., dated the 17th (received 21st) December 1908.

Afghan caravans have commenced arms traffic operations, and present activity will probably be stimulated by anticipation of future restrictions as result of Arms Conference. The local officers despair of successful results with utterly inadequate forces at our disposal, and advocate effective naval blockade or military cordon along the Mekran coast or both. The finaneial and political objections to any great naval activity in and !far tne Gulf or to use of troops on Persian territory are strong. But, even if it did not prejudice our case at Arms Conference and our position towards the Persian Government,, inaction would certainly be misunderstood in Afghanistan and probably m Persia. We have some information that prices of arms have risen at coast owing to naval activity and increased risks last vear.

Afghan caravans have commenced operations and anticipation of future restrictions as result of Arms Conference will probably stimulate present activity. Local officers despair of successful results with totally inadequate forces at our disposal, and advocate military cordon along Mekran coast or effective naval blockade, or both. The political and financial objections to use of troops on Persian territory, or to any great na’val activity in and near Gulf, are strong. But inaction would certainly be misunderstood in Afghanistan, and probably in Persia, even if it did not prejudice our case at Arms Conference and our position towards Persian Government. We have some information that owing to naval activity and increased risk last year prices of arms have risen at coast. Simultaneously, increase m supply has lowered prices in Afghanistan and along the frontier. I he more the trade is harried the less profitable it will become. Moreover, inaction now will create greater difficulties later on. We have come to conclusion that naval activity should be continued with the force available, although only two ships will be available in the Gulf for all purposes until early in March, owing to “ Lapwing ” having been withdrawn to refit, and Admiral considers seven would be necessary for effective action. McMahon considers that telegraph employes on central line will be in danger of attack if we interfere with Afghans, and suggests withdrawal to Bam or Robat of staff stationed between those places and temporary retention of ordinary garrison at Robat We consider that telegraph staff should certainly not be withdrawn, and urge that Persian Government should take steps to protect them against all risks. Present force should be kept temporarily at Robat. We gather from Cox that with operations on the scale contemplated there is no risk to telegraph staff along coast. If necessary we can arrange reinforcement.

Since despatch of my telegram No. 674 of the 12th November, I have heard informally from Major Grey that 0onference is unlikely to reassernble before February but that tnere seeifis likelihood of favourable result. I have had consultation with Coimanders of n Perseus ' and 'Sphinx', Holland and New. We are unanimous in thinking that continuance of measures with present resources is useless. Government have nov) to decide whether they are in a position to make measures effective either by placing land cordon along nearly 400 miles of coast from Bunder Abbas to Gwettur, in conjunction with patrolling of coast by H*M.Ships, or, if land cordon is impossible, then by effective blockade by Ships alone. In the former case it is estimated that two regiments would be needed and three ships all possessing searchlight and wireless installations. In the latter case five ships similarly equipped and assisted by Persian launches would be required. If neither of these alternatives are feasible then io e re comm end enti re c ess at ion of preventive action pending the result of the Conference. Pending decision of Government on above points, I have asked S.N.O. to keep one ship for guard duty off Jask and Chart®, r as may be necessary, but to suspend all action against dhows.

Trey concurs in theterms of the draft of the telegram which Viscount Porley proposes to address to the T-overnmtnt of India in regard to the matter. Your most ohediert, humble Servant A n/ i I The Eider Secretary of °tate, India Office.'Hi Sir H. Ritchie, The only telegraph office this Department has between Robat and Bam is one at Dehaneh. This place was chosen as more suitable for the purpose than Nasratabad-Sipeh, and lies 22 miles east of it, and 68 miles to the west of Rabat. There are two European Clerks stationed at Dehaneh. The guard for the office consisted of 4 Persian soldiers, but in November last the Persian Minister of Telegraphs ordered the local military authorities to provide an additional guard of 20 men so that the total strength might be brought up to 24 men. The staff at pehaneh should have in the office 4 rifles with 1000 rounds of ammunition and also 3 Mauser pistols. Sanction has been applied for by me to an estimate for additional buildings at Dehaneh. One of these buildings is to be a store house with a water tank in it, and is to have an upper story of which the walls will be loop-holed for the purposes of defence, If there should be any probability of an attack on the office, the clerks and the guard would occupy this building, and if necessary be able to defend themselves for some time until a relief party could be sent to their assistance from Robat. The Persian Government might certainly be called on to furnish a stronger guard, but the telegraph party at Dehaneh should be fairly secure as soon as the loop-holed store house is built. In the circumstances I do not consider the staff should be moved to Robat or Bam.

Folloi/ing conclusions are stated in it :~ (1) Expense, failure, risk, and evil results of measures taken by us last season render their repetition useless and inadvisable. ( 2) The choice of future action this season lies between (a) complete inaction as regards preventive measures and (b) strong effective naval and military oordon along Persian coast as far as Bander Abbas which will really stop arms being landed. (3) Should first alternative be adopted, it would still be necessary to protect with military detachments main telegraph stations on coast from Afghans and to retain present detaelinent at Rabat and withdraw telegraph staff between Robot and Dim to safety at either one place or the other. (4) Cordon along northern line through Robat not advocat ed because, to be effective, whole line as far as BamBam must be held by ouroelveu, tuad hecauBe coast line is preferable owing to infinitely less expense and difficulty of sending, feeding, and reinforcing troops there* Coast line, moreover, is not likely to cause trouble on Afghan border, and is in interests of Persian Government# (5) Banger of another season of armament of Indian frontier, rendering necessary consideration of really effective measures* Early intimation of our intention will prevent many Afghan traders from committing themselves to risk involved, if these measures are decided ux^on* m -v;u No. 2091 (Confdl)., dated Quetta, the 24th (received 27th) October 1908 (Confidential). From—The Hon’ble Major Sir Henry McMahon, K.C.I.E., C.S.L, Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In my letter No. 768 of the 26th July 1907, I made certain representations on the subject of the traffic in arms from the Persian Gulf. I have now the honour to review the further progress of this trade during the past year, and the results of measures taken by us to check it. 2. As anticipated in paragraph 14 of the above letter, the successful capture of an arms caravan by us at Kacha in May 1907 has had no effect in checking the traffic in arms. On the contrary, the impetus given to the trade by the profits made in 1907 has been such that the Afghan arms traders during the past year have increased to very large numbers, and their operations have been carried on on a scale far surpassing that of former years and with a daring that renders them a menace in the country which they traverse. 3. On our part preventive measures have, as before, been restricted to the Persian Gulf and its littoral and to that portion of the Chagai district lying between Mashki Chah and Robat. Redoubled efforts have been made by His Majesty’s ships to intercept arms crossing from Maskat to the Persian coast, and an elaborate system of land patrolling and of communicating information to our sea patrols has been carried out with the aid of the Indo-European Telegraph staff along the Persian coast. Owing to the numbers and strength of the arms caravans it was considered necessary to reinforce the military detachment at Rob at by 500 infantry who left Quetta on 8th April 1908 and did not return until the 8th August. Tnis force watched the Perso-Baluch frontier from near Mashki Chah to Robat, but were not allowed to operate inside Persian territory. Pressure was brought to bear on the Persian Government to take measures to close the routes leading to Afghanistan west of Robat. Orders to this effect were issued to the Governors of the Kain and Seistan provinces and an impressed rabble of local people was eventually despatched in the direction of those routes. 4. The results of these preventive measures cannot be considered to be of a satisfactory or successful nature. Notwithstanding the combined efforts of His Majesty’s ships and the coast signalling stations only one important capture of arms was made at sea. A naval party was actually attacked in attempting to land on one occasion by Afghans and had to retire with loss of life. The arms traders, on the other hand, succeeded in safely conveying from Maskat and landing on the Persian coast an unprecedented quantity of arms and ammunition. It is difficult to form anything approaching to an accurate estimate of these imports. A large portion is purchased on landing by the Chiefs of Persian Baluchistan and it is only concerning the remaining portion that finds its way to Afghanistan that we can obtain reliable information. So far as we can ascertain no less than 30,000 rifles and some three million rounds of ammunition have been successfully taken by Afghan arms traders from the Persian coast through Persia into Afghanistan during the past season. 5. Our military cordon in the north, it is true, prevented any of these I arms caravans crossing the portion of British territory lying between Persia and Afghanistan. Only one caravan even attempted to use the routes through this portion of the frontier and that hastily withdrew into Persia on finding } the road blocked. This success, however, has failed to be of the slightest advantage in any respect. The Afghan arms caravans finding the routes on our side blocked by .42 our troops had only to mate a slight detour to the west to evade our cordon and reach Afghanistan by one or other of the routes through Persian territory leading through the outskirts of Seistan. 6. The Persians notwithstanding all the pressure brought upon them made no serious attempt to block these routes and the sum total of their prowess during the season has been the cutting of the throats of two Afghan stragglers whom they caught asleep. As might naturally be expected the Afghans are much incensed at this cowardly outrage, but unfortunately for ourselves they connect us with it as much as they do the Persians, with the result that other caravans vented their feelings on our telegraph line and searched for an English telegraph officer to kill in retaliation for the murder. 7. At the close of the arms traffic season a small arms caravan has recently been intercepted by our Chagai Levies near Mashki Chah. Of the six Afghans with the kojila one was killed, one wounded and all captured by us together with their belongings consisting of 30 rifles and 2 pistols. The magnitude of the capture is out of all proportion to the ill-feeling and resent ment it has raised against us in the Helmund valley to which the men con cerned belong. 8. The net results of our season’s working on the Afghan frontier have been:— (1) Total failure to intercept arms or check the arms traffic. (2) The creation, owing to such measures as we did take and to Persian methods of co-operation therein, of most bitter resentment against us on the part of the Afghans concerned and their sympathisers in Afghanistan. (3) The publicity of the fact that we respect the Persian frontier, for reasons misunderstood by Afghans, to such an extent as to render the passage of arms caravans through Persian territory a matter of perfect ease and safety. 9. These unsatisfactory results have been gained at the cost of consider able trouble and expense both of money and prestige. The extra cost to Government of sending the reinforcing detachment to the Pobat frontier amounted in the form of carriage, supplies, and other incidental expenses to over Ps. 1,00,000. Of the cost of naval measures, of the military detchments, and the telegraph patrol and signalling arrangements on the coast I am unable to give the figures, but they must be fairly large. The number of troops we sent to the frontier was exaggerated by rumour thereby rendering the contrast between the magnitude of our precautions and the smallness of our success highly gratifying to the Afghan mind. As our Kandahar reports show, all the various caravans on their return to Afghanistan made much of their prowess. They each took to themselves the credit of defeating a naval attack, and boasted of successful encounters with our detachments on the Pobat frontier. \ 10. However unsatisfactory the retrospect of the results of the measures of the last season may be, the prospects of the coming arms traffic season are even less pleasing. The success of last year’s venture, the huge profits obtained and the flattering reception and treatment given to the returning traders by the Afghan officials and people will encourage others to take part in the arms trade in the season that is now about to commence. Our reports already show that | l ar S e numbers of Afghans are preparing to proceed to the Persian Gulf and their operations will be carried on on even a larger scale than last year. As a result of their resentment at certain incidents which occurred last year, we may expect retaliation in the form of attacks on any small parties of bur men they meet on the Persian coast and of wanton destruction to our tele graph lines either near the coast or between Pobat and Pam. It will be necessary to take measures to protect our telegraph staff on both those lines.The military detachment at Robat must again he reinforced if it is intend- I ed to block the routes east of that place and unless those routes are closed we cannot reasonably require the Persian Government to close those on the west, useless though it he to expect them to do so effectively. Our chances of coping successfully with the arms traffic of the coming season are thus infinitely worse than they were last year, and the question now arises whether we should take very special measures to meet these increased difficulties or abstain altogether from further effort and allow things to take their own course. 11. I am strongly of opinion that by merely repeating the precautions taken last year we will do more harm than good. They will lead to no useful results, and will be attended with considerable risk. They are productive of incidents which are made use of to embitter the feelings of the Afghan people against us, and our failure both on sea and land only covers us with ridicule. It would be far preferable to take no action at all beyond inexpensive measures of a purely defensive nature. These would include military detachments at the chief telegraph stations on the Persian coast, the retention of the present detachment at Robat and the withdrawal of the telegraph staff from Nasratabad-Ispe to that place or to Ram. There would be no attempt to patrol the coast, or to block routes through British territory. We will be saved great expense, trouble and risk, and the quantity of arms and ammunition that will reach Afghanistan will in no way be Effected. 12. The only other alternative is to adopt preventive measures on a large scale either on the south along the coast, or further north across the , caravan routes. The first would consist of placing a strong cordon of military detachments along the wdiole length of the Persian coast from our frontier at Gwettar to Bunder Abbas which would be able in concert with His Majesty’s ships at sea to prevent the landing of arms on the coast. In my letter No. 768 of 26th July 1907 on this subject, I suggested Minab as the western limit of our operations on the ground that the coast beyond that point was watched by the Belgian Customs staff. It has since come to notice that the Customs made no effort last winter to prevent the landing and sale of arms at Bunder Abbas itself. Unless their responsibilities in the matter can be enforced we would have to extend our operations to that place or even further west. This cordon would have to be a strong one not only to cope with the large parties of Afghans who might concentrate on any one point on the coast, but to meet attacks by the Persians themselves. The numerous Chiefs of Persian Baluchistan are now well armed, and they possess such vital interests in the arms traffic that any attempt on our part to stop it might be met with armed resistance. Our telegraph line would be in danger of destruction and have to be well guarded. It is probable that a force of at least two infantry regiments would be necessary for the above purposes. 13. The advantages of this coast cordon over any other would be (1) the fact that it would check the import of arms into Persian Baluchistan as well as into Aghanistan, thus preventing the former country becoming as it now threat ens to be a depot from which Afghans can draw arms in future years ; (2) it would permit of effective co-operation between our land and sea forces, and (3) enable us to feed, maintain and, if necessary, rapidly reinforce our troops easily and chiefly by sea transport. 14. The best line for a cordon further north is the one held by us last year from Mashki Chah to Robat with a prolongation westwards to Bam. To hold one portion of it and to leave the other open would be futile, and as tlie Persians have shown themselves hopelessly incapable of closing the portion within their territory we would, if this line be adopted, have to hold the whole of it ourselves.West of Robat the places along this line where water is obtainable are few and far between and the holding of these places would close the routes by which arms caravans could travel. One thousand to twelve hundred infantry at least would be necessary to hold the line effectively and the difficulty and expense of feeding them in that desert country so far from any base of supplies would be enormous. 15. A somewhat easier line as regards water and supplies would be that through Mirjawa, Ladis, Naramshir to Bampur, but the advantages would be as much in favour of arms caravans as of our preventive cordon. And unless our means of obtaining reliable information of the movements of the former were good, it would be easy for them to evade us. The greater length of this line would present difficulty. 16. Both these lines lie within Persian territory, but so does that along the Persian coast, where we already have military detachments. The total failure of the Persian Government to fulfil their obligations would appear to justify our taking necessary measures ourselves, and if this be admitted, the adoption of the line on which we act must depend entirely on the relative advantages of the lines on which action is possible. The only one advantage of the northern line through Robat to Bam over the southern one on the coast is that it is far less likely to involve hostilities -vyith the local Persians. The arms purchasing and arms trading Persian Khans are south of that line, and it would therefore not interfere with them. It runs through a very sparsely inhabited tract where the people take no interest in the arms trade, and would not trouble themselves in anything we did to check it. We would, therefore, be safe from local opposition and our telegraph line would be in less danger of destruction by local people. The cost of conveying the troops to the spot, of feeding them when there and the hardships of the troops themselves would however be very great. It would, moreover, be impossible to reinforce the force on either this or the other northern line without much trouble and delay. 17. The propinquity of this cordon line moreover to Afghanistan would greatly magnify the evil effect of our action along it in the Afghan mind. Collisions on that line would be more rapidly and more widely known in Afghanistan than those on the distant Persian coast. There would be an ever increasing danger of active assistance coming from the near Afghan border. JWpreover in watching the coast line we have greater justification for our action, i.e., that of assisting the Persian Government in a matter of mutual interest. Whereas our action on the northern line in preventing arms leaving Persia would not admit of such satisfactory explanation. 18. To sum up. Matters have arrived at such an unsatisfactory stage that even if we refrain from attempt to check the arms traffic it will be necessary during the coming season to take steps to protect our main telegraph stations on the coast and between Robat and Bam. In the case of the latter line we must either make the Persian Government send a sufficient guard to Nasratabad-Ispe or withdraw the European staff from there to Robat or Bam. We must either refrain altogether from any preventive measures on either the coist or northern line, or hold one or other of them in effective strength. If we take the latter course, let us restrict our action to the coast line. 1 19. If it were not for the serious danger that threatens the peace of our Indian frontier from the wholesale armament of our frontier tribes, and the trouble which threatens in the future from huge accumulations of arms and ammunition in Persian Baluchistan, I would advocate inaction pending the results of the Brussels Arms Conference ; but the evil effect of even one more arms traffic season will be so great that I am reluctantly compelled to urge that the Government of India should seriously consider the advisability of effect ively closing the Persian coast to arms traffic, cost what it may.9 q jf warning of our serious determination to close the coast could be eiven at some early date, it would deter many of the larger traders from risking ir fortunes on a dangerous undertaking and minimise the difficulty of our , i, x therefore recommend that, if it he decided to take effective measures, L pt should he widely notified. News of our intentions will quickly reach the principals through their agents at Peshawar, Quetta, Karachi and Maskat.

I have the honor to submit to you Mr. New’s report No. 22-P., of the 1st June 1908 (received by me on the 19th June) on the importation of arms from Muskatto the Mekran Coast for the period from the 1st April 1907 to 31st May 1908. 2. Mr. New’s paragraph 3. — I think the establishment of the system of patrols gave as good result as could have been expected. It forced the Afghans to change the field of their operations and I have no doubt interfered with their plans considerably. 3. I would draw attention to Mr. New’s paragraph 6 with regard to information obtained of the movements of His Majesty’s ships. 4. Mr. New’s paragranh 7. —This party of Afghans is referred to in the correspondence sent with my No. 272-P. of the 3rd April 3908. The man Saleh Mohamed, a resident of Karachi from whom they got considerable assistance, is known to the police here. 5. JM New’s paragraphs b to 11. —Although Mir Barkat, chief of part of Bierban, brother of Mir Mustapha, chief of Jask, who is subsidised by the Tele graph Department, was the most active of all the chiefs in Persian Mekran in giving assistance to the Afghans in gun running, there is no doubt that practically all the chiefs had a hand in the business. If any abstained it was 1 think rather from lack of opportunity than will. The Persian Government is certainly well aware of Mir Barkat’s actions, but nevertheless he is looked upon with favour. It is quite likely that Mir Barkat will use the resources he has got in an attempt to seize the chieftainship of Jask from his brother, Mir Mustapha, with whom he has been on bad terms for some time past. If so he will most likely succeed. 6. Paragraphs 12 to 22 do not call for any special remark by me, but with regard to paragraph 22 I think that all that was possible to he done in following and reporting the movements of the Afghans on their homeward journey was done both in this section and in the Persian Section. I fear however without any practical results the Afghans seems to have been well supplied with information and to have arranged their movements accordingly. 7. With regard to Mr. New’s paragraph 24. I need not speak of Mr. New himself ; what he has done is well known to you. Mr. W. P. Lovell and Mr. McMeekin, clerks in charge at Jask and Charbar, respectively, both deserve thanks. As to Jemadar Dilmorad his services were exceptional as Mr. New has shown. He is a member of the permanent line establishment of the department, ordinary pay Rs. 20, but since the 25th November 1907 he has been on special duty in connection with the system of patrols instituted by Mr. New, drawing Rs. 30 per mensem. I think a present of six months’ substantive pay, Rs. 120, would not be out of place for him. 1Mr New has also reported to me that Mir Mustapha Khan, chief of Jask, is worthy of special recognition, on account of his general behaviour and attitude towards the gun runners and also on account of his action as noted in paragraph 20 of Mr. New’s report. Mir Mustapha receives a subsidy from the Telegraph Department of Rs. 480 per annum. I would suggest that a present of Rs. 240 be made to him. 8. In conclusion. I think it is surprising that throughout the gun- running operations, there has been no interference with the telegraph line or staff Threats of attack were received from time to time and from the middle of March until the arrival of His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief at Jask on the 19th April 1908 the position there was one of some anxiety, but fortunately nothing happened. I attribute this to the goodwill of the chiefs and headmen of the country to the department, but I fear we cannot always expect such immunity in future. The action of the Telegraph Depart- ment towards guu running is common knowledge to all, and there must be many people now in the neighbourhood of Jask and also, though to a less extent, in other parts, through which the telegraph line passes, who consider they have grievances against the department, and probably also personally against Mr. New. Copy of letter No. 22-T., dated the 1st June 1938, from Mr. New, Assistant Superintendent of the Jask Sub-Division, to the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, Karachi. I have the honour to submit a report on the importation of arms from Muskat to the Mekran Coast, covering a period of fourteen months, from the 1st April 1807 to the 31st May 1908. 2, Proposals for the establishment of land patrols and telephone stations on the coast, in order to obtain better information of suspected landings of arms, were submitted {vide my No. 85 of the 17th August 1907), and subsequently sanctioned by the Government of India {vide Foreign’s No. 4538-E.A., dated the 20th November 1907) for a recurring expenditure of Rs. 374 per mensem. The scheme was initiated on the 25th November 1907, seven patrols being primarily engaged who were posted as follows North of the telegraph line to watch roads from up-country. Karwan district (one), Thana district (one). Coast patrols, one at each of the following places : — Sadech, Soorug, Rapch, Bandeni, Bir. On the 5th December 1907 three remaining patrols, contained in the above sanction, were engaged and posted as follows :— North of the Telegraph line. Upper Gabreg district (one). Coast patrols—Jagin (one), Gabreg (one). A further sanction was obtained {vide Eoreign’s No. 631-E.A., dated the 15th Eebruary 1908) for the establishment of two patrols to watch the portion of coast between Tank and Charbar. Only one patrol was employed at Sirgan, the other being utilized at the port of Bris Bunder (40 miles east of Charbar), an explanation of which is given in paragraph 7. The accompanying map (Appendix A) shows the disposal of the patrols sanctioned, and the telephone stations with which they were connected. 3. My endeavours to form a good system of patrols on the coast has not met with the success I anticipated. Good reliable men were engaged for the work, and had not the Afghans altered their original plans by changing their field of operations from Gabreg to the coast of Bierban, I feel sure we would 2 HIhave been able to give reasonably good information of suspected landings of arms, which might have led to more captures than have been accomplished during the season. It appears that our patrols and telephones on the coast acted as a deter rent to the Afghans, which confined their operations to the Bierban coast. 4. The first Afghans to arrive on the coast this season travelled over land from Afghanistan, reaching Gabreg at the end of November 1907. During the succeeding months of December, January and February a few arrived at Jask by mail steamer, but the majority travelled overland, some direct to the Jask district, while others came from the direction of Bunder Abbas. They brought many transport camels from Afghanistan and purchased many more in the Bierban and Minab districts. 5. There is a lapse of two months between the arrival of Afghans on the coast, and the landing of their first consignment of arms at Gabreg. This is largely due to the deportation of some 50 Afghans from Muskat, which greatly disorganized their plans; and later they were unable to come to terms with Mir Noor Mohamed of Gabreg to send Baluchis to Muskat to purchase rifies. 6 . The first large consignment of arms to be landed by the Afghans this season was accomplished at Gabreg on the 3rd March 39)8, and although the patrol at Gabreg gave early indication of a suspected landing (vide Task’s 26 words of the 10th February 1908 and 48 words of the 20th February 1908) in the circumstances it was almost impossible to determine the actual day of landing because the consignment was kept back in Muskat, and the Afghans themselves, who were waiting at Gabreg, had no idea when it would cross. I have thoroughly investigated the circumstances of this particular landing and find that the four boats which landed 2,880 rifies at Gabreg and 1,000 rifles at Habt were ready loaded in Muttra early in February. The presence of H. M. S. Proserpine at Jask and Muskat caused the Afghans to delay the departure, and later they got information from Ali Moosa of the Proserpine's probable visit to Bushire. The consignment was kept back for nearly a month and eventually sent across after the Proserpine's departure from Muskat for Bushire. I further gather that Nasib (the Naval contractor at Muskat) was in the habit of informing Ali Moosa of the movements of His Majesty’s ships. Nasib contracts for bread and as his bakers are on bo &gt;rd all naval ships in the Gulf, they are in good position to ascertain their probable movements. 7. On the 2nd February 1908, 57 Afghans, under Deen Mohamed Khan of Kabul, arrived at Gwadur by mail steamer from Karachi. They travelled to Dashtyari, where they halted, and when their intention of operating on the coast to the eastward of Charbar was known, I decided to establish a patrol and telephone at Rodi, near Bris Bunder. This party of Afghans made two successful landings, one at Bris Bunder on the 19th March 1908 and another at Fagjah (20 miles east of Charbar) on the 3rd April 1908. No indication of the arrival of either of these con signments could be obtained. With regard to the landing of 300 rifles at Bris Bunder on the 19th March 1908, it is regretted that the patrol at Rodi was fearful of the duties he had undertaken. He was dismissed and another man engaged. In addition to these two consignments, Deen Mohamed Khan bought about 300 rifles locally in the districts of Dashtyari and Bahu. 8. To revert to the Afghans operating in the Jask district it was stated in paragraph 5 that Mir Noor Mohamed demanded rather higher fees than the Afghans were disposed to pay. Negotiations were opened with Mir Barkat of Jask and Bierban, who was only waiting for a chance to induce the Afghans to divei’t their attention to the coast of Bierban. Mir Barkat is chief of part of the Bierban district which embraces the portion of coast from Kuh Mubarakto Karai Creek, and it will be seen that during the month of Apnl many large consignments of arms were landed between these points. He no doubt informed the Afghans of the presence of our telephone stations and enumerated the advantages of carrying on their traffic to the westward of .Task, which is out ol 1 v rpii. with t.hfi result that Ills services were accepted. Mir Barkat arranged to engage local boats, and to send his own men to Muskat to purchase rifles. His men patrolled the coast to watch the approach of boats carrying consignments of arms, and also assisted m the landing of cargoes. In fact he affoi-ded the Afghans every assistance for which he was liberally paid. 9 The terms arranged were that Mir Barkat should receive Bs. 2 and two rounds of ammunition on each rifle landed. Mir Barkat arranged the engage- ment of boats giving the owner an advance of Rs 100 and the balance, which amounted to o00 or 400 rupees according to the size of the boat, was paid by the Afghans on receipt of consignments. Altogether Mir Barkat is reputed to have received Bs. 23,0b0 from the Afghans and a corresponding quantity of a m mu n i ti on 10. I do not think Mir Barkat shared his takings for the season with any other chiefs of the Jask or Bierban districts. Two chiefs of Bierban, Mir Haji and Mir Kambar of Bunji, wrote letters to the officer in charge at Jask corro borating the fact that Mir Barkat was assisting the Afghans and receiving money from them. Their motive was undoubtedy jealousy and bitterness against Mir Barkat for refusing to share the profits of the undertaking with them. 11. Mir Mustapha Khan, chief of the Jask district, was, in the beginning of the season, inclined to accept the tempting bribes offered by the Afghans but he was made to recognize his duty as a subsidised chief, and I do not think he implicated himself to any extent with the arms traffic Mir Barkat engaged many boats belonging to subjects of the Jask district, but this could hardly have been prevented as he has a considerable amount of influence in the district, and Mir Mustapha Khan has very little, if any, con trol over him. 12. It will he seen by accompanying statement (Appendix B) that this season there is a prodigious increase in the number of rifles imported by Afghans. Among the consignments there was in addition probably more than three mil lion rounds of ammunition and about 2,000 Mauser and Browning Automatic Pistols. I have no information as to the reason for this activity, but judging by the large numbers of Afghans now engaged in the traffic it would seem that the undertaking is rather more than a commercial enterprise, as was formerly sup posed. 13. On the 26th March 1908 {vide my telegram words 159 of the 29th March 1908) H.M.S. Proserpine while cruising off Bunji narrowly missed capturing a dhow carrying a consignment of arms. While the Proserpine was searching, what proved to be a fishing boat, another dhow was observed to be making for tbe beach near Bunji. The dhow was able to get out of sight round Kuh Mobarak point, where her cargo was thrown into the sea, close to the beach, in about 10 feet of water and on being subsequently overhauled by the Proserpine she was found to be empty. The case was suspicious and Captain H. W. James decided to capture the dhow and keep her until evidence of her complicity in the arms traffic was obtainable. Confirming evidence of this particular dhow having jetisoned her cargo of arms came to hand on the 29th March 1908 {vide my telegram words 159 of the 29th March 1908) and the dhow was burnt at Jask on the same day by order of the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf.It was reported that 844 rifles were subsequently recovered by the Afghans who were assisted by Mir Barkat’s men and local divers, but it is uncertain whether the consignment originally consisted of 1,000 or more rifles, or whether any ammunition was lost. 14. Acting on information received from Bunji, contained in my telegram words 37 of tue 16th April 1908, while cruising off Bunji on the morning of the 18th April, H.M.S. Proserpine captured a dhow containing 1,500 rifles and 250,000 rounds of ammunition. This was the only endre capture of a boat, with its crew and contents, made during the season. 15. Captain H. M”. James must be credited with yet another success (vide mv telegram words 95 of the 4th May 1908). A dhow crossing to Bunji from the Batina coast was sighted and searched by H. M. S Proserpine on the 30th April, but found to be quite empty. It was afterwards reported by special kassid who obtained the information from the Nacoda of dhow, Uiat their cargo,’ which consisted of 150 boxes (40,000 rounds) of ammunition, was thrown overboard before they were overhauled by the Proserpine. 16 A landing party from H.M.S. Proserpine met with an unfortu nate accident at Bunji on the 19th April 1908. Three boats were sent from the ship to search a dhow, which was hauled up on the beach, and which had actually landed rifles the previous evening. On disembarking the Pro serpine met with a very heavy rifle fire from some 200 Afghans, who were ambushed among sand-hills quite close to the beach. The landing party retired to their boats, at the same time returning the fire, but unfortunately their maxim jammed, and if their retreat had not been covered by a heavy shell fire from H. M. S. Proserpine it is possible that many more ot t would have been hit. Two of the Proserpine’s were wounded, both subsequently died and were buried at Jask. I have made very careful enquiries as to the damage done by H. xM. S. Proserpine’s shell fires, and find that only one camel, belonging to the Afghans, was killed and the top of a hut was blown off. The ground near the beach at Bunji is composed of sanddunes running in ridges parallel to the beach, which affords excellent cover, and which would account for the little damage done to the enemy. From local information received regarding the incident, it appears that a body of some fifty Afghans were ambushed directly opposite the spot where the ship’s party landed, while the remainder were in extended order on both sides, covering about 500 yards of coast line. Their intention was to allow all the Proserpine's party to disembark, and then rush them with the hope of cap turing some and holding them as a ransom m exchange for the 1,500 rifles captured the previous day by H.M.S. Proserpine. Fortunately their plans were spoilt by another party of Afghans, who were marching ^ the beach, and who were the first to open fire directly they saw the ship party commence landing- 17 The number of rifles imported during the season by Baluchis (Appen dix C) also shows a xery big increase. This statement is separated from Appen- dix B because Afghans and Baluchis operate at different seasons and both un takings appear to be distinct from one another, although i is qu p that nearly all the rifles eventually got into the hands ot Atghans. It will be noticed that Baluchis cease importing during the winter “onths from December to April, which is the season the Afghans are engaged traffic. They commence importing again early in May, sfackenin ® en monsoon months on account of the difficulty m getting boats to r P their operations again in October. . With reference to your telegram words 44 of the 30th April 1 ’ states that the Political Officer at Chagai reports the arrival I^o Af hamstan of a party of 50 Afghans with 100 camels laden with arms, I think it is pr able that these rifles may have been part of the consigmn ginUr s ve( i Baluchis during the season, and were probably pui chase y Khan of Gaih or Mirza Khan of Bint. 56 18. On the 22nd March 1£08 there was rumonr current at Jask that there was 2,000 Afghans in the vicinity and that they intended to attack the tele graph station if any of their arras were captured by His Majesty’s ships. I arrived at Jask from Muskat the day after and at once instituted careful enquiries as to the number of Afghans in the immediate vicinity and their location. It was found there were some 500 to 600 Afghans scattered over the Jask and Bierban districts within a radius of 40 miles of Jask. Of these 250 weie camped in the hills above Arduri to the eastward of Jask, wniting for an expected landing of arms at Gabreg, but their plans were evidently changed, because at the end. of March they moved over to the westward of Jask and joined the remaining Afghans who were encamped near Kuh Mubarak. The upper Gabreg patrol was transferred to Kuh Mubarak, and arrange ments were made with certain trustworthy men of old Jask, and of villages further west, to bring in information of the movements of the Afghans. As the threat against the telegraph station was found to emanate from the Afghans themselves, the situation was considered to be critical, and everything was done to get early information of their movements and intentions. 19. H. M. S. Proserpine's capture of 1,500 rifles off Bunji on the 18th April rather increased the insecurity of the telegraph station, and it was deemed advisable by His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, who arrived at Jask on the i9th April, to land a party of marines from the flagship for the protection of the station against attack. The same evening Major Noel Smith with one officer and 38 marines landed from the flagship, and were quartered for the night on the roof of the station buildings. On the morning of the 20th April Sub-Lieutenant Wright, R.N., with a Maxim gun and crew of six bluejackets, were landed from the flagship, and the same evening a party from H.M.S. Proserpine, consisting of 15 marines, and a Maxim gun and crew of 4 bluejackets, were landed. 20. At the request of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, Mir Mus» tapha Khan was called in, and it was put to him that for the better protection of the telegraph station, the marines on shore should occupy the Persian fort, which is situated just outside the telegraph compound limits. Mir Mustapha Khan readily consented, and volunteered assistance with as many armed men as he could spare. The next day Mir Mustapha Khan sent in ten men from old Jask, who made themselves useful in showing the patrols round at night. Major Noel Smith’s party of marines with one Maxim gun and crew occu pied the Persian fort from the 21st to the 29th April, embarking on the evening of the latter date. The Proserpine's marines were posted on the roof of the main buildings and one Maxim was mounted on the roof of the Superintendent’s house. They remained on shoie till the 14th May. 21. Lieutenant J. V. M. Biscoe, I.A., arrived at Jask by mail steamer on the 28th April with a detachment of 53 men of the 112th Native Infantry from Nasirabad. He occupied the Persian fort the same evening Major Noel Smith’s marines were withdrawn, which occupation was retained until the 23rd May, when it was known that all the Afghans who were on the coast near Jask had reached a point nearly 200 miles up-country. 22. Early in April 1908, I commenced enquiries regarding the route by which the Afghans intended to travel back to Afghanistan. About the end of March some 200 Afghans went up-country accompanying the consignment of rifles landed at Gabreg and Habt on the 3rd March. They halted at Kamshao lak near Ramisk in the Bashkard district, which place was considered to be their rendezvous, and remained there till they were joined about the middle of May by an escort party of 500 Afghans, who came down from Afghanistan, arriving at Eanoch about the 15ih April {vide Charbar’s telegram words 62 of the 26th April 1908 and his correction telegram words 18 of the 28th). These two parties tvere joined later near Ramisk by 70 Afghans from the Dasbtyari district.Of the Afghans operating on the Bierhan coast, 305, accompanying about 12,000 rifles and much ammunition, left the coast near Bunji on the 30th April. They travelled northwards to Sarzhai (12 miles north-east of Sirik) where they waited some days for provisions from Mi nab, and later continued their journey north, leaving Sarzhai on the 10th May. Another small party of 45 Afghans remained on the coast near Bunji to receive the last consignment of arms landed at Gawan on the 2nd May. They moved up-country on the 6th May and afterwards joined tae party of 305 Afghans. I did my utmost to follow the movements of these five bodies of 500, 200, 70, 305 and 45 Afghans and managed to trace then to points rather more than 100 miles from Jask. Their first intention was that all parties should meet somewhere near Ramisk and travel together via Bampur ; but this route was afterwards abandoned in favour of the Regan route. Patrols and special kassids were sent north from Rapch and Soorug to Fanoch and Ramisk to watch the Bampur route and also to Anguhran in Bashkard to follow the movements of the 305 Afghans proceeding in that direction. I was always well informed of the movements from place to place of thess bodies of Afghans, but the chief difficulty lay in fixing their route northwards from points about 100 miles from Jask. The knowledge of the country north of Ramisk, possessed by patrols and kassids was very limited, and as they persistently returned from up-country with only information denoting the location of a party, it was not only most difficult to accurately determine their northward route, but it necessitated the despatch of another kassid and greatly delayed the receipt of reliable information. For tunately news reached me in time to report definitely (vide my telegram words 103 of the 21st May) that all five bodies of Afghans had met and were travel ling towards Regan. Their movements were about this time picked up by the Inspector in charge of the Central Persia telegraph line at Bam. The accom panying map (xAppendix A) shows the routes followed by the various parties of Afghans. 23. As yet no reduction has been made in the patrol establishment as Baluchis are still actively engaged in the arms traffic, but at the end of June it is my intention to temporal ily dispense with the services of the patrols sta tioned at Jagin, Upper Gabreg, Bandeni, Sirgan and Rodi. 24. In conclusion I would beg to bring to your notice that the conspicious service rendered by Jemadar Dilmorad who was specially selected for charge of the patrol establishment. Dilmorad has worked with unfailing energy and tact and I cannot speak too highly of his great assistance to me in gathering and verifying information. Particularly during the months of April and May, when the situation at Jask was considered critical, I was also entirely depen dent on Dilmorad to correctly estimate the strength and positions of various parties of Afghans in the neighbourhood, and the thorough manner in which he travelled round the district, regardless of the risk, in order to gather this information, is highly commendable. Dilmorad organised a system of spies to watch the movements of Afghans operating to the westward of Jask, and he constantly made journeys to Kuh Mobarak to verify reports. Since the initi ation of the patrol establishment in Kovember 1907, he must have travelled by camel considerably more than 2,00C miles. I would also beg to mention the good work done by Messrs. Lovell and McMeekin, the officer in charge of Jask and Charbar stations. A great deal of work in connection with the arms traffic was thrown on them this season, particularly during the months of February and March 1908. 25.

Ships and Vessels, East Indies. 1 have the honour to forward for your information “ A statement of Arms’* landed in Baluchistan between 1st April 190/ and 31st May 1908, prepared by Mr. New, Assistant Superintendent of Telegraphs at Jask, who kindly furnished me with a copy. I take this opportunity of submitting some remarks upon the arms traffic based upon this statement and some proposals for facilitating the suppression of the trade. &amp; 2 Mr. New as you are aware has devoted himself with great zeal to the collection of intelligence and has established a system of patrols, 12 in number, on the land line between Jask and Chahbar and a similar number of telephone stations. These patrols report movements of Afghans or caravans if in their district or parties of Baluchis waiting at any place on the coast to receive consign ments of arms. They obtain information of the departure of parties for Maskat to purchase arms and where arms are expected to he landed. They also report when arms are landed, giving the number of rifles. It is not considered desirable for.tbe patrols to have direct communication with H. M. Ships on the coast they accordingly report by telephone to Jask or Chahbar and the information is given to ships at those places. The information thus supplied has been of value in avoiding aimless cruis ing by locating the place at which arms are expected and the fact that a ship promptly arrives off the place has no doubt had a deterrent effect on the Baluch runners by increasing the risk of their enterprise. This is instanced by the comparatively small number of arms consigned to Balnchis since end of Novem ber. 191)7, when a ship was first stationed on the Mekran Coast to work in con junction with the telephoned information. Owing to other services a ship could not be spared before that date and it is of interest to note that no ship was on the Mekran Coast on 5th December 1907 and 23rd February 1908, on which dates 605 rifles were landed out of a total of 817 between end of Novem ber 1907 and end of May 1908.2 2. The system of telephone information also appears to have been instrn- mental in driving the Afghan runners to the coast west of Jask and'north of Ras-al-Kuh, which is a new departure. It will be seen that the majority of their rifles have been landed in this neighbourhood, especially at Bungj. Here the problem for ships is more difficult as there is no telegraph line in this district and information that arms are expected can only come by runner and may be received too late. However, it has been an advantage lo have the operations of the Aighan arm runners practically limited to a short length of coast, which it is possible to patrol with even one ship with some chance of intercepting a dhow—for example “ Proser. pine’s ” capture off Bungi on 18th April and the dumping of ammunition off the same place on 80th April. 4 The Afghans were late in commencing operations this season. Their deportation from Maskat in December 1907 and the exclusion of later parties capsized their arrangements. They were further delayed in fixing up satisfac- tory arrangements with Baluchis on the Mekran Coast to act as their Agents, Negotiations opened with Noor Mahomed, Chief of Gabrig, fell through owing to his demanding too high a commission. Finally, the Afghans concluded an airangement with Mir Birkat, Chief of the Bungi district, and commenced operations. In selecting this district it is highly probable that they were influenced by fear of the telegraph patrol information and as Mir Birkat is pid to have served the Afghans and himself well it is likely that the Bungi district will be again selected as the Afghan head-quarters next season, which will probably commence in November. In this case it will be well to concentrate our efforts in that direction so long as Afghans remain there and neglect the coast east of Jask unless more ships are available. See also paragraph 10. 5 The net resnlt of the year is that 2’2,853 rifles and a quantity of ammu nition’ have entered Baluchistan, of which 16,654 rifles have been consigned to Afghans and are now presumably on their w r ay to Afghamstan and the border tribes The efforts of H. M. Ships employed tor the suppression of the arms traffic have resulted in the capture of 1,500 (1,750 ?) riflesby ‘‘Proserpine and the dumping overboard of some ammunition, but m addition the activity ot the ships has no doubt had a deterrent effect. Ibis result though an improve- menton that obtained in previous years has necessitated an expenditure ot about 2,500 tons of coal, value about £5,300. The odds in favour of the arms runners are enormous with the class and number of ships available. 6. The arms landed in Baluchistan although most inimical to British interests by- no means represent the annual export from Maskat. There is no doubt that large quantities of arms are shipped in native craft to Kuweit and places on the Tersian Coast, in fact the trade flourishes all over the Gulf. 7. For the Mehran Coast alone I respectfully submit that at least 4 ships, preferably of the “ Proserpine ” class, would be required to seriously check the traffic so long as present treaty conditions at Maskat remain in force. There is a coast line of 170 miles between Tank and Bas-ash-Shir to he watched. It co-operation with armed patrols on the coast could be arranged a solution of the problem would, I think, be presented, but I fear there w r ould be political objec tions to this course. 8. My experience of the three subsidized ships on this service has forced me to the conclusion that they are ill adapted for it. They are deficient in speed and in white complement hut perhaps their greatest limitation is in having no wireless. The “ Sphinx ” also is of little use at night as she has no search light and the boat of her paddles advertises her presence to a dhow or people on shore at a considerable distance. A dhow with a fair wind will make b or a knots or more. . ,9. Should the Brussels conference fail to result in the closing of Mashat to the importation of arms and the employment of four ships of a superior class for the suppression of the arms traffic not he entertained, I beg to submit the desirability of fitting the subsidized ships with wireless telegraphy. This would, in spite of their other limitations, materially increase their efficiency for this service and enable them to more readily co-operate with any of the larger ships of the squadron which you could spare for this service. I understand that the establishment of shore W. T. Stations at certain places in the Gulf is contemplated by the Indian Government and that the question of fitting the subsidized ships has also received consideration in connexion with this scheme, but I would urge that the fitting of the ships be not delayed till the shore stations are ready. One ship at a base, such as Jask, Chahbar or Maskat could transmit intelligence by W. T. to a ship cruising off the coast or waiting, in an advantageous position to intercept a dhow upon receiving information by W. T. that she had left Maskat. Again it has happened that intelligence is received of arms having been landed shortly after a ship has gone out to intercept them, the ship therefore wasted coal on a profitless errand or missed a chance of capturing arms expected at another place because the later information could not be communicated to her. If the ship remaining at the base goes out to act on the later information she may arrive too late and in any case communication with the base is cut off and perhaps valuable information may be received from the telephone patrols during the absence of both ships from the base. Such a case is based on actual experience and illustrates the necessity of W. T. in all ships employed on this service. 10. If whilst existing treaties remain in force some agreement with the Sultan of Maskat could be made by which arms and dhows captured in his territorial waters were confiscated by the Government instead of being handed hack to him the problem would be greatly simplified as a blockade of Muttra, at any rate during the presence of Afghans in Baluchistan, ought to show good results by the employment of the three subsidized ships only^ if fitted with W. T. The saving in coast of coal and maintenance involved in other methods would probably balance any reasonable compensation to the Sultan. In the past I understand there have been insuperable objections to such an arrange ment but the result of the Brussels Arms Conference may possibly modify the position. 11. It will be seen from the attached statement that the smuggling of arms by Baluchis into Mekran Coast is not confined to the cool season but is perennial. However a ship cannot be spared for this service all the year roun owing to other requirements such as the protection of the pearl and a e industries, etc. With the concurrence of the ^Resident and Government or India only one ship has remained on the coast since end of May and operations will cease until the autumn after middle of June. I am informed that mos o the arms run to the Mekran Coast by Baluchis are stored by the Ka i a un i the next Afghan season. The Kalifa lives at Sarhingi, 25 m les . . o Rapch. The number of arms which find their way into Afghan hands t is way is however small compared to the direct importation ot the gians themselves when they come down to the coast in the cool season. 12. The following information obtained at Maskat may be useful nest season. Dhows for the coast E. of Jask prefer to cross direct by the shortest route, 120 miles, but if after waiting ready laden for some days a lair W'nd does not serve they work up the Batineh Coast, generally not turt er a , and then strike across from there at first favourable opportunity. The Afghan runners making for the coast N. of Ras-al-Kuh work U P^® Batineh Coast to Khor-Fakan or Di'bbak and make across from there tnus obtaining a minimum run in the open. 1 5 | 3The favourite time for landing appears to be just before or at dawn. I have tried to intercept dhows reported as having left Maskat by a curve of search but the many unknown factors are calculated to defeat this method, notably actual time of leaving, direction, whether direct or by Batineh Coast, and speed, I think that the intelligence service at Maskat and Muttra might be 13. In conclusion I should like to record the help and assistance given by Mr. New, and 1 trust that his services to the Government and H. M. Ships may not expose him to the risk of reprisal by Afghans or Baluchis when he next goes out on his inspection of the land line.Enclosure 2 to Arms Traffic, 1907-08. Maskat, 15th June 1903. The following additional information was received on my return to Maskat and is added to the report of the 10th instant, which could not be posted before. 1. One hundred rifles consigned to Mir Birkat were thrown overboard from a bedan in deep water of Kuh Muharrak on morning of 11th June on “ Redbreast ” being sighted. The rifles were buoyed hut with insufficient buoy- rope for depth of water. “ Redbreast ” was unaware of the dumping at the time. Seven hundred rifles belonging to a Persian were thrown overboard in deep water near the Quoins off Musandan on 24th of May(?) on sighting “ Lapwing ” coming up astorn. Lapwing ” was then on passage from Jask to Henjam. The news was brought to Maskat by Sheikh of Kumsar on 31st May. Thus 800 additional rifles may be added to the credit of H. M. Ships although in neither case was the ship aware of the occurrence at the time which was in each case subsequently reported by the sufferers. These are instances of the moral effect of the presence of H. M. Ships and indicate that their activity combined with the actual capture of two dhows by “ Proser pine ” (one condemned and burnt on circumstantial evidence of having recently landed arms and the other captured with arms, condemned and crew punished) have had the desirable effect of creating a state of panic. 2. I am informed that the Sultan of Maskat is greatly disturbed by the recent capture and loss of arms. He may therefore more readily be prepared to agree to some such arrange ment as is indicated in paragraph 10 of my submission of 10th instant. Very few dhows have left for the Mekran Coast during the last six weeks owing to* fear of capture although Baluchis have been busy purchasing arms. Several dhows have, however, left Muttra with arms for Batineh Coast or other parts of the Gulf. 3. Since the end of May the following rifles are reported to have been landed on the Mekran Coast— (a) 100 near Galeg on June 4th. (b) 1,000—5 miles east of Khonarak—June 8th. (&lt;?) 30 near Surap, June 8th. 4. With reference to paragraph 12 of my submission of 10th June, the following appears to be the latest practice adopted by Baluch runners. The arms are taken from Muttra to Sohar or other place on the Batineh Coast and landed. After an interval they are re-shipped in a Baluch bedan hailing from Mekran Coast and taken over to the consignees. &amp; S. LITCHEIELH, Commander and S. N. O y Fersian Gulf Division. G. C. B.

They are now reprinted for convenience of reference, in con nection with the Treaty (No. 8) signed on the 21st March, 1905. No. 1. (Printed on page 47 of C. 2776 of 1881.) . „ Letter from Mr. Griffin to Sirdar Abdur Rahman Khan, dated l‘ith June, 1880. My friend, I have received your letter of the 16th May by the hand of Sirdar Ibrahim Khan, Sirdar Bahadoor, who arrived at Kabul on the 23rd May, and have fully understood its friendly sentiments, and the desire which it expresses for a cordial understanding between the British Government and yourself. This letter, together with the memorandum of the members of the Mission, which w 7 as shown to you before despatch, and which mentioned certain matters regarding which you desired further information, has been laid before His Excellency the Yiceroy and Governor-General of India ; and I am now commanded to convey to you the replies of the Government of India to the questions which you have asked. Firstly. With regard to the position of the ruler of Kabul to foreign Powers, since the British Government admit no right of interference by foreign powers in Afghanistan, and since both Kussia and I ersia aie pledged to abstain from all political interference with Afghanistan affairs, it is plain that the Kabul ruler can have no political relations with any foreign Power except the English ; and if any such Power should attempt to interfere in Afghanistan, and if such interference should lead to unprovoked aggression on' the Kabul ruler, then the British Government will be prepared to aid him if necessary, to repel it, provided that he follows the advice of the British Government in regard to his external relations. Secondly. With regard to limits of territory, I am directed to say that the whole province of Kandahar has been placed under a separate mler, except Pishin and Sibi, which are retained in British possession. Con sequently the Government is not able to enter into any negotiations with you on’ these points, nor in respect to arrangements with regard to the North-Western Frontier, wdiich were concluded with the ex-Amir Muham mad K akub Khan. With these reservations the British Government are willing that you should establish over Afghanistan—including Herat, the possession of which cannot be guaranteed to you, though Government are not disposed to hinder measures which you may take to obtain possesion 1875 Wt 459 5/05 D&amp;S 6 21101 ^ 2 —of it—as complete and extensive authority as has been hitherto exercised by any Amir of your family. The British Government desires to exercise no interference in your internal government of these territories, nor will you be required to admit an English Resident anywhere ; although, for con venience of ordinary friendly intercourse between two contiguous States, it may be advisable to station, by agreement, a Muhammadan Agent of the British Government at Kabul. If you should, after clearly understanding the wishes and intentions of the British Government, as stated in former letters and now further explained, desire these matters to be stated in a formal writing, it is necessary that you should first intimate plainly your acceptance or refusal of the invitation of the British Government, and should state your proposals for carrying into effect friendly arrangements. Sirdar Wazirzada Muhammad- Afzal Khan has been ordered to leave Khanabad within five days after receipt of this letter, as it is necessary to understand from him, by word of mouth, the position of affairs, and your wishes and sentiments. Should your reply be sent by his hand, it will prevent delay and accelerate the conclusion of final arrangements, and consequently the Government trusts that you will be able to make use of his agency. No. 2. (Printed on page 48 of C. '2776 of 1881.) Letter from Sirdar Abdur Rahman Khan to Mr. Griffin, dated 22nd June, 1880. The kind letter, sent by the hand of Taj Muhammad Khan, telling me of your welfare and friendship, arrived on the 11th Rajab (20th June), and caused me great pleasure. What was the wish and object of myself and people you yourself have kindly granted. Regarding the boundaries of Afghanistan which were settled by treaty with my most noble and respected grandfather, Amir Dost Muhammad, these you have granted to me. And the Envoy which you have appointed in Afghanistan you have dispensed with, but what you have left to (be settled according to) my wish is, that I may keep a Mussulman Ambassador, if I please. This was my desire and that of my people, and this you have kindly granted. About my friendly relations and communication with Foreign Powers, you have written that I should not have any without advice and consultation with you (the British). You should consider well that if I have the friendship of a great Government like yours, how can I communicate with another Power without advice from and consultation wdth you ? I agree-to this also. You have also kindly written that should any unwarranted (improper) attack be made by any other Power on Afghanistan, you will under all circumstances afford me assistance ; and you will not permit any other person to take possession of the territory of Afghanistan. This also is my desire, vdiieh you have kindly granted. As to wdiat you have written about Herat. Herat is at present in the possession of my cousin. So long as he does not oppose me, and remains friendly with me, it is better that I should leave my cousin in Herat, rather than any other man. Should he oppose me, and not listen to my words (advice) or those of my people, 1 wdll afterwards let you know'. Everything shall be done as w r e both deem it expedient and advisable. All the kindness you have shown is for my welfare and that of my people, how T should I not accept it P You have shown very great kindness to me and my people.I have written and sent letters containing full particulars to all the tribes of Afghanistan, and 1 have given copies of these papers to Sirdar Muhammad Afzal Khan, for transmission to you ; and I have also communicated verbally to Afzal Khan certain matters. Three days after this I will give him leave to start. Consider me also, the slave of the threshold of God, as having already arrived at Parwan. Send me back a verbal reply by Muhammad Afzal Khan, so that he may reach me on the road wherever I may be. Dated 13th Rajah. (P.S.—In Abdur Rahman’s own hand.) I have signed this and sealed this envelope with wax. In this letter, and the former letters, all is written by the same hand, and there is no alteration (erasure) anywhere. No. 3. (Printed on page 40 of C. 2770 of 1881.) Letter from Mr. Griffin to His Highness Sirdar Abdur Rahman Khan. Amir of Kabul, dated “ July, 1880.” After compliments. His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council has learnt with pleasure that your Highness has proceeded toward Kabul, in accordance with the invitation of the British Government. Therefore, in consideration of the friendly sentiments by which your Highness is animated, and of the advantage to be derived by the Sirdars and people from the establishment of a settled government under your Highness’s authority, the British Government recognises your Highness as Amir of Kabul. I am further empowered, on the part of the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, to inform your Highness that the British Government has no desire to interfere in the internal government of the territories in the possession of your Highness, and has no wish that an English Resident should be stationed anywhere within those territories. For the convenience of ordinary friendly intercourse, such as is maintained between two adjoining States, it may be advisable that a Muhammadan Agent of the British Government should reside, by agreement, at Kabul. Your Highness has requested that the views and intentions of the British Government with regird to the position of the ruler at Kabul in relation to Foreign Powers, should be placed on record for your Highness’ information. The Viceroy and Governor-General in Council authorises me to declare to you that since the British Government admits no right of interference by Foreign Powers within Afghanistan, and since both Russia and Persia are pledged to abstain from all interference with the affairs of Afghanistan, it is plain that your Highness can hnve no political relations with any Foreign Power except with the British Government, If any Foreign Power should attempt to interfere in Afghanistan, and if such interference should lead to unprovoked aggression on the dominions of your Highness, in that event the British Government would be prepared to aid you, to such extent and in such manner as may appear to the British Government necessary, in repelling it; provided that your Highness follows unreservedly the advice of the British Government in regard to your external relations. [Note— This letter, which is generally referred to as the letter from the Foreign Secretary dated the 20th July, 1880, is known to have been sealed by Mr. Griffin and delivered by him on the 31st July, 1880.]* No. 3. t Printed on page 72 of C. 3930 of 1884. No. 4. (Printed on page 85 of C. 3930 of 1884.) Letter from the Viceroy of India {the Marquess of Ripon) to the Amir of Afghanistan, dated Simla, the \bth June, 188o. After compliments. Your Highness will remember that, at Sn Lepel Griffin s interview with you at Zimma on the 31st July, 1880, he said that the Government of India could only start your Administration by giving you a grant to pay your army and officials and your immediate expenses; and that having recognised you as Amir, it was anxious to see you stiong ; )ut a tei you had taken possession of Cabul, you must rely on your own resources. I have always interested myself so much in your Highness success, and have felt so great a desire for the establishment of a strong and friendly 1 ower under your Highness’ auspices in Afghanistan, that 1 ha\e on various occasions gone beyond the determination then communicated to you. and have from time to time aided your Highness with sums of money and arms, besides devoting some lakhs a year to the support of Afghan refugees and detenus, whose presence in Afghanistan is, I understand, regarded by youi Highness as dangerous to your power. Still my view of the relations to each other of the two countries has throughout been that, in matters of internal policy and finance, India should not seek to interfere with Afghanistan, but should confine herself to the part of a friendly neighbour and ally. On these conditions, it would be in accordance with the practice of nations that Afghanistan should resrulate her own finance and bear her own burdens as she has always done heretofore. As regards matters of external policy, your Highness was informed in the communication from the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, dated the 20th July, 1880,* and again in my letter of the 22nd February, 1883,f that if any foreign Power should attempt to interfere in Afghanistan, and if such interference should lead to unprovoked aggression on the dominions of your Highness, in that event the British Government would be prepared to aid you to such extent and in such manner as might appear to the British Government necessary in repelling it ; provided that your Highness lollows unreservedly the advice of the British Government in regard to your external relations. On consideration, however, of your accounts of the condition of your north-west frontier, I have been satisfied that your Highness has to contend with exceptional difficulties in that quarter. I have understood that, owing to various untoward circumstances, your Highness has not yet been able to reduce the important frontier province of Herat to the orderly and secure condition so essential for the protection of Afghanistan as a whole ; and, therefore, that, for the settlement of the affairs of that frontier, some friendly assistance may be needful to you. I further observe, with satisfaction, your Highness’s assurances of good faith and loyalty to the British Govern ment ; and your Highness’s language convinces me that you realise how much it is to the interest of Afghanistan to maintain friendly relations with the Government of India. Impressed by these considerations, I have determined to offer to your Highness personally, as an aid towards meeting the present difficulties in the management of your State, a subsidy of 12 lakhs of rupees a year, payable monthly, to be devoted to the payment of your troops, and to the other measures required for the defence of your north-western frontier. I feel that I may safely trust to your Highness’s good faith and practised skill to devote this addition to your resources to objects of such vital importance as those which I have above mentioned.Agreement signed at Kabul on the 12th November, 1893. Whereas the British Government has represented to His Highness the Amir that the Russian Government presses for the literal fulfilment of the Agreement of 1873 between Russia and England by which it was decided that the river Oxus should form the northern boundary of Afghanistan from Lake Victoria (Wood’s Lake) or Sarikul on the east to the junction of the Kokcha with the Oxus, and whereas the British Government considers itself bound to abide by the terms of this Agreement, if the Russian Government equally abides by them, His Highness Amir Abdur Rahman Khan, G.C.S.L, Amir of Afghanistan and its Dependencies, wishing to show his friendship to the British Government and his readiness to accept their advice in matters affecting his relations with Foreign powers, hereby agrees that he will evacuate all the districts held by him to the north of this portion of the Oxus on the clear understanding that all the districts lying to the south of .this portion of the Oxus, and not now in his possession, be handed om* to him in exchange. And Sir Henry Mortimer Durand, K.C.I.E., C.S.L, Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, hereby declares on the part of the British Government that the transfer to His Highness the Amir of the said districts lying to the south of the Oxus is an essential part of this transaction, and undertakes that arrangements will be made with the Russian Government to carry out the transfer of the said lands to the north and south of the Oxus. Kabul, 12th November, 1893. 12th November 1893 (Signed) H. M. Durand. (Signed) Amir Abdur Rahman Khan. (2nd Jamadi-ul-awal 1311.) No. 6. (Printed on page 30 of C. 8037 of 1896.) Agreement signed at Kabul on the 12th November, 1893. Whereas certain questions have arisen regarding the frontier of Afghan istan on the side of India, and whereas both His Highness the Amir and the Government of India are desirous of settling these questions by a friendly understanding, and of fixing the limits of their respective spheres of influence, so that for the future there may be no difference of opinion on the subject between the allied Governments, it is hereby agreed as follows . (1.) The eastern and southern frontier of His Highness’s dominions, from Wakhan to the Persian border, shall follow the line shown in the map attached to this agreement. (2.) The Government of India will at no time exercise interference in the territories lying beyond this line on the side of Afghanistan, and His Highness the Amir will at no time exercise interference m the territories lying beyond this line on the side of India. (3) The British Government thus agrees to His Highness the retaining Asmar and the valley above it, as far as Chanak. His Highness agrees on the other hand that he will at no time exercise interference in Swat, Bajaur, or Chitral, including the Arnawai or Lashga valley Ihe British Government also agrees to leave to His Highness the Birmal tract as shown in the detailed map already given to His Highness who relinquishes his claim to the rest of the Waziri country and Dawar. His Highness also relinquishes his claim to Chageh.(4.) The frontier line will hereafter be laid down in detail and demarcated,', wherever this may be practicable and desirab'e, by Joint British and Afghan Commissioners, whose object will be to arrive by mutual understanding at a boundary which shall adhere with the greatest possible exactness to the line shown in the map attached to this agreement, having due regard to the existing local rights of villages adjoining the frontier. (5.) With reference to the question of Chaman, the Amir withdraws his objection to the new British Cantonment and concedes to the British Government the rights purchased by him in the Sirkai filerai water. At this part of the frontier the line will be drawn as follows : — From the crest of the Khwaja Amran range near the Psha Kotal,. which remains in British territory, the line will run in such a direction as to leave Murgha (Taman and the Sharobo spring to Afghanistan, and to pass half-way between the New Chaman Fort and the Afghan outpost known locally as Lashkar Dand. The line will then pass half-way .between the railway station and the hill known as the Mian Baidak, and, turning southwards, will rejoin the Khwaja Amran range, leaving the Gwasha Post in British territory, and the road to Shorawak to the west and south of Gwasha in Afghanistan. The British Government will not exercise any interference within half-a-mile of the road. (6.) The above articles of agreement are regarded by the Government of India and His Highness the Amir of Afghanistan as a full and satisfactory settlement of all the principal differences of opinion which have arisen between them in regard to the frontier ; and both the Government of India and His Highness the Amir undertake that any differences of detail, such as those which will have to be considered hereafter by the officers appointed to demarcate the boundary line, shall be settled in a friendly spirit, so as to remove for the future as far as possible all causes of doubt and misunderstanding between the two Governments. (7.) Being fully satisfied of His Highness’s goodwill to the British Government, and wishing to see Afghanistan independent and strong, the Government of India will raise no objection to the purchase and import by His Highness of munitions of war, and they will themselves grant him some help in this respect. Further, in order to mark their sense of the friendly spirit in which His Highness the Amir has entered into these negotiations, the Govern ment of India undertake to increase by the sum of six lakhs of rupees a year the subsidy of twelve lakhs now granted to His Highness.

K.O.I.E., to His Highness its Dependencies, dated Kabul, the the After compliments. —When your Highness came to the throne of Afghan istan, Sir Lepel Griffin was instructed to give you the assurance that, it any foreign power should attempt to interfere in Afghanistan, and if such interference should lead to unprovoked aggression on the dominions of your H ighness, in that event the British Government would be prepared to aid you to such extent and in such manner as might appear to the British Government necessary in repelling it, provided that your Highness followed unreservedly the advice of the British Government in regard to your external relations.I have the honour to inform your Highness that this assurance remains in force, and that it is applicable with regard to any territory which may come into your possession in consequence of the agreement which you have made with me to-day in the matter of the Oxus frontier. It is the desire of the British Government that such portion of the northern frontier of Afghanistan as has not yet been marked out should now be clearly defined ; when this has been done, the whole of your Highness’s frontier towards the side of Russia will be equally free from doubt and equally secure.

It seems desirable to arrive at some understanding with the Amir before the next caravan season, since the probability of attacks upon the officials of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and upon other British persons and interests in Persia, cannot be ignored. I do not suggest that any handle should be given to the Amir for controversial correspondence, but it might be pointed out to him that, if arms are required for “ arming the people of Afghanistan ” with Lis permission, some other means might be devised for obtaining them which would not involve the traffic through Persia with the tribes on our side of the line, or the risk of violent conflicts in Persia between his own and British subjects. The matter is one in which a friendly exchange of views may lead to a clear understanding as to the extent to which His Majesty the Amir really approves of the traffic with his own people, and to means being devised for satisfying his wants by legitimate means. 1 have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Mouley of Blackburn. S. 7. AENCLOSURE. Foreign Office to India Office. No. 23,121- Foreign Office, 15th July 1908. The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Under-Secretary of State for India, and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith copy of the under-mentioned paper. Despatch from Mr. Marling, No. 152, -June 17, on the subject of the arms traffic through Persian Territory to Afghanistan. Annex 1. Mr. Marling to Sir E. Grey. No. 152. Gulhek, Sir, 17th June 1908. With reference to my Despatch No. 134, of 22nd May 1908, I have now the honour to report that a caravan conveying arms, said to consist of 900 camels, and escorted by armed Afghans whose numbers are variously estimated at from 100 to 1,200 men, has made its way almost unmolested to some point on the Perso-Afghan frontier north of Koh-i-Malik Siah. From the telegraphic reports of the officers of the Indo-European Telegraph Department stationed at Bam and Dehanneh, which I have received from the Director of the Persian Section of that Department, it appears that this caravan travelled from Minab via Rudbar, Masitabad, Chah-i-Malik, Dashta, Gnrg, Gerageh, Baluchab, and Nawar Chah. The Persian local authorities in the districts traversed by the caravan appear to have endeavoured to comply with the orders sent, at my instigation, by the Central Government to head the caravan off towards British territory, but, as I anticipated, they were unable to effect this owing to lack of all organisation and to being far worse armed than the Afghans. In one case only did a Persian force venture to attack the caravan, and it was compelled to withdraw hurriedly from the engagement. The Indo-European Telegraph line between Robat and Dehanneh was cut and much damage was done to poles, &amp;c\, by the Afghans as they passed Dehanneh. They probably wished to prevent news of their movements being telegraphed to our troops at Robat, but they are also, according to the report of a Persian employe of the Telegraph Depart ment, who was seized by them but subsequently escaped, anxious to avenge the death of six of their comrades who were killed in the encounter with His Majesty’s Ships in the Persian Gulf. The employe in question was sent from Dehanneh to get information and was seized by the Afghans who enquired particularly if there was an Englishman at Dehanneh, as they wished to kill any Englishman they could find. Another Persian employe of the Telegraph Department was seized and cut to pieces by the Afghans. * From the latest telegrams I have received it appears that the caravan has made Afghan territory in safety, and that 20 men have returned to Persian territory to avenge the deaths of two stragglers from the caravan who were caught and beheaded by Persian troops sent to intercept it by the Governor of Kain. S. 7. A 2There are rumours of a second caravan being on its way from Mmab, but up to the present no confirmation of these rumours has reached me. From the constant reports received by Mr. King W ood. Director o the Persian Section, from the Indo-European Telegraph Department Inspector at Dehanneh, it is evident that the Afghan gun-runners are resolved to attack the telegraph station at Dehanneh with the avowed intention of killing the Inspector and destroying the line and stores, and, as there is scarcely any hope that the Persian Government could provide Tdequate protection to Mr. Norris, or indeed despatch a force which would reach Dehanneh within 15 days, Mr. King Wood has authorised Mr. Norris, should he consider his life to be m danger, to transfer his headquarters to Koh-i-Malik biah temporalily. „ » The Vice-Consul at Koh-i-Malik Siah has already sent four men of his escort to protect Mr. Norris ; these men would, of course not be sufficient to repel an attack on the station by Afghans in force, but they will be available to escort him to Koh-i-Mahk Siah. I warned the Minister for Foreign Affairs that an escort to protect Mr. Norris might be sent from Rob at. „ It must be confessed that the attempt to put a stop to the arms traffic has been a complete failure, nor do I see how any other result could have been hoped for, considering that success was dependent on the effective co-operation of the Persian Government. As it is, the Persian Government have at my urgent and repeated requests done more than I thought was possible in its present disorganised and almost bankrupt circumstances. But little as it was I doubt very much whether they will be able to achieve more for some years to come. I have carefully explained the whole question to Ala-us-Sultaneh, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has promised to do what he can to get a strong force sent to Fehanneh and Nasratabad (Ispe), but 1 must confess to being somewhat concerned at the news above mentioned, that, after the large caravan had safely crossed into Afghanistan, 20 Afghans turned back into Seistan to take vengeance for the death of two of their comrades. It seems to me not improbable that a similar desne for vengeance may induce the large caravan now said to be en route to make reprisals whenever opportunity offers, and that by inviting the Persian Government to take steps to intercept it, we are running the risk of provoking a series of incidents which might lead to more dis agreeable consequences than imperilling the safety of the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s officials and property.

Sir:- With reference to my despatch No. 134 of May 22nci 1903, I have now the honour to report that a caravan conveying arras said to consist of 900 camels, and escorted hy armed Afghans whose numbers are various ly estimated at from 100 to 1,200 men, has made its way almost unmolested to some point on the Persa- Afghan frontier North of Koh-1-Malik Biah. Prom the telegraphic reports of the officers of the Indo-European Telegraph Department stationed at Bam and Dehanneh, which I have received from the Director of the Persian Section of that Department, it appears that this caravan travelled from Minab via Rudbar, Masitabad, Chah-i-Malik, Dashta, Ourg, Gerageh, Baluchab, and Nawar Chah. The Persian local authorities in the districts traversed by the caravan appear to have endeavoured to Sir Edward Grey, Bart., j &amp;C. , *C. , &amp;c. ' ;to comply with the orders sent, at my instigation, hy the Central Government to head the caravan off towards British territory, hut, as I anticipated, they were imahle to effect this owing to lack of all organisation and to being far worse armed than the Afghans. In one case only did a Persian force ven ture to attack the caravan and it was compelled to withdraw hurriedly from the engagement. The Indo-European Telegraph line between Rohat and Dehanneh was cut and much damage was done to poles &amp;c. by the Afghans as they passed Dehanneh. They probably wished to prevent news of their move ments being telegraphed to our troops at Rohat, hut they are also, according to the report of a Persian employe of the Telegraph Department, who was seized by them hut subsequently escaped, anxious to avenge the death of six of their comrades who were killed in the encounter with His Majesty f s Chips in the Per sian Gulf. The employe in question was sent from Dehanneh to get information and was seized hy the Afghans who enquired particularly if there was an . Englishman at Dehanneh as they wished to kill any Englishmanx &gt; Englishman they could find. Another Persian em ploye of the Tele,graph Department was seized and cut to pieces by the Afghans. From the latest telegrams I have received it appears that the caravan has made Afghan territory in safety and that 20 men have returned to Persian territory to avenge the deaths of two stragglers from the caravan who were caught and beheaded by Persian troops sent to intercept it by the Governor of Kain. There are rumours of a second caravan being on its way from Minab but up to the present no confirm ation of these rumours has reached me. From the constant reports received by Mr. King Wood, Director of the Persian Section, from the Indo- European Telegraph Department Inspector at Dehanneh it is evident that the Afghan gun-runners are re solved to attack the Telegraph station at Dehanneh with the avowed intention of killing the Inspector and destroying the line and stores, and, as there is scarcely any hope that the PersianGovernment could provide adequate protection to Mr. Norris or indeed despatch15 days, Mr, King Wood has authorised Mr. Norris, s 'ould he consider his life to he in danger, to trans~ fer his head-quarters to Koh-i-Malik Siah temporar ily. _ The ice Consul at Koh-i-Malik Blah has already sent four men of his escort to protect Mr. Norris; these men would of course not he sufficient to repel an attack on the station hy Afghans in force, hut they will he available to escort him to Koh-i-Malik q iah. I warned the Minister for Foreign Affairs that an escort to protect Mr. Norris might he sent from Rohat. It must he confessed that the attempt to put a stop to the arms traffic has been a complete failure, nor do I see how any other result could have been hoped for, considering that success was dependent on the effective co-operation of the Persian Govern ment. As it is the Persian Government have at my urgent and repeated requests done more than I thought was possible in its present disorganised and almost bankrupt circumstances. But little as it was I doubtdoubt very much whether they will he able to achieve more for some years to come. I have carefully explained the whole question to Ala-us-8ultaneh, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs who has promised to do what he can to get a strong force sent to Dehanneh and Nasratabad flspe) but I must confess to being somewhat concerned at the news, above mentioned, that after the large caravan had safely crossed into Afghanistan 20 Afghans turned back into Beistan to take vengeance for the death of two of their comrades. It seems to me not im probable that a similar desire for vengeance may induce the large caravan now said to be en route to make reprisals whenever opportunity offers, and that by inviting the Persian Government to take steps to intercept it we are running the risk of provoking a series of incidents v/hich might lead to more dis agreeable consequences than imperilling the safety of the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s officials and property.

D.—22-6-08.—53—E.A.D’S.1 Public Works Department, Ho.I.E.59'/, dated loth July 1908. i(' - j- ' With reference to tie report forwarded with my ho.5.-o dated 8th July 1908, I have received a letter today from the Director of Telegraphs at Teheran, in which he informs me that Gholam Shah, the telegraph Lineman, who was said to have been killed by the Afghans who wrecked Jne telegraph line, is alive. His death was reported by the Vice-Consul at Kuhi-Malik-Siah, but it now appears the man has found his way to that place, having escaped fiom nis captors at Dakidela on the Helmund. The Director states that no reason has been given for the incorrect report of the man’s death at the hands of the Afghans.' Public Works Department, The following report might he forwarded to the Political Department for information. information was received by the Director of Tele graphs at Teheran that an armed .Afghan caravan of gun runners consisting of some 700 men and 900 camels had arrived at Regan on its way north from the Persian QUlf . Some Persian troops were sent from Bam to Regan to expel the Afghans from the place, and the caravan moved out on the 23rd.May last. The Afghans were apparently allowed to march unmolested across the desert, and on the 6th June the cara van reached Gerageh, a regular halting place on the Regan- Seistan road lying some 12 miles to the east of this de partment’s telegraph office at Dehaneh. This station is 22 miles to the east of Basratabad Sipeh, and 63 miles to the west of Kohi-Malik-Siah. Immediately after the arrival of the Afghans at Gerageh they wrecked the telegraph line there, and news was received that Akber, the Gholam or Lineman, had been captured by them. This man afterwards reported that.he was caught on the evening of the 6th June by a party of 20 Afghans, each of whom carried a magazine rifle, a Mauser pistol and a revolver. This party had apparently come to spy on Dehaneh, and the tents pitched there gave the impression that there was a guard of soldiers at the telegraph office. Akber was cross-examined by his captors 3 vftr/c/captors and said that there had been an Englishman at Benaneh, who had left on hearing of the approach of the Afghan caravan, and Akber was then promised freedom and a rifle if he would say where the Afghans could find a European* The party then took him to their camp, where another party of 80 men got their camels ready and said they would go and see for themselves what was at Dehaneh, but after further cross-examination of Akber they apparently ended by believing him and did not start. They informed Akber that they wanted to kill an Englishman in revenge for having had six men killed on the coast. On the morning of the 7th June the Afghans captured Gholam Shah, the Lineman, who was proceeding from the Kohi-Malik-Siah side to repair the line. The caravan left Gerageh on the afternoon of the 7th doing further wreckage to the telegraph line as they advanced along it, and taking the two line gholams with them. Luring the night Akber managed to escape with his arms bound, and he suffered greatly from hunger and thirst, before he was found by the party repairing tie line. He reported that he left Gholam Shah well when he got away. The Afghans carried Gholam Shah to some point near the frontier, when news appears to have been brought to them that the Seistanis had captured two Afghan stragglers belonging to the caravan, had at once killed them, and sent their heads to seistan. It is understood that the receipt of this news caused the Afghans immediately to kill their prisoner, Gholam Shah, the telegraph Lineman, and his body is reported to have been hacked to pieces. The establishment of the Lehaneh telegraph office ordinarilyordinarily consists of two European Clerks, but one of these Mr .James, has been transferred temporaril\y to Bam to carry out some secret inquiries for the Government of India re garding the traffic in arms. At the time the Afghans were in the neighbourhood of Dehaneh I understand only 1 European and 1 Armenian signaller were in the office..The guard con sists of 4 Persian soldiers, who would have been of little use in the case of an attack on the office. After consul tation with the British Minister at Teheran, and with his approval / the Director of Telegraphs at Teheran has moved the whole of the Dehaneh office staff to Kohi-Kalik-Siah, presumably till such time as a suitable military guard can be provided for our telegraph station at J)ehaneh. The caravan of Afghans is reported to have had many Baluch spies in its pay* The incidents i have reported show that if the telegraph line from Kohi-Malik-Siah to Seistan, for which the Persian Government has been asked to give a concession, is erected along the Afghan frontier, it is likely to obtain very bad treatment fr4m the Afghans over the border. July 1908.From Viceroy, IQth October 1907 V* Foreign Secret. Capture of arms caravan in Kacha Gorge. Our telegram of 12tli May and correspondence forwarded since with Secretary’s letters of 20th June and 29th August. Letter dated 11th September has been received from Amir complaining of seizure of caravan and killing and wounding of men accompanying it; he greatly exaggerates number of arms captured, which, he says, were being brought for the purpose of arming people of Afghanistan, and expresses hope that our frontier officials will be punished, and steps taken to prevent such attacks in future. I have heard from secret source, which I believe to be reliable, that Amir wrote to his envoy to push matter on, adding that if he does not get full satisfaction he is prepared to cut off all connection with British Government. It is possible that Amir wrote in this strain to impress envoy, as we are aware he has done in the past, but our informant states that he appears to be very angry, and this may make him more difficile about accepting Convention. Amir says that he had only just heard of the affair, but the news writer at Herat on the 17th June and the British Agent officially at Kabul early in July reported that smugglers had complained to the Amir, who had not taken much notice of the case, though he was at Kandahar, it seems possible that he now realises that our action will stop his free supply of arms, and that anti-foreign party have also pointed out inadvisability of checking this supply to our tribesmen, and that he has written in this strain to maintain his popularity in Afghanistan. Possibility of this difficulty was foreshadowed in our Despatch No. 24, 21st February 1907, paragraphs 9 and 12, but dangers arising from illicit trade were so great that we had to run risk, and seizure has undoubtedly done some^ good. It may also be that he is put off by garbled accounts of negotiations about Convention, which could easily have reached him, as he was close to Russian frontier. I am making inquiries from Macmahon regarding certain points of detail, and will defer reply to Amir for few weeks in order to allow him time to answer about Convention and to observe his attitude. I propose eventually to justify action on grounds that persons concerned were engaged in illicit traffic contrary to laws of British and Persian Governments, that they were well aware of this, as shown by papers which fell into our hands, that the caravan was escorted by large party of armed men who tued to force their way through British limit, and that it was necessary to prevent such armed violation of our territory. I will refer to notorious fact that large numbers of these arms are being sold in Afghanistan to our frontier tribesmen without let or hindrance, and that, while we have allowed Amir every facility for obtaining arms for himself, we cannot possibly consent to unrestricted illicit import by irresponsible persons. It was not known at the- time that the caravan belonged to Afghan subjects, and I regret misadventure which they brought upon themselves. Now, however, that Amir is aware that the trade is illicit, and that we strongly object to such violation of our territory, I trust he will help us in putting a stop to it. 1 shall be glad to know if you approve my answering on these lines. Recent frontier diaries show that arms from the Gulf are reaching frontier tribes in large numbers from Afghanistan; and that Afridi jirgas, when received at Kabul, were told bv Nasrulla that they could purchase as many of these arms as they pleased, and no taxes or other difficulties were raised when the arms were being exported. The supply is practically unlimited and constitutes a very serious danger, and even at the risk of annoying Amir we cannot well allow him to make a grievance of legitimate action by us within our frontiers. Our gooi understanding with Russia ought to enable us to deal with him firmly m this case which involves two most important questions of policy, viz., the un- restHc ed illicit supply of arms to Afghanistan and intrigues from Kabul wTth our tribes, in regard to both of which Amir has been clearly told, more than once, that we cannot allow any interference with our rights.

Terribly unfortunate this mcii en d certa i n l y be what other answer than you propose is possib e.

My 150-1. 305 Afghans who left Agoosh yesterday reported to traTel ' l “| north lid Serik, Dodar, Telling, Sarnai and Jagm to ^“1‘improbably (east ?) to Ramisk where they hope to join large escort of 500 A^hans (p ob y same lot travelling westwards from Fanoch, vide Charbar s 62-26th ‘ ? halt at Ramisk until arrival 45 Afghans now awaiting one cpusigment arms a more ammunition expected at Gatan. From Bamisk they continue \ve ( 33Ispaka Mushkuh skirting Bampur by way of Kasimabad and thence north east through the Dizak District. No other places north of Dizak known, but think their route is via Khwash and 1 adis. Have sent special kassid to Bamisk to report directly Afghans leave there. I estimate Afghans will be 1,000 strong for journey beyond Kamisk, of which at least 200 are Afghan camelmen. They accompany about 12,500 rifles with probably two million rounds ammunition. They travel light and cover about 25 miles a day. This was repeated by wire to the same addsesses as No. 8. 10. From New, Jask, 71 words, of 2nd May, to Resident, Bushire. Bapeh reports special kassid returned who confirms Charbar’s 62-26th ultimo that 500 Afghans are travelling westwards to Meha (15 miles north of Sedech); they will probably meet lot of 305 Afghans who left for Ramisk 30th ultimo. Special kassids are watching movements both these sections north of Arduri and Gangan. 11. From New, Jask, 95 words, of 4th May, to Resident, Bushire. Special kassid reports boat was crossing to Bunji 4 days ago with 150 boxes ammunition from Khursokhan (vide my 150-1) was overhauled by man- of-war (probably Hyacinth) and all ammunition was thrown over board before search made by man-of-war’s boat. Special kassid sent north from Arduri reports 500 Afghans travelling westwards reached Peera in Bashkard (40 miles north of old Jask) 3 days ago; they have evidently missed other party travelling north.

In continuation of my No. 291-P. of the 13th April 1908, I have the honour to send copies of telegrams for the week ending the 20th April 1908. r^llp a 1. From New Task—64 words of 13th April to Resident. Be my 52, 30th ultimo. Dizakis with transport donkeys have moved from Rapch to Khonarak for expected landings. Eight men from Champ left Puzim in two boats for Muscat yesterday to buy rifles Nacodas Ramadan and Kaidee both boats belong to Wadam (Arab Coast). Copy of 52, 30th ultimo, is also sent. “ Ten men from Dizak left Khonarak yesterday by boat for Muscat to buy rifles. Nacoda Abdul Karim expected to return in ten days. Their transport donkeys are waiting at Rapch.” 13 i/ I:14 2. From New Jask—37 words of 16th April to Besident. “ Afghans are moving towards coast with transport animals for expected landings at Gangan Koh Mubarak and Bunji.” From Commander Proserpine t 18th April, to Besident. « Confidential. This morning at 10 a.m. captured dhow containing a large Quantity of arms and ammunition off Kuh Mubarak. Crew of dhow abandoned her in a boat on approach of ship. Have towed dhow to Jask contraband and crew of dhow now on board Proserpine. Bequest advice as to ^disposal. Dhow is from Muscat via Khor Fakan and had one Afghan on board.” 4. From Besident, Bushire, to Commander, Proserpine, 18th April. « jf dhow was captured within 3 miles limit disposal of arms will have to be discussed with Persian Government. Meanwhile it is not advisable that they should he landed at Jask, and if, as it would appear from your wire, the dhow is owned and manned by Omanis, best course would seem to be deposit arms in Muscat Consulate and hand crew and Afghan over to Sultan for safe custody in his fort pending disposal. If you cannot tow dhow over she had better be burnt. Please telegraph course adopted.” 5. From Commander, Proserpine, to Besident, Bushire, 18th April. « Dhow was captured 5f miles from coast. We can take her to Muscat, and I think this the best plan except for possible reprisals by Afghans making presence of ship here desirable though Lovell and New are not uneasy at pre sent. 1,500 rifles and much ammunition.” 6. From Besident, Bushire, to Commander, Proserpine, 18th April. ft Under circumstances I think it would be better to store arms on board and remain in vicinity of Jask. Perhaps you could keep crew on board until another ship comes on until you can hand them over at Bunder Abbas. 7. From Commander, Proserpine, to Besident, Bushire, ISth April. &lt;&lt; Dhow is Persian owned and Persian manned.” 8. From New Jask—58 words of 19th to Besident, Bushire. “ Mir Mustapha Khan, Chief of Jask, has sent in special messenger to say Afghans are collecting near old Jask with the intention of attacking the e e- graph Station.

It is his business to protect his charge.

M.’s Ships and Vessels, East Indies. I have the honour to report that, in accordance with your instructions, I proceeded to an anchorage off Has Kuh last night, and proceeded at dawn this morning to patrol the coast between Has Kuh and Ras ash Shir. 2. At 7 a.m. two dhows were observed at anchor off Bunji village. I anchored the ship 1 j miles from the shore and sent in the steam cutter, cutter, and whaler in charge of the Senior Lieutenant, to examine the dhows foi contraband arms. The boats were manned and armed, the cutter having a Maxim. 3. They approached the dhows as nearly as the depth of water would permit, and the Senior Lieutenant landed with the Intelpreter and several of the whaler’s crew to examine the dhow, which had been left aground by the falling tide. 4. As they were wading ashore from the whaler, an armed party of natives were observed from the ship making their way towards the spot tehind sand-dunes close to the beach. I warned the boats by signal, and hoisted their recall. Hearing firing from the natives I opened fire on them from the ship with the 4-inch guns. 5. Heavy rifle fire then commenced along a front of half a mile of the beach at the boats. The officer and men who had left the boat returned to her, firing as they retired. Fire was also opened from the other boats at the natives. The Maxim unfortunately jammed after 25 rounds had been fired from it. 6. The re-embarkation and retirement of the boats under a heavy fire was well carried out, but I regret to report two casualties (attached). This number, however, would have been largely increased had it not been for the steadiness of the boats’ crews, who were, in my opinion, mostly ably directed at a somewhat critical moment by Lieutenant M. B. Baillie Hamilton, (whose report I have the honour to attach). 7. I would also specially mention the coxswains of the three boats, all of whom rendered valuable assistance. Their names are :— George Cheater, P. 0. 1. cl., P. C. S. 182556, Coxswain of 1st cutter, Robert G. Love, Lg. Sea., P. C. S. 165444, Coxswain of steam cutter, Frederick G. King, A. B., P. C. S. 176151, Coxswain of whaler,I;/ - also— George J. Butcher, P. 0. 1. cl., C. C. S. 210902, Gunner’s Mate in charge of the Maxim in the cutter, of whom, I regret to state, King was wounded and has subsequently succumbed to his injury. 8. The firing from the ship appeared to be of service in keeping down the Afghan fire and I believe did them some damage. 9. On the boats getting out of range I ceased fire. 10. I believe the attack was pre-arranged and intended as a retaliation for the capture of the dhow containing arms and ammunition already reported.

James, R.N., H.M.S. Proserpine. I have the honour to report that about 7-30 a.m. I left the ship with the steam cutter, first cutter, and whaler, with orders to examine tw'o dhows anchored close in shore off Bunji and about 1J miles from the ship. 2. I left the steam cutter in 5 feet of w T ater half a mile from the shore, and proceeded in the cutter and whaler till the cutter touched mud, where I ordered her to remain and cover the landing. She was then about a quarter of a mile from the above. 3. I went in the wdialer, accompanied by the Interpreter, and pulled towards the dhows. About 80 yards farther in than the cutter, the whaler touched mud. The crew T then got out and towed the boat another 80 yards in about 1 foot of water, or rather less. 4. I then left one hand in the boat and proceeded w r ith the remainder wading towards the dhows. About 150 yards farther in there w r as a sand patch situated also 150 yards from the dhow, and when w^e had got there the ship was observed to be signalling. At the same time a shot was heard away to the left front, and immediately after fire was opened from the left front, which we returned. I then ordered the men back to the whaler. The cutter had opened fire mean while. 5. The shooting then was general both to the left, in front, and to the right, being heaviest from the left. 246. Half-way back to the whaler Biddlecombe, A.B., was hit and was towed back b\ one of the men. On reaching the whaler I ordered the men to get the off-shore side and towed her off-shore at an angle so as to cover the men^ 7. When abreast the cutter I ordered the crew to do the same, and when in deep water we got into the boats and pulled towards the steam boat. King, A.B., the coxswain of the whaler, was shot one minute after we started pulling. The shooting continued until we were out of range and was returned by the boats’ crews. 8. hen we neared the dhow a few men v'ere visible in shore of her near her, but these men walked back to the village. 9. At no time did I see the men firing, but the smoke came from a sand ridge and sandhills sprinkled lightly with scrub 200 yards in shore, and from the village and palm grove. 10. The dhows were in shallow water, probably only 2 or 3 inches deep and about 200 yards from the high watermark. They had fishing nets hung on their yards and were alongside one another with their masts down. 11. The reason for towing the whaler in through the shallow water was in case the water deepened further in, as it often does in the locality.

Extract from a letter from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, to the Commander* in-Chief, East Indies, No. 1-08, dated the 25th January 1908. * * * * 8 . I found Mr. New at Charbar and accompanied him for three days along the telegraph line, visiting some of the telephone stations, and seeing his sowar patrol atwork. Mr. New is very sanguine that this year will see the^ capture of several stands of arms, and though from what I saw of the country it would be difficult for any Afghan caravan to assemble unnoticed the practically unlimited number of places at which the arms carrying craft can land their cargoes renders capture at sea unlikely. However, I agree with Lieutenant an( f Commander Hose that the scheme instituted seems to be the best yet devised, though, owing to the present disorganised state of the arms traffic due to the prohibition of Afghans into Maskat, it is early to give an opinion of the Telegraph Patrol system. 9. Although the British India Company have received instructions not to book Afghan passengers for Maskat, Afghans varying in numbers, continue to arrive by every mail steamer from Karachi, and, although booked for Bunder Abbas, invariably endeavour on some pretext or other—to buy J ic e for instance—to leave their ship here * This * Maskat - landing has hitherto been prevented; by the ship’s officers when the number of passengers is small, and by a guard when the Captain of a mail steamer does not consider himself competent to stop them larding and asks for assistance. On the 6 th January the^ same 53 Afghans who had been deported to Karachi in H. M. S. Redbreast arrived back in the British India Steam Navigation Company’s slow steamer and would have undoubtedly broken out of the ship had not a Marine guard prevented them. I would submit that the British Indian Steam Navigation Company be asked not to embark Afghan passengers for Bunder Abbas as well as Maskat, the two places being only 24 hours steaming apart.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 330, dated the 28th January 1908, on the subject of the Afghan traders who insisted on landing on Bahrein from the S.S. Kasara. 2. The S.S. Nerludda arrived here after dark, an almost «npre c e &lt; lente affair, on the 31st January 1908, and her mails were received m the Post Office about an hour after midnight, the weather being very iou 0 a ’ The Mail Officer had been ordered by his Commander to ask tor the delivery of the out-going bags as quickly as possible, with the result that was enabled to leave the Post Office before 7 a.m.3. In the circumstances it was considered futile to attempt to put the Afghans on board the steamer as the Commander had told the Mail Agents that he wished to leave the Port at daybreak, and the men are still awaitin 0 * an opportunity to proceed to Lingah. 4. The result of my examination of the Afghans’ account-books seems only to indicate that the records relate to money-lending transactions. The entries were made in Persian and I found no references to arms aud ammunition. No. 135, dated Calcutta, the 28th February 1908. From— Messrs.

Illicit Arms Traffic in Persian Gulf. In continuation of our letter No. 65 of 18th ultimo we now have the honour to enclose copy of letter from our Bombay Agents, dated 22nd instant, on this subject. We shall be glad to know whether Government still wish us to refuse this traffic, and if so, whether they do not consider it reasonable that we should receive sufficient compensation from them to recoup us for the loss of the trade. We would moreover point out that a good deal of this traffic which we refuse finds its way across by buggalow, with the result that the object of the restriction is not attained, and the British India Company are put to considerable loss.

Illicit Arms Traffic in Persian Gulf. Referring to your No. 41 of 18th ultimo, Karachi Agents inform us that it is difficult to estimate the loss to the Company since Maskat has been closed against Afghan passengers as no record is kept of caste of deck passengers booked. r ° They state an instance when Ka«ara turned round at Karachi to the Persian Gulf, their booking clerk telephoned from the Detention Camp where he had been sent to issue tickets that there were 250 Afghans waiting to book to Maskat and asked instructions. They were refused tickets to Maskat and eventually 168 were booked for Bunder Abbas making the loss for the Easara alone of 82 passengers at Rs. 5 per head, Rs. 410. Since the restrictions have been enforced against this class of passengers the Company has lost approximately Rs. 350—400 per week from Karachi. They state this year a very large number of Afghans and Pathans have come to Karachi with the object of going to Maskat, but many have returned to their country since the restrictions have been enforced. To meet the wishes of the Government to put a stop to illicit arms traffic m the Persian Gulf the Company loses a considerable amount annually in both freight and passage money.

Trouble has arisen between Kambar and Mustapha Khan and Barkat’s representatives re division of money received from Afghans. Letter proves beyond all doubt that Mustapha and Barkat are ^ implicated in arms traffic and are giving every assistance to Afghans. There is also much jealousy between Mustapha and Barkat.

(3) Words 178, dated the 2nd April 1908, from Mr. New, Jask. The 844 rifles thrown overboard by boat at Bunji on 26th ultimo were recovered at low tide by Afghans assisted by local people and slaves of Barkat and Mustapha. Proserpine captured boat empty after arms were thrown out and after every one had escaped, but failed to suspect arms thrown overboard. Boat was burnt at Jask on 28th ultimo by orders of Senior Naval Officer. There are now between two and three hundred Afghans near Gangan, about 30 miles west of Jask and about 200 in direction of Jagin, 40 miles to eastward of Jask. I do not think there are more than five to six hundred Afghans within radius of 50 miles of station. Their rendezvous is Kamshaolak in Bashkard district, 100 miles north of Jask. Gun running will probably cease by end of April or middle May. Afghans intend travelling by Bunder Abbas-Bampur road and thence through desert into Afghanistan and have bought many mussucks for desert journey. I hear they will not attempt last year’s route.

Rendezvous of Afghans is Kamshaolak in Bashkard, about 100 miles north of Jask. Rive more boats with arms are expected, on receipt of which gun running season by Afghans will probably close. Afghans have given out their intention of avoiding last year’s route via Nuskhi, and this year will follow Bunder Abbas-Bampur road and thence across Seistan desert into Afghan istan. They have bought many mussucks for water and are prepared for desert journey. There are now between two and three hundred Afghans near Gangan and about 200 in direction of Jagin, 40 miles to eastward of Jask. I do not think there are more than five to six hundred Afghans within a radius of 50 miles of the station. ' . : . (9) Words 176, dated the 3rd April 1908, from the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, Karachi 1 to the Political Resident, Bushire. Your 260 of 25th ultimo to Foreign. Latest reports go to show that there are from 500 to 600 Afghans within radius of 50 miles of Jask and about 60 wfithin radius of 50 miles of Charbar. You have no doubt opinions of Naval officers, but it appears to me that if a gun-boat is kept at Charbar and another at Jask till end of gun running season, say till end of this month, the question of strengthening detachments at both places is not so pressing as it appeared to be at first. You know the position at Jask. At Charbar Clerk in Charge says no trouble expected unless a consignment of rifles expected at Bris, 35 miles east Charbar, about fortnight hence is captured. Clerk in Charge, Charbar, apparently thinks Afghans might be assisted by local people because recently a Dashtyari Chief visited Darya Begi at Charbar and brought with him 300 Baluchis and 20 Afghans, but I think presence of gun-boat would suffice to prevent such a contingency.

I received independent reports to the same effect from the Vice Consul at Koh—i-*MaliK—P.iah# 2* In August I sent Levy Jemadar Said Khan and Dak Jemadar Nazar Jan to the Sarhad to make enquiries as to the routes taken by arms caravans during the sunnier and they reported that the three caravans *• whose reality had in the meantime been denied -had in fact an actual existence and had been seen at Kwash by their informantStwhence it had taken the route given in my letter No.447-C,dated the 19th September 1907# I had no reason whatever to doubt the veracity of ray agents* statements or their good faith,and when I considered the extreme difficulty of watching the long stretch of desert traversed by the Trade Route,it seemed to me that the negative testimony of people who had not seen the caravan was not of equal weight as evidence.3. Th« story of th® third caravan was subsequently corroborated by a certain Balueh named Mir Hussain, who recently came to Lutaic from Shamalan,noar oirishk# At Taghaz on the Helmtind,he stated,he was the guest of one Khuda Nazar,Baluoh.

Landings are expected daily at Gangan and Gabreg, and relays of Afghans and Baluchis are patrolling coast at intervals of two miles on look-out for boats.

I have received reports of 4,302 arms having been landed during present cold season on Persian Mekran Coast. Maskat also reported despatch for Mekran Coast of 430 rifles and 23 thereabouts (thousand ?) rounds of ammunition in December and January, but reports of actual landing of these not received. Number of men concerned has not been given in most cases, but Jask wires at beginning of March regarding arrival of three boats, reported Afghans in force, and that they would not allow any one to approach. Bunder Abbas diaries have reported arrival of numerous caravans accompanied by Afghans, and Maskat has mentioned 471 Afghans as having arrived between January and March. They were not allowed to land there, but must have gone on to other poits. Bombay Police Abstract of 15th and 29th Eebruary also mentions that parties of Pathans have been going every week from Karachi up the Gulf. Report you mention, therefore, requires no further confirmation. Charbar reported on 5th March that his munshi returning from Dashtyari reported upwards of 50 Afghans there under Din Muhammad Khan, Kabuli. They had purchased 215 rifles, 28 camels, 15 swords, and had in possession 7,000 sovereigns, 600 currency notes, value unknown, and were ottering Baluchis three rupees per rifle plus expenses to visit Maskat bring arms. Report received two days ago says that 300 rifles landed 40 miles east of Charbar and taken Dashtyari for Din Muhammad Khan. Information, therefore, points to Dashtyari as rendezvous.

Orders just received here for despatch of 500 Native Tnfantrv aud 2 spins, British Mountain Battery, to Robat to reinforce garrison and intercept arms kafila. I have had no intimation of this from you. I doubt prohabiliiy, even with existing garrison, arms kafila going out of their wav to risk loss by route through our territory when neighbouring easy route through Persian territory offers no risk. A large reinforcement will convert probability of use of Persian route into a certainty, and therefore ensure sate passage of arms into Afghanistan unless our troops are allowed to enier Persian territory and close all routes between Amalaf and Nasratabad Ispe. This would of course make collision certain, and with regard to this I invite refer ence to paragraphs 16 and 17 of my letter No. 768 of July 25th, 1907, and sub sequent communication from the Amir. A collision in Persian territory would he difficult, to explain to Amir. Unless there are other reasons unknown to me, 1 hex- to deprecate despatch of guns, especially those of a British Battery. Fodder difficulty will make them encumberance to Infantry and involve great expense while British gunners will suffer severely from conditions of country at this time of year. The curious sensitiveness of Persians regarding guns and the extraordinary and far reaching rumours which their ariival on frontier will create are points deserving of consideration. Mv opinion is that unless our troops can work in Persian territory, the lar^e reinforcement now ordered is useless, and a smaller reinforcement of BOO Infantry would amply suffice to block all routes through our territory and cope with any kafila in ‘improbable contingency of their using such routes. In short, if we are to work in Persian territory, we should send 600 Infantry and no guns ; but it' only our own routes are to be blocked, reinforcement of 300 Infantry is sufficient. Telegram, dated (and received) the 4th April 1908. From—The Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, Karachi, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. New wires from Jask 3rd:— Begins. Bendezvous of Afghans is Kamshaolak in Bashkand, about 100 miles north of Jask. Five more boats with arms are expected, on receipt of which gun running season by Afghans will probably cease. Afghans have given out their intention of avoiding last year’s route via Nushki and this year will follow Bunder Abbas-Bampur road and thence across Seistan desert into Afghanistan. They have bought many mussacks for water and are prepared for desert journey. There are now between two and three hundred Afghans near Gfangan and about two hundred in direction of Jagin, 40 miles to eastward of Jask. Ido not think there are more than five to six hundred Afghans within a radious of 50 miles of the station. Telegram, No. 289, dated the hth (received 6th) April 1908. From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Bushire, To—Foreign, Simla. Following received from Director, Persian Gulf Section of the Indo- European Telegraph Department Begins. Latest reports go to show that there are from 500 to 6b0 Afghans within a radius of 50 miles of Jask and about 60 within a radius of 50°miles of Charbar. You have no doubt opinions of Naval Officers, but it appears to me that if a vessel of war is kept at Charbar and another at Jask until end of arms traffic season, say until end of this month, the question of strengthening detachments at both places is not so pressing as it appeared to be at first. Ends. Naval reports incline me to the same opinion. Addressed Foreign Office; repeated Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division.No. 262 P., dated Karachi, the 30th March 1908 (Confidential).

It appears likely, however, that the Afghans or some of them will proceed to Seistan via Sarbaz. (1) From New, Jask, 128 words, of 25th March. Eighteen Afghans left by mail to-day for Karachi. There are about 200 Afghans in vicinity of old Jask within Also wired 26th. radius of 15 miles with 200 camels. At Kiyai, 15 miles north of Arduri, there are two to three hundred Afghans with about 300 camels. It is also supposed there are four to six hundred Afghans at Jagdan in Bashkard district, about 60 miles north of old Jask. Landings are expected daily at Gangan and Gabreg and relays of Afghans and Baluchis are patrolling coast at intervals of two miles on lookout for boats. Humours ^ that Afghans intend creating trouble emanate from Afghans themselves, and it is not unlikely that the capture of a large consignment would create trouble. (2) From New, Jask, 54 words, of 25th March. Nine Afghans arrived by up mail of 24th, two from Karachi nnd seven from Maskat (four dressed as Also wired 26 th. fakirs and three as Arabs); they all left this evening for Gangan where about 150 Afghans are concentrated near coast with camels.

One boat left Jask last night for Maskat with Afghans and 8 Baluchis; Nacoda Brahim Issa. Seven boats from this coast are due to arrive shortly, two for Gabreg or Khonarak, one for Gabreg, two for Larsh and two for Gangan or Bunji. (4) From Jask Office, 72 words, of 27th March.

Redbreast on the subject of the communication of information regarding the movements of Afghans and expected consignments of arms, etc., on the Mekran Coast. No. 23, dated H.M.S. Redbreast at Maskat, the 23rd December 1907 (Confidential). From —Lieutenant Walter Hose, Commander, H.M.S. Redbreast, To—The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division. I have the honour to submit the following information concerning the arrangements made by the Indo-European Telegraph Department to collect information along the Mekran Coast about the movements of Afghans and expected oonsigments of arms, etc., and for the distribution of this intelligence to His Majesty’s ships engaged in the suppression of the trade. 2. Attached is a tracing taken from Chart No. 38, on which is sketched in the route taken by the land telegraph; red crosses against this indicate the approximate positions of the telephone stations (generally known as “ line- guard stations”) at present installed. The names of these stations are noted at the foot of the tracing with the names of the line-guardsmen in charge, the idea being that if any of His Majesty’s ships wish to make use of them and the particular spot on the line where the line-guardsman is should not be struck, his position may be obtained by asking any passing native for line guard “ so and so ”. 3. On the 20 th instant, I arrived at a point half-way between Tank and Hamadan and landed to find the Bir line-guard station. I found its position correctly marked on the plan made by Mr. New, of the Land Telegraphs, about 1 mile to the eastward of the abrupt end of the Bir range of hills and about 4 miles in from the beach. It may be recognized by two particularly tall telegraph poles a quarter of a mile to the westward of the station, used for spanning the bed of what is known as the Bir River. 4. I met Mr. New, who informed me that he has lately installed a small corps of ten camel sowars, who patrol the Mekran Coast between Jask and Chahbar, gathering information ; whenever any is obtained the sowar repairs to the nearest telephone station and reports in to Jask or Chahbar, and it is then forwarded on to His Majesty’s ships and to the Political Agent at Maskat. 5. As far as the use of the telephone stations by His Majesty’s ships is concerned, it appears to me that the Bir station is the only one likely to prove at all convenient, the others lying too far in shore and the walking exceedingly heavy. I attempted to find the Sadaich station on the 22nd instant, and foundit too far to be at all practicable. The nearest point from which to approach the Bir station is the mouth of the Bir River, but landing here is impossible m any bad weather; however, it may be approached from lank also, where sheltei is to be obtained in a shamal. 6 I think that if advantage is taken of these arrangements made by tbe Indo-European Telegraph Department by ships stationed at Jask or Chahbar, or preferably at both! much unnecessary steaming may b^avoided and a greater chance gained of securing any cargoes leaving Oman than has been the case heretofore.

From— Majob W. G. Geet, I.A., Political Agent at Maskat, To—The Secretaiy to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of letter No. 668, which I have addressed to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. No. 668, dated Maskat, the 8th December 1907 (Confidential). From— Majoe W. G. Geey, I.A., Political Agent at Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to refer to my letter No. 631, dated 18th ultimo, in connection with the participation of Afghans in the arms traffic at Maskat, and to my telegrams of 2nd and 5th instant on the same question. 2. The first party of Afghans have all quitted Maskat, some having pro ceeded to Jask and some to Karachi. It is rumoured that they left Us. 25,000 with Ali Musa for the purchase of arms, and that they have arranged with him for the despatch of such purchases to the Mekran Coast in Baluch dhows. Ali Musa however protests that there is no truth in this, and continues to make the most emphatic promises to have no further dealings with Afghans. A watch is being kept upon his doings, and our agents are on the lookout for any shipments from Maskat or Matrah by Baluchis or others. 3. The embarkation for Karachi of the 36 Afghans who had arrived on the 2nd instant was carried out on the 4th without hitch by the Sultan’s quarantine superintendent. They were much disgusted at having to leave, but were informed plainly that this traffic is now at an end so far as they are con cerned, and were requested to inform their fellows at Karachi and elsewhere that in future it would only be waste of time and money for them to visit Maskat in the hope of acquiring arms and ammunition. 4. The highly satisfactory attitude assumed by His Highness the Sultan in this connection is the result of the action taken by the Prench Government upon the reference made to them regarding the conduct of M. Goguyer in March last. It having been ascertained that an understanding and co-operation exists between Afghans and Baluchis with regard to the acquisition of arms, and the importation of such articles into Persian territory having been prohibited, I hope that it may be possible to make a further reference to the Prench which will result in action being taken to interdict the sale to Mekran Baluchis in addition to Afghans, as suggested in my letter No. 598, dated 2nd ultimo. It might be possible to deal with the traffic to Koweifc and other places in the Persian Gulf in a similar manner whenever the exigencies of the political situation permit, and so, by degrees, to suppress the trade almost entirely. 5.

Grey, Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty^ Consul, Maskat, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward herewith, for your information, a copy of letter No. 689, dated the 16th December 1907, which I have addressed to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. No. 689, dated Maskat, the 16th December 1907. From— Majoe W. G. Geey, Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Maskat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to refer to my telegram of the 10th instant reporting that 53 more Afghans had arrived in Maskat on the 9th, and that it wasHis Highness the Sultan’s intention to cause them to return to Karachi by the mail steamer of the 11th. 2. In accordance with the wishes of His Highness I at first endeavoured to prevent the landing of this party, but the Captain of the British India Steam Navigation Company’s S.S. Nerbudda shewed such fear of their remain ing on board that it was impossible. They were therefore removed to quarantine and duly taken to the Goalpara on Wednesday to he embarked for Karachi. The Commander, after much discussion, declined to embark them, fearing the occurrence of a disturbance between them and 300 Arab passengers whom he had already shipped for India elsewhere. The Afghans were returned to the quarantine, and, at His Highness’s official request, I asked the Commander of the Redbreast kindly to convey them to Karachi. This was arranged, and the Redbreast left on the evening of the 13th. 3. It may be asked why one of certain other courses was not followed with regard to this party, for instance, why they were not placed under restraint by the Sultan and exported in batches by mail steamers. The reply is that the men were not criminals, in fact that by the mere fact of coming to Maskat they had infringed no rule: as they had left Karachi before the former party of their fellow-countrymen had returned to that port, no notice had reached them of the Sultan’s decision no longer to receive them in his territories. It would not have been advisable to attempt their deportation in dhows for obvious reasons, and it appeared better to despatch them in one of His Majesty’s ships than in that of the Sultan, as being a more emphatic, as well as a safer, measure. To allow the Afghans into the town would have been worse than anything, and to deport them to Jask or Chahbar, besides giving them the opportunity to return at once by dhow, would probably have been ^less of a check upon their operations than to cause them to return to their port of embarkation. I trust then that the course taken by me, that of compliance with the request of the Local Government will be considered the best possible in a difficult position which admitted of little or no delay. 4. In regard to the future, I consider that His Highness the Sultan will be empowered, within certain limits, to deal as he thinks proper with any parties of Afghans who may arrive, as they will have received notice from those whose expulsion has already been effected that their presence here is no longer desired. To save trouble locally however, I hope that it is possible to prevent their embarkation for Maskat, at least in any numbers, and that you will see your way to the issue of a notice to the British India Company to such effect, if indeed that has not already been done. 5.

Ten Afghans arrived by the S.S. Dwarha on the 16th and on being informed that they were not allowed to land elected to tranship into the ^Waroonga for Bunder Abbas. It was found however that they had disembarked at Jask whence they proceeded east. To-day none have attempted to disembark here. 3. It is not to be hoped that the prohibition to allow Afghans to enter Oman territory will form a permanent and complete check to the acquisition by them of arms and ammunition; but it serves as a temporary check as it will take time for them to make other arrangements in pi ace of those which have become disorganised. In the meantime it may perhaps be possible to take further measures in Maskat to place obstacles in the way of their operations. 4.

The Government of India are aware that Bahrein is undoubtedly * No. 891, Vide * Residency letter No. 278, dated 2nd Used Sllb VOS&amp; as a flying base for the in secret, hi, December 1906 . illicit transport of arms across to the nS 866 7 93 S. Persian Coast ports opposite; also that arms are habitually imported into Koweit with little attempt to disguise the fact; but neither port is as yet used by the Afghan element, and visits of parties of the latter would at present be sufficiently unusual to at once attract attention, and be reported by our Agents. But the greater the difficulties placed in the smugglers’ way at Maskat, the greater no doubt the likelihood of their having recourse to Bahrein or Koweit, and I have therefore instructed the Political Agents to use special vigilance in this connection. 3 . For us to suggest an interdiction against sale to Afghans in ports where a total prohibition against import and sale already exists would obviously be illogical and indeed to he at all effective action taken must he in the direction of keeping such Afghans away altogether. Even then it is to he feared that as long as arms continue to come, and sufficiently heavy profits are to be got out of the trade, the Afghan buyers without crossing over to Maskat or Koweit will be able to find agents at the ports ready to arrange for the benami purchase and shipment of arms to parties awaiting them on the opposite coast. Any practicable course, however, which is likely to increase the difficulties of the smugglers* either temporarily or permanently, is w r orth pursuing, and it seems advisable that the Sheikhs concerned should be forewarned of the probable tactics of the Afghan and Baluch smugglers and advised of the necessity and best means of circumventing tiiem; but I think the commu nications now made to the Political Agents will suffice for the present; meanwhile the Government of India will perhaps consider the extent to which Sheikhs Esa and Mubarek can be required to deny to such undesirables the hospitality of their ports. No. 151-E.B., dated Fort William, the 14th January 1908. p rom —The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To— Messrs. Mackinnon, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Managing Agents, British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited. The Government of India have received information from the British Political Agent at Maskat to the effect that Afghans are constantly arriving atMaskat by British India steamers from Karachi for the purpose of engaging in the illicit arms trade in the Persian Gulf. 2. The Sultan of Maskat has recently forbidden the Arab arms merchants to sell arms and ammunition to Afghans and, as His Highness does not wish such persons to remain in his territories, he has during the last two months compelled all Afghans arriving in Maskat to return to India. 3. With a view to assist the Sultan in stopping the illicit trade in arms it is very desirable that Afghan traders should, if possible, be prevented from leavin 01 Indian ports for Maskat for the present. I am accordingly to enquire whether Messrs. Mackinnon, Mackenzie &amp; Co., as Agents for the British India Company, would find it possible to issue orders to their Agents at the various ports on the west coast of India prohibiting the sale to persons appearing to be Afghans or frontier Pathans of passenger tickets for Maskat for the present, unless such persons produce satisfactory credentials from a responsible British officer. 4. The British India Company have already^ been so kind as to assist in this matter by preventing the conveyance of illicit arms and ammunition by their steamers in the Persian Gulf and' the issue of the further orders now asked for may be expected to have a useful effect.

I attach a list of those arms which command most sale at present in the Maskat market, with the chief purchasers and current prices. It will be observed that the prices as given therein are slightly higher in certain cases than those given for corresponding weapons by Captain McConaghey in the list supplied by him which formed Appendix F to his letter No. 17-C.P., dated 15th June 1906. The explanation of this is a recent rise in prices owing to reduced demand. 5.

Prideaux, Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to correspondence ending with your letter No. 2756, dated the 29th December 1907, on the subject of the arms smuggling industry, I have the honour to report that by the last up-mail, the S.S. Kasara, which arrived here on the 19th instant, 23 Afghans appeared in Bahrein. 2. I heard of their arrival from the ship’s officer, who landed the mails and who told me that the men had been repulsed from Maskat; I at once summoned the whole party to the Agency, intercepting them with the Bazar- master’s co-operation at the Custom House before they dispersed into the town Sarais. The mail officer had told me that the men were all possessed of tickets for Linga, at which port, however, they had not cared to land in consequence of the roughness of the weather. He remarked that the men need not have left the ship in Bahrein, as the vessel would probably he calling at Linga in about a week’s time without re-visiting this port and another alternative for the .men would have been to exchange into the fast down-mail at Bushire, landing at Bunder Abbas, and thence proceeding to Linga by the up slow-mail which was due to arrive there on the 23rd instant. 3. On the Afghans appearing before me and stating that they had no business to transact in Bahrein, I explained to them the advisability of returning at once to the vessel and following one of the alternative courses suggested by the mail officer. 4. The men evinced great reluctance in complying with my advice, and though I succeeded in getting them all to start out in a sailing boat towards the ship, they managed, intentionally I believe, to miss the vessel. 5. Thereupon I caused the men all to land in front of the Agency, and placed them in a species of open arrest pending the arrival of the next down- mail, which is due here on the 31st instant, and by which if you think it necessary I can be given instructions for any special action to be taken against them. 6. I arranged promptly at the same time that all the 23 men should take up their residence in a small mosque immediately opposite the front gate-way of the Agency, and that they should attend a roll-call three times a day. They were also forbidden to go into the bazaar or to cross over to Muharraq. The whole of their effects were overhauled and their money, which amounted to the large sum of Rs. 99,452-4-9, was carefully counted in the owners’ presence and sealed up in 22 linen bags, which I propose to give hack to the party immediately before they return on hoard. The bulk of the money was in the form of divided notes, which were sewn up in various parts of the men s clothing or carried in their waistbelts. 7. The explanation given by the Afghans for their presence in the Gulf is that some are pilgrims and that others propose to buy camels and generalfj yiigp 1 merchandize in Persia I do howe^ m thoug^y alU^Afghan subjects they can speak Hindustani with consider- able TwTor'three of the men possess Indian account-books (Bahis) whichl shall scrutinize this week^.^ ^ ^ morning after the proceedings were taken against the Ln ( the Chief ttc'?hVd t^n in regard Ibrahim bia Shanda, expressing sa is c hppn able to put them back on to them, coupled with regret that I had not been able to put tnem board the steamer. 1 [Eiler Seer 1 Secretary o: 1 foinmittee |MerSecr(r la any ikirther communica tion on this subject, please quote M.3390. and address letter to— The Secretary, Admiralty, Whitehall, London, S.W. /•A i-i A , ''oi.v Admiralty, 8 th April 190 8 .

Abdu being a British Subjects if T take anything from hin by force the Sircar will be angry with me so please order Abdu Shalu to give up the books to Sanib Kiian. T nave ordered Sahib Khan not to desist from this till he (Sahib Khan) gives up his life and have also ordered him in the event of Abd 11 refusing to comply with my request to take the money from Abdu by force and to give him receipt for all monies taken by him from the customs Seyyed Khan is emboldened on account of Ashraf taking over the Gwettur Customs. (You should receive my letter on this subject to-morrow), t believe if Sahib Khan cannot get any money out of Abdu he intends demanding from the B,T, traders the amounts due by them to customs and giving them receipts for all monies taken. Sahib Khan arrived this afternoon with 15 men and Seyyed Khan’s ’funshie with letter to me, C,C. 23rd Januar 1^08. T hear if Sahib Kiian is successful in getting hold of customs books he intends establishing himself in charge of Chanbar Customs and fas already threatened merchants if he cannot recover money here due by them to customs he will take the amounts from shops or agents up country. Believe Sahib Khan is a man of weak intellect and a cruel rascal andis always employed by Seyyed Khan in looting and in any dirty work he has on hand. I think it high time Abdu Shalu gave up the customs. C.C. Seyyed Khan has also written tnree letters to Abdu Siialu one to Abdu Hussein and one to Ootoonul and Thursianull In all tree he says he has orders from Kerman to take over the customs. Abdu Shalu he gives orders to give up all customs accounts to Sahib Khan otherwise tney will be taken by force. To Abdul Hussein he says to use his influence to Abdu Shalu to give up his accounts quietly otherwise they will be taken by force and if a single Kran is short he will hold Abdul Hussein personally responsible. To Ootoorsjl and Tursiarull he says to pay what they owe to customs to Sahib Khan and to tell all merchants to do the same. Tfthe ' refuse he will send :,iir Islam Khan with 200 men to take the money by force. C.C. Interviewed Sahib Knan. He is young man of about 26 or 28 seems reckless and determined. Said if he takes over customs he will leave his own man in charge if Abdu Kasool refuses to carry on on behalf of Seyyed Khan. I now believe this to be bluff and his present intention is only to loot all the money he can and then clear out. T told him contents of your 80/23. he said Seyyed Khan told him to say if we thwarted him in this customs matter he would consider the Sircar was no longer his friend. C.C. 24th January24th January ]P08. • QyyeJ Khan sent in Hot ' asrnd this Morning with 15 non to Sahib Khan asking if he is dead or alive and why he is so long bringing in the stons money. There are about 50 of Seyyed Khan’s men in the village now and Sahib Khan will surely take and illtreat Abdu Rasool if he persists in refusing to give up the accounts, T have warned Sahib Khan of the consequences if he touches Abdu or any other B.T* subject. He promised to await Resident’s reply but Hot Pasund’s arrival lias precipated matters. I think the best and only thing the Persians can do is to hand over the customs to Seyyed Khan and hold him responsible for all monies until such time as the Persians are in a position to take it over again. At all events Abdu Rasool must leave customs immediately. Sahib Khan is under the impression we are helping the Persians* T t is useless trying to take to him and T fear reprisals up country. C.C* Sahib Khan has taken possession of the Chahbar Customs and account books on behalf of Seyyed Khan and now demands all monies due by B.T. traders to customs. e will grant them receipts in Seyyed Khan’s name who undertakes to be answerable to the Persians. Sahib Khan who has a fairly large following lias just told me personally that if the traders don’t pay up his orders are to take the money by force. T don’t see what else our people can do. C.C. 26th January 1908. Sahib Khan says Governor Kerman authorised Seyyed KhanKhan to collect customs. Your message ms explicitly explained to him in the presence of the Merchants. He absolutely refuses to wait any longer and said Soyyed Khan would be answerable to both Governments. Last evening he summoned British Indian traders to custom house and went through their respective accounts which traders paid under protest receiving correct receipts. Total 3646 krans or a little over 1000 rupees due to customs. Sahib Khan and all his folio^/ers left about midnight leaving nobody behind. C,C. 27th January 1008. Before Sahib Khan left he put a padlock on the custom house and took away the key saving he would send a munshies and ten tofangchees to take charge. Seyyed Khan's people declare they will never allow the Persians or Belgians to establish themselves in the customs here again. There is no one in charge of the customs at present Abdu Rasool resigned and says in future he will only servo as Munshie under a Mu dir.

I received your telegram ( Jo.2) just before sailing and gave 'JjAATLIG ' 1 the necessary orders to proceed to Bombay. Any delay in her leaving Muscat -vas due to the fact that her boilers had been opened up for the quarterly cleaning by my orders. 8 . - I found Mr New at Chahbar and accompanied Mm for three days along the telegraph line, visiting some of the telephone stations, and seeing his Sowar patrol at work. Mr New is very sanguine that this year will see the capture of several stands of arms, and though from what I aav; of the countiy it -would be difficult for any Afghan caravan to assembleunnoticed, the practically unlimited number of places at which the arms carrying craft can land their cargoes renders capture at sea unlikely. However, I agree with Lieutenant S Commander Hose that the scheme instituted seems to be the best yet devised, thoueji, owing to the present di sorganised state of the arms traffic due to the prohibition of Afghans into Muscat, it is early to give can opinion of the Telegraph Patrol system. 9. - Although the British India Company have received instructions not to boo;: Afghan passengers for Muscat, Afghans, varying i;i numbers, continue to arrive by nearly every mail steamer from Karachi, add, although booked for Bunderf X fj'l ~f\ T, V Bund^p Abbc^s^ invar;! ably ondoavour, on oomo protoxt or other - to buy rice for instance - to leave their ship here.

A duplicate of these reports has been forwarded to the Commander-in-chief, and for the information of the Indian Government. For Commander-in-chief (on duty), (Signed) A. W. HENEAGE, Flag Captain, “ Hyacinth,” at Bombay, December 25, 1907. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Captain Hide ley to Commander-in-chief, East Indies. (Confidential.) Sir, “Highflyer,” at Bombay, December 23, 1907. IN compliance with your orders, I have the honour to report that I left Bombay on the 21st November at 6*30 A.M., and proceeded at ordinary speed (11'5 knots) and reduced to economical speed on the 23rd at 8 A.M., intending to arrive at Henjam in the forenoon of the 25th November, on which day I expected “ Sphinx ” would arrive at Bushire. 2. 1 arrived at Henjam at 10*30 a m. on the 25th November, and obtained tele graphic communication with “ Sphinx ” at Bushire on her arrival that afternoon, also with the Resident there, informing the latter of my orders, and asking him for fuither information concerning the pirates at Dayir, also for his advice in dealing with the natives of Davir. I also informed the Resident informally that I hoped he might be able to come in “ Sphinx and join me. ^ 3. On the 26th November I received a telegram from the ‘‘Sphinx suggesting, at the request of the Resident, that the “ Lapwing ” at Muscat should join Redbreast on the Makran Coast for the suppression of^arms traffic. I accordingly ordered “ Lapwing ” there under orders of “ Redbreast.” , _ .. A , , 4. I also received a telegram from “Sphinx” saying that the Resident suggestei visiting Lingah in “ Sphinx,” to obtain further information concerning the pirates ol Dayir and a local guide, to which 1 agreed, and telegraphed that I woul mee “ Sphinx” at Lingah on the 29th November, and telegraphed the intended movements of “ Highflyer ” and “ Sphinx ” to you and the Admiralty. 5. On the 27th November I received a telegram from the Resident at Bushire to the effect that he considered it unadvisable, for political reasons, that ‘ Highflyer [2794 y —2] B2 t I should appear at Lingah. I therefore altered my plans, and arranged to await “ Sphinx's” arrival at Henjam. The Sphinx ” left Bushire on this date, the 27th November for Lingah with the Resident on board. 6. On the 29th November the “Sphinx” joined “Highflyer” at Henjam, bringing the Resident, two natives from Koweit who could identify the pirates, the Native Agent from Lingah, and a Sayyid (an influential man and a descendant of the Prophet) who had been obtained from a dhow at sea, he having volunteered to com The Besident and Commander Litchfield dined with me that night, when we discussed the question of the pirates of Dayir, and I decided that “ Sphinx ” should leave the following day to obtain another witness from Shiwu, the sole survivor of the Persian dhow which had been pirated in November 1906, also to obtain a dhow from Lingah or elsewhere in which to land the Native Agent and Sayyid at Dayir, to obtain further necessary information. I also decided that “ Highflyer ” should leave Henjam for a rendezvous off Dayir on the 1st December. 7. On the 30th November I went on board “ Sphinx,” and held a further consul tation, when the Native Agent from Lingah and the Sayyid were interviewed, and decided that “ Sphinx ” should leave at once for Dayir and obtain further information of the whereabouts of the pirates, &amp;c., through the Sayyid and Native Agent, who would be landed there in the dhow at night, also to find out— 1. If the Khan of Dayir had harboured or was harbouring the pirates ; 2. The feeling of the natives towards the pirates; 3. To obtain local guides from Dayir. As the Native Agent would require two days at Dayir, I decided to postpone my departure until the 4th December, and to join “Sphinx” off Ras Naband on the 5th December, by which time the dhow should have returned from Dayir, Ras Naband being chosen as a rendezvous in order that “ Highflyer ” should not appear near Dayir before the proper moment, as her presence in that locality would immediately arouse suspicion, and it was absolutely necessary to obtain all possible information secretly. 8. During our consultation the action to be taken at Dayir was fully discussed. Ft was presumed that the natives of Dayir would not oppose us, but it was fully recognized that they would not give any information immediately they suspected that any active measures v^ere being taken against the pirates, for fear of future treatment at the hands of the Khans of Dashti and Dayir (father and son), who without doubt have harboured these desperadoes. The Resident, Native Agent, and the Sayyid agreed with my suggestion that if sufficient evidence was obtained that the Khans were cognizant of, or had connived at, the presence of the pirates in or near Dayir, or refused to hand them over, strong measuies should be taken to bring them to understand their responsibilities, and 1 suggested that in the latter contingency the fort in which the Khan of Dayir lived should be knocked down by gun fire, due warning having been given to the inhabitants. The broad outline of this action commended itself to the Resident, the Native Agent, and the Sayyid, who all said that it would have a more beneficial and lasting effect on the community titan the perhaps evil effects of attacking and burning a village, with the attendant possibilities of innocent blood being shed. 9. Ihi Resident came on board “ Highflyer,'’ and the “ Sphinx” left at 1 p.m. on the 30th for Lingah and Dayir. I ordered the “ Lapwing ” front Jask to Bunder Abbas on the 30th to be at the disposal of the Consul there, as the Resident had received a telegiam saying that the people there were inclined to panic, owing to a threatened attack h} nomad tribes from inland. I have heard nothing more on the subject and the “ Lapwing ” has returned to the Makran Coast. 10. Dining my stay at Henjam from the 25th November to the 3rd December anded the small-aim companies, fully equipped, and the field and machine-guns on several occasions tor drill, which the officers and men much enjoyed in the delightful weather at this time of the year. i r 1 !/ ° n th , e 4th December at 6 a m. I left Henjam, and arrived off Ras Naband at ayligln on the 5th, where “Sphinx ’ awaited my arrival, and as a strong shamal was blowing, and the dhow had not arrived from Dayir, and it was impossible under existing conditions to anchor off Dayir, I took shelter under the lee of Sheik Shuaib Island, anchoring at 5 p.m., “ Sphinx ” arriving later in the evening. 12. On the 6th December “ Highflyer ” weighed at 8 a.m., the weather having moderated, and proceeded to Ras Naband, the “ Sphinx ” having proceeded there at o a.m. 1 found the dhow at 1 p.m. and communicated with her, the Native Agent coming on board bringing information that the pirates had left Dayir or its vicinity id sed tk 1 mktioda on 13.

It was reported that they had gone to Ganawa (Kanawa on chart), 50 miles to northward of Bushire, they having sworn to the Khan of Bandar Rig (a place close to) that they would live peacefully in that locality. This information Avas obtained from an owner of a dhow (a nakhoda) at Dayir, whose relatives had been t ’ ‘ 1 led by the pirates, by the Native Agent, and the Sayyid before mentioned. Having uotained this information, I proceeded at once to Dayir (leaving the hired dhow to be towed there by “ Sphinx”), where I arrived at 7 p.m. ; the “ Sphinx ” arrived later, and sent the Native Agent on shore that night to try and get the above-mentioned nakhoda on board. 13. On Saturday, the 7th December, the nakhoda having arrived on board in the morning, a further consultation was held on board “ Highflyer,” the Resident, Commander Litchfield, and the Native Agent being present; the nakhoda stated that he had received a message front one of the pirates to the effect that he (the pirate) regretted having killed the nakhoda’s relations, and that he had no idea that the murdered men were any relation to the nakhoda. The nakhoda had recently visited Ganawa, where he had exchanged visits with the pirates, and had accepted their hospitality; he further stated that he was now a friend of the pirates and could now help us, and that he hoped with God’s help that the pirates would be caught. 14. Similar circumstances now presented themselves at Bandar Rig or Ganawa to those which had existed at Dayir, which were fully discussed, and a similar conclusion was arrived at regarding the action to be taken with the Khan of Bandar Rig as had been arrived at regarding the Khan of Dayir, and that similar pressure should be brought to bear on Bandar Rig. The “ Sphinx ” then left Dayir for a rendezvous off Bandar Big, and I went on shore with the Resident and paid a visit to the Khan of Dayir. Major Cox and I having agreed to tell him that it was lucky for him that the pirates were not there, as we should have considered him equally culpable with the pirates if he had harboured them, and Major Cox fully and forcibly pointed out to him his responsibilities in harbouring pirates or conniving at acts of piracy, to which he made fatuous replies, denying, of course, any connection with the pirates, and assuring us of his ready assistance in their arrest at any time. This Khan of Dayir is, in my opinion, a liar, and his father, the Knan of Dashti (the district in which Dayir is), is probably no better than his son, and they are equally culpable in the haibouring of the pirates subsequent to the piracies in November 1906 and January 1907. 15. 1 returned on board at 3 p.m., and sailed immediately for a rendezvous off Bandar Rig, where 1 arrived at daybreak on the 8th December with “ Sphinx ” on company, and anchored as close to the shore as possible (8,000 yaids for High flyer,” and 2,500 yards for “ Sphinx”), but, had it been necessary, I think I could have anchored 3,000 yards off temporarily on arising tide. I landed about 11 a.m. to see the Khan, with Commander Litchfield, Lieutenant Collins, my First Lieutenant, and the Residency dragoman as interpreter, having previously arranged with Major Cox a verbal ultimatum for the Khan of Bandar Rig, in which I forcibly and clearly pointed out to him that the sons of Humaidi, the pirates, were now at Ganawa Avith their families with his knowledge, that I had been ordered by the British Government to arrest them, and that l had come to warn him that, as he was harbouring and had given shelter to these pirates, he had placed himself m the unenviable position ol being regarded as equally culpable with them, and under these circumstances my orders would warrant my taking extreme measures to punish him as well as them but before doing so however I would give him this brief opportunity oi co-operating with me in effectino- the’ pirates’ immediate capture (before sunset that day), fading which he must accept the consequences. I then called on him to tell me at once what methods he nronosed to adopt! The Khan appeared to he much upset by these summary measures, and HZn to vacillate, and at first said he would do nothing without orders from the Persian Government, to which I replied that my orders were peremptory, and that I had no intention of waiting for him to receive any orders or to communicate with his Government which argument appeared to appeal to him, and after an hour s interview the kC promised to arrest the pirates forthwith, and as it was now noon and time was important, he having 10 miles or so to go to Ganawa the interview ended, as I had every reason to believe that the Khan was thoroughly frightened. i r . nP p arranged for a signal from the shore to be made by the Khan if he had cauo-ht the pirates, “and then returned on board The “ Highflyer ” and “ Sphinx ” weighed at 2 30 P.M., and on seeing a flag hoisted on the port at Ganawa at about q P M anchored off that place at 4 p.m. I landed at once with Lieutenant Cohms and M^oi Cox in a cutter manned and armed, picking up a cutter en route from Sphinxalso manned and armed. We were received by the Khan on landing, and after a brief discussion two of the pirates were handed over to ns, one pirate haung escaped inland. We then proceeded on board, having seized the dhow belonging to the pirates 17 1 left the following morning, with “ Sphinx in company, lor Bushire (the Sphinx” towing the captured dhow), where I arrived at 11 a.m. (9tli December). The pirates are now in cells (9th December) on board, and I have handed the dhow over' - to the custody of the Resident. , . -l ht • 18. 1 be- to bring to your notice the valuable assistance given me by Major Cox, who came to join me at great personal inconvenience. I have no hesitation in saying that through his intimate knowledge of Persian Gulf affairs and its people, coupled with his invaluable advice, we were enabled to bring our search for the pirates to a successful conclusion. 1 have already written to Major Cox thanking him tor his services.^ I would also bring to your notice, for the information of the Indian Government, the valuable assistance rendered by the Native Agent at Lingab, who obtained the necessary information secretly which led up to the eventual ancst of the pirates. 19. Commander Litchfield’s hearty co-operation was also of the greatest assistance. 20. I beg to submit for your favourable consideration the attached list of expenses in connection with the search tor and capture otthe pirates, which money I have handed over to Major Cox for distribution, having first thoroughly discussed with him and agreed to the various charges as being reasonable. The services of the dhow for a week were absolutely necessary, as all information had to be obtained secretly. All the witnesses volunteered their services on promise of pecuniary reward, provided their identity was not revealed to any one, particular]} to the pirates, as they feared ictaliation from the latter in the event of their possible release or escape from the fate which I sincerely hope awaits them. The services of the Sa} T yid and nakhoda were of the greatest assistance. The nakhoda also piloted our boats into the Khors of Bandar Kig and Ganawa, which was no easy matter, particularly at the latter place. 21. I omitted to state that during my interview w r ith the Khan of Bandar Rig he asked me how he would be rewarded if he captured the pirates and handed them over to me. 1 replied that his reward would he immediate, as in that case I should not have to resort to extreme measures ; and I added, “ If you comply with my demands ’’ (to hand the pirates over before sunset that evening), “ I will bring your good services to the favourable notice of the British Government, also your own.” I trust that my assurances to him will meet with your approval, and that you will be pleased to forward them in the proper direction. 22. During my stay at Bushire I enjoyed the hospitality of the Resident there, and I was able to discuss the various matters in connection with the fate of the pirates. Many telegrams passed between the Resident, the Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, &amp;c. Major Cox and I were fully agreed that, as these pirates are clearly so notorious all over the Gulf, and from the evidence we had of their guilt, we were fully justified in insisting on their immediate public execution at Bushire without further delay or discussion, and so promote maritime peace and our prestige all over the Gulf. However, after many telegrams had been exchanged, permission was obtained to hand the pirates over to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and on the 15th December I transferred them to the “ Sphinx,” which ship, having embarked the Resident, left at 5 p.m. for Mohammerah, with orders to call at Koweit en route, as Major Cox wished to see the Sheikh of Koweit before going to Mohammerah. I ordered Commander Litchfield to place himself at the disposal ot the Resident, and to comply with his requests as to the disposal of the pirates, and then to return to Bushire, and if possible to leave there in time to arrive at Kurrachee on the 27th, in accordance with your orders. 23. On the 12th December I received a telegram from the “ Redbreast” at Muscat, saying : f ‘Fifty-three Afghans had arrived there to buy arms and ammunition. The Sultan refuses to allow them to remain, and a British Indian steamer has refused to take them to Kurrachee. Consul asks me to do so. Am I to comply ? ” I fully discussed the matter with Major Cox, and I pointed out to him that, except under very urgent circumstances, I did not consider that a man-of-war should be called on to do such duties, and I telegraphed to the “Redbreast”: . Suggest Afghans should be dispatched in a dhow r , or detained by Sultan and sent in batches by mail-steamer. In any case I required further details as to urgency before sanctioning ‘ Redbreast ’ being used,” as I did not consider (1) that a man-of-war should be used ; (2) that a gun-hoat 'as a suitable ship to employ. On the following day (13th) I received the following reply from Lieutenant and Commander Hose of “ Redbceast Consul informs me Sultan unable to detain Afghans. Consul fears disturbances at any time now quarantineis finished. Deportation in dhows impossible. If Afghans break or are allowed out of quarantine station to nwait next mail, arms and ammunition will be purchased, and further arrangements will be made for their transport to the Makran Coast.” Major Cox also received a telegram from Major Orey, saying 'that Senior '5^aval Officer demurs at m^y request to send Afghans in ( Redbreast ’; please urge him to give pessary orders,” or words to that effect. I then wired to “ Redbreast ” : . . . Difficult understand why Sultan cannot detain fifty unarmed men in his forts pending expulsion ; but if, after communication with Consul, their immediate expulsion is urgent, you are to comply with his request. ‘ Lapwing’ left .Task to-day for Muscat.” To which “ Redbreast ” replied: “ . . . . Consul considers immediate deportation absolutely necessary. Leaving for Kurrachee.” 24. I trust that my action (of which I informed you by wire) in this matter has met with your approval, for I fully realize my responsibilities and those of the Commanding Officer of “ Redbreast ” in allowing such a large number of Afghans (probably truculent) to be embarked on board a gun-boat. However, as Lieutenant and Commander Hose did not protest as to the possibility of taking the Afghans in “ Redbreast,” I gave him an order to comply with the request of the Consul. 25. While at Bushire, “ Highflyer ” attempted to coal on three consecutive days, but the weather made it impossible until the third day (Sunday, 15th), when I received 180 tons with difficulty, and sailed that day for Shargah, where the Resident had asked me to call with a view to sending a letter to the Native Agent there, and also to show the flag, which the Resident assured me would stiffen the Sheikh’s back in connection with the oxide mine at Abu Musa Island, with which circumstances I understand that you are acquainted. I arrived off Shargah on the morning of the 17th December, and, having heard .that the Native Agent there was ill, I sent a letter from the Resident on shore, and sailed shortly afterwards for Muscat, where I arrived at 9.30 a.m. on the 18th and coaled, receiving 180 tons. #####* 27. The Royal Indian Mail steam-ship “ Lawrence” arrived on the 18th December with the Agent to the Viceroy and Governor-General in Baluchistan (Sir Henry McMahon), on whom I called. Sir Henry returned my call the following forenoon, and was saluted on leaving “ Highflyer ” with thirteen guns. I left for Bombay at noon that day (19th), having ordered “ Sphinx” to resume the duties of Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf. 28. During my short stay at Muscat l discussed with Major Grey the question of the Afghans who had been taken to Kurrachee in “ Redbreast,” and Major Grey informed me that the principal reason for not detaining the Afghans in custody at Muscat was that they had not committed themselves in any way in coming to or since their arrival at Muscat, as they had stated that they did not know that Muscat was closed to them. Major Grey told me that ignorance on that point would not be accepted in the future, and that any steamer bringing Afghans to Muscat would have to take them away or transfer them to another ship for that purpose. I submit for your favourable consideration that the British India Steam-ship Company may be informed of existing conditions at Muscat, with a view to their not taking Afghans there, and so avoid further complications and the necessity of His Majesty s ships being called on to carry out expulsion duties, which u Redbreast ” recently had done. Whether dis turbances would have taken place at Muscat it the fifty-three Afghans had been allowed in the town I do not know, but I think that His Highness the Sultan should be prepared to deal with any disturbances in Muscat caused by fifty unarmed men. # ^ * * * * # 30. “Highflyer” arrived at Bombay at 7 a.m. this day.

IN continuation of my general letter of the 3rd November, 1907,1 have the honour to report that I left Bushire at PSOp.m. on the 5th November, arrived at the outer buoy, Shatt-al-Arab, at 8‘15 a.m. the 6th November, and proceeded up the river to Mohammerah. In the afternoon I called upon His Majesty’s Consul, who returned my call next morning. He could give me no recent news of the Humaidi pirate gang, but when last heard of they were still at Dayir. 2. I proceeded up the river to Bussorah early on the 8th November, mooring off dhe Consulate at 10 a.m. I found the Turkish cruiser “ Key of the Ocean ” and Royal Imperial Majesty’s gun-boat &lt;£ Comet ” there, the latter having lately returned from Ahwaz. Ships were dressed in honour of the national festival which celebrates the conclusion of Ramadan. I dressed ship upon anchoring. There was some difficulty in obtaining pratique, the quarantine officer at first imposed two days’ quarantine, owing to the ship having been to Muscat within the last month. I was, however, able to persuade him to grant us pratique in the afternoon. His Majesty’s Consul was away at Bagdad. I notified the Wali and Commodore of my intention to dress ship next morning in honour of the birthday of His Majesty the King, and that I would call upon them early. 3. On the 9th November 1 dressed ship in honour of His Majesty’s birthday, and paid an early carl upon the Wali and Commodore. The Turkish cruiser “ Comet ” and most of the steamers in the port also dressed. I he N\ ali and Commodore duly returned my call later in the day, and offered felicitations upon the occasion we were celebrating. The port officer also called. In the absence of His Majesty’s Consul, who usually holds a reception on this day, 1 invited the British community off to the ship to honour His Majesty’s health. 4. The ship coaled on the 12th November, 135 tons of coal being obtained from Messrs. Strick and Co., the only firm able to supply me, the price arranged was ol rupees 14 annas per ton, which is about 4^ rupees cheaper than Government rate at Bushire. Ihe coal, howe.er, though demanded as Welsh and described on the supply note as North Welsh, proved to be of an inferior quality, and is certainly not best Welsh steam coal. 1 have written to Messrs. Strick and Co. with regard to the matter. o. 1 proceeded to Mohammerah on the 13th to await the arrival of the mail con- veying Mr. O Keefe, Chief Artificer Engineer, one A.B., and two lascars, and thus avoid the five days’ quarantine that would have been imposed had 1 received these passengers from the mail at Bussorah. I would suggest that naval passengers for ships in the river be in all cases booked to Mohammerah.On the 14th I went with His Majesty’s Consul to visit Sheikh Khazal. He had had noitcent news of the pirates, who appear to have laid low at Dayir since the attack on the Koweit dhow in February, and he assumed that they were still at Dayir. I had intended to ^o down to hao for a few days, but Mr. McDouall informed me jhat the majority of the dhows had cleared for the south on the 11th apd 12th, and that \JM ;i aw no immediate necessity for a ship near the bar. I therefore returned to Bussorah on the 15th, and found that Mr. Crow, His Majesty’s Consul, had returned. It was arranged that Sheikh Hhazal should return my call when I next visited Mohammerah, as he was suffering from a cold and his launch was under repairs. 6. Mr. Cron informed me that a strong protest had been made to the Porte by His Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople, with reference to the uncivil treatment of the Commanding Officer of “Lapwing” at Katif. The Wall of Bussorah had been instructed to inquire into the matter, with a view to the punishment of the offending officials. Mr.^ Crow informed me that a shortage of dates of some kinds had resulted in high prices, and that consequently the number of dhows returning to the river for the second date season about the middle of December might be expected to be less than usual. * W * * * 8. On the 20th November I was informed that the Sheikh of Zubeir, a town about 10' west of Bussorah, had been murdered with two of his people that afternoon in the bazaar at Bussorah. r I he Turkish troops were called out to quell the disturbance which followed. 9. On the 21st November, at 4-50 p.m., I received your telegram directing me to proceed to Koweit to obtain men who can identify the Humaidi pirates and after wards proceed to Bushire to place myself under the orders of the “ Highflyer. , ’ My proceedings subsequent to the receipt of your telegram have been reported to Captain Hickley, of His Majesty’s ship “ Highflyer,” who has relieved me as Senior Officer in the Gulf upon joining him at Henjam this day. A copy of that letter is attached. 10. The telegraphic communication with Bussorah by land lines proved to be more efficient than I was led to believe, but it appears to be subject to temporary interruptions, due to weather or Arabs cutting the wire. Your telegram No. 55, consisting of fifty-seven groups, came through in about thirty hours, with only two slight errors. The line was interrupted very soon afterwards on account of heavy rain in the north, ami I am doubtful whether you received my acknowledgment before the report of my arrival at Bushire. 11. As regards the movements of the other ships of the division, “ Lapwing” left Bunder Abbas at 5 p.m., 24th October, and arrived at Muscat early on the 26th October, where she embarked Major Grey, and left for Sur the same evening. Major Grey was unable to trace the Somali arms he went to Sur to find, and “ Lapwing’' returned to Muscat on the 28th October. Between the 28th October and the 5th November some urgent defects in engine- room were made good, and on the 6th November I ordered her to Kurrachee to clean boilers and generally overhaul her machinery. She arrived on the 9th, and returned to Muscat on the 27th, with orders to leave for the north on the 28th, in readiness to relieve me in the river. Owing, however, to the Resident’s request for a second ship on the arms traffic as soon as possible, she has been temporarily diverted to assist “ Redbreast ” on this service 12. I left “Redbreast” at Bushire on the 5th November, with orders to embark Mr. Bill, First Assistant to the Besident, and convey him to Abu Musa and Ras-al- Khaima, afterwards proceeding to Muscat. The object of the Abu Musa visit was to see if all was quiet there, and to reassure the Sheikh’s people. It, however, transpired that the Sheikh’s guard had vacated the island, and the “Redbreast” proceeded to Shargah, where Mr. Bill obtained a promise from the Sheikh to send over a fresh guard at once. Mr. Brown, the German Agent, has been in Bushire interviewing the German Consul about the Abu Musa Concession, and has also, I understand, been endeavoming to frighten the Sheikh of Shargah. . At Ras-al-Khaima it was found that the slave-dealer referred to in paragraph 5 ot-8 my letter of the 14th October had returned to Khabura, and I understand that, being once more in the territory of the Sultan of Muscat, His Highness is to be requested to cause his arrest. 13. “ Redbreast ” arrived at Muscat on the 15th -November, her orders being to assist Political Agent in any further steps to be taken with regard to the Somali arms and then to proceed to the Mekran Coast for the suppression of the arms traffic. She left Muscat for Sur on the 16th to make further inquiries about Soml arms reported to be located there, but returned to Muscat without success on the 18th. “Redbreast” visited Sur again, with Major Grey, on the 24th. Major Grey &lt;had obtained authority from the Sultan to forcibly seize the arms whicli has been located in a house at West Sur, but it was found that the Mullah’s agents had got away for Itas-al-Khaii, Somaliland, three days previously with 400 rifles. The affair is now closed for this year, so far as this division is concerned. “ Redbreast’s ” report states that Political Agent wired to the Resident at Aden notifying the departure of the arms for Ras-al-Khail. 14. I told Lieutenant and Commander Hose to make the best arrangements he could with Mr. New for the supply of information as to the movements of arms runners. 15. There appears lo be considerable keenness for signalling in the British India and Strick steamers, and some ships have a very fair efficiency. They seldom lose an opportunity of exercise when we fall in with them. 16. I regret to report two cases of beri-beri. The first developed the day I left Bushire, the 5th November, the patient being an able seaman. As neither of the medical officers of “ Sphinx ” or “ Redbreast ” had previously seen a case of beri-beri, I obtained the services of Captain Williams, I.M.S., attached to the Residency, to confirm their diagnosis and advise as to treatment. I was advised to keep the man on board, as he would thus have a better chance, especially in view of the change of climate to be expected in the river. The man has been accommodated in a canvas house on the upper deck and has progressed satisfactorily. I had all the rice on board examined, and some doubtful-looking rice in the canteen, the only rice stowed forward, thrown overboard. That rice had not, however, been issued. The mess deck and canteen were then disinfected. No further cases occurred until the 24th instant, when a Lascar stoker serang was found to be suffering from the disease, and already in too critical a condition to be discharged from the ship had opportunity offered. With the exception of a few cases of fever, the health of the officers and men is otherwise very good. I have, &amp;c.

(Confidential.) j r y T “ Sphinx,” at Henjam, November 29, 1907. , HAvE the honour to report my proceedings since receiving Commander-in- c lets telegram at T'SO p.m. on the 21st November, directing me to proceed to Roweit and obtain through the Political Agent some of Sheikh Mubarrek’s men who can i entity the piratical gang of Abdullah-bin-Humaidi, and afterwards proceed to Busnire to find instructions as to a rendezvous with you. ., ^ Bussorah at 11 a.m. the 22nd November, with the object of catching the mi n ^ght tide over the bar and crossing the bar should the moon serve. I arrived at xao 7 4o p.m., and anchored to wait for the rise of the tide. i V 1 ^ ie i ^ me ^ should have proceeded, the moon was obscured by heavy clouds, which showed no signs of dispersing, and there was insufficient light for picking up the buoys. I therefore decided to wait for the next day tide. v ^‘ M * on ^ je ^3rd November I proceeded across the bar, and anchored at owei m ie innei anchorage at 8'45 p.m., the moon rising just in time to enable me to pick up the buoys.‘ 4. As it would be too late to interview the Sheikh that night, [ deferred landing until 7 A.M. the next morning, the 24th November, when I called upon Major Knox, Political Agent, and went with him to see Sheikh Jabir, eldest son of Sheikh Mubarrek, who was unfortunately away hunting in the interior, and could not be communicated with without delaying my departure some days. ^ Sheikh Jabir showed some hesitation to act in his father’s absence, but finally jnsented to send with me two men who could recognize the piratical sons of Abdullah- bin-Humaidi. The names of these Koweit men are Hussein-bin-Bathir and Akbir-bin-Mahomed. They are both of Persian extraction, born and brought up in Koweit, and are seamen by profession. They last saw the sons of Abdullah-bin-Humaidi in Bussorah and Mohammerah about four years ago, but say they can easily recognize them. They would not, however, be prepared to identify the pirate’s crew. It appears that the crew is constantly changed, a fresh one being collected for each expedition. Sheikh Jabir said that he knew of no one in Koweit who could identify the pirate’s crew, or who had local knowledge of Dayir. The two men I have brought have been to Dayir, but have not landed there. I could obtain no definite information as to the present whereabouts of the pirates, but when last heard of they were reported to be at Dayir. 5. When at Mohammerah, a few days before receiving Commander-in-chief’s telegram, Sheikh Khazal and Mr. McDouall, His Majesty’s Consul, gave me similar information. Neither had received any recent news of the movements of the pirates. Sheikh Khazal thought they would probably be still at Dayn*. 6 Having embarked the two Koweit men, 1 left Koweit at 2 , 30 p.m., and amved and anchored off Bushire at 130 p.m. the 25th November. I landed as soon as pratique was obtained to see the Besident, and called at the telegraph station on the way, finding your first telegram from Henjam awaiting me, and that you happened to be in the office at Henjam. After communicating with you I went on to see the Resident, who expressed his readiness to accompany me in accordance with your desire, provided 1 would wait ti after the arrival of the mail on the '.:7th The Resident suggested that it would be desirable to visit Lingah as a first step to obtain further information from the Native Agent there as to the present whereabouts of the pirate, and of the boy Ali-bin-Ibrahim, the sole survivor of the massacred crew of the Persian dhow, and also a man familiar with the country around Dayir. 7. Having replied to your telegram I proceeded to the inner anchorage eaily on the 26th November to complete with coal, receiving 50 tons. j n i 8. At 4*30 p.m. on the 27th November, having embarked the Resident ana ba ^rs for “ Highflyer,” I sailed for Lingah and Henjam, bringing with me also your mails, which arrived that morning. I instructed the postmaster to retain mails tor ig yer an “ Sphinx ” at Bushire until further orders. 9. I arrived at Lingah 7'15 A.M. this morning. 1 . , , . The Native Agent came off immediately, and Major Cox explained our business. The Agent said that the man who could give us the most assistance was a Pemam Sejyid named Abdul Qahir, who had gone over to Basidu on behalf of the Gover Lingah to escort the Mullah, who was recently banished by the Deiya Begi and took refuge at Basidu, but was now permitted to return to Linga . avoid The Seyyid and his party were expected to return to Lingah to-day. To avo d waste of tune in^vaiting'for the Seyy/l decided to proceed to any native craft I met on the way. I weighed at 8 20 am., and after proceeding 10 easUaid fell in with the dhow containing the Seyyid a PV vid The Native Agent was sent on board the dhow and brought back the beyy . 10. The Seyyid was quite willing to accompany us, and appears to he very keen the and his people know the houses in which the pirates and their relatives live at Batunah, about o'west ^ H« h ^“ h ^Xow who Uve be i,rocured as a witness at Shiloh^ g id returned from a visit to Bushire by last mail.

I then proceeded at lO^O a.m. direct for Henjam to communicate with you and report progress. The Native Agent subsequently informed the Resident that there is a Seedie at Lingah who at one time was a slave in the house of the pirates. It may be useful to pick this man up at Lingah on the way north. U5. I have two cases of beri-beri on board, one being a European. ■ j have &amp;c (Signed) ’ SHIRLEY LITCHFIELD Inclosure 6 in No. 1.

Sir, “Redbreast,” at Muscat, November 18, 1907. I HAVE the honour to submit the following Report on the various matters in connection with which I carried Mr. Bill, First Assistant Resident, to Abu Musa, and to ports on the Trucial Oman Coast, in accordance with your sailing orders of the 5th November, 1907. 2. I left Bushire at 2 p.m. on the 7th instant, and arrived at Abu Musa on the 9th. On landing with Mr. Bill we found that the Sheikh of Shargah had established no guard on the island, that several utensils for the working of the oxide were still there, and a heap of oxide piled near the beach containing by approximate measurement 200 tons. At Mr. Bill’s request 1 sent the armourer and carpenter’s mate ashore to take a cart to pieces, and also landed a fiagstaff to enable the Sheikh of Shargah to hoist his flag over the oxide works. 3. Leaving Abu Musa at 6 p.m., I arrived at Shargah at 9*30 the same evening, and at 8 a.m. the following day landed with Mr. Bill, who interviewed the Sheikh in the British Residency’s Native Agent’s house. After many difficulties had been put in the way and excuses made by the Sheikh, Mr. Bill eventually got him to promise to send a guard to Abu Musa forthwith, and I kept the ship at Shargah until the party were seen to start at daylight on the 11th ; then embarking Issa-bin-Abdul Atif (the Native Agent’s son), I proceeded to Umm-al- Kawain and anchored off the place at 8 - 45 a.m. 4. The object of Mr. Bill’s \isit to Umm al-Kawain was to obtain from the Sheikh the release of a Somali slave whom he had bought from Oman. Mr. Bill and I landed immediately after anchoring, but on getting ashore we were informed that the Sheikh was out hunting. However, messengers were sent after him, and we waited till 11’30, by which time Mr. Bill considered the Sheikh ought certainly to have returned. Not having done so, Mr. Bill and I went back to the ship, leaving Issa-bin-Abdul Atif on shore with a message from the tormer to the Sheikh that he must repair on board the “ Redbreast on his return, also that he must bring the slave with him or he would not be received. At 2 p.m. the Sheikh arrived on board with the slave, and full of apologies tor his inability to get back to his house in time to see Mr. Bill there. The Sheikh surrendered the slave, and left the ship at 3 p.m., upon which 1 gave him the authorized salute of three sums. 5. As it was then too late to reach Ras-al-Khaima before dark, I remained at Umm-al-Kawain till 5 a.m. the next day (12th), and reached Ras-al-Khaima at 9'30 a.m. I landed with Mr. Bill and Issa-bin-Abdul Atif, the latter proceeding into the town to make inquiries re a Beluchi, called Ghulam Shah, a slave dealer, who was believe ! to ha\e been in the place a short time previously, if not there then.

Six* ’ r ttavi? i . , ' ReMreastfi at Muscat, November H f ^ tb e honour to report that on mj arrival at Muscat on the 15th instant I was requested by the Political Agent to embark the Agency dragoman and proceed to Sm, and make investigations re the arrival there of an agent of the Mad Mulfah, named Hamed-bin-Shirwa, with a consignment of rifles for final transport to Somaliland 2. In accordance with this request, I left Muscat at 10 p.m, the 16th, and arrived at Sui at daylight on the 17th. I landed at T’SO with the Agency dragoman, Said Maliommed, and, with my interpreter, Hadji Abdullah, I went first to see the Hindoo Banyan Geviam, who had sent the news of the arrival of Hamed-bin-Shirwa at Sur, and ivas told by him that the “Somali ’ had sailed that morning about 3 a.m. On beino- pressed tor proof of this, he produced several witnesses, whose evidence, however seemed somewhat contradictory. Still, the majority of the evidence was in favour of his aving sailed, and that, taken with the Banyan’s positive assurances of the fact, induced me to get away in chase, since, if the statement was true, it was of the utmost importance to get away without delay; and, if it were false, any other inquiries concerning Mamed could be prosecuted on my return. 3. 1 got away at 10T5 and proceeded full speed round Ras-al-Hadd, and at 2 p.m. overhauled four bedans which I stopped and boarded. It turned out that these had left bur at / a.m., and consequently it seemed impossible that if Hamed had left Sur at 3 a.m., as stated by Geiram, that I could overhaul him before dark ; also, the nakhodas and crews of bedans said they had seen Hameds boat in the Khor at Sur the previous evening, and weie inclined to think he had not sailed before them that morning. On this I ileteimined to return to Sur, and got there at 5 p.m. I then landed again with Said Mahommed and Hadji Abdullah and interviewed Geiram a second time. He informed me that he had ascertained positively in the meantime that Hamed’s bedan vvas still in the Khor; that he had started out that morning, but the sight of the “Redbreast” had driven him in again. The latter part of this statement I found to be absolutely untrue when I saw the unprepared state of the bedan for any voyage. I went to her after leaving the “ Banyan.” She was entirely empty, and was lying alongside another Somali boat two-thirds laden with rice and dates. The owner and nakhoda of this boat, a Somali named Mahmud Mahommed, appeared on the scene and claimed ownership to Hamed’s boat as well, saying he bought her from Salah-bin-Sheikh, of Sur, a few days ago. I had the cargo of Mahmud’s boat (sambuk) overhauled, but found nothing suspicious. L After my examination of the boats I went to visit Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Salim, who assured me he had come from Jaalan to Sur entirely over this arms running affair, and had issued orders to the effect that none of his people were to countenance it or to allow any arms to leave the place. He was leaving Sur again the next day, but promised to leave some one to see his orders carried out. 5. AVhile with Sheikh Abdullah a man called Jumma-bin-[?] arrived, and told Said Mahommed that Hamed-bin-Shirwa had imported 400 rifles into Sur, and now had them hidden in the house of one Nasr-bin-Khamis, in West Sur; that Hamed had'X.. 12 intended leaving Sur before this, but had been detained by the illness of jNasr-bin-Khamis, and that they proposed sailing together in two days or so ; that their destination was Ras-al-Khail on the Somali Coast; that Hamed had bought the bedan from Salah-bin- Shaikh for 200 rupees, but in the name of Mahmud Mahommed and not his own. 6. I debated whether to search IsTasr-bin-Khamis’ house, but decided to consult the Political Agent first, since there would be time to return again for this purpose, and ' seemed perhaps advisable to have some representative of the Sultan (or some author from him) if possible, to accompany one in such a proceeding. j 7. 1 left Sur at 0 p.m., 17th, arriving at Muscat the following morning 8 o’clock. The Sultan being absent from Muscat, the Political Agent has not thought advisable to take any further proceedings with regard to searching the house of Nasr- IN continuation of my report on the Mad Mullah’s agent, Hamed-bin-Shirwa, I have the honour to submit the following:— 2. On the 22nd instant I was requested by the Political Agent to convey him to Sur, as he had obtained an order from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to the Sheikh of Sur to hand over Hamed-bin-Shirwa to him. 3. I left Muscat with Major Grey on hoard at 4 a.m. (24th), and arrived at Sur 4. Major Grey, on landing, received information that Hamed-bin-Shirwa had left Sur three days beforehand. 5. I left Sur at 8 p.m. the same evening, and returned to Muscat with Major Grey who is informing the Resident at Aden by wire of the Somali’s departure for bin-Khamis ifeSecie I have, &amp;c.
