The rumour that Ibn Saud's officials have recently visited Baraimi and collected Zakat was confirmed by news from Sohar. The town of Baraimi, with its adjacent villages o/ Hamasah etc. formerly 'belonged to the Sultanate of Muscat and was under Sohar but became independent or semi-independent in the reign of Saiyid Faisal. The Shaikh was then Zaifi bin v I Khalifah an-Naimi, who himself, and latterly his son and ' successor, Hamdan bin Zaid, used to visit the Sultan (Saiyid Faisal) regularly once or twice a year and paid homage and received reqards like the rest of the Omani Shaikhs. The present Sultan (Saiyid Taimur) neglected to % carry on the old relations etc., the first neglect on his part being that Saiyid Faisal's death was not reported nor his own succession to the Sultanate; this displeased the riaimi Shaikhs and estranged them. n Mi The present Shaikh, Sultan bin Zaid, has for the j.- A / v last few years been sending arid receiving presents to and from Ibn Saud, whom he has now apparently invited to take possess- I -ion or make a sort of protectorate of Baraimi. Last year. Bin Jiluwi, Governor of El Hasa (for Ibn Saud) is said to have collected zakat from the neighbouring tribe of Yalrbu-Shamis near Baraimi and this time Baraimi it- -self has surrendered and paid taxes, the Shaikh being left to rule as heretofore. Sohar on the coast of the interior of Oman being easily accessible through Baraimi this event is probably dangerous to the Sultan's Government who, however, do not appear to think much about it or show any signs of alarm or of being forewarned. ^2- ^ ' /T^7 iLProm - I'he Heniclorcy Arort, Gbarrah To - The For*bio tha Political ^osi^ont, Gulf, No.?P5 Dat3d lot Aurunt 19^5, A.C. 4 ^ v 'lth rofororco to my report No.^29, dated 1st July 1P9R, r©warding Shaikh AMul lah 'bin Jalawi tho Am.5r of Hasa's aervart who came to Bra1mi to collect revenues from the AJ- Aawamer, Ad-Darua' ard Al-Bi^hmnes Bedouire: his interferences in Era 1 mi affairs; the gatherin/z: of the Bralmi Sha^Vhe in Sharpah ard their corcludinp a treaty wHh SliaiVh Sultan bin Sanar a^d their -roturr to Braimi.

Hoveinber 1925» *Tom Lieut.Colonel C ^G ^Crosthv/aite, C.B.E*, Political Agent and Consul, Muscat To The Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Sir, I have _ tn of the Hon'^ble the Political Resident that a considerable amount of local interest not unmixed with alarm has been arous ted recently by the action of Isa bin Saleh of Kabil in proceed- -ing to the Dhahira tract,or district,in Oman. Ostensibly Isa bin Saleh has gone there in order to mediate between the I'anadira tribe and the Shaikh of Ibri in the Tiatuira. Dhaliira# The llanadira tribe had murdered Abdullah,the late Shailch of Ibri and brother of the present Shaikh,and then took refuge with Isa bin S^leh. The Shaikh of Ibri belongs to the G-hafiriyah faction,while the Manadira tribe belong to the Hinawiyah faction. Isa bin Saleh is of the Hinawiyah faction# Local opinion in Muscat is that Isa bin Saleh has really gone to the Dhahira in order to increase his influence and to bring this tract,which is almost wholly Ghafiriyah with the exception^ o^ci village called Yunqui ^under His jurisdiction, and thus in- -crease his sphere of influence as far north as the boundaries of .Barairai. The Dhahira tract has always maintained more or less friendly and quasi-subject relations with the Kuscat State,though at no, even comparatively, recent time has the ruler of I'uscat everraised any taxes from it's inhabitants# '.Then Isa 'bin Saleh led the rebellion of the tribes resident in Oraan proper,i.e.the territory lying round Jabal iOchdar . mountain,and parts of the Sharkiya tract in 1913, the Dhaliira inhabitants do not appear to have joined him in any numbers. The reason why local opinion is now exercised by Isa bin Saleh 1 s move into Dh&amp;hira is that certain of the tribes of that tract lie astride the range of hills separating Dhahira from the Batina district of Oman. Should he bring such tribes under his power in the Dhahira^he may be able to exercise an infXuignce contrary to the interests of the I - lu scat otate in the Batina. The general impression however is that Is^. bin Saleh as a Hinawiyah will not be able to gain over the Ghafiriya tract of the Dhahira. There is reason to believe that Isa bin ^aleh has got the Trnnm of Oman^who is his puppet,to move on Ibri with a large armed force,and there is a rumour that the Shaikh of D®bai has sent a force of 300 pr more men against the Ghafiriya at Isa's request. The situation is being carefully watched and further repor^o will be submitted should Isa's penetration into the Dhaair», increase. There is reason to believe that this move j.nto the -..Thaxiriya faction T s territory has some connection with a coalition of the Trucial Coast chiefs^Dubai and Sharjah^with Isa bin -raleh against Ibn Saud. The religious tenets of the Ghafiriya of the Dhahira approximate to those of the 'Tahabis^and it ic thought Isa bin Saleh is testing his own strength.

The town and the fort at Dik were accordingly handed over as report- -ed in my letter lio»89 of the 12th December 1925» After the fixed period Isa bin Saleh made no sign of returning the fort to the Shaikh of Ibri and the latter upbraided Sulaiman bin hamiyar for failing to make Isa bin Saleh keep his promise. t&gt;ulaiman bin Hamiyar then went to Isa bin Saleh and demanded that he should keep his word. A dispute arose between Isa bin oaleh and aulaiman oin namiyar and the latter left the former and took away his fight- -ing men with him. This defection from Isa bin Saleh f s fighting forces gave courage to the remaining Uhafiri tribesmen to resist^and Isa bin baleh found himself so weak that he has evacuated Ibri and all the other places which had surrendered to him and has gone back to his home at .Kabil.There was a strong rumour that he had heen Btabbed and killed 'by a follower of Sujailaiman 'bin Ham^yar^ut this does not appear to 'be true# He is however very sick and was carried from rbri in a dhooly» Isa bin Saleh f s plans have therefore completely collapsed and he has temporarily lost all his prestige* The Shaikh of Yunkul hearing of Sulaiman^ defection returned to Yunkul and has not paid his respects to Isa» Members of the al uaim tribe that had come down to Dhank to tender their submission have returned home after firing a feu de joie over Isa's discomforture# In this connection it may be mentioned that the uaraimi bnaii.viik- sent a message to the Anglo Persian Oil Company^ geologists in- -viting them to come to iiaraimijthe motive for this invitation is supposed to have been to frighten off Isa bin Saleh by their presence# The geologists did not accept the invitation,and have returned to Muscat* It is hoped now that El Uaruni^the Tripoli agitator,will leave Isa bin Saleh as there is little doubt that he was the originator of Isa ?

The Shaikh describes hovr Isa bin Saleh got possession of Al Ainain and Ibri and put garrisons into these places in the name of the Imam# The agitation among the Ghafiri tribesmen would appear to have been led by one Said bin Mahamad of Al Ainain» The fort at Al Ainain had been left in charge of the son of Isa bin Saleh with 15 men* He went to see his father rbri ,and left only five men in the fort» These men Said bin Mahamad invited to drink coffee at his house^ and,when the fort was emptyjhe seized it» This led to the Shaikh of Ibri dejpanding his fort backhand Shaikh Sulaiman bin Hamiyar's defection as already reported. 3• The Shaikh of Dhank reports in his letter that the Imam declared he would resign^as his title of Tm^m of Oman was evidently an empty one,as half Oman refused to obey hiiiuHe has• i. however been persuaded to remain as Imam for three months more* 4. The Shaikh of Dhank writes further that the Shaikhs of -baJ^raimi have sent 'a man like ±5in Rahmah al 'bu Shama of the Aulad Bultan' to rbn/ Saud asking him to come to i5ahraimi» In this connection he exclaims w And Lo,how a person enjoying honour 'becomes a procurer for his own wife •But alM men have 'become extinct from the centre i ' of Arabs'♦ 5» The Shaikh also writes that while Isa bin Saleh was at Ibri a further Agreement was made between him and the Shaikh of Dubai• j} 'that in case the man (rbn Saud)pounces from the west,then ^weCthe Trucial Coast Chiefs)will help him(the Imam)'» 6* Isa bin Saleh is still sick at Kabil^and is said to be suffering from hernia^which is a very common disease among the Arabs of Oman.

When Ibn Sa^ud captured Hasa from the Turks in 1913, he did in fact, I believe, acquire and annex to his State the large desert region called Jafurakand the isolated H.i^s* Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, London* •a* —* Victe despatch ITcu 10/10, dated the 19th January 1923, from the High CoimniBsioner for Iraq to the Govemnent uf India* j^ncInsure C. isolated oasis of Jahrin — although the Turks had exercised no authority in either — because (1) the only- inhabitants of or risitors to the&amp;e two tracts are A1 Morra and AJman Beaouin, whose fvllow-tribesmen certainly have connection with Hasa, and (2) no Shaikh of the Coast has ^rer exercised authority there. In Horember-jDecember 1922 Sir Percy Cox had * ponyersations with Ibn Sa*ud at Ojair about the grant of a concession for oil in the Hasa district to the Eastern and General Syndicate. sir Percy found that the Sultan propottjd to include the whole of i^atar in this con ^ssion and tooic him to task for it. In uie end the bultan accepted as his eastern boundary a line running due South from the head of Salwah b^r (at th« bottom of the Gulf of Bahrain), and in due course this line was giyen to ton the Syndicate as tne eastern border of its concession* Looking at the Jazetteer may^ one might imagine that tne whole of Jafura lies to the West of this line, but the letter press clearly shows that it does not. it seems to me that Ibn Sa^d can hardly be ejected to refrain from exercising jurisdiction over the Al Morra all over the Jafura desert. The coastal tracts east of ^atar and the Dhafrah desert^with its numerous oases, on the other hand 9 are inhabited — more or less sparsely — by Bani Yas, who are fellow-tribesmen of the Chiefs of Abu Dhabi and Jibai, and kanasir, who have no connection with Hasa but deal with the towns of Trucial Oman and resort, in consiuerable and increasing numbers, to its pearl-banks. ^• .jast oi Dhafrah are the oases of Dhaid, Ba^raimi,I I 11 I - 3 - i' 1 Baj^ralmip Kafit aiid Mahadha.

Until lately its political sympathies appear to have leant to the side of the Sultan of Muscat against the Ibadhl Imam of Omans but last year the latter made a determined effort to attach it forcibly to his aide 9 fearing that otherwise the Wahhabis will absorb it. The attempt failed and it remains to be seen who will ma^ie the next mo%e to depriye \ the Sultan of Oman of this district* 8.

The Kaim had summoned to their a(^ the Bani qitah, the Awamir and the Daru of Dhahirak and were more than holding their own in conflicts in Dhafrah with the Bani Yas, who were led by Shaikh Sultan*s brothers and cousins* In June 1925 it was reported tha^ the Awamir and the Daru had appealed to the Amir of Hasa to proteot them from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. Presumably theyi really wished their encroachments on Dhafrah to be confirmed to them* It was reported in the same month that the Amir had sent an official named Said to collect zii^at in the Ba^raimi oasis* This official employed about sixty men who went about in fifteen parties* They were generally but not invariably successful* The tax demanded was 1 rial ^er camel, 1 piastre per head of cattle^ 5 per cent , of the flocks* Said arrested and hanged a Hasawi refugee in Ba^raimi* It was also he who notified to the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dibai that the Amir of Hasa had taken the Awamir and Daru tribes (Muscat subjects, fundamentally 1 ) under the Sultan of liajd^ protection* 9* In July 1925 it was reported that the Shaikhs of the Kaim of BcJ^raimi, the Bani kaab and the Bani qitab had oeen negotiating with the young shaikh of Shargah for mutual assistance in the event of aggression by the Deputy of the Amir of Hasa* 10* In August 1925 after a conference between relatives of the Shaikh of Dibai and Shaikh Isa bin Am Am, Saleh, the Ibadhi supporter of the Wall' of Oman, it was agreed that these two Shaikhs should support each other in resisting liahhabi encroachments* Immediately after wards the Chief of Abu Dhabi paid visits to Dibai, ShargahShargah and Umrn al ^aiwain while Shaiitlx Isa bin Sal«^ visited ]3aJ^raimi« 11. m December 1925 the Chief of Umw al ^aiwain and the Kaimi headman of Hamriyah took the Bani ^itab Shaikh to Abu Dhabi to settle the feud between the Bani q.itab and the Bani Yas# 12 # In the same month the Ibadhi leaders of oman 9 who are equally anti -bultan (of Muscat) and anti -Ibn Sa*ud, commenced their offensive against Dhahirah and Ba^raimi and initially achieved considerable success. After the capture of Ibri, however, they quarrelled. Shaikh Sulaiman bin Hamyar/ defected and .ihaikh Isa bin Saleh fell ill. The Imam and Shaikh Isa then abandoned the expedition and returned to their homes. 13. in the same month the Shaikh of Dibai received * i T a fetter, purport of which Translation attached.* Enclosure D. 1 kas onl y now communi- t cated to me. In it the Amir of Hasa conveys a serious threat against the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. 14. In February 1926 it was reportedthat the Amir of Hasa had sent a posse of police to Shargah in pursuit of a Najdi criminal. In the letter addressed to the Shaikh the extradition of the ctiminal was demanded. The accused was not found and the Hajdi police went on te Ajman and Ras al Khaimak. Apparently the Lian escaped detection. incidentally it was reported at the same time that Najdi slave-traders were boldly bringing African negroes and (accordingito later reports) war- captives down to the coastal towns for sale; and further jthat the Trucial Shaikhs were afraid to interfere with them. 15. in March 1926, the Amir, Ibn Jaluwi, sent two superior officials, Sa^ and Ibn Man8ur 9 to collect XikatZlkat in Dhafrah suid Bayraimi. In two Judicial cases recently tiie A/air of Hasa has written (a) to the Kazi of Shargah and (b) to the bhaikh of Dibai chiding them for not satisfying Hajdi complainants. The Kaai sent his son to Hofuf to express regret I X7 # xo sum up the position, it would seem that tie Amir of Hasa has two immediate ohjectiyeei (1) to include Trucial Oman and 'Independent Oman* in tote in the Kingdom of lajd, and (2) to get into ditect contact (including the task of protecting its tribes) with a large district of the Sultanate of Oman, which is opposed to the Imam and at the same time is almost independent of the Sultan. 18. To serve both objectives, he must first absorb the whole of Dhafrah - a region of about 14,000 square miles, which stretches 175 miles from wesl/to east and 80 from north to south, bounded on the north by the Persian Gulf and on the south the Ruba* al iOialt(Great Desert). This region, along with three smaller coastal tracts to its west, all historically and ae Jure belong to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. 19. East of Bhafrah, the Wahhabis will have little difficulty in procuring the submission of the people of Ba^raimi, Hafit and Dhahirai ; some on account of their antipathy for Abu Dhabi and the others being hostile to the Ibadhis. 20. As regards the Trucial Chiefs themselves, I believe that if they see the annexation of Dfcafrah and Ba\raimi achieved they will seek the best possible terms for themselves from Ibn Sa^d and offer to join the Hajd State. They will be satisfied if ^hey can obtain recognition as hereditary and permanent Governors of their respective territories. A large portion of their subjects are HanbaXw in- 7 - lo^ a in &amp;ect f and they nave not forgotten that a hundred years ago they were Wahhabis themselree* The Kazie in all the Chief ships except Abu Dhabi and £ibai are actually Najdis. 21. In these circumstances it seems to me that if r His La^esty's Government wish to preserve the individul- ityof the Trucial Chiefships and at the same time to safe-guard Muscat from aggression, they must ask the Ruler of Najd in peremptory language to compel his representative in Hasa to observe the boundary accepted in 1922 (with or without the rest of Jafura} t to abstain from minatory acts against the Trucial Chiefs, and in im portant cases to address this Residency about inter- Statal matters. ✓22. It will be remembered that in 1923 a very similar complaint of encroachments oft Qatar's independence was telegraphed to you in Colonel Knox 's Ho. 838, dated the 21st September 1923* Ibn Sa'ud was given a severe warning on receipt of your telegram of the 12th HoveuUier 1923, since when no occasion to complain about tar has arisen. Whether Ibn Saud will be equally attentive to remonstrance now in his changed circumstances remains to be seen. 23. I think personally that the time has come for a stronger political influence to be introduced into the Trucial States than that of the Arab Residency Agent. Only the presence of a British officer will encourage the Chiefs to resist the subtle and intensive propaganda which the Wahhabis notoriously push on their other frontiers. 24. Alternatively; the question has to be facedi 'If the Chiefs jointly, or one or more of them separately, express their intention - in defiance of treaty obligations but without repudiating ithe maritime Truce — enter thethe Najd State, will Him Majesty^ Governmeat accept the 8ituation ,, ? Tne diffioultieB of our Indian traders will certainly be increased for a long time to come, and many people opine, 1 believe, tnat the iTaj'd State is not lively to continue as it is after Abdul Azia's death. 25• I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Oovernment of India.

They are connected with the /fl bu Sharjis section, who are ♦anabis. Mohamed bin Salmin of this section is about to start on pilgrimage to ^ecca. The ohcikns of Shargah have strong 'aiiabi leanings. Until a lew months ago the C^adhi of the town was a .•ahabi who had persuaded Sheikh Sultan to send his brother to nbdulla bin Jilawi to / ake treaty which involved the acceptance into Shar gah of a Wahabi ^ir who should'advise M the Sheikh. This scheme was stopped by the action of M.M.S.'Triad' which was deputed by Col.-PrideaKxto visit Shargah and convey a warn ing to the Sheikh. There are many wahabi beggars and *attawahs in the towns of the Trucial Coast but their presence does not appear to be oi political importance. The to^ns are however visited by wahabi slave dealers and arms traders, who bring for sale Abyssinian ana Kubian slaves of both sexes and rifles. I heard no report of Wahabi penetration in Mibai but the fratricidal struggles in ^bu Dhabi afford fruitful fieldfield for i ahabi intrigues o ....en Sheikh Suggur ol Abu Lhabi murdered his brother Sultan in august 19^6, the sons of Sul% tan # Shakboot and Hazza fled to lin Jilawi at Hassa and asked for assistance,, This was not afforaed openly Bin Jilawi ad- Tised them to take ujp their residence in i ^almah IslandoThey came to Daliuah but were subsequently compelled to leaye this island owing to the action taken against them by their uncle.

He was told that he should huve no fear of Bin Saud, as he was on friendly terms with the British and had undertaken not to interfere in any way with n.atar. he replied that he was not afraid of Bin Saud who was a man of his word and aequainted with affairs, but what was to happen if Bin Saud were killed. The murder of Bin Saud was quite a possi bility and already the nkhwan were showing signs of dis obedience to his wishes. If he were killed the whole coun try would be plunged into anarchy and the whole of ^atar would be at the mercy of the Akhwan, He added that s.atar is at the mercy of the &gt;ikhv/an even at the pre sen* time, but that Bin ^aud still has a restraining influence though his influence is diminishing.

Bahrein, .4th A ril 1*127. t o-itioal A em, laJrirein.D 'pin The Agency Interpreter, K.S.kirza, Ali quotes the following from an interview with Sheikh Mirz* Ali, an influential priest in Bahrein who has a large following in Hasa,Qataf and Bahrein:- It is some time since the Y/ahaMs appointed Imams to the Shiah mosques of Hasa and compelled the Shiahs to say their prayers behind them. Lately the V/ahaTeis hare en forced the same thing in !iatif whose inlia&amp;itants are mostly Shialis. These Imams are ordinary men whose justice and morality is questionable yet the Shiah Ulema have to pray behind these men. The Yi'ahabis are strict on this point and count the attendance at the mosques,should any one fail to appear for prayers he is punished. For example one Syed Kasir, and important Shiah Alim was severely rebuked on not turning up one day owing to indisposition. Another Shiah Alim, Sheikh iiusa has been stopped from lead ing the prayers and made to do duty as a crier while a Waha bi has taken his place. The Shiahs are much annoyed at having to follow the Waha- bi rites. The Wahabis have prohibited the recitation of of the mour ing of Imam Hussein in public and private and those observ ing these ceremonies are liable to capital punishment;invo- to cations juul/Shiah Saints are also forbidden. The commencement of Ramazan and fasting days are fixed by the Wahabis and the Shiahs have to follow them. The Id day is also fixed by tue wahabis. The Vtahabis intend to convert all the Shiahs into Waha bis and for this purpose they try to make the Shiahs inter marry with them. The expenses of the above Imams are paid by the people who are also foxced to say very long praters after their evening prayers during Ramazan; should any one omit to do this he is severely punished. The Wahabis now prevent people from travelling abroad with their families; many have tried to leave the country withwith their families but have been prevented, even for t^e purpose of seeking medical treatment. Sheikh Abdulla bin ^elowi has appointed 1000 horses to each village to feed and his men continually find fault with the villagers and blackmail them and if they find a horse has scratched itself they beat the groom to death. The people are made to furnish materials for the repair of Jin Jelowi's house and stables, should any one supply old date tree/ trunks he is punished: it often happens that people are obliged to dismantle their own roofs in order to supply lin Jelowi with rafters. lin Jelowi keeps a great number of chickens which he feeds at the expense of the people and sells their eggs for his own benefit: he is also in the habit of taking fodder x and dates for his horses every day. Bip Jelowi has now become so indifferent that whoever complains to him against his officials gets no reply other than some punishment for complaining. Ue never listens to Shiahs. The oaJtfat on dates and cereals is always assessed at the nmximum price and so tax payers have to pay nearly all thei/^- income as taxes. This tax is also always collected in advance. Tue ».ahat)is collect every year a sum of ie©,000 dollars froiw the people of Hasa and 80,000 dollars from C^atif as Jihad Revenue, On account of these oppressions and exactions the inha- bitans of Masa and Qatif, who arc luostly Shiahs, are at their wits end and much dissatisfied and their leading Ule- :ria ^.htikr; Ahmed Khanaizi, Sheikh Mansur bin Saif Tarooti and Sheikh Huhamed Sarah have enquired from Sheikh kirza above as to whether the Sritish Government would be prepared to accept them as subjects. Sheikh Mirza therefore enquires if it is possible for the Hon'ble the Political Kesident to consider this and what steps they should taice to bring this about, lit also says that should it become known tha^ they wanted to become'become Britieh eubjectB tlieir lives would be in danger. At present the people of (niatif are coining to Bahrein in twos and threes and after the Gaffal many divero will re main here.

On the night of 25th 'Ramazan (1 8-3 -28) the Nejdi complained to the Shaikh of A'bu Dhahi to the effect that Es.lSOO/- had 'been stolen from his 'box and accused a man of Batinah who was working as a diver for Matar bin Matar of Ahu Dhahi.

The Shaikh arrested the two slaves and 'bastinoeded them and as they were severely dealt with theyMXHOMi stated that the money was with the son of their master. The Shaikh summoned Matar 'bin Matar, his son and some of the notables of Ahu Dhahi as well as the two slaves and the man of Batinah. The slaves denied the charge which they had 'brought against Matar's son and so Matar asked that ^ the case of the Nejdi might he referred to a Shara CJourt for decision hut did not succeed. The Nejdi left for Hasa where he complained to Shaikh Abdullah 'bin Jalawi about the theft of his money at Abu Dhabi. Shaikh Abdullah sent Muhammad bin Mansur and the Nejdi with a letter to the Shaikh of Vbu Dhabi asking him to recover the dues of the Nejdi. Muhammad bin Mansur on his arrival at Abu Dhabi threatened the Shaikh that if he did not recover the Nejdi's dues from Matar bin TTatar he would order that the camels of the inhabitants of Abu Dhabi to be carried off in the interior. As the inhabitants of Abu Dhabi have got residences at Liva andthe interior and make traffic to those places they were frightened of 'being attacked 'by the Bedouins of Abdullah 'bin Jalawi and their camels 'be carried off and the road to the interior 'be closed 'by them. Under these circumstances the notables of Ahu Dhahi settled the case of the theft for Rs.1200/- and asked the Shaikh to pay the amount to Muhammad 'bin Mansur. The Shaikh paid Es.800/- in cash and gave a 'bond to Muhammad to pay the 'balance viz Rs.400/- at the end of diving season that is the month of Rahi II (Septemher- Octoher 1928). One of the notables of Abu Dhabi named \hmad bin Khalaf guaranteed for payment of the balance. lastm. The Shaikh would recover the whole amount from Matar bin i^atar at the end of diving season.

Hickinbotham, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain. The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to enclose copies of correspond- ence between Shaikh Said bin Maktum, O.B.E., Ruler of Du bai, and Abdur Rahman bin Ibrahim, Amir of *Oqair and Shaikh Saud bin Abdullah bin Jiluwi A1 Faisal, Amir of Hasa and to state that on July the 27th I received a report from the Passport Officer of the Bahrain Government to the effect that a dhow had arrived from Dubai with a male prisoner on board. The Passport Officer enquired who the man was and the nakhuda, whose statement forms an enclosure to this letter, stated that he was a prisoner being sent by the Shaikh of Dubai to the Amir of Hasa, The nakhuda produced a piece of paper sealed by Shaikh Said bin Maktum stating that the man ?/as being sent to Hasa by order of Shaikh Saud bin Abdullah bin Jiluwi. This matter was immediately re ported to me. 2. I examined the papers and had the nakhuda interview ed by one of the Agency interpreters and his statement re corded. This statement forms an enclosure to this letter. The Agency interpreter obtained two letters from the nakhuda one of which was addressed to Shaikh Saud bin Abdullah bin Jiluwi and the other to Abdur Rahman bin Ibrahim, Amir of 'Oqair. I had these letters opened with care and took copies of the contents. After copies had been made the letters/- *letters were resealed and returned to the nakhuda and he was allowed to depart with his prisoner. 5. From a perusal of the intercepted letters, which form enclosures to this letter, you will see that the individual concerned had committed a robbery at Dubai and had been apprehended and that the Shaikh of Dubai was sending the man back to Sa^di Arabia, presumably for punishment, at the request of Abdullah bin Jiluwi. While I was in Dubai some time ago I heard that this individual was in jail for the theft and there was considerable rejoicing among the Shaikh f s family on account of his having been apprehended. I have no knowledge of the contents of the letter which it appears Abdullah bin Jiluwi addressed to the Shaikh of Dubai and I think it would be interesting to discover if an order was actually issued or merely a request. 4. This correspondence between the Shaikh of Dubai and the Sa^di Arabian Governor is in my opinion a breach of Article No. 1 of the Treaty of 1&amp;&amp;2 between His Majes ty^ Government and the Chief of Dubai. I was uncertain whether to detain the prisoner here and telegraph to you regarding this matter or whether to content myself with taking copies of the letters and allowing the prisoner to go and reporting the matter by mail. I thought that it would probably cause undesirable notice if the man was detained in Bahrain and so I decided that it would be better to permit the prisoner to be taken to Sa'udi Arabia as he was a Sa^di subject and to report the matter to you by mail. 5. I am doubtful to what extent the Trucial Shaikhs make a practice of returning offenders to the Sa ! udi Arabian Government for punishment and in return receive their/--5- im their own subjects from Sa^di Arabian officials. There is no doubt that theoretically the Shaikhs should conduct all their correspondence with Foreign Government officials through the Political authorities but practically it may be considered to be an advantage for a mutual exchange of offenders to take place thus saving us considerable cor respondence and responsibility. I should like to examine this question before making a definite recommendation, 6. J am making enquiries through the Residency Agent, Sharjah, regarding the customary practice on this point with particular reference to the Shaikhdoms of Dubai and Abu Dhabi / I have the honour to be.

'To all who may see this paper that Farhood al Hajiri is sent along with nakhoda Mohammad Al Mulla by the order of Shaikh (brother) Saud bin Abdu lla bin Jaloi . and he, the nakhoda is taking ■ him to Ajair to be delivered to the Amir of Ajair Shaik Abdul Rahman bin Ibrahim and from thence to be sent to Hasa to be handed over to Shaikh Saud bin Abdulla. Under the circumstances no one to interfere in this matter'. Seal of Shaikh Said. 13/5/36,//4 c) Statement of Wakhudha Muhammad bin Ahmad al Mullah - a Dubai subject. Recorded on the 27th July 1957. Over two months ago Farhud al Hajiri plundered two camels belonging to Shaikh Said bin Maktum and ran away to the desert. Shaikh Said sent 6 men after him who overtook him and brought him to Dubai and handed him over to Shaikh Said. Farhud was kept in prison. Shaikh Said wrote to Ibn Jiluwi, Amir of Hasa about the action of Farhud and received a reply to the effect that Farhud should be sent to Hasa as he is a Saudi subject. Farhud was in prison in Dubai for 2 months until the replj from Ibn Jiluwi was re ceived. Shaikh Said ordered me to take Farhud on my boat to Oqair and hand him over to the Amir of Oqair. He gave me two letters, one for the Amir of Hasa and the other for the Amir of Oqair the contents of which I do not know. We arrived in Bahrain today and want to transfer Farhud to a launch and take him to Oqair as ordered by Shaikh Said. Later I will come back to Bahrain to join my boat which I shall leave here until my return. , __Statement of Farhud al Hajiri - Saudi subject. Recorded on the 27th July 1937. I went to Dubai by land route months ago together with 10 other persons of Oman and one Dosiri. Shaikh Said bin Maktum gave presents to my companions but did nd)t give me anything. Then I and my Dosiri companion whose name is Abdur Rahman bin Abdullah who is a Saudi subject left for the desert and on our way plundered two camels belonging to Shaikh Said which we sold to certain bedouins in the desert for one she-camel. Later we went to Buraimi. One ! Ali bin 1 Atiq with o men sent by Shaikh Said to pursue me and overtake me, came and requested me to make a compromise with them that both sides should leave behind what happened in the past and open a new era. I agreed to this and we became on good terms with each other. Then we marched in the desert and halted at an encampment of Bani Kitab bedouins at Yidaya 1 water wells. While I was frying to make my she- camel kneel down, these persons rushed at me, threw me on the ground and handcuffed me. Then they went to my Dosiri companion and shot him dead. They took me to Dubai and hanaed me over .o Shaikh Said who kept me in prison and chained my legs. I remained in prison for 2 months and then he put me on a sailing boat which arrived in Bahrain today with the intention of taking me to Hasa, I do not know for what purpose I am being taken to Hasa.Translation of letter dated ^ra Jamad Awwal 1556 (1^-7-^7) from Shaikh Said bin Maktum, O.B.E., Puler of Dunai, to Shaikh Saud bin Abdullah bin Jiluwi Al Faisal, Amir of Hasa.

He volunteered the not particularly startling information that friendships do not usually last long, and there is frequent reshuffling of alliances. He confirmed the belief that the Baraimi area in general takes little or no account of the Sultan of l&amp;iscat and that the Shaikhs go to him merely to collect what money they can in return for polite phrases. 3. In regard to Bin Saud 1 s influence he was rather more definite. He stated that although Bin Saud does not collect zakat frogi the Oasis itself (i.e. from settled tribes), his tax-collectors take it from nomad tribes in the neighbouring desert. This, he says, impresses the Shaikhs of the settled tribes, and though they may not be definitely afraid of Bin Saud, nevertheless they would do nothing that they thought might oft end him. On the other hand, Howes scarcely heard Bin Baud's name mentioned and gathered the impression that his in fluence cannot be very strong around Baraimi. 4. In quoting specific examples to prove that the hinterland Shaikhs have been consulting Bin Saud about allowing exploration parties/- The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.S., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, On board H.M.S. Deptford.parties to visit their territories, the agent went badly- wrong. I need only mention one example; he said that Mohammad bin Ali of the Beni Kitab sent 35 to 40 camels to Bin Saud with a letter asking for instructions* The truth is that though Mohairimad bin Ali did think of sending half a dozen camels as a present in the normal way, he finally decided not to bother. Altogether I was disappointed with this agent. Admittedly it was his first visit and he would probably do better another time; but he seems to have shown little initiative and little ability in finding and using 'cover' 1 , 5# Piecing together information from various different sources I think the hinterland outlook can be estimated briefly as follows:- Ci) Abu Dhabi is the big power at the threshold. Shaikh Shakhbut has a strong and apparently loyal wali in his part of the Baraimi Oasis, namely Ibrahim bin Uthman, for whom the P^im and A1 Bu Shamis Shaikhs seem to have considerable respect. Abu Dhabi therefore wields the strongest influence in Baraimi and much of Dhahira. (ii) The Sultan of Muscat is recognised as quite an important ruler — in his own place. Annual visits and fair words to him are profitable, and serve as an insurance against the possible closing of the Batineh Coast (not probable but possible only). Otherwise the Sultan has no very great influence and any sugges tion of his suzerainty over the hinterland would be vigorously rejected. (iiij Bin Saud is recognised as the really great man, and con siderable care is exercised by the Shaikhs to keep on his right side. Nevertheless he is a long way off, he is getting older every day, and I doubt if he is regarded as a serious menace to their independence.
