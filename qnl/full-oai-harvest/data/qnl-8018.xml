The King was concerned over French claims to Perim Island [Jaz카rat Mayy큰n] and Sheikh Said, and was seeking anti-aircraft and gas equipment from the UK and Italy.The file consists of correspondence between the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the War Office, and the Governor of Aden (Bernard Reilly). Telegrams from Reilly provide details of meetings with Qadhi Hussein el Halali, the King's representative, regarding the defence of Yemen.The file also includes several documents from the 67th and 68th meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence's Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Governing the Middle East, discussing the fortification of Sheikh Said. The following topics are discussed: the importance of maintaining Yemeni neutrality in the event of a conflict between European powers; the provision of equipment and training by the UK; the need to operate within the terms of the Anglo-Italian Agreement of 1938; French claims to Perim and Sheikh Said; and pre-existing British commitments to Ibn Sa'큰d.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the end of the correspondence (folio 2).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Committee of Imperial Defence, Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Governor of Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for the Colonies, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sheikh Said</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Anglo-Yemeni relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002f1#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
