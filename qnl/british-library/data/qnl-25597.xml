He has en quired of Russian Minister and me whether our Govern ments would indemnify him if threat is carried out which is quite probable. A signal Russian success at Ramadan would restore some measure of confidence to Cabinet but at present they are so much impressed by threats of Germans and gendarmes that they scarcely dare talk even of an alliance and we can get nothing definite from them as to completed demands.

Foreign Secret. Persia. Your telegram of the &lt;c6th November. It appears out of the question in the face of McMahon’s negotiations with Arabs to make any bargain with Persia involving territorial concessions in Mesopotamia* Such a transaction coming to knowledge of Sheriff and Arabs could only arouse grave distrust and indication and give them ground for definitely breaking with us. Moreover communities concerned in Mesopotamia many of whom are refugees from Persian outrage would probably resent such a transaction and do theirrbest accordingly to upset Arab rapprochement and obstruct local pacification. These considerations coupled with objections regarding cession to Persia of Holy Places already indicated by us make it desirable, we think, to keep Mesopotamia out of bargain. If Persian G-ovt. press matter it might be explained to them that H.M. G-ovt. have consistently declared that they have no quarrel in Mesopotamia with the Arabs population or with communities resident at the Holy Places which it is their policy scrupulously to respect and that it is impossible therefore without a much fuller consideration of rights h± and wishes of these communities than is at present feasible to give any guarantee as to future disposal of any part of Mesopotamia. The Persian Govt, should remember that it has never been the policy of Great Britain to dismember for their own advantage weaker States with whom they have no quarrel. Persian Govt, may rest assured' however that any proposals in this natter they may subsequent ~ly make will be sympathetically considered so far as is compatible with justice to the communities concerned and the maintenance't;‘“' pC5 T A Jjjr 1 ite* ° POLITIC-AX Be cypher „ J.iarLing 0 (Te heran) November 24bb, B w 7c30 c pan, November 24th 0 R o 10/1.5 c e,n, NoveiEber 25th 3 No e 430, My telegram No, 479.

R. 9.55 PoiiU s No« 472, (2 groups undecypherable) Persian Government and the Shah are at present this moment (sic ) genuinely alsrmod at the situation to which their German intrigues have brought the country, and they feel that Persia must adopt a more definite attitude. Neutrality, even the benevolent neutrality they profess themselves ready to practise, will always leave the door open to complaints from one party or the other, and. they would like to put an end to all ambiguity and declare Persia definitely com mitted to one side or the other. The Government and the Shah prefer to go with us, and if the question of Alliance were raised I feel (3 groups undecypherable). For their Alliance they would of course demand more than the six points reported in my telegram No. 442*. and first of all they will require assurances of protection against aggression from Turkey. His Majesty’s Government are of course much better able than myself to gauge the consequences to ourselves if Persia entered the war against us, but I feel that they far outweigh any disadvantages of uhe present or the future attendant on the conclusion of a Persian Alliances. If Persia joins Germany willingly or otherwise, German aims of immobilizing forces in India that are required \required elsewhere, or caking our military position in Mesopotamia insecure, and of stirring up trouble in the Caucasus may well bo realized,. If on the other hand Persia bocones our ally German plans here assuredly fail. They are promising Persia in the event of the latter's joining than, that in 2 or 3 months a Turco-German army corps will be sent ffora Con stantinople. I do not suppose that they ever intended anyhow more than (?to} send a small force as tne nucleus of an army to be foamed and organised under German end Turkish officers for use .against us in Mesopotamia and A fghanistan. This scheme would be certainly abandoned, if no response could be expected in this country. Moreover with the Persian Government open hostilities of German \ propaganda here would soon. collapse; they could keep a certain number of small tribes with them, but all the greater ones would stand by the Persian Government: our responsibilities from a military point of view would there 'ore not be grsato Persian demands as the price oi her alliance may be grouped under two heads - financial and political. She vill want money in softie form, but certainly nothing am ill commensurate with the cost of prolongation of the ivar for a single week. As to political demands, they nay be comprised under the sis points above-mentioned, or others may be adaeo.. Whatever they are they will certainly be aimed au freeiug Persia from the hold the two powers have ovc. her (2 groups undecipherable).

Above suggestions are made from political point of view in my capacity of Political Resident in the Persian Gidf without regard to military con siderations. Once Government have made up their minds in regard to above or alternate line of action the sooner we take Sheikh into our confidence the better. 1 am asking Army Commander to comment on these proposals in so far as they may affect present or possible military operations.[P 4150] From Viceroy, \Oth November 1915. \l (Repeated to Basra and Tehran.)

So long as the attitude of the Persian Government leaves room for hope that rupture may lie avoided, we consider that it would be a mistake to enter into any anticipatory negotiations with the Sheikh of Mohammerah or other Chiels, since such negotiations coming to the knowledge of the Persian Government would only tend to exasperate the situation and possibly to precipitate crisis; while if guarantee offered by us appealed strongly to the persons concerned, it might prompt them to expedite rupture which we desire to avoid. Should, however, the prospect of rupture with the Persian Government appear absolutely inevitable, our views are :— (1.) In regard to Pusht-i-Kuh, that though as stated in our telegram No. 500 ol 19th May we still consider him unreliable, we rerdise that there are advantages in having him on our side if possible. If, therefore, ( ox is satisfied that negotiations with him on the lines proposed can be satisfactorily effected, and .Minister agrees, we think Oox should be authorised to act accordingly. (2.)

Reference to Government of India’s telegram of Uth November. I submit that advantages of declaration of independence by Shaikh are that we thereby regulate Shaikh’s position, and put him out of suspense at once, in a manner to which Allies cannot reasonably take exceptiom and which while sufficiently securing our interests in future will avoid inconvenience of including Arabistan among the items to be discussed and distributed among Allies after war. If proposal is approved subject to contingency arising, it is important for us to know what amount of publicity, if any, should be given to Shaikh’s declaration and our recognition of it. 1 think we should make it clear to Shaikh’s headmen we support his action, but that beyond that no special function or other specific step calculated to draw public attention to matter should be taken. Public, might be drawing their own conclusions from hoisting Arab flag. As between ourselves and Shaikh if he will agree to do so perhaps it will better for him to take initiative and write us a letter expressing his intention of declaring himself independent of Persia, and stating his readiness to maintain existing obligations towards us and place in our hands control oi his foreign relations, and the management of posts and telegraphs and customs if possible, and asking us to recognise agent.

(Repealed to lehran and General Officer Commanding Force “ /)/’ and Cox as No. 13 D.S.) Foreign Secret. Persia. Your telegram dated 27th October. In event of rupture with Persia, we adhere to the programme proposed in my telegram of 29th day last and accepted in your predecessor’s telegram of 23rd June last. Consuls at Shiraz and Kerman are best judges themselves as to how withdrawal can best be effected. They should be given free hand to arrange with Soulet and K a warn in case of Shiraz, and with Governor-General in case of Kerman, for safe conduct in whatever direction appears most suitable. As regards oilfields, we think manner in which and force with which oilfields should be protected must be left entirely to Sir J. Nixon’s discretion. It would be grave mistake to endeavour to prescribe on these points to a General Commanding in the field, but it is very improbable that Nixon could appreciably reinforce his troops on Karun until after the arrival of Indian divisions from France.3 From Commodore, Persian Gulf To Admiralty.

As there are not sufficient troops for the occupation of Lingeh and Bander Abbas, Briuisii representatives and subjects will be removed if necessary H.^t.Snips au the port to Karachi. Cable would be disconnected ana steamers would cea.se to call. Community will remain as long as possible at Chahbar on account of telegraph line. After evacuating Lingeh and Bander Abbas DALHOUSIS will go to Bombay for refit as previously arranged. BRITOiiART will go to Hen jam from which place a system of relief ships requiring coal will be arranged, Lid.lliNCL will then return to Bushire for disposal. Defence of Bushire will be undertaken by JUNO and troops following lines that have been recently in force at that place. &gt; C.O. of troops is asking for 400 additional troops to be sent. This reinforcement is considered very necessary owing to length of perimeter to defend, 6 miles in length. If it is desired to seize Persian Sea-borne trade propose to form Depot for captured chows at '(?)rag' Island with a second depot Hen jam.

Persia. Your telegram of 16th Sept. . agree generally with Cox's conclusions in his telegram No* 2069 of Sept 19th. As the Persian Govt, have apparently not yet themselves‘broached subject of Negief and Kerbela and as at present there is no question of our advance to Baghdad proposal of the Russian Govt, seems to ue entirely premature. We think that the ouestion of Nejef and. Kerhela should as far as possible oe avoided but if raised;Persian Govt, most that we should say is that in the event of our advancing to Baghdad it is the intention of British Govt, that Holy Places of Mesopotamia shall be removed from Turkish domination and forms* an enclave that shall remain intact and inviolable and that their future administration shall be that of an autonomous Shiah state. We doubt whether any promise short of cession of Nejef and Eerbela to Persia - which is out of the question - would greatly affect Persian Govt, or Persian public opinion while any vague promise of admitting Persia to direct relations with Holy Places might be greatly resent ed by Clergy of Nejef and Kerbela themselves and involve us in trouble in that quarter.

Blockading of river trade routes from South owing to warlike ope rations, combined with oppressive exactions of the Turl^ V cause/Senous distress at the Holy Places, which have lately been relieved by abandonment and retirements from Euphrates line, and by liberal policy adopted by military authorities in alio wan oon vmd/fuocP stuffs to passoify ( y '■■) in either direction on Euphrates. People had to sell their (?jlwniinnhuld) property to provide themselves with necessaries of life. Finally, there was a famine of current coin which accentuated distress. I have done my utmost to get money to Holy Places. It has been impossible to send specie, but 1 have lost no opportunity of getting drafts here and there for small amounts sent secretly, and have thus sent about TOOL I have had indirect acknowledgment of arrival of money in several cases, and appreciation of recipients. One messenger was arrested on his way back by Turks ; nothing was found on him, but he is still in durance, and his arrest has of course made recipients wary of communicating. United States Consul at Baghdad reports that Turks object to payment by him of Oudh beneficiaries and pensioners, but he hopes to have objection removed. jef A month ago leading Arab Sheikh, jNIa{ 'F r, sent an em issary to Nasrie saying they were ready to acquiesce in our passage onJmms receiving- certain assurances, and 1 sent a copy of reply sent to Government of India and I have asked them to communicate it if not already done. At the present moment there is no doubt inhabitants of Holy Places are praying for our advance m order that normal conditions may be restoied, but as soon as that is done, and they are contented, the} will doubtless revert to their natural condition of bigoted community whom we had better leave, as far as possible, to their own devices. This should not be impossible from the administrative point of view.From Sir P. Cox, 19£/i September 1915. ( Addressed to India, repeated to India Office, mmi Minister, Bushire.) 3396J R. *2069 B With reference to Secretary of State for India’s telegram of 17th September. Holy Places. If we advance beyond limits of Basra vilayet it surely goes without saying that holy places would be eliminated from Turkish domination and come under ourselves in some form, together with Baghdad. It does not appear to me that we can advisedly do more than offer inducements suggested in Viceroy’s telegram of 12th February and my telegram No. 894 of 19th April. We might guarantee absence of Christian officials, and, in view of special interests of Persia, we might agree to consult Persian Government informally when selecting individuals for governorships. It is even conceivable that we might on occasion ask Persian Government to lend us such individuals who would become British employes for time being. We might allow clergy to keep a representative at Teheran, and Persian Government «Pt to keep agents at, each holy place who might be given diplomatic rank and special privileges, but to allow Persia any direct control or rights of interference seems to me out of the question. Moreover, though communities concerned are bigoted people and are no doubt averse from any interference from Christian officials, yet large numbers of them originally came to reside in holy places as a refuge from Persian fuuolkm.i mmw ontrnf-fe (.?X (if) we leave them to manage their own affairs as far as possible, I am confident they would prefer to come under our aegis ; and, in fact, would resent being rescued from oppression of one corrupt Government merely to be delivered into the hands of a worse.OTBNHBOm Immediate and Confidential. •/ fi r fi 51 ; f) /3^ s 49 I l~) V~', The Under - Secretary of State for Foreign A flairs presents his compliments to ^icc — *£rL**&amp;L*eL and is directed by the Secretary of State to transmit the accompanying cop uh? of n. telegrams &gt; as marked in the mar ginj f^J^^z**-**^***^ (s~C Foreign Office, /tf- * I 9 i s'Ll 4- [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, * 1 / and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with nnless required for official use.] LL C3 ^ RUSSIA, POLITICAL, Decypherr Sir Gr Buchanan (Petrograd) September 12th P 1915 Dp 'SpOrppm, xic o o 5 p p«.rn, September 12th* 1915 No* 1338* 15 SEP iy1 ^ Sssmtifl Minister tor Foreign Affairs with whom I had dis cussed in recent conversations Persian situation has sent me an Aide Memoire embodying his views on the sub ject* While recognizing imperious necessity for taking certain measures to counteract German and Turkish in trigues, Monsieur Sazonof states that he could ndt entertain the idea suggested oy Mr* Marling, of breaking off diplomatic relations with Persia and recalling the two Legations if the Persian Government refused within 48 hours to declare itself solid with us* His Excellency does not consider Legations are in any immediate danger while the fact that Russian detach ment at Kasvin has been reinforced by 1,000 men, gives reason to hope that the situation at Teheran will not develop into one like that at Ispahan* While Mr* Marling’s suggestion might produce a certain impression on the Shah and his Ministers, who while apparently anxious to maintain Persian neutrality are powerless to cope with the situation, departure of the two Legations would be a triumph for the Democrats '^‘Nationalists and Pedals, who are the real promoters of disordermmmmm 'z.zq ) disorder as well as tor their German instigators, and would afford new proof of weakness on our partr More over departure of the two Ministers would leave the field open to our enemies who would at once organize a movement directed against Great Britain and Russia,, which might eventually spread to Afghanistan* As regards the proposal to make an advance tier Persia Russian Government do not refuse to participate in principle, out consider that lack of money in Persia offers almost insuperable difficulties no actual payment of a loan to the Treasury, and that it would serve no good purpose to place the funds at the disposal of Persian Minister without first studying estimates of expenditure and establishing a certain control oo prevent money being used to the detriment of the Allies^ Russian Government are therefore inclined_to con sider the best means of counteracting the intrigues of the Trinle Alliance,, and of securing the sympathy of tne Persj ans ^ s to hold mo to the latuer (?groups omitued) to lefpeAiaA understand these places will be removed from Turkish domination and in some way 01 other placed in°direct relations with Persia, Russian Government believe this proposal woipd have tne best e.fect. both on (?group omitted) possibility of obtaining certain advantages by joining tne enemies ot pp niVati ntof '' n^vprnment attach special importance to question 01 Kerbela^dtedjef f and retuh to proposal made^^ them at the beginning 01 \?group omiuted) iersia on cA ohe ikhs Repeated to Teherar^ (Repetition of omitted groups asked for)IIW'WIILBilg^iilllWIIIIi li.lfWIw^Wt''- W-HM 'ZH [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless required for official use.] RUSSIA , POLITICALc Decypher Sir Buchanan (Petrograd) September 12thc 1915 D e 3^25„p,m, Tir 5^5rprm r No* 1340* September 13th* 1915 Your telegram No* 2100* Following is repetition last paragraph 'Russian Government are of my telegram No* 1338,n therefore inclined to con sider that the best means of counteracting intrigues of Triple Alliance and secure sympathy of Persians is to hold up to the latter possibility of obtaining certain advantages by joining enemies of Turkey* Russian Gov ernment attach special importance to question of Kerbela and Nedjef and return to proposal made by them at the beginning of the war to let Persians understand that these places will be removed from iurkish domination and in some way or other placed in direct relations with Persia.

Reference to Marling’s telegram 504 F, 1st December. While realising that Marling must be sole judge of actual situation in Tehran, 1 cannot help suspecting that Shah’s sudden desire for alliance with all Allies has been prompted by pro-German advisers at German instigation in order to give Germans time for completion of their plans without interference from Russian troops. Prompt action against rebel gendarmerie and mujahidin at Hamadan, whatever Persian Government may say, would appear essential in order to effect cutting communications of the German marauders with Turkey, and thus isolate them.

Sir Edward Grey considers that it is of urgent importance that some definite effort should be made by His Majesty’s Government in the south in the endeavour to prevent, or at least hinder, the threatened increase of these German Levies, and he is of opinion that the best, and indeed the only, means by which this object can be secured will be the immediate despatch to Ears of some strong Persian Governor General, who will rally round him the more orderly elements in the province and endeavour gradually to restore order and security in Southern Persia. The man whom Sir Edward Grey would suggest for such an appointment is the Zil-es-bultan, who is at present at Nice, and who would, as Sir Edv/ard Grey understands, be prepared to proceed to Persia, provided, of course, that he received the The Under Secretary of State India Office.s ; • v ~ (192200/15) tlie support and sympathy of His Majesty^ Government and the Russian Government. Sir Edward Grey is informed that the Zil considers he could guarantee to reach Shiraz if supported by some two thousand to three thousand British troops, and that from there he would even tually be able to proceed to Ispahan relying on his own resources. It would, however, be necessary, if the proposal is entertained at all, to secure a nreliminary arrangement with the Bahhtiari Khans whereby they would agree not to oppose the new * Governor General in return for certain guarantees and concessions. I am to request that Sir Edward Grey may be favoured with an early intimation of Mr .Chamberlain s views on this question, and that he may be advised as to whether it would be possible to allow the Zil the escort of British troops which he would require. In the event of Mr. Chamberlain considering that the course suggested might be tried, Sir E. Grey is prepared to invite the Zil to come to London in order to discuss the conditions under which he would undertake this appointment, and the measure of support which would be essential to its success. A copy of this letter has been sent to the Y/ar Office, and telegrams have been addressed to His Majesty f s Ambassador at Petrograd to ascertain the(192200/15) the views of the Russian Government and also to His Majesty f s Minister at Tehran requesting his views on the proposal.

The first/■objections do not, 1 think, deserve much consideration. Our immediate object must be to defeat ‘furl® and secure Baghdad^ for its moral and political effect. The third objection might be met by arranging with Russian Government t at in deference to our difficulties in India troops should be instructed to respect shrines and holy places. Immediate Russian advance to i esopotamia would however appear to be military impossibility with force at their disposal. Probably maximum effect of this force both on Persian situation and on Turkish advance on Tig ris would be obtained by their inmediate crushing of all hostile elements between Tehran and Kermanshah and effect ively cutting Turkish conrmmicationc with Tehran.

He told them that expressions of public opinion both in the capital and provinces against alliance and in favour of neutrality were so strong that he feared that he could not run counter to it. He asked what news Russian Minister had from Hamadan and appeared much relieved at learning that strong body of rebels had been routed. I am inclined to think that His Highness while sincere -ly anxious to conclude alliance wishes to await result of Russian operations and to see what effect decisive defeat o^- rebels will have on public opinion before communicating conditions to^us.^ that me confidence of toeing atole to bring about alliance has been much shaken toy a sudden change of attitude on the part of the Bakntian wmen has caused Farman Farma much concern.

I then gave hi^ a verbal sunmary of the viev/s expressed by Mr. Marling in his telegram No. 505. M. de Sazonoff said that while quite alive to the *dif* ficulties with which we were confronted many conditiens whida the Persian Government would probably attach to alliance v were open to grave objections.

Russia had no arms to give but if any were to Goming from other sources he would raise no objection pro* vided the two Governments could exercise effective control their distribution and employment. In this connection he mentioned that the Chief of the General Staff was prepared lx necessary to send some 20 Russian officers to take the place of the Swedes. x As regards financial requirements of the Persian Govern- ment His Excellency said he would never be abl§ to Induce S nis t er Finance to consent to cancellation of debt of 40,000,000 roubles due to Russia or to grant Persia large monthly subvention during the war. Equiping of army of oOOOO ‘ men'would also require large sum and he did not see what services Persia could render us in return for such sac rifices as such an army could not be raised and trained for long time. I did not gather from what His Excellency said that he proposes to aiopt threatening tone at present though he thinlBB we should make it clear to the Persian Government should they show any disposition to side with our enemies how serious would be the consequences of such a pblicy. He quite agreed with what Mr. Marling said in the £ a st paragraph of his-telegram and thinks that it would be better to await result-of Russians at Ramadan before saying anything to the Persian Government.

Sir Edward Grey would be glad to be favoured with an expression of Mr. Chamberlain 1 s opinion on the considerations advanced in the enclosed letter and on the facts reported in the telegram from His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, a copy of which is also transmitted herewith. I am particularly to invite Mr. Chamberlain T s observations on the possible effect v/hich the rupture of negotiations with the Persian Government would now have on Moslem opinion in India, and on the extent to vliich this unfavour able impression would be mitigated by an alliance with the Persian Government concluded under the present conditions of Persian public opinion.

The advantages of such an alliance would, in the circumstances of the case, be based, less on military considerations, then on the moral - impression which would thereby be made on Moslem opinion in India, Egypt and elsewhere. It is hoped, moreover, that this alliance would go far to close the road from Constantinople to India, to I protect the flank of the British forces operating in Mesopotamia and to secure the safety of the Anglo-.ersian Company’s Oil fields. On the other hand, were His Majesty’s Govern ment to reject the terms advanced by the Persian Government, there is good reason to fear that the latter will place themselves unreservedly in the hands [he Secretary to the Army Council.'7 *. (164930/15J hands of our enemies, and a state of wan with lersia would ensue. In submitting; these alternatives for the con sideration of the Army Council, i an to observe that the Persian Government can rely on little support in the countr;/ itself, and that even if the existing Cabinet were to conclude an alliance with Great Britain and Russia, it is doubtful whether they would be in a position to enforce their decision upon the mass of the Persian people, or- to ensure for their allies the advantages enumerated above. It is possible, indeed, that all Western and couth Western Persia would refuse to recognize the engagements undertaken by the Tehran Cabinet, and that the Persian nationalist party, under the leadership of German and Turkish agents, and supported by the Gendarmerie and the Bakhtiari and other tribes, would rise in open revolt against the Persian Govern ment who would appeal for the military support of Great Britain and Russia. Cir Edward Grey is considering, therefore, whether the extravagant concessions which the Persian Government will exact in order to justify their policy to the country, will be outweighed by the positive advantages which would be secured by an alliance concluded in the circumstances outlined above, and I an to invite the views of the Army Council as to Whether the military situation which would14 (184930/15) would be created toy an alliance, would be preferable to either a continuance of the present position, or the adherence ot Persia to the cause of our enemies. ihe cjuestion, in its purely military aspect, would seem to depend on the number of the Russian troops able to advance on Kermanshah, and the extent to which co-operation between these forces and the British troops at Kut el Amara is practicable. A copy of this letter has been sent to His Majesty’s Secretary of state for India, who is being consulted as to the political issues Involved, and I am to request that Sir Edward Grey may be favoured with m expression of the opinion of the Army Council at their earliest possible convenience.

If this is so,chance of concluding axi alliance with Persia is most un favourably affected. Baghdad being (?) relieved and Nixon being presumably in no position to resume advance for the present, I submit it may be assumed that enemy will devote all his attention to his main objective, i.e. forcing Persia into war against us. This will best be achieved by sending all troops that can be spared from watching Nixon into Persia with practical certainty of raising; at least the fife stern provinces against us. Appearance of Turkish army reinforced by gendarmerie and by local levies already being collected, will fire Persia with hope of driving out Russians, and this combined with promises held out by Germans as stated in your telegram No. 427 will make it extremely hard for any Cabinet to join us, except on terms of a most attractive kind. In fact we have to outbid the German terms so heavily as to outweigh disadvantageous military position in which we shall be to Persian eyes if and when Turkish force appears here. Decypher. Mr.Marling. (Teheran) December 4th. E »py to L7 DEC No. 508. (K). Urgent. I do not know how many Russian troops are now inPersia but, all accounts place them at a far lower figure ^ tnan we have been led to expect. 'to - — * the contingency I foresee this will he none too many. having twice put us off Prime Minister,now promises to inform us of Persian requirements on Monday but I have lec,.rnt privately that following points are being considered by Cabinet. 1. Cession (to?) Persia (of?) territory.embracing the holy places including Khadimain together with Baghdad. 2. Cancellation of all Persia's debts to the two Powers. 3. Two Powers to supply arms and a:i .unition for 50,000 8. After the ivar loan of eight million pounds to be arranged by international Syndicate. 9. Revision of tariff. 10, Foreigners to possess real estate in Persia on the same conditions as in Turkey. 11. The Two Powers to guarantee the independence and integrity of Persia. I have, of course, warned the Prime Minister against making exorbitant terms, such as point I, but I have no great confidence that he will be strong enough to stand firm against the pertinacious pro-German party in the Cabinet, possibly the whole list may be presented to us. men. . 4. Large monthly subvention during war. 5. 2.907 Convention to be abrogated. 6. Stipulations of 1911 ultimatum to be CEincelled. 7. Large modifications of treaty of Tmttnanchai. IfIf rny appreciation of Nixon’s position and its con sequences is approximately correct it appears to me immediate acceptance of Persian terms affords the only hope of securing the alliance, but oh that, Considering tiie opportunity there will be for the pro-Germans to prolong negotiations, the chance is net a rosy one* As regards point II', I would remark that the bait of Holy places would secure us support of any number of tribesmen when Nixon is again able to advance.- On the other hand his communications along the Tigris with the frontier tribes hostile would be to say the least of it, very seriously hampered.

Minister for Foreign Affairs said that troops which Russian uovernruent had sit their disposal were not sufficient tc enable oheni to undertake operations either at Khanikin or Kermanshaig, Object of expedition being sent to Hamadan was to suppress gendarmerie and to re-establish order and also to cut off if possible any caravans arriving from Turkey with military supplies. He would however communicate con tents of your telegram to Grand Duke. Sent tc Teheran.h'rom Viceroy, 24:tli November 1915. (Repeated to Tehran.) Foreign Secret. Marling’s telegrams on proposed alliance with Persia. There is no doubt that an alliance with Persia would produce a good moral effect upon Mohammedan public opinion in India and tend to remove bad effect created by our war with Turkey. It would greatly reduce risk of any breach with Afghanistan and remove necessity of further frittering away our military forces in Persia. It should make pipe line secure and render it possible to reduce our forces on Karim. For these reasons an alliance with Persia would be of distinct advantage to India, provided it is not concluded on unduly extravagant political conditions. From Viceroy, ord December 1915. (Repeated to Tehran, 117 D.S.) Foreign Secret. Persia. Reference to Marling’s telegram 504 F, 1st December. While realising that Marling must be sole judge of actual situation in Tehran, I cannot help suspecting that Shah’s sudden desire for alliance with all Allies has been prompted by pro-German advisers at German instigation in order to give Germans time for completion of their plans without interference from Russian troops. Prompt action against rebel gendarmerie and mujahidin at Hamadan, whatever Persian Government may say, would appear essential in order to effect cutting communications of the German marauders with Turkey, and thus isolate them.4 DEC 1915 \ J'c^py to Indsal fO DEC 1915 I l &lt;! v(2wi, (XZcb fj if f &lt;fj- f frv J. t jf'UAj (fr^th f hf^vm, - faluYX dj^ f)~ p\y &lt;^ / &lt;fj~ 'j^ATnrv ^ ^ vmj (fblA/ltjfi (f^ /t/rv C'GsJ&amp;j ^Aa/Wa, £/v\/ £fhjfrnu, f)v /~(W^ftlisfxs f (JVv i/(ut (fC. ^AaAM o^v ftAAj i/i/UAL^fj OlcliA^ '^rv &amp;i\ ion^rruLoU'Uf &amp; / (7U(J[ ^ dU.
