Bruce states that he intends to make Rahim Khan a present of about 1,000 rupees. Bruce also refers to a present for His Royal Highness (see ff 31v-33), which he intends to send with Rahim Khan as an answer to the firmaun. Bruce speculates on the reasons behind His Royal Highness's gift. In addition, he states that he has been informed by the Governor of Bushire, Shaik Abdol Russool [Shaikh ‘Abd al-Rasūl Khān], that His Royal Highness has written to the Shah [Fat'h Ali Shah Qajar], asking him both to accept the mediation of the British Government and to nominate Bruce as a mediator between Persia and Bahrain. The letter is followed by a translation of the firmaun [firman] from His Royal Highness Hossain Ali Meerza to Bruce, which was received on 26 April 1820.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054291.0x00004c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
