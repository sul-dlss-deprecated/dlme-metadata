The buildings at centre of the image have arcades on the lower floor and
                           rawashin(known elsewhere as
                           mashrabiyya, or enclosed balcony) project over the creek from the upper floors. The adjacent building also has two
                           rawashin.Immediately right of centre a pedestrian bridge crosses the creek. The right side of the creek is lined by a stony bank and, at centre right of the image, a built structure which meets the bridge.Damage, printing error or a light leak has caused a band, most discernible at the bottom of the image to appear under-exposed in the print. Graphite appears to have been applied to the print over this area.Inscriptions:Lower left, below image, in pen: ‘Mohammerah’Upper left, above image, in pencil: ‘a’Lower right, alongside image, in pencil: ‘33’Lower right, below image, in pen: ‘(March 1918)’</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023517952.0x000003#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
