This information is given in a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Craven William Fowle) to the India Office on folios 52-56.The papers show that there was a difference of opinion between Fowle and the British Ambassador at Bagdad [Baghdad] (Sir Maurice Drummond Peterson) over whether the Government of Iran was behind the request: Fowle thought they were, Peterson disagreed. The Political Resident was also not in favour of allowing the Iraqi Government to imagine that they were in a special position to interest themselves in the affairs of Kuwait (folio 43). The file also contains correspondence from the Foreign Office.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Shīʻah</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001de#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
