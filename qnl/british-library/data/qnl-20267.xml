I have nolr to report that acting on your verbal instructions given me on 28th April 1931 to the effect that I should endeavour to persuade His Excel lency the Shaikh of Kuwait to reduce his claims to such facts and figures as would effectually prevent H.M.King Bin Saud from challenging or trying to evade them by denial and argument, I called on H.E. the Shaikh on the 3rd and 4th May and after fully discussing the matter, was successful in getting him to agree to withdraw claims III; IV and V as submitted by me in my despatch referred to above. As the first two of these constituted by far the largest claims cf Kuwait, I think we may feel satis fied with the result. 3« The withdrawal of claims III; IV and V reduces the total claims of Kuwait against H.M.Bin Saud from Is. 111,58,590/- to Rs 14,86,590/- or in more familiar language from approximately 111^ lacs to 14t lacs. 4. In agreeing to waive the above claims H.E. the Shaikh urged very strongly that King Bin Saud shouldbe told, by His Majesty's G-overnment, when the tiine comes to present the claims, what His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait's original claims had been, and what he had agreed to sacrifice in deference to the wishes of His Majesty's Government, and out of an ernest desire not to embarrass His Majesty or make it difficult for him to arrive at a final and honourable settlement. 5. The Shaikh's view is, and I am inclined to agree, that whatever be the size of the bill presented, H.M.King Bin Saud will on principle straightaway endeavour to cut it down by half, the bargaining habit being strongly developed in him. It would considerably help matters there# fore, if from the oommencement the idea could be conveyed, that the Shaikh of Kuwai t had for his part agreed to re duce his claims from the large figure of 111-^ lacs, down to lacs. *&gt;• Another request which the Shaikh made was that my original despatch N00I86 dated 18th March 1930 submitting Kuwait's claims be forwarded to His Majesty's Government as an accompaniment to the present report, if this has not been done already, as he was anxious that His Majesty's Government should realize from figures not only how greatly Kuwait had suffered at the hands of H.M.King Bin Saud in the past, but how genuine was the effort that he, the Shaikh of Kuwait, was now pre fared to make in order to settle this vexed question© The Shaikh went further and asked me to again remind you that he would be prepared to drop all claims altogether, if H.M.Bin Saud would da ?ef adopt a reasonable and friendly attitude and permit unrestricted trade between Kuwait and the interior once more. ^ To turn now to those claims that are left, namely claim 1(A); 1(B) and claim II, which for easy re ference are again being submitted with this despatch, as representing the final and irreducible minimum demands of Kuwait, I beg to offer the following remarks. CLAIMS 1(A) AKD KB ).The Shaikh and I went tiiro|Lgh each item under these heads to see whether any possible reduction could be made in value or numbers, but we were unsuccessful, so both, I think, must be considered as final figures, and the remarks made by me /St in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 5 of my despatch 189 dated 18th March 1930 concerning these claims should still stand&lt;, I did endeavour to persuade the Shaikh to agree to the n Rial M being calculated at a figure less than Rs 2/- for working out losses in men, animals etc. (vide paragraph 4 of des- P patch 189 dated 18th March. 1931) but he was quite adamant on the point saying that for most of the blockade period, the 'Rial* 1 had stood nearer to Rs 3/- and only as a con cession to me had ie originally in March 1930 agreed to ©educe it to the average figure of Rs 2/-. It was quite true, he added, that to-day (May 193l)the Rial had fallen to 10 annas, but that was none of his fault, and should in no way be allowed to affect Kuwait r s just claims. With this view, I cannot but agree. CLAIM II , This claim, though a small one, the Shaikh feels very bitter about. Apparently he looks upon it as a debt of honour, and says he possesses the original letter from H.M.Bin Saud asking him to lend him the money mentioned as a short date loan and supply him with foodstuffs for his army in the form of 1000 ba^s of rice, also on loan. H.M.King Bin Saud has made not the slightest effort to reptty the money since 1919-20 when the loan was negociated. In deference to the Shaikh's feelings, I am of qpinion that this claim should stand it only to bring home to the King that he has badly defaulted. According to the Shaikh, the claim cannot be denied by King Bin Saud, nor will he attempt to do so, in face of the documentary evidence in his poss ession. Q* In conclusion there is one particular point which I would suggest should not be lost sight of byHis Majesty* s Govsnmnsnt when it comes to presenting the King witli Kuwait* s bill # It concerns claims 1(B) and has been partly dealt wilii in paragraph 5 of my original despatch on this subject. If each item of the claim be examined, it will be seen tiiat in only 6 out of a total of 17 cases of aggr^feion and violation of Kuwait territory have claims been pre ferred. This is important and is a point greatly in Kuwait * s favour. Actually from personal knowledge and as a result of my having made many enquiries from ihe Bedouin of the interior, both Kuwaitis and Nejdis, I am quite satisfied that the damage done by Bin Saud's paid forces on Kuwait tribesmen and shepherds during the period under review came to quite as much as that claimed under 1(A) if not more® It is unfortunate therefore that only Rs 54,900/- has been claimed under this head and it is entirely due to the Shaikh's laudable desire to put in no claim that cannot be supported by documoatary evidence as recorded and registered at the time. s I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant Lieut-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait.■ % Claim I (B). t ^ y i i ^1 I | Arising from direct attacks made by H.M.King Bin Saud's paid forces (Sirriya) operating inside Kuwait Territory.

Busliire, the 13th May 1931, ly Lord, I hare the honour to address Your Lordship regarding the claims of the Kuwait State against His Majesty King Ibn Saud on account of raids into Kuwait territory fcy Hejd tribes, and to forward two letters received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, on the subject. ! ■ , { 2. The first letter is dated the 18th March 1930 and with it Colonel Dickson forward claims of the Shaikh of Kuwait, amounting to 111 lakhs, I did not forward Colonel Dickson's letter on at the time as the question of negotiating a treaty between I^ejd and Kuwait, under which pr oris ion would be made for the settlement of claims on the lines of the Bahra agreement, was under consideration, and I thought it would be preferable first of all to arrange machinery for the settlement of claims and subsequently to submit the claims* Uo treaty howerer has yet been negotiated between Hejd and Kuwait and any agreement that may be come to will I think be drawn up more or less on tribal lines, and while provid ing, I hope, for the settlement of future claims of a minor Rt.Hon f ble Lord Passfield,P»C«, His Majesty 1 s Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, London#minor natu^ e f 1 doubt if it will be possible to make any provision for the settlement of tliese large claims in connection with the organized and systematic raids carried out by Bin Baud's troops and the 'iUchwan 1 . 3 # Further, it struck me that the claims were in many cases excessive and that it would not be desirable to submit claims on account of loss of trade, etc*, and I was anxious to discuss this matter with the Shaikh before forwarding his bill* I hare recently discussed the whole matter with the Political Agent and the Shaikh and they are both of opinion that the only chance of obtaining any compensation for the Kuwait tribes, other than the S 3000 already received, is for a bill to be submitted to the Sejd authorities by His Majesty's Government on behalf oi Kuwait and to try and obtain a lump sum as has been done by the •Iraq authorities. They consider that past experience has shown that any reference to a tribunal would be a pure waste of time* 4 # I am glad to say that, as will be seen from Colonel Dickson's second letter, the Shaikh has agreed to withdraw his claims on account of loss of trade, etc. I pointed out to him that such claims would be impossible to substantiate and would inevitably open the way to endless discussions. It was far better to submit only those claims of which the Kuwait authorities had strong proof, and to accept any reasonable sum that Ibn Gaud was prepared to offer in settlement* The S..aikh has therefore now reduced his claims to 14i lakhs of which Ks. 13,48,590 is on account of direct attacks made by His Majesty King Ibn Saud's paid forces operating inside Kuwait territory, or from Akhwan raids, while Rs*1,38,000 is on account of money •••J * &lt;$ A- money and supplies advanced by His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait to Kin^* Ibn Saud in 1919-20. These are all well substantiated claims which it would seem difficult for the Hejd authorities to refute, and I trust His Majesty's Government will aee fit to instruct His Majesty^s Minister at Jeddah to submit them in due course to the Hejd Grovernment, n 5 # In this connection I would however inlrite particular attention to statement contained in paragraph 6 of Colonel Dickson's despatch Mo.66 of the 7th May stating that the Shaikh would be prepared to drop all claims if Hii Majesty King Ibn Saud would raise no restrictions on trade at present imposed on Kuwait and the interior# 6. As I am proceeding to London in about a fort night's time,and as I understand Sir Andrew Ryan will also be in London this summer, I would suggest that the matter might be discussed there before any definite action is taken in respect of these claims* 7, I am sending copies of this despatch to His Jajesty*s Minister at Jeddah and to the Government of India* 'w ^ /j. s--''; 5' £^4 Af f- /l I have the honour to be f Your Lordship's most obedient, humble servant, . ! jp t ( J7r^ Lt.Colonel, ^' Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Copy forwaraed to the Political Agent, Kuwait, for information, reference his letter Ho. 6b, dated 7th May 1951. &gt; Attested ; Confidential Assistant, Bus hi re , ^ ancl ComJulate -^ enera i •fQ\\ (o) -&gt; S 1956—2,000—9-14—(B2J Spl~Re8dt P 9 118 No. 267-S of 1931.

He must make it clear in the first place that if this were done no tangible results could possibly be achieved at the present time or m the near future. In his present financial circumstances, which were extremely grave, King Ibn Saud had difficulty in finding £ 1,000; to present him with a bill for about £ 110,000 woula merely appear to him to be a demonstration of hostility• LT.GOL.BISGOE AKD LT•COL.DICKSON observed that the Shaikh of Kuwait felt very deeply on the subject of these claims* Most of them arose, not from ordinary inter-tribal raiding, but from the action of King Ibn Saud's paid forces, operating in Kuwaiti territory at a time when there was nominally peace between Kuwait and l^ejd. Moreover they included cj-aims in respect of money and supplies actually advanced by the Shaikh to King Ibn Saud during the latter*s campaign against Hail in 1919/1920. They had been drastically cut down, and as they now stood were of a very solid nature and in many cases capable of documentary proof. MR. FLOOD remarked that the manner of their presentation was exceptionally good and complete# LT. G0L. BISC0E-2- LT, COL. BISGOE reminded the meeting that the Shaikh of Kuwait had expressed readiness to waive the whole of his claim in return for the raising of the M blocic.ade tt • Even if there was no hope of any payment being made, might it not be well for the bill nevertheless to be presented to the Hejazi Govern ment at Jedda in order to lead up to a proposal for its cancellation in return for the raising of the 'blockade'» which ■\/7Q\j_2.d. be made at the contemplated conversations between himsej-i and King Ibn Saud ? After discussion on this point the meeting agreed that such a step would be unwise. The result would probably be that the proposed meeting betv/een King Ibn Saud and Lt» Colonel Biscoe would never take place, and that the King'would decline altogether to enter into conversations regarding Kuwaiti matters. In the circumstances the best course appeared to be that the claim should be held over until conversations were opened with King Ibn Saud, and that then what use might be possible should be made of it as a lever in the negotiations. xx x x x Xft..

Following is gist of Quad's reply of August 22nd, to my personal letter:- w I will deal with suhject of your personal letter 'before replying to your note. There are many reasons for this# Two most important reasons are these. firstly, intimation regarding claims is like a threat to enforce settlement completely independent of question of commercial relations. Secondly, their presentation shows clearly dis regard 'by Kuwait of international agreements, and it is no use concluding I further) agreements if such agreements are not respected. Trade negotiations are more advantageous to Kuwait than to Nejd hut King does not, out of consideration for Kuwait and desire to please H.M # s Government,01)J ect to an agreement confer- -ring equal mutual advantages. He agrees in principal to commission of delegates hut prefers, My telegram No.169 of 25th August I sent copies of my note and per- in view of ...in view of your personal comaamication concern- -ing claims, to postpone it pending settlement of latter question* -Reasons are that on one hand most claims are probably not genuine, and on other hand there are large -^ejdi claims against Kuwait to he considered simultaneously. It is a serious consideration moreover that claims were settled reciprocally some months ago and disavow- ~al of this settlement necessitates caution until Kuwait's willingness to respect agreements is established. Biscoe and Dickson discussed mutual claims at Hasa on January 27th. It was agreed to 'bury them and that King should write to Bhaikh. Letter was written on S3th January and given to Biscoe and Dickson for delivery. Shaikh replied on Peh- -ruary i6th agreeing to hury all claims save one which had been specifically excepted. I enclose copies of these letters to assure you of facts of settlement and in order that you may ascertain whether Bhaikh seriously intends to return to this confusion of claims. As regards loans at time of operations against Hail, King admits them hut is uncertain of details which are lecorded in records in possess- -ion of Mafisi. He recollects wanting to 'buy rice hut Bhaikh insisted on making it a gift and the same happened as regards loan. King will however pay immediately if Shaikh makes claim. I request you after reading enclosed letters, to inform me of decision of your Government and Shaikh* 's in order that I may deal appropriately with 'both matters. * Following is...UM Following is gist of my rejoinder dated August 25tli:- ' I am shocked at suggestion that personal letter, confirming tor your convenience my oral communication, should 'be construed as a threat. It is guite usual, and implies no threat, to foreshadow concession on some other question when States are discussing import- -ant 'business* Only subject under discussion is that of restrict -ions on trade* I was instructed, when pursuing of- -ficially, suggestion made 'by King himself at Hasafto make friendly intimation regarding claims. My Govern- -ment will he gravely disappointed to learn that King proposes to allow this to delay main question. I ask him to reconsider Ms attitude. If claims beeoma subject to official discussion King can contest them. Having no instructions to present them hut merely to inform you of their exis- -tence and foreshadow concession,!cannot discuss claims or effect thereon of correspondence which you enclose. I have some knowledge of this correspondence though only that hitherto in my possession is King's letter of ^ecemher 30th. So far as I know Biscoe and Dickson and Shaikh considered it to relate only to i small trihal questions. Claims of the very kind in first two parts of list are subject of important ques- •tion long familiar to 'both Grovernments though His M&lt;3(jesty # s Government have for some time past refrained from pursuing it for reasons explained to you.

NCY« £ - j ii Downing Street, December, 1932, Sir, v iW- f r r I have tlie honour to refer to your confidential despatches Nos«42 and 43 of the 13th and 17th September regarding the claims of the Sheikh of Kuwait against King Ibn Saud, and to inform you that the matter has been considered in consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for India. S. On consideration of the information contained in the enclosures to your despatches, it appears that there is at any rate room for doubt whether the Sheikh 1 s view as to the correct significance of the correspondence which passed between himself and Ibn Saud in January and February last is sufficiently well founded to enable His Majesty 1 s Government to press this view upon Ibn Saud with any great prospect of success. If this is the ca.se, it is not unlikely that the only result of taking up the matter officially with the Saudi Government v/ould be to postpone indefinitely the appointment of the proposed commission which is to endeavour to secure a settlement of the blockade question. 3, The strength of the Sheikh 1 s case appears to depend upon the exact meaning of the Arabic terms used in THE HONOURABLE THE POLITICAL RESIIMT IN THE PERSIAN GULF.in tlie correspondence. If it is certain that the only reasonable interpretation of these terms limits the correspondence to bad or doubtful claims and also to claims between the nationals, as distinct from the Governments, of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, there would be a stronger case for taking up the point officially with Ibn Saud, but in that event it is suggested that it would be more appropriate and more likely to be successful if the Sheikh himself explained to Ibn Saud his interpretation of the correspondence. 4, This course would appear to have several advantages. In the first place,the Sheikh could speak more authoritatively than Mr.Hope Gill on this question of the precise meaning of certain local Arabic terms. Secondly, it seems fitter that the Sheikh and the King should themselves settle the misunderstanding as to the significance of letters exchanged between them. Thirdly, from the tactical point of view the King appears ■ from past experience far more likely to yield gracedfolly in such a matter if approached direct by the Sheikh than if the question is made the subject of diplomatic correspondence with His Majesty's Government. Moreover, if this suggestion is put to the Sheikh,the nature of his reply will go a long way to indicate whether he is in fact convinced that the words in dispute can rightly bear only the interpretation v /hich he has put forward, or whether, in explaining the matter to Lieutenant Colonel Dickson, he was, as seems at least possible, overstating his case.5. On the other hand, if there is any real doubt as to the correctness of the interpretation of the coxresponctence, there might 'be an advantage in at once dropping such of the claims as are not admitted by King Ibn Saud, namely all except the claims in respect of money and supplies advanced by the ; Sheikh to the King in 1919-1920,and making such use as may be possible of this concession in order to secure an understanding from the King that he will facilitate the consideration of the questions arising out of the blockade of Kuwait, S.

I enclose copies of the correspondence which jjassed between His Excellency and myself, and which exjjlains itself. As you will see His Excellency did not react very favourably to the su^-estion that he should write to His Majesty, and instead suggests yet another committeet to pronounce upon the correct interpretation of the letters in question. 3.

He is definitely unwilling to irritate Ibn Saud in any way - as can be seen from the tone of his letter to me which ends with the words; ''This provided His Majesty agrees'. His Excellency, as he informed me, regards His Majesty's Government as responsible for protecting his interests against Ibn Saud, and obviously wishes that any further communications upon this unpleasant subject should come from us, and not from himself• 4# /ith regard to what action should be taken on the Siiaikh* s su gestion.

As Sir Philip Cunlif fe -Xister is aware, he feels much sympathy with the Sheikh of Koweit and attaches importance to doing anything possible to meet his legitimate case in regard to the Saudi blockade on his land irontier. But. he feels strongly at the same time that if the Sheikh wishes His Majesty's Government to li^ht uhe case for him His Excellency must be prepared to come into the open, and either face the risk of causing offence to Ibn saud (who has not shown himself unduly tender of Kowelti susceptibilities or interests in recent years) or preferably cease to pursue the point regarding the ^aid claims now in issue• He is not disposed uo regard the establishment of a committee to giye a ruling on the meaning of the correspondence now in question as a satisfactory solution of the difficulty which 1ms arisen. 2. Subject to the views of the other interested Departments sir 3. Hoare is inclined in these circumstances go think that the Sheikh should be informed that His Majesty T s Government cannot regard the suggestion of a c ommittee/ Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, s.wa. 1°^ hA&lt;)h ' jV&gt; 1° U ' \ ooiBmittQe to decide on the interpretation of his letter r of loth February 19j2 to Ibn Sand as satisfactory, the X ^ossible alternatives now appear to be (a) that he should himself pursue the interpretation of the correspondence of last February direct with Ibn Saud, (b) that if he feels reluctant to adopt this course, he should aithorise His Majesty's Goyernment to inform Ibn Saud on his behalf that he had no intention in the correspondence in question of disposing of any but entirely minor or local claims, or (c) - which appears to Sir 3. Hoare to be the preferable alternative - that we should accept the position that the situation has been irremediably compromised by the correspondence in question, and wholly abandon these claims (making such merit as is possible of the Sheikh's acting in doing so) in order to remove the obstacle which they corBtitute to the appointment of a Blockade Commission* J. Sir S. Hoare would suggest that the Political Resident should be instructed at the outset of his communication to the Sheikh to remind His Excellency, in a friendly and sympathetic spirit, of the history of the events which have led to the it esent impasse , His Majesty' Government have all along been making every endeavour to secure a settlement of the blockade question satisfactory to the Sheikh. The proposed appointment of a Gommission, which appears to be the most promising avenue towards a satisfactory settlement that has yet been suggested, emerged f r om//r-\ | V y &gt; -V \ mm ^ from Colonel Bisoo© T s conversations with Ion Saud in January 1932, daring whioli the whole subject was discussed from every angle. When this proposal was formally made to the Hejaz Government they stated that the King agreed in principle but preferred to postpone the Gommission pending a settlement of the Question of claims, which had been raised at the same time but which the King contended had already been waived in the Sheikh T s letter of l6th February 1932. 4. It appears to Sir Samuel Hoare that with a view to securing the appointment of the Blockade Comission the Sheikh would be well advised to drop the raid claims on which presumably there is virtually no prospect of securing any satisfaction from Ibn Saud, especially as it- is' impossible to ignore that they have been compromised ^£^by the Sheikh T s letter of loth February I932. He would therefore suggest that the Resident should be instructed, while putting the three alternatives and avoiding any language likely to give offence to the Sheikh, to advise him in favour of course (c) above. In making this suggestion Sir S. Hoare is strongly influenced by the probability that either (a) or (b) would lead to fruitless correspondence which would ire vitably delay, and might altogether jeopardise, the chance of s ettling the blockade question. 5• As Sir Philip Gunliffe-Lister is aware from recent despatches from the Political Resident in the Persian Qulf, the delay in disposing of this question and the failure of His Majesty T s Government effectively to protect the Sheikh T s interests in regard to it are, apparently, with other factors, contributing to weaken the Sheikh T s belief in t he value of t he pr ot ect i on aff orded him by His Majesty T s Government and the sincerity of their undertakings to/V /T^N Y to him. The serious delay whioh has taken place in advancing the matter now under discussion is to no small extent due (as the political Resident might be authorised to emphasize to the Sheikh) to the Sheikh f s independent correspondence with Ibn Saud and to the difficulty which has been experienced in securing any definite reply from him to the enquiries made by the Political Resident. It is, at all events, desirable to reduce any further delay tea minimum; and Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest that the Resident should be asked to deal with the matter as expeditiously as possible and on a telegraphic basis, with a view to the early resumption at Jedda of the discussions on the subject of the blockade. 6, A copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office.

Mr. tAlTtnTAIIB suggested thnt if the Sheikh were vo gire up his claims. His Majectjr'e Oowernment should first Invite Xbn X • a to fulfil his original undertaking to appoint a Ssudi-Xoweit blockade commission. It would not be possible to deal sr.tiafectorily with the blockade problem until the Saudi-'fronsJordan treaty negotiations, at present in pi-ogress, were satisfactorily concluded. This might mean a of several monthe, and it was undesirable that any considerable length of time should elapse between the Sheikh's abandonment of his claims end the first move of Bis Majesty's Oovernnent towsrds solving the olockade problem; on the otherhsnd, the interval that would elapse between His Majesty's Government* sqh Qorernmeat V revival or the question at Jedda and the conolusion ot the Saudi-Tr one Jordan negotiations would prol3at&gt;ly he long enough to show the hollwmeae of Iha ?aud a offer ot a cosuniesion# and Hts Majesty 4 8 Government would then be Tree to try other tactics* Mr® EKKD35L observed that ^ according to present indications j Ibn Saud desired a Transjordan-Saudi settlement and it was likely that a settlement would ue reached in the comparatively near futurea He had himself recently mentioned in convereacion Aith the Saudi Minister that, after a ratisfnctory settlement had been reache d with Trt.n^JordiUfcf it would remain to reach a similar settlement with Koweit* The 'audi Minister had seemed to welcome this suggestion. The POLITICAL RESIDENT expressed the view that as little was likely to come of Ihn Saudis proposal for a :c-rroulesion, as he *7ould only relax the hlockade under p .ce b it wculd he as well to have some concrete suggestion to urge upon him. He would probably revert to the other proposals which he had made on this subject in the past, namely, either that the Sheikh of Xcwett should pay an annual lump sum to him in respect of Saudi Customs dues in Koweit, or that he (Ibn Saud) should maintain aa agent in Koweit* Both these proposals had proved object j - ob fble to the Sheikhn i'here was* howevert a third suggestion which had also been made previously* namely» that a number of Saudi Customs posts should be set up outside Koveit* The Sheikh had agreed to thiB 9 at the timet but Ibn Saud had rejected it on the score of the expense involved^ This excuse was clearly unjustifiable^ since/&amp; c(Y ] Blnco the posts kept up l&gt;y Iton Gaud to asintoln the tolocfcado ohrloualy coat as much as would customs posts to control tradOt rind Colonel Fowls suggested that Ihn Saud might be pressed once j*Te to accept this eolutiono llr« BI*/vXTSR suggested that In view of past delays in the handling of this question, %% was undesirahle that too ouch insistence should he laid on the Sheikh's responsibility for the present position in discussing it with hinu It was agreed:- (i) that the Political Hesident should on his return to the Persian Gulf interview the Sheikh and put before him the three alternatives outlined abovej , (8) that if fi after ihe question of the claims had been disposed of 0 the Saudi blockade nevertheless continued 8 Hie Majesty 's Government should take the question up at Jedda nnd should instruct Bis Majesty 's Minister to inform Ibn Saud that they desired to reach a settlement of the questions outstanding between Saudi Arabia snd Koweit» They would consider in the light of Ibn Saud's reply ^oit steps should be token to this end© (5) that on receipt of the present record^ the Oolonial Office should issue confirmatory inatimctione to the political Reeldent*COHFIBSKTIAL K0.547-S of 1933.
