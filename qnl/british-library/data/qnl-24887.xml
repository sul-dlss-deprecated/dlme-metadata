Lord Lansdowne is of opinion that it is very desirable to obtain a prompt and definite settlement of this question, and that the present reply of the Mushir-ed-Dowleh cannot be accepted by His Majesty's Government as satisfactory. \ His Lordship would therefore propose, if Mr. Brodrick concurs, to address a despatch to Sir A. Hardinge, as suggested by him, taking note of the formal admission now made by the Persian Government of the original meaning attached by them to the term 'Pars and the Persian Gulf', and notifying the view held by His Majesty's Government in the matter accompanied by an intimation that they will take the necessary steps to secure respect for their rights in the event of the Persians attempting to ignore them. Sir A. Hardinge might be instructed to communi cate3opy&lt; U-4 \ l! nu Confidential. G U L A H E K, June 20th, 1904. I/iy Lorci:- I have the honour to transmit herewith, /\ with reference to my telegram No. 71 of to-day's date, a translation of the reply addressed by tne Persian Government to my last representations respect ing the meaning attached by it to the term 'Customs ,of Pars and of the Persian Gulf”. The note represents an obvious compromise on the part of the Ain-ed-Dowleh between the oppos ing recommendations of the Mushir-ed-Dowlen and of Monsieur Naus. The view of Monsieur Naus was that it was in Persia’s interest to circumscribe as mucn as possible the scope of the Russian loan contracts, that the assurance given to us in 1397 strengtnened the means at her disposal for doing uilo, and thao a reference to this assurance might therefore usexully he inserted in the Persian Government's reply to me. Tho Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. ■ Ii 'l I * If]The Mushir-ed-Dowleh considered that the assur ance of 1897 was an inconvenient one^ and that it could he regarded as modified hy Sir Mortimer Durand’s subsequent notes, which His Excellency held might, and ought to he construed as confin ing it to the 'ports of Pars' in the literal sense of the term. Had the Mushir had his way he would, I have little douht, have answered that the expression 'Customs of Pars aid the Gulf' had been borrowed from Sir Mortimer Duraid, that it was therefore our fault, not that of the Persiai Government, if it Inadequately expressed the ports which we wished to exclude from the Russian guar antee and that it would be time to refer the whole question to arbitration when it arose in a con crete as distinct from an abstract form. The Ain-ed-Dowleh, in his final instructions to His Excellency, has evidently followed a middle course He has adopted Monsieur Naus* declaration of the intention of the Persian Government to exclude all the ports of the South from the Russian guarantee.tut he has avoided the reference which that Minister had put into his original draft to the engagement of 1897. Prom the Mushir-ed-Dowleh he has borrowed the idea of contingent appeal to arbitration. The note has, however, the merit of affording a formal explanation of the sense in which the Persian Govern ment used the words in dispute, and I therefore thought it best when the Mushir-ed-Dowleh showed it to me privately yesterday, to let him send it in as it stood, rather than suggest amendments and modifi cations which would have necessitated a fresh ence to the Shah, have delayed the delivery of the reply, and perhaps have ended in its assuming a still less satisfactory form. His Excellency ouserved that it would satisfy His Majesty's Government and close the controversy. I said that I would in wilt ing to Your Lordship express this hope, but that I could not answer for the view which you would take of it and that the last portion certainly seemed to me to open the door to further discussion. The Mushir said. as the Prime Minister had done in speak ing(Signed) Arthur H.Hardinge. speaking to me on the subject on the 18th instant, that the Persian Government wished the contents of the note to he kept secret and confidential as they deprecated a discussion of the question with the Russian Government to which I understand they have decided to make no communication on the sub ject. n c ■ I would venture respectfully to suggest that whatever reply Your Lordship thinks fit to make to this latest communication, it should, in order to ca.ry greauen weight, be embodied in a despatch from me for suomission to the Shall, rather than r in a further note to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh from myself.

Rehbi-us-Sani 1322. June 19th. 1904. In answer to Your Excellency's note regarding the definition of the expression 'Customs of Ears and the Gulf of Ears' I have the honour to state that the exclusion of the Customs of Ears and the Gulf of Ears from the guarantee for the loans from the Russian Bank of 1900 and 1902 had this object; the intention of the Persian Government v/as without doubt to preserve in freedom all its full rights of possession (hukuk i tesarrufat) over all the ports of the south, and in u using the term Customs of Ears and th e Gulf .o f Ears the Persian Government v/as convinced that their object had been entirely attained, since as I have already explain ed to you, in the last letter of the British Legauion on this subject your predecessor only made mention of the ports of Ears. Now, however, under the present Sir A. Hardinge, K.C .M.G.,C .B., &amp;c., &amp;c.circumstances, the two loan contracts hold good as they stand and it is not possible for the Imperial Government of Persia to alter any article of them, nor to inter pret them without the participation of the Russian Bank by saying that statements made in them have such and such a meaning, because the very doubt referred to by Your Excellency as to whether Mohammerah is or is not one of the ports of the Gulf of Ears shows the possibi lity of a discussion on the subject; and in this case should, contrary to all expectation, the Customs guar- antee given by the Imperial Government of Persia, take effect, the question of Mohammerah will certainly have to be referred to an arbitration the result oi which it is impossible for the Persia.n Government to predict.

[June 13.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 14. No. 1. Sir A. Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—(Received June 13.) (No. 85. Very Confidential.) My Lord, Tehran, May 19, 1904. I HAVE the honour to report that the Prime Minister has sounded me, for the first time since his assumption of office, on the subject of financial assistance. I inclose a Memorandum of a conversation which he had on the 15th instant with Abbas Kuli Khan, whom I had sent to him with some unimportant message. Your Lordship will observe the note of mistrust for the Mushir-ed-Dowleh which pervades his Highness’ remarks. With respect to the “treason ” of the Beglarbegi and Nasr-es- Saltaneh in selling the Kazian Hoad to the Russians, a transaction which I had the honour to report in my despatch No. 25 of the 5th February last, I suspect that the Ain-ed-Dowleh wished to justify an act of extortion in our eyes by representing its victim as a Russian agent, but that rapacity rather than patriotism was its real motive, though the latter may have afforded a convenient pretext. I gave Abbas Kuli Khan the reply of which I have the honour to inclose a copy, for verbal delivery to the Prime Minister, and his Highness reverted to the subject at an interview which I had with him yesterday. He said that he was not in any pressing want of money ; that he had always been opposed to his predecessor s system of meeting any temporary deficit by foreign loans, which he agreed with me in regarding as disastrous ; that he had kept clear of them during the eight months that he had been in office, and hoped to continue to do so. But he wanted to know if he could count on us should any sudden emergency oblige him to raise a fairly large sum of money, say 800,000 tomans (160,000/.) or to provide a reserve fund at short notice. # , I reminded him of our conversation on his accession to office in which I had fully explained to him the policy of His Majesty’s Government to this country. As I had then told him, we were ready to complete the advance of the 4th April, 1903, on the security which I had already indicated to him, without any political conditions. Such conditions would, however, have to be discussed if any further financial assistance was demanded of us. In the meantime he could, I thought, from private inquiries which I had made, easily obtain another 50,000/. (200,000 tomans) on account current from the Imperial Bank of Persia. The completion of the advance of Apiil of last year would give him another 500,000 tomans, i.e., a total of 700,000 tomans (or at the present rate of exchange rather more) which was only 20,000/. less than the amount which he had named to me. The Ain-ed-Dowleh said that he sincerely trusted that he might avoid any fresh borrowings ; that there was no need for me to report to your Lordship at the present juncture that he wanted money; and that if he should eventually do so, he would send M. Naus to see me about it. The Customs were doing very well, though their receipts had been to some slight extent diminished by the cholera outbreak in Bagdad and Kermanshah. I was a good deal surprised at the hints dropped by his Highness that he might need assistance from us, as, so far as I was able to learn, the finances of the Peisian Government are in a fairly satisfactory condition. I calculate that the Ain-ed-Dowleh has wrung nearly 100,000/. from the provincial Governors and his Ministerial colleagues in connection with the present Budget, of which between 10,000/. and 15,000/. has gone into his Highness’ own pocket. Thus, to take only well authenticated payments, I know for a fact that the Minister of Telegraphs has had to pay 14,300/. for the retention of bis post during the present year, instead of the 6,000/. which he used to give in the time of the Atabeg, and winch enabled him to make a very hand some profit out of his office. 46,000/. has been paid for his appointment by the Naser- es-Saltaneb, who has been made Minister of Crown Domains, and 18,000/., exc usive of a personal present of 5,000/. to the Prime Minister, by the new Governor-General of Khorassan „ The Chief Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, with whom M. Naus is transacting the Government business in connection with the new financial arrange ments, has, moreover, obtained from his Directors a large discretion in the matter 12025 n —14]of advances to the Persian Government even beyond the limits of the Concession in the form of discounts on payments due to it, and he tells me that he could easily at a moment’s notice, provide 50,000/. if the Ain-ed-Dowleh asked him for it, and probably also arrange for a much larger sum, provided that some such guarantee or quasi-guarantee, as I mentioned in my despatch No. 53, Confidential, of the 24th March was given to the Board by your Lordship. He added, however, that although M. Naus was aware that he could draw upon him without difficulty, no application D had for some time past been made to him, and that his Excellency had 'iven him to understand that the Persian Government were not now in need of monev. Abbas Kuli Khan suggested to me that the only explanation of the Ain-ed- Lowleh’s language was that the Shah, whose health, as your Lordship knows is bad, and who is fretting for change and new amusements, has been pressing for money for another European tour, and he has reason to believe that the courtiers have been telling His Majesty that Paris is much gayer and more lively in late autumn and winter than in summer. This conjecture proves correct, for by a curious coincidence a member of the Persian Government has just informed Mr. Preece that the Shah, w T ho is becoming increasingly feeble, has told the Ain-ed-Dowleh that he left the whole management of public affairs in his hands, and that he might do what he thought advisable, but that the one thing on which His Majesty insisted was that a fund of some 600 000 or 800,000 tomans, about 140,000/., very much the amount mentioned to me by the Prime Minister, should be set apart to enable him to pay a visit this autumn or next spring to Europe. I have no doubt that the Ain-ed-Dowleh will do all he can to delay the gratification of the Shah’s wishes as long as he can, consistently with his own personal safety, but that what he wants is to feel sure that if the worst comes to the worst, he can obtain the money without having to apply to the Russians. That the latter would refuse it, owing to their Ear Eastern embarrass ments is, I think unlikely, in view of the fact that they thought it worth while only a few weeks ago to lend, as reported in my despatch No. 46 of the 16th March last, 130.000/ to the Valiahd on inadequate security. At any rate, it would not be prudent to take it for granted. ft must be borne in mind that it is always open to them to apply for such a purpose the annual interest received by the Bank on the two loans of 1900 and 1902, which would easily cover such a sum as the Shah has asked for. But they would doubtless require a political equivalent, and it would appear that the one at which they have actually hinted is an extension of the term during which Persia is forbidden to raise a loan without their consent. A mere extension of this term, objectionable as it would be from our point of view, would not, however, do them very much good, unless it was accompanied by a prohibition of more than carefully limited borrowings from the Imperial Bank, such as they have already more than once suggested; but I feel sure the Ain-ed-Dowleh, and even the Atabeg, would be too shrewd to venture into that net. It may be doubted whether a European tour before next spring, supposing the 8hah lives till then, would prove of any real advantage to His Majesty’s health, as now that the hot weather has commenced, he could not even travel till it was over, and he could hardly go to German waters in the winter. He seems to be no better, and while I have not heard of late that the nephritic symptoms are more alarming, he is increasingly subject to fits of dizziness and giddiness which reduce him, while they last, to a condition of collapse. The Zil-es-Sultan, who took leave of him a few days ago, found him in bed, and gave me a very bad account of his condition. His Majesty starts in ten days’ time for the country, travelling very slowly, and resting for a few days at three Palaces on the way to his chief seat in Shimran. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARD INGE,. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum. course I HAD an interview yesterday evening with the Grand Vizir. His Highness, in the &gt;e of conversation, referred to the pecuniary difficulties experienced bv the Persian - — pecuniary difficulties experienced by the Persian Government in carrying out the reforms, and the unacceptable conditions proposed by theRussian Bank whenever asked for an advance on account current, while the Imperial Bank, to his Highness’ satisfaction, was always prepared to meet the wishes of the Persian Government as much as possible. His Highness then asked me, confidentially, whether the Imperial Bank was in a position to advance a sum of 1,000,000 tomans (about 200,000/.) to the Persian Government on current account, as it was his intention not to borrow any more from the Russian Bank, whose desire it is to tie up the hands of the Persian Government more than ever by prolonging the ten-years period mentioned in the Russian Loan Contracts of 1900 and 1902, during which the Persian Government is precluded from making any foreign loan. In carrying out the reform, he said, he depended on the assistance of His Majesty’s Government. I replied that no doubt his Highness’ friendship would be much appreciated by the British Government, who would doubtless do their utmost to meet his wishes and to assist him in his difficult task if he would only give a tangible proof of his friendship to His Majesty’s Representative here, in order that he may be in a position to convince His Majesty’s Government that his Highness’ friendship is not mere words. He asked in what way he could give this proof at the present moment. I replied by sending a satisfactory reply to the Minister’s notes about the “Customs of Pars and the Persian Gulf.” He promised to do his best to meet the Minister’s wishes if he would send him a reminder which could be shown to the Shah. I concluded from this conversation with the Grand Vizir that after the first or second Russian loan there had been some correspondence between the Persian Government and the Russian Legation as to the exclusion of Mohammerah from the guarantee of the Russian loan, hut the Mushir-ed-Dowleh cannot find the correspondence in the archives of the Foreign Office, and that the Persian Government is again approaching the Russian Legation on the subject. Referring to the fine exacted from the Salar Afghan, his Highness said that he did not consider it advisable to tell the Minister at the time the nature of the great offence, or rather treason, committed by him (the Salar), but he would now tell me, confidentially, and for my private information. The Salar and the Naser-es-Saltaneh—“ these two blackguards,”—he said, had sold to the Russian Road Company, without the permission of the Persian Government, the Concession which they had for the road between Piri Bazar and Kazian at Resht, and now that the Persian Government wishes to repudiate the transaction, the Mushir-ed-Dowleh advises the Shah not to do so, as it is inconsistent with the present policy of the Persian Government towards that of Russia. At the conclusion of the conversation the Grand Vizir asked me not to mention to any one, not even to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, what he told me about the money he intends to borrow from the Imperial Bank, but that I should ascertain from the Minister if it is possible, in reply to my inquiry as to the guarantee of the money, he said that could be arranged afterwards. S (Signed) ABBAS KULI. May 15, 1904. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. Sir A. Hardinge to Abbas Kuli Khan. Abbas Kuli Khan, May 17, 1904. YOU will thank the Vazir-i-Azam for his friendly and confidential communication about the financial situation, adding the following remarks from me:— 1 cannot but feel some disappointment that there should be a question of further borrowings. His Highness led me to hope, on my return from the South, that the deficit had been settled, and that there was no likelihood of any further pledging of public revenues to any foreign banks or Governments. The more the Persian Government can keep free of these foreign loans, which were the great curse of the late Grand Vizir’s administration, the better, as a creditor is always bound to exact some quid pro quo from his debtor. 1 explained to his Highness soon after he took office the conditions under which we should, as a Government, be prepared to afford further assistance to the Imperial Bank for the purposes of a Persian loan or advance to the Persian Government. I told him that we had advanced through the nominal agency of the Bank 200,000/. out of Indian revenues to the Atabeg, with the telegraph and Customs of “Bars and the Gulf” as ulterior guarantees, and that we would be prepared to add another 100,000/. to this advance, but that as the Caspian Fisheries and Telegraphs were exhausted, the furtheradvance would have to be secured on the Gulf Customs as sole guarantee, rurther, that we were ready to provide more money, but that in this case we should require some definite pledges of a political nature to protect our interests in Southern Persia against further encroachments by Russia. It is unfortunate that the Persian Government has till now refused to assure us that the term “ Pars and the Persian Gulf’’ in the Loan Contracts with Russia and ourselves, was intended by them to cover all the Southern Customs, or that they adhere to their arrangement of 1897. I should personally be glad to get the point settled before asking His Majesty’s Goverment to allow me to complete the advance of last year, as it will certainly be raised in connection with it. I believe Mr. Rabino has received a pretty free band from his Directors to make, notwithstanding the limitations of his Concession, considerable advances in the form of discounts to the Government, and that a good deal may be done in this way. It would be better that it should be so done, at least at first, than that I should be asked to make any suggestion to His Majesty’s Government while the interpretation of the earlier pledge given to us in 1897 is still doubtful and under discussion. I would suggest that his Highness should authorize me to discuss the w hole question confidentially, with M. Naus, who thoroughly understands our position and views respecting it. (Signed) ARTHUR H.

The loan contract pledged to the Russian Bank the revenues of “ all the customs of Persia, except those of Pars and the Persian Gulf.” Sir Mortimer Durand’s note says nothing about “the Persian Gulf,” hut speaks of the “ ports of the north,” and “ of the ports of Pars.” If the Persian Government had literally reproduced the expressions employed by Sir Mortimer Durand, it would have assigned “ the ports of the north ” as security for the Russian loan, and would have referred to the “ ports of Pars ” as excluded, though such exclusion would not have been necessary, since the term “ ports of the north ” would by itself have sufficiently indicated it. Sir M. Durand’s note had, moreover, no reference to an exclusive Russian loan such as that contracted by the Agreement of 1900. It referred to earlier negotiations for a mixed English—Prench—Russian loan, and Sir Mortimer Durand merely repeated a previous declaration by Lord Salisbury, that whilst we should not object to partial foreign control, in the event of such a loan, in “ the ports of the north ” we could not agree to it in “ the ports of Pars,” on account of the proximity to India. No question was asked of His Majesty’s Minister as to the exclusion desired in the event of a purely Russian loan, and indeed it was the secret conclusion of such a loan, without any previous communication of its conditions to His Majesty’s Government, which first occasioned a shock to our confidence in the friendship of the Persian Government, the effects of which are still unfortunately, though I hope decreasingly, felt, and which I am now anxious entirely to remove by a frank understanding on this question. If, however, the Persian Government attaches any special importance to Sir Mortimer Durand’s note of the 19th January, 1900, a declaration by your Highness that the Persian Government used the term “ customs of Pars and the Persian Gulf” in the sense in which Sir M. Durand clearly employed the term “ ports of Pars ”—that is, as the customs of the ports other than those “ of the north ”—would probably serve as a basis for such an understanding. It is clear that whether Mohammerah is, strictly speaking, a port of “ Pars and the Persian Gulf” or not, it is not one of the “ports of the north” in which Sir M. Durand declared in his note of the 19th January, 1900, that the partial foreign control contemplated would not be objected to by His Majesty’s Government. I may mention in connection with this question that the Persian Government, in notifying its adhesion to the Postal Union, sent to the International Bureau at Berne a table of the Persian post offices. In this table, a copy of which was sent to the Government of India in September 1903, it described as its post offices on the Persian Gulf the ports of Mohammerah, Bushire, Lingah, Bunder Abbas, Jask, Charbar, and Gwettur. A definition of the customs stations of the Persian Gulf, analogous to that of the post offices comprised under this term, might, I venture to suggest, afford another basis for reconciling the engagements entered into with the Russian Bank with the earlier promise made to the British Government. But whatever answer the Persian Government may elect to give, I must insist on its being clear and unequivocal. If it is really intended on the strength of a verbal quibble, which seems to be hardly worthy of serious discussion between the Governments of two great States, to repudiate the assurance given us in 1897, let the Persian Government tell us so plainly, and accept the full consequences in its future dealings with us, of what we can only regard as the violation both of the letter and of the spirit of a formal pledge given to a friendly Power. Ever since the publication of the loan contract of 1900 His Majesty’s Government has pressed for a precise explanation of the terms “ customs of Ears and the Persian Gulf.” It has acquiesced now for nearly four years with the utmost patience and forbearance in a succession of evasive replies to repeated representations and inquiries, and has on several occasions when its action or inaction might easily have occasioned serious trouble in the Province of Arabistan, always exerted its influence, in accordance with the traditions of its policy for the past 100 years, in a sense favourable to the views and interests of the Persian Government. But the moment3 16 good towards totract of the \ orrect. &gt;ms of £ says of tie ssions ortli” s as has now come when it must ask once for all for a straightforward statement as to the meaning attached by that Government, both to the terms employed by it in its loan agreement with the Russian Bank resnectin^ fho nnstnms nf 'RWc onri rersian i^un, ana to its earner assurances, given to my predecessor, respecting the customs of southern Persia.

Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—-(Received June 13.) (No. 85. Very Confidential.) My Lord, ' Tehran, May 19, 1904. I HAVE the honour to report that the Prime Minister has sounded me, for the first time since his assumption of office, on the subject of financial assistance. I inclose a Memorandum of a conversation which he had on the 15th instant wit .i Abbas Kuli Khan, whom I had sent to him with some unimportant message, lour Lordship will observe the note of mistrust for the Mushir-ed-Dowleh which pervades his Highness’ remarks. With respect to the “ treason ” of the Beglarbegi and Nasr-es- Saltaneh in selling the Kazian Road to the Russians, a transaction which I had the honour to report in my despatch No. 25 of the 5th February last, I suspect that the Ain-ed-Dowleh wished to justify an act of extortion in our eyes by representing its victim as a Russian agent, ‘but that rapacity rather than patriotism was its real motive, though the latter may have afforded a convenient pretext. I cave Abbas Kuli Khan the reply of which I have the honour to inclose a copy for verbal delivery to the Prime Minister, and his Highness reverted to the subject at an interview which I had with him yesterday. He said that he was not m an\ pressing want of money; that he had always been opposed to his predecessor s system of meeting any temporary deficit by foreign loans, which he agreed with mem recarding as disastrous ; that he had kept clear of them during the eight months that he°had been in office, and hoped to continue to do so. But he wanted to know it lie could count on us should any sudden emergency oblige him to raise a fairly large sum of money, say 800,000 tomans (160,000/.) or to provide a reserve fund at short n ot lce I reminded him of our conversation on his accession to office in which I had fully explained to him the policy of His Majesty’s Government to this country As I had then told him, we were ready to complete the advance of the 4th April, 1903, on the security which I had already indicated to him, without any political conditions. Such conditions would, however, have to be discussed if any further financial assistance was demanded of us. In the meantime he could, I thought, from private inquiries which I had made, easily obtain another 50,000/. (200,000 tomans) on account current from the Imperial Bank of Persia. The completion of the advance of April of last year would give him another 500,000 tomans, i.e., a total of /00,000 tomans (or at the present*rate of exchange rather more) which was only 20,000/. less than the amount which he had named to me. • i The Ain-ed-Dowleh said that he sincerely trusted that he might avoid any tiesh borrowings; that there was no need for me to report to your Lordship at the present juncture that he wanted money; and that if he should eventually do so he wou t send M. Naus to see me about it. The Customs were doing very well though their receipts had been to some slight extent diminished by the cholera outbreak in I was a good deal surprised at the hints dropped by his Highness that hemignt need assistance ifom us, as, so far as I was able to learn, the finances of the Persian Government are in a fairly satisfactory condition. _ I calculate that the Am-ed-Dowleh has wrung nearly 100,000/. from the provincial Governors and hls Ministerial colleagues in connection with the present Budget of which between 10,000/. and 15,000/. has gone into his Highness’ own pocket. 1 hus, to take onlj well authenticated payments, I know for a fact that the Minister of Telegraphs has had to pay 14,300/. for the retention of his post during the present year instead of the 6,000/. which he used to give in the time of the Atabeg, and which enabled him to make a very hand some profit out of his office. 46,000/. has been paid for his appointment by the Ivaser- es-Saltaneh, who has been made Minister of Crown Domains, and 18,000/. exclusive of a personal p.esent of 5,000/. to the Prime Minister, by the new Governor-General of JKLh o ixX s s 3 .11 The Chief Munager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, with whom AT. Naus is transacting the Government business in connection with the new financial arrange ments, has, moreover, obtained from his Directors a large discretion in the matter [2025 rc—14]of advances to the Persian Government even beyond the limits of the Concession, in the form of discounts on payments due to it, and he tells me that he could easily, at a moment’s notice, provide 50,000/. if the Ain-ed-Dowleh asked him for it, and probably also arrange for a much larger sum, provided that some such guarantee, or quasi-guarantee, as I mentioned in my despatch No. 53, Confidential, of the 24th March, was given to the Board by your Lordship. He added, however, that although M. Naus was aware that he couid draw upon him without difficulty, no application had for some time past been made to him, and that his Excellency had given him to understand that the Persian Government were not now in need of money. Abbas Kuli Khan suggested to me that the only explanation of the Ain-ed- Lowleh’s language was that the Shah, whose health, as your Lordship knows, is bad, and who is fretting for change and new amusements, has been pressing for money for another European tour, and he has reason to believe that the courtiers have been telling His Majesty that Paris is much gayer and more lively in late autumn and winter than in summer. This conjecture proves correct, for by a curious coincidence a member of the Persian Government has just informed Mr. Preece that the Shah, who is becoming increasingly feeble, has told the Ain-ed-Dowleh that he left the whole management of public affairs in his hands, and that he might do what he thought advisable, but that the one thing on which His Majesty insisted was that a fund of some 600,000 or 800,000 tomans, about 140,000/., very much the amount mentioned to me by the Prime Minister, should be set apart to enable him to pay a visit this autumn or next spring to Europe. I have no doubt that the Ain-ed-Dowleh will do all he can to delay the gratification of the Shah’s wishes as long as he can, consistently with his own personal safety, but that what he wants is to feel sure that if the worst comes to the worst, lie can obtain the money without having to apply to the Eussians. That the latter would refuse it, owing to their Ear Eastern embarrass ments is, I think unlikely, in view of the fact that they thuught it worth while only a few weeks ago to lend, as reported in my despatch No. 4^ of the 16th March last, 130.000/ to the Valiahd on inadequate security. At any rate, it would not be prudent to take it for granted. It must be borne in mind that it is always open to them to apply for such a purpose the annual interest received by the Bank on the two loans of 1900 and 1902, which would easily cover such a sum as the Shah has asked for. But they would doubtless require a political equivalent, and it would appear that the one at which they have actually hinted is an extension of the term during which Persia is forbidden to raise a loan without their consent. A mere extension of this term, objectionable as it would be from our point of view, would not, however, do them very much good, unless it was accompanied by a prohibition of more than carefully limited borrowings from the Imperial Bank, such as they have already more than once suggested; but I feel sure the Ain-ed-Dowleh, and even the Atabeg, would be too shrewd to venture into that net. It may be doubted whether a European tour before next spring, supposing the Shah lives till then, would prove of any real advantage to His Majesty’s health, as now that the hot weather has commenced, he could not even travel till it was over, and he could hardly go to German waters in the winter. He seems to be no better, and while I have not heard of late that the nephritic symptoms are more alarming, he is increasingly subject to fits of dizziness and giddiness which reduce him, while they last, to a condition of collapse. The Zil-es-Sultan, who took leave of him a few days ago, found him in bed, and gave me a very bad account of his condition. His Majesty starts in ten days’ time for the country, travelling very slowly, and resting for a few days at three Palaces on the way to his chief seat in Shimran. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) AETHUE H. HABDINGE, Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum. I HAD an interview yesterday evening with the Grand Vizir. His Highness, in the course of conversation, referred to the pecuniary difficulties experienced by the Persian Government in carrying out the reforms, and the unacceptable conditions proposed by theRussian Bank whenever asked for an advance on account current, while the Imperial Bank, to his Highness’ satisfaction, was always prepared to meet the wishes of the Persian Government as much as possible. His Highness then asked me confidentially whether the Imperial Bank was in a position to advance a sum of 1,000,000 tomans A (about 200,100/.) to the Persian Government on current account, as it was his intention not to borrow any more from the llussian Bank, whose desire it is to tie up the hands of the Persian Government mote than ever by prolonging the ten-years period mentioned in the Russian Loan Contracts of 1900 and 1902, during which the Persian Government is precluded from making any foreign loan. In carrying out the reform he said he depended on the assistance of His Majesty’s Government. I replied that ’no doubt his Highness 5 friendship would be much appreciated by the British Government, who would doubtless do their utmost to meet his wishes and to assist him in his difficult task if he would only give a tangible proof of his friendship to His Majesty’s Representative here, m order that he may be in a position to convince His Majesty’s Government that his Highness’ friendship is not mere words. He asked in what way he could give this proof at the present moment. I replied by sending a satisfactory reply to ^the Minister’s notes about the “Customs of Pars and the Persian Gulf.” He promised to do his best to meet the Minister’s wishes if he would send him a reminder which could be shown to the Shah. I concluded from this conversation with the Grand Vizir that after the first or second Russian loan there had been some correspondence between the Persian Government and the Russian Legation as to the exclusion of Mohammerah from the guarantee of the Russian loan, but the Mushir-ed-Dowleh cannot find the correspondence in the archives of the Foreign Office, and that the Persian Government is again approaching the Russian Legation on the subject. ' Referring to the fine exacted from the Salar Afghan, his Highness said that he did not consider it advisable to tell the Minister at the time the nature of the great offence, or rather treason, committed by him (the Salar), but he would now tell me, confidentially’ and for my private information. The Salar and the Naser-es-Saltaneh—“ these two blackguaids, he said, nad sold to the Russian Road Company, without the permission of the Persian Government, the Concession which they had for the road between Piri Bazar and Kazian at Resht, and now that the Persian Government wishes to repudiate the transaction, the Mushir-ed-Dowleh advises the Shah not to do so, as it is inconsistent with the present policy of the Persian Government towards that of Russia. At the conclusion of the conversation the Grand Vizir asked me not to mention to any one, not even to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, what he told me about the money he intends to borrow from the Imperial Bank, but that I should ascertain from the Minister if it is possible. In reply to my inquiry as to the guarantee of the money, he said that could be arranged afterwards. 1 (Signed) ABBAS KULI. May 15, 1904. Inclosure 2 in ]S T o. 1. Sir A. Hardinge to Abbas Kali Khan. Abbas Kuli Khan, May 17, 1904. YOU will thank the Vazir-i-Azam for his friendly and confidential communication about the financial situation, adding the following remarks from me :— I cannot but feel some disappointment that there should be a question of further borrowings. His High ness led me to hope, on my return from the South, that the deficit had been settled, and that there was no likelihood of any further pledging of public revenues to any foreign banks or Governments. The more the Persian Government can keep free of these foreign loans, which were the great curse of the late Grand Vizir’s administration, the better, as a creditor is always bound to exact some quid pro quo from his debtor. I explained to his Highness soon after he took office the conditions under which we should, as a Government, be prepared to afford further assistance to the Imperial i Bank for the purposes of a Persian loan or advance to the Persian Government. I told | him that we had advanced through the nominal agency of the Bank 200,000/. out of Indian revenues to the Atabeg, with the telegraph and Customs of “Pars and the Gulf” t as ulterior guarantees, and that we would be prepared to add another 100,000/. to this I advance, but that as the Caspian Fisheries and Telegraphs were exhausted, the further4 advance would have to be secured on the Gulf Customs as sole guarantee. Further, that we were ready to provide more money, but that in this case we should require some definite pledges of a political nature to protect our interests in Southern Persia against further encroachments by Russia. , ,, , , o ... It is unfortunate that the Persian Government has till now refused to assure us that the term “ Pars and the Persian Gulf” in the Loan Contracts with Russia and ourselves, was intended by them to cover all the Southern Customs, or that they adhere to their ; arrangement of 1897. 1 should personally be glad to get the point settled before asking His Majesty’s Goverment to allow me to complete the advance of !aSo year, as it ! will certainly be raised in connection with it. . . , I believe Mr. Rabino has received a pretty free band from his Directors to make, notwithstanding the limitations of his Concession, considerable advances in the lorm ot discounts to the Government, and that a good deal may be done in this way. It 'Quid be better that it should be so done, at least at first, than that I should be asKea to ma e any suggestion to His Majesty’s Government while the interpretation of the earlier pledge efiven to us in 1897 is still doubtful and under discussion. 1 would suggest that his Highness should authorize me to discuss the whole question identiallv, with M.

I have at last received reply from the Persian Government. It says that its intention, in using the words “Ears and the Persian Gulf,” was to exclude from the contracts all the ports of the south, and that it thought that this inten tion of their Representative was adequately expressed, since, in his last note on the subject, Sir M. Durand had used term, “ports of Ears.” It cannot, however, now alter any of expressions in loan contracts, or interpret them, without participation of Russian Bank, and if, contrary to all expectation, discussion should arise in connection with this question respecting Mohammerah, they would have to refer to an Arbitrator, whose decisions cannot now be foretold. Note is so far a gain to our view that it for the first time formally admits that the Persians intended by “Ears and the Persian Gulf” to express all the ports of the south, and we can either continue the controversy from this vantage ground or take act of declaration emphasizing its force in our reply, and add, as suggested in your telegram No. 14 of 17th February, that we shall take measures to clinch Persian Government’s own anterior obligations to ourselves to insu 1 ‘ '* 1 * * j 11 ‘ 'Mention less than three weeks, before instructing me as to reply.

My _ Tehran, April 25, 1904. 1 HA V-b the honour to report, with reference to my despatch No. 61 of the 30th ultimo, that the Mushir-ed-I)owleh has persuaded the Prime Minister to substitute for M. Nauss draft note inclosed in that despatch respecting “Pars and the Persian Gulf” a vague reply evading any answer to my inquiries, and simply stating that the expressions employed in the Loan Contract of 1900 were those suggested by Sir Mortimer Durand. I told the Ain-ed-Dowleh, in the course of a visit which I paid to] him to-day, that it would be useless for me to send this note, which was no answer to mine, to your Lordship, and that 1 must insist on a clear definition of the view taken of its own obliga tions by the Persian Government. His Highness tried to parry my demands by the old plea that these obligations had been incurred by his predecessor, that he knew nothing about the question, and must necessarily be guided by the oninion of the Foreign Minister. I said I must press for an answer yes or no, as to whether or not the Customs of Mohammerah and Beluchistan had been pledged to Russia, that if the answer was in the affirmative we should then know how to act in presence of what we should regard as a breach of faith by the Persian Government, that, as he was aware, we had, when the Arabs first resisted the introduction of the Belgian Customs, used our influence to promote a working arrangement between Sheikh Khazal and the Court of Tehran, but that if we were to understand that our friendly attitude in this matter was not recipro cated here, we should probably have to reconsider the policy which we had hitherto pursued at Mohammerah and in Arabistan generally. 1 held similar language to M. Raus, who deplored the foolish obstinacy of the Persian Ministers, and promised to return to the charge with Ain-ed-Dowleh, and to do his best to obtain for us a satisfactory reply. In reply to a question as to the progress of his negotiations with the Russians respecting the “ Reglement Douanier,” M. Naus said that he could get no satisfaction from the Russian Government, and was therefore drawing up an appeal to the Hague Tribunal to decide this question as between Persia and Russia, coupled with a claim for compensation for the loss of storage and other fees occasioned by the obstinate and unreasonable delay of the Russian Legation in assenting to the new Customs Regu lations. 1 do not despair, with the assistance of M. Naus, of extracting the formal admission desired by His Majesty’s Government from that of Persia, but a good deal of pressure will, I think, still be necessary, as the Persian Ministers evidently think that they have a strong technical case for continuing to avoid committing themselves to us.

(No. 58. Confidential.) -\iy Lord, ^ Tehran, March 2b, IW4*. I LEAEN from the Chief Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia that M. Nans has hinted to him that he may have to apply, not immediately, hut perhaps within the next few months, for a further advance on account current of from •10,000/. to 60,000/., and that he would prefer to have recourse to the Imperial Bank of Persia than to the Banque d’Escompte, as his relations with the Russian Legation have for various reasons, none of them of any real importance, undergone of late a (J^iight temporary strain. Mr. Rabino did not think that the Russian Bank would, as I suggested might be the case, be unable or unwilling under existing circumstances to make further advances to the Persian Government, and the fact that it has just accommodated the Yaliahd with from 80,000/. to 100,000/., on somewhat inadequate security, certainly indicates that it has not abandoned, owing to the Japanese war, its system of pushing Russian interests in Persia by means of political loans. It can still afford to make these on a moderate scale out of the interest on its more extensive operations, though no doubt a fresh large Persian loan would not at the present juncture be easily sanctioned by the Russian Ministry of Pinance. Por this reason, and also because he regards the suggested advance as a good investment, in view of the steady increase in the customs revenue, especially in the south, Mr. Rabino would be glad to oblige M. Naus with it, but unfortunately he is confronted by the restric tion in the Imperial Bank's Concession, as the Bank have already made advances to the Persian Government up to the limit permitted by that instrument. He asked me whether I thought your Lordship would be able to help in the matter if you were approached by the directors, he did not, of course, mean in the sense of providing funds, but of giving some assurance, not necessarily amounting to a formal guarantee, which would enable them to make the advance without incurring responsibility to their shareholders for a provisional departure from the strict letter of the Concession, suppose the Persian Government were on their side willing to relieve them from the limitations imposed upon them by it. I reminded Mr. Rabino that in the autumn of 1901, when I was endeavouring to obtain for the Atabeg-i-Azam an advance of 200,000/. to 300,000/. from the Imperial Bank of Persia, in order to block the second Russian Loan, or at least secure a share in it, your Lordship had expressed your willingness (as stated in your telegram No. 28 of the 3rd August, 1901) to take note of the transaction, and I asked if he thought that some such statement by you would overcome the difficulty in the way of the contemplated advance. He said he was not in a position to give me a definite opinion on this point, but that what he would wish was that the best way of getting round the obstacle should, if possible, be confidentially discussed between representatives of the Bank and Poreign Office, as he could not but think that some solution could in this event be attained. I told him that I would repeat what he had said to your Lordship without putting forward any suggestion of my own for such action as you may be able to take on it, should you be approached by the directors of the Bank. In the meanwhile 1 should prefer that nothing should be said to the latter of Mr. Rabino’s conversation with me, as I uo not know to what extent they share his views, or how far, as they are rather sensitive on the subject of his relations with the Legation, they might altogether approve his having sounded me on a matter of this nature without positive instructions from themselves. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR H.

Confidential.) ,0,^ - ’ Sir A. Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—(Received April 18.) My Lord, Tehran, March 30, 1904. I CALLED on the Prime Minister on the 2nd instant to explain to him the views entertained by His Majesty’s Government on the meaning to be attached, in view of the Persian Government’s engagement of 1897, to the term ‘‘Ears and the Persian Gulf,” employed in the Russian Loan Agreements of 1900 and 1902. The Ain-ed-Dowleh, who was in bed with a sharp attack of gout, said the question was new to him, and appeared to know nothing about the negotiations for the conclusion of the “ Reglement Douanier,” in connection with which it was being raised, but he observed that there was plainly a considerable difference between “ Ears* and the Persian Gulf Ports” and “ Southern Persia.” As, however, his Highness was obviously far from well, I said that I would not now trouble him with the lengthy explanations which were necessary in order to make the subject clear to him, but would embody them in a Memo randum which I would send him within the next few days. 1 then went on to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh and informed him of the communication which your Lordship had directed me to make. He said that the expression ee Ports of Ears and of the Persian Gulf” had been suggested to the Persian Government by Sir Mortimer Durand, who had used it in an official note, as a reference to our archives would doubtless show, and which, as posterior to the correspondence of 1897, must be regarded as interpreting that correspondence, and, if necessary, as superseding any inconsistent terms employed in it. I at first supposed his Excellency to allude to a note by my predecessor dated the 8th April, 1899, copy of which 1 have the honour to inclose, but at a sub sequent interview he informed me that I was mistaken, and that he was referring to a later correspondence which took place just before the conclusion of the Russian Loan of 1900. We have no English copy in our archives of the note of the 19th January, 1900, from Sir Mortimer Durand, with which this correspondence closes, but only of the Persian translation of it sent in to the Atabeg-i-Azam. It does not, in fact, appear to have been sent home, and I had never seen it before. I pointed out, however, to the Mushir-ed- Dowieh that this note, a translation of which from the Persian I have the honour to transmit herewith, far from weakening our case, rather strengthened it by showing that the term “ Ports of Ears,” which Sir Mortimer Durand had employed, was used in con tradistinction to the term Ports of the North.”m I accordingly supplemented the Memorandum for the Ain-ed-Dowleh, a copy of which I have the honour to transmit herewith, by a note of which copy is also inclosed, drawing special attention to this point, so as to forestall the objections with which the Mushir- el-Dowleh would, I felt sure, try to meet my arguments, when the matter was discussed between them. A feu r days latter I informed M. Naus, who would, I also foresaw, be consulted on •^he subject by the Persian Ministers, of the attitude taken up by us respecting it. He observed that the Loan Contract of 1900 had been badly drawn up, and that his opinion on it had only been asked after its signature, when the criticisms which he had offered on it were too late to be of any practical use, but he thought that, with regard to this particular clause, the Persian Government had been slovenly, rather than intentionally, forgetful of its engagements, and had employed in good faith an expression derived by it from the latest note sent by us on the subject. As to the classification attached to the “ Reglement Douanier,” it supported our contention rather than otherwise, since, even if it were argued that Mohammerah was not, strictly speaking, a Persian Gulf port, this could not be said of Hindian, Busi, and other places in the Arabistan Customs district, which were clearly “ ports of the Persian Gulf.’’ It could not, therefore, be maintained on any assumption that the “ district of the south” covered all the ports whose customs were not pledged to Russia. There is undoubted force in this argument, all the more so that the district of the south,” whilst excluding the Gulf ports of Arabistan, includes the Baluch ports from Jask to Gwetter, which the Russians might claim, as being ports on the Gulf of Oman to be outside the Persian Gulf, and therefore pledged to them. He would, however, he proceeded, propose to Ain-ed-Dowleh a declaration to the effect that the Persian Government, in employing the words “ customs of Pars and of the Persian Gulf,’’ had intended to adhere to the engagement of 1897, and exclude from the loan guarantee “ the customs of Southern Persia.” But he presumed that we should not call on them to make a similar explanation to Russia, which might be expected to take a different view of the meaning of this expression. “If,” he added, “ this question ever assumes a concrete form, and Russia claims the fulfilment of the Contract in its apparent literal sense, apart from any anterior understandings, the matter will doubtless be settled between London and St. Petersburgh without the Persian Government having much to say to it, and England will, I take it, be strong enough (“ 1’Angleterre est, je pense, assez grand gargon ” was M. Naus’ homely phrase) to vindicate the interpretation placed by Persia and herself on its relation to the engagement of 1897.” The question has, since the conversations described above, been discussed between the Ain-ed-Dowleh, the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, and M. Naus, and the latter has this morning called to show’ me confidentially the inclosed draft of a reply which he is preparing in accordance with the Ain-ed-Dowlelfs directions, as a result of their joint conference, but which he has not yet submitted to his Highness. He asked that the fact of his having communicated this draft to me might be kept secret, as I gather that, while the Prime Minister himself was neutral on the question, the Mushir-ed-Dowleh strongly objected, as was to be anticipated from his own language to myself to any formal readmission of the continued validity of the engagement of 1897. Both Ministers, however, seem to have suspected, like true Orientals, that our anxiety on the subject of Mohammerah must cover some ulterior unavowed design, and to have been slow to appreciate the point that it was actually to Persia’s advantage that the area of contingent Russian control should be as far as possible restricted. I told M. Naus that I should like to study his draft more carefully before expressing an opinion as to how far it would be acceptable to His Majesty’s Government, and he accordingly consented to delay for a day or so presenting it for the Ain-ed- Dowleh’s approval. As the messenger is just leaving, I have to write somewhat hurriedly, and would prefer, with your Lordship’s permission, to reserve for a further despatch or for a telegram the observations which its cursory perusal has suggested to me. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARDINGE. [1922 5—4] CInclosure 1 in Xo. 3. Memorandum communicated by Sir A. Hardinye to the Amin-ed-Dowleh. ON the 16th October, 1897, when negotiations between the Persian Government and certain foreign capitalists tor raising a loan on the security of the customs were under discussion, Mr. Hardinge, Her late Majesty’s Charge d’Atfaires, was instructed by th* Marquess of Salisbury to request an assurance from the Persian Government that under no circumstances would the customs of Southern Persia be mortgaged to a foreign Power. ° He did so in the following terms:— [Mr. C. Hardinge to Mushir-ed-Dowleh, inclosing Memorandum dated the I6th October, 1897.] The 'ate Mushir-ed-Dowleh replied to this note in a communication of which the following is the exact text:— [Mushir-ed-Dowleh to Mr. C. Hardinge, received the 23rd October, 1897.] In the course of the negotiations which led up to the conclusion of the Russian oan Agreement of 1900, repeated reference was made to this guarantee by my predecessor, an a co Py °f it was, as appears from our archives, formally communicated to the Atabeg-i- Azam on the 10th December, 1899, in reply to a request by his Highness. § onsfnmTe.

I accordingly addressed to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh the following note :— [Note dated the 24th May, 1903, to Mushir-ed-Dowleh.] His Excellency’s answer, dated the 17th June, 1903, was as follows :— [Note dated the 17th June, 1903, from Mushir-ed-Dowleh.] It will be seen that this reply does not really deal with the question raised by me. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh says that Mohammerah is a river port, and that it is therefore for geographers, and not for the Persian Government, to decide whether it is a port of the Persian Gulf. He passes over in silence the engagement of 1897, signed by his predecessor on behalf of the Persian Government, and the fact that whether Mohammerah be a river port or a sea port, it is in any case a post of “ Southern Persia,” and lays stress on the facts, which everybody knows already, and which was not under discussion, that Arabistan is separate, for the purpose of its provincial administration, from Fars, and that the customs of both provinces are under the control of the Central Government at Tehran. I saw, however, no advantage in continuing a discussion of these points, and sent the papers to my Government for further orders. As, however, I forwarded soon afterwards a draft of the Customs Regulations which, under the Commercial Convention ol the 9th February, 1903, were to form the subject of an Agreement between the Persian Ministry of Customs and His Majesty’s Legation, and to which a Table showing the districts into which Persia was divided for customs purposes was annexed, His Majesty’s Government decided to wait till the communication, made at the time, confidentially and unofficially, by the Ministry of Customs, should be made to it officially, before addressing any further representations to the Persian Government on the meaning, for customs purposes, of the expressrom “ Fars and the Persian Gulf.” The draft Customs Regulation has now been communicated to me officially, in a note from M. Naus, dated the 25th February, and Lord Lansdowne has accordingly directed me to demand further explanations as to the division of customs districts established by the Table annexed to it. There is no mention whatever in the Table of the customs of “Fars and the Persian Gulf” or of the customs of “ Southern Persia.^ The latter are grouped into three districts, called respectively “ Arabistan, “ I he South, and “ Baluchistan,” and before authorizing me to accept the Customs Regulations in the manner provided by the Convention of 1903, His Majesty s Government desire me to come to some cleaiMinderstanding with the Persian Government as to the exclusion of all these three districts, which, whether covered or not at the time by the term “ Fars and the Gulf of Fars,” are undoubtedly covered by the term “ Southern Persia 7 used in the Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s note of 1897, from the actual or potential operation ot the Russian Loan Agreements. In which way this can best be done, whether by a joint Declaration or by am exchange of notes, I do not here offer an opinion. The object of this Memorandum is rather to state, as clearly as possible, the historical aspect of the question than to discuss the best method of reconciling the expression “ Fars and the Persian Gulf employed in the Loan Contracts with the expression “ Southern Persia” employed in the exchange or notes of 1897, and which, being anterior to the Loan Agreements, cannot be modified by anything contained in them. It may be added that the geographical question as to Mohammerah has been referred by His Majesty’s Government, in accordance with the suggestion conveyed in the Mushir- ed-Dowleh’s note of the 17th June, 1903, to the highest official expert authority on such matters in England—the Hydrographer of His MajestrVA d nnra 1 fcuhu liu«-«rpurted that Mohammerah, being on a tidal river and accessible to ships navigating the Persian Gulf, is, from a geographical point of view, a port of that sea. The decision ot this detail is, however, only a part of a much wider question which concerns not so much technical points of geography as the diplomatic good faith of the Persian Government, and as that good faith is not likely, when appealed to, to be found wanting, it should be capable ot easv and rapid settlement.

Yo « r Highness, Tehran, March 19, 1904. bJJNCiii I sent in to your Highness my Memorandum of the 8th instant, respecting: the question of the exclusion of Mohammerah and other ports of Southern Persia from ilie guarantee for the Russian Loans of 1900 and 1902, the Mushir-ed-Dowleh has called my attention to a note bearing on the question by my predecessor, which had escaped mv notice, as no copy of it appears to have been sent to London for inclusion in the papers on the subject. 1 r As his Excellency may mention this communication to your Highness, I inclose a copy of it for reference herewith, together with the note from the Sadr-Azam, to which it answers, and the earlier note from Sir Mortimer Durand to which the latter alludes. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s argument was that inasmuch as it made specific reference to . , ports of Pars ” as those in which we could not consent to come into an arrangement '-wt.i rrance and Russia as partners, and that as Mohammerah is not a “ port ofEars’* the Persian Government was justified in concluding that, notwithstanding any previous declaration respecting “ Southern Persia,” we did not object to the placing of Moham merah, or of any southern port not actually comprised within the limits of “ Pars ” under contingent Russian supervision and control. An examination of the actual terms of the note shows that it strengthens the arguments advanced in my Memorandum, for it shows that the expression “ the ports of fars is used in contradistinction to the expression “ports of the north,” and therefore as an equivalent of the “ ports of the south,” all of which are situated on the Gulf of Ears, or on waters contiguous to it.

The paragraph in Lord Salisbury’s telegram which your Highness desires me to explain refers to the previous telegram dated the 23rd September, 1899, and in that first telegram his Lordship stated that we were ready to facilitate a loan with a lien on the customs of the ports of Fars, # Russia having a like lien on the po rts o f the north,t for a similar amcfhrrtTLulf'we cannot consent to come into an arrangement with RussTaaad nnd France as partners.

Lord Salisbury has now informed me by telegram that he has received similar messages from the Persian Minister in London. His Lordship goes on to say: “ I have replied to the following effect: We much regret that it is not in our power to aid Persia more effectively in the matter of the loan, for everything that concerns the prosperity of Persia is a matter of great interest to us. But we have also our own political interests to look to, and these interests are not compatible with the exercise of any control or jurisdiction by a European Power over the ports on the Persian Gulf. We renew to the Persian Government this intimation, which we have more than once given before, and we shall communicate the substance of it to any persons who may be disposed tot relv on a control over these ports as a financial security.” * “ Gumrukat-i-Benadir-i-Fars.” + “ Der Khelij-i-Fars.” t “ Benadir-i-Shemal.PERSIA AND ARABIA.

The telephone is already being worked, though, so far as appears, only for departmental purposes, on the telegraph line between Kerman and Yezd, and probably on other sections of the line as well. It seems improbable that competition will arise if we can claim the right of working long-distance telephony on our telegraph line, since little progress would be possible without a combination of local exchanges with long-distance telephony.

I TOLD the Persian Minister to-day that in consequence of questions which had been lately raised in the House of Commons respecting our commercial relations with Persia, and of observations received from various persons interested in the trade of the Persian Gulf as to the “ r^glement douanier ” published by the Persian Government last autumn, I had thought it necessary to instruct Sir Arthur Hardinge to renew his request to the Persian Government for a definite statement that the assurances given by them with regard to the customs of Fars and the Persian Gulf, include the port of Mohammorah. I pointed out that on a previous occasion, when this question was discussed, the Persian Foreign Minister had told Sir Arthur Hardinge that the question was really one of geographical definition. As to this I observed that there could to my mind be no question that in ordinary geographical language Mohammorah, which is on tidal water and is reached by sea-going vessels, should be classified as a Persian Gulf port.

Lord Lansdowne understands that when the Persian Government notified to the International Bureau at Berne their adherence to the Washington Parcel Post Con vention of the 15th June, 1897, in August 1903, they annexed a table of Persian post-offices in which Mohammerah was included, with Bushire, Lingah, Bunder Abbas, Jask, Chahbar, and Gwetter, under the heading £t Golfe Persique.” Prom this, it would appear, that the Persian Government have recognized the fact that Mohammerah is one of the ports of the Persian Gulf.

Naus has communicated to me confidentially Erench draft reply to my last note which he is preparing by direction of Persian Government. Its most important passages are as follows :— In signing this engagement (that respecting Ears and Gulf in Russian loan Agreements) Persian Government in no wise intended to disregard (“ meconnaitre ”) the determination expressed by it in 1897 that customs of Southern Persia would never he placed under foreign control as guarantee for a loan other than British. If in the Russian loan contracts it used the expression “ customs of Ears and Gulf,” it was because Sir M. Durand in his latest note on the subject of 19th January, 1900, employed the words ports of Ears ” to indicate exclusion desired by British Government. It must be concluded from context of Sir M. Durand’s note that the expression “ports of Ears” was used in opposition to expression “ports of the south,” and this was equally the intention of Persian Government in making the reservation excluding the customs of Ears and Persian Gulf. No explanations on this subject have, as yet, been exchanged between Persian Government and Russian Bank, so that this question might eventually give rise to objections of geographical nature by this latter which it would not depend on Persian Government to settle [“ trancher ”1 in one or other sense. If note is accepted by your Lordship, I propose insertion after word £ depend of word “ exclusively.” . Meaning of above, though expressed in guarded terms, is that Persian Government intended, as we did, under the words 44 Ears and Gulf ’ to exclude customs of Southern Persia, but cannot answer for view of expression which may be taken by Russia. M. Naus observed, in conversation, that if this question assumed practical forms,, it would be settled between us and Russia, without Persia having much say in it. All Persia could do was to state her own intention, which was to adhere to Declaration of !897. . , . , . Note should strengthen our position in matter, especially if in acknowledging it we emphasized its acceptance of our view, and add, with reference to last paragraph,, some such statement as that in event of anticipated objections by Russian Ban £ wt are prepared to vindicate our own anterior rights. I am not yet quite certain that draft will be sanctioned in its present torm by Persian Government, as Mushir-ed-Dowleh is opposed to our contention, and has icen obstructive with both Naus and myself; Naus will not submit it for a day or two so as to give me time to study it and see him again. 1 should add that it repudiates all connection between any of new customs. districts and customs mentioned in loan contracts. „ .

As the Reglement Douanier with the accompanying lists has now been under consideration for some months, and as it does not seem likely that a request for the balance, 100,000/., of the loan will now be forthcoming from Persia, we would suggest that this question might now be taken up by Bis Majesty's Minister at Tehran, independently of the question as to the interpretation to be put upon the general engagements undertaken by the Persian Government. If arrangements are being made for a fresh loan from Russia, as the Charge d'Affaires telegram of the 26/4 December would seem to imply, it is the more necessary to adopt this course. Our contention is as stated in my telegram of the 5/4 June, that the phrase is merely a loose equivalent for “ the customs of Southern Persia.'

THE telegram from the Government of India of the 9th instant, and your Lord ship’s telegranT^No. 46 of the 1 ith May, seem to make it desirable that I should explain more fully and clearly than I have yet done the exact financial situation in Persia, and the bearing upon it of the advance made last month by His Majesty’s Government, for the completion of which the Persian Government is now applying. The revenues of the Persian Government may be estimated at about 1,200,000/. a-year, but for practical purposes the only ones we need take into account are those under European administration, viz., the customs and posts. The Caspian Sea royalties represent 20,000/. a-year, but the permanence of this source of revenue is doubtful. The telegraphs represent at present, under Persian management, only about 5,000/. a-year. Of the “ maliat,” or land revenue, which may be estimated at about 700,000/. or 800,000/. a-year, but which under proper administration would bring in a great deal more, very little reaches the Imperial Treasury.* The annual revenue of the posts, under Belgian administration, may be estimated at 10,000/. i n jt 'xt The customs brought in last year a revenue of 420,000/., and M. Naus estimates that this year they will rise to 440,000/., and, when the new Tariff is in thorough working order, to 500,000/.

Engagements towards Russia. The Persian Government has bound itself towards Russia— • 17 *' r ° Sl l? the E 1 ussian Bank » in case of default, supervision, and if this is insuffi cient to secure the regular payment of the interest due on the loans, control over the 5TiS^a e n C Gulf.” ' th6 l0anS ’ aU th6 CuSt ° m3 ° f PerSia ^ l1 ''- Ioaa of 1901 till 1910, and not to redeem the Loan of iyU3 till 1912, giving six months’ notice in each case. lomrl Pi th f loanS are re , l ” lid or redeemed, to “ isme no foreign loan ” (Contract of 0 ), and to contract no foreign loan for a long term ” (Contract of 1903), without the consent of the Russian Government. The Russians interpret this as meanino- that although Persia is free to accept advances from the Imperial Bank of Persia, which is in a sense her btate Bank, and with which her Government has an “ account current ” or o discount royalties, such as those due on the Caspian Fisheries Concession, the D’Arcy letroleum Concession and telegraph lines worked by the Indo-European Telegraph epartment and the Indo-European Telegraph Company, she cannot stipulate, or accept a stipulation, that the advances made to her shall only be redeemable “ a longue echeance ^ The expression “ longue echeance ” has not been precisely defined, but I suppose it might be reasonably contended that a term of twenty years, perhaps even of ten would constitute ‘ e longue eclnhmce,” but that one of five would be “courte ec eance. The difficulty could probably be turned, supposing that we wished to lend Persia a given sum for twenty years, by providing that our advance could be redeemed m, say, five years, but that if it was redeemed before ten the interest would be doubled, or substantially increased. In the case of the recent advance this was not necessary, as he nominal security was a fixed sum, payable annually for a term of twenty years. '+v&gt; ^ ^ Persia has further undertaken, till the loan is repaid, not to lower her duties without the consent of Russia, and this engagement has now been made independent of the repayment of the loan by its incorporation in a secret Article attached to the new Russo-Persian Commercial Treaty. A4 L I -i 1 2. Engagements to Great Britain. In 1807, under instructions from Lord Salisbury, Mr. Hardinge, the Charg6 d’Affaires here, in connection with certain rumours as to a contemplated Persian Loan, requested, in a note to which a Memorandum was annexed, an assurance from the Persian Government that under no circumstances whatever would the control of the customs of Southern Persia be ceded to a foreign Power. The Memorandum annexed to this'note pointed out that it would be a grave error of policy to pledge to foreign financiers the customs revenues of the Southern Persian ports. It added that Great Britain would protest against the alienation to a foreign Power of the Shah’s control over the customs of his “ southern ports,” an expression which was altered in the Persian text of the Memorandum to “control over the revenues of the customs of Southern PersiaA’ The then Mushir-ed-Dowleh, on the 23rd October, 1897, replied to this note in a communication of which the English translation in our archives runs as follows :— “ You have written that there was a rumour that the customs of Southern Persia would be placed under foreign supervision and control as guarantee for a loan. I there fore take this occasion of informing the Legation that this rumour is absolutely without foundation, and that they will never be placed under foreign supervision and control.” The actual Persian text, which of course is the only one which the Persian Govern ment would regard as binding on itself, is a little less lacking in precision : translated literally it runs :— &lt;k This that you had written it has been rumoured that ‘ some ’ (or ‘ certain ’) South Persian customs are being placed under foreign supervision and control against the amount of a foreign loan, has been brought to notice, and it has been deemed necessary to bring to the notice of the respected Legation that the rumour is completely without foundation and under foreign supervision and control ” (they—this pronoun is under stood, but docs not actually figure in the text) “never will be placed.” Not long afterwards, in his despatch No. 149, of 4th November, 1897, Mr. Hardinge reported that the Persian Ministers were negotiating a Dutch loan on the security of the southern customs, and intended to reconcile their action with the above assurance by a declaration that as their payments would never be in arrears, the control and super vision which they had promised us not to part with would never become effective ; in other words, that they were free to pledge the southern customs, so long as they did not actually cede them. 1 have little doubt that they would revive this contention to-day I if we argued that they had broken the engagement of 1897 by pledging the Customs of, say, Kerman and Mohammerah (supposing the latter port to be excluded from the term “Ears and the Persian Gulf”), and further, that they would lay great stress upon the fact that the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, in his note of 2-3rd October, bad only given an under taking in respect of “ certain of the South Persian customs,” and not in respect of them all. It appeals to me, therefore, that before committing ourselves to a formal declaration, or at any rate entering into a discussion of details with respect to this engagement, we should first decide (1) whether it is undoubtedly violated in the letter, as I think it is in the spirit, by the Russian loan contracts of 1900 and 1902; and (2) in what precise sense we understand the terms “Southern Persia” and “ Ears and the Ports of the Persian Gulf” respectively, since they are susceptible o r different interpretations. What do we mean exactly by “ Southern Persia ” ? Is the expression to be under stood in contradistinction to “ Northern Persia ” ? In which case it would include the southern half of the Shah’s dominions, i.e., the whole country south of, say, the 32nd parallel of latitude, and take in not merely Arabistan, but Kerman and Seistan. Or is / it “Southern” as distinguished from “Central” as well as “Northern” Persia? In which case the northern limit would be drawn a good deal further south, and take in the eastern frontier and the ports of Persian Baluchistan, but hardly Seistan or the Upper Karun, i.e., Ahwaz and Shuster. It is evident to me that in 1901 your Lordship had yourself not come to any definite decision on this question, for in your telegram , No. 38 of that year, you pointed out to me as a reason tor collecting the customs of Arabistan at Mohammerah and not at Ahwaz. that those of the latter place might be 1 held to be pledged to the service of the Russian loan. W hat, again, is your Lordship’s view of the meaning of the termports constituting the “ Banadir District” administered by the Governor of Bushire which extends from Bunder Rig on the west to a point just west of Jask on the east but Bakchistm! “d f m T r u\ ' Arabi8t . an &gt; or Jask &gt; Gharbar, or Gwetter in Persian Baluchistan Or it may be held to comprise all the Customs division administered by !Dlrect oa Generale” of the Persian Gulf at Bushire, which at present excludes wm M^nnWl 1 ’ n 11 vi tak fv m p° rt ? o f Persian Baluchistan. A still wider definition lould include besides the stations within the limits of this division, Mohammerah (with 'norf &lt; S e fl deI D leS - Shust ? r n- and Abwaz ) ' vhich &gt; '■ ,lilst ,10t for administrative purposes a part of the Provinces of Pars or Benddir (Bushire) or for Customs purposes under the Director-General of Bushire, is nevertheless a “port of the Persian Gulf” though the Kussians, I believe, argue that Mohammerah, being 60 miles up the Shat-el-Arabris not a Gulf port in the strict sense of the term. When the first Russian loan was negotiated in 1900, the Persians intimated, I believe, to Russia that they had promised us not to place their southern customs under foreign control, and as Russian control was a contingent condition of the loan their exclusion had to be provided for. The term “Customs of Pars and of the Ports of tbe i ersian Gulf was accordingly adopted in the contract, and the Persian negotiators, 7. ^ a !^, ne&gt;e £ Precise, were satisfied with it, as expressing all the custom-houses con trolled from Bushire, with which those of Jask, Chabar, and Gwetter, were in process of amalgamation Mojiammerah, and its dependent customs, Ahwaz and Shuster, were at that time outside this division, their administration being still in the hands of Sheikh Ixhazal, and they were only united to it in the autumn of last year, to be again separated from it (no doubt at Russian instigation) a few months ago, and constituted as a separate division under the title of “Direction Generale de PArabistan.” It must be noted in this connection, and whether we like it or not, it is undoubtedly a our case &gt; the time when the Russian loan contract w r as first published, on the 30th January, 1900, with the clause excluding only the customs of Pars and the Persian Gulf, His Majesty’s Government made no formal reservation or protest with regard to this particular point, either to Russia or Persia, on the strength of the engagement of 1897. They had official knowledge from the communique in the St. Petersburg!! “ Pravitelstvenny Yiestnik,” which reproduced the substance, but not the actual articles, of the Agreement, that all the customs of Persia, except those of “Pars and the Gulf,” were pledged to and were liable to contingent control by Russia, but they did not even demand to be furnished with a text of the loan Agreement, in order to ascertain how far it affected the engagement of 1897. Sir Charles Scott, indeed, spontaneously reminded M. de Witte of that engagment verbally, in the course of conversation, but without calling attention to the distinction between “ Southern Persia and “Pars and the Persian Gulf.” Two months later, in connection with the proposal to place Mohammerah under the Belgian Customs, Lord Salisbury telegraphed to Mr. Spring Rice to inform the Persian Government that no change in the administra tion of the customs there should be made without our consent, and to remind it of the engagement of 1897, ascertaining at the same time whether or not the Customs of Mohammerah were included in jhe guarantee of the Russian loan. The result of the discussions which followed this instruction, and which I need not recapitulate at length, was that the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs stated verbally that if Mohammerah was included (as he personally believed it to be) in the expression “ Pars and the Gulf of bars it was excluded from the Russian guarantee, and that if control ever became necessary the Persian Government would decide to what ports the control should apply. His Excellency, however, deprecated a written discussion, and asked that Mr. Spring Rice’s note inclosing Lord Salisbury’s telegram might be regarded as a verbal com munication only (Mr. Spring Rice’s telegram Ho. 50 of the 4th April). So matters remained, we claiming in the abstract that the term “ Pars and the ports of the Persian Gulf” must, in view of the engagement of 1897, include Mohammerah, but without saying how much more it included, and the Persian Govern ment evading an official expression of opinion on the point till when the second loan was concluded on the same lines as the first, I obtained your Lordship’s permission to place on formal record that no pledge in either of the Russian loan contracts could affect the earlier promise made to us by the Persian Government, that the customs not merely of “Pars and the Gulf,” but of “ Southern Persia,” would never be placed under foreign control, and I did so in my note to his Highness of the 10th May, 1902. That note the Persian Government have never answered. In June 1902 I mentioned this fact to the Atabeg at Carlsbad, but as he professed ignorance, or rather an inaccurate recollection of the text of the engagement, and talked generally of discussing all current questions in London, I thought it better not to press the point, since I did not feel quite certain [2018 p —4] Owhat view your Lordship took of it, and, moreover, had no papers about it with me. I have very little doubt that the Persians would prefer not to commit themselves to any formal definition. If they say officially that “Pars and the Gulf Ports” include the ports of Arabistan and Persian Baluchistan, they will become involved in a controversy with the Russians, who will retort that they understand the term as employed in their loan Agreements in its literal sense, and that as any doubts as to these Agreements are, by Article 15 of the first loan Contract, to be “ juges par entente entre les Gouvernements de Russie et de Perse,” they claim a joint right with Persia of defining the meaning of an inslrument to which they are a party. If, on the other hand, the Persians say that “Pars and the Persian Gulf” exclude the ports of Arabistan and Baluchistan, which, whatever “ Southern Persia ” may mean, are clearly included within it, they expose themselves to a charge on our part of having violated the engagement of 1897, in so far as they have consented to these ports being placed, in case of default, under Russian control. We have, therefore, now to consider the question whether we shall insist on their immediately impaling themselves on one or other of the horns of this dilemma, and, supposing we decide it in the affirmative, whether v r e shall do this in connection with the completion of an advance nominally made by the Imperial Bank of Persia. I am personally of opinion that there is no harm in raising the point, but that w T e should not raise it in a form which will necessarily compel Persia to give us an immediate answer, and that in any case such an answer, in the sense desired by us, should not be made the condition of what is practically our first Persian loan. We want to obtain an effective hold on the southern customs, and to prevent Persia from contracting fresh political loans with Russia, and to do this we must, for the present, make our terms more attractive than those offered by our rivals. It is certain that the Persians, if we make an answer on this point a sine qua non of our pecuniary assistance, will have to consult the Russians whose loan Contract it touches, and that the latter will find out that we are negotiating a fresh advance and will interfere to stop it, especially as they will guess that the money really comes from us and not from the Imperial Bank, which can have no interest, as a private concern, in raising a purely political question as a condition to a business transaction. The point, moreover, is not of any immediate practical consequence, since the customs of Mohammerah, Charbar, &amp;c., are of no present pecuniary value, the trade of these ports being as yet purely local. The important ones are Bushire and Bender Abbas, which are covered by the term &lt;c Pars and the Gulf,” and it is on these that we must strengthen our hold. We have, moreover, an admirable opportunity for formulating our views on this question in a more plausible and, I think, a more dignified manner. The Anglo- Persian Declaration of 9th February last provides for the drawing up of a “Reglement Douanier ’ to be agreed upon between the Persian Government and the British Lega tion at Tehran, which shall determine, amongst other things, the ct classification ” of the bureaux douaniers throughout Persia. When this “ reglement ” is submitted to us \ T &gt; e can ask for information as to the reason for the separation of the Customs of Ara bistan from those of the remaining ports of the Persian Gulf, and can then put in a caveat, and insist, if need be, on an answer to it, as to the exclusion of all the southern ports, including Charbar and Mohammerah, and for that matter, if your Lordship thinks fit, of the land Custom Houses of south-east Persia, i.e., Kerman, Mirjawar, Kuh-i-Malek, Siah, and Seistan, from the scope of the two Russian loans. We are on far more solid ground for such action, if we take it as the result of a right conferred upon us by our Commercial Treaty, than if we raise the point in connection with what is theoretically a private financial transaction between the Persian Government and the Imperial Bank. And as oui commercial declaration will have been ratified in the course of the next week or so, there need be no delay about doing it. Suppose, moreover, that the Persian Government declines, rather than face a dispute with Russia, to give us the answer we require on the ground that the engagement of 1897 speaks only of “some of the South Persian customs,” and that if we understood it to cover more than “ Pars and the Gulf,’’ we should have protested at the time of the first loan contract, we shall be in a better position if we refuse to accept this answer in connection with the “ Rdglement Douanier ” than if we do so in connection with our advance. In the latter case the advance falls through, and any new one on the security of the southern customs becomes very difficult; in the former we can reply that we reserve our rights, and shall take such measures as we think fit to enforce them should the Persian Government actually break the engagement of 1897 by allowing Russian control over the customs of any place in Southern Persia. In any case it would, I think, have been very unwise on my part to have raised this question in connection with the advance of 4th April last, as to have done so atamomdUC'’■) essentia won l ti t, M ,‘ 0 - y ° Ur L ° rdship ’ ra P id and decisi '' e aet i^ have enaWH P ? robabI &gt;’, I ; esU, 1 t ! d .

P I also think that the hen on the posts, and above all on the telegraphs, including the new line which the Persian Government is building to Seistan, is worth having if mily to prevent the pledging of their revenues to Russia, and thus giving her a pretext for meddling m their management. p or .4 colle fgu e representing a neutral Government told me that he considered this provision a distinct advantage from our point of view. “ L’Angleterre,” he said “ a ete tres adroite en chipant une ressource qui aurait pu servir de garantie, les dotianes du nord une fois epuisees, a un nouvel emprunt liusse.” And, as I mentioned in my e egiam _No. 62, the Viceroy, who is now disposed to depreciate its value and to contend that the Government of India always insisted on the customs as first security, himself suggested m his telegrum of the 11th February, the telegraphs as first security and the customs as second, for an Anglo-Indian loan of half a million. u k^P. ei r ExcelIeilc y complains that these loans are not arranged on business lines by which 1 suppose he means, in an open and straightforward manner, and in return for positive (instead of merely indirect, remote, and negative) advantages on both sides he 1 think, loses sight of the fact that as Persia’s engagements with Russia forbid* her to make a foreign loan “ a longue echeance ” at all, the conclusion of such a transaction m a strictly business manner, presents formidable initial difficulties, which can only be turned by a flanking movement, and not by a direct attack on the open, like Lord Methuen’s at Magersfontein. Persia dare not openly violate her contract with Russia, and must therefore either have recourse to subterfuges to evade it or submit to all its consequences, and, in return tor each Russian advance, consent to deal some fresh blow to British and Indian interests. We have, moreover, in Russia an active competitor, which has already advanced Persia over 3,000,000/. and is willing to provide more, if absolutely necessary, on easy terms, rather than let her escape fram financial tutelage. Just now the Atabeg would, for a variety of reasons, rather borrow from us, caeteris paribus, than from the Russians, but he would rather borrow from them, even on unfavourable terms, than risk an open rupture with them. His own views on the subject were briefly summed up in a phrase which he used to M. Nans when the pros and cons of our rival offers were being discussed by the Persian Ministers: “ Si prenons aux Russes,” said his Highness, in his broken French, “Anglais faches—si prenons aux Anglais, Russes faches; quelqu’un toujours fache—alors prendre le meilleur.” Had we more fully realized this standpoint in 1898 we might now he the masters of Persia. I trust that your Lordship will excuse the excessive length of this despatch. The most important question discussed in it—that of the bearing of the engagement of 1897 on the expression “Fars and the Persian Gulf ports ” of the loan Contracts—is no longer immediately pressing, in view of the Grand Vizier’s decision, arrived at since I began to write it, to defer for the present his request for the completion of the advance of the 4th April. It is, however, almost certain that he will, sooner or later, apply to us again, and I have therefore thought it might be convenient, and might save subsequent misunder standings involving costly telegraphic explanations, if I stated, however lengthily and minutely, in a despatch, which could be kept for reference, the salient points to be borne [2018 p—4] Din mind in any present or future discussion of the loan question which, tiresome and vexatious as it is, is the pivot on which all Persian politics turn, and to which we cannot, therefore, afford to be indifferent.

Further, his note of 21th May 1903 refers only to the inclusion of Mohammerah in phrase Farh S and Fersian Gulf, and does not raise generally the question of the customs of Southern Persia. So we should still leave the larger question unsolved, even supposing the Fersian Govern ment answer satisjactorily on this point, which they are not likely to do unless pressure can he brought to hear on them. From the paragraph to which I have called attention in Sit* A. JJardinge's letter of the 11th May to Jjord Lansdowne, it is clear that before conclusion of Russian loan of 1900, the Fersian Government communicated to Russia the pledge o/1597 which the late Shah made to us. As the phrase Pars and Fersian Gulf was used as roughly equivalent to Southern Customs, ichy should Persians who made the avowal to Russia in 1900, shrink from repeating it now, or why should Russia who acquiesced then in the arrangement resent it now ? Fxcept upon clear understanding on this point, I would make no further loan, while I would promise Minister that if reply was satisfactory an even large) sum than 100,000/. would he forthcoming.

The whole object of these advances to Persia is to secure mritish predomin nee 6n Southern Persia and,more par ticularly^ a lien on the Gulf Ports.This object seems to Lord Lansdowne to be primarily a question of Indian interest,and iiu tn^iofore considers that it would be ve w desirable that uhe Viceroy,in consultation withmtho Secretary of State for In.aa,should no/ decide upon the terms on which the Government of India won Id be milling to advance to the Persian Government, should they require it,a further su^of £100,000. iho difficulties of the position are within the knowledge of}: the Government of India and if the terms now imposed are wholly unacceptable to the Persian Government and rejected by them,it seems more than probable that they may accept a further Russian loan wit] political conditions of a nature most detrimental to C-e.In vi e m of the urgency of this question in the concluding paragraphs of Sir A.Hardingo's Lordshi-jjfbegs that ho may he informed as soon as ; decision at which tho Secret ary of State and tho India may arrive .

C 1 HAV lji tiie lionour to transmit herewith, with reference to my telegram No. 'S'S of the 24th instant, a copy of the note which I am sending to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh respecting the separation of the customs of Arahistan from those of Pars and of the rest of the Persian Gulf. M. Naus informs me that the “ Element Douanier ” now in course of neo*otia- tmn with the Eussian Legation will probably not be concluded for some months. The draft which he submitted immediately after the ratification of the Eusso-Persian Commercial Declaration has come hack from St. Petersburg!! with a number of amend ments, which M. Vlassoff declines to discuss, and expects him to accept without question. This he refuses to do, and he is now drawing up fresh counter-proposals which will have to be again submitted to the Eussian Government, as the Eussian Minister insists on referring every point in them home. As an instance of this, he told me that an article in which he had provided on the subject of fines, that'the Central Customs Authority might modify them on appeal from the local authorities, had been altered under a misapprehension at St. Petersburgh. He had written 1 A-Utonte Centiale aura le droit de lever ou d abaisser les amendes. 55 The Eussian Poreign Office mistaking the meaning of “lever,” and supposing it to signify “ clever,” had struck out this word, and though he had explained to M. Vlassoff that its real meaning was to “remit,” and not to “raise,” the latter would not agree to its insertion, in this sense and with this explanation, without a further reference to St. Petersburgh. He has promised, however, to let me have the papers on the subject as soon as his reply to the Eussian proposals is ready, which it will be in about ten davs’ time. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) AETHUE H. HAEDINGE. Inclosure in No. 1. Sir A. Hardinge to Mushir-ed-Dowleh. Your Excellency, May 24, 1903. HIS Majesty’s Eesident at Eushire reported early this year to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran that the Customs Administration of Arabistan had been separated from that of the remaining ports of Southern Persia which are under the “ Direction Generale ” of Eushire, and had been constituted into a separate division with a Director-General of its own at Mohammerah. The Government of India has called the attention of His Majesty’s Government to this new arrangement, and I am now instructed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to address your Excellency respecting it. His Lordship anticipates that the separation of Mohammerah for customs purposes from the other ports of the Persian Gulf might, in the absence of a clear declaration to the contrary, give rise to an impression that the customs revenues of Arabistan were excluded from the term “ Customs of Ears and the Persian Gulf,” used in the Eussian Loan contracts of 1900 and 1902, and were therefore pledged to the service of the loans created by those two agreements. It will he within your Excellency’s recollection that in March 1900, just after the conclusion of the first Eussian Loan, Mr. Spring Eice was instructed by Lord Salisbury to point out to you, in connection with customs changes at Mohammerah, that the customs of that port could not, in view of the engagement given us by the Persian Government in 1897, be included in the guarantee for the Eussian Loan. In May [2018 p—3]1902 after the conclusion of the second Russian Loan, I had the honour, in obedience to an instruction from Lord Lansdowne, to remind the Persian Government of the above engagement, and to state that, being anterior to both the Russian Loan Agree ments, it could not in our view be affected by any of their provisions, whatever the construction placed on them. . , . .. „ I am personally convinced that the Persian Government, m separating the Customs Administration of Mohammerak and its dependent stations on the Karun from that of f' the rest of the Persian Gulf, was guided exclusively by considerations of adminis trative convenience, and I reported as much to Lord Lansdowne on the strength of a statement made to me to that effect, in an unofficial conversation, by JVl. .Naus. i3ut his Lordship would deem it more satisfactory if I could send him an official assurance from your Excellency that the above was the only reason for the change, and that Mokammerah and its dependencies, including all the ports of Aiabistan, are still comprised with the remaining southern custom-houses in the term “ Ears and the ports of the Persian Gulf J 5 employed in the loan contracts above mentioned. fSismedl AftTELUlt H.

See telegram from Sir A. Mar ding e of 20th May. Commercial Agreement between Russia and Fersia was signed so long ago as October 1901, and the two Governments have doubtless been discussing for a long time past the classi fication of the Bureaux. In view of fact of transfer to Arabistan of the Mohammerah Customs, we are afraid that, under Clause 5 of the Persian Agreement with Russia some previous arrangement may be arrived at, making it still more difficult for Persia to accept our interpretation of the phrase “ Pars and Persian Gulf.” We deprecate any further delay in defining this phrase. We think that our Minister at Tehran should at once commence discussion with Persian Government under corresponding clause of our Agreement. Persian Government cannot pretend to be ignorant of our interpretation of Customs of Pars and Persian Gulf as including those of Mohammerah in face of Mr. Spring Rice's note of March 1900, approved by Lord Salisbury in Despatch of Vdth May 1900, to which document Sir A.

'r br 'Cfc* From Viceroy, 18^ May 1903. -P'—Sir A. Mar ding e's Persian Loan Telegrams. We consider that Persian Government and the Shah personally, if necessary, should he addressed in very strong terms in regard to Grand Vizier s attempt to refuse to make Southern Customs collateral security of our loan, in default of Caspian fisheries and Posts and Telegraphs; also that Versian Government should he informed of our interpretation of i( Customs of Pars and Persian Gulf” as equivalent to “ Customs of all Southern ports,” as to which inter pretation we can neither now nor at any future time admit question. Mean while Imperial Bank should he deterred from making any Currency Advance. As to definite meaning of phrase Customs of Pars and Persian Gulf, we cannot understand Sir A. Mardinge's objection to bringing it pointedly to notice of the Persian Government, seeing that no difficulty was experienced about allowing loan by Imperial Bank with Customs of Southern ports for security, as stated in telegram from Foreign Office of 3rd August 1901. Moreover, since ShaFs pledge of T&amp;rd October 1897 covers whole of Southern Customs, and this phrase has been consistently used throughout present negotiations, it is not apparent why they could not have been made security for our loan. For present purposes, however, we shall be content if it be recognised that all Southern ports are included in the term Pars and Persian Gulf; and, on the understanding that Mis Majesty s Government continues to share the risk in regard to both principal and interest, ive will advance on this security the balance of ^ ^ Jbuj — v i AioAjConfidential. m fly if '■ The Under-Seeretary ofi State fiorfiSdre'ign Ajfai. irs presents his compliments to the Under-Secretary ofi State for India, and is directed by the Secretary of State to transmit, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copies of a telegram, as marked in the margin, relating to jfc, (JtoALtLn.

Following are concessions recommended if it should be decided to grant loan; — {a) Con cession for road, Bunder Abbas to Bam, via Began, with exclusive right of running motors or vehicles propelled hy mechanical traction. Decent investigation by competent officer shows practicability of road convertible into railway if and when required, {h) Undertaking that construction of roads, railways, canals, or telegraphs in Southern Persia be carried out, in so far as foreign assistance required, under auspices of British Government; Southern Persia to include country south of line Khanikin to Birjand. (c) Bight to execute Karun irrigation project on lines indicated in our Despatch of November 1904. Investigation not complete, but available data point to remunerative project, {d) Telegraph Nasratabad to Bobat. Of foregoing (a) and {h) are far most important. Commercial Mission’s recommendation and inefficacy of Lur road concession owing to tribal unrest supply grounds for request. It is obvious that such a road would preclude extension of Bussian roads or railways to coast between Bunder Abbas or Gwettar. Scheme {c) less immediately concerns India; it falls within general scope of {b) and should not be pushed independently to prejudice of {a) or (6). Concession (d) should be secured in addition to all or any of above, if, indeed, it has not been already secured as counterpoise of Bussian telegraph from Bajgiran. It might be arranged concurrently with loan negotiations, but without express stipulation in loan contract. Sykes, in telegram dated 29th December, reports Bussian Minister is negotiating for Tehran Meshed road. This indicates that Bussian activity in pushing her influence in Persia has in no way slackened.Note by Sir W. Lee- Warner. I would not abate one jot of the onerous terms upon which the Government of India would advance a further loan to Persia, and I should regard without regret Persia’s refusal of the loan. For I cannot entirely agree with Sir Hugh Barnes that “ greater friendliness is likely to follow financial assistance,” or that “ we need not fear that we shall be forced into further loans.” These loans which are not productive and are wasted upon Court extravagance do not, I think, make for friendliness. On the contrary, we have it on record that a strong, popular, and priestly influence in Persia is bitterly hostile to foreigners, et dona ferentes. The friendliness of the nation is not secured by them, nor are the Shah and his Ministers made by these means more friendly to us. Since we advanced our first loan they have shown greater opposition to our wishes. They have rejected the Seistan award, refused telegraph concessions, raised customs difficulties, and in no single respect shown even proper regard for our rights. A creditor is rarely the friend of an embarrassed debtor. Then as to our being forced into further loans. The real fact is that we have so far lent on an inferior security to that which we asked for and intended, and we have been already forced into further loans in order to try and make good that security. It is a matter of ordinary experience that one mistake leads to another, and one loan to another. The real issue, however, is, whether another loan will serve our policy. What is our policy towards Persia ? So far as I can form an opinion it is this. The exclusion of Russia from Afghanistan whether in the form of invasion or pacific penetration is, I think, vital. We must go to war if Russia crosses the Afghan borders. But if Russia should cross the Persian borders we should not, I think, resist by force of arms, first because the Persians, unlike the Afghans, could offer no resistance, secondly, because the field of action would be too far off. Hence our policy is not to commit ourselves to even the threat of an immediate conflict with Russia should she invade Persia. But bearing in mind that the Afghan western border is open on the Persian side and would be threatened by a Russian occupation of Persia, we should have to be prepared for war so as to prevent the Afghan border being crossed, and if Russia should invade Persian territory we should protest and encourage other nations to join us in protesting against violation of the independence of Persia. Have we already got the right to employ diplomatic weapons against Russia in defence of Persian integrity ? We have acquired the right, for we have publicly declared that we can consent to the establishment of no fortified places on the Gulf; we have lent money to Persia and obtained some sort of security; we have settled differences between Persia and our ally Afghanistan, and we have established consulates and supported British companies trading in Persia. This being so, and military resistance for the defence of Persia being beyond S. 37. Dt 12 our powers, will any further loan materially assist us? I venture to doubt it, and since Indian revenues are to make the advance I submit that we should in no case accept any less security than the Government of India desire to accept. We have already, in my opinion, made that mistake, and I would not repeat it. When Sir M. Durand first proposed a loan the idea found no favour with ns. We felt that one loan would lead to another, and the money would make Persia neither stronger nor more friendly. Then a change of policy was made, and we consulted Lord Curzon, who in October 1901 offered to provide 500,000/., if an “adequate return” were secured. Our Minister was only too glad to get this financial weapon to assist him in dealing with Persia. Part of the loan was advanced, hut the full return required by the Government of India was not then, nor has it since been* secured. The question now is whether we should largely increase our advances to improve the security which we did get. In my opinion we should certainly lend nothing to which we are not already pledged, except on the terms suggested by the Government of India, and, if we do not get those terms, we lose very little. For our present position fully justifies us in resisting Russian encroachments by diplomatic means, and in attempting to induce other European powers to take part with us in asserting the independence of Persia, and that seems all that we can aim at. We can at the same time repeat in the strongest language our determination fco uphold the integrity of Afghanistan, and if Russia does advance into Persia we must be prepared to meet that solemn obligation. If our advances to Persia were honestly applied to the improvement of its administration the case might be different, but they only add to the extravagance of the Court, and the additional financial fetters which they impose on Persia are not needed by us to justify our diplomatic resistance to Russian encroachment. W. Lee-Warner. 17th January 1906.Note by Sir John Edge. I am in favour of granting the loan. It appears to me to be greatly to our advantage to prevent, if possible, the chance of Persia borrowing further at present from Russia. Hard pressed as Russia may be now for money, I conceive that Russia could easily raise the amount required on the security that Persia has to give. Purther, Russia might obtain a, lien on the revenues of Seistan. We know that Russia has been intriguing to obtain a foothold in Seistan, and if we refuse the loan we throw Persia into the arms of Russia, and in that case Russia will be able to obtain her own terms. I would grant the loan mainly on the security of the southern customs and get rid of the still difficult question as to the meaning of “ the customs of Pars and of the Persian Gulf.” The revenues of the Caspian fisheries are to my mind worthless to us as a security. It would, I think, be useless to propose to Persia that the revenues of Seistan should be a collateral security. Persia, not without some reason having been afforded to her, suspects our intentions with regard to Seistan, but she would possibly agree, as one of the conditions for the loan, that she would give us the first option, should it become necessary for her to borrow on the security of the revenue of Seistan. We must not think of any occupation of Persian territory in Seistan or elsewhere on the mainland. We would be too far from our base, and would only court disaster in the event of a war with Russia, a disaster which would have serious effects if we had to defend India against invasion by Russia. Our fleet could not prevent Russia, if she were in force, taking, fortifying, and holding a harbour in or near the Gulf, and a mere blockade by our fleet could not be indefinitely prolonged. I have said that it appears to me to be greatly to our advantage to prevent, if possible, the chance of Persia borrowing further at present from Russia. Time is everything to us. We could not by arms prevent Russia taking Persia, but, in the not distant future, I foresee that Germany will have interests in Persia which would be destroyed if Persia became practically a Russian province; and when the German trading interests in Persia have become developed Russia will have to deal with Germany as well as with us. In the Persian Gulf Germany could do practically nothing as against Russia without our assistance, and could do nothing as against us, but Germany could put such pressure on Russia in Europe as would prevent Russia annexing Persia. John Edge. 11th January 1906. S. 37. ^ ^ / / n A c.Confidential. C. 110. This Document is the property of the Secretary of State for India. Question of a Loan to Persia. Note by Sir Hug'h Barnes. Hie history of our loan negotiations with Persia is one of lost opportunities^ which almost invariably have been regretted. Whenever the question has reached tne point of decision we have lacked the courage to advance large sums of money, though we have always regarded with anxiety and envv the increased power and influence in Persia, which have attended the holder policy of our Pussian rivals. We have now another opportunity of granting a considerable loan to Persia and of increasing thereby the value and efficiency of our stake in the country. It is, therefore, very desirable, before rejecting the chance offered, that pros and cons should be very carefully weighed, lest we find once more that we have made a mistake, and this time one which may prove irretrievable. As is stated in Lord Lansdowne’s Despatch of 6th January 1902, neither the British nor Indian Government has any designs upon the sovereignty of the Shall or the independence of his State. There is not the smallest wish to use the concessions, which from time to time have been sufirorested as the political return for a loan, as a means to encroach upon the Shah’s territory cr authority. Por example, there is no desire to assume the control of the Southern Customs, or to make railways in Southern Persia, or to establish a Protectorate in Seistan. The main object of* obtaining the concessions suggested has been to prevent the grant of them to another Power w r ho would not be so scrupulous in making use of them, and who would certainly use them to our detriment. No doubt, as the Indian Government point out in their telegram of 28th December last, His Majesty’s Government, in the Despatch of January 1902, have laid down very distinctly the attitude that they would adopt if their interests in the Gulf or in Southern Persia were seriously compromised. They have, in fact, threatened to use force. But no one wishes to be compelled to put this threat into execution. Prevention is better than cure, and it is wiser to forestall the grant to Bussia of political rights and advantages in Southern Persia, by monopolising them ourselves, than to allow matters to drift into a position from which we can only extricate ourselves at the risk of war. As regards the reasons for granting a loan to Persia, and the answers to them, which are mentioned in the Secretary of State’s telegram to the Viceroy, dated 22nd December, it may be pointed out— (i.) That the Southern Customs amount to 200,000/. a year, and are only a collateral security for the annual payment to us of 24,000/. per annum. There is, therefore, ample margin available as security for further loans, and there is nothing in the assurances given to us by Persia to prevent her from pledging the Southern Customs to another Power so long as she does not * See Sir A. Hardinge’s Report of July cede them,* or the control of them. I90o, page 10. Such action on the part of Persia would be very embarrassing to us in view of Lord Lansdowne’s clear declaration of S. 37. A2 policy, especially if the Foreign Power were Russia, who would certainly endeavour to turn the pledge into a cession. We should have no alternate e, unless we acquiesce, but to threaten war. (ii.) As already stated, there is no present desire on our part to use railway rights granted in Southern Persia. The object is to prevent these rights being granted to Russia, who certainly would use them, unless we intervened. It is one thing to prevent the grant of a concession to another by first securing it ourselves, and quite another thing to force that other to surrender a concession after it is granted. It may be added that there is one railway line in Persia which it is anticipated vould paj/, viz., a line irom the Gulf to Ispahan, and if such a line is ever constructed with foreign assistance, it obviously should be made bv a Pritish Compauv. (hi.) Russia has never yet failed to find money for political purposes. She P in difficulties, but she will not be in this condition for ever, or even for long. Her recuperative power is enormous, and the Grand Vizier stated in December that she is prepared to lend a million and a half on conditions. The purpose in this case,—to defeat, or to out-rival us,—is one that Russia is not likely to neglect, and the injury to us that may result is, that she may be offered concessions in which it is impossible for us to acquiesce. If we irritate and embarrass Persia by refusing financial help, the risk of the errant to Russia of dangerous concessions is a serious one. (iv.) The trade argument is not of importance, except from the point of view that all our experience in Seistan and elsewhere shows that the grant of any political advantages to Russia is invariably made use of to embarrass and injure our trade. The present position is this. Persia is indebted to us only to the extent of 300,000/. Por the service of this loan the Persian Government have pledged the revenues of the Caspian fisheries, and collaterally, in the order named, the Postal and Telegraph revenue and the revenues of the Customs of Ears and the Persian Gulf. Recently, if a further loan of 150,000/. is granted, Persia has agreed (a) to accept our interpretation of the expression “ Ears and the Persian Gulf, 5 ’ and (b) to promise that all railway construction in Southern Persia, including Seisfan, shall, so far as foreign assistance is required, he carried out under the auspices of His Majestv’s Government. We appear to be pledged to grant this loan, if Persia demands it, and the concessions given are well worth the price. They include the Arabistan ports among the southern customs, and forestall Russia iu the matter of railway concessions in Southern Persia. The loan is well secured and from Mr. Grant Duff’s telegram No. 164, dated 1st December, it seems probable that the Imperial Bank has already advanced money on the assumption that the loan has been arranged. If, however, we refuse the larger sum now asked for, Persia may reject the loan already promised, in which ease we lose the concessions obtained with so much trouble and may also find ourselves in difficulties with the Bank. Assuming, however, that the smaller loan is given and accepted, in this Case the grant of the larger sum now asked for appears less formidable. The conditions agreed to will apply, of course, equally to the larger loan. The question that arises is whether, since a larger loan is asked for, larger concessions should not be required. We know that, even after providing for the service of the larger loan, there would still be a surplus, probably of 100,000/. a year, in the Southern Customs, which could he pledged elsewhere. °Also, in the past there have been repeated reports that Russia has been clandestinely, through Native agency, trying to obtain control of the Crown Rands in Seistan, and it has also been asserted that she has tried to obtain the revenue of Seistan as security for a loan. If, under financial pressure, either of these concessions were granted to Russia, our relations with that Power would be seriously strained. In order to forestall Russia here aiso, it would seem advisable to grant the loan, provided Persia agrees (i) to include the Seistan revenues among the collateral securities, and (ir) not to borrow on the same security from any other Powmv. Both these conditions have been suggested before. It is true that they have been rejected, but circumstances have changed. And though it would not he advisable to make these conditions a sine qua non, still it is worth virile trying to get them if we can. Additional reasons for the grant of the loan are— (i.) For many years the relations between the British and Persian Govern ments ha\e not been satislactory. IVe have not come to Persia’s assistance financially as Russia has done. Persia has naturally felt sore, and has become distrustful and suspicious. At the same time she has fallen more and more under Russian influence, and in her desire to please Russia lias been forced into even a greater show of hostility to us than she probably desires. Hence our trouble in Seistan and elsewhere ; the constant obstruc tion to our trade by the Belgian officers of the Customs department; the continual and often undignified struggle to secure fair play to our trade which is constantly going on between our officers in South-East Persia and the Persian officials; hence also the difficulties about our boundaries, and the unaccommodating spirit shown in regard to the Seistan arbitration and other matters. Greater friendliness on the part of the Persian Government would probably at once solve or lessen these difficulties, and greater friendliness is likely to follow financial assistance, and is worth paying for. On the other hand, a refusal to help at this crisis will force Persia still further under the unwelcome Russian yoke, and her hostility towards and irritation with us will he doubled. (ii.) We need not fear that, the relief being only temporary, we shall he forced into further loans. If we obtain the concessions we want, v r e can always refuse to go further. There is little fear of Persia breaking up immediately. At any rate, she will not break up before Russia recovers. These primitive—uncivilized—nations do not perish so easily, and if we refuse it, there is little doubt that Persia can get elsewhere the help that is immediately needed. (iii.) A time may shortly come, after Russia is more at rest, when His Majesty’s Government may wish to try and come to some understanding with that Power as regards our interests in the East. The possibility of such an entente has been discussed in the English and Russian press. When the time comes, the more we have in our hands to bargain with the better. The argument “ beati possidentes” is likely to be of much force in such a contingency, for any understanding will certainly in the main be based on the status quo. Should we not therefore endeavour to obtain all the concessions we can while v r e have the opportunity ? Persia is hard pressed for money, the Russian terms for a loan will probably be harder than ours, and the Shah is never likely to be more ready than at present to grant wliat w r e ask.v (iv.) The truth is that we have now an opportunity of stiengthemn oni position such as we have not seen for more than a genera mn and i ,s an opportunity that may never come again. Until w.thm the la. - British influence in Persia had been steadily waning, while that of Buss.a had been constantly on the increase. _ i lw flip. In the past five years, owim* to the active po ic} ar 0 P_ - Government of India and His Majesty's Government our officers have held, but have only just held, their own. Me have doubled the num ^ our Consulates, we have opened the Nushki trade route, an no everywhere shown a firm front to Russian encroachment and intrigue. Bu the hope of achieving more than this seemed till lately very remote. Now, thanks to the Japanese War, Russia is for the moment discredited; her influence and prestige are weakened; her usual watchful attention is- diverted elsewhere; and her material resources and ability to advance money are lessened. At no time prior to the war would Persia have come to us for so large a sum, or, if she had, would Russia have failed to check her. Now Persia sees her chance to escape in some measure from her enforced sub servience to Russia, and we have the opportunity for which we have so patiently waited. For the sake of the continuity of our policy, surely the opportunity should be seized. Otherwise all that has been effected by our recent activity, at the cost of infinite care and labour, is likely to he imperilled. Every circumstance is favourable to a successful deal. Persia is eager for help. Eussia is quiescent. The Indian Government is obviously prepared to find the money. The loan would he well secured. We run practically no financial risk. In fact, we make a profit, for we borrow at 3^ to lend ac 4 per cent. The political risk is small, and is not to he compared with the risk which we incur if we alienate Persia still further by a refusal. In the latter case we have only Lord Lansdowne’s declarations to rely upon, and these obviously will avail us little unless they are carried into action, and we forbid the grant to others of the concessions which we will not acquire for ourselves. Lastly, a Liberal Government is in power, whose known aversion to aggrandisement may help to persuade the Persians to believe that we have no ulterior motives behind our demands, and that in asking for the concessions suggested, we honestly desire to protect, and will actually protect, their interests as well ns our own. In short, it may be urged, with absolute truth, that of the two alternatives before us, to grant the loan is the safe course to adopt, and that to refuse it is the dangerous one. The former can only at the worst bring us into a financial controversy with Persia, the latter may and almost certainly will bring us sooner or later into serious collision with Eussia. If this he true, those who would let the present opportunity slip, will obviously incur a very grave responsibility, and may before long find themslves in difficulties, from which it will require all their address to extricate themselves. On the other hand, if the opportunity is taken and skilfully used, not only will some measure of success crown the anxious efforts of the past five years, but it is probable that we shall he freed from anxiety as to Eussian encroachment on our interests in Persia for several years to come. H. S. Barnes. 8 th January 1906.^; S '~~' Smce thlS note was written the telegram from the Government ot India dated 9th instant has been received. It confirms the view that the Government of India are ready to lend money to Persia, but the conditions which they suggest do not appear to be suitable. The general objection to them is that they go too far, and that they raise some matters that are controversial and others that are of little immediate importance. It is clearly undesirable to court a refusal by asking for too much, and things of secondary interest must be excluded from our demands. For example, Persia has already agreed, if a further loan is given, to promise us priority in railway construction in Southern Persia and Seistan. If there is reason to think that Persia will object, it hardly seems desirable to complicate the case by adding canals and roads, in which immediate competition by others is unlikely. Again, we do not want specific concessions, which involve obligation. Prom Major Morton’s inquiries it seems that, except in return for very large outlay, there is little profit to be obtained from irrigation from the Karun; levies in the Bakhtiari country would be very expensive and of doubtful utility; and to construct a road from Bunder Abbas to Bam would be a costly and most speculative undertaking. The linking up of the telegraph between Nasratabad in Seistan and our frontier post at Bobat would no doubt be a great convenience. But its utility is so obvious that it must come in due course, and all the quicker if Persia’s friendly feelings are stimulated by a loan. There is no difficulty in finding things for which we can ask. The Government of India might also have mentioned the acceptance of the Seistan Water Award, the grant of land for the telegraph station at Henjam, or the payment of our outstanding claims of 20,000Z. Except, perhaps, the last, none of these are suitable for mention in connection with a loan, and all things considered it seems best to confine ourselves to the conditions suggested in the foregoing note. F. S. B. 10th January 190f&gt;.Note by Sir Dennis Fitzpatrick. do not like to detain these papers until I get hold of the earlier correspondence; but, speaking from what is in this file and from my recollection of the matter, I will make a few observations. . . 1 . belleve most of us have agreed to the advances already made, at the joint risk of the Treasury and the Indian revenues, in order to relieve Persia tor a time from the necessity of having recourse to Russia, and in order to prevent Russia from getting hold of the customs of the southern ports. TV hether we should, for these or other similar objects, agree to advance anything beyond the balance of the amount we have already agreed with the Foreign Office to advance, is a question for discussion. BuC whatever may be thought on it, I should be most strongly opposed to the idea of advancing money or taking any other step with a view to securing for ourselves, now or ultimately, a protectorate or any other position in respect of Southern Persia or Seistan, which we should have to defend on the spot when (if ever) the time of trouble arrived. I am, as I have always been, strongly opposed to anything of that sort, because our military advisers have repeatedly told us that we have not the military force to defend such a position in Southern Persia, and, though some have said we might manage to do so m Seistan, they seem to have spoken with reference to Russia’s present position, and without adverting to the probability that as Persia declines Russia will advance well towards the south in Khorassan, and will accordingly, before the critical time comes, or perhaps I should say before she elects to bring the crisis on, he in considerable force in that neighbourhood. I have indeed heard it suggested that it would be a good thing foi us to take up some sort of position in Seistan or some other part of Persia so as to check the advance of the Russians until they were actually icady to go to uai with us, and then abandon it and attack Russia in some other part of the world, hut few, I think, would approve of a course involving the abandonment of such a position after we bad once taken it up. As to the Russians establishing a naval base or a fortified position on the shores of the Gulf, I presume our navy could always prevent that. One word more. I should have thought that there would not be the least chance of Persia conceding to us any position anywhere that might lead up to anything in the nay of a protectorate, unless, indeed, she was reduced to the very last extremity. Even our harping on our “predominant interests ” in the south and in Seistan seems to irritate the Persian authorities, as it gives the impression that we are looking out for what is to fall to us when the break-up comes. This, however, is a matter for the Foreign Office and our Minister in Persia rather than for us. * 7 30th December 1905. D. Fitzpatrick. S. 37.Further Note by Sir Dennis Fitzpatrick. 1 . In the hurried note I wrote on the 30th ultimo, I confined myself to recording a protest against our advancing money or taking any other steps with a view to securing for ourselves, now or ultimately, a protectorate or any other position in respect of Southern Persia or Seistan, which we should have to defend on the spot by force of arms when (if ever) the time of trouble arrived. My object in recording that protest was to support the observation as to a protectorate made by Sir E. Grey, and on (his all-important point I have now only one further remark to make. An outsider reading some of the papers before us might suppose that there was no need to discuss such a point, that no one had any desire to establish for England any position of the sort in question, but this is not so. We have, besides the proposal of certain military authorities to locate a British force in Seistan, the following :— (1.) Lord Curzon’s grand scheme for taking possession of the line of the Helmund from the neighbourhood of Candahar down to Seistan, establishing a proper system of canals, and effecting the “ regeneration ” of Seistan. (2.) Certain proposals to raise levies in the west of Persia, which levies we should have to support with a strong force of British troops in a time of serious trouble. (3.) The proposal, in certain eventualities, to support the Sheikh of Mohamerah against the Shah. (Defence Committee, 22nd March 1905.) (4&gt;.) The proposal, by providing funds for irrigation and the improve ment of communications, to “ establish a reversionary interest “ . . . which might be valuable in the event of a break up “ of Persia.” {Ibid.) (5.) The proposal made to Bussia, but declined by her, for “the partition of Persia into spheres of influence,” which in the ordinary course would be certain to develop into protectorates. {Ibid.) 2 . To turn now to the question which in my previous note I reserved for consideration, namely, whether, putting aside all suggestions for the establishment of a position of the sort above referred to, it might not be desirable to advance more money to Persia simply— Firstly, to relieve Persia from the necessity of having recourse to Bussia for financial aid ; and, Secondly, to forestall Bussia in getting hold of the Customs of the Southern ports ; and other such like advantages. I think that, save in very exceptional circumstances, we ought not to advance money to Persia for the first of these objects taken alone. It seems to me that it would be utterly vain for us to enter into competition with Bussia in the financing of Persia. Bussia, supposing her to recover herself and hold together, has an immense object to gain in tightening her3 hold on Persia. She can look forward to ultimately establishing a protec torate, or something more, oyer the whole or the greater part of the country; and it would pay her well to lavish money for the attainment of that object. We, on the contrary, though we can maintain our supremacy in the waters of the Gulf, must, as I have said, abandon all hope of establishing for ourselves on land any position at all similar to that to which Russia can look forward. We must be satisfied with thwarting and delaying Russia, and there is obviously a limit to the amount which it would be worth our wdiile to advance for that purpose. It is no doubt worth while doing a good deal to check Russia’s advance to Seistan, but it must be remembered she is already within 60 or 80 miles of Herat, which is infinitely worse. For these reasons it seems to me that, save in very exceptional circumstances, we ought not to advance more money to Persia unless we can secure something of the second kind above-mentioned, that is to say, unless we can forestall Russia in obtaining some advantage like a hold cn the Customs of the Southern ports. 3. Next to consider the particular advantages which Sir H. Barnes proposes v T e should seek to obtain in consideration of our loan. I have always been disposed, in regard to such matters, to be guided by the Foreign Office and our Minister at Teheran who are responsible for our relations with Persia, who are more familiar with the state of things out there than any of us can pretend to be, and who share equally wdth us the responsibility for whatever pecuniary risk there may he in these loan transactions; but I will make a few observations for wdiat they may be worth. v &gt; ■ 1 4. And first as regards the Customs of the Southern ports. If Sir H. Barnes is right in thinking that our hold on them would not be fully secured by the transactions of April 1903 and September 1904, and the 150,000b loan transaction which w r as recently under consideration, and may perhaps still be regarded as pending, and if our complete hold could be secured by advancing something more, I wmuld not oppose a further advance. It v^ould not (I take it) commit us to anything serious. If a considerable default occurred and we had to enforce our security, I presume it would simply mean putting subordinate officers into the customs houses as collectors, with a few sepoys as a guard. We would have armed vessels about in the Gulf, which, if any serious trouble was apprehended anywhere, would take up a position in front of the port, and, if the worst came to the Avorst, the collector would pack up his cash and his books and go on hoard a ship until everything was secure again. 5. The proposal to acquire exclusive rights in regard to railway con struction is not so simple. Sir H. Barnes says that there is no present desire on our part to use railway rights granted in South Persia, but be speaks of the possibility of a railway being made by a British company from the Gulf to Ispahan, just as one might speak of the possibility of a railway being constructed by a British company in some civilised State (say) in South America. It must, however, be remembered that the sort of protection we should have to afford to a British company constructing and working a railway in Persia would be widely different from the protection that would be expected from us by a British company wdiose line lay in a civilised State.4 I do not suppose any Britisli company, or the British Government itsel , would dream of constructing a railway in Persia unless it was understood that in a time of serious trouble a military force would be available to protect it, and that is just the thing it is so important for us to avoid. If, however, it would be possible to make adog-in-the-manger ” arrangement pure and simple, that is to say, that it would he well understood that, while we should be entitled to object to anyone else receiving a concession, we should be under no sort of obligation to make or promote railways ourselves, and that we never mean to do anything of the kind, I think Sir H. Barnes proposal might well be considered. 6 . There remains Sir H. Barnes’ proposal to get such a charge on the land revenues of Seistan as would prevent Bussia or anyone else from getting a charge on them, and it is to be observed that it differs from the similar proposal regarding the Customs of the Southern ports in this that it would probably, in the event of default, be found impossible to enforce our security by collecting the revenue, unless we were prepared to assume, to a considerable extent, the government of the country and to bring in troops to assist us in doing so. This, too, would be open to the objection I mentioned at starting, and I accordingly could not support Sir H. Barnes’ proposal unless it was distinctly placed on official record that it is not intended that we should exercise any right we might have to collect revenue in Seistan ourselves. If this was not distinctly placed on record there would be the risk that, if those who might come after us some years hence were anxious to get hold of Seistan, they would place officers supported by troops out there to collect the revenue, and say that in doing so they were only carrying out an arrangement made by us. I have only to add as regards this proposal that Persia seems, owing to causes which it is unnecessary to mention, to have come of late to conceive such a suspicion of our intentions that 1 fear there is little chance of her agreeing to it. 7. As regards the sufficiency of the security proposed I give no opinion. I am content on this as on the previous occasions to leave that and all other details in the hands of the Foreign Office, who will have the carrying out of any arrangement that may be made, and who share the risk with us. There is, however, one point of detail which ought to be considered in this Office, and that is whether whatever is done is to be kept secret. The difficulty that arose on a previous occasion about showing the amount in the Indian Accounts will be remembered, and the amount now proposed, being so much larger, is more likely to attract attention. D. Fitzpatrick. 9th January 1906. P.S. I think, having regard to the complication and delicacy of the questions before us, that we ought not to set about preparing an official reply to the Foreign Office until they have seen our notes, and the matter is to some extent thrashed out unofficially.

General feeling of Conned was that present opportunity is favourable for obtaining furttier_concession in Southern Persia especially with a view to political and strategical considerations affecting safety of India. It is argued that, notwithstanding present dis- organisation in Persia and Russia, we cannot feel secure against secret concessions to Russia in Southern Persia in case of a Russian loan, and that even without a fresh loan Russia might obtain such concessions merely by remission of interest on former loans. It is supremely impoitonltiikp influence of all Powers out of Seistan and Southern Persia m view of eemitv- yy' SSUtate and military espeto that would be thrown upon uh^ other Powers gain foothold there.

Loan will not save Persian Government permanently, but only defer crisis, be effected by bolstering up existing Government by proposed loan. We should have to go further and establish control or protectorate over at any Southern Persia. No sufficient reason strategic or commercial appears to justify such an extension of responsibility. Eollowing seem reasons for loan :—(1) To obtain hold on Southern ports. But customs of ports are part of security for former loans, which gives ground for objecting to any alienation ot‘ ports. (2) To obtain railway rights in Southern Persia. But such railways are undesirable on military grounds. If made for commercial purposes with British capital they would probably not pay, and sooner or later we should be put to the trouble and expense of protecting them. (3) To prevent Russia lending, and so obtaining conditions detrimental to us. But Russia is hardly now in position to make loan, and it is not very clear vrhat injury would result if she did make another loan. (4) To improve trade. Indian Government may have suggestions which would justify further loan, but it seems doubtful whether commercial advantages would outweigh other objections. Please telegraph your views on Sir Edward Grey’s statement of case.

In reply to the observations made by the Persian Minister in a conversation of the 12th. instant, regard ing the proposed loan to the Persian Government, Lord Lansdowne said that it was impossible for him, without further reference to the Cabinet, to vary the condi tions which they had attached to the transaction. The omission of the second condition was therefore, in His Lordship's opinion, out of the question. In reply to an enquiry from the Ala-es-Sultaneh as to whether, if the second condition were to be complied with, a larger amount, say £200,000 or £300,000 might not be advanced instead of £150,000, Lord Lansdowne said that His Ma jesty's Government might possibly consent to make the amountso i f J l(VU \ amount £200,000 if their conditions were complied with. The Persian Minister in the course of conversation enquired what was the engagement of October 1397 to which reference is made in Sir A. Hardinge s note to the Persian Government of August 30th. 1904. The en gagement in question is a written communication signed by the Mushlr-ed-Dowleh and addressed to His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires at Tehran on October 23rd. 1897; it runs as follows^- •You have written that there is a rumour that the Customs of South Persia would be placed under foreign supervision and control as guarantee for a loan. I therefore take this occasion of informing the Legation that this rumour is absolutely without foundation, and thatthat they will never be placed under foreign supervi sion and control.* The Ala-es-Sultaneh also gave to Lord Lansdowne a translation of a note (which is returned herewith) from the Mushir-ed-Dowleh to Sir A. Hardinge regarding the meaning of the expression 'Pars and the Persian Gulf - and enquired whether His Majesty's Governinent were aware of its existence. This note is a communication dated June 19th. 1904, and was transmitted to the For eign Office by Sir A. Hardinge on the following day. It is prior in date to Sir A. Hardinge's note of August 30th* 1904 and is referred to in the fourth paragraph of that communication. Foreign Office.

THE Persian Minister spoke to me again to-day upon the subject of the proposed Persian Loan, and made the following statement to me with regard to it: “ The Persian Government having been in need of a small loan, had desired to obtain it from the Imperial Bank of Persia at once and without any conditions being attached to it, hut certain legal obstacles had prevented the Bank from acceding to theii ^ request. His Majesty’s Government, with the object of facilitating matters, had proposed to give the loan without attaching to it any new conditions ; they had, however, proposed two conditions, the second of “which could not but prove prejudicial to the object m view. # . . “ You had on previous occasions discussed the question raised in this second condition with the Amin-es-Sultan, M. Naus, and the Sadr Azam, and the subject had been cuisoih) brought to the knowledge of the Shah. The Sadr Azam considered, therefore, that it would be proper and advisable that, for the present, this second condition should not do attached to the loan, but that it should be fully submitted to the Shah, and later, when His Majesty had returned to Tehran and there was more time for discussion, it might he made the subject of an arrangement.” I told the Ala-es-Sultaneh that it was absolutely impossible for me, without further reference to the Cabinet, to vary the conditions which they had attached to the trans action. The omission of the second condition was, therefore, in my opinion out of the question. The Minister asked me whether, if the second condition were to be complied with, I thought a larger amount might be advanced—say, 200,000/. or 300,000/. instead o 150,000/. I said that my colleagues might possibly consent to make the amount 200 000/. if their conditions were complied with. ’ The Minister also asked me whether I could tell him what was the engagement of October 1897 , referred to in your despatch of the 30th August, 1904. 1 promised nm that I would look up the point. He also left with me the translation of a note, undated, said to have been addressed by the Mushir-ed-Dowleh to you upon the subject of the interpretation of the words “ Customs of Ears and of the Persian Gulf The Minister asked me whether we were aware of’ the existence of this note. 1 promisee that I would make inquiries upon the point. m The Minister went on to speak of the Ahwaz Dam, the cost of which, he said, had been estimated at 10,000,000 tomans. The Sadr Azam’s idea was that this dam should be constructed by means of Persian and British capital, and thought a Company composed of Persian and English capitalists should be formed. ^ His Ro} al Highness desired to know what I thought of this proposal. I asked the Minister wlie .^ h ^ of any British capitalists willing to undertake such an operation. He said that he did not but supposing that such capitalists were to be found, he would like to know whether we would give them any encouragement.

In informing to of this requirement, M. de Speyer pointed out that it was ffi^ 1 ® ^ f r0 ^ti er incident it, as there was practically no outstanding question open. t j hists on the at Ardebil has, in fact, been settled, as well as the question o ^ t actg 0 f Meshed-Seistan line, and it may, I think, be regardea as probable that the .onLacL the Austrian military instructors will be also cancelled. rnoans restore The Russian advance staves off a catastrophe, but does no y y Budo-et the solvency of the Persian Government. There is sti a ce ci to the effect of 1,000,000 tomans, due, as I have before pointed out to your ^slup, to 11,^11^ of the war on the customs receipts from Russia and on exciang , been uru-ing unpaid debts mainly contracted by the Atabeg M Naus ^ the 1 Grand Vizier to accept your Lordship’s offer of 00,0001 to 200,0001 .subject to the Karun condition, and has lately suggested that the latter mig .. ^imitation of his less likely to offend the susceptibilities of the Shah as suggestmg a limitation of 1,is sovereign^ rights. He asked if I was willing to promise an immediate advance of 150,0001, “ala condition que Sa Majestd consente a donner assurance que les travaux [2085 h—r]du barrage d’Ahwaz ne seront pas confies a des personnes qui seraient en opposition avec les interets Anglais.” I replied that this formula appeared to me vague and unsatisfactory, but that in any case, before I could express any formal opinion upon it or submit it to your Lordship, I should wish to be assured that it would be approved in principle by the Shah, in which event we might be able to recast it in such a fashion as to satisfy both parties. His Excellency has telegraphed on this subject to the Grand Vizier, but has as yet received no reply from him. M. IsTaus urged me very earnestly to endeavour to do all I could to induce the Imperial Bank of Persia to reconsider its objections to the proposals made to it for the discount of its royalties, alleging that the objections of Sir John Hollams, the bank’s lawyer, were not based on any legal prohibition in the concession, but merely on the ground that the operation was not “ a banking operation provided for by the statutes of the bank.” This contention, M. Naus maintained, fell to the ground in view of the fact that the bank had already redeemed its own royalties when it first started business, and had engaged in a very similar operation when it discounted the Caspian fisheries royalties. He was apprehensive that, if by the time the Shah reached Russia on his return journey no arrangements had been made for meeting the deficit, and His Majesty ■was in pressing need for money, he might (and this, he said, was the end for which the Russians were working) be driven or rushed into agreeing to consolidate this and other earlier Russian advances on account current into a regular loan, to which most objec tionable conditions, from the point of view of Persian independence, might be attached. “ You know,” said his Excellency, “ the character of the Persians. So long as they are not absolutely bankrupt they will not discuss any conditions which they think objection able. They always trust to the chapter of accidents, and to the hope that some deus ex machind will extract them from their embarrassments. ‘ Ils esp&amp;rent toujours qu’une alouette rotie leur tombera dans les mains du ciel.’ Then, when they find that the unexpected has not happened, and that they are absolutely forced in desperation to make terms, they throw up the sponge, and in a spirit of fatalism submit to every thing.” I think there is great truth in M. Naus’ estimate of the situation, and a confidential informant who has special means of access to the Russian Bank, and who first authori tatively confirmed the information received by me as to this last Russian advance, says the Persian Government’s debts on account current to the Banque d’Escompte especially with this high rate of interest—are mounting up in a manner which may make it necessary before long to consolidate them into a formal loan. By far the best solution of the difficulty would be that the Imperial Bank should advance the 150,000/., or even only 100,000/., asked for in April, and that when the Shah returns I should reopen negotiations with the Grand Vizier and M. Nans for a further advance, which will finally extinguish the deficit, on the basis either of the Karim conditions or of an undertaking to grant no concessions south of a definite line to foreign Governments or suppoit his vie us in a piivate letter to Sir Lepel Gritfin, with whom I was personally acquainted, and to whom I had occasionally written, confidentially and informally, about affairs affecting the bank’s interests and concessions in Persia. M. Nans informs me that, although a full week has elapsed since the Russian Government expressed its willingness to make this advance, he has not yet been able to draw any money on the strength of it from the Russian Bank, as he has been told by M. Ostrogradsky—who acts for M. Grube in the latter’s absence—that before he can do this a confirmatory telegram must be received from the Russian Ministry of Finance. This telegram he, however, expects daily. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARDINGE.Confidential.

I would premise that the figures come mainly from M.'Naus and resemble most Persian figures m that they cannot be verified by any statistical Thcmtci^t and sinking fund on the loan of 200,000/. made in April 1903 will if M. Nans proposals for its repayment in equal annuities extending over a term/of twenty years are accepted, be 5 per cent, interest plus 3 per cent, sinking fund, oaa ' P Gr Cent 'i per amium ’ or aPout 16,000/. a-year, and on the completed loan of 300,000/., or rather on its present capital of 290,000/., will be about 24,000/. a-year for twenty years. The Caspian Fisheries, which have hitherto yielded 20,000/. a-year, have ceased to be a leal guarantee, nor would any banker now lend money on their security, since, undei tne new commercial regime as between Persia and Russia, the Russian Govern ment can impose, and has intimated its intention of imposing, upon Persian fish the duties authorized by the Russian general Tariff instead of the old 5 per cent, ad valorem duty, in order to develop its own fishing industries on the Russian coasts of the Caspian. _ The result of this measure, if carried out, which it has not yet been, except for a brief period last year when its execution was deferred in consequence of the representations of the Atabeg-i-Azam, will be to put an end for a considerable period to the revenue derived by the Persian Government from these royalties, and to necessitate the creation of a new fishing industry for the supply of Persian markets alone, which will be a slow and very uncertain process largely owing to the difficulties of transport between the Caspian coasts and inland towns. For this year, moreover, and for the two following years the fisheries have already been discounted to their concessionnaire by the Atabeg-i-Azam, a circumstance which was not known to M. Nans when the loan of last year was made on them as first security, so that no revenue whatever is at present obtainable from them, and the Persian Govermnent have been obliged to pay this year’s interest to us out of customs receipts alone. The posts bring in a revenue after payment of all expenses of 6,000/. a-year. The telegraph revenue varies, as it represents the sum paid to the State by the Minister of Telegraphs, his Excellency the Mukhber-ed-Dowleh, who farms the telegraphs for a fixed annual amount, and has to make a new bargain every year. Last year the Mukhber paid 6,000/. to the Atabeg-i-Azam on this account, but the Ain-ed-Dowleh, who is not so well disposed towards him, this year raised the price demanded of him to 15,000/. From this amount must, however, be deducted the charges which the Mukhber-ed-Dowleh as farmer is entitled to make for repairs and upkeep, and which for the last few years represented an average of 5,000/. a-year. The payment made to the Persian Government from the Posts and Telegraphs has thus risen from 12,000/. last year to 21,000/. this, or, allowing for the charges above mentioned, which fall upon the Crown, from 7,000/. to 17,000/. a-year. To recoup himself for the increased price paid for his farm, the Minister of Telegraphs may however be expected to send in a proportionately larger bill for repairs and upkeep, which will provide a margin foi his ^ OXE&lt; —J have taken for convenience the £ at 5 tomans. [2136 e —2]9 own personal profits, so that the State will have to repay in it lias gained in another. It must also be borne m mind that of the ai i mentioned tire Postal revenue of 6,000/. is the only portion n^reveMeS he forthcoming for the payment of interest at a fixed date, ^ 'Sed bv always liable, like those paid by farmers, to delays, arrears, and leductions obtame private influence. As a matter of fact, none of the interest paid to ns this year has come out of either Postal or Telegraphic revenue. , ,-1 a tntp wnil i f i If the svstem of farming the Telegraphs _were abandoned tbe / eventuallv obtain an increased revenue, but during tbe first few years of the new system its revenue would he diminished by the mitial expenditure necessary m order to organize the service properly. M. Nans, who would, I believe, like o g graphs as well as the Posts into his hands, tells me that with the Lmopean administration which would he necessary to work them satisfactorily the net profits would for a good many years fall short of the sum now paid by the Mnkhber-ed-Dov led. Estimating, however, the future joint revenues of the Posts and Telegraphs at 16,000/. to 17,000/. a-year, which may now be taken as a rough, if variable, tignre, t is smn would cover the interest and sinking fund of the loan oi 200,000/. made by us m April 1903. , n _p , , The 8,000/. a-year which would represent the interest and sinking fund ior twenty years on the remaining 100,000/. would, in view of the fact that the Caspian royalties are not available for three years, and are threatened after that with ^ total or partia destruction, almost of necessity have to come out of the customs receipts, and, mdee , the whole sum of 24,000/. due on the completed loan will probably, as a mat lei of fact, continue to be paid out of that source of revenue. The Southern Customs, exclusive of those of Arabistan, brought in last year a total revenue of 200,000/. I am anxious, however, to make it clear to your Lordship that, while we should be practically paid out of customs revenue, it is theoretically conceivable that we might be paid entirely, or almost entirely, out of the proceeds of the fisheries (suppose the Russians waive their right to impose duties on them), out of the Postal and Telegraph revenues, or M. D’Arcy’s oil royalties, should these become lucrative, or even out of the proceeds of the Maliat, if the land tax under the new reform scheme were to yield a sufficient surplus. Thus the interest due to Russia is, as I had the honour to explain in my despatch No. 133, often paid in part out of receipts on which the Russian Bank have no lien, such as those of the customs of the Gulf. The interest on both debts is in fact always liable to be paid out of such sources of general revenue as are most handy at the particular moment when it falls due, the special securities mentioned being only ear-marked with a view to default. If, therefore, your Lordship wishes to make absolutely sure that the debt on the remaining 100,000/. shall he paid out of the receipts of the Southern Customs rather than out of any other source of revenue, a stipulation to that effect would have to be inserted in the contract. The requirements of such a stipulation would render the negotiations more difficult, and I am not sure that its practical advantage would be great. The real value of the inscription of the Southern Customs as our ultimate guarantee is that we have a certain and tangible asset, of political interest to ourselves, on which we can easily foreclose in case of default. But until default we are not, I imagine, entitled to require that our interest, so long as it is paid regularly, shall be proved to have been derived by our debtor from one source of his general revenue rather than another. I do not know if I have made myself plain ; what I would respectfully desire to emphasize is the distinction between the money paid and the guarantees on which its payment is secured, and the, fact that the only certain sources of revenue of which M. Nans is now able to dispose in order to provide the interest and sinking fund on the completed loan are the sum of 6,000/., representing the receipts which he draws on account of the Posts administered by him, and that of 18,000/. which he will have to make up out of his customs receipts. I inclose for convenience of reference a tabular statement showing the amount of the various securities and distinguishing between those which are permanent and certain, and those which are so fluctuating and uncertain as to be considered unreliable or exhausted for purposes of an advance or loan on business lines. The Agreement which will be signed, if the completion of the loan on the original securities is, after these explanations, assented to by your Lordship, is the one of which I had the honour to inclose a draft in my despatch No. 133 of the 19th ultimo. For the present I have confined myself to informing M. Nans, confidentially, that I am hopeful though not absolutely certain that his draft will be accepted by your Lordship, but that until he is authorized to make me a definite proposal on the part of the Ain-ed-Dowleh,3 I am not m a position to save him a definitp rpnlv PTa Pi-r^ct^i^ • • , , the transaction if he possibly can before he goes on tiro months’ leavr^fortnight henee^ piosed^yhhn . 03 ' 1 mdUCe ^ Aln - ed - Do - leh subscribe the draft Agreement It may be regarded as almost certain that the Shah, if he lives through the winter will insist on a European tour m the spring, and that the Ain-ed-Dowleh will have to '-choose between finding the money required for this purpose or resigning.

Uis Majesty was I hear, somewhat tired by his journey, in the course of u Inch he was once or twice indisposed, and it had been arranged that he should rest for a few days at Resht. He suddenly recollected, however, that the Government House m which he was ^ stajung had been the scene two years ago of the tragic death of hm favourite the Hakim-ul-Mulk, Vazir-i-Durbar, and under the influence of this impression he decided on the 22nd instant to leave at once for Enzeli, where he remains as at present arranged till the 28th instant, on which day he will start overland for Baku. He bestowed while at Resht the “ Akdas,” the highest decoration in his gift on the Grand \ izier. ’ A pei son w ho is m close touch with the A aliahd s Court told me yesterday as a piece of positive, but as yet secret, intelligence that the Russian Government had just infoimed that of Persia that the latter s application, reported by me in my despatch No. 100 of the 12th instant for an advance of 100,0001, to be made without political conditions, could not be entertained, and that it was possible, in view of this reply from St. Petersburgli, that the European tour would fall through, and the Grand Vizier be in consequence dismissed. There are already rumours in Persian circles here that the Shah may return to Tehran, but the reasons given are the disturbed state of the Caucasus and the assassination just reported of the Governor of Baku. M. Nans, with whom 1 dined last night, intimated to me that the Russian Government had informed M. de Speyer that his proposals for a loan to Persia of 100,000/. or 200,000/. without political conditions were inadmissible, but that the Russian Bank as distinct from the Legation would be authorized to enter, in the course of the next few days, into discussions with him as to possible terms. His Excellency added that M. Grube had recommended, in opposition to the views of my Russian colleague, that the question should be treated with the Persian Ministers, not here, but on their journey to or from Europe through Russia. M. Nans spoke guardedly, and hinted rather than said all this, totidem verbis, but the above was the conclusion that I arrived at by piecing his various statements together. “ Son Gouvernement a deboute M. de Speyer,” he observed. I am inclined to think that what has really happened is (1) that Russia, while expressing her willingness to treat for a political loan, has made it clear that no financial assistance “ on account current ” or without political conditions will at the present juncture be afforded by her; and (2) that the Russian Government will view without regret, and, indeed, with satisfaction, as the result of this reply, the abandonment of the Shah’s journey to Europe, and the consequent possible supersession of the Ain-ed-I)owleh by the Atabeg-i-Azam, for which, so M. Nans- informs me, and this information is confirmed in other quarters, a strong party among the courtiers is. now working. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR H.

Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—(Received June 5.) (No. 100. Confidential.) My Lord, _ Tehran, May 12 , 1905. 1 ma}/ be convenient that I should submit to your Lordship as briefly as possible a connected account of the recent efforts made by the Persian Government to obtain further financial assistance from British and Russian sources. After the rejection by your Lordship of the proposals made to you in December last through Mr. Grant^ Duff for an advance, really intended to cover the expenses incidental on the Shah’s journey, and the subsequent failure of the Arfa-ed-Dowleh to obtain a loan from Russia, save on unacceptable political conditions, the Ain-ed-Dowleh seems to have realized that he must provide funds for the Royal tour out of internal resources, and he has done so in the manner described in my despatch No. 99 of the 10 th instant. But the diminution of the customs receipts owing to the effect of the war on Russian trade—a contingency on which he had not counted—left him still face to face with a deficit on this year’s Budget of about 200,000/., representing the debts “on account current” contracted by his predecessor, and M. Nans pointed out to him that he ought to leave the Regent at least half this sum in hand, in order to provide for the needs of the Administration, not to specie of unforeseen eventualities, during the absence of the Shah in Europe. M. Naus proposed to procure this sum by a discount of the annual royalty of 4,000/. a-year due to the Persian Government by the Imperial Bank, and the Directors were invited on the 9th ultimo to sanction this operation, which the Persian Government contended was not an advance or loan in the ordinary sense of the term, and was therefore not barred by the concession. The sum asked for was 150,000/. at 8 per cent., an arrangement w hich, from a financial point of view, was an advantageous one to the Imperial Bank of Persia, since the advance was really a gold loan and the Bank had the money at its disposal. The first reply of the Directors was encouraging. They said that they were considering the proposal favourably, and they dropped no hint of legal difficulties. Their next message, a few days later, was : “ Lock up undesirable, but we are consulting the Eoreign Office.” These replies were communicated to me under the seal of the strictest confidence by the chief manager here, who was aware that his principals were discussing the matter with your Lordship. He, however, merely told M. Naus that his proposal was under consideration, and that he hoped for an early decision. Soon afterwards, under instructions of a private and confidential character from his Board he sounded M. Naus as to the possibility of a somewhat higher rate of interest, and ot the assignation of a tangible ulterior guarantee. M. Naus demurred to the former suggestion, but offered to meet the latter by an undertaking to repay the advance out of customs revenue, should the Bank liquidate, owing to any unforeseen causes, before the expiration of the term over which repayment was to be spread. It was not until the 1st instant that the Directors first informed the Persian Government that they were precluded by the terms of their concession from accepting the proposal made to them. , It would obviously have been very imprudent of me, while these negotiations were in progress, to have volunteered an offer of a Government advance, subject to conditions as to the Ahwaz dam or preferential rights in Southern Persia. Such a step would have suggested the idea, which has, notwitdistanding my i ;f^ v ^ i 5 t LoMsh^ 1 Tas dhcehof iu the aiMr, hat the arrangement would in my opinion be a very advantageous one, if only the undoubted legal obstacles eoa m so.ne ua. V other uiuci. be turned. I went on to say that, as soon as impossible, I had requested authority from you to place 2030 e— 11] . had learnt that this was a part or the whole of the B ^ IV hi' S 25'o money asked for by him for the iw^Jwhich^ld 1 p^baMy rin™? on th^sole 0 condition that the proposed should be placed under British control. His Highness said this u as a veiy still snouia ue jnaceu qoo/. were advanced by us for condition ; tnat if a aige sun a &lt;- ’ clause stipulating that they should be these works, it might be reasonable to niseit a clause stipuiaw ^ + A, ^ • f * 1( executed with our approval or in such a manner as to give syisfaetion to ^ s Government (“t&gt;6 rizayati doulati inglis ” , though lie cautiously remaiked that m making this suggestion lie was speaking unofficially, so that I must not attach too much weight to it. But both such a stipulation or one based on anotnei suggestion I had thrown out on an earlier occasion namely, an engagemen o pioun a foreign concessions in Southern Persia— would require very careful treatment, and whilst both might he usefully discussed with a view to a larger loan alter the knah s return from Europe, they could hardly be embodied in an agreement for a small advance, to be concluded within the next two days. I had always, he lemmc eel me been careful to impress on him that your Lordship could give no pledge that we should provide funds for the Ahwaz dam or should view the project nnii ia\om. i ne now wanted was quite a small sum—between 50,000/. and 100,000/. —to keep the Government going during his absence. Could not your Eordship prove youi friendship by persuading the Imperial Bank to oblige him to this trilling extent ? ^ J To this I answered that, with the best will in the world,_ the British Government could not prevail on a private bank to agree to a transaction which they had been ■warned v T as one of doubtful legality, and that the condition 1 was asking was more nominal than real, since in practice the Ahwaz dam could only be constructed with our approval. No Hutch or Belgian Syndicate would invest money in such an enterprise with the knowledge that the natives might he hostile and that the foreign Power whose influence and interests were paramount in Southern Persia w T as opposed to it. This last remark seemed to impress him ; after a few minutes’ silence he parried it with the rejoinder that, if the condition was more nominal than real, w r e need not lay much stress upon it, but he ended by saying that he w r ould submit the proposal to the Shah. He added that bis u other friend ” (my Russian colleague) was prepared to find him money on easier terms, but be would prefer not to add, if he could help it, to the amount of Persia’s debt to Russia. In this be w r as perhaps not entirely insincere, as lie doubtless understands what a handle a fresh Russian loan would give his enemies. After seeing his Highness I bad some talk with M. Nans on the same subject. I need not repeat our conversation, which traversed similar ground. M. Nans was, however, more favourably disposed than the Ain-ed-Dowleh ; discussed the best method for overcoming the objections which the Shah was sure to make to any apparent limitation of his* sovereign rights, and frankly admitted that the approval of Great Britain was indispensable to the success of any Karim scheme. He told me that he believed the funds could be found in Belgium; that a financier with whom lie was acquainted—a M„ van Kerkhoven—had sounded him when he was last at Brussels about railways and public works in Persia ; that they bad talked over the Ahwaz dam project, and had both agreed that British co-operation w r ould be essential. I have very little doubt that a Dutch-Belgian project is in the air, as the result of Herr van Roggen’s suggestions, and that this was what the Ain-ed-Dowleh had in mind when he told me some time ago that £C others, not Russians,” would furnish the funds required if we should refuse to do so. With regard to a loan from Russia, M. Nans confirmed the information already in my possession that M. de Speyer had recommended to his Government that a small advance, say, 200,000/., should be made without conditions to the Persian Government, as a means of recovering the ground which Russia had lately lost by an investment which would be both safe and politically judicious, but Ills' Excellency seemed rather to doubt this view being shared by the Director of the Russian Bank or his superiors in the Russian Ministry of Einance. Only very indirect overtures had, he said, of late been made to the Russians by the Ain-ed-Bowdeh. His Highness had sent his Private Secretary to suggest to M. Grube that the offer of an advance without political conditions would greatly strengthen the friendshio between the Persian and Russian Governments, but when M. Grube inquired whether this message was to he regarded as an official communication from the Grand Vizier the Secretary heat a hasty retreat and said he had no instructions to make it. The Russian Bank Manager drily remarked that he could not treat this gentleman’s private opinions as the basis for a negotiation betw-een his Government and that of3 Persia. M. Nans mentioned that M. Grube had iust seen • i to call on himself the next day The obiect of hk vkk ^ ian( i V,ziei ’ and was 4 ment of the fimHno. rlplk wV n Dj . , hls Vlsit was, I suspect, the settle- menl} tn e floating debt, which the Russians have agreed to defer. No further communications were received by me from the Persian Government between the interviews above recorded and the Shah’s departure on the 7th “sS and on the 8th instant a rumour reached me from various quarters that His Maiestv ad o tamed an advance from Russia. I accordingly dispatched Abbas Kuli Khan to the Royal camp at Kerej, 24 miles out of Tehran, with the letter to the Grand Yizier, of which I transmit a copy, and to which I have received the inclosed reply His Highness added verbal assurances that he would order M. Nans to negotiate with me, betore to the Russians ; that he would greatly prefer to obtain the trifling sum he wanted from English sources, and that he begged me once more to appeal to your Lordship to help him with the Imperial Bank. M. Nans, who called on me on the 9th instant, and who had also been to Kerej, spoke to much the same effect. He said the Shah was strongly against the Karun condition, and he has told another/ person, fiom whom I heard it, that His Majesty suspects your Lordship or myself of having, in order to oblige him to accept it, blocked the scheme for redeeming the Bank royalties. The Persians are very sore with the Imperial Bank; they ask why, if there were legal objections, the Directors did not say so at once, instead of haggling for a month about the rate of interest and additional guarantees ; and they evidently doubt their sincerity. In the meanwhile (so M. Nans informs me) they have asked the Russian Bank for an advance, on account current, of 500,000 tomans (100,000/.), hut have so far received no reply. I inclose, for your Lordship’s information, copies of private notes which have passed between myself and M. Nans on the subject of the Karun scheme. It is perhaps a pity, if the Bank was not disposed to meet their views, that it did not say so plainly a month or three weeks ago. The ground would then have been cleared for an application to me by the Grand Yizier, and the necessary time secured for a negotiation. But now that the Shah and Ain-ed-Dowleh are half way to Resht, and can only he communicated with, in the absence of telegraphic facilities, with great difficulty, any such negotiation, which, in order to succeed, must in the earlier stages be verbal and confidential, is scarcely feasible. I cannot but fear that the net result will be that both the Bank loan and ours will fall through, and that some arrangement may he come to in Europe with the Russians, which I shall not be able to check, and which, though perhaps not immediately or actually dangerous, may entail regrettable consequences. M. Grube, as I telegraphed to your Lordship on the 10th instant, left for Europe on the same day as the Shah. He gives out that he is going not to Russia, hut for a complete rest to Austria, and thence to waters in Western Europe. I have very little doubt, from what I hear, that he will practically keep close to the Persian Court. In 1902 he was always with them; he was stopping at the same hotel as the Shah at Ostend, when I went there by your Lordship’s orders to arrange the details of His Majesty’s reception in England, and he crossed to London a few hours after the Persians, remaining there throughout their visit. Though the Ain-ed-Dowleh, whose policy, as M. Nans observes, is that of the ostrich, has told his Excellency to find money as best he can, it is almost certain that before the tour is over there will be need for the immediate provision of 100,000/. or 150,000/. to meet urgent requirements here, and should such an emergency arise, M. Grube may, by being close at hand, secure a position of some advantage. If the Shah were wise he would foresee this and try and settle the matter beforehand; but, as usual, he and his Ministeis go on livin 0, from hand to month, and trusting to the chapter of accidents. Ihey will nou realise the danger of a succession of apparently small Russian advances on accounb current,” which have eventually to be consolidated, as in 1902, into a political loan.

THE BIPERIAL BM&lt; OF PERSIA, 25, ABCHURCH LANE, LONDON, E.C., 15/6/05. t % dear Sir Thomas: - In a long conversation that I had on Tues day afternoon with the Persian Minister, I was sorry to find that a feeling of irritation existed in the mind of the Persian Governnent at our failure to find the money (£150,000) which they wanted for current administrative expenses, and which was the subject of recent discussion between the Foreign Office and the Imperial Bank. The money is not for the expenses of the Shah's tour but to meet the fall in Customs receipts owing to the Russian war. The Shah's Gov ernment neither believe nor understand that the Di rectors of the Bank must, for their own safety, abide by the opinion of their legal advisers as to advanc es; and suspect sinister motives or an intention to compel them to accept the money from the British Government with the conditions attaching thereto. WhatWhat I am desirous to s\iggest, with all defer ence, is that the Indian Government he asked to lend the Shah the £150,000 or £200,000, as a friendly action, without any condition. They must, in Teheran, have the money and if we don't give it, Russia will, with onerous conditions which will compromise the future. The sum of money is too small to make the suhject of conditions, which are certainly excellent in themselves and indeed necessary and obligatory if we are to maintain our position in South Persia. But the Indian Government will understand that the British position as regards the Ahwaz dam and the Karun irrigation (syndicate or construction) will he mater ially strengthened by an additional mortgage on the customs of the Persian Gulf. To attain this, it is well worth making an advance v/hich will be amply covered by the security of (l) the Caspian Fisheries (2) the Telegraph and Postal Revenues and (3) the Gulf Cus toms. There is no risk whatever and the Indian Gov ernment will make money by it, considering the easy rate at which it can borrow money, and the Interest itit will receive from Persia. Looking at the whole question I cannot hut sus pect that the syndicate condition was suggested to the Indian Government hy some Teheran influence favourable to Russia, knowing that it would ruffle the amour propre of the Persian Government and throw it further into the arms of Russia. But this is ex- ■ actly what Persia does not want - so the Minister tells me: while the collapse of Russia in the Far East has made an Immense impression in Persia. So I hope that it may he possible to persuade the Indian Government to raalce the advance as a friendly action, financially sound and safe, without conditions which may imperil it altogether.

As Persian Government is still evading compliance with our demands respecting— 1. Urmnia incidents, 2. Attack on Military Attache, and 3. Governor of Seistan, I am applying pressure suggested in last paragraph of my telegram No. 29 of 8th March. I have asked for audience of Shah, whose objections are alleged by his Ministers as their excuse, but if this proves ineffectual, I propose, inasmuch as use of force, such as dispatch of ships to Persian Gulf to enforce our rights, would presumably at present juncture in Asiatic politics be inconvenient, to inform Persian Government that we shall settle these matters for ourselves on following lines :— 1. As regards Urumia and Military Attache claims, we shall pay these ourselves and recover them from Persian Government by appropriation of Task royalty of 600/. a-year, plus interest, payable by us to Persia under Article II of Convention of 1868. Our total claim being about 3,000/. (if we charge 1,000/. on account of Daniel murder, which I am informed we could reduce if necessary), we shall thus sequester Task royalty for five to six years. 2. As regards Seistan, till adequate securities are given for our interests there, we shall (1) retain MacMahon, or whoever relieves him, wdth his force to protect him if necessary, on analogy of Russian Commissioner at Gumbadi Kabus, and (2) decline further discussion as to Mirjawa boundary, and reserve and exercise our right to occupy such places along it as we deem our own interpretation of Holdich Agreement to entitle us to hold : in other words, without this boundary, MacMahon’s red line. 3. Ahwaz Dam loan. We shall withdraw our conditional offers of financial assistance on this account, and shall take such steps as we think requisite to prevent its being obtained elsewhere. This v r e can effectually do, as no Dutch or Belgian Syndicate will care to put money into it in face of our avowed opposition or of that of the Sheikhs and Arabs if backed by us. Even Russia would probably find it impracticable. I am informing Grand Vizier that, in view of his bad faith, 1 regard as cancelled my promise to recommend his Ahwaz proposals to your Lordship. See my despatch No. 165, 3rd September, page 5. Persian Government in these matters is not so much unfriendly as^ feeble, penniless, and, therefore, dilatory, but it can with an effort afford us satisfaction, and I think, with Government of India, that time has come when we should force it to do so. Pray inform me as soon as possible if you approve this course. I he sooner I non act the better. (Repeated to India.) V- j 112—23 ij' ~ ^—— — [This Document is the Property of Hisf Britannic Majesty's Government. n ,v 1. Persian Loans. IN April 1903 His Majesty’s Government decided to give financial assistance to the Persian Government, through the Imperial Bank of Persia. It was arranged that the Government of India should be prepared to advance a sum not exceeding 500,000/., His Majesty’s Govern ment undertaking to bear half the risk, both as regards capital and interest; further, that they should at once provide 300,000/. to the Imperial Bank of Persia, in order to enable the latter to make an immediate loan to the Persian Govern ment, at 5 per cent., of which the Bank was to receive 1 per cent, as a commission. The advance was made on the 8th April, 1903, but only to the amount of 200,000/. It was to be repayable m twenty years, and v as secured on the revenues of the Caspian fisheries, with the posts and telegraphs and the customs of Pars and of the Gulf Ports as subsidiary securities. In September 1904 a further advance of 100,000/. was made to Persia, on the same con ditions. The Caspian fisheries bring m nothing for the next three years ; the postal and telegraph revenues, amounting to 16,000/. to 17,000/., just suffice to meet the charges for the first advance of 200,000/.; the payments on the last loan must therefore be made wholly from the customs of the Gulf. This was a desideratum upon which the Government of India laid especial stress. We are now considering a proposal to bring the total of our advances up to 500,000/., by lending a further 200,000/. for the Karun irrigation scheme. It is, however, more than probable that the Persian Government may require money at an} moment for current expenses, or for some special object, such as the Shah’s journey to Europe, [433] Bwhich is expected to take place this summer. In December last we told Sir A. Hardinge that we could not lend money for such an object. It is, however, understood that the Government of India would he prepared to make a further loan, without inquiring too closely as to the purposes to which it would he devoted, provided that we obtained satisfactory securities and an adequate quid yro quo. 2. Scheme of Karun Irrigation. In December 1902 the Mushir-ed-Dowleh in formed His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that the Persian Government had engaged a Hutch engineer to report on public works on the Karun Diver, and especially as to the feasibility oi repairing the ancient dam at Ahwaz. ^ I he engineer, Mr. Van Roggen, arrived in Tehran shortly afterwards. He remained there nearly a year before the necessary funds for his mission were forthcoming, but in October 1903 he was furnished with 1,0001, and proceeded to Ahwaz. He returned to Tehran, and presented his Report to the Persian Government in June 1904. His main idea, so far as it has been ascertained, is to reconstruct the old dams and waterworks at Sinister, Ahwaz, and Dizful, and to obtain water for irrigation purposes. He is enthusiastic as to the wonderful returns which may be expected from this scheme. His report estimated the cost of reconstructing the Ahwaz dam and of the necessary preliminary irrigation works at 400,000/., and proposed three alternative schemes : (1) That the work should be undertaken by the Persian Government, or (2) by a Persian Company, or (3) by a foreign international Company to be floated in Holland. The outlay is to be recouped by renting to Arab cultivators the land fertilized bj the irrigation. In July last M. Nans told Sir A. Hardinge that the Shah was much taken with the idea, but was Strongly opposed to the Concession being granted to foreigners. His Majesty was willing to order the project to be completed by the Persian Government in ten years (40,0001. a-year being assigned for the puipose), and even to devote his own personal revenues to the scheme. It seems, however, more than doubtful whether the money could be procured from Persian sources. M. Nans suggested, tentatively, to Sir A. Hardmge thatHis Majesty’s Government, in addition to tlie 300,000/. which they were lending to Persia, should advance a further 200,000/. to he devoted to the irrigation project. He proposed as security the revenues accruing from the irrigation works, as well as the domains fertilized by them, coupled with an undertaking that the embargo on the export of grain from the Karun Valley should be abolished. On the 17th August, 1904, we sounded the India Office on the question of advancing the 200,000/., and at the same time proposed that an engineer of the Indian Irrigation Service should be sent to the spot to investigate, without attract ing undue attention, and report upon the project, more especially as regards its financial aspect and the extent to which it would be likely to affect the navigation of the Karun. The supply of water in that river is already inadequate to meet the requirements of navigation at certain times of year. Some correspondence ensued with the Govern ment of India as to the nature of the pioposed survey. The Viceroy favoured an investigation on a scale which appeared to His Majesty’s Government more elaborate and costly than v\ as necessary. It was eventually decided that a rough survey would suffice. The engineer, Major Morton, R.E., accompanied by two native sur veyors, left Kurrachee on the 19th January, 1905, for the Karun, and passed through Buslnre on the 1st February. His instructions are to report himself upon his arrival in Persia to the British Consuls at Mohammerah and Ahwaz, ana to seek their advice as to the line he should adopt with the Persians. Lynch’s agent may also be con sulted, but in that case no reference is to be made to the proposed loan. We are now awaiting Major Morton s Report. It is understood that, in the event of its proving favourable to the scheme, the Government of India are prepared to find the 200,000/., either as a completion of the loan of 500,000/. originally promised to Persia, or, preferably, as a separate transaction, on condition that His Majesty s Government bear half the risk. An intimation to this effect has been conveyed to the Persian Government, and^ they have been informed of Major Morton’s mission On the 29th December, 1904, the Grand Vizier told Sir A. Hardinge that the enterprise was of4 rital necessity to Persia. He hinted that, if our assistance was not forthcoming, the money would have to he found elsewhere. Sir A. Hardinge replied that we should regard a fresh Russian loan for such an object as deliberately inimical, while it was improbable that any other Power but Great Britain or Russia would provide the money. The Ain-ed-Dowleh has instructed Mr. van Roggen, who has now returned to Ahwaz with two other European engineers, for the purpose of drawing up a further Report, to discuss the whole question confidentially with Major Morton, and to show him his plans and estimates. We have heard from Messrs. Lynch and other sources that agents in Persia have recently received applications for quotations of transport rates on specified machinery, materials, &amp;c., to and on the Karun. The scheme, therefore, appears to be taking definite shape. Mr. van Roggen, when in England last summer, and the Dutch Minister at Tehran, have repeatedly ex pressed their conviction that the scheme, to succeed, must have British countenance and support, nor have we any reason to believe that the Persian Government have altered their deter mination to keep the matter in their own hands. According to a Report just received (the 3rd March), Mr. van Roggen has been sounding the Sheikh of Mohammerah as to his co-operation. He has informed Sheikh Khazal that 2,000,000/. is to be found for the project. His plan is to accumulate water sufficient to irrigate 144 square miles round Ahwaz by means of a dam. The Persian Govermnent are to import agricultural machinery and cultivate the land themselves. 3. H(ishmai-u 3 * * * 7 - 3 'uIk. During the early part of the Seistan delimita tion Colonel McMahon was considerably hampered by the obstructive tactics of the local Persian officials, notably of the Yamin-i-Xizam, the Persian Commissioner. On the other hand, the behaviour of the Governor of Seistan, the Hashmat- ul-Mulk, was satisfactory. He dealt promptly and efficaciously with some disturbances which had threatened the Commission, thereby incurring Russian and Persian displeasure. When, there fore, on the 7th ^November, 1903, it was intimated5 to His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran that his dismissal was contemplated, we entered a strong protest against any snch measure. The Persian Government resented this representation as an interference in their domestic politics. On the 25th January, 1904, Lord Lansdowne addressed a note to the Persian Minister here, pointing ont that it would he inconsistent with our mutual cordial relations not to frankly communicate our views to the Persian Government, in order to avoid possible misunderstanding or detriment to British interests, which we might, in that case, be called upon to protect. Early in 1904 the Hashmat was summoned to Tehran, with the other provincial Governors, in connection with the financial reform scheme. He showed extreme unwillingness to obey the sum mons, and did not reach the capital till July. On the 23rd September he sent a message to His Majesty’s Legation, stating that he had learnt confidentially that the Shah intended to retain him indefinitely at Tehran as a hostage. He asked for our support, especially in obtaining the removal from Seistan of the Yamin-i-Nizam, who was intriguing against him. The Government of India and Sir A. Hardinge were both of opinion that we could not acquiesce in the Hashmat’s deposition. The former were prepared to take forcible steps, and even to occupy Nasratabad in order to support him. On the 7th October we informed the Persian Government that we had heard the rumours of the Hashmat’s dismissal with surprise, and trusted that they were without foundation. We warned them that McMahon’s withdrawal from Seistan would not be rendered easier by such a disturbance of the political status quo in that province as would be involved m the removal of the Hashmat, or m the transfer of the Acting Governorship, now vested m his son, to another official. On the 20th October the Persian Minister com municated to Lord Lansdowne a telegram from his Government, complaining of this representa tion, and deprecating interference in the internal affairs of Persia. His Lordship replied that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government was not actuated by suspicion or unfriendliness towards Persia, but that the Hashmat’s dismissal would certainly be attributed to his good-will to this country, and would have an unfortunate effect. It would further create a situation which might [433] C6 compel His Majesty’s Government to alter funda mentally their policy as regards Seistan and the adjoining regions. Similar language was held at Tehran. The Persian Government replied (10th Novem ber) that the Shah had not yet decided whether to depose the Hashmat or not. He was, in any case, merely a petty local official, whose friendli ness or the reverse to His Majesty’s Government was immaterial. He only carried out the orders given him. He was, moreover, careless, reckless, addicted to opium, and generally unfitted for the Governorship. Matters are complicated by the reports that we have recently received from the Legation at Tehran and from Colonel McMahon, to the effect that the Hashmat is not a worthy object of our solicitude. He is described by Mr. Grant Duff as opium - smoking, cruel, and inefficient. The Yamin, on the other hand, appears to be on good terms with our officers in Seistan. Sir A. Hardinge considers that we might, with con siderable pressure, obtain the Hashmat’s rein statement after the Persian New hear (21st March). He is, however, a weak ruler, whose maintenance is so entirely dependent upon our good-will that he is incapable of pursuing a really independent policy to our advantage. No finger would be raised locally to help him. It would, nevertheless, be difficult to drop him altogether now, and if we decide to cease pressing for his reinstatement we should see that he is provided with some other Governorship, such as Kain or Birjand. The Government of India propose that we might acquiesce in the Hashmat’s removal on condition that (1) he is suitably provided for elsewhere ; (2) that the Persian Government give a written promise to recall the Yamin-i-Nizam from Seistan when McMahon is withdrawn; and (3) that a strong Governor, approved by His Majesty’s Government, is appointed to Seistan and retained in the appointment. On the 28th January Sir A. Hardinge reported that the Hashmat was in immediate need of a sum of 2,000/. to meet demands made upon him by the Persian Government. He suggested that we should enable the Imperial Bank to make the advance by giving a Government guarantee of re payment. But we learnt, almost simultaneously, that the Hashmat had procured the money from, as has since transpired, the Russian Bank at7 Tehran. He does not, therefore, appear to rely so entirely on onr support as was supposed. We have just heard (the 6th March) that the Hashmat has required a further loan of 830Z. Sir A. Hardinge, on his own responsibility, has given a guarantee to the Imperial Bank, and they have advanced the money. 4. Sheikh of Mohammerah. In 1902 Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah, with some reluctance, entered into an arrangement with the Persian Giovemment to place the administration of his customs under the Belgian Customs officials. At the same time he pressed His Majesty’s Government for an assurance of support in the event of the Persian Government breaking their engagements towards him. While expressing himself able to deal with the Persians, he feared an attempt to coerce might be made by some other Power, either acting alone or in co-operation with the Shah’s Government. We promised to protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign Power under any pretext, and also, so long as the Sheikh remained faithful to the Shah and followed our advice, to continue to give him our good offices and support. During Sir A. Hardinge’s visit to Mohammerah in December 1903, Sheikh Khazal complained that the Persian Government were endeavouring to evade their engagements towards him. He wished to know definitely whether we would support him in resisting their encroachments on his rights, if necessary by preventing the Persian Government from employing force. Sir A. Hardinge was instructed to strongly impress upon the Persian Government the necessity of respecting their engagements. WA referred the Sheikh to our assurance of December 1902, which had contemplated the possibility of attack by a foreign Power, and we declined to extend its terms. The Sheikh is, at the present moment, engaged in disputes with the Persian Customs on several points, such as the duties on dates and on articles imported for his own private use. It is not improbable that he will again turn to us for assistance. Sir A. Hardinge considers that we should go any length to support him, as he is a valuable ally, and is, locally, stronger than the Shah, who could not easily unseat him.8 Sheikh Khazal has recently undertaken the policing of the Karan, mainly with a view to secure our good-will. (See next paragraph.) 5. Road Guards. The expediency of raising and equipping a force of Bakhtiaris and Lurs in Southern Persia, as a counterpoise to the Cossack Brigade at Tehran, was suggested by Sir M. Durand some ten years ago. Since that time the proposal has frequently been discussed, but has never taken definite shape. Attention has recently been drawn to the question by the disturbed state of South-West Persia, resulting in general insecurity on the roads and attacks on Messrs. Lynch’s Karan steamers. The main object in the appointment of Consuls at Ahwaz, Mohammerah, and Kerman- shah, was that they should get into touch with the Lur tribesmen, and study the question of creating a body of road guards, which might possibly form the nucleus of a larger force to be raised on an emergency. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Mohammerah, in January 1904, suggested a force of 70 mounted and 150 unmounted police. He estimated the cost at a little over 1,000Z. per annum. In June 1904, it was proposed, on Lord Percy’s initiative, that advantage should be taken of a recent attack on Messrs. Lynch’s Karan steamer— the “ Shushan ”—at Shelilieh, and the robbery of caravans on the Ahwaz—Ispahan road, to propose to the Persian Government the constitution of a properly-trained force of local police recruited from the tribesmen and commanded by British officers. Sir A. Hardinge deprecated this proposal, to which he felt sure the Shah and his Ministers would strongly object. He believed that our object could be attained in a manner less likely to excite their suspicion and vigilance. At the request of the Persian Government, the Sheikh of Mohammerah had sent a force to restore security on the Karan, and had since undertaken the policing of the river banks from Bandi Kir to Shelilieh. But this was only a temporary measure. Sir A. Hardinge s proposal may be quoted in his own words : “ The Sheikh of Mohammerah has already stated to Mr. MacDouall that he would be willing permanently9 to police the upper river as far as Shelilieh for 1,000 tomans per month, to be paid to him either by ns or by the Persians. The sum seems to me to be excessive, and Colonel Douglas agrees with me in thinking that 500 tomans (100/.) a-month would be as much as the Sheikh could reasonably ask for. The effect, however, of such a payment would be to render him to some extent our subsidized dependent, and to strengthen the hold which our assurances have already given us over him. The next step would be to deal with the Lur tribes, and with this object, as soon as we have got Captain Gough’s and Mr. Lorimer’s Reports, a beginning should be made by dispatching a party of engineers, nominally in the pay and under the orders of Messrs. Lynch, but really of His Majesty’s Government, to Ahwaz to survey the road thence to Khuremabad. I would premise in this connection that Messrs. Lynch, or the “ Road Transport Company,” must be our “ man of straw ” for all purposes of dealing with the tribes of Luristan and Arabistan, as well as for any discussions with the Persian Government to which such dealings may give rise, and that we must use them much as the Russian Government uses the Banque d’Escompte de Perse, and as we have begun, and will, I hope, continue, to use for our politico-financial objects the Imperial Bank of Persia. Any payments which we make to the tribes through our Consuls would be represented to the Persian Government as made by us on behalf of the “ Road Company,” or of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, and as being in the nature of a subsidy given by us to enable these institutions to promote British commercial interests. On these lines Mr. Lorimer would enter, on behalf of the engineers, into negotiations with the Chief ot the Sagwand tribe, whom he knows already, and would request him to place such a number of guards as might be decided to be necessary at the disposal of the engineers working from Dizful for a given distance northwards towards Khuremabad, until such date as the road was satisfactorily completed. u Once these men, who would provide their own arms, but whom the English officer in charge of the road party would clothe and drill, were regularly and liberally paid, it would be practically impossible to disband them, and the nucleus of our system would have been created without any intervention on the part of the Persian Government, and by a mere private arrange ment between the tribes and an English commercial Company, whose caravans and engineers needed protection, over a stretch of country through which they were working a Road Concession given them by the Shah. Similar arrangements would be made with the tribes and Chiefs along the central and northern sections of the road up to Khuremabad, and the regu larity of their pay would probably keep them loyal to us and insure the safety of Messrs. Lynch’s caravans. I mn aware that the latter firm do not wish for tne [433] I)I J 10 present to touch Luristan, but propose to begin by developing the Kum-Tspahan and Kum-Sultanabad sections of their Concession. The cost for the present would, therefore, fall mainly on His Majesty’s Govern ment, but this would presumably be also the case if Earl Percy’s scheme were adopted, since he does not, I suppose, suggest that we should ask the Persian Government in its present impecunious condition to pay more than a small contribution towards the maintenance of this British-officered force. Ultimately, no doubt, its cost would be charged wholly or partially to the subsidy which we pay the Euphrates Navigation Company and the Koad Transport Company. “I do not, however, here presume to offer financial suggestions, but merely to point out that while a direct proposal to the Tehran Government such as that sug gested by Earl Percy would at the present juncture probably defeat its own objects, they can probably be finally attained, and an accomplished fact be created by a direct arrangement of an apparently unambitious character between our local Consuls, acting in the nominal interests of a trading and road-making Company and the tribes. This is, of course, merely the general outline of my plan. Details, which will present the greatest practical difficulties, will have to be worked out when we receive the reports and proposals of Captain Gough and Mr. Lorimer, but I see no reason why a beginning should not be made this winter or early next spring. The more, however, we can keep the Persian Government out of active intervention in these affairs, and they are not likely to intervene actively unless we press them to do so, or attract their attention to our proceedings, the better, in my opinion, are we likely to succeed. “ I have shown this despatch to Colonel Douglas, who agrees with the views expressed in it, and proposes himself to make a tour in Luristan this autumn, and to meet and discuss the details of the proposed scheme with Mr. Lorimer and Captain Gough.” The preparation of a report by Lieutenant- Colonel Douglas and Mr. Lorimer has presumably been frustrated by the incident on the Dizful- Khuremabad road, when these officers were attacked and wounded by Direkwand Lurs. The whole question of our relations with the tribes men has been complicated by this unfortunate incident. In the meantime, a report has been received from Mr. Preece, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ispahan, who visited the Bakhtiari Chiefs in the late autumn of last year. He discussed with them the question of guards for the Ahwaz- Ispahan road, and found them very willing to entertain the idea. They further expressed their11 readiness to undertake the punishment of the Direkwand Lnrs, if required. The Chiefs propose that a body of 200 men should be put on the road with native officers— one Colonel, two Majors, and four Captains. They would clothe, mount, and arm these men. They would allow them to be inspected periodically by an officer from His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Ispahan or Vice-Consulate at Ahwaz, and would be glad to have them drilled by Indian non-commissioned officers. To enable as many men to be made effective as possible, the members of the force would be changed periodically. They acknowledge that their arms and ammuni tion are out of date, and suggest that they should be supplied with 200 rifles and a suitable supply of ammunition, if His Majesty’s Government can induce the Persian Government to pass them into the country. The expenses of these guards, which they expect His Majesty’s Government to defray, would be approximately as follows :— 1 Colonel at about 200£. per annum. 2 Majors „ ,, 4 Captains „ ,, 200 men „ 3,600/. per annum. The total cost would, therefore, be something a little over 4,000Z. ; but Mr. Preece considers that this amount might be reduced by one-third, if the plan ever takes tangible form. P, GRAHAM.

Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, hr' The Under Secretary of State India Office.Copy. No .229. 0 TEHRAN. December 21st, 1904. My Lord:- Mr. Grant Duff has shown me a telegram from Your Lordship No.59 of the 23rd September asking for my views as to the Mushir-cd-Dowleh* s request for the v/ omission of a certain passage in Your Lordship's des- patch No.121 of the 8th August, or rather in my note embodying that despatch, respecting the meaning of the term 'Customs of Pars and of the Persian Gulf.' I think it probable that the Mushir-ed-Dow- leh was speaking the truth when he said that he made this suggestion by the Shah's desire. It seems, how ever, likely, as His Excellency has not since reverted * to the subject, that His Imperial Majesty has allowed it to escape his memory and In this event we may I think allow It to drop. Should the Persian Government, however, re turn to It, I would suggest for Your Lordship's consid- eratlon that I should be authorized to reply that your ob j ect The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.,object in using the expressions to which exception has been taken was not to threaten the Persian Gov- t eminent, but merely to make it absolutely clear, in that Government's own interests, that we should have to enforce our rights in certain contingencies. That if the Shah attaches serious importance to the omission from a formal communication of these ex pressions, you would be prepared to omit or at least modify them, on the understanding that the Persian Government on its side agreed to modify certain passages in its note to myself which had appeared i to you wanting in clearness and otherwise unsatis factory. That with regard to the Mushir-ed-Dowleh's intimation that he might reopen the discussion on the subject should Your Lordship be unable to com ply with his demands, the Persian Government were naturally free to amplify the statement already made f &gt; • by them tut that a discussion necessitated two par ties to it and that His Majesty’s Government saw no Q ■ . twhich they had already repeatedly set forth. I might add that since the exchange of these notes the ques tion appeared to have been finally disposed of by the signature of the Reglement Douanier both by the Rus sian Legation and by our own, inasmuch as the observa tions attached to that Reglement plainly decided the point in our sense, Mohammerah and all the other Southern ports of Persia to Gwetter inclusive, being treated in it as 'Ports of the Persian Gulf'. I think it very unlikely that the Persian Minis ters, who have displayed in the past so marked a dis inclination to grapple with this question, will raise it in any form again. The Mushir-ed-Dowleh is rather fond of suggesting amendments to cornnunications ad dressed to him by foreign Legations and though I have on one or two occasions, where the issues at stake were unimportant, met his wishes in this respect I do not regard the practice as one to be encouraged.

Sir:- We have from time to time received information from our Ahwaz Agency concerning a Mr. Van Roggen, a Dutch Engineer, who was sent down by the Persian Govern ment to the Karun region last year. The mission of this gentleman appears to have comprised the undertak ing of repairs to the dam at Shuster as well as an in vestigation into the possibility of making a dam at Ahwaz in connection with a big irrigation scheme. Mr. Van Roggen is now in Europe; and, as it has been reported to us that he is engaged in finding the necessary capital for this large enterprise, and that l serious negotiations are taking place, we feel it our duty to bring the matter to your notice. It is known to you that this Company have at the instance The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. iinstance of His Majesty’s Government spent large sums of money on the navigation of the Karun - very large in comparison with their Capital. Naturally they look for a return in years to come, and hope that this re turn will be a very substantial one in view of the im mense amount of labour expended in obtaining facilities in connection with the navigation. Certain reacties of tne Karun are already very shallow, especially during the season of low water. At present coniparatlvely little water is taken from the river » a little at Shuster, and none, we he- * lieve, between Shuster and the sea, except in places for tne irrigation on a small scale of narrow strips along the river banks. Under schemes of irrigation such as are proposed there is no doubt that the present navigation of the river would be rendered still more difficult if not im- / possible. The fact that Mr. Naus, Minister of Finance in Persia, is now on leave of absence in Europe should be taken in connection with the Information furnished above. 1. t- . atove. we understand that he is specially engaged this business. lHy Board ventures to express the hope that His Majesty’s Government may see fit to take steps with a view to resisting the execution of any works of a na ture to impair the navigation of the Kanin, in connec tion with which it is known to the Persian Government that large sums of money have been expended by British subjects. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) Frank Bottomley.

CONFIDENTIAL. [October 3.] Section 16. No. 1. Sir A. Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne.- Commercial.) -(Received October 3.) (No. 22. My ^ Gulahek, August 30, 1904. 1 HAVL the honour to report, in continuation of my despatch No 21 and of my telegram No. 15, Commercial, that ^ I signed the “R^glernent Douanier” with M. rsaus, m duplicate, yesterday evening, the Government of India having informed me m their telegram of the 25th August that they accepted the arrangement proposed hy me, and had no further suggestions to make. There are a few alterations of a purely verbal character in the “R^glement” signed by us yesterday, which I have the honour to inclose herewith. I append a list of them prepared by Mr. Lindsay, who collated and compared the two documents. The only non-verbal one relates to currency ; the draft Russian “ Reglement ” having been the one sent home hy me, the Russian “ rouble ” is mentioned in it instead of the Trench “franc” mentioned in our Convention, and therefore in the “R^glement” giving effect to it. A few additional custom-houses of the 3rd class are established in the Persian Gulf for local trade, viz., Godari Balutak, in Arabistan, and Aselu, Taheri, Schirou, Mogham, and Mogu, in the Customs division known as that of the “ South.” Two similar stations are created on the Afghan border, viz., Girdi Char and Milek, in order to deal with the export of grain from Seistan into Afghan territory. On the other hand, Sirri, as already reported by me, and Naiband disappear from the list of stations in the South. I did not think it necessary to trouble your Lordship or the Govern ment of India with inquiries as to whether I could accept these alterations of detail, to which we should have had no ground for objecting, and which are of no importance and significance. Your Lordship will observe that the text of the “ Tableau ” annexed to the “ Reglement Douanier,” which has now been formally accepted hy Russia, strengthens, and, indeed, indirectly affirms, our contention that all the ports of the South, from Mohammerah to Gwetter inclusive, are ports of the Persian Gulf. Thus, under the head of “Mohammerah,” is mentioned among the “attributions” of the custom-house of that port “ Declaration pour le cabotage de marchandises indigenes en destination d’un autre port du Golfe Persique,” and the same holds good of Gwetter and Charbar. We may reasonably contend that if Russia considers that these places are not ports of the Persian Gulf for customs purpose* she should have objected in an instrument signed by her Representative to the use in relation to them of the term “other ports of the Persian Gulf.” Nevertheless, I thought it desirable, before signing the “R5glement Douanier,” to make the formal reservation the text of which I have the honour to inclose herewith, and of which M. Naus took, as your Lordship will observe, formal act. The inclusion of a formal reference to the engagement of 1897 in a document dependent on, and thus in some sort attached to, our Commercial Convention seemed a useful and opportune measure of emphatically reaffirming its validity. I trust your Lordship will approve my having done so. 1 have at the same time the honour to inclose a copy of a Supplementary Declaration exchanged between M. Naus and myself, wTiich embodies the amendments desired by the Government of India in rhe matter of the penal clauses of the “ Reglement.” There is a slight difference between the text of these amendments and that prepared by M. Naus in the note of the 10th August, which I had the honour to transmit in my despatch No. 21, Commercial, of the 15th instant. I proposed, in the last two paragraphs of that text, and M. Naus accepted, the substitution for the words “pour des motifs speciaux ” of the words &lt;c en cas de recidive et pour des motifs speciaux,” so as to limit the right of the Customs to confiscate to cases where the offence had been repeated, and protect the ignorant camel men and native traders, who are the natural object of the Government of India’s solicitude. I also substituted for the words “ le delinquant paye la contre-valeur de [2182 c—16] B i; la marchandise comme amende” the words u le delinquant eonsigne la contre-valeur de la marchandise pour garantie de 1’amende. ” The third paragraph in the Supplementary Declaration has relation to Kuh-i- Malik-i-Siah. His Majesty’s Consul in Seistan has called my attention to the iriconvenience occasioned to traders by the fact that the nearest first-class custom house at which all the formalities required of them can be performed is Nasratabad, in Seistan, which is nearly 100 miles from the actual frontier. I accordingly asked M. Naus, and he agreed, to give us a first-class bureau at Kuh-i-Malik-i-Siah, Ziarat. I have the honour to transmit copies of my correspon dence with the Government of India on this subject. As the appointment of one of our own frontier officers as Consular Delegate at Kuh-i-Malik-i-Siah, upon which the establishment of a first-class bureau to some extent depends, is a matter necessitating some correspondence and formalities, I thought it best to obtain the insertion of a pledge by M. Naus that he would make this change in the event of His Majesty s Legation requiring it, and reserving for fuller discussion with our authorities in Seistan, as well as with India, the question as to whether we should take advantage of the right thus given us or not. I must, in justice to M. Naus, say that in all these discussions he showed the most conciliatory disposition to meet the wishes of the Government of India whenever conveyed by me, and in the matter of the penalties he has, as your Lordship will observe, made concessions to me which he steadily and successfully resisted when they were demanded by my Russian colleague, and which do not appear in the Russian “ R&amp;glement,” though the Russians will no doubt lay claim to them when they get to know of their grant to us. The new “Ebglement” is to come into force on the 1st of next month.,, I am telegraphing to that effect to His Majesty’s Consuls in Persia. M. Naus informed me yesterday that the new custom-houses which he had recently established at the cost of 2,700/. at Chart, Gumhat-i-Kaboos, and Barim, on the Astrabad frontier, had just been raided and destroyed by the I urcomans, and that Baron Straudach, the European in charge of them, and all his staff had had to fly to Astrabad. He would, he said, have to establish a stronger force of armed Customs guards on that frontier, as he could not count on the assistance of the Governor of. Astrabad, who, on the contrary, always worked, for corrupt reasons, against the C ii stoms Ad ministrati on. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARDINGE. r St Inclosure 1 in No. 1.

CONFIDENTIAL. ci IOOCT1SG4 o. 1. [October 3.] Section 1. Sir A. Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne. — {Received, October 3.) (No. 165. Confidential.) Mv Lord, Gulahek, September 3. I.90L I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith (Inclosure No. 1), with reference to ur J morning by the ft liah and Grand Vizier. It is, as your Lordship will observe, identical with the draft sent home in my despatch No. 133, except that the words “an recto” have been substituted for the words “ci-dessus” or “ ci-dessous,” which appear in the original draft. M. Kabino and M. Naus thought it simpler and better to incorporate the original and additional Agreements on a single sheet of paper, the new one being sealed and signed on the back of the original document signed last year by the Shah, instead of attaching to it a separate copy ; and this has accordingly been done. The sum of 23,270/. 7s., representing the annuity payable by the Persian Govern ment for the next twenty years on the consolidated advance, works out at a little over 8 per cent, per annum. These figures were taken by M. Rabino from Violene’s Tables, but he telegraphed to London to make sure that his calculation was correct. The date at which payment falls due is the 4th April of every year —that being the date on which the original advance of 200,000/. was concluded. A deduction will have to be made from the first annuity, as the interest on the 100,000/. now advanced will, by the 4th April next, represent eight months’ interest, and not a year’s. On receiving on the 30th ultimo your Lordship’s reply to my telegram No. 92 of the 28th, I drew up the note respecting “ Ears and the Persian Gulf,” of which I have the honour to inclose a copy herewith (Inclosure No. 2), and handed it to the Grand Vizier. His Highness was a little disturbed at its contents, which he did not at first understand, couched as they were in diplomatic language, with which he is unfamiliar/on a subject which he has never, so far as I can see, fully grasped, and to which, as affecting transactions anterior to his own, assumption of office, he has always displayed some indifference. I told him that what the note practically meant was that if the Persian Government ignored the pledge of 1897 and consented to Russian control over the Customs of Mohammerah, or of any other southern port, we should take forcible measures to protect our interests/in view of the anterior promise given by it to us. He said that such an announcement would agitate the 8hah, and would produce the impression of an unfriendly threat; and he begged me, as the note from the Persian Government, which had been deemed by your Lordship unsatisfactory, had been drafted by the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, to communicate your reply to that Minister rather than himself. I said I had communicated it to his Highness because earlier despatches emanating from youi Lordship, as distinct from myself as British Minister, had been transmitted by me to the Atabeg-i-Azam, but that, of course, if he preferred that the Mushir-ed-Dowleh should be the channel of transmission to the Shah, I would ask the latter, as Foreign Minister, to take charge of my note. The Ain-ed-Dowieh replied “Yes, yes; that will be much better—I do not wish to be mixed up in the business (“ nemikhahem dakhel shevem ”) ; it is the Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s affair, not mine.” On the following morning 1 called on the Mushir, accompanied by Mr. Churchill, and delivered my note, which his Excellency read aloud in our presence, but which he took a good deal more composedly than the Grand Vivier. He observed, in fact, that it was to the advantage of Persia that His Majesty’s Government should declare that they would not permit the establishment of Russian control over Mohammerah; but he reminded me that his note of the 19th June had been, as I had been told at the time, a strictly confidential communication, and he would have preferred that the reply to it should have been couched in a less formal and official strain. 1 said 1 had treated, and your Lordship had expressed your willingness to treat, his note as a confidential expres sion of the Persian Government’s views, until, of course, the question at issue arose in a concrete form. 1 added that I was even willing that it should be kept with certain of [2182 c—1] B2 our most secret papers in a special safe, but that there was no secrecy about our rmn opinions on the subject. He observed that munshis were somewhat indiscreet and that once a question was treated officially the fact had a way of leaking out. it was very desirable that the Russians should not be drawn into the discussion. When I a reopened it a few months ago the Russian Legation had got to know of it. had made inquiries as to what I was doing, and had insisted that the Persian Government should not give me the assurance for which 1 wished or define the intention with w hich they had used the expression “ Pars and the Persian Gulf. ’ 1 he Persian Government had replied (1 understand this all passed verbally) that its own view of the question was that Moharnmerah was excluded from the scope of the Russian Loan Agreements, ills Excellency’s personal opinion was that a further discussion of the question was to be deprecated 1 said that if the Persian Government could send me a more satistactory reply than that which had elicited &gt;our Lordship’s communication, I should &lt;&gt;t course welcome it, but that otherwise I agreed with him, as I had no instructions to demand a further note from him on the subject, and as the question ot the meaning of the term under discussion was now definitely settled, as far as ue were concerned by the declara tion of your views which l had handed to him. I at the same time called his attention to the references in the table annexed to the “ lieglement Douanier to Mohammerah as a port receiving goods from any other port of the Persian Gmf, and suggested that the Ttussian Legation, if it contended that Mohammerah was not a Gulfport, might be reminded of its own acceptance of the table in question. His Excellency took note or this point. . . , , j i i M. Nans tells me that he has iiad some conversation with the Am-ed-Dowieh on me subject* of mv note, which his Highness seemed to consider unduly menacing. “You may be certain,” said M. Naus to him, “ that if, in defiance of the engagement of 1S97, you were to agree to hand over the Customs of Mohammerah to the Russians, the English would send a ship of war there to prevent it. What difference, then, can it make whether they announce to you their intention beforehand or use force, as they certainly would, without giving you previous warning?” The Grand Vizier seemed disposed to recognize the of force] M.. Nans’contention. n The day after my interview with the Mushir-ed-Oowleh I learned that M. Rabino had received authority to sign the Agreement, and I accordingly informed M. Naus that, as I had made the required formal communication respecting “ Pars and the Persian Gulf” both to the Grand Vizier and the Mushir-ed-Dowleh, I saw no objection to its being completed on the following morning, so as to allow ids Excellency to leave for Europe without further delay. j thought it very important that all the formalities should take place before M. Nans’ departure, as the Shah had displayed some reluctance to sanction a further hypothecation of the Gulf Customs, and had actually argued that he never pledged their revenues last year. The Ain-ed-Dowleh was not satisfied with a copy of the Agreement of April 1903, which was sent to him t&lt;- prove the fact, hut insisted on seeing the original document ratified by His Majesty’s own autograph. Mhen M. Naus showed it to him, he held it up to the light and turned and twisted it, “ as if,” said M. Naus to me, “ he half suspected that I had interpolated at a later date the words £ Customs of Ears and the Persian Gulf/ which he was forced to admit figured in it.” As it was, the Ain-ed-Dowleh was at one time inclined to draw back from the proposal he had authorized M. Naus to make to me, and to say that what he wanted was 300,000/., as a single 100,000/. would not help him with the Karun scheme. His Excellency had a good deal of difficulty in persuading him not to do this, and asked me, as will be seen by the inclosed note (Inclosure 3;, to facilitate the negotiation by writing him a letter on the subject, saying that 1 would recommend the Karun project to your Lordship. 1 said 1 had no objection to do this, so long as it was made clear that 1 could not undertake to express any opinion as to the view which you would take of the proposal, and I accordingly sent him the note of which 1 have the honour to inclose a copy (Inclosure 4). I thought it not a bad thing to place on formal record that the Persian Government had made a direct application tor a loan to that of His Majesty. Such a direct application, made and admitted without a reference to the fiction of the Imperial Bank of Persia, represents a further step towards the complete overthrow of the Russian loan monopoly of 1900 and of the Russian financial control which it connoted. The situation is already very different from what it was three years ago, when the Atabeo'-i-Azam was so timid about borrowing a large sum, even on account current from tin; Imperial Bank of Persia, that I ivas asked to keep all correspondence about the advance of April 1901 an absolute secret from my munshis, lest it should reach the ears of the Russian negation, and when our offer, made in the autumn of that year, wasm a J &amp;y 3 referred for his permission to accept it to M. Arg'yropoulo, J gather from a remark dropped by M. Grube to a member of my staff that the Russians have bad some inkling of our recent negotiation, and this was one of my reasons for desiring as quick a settlemen t as possible, lest a remonstrance by them should, in the Shah’s present uncertain temper, delay it. With reference to the Kanin scheme, I have the honour to inclose a copy of a note by M. Nans to me (Inclosure 51 on this subject, together with a copy of the covering despatch (fnclosure 6), in which I transmitted it on the 20th ultimo to the Government of India I believe the scheme, if its realization does not, as 1 fancy it need not, interfere with the navigation of the Karun, might greatly conduce to the promotion of British interests in Southern Persia. It will, however, be very difficult to negotiate without the assistance of M. Nans, who has just started for Europe on a three months’ leave of absence, and I presume it will be some little time before your Lordship will be in a position to give me definite instructions with regard to it. M. ]Vaus’ own idea is that the sum of 200,000/. will be inadequate for the completion of the Karun works, and he has told the Ain-ed-Dowleh that he would be wise to ask for a larger sum, as otherwdse he will find, when he has expended the 200,000/., that he must apply for a further advance to His Majesty’s Government, and will then, as so often happened to the Atabeg in dealing with the Russians, have perforce to submit to any terms which the lender may dictate. His Highness, however, maintains that the amount for which he is applying is sufficient. The Agreement signed on the 1st instant and ratified next day by the Shah for the completion of the advance of last year remains pending further instructions from your Lordship in the custody of the Imperial Bank of Persia.

Naus the declaration inclosed respecting the distinction made in the table annexed to the “ Rbglement,” between the Customs of “ Arabistan ” and the so-called Customs of “the south,” of which his Excellency took act. 1 am at the same time instructed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to make to your Excellency the following communication on this subject, on the part of His Majesty’s Government:— His Majesty’s Government have received the note from your Excellency dated the 19th June lust, respecting the meaning attached by it to the expression “ Ears and the Persian Gulf.” They take note of the formal admission made in that note that the intention of the Persian Government in using that expression was to exclude from the operation of the Russian Loan Contracts all the Customs of Southern Persia; but they regret that your Lxcellency’s reply cannot, in other respects, be considered satisfactory. They deem it unnecessary to recapitulate the views held by His Majesty’s Govern ment on this question, which have been clearly and definitely expressed, both in Tehran and m London. In order, however, to avoid any possibility of misunderstanding, I am instructed to inform the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government hold them to their engagement of October 1897. This engagement is anterior to the Russian Loan Agreements, and cannot be affected by any of their provisions. 1 am at the same time to state that, as it was admittedly intended by the British and Persian Governments that the term “ Bars and the Persian Gulf” should include all the Customs of Southern Persia referred to in the engagement of 1897, His Majesty’sI avail, &amp;c.

On hist hearing that your Highness desired British financial assistance for this scheme, I telegraphed in this sense to London. Lord Lansdowne replied that His Majesty’s Govemment was considering the question, but that they would wish to be satisfied, before encouraging it, that the proposed works would not, by diminishing the water supply of the Karun, impede the navigation of that river, in which British trade with Persia is greatly interested. Since then, as a consequence of further messages which I have sent, His Majesty’s Government are taking a more active interest in the question, and I may tell your Highness confidentially that they are already instituting inquiries into the practicability of the scheme, and will probably, if the inquiries confirm the impressions derived by the Persian Government from the reports of its European engineer, Herr von Roggen, authorize me to discuss with your Highness some definite proposals on this subject W hilst, however, I am obviously not in a position to give your Highness any assurance as to the view w T hich my Government may, after full examination of your proposals, take of them, I gladly renew r to you the expression of my personal sympathy with a project which aims at increasing the prosperity of the province of Arabistan and the general wealth of Persia, and of my willingness to recommend it to Lord Lansdowne, and to promote, to the best of my ability, a mutually satisfactory arrangement for the purpose between our respective Governments.

His Excellency quite understood that the question of a loan for the irrigation of Arabistan would require careful consideration. But he said he believed the Persian Government could satisfy us that the works contemplated would not diminish the water supply of the Karun. M. van Roggen’s plans would require to be completed by a further local survey before the Persian Government was in a position to lay its proposals before us, and he himself thought that a larger sum than 200 , 000 /. would be necessary in order to carry them out. I gathered from him that the Grand Vizier’s extreme interest in this scheme was to some extent a matter of personal vanity, as his Highness had told him that if they between them could find the means of restoring the ancient fertility and wealth of Arabistan, their names would go down to posterity illumined with a halo of imperishable glory, and that the Ain-ed-Dowleh’s own Premiership, thus marked by a revival of national prosperity, would contrast all the more strikingly with that of the Atabeg-i- Azam, which had brought Persia so near to ruin.

My Lord ^ Gulahek, August 16, 1904.. 1 liA Vb, bad the honour to receive your Lordship’s telegram No. 5.1 of the 1.1th instant, in which you inform me that His Majesty’s Government are prepared, to complete the man ^of April 1903 on the original securities, because they understand that, the Caspian fisheries and Posts and Telegraphs being already exhausted, the sole stemiev wouid, m fact, be the Southern Customs. Your Lordship also draws my attention s o the possibility of an increase in the postal and telegraphic revenue, which might dimmish the proportion of the new loan secured on the customs. I think I ought to explain exactly the present position and amount of these various secuiities, so mi as I have been able to ascertain them, m order to avoid all possibility of misunderstanding owing to any unintentionally loose expressions which may have been employed by me. I would premise that the figures come mainly from M.' Nans, and resemble most lersian ngures in tnat they cannot be verified by any statistical publication. The ^interest and sinking fund on the loan of 200,000/. made in April 1903 will, if M. Yaus proposals for its repayment in equal annuities extending over a term of twenty \ ears are accepted, be 5 per cent, interest plus 3 per cent, sinking fund, i.e., 8 per cent, per annum, or about 16,000/. a-year, and on the completed loan of 300,000/., or rather on its present capital of 290,000/., will be about 24,000/. a-year for twenty years. The Caspian Fisheries, which have hitherto yielded 20,000/. a-year, have ceased to be a leal guarantee, nor would any banker now lend money on their security, since, under the new commercial regime as between Persia and Russia, the Russian Govern- ment can impose, and has intimated its intention of imposing, upon Persian fish the duties authorized by the Russian general Tariff instead of the old 5 per cent, ad valorem duty,^ in order to develop its own fishing industries on the Russian coasts of the Caspian. _ The result of this measure, if carried out, which it has not yet been, except for a brief period last year when its execution was deferred in consequence of the lepresentalions of the Atabeg-i-Azam, will be to put an end for a considerable period to the revenue derived by the Persian Government from these royalties, and to necessitate the creation of a new fishing industry for the supply of Persian markets alone, which will be a slow and very uncertain process largely owing to the difficulties of transport between the Caspian coasts and inland towns. * For this year, moreover, and for the two following years the fisheries have already been discounted to their concessionnaire by the Atabeg-i-Azam, a circumstance which was not known to M. Nans wnen the loan of last year was made on them as first security, so that no revenue whatever is at present obtainable from them, and the Persian Government have been obliged to pay this year’s interest to us out of customs receipts alone. ^ The posts bring in a revenue after payment of all expenses of 6,000/. a-year. The telegraph revenue varies, as it represents the sum, paid to the State by the Minister of -telegraphs, his Excellency the Mukhber-ed-Dowleh, who farms the telegraphs for a hxea annual amount, and has to make a new bargain every year. Last year the Mukhber paid 6,000/. to the Atabeg-i-Azam on this account, but the Aih-ed-Dowleh, who is not so well disposed towards him, this year raised the price demanded of him to lo,0(Xk. From this amount must, however, be deducted the charges which the Mukhber-ed-Dowleh as farmer is entitled to make for repairs and upkeep, and which for the last few years represented an average of 5,000/. a-year. The payment made to the Persian Government from the Posts and Telegraphs has thus risen from 12,000/. last year to 21,000/. this, or, allowing for the charges above mentioned, which fall upon the Crown, from 7,000/. to 17,000/. a-year. To recoup himself for the increased price paid for his farm, the Minister of Telegraphs may however be expected to send in a proportionately larger bill for repairs and upkeep, which will provide a margin for bis Note.—I have taken for convenience the £ at 5 tomans.own personal profits, so that the State will private influence. As a matter of fact, none of the interest paid to ns tms tear come out of either Postal or Telegraphic revenue. , , j t i 1P State would If the system of farming the Telegraphs were abandoned the btate wo eventually obtain an increased revenue, but during the first few J ears of system its revenue would be diminished by the initial expen lure no to organize the service,propmly. who would, IJielieve, ^ graphs as well as tPe Posts into ms naimo, ^ r&gt;Pt-nrofits would administration which would he necessary to work them satisfaetoril} the P for a good many years fall short of the sum now paid by the M p '^h a nd Te^rauhs at Estimating, however, the future joint revenues of the v y n , this 10,000/. to 17,000/. a-year, which may now he taken as a rough if vanable fi„ ^ sum would cover the interest and sinking fund ol the loan of -* , • - - '^'''TheS.OOO/. a-year which would represent the interest and sinking fund for twenty vears on the remaining 100,000/. would, in view of the fact that the C ^pi a n ™jatoes are not available for three years, and are threatened after that with .total o pa destruction, almost of necessity have to come out of the customs receipts, and, indeed, the whole sum of 24,000/. due on the completed loan will probably, as a matter of ±ac continue to be paid out of that source of revenue. The Southern Customs, exclusive those of Arabistan, brought in last year a total revenue of -lh),UU . v i •. -t I am anxious, however, to make it clear to your Lordship that, w 11 e aw _ practically paid out of customs revenue, it is theoretically conceivable that we might be paid entirely, or almost entirely, out of the proceeds of the fisheries (suppose the Russians Avaive their right to impose duties on them), out of the Postal and Telegrap revenues, or M. D’Arcy’s oil royalties, should these become lucrative, or even out oi the proceeds of the Maliat, if the land tax under the new reform scheme were to yield a sufficient surplus. Thus the interest due to Russia is, as I had the homm 1 to explain in my despatch No. 133, often paid in part out of receipts on which the Russian Rank have* no lien, such as those of the customs of the Gulf. The interest on both debts is in fact alwavs liable to be paid out of such sources of general revenue as are most handy at the particular moment when it falls due, the special securities mentioned being only ear-marked with a vibav to default. n n , + i i m ™ If, therefore, your Lordship wishes to make absolutely sure that the debt o remaining 100,0001 shall be paid out of the receipts of the Southern Customs rather than out'of any other source of revenue, a stipulation to that eftect would have to e inserted in the contract. The requirements of such a stipulation avouL. render t ie negotiations more difficult, and I am not sure that its practical advantage would oe great. The real value of the inscription of the Southern Customs as our u tima e guarantee is that we have a certain and tangible asset, of political interest to ourse vns on Avhich we can easily foreclose in case of default. But until default we are not 1 imagine, entitled to require that our interest, so long as it is paid regularly shall be proved to have been derived by our debtor from one source of his general revenue rather than another. I do not know if I have made myself plain; what 1 would respectfully desire to emphasize is the distinction between the money paid and tie o-uarantees on which its pavment is secured, and the, fact that the omy certain sources of revenue of which M. Nans is now able to dispose m order to provide the interest and sinking fund on the completed loan are the sum of G,000/., repiesentmg the receipts which he draws on account of the Posts administered by him, and that of 18 000/. which he will have to make up out of his customs receipts. _ I inclose for convenience of reference a tabular statement showing the amount ol the various securities and distinguishing between those which are permanent and certain, and those which are so fluctuating and uncertain as to he considered unrelia J e or exhausted for purposes of an advance or loan on business lines. . The Agreement which will he signed, if the completion of the loan on the original securities is, after these explanations, assented to by yonr Lordship is the one of which T had the honour to inclose a draft m my despatch No. 133 of the I Jth ultimo. Foi the present T have confined myself to informing M. Nans, confidentially, that I am hopeful though not absolutely certain that his draft will be accepted by your Lordship, but that until he is authorized to make me a definite proposal on the part of the Am-ed-Dowleh, &gt;S°fwliat ® above upon to f me being ained by fear has 0 tfoiiid tbe ne? n order be Tele- rropean s would i. ipbs at re, this y ns in twenty yalties oartial ideed, ' fact, ive of Id be hthe the raph it of ield , , lain M ant 1 in idy iJ 7 ae ?r e I am not m a position to give him a definite reply. He, himself, is anxious to complete the transaction if he possibly can before he goes on two months’ leave a fortnight hence, and believes he can induce the Ain-ed-Dowleh to subscribe the draft Agreement proposed by him. It may be regarded as almost certain that the Shah, if he lives through the winter, will insist on a European tour in the spring, and that the Ain-ed-Dowleh will have to choose between finding the money required for this purpose or resigning. Dr. Schneider tells me that His Highness has agreed to the tour in principle, but wishes in order to diminish its unpopularity that it should be preceded by a visit to Meshed, which it is the duty of every Shah once in his reign to dust, as ex officio Chief Sweeper of Imam Reza’s sanctuary, the Saint’s shrine with a jewelled broom.

Sir A. Hardinge submits a draft agreement, prepar-^^J ed by the Persian Minister of Customs, for the comple tion of the advance of Three hundred thousand Pounds i S il ill offered last year to the Persian Government, but of which only Two hundred thousand Pounds was then accept ed by them. He reports, at the same time, a tentative proposal made by Monsieur Naus that His Majesty's Gov ernment should lend an additional Two hundred thousan( Pounds, to enable the Persian Government to carry out certain irrigation works in Arabistan. Monsieur Naus suggests that the revenues accruing from these works. The Under Secretary of State, India Office.as well as the doraalns fertilised by them, might he pledged as a subsidiary security for the additional / advance, the pledge to be coupled with an undertaking that restrictions on the export of grain from the Ka- run valley should be henceforth abolished. In view of the fact that His Majesty's Govern- ment have agreed to complete the advance of April 1903 on the same terms as were then offered, it is un necessary to follow the arguments advanced by Sir A. Hardinge against attaching any fresh conditions to the loan of the additional One hundred thousand Pounds. £100,000 Nor is it necessary to discuss the additions to Monsieur Naus* draft agreement which are proposed in his des patch, but which, as will be seen from his telegram of August 9th, herewith annexed, he now desires to withdraw. The agreement in question appears to Lord Lans- downe to meet the requirements of the case, hut His Lordship would be glad to be favoured with any obser-The question of a further advance to the Persian Government on the security of the Karun irrigation scheme, is one v/hich should, in Lord Lansdowne's opin ion, he taken into serious consideration. The propos al may shortly he submitted to His Majesty's Government in a more definite form, and an enquiry into its advan tages and disadvantages at the present time, v/iil ob viate the necessity of inter-Departmental correspond ence later on, and of a hurried and possibly inadequate discussion under pressure of information that delay may entail the concession passing into foreign hands. Sir A. Hardinge has reported that a scheme has already been drawn up and submitted to the Shah by the Dutch engineer. Monsieur Van Roggen, and that the idea has proved so attractive to His Majesty that, in order to avoid foreign interference and to monopolise the profits, he is considering the advisability of financ ing the undertaking out of his own private purse. It would therefore appear probable that the project will, sooner or later, be carried out, if possible by the Persian Government, or, should their resources prove unequalnil 11 unequal to the task, under foreign auspices. Irrigation works on an extensive scale might se riously diminish the flow of water in the Karun river and impede the navigation, which is mainly in British hands. It is possible, however, that this might not he the case if competent engineers were employed and the works were carried out under scientific supervi sion; such conditions would not he secured should the i Persian Government in the unlikely event of their be- &gt; r* 1/ ing able to dispose of the necessary funds, undertake the execution of the project themselves. If, on the other hand, the scheme were carried out under foreign auspices, it is improbable that much consideration would be given to the Injury which might be inflicted thereby on British shipping on the Karun. If the Persian Government attempt to carry out the scheme themselves, they will be obliged to apply for a foreign loan. The Customs of Pars cannot, how ever, be mortgaged to any Power but Great Britain, and || His Majesty’s Government would certainly oppose any proposal to mortgage the land revenues of that pro vinceprovince to foreigners, as they opposed the proposal to mortgage the grain revenues of Seistan. They could a ^ so &gt; ^ 1 necessary, object to the project altogether, on the ground of the injury which it would inflict on British shipping. Persia would therefore be obliged, either to borrow from His Majesty’s Government on the security which they chose to accept and under the condi tions which they laid down, or to entrust to British agency the whole execution of the. scheme. In view of the obvious inexpediency of appearing^S to obstruct projects of development in Persia, Lord Lansdowne is of opinion that steps should be taken without delay to ascertain how far irrigation works could be carried out on the Karun river with a reason able prospect of success and without impeding naviga tion, and that if the enquiry proves satisfactory, the Shah should be encouraged to pursue the project under British auspices. The success attained by the engineers of the In- dian Irrigation Service in India and in Egypt is so well known that it might be possible to convince His Maj estyMajesty that his financial interests would test he served hy seeking their assistance. Should Mr. Van Roggen prove correct in his favourable forecast of the prospects of the undertaking, the profits might well he sufficient to yield a substantial revenue to the Shah over and above the amount required to secure any advance made by His Majesty’s Government. Lord Lansdowne would be glad to be favoured with Mr. Brodrick's views and observations on the question now raised by Sir A. Hardinge. His Lord- ship would further suggest, for Mr. Brodrick’s con sideration, that, if Sir A. Hardinge saw no objec tion to such a proposal, an engineer of the Indian Irrigation Service should be sent to Arabistan, to investigate without attracting undue attention, and report upon the Karun irrigation project, more es pecially as regards its financial aspect and the extent to which it would be likely to affect the navigation of the river. Such a report would en able His Majesty’s Government to form a more accurate opinion6 J opinion as to the possibilities of the scheme, from a financial as well as from a political point of view.

My Lord Monsieur Nans spoke to me confidentially on tho 4th instant as I had the honour to report in my telegram No./&lt;* of that date, about the effect of the Japanese war and the cholera epidemic on the Customs come to apply for the completion of the advance of £300,000 offered last year by Your Lordship, but of which only ,-6200,000 had been drawn by the Persian Gov ernment. His Excellency explained that he was not yet authorized by the Ain-ed-Dowleh to negotiate with me and was merely preparing the ground for the discus sion which he believed could not long be delayed. which I enclose a copy herewith. It satisfied, he contended, the two conditions on v/hich we had insisted in the Spring of 1903, namely security against early repayment and the assignation of the Customs of the He then showed me the draft agreement of Persian 'he Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., &amp;c ., &amp;c., &amp;c., /Persian Gulf. I pointed out that I had always been ordered to ask that the third instalment of £100,000 should be secured on the Gulf Customs alone without reference to the Caspian Fisheries or Posts and Tele graphs and that although the point might not seem to him of much practical importance since the exhaus tion of the two former securities made the ultimate one, that is the Gulf Customs, the de facto guaran tee, still His Majesty's Government, as the lenders, wished that this should be explicitly stated, I could not see why the Persian Government should hesi tate to re-emphasize in words the assignation of a security which they were ready to grant in fact. His Excellency replied that he would be able to get the consent of the Persian Ministers and of the Shah more easily if the point on which I laid stress was not emphasized. *Le Schah* he observed.*se paie de mots 1 and as His Majesty has an idea that any fur- &amp; ther hypothecation of the Customs will affect hishis attention to it. The mention of the Caspian Fisheries as the nominal first security, albeit a purely meaningless and decorative phrase, would moreover be helpful to the Persian Government as en abling them to wrap up what is really a foreign loan, inconsistent with their pledges to Russia, in the cloak of a mere discount operation by the Imperial Bank. Personally, as Your Lordship is aware from my telegram No.74 of the 4th instant, I would have been glad if His Majesty’s Government could have seen their way to accept Monsieur Nans’ formula. I have never been quite able to comprehend the objection to men tioning pro forma an extra dummy security like the Caspian Fisheries, if its mention makes it easier to secure the substantial end aimed at. I do not think, moreover, that His Majesty’s Government or His Excel lency the Viceroy who has always appeared to me, if I may say *so without disrespect to him, to lay rather more sthess than Your Lordship on the verbal as dis tinct from the practical aspects of these transac tionstransactions, has quite realized that it does not follow, because a particular source of revenue, say the Gulf Customs, is affected to the payment of a particular debt, that that debt will be necessarily met out of it, or that it will be, so to speak, ear marked for this purpose. The revenues of Persia are paid into a pool out of which Monsieur Naus al locates them at his convenience. The interest due to Russia may thus very likely be paid out of Bush- ire receipts and that due to us out of the receipts of the Caspian provinces or Tabriz. All these various sources of revenue are little rivulets flow ing into a large lake and so long as the Russians and ourselves as Persia's creditors get our bucket of water from the lake we cannot insist upon its be ing drawn from one affluent rather than from another The Russians have of course the advantage that if their water supply falls short they have a legal power to dam up and take possession of certain tribu taries, but so long as their coupon is paid they haveI nave no right/ to ask from what source the money comes, lu is for this reason that I have on previous occa sions ventured to argue that so long as the Gulf Cus toms is the real guarantee, the mention side fcy side with them of other merely nominal ones, as a conveni ent diplomatic fiction, is not a matter of any practi cal importance. This, however, is only a personal view which I restate in order to make rny own position clear. I have always, in obedience to Your Lordship's orders, stiongly impressed upon the Persian Government that the mention of the Gulf Customs as sole security was deemed by us essential to the completion of last year s advance. If they tax us v/ith excessive for- nulism, they expose themselves to the retort that their insistence upon v/edging into the contract notori ously bogus guarantees as coverers to the real one, for the mere sake of pretending to observe an agree ment with Russia, of which they are deliberately vio lating the spirit, is not merely pedantic but hypocri tical .The case is, however, different when it comes to requiring not only the Gulf Customs as a sole guarantee hut a formal definition such as that men tioned in Your Lordship's telegram of the 13th in stant of what is meant by them. This is an entire- t \ ly new condition and although it might very properly be attached to a new advance, I would respectfully ^plead that it may seem scarcely just to attach it. for the first time to trie completion of an earlier one in connection with which it has never before been mentioned. It is not as if this definition of the •Customs of Pars and the Persian Gulf* were a new question v/hich had come up since the advance of 1003. It .had formed the subject of discussion long before and it has never been introduced into any of the loan\negotiations; either that with the Imperi al Bank of 1001, or the abortive one at the time of the second Russian loan, or that of April 1003. I would, therefore, most earnestly deprecate its being brought'\in as a sort of afterthought into a transac- tion for a sum offered a year ago on easier terms.If His Majesty*s Government is dissatisfied with the reply of the Persian Government sent home in my des patch No.114 Confidential of June 20th, I would ask them to instruct me\to continue to fight the question on its own merits or, as I have) hitherto done, in con nection with the Reglement Douanier, and refuse to ac cept the latter till we get the definition which we want. But I should wish to he allowed to adhere to th&lt; statement made by me, with^Your Lordship s approv al, both to the present and late Grand Vizier,' namely that the only condition to the completion of the ad vance of 1903 was the assignation of the Southern Cus toms, mentioned asUiltimate security for the £200,000, as sole security for the remaining £100,000. The transaction may fall through, and the Persian Govern ment may get the money from Monsieur Grube, who would, I imagine, lend it to them, not indeed very willing ly, but in order to prevent our/doing so, just as he did the £80,000 to the Valiahd a few months ago. But at least they will have no pretext for reproaching us with .inconsistency or with a lack of strict adherence toto previous assurances. I fully realize the irritation which His Majes ty^ Government must feel at the tedious and evasive tactics by means of which this; weak Government has sought to shelter itself against a formal declara tion which might involve it in trouble 'with its dreaded Northern * neighbour. I would, however, sub mit that each successive step which we can take to wards breaking the financial control established by the Russian loan contracts is in itself a political gain and that the completion of the advance of last year is a stepping stone towards that end, useful as a base for a fresh attack on the position gained by Russia to our detriment. I had ‘some further conversation yesterday morn ing on the subject with Monsieur Nans. His Excel lency informed me that what the Ain-ed-Dowleh really wanted was an advance, not of £100,000, but of £300,000. His Highness proposed to apply the £100,000 to meeting the deficit which he anticipated might accrue this vear from a fall in the Customs receipts.ing £200,000 should be affected to the irrigation . ho .113 of June 18th 1904, the Persian Government de sired to undertake. Monsieur Naus suggested that the mains fertilized by them might be pledged as a subsi diary security for the additional advance and that this pledge might be coupled with an undertaking that restrictions on the export of grain from the Karun valley should be henceforth abolished. He thought the acquisition of such a guarantee might be one not altogether to be despised by His Majesty's Government. He admitted, in reply to an enquiry by me, that he might have a good deal of difficulty in bringing the Shah to accept an agreement on these lines, but he did not altogether despair of doing so. I said I thought the best thing I could do was to write fully to Your Lordship on the subject and that the first step seemed if only we could find a formula to reconcile the views to me to be the completion of the advance of last year fl I Ofof the two Governments. His Excellency quite agreed that this was the immediate object to be attained and that the question of a further loan secured on the Ka- run works and lands was a matter of remoter importance. He mentioned that the Ain-od-Dowleh had proposed to deal with a larger advance made on the ultimate secu rity of the Southern Customs, but with the inevitable and long since exhausted Caspian Fisheries introduced pro forma, by extending the term of repayments from 20 to 40 years, and providing that such repayment should not-take place at an earlier date without the consent of the British Government. I should look upon this extension as a further gain, since, although the Per sian Government do not seem to realize it, it would constitute a distinct violation by them of the clause in the Russian loan contracts prohibiting 'tout em- prunt a longue echeance* made without the consent of Russia, and would thus be a fresh nail in the coffin of those most objectionable and dangerous instruments. To sum up, what I would respectfully ask Your LordshipLordship to do is this: (1) to permit me to drop the new condition entailed in an insistence on the defini tion of Pars and the Persian Gulf and let me continue .the discussion of the latter question, which has al ready made definite progress, till it is settled in the sense desired by you, independently of any finan cial negotiations. To this I attach great importance and I beg Your Lordship to do me the honour of trust ing my local knowledge and judgment on the point. , (2) To let me do my best to frame, in aonjunction with Monsieur Nans, a formula for the completion of the ad vance which whilst giving you what you desire will en able it to be arranged with a minimum of difficulty. One way of doing this would be to add after Monsieur Nans’ words 'queries garanties affectees en vertu de •1’acte ci-dessus restent acquises an rernboursement 'de la dite somme de £290,000,* the words *mais qu’en *vue de 1*insuffisance des deux premieres garanties *y mentlonnees a couvrir la totalite de I’avance, la 'some de £100,000 qui la complete sera remboursee par 'le produit de la troisieme et derniere garantie' to whichwhich might he added, if absolutely necessary, the words B a savoir, les Douanes du Fars et du Golie Persique.* Other ways have occurred to me of get ting round the difficulty but it is premature to discuss them at the present stage. (3) I should like to be able to encourage the Ain-ed-Dowleh with the idea that His Majesty's Government is prepared to assist financially and thus acquire a finger in 'his Kanin irrigation projects. I have given Herr von Roggen, in compliance with a request to that ef fect from him, a letter of introduction to His Maj esty's Minister at the Hague whither he has just pro ceeded on leave. I feel sure that if we play the game judiciously and with patience we may still be able to utilize the financial needs of Persia as ad vantageously to our interests as our rivals have done from their own point of view in the past. Monsieur Nans informs me that the Customs of the Persian Gulf last year brought in after the pay ment of all expenses over £200,000. This year I understand that the Customs receipts of the entire KingdomKingdom have shown, during the last quarter, a diminu tion of £10,000 as compared with the corresponding period in 1903, so that if this decrease is maintained (and it is possible that with cholera and depression of trade it may even be augmented) the Customs revenue will be £40,000 short of that obtained last year. The falling off has been mainly imports from Russia, but also curiously enough in those from other coun tries via Bushire; the receipts of which port as com pared with the same period last year show a decrease of £24,000, On the other hand there has been a mark ed increase in Indian imports by the Seistan route and in goods other than Russian imported into Tabriz by way of Trebizonde.

Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—{Received July 11.) very absurdly and misleadingly describes though h weeks Gulahek, June 20, 1904. I HAVE read with interest Major Burton’s Report to the Government of India, published in Section 7 of the 28th Apiil of the Persia and Arabia Confidential Print, respecting the mission of the Dutch engineer, Herr von Roggen, to the Karun, together with that on the same subject by Mr. Carron Roberts. 1 ought, however, to warn your Lordship against the unqualified acceptance of any statements made by the latter writer, who can only be considered as somewhat of an adventurer. He came here on the advice of certain persons in England, who ought to have known better than to give it to him, with the object of obtaining a commission in the Persian Army, and when this failed, endeavoured to get employment in M. Nans’ Customs Administration. Eventually he was taken to Arabistan by Herr von Roggen, as a kind of secretary or assistant, in return, I understand, for the payment of a portion of his expenses, and they started together last October for Ahwaz. The party was completed by the Dutch Minister here, who took advantage of his countryman’s mission in order to see something of South-Western Persia, and whom Mr. Carron Roberts violent Russophil Anglophobe, may possibly have developed a pardonable attack of Anglophobia after some spent in intercourse with Mr. Roberts. The latter, though pleasant-mannered when he chooses, and both plausible and clever, does not seem to have been a very creditable specimen of the Briton abroad. I am told that he was frequently drunk at the club here, and intoxication is the only excuse for his behaviour to my Netherlands colleague, whom, in connection with some dispute between their servants, he grossly insulted on the journey, abusing him as a “ spy ” and a “damned Dutchman,” and demon stratively threatening to punch his head. When Herr von Roggen interposed to protect his Minister, Mr. Roberts turned on him and exclaimed, “ You’re another, or rather you’re a bloody Boer.” This terminated their official partnership, but Herr von Roggen, unwilling, as he put it to me, to leave a white man on his beam-end among the Arabs, took him with him to Mohammerah, whence he shipped to India, and has, I hear, obtained employment on the staff of an Indian newspaper. I should not have mentioned these vulgar and trivial incidents if Mr. Roberts had not sent in a report on affairs on the Karun which had been printed in an official paper, but I think it advisable under the circumstances to indicate the kind of person he is, in case he should pose, or be taken seriously in India, on the strength of his brief and scarcely brilliant career here, as an authority upon Persian politics. On his return to Tehran about six weeks ago Herr von Roggen paid me a visit, and was very enthusiastic about the future of Arabistan, if the Ahwaz dam and other works recommended by him could be taken up by a European Company. His view was that the political objections which the Persian Government might offer to such a proposal could be surmounted if the Company could be started in some small neutral country such as his own, and could then secure English capital and support. He was confident or being able to enlist the good-will of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, which he admitted to be indispensable to success, and I think that he underrated the many practical difficulties in the way of any enterprise of this nature under the conditions which at present prevail in Persia, and especially in the Province of Arabistan. I listened sympathetically to his statements, and was careful not to discourage him from speaking openly by any hint that his scheme might encounter political opposition on our side. Not long after this conversation Herr von Roggen was temporarily disabled by an attack of illness, and it was only a week ago that he was able to submit to the Shah the proposals of wdiich M, Naus, who wus present when they were laid before His Majesty, gave me the account summarized in my telegram No. 66 of the 8th instant. His Report estimates the cost of reconstructing the Ahwaz Dam and of the necessary preliminary irrigation works at 400,000/. (I give the English figures, so as not to trouble your Lord- ship with tomans), and proposes three alternative schemes: (1) that the work should be undertaken by the Persian Government; or (2) by a Persian; or (3)—and this is the [20-19 A-10]‘2 plan which he himself naturally favours—by a foreign international company to be floated j n Holland The Companies holding the Concession, or the Government if it undertook the task, would recoup themselves by renting to the Arab cultivators the lands which would be fertilized bv the irrigation works, and which he is convinced would in a few years vield so splendid a crop as to become the granary for the whole of the Persian Gulf, and perhaps also for other and more distant regions. , The Shah, so M. Nans informed me, was greatly attracted by the idea, but wa^ stron'-Iv opposed to giving any concession in connection with it to foreigners of whatever nationality. He expressed himself, however, as willing to order the work to be completed in a period' extending over ten years by the Persian Government (which would assign a yearly sum cf 40,000Z. for the purpose), and even to devote to it his own personal revenues as distinct from those of the State. . . 1 asked his Excellency how His Majesty proposed to find the money, and what was the amount of this “ personal revenue.” To the first question he ansvseied though I doubt whether he was icallv convinced of the teasihility or the plan that now that the deficit had been filled up under the more economic regime of the Ain-ed-Dowleh it mio’ht not be bevond that Minister’s ability to find a sum ot 40,000/. a-year for piu.ic works; and to the second that the Shah’s private treasure, which he believed to have been at his accession over 1,000,000/. (30,000,000 fr.), did not probably amount in cash excluding a mass ot pearls and jewels, to 50,000/., which would thus be absorbed, if devoted to the scheme, in about a year. His own idea seemed to he that it the Govern ment would really put some money into the work, and show itself in earnest about it, there were many wealthy Persian merchants who would be ready to join in it, but I cannot mvself feel much confidence in the readiness of such merchants to embark capital on a lar^e scale in anv enterprise in Persia, the profits of which are not in some way guaranteed by a foreign Power, or at least by the participation of s: areholders under foreign protection. , , , , , i i In the meantime I learn from the Nizam-es-Saltaneh that he has been approached by the Ain-ed-Dowleh and asked to give his opinion, as a former Governor-General of Arahistan, on the scheme proposed by Herr von Roggen, and to state at the same time whether he would be willing to undertake the supervision of the work on behalf of the Persian Government, should the latter decide to attempt it. The Dutch Minister tells me that he personally feels no confidence in the success of Herr von Roggen’s plans, whichever of them is ultimately adopted. He doubts whether a Company such as that proposed could be floated in Holland, and he says that, if he himself were consulted on the subject, he could not assume the responsibility of advising the investment of Dutch capital in such an undertaking. He has seen during a long residence in Persia one European enterprise after another fail, owing to the hopeless corruption and obstructionism of the Persian authorities, the w T ant of security and justice, and the impossibility of obtaining protection and redress. He added that Herr \on Roggen himself was'desirous, before actually initiating the work, of getting his proposals reviewed and reported on by other experts, and he asked me if His Majesty’s Government could be induced to take any interest in the scheme. I said that no suggestions had as yet been made to us, but that it the\ weie, 1 should certainly submit them to your Lordship, and that 1 believed that the\ would receive very careful consideration. It was obvious that any public works w hich could increase the productiveness of Arabistan and its exports to India and the Arab coasts of •j-j-jg p er sian Gulf would indirectly benefit Rritish trade, hut I bcdie\ed that we should strongly object to any grant of a Concession to foreigners, which could be utilized, as, for instance, by a sale of shares in it to the Russian Bank, in a manner injurious to our important interests in that region. He observed that he thought there was not the least likelihood of this. I have, &amp;e. (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARDINGE.DRAFT TELEGRAM. SECRETARY OF STATE Sent TO VICEROY.

Harding Vs telegram of the 22nd July, as to Persian Loan Reply of Persian Government to the Note regarding “ Fars and Gulf addressed to them by Sir A. Hardinge (vide his telegram of the 2§th June) has been received. Question will now be settled by Lord Lansdowne taking note of the admissions contained in the Persian reply, and making notification to the Persian Government as indicated in my telegram of the 2\st June. Uur view as to definition of security which should be named in the agreement for the advance of the remaining 100,000?. is materially altered by this develop ment Do you see any objection to advance being made, as proposed ^y Sir A. Hardingein his telegram of the 5th July, on the same security as m 1903/ I am disposed to agree to this, a n - «1 ‘ . KAm? irrigatiok. As regards the Karim Irrigation seh^se, T desinp to bring to the notice of the India Office a very important point. Any such scheme, if successfully carried out, will practically destroy the Tr emn as a navigable river, and will put an effectual stopper upon the enterprise of Messrs.lynch. Even now the depth of water is only 25 feet in many places, and the steamers run aground constant ly on their way up to Ahwas. A reduction of even 6 inches in the depth would block navigation for the 4 months from August to Hecomber. Our Indian exper ience in the Ihmjab has shown that large navigable rivers* such as the Jumna, Ravi, Ohennb, Sutlej and Jhelum, are drained quite dry for most of the year by big irrigation schemes, and I entertain little doubt1 doubt that this also would be the fhte of the ^arun. / H.M’s.Government must, therefore, balance the advantages to be derived from irrigation against the damage that will be inflicted upon British com merce. It is obvious that* if Messrs,Lynch are pushed out* and if their place is taken by Belgian officials and Butch engineers or concessionaires working a big irrigation project In r«**ely selfish or in anti British interests* we should be very greatly the losers by the change. On the other hand, if we had a substantial or preponderating voice in the control* we might be able to replace one form of commercial activity by another; and might open up another route for naviga tion to the plains of ^rabistan by utilising the ^©r IMsa or one of the adjoining inlets which we have recently explored* and by making new roads from thenee into the interior.i in any K a nm irrigation scheme, if it is to be started, but conversely also the striking danger to British interests that would result if we were left out of sight in any such enterprise. Perhaps the foreign Office might see a copy of this note, since the point of view must on no account be lost, and I know the Karon well from per sonal observation, (SO C,, 1st August, 1904-M y/Vo^tt ‘T Last year the Government of India and the Government at nome concurred m Idle view that to obtain a lien on the customs of the Gulf was of such importance as &lt;;o justify an immediate advance to the Persian Government oj $£300,000, if necessaryThe | Indian Government was to defray the expense and a cheque for the amount was drawn to the order of the Foreign Off 1 CQ • If the Persian Government applied for a further loan it ms agreed that it might he made conditional on the grant of o finer concessions * As a matter of fact the Foreign Office only used $£200,000; and it would appear that the authority given last year wauld jus ti fy them in comple ting the advance of jf300,000 o riginally sane Honed wi thou t fur the r reference to the Indian Government. On the other hand the Indian Government con tend } as I understand } that the original loan ought to have been made on the sole security of the Customs and not, as in fact it was made^primarily on the security of Caspian Fisheries and telegraph receipts and only secondarily on the customs. ItIt is unnecessary to discuss the grounds on which the decision of last year was arrived at. Even supposing that the Foreign Office exceeded their powers, it is obvious that the very fact that the customs dzci not and do not form the sole security for the loan already made by us is an additional argument for' a further advance for which the customs will necessarily jdm the sole security, as the other securities are already completely mortgaged. ^ But a new point has been raised in the interimp\ Namelyj what is the meaning of the terra n Customs of Fa^s and the Persian Gulj' n ? The Indian Government wi sh to obtain a clear and exp licit decl a ra t i on from the Persian Government that the phrase means the 'customs of Sou them Persia', and } in the absence of such declaration to withhold their assent from a further loan. Now I submit that the question of obtaining this definition has or- ought to have nothing to do with the question of the loan. Tie Persian Government has told Sir A. Hardinge that their view is the same as ours but that if the question was formally raised by Russia they see no alternative but to refert — ^Z-5 it to arbitration. We propose to reply that we take note of the fact that the Persian G-ovemwient agree with us in their in terpretation of the phrase used by them selve s^, ajid that if it is called in question hereafter we shall take steps to enforce our rights . Ifhat does this mean? If any of the 1200, OGO already loaned is secured on the Customs, we shall ^ 7 insist that that security covers all the ports of Southern Persia. Surely^hat contention will be strengthened rather than weakened by increasing the Amount so secured and prolonging the period of time within which no amortization is to be permit tea. , \ If we insist as a condition oj a further loan on obtaining an assurance which it is obvious the Persian Government will not give, we not only jail to strengthen our position but we actually weaken our ohm contention by shewing that we doubt whether we possess the security which we assert we do already possess . I suggest therefore that we should tell Harainge that we are willing to make the jurtner advance oj &lt;£100,000 on the security of the Customs ~ those customs being in our view, as we have alreadyinjonned the Persian Government and as we understand tine Persian Government to agree, the customs o f Sou thern Pe rsia - and that if necessary we shall take steps to enforce our rights should they he called in question And that we shall be prepared to consider the question of a furtheradvance on the security of the /damn irrigation works and lands when we are in the passession of mo re explici t info rmat ion about the proposal. i Hardinge has proved quite right in his view that the small loans mighty and probably would J lead to concessions of a valuable character j- and the last suggested might prove the means of finally earmarking and controlling the /damn valley in the interests of British trade, and a precedent for similar concessions i n th e future in the d i re c 1 1 on of Se i s tan .
