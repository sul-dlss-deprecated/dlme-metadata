The greatest proportion of this correspondence is from the Resident's native agents throughout the Persian Gulf at Bahrein [Bahrain], Lingah [Bandar-e-Lengeh], Muscat, Sharjah, and also from the News Writer at Shiraz. Most of the remaining correspondence is from various Chiefs/Governors/Shaikhs from across the Gulf, their relations, or subjects; leaders from Persia and Oman are the most heavily represented.Developments in Persia are a frequent inclusion in the correspondence, particularly with regard to news surrounding Shiraz, and the Government of Fars. Events surrounding the diplomatic rupture between the British and the Government of Bushire, and the temporary removal of the Residency to Karak [Khārk, Jazīreh-ye] in March 1839 are also included, along with subsequent efforts by the Persians to induce the Resident to return.Updates on the situation in Nejde [Najd] can also be found within. These cover the defeat of Ameer Fysul [Amīr Fayṣul] by Koorshid Pacha [Khūrshid Pāshā], the Commander of Egyptian Forces in Nejde, and the subsequent establishment of Ameer Khalid bin Soud [Amīr Khālid bin Sa'ud] as the Governor of that province. It therefore also includes reports on the Commander's efforts to induce the submission of Shaikh Abdulla bin Ahmed [Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Aḥmad Āl Khalīfah], Chief of Bahrein, to Egypt; he claims that the island is a tributary of Nejde. This includes the further efforts of his agent, Mahomed bin Muttuk, to secure the submission of the various Arab tribes in Oman; a move requiring the occupation of Braymee, held by the Naim tribe which is hostile to Egyptian expansion. As a result, accusations of collusion with this agent — made by the Arab Chiefs against each other — can also be found within; the main belligerents being Shaikh Sultan bin Suggur [Sulṭān bin Saqr], Chief of the Joasmees [Qāsimī]; and Shaikh Kuleefa bin Shakboot [Khalīfah bin Shakhbūṭ], Chief of the Beniyas.The conflict between Esa bin Tareef [‘Isá bin Ṭarīf] of the Al Ali tribe with the Chief of Bahrein is also featured to an extent, along with the abandonment of the Al Ali by the Chief of Beniyas, as a result of the increasing threat from Egyptian forces from Nejde.The correspondence also includes material of a more routine nature, such as the relaying of letters and packets, to reports on the movements of British ships. It also includes reports relating to the restitution of property plundered at sea.Please note that Bahrein is also spelt Bharein, and Shiraz is also spelt Sheeraz within the volume.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter book</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Governor of Bushire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Prince-Governor of Fārs, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shah of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Lingah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Abu Dhabi, Āl Nahyān dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ra's al-Khaymah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Newswriter at Shiraz</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commander-in-Chief of Egyptian Forces in Central Arabia</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrein</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Nejde</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Braymee</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Imperial rivalry</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000034#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
