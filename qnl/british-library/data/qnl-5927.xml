Bagdad. (423/7/33) 22nd .December, 1933. Sir, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a note hy the late British Ins^ector-Senera! of Agriculture on certain aspects of the Iraai 'Law Governing the xdghts and Luties of Cultivators' which was wx enacted on June 14th last and came into force on October 1st, three months after its publication in the Arabic Offic ial o-azette. * L his note was handed to me Dy kr. Webster shortly before his final departure from Iraq ana represents the views which he himself originally laid before the Iraqi authorities in 1950 at the time when the first draft of the Law was unaer consideration. 2 . A translation of the Law appeared in No. 31 of July 30th of the English 'Iraqi Government Gazette', copies of which ar forwarded regularly by His Majesty's Emoassy to the Foreign Offi c e ibrary. For convenience of reference, however, I enclose herein an extract from the Gazette containing the full t 3 xt of the Law. 3. The origins of the 'Law Governing the Bights and -Duties of Cultivators' go back to 1929, when a draft was prepared by the joint efforts of a number of prominent Iriqi/ J -he Bight Honourable Dir John Simon, G.O.S.I., K.C.V.O., etc., etc., etc.# * Irani politicians, including the then Irime Linister ana iasin^al hashimi, who were interested in large- scale pump cultivation. The adviser to the Linistry of the Interior described the draft in a memorandum to the High Commission of January 27th, 1930 as baaly arranged and on the whole objectionable, aespite some goca points, since would impose on the fellaheen a relationship with their employers not far removed from serfdom. moreover, it proposea to apply to the whole ox Iran an organisation isspir-a by experience of pump cultivation in the joagdad and hut Liwas. bir Kinahan Cornwallis endeavoured to being the minister of Interior rouna to his view and even produced an alternative draft law to regularise the positron and rights of pump owners without depressing theyhtatus of the fellaheen and incurring the risk of agrarian unrest. The Cabinet persisted, however, in their attempt to being the draft law before Parliament and this project was only delayed by a communication from the High Commission to the Min istry of the Interior objecting to the terms of the prop posed law on the grounds (l) that it would prejudice the recommendations on land tenure which were then expected i from Cir Ernest howson as a result of his special enquiry (2) that one of its articles (providing for unpaid labour) appeared to constitute a breach of the International Slavery Convention to which Iraa had adhered; and (3) that the local authorities ixxxxaxixxxtXKg in the Liwas had not been consulted in its drafting. Wo more was heard of this first draft and the promoters of the Law made no further move in/the matter until the termination of the mandatory regime, when/when a new and more comprehensive dratt was produced and hurried throigh Parliament. 4. You will observe from the enclosed copy of his note that iiur. wehster, the former Insnector-G-eneral of Agriculture, criticises the Law severly and anticipate trouble among the fellaheen if should ever be put into general operation. on the other hand hir Kina- han Cornwallis informs me that some of the most objectionable features of the original draft do not figure in the law as finally enacted. ne agrees with hi» ester that the Law is essentially an instrument created by a small class to serve their own ends, but he does not think that it is likely to provoke serious unrest, especially as the Law auuears incapable of universal application throughout Iraw and is unlikely to be enforced in districts where the interests of its urometers uo not require it. 5. oir Kinahan Cornwallis prefers to keep his detailed comments enthe Law until it has been in opera ticn for a sufficient period to show how it is working in uractice. In view of' the political consequences which may follow from the enforcement of this Law I shall not fail to communicate to you the further 0 expression of his views, with which he Adviser has promised to furnish me in due course. I have, etc., (signed) -F.H.Humphrys.m l c 7 Enclosure in Bagdad Despatch No. 807 of 22.12.32• Note on '•Law Governing the Lights and Duties of Cultivators No. 28 of 1933.* There is no doubt that the non-success of a great many new agricultural ventures in recent years has been due, in part, to the difficulties experienced by the 'Farm owner' in establishing control ever the 'La^mah' holders and their fellaheen. Lor better of worse, the greater part oi these newcomers into agriculture have been active politicians, and it was inevitable that they should seek some legal remedy for their troubles. They have been^ranted very extensive tracts of valu able government land, not only without paymentj but also with revenue privileges, provided oily that they undertook to exploit such lands. The terms 'development and ex ploitation' have oeen universally interpreted as meaning only, the erection of a pump and engine for irrigation purposes, and a subsequent attempt to farm the lands using the 'Lazmah' holder and his fellaheen as the basis of their labour suppjy, and following the customary share-system of farming as almost universally practised by existing 'Tapu' holders. Naturally friction followed^ for the 'La^mah' holders regarded the new pump owner as a mere otusider who supplied water against payment (by crop-share), and themselves as the proprietors of the land and as the sole agricultural authority. c onversely — rwm 6 Conversely the pump-owner regarded himself as the proprifetor and farmer, and the la^mah holder as his employee# Ihis Jatter position has now been legalised* It must be remembered that, though the haw under commend deals with 411 Agriculture, yet it wa_s really occasioned only by this special (and new) type of agriculture practice. The only reaso*v that seems to have been admitted, in the 1 arming of the Law, for the numerous failures of new enterprise^, is the difficulty experienced in the control of 'seracil' and *fellkheen*. There are, however, manj other causes equally potent# Among these may be mentioned :- (a) The sudden slump in Agricultural prices* (b) The prevalent belief that agriculture is a part time occoupation necessitating olvly infrequent visits to tne farm, and easily combined with other business or politictil activity* (c) i he frequent complete lack of any real agricultural knowledge or experience on the part of the pump-owner* (d) A he disproportion between the area to be developed and the capital available. (e) An irrational expectation that capital disbursed would be recovered in a year or two years* working (most engines and pumps were bought on credit with H compialas* (instalment payments) falling due at the first harvest)* A he new Law cheerfully ignores all these issues, and con- concentrates7 concentrates on the rights of the Farm-owner, and the duties of the Fellaheen* he farm-owner| new becomes the agricultural authority (Article 3), and unfitted though he may be, gives his orders for sowing, irrigat ana harvesting, orders which the fellah is obliged under severe penalties to carry out (Article 18). All advances madeto the fellah, a.ll charges IkbuxjeI incurred by the farm owner, are to be regarded as an ’’Agricultural -uebt* recoverable from the fellah (^rticlelO)* *Jhe se charges and these advances will be incurred whether the venture is a success or not, but if even by bad farming and bad direction on the part of the farm owner, a loss is incurred, then that loss becomes the fellah’s debt to the farm owner. So long as such a debt exists he is legally incapacitated from seeking employment on either a more successful farm , or in u^vernment departmental Servic e or in Municipalities or Registered Companies (Article 15). that Article II (a) admits, in a naive manner, kak it Is more or less expected that the fellah will be permanently indebted, and allows him a remission from his debt of the valu e of t he seed only for any crop destroyed by a natural calamity. under Article 13, an indebted fellah may have even his plough and plough animals confiscated, unless he continues to work on the same estate,, T he valuable, though somewhat vaguejri rights in Land known as ’’Laiimah” seem to be completely neglected, except in Article 49 (4). which lays down that an gxx&amp;fel evicted fellah if he be a 'Lazmah* holder snail still rave etictiirr 1 right in th iand ’ and in ^ m 8 to local ciltom”!' 41 ** 3 * 1 m&amp;y stui u se that right according theoreticallyf &amp; Theoritically the fellah has certain rights which are to be safeguarded, but when one considers the relative positions of the two parties, should a dispute be laid before a Mudir Nahiya or a Q,aimmaqam Q,adh^, one is obliged to regard the fellah’s rights as theoritical only* Practically every disaster that can occur to a crip, damtge by flood, damage by locusts, etc*, etc*, can be (and most freqentlt/is) attributed to the negligence of the fellah, and Articles 6 (d) and 9 (c) are particularly dangerous when read in conjunction with Article 18* I would again insist that the necessity for such a law only became felt when a new, and largely unqualified type of person undertook Argicultural -Je\ elopment • The Old i'apu ownere ancythe trifeal sheikhs never felt such a necearsrity and were able to conduct similar enterprised chiefly on the basis of M customs'* 1 he share of the fellah is such that unless he has his ’’customary’’ perquisites, such as free grazing for a goat pr two, free firewood, a certain amount of free vegetables, arid a certain amount of stolen produce, it is doubtful if he could, exist* ihe old type 'farm owner' accepted this, cursed his fellaheen for a set of reacally thieves, but winked at their 'stealing in reason” J-he new ti^pe of agriculturalist, whilst doing nothing . , . ^ refuses to ameliorate kiuuEX the conditions of t he fellah, xggxxs* to tolerate these 'customs', and has provided ( /i rticle49) dire pains and penalties oi which the oild tqpe farmer m^' take advantage if he so desires. j. si*ou±d regard with very considerable misgiving any attempt to implement generally this law* naturally the fellaheen are, as yet, unaware of its existence* When it begines to be applied it will be looked upon at f.rst as 'local injustice', tut incourse cft k f, of t^ime it will come to be understood, and might easily sx lead to serious trouble. the system which the Lav/ attemptsjto set up has many points of resemblance with the feudal Systeme When a feudal cheifs are acceptable (old i'apu estates and Tribal agriculture) it may possible work, $ but feudal chiefs need mor« discrimanate selection than was exercised wnen the State lands were handed over to pump- owners for development. In times of agricultural depression, or ir/the hands of an uKek^lful farmer, the fellah under the provisions of the present law, is doomed to perpetual indebtedness, and since he cannot leave the land, he is, in reality, reduced to the statu® of a slave. Such a stat£ of affairs is almost inevitable followed, sooner or later, by revolution.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00008e_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/5/163</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00008e</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/5/163</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 2/10 Iraq law governing the rights and duties of cultivators'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1933/1933</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-02-20T11:25:20</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (11 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 13; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

The documents are a covering letter from the British Embassy in Baghdad that introduces a more extensive commentary on the new law as an attached second document.Together, the two documents spell out British objections to the passage of the law on various technical and political grounds. Specifically, the second document recounts British concerns on the legalisation of what British observers describe as a form of slavery. The details of the new law are spelled out, along with its beneficiaries and those whose interests the law will harm. The rationale for objecting to the law revolves around preventing revolt among the actual cultivators of areas to be brought under new agricultural methods with the new law.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Land reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Customary law</topic></subject><subject><topic>Agricultural labour</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Social conflicts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Irrigation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00008e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
