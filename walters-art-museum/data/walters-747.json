The workmanship is good and the piece is carefully made.\r\n\r\nThe scarab functioned as a provider individualized amulet, and was originally mounted or threaded. The amulet should provide the support of Amun/Re and secure the life of its owner. \r\n\r\nThere are many combinations of mottos, wishes, or just the name of the sun god. The addition of the sun disc verifies, in this case, that the sun god is represented and not Horus.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1929", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/32184", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1929 [mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "21st-22nd Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2009-09-11T09:35:05.56", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.57_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.57_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.57_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.57_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.57_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "CUR_42.57_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.57_Bot_DD_design_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.57_Bot_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.57_Rt_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.57_VwA_DD_hieroglyphictext_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.57_VwA_DD_TranscriptionRS2009.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
