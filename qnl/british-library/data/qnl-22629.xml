His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, The Agency, Manaraa, Bahr ei n. Dear Sir^, The Bahrein Petroleum uompany Limited and California Arabian Standard Oil Company have agreed to construct an oil pipe line from the coast of Saudi Arabia to the refinery of the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited in Bahrein (the approx imate route of the pipe line is indicated on the attached sketch), provided that the critical materials required for the project can be obtained from the United States. The necessary application for the critical materials has been filed with the appropriate agencies of the United States Government in Washington, D.G. The transportation of the crude oil from Saudi Arabia to supplement the crude production in Bahrein so as to ensure the continuous operation of the Bahrein refinery to the required capacity is a matter of critical importance, and especially so during the present world conflict. As you know the Bahrein refinery is being enlarged so that increasing amounts of crude oil will be required to be transported to Bahrein. Moreover varying amounts of crude oil may be demanded on short notice to meet the rapidly changing requirements during the present conflict. Under such conditions the proposed pipe line is the most practicable solution of the transportation problem. Accordingly, if the pending application to the United States authorities is approved, so that the critical materials for the proposed pipe line can be obtained, this Company and California Arabian Standard Oil Company propose to employ the same contractor to construct the pipe line, with the understanding that the expense involved will be shared by the two Companies, and with the further understanding that the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited will own that portion of the pipe line lying within the area covered by its Mining Lease and California Arabian Standard Oil Company will own that portion of the pipe line lying within the area covered by its concession. /H.B.M's Political Agent Bahrein. 5rd February* 1944 The route of the proposed pipe line, as indicated on the attached sketch, has been selected not only from the viewpoint of the shortest distance so as to use the least amount of critical materials but also from the viewpoint of constructing the pipe line over uncultivated lands which the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited now has the right to occupy; if, however, the pipe line should cross any lands for which the said Company is required to pay compensation the Company is prepared to pay such compensation. The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited is taking the liberty of supplying the India Office of His Majesty's Government in London with several copies of this letter and attached sketch, in order that all interested parties may be informed of the proposed project with the least delay. California Arabian Standard Oil Company also informs us that it is conveying similar infomation to the Government of Saudi Arabia. If there is any further information we can give in connection with the proposed pipe line we shall be glad to do so. Yours ver W. P.

Bahrain, the 5th February 1944, From To Sir, \ \ Major T.Hickinbotham, C.I«E«, O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter No.C/^PA-^l dated the 3rd February 1944-which I have received from the Chief Local Representative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. 2. I understand that this matter has been under consideration for some time but the enclosed communication is the first indi cation which I have r eceived that agreement has been reached between the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. Provided the pipeline lies within the Bahrain Petroleum Company's leased area I can see no objection to the proposal, but I have not had time to study my records and discover whether any mention of this project has occurred before • As the matter is of some urgency and as the mail is due to leave to-morrow morning I am not delaying these papers to do so. 3# Provided you see no objection T propose to acquaint the Bahrain Government with this proposal and suggest that their Land Department should examine the route to be followed by the pipeline with a view to determining whether or not it is in fact upon land lying within the Concession area. Will you please inform me telegraphically if you approve of the action proposed ?

It was expected that plant would be' operating witnin 24 months. The reported indications that Saudi Arabian Government wish to exact large royalty ties from the Company or a greater participation in exploration of fields more or less on same scale as Iraq Government enjoy in respect of fraq fields. Subsequently Saudi Arabian Government informed His ajesty s Minister that Casoc proposed also to construct oil J me from Dhahran to a point on the Shaikh oil line to be the property of the United States Government. Apparently latter made announcement covering ? their intentions before' communicating them to the Saudi Arabian Government. This action created bad impression locally and according to the Saudi Arabian Government intention to resist any political control or interference by the United States Government in Saudi Arabian affairs. ^ , Ohliger was granted permission to fly to Riyadh to deliver letter to Ibn Saud.

(c) They informed Ibn Saud that United States Government wished construction of a pipe line from Dhahran to » Meditecranean but they had no information of route to be followed nor whether so far would be undertaken by United States Government or Company. Ibn Saud replied that construction of this line would appear to be in best interests of Saudi Arabian Government but that he must withhold Company's finality of scheme until he had been supplied with full details. 2, Presumably the Company's Representative also mentioned construction of new refinery other than (? mute) as reported above. - RETAXANDUM - HWD, Hf.:- /Sr 2- HTelegram From Political Resident, Bushire.

Also the bearing of the R/w extending westward has been changed slightly. The change in the right-of-way has been very slight and was done to keep to a minimum the right-of-way requirements where it passes close to a settled .area south of the, village of Buri. &gt;5.^' S'W Please refer to ^tfSelgrave 1 s let^r N0.233/12C to you of the 11th of April, 1944'a copy of whicl/you kindly transmitted with your letter No.C/647 of April 19th.

The mariiers consist of pipes embedded in concrete bases. If the Superintendent of the Land Department so desires he may view the particular point at which the slight ciiange has been made; however, this may be unnecessary as the attached revised drawing indicatss the small extent of the change made from the original plan.

RESERVATION GR/22 File: 101.2? 2$ Please refer to our letter C/PA-132 of May 24, 1944 to which was attached three copies of our Map BRA-1553 - Revision 1 giving a detail survey of the proposed right-of-way necessary for the installation of our 12 inch pipe line. * We attach to this letter three prints of Drawing BRA - 1553 5 Revision 2. Revision 2 covers a slight change in the pro posed right-of-way just south-east of the town of Buri. We are proceeding with the right-of-way in accordance with Revision 2 as this particular section of ground is undoubtedly State land. Our reason for this revision is that as originally contemplated the right-of-way crosses a large burial ground in this particular section and rather than do the huge amount of earth work removal to level the right-of-way in this area and also because of the historical significance that may be attached to such mounds, we deemed it advisable to skirt around the northern edge as shown in our Drawing BRA-1553-2. Will you please substitute the attached Drawing covering Revision 2 for previous Drawings submitted to your office. We are proceeding with leveling operations and stringing pipe along the right-of-way although we have not yet received formal approval from your office. If there are any objections to us proceeding in this manner until formal approval has been received please advise. W. P.

File 101.27 Dear Sir, With reference to our previous correspondence on this subject, permanent boundry markers have been set up on each side of the reservation. The markers consist of a 2' pipe set in concrete and marked u GR/22 n ; they are situated so that one can be seen from another except in the 50 foot wide section near the village of Buri, where they are 300 feet apart. ?/here the markers come in close enough to a roadway to make them a hazard, they have been cut off at ground level. We are enclosing three copies of Revised Drawing BRA-1553-3 and three copies of the Description marked Revision 3. You will note that during the construction of the pipeline the former route through the burial mounds at Buri was reverted to, rather than making the detour as advised in our letter No. C/PA-168 dated August 21st, 194-4-. The final Reservation, therefore./requested by the Company is as shown and described on the [enclosed Drawing and Description. '7? W. P.

His Britannic Majesty 1 s political Agent, The Agency, File 07o.f' MANAMA, Bahrain Island. Dear Sir, Please refer to your memorandum No. C/482 dated 24th April, 1947 regarding the construction of a new 12' pipe line adjecent and p arallel to the 12 n Arabian crude pipeline constructed in 1944/1945, from the shore near the village of Budeya zo the Company's refinery. I confirm that the Company's new pipeline is laid within the limits of the reserved area approved by the Bahrain Government in their letter No. 729 dated 14th November, 1944, which was transmitted to the Company under your letter No. C/1695 of the 25th November, 1944. The road constructed by the Company when laying the original 12' pipeline was not wholely within the reserved area mentioned above because of topographical considerations. However, as the Bahrein Government in gicing its aDproval stipi^ated that the road must be considered a public thoroughfare, and furhter that the Company has the right under the original lease dated 29th December, 1934, as 0 amended by the Supplemental Deed of the 3rd June, 1936 and the Deed of Further Modification of 19th^June, 1940, to construct roads within the SheiKh's dominion as may be necessary for the purpose of its business, the Company^ considers that it was not mandatory that the road be within the area reserved for the pipeline. % The original road is not being abandoned but is being repaired and placed in usable condition after the construction of the new line. The Company estimates that approximately 95 per cent of the old road is being retained, however, there are a few locations where it was necessary to deviate from the (bid road because of encroachment by the new pipeline. I would appreciate further advice from you if you find that the above programme is not entirely satis factory with the Bahrein Government. Youfs very truly, (SGD) R.K.BRC'm.
