The intention was that these facilities would be used by aircraft of the Royal Air Force (RAF) or Imperial Airways in the event of an emergency. It further covers measures to be taken to prevent the intrusion of British aircraft into Saudi territory during the progress of negotiations.Also briefly covered in the file is a visit by Ibn Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] to the Netherlands in 1935 (see folios 26-71) and the attitude of the Saudis to foreign aircraft flying over their territory (see folios 3-21).The main correspondents are as follows: HM Minister at Jeddah (Sir Andrew Ryan), officials of the Foreign Office (mainly George William Rendel), and officials of the Air Ministry (mainly James Stirling Ross). The negotiations are primarily undertaken through Fuad Bey Hamza and Shaikh Yusuf Yasin.Prior to 1932, Saudi Arabia was known as the Kingdoms of Hejaz and Nejd, and this is reflected in the file.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Airways</topic></subject><subject><topic>Landing grounds</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hasa</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Aerial navigation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001e5#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001e5#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
