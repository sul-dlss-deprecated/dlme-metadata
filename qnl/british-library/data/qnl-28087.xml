Arrival of new German Minister may have contributed to this as well as the readiness with which Germans accept orders for goods to be delivered to Iran with the assurance that the war will be over soon. Russian advance in Finland is depressing to Iranian Government who are probably being reminded by the Germans that our friends are all meeting with disaster. This feeling may have made them more accommodating in their commercial negotiations with Russia which are believed to be nearing a conclusion. Repeated to M.I.C.E.

The Minister unexpect edly gave the Mill Gary Attache complete figures of all ki j j.as of aircraft in Iran and then asked for help in securing aircraft from the United Kingdom which were needed by the spring lor defence of Iran though it might ’already be too late. The Minister said that he had instructed Colonel Shaibani to oraer thirty ' v eilin; ton bombers and thirty Blenheim or Beaufort bombers. Could delivery be expedited? The Minister agreed that Iran needed fighters and said that thirty Curtiss machines would probably be bought in the United States while Colonel Shaibani had been instructed to try to secure twenty Hurricanes in addition to fifteen promised by His Majesty’s Government, The Minister indicated that Italian machines would probably not be bought because of financial difficulties and of technical objection to the introduction of another type of aircraft. fMen the Military Attache suggested the need for a larger proportion of fighters the Minister agreed,, but insisted on the necessity to carry the war into the enemy camp and expressed readiness to sacrifice half of the bombing strength of Iran in order to destroy or damage Baku. In conclusion the Minister speaking vei.y pcrsonaTln 7 ' and in confidence said that he thought it was time for ‘‘us'’ to co-ominate plans as we had one same end in view. He could not say this to the Shah and has suggested ! ]3. suggested it could only come through diplomatic channels. The Military Attache was very guarded on this point. No action will be taken on the suggestion about co-ordination of plans which could hardly have been made without the Shah's instructions. The rest of the Minister for War's communication is an interesting indication of the Iranian Government's forecast of Soviet action in the spring and of their probably unjustified belief that their Air Force could do serious damage to Baku. Repeated to M.I.C.N. Cairo No. 4 Government of India No. 12.Dear Baggallay 22ru&amp; January 1940. Thanlc you for your letter of 20th January. 'The guest ion of how far we can supply the Iran requirement a will be considered at the next meeting of the Supply 3ub-0ormittee of the Allied Demands Committee which should meet soon. In view of the nature of Cheytmnl*e list we cannot be vr ry optimistic about supply from here unless you and the Chljfs of Staff think that Iran should be put higher on the priority list because of the Russian danger. As regards supply from Franc©. There le no reason why goods bought in France should not be included under toe credit provided that the Treasury do not object. A very small change in wording, such as we have in the Iraqi Agreement, would suffice. But perhaps we should defer consideration of this question until we know what the French can supply. I am sending goples of this to Cook at the Treasury; Jarrett at the Admiralty; Tuckey at the war Office; Bateman at the Air Ministry; Forter at the Off 1 oca of the War Cabinet and ibson at the India Office.(E 232/232/34 )o The Persian Charge a'Affaires called here on the 15th January accompanied by the Military Attache, Colonel Cheybani, to discuss the question of the supnly of arms to Persist Mo Nabil and Colonel Cheybani exnressed the hope that it would be possible for His Majesty's Government to give them at a very early date a reply to the enquiries which Colonel Cheybani had recently made of the War Office with regard to the purchase of arms, etc&lt;&gt;, in this countryo The enquiries had taken the form of a communication of a list of military equipment of various kinds (see Allied Demands Committee paper No, A*D„ (40)3.) They pointed out that their requirements amounted in all to a value/ H. Somervi 11 e-Smith, Esq., D.S.Oo, O.B.E. Export Credits Guarantee DepartmentsValUe 0f Some £5,000,000.

Nabil, the fact that His Majesty's Government had been able to offer credits for £5,000,000 did not mean that they could supoly any Particular item of military equipnent which the Persian Government might acquire with those credits. I knew in tus case the War Office would do their utmost S ve an early reply, but warned them that it might frot&gt; he possible to maVp rjp-p-iim-i + aKe promises now ss to what might be done in the future. They said they quite understood this, but nevertheless pressed for an earl* reoly, so that the Persian Government should know where they stood. Colonel Cheybani added jokingly, the Persian Government could well afford to wait if His Majesty's Government could assure them that the Soviet Government were going to wait too.5o Colonel Cheybani added that a number of the items on the list he had given to the War Office were items which could, as a matter of fact only be supplied from Prance. He would have to get into touch with the French military authorities in due course, but wondered whether it would be possible for him to have a preliminary conversation with some member of the French Liaison Mission in London. I said I thought it might be possible to arrange this, and subsequently, after consulting Gorell-^Barnes at Gwydyr House, I write to Me Nabil suggesting that Colonel Cheybani should approach Lieutenant-Colonel Rene Mayer of the Mission du Ministers de l f Armament hereo 6 ’ ^ not get the list of material before me during this conversation. On looking it over since I see that most of the arms are Frencho It rather looks as though the Persian Government were half-expecting us to agree that they may use our credits to pay for orders placed in Franceo I am afraid that I am not myself/myself clear whether this weald regard to the terms trader which fte remissible the credit was having granted or desirable even after our recent agreements with tho French Government, and should be grateful for your views 7 ° 1 am sending copies of this letter to Ceok at the Treasury; Jarrett at the Admiralty; Tuckey at the War Office; Bateman at the Air Ministry; Porter at the Offices of the War Cabinet; and Gibson at the India Officeo Yjurs sincerely,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT PERSIA.

I HAY E the honour to report that, according to information supplied by the Belgian Minister at Tehran, the Iranian Government have recently concluded a contract for the purchase of 200,000 rifles and 500,000 rounds of small arms ammunition from Czechoslovakia. I presume this purchase must have been made from the Skoda factory. . 2. The counsellor to His Majesty’s Legation, to whom this information was given, gathered that the terms of the contract were severe, namely 184,000 United States dollars down, and the remainder (the sum was not stated) on delivery. It appears, if this information is correct, that the Skoda firm have cut out a Belgian firm, as they did in 1936 over a similar order for 200,000 rifles. M. Braeffe said that we were paying for the rifles, referring no doubt to Anglo-Iranian Oil Com pany royalties. 3. He also said that Colonel Bever was impressed by the aircraft factory outlay—tools included. The Iranian Government wanted to renew Colonel Bever’s contract for another year, but there might be some difficulty as it was time that Colonel Bever took an active command in the Belgian army.

We have now brought this up-to-date and I enclose a copy in case it may interest you. Would you destroy the previous Summary? I should be very grateful for any comments you may have both on our information, which we realize is incomplete, and on the conclusions we have drawn. J.C.Walton, Esq., C,B.,M.C., India Office, London, S.W.l.attached is intended to replace that issued up to January 1935. 8 . 'Sals revise includes info rasa tion contained in the previous Summary and further information which became available last year. 3* Paragraphs on aircraft purchases have been omittedj as such information is being dealt with by the Air Ministry. 4. For easy reference a table is attached as an Appendix, showing the totals of arms and equipment purchased or on order. 5. the following points are of particular interest*- (a) Since the probable delivery of 50,000 rifles from Japan, the total number in hand would seem to be much in excess of requirements even if it is decided to ■ increase the army to 100,000 and to re-arm the gendarmerie (b) ihere seems to be an unnecessarily large number of light automatics in hand. It is estimated that 3,000 would be sufficient to equip light tanks and the infantry units of seven divisions on a generous scale, allowing for an ample reserve stock. (a) there is confirmation of negotiations for 100 batteries field and 100 batteries mountain artillery (referred to in the previous Summary) j in this connection the policy of the Shah remains a mystery, especially as equipments are to be supplied without essential components! (d) So far no information has been received as to how the additional field howitzers are to be drawn. It was aasumad that field batterias ware to be mechanised, but tna traotor. In hand are hardly sufflolant for raora than two batteriesi and there is no evidence of additional orders.

(e) Baoh Medium tank is to be equipped with one gun and two heary machine guns. Ugbt tank, are to be armed with light automatics similar to those at present in use in the Iranian Army*(£) H Is •rldent that the shah is anxious for the above orders to be oorapieted and is pressing for delivery by September 1956. .gunge jn iokn aaj 1935, there ia a telegram asking for the date of shipment of three 47-mm a/*, guns, and a later toJ.asram says that a calibre of between 47 and 48-mm guns guohx as is used In the Swiss Army has been selected for A/T* guns.Mountain (hinn &gt; • (a) Between the latter part of 193S aj,d february 1835 thirty 4-gun batteries were delivered from Bofors (Streden) .

Field Guns and Howltsers. (a) During the latter half of 1954 and the first half of 1955 the following were delivered from Skoda*- Three 4-gun 105-iam. gun batteries. Weight# including carriage# 2 # 500 kgs. These are tractor-drawn. Five 4-gun 105-mm* howitzer batteries. It is not certain how these batteries are to be drawn# but there are indications that they are to be horse-drawn. (b) On 17th February 1933, an order was siren tor an additional seven 105-mm* howitzer batteries. Of these# two batteries were shipped in December 1935* It appears that the remainder will be complete by July 1936. &lt;e) There has been some indication of 155-mm. howitzer batteries being ordered# but there is nothing to confirm fch fact that orders for such have been placed.*» Qm Fir a control gear for the second batch of 10 batteries ordered from France and ^armany.

(e) inquiries have been made from Schneider for 75 -mm. field guns $ model 1928* An order may have been placed for 2 or 3 guns. (f) Before has the following on order:** One 37-ram. infantry gun. (g) On the 10th Jamary 1935, orders were given by the Shah for negotiations with Skoda and Bofors for 100 mountain batteries and 100 field batteries without ammunition or equipment• Payment was to be arranged over three years, even if delivery could be completed in two years. Negotiations have evidently proved satisfactory. On 21st February 1936, instructions were issued from Tehran for an order to be placed with Skoda 1 s for fifty 105-mm. howitser batteries, without gun carriages or accessories. 7. A .A. Duns. (a) Four 4 -gun batteries were ordered in 1934, but only two batteries of this order appear to have been delivered. Calibres 7 5 -mm; with Gamma fire direction devices and mechanical time fuses.

(C Many thanks for your letter of the 4th December (P.2. 7629/33). We had not included the so-called navy, which you mention in your para 2, as we were dealing primarily with armaments which could be used on land. We were, ho?rever, unaware of the new construction programme which you mention and which is very interesting. Reference your para 3, we wrote to ootn the Poreicrn Office and the Air Ministry on the same lines but did not include the Admiralty. re propose however, sending them the final copy of our conclusions as tne result of all the answers to our ^etter. / Owing to the very secret sources from which this information'has ^een culled we are very anxious to ^ restrict the circulation of copies^to the ^ ^ Qener . al sfaS India/we 'shoul/prefer ^J^frath^than that pother should be made and distributed. rj , Hslo^ H ^ , - G -Mr. Lait l S H- i' ¥ 2 ** k 7 * ^ cU^fK l lUaam^ ^ I have made a small pencil addition to your draft reply to Colonel Ismay. I am very glad you have referred to Persia’s naval aspirations as from our point of view they are more important than her military preparations. The latter are directed chiefly against her own people and her immediate neighbours, whereas the former are really against our influence and interests in the Persian Gulf. Generally speaking, I think we must always bear in mind certain factors when considering Persia’s present developments. Firstly, it is in my opinion a one man show entirely. I don’t fancy that the Persian character or capabilities hafeundergone any great change in the Iasi jL^ hundred years. The Persians as a whole are slack, venal, and not really warlike. Under the spur of men like^hadir Shah and the present Reza Khan of whom by the way were or are Persians) they have achieved a certain amount, but once the strong hand was removed they sunk back again into their usual sloth and curruption .ous Secondly, who is going; to pay for all these very expensive armaments which Persia has ordered and is ordering? HerHer only real stable wwwreertu* revenue is what she gets from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and that can't go ver. far leally. If she is buying on credit,these foreign firms will so-..in xind themselves as badly let in as were those who had dealings with Amanullah. ihirdly, the mere possession of armaments does not necessarily mean mili'Gary strength. All these highly technical appliances are of little value unless the best can be got out of them. Also, the most potent factor of all is the man behind the gun. I have not noticed anywhere that the Persian Army is considered either highly trained or high in morale. Fourthly, the tendency in all oriental countries is A&amp;v ^ir * i ^ to buy a lot of stuff and then neglect it. Orientals are^' rather like children in a nursery. When they get a new toy they are all over it for a short time,and then it is thrown in a corner and left to rust. This is very largely what happens with armaments, and unless Reza Khan can give the time to inspecting his^arsenals f himself,in detail, he will soon find that all his expensive purchases have either rusted' to pieces or else have disappeared. I don’t wish to belittle a potential enemy, but IrrnpH’':’ j ' !'■ 'i Its don’t think that we should get too alarmed at the prospect of Persia acquiring all these armaments. But as I said before, the most important question from our point of view is Persian liaval forces in the Persian Gulf, and this is complicated by the fact that we have no territorial status in the latter place. I know that we have interests and that for at least 200 years we have policed these waters and kept them open for trade, but although this may entitle us to special consideration it gives no actual rights.Draft Paper. political Department. tost Secret. ter 4 DEC 1951 Col. H.L. Ismay, QB., D30., War Office! tony thanks for your letter of 15th November (B.M.116Q) about Persian armaments, tost of our information a bout the Persian Army is derived from the intelligence summaries of the Military Attachb at Tehran which we receive from the P.O. but which are sent, I understand, direct to the W.Q. by the Military ; Attache. There are also odd pieces of information about military natters (mostly droop movements) in the various intelligence summaries and diaries which we get from certain consular posts in Persia but we always send these at once to the W.O. as soon as they are received. I fear that we are thus not in a position to add anything to the information in the enclosure to your letter. 2. In considering the general state of military preparedness of Persia it nay be worth bearing in mind that in the autumn of last year the Persian Govt, acquired from Italy a fleet of two sloops of 950 tons displacement and four patrol boats of 331 tons displacement for service in the Persian/ 1925 5000 6.33 (Persian Gulf (for details of armament j etc. see Rome despatch No.771 of 23rd | September 1932 to the F.0.)and that in; my of this year the Persian Delegation to the Disarmament Conference informed the British Delegation that the Persiafn Govt, “envisaged'’ in their naval programme the construction of 39,500 tons of new vessels for service! in the Caspian Sea ana in the Gulf made up as follows:- For the Caspian. 4 Destroyers For the Persian Gulf. 4,400 tons 5 Cruisers (3 of sub class i) (2 of sub class ii) 4 Submarines 15,000 tons 6 ,900 tons 3,200 tons (Persian note dated 27th fey 1933 a copy of which was enclosed in Admty. No. M.01578/33 of 22nd June 1933 to the F.O.) This programme is perhaps to be taken with the proverbial grain of salt but an Italian officer serving with the Persian Navy is said to have mentioned in conversation (last summer) that the Persian Govt, had ordered two ’’cruisers” from Italy.(Express letter from Pol. Resident in Persian Gulf dated 15th August 1933)-* 5. I take it you have sent a similar letter to F.O., A.fe and Adlty.

This summary discloses the fact that Persia la shortly likely to have more rifles, M.Os and light automatics than she really requires; and at the same time that she is rapidly rectifying her deficiencies in artillery, aircraft, and signalling material. For example, when her outstanding orders are completed, she will have in addition to her old stocks (a) 20 mountain, 4 field and 2 A. V. batteries. (b 40 training, 20 fighting and 56 bombing aircraft (excluding any crashes In the future). * / / 6 O (c) 600 field telephones, 12 10-line exchanges and a number of hellos and signalling lamps. (d) 54 tractors for artillery.

As we are most anxious to have the best and most up-to-date information on this subject, I should be most grateful if you could let us have any comments on the attached Note or any information, which we may not have received, which might help us to augment it.
