CONFIDENTIAL. [E 7480/1/93] No. 1. Record of. Thirty-Sixth Meeting of the Assyrian Committee held on December 11, at 4 p.m. —{Communicated by Mr. Makins {Geneva) on December 12; Received in Foreign Office, December 17.) 22 ! December 17, 1934. Section 2 . THE committee had before it a memorandum by the Secretary-General on the present position of the work of the committee, two communications from the Iraqi delegation to the League of Nations concerning the situation in the camp at Mosul, and a letter from the French Government regarding the funds necessary for the completion of the settlement of Assyrians of Iraq in Syria. The President first explained the reasons for which he had convoked the committee. The information recently received from the Iraqi Government had caused him considerable uneasiness, and he was in particular disquieted by the departure of Major Thomson and by the partial closure by the Iraqi Government of the camp at Mosul. He was not satisfied about the situation, and he was not able to take the responsibility of allowing it to continue without consulting the committee. The Secretary, on the invitation of the President, then gave the committee a summary of the previous history of the two questions raised. As regards the departure of Major Thomson, he said that, while the major had been appointed by the Iraqi Government, this appointment had been brought about as a result of negotiations with the committee. The committee had attached great importance to the presence of a foreign expert at Mosul, and had taken note of Major Thomson’s appointment. Major Thomson had, moreover, undertaken not to leave before the work was completed, and he had also assumed the chairman ship of the relief committee at Mosul. Now he had departed without inforiqing the committee at a time when the partial closure of the camp was creating serious problems. As regards the Mosul camp, there were several points which were not clear. The Iraqi Government had undertaken to maintain the camp; they had now, without informing the committee, pursued a policy of partial closure. It was not clear from the reports how many Assyrians remained in the camp and how many had been forced to leave it. Moreover, the camp had been, from the first, intended for Assyrians without resources; now, as result of the division into categories, it was found that there were in the camp not only persons with male supporters elsewhere in Iraq, but also with menfolk in the camp itself. The President then proposed that the Iraqi representative should be invited to attend the committee and to give information on the points in doubt. He suggested that the committee should agree on a series of questions to be asked. He first proposed to enquire categorically wnether the Iraqi Government had terminated Major Thomson’s appointment or not. The United Kingdom Representative said that on this point he understood that the correspondence quoted in the memorandum circulated by the ecretaiy- General gave an incorrect impression of the position. His information was that Major Thomson had left Iraq on the clear understanding that he would return when required to resume the post of President of the League Commi ee, an that he had actually been asked by the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs to return in February next. He, in fact, undertook to return whenever his services should be required for the purpose of preparatory ^ _ transference of the Assyrians to some other home. The Uni e ^ , ap?ppd sentative was able to inform the committee confidentially of tins, ^ ag e that the information should properly come from the Iraqi representative that a question should be addressed to him on the point. The Danish Refresentative enquired whether the committee had authority to ask the Iraqi representative whether Major Thomson s appointment h [281 r—2]2 -■ , , - QlrpT1 r.nte of the Iraqi decision to inform the terminated.

The Iraqi Representative replied that Major Thomson had left Iraq because he had^ felt he had^no work to do for the time being. The Iraqi Government were willing to re-employ him when the occasion arose, and, therefore, Major Thomson had left Iraq temporarily. The President asked whether Major Thomson had resigned or whether he was on leave. The Iraqi Representative said that he would not call it leave. The President interpreted this to mean that Major Thomson’s appointment had been terminated, but that he was ready to take up his duties again when called upon to do so. The Iraqi Representative said he could not answer the question specifically and must refer it to his Government. The President took note of this statement and asked the Iraqi Government for a precise declaration on the point. The President then asked who had replaced Major Thomson on the local committee and on the relief committee. t The Iraqi Representative said that the mutessarif had replaced Major Thomson on both bodies, and that he was assisted by Major Wilson. The President then referred to the inconsistency in the figures for the Assyrians who were left in the camp at Mosul, and asked the Iraqi representative for the exact figure. The Iraqi Representative replied that, from information he had received on the 8th December, there were 372 Assyrians left in the camp. From information received on the same date, of those Assyrians who had accepted the Government’s financial offer, some had gone to their villages and others were working with relatives in Bagdad and Mosul. He recalled the advice which had been given to the Iraqi Government that they should encourage the Assyrians to leave the camp. The Pi esident asked what had happened to those Assyrians who had refused the Government’s offer of financial assistance. The Iraqi Representative could not give definite information on this point. He would refer the matter to his Government. The President then pointed out that one of the categories into which the inmates of the camp had been divided was composed of persons who had menfolk were th ™ men^placecf? ^ ^ mtlmati ° n ° f SUch a thln S' In category and he^would^refoT’the'm^teTto his'lloverMaent' 8 qUeSti ° n needed ex P lanation MtereufrtkfrehldTothl 611 wh ':‘ her f 6 Iraqi representative could supply a the camp 8 d h mention of the measures taken to close one part of Government.^* said ^ ^e would have to refer this matter to hisThe President then asked whether the arrangements which the Iraqi Govern ment had now made in regard to the camp were final, or whether the Government had other measures in contemplation. The Iraqi Representative said that he would refer the matter to his Government. The President then asked a question which had been suggested by the Danish representative. He enquired whether the existence of a male relative in some part of Iraq was regarded as an adequate reason for requiring him to leave the camp, or whether they informed themselves as to the economic and financial position of that relative. The Iraqi P^epresentative said that he would again refer to his Government. The President .took note of the Iraqi representative’s answers, and begged him to get replies as soon as possible. The Iraqi Representative then expressed great concern that he had not had previous knowledge of the questions which would be put to him. He had, indeed, asked the Secretariat for hints on this point, but they had been unable to give him any information. He now wished to make a declaration. The Iraqi Government repeated the assurances which they had previously made to the committee with regard to the Assyrians in Iraq. They would continue to look after their welfare and to conform to the wishes of the committee. (He then withdrew.) The committee, on the proposal of the President, then agreed to defer consideration of the questions raised pending replies from tne Iraqi Government. The committee then considered the question of the relief of necessitous Assyrians. The Secretary mentioned a communication which he had received from an Assyrian in Geneva, one Malik Andreos, containing alarmist prognostications as to the prospects of the Assyrians in Iraq during the coming winter. The United Kingdom Representative was able to inform the committee confidentially that information which had been received from a neutral anci thoroughly trustworthy source tended to show that accounts of hardship and destitution among the Assyrians should be treated with reserve; while it could not be said that there would be no distress among them during the winter, according to this information there was little likelihood of serious destitution occurring. The President then enquired whether the French Government had received any reply from French Guiana. The French Representative said that in4 r\ ^ ^ • T-P if waQ unfavourable and satisfactory information was the Assyrians from Iraq in Syria. The French Representative expressed the opinion that this question flight be postponed until the question of the future of the Assyrians could be considered as a whole. He explained that the matter was not one of extreme urgency. The French Representative also informed the committee that enquiries m French possessions showed that there was no possibility of settling the Assyrians, as a whole, in any one colony. Small numbers of Assyrians might, perhaps, be taken in different colonies, but further than this the French Government could not go.

The minutes of the meeting are flagged. 2. The discussion,, at which the Ambassador- Designate, Mr. Clark: Kerr, was present, shewed that the Foreign Office were much concerned at the possibility of further outbreaks, more particularly as there now seemed a risk that the British Guiana scheme might prove impracticable,, and a further risk of a different type - that, if it did prove impracticable/* - 2 '- t impracticalDla, there would he pressure in League circles to abandon any idea of expatriating the Assyrians and to insist on provision being made for them in Iraq under ( ■ proper safeguards* 3. The Air Ministry agreed that if the British Guiana scheme broke down the risk of serious disturbances would he definitely increased. The D.C.A.S. expressed the view that if the Iraq Government were given to understand well in advance that H.M.G. would take a very serious view of any failure on their part to keep disorder in hand, no disorder would fake pl&amp;ce* If on tuie older dand tdey were under any misappredension as to our prodadle attitude, de could not feel tde same confidence* pressed as to wdat attitude sdould de adapted dy if widespread disorder were to dreaic outyf aMTn particular as to tde attitude to de adopted dy tde R.A.F., Sir E.

The Ambassador’s interim reply is given in his telegram 277 of 19th December, on P«Z.7857/34 flagged. 6. The Ambassador*s views may of course be modified in the light of his discussions with the A.O.C. and Sir K. Cornwallis. He has always been slightly inclined (perhaps not unnaturally) to look at the Assyrian problem to some e xtent through Iraqi spectacles - a tendency not lessened by the unwise behaviour of the Assyrians themselves, and in particular of the Patriarch, and there are suggestions of this in his present telegram. He is, too, perhaps inclined to underrate the risks that the British Guiar scheme may collapse and that the League may refuse to concern themselves further with the possibility of settlement outside Iraq. Again, while we may entirely accept all that he says as to the prohibitive cost anc the extreme political difficulty of resumption of control by H.M.G., the fact remains that we might still find ourselves in a most difficult position, bol internationally and in this country were the R.A.F. tc stand by during massacres of Assyrians and Chaldeans, however much unwise behaviour on the part of the Assyrians or the Patriarch might have contributed to such massacres.* But we may agree with the Ambassad that the importance of finding a home for the Assyrians ©utside Iraq is on other grounds so great that no effort should be spared to secure this and that we should be prepared in the last resort to tively^ith^.M.G. consider even the Syrian pis aller.

The question is primarily one for the Foreign : Office and the Air Ministry, who will no doutt submit an agreed memorandum either to the Cabinet (as was contemplated in the Middle East Committee) or to the Standing Ministerial Middle East Committee, once the further report promised by sir Francis Humphrys has been received and considered. l-U JU[ Htt [This Docnment is the Property of His B ritannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] Fim IRAQ.

Detailed reply by despatch will be sent as soon as possible but will ta.ke time as I shall have to consult Air Officer Commanding, Cornwallis (who is away on tour) and Wilson. I offer following preliminary observations. 1„ I cannot contemplate possibility of failure to make offer of new home outside Iraq to those ex-Ottoman Assyrians who wish to leave. Such failure would inevitably result sooner or later in grave disorders in which His Majesty ? s Government could hardly escape becoming involved. 2. I consider it possible that offer of British Guiana if made will be refused by Assyrians as there is evidence of propaganda to this effect emanating from. Patriarch. If British Guiana fails for whatever reason I strongly advocate alternative home being found by League closer to Iraq. 5. In spite of obvious objections some of which I have \i A• already pointed out (sec paragraph 5 of my despatch No. 61S of September 21st) offer of Syria would be far preferable to retention in this country of refugees who are unwilling to staj. _ My impression is that French would not be averse from making offer if invited to do so by the League and it seems likely that sufficient land could be found there for all. ex-Ottoman Assyrians who wish to leave Iraq. * 'lu 'V-- 1 Ai*is •«.

I therefore suggest that my efforts should be concentrated on persuading Iraqi Government to discourage retaliatory measures even in face of provocation and that issue of proclamation to tribes themselves would be likely to disturb rather than tranquillise situation. 5. I would also stress that it is high time to take measures to prevent the Patriarch from issuing propaganda liable to excite these disorders. If he could be persuaded to change his tactics and co-operate with His Majesty 1 s Government and League of Nations the gravest source of danger would be eliminated, It is in the temper of the Assyrians rathei than in the attitude of Iraqi Government that potentialities of disorder lie. Bo long as former abstain from acts of folly I am confident 3 as 1 was in 1952, that Iraqi Government will not incite or conduct any form of terrorism against Assyrians. 6« Employment of Royal Air Force in Iraq on the side of the Assyrians against Iraqi Government forces must be avoided at all costs as it would inevitably spell disaster. 7. Subject to Air Officer Commanding's comments I am of opinion that very large ground forces would be necessary for successful armed intervention (such as is foreshadowed in paragraph 17 of your despatch) cost of which would be entirely prohibitive. Moreover employment of armed forces against our ally would entail unjustifiable reversal of policy and when our forces3. forces were withdrawn would of Christian minorities and relationsc involve expulsion or extermination lasting alienation of Anglo-Iraai To sum U P- fe c&amp;niio t abandon policy of settling outside Iraq those Assyrians who wish to leave and some means must be found for putting this policy into effect. Re-settlement within the British Empire is much the best solution but offer of Syria though a pis allcr is infinitely better than no offer at all. The most expensive form of re-settlement would cost far less and be infinitely more satisfactory than the mildest j-orm of physical coercion undertaken against Iraqi Government in support of a provocative minority.I In any further communication on this subject, please quote 50 x- f&amp;y/ /tfJ . and address —not to any persafl by name, pm, Xp—/ ‘The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1.

AS yon are aware, the preliminary report of General Browne’s mission to British Guiana to investigate the possibilities of the Rupununi district of that colony for the resettlement of the Assyrians from Iraq is expected very shortly, and I have recently had under consideration, in consultation with the other interested Departments of His Majesty’s Government, the situation which would be likely to arise should that report prove unfavourable. Such a possibility is, unfortunately, far from being out of the question. As you are aware, it was because His Majesty’s Government found it impossible, on the information available, to decide upon the practicability of the proposal to settle the Assyrians in British Guiana that that proposal was put forward to the League of Nations in so tentative a manner, and that so much emphasis was laid upon the necessity of its investigation by an independent mission. It is still most doubtful whether climatic conditions will be found to be such as to offer a reasonable prospect of the Assyrians thriving in the colony, while reports have been received suggesting that the soil may possess insufficient phosphates to make agriculture remunerative. Moreover, as your Excellency knows, certain large areas have already been set aside as Indian reservations on which it would be impossible to encroach, and if the area of suitable land should prove more limited than was at first anticipated, the extent of these reservations may cause a further complication. While His Majesty’s Government greatly hope that these obstacles may not prove insuperable, they are clearly sufficiently serious to make it desirable to face without further delay the situation which may arise if General Browne’s mission finds itself obliged to send an unfavourable report on the prospects of the scheme. 2. In such an event—or if General Browne’s report were of so doubtful a character as to postpone a definitely favourable decision for a further considei able period—the news would be likely to reach Iraq very rapidly, since it would be impossible to conceal the nature of the report either in Georgetown or in Geneva. It is important, therefore, to consider the effect which such an adveise or uncertain report would have, on the one hand, in Iraq, both on the Assyrians and the Iraqis, and, on the other, in Geneva on the Assyrian Committee and on the Council ot the League, with special regard to the relations between the League and the Iraqi 3. As regards the effect in Geneva, you will be aware from the proceedings of the Assyrian Committee during the past year that whenever difficulties have arisen there has been a strong tendency to abandon the idea of settlement outside Iraq and to press for the resettlement of the Assyrians m Iraq itse f un er ce, specific safeguards. There is every reason to believe that, m t e even o ei ] el Browne’s report on the British Guiana scheme proving unfavourabie neither the Assyrian Committee nor the Council itself would be willing o oonsi . alternatives, even if any such alternatives should have been se ^ 101 /® ^ P „ , Niow The vague and tentative French suggestions for settlement m e ^ or in French Guiana seem hardly likely to offer practicab e aer . ^ - there appear to be any real hope of a satisfactory rese French numbers of Assyrians in Syria—a proposal which, even i a c P J . seems would be open to many serious objections. ^ or . thes ®|f n • tances rev ive the clear that the League would almost certainly m sue pstablishment proposal for the resettlement of the Assvnans m Iraq and fo the establislime pioposai ior rne resetuemenu ux serious dispute between the of safeguards for their future, and m suen an evtu i which League and the Iraqi Government may be expected to anse, with results wlucn nught prove i.r-rea,cMn^ ^ ^ ^ of this question, the news that the British Guianf scheme was impracticable, or that a decision nyega [281 f—1]2 to it must be deferred for a further ^.^“‘^'gtatSTn'the course of the oral that you regard it as essential th f‘if a further disaster is to be should be removed from Iraq mth eg unsuitab i e and the Assyrian avoided.

I am aware that many ot the Assyrians have developed a refugee mentality, and that they have prefened to rely on voluntary help from outside in case of need rather than to become selt- supporting by returning to their villages, ploughing their land and sowing their crops. Whatever the causes of the present situation may be, however, there seems little doubt that it contains grave elements of danger. 6. This danger is likely to be much aggravated by the fact that hardship and distress among the Assyrians may be expected to be more serious this winter even than last. Even in the country districts in which the Assyrians have remained or to which they have partially returned, there seems to be good reason to believe that the Assyrians are subject to a considerable amount of petty vexation, injustice and robbery, which seems likely to bring about a situation of increasing tension. The reports which had already reached me of small but constant thefts of livestock, crops, tools, utensils, building materials and even ploughs left in the fields in accordance with local custom, have recently been confirmed in conversations which members of my staff have held with Mr. Cumberland, the very level-headed and well-informed American missionary in Dohuk, who is well known to you and who recently passed through London on his way to America. I understand that in such cases the Assyrians find considerable difficulty in obtaining effective redress owing to the fact that the police and the local authorities, though often not ill-disposed, are still influenced by their recollection that those who helped or protected the Assyrians in the summer and autumn of 1933 obtained no commendation or reward, while those who were most active against them have not only suffered no punishment, but in many cases have gained, materially. 7- It appears indeed that many of those responsible for the excesses of 1933 —for instance, a notorious police sergeant from Simel and various village head- me ? !“ y 6 Dohuk area-were after a short period, promoted or specially favoured, and that the significance of this fact has not been lost either upon the police or local authorities as a whole, or upon the Kurds, whose attitude is an imnortant 933 nTiv C0 o n f S lh e e7 fl g d the 777°/ th y slt ' ation - ^ is no doAbt fruS in the 3 re7eZ 77 7 “ uch , to hel P and protect the Assyrians; but mwmfnTor Tiht lo t h beheve , hat , m the event of further ‘rouble they will be I have in fact heard of tioTh''' fA'' lae , 01 at ' east to restrain their followers, in the Cinfln 1933 h,n ,7nv\ bemg 7 agam ? those Kurds wh o took part CrdsTh^ y stlfied t0 tlle discontent of those a due share 'of n ioot a before a the n Assyrians n ev a ntuanv^d™a e t e f m ' na T' 0n t0 ^ circumstances, which must be well 'known to .i,,, , ' e P : t ^ rom Iraq.

Not only can t e Patriarch not be counted upon to exercise a moderating influence P eo Pl e \t)ut he appears to have deliberately refrained from encouraging if he has not actively discouraged, any return by his people to normal life pending emigration from Iraq. It appears, moreover, that there is in the Patriarch’s party in Iraq an active group of propagandists who may easily create trouble in the very unstable and uncertain situation which will exist should the British Guiana scheme prove impracticable. There is, as you are aware, no means at present of changing this situation. The Patriarch’s influence is a fact which must be faced and reckoned with. Moreover, an open breach between His Majesty’s Government and the Patriarch would, in present circumstances, only still further complicate the situation, since it is likely to prove extremely difficuit to bring about any kind of solution of the Assyrian problem without the Patriarch’s acquiescence, if not his active co-operation. 9. I have so far described the dangers of the situation, as I see them, in the light of the various reports which have reached me, entirely in relation to the possible breakdown of the British Guiana scheme. They seem to me, however,A so serious as to make it desirable to consider without further delay the possibility of further trouble occurring, even if General Browne’s preliminary report from British Guiana should be of a favourable character. It must be remembered that even in that event there will still inevitably be many further serious difficulties and delays, particularly in regard to finance, before any emigration scheme can be put into effect. A favourable preliminary report will not necessarily be final, and it will be necessary to await a detailed report, which cannot be available before the end of January, before any concrete proposals can be placed before the Assyrians. The scheme will then have to be put before the Assyrians themselves, and there have been indications that many of them may find it extremely unpalatable. Moreover, much preparatory work will have to be carried out. both in Iraq and in British Guiana before any large-scale migration can be undertaken. It is most doubtful whether it will be possible, even in the most favourable circumstances, to transport any considerable number of Assyrians from Iraq before the autumn of 1935. Meanwhile, the dangers of the situation are not likely to grow less. This aspect of the matter has recently been much insisted upon in ecclesiastical circles in this country, and it is not possible for His Majesty’s Government to reply to the expression of such misgivings with mere general reassurances that the situation need cause no real anxiety. 10. His Majesty’s Government, therefore, feel that it is essential to consider 1 as a matter of urgency what measures, if any, can be taken to reduce the risk ol further trouble breaking out, and to decide on the policy to be followed shou d troubles nevertheless occur in spite of any such precautions. It is clearly extremely difficult to estimate with any precision the chances of an incident occurring, and I am well aware that the Assyrians, being foi the mos ^ pai disarmed and in a more or less cowed condition, are less likely o PJ OVOve incident than they were before the troubles of August 1933. e\er ei ^ bS ) 1( ^ increasing destitution of a large number of the Assyrians, the con imiance o it petty vexations to which they are undoubtedly, though possibly mevitably, subjected, and the combination of prolonged idleness, penury and fear ieactm on an essentially hot-headed and short-sighted people, mig easi } , me, lead a small body of the wilder spirits among them, par icu ar } P Lyw bv the intrigues of the Patriarchal party, to commit some espe ^ hinu or aggression which might in turn lead to severe reprisals and fai-reach g result!

It is clear, therefore, that any trouble on the lines which I have foreshadowed would confront His Majesty’s Government with a most embarrassing dilemma and could not fail to have a profound effect upon their whole policy in regard j to Iraq. In these circumstances, it seems essential, whether the British Guiana scheme proves practicable or not, to take every possible step to anticipate such trouble and to prevent the risk of its development. 15. It seems clear that, whatever may be the attitude of the Assyrians, over which His Majesty’s Government are not in a position to exercise any influence, the decisive factor is likely to be the attitude of the Iraqi Government. There seems no doubt that with the forces and organisation at their disposal the Iraqi Government are, in fact, in a position to prevent serious disturbances occurring, and to check any acts of retaliation or reprisal on any considerable scale by Kurds or Arabs against the Assyrians, even if a small group of the latter should seek to provoke trouble. One of the main dangers of the present situation, however, seems to lie in the indifference which the Iraqi Government showed in connexion with the troubles of 1933. The impression which their apparent condonation of the Simel massacre and of the subsequent looting and excesses seems to have produced in Iraq may well lead the Kurds to imagine that, in the event of any incident occuriing which would give them an excuse for acts of aggression against the Assyrians, no more effective steps would be taken to punish them than were taken against the majority of those guilty of excesses a year ago. Incidentally, the Iraqi Government, by allowing any outbreak to occur, would be playing into the nands of the extremists on the Assyrian side, who, as you know would be by no means averse to seeing a recurrence of the troubles of 1933 • 1( ?' 11 a P pears ’. ^rcfore, most desirable that the Iraqi Government should adv y lce ’, tod , further trouble breaks out. oftheir thev fbonldTet it £ P f i from whatever quarter it may arise, and that that no viettmisatton T ^ me xvssyilans will be allowed even m retaliation forfifffircsssr- gatfSgrrr*. mt *• «r*»* 1 dimensions, would be greatly reduced. ^ an ^ la e b P lea ^ in g to dangerous trouble to^evdop.^^reidlngfn a^boufa^CLHsti^ ''lb sl ; o 1 1(l 4 llo 'b aimcult lor tne iiritisn iorces to refrain from intervening. It is therefore conceivable that a situation might arise in which His Majesty’s Government won d be faced with the alternative of a humiliating withdrawal, which might be fatal to their prestige, or of action which might involve them in serious operations! which could only be sustained by a virtual resumption of physical controfover the affected aiea. It is clearly impossible at the present stage for His Maiesty’s Government to contemplate so far-reaching a suggestion Is the resumpt oi/of direct physical control in any part of Iraq, but it is difficult to see what clear alternative policy they could pursue in the event of the Iraqi Government allowing a serious outbreak to occur. Before considering this aspect of the matter further, I shall welcome your views as to the action which it would be open to His Majesty s Government to take in such an eventuality. You will no doubt consult the Air Officer Commanding before replying on this aspect of the question. ^ ^ o r 18. I shall in any case be glad to receive vour Excellency’s views at a very early date on all the various aspects of the problem discussed in this despatch. In view of the imminence of the issue of General Browne’s preliminary report, you may think it well to send me your preliminary views by telegram. I fully realise that the dangers anticipated in this despatch may never materialise, and that, more especially if General Browne’s report is not unfavourable, the situation may drift on without seriously deteriorating further, and may even gradually improve. It may be that the Iraqi Government are already fully alive to these dangers, and to the extremely grave reaction on the international position of Iraq, which any recurrence, on however small a scale and at whoever’s instigation, of the troubles of 1933, would bring about. Nevertheless, the consequences of any trouble would be so serious, not only for Iraq but also for His Majesty’s Government, and might so gravely imperil the future of the constructive work which has, largely through your own personal efforts, hitherto been achieved in Iraq, that it is clearly of the first importance to form as accurate an opinion as possible of the precise extent of these dangers, and, above all, to make every possible effort to forestall or prevent them. His Majesty’s Government, in forming this opinion and in deciding on their future policy, must naturally rely mainly on your assistance and advice. 19. Meanwhile, you are authorised, without waiting for further instruc tions, and should you consider it desirable to do so, to use all your influence with the Iraqi Government, with a view to making them realise the potential dangers of the situation, and the importance of assuring themselves of the reliability of their officials in the northern districts, of issuing appropriate instructions to all such authorities, and of leaving the Kurds under no misapprehension as to the severe measures which would be taken against anyone indulging in looting or any other acts of aggression (in whatever way they may be provoked) against the Assyrians or the other Chrisian minorities of Iraq.

(Paper No. M.E. (0) 166). mn CHaIRIvIAN stated that the meeting had been called at the request of the Foreign Office in order to consider the possible dangers that might arise regarding the ASSyrians and to ascertain whether there was any political or other action which could usefully be taken at Baghdad or elsewhere 5 either as a precautionary measure or to cieal with trouble should it occur. MR* -RBNDEL explained that the Foreign Office did not wish to appear unduly alarmist. He recognised that it was very probable that the dangers referred to in his letter to the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff would not materialise. Moreover s the British Authorities on the spot had not up to now been inclined to take at all an alarmist view of the situation &lt;, and he did not wish to appear to be taking a line v/hich was in any way opposed to the attitude of the men on the spot. There were 5 however 9 certain new factors in the situation which were extremely disquieting. He felt that a good deal of the confidence which had been expressed as to the future was based on the assumption that the British Guiana scheme would prove practicable. This was by no means certain* and he felt that * if it were to prove impracticable. a most dangerous situation might develop very suddenly!7 lie was well aware of the difficulties of reviewing an essentially hypothetical situation. He felt, however, that it was important frankly to face these possible dangers cUiu, if possible, to reach some conclusion as to the action which should he taken to meet or forestall them, so that His majesty’s Government might not he caught unawares in the event of trouble. It was a fortunate circumstance tiidv eotn Mr. Clark Herr who was to succeed. Sir Francis Humphrys as Ambassador at Baghdad early next year, and Air Vice- Marshal Mitchell who was to succeed Air Vice-Marshal Burnett as Air Officer Commanding in Iraq next month, had been available and were therefore able to attend the d i s c us s i on» The greatest danger seemed to him to be that which would arise if the British Guiana scheme proved impracticable. It was generally agreed that the majority of the Assyrians must leave Iraq and Sir Francis Humphrys himself had stated that between 6 ? 000 and 8,000 Assyrians at least must be got. out of Iraq by some means or other if further disaster was to be averted. Everyone hoped that the British Guiana scheme would prove practicable, but there were still many very doubtful factors about it. There was reason to fear that much of the soil might not possess sufficient phosphates to make agriculture possible. Certain large areas had already been set aside as ±ndian r eser vat ions. 01 h e r s seems d un s a i t a o ± e cli m a 1 1 c cm. 1 y ° If the scheme were found impracticable, the news of its failure would immediately reach Geneva and Iraq, ana a very unpleasant situation indeed might aeieiop. Even if the Report of General Browne’s Mission were favourable, and the scheme were proceeded vnui, there would inevitably be m any 'urther serious difficul ties ana delays, particularly over finance. lie costor the scheme v/ould be well over £300,000 and it was likely to be extremely difficult to extract more than £100*000 at most from the Iraqi Government. The Cabinet had decided a year ago against any contribution by His Majesty’s Govern ment otherwise than as part of a contribution by the League* but the League was likely to make great difficulties about contributing. It was thus most uncertain whether and when it would be possible to give the Assyrians any real hope of re-settlement outside Iraq* and any decision that they must stay in Iraq might well lead to an immediate outbreak either on their part or on that of their neighbours. The Iraqi Government could no doubt guard against these dangers and control the situation. But their attitude in exonerating the perpetrators of the outrages of 1933 and in failing to penalise any of the Kurds or other tribesmen who had benefited at the expense of the Assyrians - e.g, * by securing loot from Assyrian villages - might well encourage the Kurds who had not yet had any share in this loot to further excesses. The Assyrians were capable of any folly and the possibility must be faced of their provoking some incident which would give the Kurds or even the Iraqi Authorities an excellent excuse for retaliation. passions were much inflamed and a conflagration might very easily develop from very small beginnings. we might thus find ourselves faced with a massacre In some part of the town oi Mosul before we had been able to consider the situation or to take any measures to bring it under control. On the other hand* it was extremely difficult to make any constructive proposals. On the whole* re was inclined to suggest that the best course would be to put zuese con siderations to Sir Francis Humphrys emphasising the -S- ncssibixity^el ll of the British u-uiana scheme falling through ? and drawing attention to the dangerous situation to which this might give rise * and to ash him for any suggestions which he could make for reducing the danger of the situation. Meanwhile 5 he suggested that everything possible should be done to ensure that we received rapidly and regularly all available information as to the local situation through such sources as were open to us 5 i«e. s His Majesty’s Consular Officers * and the Royal Air Force Intelligence Officers. A great deal might also depend on the attitude and personality of the Iraqi military officers in the northern districts, and possibly the British Military Mission might be able to give useful information on this point. Meanwhile^ Sir F* Humphrys might be able to induce the Iraqi Government to review the appointment of civilian officials in tne northern areas with a view to making sure that suitable and reliable men held the various key positions. the CHAIRMAN noted that Mr. Rend el naa alluded to the possibility of delays in carrying the British Guiana scheme into effect even if it were proved to be practicable. He wished to draw attention to the fact that, in the view of the Colonial Office, even if General Browne's Report were satisfactory .and assuming, that arrangements coula be made for finance, preparatory measures in British Guiana wuulcl he required, which were likely to render it impossible for any Assyrians to be transported thither before the Autumn of 1935. -4-iv:R. biBRi'TD^LB in reply to a regaest to explain ^ what Programme the Assyrian Committee of the League had in nund? said that a preliminary report from General Browne’s mission was expected in the latter part of December* But if it were favourable it would be necessary to await a detailed report, which could not be available before the end of January, before concrete proposals could be placed before tne Assyrians. Trie wishes of the Assyrians would then have to be ascertained, and. it was probably only then that the thorny question of finance could be seriously tackled. It was impossible to say yet how or how quickly this question would be solved. When the scheme had been proved to be physically and financially practicable, time would still be needed for preparatory work in Iraq as well as for the work in British Guiana to which the Chairman had referred. The Assyrian Committee hoped that it might be possible, in spite of all the difficulties, to send out an advance party of Assyrians to British Guiana by April next before the wet season, but it seemed more than likely that no migration would, in fact, be possib1e until the autumn. But although all these delays, if British Guiana were suitable, would be regrettable and perhaps attended by a certain risk, the situation which seemed to call for urgent consideration was that likely to arise it General Browne s report were unfavourable. It was not merely a quesuion of ho- the Assyrians in Iraq would react. there woulu oe °i^f-cultI..s at Geneva* Be anticipated a strong movement in the Assyrian Committee against any further effort being made to set ole *he Assyrians outside Iraq* There was a feeling cjnon &amp; se were not directly concerned and did not realise the danger of the situation in Iraq, that it was wrong for the gsoyrm.^ns to be moved from that country,* that the Iraqi Government were -5entire^ tu Dlame for what had occurred 5 and that the Assyrians could and ought to he resettled in Iraq under certain safeguards* 'Whenever difficulties regarding settlement elsewhere had arisen during the past year* there had heen a tendency in the Assyrian Committee to aoanaon the idea* and if the British Guiana scheme failed * it would he extremely difficult to persuade the committee to emuam upon* or the League Council to au (niorise* a furtner search for a suitable alternative* a, serious dispute hetweem the League and Iraq might therefore he expected* and in such an event* the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq was likely to become extremely prec ariou s * MR* RENDEL explained that what the Foreign Office feared was the situation which would develop if the British Guiana scheme had to he ruled out altogether. If it were known that it was a practicable possibility* and that arrangements were being proceeded with to carry it into effect* the situation would be greatly eased* even If there was to be some further delay in taking out the main party* THE CHAIRMAN asked whether anything was known about the attitude of the Assyrians towards the Britisn Guiana scheme* and whether any moderating influence could he exercised upon them through the Mar Shimun, MR* STERNBALS BENNETT said that reports about the attitude of the Assyrians varied* and It would be impossible to obtain any clear idea until a concrete scheme could be put before them, a great many would not commit themselves without a lead from the Mar Bhimun* - 6 -kR a KiiRDEL thought that the Mar Shimun t s attitude VvOula no u necessarily 'be unfavourable 5 as he had been consulted in the selection of General Browne to investigate settlement schemes^ and had then said that he would accept any recommendation which General Browne might make. MR# 3TEKNDALE BENNETT expressed the view that it was unlikely that the Mar Shimun would be prepared to exercise a moderating influence on his people if the British Guiana scheme broke down or difficulties arose. It was obviously to his interest to keep the situation in Iraq unstable until a solution to his liking was reached. So far as could be ascertained, the difficulties of the present situation were largely due to his influence in discouraging any return to normal life pending emigration. THE CHAIRMAN said that ne understood that the Mar Shimun had claimed temporal as well as spiritual authority in Iraq, and had demanded autonomy there. Jas not this attitude likely to cause difriculties in British Guiana? MR. KSNDEL replied that it was most difficult to separate temporal and religious questions in the East. The Assyrians regarded themselves as a nation or n millet ?? no less than as a religion. o,nd the Mar Shimun was essentially their national leader, and recognised as such by the majority of the Assyrians, -7-vho were blindly loyal to him. On the other hand if tne a a ay ri ana were settled in territory under British control* it should eventually he possible to restrict the Mar ;3himun t s authority to the purely spiritual sphere® It would he better, however, not to raise this question for the present as it would be essential to secure the Mar 8hiniun ii s support and co-operation if any resettlement scheme were to he a success® all AIR MARSHAL SIR EDGAR LUDLO possible measures to prevent f-KEWITT agreed that an outbreak should b considered® He concurred in the proposal that Sir Francis Humphrys should be asked to use his influence with the Iraqi Government, Should that Government make it clear that no victimisation of the Assyrians would be allowed* it was unlikely that the Kurds would interfere* and the chance of incidents arising would be lessened. The Iraqi Government were the sole people who could take such action. The action of the British forces in Iraq had been laid down in 1933* /in _ C.I.D* Paper Nos 1088-B. It was confined to the protection of British interests, and they could only be called upon to aeal with internal disorder at the request of the Iraqi Government, In the event of trouble at Mosul* our Air rorce there would have no justification to take action* as responsibil ity for internal security restea solely with the Iraqi Government * There was a strong det aci-aut nt -“-lani troops stationed at Mosul* which was perfectly capaole of dealing with any trouble* and of nipping in the bud any outbreak against the Government. A massacre or n ot therefore break out in Mosul major disorder couldwitiaout the kno*iedKe, o 15 at i *,~ 0 3 lea8t acquiescence 3 of the Iraqi Government, This being so, the best'way of preventing any mch event would be for Eis Majesty’s u-o ye rumen u to incuce it clear to the Iraqi Government in advance that tney would take an extremely strong line if a massacre occurred, if necessary even resuming control 01 Uiie Cuan tr ^ 0 Such a threat, he felt sure, would P i0 ' ,e e -^ivoci ve, and although it would be extremely difficult to implement, the mere fact that it was in the •bacngrouna would be sufficient to safeguard the situation, i-.ih, RnU.nnii feared that it would not be possible to authorise Sir Francis Humphrys to use such a threat unless His majesty 9 s Government were prepared in the last resort to imolemen u is, and this would obviously require Cabinet sane g ion* It was However likely to prove impossible to o o uai n 0 aoi ns t sane t i o n fo r so impo r t an t and far~ reaching a decision on a pure1y hypothetic al issue• SIR Ec LUDLOW -HEW ITT agreed, but felt that it was only by the use of such a threat that all danger could really be averted. He agreed that it would be extremely embarrassing for the Royal Air Force to stand by inactively at Mosul while a massacre was actually taking place in the town, THE CHAIRMAN felt that the issue which had been raised was too big a one for the Sub-Committee to consider. Only the Cabinet could consider so far-reaching a proposition as the resump tion of control by His Majesty’s Government over Iraq. For im mediate purposes he thought that the Foreign Office snouid obtain Sir Francis Humphry g’ views on all aspects o± the situation, MS. RENDED felt that in view of the attitude which tne Iraqi Government had taken up in the summer of IS33, the Kurds might well imagine that they could indulge in lenev.ed looting or other activities against cue Asspriano vi^n impunity* The Assyrians might easily £dve them or the Iraqis great provocation, and any trouble m *. Vi-ll^e —9 —might spread very quickly and affect the situation in Mosul itself* Ee considered therefore that the possibility (though perhaps not probability) of a round up and massacre of minority elements in some quarter of Mosul must be frankly faced 9 and if anything of this kind occurred* it must be remembered that there were other Christian minorities* richer* more defenceless and far more numerous than the Assyrians who might offer a very tempting prey* Trouble might thus spread to the Chaldeans* Jacobites* Syrian Catholics and other sects* and might even affect the Jews* In such an event His Majesty’s Government might find* themselves in a very embarrassing and numi 1 iatmg position indeed* as the British air forces in Mosul could not very well passively stand by without very considerable loso of prestige while Christian minor! uies were uoin^ mass acred | nor could they very well abandon Mosul said leave the Christian minorities to their fate vi miouu equally humiliating results* As regards the action to oe taken should M-b I ra ii Government fail to take any adequate measures to discourage an outbreak or prevent a massacre, it must be rememoereu _ • y,f to t t, p poti e of hations aspect that there was also an imporocUit ^ eol 0 u ^ - 4-1-,^ r »no ''ip had officially been to this question* since tne League nau entrusted with the solution of the Assyrian problem.

But some more general move on the part of the Assyrians* though perhaps not so likely* might have to be taken into account* In the Amadia district the Assyrians, were still well armed* and a concentration in that area might be joined by Assyrians in other districts* who* while nothing like so well equipped* still possessed some arms* In the event of an Assyrian rising of this sort* the Iraqi Government would presumably have to be allowed to deal with the situation* our efforts being concentrated on localising the trouble. SIB ELGAR LUDLOW -Hill ITT did not believe that there was real danger of such a rising* but if it occurred* the Assyrians would have put themselves completely in the wrong* and there would be no alternative but tor? leave bae - raq.i G-ovemilieut to deal with the situation in the same way as we should leave them to deal with any reoellion on the part of the Kurdso The situation which would really face His Majesty’s Government with a difficult problem would be a renewal of massacres and outrages against the AsSyrians 5 spreading perhaps to other communities« MR. KEJTDEL agreed with Sir Pd gar Ludlow-Hewitt * In the event of any large-scale concentration by the Assyrians which could be reasonably regarded as in the nature of a rebellion, our efforts would necessarily have to be concentrated on localising the trouble. Moreover such a development would probably give time for further consideration of the problem in the light of the circumstances of the moment, what he was more afraid of was some act of folly on the part of the Assyrians which would lead to immediate retaliation, spreading to anti-Christian outrages in Mosul town in immediate proximity to the Royal Air Force cantonment. In reply to a question by the Chairman, MR. RKNDEL said that while Sir Francis Humphrys was in a position to exercise very strong personal influence on the Iraqi Government, there was no likelihood of his being abj.-.- to do so with the Assyrians. Ine Assyrians *»exe r10VJ uni- to be Influenced by any British Official, and not even Major Thomson carried as much weight ueitii t^em once done. In any case, Major Thomson was no longer in Iraq, and would probably only return there ii the British Guiana scheme turned out to be Mm Rend el feared therefore that nothing suit able - 12 -could 1)8 done from the Assyrian side of the matter to reduce the possibility of trouble, SIR E. LUDLOE “JEW XT? said that in the event of the Xraci Government being guilty of acquiescence in a massacre of Assyrians,there were two alternatives; either for His Majesty’s Government to sit still and do nothing, or to take a strong line with the Iraqi Government. He thought that the most that could be done at present would be to lay all the facts before Sir Francis Humphrys and to ask his advice as to what measures could be taken to prevent such a situation arising. MR. KMDEL thought that it should be possible to draft a despatch to Sir Francis Humphrys somewhat on the following lines. The immediate occasion of the despatch would be the danger of the British Guiana scheme proving impracticable, with the result that the sim or eight thousand Assyrians whose early emigration from Iraq Sir Francis Humphrys himself had regarded as essential won.:.*! be obliged to remain in Iraq, with very serious consequent risks. Those risks could then be developed on the lines indicated in mr- Rendel T s letter of 24th November to the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, and Sir Francis Humphrys 1 attention could be drawn to the * extremely embarrassing position in which His ka.jeotm' ° ^Oveinr^nt would find themselves in the unfortunate event of any truuole developing in Mosul Town in close proximity to the Royal Air Force cantonment. Sir Francis Humphrys’ views could then be asked as, to the host methods of forestalling these various eventualities and^ particularly how far it would he possible to bring s^roAg inf-ucnce to bear on the Iraqi Government with a view to making them realise the gravity of the situation and the importance of issuing proper instructions to all their authorities in northern Iraq an. of leaving the Kurds under no misapprehension as to the consequences ^ which would follow if they indulged an any loo.mg ox -13-21 aggression or r© c&amp;j_i 8 .tion against the Assyrians* Th© despatch could be so framed as to asfc for a full and detailed reply on each specific point from Sir Francis Humphrys. when those replies were received, the two papers could then if necessary he circulated as a self-contained and self~explanatory document for Cabinet consideration. He wished incidentally to explain that he had not yet had an opportunity of submitting this matter to his Secretary of State. His action in bringing it before the Sub-Committee was therefore taken entirely on his own initiative and responsibility. He could not, however, accept the view that there was plenty of time. It was quite possible, as he had said at first, that no trouble would occur. But if things did go w^rong and trouble were to break out, it might well break out in the near 1 future as the result of unsatisfactory news from British Guiana or of some act of folly on the part of some Assyrian group, and it might then spread very rapidljf so that urgent action would be required. One of the most dangerous moments would be towards the end of December, when the preliminary report of General Browne 1 s mission might be expected. THE CHAIHMAH, in summing up, felt that the Sub-Committee were agreed that Sir Francis Humphrys should be apprised of the views taken by the Foreign Office. He thought that oir Francis Kumphrys 1 advice should be as need as ro what action could be taken to prevent any outbreaks, ana, in the ei'ent of any occurring, the best steps to deal wiidi timm. Sub-Committee could not do anything as regards the at 01 time of His Majesty 7 s Government in the event of the iraqi Government being found guilty of acquiescing in or instigating a massacre. This was a remote contingency , 'ou u occur action must be decided by the CaDin^ ^ t^ 1 -t.- of the circumstances existing at the time. -14-3^ CONCLUSION.'

THE CHAIRMAN stated that the meeting had been called at the request of the Foreign Office in order to consider the possible dangers that might arise regarding the Assyrians and to ascertain whether there was any political or other action which could usefully he taken at Baghdad or elsewhere, either as a precautionary measure or to deal with trouble should it occur. not MR. RENDER explained that the wish to appear unduly alarmist. F or ei gn Off ice di d He recognised that it was very probable that the dangers referred to in his letter to the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff would not materialise. Moreover, the British Authorities on the spot had not up to now been inclined to take at all an alarmist view of the situation, and he did not wish to appear to se talcing a line which was in any way opposed to the attitude of the men on the spot. There were, however, certain new factors in the uation which were extremely disquieting. He ielt teat ood deal of the confidence which had been expressed as the future was based on the assumption that the British ana scheme would prove practicable. means certain, and he felt that, if it were to prove impracticable, a most dangerous situation might develop ver, y suddenly. 1 -He was well aware of the difficulties of reviewing an essentially hypothetical situation* He felt 5 however, tnat it was important frankly to face these possible dangers and s if possible, to reach some conclusion as to the action which should be taken to meet or forestall them, so that His Majesty’s Government might not be caught ’unawares in the event of trouble. It was a fortunate circumstance that both Mr. Clark Kerr who was to succeed Sir p. Humphrys as Ambassador at Baghdad early next year, end Air lice- Marshal Mitchell who was to succeed Air yice—Marshal Burnett as Air Officer Commanding in Iraq next month, had been available and were therefore able to attend the discussion. The greatest danger seemed to him to be that wnucn would arise if the British Guiana scheme proved impracticable. It was generally agreed that the majority 01 one ASoyricJn must leave Iraq and Sir p. Humphrys himself bo,d ^oa^ed that between 6,000 and 8,000 Assyrians at must got out. of Iraq by some means or other if Aieir In.-- were to be saved.

The Cabinet had decided a year ago against any contribution by His Majesty*s Govern ment otherwise than as part of a contribution by the League* tut the League was likely to make great difficulties about contributing. It was thus most uncertain whether and when it would be possible to give the Assyrians any real hope of re- settlement outside Iraq* and any decision tnat they must stay in Iraq might well lead to an immediaue outbreak eitnei on their part or on that of their neignbours* The Iraqi Government could no doubt guard against thes dangers and control the situation. But their attituae in exonerating the perpetrators of the outrages oi c.uid in failing to penalise any of the Kurds or other tribesmen had benefited at the expense of the Assyrians - e *g* * ky securing loot from Assyrian villages - might wtll enc^u... cqge the Kurds who had not yet had any share in thio s,Q^t further excesses.

Meanwhile* he suggested that everything possible should he done to ensure that we received rapidly and regularly all available information as to the local situation through such sources as were open to us* i.e.* His Majesty 1 s Consular Officers* and the Royal Air Force Intelligence Officers. A great deal might also depend on the attitude and personality of the Iraqi military officers in command of the northern district* and possibly the British Military Mission might be able uo give useful information on this point. Meanwhile® Sir p. Humphrys might* be able to induce the Iraqi Government to review the appointment of civilian officials in the northern areas with a view to making sure that sui uauj.e and reliable men held the various key positions® THE CHAIRMAN noted that Mr. Rend el had alluded to the possibility of delays in carrying the British u-uiana scheme into effect even if it were proved to be practicable. He wished to draw attention to the fact that* - r ' 0AU tiJ ' e Colonial Office point of view* even if Genera^ Br^v/ne Report were satisfactory* practical measures ih ■ u *‘.itioi Guiana would be required* which were likely to rend impossible for any Assyrians to be transported thither before the autumn of 1935. 4-11 MR. STBRNDALS BENKSTT, in reply to a request to explain what programme the Assyrian Committee of the League had in mind 9 said that a preliminary report from General Bronne’s mission was expected in the latter part of December-. But if it were favourable it would be necessary to await a detailed report,, which could not be available before the end of January, before a concrete proposal could be placed before the Assyrians. The wishes of the Assyrians would then be ascertained, and it was probably only then that the thorny question of finance could be seriously tackled. It was impossible to say yet how or how quickly this question would oe solved. When the scheme had been proved to be physically and financially practicable, time would still be needed for preparatory work in Iraq as well as for the work in British Guiana to which the Chairman had referred. The Assyrian Committee hoped that it might be possible, in spite of all the difficulties, to send out an advance party of Assyrians to British Guiana by April next before the wet season, but it seemed more than likely that no migration would, in fact, be possible until the autumn* But although all these delays, if British Guiana were suitable, would be regrettable and perhaps attended by a certain risk, the situation which seemed to call tor urgent consideration was that likely to arise if General Browne’s report were unfavourable. It was not merely a question of n,^. + fhe Assyrians in Iraq would react. There would be uixf ^cult I..&gt;' at Geneva. Be anticipated a strong movement in the Assyrian Committee against any further effort being made to settle Assyrians outside Iraq* There was a feeling among those wt ' te re not directly concerned and did not realise tne GaHt, situation in Iraq, that it was wrong for the -,.o^yri‘' De m °ved from that country? that the Iraqi Governmententirely to 'blame for wlist had occurred, and that the Assyrians could and ought to he resettled in Iraq, under certain oaiegua.i do* y?nenever difficulties regarding settlement elsewhere had arisen during the past year* there had 'been a tendency in the Assyrian Committee to abandon the idea, and if the British Guiana scheme failed, it would he extremely difficult to persuade the Committee to embark upon, or the League Council to authorise, a further search for a suitable alternative* A serious dispute between the League and Iraq, might therefore be expected, and in such an event, the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq was likely to become extremely precarious. MR. RLNDEL explained that what the Foreign Office feared was the situation which would develop if the British Guiana scheme had to be ruled out altogether. If it were known that it was a practicable possibility, and that arrangements were being proceeded with to carry it into effect, the situation would be greatly eased, even if there was to be some further delay in taking out tne main party. THE! CHAIRMAN asked whether anything was known about the attitude of the Assyrians towards the British Guiana scheme, and whether any moderating influence could be exercised upon them through the Mar Shimun. MR. 3TBRKDAL3 BEN f r PT said that reports about tne attitude of the Assyrians varied, and it woa..aJ ue impossible to obtain any clear idea until a concrete scheme could be put before them. A great many would not commit themselves without a lead from the Shimu31 Mi.a sjihj-i thought that the Mar Shimun f s attitude would not necessarily he unfavourable, as he had 'been consulted in tne selection of Genera-l Prowne to investigate settlement schemes, and had then said that he would accept any recommendation which General Browne might make. MS. SfKSiTBALE BEihfETT expressed the view that it was unlikely that the Mar Shimun would be prepared to exercise a moderating influence on his people if the British Guiana scheme broke down or difficulties arose. It was obviously to his interest to keep the situation in Iraq unstable until a solution to his liking was reached. So far as could be ascertained, the difficulties of the present situation were largely due to his influence in discouraging any return to normal life pending emigration. THE CHAIRMAN understood that the Mar Shimun had claimed temporal as well as spiritual authority in Iraq, and had demanded autonomy there. Was not this attitude likely to cause difficulties in British Guiana? MR. EBIT DSL replied that it was most difficult to separate temporal and religious questions in me East. The Assyrians regarded themselves as a nation or 'millet n no less than as a religion, cind the Mar Shimun was essentially their national leader, and recognised as such by the majority of the people? -7who were blindly loyal to him. On the other hand, if the Assyrians were settled in territory under British controls it should eventually he possible to restrict the Mar Shimun^ authority to the purely spiritual sphereo It was better, however, not to raise this question for the present as it would be essential to secure the Mar Biiimun t s support and co-operation if any resettlement scheme were to he a success. AIR.MARSHAL SIR EDGAR. LUDI,Of-HEWITT agreed that all possible measures to prevent an outbreak should be considered. He concurred in the proposal that Sir Francis Humphrys should be asked to use his influence with the Iraqi Government. Should that Government make it clear that no victimisation of the Assyrians would be allowed, it was unlikely that the Kurds would interfere, and the chance of incidents arising would be lessened. The Iraqi Government were the sole people who could take such action. The action of the British forces in ±raq was laid down in 1932, vide C. I*D* Paper not 10 Su-B. They were confined solely to the protection of British interests, and could only be called upon to de&amp;l Aiun internal disorder at the request of the ^raqi Government In the event of trouble at Mosul, our Air Borce t^ere would have no justification to take action, r^spon^ibi ity for internal security rested solely with the Iiaqi Government. There was a strong detachment of xra M i troops stationed at Mosul? which was perfectly Ca ^ a dealing with any trouble, and of nipping in -'he bu‘ -M outbreak against the Government. a niassacie o major disorder could not therefore hreah out in-osul 8 -wi t&amp;out 'tiiG ^ Oi* tiu least tlie S-Coniescence of 5 tlr'© Iraqi Government. This being so ? the best• way of preventing any such event would be for His Majesty’s Gove rumen u to mal^e i i&gt; clear 'go the Iraqi Government in advance that they would take an extremely strong line if a massacre occurred* if necessary even resuming control of the country. Such a threat* he felt sure* would prove effective* and although it would 'be extremely difficult to implement* the mere fact that it was in the background would be sufficient to safeguard the situation, MR. REN DEL feared that it would not be possible to authorise Sir F. Humphrys to use such a threat unless His Majesty’s Government were prepared in the last resort to implement it* and this would obviously require Cabinet sanction. It was however likely to prove impossible to obtain Cabinet sanction for so important and far-reaching a decision on a purely hypothetical issue. SIR E. LUDLOW-HEWITT agreed* but felt that it was only by the use of such a threat that all danger could really be averted. He agreed that it would be impossible for the Royal Air Force to stand by inactively at Mosul while a massacre was actually taking place in the town. THE CHAIRMAN felt that the issue which had been raised was too big a one for the Sub-Commit tee to consider further Gt this stage. He felt that in the first instance it was essential to obtain Sir F. Humphry s’ views on ail aspects ox th e situation. MIL RBNDEL felt that in view of the attitude which tne irs.cji Government had taken up in the summer ox Kurds might well imagine that they could indulge in renev.ed looting or other activities against the Assyrians v.nth uapunity. T he Assyrians might easily give them or biie -^qis great pro vocation; and any trouole in ^ vmight spread very quickly and affect the situation in Mosul itself® he considered therefore that ton possi Dili oy ( CiiOU^u peinaps not prohahility) of a round up aid. massacre of minority elements in some quarter of Mosul must he frankly faced 5 and if anything of this kind occurred* it must he remembered that there were other Christian minorities* richer* more defenceless and far more numerous than the Assyrians who might offer a very tempting prey. Trouble might thus spread to the Chaldeans* Jacobeans* Syrian Orthodox and other sects* and might even affect the Jews. In such an event His Majesty 1 s Government might find themselves in a very embarrassing and humiliating position indeed* as the British air forces in Mosul could not very well passively stand by without very considerable loss of prestige while Christian minorities were being mass acred | nor could they very well abandon Mosul end leave the Christian minorities to their fate without equally humiliating results. As regards the action to be taken should the Iraqi Government fail to take any adequate measures to discourage an outbreak or prevent a massacre* it must be remem do red that there was also an important League of Nations aspect to this question* since the League had officially oeen entrusted with the solution of the Assyrian prooleirn Iraq was a fully independent Member of the League of Nations* and the Council of the League would certainly be closely concerned if any trouble arose in connection with the Assuan situation. On the other hand* the League machin^r^ necessarily moved slowly* and the League would certainly be most reluctant to assume any direct responsibility* - 10 -**3 The crisis under discussion, if it arose, would, arise very suddenly, and there would certainly oe no time in such an eventuality to oring League macninery into play* Probably there would not be time even to obtain a Cabinet decision* it was for this reason that it was desirable to face the possibility in advance, ME* 3T3HKDALS BSMLSTT said that it was naturally diificult to forecast in what form, the danger would c--i a. o e• Tne e v entuali t y hi the rto cont emplated by tiie Sud- Commit tee was a minor incident in some village, probably provoked by the folly of a small body of Assyrians, Vviiich would lead to reprisals on a rapidly increasing scale, which might involve other non-Moslem communities. But some more general move on the part or the Assyrians, though perhaps not so likely, might have to be taken into account* In the Amadia district the Assyrians were still well armed, and a concentration in that area might be joined by Assyrians in other districts, who, while nothing like so well equipped, still possessed some arms* In the event °-£ an Assyrian rising of this sort, the Iraqi Government would presumably have to be allowed to deal with the situation, our efforts being concentrated on localising ike trouble* SIR EDGAR LUDLOW-HEWITT did not believe that the •/as real danger of such a rising, but if it occurred, re the Assyrians would have put themselves completely in wxe wrong, and there would be no alternative but to4? leave the Iraqi Government to deal with the situation in the same way as we should leave them to deal with any rebellion on the part of the KurdSo The situation which would really face His Majesty* s Government with a difficult problem would be a renewal of massacres and outrages against the Assyrians, spreading perhaps to other communities, MR. REITDEL agreed with Sir Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt♦ In the event of any large-scale concentration by the Assyrians which could be reasonably regarded as in the nature of a rebellion, our efforts would necessarily have to be concentrated on localising the trouble. Moreover such a development would probably give time for further consideration of the problem in the light of the circumstances of the moment. What he was more afraid of was some act of folly on the part of the Assyrians which would lead to immediate retaliation, spreading to anti-Christian outrages in Mosul town in immediate proximity to the Royal Air Force cantonment In reply to a question by the Chairman, MR. Rr-hDEL said that while Sir Francis Humphrys was in a position to exercise very strong personal influence on the ihaqx Government, there was no likelihood of his being chit do so with the Assyrians. The Assyrians were now unlibexj to be influenced by any British Official, and nut eveil Major Thomson carried as much weight with them as ns had once done. In any case. Major Thomson was no longer in Iraq, and would probably only return ij - aere 1 ' the British Gu.Iana scheme turned cuo oo bu suitable. Mr. Rend el feared therefore that nothing -IS-could be done iTom the Assyrian side of the matter to reduce the possibility of trouble. THE CHAIRMAN said that in the event of the Iraqi Government being found guilty of acquiescence in a massacre 5 a very difficult situation would arise. It was obviously impossible to make a threat to that Government that unless they maintained order His Majesty’s Government would step in and resume control. This was a very grave decision which could only be consid.ered by the Cabinet s and to use such a threat which might not be implemented was not for the Official Sub-Committee to consider. SIR S. LUDLOW-HEwITT said that should such a situation arise&lt;, there were two alternatives; either to sit still and do nothing ? or to take a strong line with the Iraqi Government. He thought that the most that could oe done at present would be to lay all the facts before Sir E* Humphrys and to ask his advice as to what measures could be taken to prevent such a situation arising. MR. RENDER thought that it should be possible to draft a despatch to Sir F. Humphrys somewhat on tne following linesc The immediate occasion of the despatch would be the danger of the British Guiana scheme Meowing impracticable 5 with the result that the six or eight thousand Assyrians whose early emigration iron I r ^u Sir F. Humphrys himself had regarded as essentiax wou^d obliged to remain in Iraq, with very serious consequent risks. Those risks could then be developed on the indicated in Mr. Rendel’s letter of C4th November to the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, and Sir F. Humphrys alien tion could be drawn to the extremely embarrassing po^iti in which His Majesty’s Government would findthemsel ine unfortunate event of any trouble developing in Mose in close proximity to the Royal Air Force cantonment. -13-Humphry s T viev/s could then be a sued as to the best methods of* forestalling these various eventualities and particularly by bringing strong influence to bear on the Iraqi Government with a view to making them realise the gravity of the situation and the importance of issuing proper instructions to all their authorities in northern Iraq and leaving the Kurds under no misapprehension as to the consequences which would follow if they indulged in any looting or other acts of aggression or retaliation against the Assyrians. The despatch could be so framed as to ask for a full and detailed reply on each specific point from Sir p. Humphrys. When that reply was receivedc, the two papers could then if necessary be circulated as a self-contained and self-explanatory document for Ccibiiiet consideration. He could not, however 9 accept the view that there was plenty of time. It was quite possible* as he had said at first* that no trouble would occur. But if tilings kid go wrong and trouble were to break out* it might well oieeu, ouo in the near future as the result of unsatisfactory news xrom British Guiana or of some act of folly on the part of oO^e Assyrian group* and it might then spread very rapial^ that urgent action would be required. One of the moot dangerous moments would be towards the ena o± December* wh the preliminary report of General Browne’s mission mi fo ht -Lf] E CHAIRMAN 5 in summing up, felt that the oUD ommittee were agreed that Sir Francis Humphrys should oe pprised of the views taken by the Foreign Office, cought that Sir Francis Humphrys’ advice sno^ld o what action could be taken to present any on^bree n. the event of any occurring, the oest ste lr .o to do hem.

My dear Ludlow-Hav/itt ^ Many thanhs for your letter (DoC,A # S^/85) of 21st November about the situation in northern Iraq. 2. Burnett’s message certainly sounds reassuring^ and I think that any report from Humphrys would probably be to much the same effect s as admittedly the situation is very different from that which existed before the outbreak of 1933 s and there are no outward and visible signs of further immediate trouble on a similar scale. Indeed $ there are many factors which seem to render it unlikely that the danger of trouble in the north is either imminent or serious. The Assyrians are nothing line so well armed as they were 5 and there is reason to suppose that they are too cowed to take sny definite initiative as a body in provoking trouble. The Iraqi Government on their side may be expected to have learnt the necessity of proceeding more wisely 5 and there is no concentration of Iraqi troops in the north. I agree 5 too ? that the prospect of the British Guiana scheme materialising in tne comparatively near future - so long as that prospect exists - may be expected to make the situation eaoier. . • 4.v,4- tnfire is no view of all these good reasons for assuming wia• rea l cause for anxiety* it is only with great diffidence that I venture to put forward one or two considei odions which seem to me to nut the matter in rathei a n Airjice-Marshal ulr R * Ludlow~Hew i11, K.C.B. , CcM-G, -3-3 . Although there are no obvious signs of an early recurrence of trouble on the scale of the events of August, 1933, I think there is no doubt that hardship and distress among the Assyrians will be worse this winter than last. This is largely, if not entirely, their own fault. The patriarchal party have been exercising a steady pressure on the Assyrians to prevent them from going back to their homes, ploughing their land and sowing crops. The Assyrians themselves have preferred to wait on events on the chance of some emigration scheme materialising or some voluntary help coming from outside. The stories of Assyrians refusing to go back to the land, particularly in the Shaikhan area are numerous. One cannot, of course, help people beyond a certain point against themselves, and I think there is no doubt that the Assyrians have brought this particular trouble on their own heads - although, seeing that they have mostly been deprived of their arms, and that public security in the country districts appears to have deteriorated, I am not altogether surprised at their hesitation about returning. My point, however, is not who is responsible for the situation. It is that, as a result of this general failure to produce crops or carry on agricultural or pastoral work, destitution must inevitably, it seems to me, become increasingly serious, and that whan people reach a certain point of destitution (particularly ii as in this case they are also idle and afraid; the danger of their doing something desperate or idiotic is much increased. The second feature of the situation which seems 1116 to justify anxiety is the Iraqi attitude towards the various elements concerned in the troubles Ox I3u3* have read, a great many reports from very &lt;dilf i ~' ren ^ on this question, and obtained a good deal, ox first information, and I do not remember having come across single case where the Iraqi Government have -4-serious penalty on anyone responsible either for looting or for massacre $ or obtained any restitution of loot on any considerable scale. On the contrary s I have had reliable reports to the effect that many of those responsible for the worst excesses of 1933 - e.g.* certain of the police officers at Simel and village headmen of the Dohuk area - were j, after a short period* promoted or specially favoured* while those who held their men back or went out of their way to protect the Assyrians* not only received no commenda tion* but were often looked on askance* It is true that many of the leading Kurds in 1933 did a good deal to help and protect the Assyrians. There seems very good reason to believe* however* that they would be unwilling or unable to take a similar line again; and one leading Kurdish Agfa in particular told Cumberland* the American missionary from Dohuk, only a few weeks ago ? that if any opportunity occurred for renewed looting* it would be out of the question for him to hold his men back. In fact* everyone whom I have met has agreed that those Kurds who did not tame part in the looting of the summer and autumn of 1933 aro feeling very resentful and are becoming increasingly anxious to secure for themselves a share in what may be goin-i* corresponding to that so easily obtained and ne^t ^y a num °f their less scrupulous fellow-tribesmen. I atj - ve many wild statements* chiefly on the part of the Kurds vmo * * * 4- q jffO *ere at one time well-disposed towards the Assyrians* effect that if the Assyrians are to leave Iraq ior new Place of settlement * steps v/ill be taken to v ' u tn ey at any rate take nothing away with them. 5 - Thirdly * there seems even now to be a &amp; petty vexation* injustice and robbery going on Assyrians * which* while hardly amounting to sy sterna &lt;. o situat ion x-or seeution must, it seems to me* bring oJoo a in?eat deal of the °t increasing tension according to i petty thefts6b Qr&gt;Q very minierous 5 not only ^ ron uhe Assyrians but also from the Chaldeanso For example 9 it is now coimnon for ploughs left in fields which were being tilled to be stolen overnight. Until last year ploughs 3 as being instruments necessary for the sustenance of life 3 were c, I understands, universally regarded as sacrosancto Livestock^ tools and utensils are stolen from the lower floors of houses in Assyrian and Chaldean villages while the occupants are asleep above. Cases have been quoted of building materials collected for building or repairing a house 9 e 0 go 9 poplar roof poles 9 being regularly taken as soon as they are collected. Livestock are also stolen while grazing. In all these cases there is no eiiective redresoj end the As Syrian S 3 as Cumberland put it 9 know that they tf cannot get a square deal' !f 5 since the police and local autnorities*, though often not ill-disposed* are still under the influence of the fact that those who helped the Assyrians in the summer and autumn of 1933 gained no thing 9 while those who were most active against them have not only suffered no punishment* but have* in many casesj gained materially* 6 , The fourth disquieting feature of the situation sterns to me to be the mischievous propaganda and suicidal folly of the lutriarelks party 9 who unfortunately still commands the olind allegiance of the majority. This party are 9 01 course 9 dee;l„ committed to establish their contention tha b it is quite impossible for any Assyrians to remain in luaq, can see 9 the Patriarch is indifferent to the Hardships be may be imposing on his people in Iraq* or indeed - 6 -57 their 'best interests. My own impression is that he would not hesitate hring ca)ou g cl massacre — regardless of' anw of its ultimate consequences - if he felt that this would have a good propaganda value in Europe and America, Certci i-n v this has 'been my own impression when I have talked to him myselfo He is ? as you iaaow P extraordinarily shortsighted and wrong-headed 9 and his aunt 5 who still seems to have the means to bring strong influence to bear on the followers of the Patriarchal family in Iraq 9 is probably even more dangerous in this way. There seems no doubt that there is am active group of propagandists of the Mar Shimun* s faction in Mosul who are out to create as much trouble as possible and to make sure that things get a good deal worse before they get better. It seems to me that they have a great deal of extremely inflammable material to deal with and that the situation as a whole is quite sufficiently full of danger to give them plenty of opportunity for serious mischiefo I was already feeling very uncomfortable about the whole situation when I had my two long talks with Cumberland on the 20th and 21 st November which I mentioned to you over the telephone, I think you already know a.11 about Cumberland^ and it is probably unnecessary;, therefore 9 for me to say anything more about him, I would only remark that my two recent interviews have more than confirmed the high opinion I had already formed of his sound judgment and objective and impartial outlook. He struck us all here as exceedingly well-balanced and well-informed. There is ftoCning fanatical about him and he is fully alive to all faults and failings of the Assyrians^ whom he regards the Having brought their disasters upon themselves, He i^?

Cum'berland fully recognised that on the surface 5 for the reasons given in paragraph 2 of this letter* the danger is less acute than before the trouble of 1933o Nevertheless he thought that the risk of further trouble was both grave and constant,, The increasing destitution of the Assyrians* the intrigues of the Patriarchal party* and the dissatis faction of the Kurds who got no loot in 1933* were all in his view extremely dangerous factors., He described us as living in this area ;f on the edge of a volcano*** and what seems to him - and to me - the greatest danger* is that so far as we can see there would be nothing to prevent a very small spark leading to a very big conflagration,, 9, It was on this point that I was most impressed by what he told me 0 He thought there was every chance that some group of Assyrian hotheads might at any moment commit an act of folly which might easily lead to retaliations,, He had no hesitation in saying that if by any chance there were an outbreak in one of the villages it would be the signal for outbreaks in or against a great number of others* He felt himself and I confess that* as far as my information enables me to judge* I entirely agree - that such outbreaks would not stop at the small villages in the hills* ouc would affect the richer Chaldean villages nearer Mosul before it was possible in present conditions to call a halt. He regarded the situation in Mosul itself as equally dangerous* as passions are still inflamed as a result of what happened last year* so that the wilder elements of 'khe population might easily start an attack against uo o on ly the Assyrians but also the Chaldeans in the to./n tney had any excuse to do so such as would be furnione 'by news of trouble in the villageso The facu un-k Iraqi Government show r ed themselves so indifierent 1 ^ JSI 1 and. took no eilective steps to prevent a massacre or to punish those guilty of excesses,, has made a strong impression and unless the Iraqi Government can give clear evidence of a different attitude he : fore troubl e breaks out , it may well he too late for them with the best will in the worldto do anything to stop trouble if and when it begins* 10 . I think a particularly disquieting feature of Cumberland's statements to rue is the probability - on which he laid great stress - of the trouble spreading to the Chaldeans,, not only because they are much more numerous and richer than the Nestorian Assyrians^ but also because I think this might easily lead to the trouble spreading further still to other sects and races 9 and might incidentally involve international complications^ as the French and Italians would probably 5 for political reasons 9 take up the Chaldean cause on the plea that they are Catholics in union with Rome. He I have set all this out at great length because I want to make it clear why 5 In spite of the re-assuring report of the Air Officer Commanding^ I still feel that the situation is so dangerous as to make it desirable to have a general political discussion about it in the Middle East Official Sub-Committee* It is of course quite possible that the situation v T ill drift on indefinitely without ever reaching a crisis* But the risk of the contrary is I think considerable* I should myself be inclined to put the chances at about fifty- xifty - an estimate with which Cumberland tells me that he agrees* Even Burnett's reassuring report expresses a doubt* He admits that there might be minor incidents^ and adds that it flap ends upon the attitude cf the Iraqi government whether or not such incidents load to serious disturbances* 1S * It is admittedly difficult to discuss a hypothetical situation,, but with so many elements of douot and risk I d o not think we can afford to postpone all consideration of 0Ur P°licy at any rate from the political angle until a ctualiy arises* There is 9 moreover? one factor which maxthe matter urgent. Burnett's views are based t. , ^ U - a large extent on the prospect of the British Guiana scheme material. ising. It is, however, by no means certain yet that it win materialise 0 ¥e put it forward to the , tentatively and insisted on a League investigation as a first step because we had ourselves considerable misgivings as •co ns practicability. The League mission is now in British Guiana 5 and we hope that its preliminary report may be avail- able during the latter half of December, We must, however, face the possibility that this report may be unfavourable, ? ana m that event the Assyrians will be confronted with the prospect of remaining in Iraq, or at any rate waiting a very long iime while further possibilities are being explored. In such circumstances we may be faced with sn immediate -outbreak of really serious trouble (for it will probably iapo^oib^e to conceal the news, which will be known in Georgetown and Geneva), and I feel strongly therefore that it is important to consider, before the preliminary report of the League mission is received, what line it might be possible for us to take if trouble should occur. I understand from Pirie that the Chief of the Air Staff hc.u a re-assuring talk w r ith Major Thomson. I have a sneat respect for Thomson who has done remarkably fine executive work in Mosul. But his recent experience has been a^moot ent i^ e ly in Mosul itself* and for this and other e ^-sons I doubt v/hether it would be wise to take his evidence altogether final. Moreover, he has not, as far as I ^ sc ussed the eventuality discussed in paragraph 12 above. 14 T agree of course with a great deal of what you say in S^aph 3 of your letter^ it is obviously undesirable^ ca n be avoided, that His Majesty's Government should u ob e d into intervention in Iraq on behalf of a minoxii,/ Sb ^ le Iraqi Government, or into assisting the Iraqi -10-Government in putting down its own unruly elements. Although I do not think that our interference would necessarily he contrary to the Treaty 5 as you suggest ? the Treaty certainly does not give us any right of inter vention and I agree with you that intervention in any form would probably lead us into all sorts of difficult complications. Moreover 9 I entirely agree that Imperial forces are not stationed in Iraq for the purpose of inter fering with the Iraqi Government 9 and I note that their present dispositions would not in any case be suitable for that purpose. But these are all ? it seems to me 5 further reasons why it is necessary for us to consider in advance what our policy ought to be in a given eventuality. We may wish to keep out of any trouble which may arise 3 but placed as we are may not events make it physically - or morally - impossible for us to do so? We found ourselves in August 1935 in a very humiliating position^ and I am anxious to do whatever may be possible to reduce the risk of our being caught insufficiently prepared by a similar situation. I think 9 the ref o re 9 that we ought to consider the possibilities without delay 9 and try to clear ourminds as to whether there is any political or other action which can usefully be taken at Bagdad or elsewhere either at once as a precaution^ or if and when there are signs of trouble really breaking out; and as to what action should be taken if trouble does break out 9 i 0 e . 9 what steps 9 if any 9 could be taken to remedy or localise it 9 ox j alterixchive by to minimise the risk of British forces becoming unwillingly involved. 15. Please forgive this unduly long letter? but it oe,,me no there might be certain advantages in putting my views writing to show why I still think that a meeting ol the Middle East Official Sub-Committee is desirable. Unless you see strong objection I should like to ask Hind to arra g -11-Proposed Settlement of the Assyrians in British Guiana. The chief developments which have taken place since the file was last submitted at P.Z. 5454/34 are as follows:- The option on the Rupununi lands which is valid up to 20th March 1935 was finally confirmed by meetings of the shareholders of the Rupununi Company on 7th and 20 th September last, and on 21st September the Legislative Council of British Guiana unanimously adopted the following resolution:- 'This Council approves the proposal that His Majesty’s Government should inform the League of Rations that there is land available in the Colony of British Guiana which appears prima facie to be suitable for settlement by the Assyrians, and is of the opinion that, as settlers, these people would be welcomed by the inhabitants of the colony; and agrees that the Government of British Guiana should co-operate in carrying such settlement into effect if it is decided to proceed with the project.” His Majesty’s Government were therefore able to address a letter to the President of the Assyrian Committee of the League of Rations on 22nd September (P.Z. 6066/34), covering a memorandum on the possibilities of Assyrian settlement in British Guiana. It was emphasised in the letter that while the prospects of the scheme seemed prima such as to justify H.M.G. in bringing them to the notice of the Committee a much closer examination would be necessary before the area suggested could be definitely pronounced as suitable for Assyrian settlement. The Assyrian Committee at once agreed to the despatch of a Mission of Investigation consisting of Brigadier General Brown and an Italian Agricultural Expert, and it is u nderstood that the Mission arrived in British Guiana at the/y-i P2.^/ 34 . fcjM* idlteTUhT^ £sr**~MSl 'foX Ua tv&gt;«4r 4fcw*'^ the end of October. It i s estimated that it wiU require at least three months for its investigations. At the same time the Committee had under considerate a letter from the French Government on the possibility of settling the Assyrians in the French Sudan. The question of sending a Mission of Investigation to French West Africa has not yet been decided, pending the receipt of further information from the French Government about the Sudan scheme. It seems doubtful whether much can be expected of this scheme since the French Government have suggested that in the first instance Assyrian immigration should only be carried out on the small scale of a few families as an experimental measure. Meanwhile a satisfactory agreement has been reached between the French and the Iraq Governments, providing for the transfer from Iraq to Syria of the families of certain Assyrians who had already been accommodated in the latter country. Some 1400 persons have been transferred from Iraq to Syria under this arrangement. On the surface at least the position of the Assyrians in Iraq seems fairly satisfactory. It is to be hoped that it will be possible to maintain their security during the coming winter, since even if the British Guiana scheme is finally declared to be practicable it is anticipated that no more than a small advance party will be able to go to British Guiana before the rainy season sets in in April next, and it will not be possible to transport the main body of the Assyrians to the Colony until the beginning of September 1S35. If, after all, the British Guiana scheme fails to materialise, the danger of further -ericas Assyrian troubles in Iraq would again be acute. fe.Giodb- on€ PARLIAMENTARY Session 1 !&gt;J3 -3 (. W-.UL.

JA’FAR PASHA-al-ASKARI, representative of Iraq, came to the Council table. M. Lopez Olivdn presented the following report and resolution/ 1 ) : c The report of our Committee on the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq (document C.427.1934.VII) is evidence that the appeal which the Council made to Governments on the 7th June, 1934, was not made in vain. “In letters dated the 22nd and 24th September, 1934 (document C.427.1934.VII), the Governments of the United Kingdom and France have made proposals, which are now being considered by the committee, for the possible settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq in British Guiana and the bend of the Niger in West Africa. It is also possible that other proposals may be made by the six Governments that have not yet replied. £ I am sure you will agree that the Council should tender its heartiest thanks to the Governments of the United Kingdom and France for the valuable co-operation they are offering the committee. “ You will doubtless have noticed the special importance attached by your committee to preliminary enquiries being made on the spot by persons whose ability and integrity afford every guarantee of the successful settle ment of the Assyrians under the League’s auspices. The Governments of the United Kingdom and France themselves requested in their letters that these missions of enquiry should be despatched. You will, I feel sure, vote the necessary funds and leave the committee entirely free to make its choice among the candidates and to come to any other arrangements that may be desirable. “You will certainly wish to express your satisfaction and to congratulate the Governments of France and Iraq on the happy issue of the direct negotiations that have led to the settlement of some 2,000 Assyrians in Syria pending the final decision on the problem as a whole. “ I beg to move the following resolution :— The Council: Approves the committee’s report and the present report; £ Thanks the Governments of the United Kingdom and France for the proposals they have made to the committee for the possible settlement, in the Rupununi area in British Guiana and in the bend of the Niger in West Africa, of such of the Assyrians of Iraq as may express the desire to leave that country; and “ £ Authorises the Secretary-General to draw, in accordance with article 33 (2) of the Financial Regulations, a sum not exceeding 50,000 Swiss francs from the item “ Working Capital Fund, to meet the cost of preliminary enquiries with a view to the settlement of sue Assyrians as may wish to leave Iraq. These expenses will be repaid to the League out of the funds that will be made available for financing the scheme as a whole.’ ” uiU UUL V before the Council, for [231 b—1] Mr. Eden did not wish to make any sh to make any comments on the details of the icpmt as regards the possibilities of settlement m r ^ (!)

He would however be glad to take the opportunity of associating himself warmly with what the rapporteur had said about the agreement relating to the transfer to Syria, and the provisional accommodation there, of the families of those Assyrians who had been interned in Syria last year. That agreement would, he felt sure, be welcomed by all the members of the Council on humanitarian grounds, and as putting an end to a state of affairs which had been a potential source of discontent, and therefore of friction. It did credit both to the French and to tlie Iraqi Govern ments, to both of whom Mr. Eden desired to pay a tribute for the spirit of accommodation which had made possible the liquidation of this important, if subsidiary, aspect of the Assyrian problem. M. Massigli desired to tender his thanks to the representative of the United Kingdom and to the va'ppovteuT for the tribute they had just paid to his Govern ment’s endeavours to promote a solution—if only a partial solution of the Assyrian problem. There had been special difficulties, arising out of local circumstances, but these had been successfully overcome, thanks to the authoiity of the League, the assistance of the committee and the goodwill of the Iraqi Government, and also, M. Massigli felt bound to say, to the valuable aid rendered on the spot by Dr. Burnier, the representative of the Refugees Office. Cemal Husnu Bey said that he wished to associate himself very warmly with the rapporteur’s thanks to the Governments of the United Kingdom and ol France. One radical and wholly satisfactory solution of the question which had been engaging the Council’s attention for some time past, and one which was in the interests of the ilssyrian people itself, would undoubtedly be settlement in countries such as those proposed by the United Kingdom and French Govern ments. Accordingly, in agreeing to the appointment of a mission of enquiry, the representative of Turkey would, here and now, offer it his best wishes for the success of its work. The President noted that the members of the Council were unanimous in paying a grateful tribute to the Powers for the practical efforts they were now making to solve a highly important problem. The resolution was adopted. (Ja’far Pasha-al-Askari withdrew.)70 LEAGUE OE NATIOIIS Communicated to the Co'ii-xttee for the Settlement of tho Assyrians of Iraq. O/lJin.Ass/ 7 S .

[Thursday 1st November.1 IRAQ Assyrians, Settlement. Captain P. MACDONALD asked the | Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs what progress has been made with regard to providing a suitable settlement for the MlH UlUi OK i Assyrians of Iraq ; and whether he can make any statement with regard to this matter ? Mr. EDEN: In a note dated 22 nd September His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom com municated to the Assyrian Committee of the Council of the League of Nations a detailed statement regarding the possi bilities, in so far as they are known, of settling the Assyrians in the Rupununi district of British Guiana. In a note of 24 th September the French Government put forward for the Committee’s con sideration the idea of settlement in the bend of the River Niger in French West Africa. Both Governments urged the importance, however, as a first step of despatching missions of investigation to the areas in question to pronounce upon ! their suitability for the particular pur- pose of Assyrian settlement. The Com mittee has since despatched a Mission of Investigation to British Guiana. It is estimated that this Mission, which was 1 due to arrive in the colony on 31 st ( October, will require three months for the accomplishment of its task. The j question of sending a similar Mission to rench West Africa is to be considered further by the Assyrian Committee on e receipt of supplementary information W lc h it has asked the French Govern ment to furnish.In any further communication on this subject, please quote N ° h-VAV \\ d address—w/ to any person by name, but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. k ' /] Y THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to an( ^&gt; by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop of the under-mentioned paper.

United Kingdom Delegate to Foreign Office.—(Received October 1.) (No. 157.) THE United Kingdom Delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit copies of a record of the 33rd meeting of the Council Committee, on the 24th September, respecting the Assyrian question. United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, September 28, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Assyrian Question. Record of Thirty-third Meeting of the Council Committee, held on September 24, 1934, at 4 p.m. THE President reported that unfavourable replies to the committee’s appeal of the 11th June last had been received from Belgium, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain; that certain replies were still outstanding; and that affirmative replies had been received from the United Kingdom Government and from the French Government. Before proceeding to consider these two replies, there was one point of procedure which the President wished to clear up. He expected to be away from Ins post between the 8th October and the 9th November. During that period the committee might be obliged to meet, and he would like to arrange for the appointment of a vice-president. The Spanish consul would attend the committee on his behalf, but it was clearly desirable that the presidency of the committee should be in the hands of one of the members who had attended its meetings throughout and was familiar with the work. He therefore proposed that the Danish representative should be appointed vice-president. This was unanimously agreed to. The President then went on to discuss the communication from the United kingdom Government. He recalled that that communication emphasised the urgency of the solution. The problem in Iraq brooked of no delay. The season lor immigration in British Guiana ended in April next, and much remained to be done even after the mission of investigation had completed its work, kven mis, according to the United Kingdom Government’s communication would require three months. The President was personally in favour of despatching a mission of investigation, as proposed by the United Kingdom Government. He j pt this mission should be generally on the lines of the one sent to Brazi , and he thought it would be particularly useful if Brigadier Browne-un view ot ms Assyrian experience and the further experience which he had gamed m Brazil could form part of the mission. The committee might wish the United kingdom representative to ascertain whether Brigadier Browne was willing to serve. The Mexican Representative observed that paragraph 4 of the United mgdom note provided a strong argument in favour of a mission of mves iga [231 a—2] B2 the Rupununi Coinpany would end on the 20th Mmch. He suggested, therefore, that the possibility should be considered, with a view to avoiding not only expense but also waste of time, of asking the Administration of one of the neighbouring countries, e.g., French or Dutch Guiana or Venezuela, to nominate such an agricultural expert, this would ensure that someone familial with the type of country under consideration would be chosen. The President said that the choice of the personnel of the mission obviously presented many difficulties, and he suggested that it might be best to leave it to himself and to the secretariat to submit a list of suitable candidates. The Danish Representative asked, as regards expense, whether the committee could proceed without the consent of the Assembly, seeing that the Assembly was still sitting. M. Arocha said that, as regards the expense of a mission, only the consent of the Council would be required. The President said that if the committee decided to send out a mission or more than one mission, the committee could submit a resolution to the Council asking for authority to cover the necessary expense. The Mexican Representative said that the United Kingdom communication suggested to him that the addition of a medical expert to the mission might be advisable. The President deprecated this on the grounds of expense. He recalled that no medical expert had been included in the mission to Brazil, where considera- tions of health had been equally important. A questionnaire had been drawn up for the guidance of the mission, and this procedure could again be adopted. In the case of Brazil, the mission had been able to form an opinion regarding health conditions. He felt sure, moreover, that the British medical service in British Guiana would give every assistance, and would provide material on which the membeis of the mission though not medical experts themselves—could form a reliable opimon. The mission must rely to a large extent on information provided &gt;y e local administration, and its main object, after all, was to see whether general conditions were such as to be likely to suit the Assyrians. The French Representative raised the question whether the Nansen Office should be represented on the mission. mio-ht bp till 1 '+ n r this suggestion certainly deserved consideration.

He^eca’lIId 8 tin!t't of the procedure adopted HP The United Kingdom Representative supported this proposal, and expressed the view that it would be advisable to see whether any agricultural expert of international repute were immediately available in Europe, so that he could have the advantage of consultation with the committee before proceeding on the mission. The possibility of such consultation might outweigh the disadvantage on the grounds of expense.

At the next meeting of the committee the secretariat would present the -thecoll names of likely candidates for attachment to the mission in the capacity of seeding dj agricultural expert. ie disadij The President then proposed the examination of the French Government’s note. In many respects the problem which that note presented was similar to the British Guiana scheme. Certain details, however, were different or less i 1 the comig sharply defined, and he himself found it difficult at the moment to pronounce on 3 Asseijl the question as to whether a mission of investigation should be sent out at the present stage, as suggested by the French Government. He would, in the first n ] vt ^, place, like further information, and he suggested that the French Government might furnish it under the headings contained in the questionnaire by which the mission to Brazil had been guided. 11,1 r!lb ' In reply to a question from the President, the French Representative said that a great deal of detailed information was available at the Quai d’Orsay, and he would do his best to obtain it by telephone. conuniiffi® The President said that, in view of the urgency of the problem, there was a ission dim good deal to be said for sending two missions simultaneously, one to British Guiana and one to French West Africa. He proposed, however, that the committee, before taking any decision, should await further details of the French l e recai ; : scheme. The question of personnel might also present difficulties. been di® The Italian Representative observed that a careful investigation seemed all ieadoptei the more necessary as the French Government were apparently only prepared at igardingH present to contemplate an experimental settlement of a few families.

I he French representative had helped to overcome a similar condition laid down by the Brazilian Government, and he felt that he would be all the more able to overcome the scruples of his own Government. He agreed, however, with the view of the Italian representative. The Danish Representative found the French proposal for an experimental rfffil nt mos ^ difficult part of the scheme. The French note spoke of the | culties of acclimatisation, and expressed some doubt as to whether trans- p antatiqn of the Assyrians would be successful. It seemed to him that many years might be needed for an experimental period. It was possible that the emigrants might thrive in the first two years or so, and that their energies might ag aiterwards. Perhaps it might be possible to find volunteers among the ssyrians who would go to French West Africa at once as an experiment, without any preliminary investigation. m was expressed by various representatives as to whether the committee nid take the responsibility without much more careful examination of sending II volunteers, even if they were forthcoming. The President expressed the view that as a first step a mission of investigation s an absolute necessity. In the absence of such a mission the responsibi i y thn a comm i tte e would be too great. But he repeated that before deciding on of Q ^ eS ^ atc k of a mission, further details were desirable regarding : (1) the chance aptation by the Assyrians; and (2) the economic basis of the French p an. The French Representative said that he would certainly obtain further Is, but he did not think that this would meet M. Borberg s point aboi omental settlement. [231 a—2] b 2Thoffii M Olivan said that he himself did not like the idea of an experiment. If the experiment turned out badly, and the first batch of settlers either died of or had to be transferred elsewhere, the committee would bear a heavy responsibility. The United Kingdom Representative said that he thought a mission of investigation absolutely essential as a first step before any settlement took place, even on an experimental basis. He hoped, however that if the report of the mission were satisfactory, this would lead the French Government to reconsider their attitude regarding experimental settlement. It seemed to him that the obiect of the mission must be to establish definitely one way or the other whether the Assyrians could be expected to thrive in the area m question. M. Borberg had already pointed out the time difficulty as regards any experiment, and it would be recalled that the same point had arisen in connexion with the Brazilian scheme. The Assyrian problem in Iraq was acute and called for the early removal from Iraq of all the Assyrians who wished to go. The committee had been obliged to indicate to the Brazilian Government that the experimental settlement of a few families would offer no solution to the problem with which the committee was faced. Quite apart from the time factor, an experiment raised the question of repatriation, and from the political point of view it was fairly clear that there could be no question of repatriating to Iraq any of the Assyrians who elected to leave the country. j&amp;W' 1 The Danish Representative expressed doubt whether a mission of investi gation would serve any useful purpose.

White labour had never been introduced into the area concerned, and the French Government did not know how it would work. The area had been irrigated, with the result that cotton was being more and more cultivated, but the cultivation hitherto had been by native labour. Petitions f rom the Mar Shiniun. The President observed that the Mar Shimun had addressed a number of petitions to the committee since its last session. His own opinion was that these were not worth close examination. The observations which the Iraqi delegation a urnished on previous petitions had shown the Mar Shimun’s previous complaints to be without substantial foundation. Mat first o: agreed to itlissn.

These attacks were particularly stupid and unfair. The Assyrians had, in fact, a great deal to thank Major Thomson for, and, in trying to carry out an unwelcome settlement scheme in 1933, and more rece ’ n tly, in advising the Assyrians to return to their villages and cultivate, Major Thomson had merely been attempting to put into effect, in the first place, a resolution of the League Council, and, in the second place, a message drawn up by the Assyrian Committee of the Council. This was perfectly well known, but the Mar Shimun chose to ignore the facts. It was agreed that there should be no change in the procedure, whereby the Mar Shimun’s petitions were circulated to members of the committee and sent to the Iraqi delegation for observations. Reports of the Iraqi Government. The President stated that regular reports on the situation of the Assyrians had been received up to and including the month of August. Moreover, the special points on which the Iraqi delegation had been asked for further informa tion (see C. Min. Ass. 43), had been answered by the Iraqi delegation in a manner which M. Olivan considered generally satisfactory. Internees in Syria. The President expressed the thanks of the committee to the French Govern ment for their efforts in carrying out with the Iraqi Government arrangements for transferring to Syria the families of those Assyrians who were interned in French mandated territory in August 1933. He asked the French representative whether he had any observations to make on this subject. The French Representative said that the French High Commissioner in Syria had reported that the movement of the families of the internees into byria had been completed on the 10th September. This was the result of fairly long negotia tions, the chief difficulty in which had been the question of finance. The Iraqi Government had at first only been prepared to pay a sum of £2,000-£3,000, but had eventually agreed to pay £10,000. The actual cost of settlement, however far exceeded this sum. The French Government had thought it best, in view of the uncertainty which existed as regards the time which the families would spend in Syria, to settle them on the land in villages where they could become self- supporting, rather than to keep them in camps as had been done in ^ scheme of settlement had therefore been worked out by M. Burnier !. oc f a Nansen Office representative—which it was estimated would cost 3,400,000 fr. It was clear that the difference between this sum and the payment made by t e Iraqi Government could not be borne by the Syrian budget, M 110 ® was n ?i directly concerned with the Assyrian question, and he thought that there wou be criticism, not only locally, but from the Mandates Commission if any ^ were made to place the burden upon Syria. In the circumstances, he thoug a it would be best to insert in the committee’s report to the Council a formu a o the effect that the difference between the sum paid by Iraq and the estima e cos of settlement should be eventually refunded to the Syrian budget by t e eag of Nations from the final Assyrian settlement funds. The French representativ added that the French Government reserved the right to claim pnori y or inclusion of the internees in Syria in any final Assyrian settlement scheme. r/te United Kingdom Representative asked for information regarding the sum mentioned by the French representative, namely, 3,400,000 r. wprj lepresent the cost of the temporary settlement of the internees, or was on the hypothesis that they might remain indefinitely in Syria a ® ’ rpDr C an estimate for their permanent settlement there? The Lmted mg nlirp i v sentative understood that the negotiations with Iraq had been ^rvrpiy dement, and that the sum paid by the Govern ^ e p ifsvGans ,000 dinars, was intended to represent the cost of mamta.mmg N, t or a certain period, namely, six months or a year, on the basis o 0 tlieir maintenance in Iraq. ( TP French Representative regretted that he did not kiiow wliat ’jj' 6 68 . , 3,400,000 fr. represented. The French High Commissioner had simpiyho* reported that settlement would cost that amount and he did not know how it was made up, or on what basis it had been calculated. Thp President sa id that he understood the French proposal to be that one Ike t'resiaeru sa , t t j, e Council should be concerned with the section of the committees report to tne difference between transfer of the internees, and should point out that tne mnerence oetween M Burnier’s estimate and the sum paid by the Iraqi Government would have to be charged to the eventual settlement fund. If, however, for some reason a settle ment slheme outside Iraq for all the Assyrians could not be worked out, was it the'intention of the French Government that the League of Nations should be responsible for the sum in question? The French Representative explained that the responsibility might not necessarily lie with the League of Nations. The point was that the Syrian budget was at present being chargld with expenses which did not really concern it and the French Government were anxious that the money should eventually be refunded from other sources. Li Sec^ The Danish Representative observed that this was the first time the matter had been mentioned officially. He asked whether the committee or the Council could take the responsibility of accepting the charge named, and whether even the Assembly at this late date could do so. The President said that in loyalty to the French representative he must state that the French delegate had consulted him a little time ago as to whetner to raise this point in the appropriate commission of the Assembly. The President had recommended him not to do so. He therefore bore a certain personal respon sibility, which he fully accepted. The Danish Representative observed that the question was not a simple one. He understood that the sum mentioned by the French representative was for the development of the area in which the internees were being settled. It represented the cost of irrigation, buildings, &amp;c. This development would be of some advantage to Syria, and in calculating what sum should be refunded to the Syrian budget attention must be paid to the permanent value to Syria of the work undertaken. The President thought that the committee must, in the first place, recognise that the French Government had helped to solve a difficult problem. In his view they might be entitled to a refund of some part, at all events, of the expense to which they had been put, but the point which chiefly concerned him was what would happen if there was no Assyrian settlement fund from which a refund could be made. It was possible that there might be no settlement scheme or that there might be difficulties about the financing of any settlement scheme. The question was whether in such a case the League of Nations would have to take the responsibility of any refund to the French Government. The United Kingdom Representative said that the committee as a whole would certainly be grateful to the French Government for having solved this tire some problem of the internees. He was, therefore, all the more reluctant to give any appearance of criticising what had been done. At the same time the present French proposal raised an important question of principle. The committee had been given to understand that negotiations were being conducted directly between Iraq and France for the temporary settlement of the families of the internees. It now appeared that instead of settling the internees in a temporary manner, the French Government had decided to take the risk of settling them on what might be called a permanent basis. They had done this, however, without consulting the Council Committee in any way, and the Council Committee had had no opportunity of examining the scheme, and, more particularly, the estimated cost. It seemed rather difficult, therefore, to expect the League to assume the respon sibility for an operation over which it had had no control. The French Representative observed that the scheme had been worked out and the estimates prepared by the representative of the Nansen Office, which was an accredited organisation of the League.7 r It was pointed out, however, by M. Arocha and by the United Kingdom Representative that the French Government had merely asked for the services of M Burnier in order to control the entry of the internees into Syria and to keep the accounts once they had arrived there.. It was this limited task which had been given to M. Burnier, and it had been made clear in writing to the Nansen Office by the League Secretariat that M. Burnier had no authority to go beyond this limited task. The French Representative said that he appreciated the points which had been raised, and he would like to consider the matter further in the light of them. It was agreed that the discussion should be continued at a later meeting. !)’ migki Dncenit,! Geneva, September 27, 1934. J. C.

United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, September 28, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Assyrian Question. Record of Thirty-fourth Meeting of the Assyrian Committee held on September 26, 1934, at 10 a.m. THE committee had before it a draft report to the Council. The President said that, before examining this in detail, there were two general observations which he wished to make. In the first place, he thought that the idea should be developed in the report that the committee was impressed by the urgent need of a solution, and that the fact that it was sending out commissions of enquiry which would need a certain time for the accomplishment of their task did not mean that it had overlooked considerations of urgency. The other observation concerned the Mosul camp. In this respect the report needed to be completed after a discussion with the Iraqi delegate, who had been asked to attend the meeting at a later stage. He proposed to tell the Iraqi delegate that the committee had taken note of the suggestion in the Iraqi delegation s letter of the 31st August that the closure of the Mosul camp was under consideration. He proposed then to recall the previous statement of the Iraqi delegate that the Mosul camp would be mainained until the whole resettlement operation was finished. The French Representative said that as regards urgency the committee mus not let this consideration interfere with the desirability of ensuring that any particular place was suitable and of obtaining every guarantee against t e Assyrians being thrown from one uncertain situation into another. The President thought that the despatch of missions of investigation showed he committee’s preoccupation on this score. His wish to insert a passage a ou he urgency of the problem in the report was to forestall criticism, w 1C ^ anticipated from a section of public opinion, to* the effect that the commi ee y sending out commissions was simply wasting time and postponing a c ecision. The United Kingdom Representative asked the committee to consider very carefully what should be said to Jafar Pasha on the subject of the Mosul ca p. 1 was quite true that Taufiq Beg Suwaidi had, in January last, given ^ surance that the Iraqi Government would maintain the camp mM 1 e s i u e peration had been completely carried out.

The discussion, at this point, was postponed until after detailed consideration ° f * The r draftre'port was accepted in principle, it being left to the Secretariat to complete it in two or three particulars. The discussion regarding the Mosul camp was then resumed. The United Kinqdom Representative said that the mam argument tor the closure of the camp Was, in his view, not the financial one since any alternative scheme would presumably cost money, but the doubt whether maintenance m a camp was in the interests of the Assyrians themselves. It had undoubtedly a pauperising and demoralising effect. On the other hand, it would be, perhaps, unfortunate if the camp were closed at the present stage, when fresh prospects of settlement outside Iraq had just come to light. It was certain that H tM Assyrians were moved from the camp into the villages, many of them would go unwillingly and the committee would be bombarded with petitions. There was certain, in consequence, to be an agitation by the Assyrian sympathisers and the issue of settlement was likely to be obscured. The Danish Representative expressed the view that the committee ought to' recommend the maintenance of the camp at least until the results of the missions of investigation were known. It would be better, in any case, if the camp was maintained during the coming winter. The President then outlined the statement which he proposed to make to the Iraqi delegate based on the various considerations which had been put forward. Jafar Pasha, accompanied by M. Shabandar and Major Edmonds, then joined the meeting. The President informed Jafar Pasha that committee had received communi cations from the United Kingdom Government and the Prench Government respectively, regarding the prospects of settlement in British Guiana and Trench West Africa. The committee proposed to take all necessary measures to see before any decision was reached that the conditions in the territories concerned were suitable for the Assyrians. They proposed to proceed as in the case of Brazil and to send missions of investigation. After obtaining all necessary guarantees in this way, they would make recommendations to the Council. 1 he President then thanked the Iraqi delegate for the information contained in the situation reports which the Iraqi Government had submitted periodically and which the committee had carefully studied. There was one report which called for observations, namely, the letter of the 31st August. That letter stated that an agreement had been reached with the French Government for the transfer to feyria of the ramilies of the Assyrian internees in Syria. The committee wished to congratulate the French and Iraqi Governments on the happy outcome of these negotiations. In the second place, the letter stated the intention of the Iraqi Government to appoint a Ministerial Committee to study the possibility of closing the Mosul camp and to find some more practical arrangement. The reasons given for the mosure of the camp were that the numbers of the refugees in the camp had been reduced as a result of the agreement with the French Government, and that the Council Committee was evidently finding it impossible to discover a place of settlement outside Iraq. As regards the second reason, the situation had now changed, and m view of the fresh possibilities which had been opened up, re commi ee wished to know whether the Iraqi Government would persist m its intention to close the camp or would reconsider the question.

Till pathisersiil its of theri eceived ^ inch« jiana aneK measai-1 'matioi ittedPf Jafar Pasha said that the Iraqi Government had set up the camp to help the Assyrians in a spirit of goodwill and in accordance with the promises which it had made regarding the welfare of the Assyrians. He wished to emphasise that when the closure of the camp had been considered there was no intention what ever of pushing the inhabitants into the desert. Some 800 persons still remained in the camp after the transfer to Syria of the families of the internees; some of them had relatives in villages, and it was proposed that they should be settled with these relatives and given sufficient money for their maintenance for four or five months. Others who had no relatives the Government proposed to assist from time to time. When the camp had been set up it was expected that settle ment outside Iraq would take place within a few months. Maintenance in a camp was then regarded as the most economic and suitable method of looking after the Assyrians. Unfortunately, however, camp life had a demoralising effect. Moreover, there were Assyrians outside the camp who were jealous of the special measures which were taken for the maintenance of the inhabitants in the camp. The closure of the camp was in any case only a proposal. It had not yet been put into effect. A committee had been formed to study the question, and Jafar Pasha could not say what the attitude of the Iraqi Government would be in the new circumstances created by the offers from His Majesty's Government and the French Government. He would refer the point to his Government and inform the committee regarding their attitude as soon as possible. The President thanked Jafar Pasha and expressed the hope that the Iraqi Government would take into consideration not only the new situation which had been created, but also the approach of wdnter. The committee recollected that the Iraqi Government had given general assurances relating to the safety and welfare of the Assyrians pending their emigration elsewhere, and they must leave it to the Iraqi Government to decide upon the particular methods of giving effect to these assurances. At the same time, they hoped that if the Mosul camp were closed, arrangements not less favourable to the Assyrians and not less efficacious would be adopted. If the situation of the Assyrians would, in fact, be bettered by the closure of the camp, then, of course, the committee would be only too glad. The President asked whether any other member of the committee wished to make observations. The United Kingdom Representative said that there was one other considera tion which the president had not mentioned. New hope had been raised by the possibilities of settlement in British Guiana and in French West Africa, and it would be a pity if the issue were obscured at this moment by the complaints which might be expected to follow the closure of the camp from some, at all events, of the Assyrians who would perhaps return unwillingly to the villages. It was a psychological consideration, but the whole Assyrian problem might well be complicated in this way. The Danish Representative observed that the Iraqi Government proposed to provide the inhabitants of the camp with funds for four or five months. is would maintain them at the outside until February or March. Was it possible lor them to cultivate and become self-supporting before they had spen ns money ? Jafar Pasha said that he had perhaps not made himself clear. One section of the inhabitants of the camp had relatives outside, and these rela ives, A 1 whom they would be settled, had means. As regards those mhabi an s o camp who had no relatives, the Government proposed to support them perioc ic ,) until they were dehnitely settled. The. Mexican Representative asked what was the prevailing opinion among omcials in Iraq regarding the maintenance of the camp. Jafar Pasha said that when the question was considered previously preyaffing opinion was that the camp was an unsatisfactory me , i te dlv with the Assyrians. The British and French propositions, however undo t d .y seated a different situation, which the Iraqi Government would certai ^y nsider. In any case the committee might feel assured tha al W to t p e mamtena^ 0 p ^ cam p wou i(i be equally effective and a v ^ ^ ^e &gt; riai ^ It was the wish of the Iraqi Government to do ^ friends. are of the Assyrians. They would look affter them as childrenThey wished to live as brothers with all people of whatever race who were under their rule and living on their territory. The Iraqi delegation then withdrew. The President said that the secretariat was not yet in a position to submit a list of candidates for the proposed mission of investigation to Tritish Guiana. The United Kingdom Representative, in reply to a question from the president, said that he had been in telephonic communication with Brioadier Browne, and that the latter had told him that he was definitely willing to &lt;?o to British Guiana if he received an invitation. Brigadier Browne had certain arrangements to make before he could go, but he said that a maximum of three weeks would be sufficient for this purpose, and that he hoped to be able to* leave by the middle of October. He had also expressed the view that a three months 5 stay in the colony would not be necessary, and he intended, having in view the urgency of the problem, to cut it down to the minimum consistent with a careful examination of the territory. The President said that as regards French West Africa the committee had, at its last meeting, asked the French Government for further information. This information was likely to be a little delayed, but if it arrived during the present session, the question of sending a mission of investigation to French West Africa also would be considered. In any case, the sum which the Council was being asked to sanction was estimated on the assumption that two missions would have to be sent. Will to Hfim.»point iifffltative aid letter from M. Arocha said that it had been arranged for the Assyrian question to be taken by the Council on the following morning if the committee’s report could be ready in time.

Selection of Mission to British Guiana. The President said that the main task of the committee was to select the mission of investigation to go to British Guiana. Before candidates were ngtleprii considered, however, a point of principle had arisen regarding the inclusion or h West 11 otherwise of a representative of the Nansen Office. would te question tsi report coll The attached letter from Major Johnson was then read (Annex A). M. Arocha explained that the conversation referred to in the letter had taken place when Major Johnson had called upon him to ask whether a Nansen Office representative would be invited to join the mission to British Guiana. M. Arocha had replied that he did not think that the committee intended to issue such an invitation. Major Johnson had then expressed the opinion that it was essential for the Nansen Office to be represented. In the report of the Governing Body mention had been made of the continued co-operation of the Nansen Office in this question, and, if the Nansen Office were not represented on the mission to British Guiana, public opinion might take it as in some way a reflection upon the Nansen Office, and might gain the impression that the Nansen Office was being set aside. M. Arocha had said that the committee had no such idea. The co-operation which the Nansen Office had hitherto given was considered extremely valuable, and Major Johnson was evidently under a misunderstanding. M. Arocha had recalled the text of the Council Committee’s resolution of the 31st October last, which made it clear that the co-operation of the Nansen Office would be invited, when a destination had been found and under conditions to be laid down by the committee. In the case of Brazil there were special reasons why the Nansen office should have been represented on the preliminary mission of investigation, us the whole scheme was one which the Nansen Office had produced, and it had been anticipated that its entire execution would be in the hands of the Nansen office. In the present case, however, it was a question of a proposal made by a Government, and it was not yet clear how the scheme would be organised, if it ^re found suitable. Major Johnson would also appreciate the difficulty which e committee felt in sending a mission composed entirely, or in the mam, ot ntish subjects to a British colony. Major Johnson had professed to understand is point, but had indicated that he thought it desirable for some representative u Nansen Office other than himself to be sent out to British Guiana and loi e Nansen Office to co-operate in the whole scheme, i.e., not only m the P r e immary measures but also in the settlement itself, until such ti 1 // 6 as ^ e ssynans had been completely assimilated and all the money advanced to t em nad been paid back. M. Arocha had said that he had no doubt that the co-operation of the Nansen Office would be welcomed by the committee, at all en s ^ or ^Ge preparatory work, but he could not yet say to what exten e services °f any organisation would be required in British Guiana for the actual hnri Se ^ enien .t. In any case the extracts from the reports of the Governing Tnt^’ &gt; ^- ana ging Committee and the Finance Commission, quoted in ajo mrui!° nS etter ’ showed that the Nansen Office, as a body, was not disposed to „ i °]' a ^ e 111 the work of Assyrian settlement until sufficient funds a e scri an d the place of settlement had been fixed.

The United Kinqdom Representative said that he also had had a conversation with Major Johnson, when the latter had advanced much the same views as those which M. Arocha had reported, the United Kingdom repre sentative had taken the line that the committee must consider each case on its merits and adopt the procedure most suited to the circumstances. It was an entire misapprehension to suppose that, if a Nansen Office representative were not included in the mission of enquiry to British Guiana this meant that the committee was dissatisfied with the Nansen Office. Nor did he that Ppbhc j opinion would form any such impression. It was known that the Nansen Omce was still co-operating in the Assyrian question. Appreciative references had, in fact, been made only that morning in the Council to the work which its repre sentative in Syria had done in connexion with the transfer of the Assyrian families to Syria. It was true that the committee had adopted a resolution on the 31st October, 1933, regarding its intention to utilise the services of the Nansen Office in regard to any plan of settlement, but only after a certain stage had been reached and under conditions to be laid down later. The United Kingdom representative had said to Major Johnson that the services of the Nansen Office would, he thought, almost certainly be required in some degree in connexion with the British Guiana scheme, if it were put into effect. For instance, it was contemplated that the Nansen Office should in any case be concerned in the preparatory work in Iraq, and the degree of its further co-operation would be a matter for the committee to decide at the proper moment. Whether the services of the Nansen Office would be required in connexion with the actual settlement operation inside British Guiana was a matter to be decided later. He had felt bound, however, to point out that in the memorandum attached to His Majesty’s Government’s note of the 22nd September, it had been contemplated that the settlement would form part of the ordinary district administration of the colony. But the immediate question was the composition of a mission of investigation to look into a certain scheme and not the eventual means by which that scheme should be executed, if found suitable; and in considering this question, a very material fact, as he had indicated to Major Johnson, was that the committee, since passing its resolution of the 31st October, had been led in various ways to believe that the Nansen Office, as a body, was not anxious to be saddled with responsibility for schemes for the settlement of the Assyrians in such remote areas as South America. The attitude of M. Werner at various meetings of the committee and in personal conversations had made this clear. Moreover, the resolutions quoted in Major Johnson’s letter to M. Arocha spoke for themselves, and Major Johnson, in the last paragraph of the letter under consideration, specifically stated that it was the desire of the Governing Body to refrain from accepting responsibility concerning the choice of the country for the settlement of the Assyrians. Major Johnson, in his conversation with the United Kingdom representative, had again admitted that this was the case, and the United Kingdom representative considered this to be quite conclusive. Ihe President agreed, and said that he did not think it necessary to consider the question further. He did not, however, wish the Nansen Office to have any sense of grievance, and he thought that the best thing might be to keep the president of the Nansen Office au courant with what the committee was doing in British Guiana, so that the Nansen Office might be in a position to co-operate, if required, at any given moment, with full knowledge of the facts In that way, -any idea of a slight could be removed. This procedure was agreed to.3 ) miichtk acncasei es.

The President recalled that it had already been agreed that it should consist of an Assyrian expert and an agricultural expert, and that in the former capacity Brigadier-General Browne should be appointed. For the post of agricultural expert three names were available. The first was that of Signor Guido Renzo Giglioli, who was about thirty years of age, and who had been proposed by the Italian representative. Signor Giglioli was a member of the Royal Colonial Institute of Agriculture in Florence, and had already visited British Guiana as a member of an Italian scientific expedition. The second candidate was M. Krolikowski, who was forty years of age, had been for a long time a director in the Ministry of Agriculture in Poland, spoke French and German well, but no English. The third candidate was M. Auguste Iwanski, who was in the forties, had been agricultural adviser to the Polish Embassies in Paris and Washington, and was at present Director of the Chamber of Agriculture at Vilno. He spoke French and English well. The Italian Representative said that he had ascertained that Signor Giglioli was prepared to proceed to British Guiana at once, if invited to do so by the committee. It was unanimously agreed that Signor Giglioli, in view of his previous experience in British Guiana, should be appointed. The committee then considered the instructions to be issued to Brigadier Browne and Signor Giglioli, and these were eventually approved in the form of the attached letters (Annexes B and C).

The United Kingdom Representative said that it had been indicated to him that, unless the present position were carefully explained to the Assyrians in Iraq, they might, on hearing of the British Guiana scheme, conclude that their settlement outside Iraq was already assured and cease cultivation. This would be disastrous, for, even if the British Guiana scheme were proved suitable, it was clear that only a small advance party at the outside would be able to go to the colony during the present season, since, after the report of the mission of investigation had been received, the wishes of the Assyrians would have to be consulted, questions of finance settled, and many preparations completed, both in Iraq and British Guiana. The season for emigration ended in April, after which the rains began. It was clear, therefore, that practically all the Assyrians would have to remain in Iraq during the coming winter at all events, and many of them might be there until next autumn at least. It was essential, therefore, that they should continue their agricultural life. In the circumstances he felt that the committee would be justified in urging the Iraqi Government to explain matters to the Assyrians in the interests of all concerned, and he had prepared a draft letter to the Iraqi delegate for consideration. After a short discussion this draft was accepted in the form of the letter attached as Annex D. to reM tftM (Jnitert and ^ French West Af mca. The President asked when the further information which the French oyernment had been asked to furnish would be available. The French Repiesen tatm ^id that new documents had arrived from the territory concerned containing a considerable amount of information, which would need ia careful consideration. There were various factors involved, and he ttiougnt 11 no b be possible to rely on the information being available to the commi e until about the end of October. The President proposed, and it was agreed, that on receipt of bhe furthe information it should be analysed and distributed by the Secretariat and t a further meeting should be held as soon as possible to consider whether a mmsi 0f mves tigation should be despatched. Meanwhile, this question remained op • hp t , In to a question by the President, the French said that ought that a mission of investigation to French West Africa [231 d-l] B 2 Xonly two months for the accomplishment of its task The French authorities estimated That it would require three weeks ou the spot and two weeks each way for the journey. The President observed that, in these circumstances, it seemed possible that matters could be so arranged that the report of the mission, if sent, might be available for consideration by the committee simultaneously with the report of^_ the mission from British Guiana.

WITH reference to our conversation this morning regarding the co-operation of the office in the settlement of the Assyrian refugees of Iraq, the following are the references to that question in the report of the Governing Body to the Assembly :— “ The close and active co-operation of the office has been invoked by the Assyrian Committee of the Council appointed to consider the question of the settlement outside Iraq of the Assyrians, who might decide they could not settle permanently in Iraq, following the conflict between Iraqi and Assyrian forces in the summer of 1933.” Extract from Resolution adopted by the Assyrian Committee in October 1933. “Finally, it decides that, once a destination has been agreed upon for the Assyrians who wish to leave Iraq, the task of preparing and executing plans for the transfer and settlement of these Assyrians shall be entrusted, under conditions which will be defined later by the committee, to the Nansen Office, working in close collaboration, through the League Secretariat, with the Council Committee.” * # sSf “At the request of the Council, it (the committee) decided to consider the question of finding elsewhere a suitable home for the Assyrians, and, in response to its request, the office will continue to afford its co-operation to the committee for the examination of settlement proposals which may be brought to its attention.” The above extracts are taken from chapter IV (1) (b) of the report of the Governing Body (document A.12.1934).

I HAVE the honour to inform you that the Council Committee for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq to-day decided on the composition of the proposed mission of investigation into the possibilities of settlement in British Guiana. Considering that this mission should consist of two persons, one possessing special knowledge of the Assyrians, and the other an expert knowledge of agricultural matters, the committee decided to appoint Brigadier-General J. G. Browne, C.M.G., C.B.E., D.S.O., who is already known to you. and Signor Guido Renzo Giglioli, a member of the Royal Colonial Institute of Agriculture in Florence. 2. A decision regarding the despatch of a mission of investigation to French West Africa will be taken after consideration of further information regarding that territory, which the French Government has been asked to furnish. 3. The Iraqi Government will no doubt consider it desirable to make an eaily announcement to the Assyrians on the subject of the fresh efforts which are being made to find a place of settlement for them outside Iraq. While it is for the Iiaqi Government to decide upon the nature of such an announcement, it is natuially to the interest of all concerned in the solution of this question to guard against any misunderstanding of the position which might lead to premature conclusions or exaggerated hopes. 4. The committee accordingly desires me to suggest the advisability of making it clear to the Assyrians that investigations into the possibilities of settlement m British Guiana and m French West Africa are still only in the pie immary stage, and that, although the committee is doing its best to expedite ma ers an opes that its efforts may eventually be crowned with • success, the n °^ und . er fi co ' slde l ration have yet to be proved suitable for Assyrian settlement and no definite scheme of settlement is yet in being. of thp A^ ac , t ’ f^Tar to that which existed when, in my letter communiratinn^n^V A orwarc * e ^ to ^ Iraqi permanent delegate a message for auXrGp Hp Tr h r Assyrians; and the committee is therefore quite willing to to inform it ^ Govei ?nient, should the latter consider it desirable to do so, message still holds good ° f “ COmmlttee s vlew that the advice contained in that reaffirming tbisbdvik SUre ’t^ nneCe , SSai •'I Jo1 me to ;| dd that the committee, in to take alf nossihlf C0ntl 7 es *° rel ?, “pdcitly upon the Iraqi Government and for the^naintenanop S nf eS t v/iT 6 y ~being and protection of the Assyrians a ia toi me maintenance of stability and order in the areas whprp tW mav reside until emigration shall be possible* n th } } Refcn ll I have, &amp;c.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT , / .

Report ~by the Committee to the Council. — (Received in Foreign Office, October 1.) ON the 5th June last, the Council Committee for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq was obliged to report to the Council the breakdown of the plan for settlement in Brazil which it had been pursuing up to that time. The Council, after considering, on the 7th June, the situation resulting from this development, instructed the committee to persist in its efforts to find a destination for the Assyrians, and urged the Governments to whom the committee might address representations to give favourable consideration to such representations and to facilitate the solution of the problem in view of its great importance. In pursuance of this decision, the Council Committee at once despatched urgent appeals to the Governments of the following countries in respect of either their home or their overseas territories :— Union of South Africa, Canada. Argentina. Colombia. Australia. France. Belgium. Greece. United Kingdom. Italy. Netherlands. Portugal. Spain. Turkey. The replies of the Governments of South Africa, Argentina, Canada,. Colombia and Turkey are still awaited and the attitude of these Governments s at present unknown. Some of the other Governments concerned have e )bliged to return unfavourable replies to the appeals, though in one case ui - ei urrespondence is proceeding. Meanwhile, however, the committee is g a 0 , ^ ible to submit to the Council the attached notes from the Governments of the Jnited Kingdom and France, drawing attention to the possibilities of settlement n British Guiana and French West Africa respectively. . Such information as is immediately available regarding the ex e f- ls ^ v , . ioncerned in British Guiana is contained in a memorandum( ) a ac e . lote from the United Kingdom Government. In that note, however, ® kingdom Government indicates that, while the area appeals o ave P )f further development as a stock-raising area, its agrieultuia P° ^ _ lot yet been properly tested, and that much further examination wi W G vith particular regard to considerations of health and clima e an P , tgricultural conditions, before the district can definite y D ® P TVincdom uitable for Assyrian settlement. The Government oi t e . , j L an d iccordingly considers that, before any decision is reache , an 11 1 • mpartial investigation should be conducted on the spo un e d • i pj he League of Nations, and it suggests that such an imes 0 '' dmimbilitjof rending noment a mission of experts specially qualified to foim an 'P 1 | necessary d issue, and it proposes to act accordingly as soon as the selection of the necessan lersonnel, which is now under active consideration, has een p fj ie .

( 1 ) Enclosure in September 22, 1934, Section [231 a—3]considering the question further, the committee has asked the French Government for certain supplementary information. Should it decide however m the light of this information when received, to proceed furthei with the scheme at this stage, it is clear that the first step must be an investigation on the spot into the suitability of the area concerned, and the committee would propose to send a mission of experts for this purpose. During the discussions which have already taken place on this point in the committee, the hope has been expiessed that if the report of any mission which may be sent is favourable, it may be sufficiently so to enable the French Government to reconsider its view regarding the necessity for a preliminary experimental settlement on a limited scale. The Council will certainly appreciate that, in deciding to send out missions of investigation which will necessarily require a certain time in which to accomplish their task, the committee has not lost sight of the uigency of reaching a solution of the Assyrian problem. It feels, however, that considerations of urgency should not be allowed to obscure the necessity of obtaining, in the inteiests of the Assyrians themselves, the most complete guarantees as regards the suitability of a particular plan before it is put into execution. The committee proposes to the Council that, in conformity with article 33 (2) of the Financial Regulations, the cost of the investigation in British Guiana and of any similar investigations which may be necessary elsewhere should be met in the first place,, as in the case of the Brazilian scheme, from the “ Working Capital FundA It requests the Council to authorise the allocation for this purpose from the above fund of a sum not exceeding 50,000 Swiss francs, subject to reimbursement from the funds ultimately available for financing the Assyrian resettlement operation as a whole. There is another matter on which the committee is happy to be able to report that progress has been made since the Council last considered the Assyrian problem. After the troubles of August 1933, some 550 Assyrian men remained in Syria, where they have been maintained by the French Government. Their families remained separated from them in Iraq. For some time, negotiations have been in progress between the French and Iraqi Governments regarding the transfer of the families to Syria, and these negotiations have now been brought to a successful conclusion. Under the agreement reached, some 1,400 persons have been transferred from Iraq to Syria and are being installed, with the original internees, in the valley of the western Khabur River, pending a final decision on the general question of Assyrian resettlement. The committee records with satisfaction the successful outcome of the negotiations. 1 here is, however, one point in this connexion which will require further consideration. A note from the French Government informing the committee of the arrangements made is attached to the present report. It will be observed that the French authorities in the mandated territory have thought it desirable not to maintain the Assyrians in question in a refugee camp, but to settle them on the land m villages to be constructed specially for the purpose, so that they may become gradually self-supporting during the period which may yet elapse before a general settlement scheme for the Assyrians has been put into effect. This operation, however, according to the French Government, which bases its opinion on estimates prepared by the representative in Beirut of the Nansen Office, will cos considerably more than the sum of 10,000 dinars paid under the agreement by e laqi overnment, this sum being calculated on the basis of the probable cost ot maintenance m a refugee camp over a fixed period. The French Government wis es to reserve the right to raise at a later stage the question of the incidence T P e ^ lture m volved, which it considers it impossible to charge to the ™ ; he comm i ttee has not been able, in the short time since the note ftu'ther^t one aflt^future^needngs 10n thorOU S h1 ^ and 11 P ro P oses cons]der ll OovelnmenTA! 66 haS “ ntinued . to receive monthly reports from the Iraqi Government concerning the situation of the Assyrians in Iraa The Iraqi coZ“b r t S sAe 0 H ehlC i dated Va T US P° lnts “ this contilxloAon which tSe further details and observations 011 ° f ^ 5th June iaSt ’ had felt bound t0 aSk f ° r obserAf Z SLAs —;z ofs! $r lhe p+TZsr&amp;A s* t the above-mentioned agreement relative to the3 fl 16 s Pot ii|j 'pose A have a J Passed M ■e m lii li intiieiiteK is regards! th article I ish Guiana j 'orkingCafl is transfer of the Assyrian families to Syria. That note observed that the agreement would result in a reduction in the number of refugees at the Mosul camp. It added that, in view of the fact that no territory had yet been found for the settle ment of the Assyrians and of the difficulty which the Iraqi Government experienced in continuing to bear the heavy cost of maintaining the Mosul camp indefinitely, the Iraqi Cabinet had decided to form a Ministerial Committee for the purpose of submitting a report proposing a more practical arrangement. In recent oral discussions with the Iraqi delegate, the committee, while recognising that it was for the Iraqi Government to decide on the particular manner in which effect should be given to its assurances regarding the welfare and security of the Assyrians pending emigration from Iraq, felt bound to express certain considerations which it hoped that the Iraqi Government would take into account before coming to a decision on the question of the closure of the Mosul camp. The Iraqi delegate on his side explained the reasons which had prompted his Government to review this question. He was not in a position to say what attitude his Government would now adopt, in view of the fresh possibilities which had just been brought to light of finding a place of settlement outside Iraq. He promised, however, to enquire and inform the committee of the result as soon as possible. He also undertook to communicate to his Government the considerations which the committee had put forward, and he added that the committee could, he felt, rest assured that, if it were decided to close the Mosul camp, the alternative arrangements would be equally efficacious and advantageous to the Assyrians, for whose welfare the Iraqi Government desired to do its best.

Geneva, September 24, 1934. IN a letter dated the 11th June last, you were good enough to ask the French Government to give its favourable consideration to the possibility o receiving the Assyrians of Iraq in the oversea territories under its rule. In reply to that communication, I have the honour to inform you that re Government of the Republic has given its closest attention to the question o e possible settlement of the Assyrians in those oversea territories. From the investigations that have been made, it appears that the settiemen of some Assyrian families might be contemplated in the bend of the Mger. e problem of an Assyrian immigration into the Sudan, however, cabs or very careful consideration, because regard must be paid to the question o eii acclimatisation and adaptation to the severe conditions of labour w i' agucultnre in the tropics involves for all colonists of the white lace, instance, to what extent will the Assyrians, however accustomed they may oe to rur al Jife, react against malaria ? Moreover, experience would seem to s ow an individual cannot resist transplantation from his original environmen ^ e can find in the place to which he emigrates a diet substantia y e s , • ^ k° which he has been accustomed from childhood. On this pom n mtormation is yet available. • , a That being so, should the experiment seem worth trying on various ^rou , t i e P°licy in this particular case would appear to be to sene a e ^ndan to enquire into the conditions of life, housing and c ima &gt; ' Wnv, a ^ rst Assyrian immigration on the small scale 0 a ® a § reemeil t of the local authorities and the mission of ® 9 N t j ie apoi -116S - WOa ^ sent to such regions as might seem mos sm a- miatisation of persons of white race.It would be only after this initial experiment on which the Governor- General of French West Africa would keep a very careful eye, and on the explicit condition that its results were conclusive, that the despatch of a further, larger batch of emigrants could be contemplated. , , . , In the French Government’s opinion, the method set out above is the only one which would give the scheme for Assyrian immigration into the feudan chance of success. To come to another point, the Government of the Republic feels that the various expenses involved by an Assyrian immigration into the feudan could not be charged to the budget'of French West Africa. The committee for the Assyrians of Iraq would therefore have to consider how to defray, not merely the expense of despatching the mission of enquiry, but also that of transporting the emigrants to Africa, and any repatriation expenses that might become necessary. Furthermore, it is essential to arrange that on their departure from Iraq the emigrants should be given money for the journey and sufficient funds to meet their installation expenses and to provide for their needs until the harvest. Funds would also be required for the very close medical supervision of the new immigrants. Such is the preliminary information which I have thought it desirable to give you, in order to enable your committee to decide whether the idea of settling the Assyrians of Iraq in the Sudan is to be proceeded with. If so, a more detailed examination of the question would then become necessary. For the Minister for Foreign Affairs and by authority: R.

(Confidential.) Government House, Sir, British Guiana, August 20, 1934. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential despatch of the 13th July on the subject of settling in British Guiana Assyrians at present living in Iraq, and to refer to the confidential telegrams which have been exchanged in this connexion. 2. I regard it as a fortunate circumstance that the suggestion to settle these people in Brazil has fallen through, as, prima facie, the prospects of the settle ment of them in British Guiana are favourable. Moreover, the settlement of an agricultural and pastoral community of considerable numbers in the ‘Rupununi savannahs will supply a population which this area of the colony urgently needs; there are no serious objections to such a settlement and I am satisfied that these people will be welcomed by the community as a whole. 3. The area suggested in the Rupununi district upon which these people could be settled and which is indicated on the enclosed map/ 1 ) has an area of 13,110 square miles, bounded as follows : — On the north by latitude 5° north; on the east by longitude 59° west to latitude 4° north, thence along that latitude to the Rupununi River, thence along the Rupununi, Rewa and Kwitaro Rivers and longitude 59° west to the inter section with latitude 2° north; and on the west by the Brazilian boundary. This area is 5,000 square miles larger than Wales and three times as large as Jamaica, and is sufficiently large to accommodate the number who are likely voluntarily to leave Iraq. Of this area 7,875 square miles comprise forest, 4,380 square miles open savannahs, and 855 square miles Indian reservations, which last-named will have to be preserved and excluded from areas available for settlement. The remaining area of 12,255 square miles should easily be capable of accom modating 12,000 settlers and, to meet requirements of two groups, can conveniently be divided into two portions, north and south respectively, of approximately latitude 4° north, each portion containing proportionate areas of savannah an forest land. No difficulty should arise in regard to Indian reserves, which have been u } proclaimed and are well defined and so situated as not to present, so fai as can be foreseen, any likelihood of disturbance of Indians by settlement of Assyrians m fhe adjoining areas. , , 1 K 4. It might be possible to find other areas, but these would pio a y densely forested, involving considerable time and cost in selection and c paring. In this connexion the western portion of the north-western district, whic is i j and well-watered, suggests itself, but is entirely forest-covered. i • ?• The savannah area in the Rupununi district is of a mean eig 300 feet above sea level, rising in the mountainous portions the rami a Nanuku Mountains—to a height of 2,000 to 3,000 feet above sea level. The river valleys in these mountains should be especially sui a e , ment, these having more fertile soils than the savannahs and many s rea I n s giving an ample supply of potable water all the year roun . In the open savannah itself are rivers and creeks which, w en T , J. ^ save ponds—and indications are that additional water can pioba y windmill y boring shallow wells. Two ranchers have such wells, equipped w , water Pumps, which I understand have never failed to give an adequate sup p } E:,“ d s&amp;sssks. »*«. *** *- «r*rr n g&gt; the wet from May to August and the dry from Septembei o p 7572 [10513] q See E 5933/1/93. BThe temperature range is small-from 7l-5° F. minimum to 91-9 0 F. 6 The reports available as to the agricultural possibility of the district based on examination of soil samples alone are not sufficiently comprehensive for a definite opinion to be given, and too much stress should not be laid upon them. Sir John Harrison’s report of 1925 showed seven samples to be fluviatile or riparian, soils of the colony characterised by well-marked potential fertility. If properly drained and skilfully cultivated these soils should yield satisfactory crops of many tropical agricultural products. His repoit on ceitam othei of the samples was undoubtedly unfavourable. 1 n ; , Mr. Follett-Smith in his report (1931) states that it does not appear that a sample typical of the soil of the JE&amp;upununi has been sent foi analysis. It appears, therefore, as is usually the case when one officer collects the samples and another examines them, that there is considei able doubt as to whether most of the soil samples are truly representative of the Ilupununi. I enclose reports, as set out in the enclosed schedule, on the potentialities of the district, and the reports of those who know the district well and who, I consider, are well able to form an opinion appear to indicate that there should be no difficulty in the settlers being able to grow sufficient food-stuffs for their requirements if settlement is carried out on the basis of small holdings. This can, I think, be regarded as the only doubt, although a serious one, as to the area being suitable, and this is one which can be dispelled only by a closer examination of the agricultural possibilities of the district. The responsibility for a decision must rest on those who, being fully acquainted with the requirements of the settlers, make a tour through the proposed area of settlement. 7. With regard to the reported phosphatic deficiencies in the district, the surgeon-general, according to available reports, suggests that, in the ordinary food consumed by the people in the district, vitamin B is lacking, i.e., the £t accessory substance ” which exists in yeast and is present in varying amounts in all natural foods, and is necessary for growth. Diet will require to include provision of such articles as bread (whole-meal), cheese, eggs, fish meats, milk, potatoes, apples, bananas, grape fruit, oranges, pineapples, vegetables, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, turnips, &amp;c. 8 . If, in the light of an actual examination of the area, with particular reference to its agricultural possibilities and the route by which it is proposed to transport these people to the district and the permanent line of communication with the coast (which need not be the same as the route by which they are taken to the area), its possibilities are regarded as being favourable, there is no reason why such arrangements should not be made as will enable the first party to arrive not later than January next. In this connexion, it would be well to note that before arriving in the colony settlers should be vaccinated against smallpox. It may also be advisable that they should be inoculated against the enterica. 9. I note that it is intended that no cost will fall upon the Colonial Govern- re S ar( i f° any scheme of settlement until such time as the new community is fully established and is in a position to take its share as an integral part oif the population of the colony in contributing by way of taxation and otherwise to the general revenue. It is piesumed also that the colony will receive assistance towards the esn ishment and maintenance of social services, such as medical, agricultural, ve ermary, schools, hospitals and dispensaries, police and prisons, as it is highly impiobable that the settlers themselves will be in a position for some years to mee e cos o these services. The provision for the usual administrative and social services should present no difficulty, especially if with the Assyrians there Wm , I ? edlca j men ’ cler H &amp;c., while the former members of the levies may well torm the nucleus of a police force. ff.i'rfflC'.Tvfi ' 011 ‘'kyk administration of the area and of the settlers should nresent °ti the dmirmt administration scheme of the colony would adopt * dl ffi° ult y&gt; and would, I think, be the best and less costly method to members 1 of fhfst°r the T* of distric t administration.

With the information at my disposal at present it is not easy to estimate the exact cost of settling a family of, say, five persons, but, exclusive of ocean transport, I consider that it should not exceed £80 in the first year, this estimate including the building of temporary housing accommodation for each family After this year the settlers will still have to be maintained to a certain extent for a period of about two years, during which time they will be becoming more and tmore self-supporting. An estimate of the cost of maintenance for these two years can be obtained from the cost of the usual Government weekly ration, which consists of 1 lb salt beef, 7 pints of flour, If pints of peas, 1 lb. of pork, 7 sticks of chocolate, 2 lb. of sugar, 1 lb. of salt fish, 3-| pints of rice, and 1 lb. of biscuits. The cost per individual per day of this ration at contract rates in Georgetown is about 13 cents, whilst repacking and transport costs, wastage, &amp;e., on long river journeys, make the final cost double or treble that amount. If the settlers possess cattle and catch fish, which abound in the rivers, the ration should not cost more than 20 cents per man per day, and allowing four rations as sufficient for a family of five persons, some of whom will be children, the cost of food per annum per family will be approximately 292 dollars, or, say, £61, for the first year, and half stuffs for t| that amount for the second year, when ground provisions, rice and other quick- ngs. 11 growing food-stuffs become available in the district. If the above ration is not ike area® suitable for the Assyrians, it could, of course, be varied to suit their taste. minatioarfH 11. With regard to supplying the settlers with a nucleus of cattle and i decision!|| sheep, I would refer to my telegram under reference, and to subsequent telegrams of the sett!; in which I stated that I regard it as essential that the assets of the Rupununi Development Company in the district should be acquired—lock, stock and barrel. These assets consist of large numbers of cattle (estimated at 47,000 head), a considerable number of horses,- also houses and other buildings, which latter could eking, readily be adapted for the use of officers placed in charge of the settlers and these njingaul homesteads could form centres around which to settle families in groups. The mire to iicH ^ ases an d permissions at present held by the company would be cancelled when appeaili is. «r col® t as to #4 at there sti he district n the or sh i ables, calif mth part®; tit is p* they arete ere is noli party tofi the other assets are purchased. It may also be considered desirable to purchase from ranchers at present established in the district some of their better cattle. This should not present any difficulty and the possession of this stock for immediate distribution to settlers would be a matter of considerable advantage and permit of the reduction ol areas at present held by the ranchers under annual grazing permissions. The cost of purchasing the assets of the Rupununi Company has been dealt with in ne telegraphic correspondence referred to, and the price of breeding-stock, if mther numbers are required, runs from 155 . to £1 per head, so that the total cost of acquiring the company’s assets and an additional supply of cattle if ^ary should be less than the estimate for the purchase of land alone under e -Brazilian scheme. In this connexion one of the desirable services would be a s ock-farm under the care of an experienced veterinary officer. Veterinary opinion is that the progress of cattle on the present ranches is at present retarded jaore by inbreeding and lack of care than by any paucity of good grazing areas, a pure-bred bulls will have to be imported, and this will be an important item n cost of this service. The same remark applies to agriculture and onsiderable assistance could be given to the settlers by the establishment of an gncultural experimental station in the district. These are, however, matters aot be decided at the moment, but the sooner the services are established the better. to o hi ? ma y safel y be said, in my opinion, that a suitable area upon which t&gt; -5 . nun iber of Assyrians who are likely voluntarily to elect to come to itm 1811 ^ Ulana &gt; is assured; and as to the welcome they will receive in the colony there can, I think, be no doubt. in j now ^mains to deal in detail with the points which have been raised fan-irw aes P a tch, and with several other matters, knowledge of which will facilitate settlement. 200 s ^ ou ^ welcome, at the outset, the arrival of a pioneer party of, say, youn g mei b an d included in their number should be axemen, sawers, lahnrir erS ’ Jn^banics, and if possible lorry-drivers, along with . ordinary be npo! rS ' T ^ ls P art y would be useful in erecting the base camps which would tbeiT&gt; i SSary ^ rom which to distribute the settlers throughout the area, to erec emporary houses and to put in order so much of the present cattle trai [10513] b 24 south of Kurupukari as will enable families to be distributed quickly and comfortably by motor-lorry. I do not think it would be wise to employ these men on work on rest camps and communications within easy reach of the coastal belt, as there is still considerable unemployment and local labour should, I think, be employed in these initial stages and on the preliminary lines o communication as far as possible; otherwise there is certain to be criticism and an outcry against depriving; local people of the means of obtaining employment, whilst there would be risk to the settlers of contracting malaria and possibly other complaints from native residents or camp followers. This would not apply when once the area assigned for the settlement of these people has been reached, and i should make it clearly understood that within that area all activities would be regarded as providing employment for the settlers. 15 With regard to the type of accommodation to which these people are accustomed it would be of great assistance to me if I could be provided with photographs and descriptions of the style of dwelling. The local style of temporary dwelling usually adopted in the interior is well adapted to the needs of the climate and is constructed from material which is ready to hand. 16. I should also be glad to be informed of their usual necessaries of life and the food-stuffs to which they are accustomed, if these differ appreciably from the Government ration on which I have based my calculations. This will facilitate arriving at a closer approximation of what it will cost to maintain a family for two years. 17. It is presumed that on leaving Iraq each person will be supplied with sufficient clothing to last for, at least, one year. Its cost, and the cost of renewal, can best be estimated by those who have knowledge of the style of clothing these people are accustomed to, but it should be noted that warm clothing is unnecessary. A hammock and a blanket for each person will be necessary—they will be better than cots, at all events until the settlers become established in their permanent homes—and each person should be equipped also with a mosquito net for use with a hammock. If necessary, these can be purchased locally of the type generally used. 18. I am definitely of the opinion that no useful purpose would be served by seeking the assistance of the Nansen Office, unless this may be a condition attending financial assistance from other nations members of the League of Nations. With British officers, with knowledge of these people, this Government with the financial assistance of His Majesty’s Government can without fear assume full responsibility for the settlement of these people. If it is decided that eventually they should repay a part of cost of settlement, it is improbable that the assistance of the Nansen Organisation would be required in this connexion. 19. There is a matter, however, which should receive your consideration. I understand that the Assyrians have their own form of jreligion, and I anticipate that, as soon as settlement commences, a desire will be manifested by the several denominations of the Christian Church to establish missions amongst them. It would be wise to take such steps as will prevent any form of religious denomina tional competition arising. Anglican and Roman Catholic missions are already established in the district, and these would, no doubt, desire to extend their activities among the settlers. I mention this as a matter which should be considered, and, if necessary, such steps taken as to safeguard the settlers from the disturbing influence of contending religious denominations. It would be well also if the numbers of the sexes could be approximately the same, and that no old or infirm people should accompany the earlier parties. 20. With regard to the routes which will be available for transporting the settlers a) their destination, I referred, in my confidential telegram No. 157, to tmy alternative routes, which could be adopted in the first instance, and used for u king the people from the point of disembarkation from an ocean steamer to the upununi district. I consider that for this purpose the second alternative, namely, up the Demerara River to Canister Falls, and then by lorry along the cattle trail to Kurupukari, would be the more suitable. Ocean-going steamers C ? n xT! vltil e ^ s f navigated to Wismar on the Demerara River, and in the vicinity o lus point there would be no difficulty in establishing a camp, to which the settlers would be transferred from the steamer. The advantage of this route over the other suggested is that from Wismar to the Great Falls there are no difficult or f^Tn 0118 r ^ pids -, At Groat Falls, however, it will be necessary to transfer ne sys em o rivei boats to another to avoid the half-mile portage of heavy a fall ^ i&gt; rr Line, t folirtjpej 1 lasted .gSleaisouwi kycatf klierara Hive Igfffewurc yifemar to alt Estimated tti Ifijm. tie cost JiEiist.ttoefore, p!

Between that and Canister Falls there are no rapids, and navigation is easy. The river journey from Wismar to the Great Falls should not exceed, in time, fifteen hours; that from the Great Falls to Canister Falls twelve hours. The question resolves itself, therefore, into the supply of a sufficient number of boats to clear each party before the arrival of the next 'steamer. It is usual to estimate thirty persons, with their kit and provisions, to each river boat, tso that in order to clear 1,500 people fifty boat trips will be necessary during three weeks—the suggested interval between the arrival of the parties. As each boat could make two or possibly three trips each week, ten boats would be quite sufficient for each stage. It is possible also that the service between Wismar and the Great Falls could best be operated with a tug and two or three large barges. 21. The question of finance, however, must be considered in conjunction with the permanent line of communication with the district. If the Demerara River route is selected as the most suitable one by which to take these people to the Rupununi district, a concentration camp will have to be provided at Wismar to accommodate at least 1,500 persons. I am informed that it can be estimated that to provide shelter for families, which would be of a temporary nature, the cost will be in the neighbourhood of 1 • 50 dollars per head; this would cost, therefore, 2,250 to 2,500 dollars. Smaller rest camps would be required at Great Falls, Canister Falls and Kurupukari, and at each camp provision will have to be made for certain services, food and medical supplies, the cost of which will have to be added to the cost of the buildings. Owing to the distance and added cost of transportation of such material as cannot be provided on the spot, the smaller camps will cost, on the average, 1,000 dollars each, and it is probable, therefore, that the concentration and rest camps alone will cost approximately 6,000 dollars. There will be, in addition, the cost of hiring or purchase of boats, motor engines, and possibly a tug and barges— all costly items. I am not at present able to give an estimate of their cost, but am endeavouring to ascertain this; it cannot be less than 7,000 dollars. Further, the District Commissioner estimates that to convert the cattle trail from Canister Falls to Kurupukari into a road suitable for motor vehicles will cost approximately 23,000 dollars. 22 . Thus it appears that in addition to the provision of camps an expenditure of some 30,000 dollars will be necessary in order to convey the settlers to the Rupununi via the Demerara River route. As a permanent means of communication with the district, the best route will be by an extension of the Bartica-Potaro-Konawaruk road in one of the following directions :— {a) To a point on the Essequibo River shown on the map enclosed herewith as Mowasi Landing or some more suitable point higher up river, crossing the Essequibo River by punt, and thence to a point on the cattle trail north of Kurupukari; or alternatively Southward to a point just north of the junction of the Siparuni and the Burro-Burro Rivers, where the Siparuni River will be crossed eithei by punt or a bridge, and thence southward, connecting with the cattle trail south of Kurupukari. From the information now at my disposal it seems probable that the second alternative, crossing the Siparuni, will be the better. One river crossing only is n ® c ® s ^ ar y as against two by the Essequibo route, and indications are that a watei- 8 ed between the Potaro and the Essequibo exists along which the road can be constructed. As the crow flies, these extensions are eacn approximately 50 miles, but it is ao possible until a location has been surveyed to estimate closely the length ox e a ^al extension nor its cost, but working on the basis of 2,500 dollars per e &gt; which has been found to be the average cost of road-making in the interior, e cos of the extension will be approximately 150,000 dollars. A similar es ima e was used m the case of the Tiboku road extension, which is 175,000 dollars for a 18 v ? 06 miles. This can, I think, be safely used as a basis. Members of the Geological Survey are proceeding to examine the Konawaru owasi-Essequibo-Siparuni area, and this party will be able to give some ^? e - • i rma ^ 1011 as to the phvsical features of this area, about which little 01 n g 18 known at the present time. (b)It may therefore be wise economically immediately to examine the possibility of extending the Potaro—Konawaruk road in one of the dnections indicated above, with a view to using this route for the conveyance of the settleis to the Rupununi. The stages of this route would be as follows : By ocean steamer to Bartica, where the concentration camp could be established, then by motor lorry right through to KurupuKari, rest camps being situated near Garraway Stream and at some point intermediate between Garraway Stream and Kurupukari. These camps would cost approximately the same amount as is estimated if the Demerara River route were used, but no boats or tugs would be necessary, neither would the conversion of the cattle trail into a motor road between Canister Falls and Kurupukari, there being thus a saving of some 30,000 dollars. Moreover, all work done and the money expended in the opening up of this route would be of permanent benefit, as this route must undoubtedly be the permanent one to the district, whereas money spent on the temporary Demerara River route would be of no permanent advantage. I suggest, therefore, that these alternative routes be surveyed as early as possible. 23. I am quite satisfied that, as regards transport routes, there is no difficulty in reaching the district. The question to be decided is which of the two routes suggested will be economically the better. An organised plan of transport and provisioning will present no difficulty, and all that will be necessary will be an adequate fleet of lorries operating from Bartica. 24. I suggested in my telegram that Brigadier-General Browne, accom panied—if it is thought necessary—by a civilian officer acquainted with the agricultural requirements and capabilities of the settlers, should visit the colony as soon as possible in order to satisfy you that the possibilities of the district are such as would commend it to the Assyrians as desirable for their future home. I propose, as soon as I am informed that a mission will be despatched, to send to the Rupununi a party consisting of a medical officer, an agricultural officer, a soil chemist and a geologist (instead of a surveyor, as first suggested), which party will be able to make investigations and collect information pending the arrival of the mission. I further propose that Brigadier-General Browne should be accompanied from Georgetown by Major Bone, Government veterinary surgeon, who knows the district well; also by some person who has resided in the district as a cicerone. Mr. Haynes, the District Commissioner, will then meet this party at Kurupukari or Canister Falls, and from that point accompany them. imp 'fitetoAp ^ifttiss« as0] Line towards ill of the tier are spei iijtfistrid T. ftiitoiiigarej ■ MpervisM It is estimated that the cost of sending the preliminary partv to and around the district will be about 2,760 dollars, and that the time occupied will be about sixty-four days. I shall be glad if, when notifying me that it has been decided to send a mission from England, you will authorise the expenditure of that amount as an advance against the cost of the scheme. The mission should calculate on spending at least three months in the colony, and then journey to the district will cost not less than the amount quoted for the preliminary party. ^ Mines 1 ^ 1S connex ^ on ^ enc l° se a minute by the Commissioner of Lands and a • f though opinion generally is favourable as to the possibilities of this district for small holdings, yet I think the responsibility for a final decision must nnfctS s ^ e , on ® 7 lth intimate knowledge of these people.

As it appears imperative for political reasons to move the Assyrians from Iraq as soon as possible, and as the Rupununi district of British Guiana promises to be the only suitable locality in which to settle them; time also bemo an important factor, I submit the following for your consideration From September to April is the dry season in the Rupununi district and |much can be done during those months to prepare for the settlers. If, however, full advantage of this season is not taken a delay of a year will probably result' as little can be done towards settlement in the wet season—May to August, during which months much of the savannahs is flooded, and communication, except by boat, is difficult. The financial position of the Rupununi Company is such that it may be assumed that they are spending little or nothing on 'the maintenance of their assets in the district. Their cattle roam wildly over wide areas and their buildings and fencing are probably suffering from want of upkeep. If competent supervision and money were provided now, much valuable time will be saved and heavy expenditure in the future avoided. During this dry season also, much can be done to improve communication with the district. The road from Konawaruk could be pushed through either to the Essequibo or Siparuni and thence to the cattle trail, the latter being examined with a view to obtaining the best alignment for a road for motor-vehicles, if the present alignment of the trail is not the best possible. Improvement of communication will greatly facilitate settlement of these people. The area can also be examined and sites chosen and cleared for villages near to good land and water, and even temporary shelters erected.

Sir, 26, Oronoque Street, Georgetown, June 22 , 1930.' With reference to my conversation with his Excellency on the 16th instant 01 regarding settlement in the Rupununi district, I have the honour to submit the , following :— Suitability. A selected area near the Government Station at Annai could absorb, at the .least, 500 families. The land is eminently suitable for stock-raising. The soil is arable and productive with natural drainage, excellent for dry farming. Health conditions everything to be desired. Permanent clean water supply. Fish is plentiful—an important consideration. 'g.|g acres of h bfttleirwive likeasilyarrau Settlers. The Immigration Agent-General informed me that there are five East Indians from the Punjab—the soldier caste sihk, who have recently arrived from India, having paid their own passages. The inducements offered to warrant them sitting on the coastlands were not attractive enough. They are dry land workers only. I feel sure that conditions in the Rupununi district would suit them in every respect. To me they seem to be the ideal settlers for the district. His Excellency’s permission is requested to permit me to interview these men with the assistance of the Immigration Agent-General. kfci settlement, h*tie infliiX' , bins. A dvantages. A ready market in the district would be open to these men for farine, corn and beans; farine is the staple food of the district. It is a necessity. I can guarantee to dispose of all the farine these men could produce at 2-50 dollars a basket (approximately 40 lb.). An estimate of their first crop would produce about 600 baskets—1,500 dollars. Corn is scarce and in much demand. This is sold at the same price as farine. First crop 600 baskets—1,500 dollars. There is a certain market for beans, but at present I cannot give prices or quantities. Later on there would be a market for tapioca, starch and tobacco. A hard-working East Indian named Singh, who served throughout the war, has fields near Annai, and his services could be utilised to assist the first settlers. factory rep ■Saidue Disadvantages and Cost. Settlers cannot use the cattle trail until November. On arrival fields have to be cut, houses built, and nothing can be planted until the beginning of next year s wet season—early May—corn and cassava (for farine) are planted in the same field. The corn is reaped after the rains, early September, and can be sold immediately. The cassava has to wait until the dry season of the following year, but during this time another field is cut and planted, and each year afterwards there is always a crop of corn and cassava. (i) (i) The settler has to be shepherded through the cattle trail to his land and fed. ° (ii) On arrival fed for nine months. (iii) The services of Singh for a short period to “ show them the ropes.’ (iv) A temporary shelter whilst they are making their own houses. (v) A supply of corn from the Department of Agriculture.

Twenty-five acres of land. Free title to be given after three years if the responsible officer is satisfied that the land is beneficially occupied, which includes them sending for their wives. The Immigration Agent-General informs me that passages can be easily arranged. Undoubtedly through their communicating with their wives in India information would be spread amongst their friends and relations as regards the inducements for settlement, and one might reasonably anticipate by this means a gradual automatic influx of the better type of East Indian. Conclusion. The East Indian Singh I feel sure could recruit locally the better type of Indian for settlement under similar conditions. I have, &amp;c. D.

A cow, for instance, is presently the equivalent of two baskets of farinha of 40 lb. in weight each, or about 5 dollars m money. 10. There are presently two shops at Mora (the locality m the Rupununi where it is proposed to put settlers on the land). These sell cloth, field imple ments, household utensils (pots, pans, &amp;c.), food-stuffs, and most things that are The nearest shop would be about three hours’ ride on horseback from where settlers will be located. „ ,, A 11 On account of the Rupununi being so far distant from the settled area of the colony, as well as being but sparsely populated, there are no doctors at present in the district. The services of a sick-nurse, however, will be available m case of sickness. The climate of the country is considered very healthy. 12. There is an abundance of good drinking water in the district. Rivers and streams abound and fish are plentiful. The areas over which stock may be grazed are at present practically unlimited. 13. Rice (i.e., wet rice) is not presently being grown in the district, but there is land available for planting rice near by, which is under water from May to September every year. 14. Intending settlers journeying on foot along the cattle trail from Tacama on the Berbice River to the Rupununi must necessarily be prepared to carry whatever goods and chattels they propose taking with them themselves. This in addition to food supplies for the journey. The usual load carried by a man is one of 60 lb. weight. 15. The distance from Tacama to Mora is 180 miles. There are rest-houses along the trail, the stages of the journey being as follows :— jlleitnieft t iiigkjcarti .jlotktagai Jill August IFiatParara ] feig sai, a band 'itikecassai i, Yard, ins; oier some ttJiitoahsb fr® tie 111 to First stage Second stage Third stage Fourth stage Fifth stage Sixth stage Seventh stage Eighth stage Ninth stage Tenth stage Eleventh stage 10 miles to Warinama. 13i miles to Labba. 164 miles to Yawakuri. 12 J miles to Ite. 15 miles to Keleueru. miles to Canister Falls, miles to Kurupukari. miles to First Grassfield. miles to Second Grassfield. miles to Surama. miles to Annai.

I have the honour to submit the following report for the month of August 1931:— il from!®! spared to imselves. rriedljsi ! are rest-ta 101^4 ii is ^ ii During the first six days of the month I remained at Annai police station waiting for the return of my boat from the Rupununi mouth, where I had sent it back for cargo brought up by Garnett’s boat for Bon Success and Annai, some for me, Public Works Department and Police Department, Annai. Whilst at Annai I visited the area I proposed to put in the small agriculturists, and on the 4 th, 5th and 6 th I held successive courts in its criminal jurisdiction. 2. On the 7th I left Annai and proceeded to Eupukari, thence to Bon Success, travelling by cart to Marikanata, thence by boat to Pirara, thence down the Pirara into the Ireng and Takutu rivers. We arrived at Bon Success on the evening of the 15th August. 3. Whilst at Parana I inspected Mr. Hart’s homestead. His machine-shop is driven by a large windmill, and he has erected a steam-engine which obtains steam from a Merryweather boiler. He proposes to use this engine when there is no wind, or when extra power is needed. The other appliances were a circular wood-cutting saw, a band saw, a lathe, a wood-planing machine, one cassava grating mill, and one cassava press. Water was being pumped by the windmill to his house, kitchen, yard, kitchen-garden and surrounding orchard of orange, lime and grape fruit (all bearing fruit), also several kinds of fruit trees. All the useless weeds around the homestead had been replaced by Bahama grass, which was flourishing over some 4 acres. Mr. Hart had also a motor lorry which he had converted into a bus to carry seven passengers and their baggage. Both the steam-engine and the motor-bus are the first of their kind to be brought into the Rupununi district. 4. From the 16th to the 24th I was in office attending to district business and superintending the repairs to Bon Success buildings : — (a) Boathand logie walled in with adobe. (b) Two-thirds of the kitchen wall renewed and new ridge put on. (c) The entire roof of Bon Success house with exception of the main body roof was pulled down and new leaf put on (five snakes came down with the old leaf and were killed). The concrete floor of the house patched in several places. One spare room and servants’ room floors concreted. New office built in south-west gallery, floor cemented, three casement glass windows and one small one put in, one door facing south to admit public and another put in connecting the office with mam building. The whole room walled in with adobe. This puts an end to the public going into the dwelling P a yl oi the building, and allow of the police having sufficient room to do tneir office work when at Bon Success. {d) A small house built in the yard for the saddling. 5. On the 25th I left Bon Success 11 a.m. and proceeded to the Kanaku ountain and Indian reservation. Arriving there I was joined by * aimiel and two other Indians, who took me to the forest on the moun am, yy f mspected the Indians’ experimental field. The rice was doing fine, strong- healthy stalks, as good as I have seen on the coast. The nee plots we large-each about 50 feet square. The first lot had thrown out full heads o u 1 rice and beginning to turn yellow. The second plot planted ear y jus bursting. The Indians were highly delighted over these p ° s- Pigeon peas, and increase (black-eye peas)'were doing well, al so P la ntams ^ bin P J ropose t0 cal1 the whole of the reservation Indians together toplan bl g field next year. The soil on which the field is located is above flood level 18 a dark loam. . ■ 6 - 0n the 28th and 29th August I cut a line into the Kanaku Moun am , g g across a spur from the main ridge between the Ivappi [10513] c 212 named “ Kraswata,” about 1,500 feet in height. Sample of rooks taken forwarded : (a) Rock formation or exposure extending upwards from foot to about 700 feet. (b) Rock exposure from 700 feet upwards to summit (c) Washing from creek gravel. I came to a halt on the head waters of the Kraswata Creek (tributary to INappi), where I could see the watershed, which rose to a further height, apparently about 2,000 feet above sea level. The interior of these mountains appear to me to be gabbro. The washings in the creek bed carry fragments of shale, and rounded quartz pebbles. Test washings indicated diamonds, not gold. 1 returned to Bon Success on the 30th August. 7. The rainfall for the month was 8 inches 87 parts. The creeks above and below this station are still too swollen for travelling, and at some points where it is possible to swim the horses there are no boats to cross equipment and provisions. 8 . Experiments in four varieties of wheat in the Bon Success savannah were not successful owing to destruction by ants, bugs, and too much water on the ground. Nevertheless, that which survived grew to 18 inches in height, gave a full bloom with seed hardly inferior to the original seed sent me. These samples were planted the 1 st' June, 1931, reaped the 31st August, 1931. The results, with samples of bloom and seed, sent to the Director of Agriculture. If this seed had been planted in good soil at mountain foot the results might have been different. I have, &amp;c. E. A. HAYNES. 4 .—Cofy of Report by Land Officer, Rupununi, dated kth November, 1931. Sir, I have the honour to submit the following report for the months of September and October :— From the 1 st to 17th September I was in office, and on the 18th, the creeks having become fordable, I left Bon Success to inspect the Rupununi Development Company (Limited) lease to the south of the Kanaku mountains, and also at the same time visit the Indian settlements in that part of the district. On the 20th I attended a round-up of horses at Dadanawa. Some 200 were brought in, several were half-bred horses, well built, with good bone; the results of the imported stallion. A rancher, who was present, bought one to improve his stock. Next day accompanied by Mr. Turner, the manager of the Rupununi Company (Limited), I visited Sand Creek or Katiwau Indian Reservation, where I commenced a rough compass survey of the reservation. This survey I completed on the 25th and left for Whichabi. On the 2bth I rode out from Whichabi into the area lying between the cattle trail, Kanaku Mountains, and the Rupununi River. There I saw about 1,000 head of cattle, a great many being half- and quarter-breed Herefords belonging to the Rupununi Development Company (Limited). I returned to Whichabi the same day. at W' on the 27th September, I started a survey of 50 acres, for oolh q Melville, M.P. 1379/24, completing same on the afternoon of the 28th September. On the 29th September I left for Dadanawa and resumed the inspection of tne company s lease and making and examination of their books. lire 30th September, accompanied by Mr. Turner, I visited their paddocks and also saw a new paddock m course of construction-only about a mile remained to effect a closure on about 50 square miles. Mr. Turner returned to Dadanawa, and the Ranger and I continued south to an outstation on the Wariwau, about riu the i SOUth ' eaSt 1 of Here the company had a paddock 1 ivfncr e ’ ^ cori ^ one house.

Here another paddock 1 mile square’ corral and house had been erected. Three families of Wapisiana lived on the spot, the head man being in charge of the station. All the low-lying land or flats from Dadanawa to the Wariwau Creek were I closely grazed. The hills were covered with old grass and practically untouched F The flats formed about 25 per cent, of the whole area. Several small herds of cattle were seen among the hills, but only a few could be approached close enough for inspection. Some of the horses met were absolutely wild and cleared off at half a mile. On the other hand, I was able to get close to some good horses with half-breed stallions, also a good many fine bullocks. A great number of old cows were seen that should not be allowed to breed; this might have some bearing on the poor quality calves complained of and not overstocking. On the way I climbed a hill some 250 feet high and had an excellent view of the surrounding country. On the 2 nd I left Out-Station No. 2 and travelled south at an average distance of about 3 miles from the apparent bush edge. (This forest is broken into islands of ,bush and savannah. Looking at it from the open savannah it appears to be one unbroken line of forest, but this savannah and forest extends some places to 7 miles in depth.) Visiting the Indian villages and settlements, starting at “Shea,” and camped for the night at a settlement on the right bank of the Wariwau Creek at 5 p.m. Next day I rode down the right bank Wariwau back to the Out-Station No. 1 , visiting on the way one Indian settlement, on the right bank, and another on the left bank, near the Out-Station. On the 4th I left Out-Station No. 1 and rode to the south-east, thence south, thence sonth-west along the line of Indian villages to the last one in the open savannah, right bank Rupununi, camping at 4-45 p.m. All the Indians I saw and spoke with were well and contented, had no complaints. Only one man remarked to me that £ £ the Government were taking every care to educate the black children on the coast whilst their children were being brought up like hogs for want of proper schools.” (This was interpreted to me by the Ranger.) The upper half of the savannah, right bank Rupununi, or that portion lying between the Wariwau Creek and towards the source of the Rupununi, did not contain many head of cattle. The flats and hills were ungrazed, and only in the vicinity of the Wapisiana villages I saw a few head of cattle and signs of the grass being grazed. It appeared that very few company cattle existed in this section; the last I saw were in the close vicinity of the Wariwau Out-Station No. 1. On the 5th October I crossed the Rupununi River in the open savannah (about 1 mile from the bush line and about 15 miles from its source). After an hour s ride from the village we turned north and rode toward Out-Station No. 3, passing through on the way one Indian settlement, and reaching the out-station on the Taweiwau about 2 p.m. This station had a paddock 1 mile square, large corral and a house, also another house belonging to the Indian who was in charge of the station. On the 6 th I continued down the left bank Rupununi, and on the way I saw ^eral small herds of cattle at close range, very excellent cattle in pink of con- hon, and in every herd were half and quarter-breed Hereford bulls, calves and 11-grown animals. An average distance of 2 miles inland from the river right 4 0 ri'^ a( ^ ail . awa was c l° se ly grazed in the flats and portions of the hills. Arriving Whichabi I camped for the night and on the 7 th I left, riding along the Ixana m mntain foot. A few scattered head of cattle, of which a fair number vyas ha d quarter Hereford, were met as far west as 15 miles of the Rupununi Liver, mnce no company cattle were seen, only a herd of animals belonging to e ikusi villages by the Kanaku Mountains. I returned to Bon Success on the i October at 11 a.m. From the 9th to the 16th I was in office attending to head office correspon- jice, &amp;c. I also attended a meeting of the cattle ranchers on the 14th, w ic W at my quarters. On the 17th I left Bon Success to resume the inspection oi \ Fupununi Development Companv’s lease lying between the Rupununi an kntu Rivers. ' . , On the 19th October I crossed the Sawariwau River and camped for ye “ig Sand Creek Indian settlement to the north of Kusad Mountain ; on the way sa y a few company’s cattle (the other cattle seen belonged o n i , ' Hereford strain, and a few really A 1 half-breed Hereford bulls. 1 g14 was merely touched here and there, indicating that the quantity of animals in this area was very small. Mr. Davis, the Forestry Officer,^ who accompanied me, remained at this point with the Danger to ascend into the Kusad Mountain forest. I proceeded onward, passing between the Kusad and Pinnitet mountain groups, came to a halt at Kawariwau Creek in the Upper Takutu Diver. Up to within 10 miles of Maiwau Creek (Duck Creek) I saw a few (very fewW head of cattle of the company, but they were an excellent lot, having the Hereford strain. The grass was hardly touched in this area. In the vicinity of the Kawariwau I only saw Indian cattle. There were several Indian settlements (too many to visit on this inspection) in the vicinity of the Kusad, Pinnitet and Daad mountain group; also along the Takutu. On the 21 st I started on my return journey, as the Indians told me that no company’s cattle were to be seen beyond that point, except in the vicinity of the Tamatun Mountain foot, and that they were absolutely wild. On the 22nd, from Maiwau I rode to Sawariwau, to a point about 10 miles below its source. Thence downwards, following the left bank to 5 miles below Mount Dakaban, where I crossed the river and returned to Bon Success on the afternoon of the 23rd at 3 p.m. Since my last visit of inspection of the company’s lease in 1923 there has been a wonderful improvement generally all round. Better horses, better strains of cattle, especially on the left bank Bupununi Diver. Extensive wiring in of paddocks, improved buildings, more corrals, better organisation and control. Lastly, the good relations existing between the company and the Indians, which did not exist in 1923, due to Captain Muster’s idea that he could drive them into the mountains oh the savannah. In my opinion, half of the area on the right bank of the Bupununi Diver is fully stocked. The latter half practically vacant except for a few hundred head of Indian cattle. And on the left bank Dupununi Diver a belt along the river 30 by 10 miles is also satisfactorily stocked—about 300 square miles—but beyond that the cattle are very much scattered and lost in the area. If the lot were gathered into one spot, another 50 square miles would be sufficient to hold them. The pasturage and condition of cattle are far better to the south of the Kanaku Mountain than it is to the north, and, further, the country to the south is more liberally watered. The Indians (Wapisiana) are more civilised than their sister tribe, the Macusis, to the north, and with very little more help they will be on par or the same social level with the small rancher in the district. Perhaps the Dupununi Development Company might help them by dividing up the control of the company s cattle amongst them, with permission to take milk and an occasional kill. (Ibis will put an end to cattle stealing, and if visited by the staff from time to time to see that they carry out this agreement, the wild animals will all be tamed m a short while.)

St. Ignatius' Mission, Takutu River, Rwpunnni District, September 12, 1931. a I have the honour to submit the following report on the results of the experimental planting of the four samples of wheat: Three samples failed owin^ 1 X regret to say that no success was achieved, to weeds; the fourth seemed not to germinate at all. 2 . The samples were planted as follows In every case two seeds to each hole; the holes 2 to 3 inches deep and 6 to 8 inches apart, running in rows from north to south. Soil.

The Rupununi Savannahs. (Extract.) By far the predominant grass over the whole of the Rupununi savannahs, both north and south of the Kanuku Mountains, is Trachypogon plumosus (Macusi , name, Wan-na). The distribution of other grasses and other savannah plants was ee ' ] 1 r studied in some detail. Three questions are of special interest to the ecologist and may be considered briefly here. kle-peig The first is that of stocking. As Major Bone has already remarked, the whole sago,t)iiil area is greatly understocked. One may ride for days and see practically no sign of grazing save in the immediate vicinity of corrals and homesteads. This is in andyt marked contrast to the savannahs just across the border in Brazil and the still y of oil m more extensive llanos of Venezuela, especially in the States of Guarico and Apure. otwasfc Both the Brazilian and the Venezuelan plains have been stocked for a much longer period than the Rupununi. Save within 10 miles or so of the main affluents of the Orinoco they began with a closely similar vegetation, which has now been very profoundly modified over huge areas, especially in Venezuela. This modifica- tion, which is wholly in the direction of deterioration, is probably due less to gross overstocking than to mismanagement leading to overstocking for certain periods and in certain areas. There are now, especially in Venezuela, hundreds of square miles covered almost exclusively with inedible weeds, notably Hyptis ten days, ill mveolens in the drier plains, and Ipomoea crassicaulis in the hollows. In the red thestfff Brazilian campos of the Rio Branco there are similar though less extensive areas seemed , of Sida sp., a weed which, among others, also takes possession in the Rupununi,, but! so far only in small holding-paddocks and corrals, which are necessarily periodically overstocked. The Rupununi savannahs as a whole are as yet esoil. unspoiled; the vast bulk of their vegetation consisting of a grass, which, while not eminently palatable in its older stages on account of coarseness and toughness, 2 per c® is yet eaten regularly by cattle and must form one of their mainstays. The older r ,settled savannahs of Brazil and Venezuela, however, undoubtedly indicate the JoJ c ^ an g es which may be expected if stocking is increased in the Rupununi any- npoverSI w hnre near to capacity without the provision of fences or other means for the correct management and rotation of pastures. _ The second question is the much disputed one of burning the savannah. This was an old and traditional custom of the Indians for signalling and other purposes long before European stock was introduced, and has become a regular ass ferl practice on both Brazilian and Rupununi ranches, with or without the consent iglitob | and encouragement of the owner or manager. It is a matter of common obseiva- weaf Ton that cattle concentrate from considerable distances on areas which have il' recently been burned, and graze eagerly on the fresh, green growth. So fai as one 3 ’ cano-atbpr fm™ lo nrn mnrlifvinp' and at least under O AJ-WJLU. CCUIUglUcli SLUUy, ULUS UUJLLULLg ID , present' conditions of stocking cannot modify the composition ot the savannan jngetation (which is what Clements calls a fire sub-climax) the elements o w ic i jay bave been accustomed and adapted to periodic burning over a very long peuo o lays ime. There would probably, under present low stocking, be more scrub an ts lays. glass if burninc wpt*p nui r^r-anfiaArl Tt, sterns therefore unlikely, pres f o piuuaoiy destroy large numueib as it affects the tick problem at all, be considered beneficial. [10513] D18 ti As Hensel (Jl A gric. Res., Vol. 23, pp. 631-643, 1923) remarked, after extensive and well-controlled experiments on ivansas grasslands : The last word regarding burning has yet to be written. The results secured, as these experi ments show, will likely depend not only on seasonal conditions but also upon the kind of grasses and other vegetation present. T he results in question showed: (1) That, in the earlier part of the season, there was considerably more growth of. grass on the burned areas; ( 2 ) after four years there were 21 per cent, more grass plants on the burned areas than when the experiments began, while the unburned areas showed an increase of only 7 per cent.; (3) there was a decrease of sedges on the burned areas, and an increase on the unburned; and (4) weeds decrease on the burned areas, and increased on the unburned. “ The conclusion is that studies so far conducted have failed to show that burning is injurious.” (Hensel). These remarks apply, of course, solely to the light burning of grassland. Forest fires, on the other hand, are, of course, always and everywhere injurious, but these are rarely deliberate, save in the tiny patches of Indian provision-ground, where the fire is well under control, and is restricted to the felled or partially felled area. The third question is, what do the cattle actually eat ? The application of the direct method in ecology, so successfully used by Dr. Leonard Cockayne in study ing the montane tussock grasslands of New Zealand, is valuable here, and was employed by the writer, using as subjects the five pack-bullocks which brought his baggage to the coast. The result of this study will be published in detail, but it may be interesting to remark here that several savannah plants not commonly regarded as pasturage at all are evidently greedily eaten by stock. These include the dwarf shrubs Byrsonima verbascifolia (Macusi name, kenamanarare), Byrso- nima crassifolia (maripati), and Palicourea rigida. The last is specially interesting since Le Cointe, writing of Amazonian pastures, mentions a Pali courea among the list of plants poisonous to stock. Chemical investigations would be desirable, but the animals seem to suffer no ill-effects. The Kupununi savannahs form a biological island, separated in every direction from civilisation by vast forests, formerly only traversed by rivers, offering little chance of passage to introduced insect pests. As a direct result, the cultivated plants of the Rupununi are usually free from pests other than those, little serious, which are already indigenous to the hinterland. O The cattle-trail has pierced this barrier in a small way, and additional traffic from the coast will pioyide opportunities for pests to reach the Rupununi. It would be eminently desiiable to delay, this ingress of pests as long as possible, if, as seems probable, it may not be practicable to stop it altogether. Ranchers bringing plants of any spray them before ^sted °f J® of if kind from the coast would be well-advised to leaving; or else bring only seeds. fumigate or Rupununi to Roraima. 1/ ^A -»-v_yGC-LAVvOO VXLll. uxxvy j ( ) Karinambo already forms an unfnrf + plagued with scale-insects attended by ants exce P tl0n to this, in that citrus plants there are seriously ^ n ;i( trees m ff iLiiftTpeswas i.Tfiiai ood ijiaillnieasu 1 Kjjjjil, Anotl ■sides of Pdto PF 1 ' owever, in [lit important iri fieKun imlpsvegi itteiltMeel pf yield.' pstiswstor if Hr spe hist to thee] y.

Bnt even when, furthei north, one traverses almost continuous hmli tropical rain-forest, different types succeed one another several times in the course of every day’s march. In addition to typical mixed rain-forest, there were no fewer than four kinds in which dominance of one species was so nearly absolute that these woods consisted of almost pure stands over considerable areas. Unfor- f tunately the problem of identification is almost insuperable to a traveller, especially as the trees in question were often quite unknown to my Macusis. , Among these pure types was mora, which grows in this region in practically pure stands, as in Trinidad, and far more so than in the British Guiana lowlands. In one such stand I measured a fallen mora 152 feet long to where the main branches, still 7 inches thick, had rotted and fallen away. This tree must have been 200 feet high. Another gregarious tree, occupying smaller areas, how ever, was a species of Peltogyne (purpleheart). A third was a lofty tree with tremendously developed buttress roots, in this and other respects resembling closely a New Zealand Lauretta. The Patamona name for iff is asheroa. A fourth, which covered larger areas than any of the others, showed a curious natural coppice-formation rising from huge elevated composite boles. There are, however, in addition, extensive savannah lands at intervals en route. The most important may be briefly mentioned, in the order in which they are encountered. The Kurasabai savannah is extensive, and is remarkable for a much more varied grass vegetation than the main Rupununi. Among these other grasses are evidently some which form exceptionally good fodder, for I noted “the cattle looked the sleekest and fattest I have seen in the region, with backs reminiscent of Smithfield.” Ichilibar savannah is even larger, but in its western portion at least, is very stony and the pasturage sparse and poor. Further north between Ichilibar and Kerikabaru there are several long stretches of upland savannah, and here for the first time the dominance of the main Rupununi grass is disputed by another species {Paspalum contractual) which frequently covers large areas almost to the exclusion of other plants. This is a definite loss from the ranching viewpoint, since this grass has a conspicuous flower-head but very scanty leafage. None of the savannahs between here and Roraima is stocked. At Roraima itself the Venezuelan Boundary Commission kept a small herd for beef. From the village of Ipisiau, on the Ireng, until we emerged into the upland savannah at the foot of the Roraima, we traversed almost continuous forest. The Brazilian Savannahs of the Rio Branco. return route from Roraima to the Uraricuera and thence, via Boa Vista o the Rupununi again, traversed savannah country almost entirely. In keeping with the successive changes in elevation and geological structure these savannahs showed a much greater variety of vegetation than those of the Rupununi. As one approaohed the Uraricuera and the Takutu Rivers, especially the Rio Branca dsmf, they differed also in being much more heavily stocked; so much so that, as a ready indicated, there are considerable areas in which pasture deterioration has proceeded to its climax in pure stands of entirely inedible weeds (especially Sida lyomwa crassicaulis). In spite of this the types of cattle and horses througn- out the Brazilian savannahs are usually markedly superior to those of the kupununi. The Hamilton Rice-Harvard Medical Expedition was very impressed by the 17 a PIf. va ^ eilce °f deficiency diseases and digestive troubles among the Brazilians tiie Rio Branco savannahs. Thus Hamilton Rice writes that £ ‘ the deleterious ee s of p resen £ ill-balanced, malnutritious dietary are very apparent m tl e generally adynamic condition of the maiority of individuals presenting themselves or medical examination, advice and treatment,' The regular diet consists a mos _ c usively of cassava farine and meat, chiefly in the dried form.

Y^avficum peppers which form such a regular, and to some palates, excessive feature of Indian diet, have lately been proved exceedingly rich m Vitamin C. The Kanuku Mountains. The Kanuku Mountains, which split the Rupununi savannahs into two, are very much less known biologically than Roraima. At their summits from 2 000 to 2 500 feet are a few areas of savannah land showing the same vegetation as that which occurs at similar elevations in the Pakaraimas, e.g., just north of Ichihbar 'The most interesting find in the Kanukus, however, was a large “reef true wild cacao, shown me by Mr. John Melville. Its presence was first pointed out in this region by Mr. John Ogilvie. It is hoped to study this cacao at a later date with &amp; view to obtaining delta on and perhaps assistance in the biological control of cacao pests. .It is curious that unlike the wild cacao examined by the writer on an affluent of the Coppenanie River in Dutch Guiana several } ears ago, these Kanuku trees were apparently entirely free from witchbroom disease though belonging to exactly the same uniform type as the Surinaam trees. They were in fact in a highly flourishing condition, but there was evidence that most of the pods were taken by monkeys, which are unusually abundant in these mountains. yisfito® Lit lai the 'Itecom life their sir rliJJill'iU pdoluiC pi pasture in The Cattle Trail. The cattle trail from the Rupununi savannahs to those of the Berbice is a magnificent piece of work. The main problem still connected with it seems to be an entirely ecological one, namely, to grow pasturage in the holding-paddocks en route, which, on the one hand, will endure during the dry season periodic heavy stocking and trampling, and, on the other hand, withstand during tk whole of the wet season the competition of the forest second-growth. The former is rendered exceptionally difficult by the loose sand which is the predominant soil from Kurupukari downwards. Several of the holding-paddocks were as bare as a sea-beach. It might be suggested that plants other than grasses and the usual legumes be investigated for feeding qualities and palatability, especially those which form common constituents of second-growth forest on the cattle trail or in other parts of the colony. In New Zealand it is customary in certain districts to tide the dairy cattle over bad times by felling and feeding to them the foliage of some of the forest trees, notably Griselinia littoralis, and the introduced willow spp.). On the trail we were informed that where pasture was lacking we could feed the pack-bullocks with trumpet-tree {Cecropia) and turu palm (Oenocar'pus). The former is a common second-growth plant, and it would not be difficult to grow pure stands of it on cleared forest land, where browsing itself would keep it short enough to obviate felling. But we found that only with the greatest difficulty could our pack animals be persuaded to eat either of these plants. Major Bone informs me that considerable patience is necessary to accustom the savannah cattle to this strange food. Under these circumstances, the establish ment of grass paddocks is naturally the only course. The pack-bullocks ate young bracken (Pteridium esculentum) and several unidentified forest trees more readily than the above two plants. In conclusion, though this is not the place to acknowledge the assistance iieely given by numerous authorities and ranchers on the Brazilian and Venezuelan sides, I should like to express my appreciation and gratitude for the §reat and enthusiastic help and courtesies rendered to us by the ranchers of the Rupunum, the Commissioner, Mr. Haynes, the Land Officer, Mr. E. E. Melville, and the Chief and Secretary of the British Boundary Commission. tlle s rasses was kindly made, or at least confirmed, by Dr. A. S. Hitchcock. 1b could t py b river Ii ?

The older settled savannahs of Brazil and Venezuela, however, undoubtedly indicate the changes which may be expected if stocking is increased in the Rupununi anywhere near to capacity without the provision of fences or other means for the correct management and rotation of pastures The Kurasabai savannah is extensive, and is remarkable for a much more varied grass vegetation than the main Rupununi. Among these other grasses are evidently some which form exceptionally good fodder.” Later on, however, he states: “In spite of this, the types of cattle and horses throughout the Brazilian savannahs are usually marked superior to those of the Rupununi.” In commenting on the remarks of Myers, Bone states :— Dr. Myers concludes that the more varied grazing of the Kurasabai accounts for their superiority, but the superiority is due to breed and not to improved pasture. This is a point which should be stressed—the Rupununi pasture in its present condition com carry animals of improved breed; attempts to improve the pasture can follow.” } of tie fc Bone—Sessional Paper No. 6/31 on “ Tour of the Savannahs of the ted wi iti* Rupununi District and the Cattle Trail ”—states :— “ There could be no better introduction to the savannahs, whether approached by river or trail, than Annai during the month of February. Undulating grassland, surrounded by forest-clad hills and a cool savannah breeze, have an immediate invigorating effect. The view from the police camp, two miles from Annai River landing, is one of great beauty, and later, when it is realised that all the rivers and creeks, of which there are many, abound with fish, and that almost any kind of fruit and vegetable can be easily grown, one is astounded that so very little is known of the attractions of the district by coast residents only 200 miles distant. Nature has endowed Rupununi with necessities and luxuries possessed by few other countries. Its many and great advantages have not been described, whereas any minor disadvantage it possesses has been exaggerated. The climate is healthy, the opportunities for development of savannahs and mountains are many; only capital and settlers are required.” V-. itself ^ stnceUH bbiM :f it trees Hy m m [&gt; : least # e tfie4 is obvious that both these writers regard the area entirely from a pasture point of view. Analyses of Soil Samples. Numerous soil samples collected by various Government officers have been sent to Georgetown for analysis. The conclusions of the various officers are given nereunder. Harrison —Combined Court Paper No. 774, ‘ c Analytical Examination of amples of Soils from the Rupununi Savannah District, 1914 ” states : The samples sent by the commissioner, if, as he states they are, truly lepresentative of the districts, indicate that by far the largest portion o t e area is a coarse sandy soil of low fertility, apparently at present suited only to the production of coarse grasses for pastoral or ranching purposes. s very unfavourable physical condition does not hold out any hopes oi its i ea y amelioration by ordinary local cultural methods. Where it is traversed by nv f s and streams and their banks are subject to flooding, the soils aie J and produce a ‘ lush ’ grass after such flooding.

In the discussion he states, inter aha— “ Several of the soils, for instance, those of the Rewa River District, Nos 1 3 and 5 and those from the Rupununi River District, Nos. 7, 8,13 and 14, are fluviatile or riparian soils of the colony by well-marked potential fertility If properly drained and skilfully cultivated these soils should^ yield satisfactory crops of many tropical agricultural products Others of ' them, such as Nos. 2, 4, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 and 20 are of very low fertility and are for all practical purposes more or less sterile. They doubtless would support a sparse vegetation of coarse savannah grass, shrubs and low trees, In common with the great majority of soils from the interior of the colony I have examined, these soils are markedly deficient in their content of calcium oxide (lime), and especially of phosphoric anhydride soluble in hydrochloric acid. It is probable that in these sandy soils minute crystals and fragments of highly insoluble phosphatic mmei als, such as apatite or monazite, occur, but such resistant minerals could have veiy little, if any immediately beneficial effect on the fertility of the soils. I am satisfied that, even in the case of the more fertile of them, it will be absolutely necessary for permanent cultivation to dress the land with phosphatic manures, preferably with slag-phosphate or with substances of similar nature £C The sandy soils of the Rupununi savannahs with coarse herbage growing in tussocks, or even when covered by a short growth of soft grass jlifii David I after being flooded in the wet season, offer a more or less precarious sustenance jaiswoi be ( to cattle allowed to roam over their practically unrestricted areas; but as iforinstana grazing-grounds their value is governed by the depth of the water-table below |i» the soil.

His conclusions are as follows :— mkm “ The laboratory examination of soil samples from the Rupununi District indicates that none of the soils possess a high level of fertility. There are marked deficiencies of lime and available phosphate and in some cases of available potash. The area appears to be better suited to cattle ranching than to the cultivation of marketable crops. It is possible that provisions, vegetables and fruit trees may be grown upon selected areas at the mountain foot and upon the site of the abandoned corrals where the savannah soil has received liberal additions of manure. It would be of great interest to examine representative samples of pasturage collected from different areas upon the savannah.” I y little agri Nave‘fields’ PteowiicoD MtO.'’ p samples of pichsionisi r';®tasp|os] Bone, in commenting on this, states :— The samples analysed by the chemist-ecologist represent the soils found in various parts of the Rupununi District of limited extent, but it does not appear that a sample typical of the soil of the large savannahs has been sent for analysis.” ft?! It appears, therefore, as is usually the case when one officer collects the sample and another examines them, that there is considerable doubt as to whether i * 108 ^ 0 these soil samples are truly representative of the Rupununi.

It is well suited for cattle ?—At times the grass is 6 feet high, and nothing will eat it. The Indians put fire to it, and the deer eat it up as it springs up after the fire. If the cattle were there to tramp that grass down, other and better kinds would thrive. The Para grass only grows near streams, because the other grass chokes it. If the cattle were there to tramp down the long grass, the Para grass would spread. 341. Cattle and forest products are really the only resources which would be gained by opening up the country ?—Not only that, it would give , access to a country which is undoubted auriferous, and it would open up the country. 342. (Sir David Barbour.) Do you think that the beef produced on the savannahs would be equal to the beef produced in colder climates, North America, for instance ?—Oh no, it would only be for home consumption, they might export hides and hoofs and horns. The kind of cattle that grow in this climate would never be able to compete with northern cattle. Further, Mr. Harvey-Read, when land officer in the Rupununi, in a report dated the 26th May, 1930, stated : — lory exaifi®| , { . coiick®®' ^ery little agricultural work is carried on in the district.

The district is even more secluded than is stated, and, if necessary, could be entirely shut off from the Rio Branco district by means of patrols. I have previously given consideration to this matter in case it was rendered necessary by outbreaks of animal disease in Brazil, and in light of experience in other countries with less well defined borders I could see no difficulty. ^ei Communication. 2. At the same time, communication with the Amazon can be made easy. 3. Transport via Manaos to Boa Vista and thence to the Rupununi district should be an easy matter if there were no international complications. Area. rsonally, 4. There are 7,000 square miles (estimated) of chief savannahs—perSv^ V ’| I think the area is very much larger. There are also other areas in the mountains suitable for grazing, but at present difficult of access. Pioneers. ^ 5. I suggest that the first party should be chiefly a pioneer section, made up ot carpenters, blacksmiths and similar artificers, but also containing a mnnD el of agriculturists or, preferably, pastoralists. II Self-supporting Families. 6. A family should be self-supporting when it has a house, garden, a number ot cows, sheep, pigs and poultry. Under these conditions, Mr. Orella, a rancher, now with the Boundary Commission, estimated the cost of Hying for a family of four at 10 dollars per month the expenditure being on coffee, tea, sugar, salt, &amp;c. If cows, sheep, pigs and poultry are provided for settlers they should be - Sll D D (YP t, TH 0* in t.wrv xroo-no ^ ✓d 4 R 4 i i n t • i ii self-supporting in two years, and if imptUed’bulls are' supplied they should 1 * m a position to trade for profit in five years.25 io3&gt; j of Fruits and Vegetables. tystruo^ 7.

Generally, the present settlers are not interested in agriculture because 1 accept there is no market. The cost of transport to the coast under present conditions apable of is prohibitive, and it is easy for them to obtain supplies of corn from Aboriginal redtktfc Indians by barter. By this I do not mean that the savannahs are good agricultural country, but rather that, had it been necessary, the settlers could have grown more crops. Indian Gardens. 11 . The gardens of the Aboriginal Indians on the savannahs are small, but apparently supply all the food required—cassava. ng notes i ® ^ griculture. 12 . The valleys of the hills are fertile, otherwise the Indians would have nothing on which to live and could not use their produce for barter. The Seven Day Adventist missionaries informed me that they had no j { « ( d 1 ® cu ^y dn growing either rice or wheat. When in Georgetown, they were d searching for hulling machinery for the use of Indians. patrols. i light of®' i: Grouping to avoid clash between A griculturists and Pastoralists. 13. When and if close settlement is made, the settlers may divide into groups in the mountain valleys engaged mainly in agriculture, and groups on the savannahs growing tobacco or specialising in cattle or sheep. 14. It is noted that highland country is preferable. In many ways this may simplify settlement. Small groups of settlers might be placed in the hills of the Pakaraima mountains, with grazing lands below, and also in the Kanuku mountains, with grazing on both the north and south sides. yaMpG Water Supply. ea t i ^ There are rivers and many creeks on the savannahs, and judging by die hills 11 ^ 11 va ^ e T s I penetrated there should be no lack of running water m ^ontai jjij: ^ nera ^ Deficiency in Human Beings. 16.

The large flat areas in the Rupununi, that flood over in the rainy season, have never been experimented with to find out whether crops could be grown after the water had taken off, but I see no reason why, with fairly deep ploughing and proper cultivation, it should not be turned into production land. The rolling lands that are covered with sandpaper tree and other scrub trees, are, as a rule, found to be quite good soil, and, with the help of manure, produce vegetables, greens and fruits very well.

Settlement of Assyrians in the Rupununi. —The Officer Administering the Government stated that he had asked members to attend this special meeting to consider the proposals set out in the Secretary of State’s confidential despatch of the 13th July with regard to settling some thousands of Assyrians at present living in Iraq in British Guiana. The Colonial Secretary outlined the proposals and pointed out that the Secretary of State is asking for a preliminary reply by telegram as regards the practicability of the scheme and the attitude the people of this colony are likely to adopt towards it. His Excellency stated that he considered the Rupununi District the most suitable for the proposed settlement, and suggested that an area of about 13,000 square miles (shown on a map before Council) be set aside for this settlement. Access thereto might be by way of the Bartica-Potaro Road to Tumatumari, then by boat to Kurupukari, there joining the existing cattle trail to the Rupununi. An alternative route would be for the ocean steamer bringing the settlers to disembark them at a camp to be built at Wismar, whence they could be conveyed by suitable craft up the Demerara River, but there would have to be a portage a the Great Falls. From Cannister Falls passengers would travel by the Rupununi trail via Kurupukari. From the reports available at present, it appeared a tobacco, scientifically grown, might be established in the district as a crop, am that crops of vegetables, &amp;c., can be grown at the foothills of the mountains. e proposed to ask the Secretary of State to approve of a commission, consisting o j 11 a § r icultural officer, surveyor and the soil chemist, being appointe an despatched to the district, say, a month before Brigadier-General Browne arrives o inspect the area. It seemed to him desirable that some publicity be given o scheme. The present residents of the Rupununi would then be aware ol tne pioposals before the arrival of the brigadier-general and the commission m istrict, and much additional useful information could be collected. ^ ,i • He would be glad of the advice of Council as to whether the P e 0 P le ot H 1 co ony would be likely to offer any objection to this settlement, and as ° . embers of Council were in favour of the matter being discussed in g ouncil upon a message addressed to the Council followed by a mo lon - pntn^ ter -^^ scuss ^ on ’ members of Council were unanimously, unresei X . usiastically in favour of the project, and advised that the ^ ec ^ e ^ J rova q tlr ed that it is considered the scheme is a practical one and his approval saaght by telegram to the matter being communicated to the legislative a 'lew to a motion being passed welcoming the proposals m „They were of opinion that great advantage would accrue to the Colony from the settlement in many directions, e.g., the increase in population, the provision of employment, publicity to the Colony and the money put into circulation. It was suggested that— (a) Every effort be made to secure an equality of the sexes amongst the^ emigrants (one of the disadvantages of past immigration schemes had! been an excessive proportion of males). (b) It is stipulated that Brigadier-General Browne satisfy himself as to the , suitability of the area for the settlement, especially in view of the fact that there is no possibility of any of the Assyrians being repatriated, (c) It be made a condition that maintenance be provided for the settlers for the first two years after their arrival. (d) Funds be provided for a definite number of years from which to meet all current expenses on services for the settlers, e.g., hospital, police (the proximity of the Brazil boundary will necessitate smuggling pre vention measures), prisons, &amp;c. {e) As an alternative route there be considered the desirability of con tinuing the Potaro Konawaruk trail to and along the left bank of the ; Essequebo River to join the Rupununi cattle trail and so avoid crossing the Essequebo River twice.

September 22 , 1934. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. No. 1 . [E 5933/1/93] Sir John Simon to M. Olivdn, Committee for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq. Foreign Office, September 22, 1934. Sir, IN your letter of the 11 th June last you addressed to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, on behalf of the committee over which you preside, an appeal to reconsider the possibility of settling those Assyrians who may wish to leave Iraq in territory under the jurisdiction of His Majesty’s Government, in view of the breakdown of the scheme proposed for their settlement in Brazil. 2. I have the honour to inform you in reply that His Majesty’s Government have every desire to facilitate to the best of their ability the important task with which your committee is faced, and have accordingly renewed their efforts to find a suitable destination within the Colonial Empire for the Assyrians of Iraq. In view of the fact that it is a case of finding not merely land which can be made available, but land on which, from the point of view both of physical and economic conditions, the Assyrians can be expected to prosper, and into which they can be introduced without creating new and difficult problems of a political, social or economic order, this is no easy matter. 3. The results of the examination which has been undertaken into the possibilities of settlement in various territories in the Colonial Empire have hitherto, with one exception, been unfavourable. That exception concerns an area in the Rupununi district of British Guiana, where the prospects seem to be 'prima facie such as to justify His Majesty’s Government in bringing them to the notice of your committee. 4. The area is an extensive one, and should be sufficiently large to accom modate all the Assyrians who may desire to leave Iraq. At present it is for the most part unsettled. A considerable number of horses and cattle are grazed upon it, and it appears to have possibilities of further development as a stock- raising area. Its agricultural potentialities have not yet been properly tested, but it is thought that limited areas would lend themselves to cultivation sufficiently to meet the requirements of the Assyrian settlers and their stock. Much closer examination will, however, be necessary, with particular regard to considerations of health and climate and to pastoral and agricultural conditions, before the district can definitely be pronounced as suitable for Assyrian settle ment, and an independent and impartial investigation conducted on the spot with this object, under the auspices of the League of Nations, appears to His Majesty s Government to be essential, for the satisfaction both of the Council o be League and of the Assyrians themselves, before any decision is reache . I he Government of British Guiana estimate that a mission of investigation would require to spend three months in the colony for the proper accomplishment o i s 5. A memorandum is enclosed giving such details as are immediately available regarding the area in question. The memorandum a J s 9 discusses possible lines of communication with the area, and gives a general idea o e probable cost of sAtrlpmAnf cn -Par' aa itiic r*pn af. nrAseut be estimated. SUm 168,000 dollars, at any time prior 758 9 [10558] B2 include, as the enclosed memorandum shows, not only land leases, but a quantity of cattle, horses and buildings, which should be a useful nucleus for any settlement operation. 7 There are in existence in the area certain well-defined Indian reserva tions which must be preserved and excluded from the land available for settlement. But these amount to only 855 square miles out of a total of some 13,000 square miles and they are so situated as not to present, so far as can be foreseen, any - likelihood of disturbance of Indians by the settlement of Assyrians in the adioining areas, or vice versa. 8 . The suggestion that the Assyrians of Iraq might be settled in the Rupununi district has been laid by the Acting Governor of British Guiana, with the approval of his Executive Oouncil, before the Legislative Council of the Colonyf and the Legislative Council on the 21st September unanimously passed the following resolution :— “ This Council approves the proposal that His Majesty’s Government should inform the League of Nations that there is land available in the Colony of British Guiana which appears prima facie to be suitable for settlement by the Assyrians, and is of the opinion that, as settlers, these people would be welcomed by the inhabitants of the colony; and agrees that the Government of British Guiana should co-operate in carrying such settlement into effect if it is decided to proceed with the project.” Up!® 9. Until such time as the new community is successfully established as an integral part of the population of the colony and is in a position to make its due contribution to the general revenue, it will constitute a financial liability. I desire to make it clear that the Government of British Guiana are not in a position to accept any part of this liability. The possibilities of settlement in British Guiana are accordingly placed before your committee at this stage without prejudice to the question of the provision of the necessary finance, which can only be effectively considered when further investigation has proved the scheme to be a feasible one. 10. His Majesty’s Government fully appreciate the importance of the Assyrian problem, to which reference was made in your letter of the 11 th June, and they are impressed by the great urgency of finding a satisfactory solution for it. They trust, therefore, that your committee will lose no time in taking the necessary steps to institute the independent enquiry in British Guiana which is recommended in paragraph 4 above, and it is scarcely necessary for me to add that His Majesty’s Government and the Government of British Guiana will gladly place all obtainable information before any mission which your committee may send out to the colony, and will extend to such a mission all possible facilities and assistance. I have, &amp;c. JOHN SIMON. the bei k It amount! p miles undf pnent of B kyri Enclosure in No. 1 . Memorandum on the Possibilities of Assyrian Settlement in the Rupununi District of British Guiana. (A)—General Description of Conditions in the Area from which Land for the Assyrians could be selected. Situation.—AAie region proposed, which is indicated on the attached sketch map, is bounded as follows f i t j le !l orth latitude 5° north; on the east by longitude 59° west o latitude 4 north, thence along that latitude to the Rupununi River, ence along the Rupununi, Rewa and Kwitaro Rivers and longitude 59 west to the intersection with latitude 2 ° north; and on the west by the Brazilian boundary.3 eus forsiJ sonielSiy 01 %i|3 BtI ‘i*U ; ^ Coi : , tajestj’sJ 1,6 to lie aJ| iat, as setli °nj; aiiaJ te in camil project,”'] Area .—The total area of the region is 13,110 square miles. From this must be deducted certain well-defined Indian reservations, amounting to 855 sauare miles, which must be preserved for the Indians and excluded from the settlement area. This leaves 12,255 square miles, of which 7,875 square miles are forest and 4,380 square miles open savannahs. Physical Features .—There are two hilly portions, the Pakaraima and Kanuku Mountains, forest-covered, and rising to heights of 2,000-3,000 feet above sea level. The remainder of the area is open savannahs. These consist for the most part of undulating park land, sloping upwards to the mountains and of a mean height of 300 feet above sea level. The lower areas flood to a depth of from 1 to 4 feet in the rainy season. Climate .—The temperature ranges from a maximum of 9T9° E. ( 33 - 3 ° C.) to a mimimum of 7T5° F. (21-9° C.). The nights throughout the year are uniformly cool. Rainfall and Water Supply .—The rainfall ranges from 55 to 80 inches, two distinct seasons occurring, the wet, May-August, and the dry, September-April (see attached statement). In the mountain regions rivers and streams give an ample supply of drinkable water all the year round. In the open savannahs are rivers and creeks, which, when they dry up, leave ponds. There are indications that additional water can probably be obtained by boring shallow wells. Two ranchers have such wells, equipped with windmill pumps, which are understood never to have failed to give an adequate supply of water for domestic and irrigation purposes. Health .—No detailed report on health conditions is at present available, but the climate in the area is reputed to be healthy. Existing Population .—Apart from the Indians, for whom, as already indicated, well-defined reservations exist, the population consists of only a few tiontep: | settlers and ranchers. Grazing permits, some of which are annual, have been granted for 3,050 out of the 4,380 square miles of savannah. The Rupununi Development Company.—TYie largest holding, which probably also comprises the best grazing land, is that of the Rupununi Development Company. It amounts to over 1,500 square miles, of which the company holds 300 square miles under grazing permits and the remainder on 99-year leases. The Government of British Guiana, considering it essential for the success of any scheme of Assyrian settlement, that this property should be available for inclusion in it, have taken the necessary steps to secure an option under which, if the League of Nations decide to proceed with the scheme, the-entire assets of the company could be purchased for the sum of 168,000 dollars at any time prior to the 20th March, 1935. The assets include, in addition to the leases and grazing permits, 47,456 head of cattle, 1,282 horses, 32 miles of fencing, and buildings valued at 13,000 dollars. These assets would form a useful nucleus for the initial equipment of the settlers. (B )—Pastoral and Agricultural Prospects. Stock Raising .—The savannah area is essentially pastoral, and in addition to cattle and horses, sheep, goats, pigs and poultry are said to thrive. a e raising has, however, hitherto been left to private enterprise, and has otten Deen carried out in a rather haphazard manner. The stock is of varying qua i y. is reported to be reasonably good. There are, however, signs of p osp a deficiencies, but any deterioration has probably been accentuated by m ree i g. I his should be capable of remedy. Agriculture. —Few scientific officers have visited the district, information as to its agricultural potentialities is scanty is, ’ un( J e [®f 00( f that the river valleys in the mountains are likely ? P r 0 J® . i, j suitable areas for agricultural settlement. In the savannahs i e g actlv % is at present carried on, except for the immediate needs o e .ve, t 1 JO® S ^ present carried on, i wno have established themselves. [10558] b 2The principal crops are cassava (which produces farinha, the staple food of the district) and maize. Other crops reported to have been grown are beans, . , i_ 'i j nlantflins rmlses. sweet potatoes, lettuce, cahbaoo the district) ana maize, wuiei — ; D r, ; ^ aus » tobacco, dry-land rice, bananas, plantains, pulses, sweet potatoes, lettuce cabbage and, according to one report, “ almost any kind of fruit or vegetable In the • t * ,1 i -t? rvnifo (p n nrpmp'es. hmes. STape-frmto stp coiri and, according to one repuit, ^ — y. ° T r;. ^ soil of the hilly country citrus fruits (e.g., oranges, limes, grape-fruit) are said to do well. Experiments have been made with wheat, but apparently without success. Reports of persons who know the district well and who are considered by - the Government of British Guiana to be competent to form an opinion are that the Assyrians should have no difficulty in growing sufficient food-stuffs for their own maintenance if settlement is carried out on the basis of small holdings, and that they could build up herds and flocks for sale. The agricultural possibilities of the savannahs, however, have not yet been properly tested. A certain number of samples of soil have been analysed, and the varying results suggest that, without extensive fertilisation, successful cultivation may be limited to the river valleys (which are, however, numerous). It is considered that these should be satisfactory for the cultivation of the majority of tropical food-stuffs. The whole situation clearly needs closer investigation, particularly from the point of view of (a) the production of cash crops and (b) the particular requirements and qualities of the Assyrians. Should the scheme be proceeded with, it is considered desirable that the settlers should be assisted by the establishment in their area of a stock farm, under the care of an experienced veterinary officer, and an agricultural experimental station. (C)— Communications. The only regular means of communication with the area at present is the Cattle Trail, which leads from the savannah area south of the Kanuku Mountains to Wismar on the Demerara River. To the west of the Essequibo River there is a motor road which goes in the direction of the area proposed for settlement, but at present ends near the Konawaruk River. Communication by water is somewhat difficult, owing to the fact that the navigation of all the larger rivers is impeded by rapids and waterfalls. The Government of British Guiana have suggested, however, that arrange ments might be made for dealing with parties of 1,000-1,500 persons, arriving at intervals of three or four weeks, on one of the following alternative routes :— Route 1.—By ocean-going steamer to Wismar on the Demerara River; by river to the Great Falls (fifteen hours) where a transfer from one system of river boats to another would be necessary; by river to Canister Falls (twelve hours); by rorry along the Cattle Trail to Kurupukari; thence by lorry to any point on the savannahs during the months of September to April. This route would require the establishment of a base camp for 1,500 persons at Wismar, smaller rest camps at Great Falls and Canister Falls, and a distribu tion camp at Kurupukari. Route 2. Involves the extension of the Bartica-Potaro—Konawaruk road in one of the following directions : {a) to Mowasi Landing on the Essequibo River, or some more suitable point higher up the river, and thence to a point on the Cattle Trail north of Kurupukari (the Essequibo River to be crossed by punt); {b) southward to a point just north of the junction of the Siparuni and Burro- / 1Vers - ^ lence southward to a point on the Cattle Trail south of Kurupukari (the biparuni River to be crossed by punt or bridge). Each of these extensions would be approximately 50 miles in length, and present information suggests that extension (b) would be the better. T? 6 . route would be as follows : by ocean steamer to Bartica on tne Esseqmbo River; thence by motor lorry to Kurupukari. A base camp for , persons would be required at Bartica, rest camps at Garraway Stream and at some point intermediate between Garraway Stream and Kurupukari, and a distribution camp at Kurupukari. The camps on this route would cost approximately the same amount as is es ima e i the Demerara route were used, but no river transport would have to be provided, and the conversion of the Cattle Trail between Canister Falls and Kurupukari into a motor road would be unnecessary.

Suggestion that medical expert be added was deprecated on ground of expense by president of committee who expressed confidence that local British medical service would give every assistance and provide sufficient material for members of mission to form reliable opinion on health conditions. ■Committee also had under consideration note from French Government concerning possibility of settlement in rieneh West Africa within bend of River Niger. Note which is sonevnac va^ue ^ooognises risk that Assyrians may fail to adap&gt;t tnemselves the climate and labour conditions and suggests mission of investigation to be followed if its report were favourable by experimental installation of a few families upon conclusive success of which any large scale settlement would oe conditio: Comittee evidently felt considerable doubt whether project worthy 0 f pursuing at all and asked French representative for further details before even considering despatch of mission of investigation.

The Assyrians are a ChristianCfcrietiGrt cOTRnuaity in r country. Gone of tlier. ard Presbyter!aa» ? generally spoking, they belong to that branch of the Assyro-OJmlSean race which constitutes the Ncstorlan Ghurohc Before the war they lived for the most part in the highlands of Turkish Kurdistan. men Turkey entered the war, they wsre in a difficult position, and eventually they took up arms against Turkey in co-operation with Huseia* On the collapse of the Hussion force® .3 they were obliged to retire fighting through Persia, and eventually, with the assistance of British forces, they found refuge with their families in Iraq, where they were kept for &amp; considerable time in refugee oempe at the expense* of Kis Majesty’s ^oTersment. Attempts were made efler the cessation of hostilities to repatriate thm to their homelands, but thosa who returned were eventually again driven out by the Turks. An effort was then made by His Majesty’s Government to secure in the Peace Settlement with Turkey that the furco-Iraq frontier should be so drawn as to include within Iraq the old homelands of the Assyrians, but it was flnind impossible to obtain acceptance of this by the Turks. The present frontier &amp; s draw by the League Council* to whom the final settlement was lefts, leaves the former Assyrian home in Turkey. Consequently the task had to be faced of settling the Assyrians in Iraq. It was a task of extreme delicacy, not °nly on account of racial and religious difficulties, but also because the necessary land to settle Assyrians in a compact community as they themselves would have preferred could not be made available without creating a serious Political problem. Considerable progress was however made tfith settling the Assyrians in various parts oi northern Iraq, andaa&amp; e?npXo^ 2 aest was found lor fhim in an in©raising degre© in til® v'issp &amp; Bx %%*&amp;&amp;. miXi 4»ai*y amciXiat*^ foTtj§.. Biit &amp;o til® time approached for the termination of the mandatory ! regime in lr%q v the Assyrians hecame apprehensire about their future position in the country* and made it clear that unless this could he safeguarded by settlement in a compact and organised community, they would prefer to leave Iraq for soma other country. They petitioned the League of feiicms in this sanse and the position was considered by the Council of the League in December* 1932, The upshot wau that, the Council approved of a further attempt being mad© by the Iraqi aoTernment to settle the landless Assyrians under suitable eand.ition®. 5 leaving the question of settlement outside Iraq for subsequent consideration* should the attempt be unsuccessful» Unfortunately* mainly awing to local political and religious difficulties inherent in the situation in Iraq, the attempt was unsuccessful* and only resulted in inormming fx^iction, whioh ii August 5 1933 ciilmiBated in disorder® in which the Assyrian© suffered serious losses of life and property* In consequence tbs matter c&amp;me one© more before the Council of the League? vh® decided in October last that the only practical course was facilitate the emigration to some other country ol those Syrians who desired to leave Iraq. 3° Imestigations as to possible destinations c-sgun Sj ond for some time it was hoped that ©ettleaient might Ir* effected in Brazil on the property of a British company, ■^ana Plantations Limited* Unhappily* when negotiations were Aching a head* the Brazilian Constituent Assembly adopted a assure restricting immigration from foreign aoiaiitriea m le-neral in a manner which made it jjspossible to p/ot eed ^i.^h scheme» 4 o4. 1 - Owing vQ Wi# m\i a o UT'© 1&gt;Xg &lt;?ooiioi?iic an-cl social conditions prsvaili^ geasrUJ-y throughout ths world at tho pr^jent tixne, it Is a matter of great difficulty to find a, suita tv*e cj n@. 4 . v 0 * i.hc A s syri@.R prohld*?* howaT©r•• hoth on hwimnitarian and on political grounds urgently demands ft solution- Hds Majesty's CloYsrment ara most anxious to facilitate such a solution if practicable, and hare isadc enquiries in several colanios s including British Galana. 5* it has suggested that the eavannsh country of the Rupununi district is deserTlng of special consideration in this connection, as sufficient suitable areas of Crown Xw:4? could be nade RTailable on which the Assyrians could be settled as a self-supporting community.

Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. » The scheme for the settlement of Assyrians in Brazil having fallen through, the Colonial Office in their Despatch of the 13th July, 1934 (P.Z.4636/34 flagged) approached the Government of British Guiana asking them whether it would he possible to settle the Assyrians in the Rupununi District of British Guiana, and if so to consider the arrangements that would oe necessary to this end. The emigration from Iraq, is intended to he purely voluntary, and of the 20,000 Assyrians estimated to be in Iraq the number who would wish to be settled elsewhere is estimated at between 7,000 and X^OOO. The Government of British Guiana .ill not be expected to contribute to thecost Of the scheme, which it proposed to ask the League of Nations to pay. Should such an appeal to the League of Nations be unfruitful it will presumably devolve upon the British Exchequer to meet the cost, with perhaps a contribution from the Iraqi Government. The Executive Council of British Guiana, to whom the proposal has been confidentially communicated, are stated to be enthusiastically in favour of it, and arrangements are already in train for the preparation of the site. The area in question ifi at present owned by the Rupununi Company, from whom a 7 months' option on the land has now been bought (suoject to the comirmation of the shareholders of the Company). This will allow time for negotiations to be made with the Assyrians and'the Iraqi Government and for the proposal to he put before the British Guiana Legislative Council for approval. Should all go well, the property will then he bought outright. ( '4 'ptC- The Colonial Office fear the possibility of a fresh Assyrian crisis in theifuture, and are therefore anxious to communicate the scheme to the Iraqi Government as soon as possible. This would entail a certain risk of publicity which it is obviously desirable to avoid before the transaction has been confirmed by the shareholders. This, apparently, cannot happen oefore the 10th September. British Guiana is in need of settlers (schemes for further colonisation from India have been seriously considered). This colony therefore provides a fairly good chance of finding a solution of the Assyrian problem, and the prospects of a solution may now be regarded as much more hooeful. The Colonial Govt, is showing great energy in getting down to the practical details of a scheme/ute Paper.

Translation Sir, Geneva, July 21st, 1934 With reference to my letter No. 430 of June 16th, 1934, (C./Min.Ass./43) , I have the honour to, submit below my Governments observations with regard to the seven points concerning the Assyrian question which are mentioned in your letter of June 11th, 1934.* 1. The general situation of the Assyrians of Iraq should cause no anxiety. My Government has already sub mitted to the Secretary-General of the. League of Nations full reports on this matter down to the. end of April (C/Min.Ass./44) . There is no change in the situation. The only difficulty is that as the question of emigra ion is still outstanding some of the Assyrians remain unemployed. 2. As explained in Major Thomson’s reports and^in the observations on the Mar Shimun’s petitions (C./Min.A^./ i the death-rate in the Mosul camp, which the.Commi d disturbing, was due to an epidemic of whooping-coug g- by measles among the children. There are stl ^- 4 4 lv deaths due to the carelessness of the mothers who -q refuse to carry out the doctors’ instruction^. 3. All the villages to which the Assyrians agreed to return have been completely repaired. g 6 g last arising out of Report C for the month of Rebrua y ■ (C./Min.Ass./27) is due to a mistake m translation.^^ a matter of fact, the Arab report actuaily stat there of the destroyed houses have now been reco ^ will is nothing new to be mentioned on this ^NTliages com- find appended a full list showing b&lt; ? th JNThe f heir pletely repaired and those not repair© former inhabitants refuse to return to *) See C./Min.Ass./43.2 4 4. The fluctuations in the expenditure on the Mosul Camp do not affect the living conditions of the refugees. They are simply due to various payments: advances to con tractors, assistance in money and compensation, transport, purchase of clothes, blankets etc., and wages of camp employees. 5. The Committee’s message to the Assyrians was received in different ways: psirieli jiiej (a) The Assyrians who are loyal to the Iraqi Government received this message with satisfaction, as they are not much in favour of emigration from Iraq. (b) The Mar Shimun’s supporters were somewhat discontented. They believed that emigration would take place during the summer, and the message was therefore a real disappointment to them. They showed their discontent by asking their chiefs to protest and to call on foreign powers to facilitate emigration, even at the expense of the emigrants. These people will not be satisfied with any solution which is not in accordance with their desires. Generally speaking, the Committee’s message had a good effect. Several Assyrians who were hesitating decided to return to their villages and to their agricultural work. 6 . Up to the present the Iraqi Government has sub mitted observations on several petitions from the Mar Shimun. The latest observations (C./Min.Ass./45) relate to the Mar Shimun’s letter of May 3rd (C./Min./Ass./33. ) It has always been very easy to refute the baseless and erroneous allegations and assertions which are repeated over and over again in the Mar Shimun’s letters. il With, regard to the letters dated May 23rd and 30th and June /tn, my Government does not think any useful purpose would bobserved by making detailed observations, because they contain allegations already repeated several times, the mendacious character of which has been proved. If any n ^ eserv ing of serious consideration come to light, it will revert to the Mar Shimun’s recent letters. . .* rhe Iraqi.Government does not anticioate that the Assyrians wno are dissatisfied with the delay in emigration f G an Z ac tioh which would call for exceptional • 4 - ih ^ measures .already taken for the security and a11 til0 inhabitants, Assyrians and others, . .. n -orce as long as the Government regards them as indispensable.

S.W I July SOth 1934 dear Sara, ( ^Wl! ..lay l appeal to you, even in the midst of you^ immense preoccupations, to giy e a thought to the unhapmr Assyrians? J ii,y You may be aware of the fact that all the plans for settlement in Brazil have come to naught because the Brazilians have recently embedded in their constitution a provision against immigration in excess of 2% p e r annum of previous settlement!, plus an additional provision against settlement in racial groups. It is pretty clear that the idea of getting t h e League to find a solution is a washout. In any case while it may have been convenient to use the machinery of the League I think I know of nothing more contemptible in recent history than our declining all responsibility for the Assyrians'', except in so far as we might be willing to share with other members of the League in the cost of their resettlement. In other words we use the League as a sheer excuse for declining our own responsibility for people who after all served us well, saved us millions of money, and are in trouble largely because they were regarded as our own immediate agents and instruments. It seems to me that we really must face our responsibility and find British money and effort to settle them either in Iraq or somewhere else. This brings me to a practical suggestion for your consideration, fhere is, I imagine, no larger area in the world of mountain country with a climate not too different from that of the Assyrian highlands than is to be found in India, and the impression I have received from a good many descriptions of mountaineering expeditions is that there are considerable patches at any rate which are prettyII.OANE 1543. 112, EATON SQUARE, S.W.I. ^populated and where room for a settlement could b e found 'i'here is another more specific possibility which has purred to me. -here nas been a S r e at deal of internal 1 f 1 -^shmir mainly Hindu-Moslem, and British troops ,ve had to be used to restore order, yould it not be v=?v idd business for the iiaharajah to enlist a battalion of 7 isyrians, or an Assyrian gendarmerie jvhich would have the Ivantage of being neutral in religious controversies^ ishmir is, I fancy, anything but overcrowded, and an'area , which the families of these m e n might settle could fancy, be found without too great difficulty . if the iheme caught on I do not suppose it would be long before 16 Assyrians found a considerable scope for themselves i policemen etc. not only in 2ashmir but in other Indian ates, and indeed in British India as well.

Lord HUGH CECIL asked the Secre tary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he can make any statement in respect to the Assyrians in Iraq; first, as to the provision of relief for their present and proximate distress, and secondly, as to the prospect of their permanent settle ment and relief by emigration ? Sir J. SIMON: The responsibility for providing for the security and relief of the Assyrians in Iraq rests with the Iraqi Government, who have undertaken to keep the Assyrian Committee of the Council of the League of Nations in formed of the measures taken by them to this end. I understand that the Iraqi Government have now set up a com mittee, including certain of their officials of British nationality, to deal with the whole question of the relief and main tenance of the Assyrians, pending a decision as to their ultimate future. With regard to the second part of the ques tion, the Assyrian Committee of the League is still actively investigating the feasibility of arranging for the resettle ment of the Assyrians outside Iraq, an recently addressed an appeal to a num ber of Governments inviting them to reconsider the possibility of accepting the Assyrians in any of the territories under their control. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, who were among the Governments approached by re Council Committee, are giving the matter their earnest attention.—(^ poist oi His ilaj®s%y* $ oo^sidtr that it has .now haoome a matter of vital aM iiaiaadiate importaacs to flad a plaos to wMoh those Assyfiaas who wish to leave Iraq oan he removed* 3* 'faere seems very little prospect iadeed of an offer of aooommodution being made by any foreign government, and I have accordingly been examining the .possibility of settling these people somewhere 4. It appears that, with the possible exception of British Guiana., in every Colonial Territory where conditions might be suitable in some respects for the settlement of these Assyrians,there are special conditions {e.g. lack of available land or water, climate, health aoM.itions or the existence of racial problems) which threaten to render their settlement impractica ble • But sir .fdwarcl Denham has now suggested that the savannah country in the Hupunani district of 'British Guiana is deserving of speoial coasideratioB in relation to the physical requirements in wb oh the Assyrians could be settled as a se supporting ooaaanity* Indeed from the point of view of the development of this remote district, Edward Denham i» inclined to the vt** tha Assyrians migh as they are a conditions of I openingopeaiag^Ef Ihia area would in accord wit/, the desire ot the Leg i slat are tkat the Oolouy should ti?eiitually be liak,ed ap with it® soathera neighbor. &amp;• In order to avoid m.f risk of misuridarstaadiag I would observe that the Assyrians whom it is now desired to settle, are essentially different in origin, habits, mentality and oecapation from the Syrian traders whose presence in some British Colonies is often by mo means welcome. The Assyrians are industrio as and hardy people, whose pursuits are mainly agricultural and pastoral, although the camaunity includes an adequate mom her of craftsmen, @,g# blacksmiths, carpenters, basket makers, weavers and tanners, whose trades are essential to self-supporting village likfe* It is true that large mambers of the Assyrians in Iraq have been (and in fact are still) employed in the levies ( a fore© with a military organisation) or the police* fhere is, however, in the opinion of His Majesty 1 s Ambassador at Baghdad,no reason to anticipate that these men, if given the opportunity, would not revert, contentedly, to their traditional agricultural or pastoral pursuits. 6 .

Section 1. 0 No. 1. [E 3973/1 93 Foreign Office to Colonial Office. (Confidential.) Sir, Foreign Office, June 21, 1934. I AM directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to invite a reference to corres pondence ending with Colonial Office letter of the 6th January last regarding the possibility of settling in the Colonial Empire those Assyrians who wish to leave Iraq. 2. The Committee of the Council of the League, which was charged by the Council in October last with the task of investigating whether the settlement of these Assyrians outside Iraq was practicable, has hitherto concentrated on a plan for settlement in the State of Parana in Brazil, but this plan has now had to be abandoned, owing to the recent adoption by the Brazilian Constituent Assembly of a restrictive measure on immigration in general. No suitable alternative destination has yet presented itself, but the Council of the League on the 7th June decided that a final effort to find one should be made, and accordingly instructed its committee to make fresh representations to the Governments of countries whose territories might lend themselves to Assyrian settlement, with a view to informing the Council definitely, and as soon as possible, whether the settlement of the Assyrians outside Iraq was realisable. The Council, in the same resolution, addressed an urgent appeal to the Governments to which the committee might make requests to give favourable consideration to such requests and to facilitate the committee’s task in view of the great importance of the problem. 3. In pursuance of this decision the committee at once decided to address appeals to the Governments of the following countries in respect either of their home or of their overseas territories : the United Kingdom, Lrance, Italy, Spain, Australia, South Africa, Canada, Argentina, Colombia, Greece, Portugal. The Netherlands, Belgium and Turkey. 4. A copy of the appeal addressed to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom is enclosed herein.^) 5. There is no indication at present that any of the Governments approached, some of which have already returned negative or discouraging replies to earlier enquiries, are likely to give favourable consideration to the appeal now addressed to them. Indeed, the majority of the Council Committee appear to regard the appeal as being in the nature of a necessary formality preparatory to measures for the permanent resettlement of the Assyrians in Iraq. 6. The enclosed appeal draws attention, however, to the serious difficulties which are to be anticipated if the Assyrian problem cannot be solved by the settle ment outside Iraq of those members of the community who wish to leave Iraq and We declared their inability to remain there under existing conditions. These difficulties would have a special importance for His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, who, in view of their past and present connexion with Iraq, fthght quickly find themselves in a position of great embarrassment and difficulty. 7. In the first place, the Secretary of State for the Colonies will be aware that there is a strong feeling, not only abroad, but also in certain circles in this country, that responsibility for the present plight of the Assyrians lies with His Majesty s Government. In point of fact His Majesty’s Government are under fto specific obligation towards the Assyrians and the statement made before the ermanent Mandates Commission in 1931 regarding the “ moral responsibility °f His Majesty’s Government in connexion with the termination of the mandatory Regime can only be applied to the present case by distorting both the meaning oi he statement itself and by ignoring the part which some of the Assyrian leadeis P a yed in bringing disaster upon the community. Nevertheless, in view of that s aten ient and of the past and present connexion of His Majesty s Government [131 x—1] p) June 16, 1934, Section 1.with Iraq and with the Assyrians, and more particularly of the fact that a considerable number of Assyrians are stll LT^h 0 Kl as soldiers in the Iraq levies, which guard the Koyal Air borce aerodromes m Iraq His Majesty's Government have a special interest m the solution of the Assyrian prob em and a total disclaimer of responsibility would be neither politic nor convincing There is no doubt that the Assyrian troubles of last summer severely damaged the credit of His Majesty’s Government m the eyes of States mlmbers of the League of Nations, and there is every reason to fear that that Sedk will suffer stdl further damage if His Majesty's Government fail to offer practical assistance towards the resettlement of the Assyrians outside Iraq. Were it possible to find land in some other foreign country or m one of the Dominions this assistance might in certain circumstances be financial m character but if no Dominion or foreign country is prepared to receive the Assyrians there is no way in which His Majesty’s Government can assist except bv finding land within the Colonial Empire in which the Assyrians can settle. 8. lam to point out that, so far as His Majesty’s Government are concerned, it is a question not merely of prestige or credit, though that is important, but of the serious practical dangers which are to be anticipated if the Assyrians are compelled to remain in Iraq. , A . t 9. It may be thought that if it were demonstrated to the Assyrians that their settlement outside Iraq was not practicable, they would accept the situation and settle down in Iraq, forgetting gradually the massacre of last summer as similar massacres have been forgotten in the past in oriental countries. This, however, is not the view of qualified observers. It must be remembered that a certain section of the Assyrians, namely, the Upper Tiari and Tkhuma tribes, who constitute the immediate followers of the Mar Shimun, have never been willing to settle permanently in Iraq, except under conditions which are impossible of fulfilment, while the view of the remainder may be expected to be powerfully affected by the fact that, in the massacres and looting of last August, no distinction was made between those Assyrians who had taken part in the previous fighting and those who had remained peaceably in their villages as loyal supporters of the Iraqi Government. These events have inevitably left behind them a feeling of bitterness and consequently a certain tension. Moreover, they have reduced a proportion of the Assyrians to a state bordering on destitution. 10. While there appears to be no immediate prospect of a further massacre deliberately organised or encouraged by the Iraqi civil or military authorities, there is the constant danger of untoward results arriving from the rash or provocative acts of minor officials. The Assyrians still possess a number of British rifles earned during service in the levies, and if faced with the prospect of permanent settlement in Iraq—or even of long delay in settlement elsewhere—- they may be driven to some act of desperation. In any case, further attempts to settle them permanently in Iraq are likely to lead to constant friction with their Kurdish or Arab neighbours or with the Iraqi authorities, which may at any moment produce an incident. His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, who is at present on leave in this country and has recently been consulted, feels strongly that every effort must be made to find a home for the Assyrians outside Iraq, and I % considers that it is necessary to remove from Iraq at least 7,000 of the Assyrians at the earliest possible moment if a very critical and dangerous situation is to be avoided. 11. Further bloodshed might have very far-reaching consequences. When the massacre took place last summer, there was reason to fear that in certain circumstances it might spread to other Christians and develop eventually into an anti-British and anti-foreign movement. This danger will be present m any future disturbance, whether its origin is some act of desperation on the part of the Assyrians, or whether it begins with some outrage against them; for the Assyrians are looked upon as the special proteges of His Majesty’s Government, and, together with the other minorities of Iraq, are, in a sense, proteges of the League of Nations in virtue of the guarantees given by Iraq in return for the termination of the mandatory regime. 12. It is clear that, in view of the special position which His Majesty s Government occupy in Iraq, quite apart from the complicating factor that the guarding of the Royal Air Force aerodromes is largely in the hands of the Assyiian members of the levies, this country would inevitably be involved m rttoeasw I lifiewo^ a i it is in' 4ii Is is g la ^SirPif Ml Irt hll te ffherealh Ketlier if ktaians ai well is said t ii to be se' Mai Empire impact grou httiaff tear liierenU 1 Forconreni 11?, k ;es.

As a member of the Council of the League which is responsible for supervising the execution of the Iraqi Declaration of Guarantees as the ally of Iraq under the treaty of 1930, and as the employer of a considerable number of Assyrian troops m Iraq, His Majesty’s Government would be in a position of the gravest embarrassment and difficulty. The reactions could hardly Q fail to affect the whole position of this country in Iraq and the many and important British interests there, and even the prospect of some form of military action, if only to ensure the safety of existing air establishments, cannot be ruled out. 13. In view of the extremely serious issues involved, Sir John Simon feels strongly that it is in the interests of this country that a further attempt should be made to find land in the Colonial Empire on which the Assyrians could be settled, and he is glad to learn that, following a discussion with Sir Francis Humphrys, Sir Philip Cunlifie-Lister is prepared to investigate the possibilities afresh. Sir John Simon fully realises the difficulties involved, but trusts that every effort will be made to overcome them. In this connexion, I am to observe that while it has hitherto been the aim of the Council Committee to find a destination where all the Assyrians of Iraq, estimated at some 20,000 persons, can be settled together if they so desire, the possibility of settlement in two separate groups—not necessarily far apart—has had to be envisaged in view of reports that the Assyrians are at present divided into two approximately equal groups, one of which is said to be dissatisfied with the policy of the Mar' Shimun and to be unwilling to be settled under his aegis. Sir John Simon suggests, therefore, that, though desirable, it should not be regarded as essential, to find a place within the Colonial Empire within which the Assyrians can, if necessary, be settled in a single compact group, and that His Majesty’s Government should not be deterred from putting forward even a scheme for settlement in more than two separate groups, in different territories, if this is the best that can be devised. 14. For convenience of reference I am to enclose a memorandum( 1 ) giving in brief outline the recent history of the Assyrian problem together with some notes on the origin, organisation and characteristics of the Assyrians. 15. Finally, I am to emphasise the urgency of a decision in this matter. The Council Committee, prompted by growing concern regarding the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq and the possible effect upon it of delay, is anxious to report definitely to the Council in September next whether their settlement outside Iraq is practicable or not. The committee’s concern does not only relate to the question of the security and welfare of those Assyrians who have remained in or returned to their villages. Some 1,500 dependants of those who were killed last summer or who fled to Syria are still being maintained by the Iraqi Government in a camp at Mosul, but it is understood that funds for the maintenance of this camp are only available until September. Any proposal to allocate further funds for this purpose is sure to meet with opposition from Iraqi nationalists. An even more serious problem is raised by the presence in Mosul, outside the refugee camp, of a large number of Assyrians, who fled there from their villages during the disturb ances ten months ago. Efforts have been made to induce them to return to their villages and to resume their normal life pending emigration, but distrust has rendered such efforts only partially successful. These Assyrians have hitherto been maintained chiefly by their friends and relations, whose resources are, how ever, dwindling. The situation is thus likely to become increasingly precarious as time goes on, and as the hope of settlement elsewhere is deferred. If no progress can be made with resettlement before the winter, the prospect is a serious °ne. It is most desirable, therefore, that His Majesty’s Government should be m a position before September to inform the Council Committee whether they are prepared in principle to find a place of settlement for the Assyrians in the territories under their jurisdiction, even though it should prove impossible before hat date to work out a concrete scheme in all its details. 16.

Olivdn to Sir John Simon.—(Received June 16.) League of Nations, Sir, Geneva, June 11, 1934. THE Government of the United Kingdom will be aware of the efforts made by the Committee of the Council for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq, on which they are represented, to fulfil the task laid upon it by the Council on the 14th October, 1933. In its report to the Council of the 5th June, the committee was obliged to record the failure of a scheme for settlement in Brazil on which it had hitherto concentrated its main efforts. I enclose a copy of this report^) and of the reportf) upon it by the Council’s rapporteur and of the resolution/ 2 ) adopted by the Council on the 7th June, 1934. In pursuance of this resolution the committee now addresses an appeal, among others, to the Government of the United Kingdom. The committee believes that the Government of the United Kingdom have already had under consideration, but so far without favourable result, the possibility of settling the Assyrians in the overseas territories under their jurisdiction. It ventures, however, to urge that this question may now be reconsidered in the light, not only of its urgent humanitarian aspect, but also of the difficulties which are to be anticipated if the Assyrian problem cannot be solved by the settlement outside Iraq of those members of the community who wish to leave that country and have declared their inability to remain there under present conditions. The Government of the United Kingdom, in view of their specially close relations with Iraq, will certainly realise the importance of this problem. The enclosed documents show the concern of the committee and of the Council regarding the situation of the Assyrians of Iraq if the search for a place of settlement elsewhere should be prolonged, and I venture to draw attention in particular to the fourth paragraph of the Council’s resolution of the 7th June, and to express the hope that the Government of the United Kingdom will be good enough to facilitate the committee’s task by giving urgent consideration to the present appeal.

Report by the Committee to the Council.—{Received in Foreign Office, June 11.) THE Committee of the Council has thought it necessary to submit the present report to the Council at its current special session because a new fact- lias supervened which seriously affects the problem as a whole, and which it considers essential to lay before the Council forthwith, in order that the latter may be able in due time to take such action as the new situation may necessitate. In its last report to the Council, dated the 15th May (C. 196.1934.VII). the committee reviewed the efforts it had made to perform the task which the Council had entrusted to it in October 1933, and which consisted in examining to what extent the settlement outside Iraq of the Assyrians who might wish to^leave the country might be practicable. It will be remembered that this task was entrusted to the committee in order to help the Iraqi Government, and at the latter’s express request. The report dealt mainly with the plan for settlement on land situated in the State of Parana, in Brazil. In January the Brazilian Government declared its willingness, subject to certain conditions, to authorise the settlement of the Assyrians on this land, and the Council, in its resolution of the 19th January, r 1934, warmly thanked it for this authorisation. Before discussing the conditions of settlement in detail, the committee thought it necessary to satisfy itself first of all that the Assyrians would adapt themselves to the conditions existing in the Parana and would become a useful element for Brazil. Accordingly, with the Brazilian Government’s consent and with the Council’s approval, a mission was re ^ on in question. The committee’s report to the Council, dated the loth May, summarised the conclusions reached by this mission. f while the mission’s report was absolutely favourable as regards its technical conclusions, it confirmed and supplemented the information already received by the committee with regard to growing opposition in Brazil to the arrival of the Assyrians. A press campaign, which found ardent supporters and propagandists, and which had serious repercussions, even in Parliament, developed in Brazil, and seemed to compromise seriously the final success of the plan. Nevertheless, the committee still retained the hope that the Brazilian plan I might finally be adopted. In any case, it realised that, apart from the above- 1 mei ]l lo ned campaign, the transfer of the Assyrians raised numerous delicate problems, and in its report to the Council of the 15th May it informed the ouncil that it could not say at that moment whether the plan would eventually ^rned 0U E The report also said that as soon as circumstances permitted e ailed negotiations would have to be entered into with the Brazilian Govern ment m order to draw up a plan which would be acceptable to that Government. e committee had already taken unofficial steps to discover the most favourable oment for opening official negotiations, and had adjourned to await a reply, e week later, however, on the 25th May, 1934, the committee learnt that the rnzi ian Constituent Assembly had voted the insertion, in the draft Constitution *5 ^ was examining, of a provision stipulating that immigration from any niim}f U r C0lmtr y s h° u ld not exceed in any one year 2 per cent, of the total fftv ^ nationals that country who had settled in Brazil during the last terrt earS ’ anc ^ concen tration of emigrants in any part of the national settfi n ° ry fi r ould he prohibited. As this measure seemed io remove all hope of n ew situak ^' ss T r l ans i n Brazil, the committee immediately met to study the [131 l-l]! TV.P mmmittee decided to ask the Brazilian Government whether the ofier made Ust Tanuary was really to be regarded as impracticable and as havmg heen withdrawn. ^ the ^ June&gt; 1934 th ^ the Brazilian Government considered ™ arrival of the Assyrians as impossible in view of Parliament’^ ^ D°uring the long meetings which have recently been held, the committee has considerefwhether there were serious reasons for still hoping that land could be found for the settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq elsewhere than in Brazil. We may recall here what was said m the report of the 15th May “ In its search for a suitable destination for the Assyrians the committee felt bound to explore a wide field and there is no continent m the world in which it has not considered possibilities But as was to be expected, in view of the universal depression and unemployment and of the laws restricting all immigration, and as indeed the Council itself had anticipated, the committee encountered considerable difficulties. In certain cases it received definitely negative replies; m others the replies weie not absolutely negative, but very discouraging; m other cases, again, it has not yet received a definite reply. ± ^ ^a i , i _ During the committee’s deliberations on the steps that should now be taken, two views were discussed. One was that the committee might forthwith, without undertaking any further consultations, say that it was impossible, at the present iuncture, to find any countries that were prepared to accept mass immigration on such a large scale. The contrary view was that, until it had exhausted everj possibility and made every effort, the committee could not say whether it was possible to find lands or not. In support of this latter opinion it was observed that, from the outset of its work, the committee had concentrated its attention on •, the Brazilian plan, on account of the prospects of a speedy solution which it offered, and that, from the moment when, in its report to the Council, the committee had announced that the possibility of a settlement in Brazil was bein&lt;j thoroughly investigated, the other Governments consulted probably regarded themselves as thereby less bound to pursue their examination of the problem until a decision should have been reached as to the Brazilian plan. According to this view, the committee ought to make a fresh attempt without delay, because the attitude of the Governments so far consulted might be influenced if they knew that the Brazilian plan had failed, and if they could be convinced of the urgency of the question. In any case, if a fresh effort were to be made to find lands, a fairly long period must be expected to elapse before the settlement of the Assyrians could actually take place. The committee sincerely trusts that this circumstance will have no unfortunate influence on the situation in Iraq. It felt that the Council should be fully informed of the present state of affairs. The committee desires to remark that, when setting up the committee and defining its terms of reference, the Council expressed the hope that 1 ‘ until it has been possible to put into effect the arrangements ’ ’ for the emigration of the Assyrians, ‘ ‘ the Iraqi Government will be good enough to keep the committee regularly informed of the measures taken to ensure the safety of the Assyrians m Iraq, to assist the families left destitute in consequence of those events, and to rebuild those villages which have been whollv or oartiallv destroved through 1 n Brazil the isd. lit my duty to kniversally i Ut not the o eof its task. lay opinion, cal lile seen ironr piliremittii p assuming it t&lt; R and that, ii im 'CO lyd P Ifi year; nor lotions of tl : ;N faith and it hie to an and comp P of Iraq, wit] l® 9 ’4 this! ^~villages which have been wholly or partially destroyed through the same events.” The Iraqi Government has sent reports, which the committee has carefully studied, and regarding which it has asked the Iraqi Government tor further information and details. Clearly, however, the committee can in no case be responsible for any consequences the Assyrians might suffer owing to the delay in discovering a suitable site for their settlement or the impossibility of finding such a site. When, at a recent meeting, the committee informed the representative ot Iraq of the new situation created by the Brazilian Government’s negative decision, it nevertheless felt bound to remind him of the solemn undertakings entered into by the Iraqi Government with regard to the safety and well-being of the Assyrians. ‘“Ussyriai Weofthet SSitvi, a last i mm %ia ‘atttec, Geneva, June 5, 1934.THIS DOCUMEKT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Iraq). new of f,® CONFIDENTIAL. * jfsaBKHSsaaraawaB® 3 **** ( r/ June 12, 1934.

MY colleagues on the Council will no doubt have learnt with regret from the report which the Committee of the Council has just submitted to us, that the hope of settling in Brazil the Assyrians of Iraq wishing to leave that country can no longer be realised. I feel it my duty to point out incidentally that the Brazilian Government’s decision is not directed against the settlement of the Assyrians in particular, but is a general measure, a new law' which restricts all immigration into Brazil from whatever country it may come. The laws restricting immigration, which are almost universally adopted nowadays, have been one of the most serious obstacles, but not the only one, which our committee has encountered in the performance of its task. Its report gives us the details, and describes a situation which, in my opinion, calls for the Council’s most serious attention. It will be seen from this report that the committee’s efforts—and we all know how great and unremitting they have been—have had no success up to the present; that, even assuming it to be possible, it will be very difficult to find land at the present time; and that, in the most favourable hypothesis, the Assyrians will have to remain in Iraq for a much longer time than had been anticipated. What will be the consequences as regards the situation of the Assyrians of Iraq, who had conceived great hopes, and had for many months been living in expectation of an early departure ? The Council has not yet forgotten the tragic events of last year; nor has it forgotten the guarantees, the pledges, and the solemn declarations of the Iraqi Government, and it cannot doubt that Govern ment’s good faith and its ability to observe these pledges. When the mandatory regime came to an end on the 30th May, 1932, the Kingdom of Iraq made a declaration at Bagdad containing the guarantees given to the Council by the Iraqi Government. In chapter I, paragraph 2, article 1 of this declaration reads: “ Full and complete protection of life and liberty will be assured to all inhabitants of Iraq, without distinction of birth, nationality, language, race or religion.” Moreover, at this same Council table, as well as in the committee, the representatives of Iraq have repeatedly made formal declarations and assumed a definite undertaking on behalf of their Government, not only to guarantee the security of the Assyrians, but to succour them and provide for their welfare during the whole of the time they may still have to remain in Iraq. It will be incumbent on the Governments to which the committee may apply to assist it in its task, and on the Iraqi Government to abide by its undertaking regarding the security and welfare of the Assyrians. If you accept this report and the resolution your rapporteur is submitting to you, the Council will confine itself to making a last effort through its committee to find land, and if it succeeds, to preparing a plan in close co-operation with the Iraqi Government for the settlement of the Assyrians who may express the desire to emigrate. I propose that the Council adopt the following resolution : — The Council, T Takes note of the report of the Committee of the Council for the settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq; 2. Approves the report of its rapporteur, the representative of Spain; [131 m—1]3 Instructs the Committee of the Council to persist in its efforts, and to make fresh representations to the Governments of countries the territories of which might lend themselves to the settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq who express the desire to leave that country, in order that it may be able, as soon as possible, to inform the Council definitely whether the settlement of these Assyrians elsewheie than^ in Iraq is at present realisable; 4 Addresses an urgent appeal to the Governments to which the Committee of the Council may make requests, to give favourable consideration to such requests, and to facilitate the committee s task in view of the great importance of the problem; . . 5 Draws the Iraqi Government’s special attention to its declaration made at Bagdad on the 30th May, 1932, on the occasion of the expiration of the &amp; mandatory system in Iraq, and containing the guarantees given to the Council by the Iraqi Government, in pursuance of which it formally pledged itself, among other things, to afford all inhabitants of Iraq full and complete protection of life and liberty, without distinction of birth, nationality, language, race or religion; 6. Notes that the representative of Iraq has on several occasions given assurances to the Committee of the Council that Iraq would take measures in favour of the Assyrian population, more particularly in the matter of security, health and assistance, while the efforts to arrange an emigration plan were in progress.

Enclosure in No. 1. Assyrian Question. Record of Thirty-Second Meeting of the Council Committee held on June 8 at 10 a.m. THE meeting was attended by Mr. Johnson of the Nansen Office. The President explained to Mr. Johnson that in pursuance of the Council’s resolution of the previous day the committee now proposed to make further efforts to find a place of settlement for the Assyrians, and they would be grateful for any suggestions which the Nansen Office could make regarding possible destinations. Mr. Johnson said that he had only just received the committee’s report to the Council and the rapporteur’s report upon it. He himself was in a somewhat difficult position as the president of the Nansen Office was at present ill in a nursing home and it had been specially requested that he should not be troubled with business during the whole of the present week. He had not, therefore, felt justified, until he knew what exactly the committee wished, in discussing the question of Assyrian settlement with him since the breakdown of the Brazilian scheme. He himself was instructed by his governing body to help the Council Committee in regard to the Brazilian scheme, but his instructions were at present limited to that. He did not wish in any way to suggest that the governing body would not be prepared to co-operate in finding an alternative solution. He could not, however commit them, and he suggested if the committee desired this co-operation they should address a communication in that sense to the governing body. With that reservation, Mr. Johnson observed that he knew there were other possibilities which appeared worth consideration. The President said that his request was so simple that he did not think it necessary to address a formal communication to the Nansen Office. JNatura y, e did not wish Mr. Johnson to go beyond his instructions or to commit the governing body in any way. But the committee merely desired to have an indication or possibilities elsewhere than in Brazil in the light of the Nansen Office s experience. He did not wish to press Mr. Johnson, however, if the latter did not thin v e cou go even so far as this. Mr. Johnson said that, on the contrary, he was perfectly ready o certain possibilities. He observed that while the Brazilian scheme was consideration he had submitted an alternative proposal for settlement m 1SS m the Argentine. In addition to this, there were other prospects m the Arge ^hich, at first sight, seemed attractive. The Nansen Office also knew o p [131 1—4]. V aT1 H in Paraguay, and from the purely technical point of view, al alT vent he prospeS^were good in these two countries. Moreover, Mr Johnson understood that several countries had recently indicated their wiliinoness to take fairly large bodies of Jewish refugees from Germany. His f Iwinn was to the effect that offers had been received from Mexico, British Honduras An^a Tanganyika, Kenya, South-West Africa, Ecuador and Colombia’ He would be glad to obtain more detailed information about hef^ offers and to see whether they could, if necessary, be adapted to the case of the Assyrian refugees. He suggested that three other countries deserving of con sideration were Abyssinia, the Belgian Congo and Mozambique. The President asked two questions. When Mr. Johnson said that these areas were possible, did he mean that they were possible merely from the technical noint of view or that the countries concerned were prepared to authorise Assyrian immigration? The president recalled that in Brazil the technical possibilities had been good, but that the scheme had broken down because of the failure of the Government to authorise immigration. I'ML Mr Johnson said that in the Argentine, Bolivia and Paraguay, the prospects were eood from the technical point of view. Moreover, the Nansen Office had already sent Russian refugees to these countries. As regards the other countries which he had mentioned, he was not aware of the attitude of the Governments concerned. He understood, however, that they were willing to accept Jewish refugees from Germany. Tho President took note of what Mb. Johnson had said, and added that the committee would begin the necessary exploration and if it found the Governments concerned ready to consider Assyrian immigration, it would probably take the same course as in the case of Brazil of inviting the co-operation of the Nansen Office. it that if a The Danish Representative asked whether, when Mr. Johnson said that certain schemes were suitable from the technical point of view, he was to be s understood as meaning that they were climatically suitable. Mr. Johnson replied that in his opinion the countries mentioned were suitable both from the climatic point of view and from the point of view of general settlement. „ , He asked whether he was to understand that it was still the desire or tne committee that the Nansen Office, in exploring possibilities, should not approach the Governments concerned. In this connexion he wished to point out that direct approach to Governments was not necessarily the best method of procedure. His experience had suggested that approaches to private interests offered the best prospect of success. The Nansen Office in its early days had begun by sending out broadcast appeals to Governments. These had been without result, and it had had to proceed on other lines—namely, to interest private concerns in certain proposals and work through those private concerns. Governments, if approached direct, were apt to return negative replies, as no Government really wanted refugees. On the other hand, if the Nansen Office were in a position to inform private interests that it had certain refugees for settlement who were likely to be satisfactory, influence could be brought to bear on the Governments concerned. The Danish Representative asked whether this was not a question of history rather than actuality. Was it possible, under present conditions, to ask private interests to take as many as 20,000 immigrants ? In any case, recent experience in Brazil had shown the disappointments which were likely when working through private interests. Ij^tkCo, The President said that the committee would bear in mind Mr. Johnsons observations, and, when it had decided how to proceed, it would no doubt ask the Nansen Office for further assistance. (Mr. Johnson then withdrew.) The President then asked the committee to consider what Governments should now be approached in pursuance of the Council’s resolution °1 tJie 7th June. The Secretariat had prepared a list of possible countries, and these were grouped according to varying conditions. It was proposed to send a lettei 'j 111 Syria Hep. fete ▼in the first place to certain members of the committee, namely Spain, the United Kingdom, Fiance and Italy. In the case of Canada and the Argentine from whom so far no reply had been received, g rather different form of letter would be required. Again it would be necessary to press Australia, South Africa and possibly New Zealand, to reconsider their previous decisions, and it was proposed that appeals should be made to certain countries not hitherto approached namelv ^Turkey, Greece, Holland and Portugal. In view of Mr. Johnson’s remarks the committee should perhaps consider also Bolivia and Paraguay. As certain members of the committee could spare little time in view of other meetings he suggested that the meeting should merely agree upon the general lines of the drafts to be sent out, leaving it to the president to approve the actual text. The United Kingdom Representative said that he had discussed possible drafts with the League Secretariat. So far as the countries represented on the committee were concerned, there was no difficulty. The Governments knew the facts and the importance and urgency of the problem. A simple appeal was all that was required. As regards other Governments, however, there was a point of principle on which the committee should take a decision. The original intention of the Secretariat had been to send out short letters, simply containino' a collection of documents leading up to the proceedings of the Council on the 7th June, and enquiring whether the Governments concerned were now prepared to consider favourably the possibility of receiving the Assyrians. In his view, this was not enough. The committee ought now to make a great final effort! He thought that if a mere enquiry and a number of documents were sent to Governments, the enquiry would not be very seriously considered. He thought that the letters ought to contain a recapitulation of the problem, so as to bring its importance and urgency at once to the attention of Governments. There was general agreement with the proposal of the United Kingdom representative, and it was decided that drafts should be circulated during the day, and that, if possible, the members of the committee should inform the president on the same day of any observations which they wished to make. In the absence of such observations by 7 p.m., the president would assume that the drafts were approved. The United Kingdom Representative said that he had been thinking over the question whether it was worth while approaching Australia and New Zealand again. He understood that, in the case of Australia, even if the political difficulties could be overcome, the only territory which might be made available was in the north-west. It was undeveloped territory, and settlement there would be a long and gradual process, even if investigation showed it to be practicable. The possibility could not, of course, be ruled out on that account, and he thought Australia ought to be approached once more. In the case of New Zealand, however, he did not think any useful purpose would be served by a fresh approach. It was agreed to approach Australia, but not New Zealand. The President then raised the question of communicating to the Assyrians the terms of the Council’s resolution of the 7th June. His view was that it would be most appropriate for the position to be explained to the Assyrians by the Iraqi Government, and, if the committee agreed, he would suggest to the Iraqi representative that his Government should take this course through the medium of the local committee under Major Thomson’s presidency. The president was authorised to act accordingly. t a r ^^ le ^ &gt;res ^ en t then referred to the request which the French representative ad made at the previous meeting regarding an approach to the Nansen Office, 111 order to have instructions sent to M. Burnier to co-operate with the French authorities in Syria in regard to the transfer to Syria of the families now in Iiaq ° on 6 Ass T rians w h° Aod to Syria last summer. The president suggested that the committee should take note of the present position of this question, and should send a letter to the Nansen Office on the lines esired by the French representative.The French Representative said that he would like the letter to the Nansen Office to mention the French Government’s letter of the 9th January (C.Min.Ass.18), and he hoped that the Nansen Office might be approached urgently and asked to send telegraphic instructions to M. Burnier. M. Arocha questioned the advisability of sending the French Government’s letter of the 9th January to the Nansen Office. The first condition laid down^ in that letter was that the French Government should act under a mandate from'^ the Council of the League, and it was not within the power of the committee to decide upon such a mandate. The French Representative said that the important points were the third and fourth conditions laid down in the French Government’s letter of the 9th January. The French Government were particularly anxious to have the assistance of the Nansen Office representative in certain aspects of the question. They attached particular importance to the accounts being kept by a neutral person. It was agreed that the French representative and M. Arocha should draw up the terms of a draft letter to the Nansen Office for the president’s approval. The Danish Representative referred to a proposal which had been made at an earlier meeting, that a letter should be addressed to the Spanish Ambassador in Rio de Janeiro, thanking him for the work he had done on behalf of the committee in connexion with the Brazilian scheme. The President suggested that the drafting of this letter should be left to The Danish Representative said that he would like the letter to be more than a mere formality. He thought that the Spanish Ambassador had had a very difficult and disagreeable task, and had made great efforts on behalf of the committee. Moreover, his judgment throughout had been justified by events, and he would like the letter of thanks to be a very warm tribute to the Ambassador. The United Kingdom Representative associated himself with this suggestion. j M. Arocha raised the question whether the letters which it was proposed to address to various Governments should be communicated for information to the Iraqi representative. It was agreed that this should be done. The President observed that certain explanations which the Iraqi repre sentative had been asked to obtain regarding the situation reports of his overnment had never been received. He thought that the Iraqi representative ought to be reminded, and while he was perfectly prepared to do this orally, he preferred to do it by letter. i j r r j i . It was agreed that this would be preferable in order to mark the importance 1C ^ ^ commi ttee attached to the matter, though the letters should, of course, be worded very courteously. ^ further short discussion took place regarding the appeals to Governments, 1 ;I a ^ a r I&gt;eed m P resent circumstances, it would be preferable not to in relation to ttoBelg^aTconlo. ^ WaS deClded ’ however ’ to approach Belgium m h.T 'A'n!' 1 h a ''' t ^ at ’ as regards future procedure, he did not think it res-ardinp- the . fi coni * m y ee to meet again unless serious difficulties arose th?ref d ore § denen d H nn a P peals t l ° va nous Governments.

Record of the Twenty-eighth Meeting of the Council Committee, held on May 31, 1934, at 3-30 p.m. THE PRESIDENT said that he wished to give his personal impressions on the situation which had now arisen. He first drew attention to the memorandum circulated by the Secretariat (C.Min.Ass.39), describing the approaches made to various Governments, and the replies received. M.

The letter said that the situa ion had become worse since Brigadier Browne’s return, and that opinion expresse both in the press and in Parliament was almost unanimous against accep mg the Assyrians. The president felt that, while the Brazilian Government s attitude was not definitely known, there was evidently much less hope tnan e T ) ^ e as regards the Brazilian scheme—in fact, there was practically no ope. e Secretariat’s memorandum showed that all countries approached, excep e Argentine and Canada, had returned an unfavourable reply. He thoug i was fairly clear that no favourable reply could be expected from the Argen me, an the United Kingdom representative at an earlier stage had reterre o difficulties in Canada. He wondered, therefore, whether as the Counci was now meeting, the committee ought not to take the opportunity of referring e N' question back to it. They could say that they had done their tuiii tne task given to them by the Council; that, although the attitude of e ra ^ „ , Government was not yet officially known, the position there was not J°P e ’ that the committee had no indication that any other Governments wou a favourable replv; that the situation of the Assyrians meanwhi e g av ® anxiety; and that the committee thought it necessarytherefore, 0 . whole problem to the Council for the latter to take a decision as to further actiom The president added that the position of the Assyrians was eviden y g g worse every day, and the months ahead were the most dangerous 111 7 ' The committee, therefore, could not take the heavy responsibi i y o T g report until September. It was possible, of course, to object that so long as the Brazilian Government had not definitely declared then a i u e, [131 f—1] Bunnecessary to do anything. This was no doubt partly right, but he thought it was inadvisable to be too juridical and formal. The basis of the despatch of the Mission of Investigation to Brazil was a message from the Spanish Assyrians under certain conditions. that settlement was now im The Italian Representative said that the main point was the urgency of the problem. It had always been realised that a quick solution was necessary. Now that the Brazilian scheme was obviously hopeless and the prospect of obtaining replies from other Governments was remote, to continue the process of obtaining formal replies from every Government, in order to say that every possibility had been exhausted, would only prolong the delay. He shared the president’s view, therefore, and thought that as the Council was in session, it was the duty of the committee to place the problem once more before it. The responsibility of not doing so was one which the committee could not take. The Mexican Representative could, not see any prospect of a solution between the present time and September. The committee’s last report to the Council would have created a somewhat optimistic view regarding the possibilities of the Brazilian scheme, and he thought it really urgent to let the Council know the position. 2 Brazilian Government would accept the nditions. A message from the same source, indicating., practicable, seemed to him good enough. &lt;* The Danish Representative said that he fully shared the president’s anxiety about delaying a report, but he thought that the committee must make up its mind as to what could be expected from the Council if the question was referred to that body. It seemed to him that the Council would first ask certain questions. 1 hey would ask why the committee had not pursued negotiations with the countries which had been approached. In this connexion he asked whether the countries mentioned in the League Secretariat’s memorandum were really all that had been approached by the committee. His impression was that more had been approached, and that other possibilities suggested by the Nansen Office had also been considered. In the second place, he expected that the Council would ask whether the committee could not make some definite proposal. It was not enough merely to tell the public through the Council that the committee had failed m lts task. The only result would be to create depression among the Assyrians and m the League. The United Kingdom Representative said he realised the necessity of repor mg o the Council that the Brazilian scheme had broken down once this tact had been definitely established. He could not agree, however, that the cqmmi ee would be justified in reporting in that sense to the Council at present, femce the Spanish Ambassador’s telegram of the 25th May, certain more detailed r ad . b .T n re £ eiv ? d froni His Majesty’s Ambassador in Bio.

They had merek- addressed an enquiry to certain Governments, and had meanwhile investigated a scheme which happened to be available in the archives of the Nansen Office That scheme had been found suitable, and the committee had not therefore followed up the search for alternatives. He felt strongly that, if the Brazilian ^cheme failed, it would be necessary for the committee to approach once more those Governments which had either not yet replied finally or had returned an equivocal reply, and also to consider whether any other Governments should be approached. For instance, no official request had yet been addressed to the Governments represented on the committee itself, though the various members had undertaken at an earlier stage to find out whether their Governments would be prepared to accept the Assyrians. He could not, of course, say whether it would be possible to find an alternative, but, at all events, the Governments concerned would probably view the matter in a different light’once the Brazilian scheme was definitely out of the running. He did not think that the committee needed any fresh mandate from the Council to continue this further search, and indeed, it need not necessarily await a definite reply from the Brazilian Government before beginning it. Furthermore, the United Kingdom representative strongly supported the view which had been expressed by the Danish representative that, before referring the question to the Council, it was necessary to consider what action the Council could take. The question of the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq, if there was long delay, had been raised, and he thought this needed very careful considera tion by the committee before anything was said to the Council. It was true that the terms of reference of the committee laid upon it no specific task in relation to this aspect of the question. The rapporteur’s report of last October had merely expressed the hope that the Iraqi Government would keep the committee regularly informed of the position. That, of course, implied that the committee was to concern itself to some extent with the situation of the Assyrians, and it could not shirk this task. It had, of course, no power to take any special measures, but, at all events, the United Kingdom representative thought that, before any reference was made to the Council, the committee ought to see the Iraqi representative and ask him what measures the Iraqi Government proposed to take in view of the delay which must now be anticipated. The French Representative, who had entered the meeting rather late, expressed himself, after the position had been explained to him, as being in favour of reporting to the Council that the committee had exhausted the possibilities and asking for fresh instructions. The President said that he would answer the remarks made by the Danish representative first. If the committee did not report the position to the Council, and if anything were to happen in Iraq between now and September, the committee would be responsible. The Danish representative had intimated that, by referring the matter to the Council, the latter might be placed in a difficult position and would ask certain questions of the committee. The president said that this prospect did not worry him. The Council was the proper organ to take tne necessary decisions. It might ask the committee to continue its work and to press other Governments to accept the Assyrians. If so, he was perfectly prepared to continue the committee’s task. If he recommended a report now, it was because the Council was sitting. Had that not been the case, his action mi ght have been different, but it must be realised that this was not a mere question of whether this Government or that had returned a definite reply. In be present economic situation of the world, it was obviously a most difficult pioblem to settle so many people, and he did not think there was any prospect ot any country accepting the Assyrians. He would be glad to take all responsi- Pity for any course which offered a solution, but he had the conviction that it was going to be extremely difficult to find a solution. The more delay there was, .A U° re danger to the Assyrians. He did not attach too much importance to e Mar Shimun’s petitions, or to the press campaign which was being carried on, but the Assyrian situation was obviously delicate. He did not think it would e necessary to say definitely that there was no hope of settling the Assyrians, » least the committee ought to say that they feared settlement in Brazil °nld be impossible, and that, while they had no reply from certain Govern- [131 f—1] 1 b 2ments e.q., Canada, they had no reason to hope that these countries would be willing to accept the Assyrians. He admitted that this was all hypothetical, but he thought it necessary to give the Council a true picture of the situation. The United Kingdom Representative said that he did not think the alternative lay between an immediate report and a report to the Council nuN September. It would be open to the committee at any moment to report to the** Council if it thought that the situation required it. The President interjected that it would be difficult to expect the Council to meet for the Assyrian question alone. The United Kingdom Representative said that he thought that that would be for the Council to decide, and they would have to do so with due regard for the seriousness of the situation. In any case he thought that the committee ought to be o-uided chiefly not by considerations of its own responsibility, but by what was going to be in the best ultimate interests of the Assyrians. He felt himself that to rush matters at the moment was not going to be in the best interests of the Assyrians. The whole question obviously needed the most careful consideration before any action was taken. The Danish Representative asked of what utility the Council could really be in protecting the Assyrians between now and September. The action of the Council would in any 'case depend to a large extent on the proposals which the six Governments represented on the committee could bring to the Council. If these six Governments, with their knowledge of the problem, failed to make any proposal, surely the prospect of a useful decision by the Council was small. When it was known that the Brazilian scheme had failed, the juridical point whether there was an official Brazilian reply to this effect or not might not matter very much; but while the committee need not take too juridical a view on that matter, let it beware of taking too juridical a point of view regarding the necessity of reference of the question at this stage to the Council. It was necessary to think out what the Council could do. If the Council were to meet to-morrow and receive a negative report, what would happen the day after in Iraq? The present proposal to refer the matter to the Council was a negative one. It contained no positive suggestion. He agreed that it was not so much the responsibility of the committee that was involved as the interests of the Assyrians. The President agreed that it was inadvisable to take too juridical an attitude; at the same time the committee must not go beyond its mandate. It was not bound to make proposals to the Council. The Council might certainly ask the committee to take on a further task. If the Assyrians could not leave Iraq, the Council might ask what the committee proposed. They might ask the committee to consider the question of resettlement in Iraq, or they might set up some other body for that purpose. In any case, with or without a report to the Council at this stage, the news of the failure of the Brazilian scheme was bound to become public, and his desire was to report to the Council at once in order to clear up an equivocal situation. He was quite ready to meet the United Kingdom representa tive to the extent of intimating that the prospects of settlement, though doubtful, were not yet exhausted, but he was opposed to letting the matter drag on without any report to the Council until September. Even a report, say in a fortnight s time when the Council had risen, would not be sufficient. He must adhere to his intention of reporting to the Council at its present session. He hoped that the committee would be able to agree unanimously on this course. So far the committee had proceeded by unanimity, and he did not wish to have to resort to a majority vote. He himself had unfortunately to leave the committee in order to attend another meeting. He suggested that the members of the committee should, in his absence, continue to discuss the matter in private, in the hope that the anish representative, at all events, would be able to change his opinion. The United Kingdom Representative said that he thought there was much more to be done before a report could be presented to the Council. The latter would naturally be anxious about the situation in Iraq, and would want to know row the committee proposed to deal with this. It was impossible for the committee, at short notice and without giving the Iraqi Government any chance o consider the situation, to go to the Council and to report that the situation of ae Assyi lans was precarious. The committee certainly had no power to ask the5 tk that K| i k^ardj mitteeraM bnt k flu J ? fi hiisf|; ; l 5t interests til efnl coDsidal cilcoiri Hie actios I j oposals ilj the Coicil ailed to mtii wassmi.1 Iraqi Government to adopt any particular measures, but at least they oun-ht to consult with the Iraqi representative and allow him time to refer to his Govern ment as to whether any particular measures for safeguarding the Assyrians were practicable. The Danish Representative agreed that the position of the Government of Iraq in the event of an immediate report to the Council ought to be taken into consideration. The Italian Representative suggested that the report should be merely an objective one describing what the situation was at the moment. J The United Kingdom Representative again urged that for this the committee ought to try to find out definitely what the attitude of the Brazilian Government was. It was quite possible to send a telegram immediately, and the reply should not be long delayed. The President said that he might consider a telegram to the Brazilian Government, but in any case he must insist on a report to the Council at the present session. The Danish Representative asked whether the Iraqi delegate was aware of the Spanish Ambassador ’s latest telegram. M. Arocha replied in the negative. The Iraqi permanent delegate was on leave and M. Shabandar was at present in charge. He had merely informed M. Shabandar that the prospects of the Brazilian scheme were at present poor. The Danish Representative said that this raised the whole question of the relation of the committee with Iraq. It was the duty of the committee, under its terms of reference, to keep in touch with the Iraqi representative about the situation of the Assyrians, and he thought the Iraqi representative must certainly be approached before a report was made to the Council. The President said that this was not, of course, excluded. The president then left the meeting and a private discussion followed between the remainder of the members. Discussion was somewhat confused and it is unnecessary to report it in detail. It was eventually agreed that it would be an advantage to clear up the Brazilian Government’s attitude if possible before reporting to the Council, and that it would be necessary to consult the Iraqi representative. The United Kingdom Representative made it clear that he would have no objection to reporting to the Council that the Brazilian scheme had failed once this was definitely established. In his view, the report ought to go on to say that the committee was naturally pursuing other alternatives, but that it had con sidered it necessary to report the situation to the Council in view of the delay involved. Reference might also be made to the anxiety which the committee felt regarding the situation of the Assyrians during this delay, and the report might say that the committee—although not invested with any powers in this matter under its terms of reference—had nevertheless taken it up with the Iraqi Govern ment and would report again to the Council if need arose. It was agreed that a telegram to the Spanish Ambassador at Rio de Janeiro should be drafted for consideration at a meeting at 9 p.m. J. C.

United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, June 4, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Assyrian Question. Record of the Twenty-Ninth Meeting of the Council Committee, held on May 31, 1934, at 9 p.m. THE meeting had before it a draft telegram (Annex A) to the Spanish Ambassador at Rio de Janeiro, which had been prepared by the United Kingdom representative and M. Arocha. The President said that he was ready to send this telegram, subject to two observations : Firstly, if, when the final moment arrived for putting the question on the agenda of the Council during its present session, no reply had come from the Spanish Ambassador, he reserved the right to raise the question again of referring the matter to the Council. Secondly, if a reply were received which was indefinite, he also maintained his wish to refer to the Council, unless, of course, the reply showed that real hope of carrying through the Brazilian scheme still existed, in spite of present expectations. The Italian, Mexican and French Representatives agreed to the text with the same reservations. The Danish Representative agreed to the text and to a fresh meeting to consider reference to the Council in the cases contemplated by the president. The President then suggested that a draft of a report to the Council should be drawn up, and that it should be worded in such a way as to try to meet the difficulties of those members of the committee who did not at present ^ a report to the Council. He thought that it should be very concise, and should simply report to the Council that the Brazilian scheme had failed, and that, though the prospects of settlement elsewhere had not been exhausted, no suitable alternative was at present feasible. The Danish Representative asked whether it was not proposed to put anything in the report about the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq. The President replied that on this point he had not yet made up his mind. The Danish Representative said that, if the situation of the Assyrians were 0 be mentioned, the committee ought to consider first, with the Iraqi repre sentative, the situation created by the decision of the Brazilian Cons i uen Assembly. oo ■Furthermore, there were points in the latest situation reports (C. Min. A.® 8 - and 38) submitted by the Iraqi Government which required comment. Ine s a ^ e health in the refugee camp at Mosul was alarming. [131 f—2]The President agreed that the situation would have to be discussed with the Iraqi representative before a report were made to the Council. If, however, th matter were to be discussed with him, the committee must prevent him froi disclaiming responsibility and placing it upon the committee. The Danish Representative said that it would, of course, no doubt h necessary for the Iraqi representative to refer to his Government before he coulj say anything definite. The United Kingdom Representative said that this would certainly be the case if the committee intended to make any specific suggestion to the Iraqi representative. The President asked what suggestions the United Kingdom representative would propose. The United Kingdom Representative said that this would very largely depend on what the committee decided to do with the latest petitions from the Mar Shimun (C. Min. Ass. 37 and 40). An earlier petition of the 3rd May had been referred to the Iraqi Government for observations. Was it proposed to follow the same procedure with the new petitions, and was it proposed to make any reference to these petitions in reporting to the Council ? The President expressed the view that the committee ought to follow the ordinary minorities procedure. In reply to an observation by M. Arocha, that if the Council had removed the question from the ordinary minorities procedure, it might perhaps be supposed to have left liberty to the Assyrian Committee to deal with further petitions, he said that, naturally, the committee had a wide discretion, but the Iraqi Government, on their side, could not be expected to do anything which they would not be required to do under the ordinary minorities procedure. He thought that the best course for the committee to take was to act precisely as though it was a Committee of Three. It would be guided by the Minorities Section as to whether the petitions were receivable and what procedure should be adopted regarding them. M. Arocha said that the usual course was for the secretariat to decide whether the petitions were receivable. In the affimative case, they were referred to the Government concerned for observations, and usually were not circulated to the Council until the observations of the Government concerned had been received. The President said that he was quite prepared to follow the same procedure in this case. He agreed that if a report were made to the Council it would be necessary to mention the Assyrian situation, and he would like to summon the Iraqi representative, and ask him what the Iraqi Government proposed to do if settlement in Brazil proved impossible. M. Arocha suggested that the report should mention that the committee understood its task to be only to find land for settlement, and not to include any responsibility for the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq. Also, the committee might profit by the present occasion to try to send out some sort of independent observer to Iraq. The President said that as regards tlm first, nnint bp did not think it wasterms^tcTthTsitimtion^f theAssyria^s^ He ZugKpartkullr tf 6 ^ 1 allude to the unsatisfactory situation at present existing in the camp inl^ much too high “ ' a S Which had recen % taken pL' was ' In the somewhat confused discussion which followed, mention was made of the possibility of the committee proceeding with the task of resettlement in Iraa if the prospects of settlement outside Iraq were unfavourable. 4 )yM,Ai^| noritiesfit ee to take i tkwereil Council it® like to it propose 1 0^ The President said that the problem of settlement in Iraq could only arise when the possibility of settlement outside had definitely been ruled out. The two tasks could not be pursued simultaneously, but so long as the question of settlement outside Iraq was under consideration, a certain responsibility would rest upon the committee if it did not draw the attention of the Council to the dangers involved in delay. M. A rocha took the view that if the committee’s work were suspended pending a definite reply from Brazil and in the meantime something happened in Iraq, the committee could hardly escape responsibility for having left the Assyrians to the mercy of the Iraqi Government, if they had taken no special steps to satisfy themselves that the situation of the Assyrians was satisfactory. The report to the Council might make it clear that neither the committee nor the Council had, in fact, any responsibility. At the same time, it might be a useful preventive measure to have some independent observer in Iraq to watch affairs. The President said that he agreed as regards the report to the Council. The question of an independent observer, however, was an extremely difficult one, and would be best left until the question of resettlement in Iraq arose. The Danish Representative said at the same time it would be extremely useful if the Iraqi Government could be induced to offer some form of independent investigation. General agreement was expressed with this view. The President then repeated that his idea was that the report to the Council should be purely objective and confined to facts. It should be left to the rapporteur to express any opinion. It might be that the rapporteur would wish to suggest that the Council should decide whether the committee should proceed further in its search for a destination, or whether the idea of settlement outside Iraq could now be abandoned. In the latter case, it might be necessary to contemplate immediate measures for settlement in Iraq and to appoint a special League Committee to consider this matter, or to give the present committee further powers. Alternatively, of course, the matter might be left entirely m the hands of the Iraqi Government. The drafting of the rapporteur s report would naturally be a matter of some difficulty, and would have to take into account the views of all concerned, but he thought it was best that the committee s report should be confined entirely to facts, and that the conclusions should be left to the rapporteur. The Danish and United Kingdom Representatives expressed some doubt whether they could agree entirely with this procedure. The United Kingdom Representative, in particular, urged a &amp; a ^ committee should not abandon the idea of settlement outside Iraq at the present stage, or encourage the Council to do so. Every effort n ^ a e i T 0 Wanc;p new destination. The committee had no right to shirk this du y simp , it would take time. The real question which they had to face was whether they were honestly prepared to leave the Assyrians under presen circums . Iraq without further effort. Various possible destinations were then discussed. It was pointed out that the Mar Shimun had suggested Canada, Turkey and Syria. M. A rocha said that he had ascertained from a ^ ar L^h secretariat that there was definitely no chance of ^ ^ ste( j g yr i a&gt; agreeing. M. Arocha pointed out that the Mar Shimun ha(Cr f?r The French Representative indicated that this was a veiy difficult question. The United Kingdom Representative asked whether the possibility of settlement in the Lebanon had been considered by the French Government, and SSETS ~ possible » tope'or anrthing m that the Lebanon was predominantly Christian, and naturally suggested itself therefore. The French Representative feared that the Lebanon was quite impossible, mainly for economic reasons. In reply to a question, he said that it was not a matter of finding the necessary finance for settlement. It was rather a question of general economic and labour conditions in the Lebanon. The President said that he was quite prepared unofficially to sound the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs as to whether settlement m Turkey was possible He was also prepared to sound the Greek representative as to whether there was any hope in Crete, which had been tentatively suggested m general discussion As regards the rapporteur's report, he hoped to get a unanimous report on the basis of facts as they were. He must, however, reserve his liberty as rapporteur regarding the contents of the report which he would have to furnish to the Council as rapporteur It was agreed that a meeting should be held with the Iraqi representative on the following day to ask questions about the latest situation report from the Iraqi Government. ' It was also agreed that the Iraqi representative should be informed of the position in Brazil. Meanwhile, the President asked the United Kingdom representative, in spite of the fact that the latter was not at present in favour of a report to the Council, whether he would assist the committee by preparing the draft of a report which might be presented to the Council if the Brazilian attitude were cleared up. The United Kingdom Representative said that, in all the circumstances, he hardly felt able to accept this task, and on his proposal it was entrusted to M. Arocha. J. C. STERNDALE BENNETT. Annex A.

Record of the Thirtieth Meeting of the Council Committee held on June 1, 1934. at 3-30 p.m. THE members of the committee first met in private to decide on the line to take with the Iraqi representative, who had been asked to attend. The President and the majority of the committee were at first opposed to speaking to the Iraqi representative at this stage about the responsibility of the Iraqi Government during the period of delay which must be anticipated if the Brazilian scheme definitely failed. They were inclined to leave this until after a report had been presented to the Council. The United Kingdom and Danish representatives, however, urged that it was necessary to take this question up before the committee reported to the Council, and that it might save time to speak to the Iraqi representative now on a hypothetical basis rather than call a further special meeting for the purpose before reporting to the Council. Eventually, it was decided to follow this course. P 16 question was also discussed of suggesting to the Iraqi representative for ■ his Government’s consideration that they should take the initiative in offering some form of independent investigation into the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq. It was decided that while some such suggestion might be opportune, it would be better for the president to make it privately rather than in a full meeting of the committee. (M. Shabandar then joined the meeting.) President said that he had invited M. Shabandar in order to explain to him the present situation, and to ask certain questions arising out of the recen reports of the Iraqi Government. M. Shabandar would be aware of the agitation which had for some time past been carried on in Brazil against the Assyrian emigration scheme. The committee had recently received reports which showed that the situation in Brazil was now worse. A law had been voted which a ^ c ec ), the problem, in the sense of making emigration more difficult. The attitude o he Brazilian Government towards the Assyrian scheme in the light oi lese developments was not yet known, and the committee had taken steps to clear up he position. Meanwhile, they wished to tell IVI. Shabandar that the prospec s o he Brazilian scheme ivere unfortunately bad. As regards other countries, e prospects were not at present very favourable either. Various alterna iveo remained to be considered, and it was too early to say that they would not offer p s °lution, but at present no concrete solution was visible. The commit ee ere °re feared that there might be a longer delay than had hitherto been amicipa e , [131 f—3]or what would be worse, it might even be found impossible to put any scheme of settlement outside Iraq into effect, in which case it would be necessary to contem plate the continued residence of the Assyrians in Iraq. The committee thought that the Iraqi Government would wish to prevent either of these eventualities from having unfortunate repercussions by taking special measures for the security and welfare of the Assyrians. The committee would like to know what measure# the Iraqi Government would take. M. Shabandar was probably not in a position to reply at present, but he would, no doubt, wish to refer the matter to his Government. M. Shabandar said that he was not in a position to give a definite reply, though he could indicate certain probabilities. The Iraqi Government had long known the difficulties in Brazil, and he knew that if a long delay were to be anticipated before the Assyrians could be settled outside Iraq, the Iraqi Govern ment might find it difficult to maintain the refugee camp at Mosul. Provision for that camp had only been made up to September next, and he believed the Iraqi Government had under consideration the idea of distributing the refugees among various villages under the care of the headman of the village and with some financial provision for their maintenance by the headman. 2 . iatai „ jsible wi s limit to this Eiiltliimselfal liioathatth L| to should- put a report to thf Ijfflieiit what o Ikmas in Ir The President said that M. Shabandar would no doubt wish to consult his Government before going into further details. As regards the present situation of the Assyrians in Iraq, M. Olivdn recalled that at a recent meeting with the Iraqi permanent delegate, the committee had referred to an apparent contradiction in previous Iraqi Government reports regarding the reconstruction of villages destroyed in the events of last summer. Was M. Shabandar yet in a position to reply on this point? M. Shabandar replied that the point had been referred the Iraqi Government immediately after the last meeting which Taufiq Beg had attended. So far, no reply had been received, and he thought that the Iraqi Government must be waiting for Major Thomson to deal with the matter on his return. Major Thomson was furnishing a number of reports, and no doubt the question of the villages would appear among them. The^ President then turned to the Iraqi Government’s report of the 16th May C.

He Avould then go on to say that in these circumstances, so long as the committee’s deliberations were continuing, the life of the Assyrian population was, so to speak, suspended, and its normal activities inevitably interfered with • land the Council must, from the point of view of the rapporieur, approach the question as one of urgency. Unless the Council thought that the task of the committee was finished, he would suggest instructions to the committee to make every effort to arrive at a (quick solution on the settlement problem by examinin°' as speedily as possible what prospects offered themselves. He did not propose to set a time limit to this task, but he would suggest that if, after a reasonable time (he thought himself about the beginning of September), the committee arrived at the conclusion that there was no suitable prospect of settling the Assyrians outside Iraq, they should—without waiting to refer to the Council, but in time to present a report to the Council at its September meeting—examine with the Iraqi Government what conditions the latter would envisage for the resettlement of the Assyrians in Iraq, in accordance with the Council’s resolution of December 1932. M. Olivdn said that he was considering a report on these lines in the hope of providing a compromise between the two views which had been expressed on the committee. The committee would still be free to exhaust the possibilities else where than in Brazil, and, of course, if any good prospect offered itself, they would naturally pursue it in preference to entering into the question of resettle ment in Iraq; but he wished to avoid the necessity of the committee waiting to consider resettlement in Iraq until the September meeting of the Council, if before then they came to the conclusion that this was the only course to take. The United Kingdom Representative said that he would like time to consider this suggestion, which he realised was put forward in the hope of compromise. At first sight his only comment would be to ask the committee to consider the possible effect on the Assyrians of referring at this stage to resettlement in Iraq. It was desirable not to do anything which would encourage those Assyrians who felt they could not stay in Iraq to take the law into their own hands and stage another exodus. Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that the Council’s resolution of December 1932 was apparently not acceptable to, at all events, a section of the Assyrians. It had been their opposition to the execution of that resolution which had led directly to the troubles of last summer. The President objected that this difficulty was bound to arise sooner or later if settlement outside Iraq were impossible. The committee could not delay indefinitely because of that. The United Kingdom Representative emphasised that he was not opposing M. Olivan’s suggestion at the present time. He would like to reflect on it. His only object for the time being was to put forward at once certain considerations which the committee ought to bear in mind. The President said that the question of a report to the Council did not now appear to be quite so urgent, as he had ascertained from the President of the Council and the Secretary-General of the League that the Council would certainly last until Wednesday next, the 6th June, and might even go on longer. He thought, therefore, that it would be sufficient if the committee met again on Monday, the 4th June. This would give time for a reply from the Spanish Ambassador in Rio, and would also give time for M. Arocha to complete a draft report. J. C.

United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, June 6, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Assyrian Question. Record of Thirty-first Meeting of the Council Committee held on June 5, 1934, at 3-30 p.m. THE meeting had before it a draft report to the Council prepared by the Secretariat. The President said that before considering this draft he wished to inform the committee of conversations which he had had with the Iraqi representative and the Persian delegate. He had seen the Iraqi representative on the 3rd June and had suggested unofficially the advisability of allowing an opportunity for some neutral observer to see what was the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq. M. Shabandar could not, of course, commit himself, but appeared to understand the advantage of this suggestion and to be personally in favour of it. M. Shabandar had then asked M. Olivan for his opinion as regards the prospects of settling the Assyrians outside Iraq. M. Olivan had told him frankly that in his personal opinion the prospects were very poor. He made it clear, however, that, whereas he had first of all been speaking as the interpreter of the committee, he was on this latter point expressing his purely personal views, which were not necessarily those of the committee as a whole. The president said that he had also spoken to the Persian delegate about the prospects of the Assyrians being settled in Persia. The Persian delegate had been most emphatic. ' He had said that not only was he authorised to say that his , Government were not ready to admit the Assyrians, but it was their desire that ^ the Assyrians should be settled outside Iraq as far away as possible from Persia. The president added that he would as opportunity offered speak to the representatives of Turkey and Greece. The meeting then considered the draft report to the Council. On the suggestion of the Danish Representative, the paragraph which referred to divergent tendencies in the committee was redrafted so as to show that two courses °f action had been discussed in the committee but without implying that there was a conflict in the committee between two opposing parties. With this ana certain minor textual amendments, the report was adopted. The President then said that he wished to discuss informally with the committee the draft of the report which as rapporteur he would have to present k&gt; the Council and the draft resolution which that report would propose. was agreed to strengthen that section of the draft resolution which referred to an appeal to Governments to consider favourably further approaches which mig pe made to them by the Assyrian Committee. The members of the commi ee indicated that, with this modification, they were in complete agreement with the raft report and the draft resolution.

These conditions had been formulated at the instance of the High Commissioner, who thought it necessary to have a mandate from the League of Nations m the him to meet nationalist opposition in Syria. The High Commissioner also required the good offices of the Nansen Office to supervise the emigration and to make sure that Assyrians in Iraq, who had, m fact, no relatives in Syria, did not take the opportunity of slipping into Syria. The High Commissioner also wished the Nansen representative to be responsible for keeping the accounts relating to the maintenance of the families in question. The French repre- j sentative therefore, wished to request the committee to take the necessary action with the Nansen Office in Geneva to ensure that M Burmer should be informed of the question and instructed to put himself in touch with M. de Martel, to assist in its snlntirm The President proposed that at the next meeting of the committee M. Werner of the Nansen Office should be invited to attend. His presence would, m any case, be useful as the committee would have to discuss what countries were to be asked to reconsider the question of receiving the Assyrians, assuming that the Council adopted the resolution now proposed. The United Kingdom Representative said that he would like to draw attention to one point. In the Mar Shimun’s petition of the 30th May (C, Min. Ass. 40), it had been alleged that a further massacre had been attempted at Diana on the night of the 29th—30th April last and that it had been prevented only by the intervention of the British vice-consul. The Foreign Office had at once sent a telegram to His Majesty’s Embassy at Bagdad to ascertain the facts and had now received the following reply :— ££ Your telegram of 31st May. ££ Facts are as follows :— £ £ On date mentioned Iraqi authorities wished to round up and arrest about twelve Assyrians from Persia, who had secreted themselves in Diana; police sergeant request the aid of the military, who searched and probably occupied some old trenches around the village. Six Assyrians were caught and are serving sentence of one month’s imprisonment, pending return to Persia. Action of police and military, naturally, alarmed the villagers, and gave rise to charge and counter-charge that both sides were digging trenches with a view to hostilities. No undue violence was used, the vice-consul did not intervene and life returned to normal. Police sergeant has been punished for his panicky conduct.” The President observed that the Mar Shimun evidently gave a very free interpretation to the word * £ massacre.” J. C.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 94 of the 3rd May, I have the honour to inform you that I carried out an extensive Jour of the Assyrian settlements in Northern Iraq from the 21st to the 29th April. 2. I visited about twenty villages in all, some by car and some of the more inaccessible villages on horseback, and was accompanied by an interpreter who was thoroughly conversant with the Syriac language. I also saw representative gatherings of Assyrians, including the three bishops, Mar Yusuf, Mar Sergis and Mar Yoalaha, at half a dozen convenient centres. Nights were spent at Mosul, Dohuk, Amadiyah and Diana, and I was enabled, through the courtesy of the Iraqi authorities and the unusual clemency of the weather, to accomplish the two main objects of my tour. These were to listen patiently to what Assyrians of all shades of opinion had to say about the present position and to give them sound advice as regards the future. 3. In my many talks with the Assyrians I was at pains to observe an attitude of strict impartiality. I never referred to the Mar Shimun or to the factions into which the community was divided, or to the possibility of settle ment in two separate batches. Nor did I mention Brazil as the country provisionally selected by the League of Nations for a new home. The advice that I gave to all was to continue their normal occupations, either by working on the fields or plying their trades as before, until the time came for them to leave Iraq, if they decided to do so after hearing what the local committee had to offer. This committee, I told them, would tour the Assyrian villages when a new country had been definitely selected by the League for Assyrian resettlement. In the meantime, I urged them to be patient and law- abiding; to avoid panic and mass movements, which would invite pillage by their neighbours and give rise to misunderstandings with the Government; to bring freely to the notice of the local Iraqi authorities, or to the British Administrative Inspector (Major Wilson), or the Settlement Officer (Major Thomson), any reasonable requests to enable them to continue a normal life. Above all, to do their best to cultivate the goodwill of the Iraqi Government and the neighbouring tribes of Kurds, Arabs and Yezidis, which I explained to them was the only practical means of guaranteeing the future happiness and security of those who elected to remain in Iraq. I assured them that it was the definite policy of the Iraqi Government to afford them all reasonable protection and assistance, and that when the committee visited them every Assyrian who was an ex-Ottoman subject would be given a free choice whether to stay in the country oi leave. They must understand, however, that such a large emigration scheme was inevitably complicated by political and financial considerations and would take a long time to complete. In the meanwhile, it was their plain duty to cany on and work as best they were able and at all costs to avoid pauperising themselves. I said that whatever new country accepted them would expect to receive woi 'ei s and not loafers or temporary settlers; in other words, the Assyrians shorn ma ve np their minds to abandon the role of refugees and settle down as permanent citizens of the State of their adoption. -p n i 4. Although the advice which I gave to the Assyrians was the same tor a 1, the comments which they made to me on the present situation were WK e &gt; different in the various districts which I visited. They w r ere unanimous on vo points, viz., their anxiety to be acquainted as soon as possible with e o er o the League in regard to a new home, and their unabated confidence m Great Britain to show them svmpathy and support. [131 f—4] 2T 5 JUL v tThe Assyrians of the Shaikhan district professed undisguised apprehension as to their future security. They complained that nearly all their villages had been looted and partially destroyed in one week following the 11th August. They admitted, however, 'that the Iraqi Government had satisfactorily repaired those villages which they had agreed to reoccupy and had offered to provide them with the means for sowing their crops. On the other hand, very little had bt ' paid to them in compensation, and they were so disgusted at the treatment that they had received from their neighbours and so apprehensive of the future that they declined to do any work in the fields and were merely awaiting the signal to leave Iraq. In one village which I visited, however, I found that the headman, who was an ex-levy officer, had courageously followed Major Thomson’s advice and had persuaded the villagers to accept the Iraqi Government s assistance and to till their fields as before. In this village there was no distress and a bumper crop was confidently expected. This solitary exception serves to emphasise the wrong-headedness and obstinacy of the inhabitants of the other villages in declining to move a finger to help themselves. They were frankly living on their savings and the charity of friends still serving in the levies, and, when these resources fail, they must either work or become destitute. It should be noted that the villages in this area were pillaged only after they had been evacuated, and that not a single Assyrian man, woman or child was killed or even wounded throughout the disturbances. 5. In the southern part of the Dohuk district, where the number of Assyrian casualties from the disturbances are now estimated at forty killed, the Assyrians took much the same line as their brothers in Shaikhan, though there was less apprehension to be observed and less reluctance to work in the villages which bordered on the Amadiyah district, while confidence was expressed in the kaimakam and the local police to afford them the necessary protection. ISlevertheless, I formed the impression that practically the whole of the Assyrian population of the Shaikhan and Dohuk districts, numbering perhaps 12,000 souls, were eager to accept any reasonable offer of a home in another country. 6. In the Amadiyah district, where there was no destruction of life or property during the troubles in August, I found that the Assyrians had complete confidence in their Kurdish kaimakam, and a marked disinclination to leave their prosperous villages, provided that they could feel assured of security and fair treatment in the future. They had nothing to complain of in regard to past treatment by the Iraqi Government, but all, including the followers as well as the opponents of the Mar Shimun, were unanimous in condemning the exodus to Syria as a political move entirely unconnected with land settlement, which was engineered by the Patriarch for his own selfish ends. They vehemently accused those who took part in this exodus of being the cause of all the troubles which had befallen the Assyrian community in general, not so much for the exodus itself as for their senseless and criminal behaviour in returning to Iraq with their arms and making a treacherous attack on the Iraqi armv. They emphasised that if these malcontents, many of whom had gone from their own villages, had remained in Syria all would have been well, and they made an interesting point about the feimel massacre that if the victims had been men who had returned fiom Svcia to fight they would have condoned the slaughter. What had shaken the confidence of the whole Assyrian community was the tragic fact that the victims m nearly every case were the loyal supporters of the Government. This tact, they said, made it very difficult for them to decide what answer to return to the committee after the League’s offer had been explained. On the one hand, t ev were loath to abandon villages which were close to their old homes and gave em eveiything they could reasonably want; on the other hand, thev feared that a less competent and determined kaimakam might not be able to protect them from the depredations of the Kurds in the future. .In the Rowanduz district, which includes the Shemsdinan Assyrians of e Ilarir Plain and Diana, there was, similarly, no loss of life or property last August. It will be recollected that his late Majesty King Feisal and Nuri Pasha expiesse t eii thanks to me on more than one occasion for the restraining influence exerted on the Assyrians by the British vice-consul at Diana, Mr. Lhapman-Andrews, during the crisis. When I interviewed at Harir a representative gathering headed by the uncle of the Mar Shimun, Bishop Mar usui, the exodus to Syria was strongly condemned as being the unnecessary cause of all their troubles, and the bishop requested me to press the IraqiGovernment to allow Assyrians domiciled in Russia and Persia to enter Iraq When I enquired the reason for this request, I was informed by the meeting that the conditions in Persia and Russia were becoming so intolerable that the Assyrians there would much prefer to live in Iraq, where in normal circum stances they could be assured of good treatment. I replied that I could not see Ihy way to invite the Iraqi Government to receive more Assyrians from outside dt a time when many Assyrians in the country were pressing the League to be sent to a new home. The bishop told me privately that, if cant and prejudice were eliminated from the discussion of this question, and the Assvrians were allowed to live their own lives, without interference, under their tribal leaders, there was little doubt that Iraq offered them a convenient and sufficiently comfortable home. This fact was thoroughly appreciated by the less fortunate Assyrians, who were exposed to every form of oppression and misery under the Soviet and Persian Governments. The trouble was that some of the Assyrians in Iraq had been misled and had compromised the security and happiness of the remainder. When he asked for my advice, I told him that I did not wish to discuss the past, and that the prosperity of the Assyrians who elected to remain in Iraq must depend on the goodwill established between them and their neighbours and the Iraqi Government. Each individual would have to decide for himself, when the time came, whether he would stay or go. 8. I do not think it can be predicted with any certainty which way the Assyrians of Amadiyah and Rowanduz areas, numbering perhaps 8,000 souls, will decide. Their instinct is to stay, but their confidence in the fairness of the Iraqi Government, or, rather, the Government’s ability to keep the army under control, has been shattered by the tragedy of Simel. They still seem to have a blind faith in the sympathy and ability of His Majesty’s Government to protect them, and this faith, taken in con junction wuth their fondness for their present homes, may well be the deciding factor when it comes to the point. Present indications point in two directions. Many have sold their cattle at ridiculously low prices in the hope apparently that emigration will be started at once. Others have renewed their leases with their Kurdish landlords. The contiguity of the Iraqi battalion lines to the village of Diana, which contains a number of armed Assyrians, is a potential source of danger, which I took the opportunity of impressing on His Majesty’s vice-consul and the Kaimakam of Rowanduz, with a view to their acting in co-operation to prevent a stampede should a panic again occur. 9. What impressed me most in my conversations with the Assyrians was the pathetic eagerness with which information about the new home was awaited by those who had downed tools and had given up all hope of settling permanently in Iraq; the wistfulness with which those who were obviously attached to their present homes enquired about future prospects in this country, and the unanimous condemnation of the policy of the Patriarch which had inspired the exodus to Syria. The conclusion I formed was that a large number of Assyrians will have to be moved from Iraq as soon as possible if further troubles are to be avoided, and that the remainder would be willing to serve the Iraqi Government loyally if they were assured of a fair deal. This brings me to the subject of guarantees. 10. I have noticed two lines of criticism in the European press, both of which seem to betray a lamentable ignorance of the essential facts of the Assyrian problem. The first is that His Majesty’s Government were gravely to blame in proposing the termination of the mandate for Iraq before the Assyrian question had been finally settled. The answer to this criticism is that successive Governments in Great Britain, from 1927 onwards, had pledged themselves to propose the entry of Iraq into the League of Nations in 1932, while the Assyrian Patriarch had consistently refused, on behalf of himself and his immediate followers, to accept any settlement in Iraq which did not involve the continuance of a mandate. If His Majesty’s Government had acted on the advice oi tiiese critics, they would have broken a solemn pledge and handed over the poiitica destinies of Iraq to a self-seeking adventurer. The result would have been a repetition of the 1920 troubles, which cost the British Treasury more than £100 million. The refusal of the Patriarch to accept the League s decision and co-operate with the Iraqi Government was due to political and not to economic causes. It is important that this fact should be understood, as it vitally a ec s foe whole question of Assyrian settlement.— i/'lNot printed 11 The second criticism is that the guarantees for the protection of minorities which were given by Iraq to the League were inadequate, and that, in “Tease paper guarantees are futile. The answer to this is that the guarantees, whih inchided permission, unprecedented in a Moslem country, for rehgmns, educational and medical missions to practise freely m Iraq, are based on the stiffest available model, and that the only alternative to paper guarantees &gt; resident force; in other words, the location of sufficient foreign ground troops m the country to ensure the protection of minorities bv force. This so ution and the proposal for a League commissioner to reside in Mosul, are equal y fantastic and impracticable. The fact must be faced that in this modern world, which has witnessed, especially in the East, the growth of national aspirations and the consolidation of the authority of central Governments, a minority must conform to the laws of the State, abandon all claims to exclusive privileges and exhibit goodwill towards its rulers if it is to maintain a happy and piosperous existence. It is my conviction that the Assyrian rank and file, if left to themselves, would have settled contentedly on the excellent lands that nave been allotted to them by the Iraqi Government. They have been misled by their leaders into a blind pursuit of an impracticable political ideal, and it is mainly the innocent who have suffered, while the guilty, including the real villain of the piece, the Patriarch himself, who is believed to be battening on the contributions intended for the relief of his victims, are posing as martyrs to credulous well-wishers m Europe and America. Finally, I would emphasise the necessity for making a start with the emigration of at least 2,000—3,000 souls before the Paiana season terminates in September. . 12. I enclose a memorandum giving a brief outline of the recent troubles,() based chiefly on reports received from Assyrians; also a copy of a curiously- worded letter^) which I have received from the Iraq Tiari Association of America. I have, &amp;c. F. H. HUMPHEYS.u&gt;s.s -Sr^uX S»-} A draft telegram to the G. of I. regarding the Assyrian question is submitted. It is noticeable that, while Sir G. Mounsey 1 s letter states that the Colonial Empire is being combed once more, he does not say that the F.O. have made any suggestion^ to the Dominions Office that H.M.G. should solicit help from the Dominions, or even support the appeal which the League Committee has decided (P.Z. 404o; to address to Australia, South Africa and Canada (but not to India). As these are countries with large empty spaces for settlement and H.M.G. cannot afiord to leave any possible solution unexplored, it would seem an obviou step to make some special attempt to bring the urgency o^ the problem from the imperial point o: view to tne notice of these other members of the British Commonwealth who are also members of the League. In dealing with a problem of urgent imperial importance, in regard to which H.M.G. cannot afford to leave any stone unturned, a communication of this character to the Dominions ought not to be ruled out by fear of their well known jealousy of intervention (which does not preclude consultation and/* suggestion) or of the special touchiness which they at one time felt on the subject of their immigration policies. At any rate, the F.O. might put the matter to the D.O., if they have not already done so. Perhaps we might, in sending an interim reply to Sir G. Mounsey (which could enclose copy of our telegram to India), ask whether anything is being done in this direction.11 draft telegram. ij t ^ Y ' p X. ^f-Solo r SECRETARY OF STATE TO o^l ! •-'•x GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, FOREIGN AND POLITICAL DEPARTMENT.

The F.O. letter shows that it is desired to M/ f&lt;&gt;t— avoid parcelling out the Assyrians. Unfortunately, it ^ ^ seems clear that it is only if the problem has to be solved by parcelling them out that there can be any N f question of India being able to help at all. If the Assyrians have to be dispersed she might conceivably be able to absorb a small number (though even this is l/*'' i doubtful). Mr. Patrick has considerable knowledge of the Syrian church in Travancore and elsewhere on the Malabar coast.

I understand from him also that the Travancore Christians are a very poor community, so that/93 ^ that it is unlikely that they would be able to help financially in settling the Assyrians, and the country is of course already populated to the full.

We cannot afford to leave any possible solution unexplored, and I shall try to show that the Government of India like ourselves has a strong interest in getting this problem settled as soon as possible. 3. You will be aware already, from the papers we have sent to you from time to time, of the way in which the problem has arisen, of the efforts made by the League Committee set up last October to find a home for the Assyrians and of the recent failure of a scheme for settlement in Brazil on which great hopes had been se t. But it may be useful to you to have the enclosed memorandum which gives the whole story in outline, together with a number of details about the Assyrians. 4. After the troubles of last summer which made it necessary to consider the removal of the Assyrians from Iraq, we got the Colonial Office to explore the possibility/possibility of settling them in the Colonial Empire, They then came to the conclusion that there was no suitable area available. Now that the scheme for settlement in Brazil has broken down, and the problem has meanwhile lost nothing in urgency or importance, they are combing the Colonial Empire once more. It is really a matter of great difficulty, however, to find a good place, and the Colonial Office, even if any place at all can be found - which is still doubtful do not hold out hope of being able to do more than parcel out the Assyrians between several Colonies whereas the Assyrians appear to wish to cling together. It is true that they are reported to be at present divided into two factions, one of which is not satisfied with the policy of the Mar Shimun, the spiritual head of the community, and these two factions niay in any case have to be settled in separate areas - though not necessarily far apart - but any further splitting up than this would involve many difficulties.5. What I do want to emphasise is the importance, from the point of view of imperial interests, of getting the problem settled. Reference to the difficulties which may otherwise he anticipated is made in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the enclosed memorandum. You know what a lot of talk there has been about the responsibility of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom for the Assyrians. There is of course no legal responsibility, and if there is a moral responsibility, it arises not from any pledges in the past, but from our general connexion with the Assyrians, and in particular from the fact that we are still employing a number of them as soldiers in the Iraq Levies, which form the guards for our aerodromes in Iraq. In view of the services which the Assyrians are rendering and have rendered in the past in the Levies, we cannot simply wash our hands of them. But there is more in it than this. If those Assyrians who do not feel able to settle down in Iraq are not removed from the country we may be involved/involved in far-reaching practical difficulties, Humphrys feels that there is real danger of further trouble unless a large proportion at all events of the Assyrians can be moved in the near future. The Assyrians themselves, who still possess a number of British rifles earned during service in the Levies, may be driven to some act of desperation, and in any case any further attempt to settle them permanently in Iraq is likely to lead only to constant friction between them and the Kurds and Arabs, which may at any moment produce an incident. If further bloodshed took place no-one can say where it would lead to* When the massacre of last summer took place there was reason to fear that it might spread to other Christians and develop eventually into an anti-British and anti- foreign movement. This danger will be present in any future disturbance. In view of the special position which we occupy in Iraq, and particularly in view of the presence of the Royal Air Force, we could in any case/2&lt;4.b \ communications, 'but also because of the possibility of a call for troops from India, if an emergency necessitated the use of ground forces in Iraq. For these reasons I feel sure that you will be as anxious as we are to avert the dangers and this is my excuse for begging you to consider most seriously whether the settlement of the Assyrians in India is a practical possibilitiiOiM, m kiie..Aefevrians Thin Queetion cf'nceniB some 20,000 ChrieUane of ex- ii nationality now rsBiuent In 1 thq• fisact Btatlatlcs are not available, and the number who will wish to leave Iraq camot be definitely estaDlished until a concrete scheme of re-eettlement can be put before them. borne of them whose pre-war homes were in what is now Iraq, nay elect to stay there, out the Coomitte® of the Council of the League which is concerned with this question has hitherto worked on the assumption that between 10,(00 and lb,000 will have to be transferred. 2. The origin of these people is not absolutely clear. They themselves claim to be the descendants of the ancient Assyrian implre. Now, however, they constitute a religious rather than a racial minority, and it wnuli. be perhaps more correct to refer to them as Nestorians. In fact, though many of them are of the Presbyterian faith, they belong generally to that branch of the Aesyro-Chaldean race which constitutes the Nestorlan Chur*. They are hi Ilmen and before the war most of them lived in the highlands of Turkis! Kurdistan. Their spiritual head, who under the ottoman regime appears to have had also a certain measure of tempore Power, is the fear uhimun, called the Patriarch of the cPist. This office has been held by the fear bhimun family for se'mi* boo years. The Patriarch may not marry and the office passes from uncle to nephew. under the Patriarch are the Metropolitanshays at thslr head a «r dhiel, to eeE*e mesa herauitary and to others elective. «hajf are leaders and judges to trih*:i Affairs afefifiirt Jiiti'tnf' S. At t‘H outbreak »£ the ureat war, the Assyrians of Turkey, owing, to the relations between the Mestertoa am* Orthodox Churehes, were inevitably suspect aud »lth Russia.

'The Assyrians desired to settle to Hakklari unoer a aritiah Protectorate.

With reference to the S. of S. f s note on P.Z.3609, please see Mr.E.J.Turner*s note at flag A and the departmental note below. The aim of the solutions of the Assyrian problem hitherto explored appears to be to settle them, or a large number of then^as a community en bloc outside Iraq. India does not offer a field for such a solution, and if we made an enquiry of the G. of I. they would almost certainly reply to the effect that India already has an excessive population, and is in fact a ”country of emigration”; that any new lands that can be brought under cultivation are required for the existing surplus population, and that it is consequently impracticable to consider any question of finding a home in India for the Assyrian community. In the case of the Jewish and other Russian European refugees who are flocking into Afghanistan,the G* of I. have been unable to agree to their receptionin India, except in individual eases where such refugees have definite prospects of being able to establish themselves there without becoming a charge on public funds. A certain number of Russian refugees from Sinkiang have been allowed to enter India, but only on urgent humanitarian ground^ and in the hope that it may be possible to arrange through the League of Nations ibr their ultimate disposal elsewhere, as there is no means of absorbing them in India itself.Mr. Walton. Private Secretary. Please see the Secretary of State's note on P.Z. 3609 and Mr. E.J. Turner's note at flag A. The settlement of half a dozen Assyrian families in India, even if this could be arranged, would be no solution of the Assyrian problem which is one of trying to find a home for 2,000 or 3,000 families, say 12,000 souls, and the difficulties experienced by the Government of India in dealing with the comparatively small influx into India of about 100 White Russian refugees from Afghanistan and Sinlciang make it seem improbable that the Government of India could ever contemplate accepting the Assyrians. In the case of the Y/hite Russians, the Government of India stated that there was practically no chance of the refugees being absorbed into the economic life of India, that many of them were without any technical skill or indeed desire to earn a living, and that even in cases where these essentials were present, language difficulties were a great handicap. Most of the Assyrians are no doubt competent agriculturists, but/but it would probably be difficult to find a sufficient area of suitable land in India. The latest telegrams on the file confirm that the Brazilian scheme has broken down.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Iraq). —— i » ' / —v »- , AW b i v,,.

THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and nas the honour to transmit copies of a note of the twenty-third meeting of Assyrian Committee of Council, on the 7th May, 1934, of which a copy has been sent to His Majesty’s Ambassador, Bagdad. United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, May 12, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Assyrian Question. Record of the Twenty-third Meeting of the Council Committee held on May 7, 1934, at 10-30 a.m. THE committee met at first in private to consider Brigadier Browne’s report. The President said that there was also the question of a report to the ouncii.^ The committee would have to decide whether to make a report or not. ^E lyar b for his part, thought that the committee ought, in any case, to draw ne attention of the Council to the reports which had been received since the ast Council meeting from the Iraqi representative on the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq, and he was inclined to think also that it might be well to make a progress report on the work of settlement, in view of the criticisms which were appearing on the slowness of the committee’s work. Ihe question of inviting the members of the Commission of Enquiry and the Iraqi representative to attend was then discussed. The general feeling of the committee was that it might be embarrassing to have the Iraqi representative present at the outset, as he was not aware of the present position vis-a-vis of the Brazilian Government and was not even aware of the three conditions which the Brazilian Government had laid down. It was agreed, therefore, to decide later on the time at which the Iraqi representative should be summoned, and, meanwhile, to ask Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson and the president of the Nansen Office to attend later in the morning. In reply to an enquiry from the Danish representative, the President said that he had received no news from the Spanish Ambassador since the last session °t the committee. The United Kingdom Representative said that nothing further had been received from His Majesty’s Ambassador. The despatch to the Spanish mbassador had only been sent off on the 14th April and would not have been ,? 1 1( ? n g in the possession of the Spanish Ambassador. It was perhaps unlikely at he would have been able to make much progress as yet, particularly in view 01 the impending presidential election. The United Kingdom representative ^food that this election had now been fixed for the 14th May, and it seemed miheult to make any progress until it was over, He thought, however, that at its present session the committee might usefully examine Brigadier Browne’s from the point of view of the modifications which it might necessitate m e ^ es P a tch to the Spanish Ambassador. [106 p—4] . b NC 24 14JUN.TJib President agreed and thought that the committee might endeavour to send off as soon as possible a supplementary despatch in the light of its interview with Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson. The United Kingdom Representative suggested that the committee should forthwith go through Brigadier Browne s report and the subsidiary report fn. Major Johnson in order to gain a preliminary idea of the points which might have to be mentioned to the Spanish Ambassador. These points could form the subject of questions to Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson when they appeared, and the committee could subsequently, on the basis of the discussion, consider a draft to the Spanish Ambassador. The President suggested that, in addition to taking up these points with the mission, the latter might be asked whether they had anything to add to their written report, more particularly regarding the agitation in Brazil. The Mexican Representative having referred to the file of press cuttings which the mission had brought back, M. Arocha said that he did not think anything would be gained by examining the file in detail. There was a great deal of repetition in the articles, which were concerned with three main points (a) A diatribe against imperialism, and more particularly against British imperialism; (b) A criticism of the Assyrians as being Levantine undesirables; and (c) Protests against Asiatic immigration in general. The Danish Representative suggested that it might be useful to ask Brigadier Browne for his opinion on the position of the Mar Shimun. It was quite evident that Brigadier Browne and Major Thomson held contradictory views on that subject. Brigadier Browne indicated in his report that the split between the two branches of the Assyrians was not likely to last long in Brazil. Major Thomson, on the other hand, had tended to take the view that the split was fundamental. Furthermore, Brigadier Browne had put forward a suggestion that the Mar Shimun ought to go to Brazil with the first party of Assyrians. M. Borberg was inclined to wonder whether this was, in fact, a wise suggestion. The United Kingdom Representative doubted whether Brigadier Browne was in a position to give an authoritative opinion regarding the present position of the Mar Shimun. He had been away from Iraq for some time and could not be expected to be au courant with the latest developments. He could only be expected to offer observations on the Mar Shimun’s position in the future in Brazil. The exact position of the Mar Shimun in Iraq was a matter of opinion and it would probably be impossible to gauge the extent of the split between the two factions of Assyrians until a scheme for immigration could be put before them. It was alleged in some quarters that it was natural for the Assyrians to split up into factions and that even in the old days in Turkey they had not been united and had only united in the face of a common danger. I he Mar Shimun, on the other hand, always claimed that the Assyrians were a single united people under his leadership. The United Kingdom representative thought that the committee could only, in the first place, put the Brazilian scheme before the Assyrians as a scheme under which it was proposed to settle nil the Assyrians who wished to leave Iraq together. It might be that, if this weie done, the Assyrians might forget their differences and agree to go together, n tne other hand, a certain section might say that they wished to leave Iraq, f U - p i* 10 * 1 £0 with the Mar Shimun. In that case the committee would have to fall back on the idea of a dual settlement. • T ^ 16 P' resi de'nt said that, although Brigadier Browne had not been recent m - A a q, e fPP ear , t '° ^ ave a profound knowledge of the Assvrians, and might, nevertheless, be useful to ask him about the Mar Shimun’s position. ^ United Kingdom Representative said that he merely wished to poi vr Q qvc 1 &gt; WaS whether anyone was able to estimate exactly t] • nmn s P° sltl on at present, and that Brigadier Browne’s opinion, thdu£ ih c tmg ^ nd P osslbl y Mpful, could not be taken as authoritative, owing nis absence for some time from Iraq ^ a rejoest froin the President for suggestions as to points whh ught to be raised with Brigadier Browne, the United Kingdom Representatr3 P these pi ^ %toii Brazil, e of press J t he Um.\ There wjii? ireemaiup: rlv agaiil lesirahles;r|. said that he had been through the reports of Brigadier Browne and Mai or Johnson for the purpose of seeing what modifications they might entail in the despatch of the 10th April to the Spanish Ambassador. It would be remembered that that despatch had taken the line that it would be necessary to negotiate ^ith the Brazilian Government on three points. The first concerned the three Editions laid down by the Brazilian Government, the second the treatment which the Assyrians would enjoy in Brazil, and the third the physical details of settlement. There seemed to be little in the reports of the mission which affected that part of the despatch which concerned the Brazilian conditions, except that a suggestion was made that arrangements might be made for non-agricultural Assyrians to serve an approved period of apprenticeship with qualified agricultural families or in an experimental agricultural station which would be established in the settlement. The committee might wish to authorise the Spanish Ambassador to put a suggestion of this sort before the Brazilian Government in connexion with the first of the Brazilian conditions. The two reports did not appear to affect the despatch so far as it concerned the future treatment of the Assyrians. As regards the physical details of settlement, it had been stated in the despatch that any necessary indications would be offered after consultation with Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson. The United Kingdom representative thought that there was not a great deal in the two reports on this aspect of the matter which need be taken up with the Brazilian Government at this stage, but the committee might wish to consider the following points:— (1) A suggestion had been made by Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson that a Brazilian Commission should be sent to Iraq to make a selection of the Assyrians. (2) Some special arrangement would no doubt be necessary for allowing those Assyrians who were old and infirm to proceed to Brazil. It was obviously undesirable that such persons should be left in Iraq if their relatives went to Brazil and, in fact, their relatives would be unlikely to leave Iraq without them. The Brazilian Government, however, might be reluctant to accept people in this category, and it might be necessary to satisfy them that the people in question would be adequately maintained in Brazil by their relatives. (3) Major Johnson had suggested that the Brazilian Government should be urged to make special arrangements for the customs examination of the baggage of the Assyrians on board ship between Rio and Santos, so as to facilitate disembarkation at Santos. (4) It might also be necessary to warn the Brazilian Government that two separate settlements might be required. (5) As regards the eventual operation of the settlement scheme, Major Johnson had made three alternative proposals :— (a) That the Nansen Office should make a contract with Parana Plantations (Limited), under which, in return for a lump sum payment which would cover the cost of land and all administrative costs, the company would carry out the whole work of settlement. (b) That the Nansen Office should merely purchase the necessary land from the company and that the company should then carry out the settlement work as the agents of the Nansen Office, at cost price. (c) That the Nansen Office should purchase the land from Parana Plantations (Limited) and should itself assume lull responsibility for carrying out the settlement plan. j’ s p# ifisk c The first of these alternatives might involve the presence of a Nansen representative in Brazil in a consultative capacity only, the second would mean that the work of settlement would be executed by the company but direc e on the spot by a commissioner of the Nansen Office, the third would p ace e w p e work of settlement in the hands of a Nansen Office commissioner and a special Nansen Office staff. It might be doubted whether it was necessary to mention these alternatives to the Brazilian Government at the present stage, but t e reason why the United Kingdom representative thought it necessary to raise the point was that the alternative ultimately adopted might, to some exten , depend upon the solution of the question of the future national status of the Assyrians. It was conceivable that, if the Assyrians were to become Brazilian [106 p—4] B ^nationals at once, the Brazilian Government might object to then admimstration being placed in the hands of an outside organisation like the Nansen Office. On the other hand if the Nansen Office purchased the land outright, they would presumably have 1 the right to administer it if they wished to do so At all events it might be advisable to draw the attention of the Spanish Ambassador to the'three alternatives and to ask him to find out whether any of them worn be likelv to lead to special difficulties with the Brazilian Government. The Mexican Representative suggested that the mission should be asked for further information regarding the interview which M. Redard had evidently had with the Society of the Friends of Albeito Torres. The Danish Representative agreed, but thought it important to have the views of the mission on the whole question of the agitation against Assyrian immigration, on the press campaign, and on the forthcoming election in so far as it was likely to concern the Assyrian question. The committee needed information on these points for its own guidance in the matter of publicity. As no further suggestions were forthcoming, the President proposed that the committee should, before the arrival of Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson, take the opportunity of examining the Mar Shimun’s letter of the 3rd May. He observed that that letter gave an account of the situation in Iraq which did not correspond with the reports received from the Iraqi Government. It demanded the despatch to Iraq of a commission of enquiry to ascertain the true facts and it asked that destinations other than Brazil should be considered before the Brazilian scheme was proceeded with. M. Olivan thought that, for the time being, the committee must continue to depend on the Iraqi Government’s reports regarding the internal situation. At the same time, the committee ought to do its best to find out the truth, and would no doubt wish to consider whether it would be advisable to suggest to the Council (though it was an extremely delicate matter) that a special representative should be despatched to Iraq to make enquiries. Unfortunately, the press was beginning to reproduce the Mar Shimun’s allegations. There had been articles that morning in the Journal de Geneve and in the Journal des Nations which had clearly been inspired by the Mar Shimun’s allegations. The settlement question was sufficiently difficult without this press campaign. Even if the local agitation in Brazil disappeared, the discussion of technical details was bound to lead to delay. Meanwhile, the committee must think of the Assyrians. It had been definitely given this task by the Council and M. Olivan was anxious that neither the Council nor the committee should, by failing to find out the true position of affairs, become directly responsible for a situation for whose origin they were not responsible. M. Olivan noted that the Mar Shimun suggested that settlement in Syria, Canada or Turkey might be preferable to settlement in Brazil. As regards Syria, however, he recollected that the committee had already considered this possibility, and his impression was that the French representative had indicated that settle ment in Syria was virtually impossible. At the same time, the committee might wish to confirm this by a direct enquiry of the Mandatory Government. As regards Canada, M. Olivan believed that the Canadian Government had already refused to consider Assyrian settlement. M Arocha corrected the President on this point. He said that the United Kingdom representative had, he thought, indicated that settlement in Canada was unlikely to be realisable. of t] The. United Kingdom Representative reminded the committee that 1 several times said that it was impossible for him to speak on behalf of any omimon Governments. In the early days of the committee’s life he h: m icated, however, that he believed that existing Canadian immigration K would prevent Assyrian immigration, and that, if the Canadian Government we willing to take the Assyrians, an amendment of their legislation would necessary. He liad also informed the committee that there had been at one tir an Assyrian settlement at Port Arthur; that he believed that the settlement : ongei existed, and that the experience had shown that the Assyrians we un i ve y o e successful settlers in Canada. He had suggested, however, that t eague s ion appioach the Canadian Government direct in order to ascertaGovern® .e comited i consider ilij was ai ed atcWtol'l larlvteid their attitude, and a letter hud been sent by the League Secretariat to the Govern ment of Canada on the 30th November. So far no reply had been received and it seemed possible that the Canadian Government, being aware from the committee s laSt m '? 0UnCl1 hat As ?y rian “heme was under active considera 'ition, had thought it unnecessary to reply. siueid M. Arocha then read Nuri Pasha’s letter to the Secretary-General of iHa 26th October last. In this letter Nuri Pasha had expressed his regret that the Mar Shimun’s letters of the 24th and 25th October should have been Iccepted and communicated to the League Committee. The letter had pointed out that the Mar Shimun was, m the eyes of the Iraqi Government, guilty of c ‘the criminal instigation of the recent revolt,” and that the admission of undue intervention by him could only prejudice the prospects of a satisfactory result. The President observed that this was, perhaps, the opinion of the Iraqi Munster for Foreign Affairs, but he himself could not share it. The committee could not ignore the Mar Shimun’s letter of the 3rd May, or any letter from any other source containing similar allegations. The Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs evidently assumed that the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq was not within the competence of the committee and on that point he was wrong. The League had specifically asked the committee to concern itself with this aspect of the matter. The Danish Representative recalled that the question of the treatment of the Mar Shimun had been discussed by the committee once before. It had then been agreed that the committee must receive the information forwarded by the Mar Shimun and make the best use possible of it. The Mar Shimnn’s letter made the Danish representative wonder whether the committee was proceeding on the right lines with the Mar Shimun. As an agitator the Mar Shimun could do very great harm, but he could also be very useful, and in the reports of Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson he was evidently cast for an important role in Brazil. The Danish representative was not convinced that any change in the relations of the committee and the Alar Shimun was actually necessary, but he thought that the committee had to consider the point very carefully. The President said he was quite prepared to ameliorate relations with the Mar Shimun. He was not clear, however, what could, in fact, be done. He had always seen the Mar Shimun when the latter had requested an interview. The secretariat had also seen him. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had, he understood, also been in contact with him during a recent visit by the Patriarch to England, and certainly unofficial circles in England had been in close touch with him. To give the Mar Shimun more official recognition might lead to serious difficulties with the Iraqi Government. The president thought that, while nothing should be done to antagonise the Mar Shimun, it was difficult not to leave things as they were. The United Kingdom Representative said that he entirely agreed that it was necessary for the committee to carry the Mar Shimun with it. Whatever might be the exact truth about his position, it was clear that he could exercise very con siderable influence for good or ill. At the same time it was no easy mattei to deal with him, as he appeared unfortunately bent on making trouble. Furthermore, to give him an official status would certainly antagonise the Iraqi Government, whose co-operation was essential if a settlement scheme was to be put into success ui operation. The United Kingdom representative did not think, theretoie ar there could be any change in the relations between the Mar Shimun and e committee as a whole, though members of the committee might mdividua y 0 what they could to secure his willing co-operation. As regards his repoi on ne situation in Iraq, it was for consideration whether this ought, not to be sent to tne Iraqi Government for observations. The protest of the Iraqi Government ot e 26th October last, which M. Arocha had read, referred to letters m which the Mar Shimun had persisted in going over the same ground as ha a rea^ y ee covered by the Council at its session in the first half of October. In so ai as was the case, the Iraqi Government certainly had some justifica ion 01 attitude. The present letter, however, concerned new facts an ^ ma ® new a •/? Dons and the United Kingdom representative doubted whe er could take the responsibility of doing otherwise than asking the Iraqi Government for a report on these allegations. [106 p—4] B 3The President said that what offended him was not so much the ,, “ t i ip nrp&lt;iS campaign which it had evidently inspired, and whil'” Si?.!! » .h. M., Shimun h,n,,,l( Th. « tectics had been employed on the occasion of previous meetings of the committee.^ 4 i filv t J heen received from the Mar Shimun and immediately a unammout press campaign in the Geneva papers had followed. It was really intolerable that the Mar Shimun should be allowed to act m this way and to hamper the work of the committee He wondered whether any influence could be brought to bear upon him and he asked whether His Majesty’s Government m the United Kingdom were in a position to exert such influence, or if not, whether those ecclesiastical circles with which the Mar Shimun was in relation m England could not do some thing to help. The United Kingdom Representative agreed that the Mar Shimun’s activities were regrettable, but unfortunately he was something of an agitator. It was. of course? quite useless for His Majesty’s Government m tne United Kingdom to attempt to exert any influence over him. 1 hey had no means of doing so and the Mar Shimun. unfortunately, owing to the past history of the Assyrian question, unjustifiably held His Majesty s Government responsible for the pn^ht of his people and regarded with suspicion any advance which British omcials might make to him. The United Kingdom representative had himself endeavoured in the early days of the committee s woik to enlist the willing co-operation of the Mar Shimun and had endeavoured to prove to him that His Majesty’s Government were anxious to do their best to facilitate a solution of the troubles of the Assyrian people. The Mar Shimun, however, had proved incapable of concentrating on the future and had always insisted on raking up the controversial past. Any intervention by His Majesty s Government, therefore, or by any British official would probably have quite the opposite effect to what was intended. As regards the ecclesiastical circles in Great Britain, the United Kingdom representative believed that everything possible had been done by them to exert a calming influence on the Mar Shimun, but unfortunately he was liable to break out at intervals, as in the present case. The discussion was suspended at this point owing to the arrival of Brigadier Browne, Major Johnson and M. Werner. The President welcomed the mission and thanked them for their report. He wished also, on behalf of the committee, to thank M. Redard. The committee had examined Brigadier Browne’s report and the supplementary report by Major Johnson. Apart from any questions which members of the committee might wish to put, he asked whether the mission had any supplementary information which they wished to give—for instance, any observations on the political atmosphere in Brazil not recorded in the report, which might be of interest now that the political situation in Brazil was in a state of flux. The main question was whether the Brazilian Government would keep a promise which they had made, or whether political changes might produce a change of attitude. What was the view of the mission on this point ? Brigadier Broivne replied to the thanks which the president had expressed and hoped that the thanks to M. Redard would be conveyed by the committee. M. Redard had been of the greatest possible assistance. Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson had read his earlier report on the Parana estates, and, while they had gone there with open minds, they had not been prepared to find the place as good as M. Redard had represented it to be. They had, however, found it even better. As regards the political situation, the mission, when they went to B raz ^ ’ had had no idea that they would be called upon to do more than to examine the area proposed, to answer the various points raised in the questionnaire examine by the committee before their departure from Geneva, and to decide, in the hg of Brigadier Browne’s personal knowledge of the Assyrians, whether they were fit people to put into Parana. The press campaign in Brazil had come as an entire surprise to the mission. The spearhead of the agitation was the “ Society of the Friends of Alberto Torres.” This society was, in the first place, scientific, but it had become the chief antagonist of Assyrian immigration. The press a diawn conclusions from the criticisms of self-styled experts. These experts a^ been uniformly ill-informed. The press had produced a number of illustrations i Assyrian life, but with one exception, i.e., a picture 0 Mar Shimun, these illustrations had been concerned with various races of peop &gt;but certainly not with Assyrians As regards the value to be attached to the agitation, Brigadier Browne felt it difficult to form an opinion 4t first he had thought it to be simply intended as an embarrassment to the Government 4t the close, however he was not absolutely sure that there was not behind it some kind of anti-Asiatic agitation. It was difficult to judge whether the agitation r had upset the scheme for Assyrian settlement, but Brigadier Browne waf not at dl inclined to think that this was the case. It was very possible that the agitation would die down once the election was over, but, of course, one could not sav at this stage. The mission had not answered the press campaign. In the first place, it had no facilities for doing so; in the second place, as it was about to proceed to xaiana, it could not have continued to meet the campaign. In any case, it seemed undesirable to become embroiled with the press, and the mission had thought it preferable merely to draw up an aide-memoire about the Assyrians and to hand it to various influential persons. The Mexican Representative observed that M. Redard had had an interview with the secretary of the Society of Friends of Alberto Torres. Was Brigadier Browne in a position to say more about that interview ? Brigadier Browne said that it was true that M. Redard had been to see the secretary of the society, but the latter had been in an extremely excited frame of mind and had, in fact, done all the talking. The interview was not satisfactory and led nowhere, although he believed that M. Redard and the secretary had parted on the best of terms. Brigadier Browne then read to the committee a letter, dated the 19th April, which had been sent by the local representative of Parana Plantations (Limited) to his headquarters in London and forwarded by the chairman of Parana Plantations (Limited) to Major Johnson. This report was to the effect that Mr. Thomas had been informed, unofficially, but by two reliable official sources, that the Federal Government had decided ito proceed with the Brazilian scheme and that the Commission of Enquiry had been set up merely to allay the existing agitation and to tide over the period until the election was finished. Brigadier Browne then asked leave to make two small corrections in his report. On p. 13, regarding the visit of the mission to Guatambu, the following sentence occurred: “Here are 375 families.” This was a typing error and should read : “ Here there is room for 375 families.' On p. 14 it was stated that the title-deeds of Parana Plantations (Limited) had been found in order. Brigadier Browne asked leave to add at the end of that sentence, “ as far as the mission could judge.” He explained that he and Major Johnson were naturally not experts in the matter of title-deeds, but they had gone into the matter very carefully and had every reason to suppose that they were in order. Parana Plantations (Limited) had themselves taken the greatest care in this matter, and it was a point on which to beware in Brazil, as, in certain cases, title-deeds were invalid, as, owing to bad maps and faulty surveying, they had sometimes been duplicated. The President then asked whether any member of the committee would like to put specific points to the mission. The United Kingdom Representative raised the question of the possibility of passing non-agricultural Assyrians through agricultural centres. a .®. 1 practicable in this way to overcome the difficulty created by the firs razi i condition ? Major Johnson replied that it was probably too costly to put a e ssyi irough agricultural stations. He had, therefore, m his repor ternative suggestion about attaching such Assyrians to agricu ura certain period. The fact that the Assyrians could not all be ^ribed a ?riculturalists had been raised in the aide-memoire which Brigadier Brmv e M handed to various persons in Brazil. It had there been s own &gt; » &gt;me of the Assyrians followed callings which were not stric y \ ere all in a way connected with agricultural life and shou J 3 • i / 0 -, a nbarrassment to the national labour market. This section o Johnson ^ raised no opposition from the Brazilian authorities and Ma] ^ped that it would be possible for non-agncultural Assyri , auricul ae of the two ways which he had mentioned, i.e., either by ^ families or by training in an agricultural station.Thp Prurient asked whether the mission had considered the third Brazilian condftfon concernfng the repatriation or resettlement elsewhere of those Assyrians who did not settle down m Brazil. , , ,, , , , Brigadier Browne said the mission had certainly considered it, but had f °und^ no answer. The President after individual consultation with members of the committee then informed the mission that, at its last session the committee had considered it useful “address a despatch to the Spanish Ambassador, ip order to invite him o clear up certain points by means of informal discussions with the Brazilian Government This despatch was of a very confidential nature. The committee now wThed'to complete it in the light of the additional information which the members of the mission might be in a position to furnish. He accordingly pro- pos“d to communicate a copy of the despatch to them and to ask them to furnish comments on it, if possible on the following day. 1 The Danish Representative said that in his report Brigadier Browne had made mention of tribal jealousy among the Assyrians. Apart from the contro versial question of the position of the Mar Shimun, was it likely that this tribal jealousy would give trouble in Brazil ? Briqadier Browne said that the jealousy existed among the Lower and Upper Tiari Originally it arose, apparently, out of a dispute regarding precedence after the election of the present Mar Shimun. Prior to that time the Lower Tiari had been considered as the senior tribe. Apart from this it had been found in the levies that the Upper Tiari provided better officers and there were conse- quentlv more officers in the levies from that tribe than from the Lower iian. The Upper Tiari had, until recently, been considered as rather wild men ot the mountains,” and the ascendancy which they had now gained was somewhat resented by the Lower Tiari. The Mar Shimun owed his election principally to the influence of the Malik Ismail of the Tipper Tiari. Whether this tribal jealousy would last, Brigadier Browne could not say. At the end of his time in Iraq it had been somewhat accentuated, as the Malik Khoshaba had taken employment under the Iraqi Government, which other chiefs had refused to do. Before adjourning, the President asked the president of the Nansen Office whether he had any observations to make. M. Werner, after expressing his appreciation of the work done by the Mission of Enquiry, said that he would like to make some observations on a rather different aspect of the matter. There had been a meeting of the governing body of the Nansen Office on the 22nd April and he had been asked to draw the attention of the committee to what had then passed. The governing body had not been at all enthusiastic about the scheme for the transfer of the Assyrians to Brazil, as this scheme appeared to some of them to be fantastic, and it was certainly tragic that the Assyrians should be separated from that part of the world to which they belonged. The governing body had wished M. Werner to express the view that it was essential that the Assyrians should be absolutely free to decide whether to leave Iraq or not. M. Werner recalled that he had already taken up this point at a previous meeting of the committee and had then received satisfactory assurances from M. Olivan. He had informed his governing body accordingly and his statement had been received with satisfaction. The governing body realised that it belonged to the Council Committee to take decisions as regards the destination of the Assyrians and the method of their settlement and of their eventual repatriation in case the experiment was not a success, but the governing body thought it most desirable that the sum necessary for financing the settlement should, if possible, be available before a Nansen representative went out to to join the local committee which had been set up there to ascertain the wishes of the Assyrians as regards the Brazilian scheme. The question of finance was a capital one and, if the iNansen Office were to accept responsibility for the operation of a scheme, they would like to obtain precise information on this point. They v/ould, in particular, be glad to know whether the Assyrians themselves would be asked to contribute. The governing body had merely wished him to put these observations before the committee for consideration. The governing body qmte ready to co-operate with the committee in settling the Assyrians, but wouh like that co-operation to be dominated by the principles to which he had refeire ra 9 namely, the voluntary nature of the emigration and the ensuring of adeouate financial support to guard against unduly raising the hopes of the Assyrians M. Werner wished to refer to one other point. Under present arrangements the Nansen Office would cease to exist m 1938. He observed, however from Maior .Johnson’s report that the repayment of the sums advanced for settlement would - take at least eight years. He would like the committee to consider, therefore, what organisation was to deal with this matter when the Nansen Office had disappeared He had himself several times been asked for assurances that the office would, in fact, be wound up by 1938, and he had given such assurances, as he was bound to do under the decisions reached by the League, but the committee must obviously ensure continuity. ' The President assured M. Werner that emigration would be voluntary. The committee had always been anxious to ensure this. As regards the place of settlement, that naturally had to depend on available possibilities. If the committee had had a great choice, it was conceivable that it would have chosen a place other than Brazil, but the choice was restricted. As regards finance, once the Brazilian Government had agreed to take the Assyrians, and the technical aspect of the matter had been studied and settled with that Government, he thought M. Werner could rest assured that the committee would take matters in the order which he had suggested, namely, that it would feel bound to assure itself that the necessary finance would be forthcoming before it authorised the local committee to ascertain the wishes of the Assyrians. The question of the prolongation of the life of the Nansen Office was, he feared, outside the scope of the present committee, and was a matter which would have to be referred in due course to the Council. The President said that he had made these observations without prior consultation with the members of the committee. They expressed his own personal views and he would be glad to know whether they were adopted as the views of the committee. The United Kingdom Representative said he felt bound to make one reservation to avoid possible misunderstanding, on the question of finance. He entirely appreciated M. Werner’s desire that finance should be assured before any scheme was put before the Assyrians. If this could be done, it would be all to the good, but it might not be practicable to take matters in this order. At all events, he thought it premature for the committee to enter into any commitment on the point. M. Werner would realise that, until the Assyrians had been consulted, it would not be known how many of them wished to go to Brazil and consequent!}^ how much money would have to be found. Until this stage was reached, Governments might have some difficulty in promising a contribution. On the other hand, the risk of reversing the order might not be very great. If, for instance, the area in Brazil had been shown to be satisfactory, if the Brazilian Government had consented to receive the Assyrians and the details had been satisfactorily settled with them, and if the Assyrians had declared that they were willing to go, the United Kingdom representative felt that the members of the League could scarcely afford at that stage to let the scheme fail and that means would be found of overcoming any difficulties about providing the necessary finance. The President regretted that, so far as he personally was concerned, he could not agree with the United Kingdom representative. He felt that it was absolutely necessary, before any scheme was put before the Assyrians, to ma e sure that the necessarv finance would be forthcoming. That was, however, is personal opinion and, in expressing it, he had hoped that he had been expressing the opinion of the committee. But, no doubt, the committee would consider the matter further at a more advanced stage. The United Kingdom Representative said that he thought it was perhaps mature to go further into the point at this stage. It might be that matters dd work out as M. Werner and the President desired. On the other hand t course might prove impracticable and what he had desned o guai agams 5 a premature commitment. He had felt bound to make is leserva ion o n’d against any misapprehension in M. Werner s mind. He ie P ea e 5 ’ t he fully appreciated and sympathised with M. Wemei s esne o v10 fy&gt; sli ■ uestion of finance settled, if possible, before any scheme was put before the ssyrians. M Werner expressed his appreciation of the replies given by M. Olivan and bv the United Kingdom representative, and intimated that he was content- J ' i i* J Vx-r-r -4- 1-v /a tyi 1 'fh dP* Qi'. 1 Qt.PT* to leave the matter to be discussed by the committee at a later stage. The Mexican Representative asked Brigadier Browne whether the Assyrians were likely to become part and parcel of their new country or to try to remain as a minority. Briqadier Browne said that it would have to be explained to the Assyrians that they would have to assimilate with the inhabitants of the new country and serve in the army, &amp;c. He thought that this would raise no difficulty with the Assyrians, but it would certainly have to be made quite plain to them. It would be wrong to send them to Brazil with any false idea that they would remain a nation’apart. The Brazilian Government would certainly never tolerate this. Brigadier Browne felt bound to comment on one remark which had been made by M. Werner. M. Werner had referred to the tragedy of separating the Assyrians from the part of the world to which they belonged. It must be remembered, however, that it was not a case of the transfer of the Assyrians from their own lands. They were not, in fact, in their own lands now, though they were almost in sight of them. They were already refugees. Km; &amp; and lias tl of tie Assyria risk® sent to M. Werner said that he realised that they were not, for the most part, in the country of their origin, but they had belonged from time immemorial to Asia Minor, and he adhered to the view that it was regrettable that they should have to be removed from there. It was agreed that a further meeting should be held at 5 p.m. to continue the study of the Mar Shimun’s letter and that the question of a further despatch to the Spanish Ambassador at Rio should be considered on the following morning. A decision would then be taken as to meeting the Iraqi representative and arrangements would be made for seeing the film of the Parana area which the Mission of Enquiry had prepared. J. C.

THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit copies of a note of the twenty-fourth Meeting of the Assyrian Committee of Council, on the 7th May, 1934 of which a copy has been sent to His Majesty’s Ambassador, Bagdad. United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, May 12, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Assyrian Question. Record of the Twenty-fourth Meeting of the Council Committee, held on May 7, 1934, at 5 p.m. THE president proposed that the committee should continue at this meeting its consideration of the issues raised by the Mar Shimun’s letter of the 3rd May. It was also necessary to consider the question of a report to the Council. If it were decided to present a report, M. Olivan wished to make the suggestion that a rayyorteur should be appointed. He himself would have to act as the Council’s rayyorteur and had many other questions to attend to, and he thought there would be some advantage in entrusting the preparation of a report to another member of the committee. If Brigadier Browne’s report were to be presented to the Council, some explanation regarding it would be necessary. It was a long document, and it might be advisable to bring out the salient points in the covering report of the committee. This might result in difficulties. On the other hand, it would perhaps be odd to pass over the report on the Brazilian scheme in silence, in view of the report which the committee had made to the Council at its last session. The alternatives seemed to be (1) to present a brief progress report outlining what the committee had done since the last session of the Council, or (2) to prepare a much more detailed report with Brigadier Browne’s report attached. The nature of the report would, to some extent, depend on the decision which the committee might arrive at with regard to the Mar Shimun s letter. The League was committed to a certain responsibility in regard to the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq. M. Olivan did not necessarily believe all the statements made by the Mar Shimun. On the other hand, the committee had at present to rely solely on reports from the Iraqi Government, and these reports could not be considered impartial. The Mar Shimun’s letter contained a suggestion that an independent investigation should be made, and the committee might wish to inform the Council that its existing means of ascertaining wdiat was the situation m Iraq were inadequate, and might wish to suggest that the Council shou consider the despatch to Iraq either of a commission or of a special representative to make enquiries. It was for the committee to decide whether it was satisiied to continue to receive information from the Iraqi Government or whethei it shou propose to the Council other means. The Mexican Representative said that, while the committee ought to do yerything possible to watch over the situation of the Assyrians unti eii emigia ion took place, he was in favour of treating the Mar Shimun s letter merely as a ource of information in the same way as one would take a P ress ' , e ommittee ought to take steps to prevent the recurrence of anyt mg me ® ®ven s I last August, but he thought that it should act through the Iraqi Government, nth whom sole responsibility lay. [106 p—i] B T*TThe President said that this was, in effect, what the committee had hitherto done It was evident that the Iraqi Government were responsible and, m the Council’s resolution of October last, that Government had been asked to keep the committee informed about the situation of the Assyrians. e committee had hitherto been content to rely on such reports, but the President wondered whether it would not be wise to try to obtain other sources of information. The Mexican Representative suggested that the committee should send the o-ist of the Mar Shimun’s letter to the Iraqi representative, as though it were information received from press sources which the committee desired to verify. The President felt that the committee could hardly deal in this way with a Government. He thought that, if the possibility of an independent enquiry on the spot was ruled out, there were no adequate means of progress. The Danish Representative pointed out that in Iraq we were dealing with a young sovereign State. The proposal for a special investigation must be considered from that point of view, and one must remember that a special commission of investigation might give rise to agitation and trouble between the Assyrians and the Iraqis. The President said that he fully realised the delicacy of the matter. He remembered how difficult it had been 1 to get the Iraqi Government to agree even to the establishment of the local committee set up in the Council Committee’s resolution of the 31st October last. He felt, in fact, that a suggestion for the despatch of a special commission would almost certainly meet with a blank refusal from the Iraqi Government. At the same time, he thought there might be some advantage in inserting in the report to the Council a paragraph showing that the present means of information were inadequate. He had always felt that the committee was in a false position. The Council had entrusted it with the task of watching over the plight of the Assyrians, but had not given it the means of doing so. He was anxious that the committee should not be saddled with an unfair responsibility, and it might be well to draw the Council’s attention to the lack of means of checking reports on the situation in Iraq. The United Kingdom Representative said that this was probably the most difficult question which the committee had so far attempted to discuss. For his part, he did not wish, without the fullest consideration of the advantages and disadvantages, to pronounce on the proposal to ascertain the facts by means of an independent investigation. He would, therefore, only, for the moment, put before his colleagues some of the practical difficulties and dangers which would have to be taken into account. The Iraqi Government had hitherto refused to consider anything in the nature of a Commission of Enquiry, and it was not, he thought, entirely a case of amour-propre. The position in Iraq was an extremely difficult one, owing to the mixture of races, and, if a Commission of Enquiry went out, it would certainly arouse many passions and would be a focus for all sorts of com plaints from the Assyrians. This might easily arouse inter-racial difficulties, and, by sending out such a commission, the League might quite well risk stirring up the very troubles which it wished to avoid. The United Kingdom representative did not say that this ruled out the idea, but it was necessary to consider the risk. I urthermore, he could not help feeling that the despatch of a Commission of hnqmry might be a kind of red herring across the trail of the settlement work which was the main task of the committee. The great thing was to get the ^ P 10 ^^ em solved by the removal of the Assyrians from Iraq as soon as possible, and the committee should be careful to do nothing which might hamper lather than help this work. The risks were serious ones to take unless the a egations of a single interested party were supported by reports from other souices. It was easy for the Mar Shimun to make somewhat irresponsible accusa ions and then to claim that, if there were any doubt about the truth of these accusations, a certain course should be adopted which the Mar Shimun must know perfectly well would be liable to cause serious trouble. The committee must eware o being influenced by the Mar Shimun to play his game. The United ingdom representative was not, of course, in a position to pronounce on the truth of many of the statements made in the Mar Shimun’s letter, but some of ese statements were obviously exaggerated and tendentious. On the other hand,some of the allegat ons were serious and disquieting, and the committee certainly could not afford to leave the letter on one side without taking any action. But he asked the committee to bear in mind that Iraq was now a fully independent State and that no measures should be suggested which the committee would be unwilling; to suggest m the case of any other fully independent State. A recommendation *^iat some special machinery be set up for ascertaining the facts would indicate after all, that the committee placed no reliance on the reports of the Iraqi Govern- ment, and this was a serious reflection to make without even giving the Iraqi Government a chance to answer the Mar Shimun’s charges. It seemed to the United Kingdom representative that responsibility must be placed on the Iraqi Government, and that there was perhaps some advantage in treating this matter on purely normal lines. The committee had received certain accusations, of the truth of which it was not in a position to judge. The natural course, therefore, seemed to be to forward the letter to the Iraqi Government and to ask for their comments. The committee had the right to do this, and the United Kingdom representative thought that it was its duty also, and that the committee should not be deflected from taking this course by the fact that the Iraqi Government had protested in previous cases. He suggested, however, that the letter should not merely be sent to the Iraqi representative with a formal request for observations, but that the president should see Taufiq Beg Suwaidi and explain to him the anxiety which the committee felt and their desire to get at the truth of the situation. The president might also impress on Taufiq Bey that the committee relied upon the Iraqi Government to prevent any recurrence of the events of last The United Kingdom representative repeated that he did not wish to press this course if the committee desired to consider further the question of some independent investigation, and his remarks were simply made as a contribution to a general objective discussion. He did not wish to suggest that there was no cause for anxiety regarding the present situation of the Assyrians in Iraq. He reminded the committee, indeed, that he had constantly referred to the risks involved if settlement were long delayed and to the ease with which a dangerous situation could be produced. He wished to emphasise these points again, but such information as was in his possession inclined him to believe that the present situation was not so serious as the Mar Shimun’s letters would lead one to suppose. Naturally, His Majesty’s Government were not in a position to give an authorita tive report on the situation, and they could not accept the responsibility of keeping watch over it or of guaranteeing it. Nevertheless, they did what was possible to keep in touch with it, as they were naturally anxious that nothing should go wrong if it could be avoided, and, if the committee wished, the United Kingdom repre sentative, although not authorised to do so by his Government, would be willing, by way of indication, to communicate to the committee, orally, the substance of certain recent reports made by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad. The President repeated that he fully realised the difficulty of proposing an independent commission. Juridically, of course, Iraq was fully independent. There were perhaps nuances in the matter of independence, but he did not wish to pursue this point. He was sure that the committee would be glad to receive any information which the United Kingdom representative could give, and he wondered whether His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to supply further information in the future. He did not suggest that they should take any official responsibility in this matter, but it would naturally be of mteres o e committee to have any information which His Majesty s Governmen e m a position to supply. The United Kingdom Rem-esentatiee said that he would submit this suggestion to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. He could not of course, encourage the hope that they would be willing to fuims 111 . , regularly. There were many difficulties, and His Majesty s overnm g well feel that they could not assume responsibility for keeping • , informed in this matter. At the same time he felt sure that they we help the committee as much as possible, and, in the absence 0 se - A they might conceivably be willing to communicate to the committee such mto 1011 interest as they might receive. Meanwhile, he was , rp r f S responsibility, to give Confidentially the substance of cer ai P received from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad.

I have seldom seen such healthy looking cfeldren, and no trace of the eye disease with which they are so commonly ffflicted in their own homes was noticeable. The Assyrian doctor 1 in charge of the medical arrangements in the camp informed me that thSe had beln practically no sickness among the refugees since the 1st January, and that the very few deaths which had occurred were among sickly new-born infants who had no chance of surviving. Dr. McLeod the e vil surgeon of Mosul, who has had a long experience of medical work m this country told me that he had no hesitation in saying that these Assyrian refugees enjoyed far better conditions of health and general well-being than they were accustomed to in their own villages. . , . ' “ The two deputations of Assyrian men whom I interviewed complained chiefly of the delay which had occurred in finding a new home for those Assyrians who wished to leave Iraq. They informed me that practically the whole Assyrian community was anxious to go, if a suitable country could be found elsewhere. I explained to them that it was no easy matter to transplan 20 000 refugees to a distant country. The League had set up a special committee, which had held several meetings at Geneva and had despatched a committee of experts to South America to make enquiries and report. 1 impressed on them once more that they should do everything to prevent able- bodied Assyrians from leaving their cultivated lands and crowding into the towns. It was likely that whatever Government agreed to receive them would require that the new settlers should be agriculturalists. “ The warm clothing that had so kindly been purchased by Lord Lugard and the ‘ Save the Children Fund ’ was unfortunately despatched by the long route via Basra, in spite of the instructions sent from Bagdad, and the bulk of it arrived in Mosul on the day of my visit. Although this clothing arrived too late to be of use during the winter, it is a very welcome reserve for future emergencies. The Iraqi Government made a liberal provision of warm clothes and bedding for the refugees during the past cold season, and I did not receive a single complaint on the score of insufficiency of clothing during my visit to the camp. “ The plight of the refugees who have come in from the villages to Mosul gives no cause for serious anxiety at present, as there is still plenty of money in the possession of the Assyrian community, and the well-to-do are notoriously generous in assisting their less fortunate fellow-tribesmen. Ever} effort, however, is still being made by British and Iraqi officials in the service of the Iraqi Government to induce these refugees to return to their villages and work in the fields until arrangements have been made to accommodate them in a new country.” That was in the middle of March, but the Ambassador had, towards the did of April, made a further tour in the north of Iraq, in the course of which he had had the opportunity of visiting a number of Assyrian villages and of discussing the situation with all shades of Assyrian opinion. In Mosul and the villages in the Dohuk and Shaikhan areas he formed the impression that the state of security was good, but that there was a definite a PP re ' hension about the future—particularly as regards the attitude of the Kurds i re-settlement were long delayed. The Assyrians in these areas were living chieny on their savings and on the charity of their friends, and had so far refused, witii few exceptions, to sow their crops, in spite of the readiness of the Iraqi Govern^ ment to repair their houses and to provide the necessary means. Sir F. Humphi} 8 estimated the numbers in these areas at about 12,000, and gained the impression that the majority would wish to leave.On the other hand, the majority of the 8,000 Assyrians living in the districts of Amadiya, Hanr and Rowanduz showed signs of wishing to remain in Iraq if security remained as at present. In these areas there had been practically no losses of property or rifles. No fears were expressed to Sir F. Humphrys about security and the Assyrians were generally prosperous, though some were chafing 'finder the burden of supporting the families of men who had gone to Syria These reports appeared to show that there was at present no need for exceptional measures. On the other hand, Sir F. Humphrys emphasised the dangerous situation which was likely to arise if there were delay in resettlement. In March he had said that the general attitude of the Assyrians was one of restless expectation. They still possessed some 4,000 to 5,000 rifles, and serious trouble might easily develop out of any incident. In his last report Sir F. Humphrys said that he had urged the Iraqi Government to do everything possible to provide adequate security, and, if they fulfilled their promises, he did not anticipate trouble from either Assyrians or Kurds during the summer. But he feared that destitution might assume serious proportions unless some emigration could start in the next five months. Frustrated hopes would engender feelings of despair and would lead to thefts and clashes with their neighbours. Once this happened the situation would rapidly become dangerous, and Sir F. Humphrys urged that, if possible, emigration should start in July and continue in August and September, as this would not only relieve the pressure, but would stimulate the patience of those left behind. The President expressed sincere appreciation for this information. He confessed himself anxious, however, about the suggestion that emigration ought to begin so early. He did not himself see how this was to be brought about. The negotiations were bound to take a long time and it would be necessary to submit the whole scheme to the Council for definite approval before it could be put into effect, and, if this could not be done at the forthcoming Council, which was obviously impossible, there was no other Council until September. The Danish Representative said that he disagreed with the president’s view. The Council had purposely delegated wide powers to the committee and his view was that, unless a question arose of engaging the financial responsibility of the League, he did not think that any further reference to the Council was necessary before a scheme could be put into operation. The President admitted that the Danish Representative was right. On the other hand, would the committee be able to settle the difficult question of finance itself, even though the responsibility of the League was not engaged? So fai there was an offer from His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to pay their share of a League contribution. There was a somewhat vague oA 61 * rom the Iraqi Government and the prospects of that offer being implemente pre sumably diminished as time went on. There was, further, an appeal ma eye League to Governments and private institutions which had so tar remame entirely without answer. The United Kingdom Representative said that he felt obliged to take up this point about finance. ’ He regretted that during the morning s meeting he had dad to express his disagreement with the president in M. Werner s presence, bound to recall, however, that the committee in its last report to ie clearly contemplated that the question of finance could not be S&lt; L ® , , number of the Assyrians who wished to leave Iraq was known. P .-i actually said that the Iraqi Government could not decide had this stage had been reached. Furthermore, the appeal wuc mio-oested made had been based on a passage in the committee s repor w balance that Governments and private institutions might be asked o ma P a r j ans when Che size of the contributions of the Iraqi Government and . he ^ssynans themselves was known. Obviously, therefore, the appea ^p S t even taken immediately into consideration and very probably no nracticable to considered it yet. He himself very much doubted wl ® 61 1 „ as re gards expect a response to the appeal until the Assyrians Lad e intervene during their wishes' and it was for that reason that he had felt bound to intervene during the morning’s meeting. i r -l dirl The President agreed that the committee s re P c ! r ^ ^Vp^b^y.ssvrians had ^ggest that the question of finance could only be settled after the Assyrians nadbeen consulted, and tteco^ hope of g ettm |*r°ug thoug ht that the committee had sufficiently discussed thg Sn of sendffig out as^al commission of enquiry to Iraq and that any such idea might be withdrawn for the time being. He proposed that the com- mitteediould^ proceed to consider the nature of its report to the Council. ThP Danish Revresentative said that, on this question, committee must consider the political situation in Brazil and particularly the fact that the election was due to take place on the 14th May. It might be well to postpone any discussion in the Council until after that date. ,| The President pointed out that it was not only the date of the report that was in question, but whether any report should be rendered to the Council at all. The French Revresentative asked whether the matter could not be dealt with in a private session of the Council. It was pointed out, however, tlmt this would really offer no advantage. The question at issue was not really what the committee could report to the Council, but what could be published at this stage. The Danish Representative suggested that an attempt should be made to get a telegraphic report from the Spanish Ambassador in Rio as to whether publicity after the 14th Mav was likelv to be dangerous. The President expressed the view that the election was, according to press reports, not likely to proceed entirely normally. It might, in fact, give rise to some disturbances and trouble. Also, it would take some time for the new Government to settle down, and he did not think that the 14th May could be regarded as a decisive date. There was likely to be a period of some uncertainty after that. He then asked for the opinion of other members of the committee on the question of presenting a report. The United Kingdom Representative said that to present no report at all might give rise to fresh rumours and might produce a bad effect, not only in Brazil but among the Assyrians and their sympathisers, who were expecting some definite decision at the forthcoming Council. It might be, therefore, that to present no report could create more trouble than a report which referred to the Brazilian scheme. In any case, the last report of the committee had dealt extensively with the Brazilian scheme and it would be extremely odd if the next report were entirely silent about it. His own view was that the committee must inform the Council briefly of the state of its work, but any report would naturally have to be a meagre one as there were many details which could not be published at present. The President said that he was inclined to share this view. The members of the Council who were not represented on the Council Committee could be informed orally and privately of the reasons for which it had been necessary to present a meagre report. After further discussion, it was agreed that there was little reason not to mention the Brazilian scheme and the difficulties which prevented its immediate application. After all, those difficulties were already to a large extent common property, and it was perhaps desirable that the committee should refer to them briefly, rather than by silence invite a charge of slackness and lack of energy itself. The United Kingdom Representative was ultimately invited to act as the rapporteur of the committee and to draw up a report for consideration at the opening of the Council meeting. It was suggested that this report should annex Brigadier Browne s report and, possibly, Major Johnson’s report, and also the correspondence which had passed with the Iraqi Government since the last meeting of the Council. It was agreed that Brigadier Browne’s report and Major Johnson’s report should be carefully edited for this purpose, so as to remove any passages which might give rise to press controversy at this stage, and it was decided that the report should mention that the committee had discussed the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq with the Iraqi representative. It was agreed that no mention should be made of the Mar Shimun’s letter of the 3rd May. he committee then turned to further consideration of the Mar Shimun s1 iCt 4at|4| tsomeidi ; the coni t no rei io were i ich re: been new The President said that he was inclined to agree with the United Kingdom representative in suggesting that the letter should be communicated officially to the Iraqi Government. At the same time, if the committee agreed, he' would speak to Taufiq Beg Suwaidi and explain the anxiety of the committee to have the Mar Shimun’s allegations thoroughly investigated. He proposed to have an interview with the Iraqi representative for that purpose on the following day The president then invited the committee to consider the second part of the Mar Shimun’s letter, which advocated steps to settle the Assyrians in Canada, Turkey and Syria. He asked whether the committee thought' it worth while to send a reminder to the Government of Canada. The United Kingdom RepTesentative expressed doubt as to the advisability of this course. What he had himself envisaged was that, if the Brazilian scheme broke down, the Canadian Government, and any other Government which had not replied to the League’s enquiry, might be approached with a good deal more insistence than was now possible. They could then be urged to consider the matter favourably. If, however, a mere reminder were sent to them at this stage, they would almost certainly, so long as the fate of the Brazilian scheme was unknown, take up a negative attitude from which it might be very difficult to dislodge them at a later stage. It was agreed that it would be preferable not to remind the Canadian Government at the moment. It was also agreed that there was little purpose in approaching the Govern ment of Turkey and, in fact, it was undesirable to do so, since, in the unlikely event of their agreeing to take the Assyrians, it would certainly be impossible to get them to agree to special safeguards for them. The President then asked the French representative whether he saw any objection to a request to the mandatory Power to consider settlement in Syria. The French Representative said that this was a difficult question. His own view was that it was better not to chase two hares at the same time, and that to approach other Governments might be bad policy in the dealings of the committee with Brazil. Apart from this, the question of settlement in Syria was, he thought, likely to be one of some difficulty, judging by the difficulties which the French Government were experiencing in the matter of other immigrants. It was agreed that, for the time being, at all events, no note should be addressed to the French Government, but that the committee should continue to concentrate on the Brazilian scheme. After a discussion on future arrangements, M. Arocha informed the committee that a request had been received from the International Labour Office asking for a collection of documents concerning the Assyrian settlement scheme to assist the International Labour Office in its study of questions of colonisation. It was agreed to defer consideration of this request until it had been decided to what extent Brigadier Browne’s and Major Johnson’s reports should be modified. It was felt that, if these reports were communicated to the International Labour Office, they should be communicated in the same form in which they might ultimately be presented to the Council of the League.

United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, May 12, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Assyrian Question Record of the Twenty-Fifth Meeting of the Council Committee, held on May 8, 1934, at 10 a.m. THE President invited Brigadier Browne to comment on the despatch to the Spanish Ambassador of the 10th April, which had been communicated to him on the previous day. Brigadier Browne observed that, in the first paragraph of the despatch, reference was made to the authorisation which was sent to him to communicate the first part of his preliminary report to the Brazilian authorities. In point of fact, the mission had doubted whether this was opportune, and had not communicated the document. They had simply informed interested Ministers of the gist of the report. Major Johnson suggested that, if it was the intention of the committee that the preliminary report should be communicated to the Brazilian authorities, the Spanish Ambassador might now be authorised to communicate it. It was agreed to leave this point until a decision had been taken as to what circulation should be given to the final report of the mission. Brigadier Browne observed that, in paragraph 4 of the despatch of the 10th April, it was said that the committee understood that the conditions w ^n only be favourable for settlement operations until September. 1 he mission a , however, come to the conclusion that some settlement might be possib e f 8 even after that date.

It was agreed to reserve this point for future considei ation and not to sa\ anything about it to the Spanish Ambassador at the present time. As regards the suggestion in paragraph 7 that the Spanish could count upon the support of the local representatives o thought represented on the Council Committee, Brigadier Browne said that te thought that the Spanish Ambassador would appreciate the help o , aooeared tives.

There had, of course, already been close co-operation between the Spanish Ambassador and His Majesty’s Ambassador, as telegrams from the two Ambassadors showed. The President recalled that earlier instructions sent to the Spanish Ambassador in January last had made much the same point. He thought matters might be left as they were for the present, though each member of the committee would no doubt consider whether any fresh instructions to the repiesentative of their country in Rio were necessary. nit, [\] the fi ement, T litoiof these ip raid send ai All he had: Brigadier Browne then referred to the statement of the Brazilian conditions in paragraph 9 (1) of the despatch. The second condition stated that the settle ment mSst occasion no expense to Brazil. In this connexion he would like to point out that, if immigrants were transported on the Government railways, tree passages could be requisitioned for them, this did, in effect, involve expense to the Brazilian Government. In reply to a question by the Danish representative, Brigadier Browne added that he thought the committee was justified in assuming that this concession would be granted, even in the case of a large number of immigrants like the Assyrians. The mission had certainly been given to under stand this by the Brazilian authorities. rt enter into i )l merely to ensi piata as th en ! s repoi femain in their fcil in a n P Ambassador. The question was raised whether anything on these lines should be said to the Spanish Ambassador. The United Kingdom representative observed that the point had already been dealt with to some extent in paragraph 27 of the despatch, where the hope was expressed that the Brazilian Government would accord railway facilities similar to those which were given to immigrants in general. lorJirm th The officij rse a very i railway facilities similar to those which were given to immigrants m geneicu. The general view of the committee, however, appeared to be that it might be well to point out to the Spanish Ambassador that the commission had received an assurance on this point. Major Johnson said that the assurance came from Dr. Bandeira de Mello, who had informed him that any immigrant was entitled to free transport. This did not apply to small numbers only, but to any number of immigrants.

Brigadier Browne said that this completed his observations on the despatch of the 10th April. The United Kingdom Representative suggested that the committee should now consider whether to draw the attention of the Spanish Ambassador, in a supplementary despatch, to particular points arising out of the reports oi Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson which might at some stage require discussion with the Brazilian Government. The President asked Brigadier Browne whether he thought this necessary or desirable. Brigadier Browne said that the Spanish Ambassador was already possession of a copy of his report, but not of Major Johnson’s report, which had been completed since the commission left Brazil. It would, no doubt, be necessary3 to tie |i| :: e thought i| of | ’aziliaucoi .edthatt ^ouldlilietil mt railw involve eipeij ish represetf itifiedins , large en givei s h°uldtejj 27 of tied™ 5 to send to the Spanish Ambassador a copy of the latter report, but he doubted whether the despatch that had already been sent needed any addition The Spanish Ambassador had already been given a formidable task, and it would perhaps be better to send no further details until after the election in Brazil when the prospects would be easier to judge. The President said that this corresponded with his own ideas. He thought ihat the task of the Spanish Ambassador should at present be political rather than technical, and he was not anxious for him to be drawn too closely into technical details. He thought that the committee should wait until the general questions of principle explained in the despatch of the 10th April had been cleared up before doing more. The United Kingdom Re'pvesentcitive explained that he had no wish to go outside the framework of the despatch of the 10th April, but that despatch had been specifically subject to modification in the light of consultation with Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson. It had pointed out that the negotiations with the Brazilian Government must cover {a) the conditions laid down by that Government, (h) the future treatment of the Assyrians, and (c) the physical details of settlement. The committee had refrained in the despatch from entering into the third of these points, and the Spanish Ambassador had been informed that they would send any necessary indications after Brigadier Browne’s return to Geneva. All he had in mind was to complete the despatch, as promised. The President agreed that that was the position, but doubted whether it was necessary to enter into further details at present. He thought that the best course would be merely to ensure that the Spanish Ambassador was in possession of the same information as the committee, i.e., that he had both Brigadier Browne’s and Major Johnson’s reports. He did not think that any further progress on this point could be made until the question had been settled whether these reports should remain in their present form or be modified. If the reports were presented to the Council in a modified form, he thought that the originals ought to be suppressed and the modified copies only circulated to all concerned, including the Spanish Ambassador. Major Johnson then drew attention to the varying rates of exchange current m Brazil. The official rate was 60 milreis to the pound, but on the so-called Black Bourse a very much better rate could be obtained. The point was one of importance in connexion with the total cost of the scheme. The contract would have to be drawn up in milreis, and the League might effect a considerable saving if it could obtain a better exchange rate than the official one. Naturally, the League could not deal on the Black Bourse, but there was also what was known as the Grey Bourse, where, for the purpose of certain transactions and with governmental authority, the rate of 72 milreis to the pound was obtainable. Major Johnson suggested that the committee might comment on this fact to the Spanish Ambassador, and recommend the latter to bear it in mind and to endeavour to find out whether governmental facilities for dealings on the Grey Bourse could be put at the League’s disposal. Discussion took place between the Danish representative and Major Johnson f whether it could not be left to Parana Plantations (Limited) to obtain this favourable rate of exchange, the role of the League being to support their application with the Brazilian Government. It was decided to consider this question further at a later stage. The President thanked Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson for the assistance which they had given, and asked them to keep in touch with the L nited Lmgdom representative for the purpose of helping him to draw up the proposed feport to the Council, and of deciding what modifications, if any, were necessary 111 the two reports which they had presented, if those reports were to be communicated to the Council and published. {Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson then withdrew)} The President then asked the committee to consider what was to be said to e Iraqi representative, who had been invited to attend at 4-30 that afternoon. e proposed, before that meeting, to hand to the Iraqi representative, with a Personal explanation, the official letter asking for the observations of the Iraqi, i _ ? o vf i May The next question was Government on the Mar SHmuns let e y bout Bli diel .

The results vould be communicated to the Iraqi representative as soon as this work was inished.

United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, May 16,1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Assyrian Question. Record of the Twenty-seventh Meeting of the Council Committee held on May IT 3*30 p.m. THE committee considered a draft report to the Council. The United Kingdom Representative said that, since drafting the report, a certain number of suggestions had been made to him, and he had prepared amendments to meet these. The general object of the amendments was to guard against giving too optimistic an impression as regards the possibility of putting the Brazilian scheme into effect and to make it clear that, although the Brazilian scheme seemed entirely suitable from the physical point of view, the difficulties were greater than generally realised. The amendments proposed were agreed to and the report adopted. The United Kingdom Representative suggested that, before the present session of the committee ended, it would be advisable to send to the Spanish Ambassador a copy of Major Johnson’s report for confidential information, and also to authorise the Ambassador to communicate to the Brazilian Government a copy of the committee’s report to the Council. Furthermore, although the com mittee had decided at a previous meeting not at this stage to address the Spams Ambassador on a number of details raised by Brigadier Browne s and Majoi Johnson’s reports, there were one or two points to which it had been tnougn advisable to draw his attention. The United Kingdom representative had drawn up the draft of a despatch to the Spanish Ambassador to give effect to wnat e believed to be the committee’s wishes. The draft despatch was adopted.

From this and from his o-eneral manner, M. Olivan felt some doubt whether he had in fact, received specific orders to concern himself with the question or to go to Iraq. It seemed possible that, being concerned with emigration questions m general and having heard of the proposal to settle the Assyrians in Brazil he had rather wished to be concerned with the question. The President had, therefore, while expressing readiness to maintain contact with him, intimated that a good deal yet remained to be done before the question of a visit to Iraq could be usefully .considered. Mr. Walters said that the League had heard of Colonel Gaelzer-Netto previously, as the colonel had some weeks ago informed the Nansen Office, from Berlin, that he had been instructed to concern himself with the Assyrian question and had asked for certain information concerning it. A collection of official documents had been made, and the Nansen Office had sent it to Colonel Gaelzer- Netto with an intimation that they would be glad to supply any further information which he desired. The President observed that it was not at all clear what Colonel Gaelzer- Netto’s position was, and he simply wished for the moment to bring to the committee’s notice the conversation which he had had with him. It was agreed that it should be left to the President to decide the date of the next meeting, it being realised that no further progress could be made until after the presidential election in Brazil and after the receipt of a report from the Spanish Ambassador on the prospects of making progress.

VII.] League of Nations : Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq. Report by the Committee to the Council.—(Received in Foreign Office, May 18.) THE committee for the settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq has continued actively to pursue its task since the last session of the Council with an acute sense of the seriousness of the issue involved and of the desirability of reaching a speedy solution. The committee believes that the exceptional nature of the task and the difficulties involved were fully realised by the Council when it set up the committee, in an endeavour to help the Iraqi Government, at the latter’s request, by consider ing to what extent it was practicable to solve the problem of the Assyrians of Iraq by means of their settlement outside Iraq, in accordance with what was understood to be the desire of that population itself. The early stages of the committee’s work have already been described in the report submitted to and approved by the Council on the 19th January last, but, at the risk of some repetition, it may be useful now to give a general review of the problem which has faced the committee and the steps which it has so far taken, in order that the Council may appreciate the present position. The duties assigned to the committee when it was set up on the 14th October last were two-fold :— (a) To consider whether the settlement outside Iraq of those Assyrians who might wish to leave that country would be possible in practice. If so, the committee was to take, in close co-operation vyith the Iraqi Govern ment, all such steps as it might think fit with a view to the preparation and execution of a detailed scheme. (6) Eventually to examine, in consultation with the Iraqi Government and on the basis of reports furnished by the latter, the measures taken by that Government in order to give full effect to the Council s resolution oi the 15th December, 1932, so far as concerned those Assyrians w o might wish to remain in Iraq. Furthermore, until the arrangements contemplated above had been put dfect, the Iraqi Government was asked by the Council to keep the commi ee regularly informed of the measures taken to ensure the safety of the Assyrians m Iran tn qcoIof in pnnsfvmence ot the events or last [106 s—1]nrevious to the events of last summer, been engaged as settlement adviser to the Iraqi Government, in pursuance of the Council’s resolution of the loth December^ iSo «nd since those events, has been responsible for the organisation and IdminSration of the Assyrian refugee camp at Mosul. The duties of this committee were in the first place, to explain the position to the Assyrians and subsequently as soon as possible after a place of settlement had been definite^ fixed to ascertain which of the Assyrians desired to leave Iraq, and to take all necessary measures in connexion with their departure. The Iraqi Government agreed that, in the second and third of these tasks a representative of the Nansen Office for Refugees should proceed to Iraq to collaborate with the local committee and with the local authorities. -in i 4-r t • According to information supplied to the Oouncil Committee by the Iraqi Government the local committee completed the first phase of its work between the 28th November and the 9th December of last year. Its procedure was to visit each of the qadhas in the north of Iraq in which the Assyrians are resident and to interview, assembled together in some convenient centre, leading Assyrians and the headmen of all the Assyrian villages in the qadha. At each interview the resolution passed bv the Council on the 14th October last and the task oi the committee set up in virtue of that resolution weie explained, and the Assyrians were informed that a place of settlement had not yet been found and that a con siderable period might elapse before the necessary arrangements were completed. In the meanwhile, they were advised to resume their normal life and to continue their agricultural activities, and they were assured that, when the time came, every head of a family would have perfect liberty to say whether he wished to go or not, and that those who wished to stay in Iraq would be free to do so, on the understanding that they would be bound to obey the laws of Iraq and to be loyal to the Iraqi Government. The second and third tasks assigned to the local committee in collaboration with a representative of the Nansen Office cannot, of course, be undertaken until a place of settlement has been finally decided upon. As regards the all-important question of finance, the committee drew the attention of the Council to the position in its report at the last session. It recalled that the Iraqi Government had declared itself ready to make as generous a contribution as its resources permitted, and that the question of the extent to which the Assyrians could themselves participate financially would be examined at the proper time; but it pointed out that, should the funds supplied by the Iraqi Government and the Assyrians prove inadequate, it would be necessary to seek other sources. The committee, further, drew attention to the fact that the United Kingdom Government had declared its willingness to pay its share of a League contribution, and the committee accordingly referred to the Council the question of the possibility of a League contribution. The Council decided that a League contribution was, immediately, at all events, not practicable, and it took what appeared to be the only course open to it and appealed, in its resolution of the 19th January, to the generosity of Governments and private organisations to consider participating in the financing of an eventual settlement scheme, having regard more especially to the humanitarian aspect of the problem. Here again, however, it is unlikely that further substantial progress can be expected until a concrete scheme can be placed before the Governments and institutions concerned. In its search for a suitable destination for the Assyrians, the committee felt bound to explore a wide field and there is no continent in the world m which it has not considered possibilities. It has approached those Governments whose territories appeared to offer favourable prospects, but in no case so far have the prospects proved on examination to be so promising as those held oat by a scheme, brought to the notice of the committee at the very outset of its work, by the Nansen Office, for settlement in Brazil on lands belonging to Parana Plantations (Limited) in the State of Parana. These lands had already been the subject of a report by M. Redard, counsellor of the Swiss Legation at Rio de Janeiro, who had been authorised by his Government, at an earlier date, to inspect them on behalf of the Nansen Office in connexion with the settlement of other refugees. This report and preliminary discussions between the Nansen Office, acting on behalf of the Council Committee, and the company concerned showed tna The area was sufficiently large to accommodate all the Assyrians of Iraq, and w asap popul [S of Brazil w; i without th Jitlat the Assy 1 liisefulelemeE Ik Council was send out Bri feingtheco illaracteristi k Brigadier I Insisted after fefier Browne i April and s already e Stations (I Ipeffs with e: ml Germai succeeded pmal, I Nwsomef) |pnt, and fn Ntktl Noseobtaii [Yimous com 7 Proposed I^Wsii TO Went P co 'HIthat, prima facie, the scheme offered the necessary elements of success. Before any progress could be made, however, the first step was to obtain the consent of the Brazilian Government. That Government was accordingly approached and, after considering the representations made to it by the committee regarding the urgency and humanitarian nature of the problem, generously declared itself ifeady in principle to accept all the Assyrians of Iraq in groups of 500 families at a time, as and when Parana Plantations (Limited) was able to provide for their settlement. Before discussing with the Brazilian Government the conditions of this settlement, there was a preliminary step which the committee felt bound to take. The transfer of a population from the north of Iraq to a region so different as the south of Brazil was naturally not an operation which the committee could embark upon without the greatest precaution. It was necessary to establish in the interests of all concerned, not only of the Assyrians themselves, but also of Brazil and of the League of Nations, that the climate and physical conditions were such that the Assyrians could be expected to adapt themselves and to settle down as a useful element in Brazil. As the Council was informed at its last session, the committee accordingly decided to send out Brigadier-General Browne to the area in question with the object of advising the committee, in the light of his special knowledge of Assyrian needs and characteristics, whether the scheme proposed offered good prospects of success. Brigadier Browne was accompanied by Mr. Johnson, Secretary- General of the Nansen Office, and, by the courtesy of the Swiss Government, he was also assisted after his arrival in Brazil by M. Redard. Brigadier Browne and Mr. Johnson were in Brazil from the 12th February to the 8th April, and the committee desires to record its high appreciation of the thorough and conscientious manner in which they and M. Redard carried out their task. After contact had been established with the Brazilian authorities in Rio de Janeiro, a preliminary visit was made to the land owned by Parana Plantations (Limited) in North Parana. The mission first inspected settlements already established in the neighbourhood of Londrina, where Parana Plantations (Limited) has its headquarters, and satisfied itself by means- of interviews with existing settlers of various nationalities {e.g., Austrian,. Czechoslovak, German, Italian, Japanese and Polish) that, in general, these settlers had succeeded in becoming self-supporting within about mont s of their arrival. The area which the company had offered for Assyrian settlement was some 66 kilom. south-west of Londrina. Most of it is still virgin forest, but by means of personal investigation, so far as the existing loiest iacvs would permit, and from information obtained from various sources, t e mission satisfied itself that the conditions obtaining there were m all essen la respec s similar to those obtaining in the areas already cleared and settled, an i ainve at the unanimous conclusion that the .area in question was suitab e in a ies P®^ s for Assyrian settlement.

(3) Cattle and Sheep Raising and Pig Breeding. That a certain number of Assyrians have experience of cattle raising, while practically the whole nation is well acquainted with sheep and goat raising. So far in the Londrina area sheep raising has only been tried to a limited extent, but goats are plentiful and do well. The Assyrians should find no difficulty in pig breeding. mission was ash fctleirown sch id itself in the la was clearlv ba fci could not, of [i-memoire for 1 dissipating the i (4) A gricultural Settlement Conditions. The mission was asked to enquire into the possibility of village settlements under conditions similar to those to which the Assyrians are accustomed. Settle ment under these conditions is not excluded, but the mission, for a variety of reasons, recommends that the Assyrians should be settled, at the outset at all events, in groups of four families, each family to be allotted 5 alqueires of land, with a house for the four families at the point of contact of the four blocks of land. Each group of four families would thus be separated from the surrounding similar groups by about 750 metres. There would be ample opportunity and material for individual families to construct separate houses for themselves, should they desire to do so later. The mission was asked whether 5 alqueires (roughly 12 hectares or 30 acres) a family was sufficient for the reasonable requirements of an Assyrian family. Its opinion was that 5 alqueires were sufficient in the first instance. Settlers, as they became more proficient and affluent, might extend their area, but any smaller amount in the first instance was not advisable. Basing itself on the experience of existing settlers the mission considers that the Assyrians should become self-supporting on their land in eight months, and should have no difficulty in repaying the expenses of land purchase, settlement aud transport in twelve years.

The first endeavour will be to put settlers on the land irrespective of their abilities in other directions. In their conversations with the competent Brazilian officials, as well as in their aide-memoire, to which reference is made later in this report, the mission explained that, although the majority of the Assyrians were agricultural or pastoral people, there were, nevertheless, a certain number who followed other occupations—such as carpenters, blacksmiths, builders and weavers of cloth whose services could be usefully employed on the spot in the development of the proposed settlement without detriment to the national labour market. The mission suggests that such of those Assyrians as cannot be so employed should pass a period of apprenticeship in an agricultural experimental station to be maintained in the settlement, or with qualified Assyrian agricultural families, beiore being definitely allotted their own holdings. (6) Food. The mission was asked to ascertain whether the reasonable food requirements o the Assyrians could be satisfied at reasonable prices. It reported that, until the Assyrians were obtaining food from their own lands, their food requirements could be satisfied at reasonable prices. i$n fSwthee: IS the I, 'S)toi I Ike Nisti iCTiaas5 (7) Medical A Mention.

The mission was asked to ascertain whether the Assyrians would be allowed facilities for the practice of their religion. It replied that there is complete religious freedom throughout the country. r |) Schools. The mission was asked to ascertain whether the Assyrians would be allowed to establish their own schools. The reply was in the affirmative on condition that Portuguese was taught. While the mission was in Brazil a certain opposition to Assyrian immigration manifested itself in the Brazilian Parliament and press. For the most part the opposition was clearly based on erroneous information regarding the Assyrians. The mission could not, of course, enter into public controversy, but it at once drew up an aide-memoire for personal communication to those interested, with the object of dissipating the misconceptions which were being so unfortunately spread. This aide-memoire contains so useful a description of the qualities of the Assyrians that the committee has decided to bring it to the notice of the Council and attaches it as annex 3( 1 ) to this report. The Brazilian Government set up a commission of enquiry into the objections raised to the reception of the Assyrians. Brigadier Browne’s mission was received by this commission on the 6th April, and had the opportunity of drawing attention to some of the prevalent misconceptions regarding the Assyrians. A copy of the above-mentioned aide-memoire was handed to the commission. To sum up, the position as regards the scheme for settlement in Parana is that the Brazilian Government, when made aware of the grave problem with which the Council of the League is faced, declared, in January last, its readiness in principle to accept the Assyrians. Before proceeding further, the committee felt it necessary to assure itself that the Assyrians could be expected to adapt themselves to conditions in Parana and to develop into an element useful to Brazil. As a result of Brigadier Browne’s mission it is now satisfied that given goodwill, initiative and energy on the part of the Assyrians, which there is no reason to doubt, there is every cause to believe that they would thrive in the area concerned. The transfer of so large a population raises, however, problems more difficult than is generally realised, and it is yet too early for the committee to express an opinion whether the scheme for settlement in Brazil can be put into effect. The next step will be to enter into detailed negotiations with the Brazilian Government as soon as circumstances permit, in the hope of working out a plan acceptable to that Government. The committee is mindful of the need of the earliest possible solution in view of the -in i • i • r ii.. a £snm a 1 nc.rsons. Assf rim # present unsettled condition of the Assyrians in Iraq.

I think however that it is extremely unlikely that they would agree, as all oolonisable tracts in India are pre- sunably wanted for Indians. In the ordinary course foreigners of good char acter wishing to settle in Inida^ can get visas if they can show that they have the means of keeping themselves in India; and it la quite conceivable that a very small number of Assyrian fam ilies might get into India in this way if persons in India, e.g. their co-religionists if any, were willing to look after them. A number of german Jews have recently gone to India in this so£t of way, and at least one has been given some sort of Government employment (in an Indian State, % think I was told). But even if India were willing to take half a dozen Assyrian families, I oppose it is quite likely that it would be impossible to find ke-lf a dozen willing to be separated from the rest # Prom the sources of information available to the De partment l have not been able to discover whether there are As- a yrian Christians in India acknowledging Mar Shimun. Ihe 1921Census Report olassea all Christians not being Catholic, or Protestants as 'Syrians?' but sone of these, e.g. the 'Chaldeans' of Malabar may really be co-religionists of the people now in question. The total number of Chaldeans is given as 100. The 1931 Census Report throws no light on the quest! on. But even if it were otherwise feasible to settle some of these Assyrians in Malabar, there would apparently be a serious difficulty arising out of the climatic conditions. I can only suggest that if it is desired to pursue the question further, it should be referred to the ^Viceroy. 11'^ • f.o.d 4yI t .

Record of the Twenty-second Meeting of the Council Committee, held on April 9, 1934, at 4 p.m.— {Communicated hy United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva; Received April 13, 1934.) AT the request of the president, the United Kingdom Representative read out to the committee the text of two telegrams received from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rio de Janeiro (see Annexes A and B).^) The President then proposed that the committee should consider what further progress, if any, could be made pending the return to Europe of Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson, and that it should take, as a basis, the draft of a letter to the Spanish Ambassador at Rio de Janeiro which had been prepared by the United Kingdom representative (Annex C( 1 )). Before the committee considered this draft in detail, however, the president wished to make a statement as the representative of Spain. The committee would recall, he said, that at first it had asked the Spanish representative in Rio to use his good offices to persuade the Brazilian Government to modify a decision which would have made a solution of the Assyrian problem in Brazil impossible. The committee was aware of the negotiations which had followed. By a kind of £t automatisme ” the Spanish Ambassador had come to play a preponderant role, and the committee was now considering a draft letter instructing him to take further action on its behalf. For his part, M. Olivan was ready to facilitate matters, but he must enter a reservation against sole responsibility being placed on the Spanish Ambassador, at all events, when the stage of formal negotiations was reached. He was bound to consider this matter from the point of view of Spain, although he did not wish to insist too much on that point of y i ew _ P 11 ^ in any case, it was not altogether fair to the Spanish Ambassador, who had no special knowledge of the problem, to place the whole responsibility on him. If the committee approved the draft letter, he was prepared to facilitate matteis by sending it to the Spanish Ambassador, provided that it was in the nalure not of instructions but of suggestions or indications. The Spanish Ambassa oi could not, in fact, receive instructions from the League. M. Olivan a a nSL felt that it would be necessary for him to refer the whole matter to is overn ment before anything further was addressed to the Spanish Ambassa or. , however, the proposed letter was sent in the form which he had suggested ne i not think it was necessary at this stage to bring in his Go\einmen . ® prepared to consider the matter as merely a continuation o e discussions which the Spanish Ambassador had already been conducting, imt ii the Ambassador was now charged with fche task of making cer a l n , s . , J must not be treated as a precedent or taken to mean that tie P ani , . tter should always be responsible for acting on behalf of the League ^ ^ If, when the purely preliminary stage now contem P , waS 3 w h 0 le were necessary, he would be obliged to ask the committee o ice . , ^ no w - g j :i question of the channel of negotiations. M. Ohvan repea e miite clearlv to to make difficulties, but had thought it right to put the pos q the committee. The members of the committee indicated that ^7 fTciHtate^ma^ters Olivan’s difficulties and were grateful to him for agieei g ^ informal to the extent of asking the Spanish Ambassador to conduct the mtoimai discussions now proposed. p) Not printec [81 n—31 ENOLOSUdc NO. 23 n 7 JUN, 1934Thp Danish Rev^esentative thought it important that the Spanish Ambassador should emphasise m all that he might do that he was acting solely on behalf of the League. The President said that he proposed to accompany the letter from the committee, if approved, with a purely personal letter from himself making thm, suggestion, and also explaining the position quite clearly to the Spanish Ambassador. The committee then proceeded to discuss the draft Jet ter._ The modifications suggested, in so far as they were not purely formal, chiefly aimed at making the draft more objective, as it was felt that it would be best at this stage merely to discuss the various courses open, and the advantages and disadvantages of each, without definitely committing the committee to any particular solution until the around had been prepared and the reaction of the Brazilian Government was to known. The draft despatch having been accepted, the president said that he would send it to the Spanish Ambassador at Rio by the next air mail. It was agreed that it should be sent in French, and that the text in that language should be circulated in due course to the members of the committee. A discussion followed on future procedure. It was felt desirable that the committee should hold a meeting as soon as possible after the return to Europe of Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson, subject to the convenience of Brigadier Browne in particular, who might wish to go to England before coming to Geneva. The president asked the United Kingdom representative to find out what date would be convenient for Brigadier Browne to come to Geneva, and it was left that the president should fix the date of the next meeting when he had this information from the United Kingdom representative. In the meantime, it was decided to regard the despatch to the Spanisn Ambassador and the fact that he was engaged in discussion with the Brazilian Government as strictly confidential. The question was raised whether the substance of the proposed message to the Assyrians should be given to the press. The secretariat were in favour of doing this at once. It was felt, howmver, that it was scarcely possible to give any publicity to the message, at all events until the note to the Iraqi representative had reached the Iraqi Government, particularly in view of the fact that that note stated that the committee were not in a position to address a direct message to the Assyrians and were merely oft'ering to assist the Iraqi Government by authorising them to communicate such a message. It was eventually decided to say nothing to the press except that the committee had that day discussed the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq with the Iraqi representative and with Major Thomson, who was on the point of returning to Iraq, and that the committee would next meet on the return to Europe of Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Ma iestv^r.nv,,.,.,^ and ^ retcrned to the Foreign Offioe if not required for liidal ^7 P. z —^ 1 366, i t IS54 J ; mm irac' fDocypher.

This is concerned mainly with the investigations made by Brigadier-General Browne and Mr. Johnson, of the Nansen Office, on the Parana plantations in Brazil, into the suitability of that land for the settlement of the Assyrians. The Committee reports that as the result of Brigadier-General Browne’s mission it is now satisfied that, given good will, initiative, and energy on the part of the Assyrians, there is every cause to believe that they would thrive in the area concerned. The transfer of so large a population raises, however, diffi cult problems, and it is too early for the Committee to express an opinion whether the scheme can be put into effect. The next step will be to enter into detailed negotiations with the Brazilian Govern ment in the hope of working out a plan acceptable to that Government. Annexes to the report show the position of various settlers who have recently arrived in Brazil under conditions “ inferior, if anything, to those contem plated for the Assyrians.” The conclusion arrived at is that in the absence of un foreseen circumstances the Assyrians should experience no great difficulty in becoming self-supporting within eight months an4 of repaying the cost of land purchase, settlement, and transport within 12 years. The League mission learned that in the event of the Assyrians settling in Brazil there would be no obstacle to the practice of their own faith, as there is complete religious freedom throughout the country. They would also be allowed to establish their own schools, on condition that Portuguese was taught. An aide-memoire published as an annexe to the League Committee s report declares that the Assyrian has obtained a reputation for fighting simply because he has had to fight for his existence for centuries. Given fair treatment he will prove a loyal and useful and not a troublesome citizen. Brigadier-General Browne states that the Assyrians are in the full sense 46 children of the soil, thrifty and very honest in their dealings. They take well to sport. The aide-memoire dispels the notion that 20,000 families are tc } be transported; the number contem- p/ated is between 2,000 and 3,000 families.

[E 2602/1/93] League of Nations. Final Report of the Commission appointed to examine Proposals for the Settlement of Assyrians in Brazil.—[Communicated by the Secret ary-General of the League of Nations, April 27, 1934; Received in Foreign Office, April 30.) THE two members of the commission, Brigadier-General J. Gilbert Browne, C.M.G., C.B.E., D.S.O., and Mr. T. F. Johnson, secretary-general of the Nansen International Office, left Southampton by R.M.L. Almanzora on Saturday, the 27th January, and arrived at Rio de Janeiro on the 12th February, where they were met by the third member, M. Charles Redard, counsellor of the Swiss Legation. This made the commission complete. M. Pedro Marques, of the Ministry of Labour, M. de Silva, sent by the British Ambassador to help the commission, and also Mr. A. H. M. Thomas, local director of Parana Plantations (Limited), met the commission at the boat. The commission took up its quarters at the Copacabana Palace Hotel for a few days. News had already been received that a press campaign against the Assyrian immigration had been started in Brazil. The chief agents were a society called the “Friends of Alberto Torres Society.” There appears to be, as far as the commission can gather, a movement against the arrival in the country of any more people of Asiatic race. A great many of the articles in the press were extremely ill-informed, and some of the illustrations which appeared were not of Assyrians at all. &lt; . . . The commission therefore, in a consultation at Petropolis with the Bntis Ambassador, Sir William Seeds, K.C.M.G., and the Spanish Ambassador, Dr. Sales, on the 13th February, came to three decisions : First of all, on no account to enter into a counter-campaign in the P 16 ®®- Secondly, to interview such of the Brazilian Government officials who wnuid be concerned with matters connected with immigration; and, tlur y, o ^ vUllGd Ilt5CI W1LI1 IllcLL L/01 b 0OllIlt5O w 1 uxx ^ _ 4-1-*/v out for the personal information of such officials a short aide-memoire o Assyrians. oi tne Labour Ministrv: Dr. Piraia, ot tne uepartmc^ - —Wo wac- cri ven a copy of the aide-memoire, and was shown Assyrian f oPj 6 , f^^eTwell satisfied with the type shown. P Ontheihth February ihe commission were received by Dr. Bandeira de Hello, at one time Brazilian delegate to the League Assembly, and for many years deleeate S the Brazilian Government at the International Labour Conference, and°now one of the directors of the Ministry of Labour. The commission also had an interview with Colonel Fonseca, secretary o the President, to ask him to thank the President for his having decided favourably ° n 'Th^Snm^omS^med by Mr A. H M Thomas, left in the evening for Sao Paulo, arrived on the morning of the 17th February, and put up at the Esplanada Hotel. Pressmen arrived at once for interviews _ F It was known that there was a small Assyrian community m Sao Paulo, and the commission invited their representatives to a conversation n n zj Three Assyrians came to the hotel m response to that invitation. One had never been in the Assyrian country; the other two had left their country some four or five years ago, and were owners of small shops m Sao Paulo. Two were against their people coming to Brazil, because, to use their own words “ Our people, if they come, will die out as a nation.” They could, however, produce no other solution. They seemed to be frightened of the press campaign, and thought that they might suffer if it continued. P It is quite possible that the members of this community may try and persuade their people now in Iraq not to come to Brazil. From now on the commission began to receive offers from landowners, or their agents. . . . Although the commission was sent out with the principal object ot reporting on the offers of Parana Plantations (Limited), it considered it impossible to ignore other proposals which might effect economies. It did not, however, commit itself in any other way. An offer was acknowledged, and the applicant was told that it would be considered, the commission being one of enquiry only, and not empowered to promise or decide anything. As a matter of fact the majority could be dismissed after a short examination as unsuitable for various obvious reasons. One question requiring the closest examination in Brazil is that of title deeds, which the commission had neither the means nor the time to examine thoroughly in every case. To keep in touch with the press agitation while the commission was away in the proposed settlement area, a press-cutting agency was instructed to collect from the papers all references to the Assyrian settlement scheme. The commission occupied Sunday, the 18th February, in interviews with pressmen and people with land for sale, and left Sao Paulo at 7 p.m., arriving at Londrina at 5 p.m. on the 19th February, and established headquarters at the Hotel Luxembergo. Tuesday, the 20th February, was spent in inspecting areas where colonists are already settled, and noting the degree of prosperity which can be reached by a new settler, especially one coming to the country with little or nothing at all. Hence the extremely well-run places of two or three years’ standing were not of such interest to the commission as those which had been in existence for a shorter period, except to show what this land produces in quantity and quality. The places visited by the commission confirmed substantially the 0 P in ^ formed by M. Charles Bedard, in his report of June 1932 in which he says that the success of the scheme depends on the colonists themselves,” since the country is most favourable to settlers, and the settlement schemes well run. As a general rule it was found that a colonist taking on a completely new piece of ground should obtain from his own plantings - Vegetables in two months. Beans in two and a half months. Bice in five months. Maize in four months. Manioc in four and a half months. Taking the average of the settlers, a settler should become self-supporting m eight months, and should pay up all instalments due to the company in five years.saw there The commission next visited the hospital in Londrina ar^ Dr. Muller who has medical charge of the area Generally the area is healthy, but there is malaria on the larger rivers such as the Tibagy and Ivahy, and also m Jatahy village. ’ 1 ]f an area has malaria, the argument is that the malarial mosquito (anopheles) must be there. If Assyrians who are malarial subjects go to the area and are 'bitten by that mosquito they will spread the disease. ^ e ex P laine „ d tila ^ there were four cases of malaria in the area- two which had come up from Santa Catharina were cases of relapse; two others had developed m the Londrina area. This indicated the existence of the anopheles mosquito. However, during the whole of their time in the area, which included seven nights camped m the forest m the rainy season, no single specimen of the anopheles was recognised, although the commission slept without mosquito nets. The list of diseases in the area was examined and gave quite a favourable impression. As soon as arrangements are made for the Assyrians to come, a small hospital should be established in the area with a doctor in charge. Dressers and orderlies may be available from the old levy personnel of the levy hospital and pack ambulance. Statistics of the climate and rainfall are attached^ 1 ) It appeared to the commission that, while there were not the great extremes of heat and cold as m Iraq, there was sufficient change of temperature to make life healthy. From the rain charts and information gathered later from the water distribution of the country, there is no danger of droughts. On Wednesday, the 21st February, the commission left Londrina for the area proposed for Assyrian settlement. The first 33 kilom. were done by car, and then 21 kilom. by mule through forest tracks to a camp formed there, takino: five and a half hours’. Next day, the 22nd February, they marched again by mule, again through the forest tracks, and reached a camp 13 kilom. inside the area proposed for Assyrian settlement. They did not ride straight to the camp, but made several deviations to points within the area, to try to get views over it in order to form m idea of the country. After reaching the camp area two more short expeditions were made to points within the area; eight and a half hours being spent in all on these reconnaissances and the march. The view was very restricted, generally being limited to the next turning m the forest path and a few yards to right and left. In some places, however, a view of as much as a mile could be obtained, when, on the top of a ridge, the ground fell rapidly. In other places, particularly where there were good streams, the local people, called “ caboclos,” had cleared areas a nd planted their own crops, and these areas were continuous in some cases for about half or three-quarters of a mile. Next day, the 23rd February, the commission went across the area, south of die line already traversed, and 3 to 5 kilom. from it. They were able to follow tracks cut by the caboclos and their clearings until the eastern edge of the clearing was reached. From here they followed the track called the Boiadera, along the Assyrian order; as long as time would permit, going south. They returned to the first camp in the forest, having been out for nine and a half hours and covered 40 kilom., all of which, except 3 kilom., were within the ar ea selected for Assyrian settlement. ^ Next day, the 24th February, the commission returned to Londrina. they rjad covered 46^ kilom. within the area designated for the settlement ot the Assyrians, without counting ground gone over twice, and had got a certain number 0 views of the country, and so were able to say that the country seen dinere m no way from the areas already settled on in Londrina area, where the results were 80 good. J t. There was no difficulty, of course, in forming an opinion on the ground ovei yhich the commission had ridden or walked; but, regarding other parts of the r ®a&gt;. they had, in the case where/views could be got, to take e npmion of local people who knew the vegetation and what country that ve s etation covered. o) Not printed. ^ft :: r the The Sy Xer e method of examining the area fully would have been to have paths cut through it w^Xessary to get their/report off wil and since sending in that report, a second visit, wniui iouk ^ u C ,uuu th6 The commission 6 occupied 'the^ 25 th'^Felnmary in visiting the Japanese settle- Ihe commission P i itj Italian, German and Polish settlements. ^H^Th^mosT h?tere^thig^poiSs V1 gathe?ed on these visits were the cases whicii me mosr iiiteico B P w^rTpompq out and really works can make good, showed how quickly a col t tw0 young brothers Ratke a married couple calJGaTsT 'nlle man called Fraeger, all^f which bore out the above Sta “theXrning 0 “the 2^th February the commission had a conference at the Luxembergo Hotel, Londrma, and, after a discussion of the questionnaire, decided kaTenoufh data had been collected to send in a preliminary telegraphic report; thp form of the report was decided on and made out. i . • « It was necessary to see the British and Spanish Ambassadors and to inform them of what the commission had done and what it intended to do next before sending the report off. n Pari ako to be sent in code, for certain reasons.

(d) (e) Before leaving Londrina the commission inspected the death register, having been eighty-two deaths since the formation of Londrina. Of these we ) eight were children, the cause being mainly mal-nutrition. . , 1 i Certain points as regards the health of the country and division ot tne were discussed by the commission with Mr. Thomas. v the The advisability of forming a railhead reception camp, to whic v ^ j Assyrians^go from Jatahy, near the Tibagy River, was discussed, because o reputation of that river for malaria. . , .L e Mr. Thomas pointed out that the camp on top of the hill will pu Assyrians out of reach of malaria. „ Still, the commission feel that if the Assyrians can be transported tiom region of the Tibagy River without delay it will be better. .-i- Mr. Thomas also suggested a scheme for putting a certain number ox iain ^- g together in the clearings, so that they can look after one another while lear g how to fit themselves to go on the land. . ? -jy Another point brought up by the commission was whether an Assyrian a could be settled on a smaller piece of ground to save expense.

On Saturday, the 3rd March, the commission, accompanied by Mr. Thomas interviewed Sr. Ribas, the Interventor of Parana. He was given a copy of the aide-memoire. &amp; fj u± Two Assyrians, who live in Rio de Janeiro, came in the morning to the commission, very much disturbed at the press campaign. Both were well-to-do men, who had been away from their country for many years, they did not however, like the party at Sao Paulo, protest against the coming of their people to Brazil. F 8 In the evening the commission interviewed one Dr. de Souza Araujo, a medical specialist on leprosy, who, on the strength of having travelled from Basra to .Bagdad and thence to Damascus, liad written an article to the papers against the immigration of the Assyrians. It seemed that he drew most of his information from encyclopedias and other works, amd has not, as far as the commission could judge, seen the Assyrians in Iraq and knew practically nothing about them. In the course of conversation with the doctor it seemed very evident to the commission that there is a party formed in Brazil against all Asiatic immigration. It is an unfortunate occurrence that the Assyrians have come into such undue prominence. He made a very strong point that there should be a most careful examination ot the Assyrians by a committee before they came to Brazil. The commission were of course, unable to commit themselves on this point. On Monday, the 5th March, the comm ission visited the office of the Minister ol Labour, Industry and Commerce, and saw there Dr. Vital and Dr. Pedro Marques of that Ministry, and Dr. Piraja, of the Department of Colonisation. . No one seemed very much opposed to the immigration, but no one committed himself to any opinion.' A press correspondent, Mr. Aspinall (Reuter’s agent), called and asked several questions about the Assyrians that evening. On Tuesday, the 6th March, the commission interviewed two of the Parana deputies, General Plinio Tourinho and Dr. Machado Lima, and answered questions put to them concerning the Assyrians. . M. Redard went to see the secretary of the Friends of Alberto Torres Society in the afternoon. He found him in a very excited state, and not inclined to listen 0 anything. This is the society who are very active in all the anti-Assyrian agitation. The commission left in the evening for Sao Paulo. Just before leaving, a elegram was put into the room of one of the commission from the Friends of Alberto Torres. It appeared next day in the newspapers. The attention of the commission was drawn to an announcement in the papers, which appeared among the cuttings, that Dr. Arlindo Carneiro was o ermg some land for the settlement of the Assyrians north of Sao Paulo. As is seemed likely to be a saving in expense, the commission have instituted enquiries into the matter. T j . A further offer of land was received in Sao Paulo from Sr. \az de Oliveira. • ^, s 0 ffer was received as in other cases, only he was asked to furnish some m ormation in case of its being of use. _ . , s+r ti/ 16 commission left Sao Paulo that evening, arriving at Londrma on tne March; Sr. Rossi, an operator with a filming apparatus, accompanied em this time.Npxt dav the commission visited the Japanese settlements, the German ones at Hefm al and th”ech and Novo Vlast for filming. That evening came the cabfe f”om the Committee for the Settlement of th^ Annans of Iraq Geneva, asking for the supplementary report. I his was made out next day and sent off later by ai r “aih March ^ commission left Londrina to inspect another area 18 kilom from the first one seen, for the purpose of settling the Assyrians. Mr. Thomas had already had cutting parties out to enable the commission to Denetrate into the area as far as possible. , ^ i -i o The commission arrived in the middle of the first area, 69 kilom. from Londrina, on the evening of the 11th March, and spent the next day, the 12th March, in a reconnaissance into the new area. , „ 1 , Thev divided into two parties for the purpose and were out for eleven and a half hours Having seen what could be seen by means of new-cut tracks, and bv netting views over it from several points, the commission were able to say with practical certainty that the area was similar in all respects to the first one, the area already colonised. n • „ Films of the area for Assyrian settlement were taken, as well as views on the road and in the forest. . . ^ j T j ■ On Tuesday, the 13th March, the commission returned to Londrina. The 14th was occupied in filming certain of the settled areas near Londrina and on the railway, which is rapidly approaching that place. On the 15th March the commission left Londrina, arriving at bao rauio on the 16th. . , The supplementary report was sent off, with copy of a preliminary report by Mr. Johnson to the Nansen Office, on the technical, administrative and financial aspects of the proposed settlement scheme attached to it. A copy of his full report forms Appendix X.^) , By request of the British Ambassador copies of the supplementary report were sent to him and to the Spanish Ambassador. , The commission left the same evening for Jangada, the settlement of Parana Plantations (Limited), in North-West Sao Paulo, and arrived at Biriguy next afternoon, the 17th March. „ _ _ . They went at once to Guatambu and inspected the lands of the Parana / Plantations (Limited) there. Here/anr 375 families. The commission returned v P to Birigny that night. ^ I The next day, the 18th March, the commission inspected the area proposed lor Assyrian settlement in Jangada, going by car as far as the Rio Feio, which forms the southern boundary of the area, this area consists of 7,000 alqueires of land, On Monday, the 19th March, the commission left Biriguy, arriving at Sao Paulo on Tuesday, the 20th March. , The 21st and the 22nd March were spent in going over the work done, and making a comparison of the Londrina and Jangada areas. „ The commission decided to recommend that the position of the two areas or settlement should be in the lands held by the Parana Plantations (Limited), near Londrina, and a telegram was drafted on those lines and sent through the Britisii consul-general at Sao Paulo. On the 23rd March the commission visited Santos with the object of at the place where the Assyrian immigrants wilPland and be entrained. Tney returned that evening to Sao Paulo. On the 24th March the commission inspected the title-deeds of the Parana j - /) .Pl an t a P° ns (Limited), which Mr. Thomas kindly produced at their request, an ^ ^ ^ /all was found in orden. On the 26th March they left Sao Paulo, arriving at Rio de Janeiro next da}, This completed the work of the commission for which they were sent out. liraHL t, so far M 01 n! that goats ta Assyrian! -\fduralSett Jill It it is qui b to tie area ii [iiflatoalqueii e more e: Milk a settler pie should be pars; but for sport iucludf ppl 6(h) and 1 P the first en m dire [at ley will fli H i 111 Mil tL will! prices. Conclusions of the Commission. In coming to their conclusions the commission followed closely the points m the questionnaire, and from what they have seen their opinion is as follows. I.— Climate. Temperature (a) (5).—-That the temperature, while not running to extremes as in Iraq to which the Assyrians are accustomed, yet has a sutnci variation to be healthy. (b Not printed.Rainfall. That the lainfall is more than in Iraq, and ensures that there are no droughts. II'—Cultivation (details in Appendix IVf 1 )). That the crops most easily cultivated in Parana can be cultivated by the Assyrians. Ill— Cattle and Sheep Raising and Pig Breeding. That a certain number of Assyrians have experience of cattle raising. That practically the whole of the nation are well acquainted with sheep and goat raising. That, so far in Londrina area, sheep raising has only been tried to a limited extent; but that goats are plentiful and do well. That the Assyrians should find no difficulty in pig breeding. IV .—Agricultural Settlement Conditions. (1) That it is quite possible to start with village centres. This applies especially to the area in which the Patriarch will be located. (2) That 5 alqueires per family are sufficient in the first instance. Settlers, as they become more efficient and affluent, may extend their area. Any smaller amount than 5 alqueires, in the first instance, is not advisable. (3) That a settler who already works should become self-supporting on his land in eight months. That he should be able to pay off his instalments, and become self-supporting in five years; but for the Assyrians this should be extended to eight years, and, if transport included, eventually twelve years (see preliminary report, paragraph 6 (b) and II). (4) This is quite possible. Report in full at the end of this report. y.—Other Occupations. That the first endeavour will be to put settlers on the land irrespective of abilities in other directions. That they will first be occupied in gangs under instructors in clearing, road making, house building and planting. That when on their own land an instructional labourer will go round and show them the use of machinery, how to situate farm buildings and how to deal with water. (Note.— The latter is probably not necessary for the Assyrians.) That then outside employment will take place as men show themselves adapted for it, or as they have leisure to do it. VI.— Food. That until the Assyrians are getting food from their own lands thyir ^ ooc | requirements will be supplied by the Nansen Office and can be satistied at reasonable prices. V1T .—Medical A ttention. That satisfactory arrangements for medical attention can be made. That the general health Throughout the area is satisiactory. Vffi .—Relig ion. That there is complete religious freedom throughout the country. IX.— Schools. That Assyrian schools should be established in the area, under arrang between the Nansen Office and the Patriarch.That Portuguese must be taught in those schools The commission went carefully into the matter of paragraph IV (4). Bearing in mind the differences which at present separate the Assyrians, the comiSlion investigated the means of settlement, which gave three possibilities :— m If it is decided to settle the Assyrians in one block, they can be settled in the first area inspected, 66 kilom. south-west of Londrma. If it is decided to settle them in two parties (for reasons given in confidential supplement to this report), then one party preferablyl that which follows the Patriarch, should be settled in the first area, 66 kilom. south-west of Londrina, and the other either (a) Also in the area south-west of Londrina, but 18 kilom. further west than the first party, and separated by 18 kilom. of virgin f or est* or (b) In the lands held by Parana Plantations, called Jangada, 250 kilom. in a straight line north of the first party, or four days by rail and road. Having carefully considered all these points the commission came to these conclusions— (a) That the differences of opinion which at present divide the Assyrians into two parties while in Iraq will tend to disappear once they leave the country. They may not vanish at once, of course, but will in time. Then the people will naturally come together. (b) That, even though one party disagrees with the present policy of the Patriarch, they have never abjured him as head of their people. (c) That the Londrina settlement area is on the whole a better settlement area than the Jangada area. (d) That the expense of settling the Assyrians in the Londrina and Jangada areas will be much more than a settlement in one area only. Therefore the commission are of the opinion that the settlement should be in two parties in the area south of Londrina, separated by the 18 kilom of forest. J. GILBERT BROWNE, Brigadier-General CHS. REDARD. T F. JOHNSON. (Confidential.) Addenda to the Report of the Commission. In making the first telegraphic report on their return to Rio de Janeiro the commission decided that this report should be sent in code for two reasons .— {a) The press campaign was very violent against the settlement, and part of the reason of this campaign was to attack the Government m some way—and this was one. , Therefore, if sent in any way except code, it might accentuate t e press campaign and embarrass the President and the Brazilian Government. (b) If the commission reported personally on the possibilities of settlemen and the Brazilian Government then decided it would not accept ^ Assyrians, the commission felt this might be derogatory to the Leagu of Nations. 2. The reason for the visit to Santos of the commission was partly due to the suggestion that there might be a demonstration against the Assyrians oi arrival there, and to see how trouble could be avoided.the Assyrians.^'rhere'aje'two ' a ^ defi “ te ^age between (a) Those who follow the Patriarch Mar Shimum implicitly, and (b) Those who while still venerating him as Patriarch and head of their people, do not agree with his policy. The differences between the two parties in paragraph (b) are whether the Assynans shall accept the settlement policy of the Iraq Government or not- the Patmrch and those who follow him having set their faces definitely against it while the other party propose to accept it. In addition there is a certain tribal jealousy which has been present for a very long time. J. GILBERT BROWNE, Brigadier-General. CHS. REDARD. T. F.

Since then he had discussed with the •League Secretariat and with the United Kingdom representative what procedure could now most advantageously be followed. He had come to the conclusion that de committee might, in the first place, usefully employ some time in giving sausiaction to the request which the Iraqi representative had made at the last meeting of the committee, in connexion with the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq pending emigration. The Iraqi representative had suggested a message from the committee to the Assyrians. It was difficult for the committee to issue such a message direct, but there seemed no reason why it should not transmit a message otiie Iraqi Government for the latter to communicate to the Assyrians. A draft °1 a letter to the Iraqi representative on these lines had now been drawn up. The president proposed that the present meeting should be devoted to the examination ^is draft and to the examination of various reports received from the Iraqi government regarding the local situation. The Iraqi representative had been jnvited to join the committee at midday, with Major Thomson, and it would then e Possible to discuss with him the proposed message to the Assyrians and any question arising out of the Iraqi Government’s reports. The question of the next ? e P ^ Brazil also remained for consideration, but the president proposed that is should be left to be dealt with at a meeting in the same afternoon. A draft letter to the Iraqi representative and a draft message to the ^ Syrians were then circulated (Annex B( 1 )). ,i The Danish Representative criticised the reference in the first paragraph of cue draft letter to the c ‘ political side ” of the question. It was agreed to substitute e words “ many important aspects.” . the Danish representative further questioned the advisability ot the n erence in the second paragraph to the engagements assumed by the Iraqi government vis-d-vis of the League. He did not desire to dispute that the Iraqi oyernment were under a definite obligation to the League, but he thought that the P lasing was not best calculated to ensure the willing co-operation of the Iraqi government. It was the kind of phrase which might be used if one had reason ° believe that the Government concerned were trying to evade their obligations. ( x ) Not printed. [81 n—1] Bbut credit must be given to the Iraqi Government for having done their best to keep the peace. The President said that he was to some extent in agreement with the Danish representative, as he did not wish to give any offence to the Iraqi Government. At the same time, he thought it was not out of place to call their attention to engagements which they had taken The United Kingdom Representative said that he thought it was possible to lav greater emphasis on the responsibility of the Iraqi Government without using thl phrase to which the Danish representative had raised ob.iection by inverting the order of the draft. Most of the second paragraph might be deleted and a further paragraph added instead at the end of the draft to the effect that the committee wished to point out that the extent to which the Assyrians would be likelv to follow the advice contained in the proposed message would depend chieilv on the measures taken by the Iraqi Government themselves to ensure their security and that the committee, in authorising the communication of the message’ relied implicitly upon the Iraqi Government to take all the necessary steps for the well-being and protection of the Assyrians and for the maintenance of stability and order in the areas where they might reside, until emigration should | be possible. Repmc aft, which lathehims This suggestion was adopted, and the committee proceeded to consider the terms of the message to the Assyrians. The Danish Representative suggested an addition to the last paragraph to the effect that, by carrying on their normal life, the Assyrians would not only not be penalised but would give evidence of their suitability as settlers m the country which might eventually accept them. With this, and one or two formal amend ments, the draft message was accepted. k Some of t, |®, and man pi Hewa Imstracted, ~ — o j- The United Kingdom Representative raised the question whether, when the Iraqi representative appeared at the meeting, the text of the message was to be given to him as something which had already been decided by the committee or as a draft to be considered with him. ip that the li m the Mos 1 i'lii February very n ts or of the It was agreed that the text should be given to the Iraqi representative as a draft and that he should be invited to offer observations on it. ilfflji fibres te light on th The Danish Representative asked whether it was also proposed to discuss in the same way with the Iraqi representative the terms of the letter to be addressed to him. It was agreed that this was unnecessary and might only give the Iraqi repre sentative opportunity to make embarrassing objections, whereas the committee i P J '1 1 Til 1' * l A 1 A A ... -BA -—. I /“VT'-lWl C? 111 was perfectly free to send the Iraqi representative a letter in such terms as it might think fit. It was agreed, however, that the president, in presenting tne text of the message to the Iraqi representative, should accompany it with an ora explanation which would, in fact, express the substance of the proposed letter. The committee then considered Documents C.Min.Ass. /22, 23 and 27. It was agreed that it would be useful to put one or two questions to the Iraqi represen tative on these documents, if only to show that the committee attached importance to them, and scrutinised them closely, and it was decided, in particular, to asK for more precise information regarding the reconstruction of the villages wnicn had been partially or wholly destroyed during the events of last summer, ana regarding the expenses incurred in connexion with the refugee camp at Mosul, since, according to the Iraqi reports, these expenses appeared to fluctuate m a manner which was difficult to understand. i At noon the Iraqi representative, accompanied by Major Thomson, entere the meeting. The President informed him that the committee had attentively examined the reports regarding the local situation in Iraq which he had addressed to it since the last session of the committee in January. There were one or two points on which the committee would be glad of further information. In report (f)’ circl1 lated in C.Min.Ass./22, the statement was made that all villages which were destroyed, wholly or partly, prior to December 1933 had been repaired. Itie committee would be glad to know whether this referred, in fact, to all the villages feeding Meficnir ^ those fij houses com poii of th e3 which had been occupied by the Assyrians prior to the events of last summer or whether it only referred to those villages to which the Assyrians had since returned. It was important for the committee to know whether the villages to which no Assyrians had yet returned had also been repaired and whether there fore, the Assyrians could reasonably be expected to go back there. t it was jn c ^IjjJ' th elect § Tl® |i ’ age wo|| Ivestoett The Iraqi Representative said that the reports which he had passed on to the committee represented the substance of information which he had received from time to time from the Iraqi Government. He assumed that this particular statement was to be taken literally, i.e.&lt; that it referred to all the villages occupied by Assyrians prior to the events of last summer. He was, however, not absolutely certain on the point. The President said that the committee would be glad if details could be obtained. tiers in M wheM The Iraqi Representative drew attention to the fact that in report (c) in C.Min.Ass./27, which was dated February, it was again stated that all the destroyed houses were then being reconstructed. He took this as confirmation of the earlier statement, but he would, of course, try to obtain full information. He stated that he himself had visited a large number of villages before coming to Geneva. Some of them were quite small, consisting perhaps of only half a dozen houses, and many of these small villages had been entirely abandoned by the Assyrians. He was not in a position to say categorically that such villages had been reconstructed. The President said that the committee had also noticed from the reports before them that the Iraqi Government had spent on the feeding of the Assyrians in the Mosul camp £1,809 in December, '£1,458 in January, and only £851 in February. It would interest the committee to know what was the reason for this very marked diminution. Did it involve any alteration of the arrangements or of the numbers of the Assyrians in the camp ? ivethW! The Iraqi Representative suggested that Major Thomson might be able to throw some light on these figures. Major Thomson said that one item by which expenses had been reduced during his absence related to the use of a car which he had for visiting Assyrian villages. In December the cost of transport had probably been rather high, as Major Wilson and himself had been touring the country in order to give enect to the committee’s resolution of the 31st October by explaining the situation to the Assyrians. Moreover, a number of hired tents had been replaced by much better Government tents, and this involved a further reduction of expenditure of about £100 a month. He assumed that these and other items must have been debited to tc feeding the Assyrians,” for the actual cost of feeding came o nothing like the figures mentioned in the reports. He thought that the giacua reduction in those figures must be due to the diminution or disappearance or outside expenses connected with the camp, and he did not think that i imp le any reduction of the money actually spent on the refugees or m the number oi the refugees. ,The President, after thanking Major Thomson for this exp , tninded the Iraqi representative that, at the last meeting w Ay . y tended, the committee had considered the situation of t* 16 i nng the interval which must elapse before emigration could ^ke place p onrrfTAGt.inn that the committee mignt P the Iraqi Government by issuing a message to the ± ssyr • , , t ^ * been made to give effect to this suggestion and a te a xt f Jf. ^ 0 ^ it ^ t he itributed. The committee had thought it well to discuss ntalitv p e iqi representative, as, in the light of his knowledge of say to suniest njd be able to advise on the suitability of the message an P UpWf 0 f the difications. The President wished to emphasise, ow ® 5 , ^ pjqpfly 0 n nmittee, that the success of the action contemplate w iecuritv of the &gt; measures taken by the Iraqi Government to e , ns ^ r a e n ^ ve 7Yn I note to Syrians. It was proposed to send the message, w e PP , i ’ ^ ry we q ^ Iraqi representative, pointing out that the committee could not very wei [81 n—1] Baddress the Assyrians direct, but that it authorised the Iraqi Government to communicate the message to them as embodying the committee s views. In authorising^he communication of the message, however, the committee relied Sicitlv on the Iraqi Government to take all possible measures for the well- b” ng and protection of the Assyrians, and for the maintenance of stability and order in the areas where they resided until settlement took place. The draft message was then distributed. The Iraqi Representative, after examining it with Major Thomson, said that the latter, wL was well acquainted with the psychology of the Assyrians, thought hat the message covered all the points which it was necessary to put to the Assyrians and Ihould have a useful effect. The Iraqi representative, therefore, treed to the message, which the Iraqi Government would probably communicate to the Assyrians through the local committee presided over by Ma 3 or Thomson. The President said that, as regards procedure, the committee would, of course, leave the matter entirely in the hands of the Iraqi Government. The president then asked the Iraqi representative whether he, on his side, wished to raise any questions. The Iraqi Representative said that at the present stage, when matters seemed to be held up by events in Brazil, he had little to say. The Iraqi Government had done everything and were doing everything possible to facilitate the committee’s difficult task, and he hoped that this was realised by the committee. Major Thomson was returning that day to Iraq, and he might possibly be able to offer some useful observations about the future. As for the Iraqi Government, they would continue the measures already taken for the security of the Assyrians. This had, in fact, always been assured since the events of last summer. As regards the refugee camp in Mosul, this would be directed in the sanie way as heretofore, so long as the Brazilian scheme was under discussion. He wished, however, to reserve the right, if the Brazilian scheme broke down, perhaps to make proposals to the committee about the future of the camp. He felt that the question was one which would have to be brought before the committee and iully considered in the eventuality which he contemplated. The President observed that the Iraqi representative had referred to “ events ” in Brazil. To remove any misunderstanding, he wished to make it clear that there had been no ‘ ‘ events ’ ’ there; difficulties had simply arisen owing to opposition, in the press and in certain circles, to Assyrian immigration, hu the committee could not work on the assumption that the Brazilian scheme was going to break down. There was no reason to assume this. Of course, if it did unfortunately break down, the whole situation would naturally have to be reconsidered. At the request of the Iraqi representative, Major Thomson then made certain observations. He stressed the importance of the issue by the committee wiien the time came of a statement in the clearest and simplest language, setting on the conditions of Assyrian emigration. He thought the statement should, m particular, deal with the following points :— (1) Nationality. (2) The fact that land would have to be paid for by the emigrants, either at once or by instalments. ' ,, (3) The fact that those paying at once would obtain their land freeno &gt; and might have other preferential treatment. (4) Freedom of religion. (5) The language question. (6) Schools. (7) Civil rights. Major Thomson also drew attention to the existence of two definite among the Assyrians : those who wished to follow the Mar Shimun, and those who wished to be settled outside his sphere of influence. This was a matter o great importance, and Major Thomson emphasised the necessity of taking i in account when the moment came for the transfer of the Assyrians from Iraq their new home.M&gt; th H*“ tSAi * M “ S 'T' - “ 0 W llle , A&lt;«yr.«i&gt; at the pretent time that two SE‘X toSd k provided m Brazil. There were many difficulties involved. d b General agreement was expressed with this view. / The President then asked the Iraqi delegation to be particularly careful not to give out information to the press on the Assyrian question. The committee was itself exercising the greatest care on this point, as the situation in Bra^l was diffieu and press messages had reached Brazil which had tended to incieaselhe w ' ^ n Tii e m SUSg ? S ffr ° f T the Representative, it was agreed that, before Major T omson left foi Iraq, he should see the acting secretary-general of the Nansen Office to discuss as far as possible the details of transport &amp;c which would arise when emigration took place. The Iraqi Representative then returned to the question of the twofold settlement of the Assyrians. He said that the Iraqi Government considered a double settlement absolutely necessary. They had at first contemplated that one batch o± Assyrians would be settled in one country and a second batch in another. It was admittedly a question of the future, but it was a point which would greatly influence the decision of the Assyrians as to whether or not they should leave Iraq. If they knew they were to be settled in a place under the influence of the Mar Shimun, a great many would not go. It was, in his view, a question of capital importance to tell the Assyrians whether two settlements would be possible or not. The President said that the question would certainly have to be considered, but it did not arise immediately. The Mexican Representative asked Major Thomson whether he thought that the Assyrians would be prepared to accept Brazilian nationality. Major Thomson said that this was a most difficult question, on which he hesitated to express an opinion. They had not been willing to accept Iraqi nationality, and a large number had taken no steps to do so. But if the assumption of Brazilian nationality was a part of the entire scheme and, so to speak, a condition of immigration, he saw no reason why it should prove an obstacle.

Geneva, April 9, 1934. ^OU will recall that at a meeting of the committee for the settlement of the nans of Iraq on the 27th March last I explained to you, + in , m y dent, that, although the committee has now every reason to beheve that in Parana where it is suggested that the Assyrians s on , ble for the purpose, many important aspects °f fdm 1 j j av mU g t ded, and the difficulties involved render it inevitable that some d } 3 before a satisfactory solution can be expected lf . Q i 10ll iu follow bhe committee is naturally anxious to ensure that no i QU ired of you this delay. At the abovimentioned meeti^ measures the Iraqi Government contemplated to 1 ^ ma p e j t it would greatly assist your Government if the coiknown that, in its view, the Assyrians ought, pending emigration, to pursue their normal life and, in particular, to proceed with the cultivation of their lands. The committee is most ready to do what it can to collaborate in this way. As the Assyrians are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Iraqi Government, the committee is scarcely in a position to address a direct message to them. With a view to assisting the Iraqi Government, however, it has drawn up the attached message, which it gladly authorises the Iraqi Government to communicate to the Assyrians as an expression of its views. . , . . , At the same time I desire to point out that the measure m which the Assyrians are likely to respond to the committee’s advice will chiefly depend on the steps taken by the Iraqi Government to ensure their security. In authorising the communication of the enclosed message, therefoie, the committee lelies implicitly upon the Iraqi Government to take all possible measures for the well-being and protection of the Assyrians and for the maintenance of stability and order in the areas where they may reside until emigration shall be possible. I have, &amp;c. LOPEZ OLIVAN, President of the Committee. Message to the Assyrians. The committee appointed by the League of Nations for the resettlement of those Assyrians who may wish to leave Iraq is making every effort to find a suitable home for them outside that country. But the Assyrians must remember that the problem is an exceedingly intricate one and that there are many difficulties to be overcome. Therefore, the finding of a solution which will be acceptable to those concerned may still take some considerable time. Meanwhile, the committee wishes to emphasise most strongly the necessity of the Assyrians in Iraq being patient, and at the same time pursuing their normal methods of life, cultivating their farms, shepherding their flocks, &amp;c. They should not dispose of their household goods, crops or flocks until the question of their future home has been finally decided on, and they are told to do so by the local committee under Major Thomson’s presidency, or by the represen tative of the Nansen Office who is in due course to join that committee. The Assyrians must understand that the fact of their cultivating, shepherding and earning a livelihood will not only in no way be considered by the League Committee as an objection to their emigrating from Iraq, should they wish to do so when the time comes, but will, furthermore, together with their generally leading a normal and law-abiding life, be good evidence of then suitability as settlers in the country that may eventually accept them as immigrants.L/J JAJ AX1U] V KS » . a, »aMC«an«n&gt; ' Communicated to the Members of 1 the Coirimittee for the settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq O.Min/Ass/31 Geneva, April 12th, 1934.

Geneva, March 26, 1934. 'introduction. THE Council of the League, at its meeting on the 19th January, 1934, dopted the report of the Committee for the Settlement of the Assyrians ot Iraq, ated the 10th January, 1934 (document C.69.1934.VII), concerning proposals lade by the Nansen International Office for Refugees for the settlement o ose ^Syrians who might wish to leave Iraq. . . , In that report the committee expressed the opinion that it cqnsi eie ssential to satisfy itself that the lands selected would meet the specia nee s ie Assyrian population by means of a local investigation carried ou y some hh a thorough knowledge of the requirements and P ecl J ia ] rl ^. , apulation in question, and decided to entrust me with the f' 8 ’ T • j [.

[81 c—1] ( x ) Not printed.Accompanied by Mr. Thomas, the director of the company, the commission scent a day on a preliminary inspection of the settlements m the neighbourhood of T ondrina Among others, it had long interviews with German and Japanese settlers most of whom had begun settlement under financial conditions definitely inferior to those contemplated for the Assyrians. In each case the commission satisfied itself that the settlers had not only succeeded in becoming self- supporting; within about eight months of their arrival, but that those who ha I shown moderate initiative and energy, had achieved a modest degree of commission arrived at the unanimous conclusion that the Assynans, given the necessary goodwill, could be satisfactorily settled in the region of Londrina The next step was for the commission to satisfy itself that the conditions obtaining in the area proposed for the settlement of the Assyrians were qrosso modo, similar to those obtaining in the Londrina region. The commission therefore proceeded to the proposed area on the 21st Febrnary. The first 36 Idiom, of the journey were accomplished by motor car, over the company’s existing road and over a new road in course of construction by the company. The remaining 33 kilom. were covered on mule-back through forest tracks, and involved seven and a quarter hours’ actual riding, one night being spent in a temporary forest camp established by the company. In addition, a deviation was made to inspect certain regions in the northern part of the proposed settlement area. x The two next days were spent in the proposed area, and 64 kilom. on mule- back were covered by the commission in various directions over the northern part of the area. This was as much as the existing forest tracks would permit. Various views were, however, obtained of other parts of the area, and information supplied by the company’s survey parties and a local hunter, who stated that he had traversed the whole area, justified the commission in arriving at the reasonable assumption that the whole of the proposed area was, in all respects, similar to the Londrina region. In all, during its first inspection of the proposed Assyrian area, the commission travelled 170 kilom. on mule-back. On its return to Londrina the commission spent three days in inspecting German, Italian and Polish settlements in New Danzig and Roland, where, in the light of its inspection of the proposed Assyrian area, it was able to confirm its first impression that the company’s lands were suitable in all respects for Assyrian settlement. Equipped with this knowledge, the commission drafted its telegraphic report, which it transmitted from Rio de Janeiro on the 3rd March, with the approval of the British and Spanish Ambassadors. The relevant part of that report was as follows :— £t Commission examined area proposed for Assyrian settlement as thoroughly as time at disposal permitted, traversing distance of 64 kilom. along and within northern part of the area. All ground and conditions seen well fitted for Assyrian settlement, and soil of similar quality to that seen in cultivation in about 2,000 hectares of company’s territory. Part of area not seen is virgin forest, and only penetrable with help of parties to cut tracks, who must be paid and two weeks extra required. But infor mation from hunter who has been in area, and according to conclusions drawn by company’s survey parties who have been on edge of area as well as from such limited views as commission could obtain, indicated ground to be of similar quality to that already seen.” In conformity with the request of the Assyrian committee, Mr. Johnson is submitting a short preliminary report to the Nansen Office on certain technical and financial aspects of the plan for the settlement of the Assyrians, with particular reference to Questionnaire No. 2( 2 ), considered by the Assyrian Committee on the 19th January. A copy of that report is annexed. J. GILBERT BROWNE, Brigadier-General. CHS. REDARD. T. F. JOHNSON. ( 2 ) January 23, 1934, Section 3 (Annex I).Note by Brigadier-General Browne. 1. I think the Assyrians should have explained to them that the country they are going to has a climate which does not run to the violent extremes of heat and cold like Iraq. There is a fairly hot summer, and in winter it is often iust freezing. •' There is plenty of rain in the wet season and no danger of droughts The country is well watered, and the water is good and plentiful. There are ew inhabitants of the country, and these are quiet and peaceful people who will keep out of the Assyrians 5 way at first. Later they may trade with them in a small way. The land which they go on will have a motor road into it, and very soon the railway will run down to it, so that the land will become more valuable and marketing easy. There are no plagues in the country, such as the locusts of Iraq. 2. The Assyrians should understand that the country they are going to is in appearance, quite unlike anything they know, being enormous forests of very thick growth. This requires clearing, and they should not attempt to do this without help and supervision in the first place, because they will only lose very valuable timber trees, which will bring them in money, but also they will be liable to have accidents. The land, once cleared, is most wonderfully fertile, and will grow anything which the Assyrians are accustomed to grow. 3. The staple food of the Assyrians is rice in Iraq. This is grown there in water, and is one of the worst causes of the breeding of the Anopheles mosquito, causing malaria. Here the rice is grown on dry land, and is of excellent quality, and grows thicker and more luxuriantly than that grown in Iraq. There may be some difficulty at first in getting the Assyrians to take to maize, rye and manioc, instead of barley and wheat, which they use so much in Iraq. I think it may be necessary at first to purchase barley and wheat for them, and let them attempt to grow the crops to which they are accustomed until they get used to using the other more easily grown food crops. I see a difficulty about tea, if it cannot be provided, not only because it is their habitual beverage, but especially because they are limited to tea and bread only during their fasts of Advent and Lent. Possibly Yerba Mate tea might be accepted as a substitute if the Mar Shimun will give his orders on this matter. 4. Sheep-raising, which is essentially one of the Assyrian activities, is not so developed here, and probably will not be for some years, i.e., until there are large areas of pasture. On the other hand, the climate is quite fit for sheep. There are, however, goats, pigs and cattle here, which are a most successful industry. The Assyrians have large flocks of goats in Iraq, and some have a knowledge of cattle. Pig-breeding will be new to them, but they should take o this without difficulty. „ ^ ^ ^ . 5. Parana Plantations have settled on the area of land for set ei&gt; s T 5 alqueries per family (1 alquerie = 6 acres). This is based on experience. m will be ample for each Assyrian family at the start. I find that m ^ e settlements already established that most settlers have so far ony ceaie a cultivated, on an average, about half the area of 5 alqueries a e . o icm. 6. I find on going round the settlements that (&amp;) A family of settlers averaging five, who really set to work, can e m a position to live on the produce of their land m eig j (b) That, on an average, a settler can pay up the ^ that it is proposed^that n kie°Assyrians skould be advanced the X should be extended a further four years, land for himself, I see no reason why periods These reimbursements might be effected could also be Shimun and the village leaders. Administration of the settlements effected in the same manner. B g [81 c—L] of reimbursement As the Assyrian is keen on owning he should fall behind these7 The Assyrians are accustomed to medical attention, especially the large number who have served in the levies, and for their dependants. Others would come to the Government district medical officers, or, where levy camps were established or levy columns were moving, many of the civilian population would come in for’ advice and treatment from the levy medical officers. There will be a medical centre established m the colony to which the settlers can go and it should reassure the Assyrians that they will get medical treatment, close at hand in the place they are going to. ,, t 8. The Assyrians should have it thoroughly explained to them that there will be no interference with their religion, especially since they are Christians. I found some of the ill-informed criticism was that they were Moslems, and I have endeavoured to remove this idea in interviews and m other ways 9 It will be most necessary for the Assyrian schools to start classes for learning: Portuguese. This will be absolutely indispensable, and I strongly advise that their school-teachers take in hand learning the language now m order to lose no time. This should present no difficulty to people who have in the past mastered up tofive languages. ^ crops and t]ie ma king of mill streams for working crushing machinery is essential, and the streams give every facility for so doing. The Assyrians are'expert at this kind of work. , I 11. There is no malaria in the area where it is proposed to put the Assyrians, nor is the Anopheles mosquito there. Therefore, in about four years all who have the germ should lose it. ^ _ 12. Finally, this whole area is not only capable of development, but is rapidly developing, and it seems to me that the Assyrians, with the qualities they have, will fit in with and help extensively in the development of this country.

In compliance with the request made by the Assyrian Committee for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq, at its meeting on the 19th January, I have the honour to submit a preliminary report on certain financial and technical aspects of the proposals for the settlement of two groups of 10,000 and 5,000 Assyrians on the lands of Parana Plantations (Limited) in North Parana. A similar report on alternative proposals for the settlement of the 5,000 Assyrians on lands owned by the company in the State of Sao Paulo will be submitted after the inspection of those lands. This report is based in general on the preliminary offer made by the company and contained in document P.8.1933 (a) ; the revised offers contained in my record of conversations with General Asquith, of the 9th November, 1933, and in his letter of the 13th November (document C. Min. Ass. 13), and in his subsequent letter of the 30th November (document C. Min. Ass. 14). Detailed comments on the various statements contained in those documents concerning the geneia conditions obtaining in the company’s properties will be made in my main repoi , but for the purposes of this preliminary report it may be assumed that the state ments in question have been found to be substantially accurate. It might perhaps be mentioned in this connexion, however, that during several days spent in JNor Parana, at a time usually regarded as the hottest period of the year, a highei temperature than 32 degrees centigrade was not experienced. On the other han , the statement made in document P.8.1933 (cl) concerning the complete absence o malaria in the company’s territory now requires modification in view of the recen appearance of four cases of this illness. Otherwise the population of the area appears to be singularly free from serious infectious diseases and the genera health good.,g bwm tk Df0 ttM . i J -Possibilities of Successf ul Settlement. Detailed investigation of the experiences of Austrian, German Japanese and Polish settlers, whose periods of occupation of their lands in North Parana varied from eight months to three years, points to the conclusion that given even a moderate display of goodwill, initiative and energy, the Assyrians should become successful settlers in North Parana, should reach the self-supporting; stag’e well ithin the period of nine months contemplated for their support; be able to repay the advances made for their settlement within eight years; and repay the expenses of their transport within a period of a further four years. The fact that settlers without previous agricultural experience, and notably two German brothers of 21 and 20 years of age, one a sailor and the other a bank clerk, have become self- supporting within nine months under financial conditions certainly not superior to those contemplated for the Assyrians, justifies the expectation that even the able-bodied non-agricultural Assyrians should become successful settlers under the proposed settlement scheme. To ensure, however, the successful settlement of the able-bodied non-agricultural categories, and to meet the stipulation concerning their reception made by the Brazilian Government, it would be a wise precaution to arrange that such Assyrians should serve a reasonable apprenticeship with Assyrian agricultural families in Parana before they are definitely allotted their own lands. As regards the prospects of the Assyrians once they have become self- supporting, enquiries regarding marketing possibilities at Sao Paulo, the nearest large population centre, indicate that, after taking into consideration freight charges, their surplus produce should provide them with more than sufficient funds not only to repay the advances made to them, but leave a margin for their economic development. III.—F 'inance and Administration. (a) General. —There are three alternative methods of administering the settlement scheme : (1) By means of a contract with the company for the lump sum of £194,000 (or £204,078) mentioned in the company’s revised offer (document C. Min. Ass. 13). (2) By purchase of the necessary land from the company for £65,000, and the company acting as the agents of the Nansen Office for the settlement work (see alternative offer made by General Asquith in the same document). (3) By the Nansen Office on the lines it has adopted for the settlement of the Armenian refugees in Syria. The following observations are offered on the advantages and disadvantages of the foregoing alternatives :— (1) If the Nansen Office makes a contract with the company for the whole settlement work for a lump sum, it limits its financial liability UI V es f actual expenditure exceeds the contracted sum by 10 per cent., m w ic case the surplus would have to be borne equally by the company an the office. On the other hand, any saving would be similai y me. Such an arrangement would possess certain manifest disa van ages. not the least being the inability of the company, through force its contract. In addition, difficulties migh anse £ to execute its uuntiaut. ah cha^xu-lwxx, . x differences of opinion concerning the interpretation o e At the best, the Nansen Office, whilst shouldering the bility for the successful settlement of the Assyrians, Pa iL r itv /n a representative in Parana in little more than a coHSuitative capac N (2) The main advantages of this arrangement are tha e • £ would be able to benefit from the organisation an f d company, whilst maintaining the effective admims ia c , direction of the settlement work.( 3 ) Such an ar g ^ however, result in failure to secure economies ° Assyrians import duties and on the employment of a cei ain in minor posts. . . f v „„ qPTT ( S ) This direction could probably be arranged by the appointment of a commissioner of . e ’ assis ted by an auditor and a small staff of one or two typis s.* “ i* srrr tzk Syr?a S fo y r\he 0 rett“ment of somTIoflOO Armenian refugees, which y m InaWp the maior portion of the administrative expenses, other Zn hZ of Ae 'commissioner, to be utilised for the employment of Assyrians A somewhat similar system is at present in successful operation, on a small scale, in the German colony, Roland (nea^ Londrina), which enjoys the active assistance and co-operation of he company’s administration. Another probable advantage would be the eventual exemption from taxation and import duties usually accorded to League organisations. The possible disadvantage of the application of this system to the settlement of the Assyrians might be that those employed by the Nansen Office might claim to be treated on the same basis as other League officials, but this difficulty could be overcome by the insertion of a specific clause to the contrary m their contracts. IV.— Eve7itual Economies. After a detailed examination with the local director of the company of the various items of expenditure contained in the company s revised offer, it would seem possible to effect the following economies : Ecctnomyl 1.

Sao Paulo, March 16, 1934. aid lie oj Enclosure 2 in No. 1. ^ote by Brigadier-General Browne respecting Settlement of Assyrians in Parana. {Confidential.) I CONSIDER that Mar Shimun should go across with the first party. Also that he should be allowed by the Iraqi Government to go to the starting-point, and actually get into the first lorry and go with his people. It will not be good enough for him to start from Cyprus and meet them, as they will be very suspicious. 2. As regards the two parties of Assyrians, I believe this will cease when they leave Iraq. It is to a great extent artificial, and really consists of a cleavage between those who agree to fall in with the Government plans of settlement and those who do not. If the difficulties continue up to the time of settlement, I believe that they will disappear out here, so that, if they are settled within reasonable distance of each other, the people will become united. For this reason the commission have selected another possible area close to the first one selected by Parana Plantations, and are investigating it. Status of the A ssyrians. 3. This is a matter we are continually asked about in interviewing Brazilian officials. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sr. Cavalcanti de Lacerda, was particularly strong on it. I stressed this point very strongly in my letter of the 3rd March to the Secretary-General of the League. 4. The press campaign against the Assyrian settlement is continued by the society called “ The Friends of Alberto Torres,” and certainly has an effect on the political atmosphere, and is going to make difficulties in the settlement of the Assyrians. I have already drawn attention to this matter in my letter of the 3rd March. 5-1 have seen document C/Min. Ass./13 of the 18th November, 1933, that mention is made of sending specially selected single men of robust type on ^ the area of settlement.

Enclosure in No. 1. Assyrian Question. Record of the \%th Meeting of the Council Committee held on March 26, at 10-30 a.m. THE President assumed that the members of the committee had read the correspondence which had passed between himself and Brigadier Browne since the last meeting of the committee. When he heard that Brigadier Browne had contemplated leaving Brazil on the 25th March and was only putting off his departure in the expectation of receiving further instructions, he had telegraphed confidentially to the Spanish Ambassador to find out whether the latter considered that the continued presence of the mission in Brazil after the 25th March would be useful or not. He had received a reply to the effect that the mission proposed to leave on the 1st April, unless the Brazilian Minister of Labour asked them to stay longer, and the reply had added that the Spanish and British Ambassadors considered that the mission should leave on that date and that the prolongation ot its stay in Brazil was useless, as the political situation rendered the arrival of tne Assyrians for the moment impossible. (The text of this telegram is attached as Annex A.) Since then a further telegram had been received from Brigadier hrowne (see Annex B) stating that the mission proposed to leave on the 7th April, and asking the President to telegraph if this was agreed. It was, therefore, necessary for the committee in the first place to consider the instructions which snould be sent to Brigadier Browne, and, in the second place, to examine the situation in general, which did not appear favourable. The President understood, however, that the United Kingdom representative had a certain amount of information on the situation in Brazil, which he was prepared to give to the committee. At this point it was announced that Brigadier Browne’s report had arrived, ut that, owing to the necessity of translation and copying, it was unlikely to be ready before the evening. The United Kingdom Representative pointed out that politically Biazil was passing through a somewhat difficult phase. The Government was still a Provisional nn^ »-nr\ ^-p fRo rirwAmm^nt was Acting 1 President only. [81 c—2] Bi&lt; t k 'i * 111* ■ . » * 4 but that the question of the Assyrian s-Lssta-ssuxsa :^*Fu .?= 5 =i Moreover, in the matter of immigration the of mutinous Polish foreign scheme was suspect. Brazilians had had on ® ArV ““Marians' who flatly refused to remain on the colonists for instance ^d of HungananSoW^^ and ^ lamouring for reshipment land and insisted 011f ’ fhif the ignorance which inevitably existed in Brazil home. When one added to this the ignoiance wi ^ ^ n.,..,. .,, 01 . ao tn w u at the Assyrians were and the persistent tendency to confuse them with ^ ‘‘Svrians y ” who were mostly small traders and usurers and corres- nondinglv unpopular, the agitation which had sprung up was scarcely surprising. P Wkh this preface, the United Kingdom representative summarised a number nf rpnorts received from His Majesty’s Ambassador m Rio since the last meeuR the committee, He.gave examples of the P-s campaign which ha LmioH 6 ■I Govern been carried on against Assyrian immigration and read to the committee the substance of a tralquillising communique t issued in the form of a press interview w * the Minister of Labour 5th February. Unfortp&amp;iy, effect the agitation had since been renewed, and was led by a so-called “ learned society” named “The Friends of Alberto Torres, which was strongly Nationalist 'and'apparently not very well informed One of its members, for a This society had published a movement against Assyrian instance, spoke of the Assyrians as Bedouins. manifesto calling on students to oigamse • i* t • •,• ■ immigration, and describing the scheme as “ an imperialist imposition on Brazil ” Immigration was about the same time a good deal discussed in the Constituent Assembly, where the Assyrians themselves had been the subject of unfavourable comment. It was in this atmosphere that Brigadier ro e mission had arrived in Brazil. . x The United Kingdom representative then read out a statement made by me Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 21st February m reply to an interpellation in the Constituent Assembly. (A translation of the statement is attached as Annex C^ 1 )) He pointed out that the statement was no very accurate, but it showed at least that the Brazilian Government had then no intention of giving up the scheme, and the last paragraph was interesting as | showing that they did not contemplate too strict an interpretation of the condition that all the Assyrians should be agriculturalists. This paragraph was, m ac, based on a memorandum which Brigadier Browne had prepared and given the Minister for Foreign Affairs, explaining that the Assyrians were no a agriculturalists, but that most of them who were not followed callings wmc would be useful in developing the proposed colony without interfering with e labour market in Brazil. . . * The position seemed to have changed for the worse at the beginning o March. On the 2nd March His Majesty’s Ambassador had reported a Brigadier Browne’s mission had returned that day to Rio, but that the clue o the Government had, on a plea of pressure of work, refused to grant the ml ^ 0 ^ an audience which had been previously contemplated. The Ambassador ^\ e that there was reason to fear that the anti-Assyrian campaign which was being pursued in the Constituent Assembly was having its effect. The ^P aI | ls , Ambassador had received no official hint, but both he and His Majes Y Ambassador were inclined to think that an attempt might eventually be ma(ie , J the Government to withdraw their previous consent or to postpone immigration. It was possible that the Government would be in a stronge position when the President was definitely elected, but both Ambassadors wei of opinion that for a while it would not do to hurry matters. Meanwhile, e felt that the continued presence of Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson a experts might be useful. Since then there had been further corresponded between the President of the Council Committee and Brigadier Browne anc V Spanish Ambassador regarding the date of the departure of the mission, endi g with the telegram from the Spanish Ambassador of the 21st M arch ^ President had just read out. It was possible that circumstances had c . ar T j since that telegram was despatched, for the United Kingdom representative ^ since derived the impression that His Majesty’s Ambassador was in favour ^ Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson remaining in Rio in the capaci y § mimi jti, He th Ik Browne i liiiii which th :elegi pessimis p, if fnrtht B ransly i as to whet; Ittd Kin (fire whicl !

Whether this move was designed to cover a retreat by the Brazilian Government from the consent which they had already given, or whether it was merely to give time for the agitation to die down was a matter for conjecture. But, coupled with the fact that the Brazilian Government were understood to have given instructions to a representative in Europe to examine the Assyrian question on behalf of the Ministry of Labour, there was at least ground for supposing that the Brazilian Government meant to adhere to their attitude, provided that they could demonstrate to the opposition in Brazil that the objections to receiving the Assyrians were ill-founded. The President thanked the United Kingdom representative for this information. He then said that the first question to be decided was whether Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson should leave Brazil. The latest information which the United Kingdom representative had read out was rather contrary to the telegram of the 21st March from the Spanish Ambassador. He himself was pessimistic about prospects in Brazil, and was inclined to doubt whether the continued presence of the mission served any useful purpose. On the other hand, if further negotiations took place with the Brazilian Government, necessary information might be lacking if Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson had been previously withdrawn, and he would like the opinion of members of the committee as to whether the two experts should return on the 7th April or not. The United Kingdom Representative thought that the answer depended on the procedure which the committee now proposed to adopt. In a telegram addressed to the Brazilian Government on the 16th January the President had foreshadowed that the conditions laid down by the Brazilian Government would be fully examined when Brigadier Browne’s report had been received. In addition, it was necessary, in order that full information regarding the scheme might be put before the Assyrians, to obtain authoritative statements in some form or other from the Brazilian Government regarding the treatment which the Assyrians would receive eventually in Brazil in various matters. No piogiess could, therefore, be made without negotiations with the Brazilian Govei nment on these two points. Brazil seemed the proper place for the negotiations, and the presence of Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson might well be necessary m ie capacity of experts. The President said that two kinds of negotiations might be necessaiT- The brst would be simply designed to find out whether the Brazi lan ° wished to proceed with the scheme or not. The second kind w r ou _ conce ^ I regarding the settlement and future status of the Assyrians. „ e ^ U . ioubted the advisability of commencing at present this second in ^ A vhich was the only one which would necessitate the eonunu p w f ie ther brigadier Browne and Major Johnson.

For that purpose it might be useful for ^rq^ofthmk Tt fohnson to stay fob a while.

It would be necessary to obtain tne ries [81 c—2]This could no doubt be obtained, though naturally the League was strongly in favour of economy if possible. The Danish Representative, while agreeing that economy was very important, ■a also extremely important to obtain a quick solution of the Assyrian question. He thought that ft would be useful to the commission to have further information regarding the situation in Brazil. It might be that the nresent outcry against Assyrian immigration was not a serious issue at all. He recalledprevious case in'Brazil, where the question of the right of inspectors to enter private houses in an anti-malaria campaign had been the subject of great agitation in connexion with an election. Once the election was over the issue was completely forgotten. It was possible that it might be the same with the Assyrian agitation He asked whether information was available as to when the presidential election might be expected to take place and how long the newly- appointed Commission of Enquiry was likely to sit. The United Kingdom Representative regretted that he was not able to give any information on these points. He only knew that the political situation in Brazil was uncertain, and doubted whether anyone could say at present when the presidential election was likely to be held. As to the Commission of Enquiry, his fnly information was that it had been appointed, apparently on or about the OOnrl IVTavnli The President said that, during the time they had spent m Brazil, the members of the mission had time to give ample information to the Spanish and British Ambassadors on points of detail, and he could not believe that the continued presence was really a necessity. The situation m Brazil was more a d more difficult, and he did not see how any progress could be made He suggested that the committee should decide that the mission should return from Brazil on the 7th April. He suggested that it might be advisable for the committee then to consider the situation privately as though not merely the Brazilian pi eject had broken down, but that all alternative schemes had broken down also, tae committee might go on hoping that the Brazilian scheme could still he save that some alternative destination might be found, but he himself was no op on either point, and it seemed to him that the committee should lose no ime considering the possibility of the Assyrians having to remain, after al , m r He considered it most urgent that the committee should consider the ^, A though they had met with a definite check. That would not mean that tne Brazilian scheme would necessarily be dropped. The Ambassadors ir [ ^ 10 c ® u , be left to do what was possible, but his feeling was that at present the e Y en ? resettlement in Iraq of the Assyrians was more important than a mr detailed study of the Brazilian project. He proposed, therefore, that a te , should be sent to Bio agreeing to the return of the mission on the 7th Apri, asking the Ambassadors to continue to do what was possible; and tna committee should then turn to the consideration of the question of the u im settlement of the Assyrians in Iraq. The Danish Representative doubted whether it was wise to let leave. There was insufficient information about the Commission of hnq j which the Brazilian Government had set up. If that commission bad a nee and could be purely objective in its work, it might be advisable to let • Browne leave, but if there were a political element in the commission any ques ^ might be raised. Brigadier Browne was the only authority in Brazil on subject of the Assyrians. As soon as he had left, the Ambassadors would a ^ rely not on his authoritative statements, but on their own influence. nre _ possible that Major Johnson might be spared from Brazil, but the Danis J tentative thought it dangerous to allow Brigadier Browne to leave. As ^ question of expense, he confessed himself unmoved by this consideration, object was to get a solution of the question. I J The President thought that the influence which the Ambassadors cou^ exercise would be more effective than any authoritative stateme Brigadier Browne. No information was available about the length of time eI1 ^ s the Commission of Enquiry might take, and, if Brigadier Browne s mov depended on that commission, he might remain in Brazil indefinitely.5 1 1 •“ ,• ,1 1 • ! • • “ uiic uuminioaiuil LU w not ill carrying through their decision.

The question was a political one. The experts must by now have given all the necessary technical material to the Ambassadors, to whom future action nant in iwI saw no useful purpose in retaining Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson. tbelktkl . United Kingdom Representative regretted that so much pessimism and frazil was* discouragement should have been expressed. He recalled that, when the task of iade, Hesf settling the Assyrians was first entrusted to the Council Committee in October urnfini fh ei *e were people in Geneva who had stated that it would be a three-year thecowll business, and there was some reason to believe that they might be right. After all, the committee had the whole world to search and had no organisation ready to hand. If, after some five months only, a ready-made scheme which it had had n ggy die good fortune to find in the archives of the Nansen Office were to fail, it would be regrettable, but there was no reason to despair. He did not think that the A ^committee was justified in supposing that it must now consider the possibility of 1 d l; Assyrians remaining permanently in Iraq. Indeed, to do so was rather : tl outside its competence. The one task of the committee was to examine the 1 el d practicability of settling the Assyrians outside Iraq. It was true that it was 110 j dj euipowered eventually to consider the resettlement in Iraq of those Assyrians who s:K01 ^h, wished to remain there, but this was quite a different matter from considering the iresen ; wholesale resettlement of the Assyrians in Iraq on the ground that no home else- D ttP where could be found for them. The committee was bound to exhaust all Qi-e,tliat» possibilities of settlement outside Iraq, and, if it failed to find a suitable home for the Assyrians, its only course was to report the fact to the Council, who would ^eii have to consider what further action wms necessary. Even if the Brazilian ion oi scheme broke down, it was much too early to say that there was no alternative. Iu point of fact the committee had not yet made a real effort to find an alternative iiflh' I ^ been unnecessary to do so. They had simply made tentative enquiries ot et0 n various countries.

The Danish Representative agreed that, according to its terms of the committee was bound to supervise the safety of the Assyrians p d emigration, but not to consider their permanent settlement m Iraq, excep case of those who elected of their own free will to stay there. The President said that he had raised this question of the safety ^ Assyrians because Major Thomson was now available in Geneva and was a leave for Iraq. There was agreement that on the following day a meeting should be ca ^^ g which the Iraqi representative and Major Thomson would be invited. meeting it would be explained that, owing to the difficult situation in i there was likely to be some delay before any immigration scheme could be P effect, and that the committee would be glad to be assured that in the me ^ every effort would be made by the Iraqi Government to prevent further breaking out. , ij ^ It was also agreed that a telegram to the Spanish Ambassador s °., drafted by the President and the United Kingdom representative, for cons jj v tion at a meeting later in the day, explaining to the Ambassador that no * the next step would be negotiations with the Brazilian Government, an whether he thought such negotiations feasible and whether, in view o ^ possibility, he wished Brigadier Browne at least, if not Major Johnson stay for the time being in Brazil.

United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, March 31, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Assyrian Question. Uecord of the l%th Meeting of the Council Committee, held on March 26, 1934, at 5 p.m. THE committee had before it a draft telegram to the Spanish Ambassador in Rio, which had been prepared by the President and the United Kingdom representative on the basis of the discussion at the previous meeting. Ihe telegram was eventually approved in the form attached as Annex. Brigadier Browne’s report of the 10th March was then circulated. The President asked whether the committee wished to consider it m detai a is stage, or whether they would prefer to study it at leisure and discuss it la er. The United Kingdom Representative said that a point to.be borne in mind vas that Brigadier Browne had asked by telegram for instructions as o w e e he committee thought that further investigations were required m t e ' trea. If there was a question of the mission returning fiom lazi Th April, a decision on this point was somewhat urgent.

He wondered whether somethin* 3, on this point ought not to be said to Brigadier Browne, and suggested that a reference to the question might even be inserted in the telegram which haf* been approved to the Spanish Ambassador, The United Kingdom Representative explained that reference to this and other questions which would have to be taken up eventually with the Brazilian Government if negotiations were opened had originally been made m the draft of the telegram now approved. These details had, however, been cut out m the interests of economy, more particularly in view of the fact that His Majesty s Embassy in Rio was now in possession of details regarding the present status of the Assyrians which were not available when Brigadier Browne first raised the ifm Iraq i Mir question. Kingdom Representative then explained the present position. exact statistics were probably not available, as the question of nationality had not hitherto arisen in an acute form, it appeared from infor mation available that probably only a minority of the Assyrians m Iraq were technically Iraqi nationals. Those Assyrians with whom the committee was concerned were ex-Ottoman subjects, but it was a fair assumption that they had lost their Turkish nationality in virtue of the Treaty of Lausanne. At all events, it was certain that the Turkish Government would not at this stage recognise them as Turkish nationals. It might be supposed that the Assyrians had automatically acquired Iraqi nationality in view of the provisions of the Iraqi Nationality Law, since all ex-Ottoman subjects habitually resident in Iraq on the 6th August, 1924, were deemed to be Iraqi nationals in virtue of that law, It so happened, however, that most of the Assyrians were not ‘ ‘ habitually resident ’ ’ in Iraq on that date within the meaning of the law, since a large number had returned to Hakkiari between 1921 and 1924, and it was only in September 1924 that they were once more expelled by the Turks, and that the problem of the Assyrians was created once more in Iraq. The United Kingdom Representative was not in a position to say what view the Iraqi Government would take of the matter, but he thought he ought to warn the committee that the Iraqi Government might be within their rights in refusing to recognise a very large proportion of the Assyrians as Iraqi nationals. Out of 20,000 Assyrians it was possible that not more than 8,000 were actually Iraqis, and even this number might be an exaggeration. Moreover, the people who were not Iraqis were the very ones who had never wished to settle down in Iraq, and who had been mainly responsible for the request to the League to find a home elsewhere. The committee might therefore assume that the majority Assyrians for whom they had to provide would probably be Stateless. The position was that they were already refugees in Iraq, and it was simply a problem not of expatriating them, but of transferring them as refugees from one country to another.

Kansas] The President said that the information supplied by the United Kingdom representative vitally affected the question of the responsibility for the repatria tion or resettlement of the Assyrians if they went to Brazil and did not settle down there. The Iraqi Government would, of course, be bound to receive back, j necessary, those of the Assyrians who were genuinely Iraqi nationals, but obvious y might raise difficulties about the rest. -league ilSiii The United Kingdom Representative said that His Majesty’s Governmen had considered this problem with some anxiety, and had come to the conclusion that the best solution would be to arrange, if possible, for the Assyrians who e Iraq to acquire Brazilian nationality at the earliest possible moment, and, preiei- ably, immediately on arrival in Brazil. It was quite clear that in whatever country to which the Assyrians might go they must eventually accept assinula iom They could not hope to go to any modern State and retain indefinitely a sepaia national existence. His Majesty’s Government thought that the best so ^ ltlon work for was that the Assyrians should lose Iraqi nationality, so far as they n possessed it, and acquire Brazilian nationality immediately on arrival m Bra»oftU He No doubt thus would need careful handling, and therp wnnia v , • • difficulties, but His Majesty’s Governinent felt that it „ m ^ be.objectiQns and the simplest and most satisfactory course. If the Assyrian^ be t l” f' e lun S ™n any misapprehension about their national status there 5 r ?“! un( ?® r tue course, u the iissyrians went to any misapprehension about their national status there T . , later. It would be to the advantage of the Brazilian rC Und x t0 be trouble hand, that the nosition should be clelreH „„ G ° ve , r , nment . on the other hand, that the position should be cleared up. It would probably be ^ d the ° thei 'tive convenience to them, and the risk would be diminished of t^A admmist . ra - to maintain a separate national existence. aimmished ° f the Assyrians trying The President said that, while the Droun^rl cnWi™ ! recommend it, he was very doubtful himself 0 P f the possibility oflppMngh H seemed to him to cut entirely across the principle of the freeX^of the individual.

The committee might put it m the form that, if it would help matters, they were ready to tell the Assyrians that one of the conditions must be the acquisition of Brazilian nationality. The President said that in any case he felt that nothing could be done until a reply had been received from the Spanish Ambassador to the telegram which was about to be addressed to him. He did not think that anything on the subject oi national status could usefully be inserted in that telegram. The Mexican Representative thought that the acquisition by the Assyrians of razihan nationality might not be acceptable to the Brazilian Government, as it would thus be impossible for them to send away any of the Assyrians who might not settle in Brazil. The difficulty created by the third Brazilian condition would not be solved. The Danish Representative said that this led him to return to the suggestion Nan^ ^ ma ^ e ear li er by letter that the question of the return clause on ^ ansen passports should be taken up with the Iraqi Government, and that the ocuments relevant to the Nansen passport procedure should be communicated to that Government. The President doubted whether this would be useful at the moment, when it was uncertain whether the Iraqi Government would even agree to the repatriation 0 sllCdl Assyrians as might undoubtedly be Iraqi nationals. Reference was then made to an opinion, dated the 13th March, by the Legal ftion of the League of Nations, regarding the eventual status of the Assyrians wio might emigrate to Brazil. Mr. Walters pointed out that that opinion had been written under a misappre- ension of the actual facts and was based on the supposition that the number of Syrians of Iraqi nationality was much greater than now' appeared to be the case. However, he did not think that that affected the conclusions of the opinion, ft a ^ en ^ e( l t 0 deprecate any attempt to apply the Nansen passport procedure to e Assyrians. Mr. Walters read out the conclusions, which were as follows . To ask Iraq to accept the Nansen arrangements is to ask her to accept uiore than is really necessary for the purpose, because these ai i angemen &gt; a PPty primarily to Armenians and Russians. Iraq may not want to go so iar For practical purposes, if there are Assyrians whom Iraq will not treat as t r n Aa frv iccup them soeciai practical purposes, it mere are 2 vssyrmn&amp; f her nationals, it could be quite well arranged for her to issue them special documents of a to too- n nlnnso authorising return to Iraq, me documents of identity containing a clause authorising return to Iraq. Aansen passport is not the only document which can be used to ena e person without nationality to travel from one country to anothei [81 c -3] B 24 “ In any case any sort of immediate demarche to call the attention of Traa to the Nansen arrangements with a view to her accepting them, would, T think raise the general question in an inconvenient way. It is true that Trao has not had her attention called to those arrangements, which were not sent to her when she entered the League, but it would seem much better to decide (after consultation with Iraq, if necessary) what course ought to be proposed to Iraq and then make a definite proposal. The Danish Representative asked whether the three Brazilian conditions had been communicated to the Iraqi Government, and whether it would be useful to ask the Iraqi Government for definite figures regarding the nationality of the Assyrians. The President explained that particular care had been taken not to communicate the three Brazilian conditions to the Iraqi Government It had simply been explained to the Iraqi delegation that the Brazilian consent was one of principle only, and that various details remained to be discussed. The United Kinqdom Representative doubted whether any useful purpose would be served by asking the Iraqi Government for detailed figures, as it was probable that exact statistics did not exist. While he naturally could not say what line the Iraqi Government would take if the question or providing the Assyrians with a document, which would eventually allow them to return to Iraq, were raised, he felt bound to point out to the committee that it would be asking a oreat deal of the Iraqi Government. The position was, he repeated, that the maiority of the Assyrians were, in fact, Stateless refugees in Iraq. The question of their removal to Brazil had arisen because they declared themselves unable to remain any longer in Iraq. If the Iraqi Government contributed financially to their settlement in Brazil, it was hardly likely that they would willingly agree that they could come back to Iraq at any time if they did not like Brazil. It had been suggested that the proposal which he had made, that they should be invested as soon as possible with Brazilian nationality, would not solve the difficulty created by the third Brazilian condition. That might be the case, but he claimed that a solution of the nationality problem in the manner which he had proposed might facilitate consideration of that condition. In any case, the difficulties created by the condition would equally not be solved by the proposal which had been made for the provision of Nansen passports with a return clause. It was not merely a question of the consent of the Iraqi Government to receiving these people back. The point was, who was going to be responsible for sending them back and, above all, paying for their return journey. The President said that this was a difficult question which he thought the committee would only be able to refer back to the Council for further consideration. The Danish Representative expressed the view that it lay with the Brazilian Government to indicate who must be responsible for resettling the Assyrians outside Brazil, if they did not settle there. The United Kingdom Representative pointed out that the Brazilian Govern ment had so far said that Parana Plantations (Limited) must be responsible, but the responsibility was one which the company clearly could not take. The Danish Representative said that in that case he presumed that the Brazilian Government must hold the Iraqi Government responsible. The President observed that this was a responsibility which the Iraqi Government might not be willing to accept. The United Kingdom Representative said that it was precisely because His Majesty’s Government had foreseen these difficulties which were now being raisea that they had suggested what might seem the rather arbitrary solution of ma . in J&gt; the Assyrians Brazilian nationals as quickly as possible and preferable trom the outset. The Danish Representative suggested that the difficulty might prove hmllv nnt fri Kc o 00™/-vn« i.:__ tj. ^r-r-onged that lUc eventually not to be a serious one in practice.

He thought, however tbaT the I b repatriated or be adjourned until the reply from the Spanish Ambassador waTreTeived M negotiations were possible, the point about nationalitv would W m ^ into very fully m the instructions which would have to be sent out to Rio. b g ° ne Discussion then took place on future procedure, in view of the fact that the reply from the Spanish Ambassador might be delayed owing to the Easter hohday m Brazil. It was suggested that, if the reply was categorical in the sense that Brigadier Browne and Major Johnson ought to return, the President should have discretion to authorise their return without further consulting the bOmmittee, and that he should then convene a meeting to confer with f he mission on their return to Europe^ It was pointed out, however, that, if the mission returned, it would presumably mean that further negotiations were not at present possible, and it was likely that the committee would have to meet at the earliest possible moment to aecide what was to be done in such circumstances. The general reeling was that, while little further progress could be made pending the receipt of the Spanish Ambassador’s reply, the committee should not officially adjourn, but that it should simply be left to the President to call the next meeting when he thought fit. &amp; The question then arose of the situation in Iraq if there was likely to be long delay. The President recalled that Major Thomson was at present in Geneva and was about to return to Iraq. It would be useful if he could attend a meeting at which Brigadier Browne’s report could be considered, with the Iraqi repre sentative and the President of the Nansen Office. It was decided to arrange such a meeting for the following day. It was agreed that the President should then explain to the Iraqi representative that, though Brigadier Browne’s report was favourable, the situation in Brazil was such that some delay in fixing up the details was inevitable, and the committee would be glad to be assured that during the interval everything would be done by the Iraqi Government to ensure the safety and well-being of the Assyrians.

Enclosure in No. 1. Assyrian Question. Record of the 20th Meeting of the Council Committee held on March 27, 1934, at 11 • 15 a.m. THE committee first met in private to decide the question whether Brigadier rowne s leport should be published. The League Secretariat were understood to be m tavour of immediate publication. n hvt 6 Kingdom Representative asked whether it was proposed to pu isn the whole of the non-confidential report, i.e., the covering memorandum gnea by the three members of the mission, the note by Brigadier Browne and the Major Johnson to the president of the Nansen Office. The last of these of ^ cumen t s did not seem entirely suitable for publication, as it was intended a er lor the guidance of the committee and was full of detail, but it was referred o in the covering memorandum. As regards Brigadier Browne’s note, the United ingdom representative thought that there were certain passages which had much e ^ be published at this stage, more particularly the final section of para graph 6, which might arouse the apprehensions of the Brazilian Government as uggestmg an intention to retain a certain autonomy for the Assyrians. There e re perhaps other passages in the note which it might be undesirable to publish, n view of their possible effect on the Assyrians. The only part of the report which seemed suitable for publication at this stage was perhaps the introductory memo- a n U P 1 ’ but even the publication of this might raise false hopes among the vi s « by leading them to believe that the question of their emigration was , 1 r uall y settled. On the whole, therefore, the United Kingdom representative ought publication undesirable at present. The Mexican, French and Italian Representatives expressed agreement. sU ^ an ^ s J l Representative, on the other hand, suggested that publication u d be considered as a means of bringing pressure to bear on the Brazilian bought that it would be useful in preventing delay and bringing sbn m L Zl lan Government into the open, and he suggested that the whole report wiib Polished, but that those portions which might give rise to trouble eThei n i r he Assyrians or with the Brazilian Government should be deleted, and that to h 1 ^ 101 ? should be accompanied by a note indicating that much yet remame e one before the iVssyrians could go to Brazil. U® President thought that the question which the Danish representative had wUn f ? 011 ^ scarcely be considered pending the reply of the Spanish Am ass u oi &gt; ijfni the conimit tee would be better able to judge whether publication would be °r not. His inclination was against publication, without preju ice, ow [81 0—4]mmmgmm PVPV to the further consideration of the question at a later date. He agreed that uublication might give a too optimistic impression and cause misunderstanding ? h r”zr5str,“kSi£ a ^ c-« cju., to the Council, which would explain the whole position. The Danish Representative expressed his readiness not to press the proposal for publication in the circumstances, but to await further information from Brazil He suggested, however, that the attention of the Iraqi delegation, to whom the report had been communicated, should be drawn to the fact that it was to be regarded for the present as confidential. Mr Walters then raised the question of the communication of the report to the Brazilian Government. He thought that immediate communication to that Government was most desirable. jimigiit eoflsi 1 if® refusing to k A somewhat lengthv discussion took place on this point. It was urged by the Danish representative that the adoption of Mr. Walters s suggestion would have the advantage of bringing pressure to bear on the Brazilian Government without he disadvantage of pubfichtion. Moreover if the Brazilian Government were still prepared to proceed with the scheme, the report might help them m dealing with the opposition, and in that case, the sooner it was communicated to them the better. Some members of the committee, on the other hand, felt that com munication was a leap in the dark, and that it would be better before taking any action to await the appreciation of the position for which the Spanish Ambassador was being asked. The communication of the report might then servers a useiiil introduction to negotiations or as a means of eliciting from the Brazilian (iovern- ment a definite reply as to whether they would continue the scheme or not It was pointed out, however, that, as yet at all events, the committee had no official ground for supposing that the Brazilian Government proposed to withdraw trom eir previous attitude; that the closest co-operation with the Brazilian Government was desirable, and that the Brazilian Government, who knew that the report Had been sent to Geneva, might be offended if its communication to them was delayed, particularly if they heard that it had been communicated to the Iraqi Government. The proposal was accordingly made by Mr. Walters that the report should e handed unofficially and confidentially by Brigadier Browne to the Brazilian authorities, Avith whom he had been collaborating. p g t ' The discussion was interrupted at this point by the arrival of the Iraqi representative and the president of the Nansen Office. foia the Me li'to look after m however, c pthe attiti I s He would lit flier of the 5 leit of theft |k|25), ;sai( | f hich the Ira ^ per exchant president the ire; »%saidtl *®tside his i So] The President observed that the Iraqi representative would have seen from the copy communicated to him that Brigadier Browne’s report on the -^ ar ^ area was favourable. At the same time, to avoid any misunderstanding, he ie bound to explain that certain difficulties had arisen in Brazil and there mig therefore be a certain delay before a solution was reached. In the circumstances the committee wished to ask the Iraqi representative to enquire of his Governmen what measures they contemplated for the well-being and protection °1 t ® Assyrians and the maintenance of stability and order until emigration should e possible. i : 3 at all §3 there $( The Iraqi Representative said that on his side he had intended to draw committee’s attention to the difficult situation which might be created if ® were long delay.

A monthly charge of this nature was a heavy burden. If tlie , was likely to persist, he would like to know for his personal information wliel l there was any alternative. The Iraqi Government had made certain P? 0 ™ 1 . and were doing their best, but they felt that their friends were not sufficiently. For instance, no progress had been made with the French Governme regarding the transfer to Syria of the families of those Assyrians wlio n remained m Syria last summer. No reply had been received from the ire Government to a reasonable proposal which had been made about the transte the these families.

Further he anpeaffid to the French Government to help in the matter of the families.

Werner said that he had no observations to make on the report. He felt i rather outside his competence to do so as he did not consider himself as a ecnnical expert. So far as he could judge, however, it seemed to him that the mission had adequately fulfilled its task, and he hoped that the return of vlajor Johnson, at all events, would not be long delayed, as, from the technical R 011 ^ view, there seemed no further reason for him to remain in Brazil, and e JNansen Office was badly in need of his services. d'ffi P^sident then said that the committee sympathised with M.

He referred to the last sentence of naraeraph 3 of Brigadier Browne’s note. The question whether the Assyrians should drink- verba mate tea was, perhaps a trivial point, but it seemed to him that if the Brazilian Government obtained the impression that even a point of this’nature required the Mar Shimun's orders, they might have considerable mis- givings about his position. The French Representative suggested that the best procedure would probably be not merely to delete certain passages in communicating the report to the Brazilian Government, but to ask Brigadier Browne to delete those passages altogether from his report, so that they would also not appear when the report was eventually published. This suggestion was adopted, and i was agreed to send Brigadier Browne a telegram of which the text is annexed. () As the committee was about to rise, a short discussion took place on future procedure. The United Kingdom Representative pointed out that Major Thomson was due to leave for Iraq* on the 30th March. He knew that Major Thomson who, although the servant of the Iraqi Government, regarded himself also as acting to some extent on behalf of the committee, had hoped to be able to return to his duties with some kind of message to the Assyrians, which would have the authority of the committee behind it. The United Kingdom representative asked whether the committee thought it worth while that Major Thomson s departure for Iraq should be postponed, if possible, until the committee could consider the position in Iraq, and particularly the remarks made by Taufig Beg buwaidi on this point, in the light of the Spanish Ambassador’s appreciation of the position m Brazil. It was agreed that it might be a great help eventually if Major Thomson s departure for Iraq could be postponed, and the Tnited Kingdom represen a iv was authorised to arrange this, if possible, on behalf of the committee.

There is little hope of the Assyrians being admitted unless they can he induced to accept assimilation in the Brazilian State and it will he difficult to persuade them to do so. The Brazilian Government have only agreed to accept Assyrians who are agriculturists, hut some Assyrians are ^LsOi 'p purely pastoral and some of the demohilized flying are town-dwellers. Then again there are asveral Assyrians who belong to the anti-Mar Shimun party and would object to being transferred to any country where they would he within the Patriarch/ s sphere of influence (see Flag E). Finally the financial arrangements of the scheme have still to h e settled though it appears that the Iraqi Government is now prepared to make a generous contribution and will not in the last resort allow the scheme to break down for want of money (P.Z.756/34). There is a special financial problem in connexion with the Brazilian Government’s third condition regarding repatriation of Assyrians who fail to adapt themselves to life in Brazil. The final outcome of the settlement scheme will largely depend on the trend of politics and public opinion in Brazil. Meanwhile it seems that measures for the relief and protection of Assyrians in I^a q are being efficiently carried out.

THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit copies of a record of the thirteenth meeting of the Council Committee on the 15th January, respecting the Assyrian question, of which a copy has been sent to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad. United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, January 17, 1933. Enclosure in No. 1. Assyrian Question Record of the Thirteenth Meeting of the Council Committee held at 3-30 p.m. on January 15, 1934. Reply of the Brazilian Government. Dr. Kerno circulated to the committee a copy of the telegram (annex 1) received by the Spanish Government from the Spanish Ambassador in Eio de Janeiro, communicating the reply of the Brazilian Government to the represen tations made by the Spanish Ambassador on the lines proposed at the twelfth meeting of the Council Committee. The President said that the Brazilian Government had informed the Spanish Ambassador that.this was their final reply. Dr. Kerno observed that the committee must present a report to the Council at the present session of that body, and in the report it would be necessary o refer to the Brazilian reply. He asked whether it would be m order o o so on the basis of the message received by the Spanish Government. n The President said that he thought that the message eommunicated J) the Spanish Government, though representing the final attitude o e bovernment, could scarcely be regarded as their official rep y. pn11 fi rTT1 A(i signed communication from that Government and would no ou m writing in due course. Dr. Kerno suggested that in that case it would be advisable to obtain confirmation from the Brazilian Minister at Berne. After some discussion, the President expressed the Minister at advisable for the Secretariat informally to approach e se nse. If, ^erne and to secure from him some official communica . ma k e suc h an however, the Brazilian Minister at Berne was not m ap presented to official communication before the report of the commit e .® , message in he Council, the report would, of course, have to say .simply that^amessag fhe sense of annex 1 had been received from the bpanis w iser to The United Kingdom Representative as ^ e ^A v ^ e -^ e ^ t f m? ] i^ a ble to enter into ecide before pressing for an official reply whether 1 ,. ^ ^rd condition fl F t ^ er ne gotiations with the Brazilian Government r g f ur ther negotiations, which they had laid down. If it were decided to ^'Timid not meanwhile might be an advantage that the Brazilian Government should no [6 t-1] i2 commit themselves to that condition m an official communication. If they did so they rnffilit be the more reluctant to change their attitude The question seemed to be whether further negotiations should take place forthwith or whether they should be postponed until the proposed mission of investigation had been sent out to Brazil and had reported favourably. The President said that in the circumstances the committee had perha; better discuss the substance of the Brazilian reply before considering the pro cedure for getting it confirmed. The reply as a whole was a great advance on the previous attitude of the Brazilian Government. The idea of a trial limit had been entirely abandoned and the Brazilian Government were now prepared to admit all the Assyrians. There were, however, three conditions attached to this. The first two had been anticipated. The third obviously raised a question of some difficulty and he would welcome the observations of the members of the committee on this point. The United Kingdom Representative said that while in London he had seen the chairman of Parana Plantations (Limited), who was aware of the Brazilian reply The chairman of the company, wdiile still prepared to carry out the settle ment of the Assyrians, had made it clear that the company could certainly not accept the third condition laid down by the Brazilian Government, and if the Brazilian Government insisted on maintaining this condition, the only solution seemed to be for the League to assume the ultimate responsibility for repatriating or resettling the Assyrians elsewhere. The United Kingdom Representative thought it was most unfortunate, however, that the third condition should have been laid down in its present form. It had been anticipated that the Brazilian Govern ment would themselves disclaim responsibility for repatriating or resettling the Assyrians if they did not adapt themselves to the country, but this was a very different thing from the positive form in which the condition was now worded. The responsibility was not merely disclaimed on the part of the Brazilian Govern ment, but was definitely laid on another entity, namely, Parana Plantations (Limited). The condition would have a most unfortunate psychological effect on the Assyrians themselves, for they would be certain to regard themselves merely as temporary settlers in Brazil, and whenever things did not appear to be going smoothly they would at once petition the League to be removed elsewiere. Furthermore, the wording of the condition was unfortunate in another, possibly minor, respect. Normally, if the Assyrians went in a body to Brazil and after wards individuals or families who could afford to move elsewhere formed a desire to do so, they would go at their own expense. As the condition was now worded, however, they would be perfectly within their rights in claiming that the company must transfer them at its expense as soon as they expressed a wish to be trans ferred. It would be most unfortunate for these reasons if the Assyrians knew that their settlement in Brazil was subject to the third condition. pii^iiUoUda; lid for whic pi therefore iiission of: Ifadier Bn [ W Kinqa 1 at a pre i’s or the co jrepresentatii ■id foiind tl The President said that he entirely agreed, and had for this reason at once | ^ arranged with the League Secretariat that the Brazilian reply should not be published. It had not so far been published by the League Secretariat, thougn L M. Olivan could not, of course, say whether it had been published in Brazil. ^ Awentobi Continuing, the President wondered whether the responsibility .?J 0!le d repatriating or resettling the Assyrians in certain circumstances was one wnic : Aheash the League could properly accept. It seemed to him that, at all events, it was j outside the competence of the committee to accept such a responsibility on bena ^ of the League. It might be, indeed, that it was outside the competence °i e Council itself and that the matter could only be dealt with by the Assembly. 1^ would mean a very serious delay. He wondered whether the contingency cou ^ not be met by some sort of deposit from the Assyrians themselves, which won Art ij form a kind of fund to be used in case of necessity for their retransfer if t ey .Merer could not adapt themselves to Brazil. ' The Danish Representative said that what was wanted was some form of j^^ion insurance against this contingency. Perhaps some insurance company mig take the risk. Ihe United' Kingdom Representative , returning to the question of procedure, | . Atw suggested that it might be well to leave the third condition for later discussi 1 ^ wi the Brazilian Government, together with other details which would | qa ttitu(i e (l ^ of Hill to be discussed with that Government regarding the status which the Assyrians would enjoy in Brazil. It must be remembered that the Brazilian Government had been approached purely and simply on a point of principle, subject to the later discussion of details. The best procedure at present might be to thank the Brazilian Government for their reply, to recall that the question asked had been simply one of principle, and that before proceeding to a discussion of details the jf mmittee thought that it would be wise to make sure, by sending out a mission of investigation, that the Assyrians were likely to thrive in the area proposed and to become a useful element m Brazil. When the suitability of the area had thus been proved, the Brazilian Government might be in a better frame of miuri to consider the modification of their third condition. sly raj 1 ^ the life le in Lilii s aware of ii ed to carry itij panycoitij Governix dition, Ml isiiityinsc kingdom !■ onditionshii .at the Brail riatin^orEl try, tatir dition was i j af the Brail ly, Parana !i iate psycholfi ■effardtheii' not appear k remold ate in anofc! (dytoBralf sewherefo®' The Danish Representative agreed. He thought that the mention in the third condition laid down by the Brazilian Government, of the possibility that the Assyrians might not adapt themselves to the country led, naturally, to the mission of investigation which it had been proposed to send out. The French Representative also agreed. If the report of the investigation was favourable, the risk involved in accepting the third Brazilian condition would evidently be small. But he thought that the risk of the Assyrians not adapting themselves to Brazil must in any case be allowed for in the final settlement. The President agreed. Even if Brazil had not made the third condition, the point was one for which he thought the committee would have had to provide. He suggested, therefore, that the committee should now consider the question of sending a mission of investigation to Brazil and the connected question of bringing Brigadier Browne to Geneva. He wondered whether this was really necessary. The United Kingdom Representative recalled that, when the question had been discussed at a previous meeting, it had been decided to leave the point for Brigadier Browne’s own decision. The committee had felt that if Brigadier Browne thought a visit to Geneva necessary, then such a visit should be arranged. On the other hand, the committee did not, for reasons of expense, wish to press Brigadier Browne to come to Geneva if he did not think it necessary. The United Kingdom representative said that he had sounded Brigadier Browne while in England, and found that he was strongly of opinion that he ought to be allowed to come to Geneva before proceeding to carry out a task which involved him in considerable responsibility. The President agreed that this was reasonable, and asked Dr. Kerno whether there would be any objection on financial grounds. Dr. Kerno said that he would consult the League Treasury, but anticipated no difficulty. It was agreed that Brigadier Browne should be invited to come to Geneva as soon as possible, and the United Kingdom representative was asked to arrange this. The President observed that the proposal to send Brigadier Browne to nazi d be mentioned in the report to the Council. In fact, m that repor , e cil might be asked to sanction the mission. The United Kingdom Representative recalled that at a previous meeting the dttee had accepted in principle, subject to amendment of detai , a T. ding for Brigadier Browne’s mission to Brazil.

It was agreed that the resolution thus redrafted should be considered by the next meeting of the committee. The President said that as soon as the resolution had been adopted it would be necessary (a) to issue an official invitation to Brigadier Browne; (V) to write to the Swiss Government, asking officially that the services of M Redard should be placed at the disposal of the committee; (c) to arrange with the president of he Nansen Office for the nomination of a representative of that office; (d) to warn the Brazilian Government by telegram of the intention of the committee to send out the investigation. I It was agreed that a draft telegram to the Brazilian Government should be drawn up for consideration at the next meeting. It was suggested that it should thank the Brazilian Government for their reply, while leaving the final decision onen It should stress the importance of a mission of investigation to reassure both the Council Committee and the Brazilian Government themselves that the scheme was likely to prosper, and should express the hope that the Brazilian Government would therefore see no objection to the mission of investigation which the Council Committee would propose to send out subject to a decision on the subject by the Council itself. nidi *' 11 U could have [liffli’s presen Lion b' w ith m, At the s licstmely dill lire uot himsi Jant delegate lliited Kins ive liiittee alone, |M Repm The French Representative asked whether, at the same time, the telegram might not press for official confirmation of the reply received through the Spanish Ambassador at Rio. . .■waryat 1( It was decided, however, that it would be better not to press for any official j 0 f ^ Ira( reply so long as there was any question of endeavouring to induce the Brazilian Government to reconsider the third condition laid down.

The President called attention to a document received from the Nansen Office (Annex 7) regarding a preliminary offer for the 1? ^ Mini Olinn ,, a — y- — settlement of the Assyrians made by a private company in the Argentine. He asKea wneuie committee would wish to examine this offer at the present stage. Personally, feared that it would only cause delay if the committee began negotiations wi the Argentine Government on the basis of this offer and suspended the sc e for settlement in Brazil meanwhile. The United Kingdom Representative recalled that the Argentine Gove ment had already been approached officially by the League Secretariat as a ies of the decisions of the committee at its tenth meeting, and it seemed n to discuss this new scheme until the reply of the Argentine Government ha received and it was known whether that Government was prepared in P rinc P to accept the Assyrians. The French Representative said that the distance of the area proposed, cost of settlement in that area, and the climate seemed very much the same ,. the case of the Parana scheme, and he therefore saw no advantage in SUS P® . j the consideration of the Brazilian scheme while the new offer was being exa I ^ Wr in Nik rN Uitle,er : esofI,S4, V ftkt( 'f the coiiilj q Goveniii It was agreed to keep the offer for further examination if necessarv hnt not to go into it further until the attitude of the Argentine Government tos known. Dr Kerno said that the agent of the company concerned in Switzerland had a film of the colony, which he was prepared to show to the committee if required it nation of Assyrians in Iraq. The President said that two communications from the Iraqi Government had been circulated as C/Mm.Ass./16 and 17. As time was short he proposed that these documents should be considered at a further meeting and he understood that Major Thomson, who had been closely connected with the subject matter of the two documents, had come to Geneva in the capacity of an expert attached to the Iraqi delegation. He thought it would be most useful if the committee could have the opportunity of discussing the documents in Major Thomson’s presence. It would be preferable if this could be arranged in a private session, i.e., without the Iraqi delegate. He suggested that this should be left to the United Kingdom representative to arrange. saving! lent leielii lope that M in of invest™ set to a til the coup The United Kingdom Representative said that he would do his best to arrange this. At the same time, he felt bound to warn the committee that it might be extremely difficult to secure Major Thomson’s presence if the Iraqi delegate were not himself also present. The committee would be aware that a new permanent delegate had been appointed in the person of Taufiq Beg Suwaidi, and the United Kingdom representative had formed the impression that Taufiq Beg would be very reluctant to allow Major Thomson to attend a meeting of the committee alone. The French Representative said that the crucial question was that of money, and he thought that the time had come to address precise enquiries to the Iraqis on this subject. It was arranged that the committee should hold its next private meeting on the 16th January at 10 a.m., and that at 11-30 the representatives of the Nansen Office and of the Iraqi delegation should be invited to attend. The private meeting should be devoted to an examination of the documents referred to above from the Iraqi Government, the question of finance, and the question of the report to be presented to the Council.

In the affirmative, it would be of assistance if the investigator were to indicate in a supplementary l eport any special considerations which in his view, ought to be taken into account in settling the Assyrians. The committee considers that it would be of assistance to the investigator to be accompanied by a diplomatic or consular officer with local knowledge, and, bearing in mind the special qualifications of the counsellor of the Swiss Legation in Rio de Janeiro, decides to request the Swiss Government to be good enough to permit the services of M.

The committee authorises its president to acquaint the Brazilian Government with the proposal to conduct an investigation, and requests the Nansen Office to inform Parana Plantations (Limited) also, in order that the necessary local arrangements may be made.

THE committee had before it the draft of a telegram to the Spanish Ambassador at Rio de Janeiro (Annex 1).0 Rhe President proposed that paragraph 2 of this draft should mention the persons who would collaborate with Brigadier Browne in the capacity of advisers. The French Representative proposed that there should be inserted in the telegram a sentence thanking the Spanish Ambassador at Rio de Janeiro on behalf of the committee for the part which he had played in securing the change of the Brazilian Government’s attitude. The United Kingdom Representative suggested that the first paragraph, which spoke of the committee being convinced that it would be possible to arrive at a complete understanding with the Brazilian Government regarding conditions of settlement, was somewhat too definite. He proposed that the telegram s ou be modified so as to merely express the hope that it would be possible to arrive a a complete understanding. He also suggested that, to make it still more c ear that the committee intended to discuss further the conditions laid down y e Brazilian Government, a phrase should be added to the second paiagrap 0 ^ telegram to the effect that, before proceeding to discuss the ma er m ur detail, the committee thought it best to make sure, by sending out the missio investigation, that the scheme was likely to prove suitable. . The United Kingdom Representative also suggested that it was undesirable m the last paragraph to ask the Brazilian Government definitely for their conse to the despatch of the proposed mission. . , , morip There was general agreement, and, after various suggestions Dr ess the Danish representative proposed that the committee s 011 j? T» r jo. a( ij er Jie hope that the Brazilian Government would facilitate t e c - g Browne and his associates. t &lt;- h The draft telegram, as amended in the above sense and eventua y p 18 stacked as Annex 2.( 1 ) Resolution regarding Mission to Brazil. , r^caaerp • Tk.

The opinion of the y f 1 ) Not printed.that it was not necessary to approach the President of the Council on this matter, and that it was not necessary to make a special request to ^e Council to sanction the expenditure in question. It would be sufficient to embody the resolution in the committee’s report to the Council, and the Council s resolution approving the report would have to contain a sentence authorising the proposed expenditure. Dr Kerno suggested a corresponding amendment to the draft resolution, ar' it was decided that the draft, amended as suggested, should be circulated m due course, but should be regarded forthwith as passed. (The resolution m its final form is attached as Annex 3-)v) The United Kingdom Representative informed the committee that, as authorised at the previous sitting, he had telephoned to Brigadier Browne, and had arranged for him to arrive in Geneva on the morning of Thursday, the 18th January. It seemed ne nksetherepc Situation of Assyrians in Iraq. . ' The President invited the committee to consider what questions if any, arising out of documents C./Min.Ass./16 and 17 it would be advisable to put to Taufiq Beg Suwaidi, the new Iraqi permanent delegate, and to Major Ihomson. The United Kingdom Representative reported that he had seen Taufiq Beg Suwaidi the previous evening and had invited him to meet the committee at 11-30. He had also told him that the committee was glad to learn that Major Ihomson was available, and hoped that Taufiq Beg Suwaidi would place him at its disposal to assist the committee with his knowledge and recent experience of the Assyrians, and particularly of those in the refugee camp m Mosul. Taufiq Beg Suwaidi had at once expressed his willingness to place Major I homson at the disposal ol the committee, but the United Kingdom representative was doubtful whether he would be willing for Major Thomson to attend a meeting of the committee without being also present himself. He suggested, however, that the president should endeavour to get Taufiq Beg Suwaidi to confirm before the committee that Major Thomson’s services were entirely at its disposal. The President said that he proposed to ask Taufiq Beg Suwaidi for further details regarding the situation of the Assyrians in Northern Iraq, and particuiary regarding that of the refugees in the Mosul camp, as the report on the a er subject furnished by the Iraqi Government only covered the period ending e 30th November. The president also asked whether the committee thought opportune that he should ask the Iraqi delegate what financial contribution e Iraqi Government proposed to make. An alternative was to leave the ma e for the report to the Council, so that the Council might put some pressure on e Iraqi Government, which would be more effective than anything which e committee could do. He was rather in favour of leaving the matter for e report of the Council, which would in any case have to touch on the question o finance and appeal for funds from various Governments and private charita e institutions.

Otherwise the settlement scheme might breakjiown and the Assyrian problem would remain unsolved, to the great inconvenience the Iraqi Government, Taufiq Beg Suwaidi had on his side stressed the dimcu J in which the Iraqi Government found themselves in deciding on a definite al ^ ou ^ for their contribution so long as certain details were not yet precisely fixed, would be much better for the Iraqi Government that the number of Assyrians w ^ wished to move should be established and the exact cost of the °P era !i? e ascertained before they suggested to the Iraqi Parliament a definite sum. 1 Iraqi contribution in such circumstances was likely to be bigger than if the Iraq Government were pressed at once to state how much they would contribute. The French Delegate expressed his preference also for leaving the matter to be dealt with in the report to the Council. The committee had been chargeo, the first place, with the task of finding a destination for the Assyrians. P^impar % ^mber of S 3 .JN !U . k? erii k!JHi3 le had sm li the comfc: u that Ipf ila msonattki fthecoiiittf| ; coDuaittethl IS''ft first stage had now, to all intents and purposes, been reached and it must be emphasised to the Council tnat the next step was to decide how the scheme would be financed. The Council, with its authority, ought to recall to the Government of Iraq that, m demanding a substantial contribution, the Council was not asking for a benevolence, but was asking the Iraqi Government to fulfil a responsibility since it was the Iraqi Government which was most closely concerned with the ihiestion. The United Kingdom Representative said that he agreed that it might be left to the Council to bring pressure upon the Iraqis. He thought, however, that the committee ought at least to ask the Iraqi delegate, without’pressing him, whether he was yet in a position to state what his Government were prepared to contribute. It seemed necessary to make this enquiry in order to have something on which to base the report of the Council on this point. The President agreed. He recalled that a letter had already been addressed to the Iraqi delegate on this point and it had so far remained without answer. The best course was to confirm that the Iraqi delegate was still not in a position to give the answer of his Government, and afterwards to point out to the Council the necessity of bringing pressure to bear on that Government. Dr. Kerno, with reference to document C./Min.Ass./16, observed that it embodied a report by Major Thomson which covered only the period up to the 30th November last. Later information, however, had been received from the Mar Shimun in the form of the petition of the 11th January, which had been circulated as C./Min.Ass./19. The President said that the Mar Shimun had recently been to see him. The Patriarch had complained of the composition of the local committee in Iraq and had alleged that it could not possibly be impartial. He had also emphasised the sufferings which his people in Iraq were still undergoing. In fact, he had said that they were being massacred, though he had corrected himself to the extent of saying that it was not by the sword but by starvation and destitution. The president had informed the Mar Shimun, with regard to the first point, that the committee had done its best, but the Mar Shimun must remember that it was dealing with the Government of an independent country, a member of the league of Nations, and could not therefore impose conditions upon that Government. It was a question of mutual arrangement. The said he had purposely not entered into the second point raised by e Mar Shimun. It was desirable not to give the Patriarch the status ot a par y to the dispute, and to treat him as a Government. He had made it clear e could not discuss the allegations made by the Mar Shimun (which a een couched in exaggerated language), but could only listen to them. He m pom ec out, however, that it was always open to him to address a letter ^ e AH Committee. The letter of the 14th January (see Annex 4 (1)), of which the Mai Shimun had sent copies to the various members of the committee, supp g his petition of the 11th January, was no doubt the result. Dr. Kerno said that the Mar Shimun had also been to see him and had sp ^ 111 the same sense as to the president. He had particula 1 y i cou ^ not procedure contemplated in Iraq was not satisfactory.

The President asked whether the committee thought it useful to consider the possibility of sending the Nansen representative to Iraq at an earlier stage than had so far been contemplated. Dr Kerno pointed out that under the resolution of the 31st October it was provided that the Nansen representative should only go to Iraq as soon as possible after the place of settlement had been definitely fixed. The French Representative said that he thought that under the terms of the resolution of the 31st October the Nansen representative could not be sent to Iraq at least until Brigadier Browne’s report of his mission to Brazil had been received The United Kingdom Representative recalled that the resolution of the 31st October had been prepared by negotiation with the Iraqi Governmen an if it was proposed to depart from its terms, such departure could only be by agreement with the Iraqi Government. Whether it was necessary foi the committee to seek that agreement was for decision There certainy disquieting reports about the state of the Assyrians m the i 1 * 01 *! • &gt; the first place, the refugee camp in Mosul, and it would be necessary for committee to satisfy themselves by questioning Major Thomson that condition in this camp were satisfactory. In addition, there were a good many Assyrians who had left their villages and flocked into Mosul outside the refugee camp bo far as his information 'went, the United Kingdom representative said that did not understand these refugees to be at present m a state of actual destitute , though obviouslv their conditions might be better. He understood that they were being lodged and kept by the Assyrians permanently resident in Mosul, but me was always a chance of this system breaking down if the refugees insisted on remaining in Mosul indefinitely and refused to go back to their villages, alleged that their reluctance to return to the villages was due to unsatistacioi) arrangements by the Iraqi Government for their security and to msu payment of compensation. That was one side of the question. On the o ei it was alleged that the Assyrians in Mosul were themselves chiefly to biam their present condition, and that their refusal to go back to their vil a S es ' simply due to the fact that they had got it into their heads that they were transferred almost immediately and were waiting for something to be cue them. It was desirable to question the Iraqi delegate on this point, and i I? be necessary, at some stage, to urge the Iraqi Government to do e ^ er y possible to arrange for the Assyrians to return to their villages in securi y a compensate them for losses. The President recalled that in his letter of the 14th January the Mai Shimun had suggested the despatch to Iraq of a mission from the Inteina Red Cross Society 7- to relieve distress.

On the whole he was 0 HP 0b T ra( q this step, which he thought might create serious difficulties with ^ e Government. The United Kingdom Representative expressed the view that the ( ; onl , p eve should act very cautiously in this matter.

There was little doubt that a large number ot the Assyrians at all events were simply hopino- that if they made enough of their difficulties, a camp would be provided for them him the one in which they had lived for some four years after the war at Baquba The United Kingdom representative suggested that for these reasons the (jpnmittee ought to hear what Major Thomson had to say before proceedino- any farther. ' ° 1 It was decided to proceed accordingly. The committee then considered document C./Min.Ass./17. The President pointed out that in paragraph 6 of that document the attention of the Council Committee was drawn to four categories of Assyrians whose treatment would require special consideration. The president recalled that the questions raised had been already considered to some extent by the committee, and the most difficult seemed to be the category of non-agriculturalists. He thought, however, that the treatment of this category would eventually solve itself. When a nucleus of agriculturalists had been settled in Brazil, they would create new wants and new employment, which might dispose of those Assyrians now in Iraq who followed some employment other than agriculture. It was agreed to leave consideration of these four categories for the time being, but to ask the Iraqi delegation for further particulars regarding the numbers of each category if possible. The United Kingdom Representative pointed out that there was the question raised by paragraph 5 of the document under consideration. That paragraph recommended that two places of settlement should be found. The United Kingdom representative suggested that the committee could hardly do anything but proceed on the line which they had been following. Their task had been to find a single area large enough to accommodate all the Assyrians in Iraq if they wished to leave. Once the area had been found, the scheme could be submitted to the Assyrians, and those who wished to take advantage of it (presumably the Mar Sliinuii and his followers) would do so. The most urgent part of the question would then be solved. It was just possible, in any case, that if a single scheme were put before the Assyrians, and it were clear that no alternative was in sight, those who did not follow the Mar Shimun might decide after all to make the best of it and accept it. If, however, as feared by the Iraqi Government, they too v the line that they still wished to leave Iraq, but could not follow the Mar Shimun, then it would be for the Council Committee to try to find a second area. The Danish Representative noted that the document referred to the impossibility of certain Assvrians going to a place under the influence o e Mar Shimun. He did not think that the committee could concern itselt with questions of this sort. It was natural, of course, that the committee s on as c the Brazilian Government to give the Assyrians the right to follow their religion, but to get for the Mar Shimun the full powers which he claimed over is was not the task of the committee; nor was it its task to divide t e o owe the Mar Shimnn from the rest. .

At the previous meeting, Dr. Kerno had distributed a rough preliminary rlraft of a report from the committee to the Council and the committee now J deeded to consider this draft. A number of amendments were suggested and h was eventually decided to set up a drafting committee to prepare the report, the drafting committee to consist of the president, the United Kingdom. Freer and ^“^\[® i J^f a e f t h t e n e suspended for a few minutes and was resumed on the arrival of the Iraqi permanent delegate accompanied by Major Thomson and M Shabandar and of the President and Secretary-General of the Nansen Office. The President, after welcoming the Iraqi delegate, explamed generally the present position of the question. He emphasised the difficulty which the committee had encountered in finding a suitable destination for the Assyrians. In the present economic condition of most countries this was inevitable. The committee had, however, recently learned that, subject to the discussion of details, the Brazilian Government were disposed to accept all the Assyrians at the rate of 500 families a month, as and when they could be accommodated by Parana Plantations (Limited). The committee now proposed to send out a mission to Brazil to make sure that the area proposed was likely to suit the Assyrians The president explained the composition of the mission. He then referred to the reports which the Iraqi Government had furnished on the refugee camp at Mosul and the measures taken for the security of the Assyrians, the relief of destitution and the repair of villages. He asked if the Iraqi delegate could supplemen these reports with any later details regarding the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq.

He was glad to hear officially that a destination had been practically found. As to the nomination of Brigade Browne, he also appreciated this. Brigadier Browne had commanded the levies in Iraq and the knowledge which he had acquired of the Assyrians would certamy facilitate his task in Brazil. As to the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq, the committee had no doubt been sufficiently informed by the reports fum by the Iraqi Government, and he had nothing to add to those reports, position remained unchanged. To return to the question of settlemen , i 0 j remained to await the report of Brigadier Browne before ascertaining number of Assyrians who would wish to leave Iraq.

The Iraoi Government would tultil this declaration with the best will They would how ‘ever, be taking considerable responsibility in promising in ‘ advance any particular contribution, since Governments were likely to fall and to be replaced The Iraqi Government were unanimous in their readiness to liquidate the affair Zid to facilitate the operation of settlement. There was no change since Yasin Pasha’s declaration. The President took note of this declaration, of which he expressed appre ciation. He then proceeded to discuss Document C./Min.Ass./17, paragraphs 5 and 6. He reserved the right of the committee to reply direct to the Iraqi Government on the points raised in this paragraph, but as regards paragraph 6 lie would like to know whether the figures of the various categories were to be found in the reports which Major Thomson had made. Major Thomson said that he had no precise figures of the various categories. The points mentioned in paragraph 6 of the document were points which he and the local committee had felt ought to be discussed before the Nansen representa tive went out to Iraq if there was not to be delay. The President said that the committee would appreciate precise figures if that were possible. Major Thomson promised as soon as he returned to Iraq to get the necessary figures. The President then asked the president of the Nansen Committee whether he was now in a position to nominate the representative of the Nansen Office who would accompany Brigadier Browne on his mission to Brazil. Brigadier Browne was due to arrive in Geneva almost immediately, and it was desirable that he should be able to consult with the Nansen representative who would collaborate with him and arrange to travel out with him. M. Werner said that he had not been present at the meeting of the Council Committee at which Brigadier Browne had been chosen. He had intended to appoint Major Johnson as the Nansen Office representative, and he would still be inclined to do so, but he wished first to ask whether the question of nationality was not an obstacle. Was it desirable that the mission should consist of two British subjects ? The President said that the Council had already considered this question and kit that nationality was no obstacle. These two British subjects would go out as servants of the League. M. Werner said that in that case he would nominate Major Johnson and the Nansen Office would pay Major Johnson’s expenses. He would eventually get this decision confirmed by the managing board of the Nansen Office, but meanw i e would take full responsibility for it. The President then asked the Iraqi representative whether he desired to make an y comments. The Iraqi Representative said that, d propos of the question of finance, he noted that a resolution passed by the Council Committee on the 3 s c 0 e ' nad provided that the local committee in Iraq, in collaboration wi . a r fF- u tatrve of the Nansen Office, should examine the question of f] 16 P 9 . 1 C1U \\ ( ' lr , Pie Assyrians themselves in the cost of settlement. He felt that there si an obligatory contribution to the initial expenses from those Assyrram afford to pay. He said that the Assyrians had a considerable amount of proper y ^ the shape of herds, land, &amp;c., and he suggested that they should be dmd^ ™ te g° ries ’ according to their ability to pay T e rust e g ^ t _ ory Be obliged to pay in ^n^Le-half of the estimated cost, the -end calory should pay one-third, the third one-fourth, while the f ^ rtl , ca ^.. d y to pay consist of those Assyrians who had no means, who cou n “ t . Ui mose Assyrians who Had no means, vv^ -—y of a nything, and to whom it might even be necessary to gran ^ some certain percentage of the ultimate cost, say, 10 per cent, or ^ Pf-^ ression that c erne of this sort were not adopted and the Assyrians L i d gay that he W could, if thev wished, go free to Brazil, every one of them would say Was insolvent. ' ’ &amp;The second point which the Iraqi representative wished to make was that it seemed unnecessary to await the report of Brigadier Browne regarding Brazil before sending a representative of the INansen Office to Iiaq to make preliminary arrangements of the type which he had suggested. The President said that the committee would consider the suggestion which the Iraqi representative had made regarding an obligatory contribution from f Assvrians according to their means. He suggested it would be preferable, however if the Iraqi representative would put his suggestion into writing. The second point regarding the despatch of the Nansen representative to Iraq was o-overned by the committee’s resolution of the 31st October. The committee had, m fact, discussed the advisability of sending out a Nansen representative at an earlier stage than had been contemplated in that resolution, but thought it best to wait Now however, that the earlier despatch of the Nansen representative had been proposed by the Iraqi representative, the committee would, of course, reconsider the matter. The president added that the committee was veiy glad that JVlajoi Ihomsoii was present, and he was sure that the committee would like to have information from Mai or’Thomson, who, with his special knowledge of the Assyrians, could be of great assistance. He therefore asked the Iraqi representative to place Major Thomson at the disposal of the committee. The Iraqi Representative said that he gladly agreed. M. Werner said that, if it was proposed to send a Nansen representative to Iraq, he would like the matter to be arranged quickly before Major Johnson went to Brazil, as he would require Major Johnson’s advice and help m making the necessary arrangements.

United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, January 21, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Assyrian Question. Record of the Fifteenth Meeting of the Council Committee at 4 p.m. January 17, 1934. on THE committee met first in private, and with particular reference to Ue communications from the Iraqi Government contained in Documents C/Min.Ass./16 and C/Min.Ass./17, and to the Mar Shimun’s letter in document C/Min.Ass./.19, decided on the questions to be put to the Iraqi repre sentative, who with Major Thomson joined the meeting at 5 p.m. The President then recalled to the Iraqi delegate that the committee had a double task. Its first duty was to arrange for the resettlement of the Assyrians outside Iraq, but in addition to this the Council had entrusted it with the out} of receiving reports from the Iraqi Government regarding the measures taken to ensure the security of the Assyrians, to relieve those rendered destitute y the events of last August and to repair the villages partially or wholly oes roye during the same events. It had taken note of the report furnished by t e raqi Government of the 21st December (Document C/Min.Ass./16). In anticipation pi the report which it would have to furnish to the Council and a a pG a / hs own conscience, the committee desired to ask certain questions an o o an supplementary details. In the first place, the committee ia 110 e , Major Thomson’s report, which the Iraqi Government had enc ose , * lor the period up to the 30th November last. It would be of interest to k whether there were any modifications since that date. The Iraqi Delegate said that he would ask Major Thomson to reply question. Major Thomson said that he had later information, which /it 6 January Mm since his departure from Iraq, though it only went up ° * certain Gp to that date there were in the camp 1,505 men, women an c . ^ enc j number had left to join their friends outside. From the 21st December to tke °f the year, one man and twelve children had died. ocked whether In response to a question by the Danish represen a * ’ ga ij that the his rate of mortality was not alarmingly high, Major f o u 0W i n p- whooping heaths of the children were due to bronchial pneumon S lveg ^ugh, and were attributable entirely to the negligence of the mothers tn who refused to let their children remain in hospital m Mosul. i 6 BThe President referred to a phrase in paragraph 3 of the Iraqi report which referred to the general improvement in the situation. He asked whether this improvement referred to security or to health. Maior Thomson said that questions of security and police measures were not within his competence, and he must ask the Iraqi delegate to reply to this point. The Iraqi Deleqate regretted that he also was not in a position to reply to this particular question, or to explain details regarding pohce measures. The report had been prepared just after he had left Iraq on his way to Europe. He could of course refer the president’s question to the Iraqi Government, but himself read the phrase in question as meaning that, after the events of last summer, a certain tension had naturally existed, but that lately the feeling of security had improved. The President noted that Major Thomson’s report stated that it had been found necessary to admit into the refugee camp at Mosul some seventy men, who were destitute through blindness, paralysis, loss of limbs or old age The committee would be glad to, know why it had been necessary to admit this class of person to the camp, and whether it was suitable that they should be there. Major Thomson explained that the men m question were living with their families in villages and had been supported by those families. He had bound them destitute in Dohuk or A1 Qosh and unable to support themselves. For the sake of humanity, therefore, he had taken them into the camp, which had been primarily intended for women and children. They had, m fact, nowhere else to go. The President observed that if the Assyrians were settled outside Iraq, the case of these people, who were not physically fit to emigrate, would natural y arise. What did the Iraqi Government propose to do about this? The Iraqi Delegate said that unfortunately Iraq suffered from a lack of charitable institutions. An institution for the reception of people who were physically incapacitated was, in fact, being built in the neighbourhood o Mosul, and, if it were ready in time, the men in question could, he imagined, admitted there. He submitted, however, that the question was a secondary one. as when emigration took place these men would either accompany their fannies or would have to be treated in the same way as other indigent persons. The President said that the number of houses and tents in the refugee camp in Mosul seemed somewhat small for the large number of people to e accommodated. Was there not over-crowding? Major Thomson explained that the camp was composed partly of houses and partly of double-fly tents holding 23 to 25 people each. Inside each tent he da made the refugees build mud walls 2 feet high, which prevented the wind from coming in. There was in addition a large church tent, and he had starte a school there for the children. There was also an ablution tent with as muc hot water as was required for baths ,1 into tie mat tie presid read hofthe Ass itlejwould i Iwii lad si lie question ilat infant i id to about 10 m suspicioi kyrians enp b of dispensa psfaf the plated as Doc pervations pious to the ffletelv false n ,na W 1,500 » The; P® would. y^er to qi CL! a b es ar The United Kingdom Representative pressed the question of over -crowding- Was not the number of persons per tent excessive? Major Thomson replied that the truth was that the families refused to split up. If he tried to diminish the number in a tent they refused to sep^ 8 ^ and, if removed, went back again. He was convinced, however, that the c ^ )I l (ilt101 ^ were not unhealthy, and as an interesting example he said that there had been a outbreak of diphtheria. There had been twelve cases among the children, but disease had been stamped out in fifteen days. The Danish Representative noted that the number of deaths up to the 30th November was stated in Major Thomson’s report as seventy Was not tms very high percentage? ?Mat)o tt 20 l Brit Major Thomson admitted that the number seemed alarming, but it was in fact excessive. Some 2,000 persons had passed through the camp, ana ^ deaths mostly occurred among children who were in a very weak condition St,being admitted Most of them had been young children, nursed by their mothers who themselves had been in want of food for several days. It was a particularlv hot time of the year, and a great many of the children who came in were in such a condition that he personally had never thought they would live Many of them had, however, survived and they had all received every attention He thought f- that the death-rate, if compared with that in the poor quarters in European towns, would not compare badly. 1 The President said that the committee would be glad to have some assurance regarding the future that the Iraqi Government would pay particular attention to the needs of the destitute Assyrians. The Iraqi Ref resent alive said that before his departure from Bagdad, he had gone into the matter thoroughly and he would of course transmit to his Government the president’s request. He could, however, say that the Iraqi Government were ready to maintain the refugee camp until the settlement operation had been finished and would be particularly careful in the matter of the security of the Assyrians and the health of those in the camp. Generally speaking, they would receive as good treatment as the rest of the population. Major Thomson had shown that conditions in the camp were favourable and in regard to the question of the Danish representative regarding mortality, he had to admit that infant mortality as a whole in Iraq was very high. In fact it amounted to about 40 per cent, over the whole country, generally because the mothers were suspicious of new forms of treatment. He pointed out, however, that the Assyrians enjoyed equal facilities with the other inhabitants of Iraq in the matter of dispensaries, &amp;c. The President then referred to the petition from the Mar Shimun which had been circulated as Document C/Min. Ass./19. The committee would be glad to hear any observations which the Iraqi representative might wish to make on this petition. The Iraqi Representative recalled that the Mar Shimun had now addressed many petitions to the League, and all of them contained many allegations which were completely false. The Iraqi Government had had to point this out. 1 he present petition was no exception. It contained many falsehoods. He would only take two examples, namely, the figures quoted regarding the refugees in the Mosul camp and those who had taken refuge in Mosul outside the camp. Mar Shimun said that there were 3,000 persons in the refugee camp. In fact, there were only 1,500. The total of 4,000 for the other category was also about twice too high. 1 The Mar Shimun was, in fact, always quoting unchecked figures^ His petition would, of course, be sent to the Iraqi Government for detai e observations. In answer to questions regarding those Assyrians alleged to be es i ii e outside the refugee camp, Major Thomson said that these were P e0 P ® ^ ^ eft their villages and flocked into Mosul, where they had joined their . J iel J A these people numbered about 2,000, whereas the permanent Assyrians iesi tfosul numbered about 1,000. Major Thomson had himself seen the P e0 P ® J no lad come in from the villages and who were living on the permanen res - they refused to go back to their villages. The Iraqi Govemmen ^ ^finite offer to the inhabitants of the Shaikhan area, where, a aoug 'een no massacres, the villages had been looted by the Arabs after the massa^ 1 Simel. The people in this area had retired to A1 Qosh with a g P P ^ 1 their flocks and personal property. They had, of course, een g cr0 p S beir crops. A British officer had since assessed the quantities o &amp; those who Mt m the villages, and the Iraqi Government had promise cessarv f or fould return to the villages, they would give as much gi am as j lin tp nltivation, in addition to sufficient grain to maintain the P er ‘ s , rflouMis and resh crops were grown.

The Iraqi Government had paid all the m ,, jj e was asked, and if conditions were unsatisfactory, he himself was • h ha( j sure that the Iraqi Government, if necessary would ^Syrians as already done. He was, however, against any form of treating fo Ur years destitute. The Assyrians were fond of being refugees. They ha ^indan. at Baquba, and there had been, after that, another refugee camp at They had, therefore, to some extent, a refugee complex. The Iraqi Delegate said that he was sure that the Iraqi Government keep conditions satisfactory pending settlement. There was one P oin trans fer not so far been touched on to which he would like to refer; that was , ^ to Syria of the families of certain Assyrians who were now m py ria - , ha( j been negotiations with the French Government, and the P &gt;rvmTTmI1 icated received a reply, the substance of which he understood had been c rpfl( iy to to the Council Committee. In principle, the French Governmen w e ^ ne( j accept the families, but one thing remained to be settled, ana QP ttiement finance. The Iraqi Government had estimated that the question o p renc j 1 might take six months to arrange. They had therefore proposed t a _ , tk Government should take the familiies for six months against a P a y on their Iraqi Government of a lump sum of £1,400.

If the French Government would aTree to take the families at once they could be transferred at once and after six month! 8 the question would be again discussed if the families had not by that time been if, transferred elsewhere under a different scheme of settlement. The French Representative said that the Syrian budget was not supported by the French Government, but by local taxpayers. The French authorities in Syria were, therefore, very anxious about the prospective burden on the budget. J Th e Ir aqi Representative said that he fully realised this but the Iraqi a Government were offering to pay expenses and to consider the matter further if (i necessary, after six months. The French Representative said that he had no mandate to deal with this question, but he would transmit to his Government, for consideration, the suggestion that an arrangement should be made for six months, subiect to reconsideration of the position, if necessary, at the end of that time. lie The Iraqi Representative said that the Iraqi Government had supposed that there was no need for any arrangement longer than six months. They had taken what they thought would be the maximum period. He was, for his part, ready, however, to put to the Iraqi Government the same suggestion as the French representative had offered to put to his Government. , Ihe President concluded the meeting by taking formal note of the assurances weresatisfe which he understood the Iraqi representative to have given during the course of the meeting:— (1) That the Iraqi Government would maintain the refugee camp until the completion of the operation of settlement; (2) That they would, in general, treat the Assyrians in the same manner and with the same care as the rest of the population ; and (3) That they would pay particular attention to security and health. tflunatetyr l that » Iraqi (k' CIt ' noneyfor*- was to : ve more W mating tW 1 bev Geneva, January 17, 1934.

[E 515/1/93] No. 1. Assyrian Question. Record of the Sixteenth Meeting of the Council Committee at 5 p.m. on January 18, 1934 .—{Received in Foreign Office, January 23.) THIS meeting was called to adopt the draft report to the Council prepared by the Drafting Committee. The President explained that the Drafting Committee had not been able to complete the report on the previous day, as there was one point which the United Kingdom representative had felt bound to refer to higher authority. The point referred to the question of finance. In the draft considered by the Drafting Committee it had been proposed, after drawing the Council’s attention to the urgency of the question of finance and to the prospect of obtaining contri butions from the Iraqi Government and the Assyrians themselves, merely to suggest to the Council the advisability of an appeal on humanitarian grounds to Governments and charitable institutions to make up whatever balance might be required. The United Kingdom representative had, however, drawn attention to the declaration which he had made to the committee on the attitude of the United Kingdom Government, namely, that the United Kingdom Government were prepared to pay their share of the League contribution, but could only contemplate payment as part of a League scheme. The United Kingdom repre sentative had felt it necessary that this question of a League contribution should be dealt with and he had proposed that after the recommendation to the Counci to issue an appeal to Governments and private institutions, a paragraph shou be inserted in the report drawing attention to the attitude of the United King om Government. Other members of the Drafting Committee had felt that o mser a paragraph to the effect that one Government, and that a Governmen closely interested in the question, would only contribute on condition na a e other members of the League also contributed, would not fit in very we recommendation for an appeal by the Council. It would, m fac , give a P P unnecessarily discouraging impression of the chances of such an a PP®^ was quite clear that a League contribution was impracticab e. o , United Kingdom representative was perfectly entitled, if e ’ pprta j n a reference to his declaration inserted in the report, bu m ia an members of the Drafting Committee had felt that the paragraph re rt ar g appeal by the Council had better be omitted. o L, af ] now The President understood that the United Kingdom re P ® referred the matter to the Secretary of State for Foreign The United Kingdom Representative said that this wa8 . 8&lt; ^; ^ q Ue stion of State for Foreign Affairs approved his at p h t y UnReTKingdom representative oi a League contribution should be faced.

THIS meeting was attended by Major Johnson, and its object was to decide the points to be discussed with Brigadier-General Browne. The President first informed the committee that he had just received a tele gram from the Spanish Ambassador in Rio in reply to the telegram despatched as a result of the committee’s fourteenth meeting on the 16th January. The reply was to the effect that the Brazilian Government would facilitate the work of the proposed mission. As this information had come too late for inclusion in the myyorteur’s report, which had already been circulated, the president proposed that the rapporteur should inform the Council orally after the presentation of his report. The president then explained that Major Johnson had been asked to attend this preliminary meeting in order to advise the committee on the scope of the proposed enquiry in Brazil before the committee met Brigadier Browne. The president observed that the resolution passed by the committee left considerable liberty to the investigators. Major Johnson thanked the committee for giving him this opportunity for consultation, and he would like, in the first place, to have more precise information as to his own functions in the investigation. When the Nansen Office had first submitted the plan for settlement in Brazil, it had done so with the stipulation that it could not accept responsibility for carrying out this plan without a previous opportunity of examining on the spot its financial and technical aspec s. G the Council’s resolution this procedure appeared to have been somew ia reversed. Nothing was, in fact, said about the Nansen representative examining the technical and financial aspects of the proposals, but the whole to be limited to ascertaining whether the area proposed was sui a e Assyrians.

The United Kingdom Representative pointed out that the passage in the committee’s resolution of the 31st October, to which reference had been made, after deciding in principle to entrust the work of settlement to the Nansen Officii: under conditions to be laid down, asked the Nansen Office in the meantime, with out commitment, to continue its study of the Brazilian scheme. He thought that Mai or Johnson’s mission to Brazil followed naturally from this request. It was the president of the Nansen Office who had suggested that a representative of the office should accompany the investigator chosen by the Council Committee to Brazil at the expense of the Nansen Office. It was, therefore, natural that Major Johnson should take the opportunity to make all enquiries on the spot which his office thought necessary. The committee then considered the points to be discussed with Bi igadier Browne. For this purpose Major Johnson had drawn up two memoranda (Annexes 1 and 2). The first consisted of a list of points which he thought it mmht be advisable for Brigadier Browne to consider before making his report to the &amp; committee. The second contained a list of questions which would have to be considered later, assuming Brigadier Browne s report to be favourable.

It was first necessary to await the reply of the Argentine Government as to their willingness in principle to accept the Assyrians. Until the consent of the .Argentine Government had been obtained, it would perhaps be a waste of time to consider settlement in that country. Some discussion then took place as to the precise role of the mission of investigation. Was it competent, for instance, to take up questions concernmg religion and schools (see points 8 and 9 of Annex 1) ? It was eventually decme that the role of the mission, pending further instructions, should be one of enquiry only. It would not have power to engage in negotiations. Subsequently, negotia tions with the Brazilian Government would be necessary, and the most appropna channel would no doubt be the Spanish Ambassador in Rio, assisted perhaps di the British Ambassador. It might be advisable that Brigadier Browne an Major Johnson should be available to help the Ambassadors in the course of tneir 1A system, negotiations. This was a point to be decided later. It was agreed, however, utlanns that it would be desirable for the mission to establish contact with the wo be ffif Embassies at the outset, and be placed in touch by the Spanish Embassy with sue | ;netb ei]111 p Brazilian authorities as might seem necessary.

At the request of the French representative, Dr. Kerno was instructed to record m a note, to be circulated to the committee, the above request, and the understanding of the committee that any settlement scheme for the Assyrians in Iraq should apply also to those who were now refugees in Syria. The question of sending the Nansen Office representative to Iraq at an earlier stage than had been contemplated by the committee’s resolution of the 31st October was also considered. Some apprehension was expressed lest this should complicate rather than help matters, although the advantage of having a Nansen Office representative at the earliest possible moment in Iraq was realised. It was proposed that discretion should be left with the president to arrange for the immediate despatch of a Nansen Office representative to Iraq as soon as Brigadier Browne’s report was received, if that report were favourable. It was eventually decided, however, that, as the question was a difficult one, and as the committee would almost certainly have to meet in any case, immediately after the receipt of Brigadier Browne’s report, to consider the many details which remained to be discussed with the Brazilian Government, the question of sending' a Nansen Office representative to Iraq might be left over for the moment, in case the president felt it better that it should be considered by the committee as a whole. Brigadier Browne then returned and made various observations on or Johnson’s memoranda. As regards cultivation, he said that the Assyrians were great rice growers, and it was to that fact that was due the great prevalence of malaria among them. He proposed to enquire into the possibility of dry rice cultivation in Brazil. Many of the Assyrians were dependent on sheep farming. He understood that His had not yet been tried on the Parana lands, and he proposed to investigate Ihe possibilities. As regards method of settlement, the Assyrians were used to living in villages of fifteen to twenty houses, and he thought it would be better to maintain this system. One of the great difficulties which he foresaw was m connexion with arms. The Assyrians possessed when he was last in Iraq some 6,000 rifles, and he thought it would be a matter of the utmost difficulty to indue e them to give them up. The United Kingdom Representative pointed out that, according to the latest figures supplied by the Iraqi Government, the number of rifles m tne possession of the Assyrians had dwindled greatly since the events cd as ' and perhaps it might be possible to arrange for the disarmament of e ssyr if as soo n as they got over the Iraqi frontier.

Extract from the Minutes of the Fourth Meeting, held on January 19 at Geneva.—(Received in Foreign Office, January 23, 1934.) table TEWFIQ BEG AL SG WAIDI, representative of Iraq, came to the Council s enquiry toil the Nfflil M. de Madariaga presented the following report and draft resolution :— My colleagues on the Council will certainly have studied with great interest the report which has been submitted to us by the Committee for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq (see Annex). The mass settlement of a large population living in rather special conditions is proving to be a difficult matter in the present economic state of the world. The committee’s tireless efforts enable us, however, to anticipate a satisfactory solution of the problem in the near future. The Council will, in the first place, wish to signify its profound gratitude to the Brazilian Government for its generous offer to throw open its territory to the population in question. It will rely on the committee to pursue its negotiations with the Brazilian Government in order to fix all the details connected with the carrying-out of the proposed plan. cc The Council will also note with satisfaction that the committee proposes to create a local body in Iraq to ensure the proper carrying-out of all the operations which will be necessary on the spot. In the same way, the despatch of Brigadier-General Browne to Brazil, assisted by M. Bedard and Mr. Johnson, is a mark of the committee’s desire not to take a final decision concerning the place of settlement until after an independent and impartial enquiry has been made. . u C£ The committee specially draws the Council’s attention to the dimcu problem of financing the plan. The Council will be glad to note the laqi Government’s reiterated statements that it is prepared to make as geneious a contribution as its resources will permit. There can, indeed, be no ou that the Iraqi Government’s contribution will be the most important tactoi in the success of any emigration plan. Moreover,^the Council^ agree to authorise the committee to study carefully the ques ion payment of part of the expenditure by the Assyrian population i se ^ ‘ £ As regards the financing of the plan by a contribution rom .

The committee also reports the conversations i has had in this connexion with the Iraqi delegate and with Major Thomson. “ The rapporteur draws the Council’s attention to the assurances given to the committee by the Iraqi representative regarding the situation of the Assyrians. “ I beg to move the following resolution :— &lt;c ‘ The Council, “ c Approves the report of the committee and the present report; ‘ ‘ ‘ Instructs the committee to continue its work in conformity with the Council resolution of the 14th October, 1933, and with the committee's report^ “ c Cordially thanks the Government of Brazil for its decision to admit the Assyrian population to its territory; . . - cc 4 Firmly trusts that the Government of Iraq will contribute in the largest measure that its resources will permit to the financing of the scheme, in accordance with the reiterated declarations of its representatives; ‘ 44 4 Is equally convinced that that Government will not fail to protect and aid the Assyrian population, in conformity with the declarations of its representatives in the committee; 4 4 4 Appeals to the generosity of Governments and private organisa tions to consider participating in the financing of the scheme, having regard more especially to its humanitarian aspect; .21 4 4 4 Authorises the Secretary-General to take, in conformity with article 33 (2) of the Financial Regulations, a sum not exceeding 20,000 Swiss francs from the item 44 Working Capital Fund ” to cover the cost of the investigation in Brazil, apart from the expenses of the expert nominated by the president of the Nansen Office. These expenses will be reimbursed to the League out of the funds that will be available for financing the projected action as a whole.’ ” The rapporteur added that, according to his information, the Brazilian Government had notified the Spanish Ambassador at Rio de Janeiro that it would assent to the despatch of the mission, mentioned in the report, to investigate the prospect of settling emigrants. Tewfiq Beg Al Suwaidi, representative of Iraq, stated, on behalf of Jus Government, that he greatly appreciated the work done by the rapporteur, the chairman and the members of the Council Committee, between last October ana the present date. Referring to the declaration made to the Council by his predecessor, Yassin Pasha Al Hashimi, on the 14th October, 1933, he was glad to say that his Government still remained firmly attached to the spirit of tia declaration as to the successful issue of the Assyrian problem. Sir John Simon felt that the report which the representative of Spain had been able to make, including the information on certain quite recent communica tions and decisions, was more hopeful and constructive than might, a shoit iin previously, have seemed possible. There were those who deplored the fact it had not been possible to make more rapid progress in this urgent ques ion But the fact that it had not been possible to do more in the space of three mon would, he thought, surprise only those who did not appreciate the difficulties wi which the Council Committee had had to contend. It had been faced wi problem which was quite unprecedented in modern times—nothing less than organised transfer of a large part of a people from one part of the woi another. It had therefore had to explore a wide field of possibilities, td world was wide, and at the outset none of those possibilities offered any o standing likelihood of proving practicable. But, in spite of the dimcuinc - considerable progress appeared to have been made, and he felt that the owed a debt of sincere gratitude to the Council Committee and to representative of Spain for the efforts which they had made. f 9 &gt;* ittee sei guested, in of the Ass ^practicable t any steps ■ wd execut ■«cil was le tie protectic at stated tha ^permitted |H as its re m and tl &gt;M]3 66 8U Wts|| ^easurcsti; ld ^li| ffi i ®i|j itlir ,ke. in d un not exisj il Funrf d e expenses w e, These eif ; lat willhes® ir;r,“ t^/zr^s ,ta.d b, » w d., to .tot h, ..Old call .to Mpf.1 ” 'a?4 h 2 A Brazilian Government had received the representations made to it on humani tamn grounds on behalf of the Council Committee.

In conclusion he would repeat his expression of gratification that, as a result of the strenuous efforts which had been made by the Council Committee and its chairman, there was so much hope of a solution of this problem. The draft resolution was adopted. Tewfiq Beg A1 Suwaidi withdrew. Iraq fil«| ’mil to tic ka ted dedaati' nt will lot il withtletil [E 514/1/93] Annex. Report by the Committee of the Council. (Translation.) THE committee set up by the Council at its meeting on the 14th October, 1933, was requested, in the first place, to consider to what extent a solution of the problem of the Assyrians of Iraq by means of their settlement outside the country was practicable, and, if so, to take, in close collaboration with the Iraqi Government, any steps which it might deem to be appropriate with a view to the preparation and execution of a detailed plan of settlement. The Council was led to consider such a solution, which doubtless exceeds the scope of the protection of minorities, because it was faced with a wholly exceptional situation, and the necessity for such a solution appears to have been recognised both by the Iraqi Government and the minority concerned. The Iraqi Government stated that it was prepared to make as generous a contribution as ks resources permitted to facilitate the settlement of the Assyrians outside its territory, but, as its representative informed the Council, “ there was one thing k could not do, and that was to find land.” It therefore appealed to the League lor assistance in this matter. It was in these circumstances that the committee of the Council was set up. ine latter set to work as soon as the Council’s last session had ended. It has oeen obliged to remain in more or less permanent session, since the task entrusted fo it by the Council has turned out to be a particularly arduous and difficult one, mainly on account of the extremely unfavourable economic and social conditions obtaining at the present time in every country in the world. The committee desired to satisfy itself in the first place that any plan o settlement which it might draw up would apply solely to those per sons . w -° ^pressed a desire to leave Iraq. In order that this emigration might be entire y voluntary, the committee, which was anxious to obtain the desirable guaran ees M this matter, accordingly entered into negotiations with the Iraqi Governmen with a view to the constitution of a local organisation. . + n n The committee’s resolution dealing with this question is attache Present report (Annex l).( x ) The local commission appointed by the Iraq overnment has as its chairman Major Thomson, an expert m . questions, and its members consist of officials of that Goyernmen an , m en of the Assyrian villages.

The committee accordingly got into touch witi . ^ States which appeared to offer certain immigration P^f ^^^dered it present difficult conditions of world economy. The committee also considered4 essential to enlist at the outset of its work the assistance of the Nansen Office for Refugees, which has for many years closely investigated the possibilities which mmht exist for the settlement of Russian and Armenian refugees. In agreement with the committee, the Nansen Office approached several large colonisation companies, and in particular the Parana Plantations (Limited), which owns vast tracts of land in the State of Parana in Northern Brazil. This company submitted a plan of settlement, which was sufficiently comprehensive to include the whole population which might desire to emigrate As this was a scheme for the colonisation of Brazilian territory, the committee asked the Government of that country whether it would be prepared to authorise the entry into, and settlement on, its territory of the Assyrian population. The Brazilian Government informed the chairman of the committee on the 9th January, 1934, that it was prepared to accept the whole of the Assyrians in groups of 500 families a month, as and when the Parana Plantations (Limited) was able to provide for their settlement. iitfcpso a? 'fk Assyrian po dieie ^ 81 , ill outset ,iiiiitir«tii ioi by tno k obtainef Mfious intern Before more fully into the conditions of this settlement with the Brazilian Government, the committee considered it essential to satisfy itself that the lands selected would meet the special needs of the Assyrian population by means of a local investigation carried out by someone with a thorough knowledge of the require ments and peculiarities of the population in question. It proposes to entrust this task to Brigadier-General Browne, who is of British nationality and has resided for a very long time in Iraq, where he was in close contact with the Assyrians. Brigadier-General Browne would be assisted by M. Redard, counsellor of the Swiss Legation at Rio de Janeiro, who has been resident in Brazil for some twenty years, and by Mr. Johnson, secretary-general of the Nansen Office. The text of the resolution adopted by the committee in regard to the enquiry in Brazil is attached to the present report (Annex 2).( 1 ) As soon as Brigadier-General Browne has formed his own opinion, and if this is favourable, a representative of the Nansen Office may proceed to Iraq to carry out, in conjunction with the local commission, the mission entrusted to it, and first of all to draw up a list of persons desirous of leaving the country. The committee has not lost sight of the importance of this question, but it did not consider it possible to arrange for this enquiry until it was in a position to propose to the Assyrian population a definite destination and to give it a general idea of the conditions of settlement. The committee would repeat that it has so far not been possible for it finally to accept the Brazilian colonisation scheme or to discuss all the details ol execution which will necessarily arise, but it has received certain favourable information which leads it to hope that it will be possible to carry out this scheme satisfactorily. Nevertheless, whatever scheme is finally adopted, its execution will necessarily depend on the financial resources available. The committee therefore ventures to draw the Council’s attention to the importance and urgency of tms question. If it is postponed until the Council’s next session it will be impossible to carry out the proposed scheme during the present year. It will not be possible to calculate the exact expenditure involved until the final destination and the number of persons to be transported are known. As an indication, the committee would mention that, according to the rough provisiona titfould beeo: going $0 kunanit! calculations made by the Parana Plantations (Limited) and the Nansen the total cost of settlement in Brazil (cost of transport, purchase of land settlement, food for the first three months, &amp;c.) would amount, for 5,000 persons, to £162,000 (£32 per head), for 10,000 to £314,000 (£31 85 . per head) and tor 15,000 to £465,000 (£31 per head). Ever since it began its work the committee has been considering w a possibilities there were of obtaining the necessary funds. It was with that 0 jew that it reminded the representative of Iraq of his statement to the Council a n last session that “ the Iraqi Government was prepared to make its contribu 101 &gt; as generous a contribution as its resources permitted.” The committee is a PP) to be able to inform the Council that at its meeting on the 16th Januaiy ^ representative of Iraq again confirmed his statements, and assured the commi that the question of Iraq’s contribution would be settled with all due spee soon as the destination was definitely fixed and the number of persons to be e with had been ascertained by enquiry in Iraq.

The committee proposes to go carefully into thk question at its later meetings. It would point out here and now, hoLver thlt such participation by the Assyrians themselves cannot be contemplated unless , guarantees can be obtained that the Assyrians will be able to dispose of their property in Iraq at reasonable prices. Such an operation will necessarily involve active and generous intervention on the part of the Irani Government 1. 8 hmld the fund f supplied by the Iraqi Government and the Assyrians Drove inadequate, it would become necessary to seek other sources As the problem presents certain humanitarian aspects which would probably arouse a more general interest, the Council might appeal to the generosity of Governments and certain private organisations to supply the missing funds.' In this connexion the committee draws the attention of the Council to the fact that the representative of the United Kingdom Government has informed the committee that his Government is willing to pay its share of a League contribution, though it can only contemplate payment as part of a League scheme. Being of opinion that the question of a possible League contribution exceeds its province, the committee submits that question to the consideration of the Council. In its resolution of thf 14th October, 1933, the Council expressed the hope that the Iraqi Government would be good enough to keep the committee regularly informed of the measures taken to ensure the safety of the Assyrians in Iraq, to assist the families left destitute and to rebuild those villages which had been wholly or partly destroyed. The committee has the honour to submit to the Council as an annex a report which it has received from the Iraqi Government on this subject (Annex Sj.f 1 ) Regarding that report, the committee has had the opportunity of a long- conversation with the representative of Iraq, who was assisted by Major Thomson. L has obtained certain additional information and details regarding the position of the Assyrians who are in the Mosul camp, in the villages and outside the Mosul camp, The representative of Iraq assured the committee (a) that his Government would maintain the Mosul camp until the scheme had been completely carried out; (b) that it would give the entire Assyrian population the same treatment a od the same care as the rest of the population of the country; (c) that it would P a } r special attention to safety and hygiene. wing tie si jiiestioD, m t was ia 3 f- andtopifi f 1 ) Not printed. oIn any further communication on this subject, please quote No - SUr'it. \\\&lt;V2. and address— no? to any person by name, but to— ‘The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i I p p 4 THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith copu^o of the under-mentioned paper.

In view of urgency of matter, Rapporteur recommended Council to fall hack on Committee’s suggestion of an appeal to governments and private organisations, and expressed hope that if such a procedure wore adopted certain governments might he able to con sider the problem from a new aspect, particularly in view of its taanitarian character.

As I have already informed you ve rbally , Naji Beg has instructed the mutessarif, Mosul, to issue sufficient rifles to the Assyrians for then se - protection, provided that it is done in a manner which will not excite pu ic criticism.

IN accordance with your letter of the 21st November, 1933, appointing me president of the local committee for dealing with the evacuation of Assyrians from Iraq, the committee proceeded on the 28th November to Dohuk. We interviewed Mar Serkis, the mukhtars and chief men of all Assyrian villages in Dohuk Qadha, explained to them the terms of the decision of the League of Nations and distributed to them copies of the decision and also the statement of the committee. On the 29th November we saw Mar Yawalahah and the mukhtars and chief men of the Assyrian villages in Amadiah Qadha. On the 1st December the committee proceeded to El Qosh, and there saw the mukhtars and chief men of the Assyrian villages of Shaikhan Qadha. On the 4th December we visited Aqra, and there saw the mukhtars and chief men of the Assyrian villages in Aqra Qadha and Zaibar (Nahla area). The absolute necessity of all Assyrians cultivating this winter was impressed on all mukhtars, and those in Amadia, Aqra and Zaibar were willing to do so. In Shaikhan and Dohuk they were not willing to do so, pleading lack of public security and want of rifles. The committee are strongly of opinion that sufficient rifles should be returned to all the Assyrian villages in Shaikhan, Aqra and Zaibar. It is understood that the Amadia villages retain their rifles. It is considered that it is only by the return of rifles to villages that a feeling ot confidence and trust in Government can be properly restored. Anangements could be made for mukhtars of villages to be responsible for rifles returned to villages. , .

This, however, is not an important matter at the moment. The committee will visit Batas and Diana during the present week, and also interview the leading local Assyrians in Mosul.

The necessity of accuracy and certainly of no exaggeration m the figures was emphasised. . . . . . 4. A point has arisen during the tour of the committee which is considered worthy of consideration, namely, the recovery of loans, &amp;e., by the Assyrians to Knurls Vfizidis and Arabs. These undoubtedly amount to a very considerable OLilli. The committee suggest that a British judge or failing him an Iraqi judge be appointed to deal with this question. Should the Iraq Government agree to this proposal, it is considered that the sooner the judge takes up his duties the better. 5. The committee impressed on each meeting the inadvisability of accepting every statement they read in the local press as being authentic. They were advised to communicate either with me or with Major Wilson should any statement con cerning their move arise in the press or from any other source of which they had not been informed by the committee.

THE Chaldean Patriarch came to see me on the 21st November accompanied by his English-speaking procurator. The visit had no special object other than courtesy. The conversation naturally turned on— (1) The position of the Christians in general. (2) The Assyrians in particular. The Chaldean Patriarch, as an Iraqi and as head of the largest denomination of native Christians and being the only prelate in the Senate, can, not unreason ably in the circumstances such as the present, be regarded in some way as repre sentative of the whole Christian body. His services towards pacification and the avoidance of further massacres in the north last August will not lightly be forgotten. . . With regard to (1), he said that the action of the extremist Assyrians had inflicted a wound on all Christians here which would take years to heal. The Assyrians had raised the bogey of religious war and intolerance, which m Mesopotamia had been laid a century ago. It was touch and go with the big Christian villages of Tel Kaif and Alqosh. The latter would certainly have shown fight against the army, and the result would have been a genera pogrom o Christians all over the country. He added that his relations with the then Minister of the Interior, Hikmet Sulaimani were very good and he had ^ difficulty whatever in persuading the Ghazi to visit Alqos^ Neverthe- number of his Christian subjects there and their oy« ) certain passions less, the present situation of all Christians having been aroused in the hearts of the meaner sp &gt; ^ Christians in Mosul.

At Batas the Committee found that, although this area was entirely unaffected by the events of August last, a consiueraele number of villagers had disposed of their oxen, sheep and grain at ridiculously low prices, retaining only sufficient wheat for food till next summer. 11ajor Thomson had himself, as long ago as 15th October, seen and warned Bishop Yusuf and a number of headmen of this area against selling their possessions or otherwise interrupting their normal agricultural activities at this stage; he had repeated the warning by letter in November. There is reason to believe that this improvident action was. due to correspondence from Liar Shimun to Bishop Yusuf, who, as mentioned in paragraph 6 of the Notes forwarded to you with Yasin Pasha’s letter of 16 October 1933 (Document C/Min.

THE President said that he had not yet received news of the result of the representations which the Spanish Ambassador had been instructed to make at Rio de Janeiro. He had. however, on the preceding day visited the Brazilian Minister at Berne. The latter had no news regarding the attitude of his bovern- ment. M.

F ™ nch Representative suggested that it might be sufficient if Brigadier Browne required supplementary information, that he should discuss the matter witti the United Kingdom representative, who, if he returned to London in time, could act as the mandatory of the committee. Otherwise it might be that the Foreign Office would be prepared to acquaint Brigadier Browne with the nature of his task. The Danish Representative said that he was quite sure that Brigadier Browne would obtain all the necessary information in this way. At the same time it seemed to him an advantage that there should be a personal discussion between the brigadier and the committee. Otherwise, if things went wrong, the committee might complain that the brigadier had not carried out their wishes, and the brigadier might reply that he had had insufficient opportunity of informing himself of those wishes. It was probable, in fact, that the brigadier would himself feel the need of such a discussion before setting out for Brazil. The United Kingdom Representative said that he was quite ready to act on behalf of the committee, if required to do so, and he felt sure that the Foreign Office would do what was possible to facilitate matters. At the same time, he felt strongly that, if time permitted, it would be greatly preferable, for the reasons advanced by the Danish representative, that there should e personal contact between Brigadier Browne and the committee as a whole. The President suggested that, as a preliminary measure, perhaps it might be arranged for Brigadier Browne to visit the Foreign 0 ce an y , w b e ther to be explained to him without any commitment. He could then be asked whether he himself thought a visit to Geneva for consultation with the »nmit^ necessary.

The French Representative pointed out that the rapporteur’s YQTpOYt in which this task had been specified spoke of measures foi settlement in Iiaq only as regards those Assyrians who wished to remain in Iraq The committee was not empowered to arrange for the settlement in Iraq of those who wished to leave, but were not yet in a position to do so. The United Kingdom Representative said that the present position was discouraging, but, after all, the task of the removal of a race was bound to be a difficult one. It seemed only possible to proceed step by step, and the first step was evidently to clear up' the attitude of the Brazilian Government. The question of consulting the Assyrians regarding their willingness to go to Brazil, if only a limited number could be accepted, must depend on the numbers which the Brazilian Government were willing in the first place to receive. It was urgently necessary, if further trouble in Iraq was to be avoided, that at least those Assyrians most closely associated with the Mar Shimun, namely, the Tiari and Tkhuma tribes, should be removed at an early date. They numbered, he believed, between 4,000 and 5,000. If the Brazilian limit was less than this, the Brazilian plan could probably not be accepted. But if a limit of 5,000 could be obtained, with an understanding that more might be admitted eventually, the matter might be worth considering. According to the rapporteur’s report, which had been adopted by the Council on the 14th October, the first task of the Council Committee was to consider whether the settlement of the Assyrians outside Iraq was possible in practice, This passage had been purposely inserted in the report, because it had been anticipated that insuperable difficulties might be encountered. If no suitable place could be found in which to settle the Assyrians, the committee would have to report accordingly to the Council, and there would be no reflection upon the •committee for so doing. At the same time, it would be most regrettable if the committee found itself obliged to take this course. If, therefore, the Brazilian scheme broke down, every effort must be made to find some alternative. If the Brazilian Government were only prepared to accept a small number of Assyrians, the United Kingdom representative did not think that the only course open to the committee was to^put such a limited offer before the Assyrians. Enquiries were being made of other Governments, and the result of these enquiries would have ° 1 e ^mted and every effort made to supplement them in other quarters. It was cr 111 61 ev , ei y e ®°. 1 T to settle the Assyrians outside Iraq had been exhausted at the question which the president had raised of the settlement in Iraq of those , nans w o could not be settled outside would have to be faced.

It was naturally impossible to expect Government to accept anything in the nature of “minority At the same time, the committee would be bound to get some an official statement from the Brazilian Government to the effect that the Assyrians &gt; . A would enjoy religious toleration. Furthermore, there was the difficult question ; it 0 mJ? of nationality. The national status of the Assyrians in Iraq was sufficiently 'y-;; complicated. Most of them were technically Iraqi nationals, but some were not, f | and some who possessed Iraqi nationality technically refused to admit it. But 1 , vlB when those Assyrians who were technically Iraqis went to Brazil, it would clearly J °'s : be unreasonable in all the circumstances of the case to expect the Iraqi Govern- e pt lar^q ment con tinue to regard them as Iraqi nationals and to protect them. It was necessary, therefore, to look rather closely into the question of what status these Assyrians would enjoy, unless and until they acquired Brazilian nationality. The President enquired whether the United Kingdom representative thought it necessary to have an investigation on the spot and to clear up this question of status if only a small number of Assyrians were going to Brazil on trial. that kimt The United Kingdom Representative replied that, if only a small number were sent to Brazil, it could only be on the assumption that, i t e ex P ei d m ?^ turned out satisfactorily, all the Assyrians who wished to leave Ir aq might m di course hope to follow. The committee must therefore, he su gg es ‘ e c d ;h P n,?ohit was if only a trial number were sent, in precisely the same way - - deciding to settle all the Assyrians in Brazil. ■matt: The President asked w-hether he was right myupp^inythat Brazilil Kingdom representative proposed that theie discussion with the Brazilian Government.

The Danish Representative raised the question of the guarantee which the Brazilian Government desired from the League of Nations that the immigrants would be agriculturalists. It was clearly impossible for the League to give any such guarantee. The United Kingdom Representative recalled that the Iraqi delegation had in October calculated a report by Major Ihomson, which had included a list of Assyrians who were not agriculturalists. The number of persons not m agri cultural employment was quite considerable, though most of the persons concerned were soldiers or policemen, and it had been hoped that they would have no difficulty in reverting to agriculture. At the same time it was impossible to say that all those who desired or ought to be removed from Iraq were agriculturalists. text of tl L Thomson: utteewas. lied in any ^ resolution Ls, He th 1 # the Iraq bjmo a; In hut inti 11 was agree J of ascert w ... it . The President pointed out that the guarantee which the League was asked for referred only to the first 100 families, and it seemed necessary at the appropriate moment to arrange for the first 100 families to be carefully selected, so that they should only contain agriculturalists. # It was eventually decided that the president of the committee should ask his Government to send a further telegram to the Spanish Ambassador at Rio, quoting the letter from the Brazilian Minister at Berne, and asking the Spanish Ambassador to continue to do everything possible to secure the abandonment or enlargement of the limit. The telegram would also state that the committee assumed the Brazilian reply to mean that, if the first 100 families were satis factory, more Assyrians would be accepted, and it would ask the Spanish Ambassador to confirm this. It would also ask the Spanish Ambassador, in the event of the Brazilian Government being unwilling to enlarge the limit, to find out what length of time the Brazilian Government considered suitable for the experimental period. The Ambassador would also be asked to explain that the Council Committee hoped, by measures of selection in Iraq, to be able to give satisfaction to the Brazilian Government regarding the agricultural character of the 100 families whom* the latter were prepared to admit as an experiment. The president said he hoped to be able to get a telegram on these lines sent to the Spanish Ambassador bn the following day. ICO] bilt not t hable.

It might be that paragraphs 3 and 4 of the instructions were not 11 “ini! intended m any way to alter the constitution of the local committee as laid down ea 8«ti5( in that resolution, but simply to refer to the machinery for assembling various members. He thought, however, that the point was one which ouo-ht to be oWpd qi ^ up with the Iraqi representative. persons d Dr. Kerno asked whether the Iraqi representative who was at present not in t Geneva, but in the country, should be asked to attend a meeting for this purpose. It was agreed that the point was of no real importance until it came to the / woulk stage of ascertaining the wishes of the Assyrians about leaving Iraq, inplij Furthermore, it was difficult to ask the Iraqi representative to attend a meeting of the committee simply to clear up this matter of detail. If he attended, it would be difficult not to inform him of the present position in Brazil, which might be undesirable. It was agreed, therefore, to leave the point for the moment and to clear it up with the Iraqi representative at a later stage. The Danish Representative drew attention to the passage in Major tPP s j Vl , ( Thomson’s announcement to the Assyrians that it was very unlikely that anyone would be moved before next July. He did not know that the Iraqi Government liad any special reason to suppose that this was the case. 3 aMoi ■ The French Representative suggested that it had probably been thought at tie (ft-desirable to make the statement because most of the Assyrians were cultivators, milks f® and it was necessary that they should be induced to carry on wi n en W01 v a ask tie| sow’ crops which might be harvested before they left Iraq.

This had raised the question whether a League contribution was, in fact, practicable. The enclosed note had been prepared in response to a request from the United Kingdom representative. . -. . . • „ In rely to a question from the Danish representative, Dr. Kerno explained that the memorandum was not designed to cover the question of the expenses of a possible investigation in Brazil. The question of the expenses of such an investigation had already been settled in principle. It was proposed to charge the expenses to the working capital fund, m the expectation that ultimately they would be recovered from the general fund provided for Assyrian settlement. Letter from A rgentine Minister at Berne. Dr. Kerno distributed the text of the reply of the Argentine Minister to the enquiry which had been addressed to him by the League Secretariat regarding the willingness of the Argentine Government to accept the Assyrians. The reply is attached as Annex E.f 1 ) Future Procedure. It was decided to leave it to the president to call a further meeting as soon as he thought that the attitude of the Brazilian Government had been sufficiently defined by the conversations proceeding in Rio to enable the committee to take decisions. The president was authorised in the meantime to take such supplementary steps as he thought necessary to elucidate the Brazilian attitude. December 12, 1933. J. C. STERNDALE BENNETT.

Humphrys to Sir John Simon.-(Received December 11.) (No. 755.) Sir &gt; t^tt , , i. i. at Bagdad, November 30,1933. WITH reference to your despatch No. 724 of the 15th November, regarding the possibility of distress occurring amongst the Assyrians in Mosul during the coming winter, I have the honour to inform you that Major Thomson’s camp is intended only for destitute women and children who have lost their bread-winners, and aged men incapable of maintaining themselves by work. It cannot, therefore, alleviate the situation which may possibly arise from the concentration in Mosul town of a large number of families from the outside villages. Those who have crowded into the town appear to be making no serious effort to find work, and when the meagre resources which they may possess at present are exhausted they may become a difficult problem. 2. During my recent visit to Mosul, I gathered that the Assyrians there anticipated that sooner or later someone would provide for them by organising a camp similar to that which was established at Baqubah when the Assyrians first took refuge in Iraq. Apart from the pernicious moral and material consequences of such an arrangement, there appears to be no practical possibility of a camp of this kind being set up again, and the only solution of the problem is to endeavour, as the Iraqi Government are doing, to persuade these people to return to their villages. I am pressing the Iraqi Government to agree to reissue a reasonable number of rifles with about twenty rounds of ammunition to afl who will return to their villages and resume their normal kt 6 ’Sflalons“ ponpernirm their future I also hope that, as a result of the explanations wmcn concerning men lULuie. x aiou ^ a ’r!on q noncerning the decision adopted t&amp;fiSST&amp;ESfZtfSS' * »*“ *• ~ 1 “ * of the general condition of the Assyrians ivmg 1 ; j in the villages, possible, of the safety and welfare og^a-s desirable that an appeal and I shall not fail to report to you if it appears clesna should be made to private charity m long a j av e &amp;c.

It has therefore set up a committee to examine the possibility of finding a place outside Iraq for the resettlement of those Assyrians who express their wish to leave Iraq. 2. It must be known to all that the committee formed by the League Council has not yet found a suitable place. As soon as such a place has been found you will be informed, and a committee which has been formed under my presidency in collaboration with a representative of the Nansen Organisation for Refugees will then tour the villages inhabited by Assyrians and enquire from each family in each village whether it wishes to stay in Iraq or to go to the new place of settle ment.

The President said that the meeting had been called in order to exchange views on the various outstanding questions prior to further discussions with Major Johnson, Secretary-General of the Office, and M. Shabandar, Iraqi permanent delegate in Geneva, both of whom, he suggested, should be invited to attend the next meeting of the committee. Constitution of Local Committee in Iraq.

His private enquiries vis-a-vis of the Inter-Church Aid , Bureau had not led him to expect any substantial financial assistance from that , body of the committee, he had undertaken, while in London, to make informal enquiries, ^^ if possible, as to the amount of financial assistance which might be expected from p ytd 1 ecclesiastical and charitable sources in Great Britain. An enquiry of this sort :it Jn ac was clearly one of some difficulty, and it was hard to form any reliable opinion was as to what amount of money might be expected to be raised. He had been iwassll ita] advised, however, from a quarter which had experience of this kind of work, that fflIlg ( it might be possible, if an appeal were properly launched and organised, to raise perhaps as much as £25,000. It was doubtful if more than this could be obtained, p, This was, of course, a purely personal opinion and given merely by way of . ^ ffag unri indication. The United Kingdom representative said that it had been suggested at ^ yj. |.- to him that the best method of procedure would be to set aside some particular , r , .! item of the total cost of any settlement scheme and issue an appeal to ecclesiastical ‘ r U. and charitable organisations to cover that particular item. He recalled that, in ij, the latest report of the Nansen Office (Document C/Min.Ass./13), the suggestion i: was made that the representative of the Nansen Office, who might be ultimately |J 1 appointed to superintend the settlement operations in Parana, should have at his jfc questioi disposal a fund for social services. It seemed appropriate that this fund should waters to B be provided from private charitable sources, but they might also perhaps be asked [Itwidepov3 opinion that such an investigation should take place TTo ^ president of the Nansen Office was very anxms T e, ' S l 00d , J that the Independent investigation before the Nansen Office assumed llln 6 S k°r d , he an scheme. The president said that he thought that tho in ’ es P onsiblllt y for the tfte dependelt upon the „pl, CSS illingness m principle to accept the Assyrians. He understood hf ttl I their Office were willing to pay the expenses of a Nansen representative and thatlSe would be no difficulty about the payment from League funds of he expenses of M Assyrian expert, if it were decided to send one. As a matter of form however this would require the consent of the President of the Council, acting on The recommendation ot the Secretary-General. 5 The French Representative expressed the view that it was desirable for an investigation to take place. As regards the association with it of an Assyrian expert, he suggested that it might be possible to find such an expert from among the British officers who had commanded the Assyrians in Iraq. Dr. Kerno explained that the Nansen Office had wished their representative to be M. Burnier, who was actually their representative in Syria and engaged in the work of Armenian settlement there. M. Werner had pointed out that, if M. Burnier went to Brazil, it would be necessary for him to pay a short prior i t visit to Iraq to acquaint himself with Assyrian requirements. A telegram had e ‘ been sent to M. Burnier to ascertain whether he was able to go to Brazil, and it inoi::: appeared from his reply that this was unfortunately quite impossible, owing to iJ the work on which he was at present engaged. Puli! . . . ii* , -i -l . stance^ The President said that an enquiry certainly seemed desirable to him, as in the absence of such an enquiry, the committee would be taking a heavy ** responsibility. fonltt:. The Italian Representative agreed. teKjrtif The United Kingdom Representative said that he also agreed with the president. In addition to safeguarding the responsibihty of die Cou * lk Committee, it was also necessary to convince the Assyrians that t P P !■ M| scheme was suitable.

The President recalled that, in the committee’s resolution of the 31st October the League Secretariat had been requested to continue its enquiries as to the rvrvooiKiiiHr nf cAitlino- t.hA Assvrians in countries other than Brazil. the League secretariat naa oeen requested tu cun tin uc its cn 4 uincs as possibility of settling the Assyrians in countries other than Brazil. He asked whether the enquiries of the Secretariat had produced any result. Dr. Kerno replied in the negative. He saw no alternative to Brazil, unless one of the British Dominions were prepared to take the Assyrians. He observed that the United Kingdom representative, at the seventh meeting of the committee, had undertaken to make enquiries on this point. The United Kingdom Representative replied that Dr. Kerno was under a misapprehension. At the seventh meeting of the committee he (the United Kingdom representative) had said that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were still making enquiries as to whether there was any place in the Colonial Empire, i.e., the colonies and dependencies of the United Kingdom. He had also said that he was unaware of any place in those colonies and dependencies where the Assyrians could be settled. The enquiries of His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom were still proceeding, and he was not yet therefore in a position to make a definite statement. He could say, however, that no suitable place had yet been discovered. Most of the territories which might at first sight seem suitable were either already overpopulated or had an unemployment problem or did not contain available land. In others, the Assyrians could not be introduced without creating serious racial problems. 'vf 5 ^? rc l s ^ om i n i° n s, the United Kingdom representative pointed out at be had already endeavoured to make it clear that he could not speak on eu ^enalt. v So far as his information went, however, he doubted whether any sui a le place could be found in the Dominions. If the committee wished, owever, to make quite sure on this point, he suggested that the most suitable course was tor the League Secretariat to approach the Dominion Governments j ' Uh regard to Dr. Kerno’s statement that no alternatives to Brazil had nncarnuu- °- 1 * 16 as ^ e( ^ whether enquiries had actuallv been made into possibilities m the Argentine and in Abyssinia.

Dr Kerno thought the only means of rakmgCh a funds as might be necessary to supplement the Iraqi contribution and whatever W* the Ass y r i. ans themselves could pay would be by an appeal issued by the c ■ Nansen Oihee. 'mu I in hi The United Kingdom Representative recalled that at the seventh meeting; of the committee he had been asked whether any contribution might be expected from His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. He had indicated then that His Majesty’s Government considered the matter to be one which num concerned the League as a whole, and it was for that reason that he had ft, v. suggested that the League Secretariat should prepare a note on the manner in U;-; which analogous operations had been financed in the past. Since the date of the committee’s last meeting, the question had been considered by His Majesty’s ? Z1 Government in the United Kingdom, and he was now authorised to state that, in 111 their view, the cost of resettling the Assyrians, in so far as it was not met by the j to Brazil; Iraqi Government or by the Assyrians themselves, should be borne by the League ans. let as a whole. His Majesty’s Government were for their part willing to pay their ■oftie« share of the League contribution, but could only contemplate payment as part of a League scheme. The United Kingdom representative pointed out that Dr. Kerno had so far spoken only of schemes financed by the Nansen Office It ernoisi: wou |q p e interesting to know whether a scheme in any way analogous had been 6 ‘A financed by the League, and, if so, in precisely what manner it had been done. uni'pte j Dr. Kerno said that he could recall no suitable precedent, but he would make :edKWi further enquiries into the matter. The French Representative expressed doubt whether a League contribution was practicable. He could think of no State which would be prepared contribute. , The Danish Representative raised the, quwtiMj S -e it clear that they shared his doub on ^ ^ ^ The opinion was expressed that the C( -&gt;mm ^ League, and that it was itivefrf financial responsibilitv of this nature on e a t S e em ed to be one which il(W doubtful whether even the Council could do so ^ P oint could only be decided by the Assembly o ^ on this The United Kingdom suggested t0 ente r into past point should be obtained.

He suggested that the matter was one in which the Iraqi Government might well take the responsibility. He thought that the prices should be fixed by the Nansen representative who eventually went out to Iraq, and that the Iraqi Government should agree to pay these prices It was possible that the proceeds might be formed into a caxsse, which should be used to defray the expenses of settlement, the amount being credited to the • i * i i a ™vnnoT«nArI ns a refund of the money spent on their settlement The President expressed the view that this was an interesting suggestion which might be borne in mind, but which could more properly be discussed at a later stage. It was agreed that Major Johnson should be invited to attend the next meeting of the committee to give any necessary explanations regarding the report of the conversations in London. The question was raised whether the Iraqi permanent delegate in Geneva should be asked to attend this meeting. The United Kingdom Representative expressed the view that, as the whole scheme largely depended on the financial contribution which the Iraqi Govern ment would provide, it was desirable to keep the Iraqi delegate as far as possible au courant with the discussions on the Brazilian scheme. He suggested that it might be desirable, therefore, to invite the Iraqi delegate to attend the next meeting. This was agreed to, and the President said that he would take the opportunity of asking the Iraqi Government whether the local committee provided for in the Council Committee’s resolution on the local organisation to be set up in Iraq had in fact yet been established; and whether the reply of the Iraqi Government had yet been received regarding the amount of the contribution which they were prepared to make to the Brazilian scheme if adopted.

AT the beginning of the meeting, in addition to the members of the com mittee, the permanent Iraqi delegate—M. Shabandar -was present and on behal of the Nansen Office, M.

If tf e K WnaTlid not wish to go to Brazil, the alternative must be in his view, thaJ*.. toeT should remain in Iraq, where, according to the rapporteur s report, the* would have the benefit of the minority guarantees. ftfsidwt' ThP Italian Representative pointed out that the Council Committee's | fto Iraq- b y resolution on the organisation to be set up in Iraq provided that steps should be taken to ascertain which of the Assyrians wished to leave the country. # gai The French Representative quoted the following passage from the .gnotsomeoi rapporteur’s report: “ It being clearly understood that such part of the Assyrian LdwithAss population as remained in Iraq would be regarded as a minority to which would gldcomnuiQ be applicable the provisions of the Iraqi declaration on the protection of minorities and which would, further, be bound by the obligations of loyalty to the ||ilitywhicl State recalled by the Assembly in its resolution of the 21st September, 1922. The President said there seemed no doubt that the Assyrians would be quite leatoR COIlim free to choose whether they should leave Iraq or not and that if they chose to stay the conditions under which they would remain were those stated in the rapporteur’s report. M. Werner then said that, in his view, it would be necessary to inspect the territory to which it was proposed to send the Assyrians and that this inspection should be carried out by competent persons. He thought that it was a very great responsibility for a single investigator to judge whether or not the territory was suitable. He thought that it would be better therefore that more than one person f, tar sai should go. A further point was that it seemed desirable that whoever was chosen lade could i to investigate should first of all go to Iraq to acquaint himself with the local i a position conditions of the Assyrians. The President said that the committee had already considered this question and that the principle of an independent enquiry had been accepted. The modalities only remained to be settled, and this would be done as soon as the reply of the Brazilian Government regarding their willingness to receive the Assyrians had been received. It was probable that the enquiry would be conducted by more than one person and to avoid the necessity of sending anyone to Iraq and thus losing valuable time, the committee wms trying to find someone with the necessary knowledge of the Assyrians. One of the members of the committee had under- aken to try to find a candidate with the necessarv experience and hoped to be able to propose a name shortly. 'Mian Re represe reluctar to anotl of Ass to ascertain tofor a shor jT b emer raised the point whether the investigators might not be sent without waiting for the Brazilian reply. tip ^n\l^A a]l H\^ e ^ TeSe ^ a ^ ve ex P resse d the view that it was necessary to know the attitude of the Brazilian Government in principle.

He repeated that in Ms view, mote than one peison should go to Brazil, and again emphasised the responsibility which would he with the investigators. As regards expense the Nansen Office would be glad to bear the expense of one of the members of the investigating commission.

The Italian Representative said that as the Nansen Office was prepared to me Liaaan ttepreseniauve said mat as me INansen umce was prepared t bear the expense of one of the investigators and to share the responsibility, it would only be fitting that the Nansen Office should nominate one of the ffitatl investigators. * •• M.

The Danish Representative, while expressing appreciation of the reduction which Maior Johnson had been able to secure in the original price asked for the land still thought that the price demanded was excessive. He suggested that whoever went to Brazil as investigator might examine the price of the land m the neighbourhood. Major Johnson said that the Nansen Office had considerable experience of buying land in various parts of the world, and he could assure the committee that the prices asked by the Parana Plantations (Limited) compared I V ial b a most favourably with those ruling elsewhere “ t0 dlsc The Danish Representative still urged that they should be compared with those ruling in Brazil, and that this should be part of the task of the investigator. This led to a discussion of the character of the proposed investigating commission, and the Italian representative once more raised the question whether one of the members should not be the representative of the Nansen Office. M. Werner was evidently reluctant to commit himself to any definite recommendation, but ultimately indicated that he would probably nominate Major Johnson. hmdmt si iistry of tionld certa: iiith the Br in R Ml' i matter Initial Settlement. ■knelt Re iGovernme The Danish Representative observed that the company proposed to give paid employment in making roads, &amp;c., to those settlers who went out first.

Major Johnson drew attention to the large item in the company’s estimate for the provision of maintenance for the first nine months in Brazil.

The President then informed the committee that his proposed interview with lithe Brazilian Minister at Berne had been fixed for the 1 st December in the afternoon. Meanwhile, however, information had been received by the United Kingdom representative which it seemed necessary for the committee to consider at once. The United Kingdom^ Representative said that Parana Plantations (Limited) had received a telegram from their local representative in Brazil to the effect that the Brazilian Ministry of Labour approved only a trial immigation of 100 n of tkJ families. The United Kingdom representative felt that it was important to find niceasWH out whether this information was correct, and, if so, whether the view of the He sum Ministry of Labour was adopted by the Brazilian Government. In the latter dee of fell case, it might be possible to make representations in Rio de Janeiro in an «kd m endeavour to forestall an embarrassing reply on these lines, and to see whether it le could si was not possible to induce the Brazilian Government to adopt a more favourable Limited)ic] attitude, especially as only a decision of principle was required at the present stage, subject to discussions of details and to various other considerations. beciipa™ pfa p res i(i en f: S aid that, if the news received was correct and the attitude of the Ministry of Labour was endorsed by the Brazilian Government, the position would certainly be serious and would make it practically impossible to continue with the Brazilian scheme. He was therefore favourable to the idea o representations in Rio de Janeiro to try to induce the Brazilian Gove, mnen o consider the matter further before sending the contemplated icp y.

He had accordingly asked that instructions should be sent in the following sense . The Ambassador should first explain the capacity in which he was acting. i e., as the representative of the Council Committee, owing to the fact that the president of the committee was Spanish. He should then enquire whether the news which had reached the committee that the Brazilian Ministry of Labour were only prepared to accept a limited number of families on trial was correct, and. if so, whether this attitude had been endorsed by the Brazilian Government? mtmimt 1 In the latter case, he should point to the difficulty which such a question would flip be err create owing to the urgency of the removal of the Assyrians from Iraq and their desire for settlement in a homogeneous group, and should invite the Brazilian ? | )oss ibly ; r Government to consider the matter further on humanitarian grounds, taking into ^ e( i ue t 0 account the good qualities of the Assyrians, namely, their long tradition of Christianity and civilisation on European lines, the discipline which the majority had acquired from military service, their reputation for thrift and industry, and the unlikelihood of their becoming a social or economic burden. Finally, he should represent the urgency of the matter and ask for an early reply, emphasising that it was at that stage only a question of a decision in principle, subject to discussion of details, the practicability of the scheme put forward by Parana Plantations (Limited), and the eventual attitude towards it of the Assyrian population in Iraq. ihited Kin iieration the i that the pc ilAmbassi •hmdent s clearly be i # ignorant The president said that the Spanish Ambassador was being instructed to veep in contact with his colleagues, who might be in a position to assist him, and par icu any with the British Ambassador, on account of the information probably in tne latter s possession on the Assyrian question in general. •Msh Rf reason undt Investigation in Brazil. into fhe^considered the question of an eventual enquiry in Brazil Plantations (Limited) 1 ' ^ SSynan settlement of the territory belonging to Parana take place b/fore tbpTL r ll Wa f for decision whether such an enquiry should aftedhat reply 6 FurtC Are WaS , reCeived &gt; whether it must watt until extent, it was for cwKirWw ’ it. ie P^ was favourable, but only to a limited Th F , D COnSlderatlon whether the enquiry should still take place. reply, it seemed usdess^to stort t ^ at . so * on g as there was a risk of a negative received expressing willingness to^ If ’ 011 the other hand, a reply was question would depend on i; • + CCe | &gt; !f a hunted number of Assyrians, then the mit.

In such a case the investigator or investigators would have a double task, i.e., to examine the suitability for Assyrian needs of the area proposed in Brazil and to give explanations to the Brazilian authorities. The President said that this would be more than an enquiry. It would virtually entail diplomatic negotiations. His opinion was that such negotiations L y should be left to the diplomatic representatives in Rio rather than to an expert {.7 sent out as investigator. He thought that the reply to the Spanish Ambassador V should be awaited, and that, if it gave room for hope, the question of the despatch of an investigator should be considered further. The United Kingdom Representative explained that he had not intended to surest that the investigator should be entrusted with negotiations: his idea had been that it might in certain circumstances be useful for the local diplomatic representatives to have his assistance in the capacity of an expert who could explain Assyrian requirements and characteristics. tie factti aistry oili) rial to® m Iraq ail ite tie Bm iimdslii: i The President feared that the expense of sending out an expert for this purpose might be criticised, if the Brazilian scheme ultimately came to nothing.

Redard, the counsellor of the Swiss Legation in Rio de Janeiro, were available, it would be most appropriate hritis that he should accompany the investigator in view of the fact that he already knew smthnim ai the area concerned. Hi u Ifflied to hi The President asked Dr. Kerno to enquire whether M. Redard was still in yndperhap Rio, and if so, whether the Swiss Government, if asked to lend his services, would n , n be prepared to do so. jbtatiflof It appeared from remarks by the president and the French representative that they contemplated an investigation conducted simplv bv Brigadier Browne ■wno woi and M. Redard. ^ The United Kingdom Representative therefore asked whether it was not 1 ^ intended that a representative of the Nansen Office should be associated with the investigation as originally contemplated. It seemed to him that neither Italian Re Brigadier Browne nor M. Redard could be regarded as settlement experts, and lion, he sa: that it was desirable that a settlement expert should be associated with them. ilowerebe The Italian Representative recalled that the president of the Nansen Office had been most anxious for a local investigation to be made before the Nansen Office assumed responsibility for the settlement scheme, and that M. Werner had offered to pay the expenses of such a representative. it The French Representative suggested that if the Nansen Office felt x* necessary on their own account to examine the Brazilian scheme, they might send 0l t in f e P 1 '? se 1 n ^ a ^ ve 011 their own responsibility at a later stage when it had been es a is ed that the area concerned was suitable for Assyrian settlement The Danish Representative expressed the opinion that it was desirable that me^ committee should not appear in any way to be cold-shouldering the Nansen Km yd°m Representative said that, apart from the intrinsic invAQiio-af °k ,? ssoc ! atm S a Nansen representative with the proposed 11 would be most difficult after what had passed at the last meeting, m the presence of M.

Nevertheless, Dr. Kerno thought that as the committee were asking the Nansen Office eventually to take responsibility, it would be difficult not to give them an opportunity of studying the scheme on the spot, at the same time as it was being investigated by the Assyrian expert. ffi) nittee au§ cliilpj ationM e pt, « °ns ap| Pert, M The Danish Representative observed that if there were to be two investiga tions, the first by an Assyrian expert, and the second afterwards by the Nansen Office, there would be delay, and he could see no purpose in this delay. hat leal l his sem each i Brisadk ffhetlerifi The President said that there was a point which he felt some diffidence in mentioning. Though M. Werner had shown some reluctance to say whom he proposed to nominate, he had eventually indicated that it would probably be Maior Johnson. He wondered whether, as the Assyrian expert now provisionally diosen was a British subject, it would be considered entirely appropriate to associate with him another British subject, namely, Major Johnson. Personally, he had no objection to the investigation being carried out by two British subjects, but it seemed to him possible that the arrangement might cause some little surprise, and perhaps be criticised. The French Representative indicated that he shared the president’s view. The Danish Representative said that he could not ^'i^^hwb 3 udneirbut as - *•« *. - nationality should be taken into account.

The President indicated that he was willing to accept responsibility as fJ as he could, but it might be a matter of considerable difficulty to decide \| particular point at issue. The Italian Representative suggested that it should be left to the president to set the machinery in motion, or alternatively, if the situation was not sufficiently clear, when the reply of the Spanish Ambassador at Rio had been received, to call a further meeting of the committee. ■p ^ The United Kingdom Representative said that he did not entirely understand these suggestions. Was the proposal that the committee should now adjourn, leaving to the president the responsibility to decide on the next step when news was received about the Brazilian attitude ? If so, it seemed to him to be placingPTA: an unfair responsibility upon the president. He did not see how the committee could possibly justify an adjournment at the present stage. Certain enquiries were being made in Rio, upon which the whole fate of the Brazilian scheme depended, and it seemed to him that the committee must continue in session until it learnt the result of these representations and was in a position to appreciate the situation a and to decide what must be done next. ^ - U-WjC , The President said that, although he had been willing to accept a certain amount of responsibility, he would certainly prefer that the reply from Rio should be considered by the whole committee. It was agreed that the committee should continue in session, and the question of delegating responsibility to the president for deciding on the moment for beginning the investigation in Brazil thus fell to the ground. A short discussion followed on the terms of reference for any investigation Ljfe which might take place, and the Danish representative suggested that when they were settled, it might be useful for the committee to have a discussion with the Nansen Office representative and with Brigadier Browne if this could be ^ arranged. ffiiestion of such a discussion was left in suspense, to be reconsidered once he decision had been definitely taken to send out investigators. suggested that a draft resolution should be prepared for ^ in 10I h w k en the situation was clearer regarding the investigation, and particular stating what the duties of the investigator would be.

In districts other than the “white highlands' and the Native Reserves, the lack of mutable cultivable terrain and climatic reasons make Assyrian settlement impracticable. Sven if the Assyrians were willirg to settle down as labourers, without land of their own, they could hardly compete with native African or acclimatized Indian labour, wiule a substantial amount of capital would be required to enable them to start on their own account, own if ?acant ~ v&gt; available.

Considerable difficulty is beirg experienced in finding land in Palestine on which to settle the relatively small number of Arab tenants who have been displaced from the land v/hich they had been cultivating owing to its passing ito Jewish hands 0 The increase of Jewish immigration into destine owing to present favourable economic conditions lore coupled with the comparatively large amount of Arab lemployment has led to considerable agitation amongst the •abs g culminating in disturbances which have had to be impressed by the police.

He recalled that the committee had been established— (a) To consider whether the settlement outside Iraq of those Assyrians who might wish to leave the country would be possible in practice, and, if so, to take all necessary steps, in collaboration with the Iraqi Government, to prepare and execute a detailed scheme.

The draft resolution provisionally accepted on the 28th October provided that these wishes. should be 1 ascertained by a committee in which there would be Assyrian panicipa! linn and in which, as Nuri Pasha had himself pointed out, there would be a tion and in which, as x^un x —- — ^ ^ a ilraai maiority, counting the Assyrians as non-Iraqi for this purpose. The Iff resolution further provided that a Nansen Office representative, who would, non-j-iai-n iixcvj ^, draft resolution further provided irV' iW fact be the representative of the Council committee, would collaborate with ! ’ i wnnld hp made available to tbe P.rmrs^i m tact, oe me iepie&amp;eiiKxuivc wx uxxv, , -i ui x ,i X 11 this local committee, whose reports would be made available to the Council committee. If this resolution were ultimately adopted and carried out, the United Kingdom representative thought it could be claimed that the interests of the Assyrians during this important stage of the work would have been fully safeguarded. Unfortunately, the Iraqi Government had proposed amendments which would greatly diminish the value of the draft resolution. But their decision was not yet' final and there was time for negotiation. As regards question (3), i.e., the place of eventual settlement, various places have been suggested. They were Brazil, Syria, the Argentine, France, Spain, Cyprus, Palestine, Canada, the United States, Persia, Ethiopia and Ecuador If the United Kingdom representative had understood the French representative rightly, the French Government were not prepared to consider the settlement in Syria of all the Assyrians who might wish to leave Iraq. The Secretariat might perhaps enquire regarding the possibilities in the Argentine, but the United Kingdom representative assumed that neither France nor Spain could be seriously considered. Enquiries made by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had shown that settlement in Cyprus was unfortunately impracticable. The committee would readily understand why Palestine was out 'of the question. As regards Canada, the Secretariat’s report showed that Major Johnson considered it impracticable on account of the strict immigration laws. Although the United Kingdom representative could not speak on behalf of the Canadian Government, his information was to the same effect. The United States could not, in the view of the Nansen Office, be seriously considered. The United Kingdom representative recalled that at an earlier meeting he had mentioned that the possibility of settlement in Persia had been explored by the Assyrians hemselves without success. He could offer no opinion on the prospects of Ethiopia but he was inclined to doubt whether general conditions there were Y arrant j h( X comnnttee in considering it as a suitable place of CnvprnrrLni S 1 S ^ c ? ac ^ or ’ a detailed plan was awaited if the Ecuadorean Government saw fit to produce one. men Mr?

HtkeJ at the i intjar ■ e : hml ich: the Secretariat! an t in the Is ely impratti it of the Major Jk i laws, I v~/ — ^ r- Of these, the first two would presumably require decisions by the committee before settlement in Brazil could be put before the Assyrians as a concrete proposal. But as soon as these decisions had been taken it seemed to the United Kingdom representative that the remainder of the work of settlement could be definitely entrusted to the Nansen Office, working in close collaboration with the League Secretariat, the Council committee being kept informed of developments and being called together when necessary to take decisions should difficulties arise. For the moment then, the questions which the committee could usefully consider were two. The first was the question of finance, and to enable the committee to consider what steps must be taken it would be useful if the Nansen Office could state how previous movements of refugees had been financed. The United Kingdom representative was sure that the Teague Secretariat also could offer useful suggestions based on their previous experience. ^^ . The second question concerned the general conditions under which the Assyrians were to be settled in Brazil. These might be considered under two headings :— [a) Physical and economic. (b) Political lited State 'ed. lei le by tie M the pros]! 1 ; itions tteJ fajestbfe Dr some tis: ;se eni in Brazil.

The United Kingdom representative, m conclusion, suggested that, when the outstanding points had been discussed, it might be useful to record the present position of the committee’s work in the form of a minute or resolution. The President, on behalf of the committee, expressed appreciation of the United Kingdom representative’s statement of the position. He suggested that one of the most important, if not the most important, of the points which had been dealt with therein was that which concerned the financial aspect of the transfer and resettlement of the Assyrians. He felt that, before any further progress could be made, it was essential that the committee should know more clearly how much money was likely to be contributed by the Iraqi Government and how much it would be possible to obtain from other sources. Clearly, if the contribution of the Iraqi Government was to be limited, as had been suggested by Nuri Pasha privately in conversation, to £40,000, the high cost of the Brazilian proposal would render it impracticable, and other alternatives would have to be sought urgently. The expenditure which would have to be undertaken fell into two categories : (a) Preliminary expenditure which might be incurred in the investigation of likely schemes; (h) the expenditure which would be incurred in the actual execution of the plan of resettlement finally adopted. It mioffit be suggested that expenditure of the first class could be undertaken before the problem of financing the settlement scheme had been resolved. For his part however, he considered that it would be unwise to incur any financial liabilities whatever until the sources from which money could be obtained to meet them had been more clearly defined. He did not wish to be indiscreet, but he thought that it won d be of interest to all members of the committee to know whether it was probable that financial assistance would be forthcoming from the United Kingdom Government. 5 umLeu trans 111 / I leave Iraq ^ Lute untou p tie cost of t pas MO or £ Eioiild oe ea s .' aid that tin 1 capital to o [wuld he incu The United Kingdom Representative replied that he much regretted that a™ 0 on m th a eCnt° n A t0 ^ OT t0 Commit GoveZent h Iraq and of thr ,' As t!' lesult . the mandate which they had held for Zhnnien? had of co, U ° nS r W1 , th Ass y ria ns. the United Kingdom but they no lonZhad Z P e( ; ullar ly close interest in the Assyrian question, Council The resettlement STUe A?sZm ‘anUtZ fi° ther ■“Z 61 ' 8 ° f ^ questions which concornprl th* ^ bS 3 lian s, and the financing of it, were that the League Secretariat in mirnff 8 a whole : and , he wou ld dike to suggest prepare a note for the Wlth the Nansen Office, should analogous operations had been financefinZD™™ 1466 ' ° n ^ manner “ Wh ’ Ch i States of Ai line fur jicominittee a Llhingdom re L that some psach sugge: liiade, a ter j 1 limit for c Ik President ife draft befoi 1 short discus Uixc JJdOL.

I®!! The United Kingdom Representative said that he had no personal knowledge rff of the individual capacity of the Assyrians to pay a contribution of this kind, ial a$|k but he would ask Captain Holt to give the committee any information which he forested on this point. Captain Holt said that the capacity of families to pay a contribution ^ towards the cost of their transport and settlement outside Iraq would, of course, rces ' fc vary very much in individual cases. Many of the families who were likely to wish to leave Iraq had suffered heavy loss in the recent disturbances, but others tcftlieljjjad been quite untouched and should be in a position to contribute substantially !S W011 l(l ttowards the cost of their resettlement. Many of the latter might be able to pay ! undertatas much as £40 or £50, or, in some instances, even more.

The committee further resolves in principle that, before deciding on the place of settlement, it will cause an independent investigation to be made regarding the suitability of that place for Assyrian settlement. Finally, it decides that, once a destination has been agreed upon for the Assyrians who wish to leave Iraq, the task of preparing and executing plans for transfer and settlement of these Assyrians shall be entrusted, under conditions- which will be defined later by the committee, to the Nansen Office, working in close collaboration, through the League Secretariat, with the Council Committee. In the meanwhile, the committee requests the Nansen Office to continue, without - commitment, to study detailed arrangements for the transport of Assyrians to Brazil and their settlement on the land at the disposal of Parana Plantations (Limited).

WITH reference to my telegram No. 422 of the 12th October, His Majesty’ consul at Mosul reports that the number of Assyrians (other than those in the Rest Gamp) at present in Mosul is believed to be considerably in excess of previous estimates. There are, he says, about 600 families (2,000 persons), of whom some 400 families were more or less permanently resident. The rest are refugees from the country districts. A large percentage of the men are unemployed and although many are living on savings or being supported by private charity, it is possible that there will be much distress during the coming winter. The administrative inspector has informed the Iraqi authorities, and something will have to be done to induce those who have come in from the country to return to their lands. ^ v ^ , ‘2.

Record of Sixth Meeting of the Council Committee held at 10-30 a.m. on October 31, 1933.— (Received in Foreign Office, November 8.) IT had been the intention that this meeting should be in the nature of an informal conversation between certain members only of the committee and Major Johnson. The Italian representative was, however, able to attend after all, and as the committee was thus at full strength, the meeting resumed its formal character. The President informed the committee that he had received a note from the Brazilian Minister at Berne, intimating that he had duly addressed an enquiry to the Brazilian Government concerning their willingness in principle to accept a large number of Assyrian colonists on the Parana Plantations land. The note showed that the Brazilian Minister had misunderstood one important point and had informed his Government that the Assyrians were Roman Catholics. In replv to questions from various members of the committee, Caftain Holt explained that while a number of the Assyrians in question were converts to Presbyterianism, the great majority were Nestorians. The Catholic branch ot the Assyrian race was the Chaldeans, whose affairs were not at present m question. The President suggested that the secretariat should tak ® ^ explain the position to the Brazilian Minister m older o lem a serious misunderstanding. This was agreed to Trani delegation The President said that he had also been informed by the that a reply had been received from the Iraqi o ^ ^ oca j comm ittee committee’s draft resolution on the subject of e Assvrians He thought, in Iraq to deal with certain questions ^oj^^J^^^y^Q^London in connexion however, that as Major Johnson wished to . com mittee should with the work of the Nansen Office, it wo ^ d H ^ which begin their meeting with a further gene settlement of Assyrians th!

It was agreed that educational and medical assistance would he necessary and members of the committee were generally of the opinion that an appeal might be made to benevolent organisations to help m this regard. The French Representative suggested, for consideration, that instead 1 tlj S l I wluL/lv l.\j&amp; ^^ 00 # •'ll J LM Durchasine; separate plots for each family it might be more satisfactory for the Nansen Office to acquire from the company a large tract of territory which their representative in Brazil could himself divide among the Assyrian colonists according to the special requirements of each family. The Danish Representative noted that the project put forward by the Nansen Office (document C/Min.Ass./2.1933) provided for the allotment of 12 hectares to each family of settlers. He would like to know whether this was considered to be sufficient or whether, as appeared to be contemplated in the report, which had been made by the counsellor of the Swiss Legation at Rio de Janeiro, more land might not be required by certain types of Assyrian settlers. The Danish Representative enquired whether Major Johnson could give the committee any information about the juridical status of the Parana Plantations Company in Brazil. He would like to know, for example, whether they enjoye any special legal privileges vis-a-vis the Brazilian Government. Major Johnson undertook to endeavour to obtain information on this point during his visit to London. The committee then devoted some time to discussing to what extent it W ^ U Jj be desirable that the Assyrians settled in Brazil, or elsewhere, should be e liable to refund the cost of their transfer and establishment in the place resettlement. *1 ref® iijsef 0d to rfS I jUetoeM jj®]f le &gt;( # them 8 ! agreeing [ider it epart of w tide Iraq is fk PrM Llf which - ’sdr Mr. Edmonds said that he thought that 12 hectares, representing about 30 acres of land, was quite as much as the average Assyrian family could handle by themselves, and was, he considered, more than that which was usually worked by Assyrian families now settled in Iraq. The President then raised the question of the arrangements which might be necessary for those Assyrians who did not normally maintain themselves by agriculture. He said that he understood that the Brazilian Government did not favour non-agricultural colonists. Uance wi The United Kingdom Representative said that there were certainly a considerable number of Assyrians now in Iraq who were not engaged in agriculture. There was a tendency to drift to the towns where he understood that many of the Assyrians were employed as servants. A few were employed on the railways in Iraq and by the oil companies. Still more were serving in the levies and police. But as the majority came from ordinary peasant stock and had probably had experience of work on the land, it should not be difficult, he thought, for them to adapt themselves to work on the land in Brazil. One of the advantages, however, of the project which had been put forward by the Nansen Office was that there was reasonable prospect of a certain number of settlers finding manual and other work in connexion with railway construction and in the townships which appeared to be developing. :re alterati fiever, that jefinite deci liken forn ; A discuss ling to adi riiiuoduet indline a hth the ab It was 1 Mr. Edmonds referred the committee to the document which had been put forward by the Iraqi delegation (C/Min.Ass. /T.1933), in which some details had been given of the number of Assyrian families at present established on the land in Iraq and of others employed in the towns. He offered the suggestion that it might be best to arrange first for the transfer and resettlement of the entirely agricultural element and to allow other categories who wished to emigrate to follow afterwards. lat in certai /, Skfr m that itingencies rag, perha The Un\ tie risk of mittee si Abut qua Signed soli fewas so, an titer the wc All the ^ords “wit tel commi grantee r Particular, irtaii The L | authorities, r ersofc The U Major Johnson explained that the practice of the Nansen Office was o m each family of refugees liable to refund all the money which had been spen them, including that expended on transport.

In the experience of the Office such treatment * s, 6 T ld ° nl I lead , t0 P au P£ ris ation and the weakening of the moral stamina of the rdngees themselves. The members of the committee, in discussing this point while agreeing in principle with Major Johnson’s views, showed a tendency to a ® k?i consider it desirable that the Assyrians should be exempted from repayment of some part of the money which it would be necessary to spend on their resettlement outside Iraq. No decision was, however, adopted on this point. (After this Major Johnson withdrew from the meeting.) The President then invited M. Shabandar to explain to the committee the reply which had been received from the Iraqi Government regarding the committee’s draft resolution concerning the local committee in Iraq. M. Shabandar distributed copies of this draft resolution amended in accordance with the suggestions put forward by the Iraqi Government, which, in Tianfaiii eac ^ i ns t ance &gt;. he had underlined^) in order that the committee might easily see where alterations had been introduced (see annex). He reminded the committee, however, that owing to the resignation of the Cabinet it would not be possible for a definite decision concerning the resolution to be reached until a new Government i; had been formed. maintain ik- a discussion followed in which the committee generally expressed themselves lianfan* w ini n g to adopt all the amendments proposed by the Iraqi Government, except the introduction of the words ££ as far as local circumstances permit” m the second line and the substitution of the words “with the local authorities tor there we® ere S' “with the above-mentioned local committee” in line 13. v , ,, , It was pointed out that the first of those amendments implied that the composition of the local committee might be changed at any momen , an even that in certain districts no committee might be set up at a .

They indicated, howevt &gt; that they saw no objection to, and possibly some advantage in, the Danili representative’s proposal. M Finally, it was decided to request the Iraqi representative to reply to hi Government making the following suggestions :— ^ s (1) That the phrase “as far as local circumstances permit” should be omitted, but that if the Iraqi Government attached a special importance to the retention of some such words, the phrase ‘‘the kaimakam or nahiya mudir ” might be altered to read “the interested kaimakam or nahiya mudir according to local circum stances,” and that the words “above-mentioned local committee” should be retained with the addition, if the Iraqi Government dedrpd of “and the local authorities.” M. Shabandar undertook to act on this suggestion, but again pointed out that he could not expect to receive definite instructions until a new Government had been formed in Bagdad. Geneva, October 31, 1933. WlTl Secretary Annex. t THE committee takes note of the intention of the Iraqi Government, as far as local circumstances permit, to nominate a local committee, composed of the land settlement expert as president, an administrative inspector, the kaimakam or nahiya mudir and the Assyrian village headman concerned, to explain to the Assyrians the exact meaning of the decision of the Council of the League of JNations, and that a committee of the Council is actively examining plans for its execution.

Your orders which I have explained to my people were that anyone not willing to stay in Iraq can go to wherever he likes and that the government will hear his expense until he reaches the' frontier. Because we are not meddling in the settlement scheme, the opinion held by the Chiefs of my people is that whoever has meddled or will meddle in tnis settlement, is being disgraced among his people. The people pay no attention or listen to such persons and such persons will ultimately be dis graced before the government as they will no doubt fail and wil not be able to carry out their promise to the government.

The reason for his arrest is because of hi s quarrel with Chiknkhu G-iwu as the former has told th .3 latter that he would not recognise him as the chief for the Upper Tiyari* This nan Chikhkhu has informed you that the people will not accept him as a Malik and that he could not therefore carry out the obligations of a Malikship for the Tiyari. This is the reason that has apparently led to the illegal detention of Warda. You personally informed me that every Assyrian is free either to remain in Iraq or leave the country and that tnose wishing to leave Iraqp the Government would bear the expenses until such persons reaoh the frontier of their new destinations. As long as you have given the option to the people, then it is the right of every person to say whether or not he would accept Chikhkhu as Malik and there exist no such governments to imprison people for such causes.

There were many conflicting reports r^n££ the circumstances under ^hioh fire *as first opened. The administration states that an 'Iraqi officer went over to the Assyrian camp in the afternoon and was told that a party of Assyrians proposed Crossing over in the evening to surrender and hand in their arms. In the evening, a party was duly reported to be crossing, carrying their arms, A company of ♦Iraqi troops was sent forward to meat them and, when within a short distance of the Assyrians the latter opened fire, killing, the ’Iraqi officer. Confusion followed and heavy fire was exchanged. Ohe Assyrians then advanced Eastwards and, during the ni^it, attacked the picquets of the ‘Iraqi Army Camp at DAI RABUN. They occupied one of the posts, but abandoned it later when they took to the hills. Another version states that the Assyrians intended to surrender their arms to the ’Iraqi Army and fording the river in small groups over a mile frontage when fir- 3 was suddenly opened on them. Ibis is supposed to have happened &gt;^119 Uae French officials wars in the process of issuing, or had lust finished issuing rifles to those men from whom°they hid taken them.
