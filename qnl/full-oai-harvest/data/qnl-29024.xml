Location cannot be determined due to damage to the support at the point where an inscription was intended to identify the place. However, it is likely that these views were sketched in the vicinity of those on the verso.On the verso of WD3528 four further, less detailed views predominantly indicate geographic features along the coastline. Inscriptions indicate locations as follows: Babelmandel Island [Barīm]; Fisher or Pilots Island Island [Fisherman’s Rock or Pilot’s Rock / Shaykh Malu Island]; Babelmandel Cape [Ras Bab el Mandeb]; Babelmandel Quoin [a wedge-shaped point on Ras Bab el Mandeb].Due to extensive damage to the paper and despite subsequent repairs, much of the information on both recto and verso is rendered unusable or illegible. In the centre of the lower view on the recto, a later hand has redrawn sections of the missing image in pencil in a clumsy attempt to restore the image.On the recto of WD3528a, which was the flysheet of a sketchbook comprising the drawings WD3528–WD3536, the name ‘Capt Elwon’ has been inscribed, indicating that the sketchbook belonged to Elwon.Inscriptions:WD3528 Recto:Below lower view, in pencil: ‘Sketch of Cape [lost] Town’WD3528 Verso:Upper left corner, in pencil: ‘WD3528’Upper view, in pencil: ‘Part of Penin. or Babelmandel Island [Barīm], Ship steering West entrance of the Arab [illegible] aheads’Upper middle view, in pencil: ‘Fisher or Pilots Island [Fisherman’s Rock or Pilot’s Rock / Shaykh Malu Island]off Babelmandel Cape [Ras Bab el Mandeb]’Lower middle view, in pencil: ‘Babelmandel Quoin [Ras Bab el Mandeb]’WD3528a Recto:Centre of page, in pencil: ‘Capt Elwon’Upper right corner, in pencil: ‘3528a’</abstract><typeOfResource>still image</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Drawing</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Thomas Elwon</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">artist</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Babelmandel</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100025687404.0x000001#share">Public Domain</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
