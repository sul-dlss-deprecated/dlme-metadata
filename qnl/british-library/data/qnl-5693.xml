Memorandum on the separate Claims of Turkey and Persia to Sovereignty over the Island of Bahrein. ' Gazetteer of the World,' p. 529. THE Bahrein Islands are a small group of islands, three in number, on the south-west side of the Persian Gulf, in the centre of Bahrein Bay, the principal of which is Bahrein (or Aval), lying about ten miles off the Coast of Arabia. These islands are famous for their pearl fishery, which are con sidered the richest and most productive in the world, and are conducted on an extensive scale. 'Imperial Gazetteer,' vol. i,p. 300. Bahrein was occupied by the Portuguese in the sixteenth century, but in 1622 they were expelled by the Persians, who appear to have held possession of the island till about the year 1782 or 1783,* Inclosure in Colonel Sheil's when the Zoborah Arabs attacked and captured it. In 1800 the island was again attacked, and reduced to submission by the Imaum of Muscat, when the headmen of the principal families were sent to Muscat; but in the following year it was taken from the Imaum by the Uttoobees with the assistance of the Wahabees. In 1809 the British Government sent an expe dition against the Pirates in the Persian Gulf, when the Uttoobees intreated the British Government to exempt them from the general chastisement, and solicited British assistance to throw off the Wahabee yoke; but the British Government abstained from all interference. In 1810-11 the Wahabee Ruler assumed the Government of Bahrein and Zoborah, and appointed a Vakeel over those places. The Uttoobees con- * The ' Imperial Gazetteer ' states that the Persians withdrew • '^C from the Island in 1790, and that subsequently the Wahabees extended their sway over the island as well as the coast. [234] Btinued, however, in the administration, but paid tribute to the Wahabee Vakeel. About this time the Wahabee Ruler was engaged in checking the invasion of the Turkish troops under Ibrahim Pasha, and the Imaum of Muscat availed himself of the opportunity to attack Zoborah and Bahrein. The former place he sacceeded in burning, and having landed at Bahrein, he took the Wahabee Vakeel prisoner, and the Uttoobees then recovered possession of the island. In 1815-16 Bahrein was again attacked by the Imaum of Muscat; but, on this occasion, he was signally defeated. In April, 1817, Mr. Willock, who was then British Minister in Persia, announced to the Government of India the arrival at Tehran of an Agent from the Imaum of Muscat, and, in doing so, Air. Willock stated that he had been credibly in formed that the object of the mission was to inform the Shah that the British Government had the cap ture of Bahrein in contemplation, and to ask the Shah to assist the Imaum with a body of troops, in order that he might thwart the design by taking possession ot the island in the name of His Majesty. Mr. Willock also reported that an Agent of the Mr. Willock No. 6; Sheikh of Bahrein was also at Tehran, and that a Apri116 ' 1817 * letter, of which he was the bearer, stated that as the inhabitants of the island were of the same sect as the natives of Persia, they had always looked up to the Persian Monarch as their protector and head, and that they therefore hoped for His Majesty's assistance to cloak them from the oppres sions of the Wahabees. A firman was in consequence issued by the Shah Mr. Willock, No. 10; to the Imaum of Muscat, granting the military May 6,1817. assistance he solicited. It would appear, however, that the promised assistance was never granted; for in May 1819 Mr. Willock, No. 16; Mr. Willock reported that the Imaum had never May 25,1819. ceased in his endeavours to induce the Shah to attempt the capture of the Island of Bahrein, and that his recent letters teemed with complaints of the non-fulfilment of the engagements contracted by the Persian Court. He added that Ibrahim Pasha had sent messengers to Bahrein, demanding the(a) Hertslet's Treaties, tol. viii, p. 794. UOdf ' -ts^J ?0\ ltu/A cession of the island and the payment of the tribute formerly given to the Wahabees ; and that it was even reported that the fortresses of Bahrein had actually been delivered up to the troops of Ibrahim Pasha, and that the island was subject to his authority. The Imaum of Muscat thereupon urged on the Shah the necessity of endeavouring to recover a possession which, he stated, ' had for ages acknow ledged the sovereignty of Persiabut the entreaties of the Imaum failed to induce the Shah to take any active steps in the matter; and Mr. Willock announced to the Governor-General of India in the following month that the Shah had, ' for the present,' dropped all intention of taking any steps in support of his pretensions to the sovereignty of that island. Still, the Imaum of Muscat con tinued his preparation for an expedition against Bahrein. The British Government of India were opposed to this expedition, being of opinion that the main tenance of hostilities between any of the maritime States in the Persian Gulf would obstruct the permanent accomplishment of its views for the suppression of the disorders which had called /or their interference. The Persian Gulf was at this time infested with piratical tribes, and in 1819 a naval and military expedition was fitted out by the Government of India for the destruction of their maritime forces and resources. This expedition speedily proved successful. Has ul Khyma was captured by the British expedition, and the Sheikh of Bahrein thereupon delivered up the vessels belonging to the Pirates which were in his harbour. On the 8th January, 1820, a General Treaty was signed at Ras ul Rhyma between Great Britain and certain Arab Chiefs of the Persian Gulf, relative to the suppression of Piracy, the Slave Trade, &amp;c., and to this Treaty the Sheikh of Bahrein acceded. As the principal object of this Treaty wa^s to put a stop to the system of Piracy and plunder which had prevailed in the Gulf, it was stipulated in one of the Articles that the tribes ' should be at peace with the British Government, and should not fight with each other.' The tranquillity thus re-established in the PersianGulf put a stop to the expedition which was then being prepared by the Imaum of Muscat against Bahrein. But, in the following year (1821), the Bahrein Colonel Shell, No. 42 of 1845. Chiefs agreed to pay 30,000 German crowns tribute annually to the Imaum of Muscat, who, in return, engaged to release some of the Uttoobec Sheikhs detained by him, and to restore all the To Colonel Shell, No. 38; , . -r. i • t-' u September 23, 1825. vessels and property belonging to Lahrem which he had put under an embargo on their way up from India; but 12,000 crowns of this tribute were subsequently remitted. The India Office have stated that, in 1825, the lnll 1 l || ( £ ffice LeUer • April 2!&gt; ' Persians laid claim to the sovereignty of the island, and that the British Government refused to recog nize the claim, but I find no trace of this in oui correspondence. In 1828 another expedition was fitted out by the Imaum of Muscat against the Island of Bahrein, which was signally defeated. The following year peace was concluded between the Uttoobees and the Imaum. It was thereby agreed that the tribute formerly paid to the Imaum should cease, and that no interference whatever should take place in each other's concerns. In 1830 the Wahabees called upon the Sheikh of Bahrein to pay the annual tribute. Other demands were at the same time made on the Sheikh Abdullah by the Wahabees; when it was ultimately agreed that the supremacy of a certain Ameer Toovkey bin Savod should be acknowledged at Bahrein, and that the* tribute should be paid by the Uttoobees, in return for which protection was promised to them. In 1833 fresh quarrels arose: the Sheikh of Bahrein refused allegiance to the Wahabees, and resolved to retaliate all attempts at aggression, and upon this occasion the Imaum of Muscat pledged himself not to interfere in the quarrel. It mav here be mentioned, as bearing on the Hertslet's Treaties, vol. tui , w # - -m-v • pD. 2*\j l) question of the British proceedings in the 1 ersian Gulf, that, m 1838 and 1839, various engagements were entered into by the local Sheikh for the suppression of the Slave Trade. Intrigues and conspiracies continued to increase Coloncl shei|) No . 42 of in Bahrein during the next few years, nntd at ^ ^ ^ i83g _ length, in 1839, the Egyptian commander announced ^ ^ ^ ^ is39 to the British Resident in the 1 ersian Gulf hisr intention of attacking and reducing the island, as forming part of Nejd, over which the \ iceroy of Egypt claimed to be Lord. It being shortly afterwards reported that the Sheikh of Bahrein had entered into an agreement with Mehemet Ali to pay him the same tribute as had formerly been paid to the AVahabce Chief upon condition that neither the Island of Bahrein nor his territories on the Coast of Guttur were to be interfered with in any way by the Pasha, the British Resident sought an interview with Mehemet Effendi, the confidential agent of Khos- shid Pasha, and after remonstrating with him in strong terms against any attack being made on the Uttoobee territories, he informed the agent of the Pasha that the British Government could not admit any claim of the Pasha upon Bahrein. On the 24th February, 1840, a letter was addressed by the Foreign Office to the India Board stating, in answer to an inquiry from the Bombay Govern ment, that it was important that Mehemet AUs troops should not he allowed to take possession of Bahrein, and suggesting that, if the troops of the East India Company could occupy it even provisionally, such a measure could not fail to be attended with advantage. India Board letter of October 22, 1840. At the close of this year, the British Resident in the Persian Gulf had an interview with the Imaum of Muscat, when he inquired what his Highness's views were with regard to Bahrein. The Imaum remarked that 'the views which he formerly entertained with reference to Bahrein remained unaltered, but that he had been restrained from carrying them into effect by certain considera tions^ namely, an impression that the British Government was averse to the prosecution of his claim upon the Island, and further, his entire con viction that, unless assisted either by Mehemet-Ali or Great Britain, it was impossible that any expedi tion undertaken by his owa means alone could be successful.' As the pearl fishery of the Gulf continued to be greatly interrupted by the constant feuds between various Chiefs of the Arabian coast, a ' maritime Hertslet's Treaties, vol. ix, p. 618. truce' was, on the 1st June, 1843, agreed upon between them, under the mediation of the British ' 0 Resident. The Chiefs of Bahrein still contended ['234] C Colonel Sheil, No. 86; October 1843.among themselves for the supremacy of the Island; and, in October 1843, one of the discomfited Sheikhs, Abdoolah, presented himself at Bushire, and obtained from one of the principal priests of that town a letter, in which he promised him, on the part of the Governor of Fars, the aid of a considerable body of Persian troops. Colonel Sheil having obtained a copy of this letter, showed it to the Persian Prime Minister, who remarked that the writer had no authority to interfere in the affairs of Government, and that he would reprove him for his presumption ; but his Excellency added that Bahrein belonged by right to Persia, and that the Shah was resolved to regain possession of the Island when other affairs of importance were disposed of. In a letter addressed by the Persian Prime Minister to the Governor of Fars about this time, allusion was made to Bahrein as ' one of the Islands of Fars.' The British Resident in the Persian Gulf was, however, instructed by the Governor of India to resist by force any attempt of the Persian Govern ment to establish troops on the Island of Bahrein. An Instruction was shortly afterwards addressed to Colonel Sheil desiring him to inform the Persian To Colonel Sheil, No. Minister that Her Majesty's Government had heard Au - n ' t J1 - 1M4 - with regret that it was reported to be in the con templation of the Government of the Shah to take part in the disputes respecting the Government of Bahrein; that such a proceeding would be viewed with much jealousy by the British Government in India; that, unless the right of Persia to interfere in the matter was beyond dispute, any interference on her part might lead to unpleasant discussions with England ; for that, although Her Majesty's Government did not dispute the right of Persia as an independent Power to adopt any line of policy not inconsistent with its engagements to foreign states, which she might think advantageous to herself, they claimed for themselves a corres ponding right to judge and act in such matters as they might think fit. Colonel Sheil was further informed that, unless Persia could shew that she had a clear and indis putable right to the Sovereignty of Bahrein; that she had exercised it without interruption underthe dynasty of the Kajar family ; and that conse quently her present policy was directed to the maintenance of her lawful claims, and not to the assertion of a pretension not founded in law; she would be prepared to encounter in any scheme of the kind the active opposition of the British Government in India. On being made acquainted with the views of the British Government with regard to Bahrein, the Persian Prime Minister promised not to make any movement against the Island without giving previous notification of such an intention to the British Govern ment, but at the same time he said he would undertake to prove the right of Persia to the possession of the island. 5. In February 1845 Colonel Sheil sent home a letter which he had received from the Prime Minister of Persia, relative to the pretension of Persia to the Island of Bahrein, accompanied by a Convention, concluded in 1822, between Captain Bruce, then Resident of the East India Company in the Persian Gulf, and the Vizier of the Prince Governor of Fars, admitting, among a variety of other stipulations, the right of Persia to Bahrein. But Colonel Sheil drew attention to the fact that the proceedings of this officer were wholly unautho rized; that the arrangement he had entered into had been entirely disavowed by the Governor of Bombay, who, as a public mark of its disappro bation, removed him from his appointment; and, moreover, that the Convention was never ratified. Colonel Sheil, in a subsequent despatch, observed that it appeared, from inquiries which he had made at Tehran, that the Suffaveen dynasty, which had ceased to reign about 120 years previously, had exercised sway over Bahrein, and that it also seemed to have been held by Nadir Shah and by some of the race of Tend, which preceded the then reigning family ; but that the result of his inquiries confirmed him in the opinion that the Island had not formed part of the dominions of Persia since the accession of the Kajar dynasty. He added that the Chiefs of Bahrein had, in all probability, from time to time, given Peeshkesh, offerings, or tribute, to Persia as a mark of superiority, as Candahar and Herat still continued to do, without an acknowledgment of subjection; but that he could not ascertain that8 Persia had exercised any real control over the Island within the preceding fifty or sixty years. The Persian Government, however, in corrobora tion of the claim put forward by the Shah, for warded to Colonel Sheil a gold coin which had been struck at Bahrein, in 1817, in the name of ' Fetteh Ali Shah, Kajarand Colonel Sheil admitted his belief in the genuineness of the coin, which, he had been informed, was procured from Bushire by one of the Persian Secretaries to the Russian Mission. Other statements were put forward in support of the Persian claim, but Colonel Sheil made no reply to them, but simply informed the Persian Minister that he would bring those statements to the notice of the British Government. On receipt of this despatch, Colonel Sheil was instructed not to revert to the subject unless it was forced upon him by the Persian Prime Minister, in which case he was directed to employ the argu ments adduced in a Foreign Office Memorandum (which was inclosed) to show generally the grounds on which Her Majesty's Government were unable to recognize as valid the claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein; and he was further directed to state that the British Government would very much disapprove of any .attempts on the part of Persia to interfere in the affairs of the • Island, and thus disturb the peace of the Gulf and afford an opening to Piracy. The question then dropped for a short time. In 1847 several other engagements were entered into by the British Government with local Sheikhs of the Gulf for the suppression of the Slave Trade, includinc one with the Sheik of Bahrein (8th Mav, Hertslet's Treaties, vol. viii, v 0 ' pp. 798-801. 1847). In this year the Bahrein Question was revived on its being rumoured that the Porte enter tained designs upon the Island. On the question being put directly to the Porte, they denied any intention of using Compulsion with regard to To India Board, October U, 1847. Bahrein, although they admitted that if the ( lu ' kl . N - Governor of Bussorah had attempted, by nego tiation, to induce any of the maritime Chiefs of the Persian Gulf to return to their allegiance to the Porte, they could not disapprove his doing so. Lord Palmerston, upon this, suggested to the India Board that, if the Indian Government hadany further apprehensions on the subject, and if the Bahrein Chief was really an independent Ruler, the best course would be to make with him a treaty of alliance which would secure his inde pendence and his friendly connection with England. But the British Resident, Major Hennell, deemed med it inexpedient that the British Government should involve itself in the embarrassments likely to arise from a closer alliance with Bahrein; and the Secret Committee of the East India Company considered that Major Hennell 'had exercised a wise discretion in not taking any step for the negotiation of a new Treaty with Bahrein ' To Admiralty, December 2, 1847, ShortIy after this the Ruler of made ^ application to the Indian Government for protec tion against an apprehended attack from some fugitives from his dominions who had established themselves on the Island Keeru, belonging to Persia; and Lord Palmerston informed the Admi ralty and India Board that he was of opinion that such protection should be afforded by the British naval force in the Indian seas. 1 he Persian Government, however, objected to the British interference in the affairs of Bahrein ; whereupon Colonel Farrant informed them that the British Government were unable to recognize as valid the claims advanced by Persia to the Sovereignty of Bahrein; and his conduct in so doin^ was approved. In the same year, the Chief of Bahrein made a proposition to place himself under the protection oi the British Government, but the proposal was not listened to. Subsequently, however, the British Government having received information that the Sheikh of JJallrein was desirous of placing himself under To Sir Stratford Canning, No.40; Iui ' l&lt;lsl1 protection, sent instructions to Sir Strat- Febrnary 12, 1851. lord Canning to inform the Turkish Ministers that Her -Majesty's Government could not acknowledge nor acquiesce m any such arrangement, seein^ that the Government of British India had had relations with Bahr ein as an Independent State, and had conc,uded wth it certain Treaties, n^ely, one in 1820 for the suppression of Piracy, and one in 1847 for the prohibition of the exportation of slaves: and that the British Government must object to any arrangement, which could transfer Bahrein to [234J n (1 urkey.)

But in May, 1852, the question of the possession India Board, August 18, 1852. of Bahrein by the Imaum of Muscat was revived, when the British Consul at Zanzibar was instructed to state to the Imaum that Her Majesty's Govern- To India Board, August 28, ment saw no reason to alter their views respecting the possession of Bahrein, which was communicated to His Highness in 1849. The 'Maritime Truce' of 1st June, 1843, above Hertslet, vol. ix, p. 1005. alluded to, was only concluded for ten years, but the benefits and advantages derived from it were so fully admitted that, on the 4tli May, 1853, a Treaty was concluded, under British mediation, between the Chiefs of Amalgavine, Ejman, Deboye, Beniyas, and Joasmee, by which it was agreed that a perpetual ' Maritime Truce ' should endure between them and their successors for ever; that disputes should be referred to the British Resident for settlement; and that the maintenance of the Peace should be watched over by the British Government. i In 1859 the Sheikh of Damaun made extensive preparations with the Wahabees to attack Bahrein, and several vessels bearing Turkish colours and one belonging to a Persian port, were seized by them; but when the preparations were almost matured, the actual outbreak was prevented by the interven tion of the British squadron. For many years previously, that is to say, ever India Office, February 8, 1862. since the year 1844, the Chief of Damaun, Mahomed bin Abdoolah, assisted by the neighbouring Washa- bee tribes, had endeavoured to possess himself of Bahrein. He had repeatedly been warned by the British Government that a persistence in this course would lead to his deportation, and he had repeatedly promised to desist, but his promises were always broken : and as the Peace of the Persian Gulf was seriously disturbed by these repeated alarms, and Piracy encouraged, the Bombay Government deter mined to remove the Sheikh from Damaun and compel him to live at Grane, or on the 1 ersian shore, the Chief of Bahrein consenting to allow him 3,000 dollars a-year; and, in a letter addressed by Captain Felix Jones, the Political Resident, to the Wahabee Ameer, on the 2nd June, 1861, reference11 ^ was made by him to ' Bahrein and the coasts ' r as being 'under His Highness' control, 1 and to the steps which had been taken by the British autho- • rities to preserve the peace of ' His Highness' territories.' ^ India Office, February n, 1861. i n December, 1860, the Bombay Government forwarded to the India Office a resolution which it had drawn up, and in which an opinion was ex pressed that ' Bahrein should be regarded as independent, and as subject neither to Turkey nor r* India Office, February 12, Persia' and these views were coincided in by the 18G1. 7 J India Office and Foreign Office. India Office, February 8, 1862. j n jggj certain aggressive acts were committed by the Sheikh of Bahrein against the Wahabees. The Chief of Bahrein blockaded the Wahabee ports, and harassed the trade and pearl fisheries of Damaun and Kateef. The British Political Agent in the Persian Gulf (Captain Felix Jones) remonstrated against these proceedings, and, as they were unheeded, a British . squadron was ordered to assemble at Bahrein. Still the Sheikh defied the power of England to compel him to desist, being, it was said, secretly instigated by Persian agents, who promised him the support of French ships. The British Commodore was thereupon desired by the Resident to employ force, and he at once ' State Papers,' vol, Ivi, p. 1402. seized two of the Sheikh's war-vessels, upon which the Sheikh gave in, and on the 31st May, 1861, he entered into the following ' Friendly Convention with Sheikh Mahomed bin Khaleefah, Independent Ruler of Bahrein :'— ' Considering the tribe disorders which arise and are perpetuated from maritime aggressions in the Persian Gulf, I, Sheikh Mahomed Bin Khuleefa, Independent Ruler of Bahrein, on my own part and * , on that of my heirs and successors, in the presence of the Chiefs and elders who are witnesses to this document, do subscribe and agree to a perpetual Treaty of Peace and Friendship with the British &lt; * Government, having for its object the advance ment of trade and the security of all classes of people navigating or residing upon the coasts of this sea. 'Article I. I recognize as valid and in force all former Treaties and Conventions agreed to between the Chiefs of Bahrein and the British12 Government, either direct or through the mediation of its representatives in this Gulf. 'Art. II. I agree to abstain from all maritime aggressions of every description, from the persecu tion of war, piracy, and slavery by sea, so long as I receive the support of the British Government in the maintenance of the security of my own possessions against similar aggressions directed against them by the Chiefs and tribes of this Gulf. 'Art. III. In order that the above engagements may be fulfilled, I agree to make known all aggressions and depredations which may be designed, or have place at sea, against myself, territories, or subjects as early as possible, to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, as the arbitrator in such cases, promising that no act of aggression or retaliation shall be committed at sea by Bahrein, or in the name of Bahrein, by myself or others under me, on other tribes without his consent or that of the British Government, if it should be necessary to procure it. And the British Resident engages that he will forthwith take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation for every injury proved to have been inflicted, or in course of infliction by sea upon Bahrein, or upon its dependencies in this Gulf. In like manner, I, Sheikh Mahomed Bin Khuleefa, will afford full redress for all maritime offences, which, in justice, can be charged against my subjects, or myself as the ruler of Bahrein. 'Art. IV. British subjects of every denomina tion, it is understood, may reside in, and carry on their lawful trade in the territories of Bahrein, their goods being subject only to an ad valorem duty of 5 per cent, in cash or in kind. This amount once paid shall not be demanded again on the same goods if exported from Bahrein to other places; and, in respect of the treatment of British subjects and dependents, they shall receive the treatment and consideration of the subjects and dependents of the most favoured people. All offences which they may commit, or which may be • committed against them, shall be reserved for the decision of the British Resident, provided the British Agent located at Bahrein shall fail to adjust them satis factorily. In like manner the British Resident will use his good offices for the welfare of the subjects of Bahrein in the ports of the maritime Arab tribes13 Lord Cowley&gt; No. 15 ; January 7, 1862.

These articles of alliance shall have effect from the date of ratification or approval by the British Government.'' This Treaty was approved by the Indian Govern ment, and in order that the Turkish and Persian Governments might not regard the British relations with Bahrein with feelings of jealousy and distrust, they were informed of what had transpired. In January 1862 the Persian Envoy at Paris complained, in a note to Lord Cowley, of the seizure by the British authorities of a vessel belong ing to the Sheikh of Bahrein, but he was told in reply that Her Majesty's Government could not recognize any claim on the part of Persia to ques tion their proceedings in regard to Bahrein, and must therefore decline to afford him any explana tion on the subject of his complaint; nevertheless, on the 24th October, 1868, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs made another formal complaint to Mr. Alison against the conduct pursued by the British Resident at Bushire (then Lieutenant- Colonel Pelly). After appealing to the Treaties con cluded between England andPersia in 1809, in 1814 in 1821, but not ratified), and in 1857, he said that the British Resident, instead of respecting the rights of Persia in the Persian Gulf to the extent provided for in those Treaties, had, without giving any intimation'of his designs to the Persian Govern ment, or communicating with the authorities in Fars, acted in an independent manner, and made a hostile attack with four steamers upon the island of Bahrein, which island, the Minister declared, had been, and still w T as, the property of Persia, the same as were the islands of Kishm, Angaum, and Hoormuz; and he complained that the British Resident had bombarded the Fort and the Governor's house; had set fire to some boats; that, on the Sheikh (Mahomed been Khaleefah) flying aw T ay from fear, the Resident had appointed the Sheikh's brother (Ali been Khaleefah) to be Governor over the island; and that he had exacted a large sum of money as a fine, and laid a condition on the Sheikh that he should find his brother and deliver him up to the British Residency ; and he further complained that these proceedings had taken place at a time |234] E14 ■when the Governor of Bahrein was openly avowing his submission to, and dependence upon, Persia; and that he (the Governor) considered Bahrein to be indisputably Persian, in proof of which he stated the Persian flag was flying over his fort. This hoisting of the flag was evidently of little importance, as Captain Felix Jones has said that he has himself seen the Turkish and Persian flag hoisted alternately from the same flag-staff, accord ing as the Chief had reason to fear the presence of a Turkish or Persian official in the neighbourhood. Lieutenant-Colonel Pelly, however, acted under India Office, December 31,186S. direct orders from the Bombay Government, with regard to the punishment of the *' arch-pirate' Mahomed been Khaleefah, and the conduct which he pursued at Bahrein, Guttuar, and Aboothabee, for the suppression of Piracy and the maintenance of the peace of the Persian Gulf, was entirely approved by the Indian Government. A full account of all that had passed at Bahrein was sent by the Foreign Office to Mr. Alison, with instructions to make a proper explanatory com- To Mr Alison No 1 • munication on the subject to the Persian Govern- January 5, 1869. ment; and he did so. But Lord Clarendon suggested to the Duke of To India Office, February 1,1869- Argyll whether it would not be advisable, in the event of similar proceedings again becoming neces sary, that communication should be had with the Persian Government. On the 11th of the same month, while the General Mohsin Khan, question w T as under consideration, the Persian lebruary n, 1869. Minister in London renewed the complaint against the proceedings of Colonel Pelly at Bahrein, and requested that the British Government would give orders for the repair of the damages occasioned by his acts; but, after consultation with the India Office, he was informed that ' the Sheikh of To General Mohsin Khan, Bahrein was an independent Chief, with w 7 hom the Wdrcl1 0 -&gt; 1 869. British Government had Treaty engagements, and whom they must hold strictly to the performance of those engagements.' But the Persian Charge d'Affaires in London disputed this and forwarded to the Foreign Office Gen( . ral Mollsin Khail; letters from the Sheikh of Bahrein, dated in April April 15,1869. 1860, in one of which he 'confessed that the isles of the Bahrein were part of the Persian territory.'

Lord Clarendon concurred in this view of the case, and a reply, couched in those terms, was returned to the Persian Charge d'AfFaires. On receipt of this letter, however, the Persian Charge d'Affaires requested that certain modi fications might be made in it, in order to make it more agreeable to the Shah; and the India Office having been again consulted, the Duke of Argyll replied that he saw no objection to an admission on the part of the British Government that the Government of the Shah had protested against the Persian right of Sovereignty over Bahrein being ignored by the British authorities, and that that protest had received due consideration ; but that he could not consent to debar the officers of the British Government, to whom the superintendence of the police of the Persian Gulf was entrusted, from the exercise of the right of punishing, by prompt16 measures, any violation of Treaty engagements by the Sheikh of Bahrein, when a reference to the Court of Teheran would be attended with embar rassing delays, which might jeopardize the general peace of the Gulf. The letter to the Persian Chargd d'Affaires was April 29, accordingly amended, as follows, the words in italics being added to the original note :— ' The British Government readily admit that the Government of the Shah has protested against the Persian right of sovereignty over Bahrein being ignored hy the British Authorities, and ^hey have given due consideration to that protest. But it is the fact, as yourself and the Government of the Shah are undoubtedly aware, that the Sheikhs of Bahrein have at different periods entered directly into engagements with the British Government; and I beg to assure you that the British Govern ment hold the Sheikh to these engagements solely for the purposes of preventing Piracy and Slave Trade, and of maintaining the police of the Gulf. If the Persian Government are prepared to keep a sufficient force in the Gulf for these purposes, this country would be relieved of a troublesome and costly duty; but, if the Shah is not prepared to undertake these duties, Her Majesty's Government cannot suppose His Majesty would wish that in those waters disorder and crimes should be encouraged by impunity. ' I need scarcely assure you of the friendly feelings entertained by Her Majesty's Government towards Persia, and their desire on all occasions to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Shah ; and, in regard to this question, I have the honour to state to you that, whenever it is practicable to do so. Her Majesty's Government will cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand of any measures of coercion against himself which the conduct of the Sheikh of Bahrein may have rendered necessary. ' But the British Government cannot consent to dehar its officers, to whom the superintendence of the police of the Persian Gulf is entrusted, from the exercise of the right of punishing by prompt measures any violation of Treaty engagements by the Sheikh of Bahrein, when a reference to the Court of Tehran would be attended with embarrassing m 869. s « 'S17 India Office, September 21, 1869.

It will be observed that the clause in the India Office letter repeating that it ' regarded the Sheikh of Bahrein as an independent Sovereign' was omitted in this letter to the Persian Charge d'Affaires; but whether it was done so through inadvertence, or intentionally, does not appear. The Persian Government had promised to do all in its power to suppress Piracy in the Persian Gulf; but in September following another letter was received from the India Office again calling attention to the affairs of Bahrein, and stating that it had been found necessary to send further naval support to the Persian Gulf to the assistance of Colonel Pelly; whereupon Mr. Thomson w T as instructed to take an early opportunity of expressing to the Persian Government the regret of the British Government that, notwithstanding the assurances which had been given, Persia seemed unable to prevent Piracy in those waters. In speaking on the subject to Mr, Thomson, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs admitted that the Persian Government had not acquired sufficient power or authority in that part of the Gulf to enable them to repress acts of Piracy and to maintain order, but he added that he hoped, before long, the Shah's authority would be fully established at Bahrein; that Persia would be able to prevent further disorder; that satisfaction w T ould be given to the British Government for any acts of which they had to complain ; and in full redress being afforded to all parties who had suffered loss through recent events, and that, in the meanwhile, it would not be considered necessary that British Authorities should have recourse to measures of coercion in that quarter. Mr. Thomson then reported that a Royal Firman had been issued recognizing Ali been Khaleefah as Chief of Bahrein ; but that before it reached him he had been attacked and killed by his brother, Mahomed been Khaleefah, and that the Firman had accordingly been returned to the Shah, when the name of the latter Chief was substituted for the former. [234] F18 As soon as the news reached India that an Mr. Thomson, No. 83; attack had been made on the Chief placed in power November 16, 18G9. at Bahrein by the British Government, and a breach committed of the ' maritime truce,' orders were sent to Colonel Pelly to proceed to Bahrein with a naval force, and to call upon the Chief in possession to account for his conduct. On receipt of these instructions, Colonel Pelly telegraphed to Mr. Alison to inform the Persian Government accordingly, and he did so, when the Persian Minister replied that the Arabs in those parts had killed Mahomed been Khaleefah, who had been the cause of the recent disturbances ; that Colonel Pelly's proceeding there was therefore useless ; and that he hoped he would be instructed by telegraph not to go to Bahrein. He also told Mr. Thomson that the Per sian Government would itself keep the affairs of Bahrein hy land in order, and that should any thing happen to affect its affairs hy sea, it would request the British Government to send a naval force to put affairs in order. A Persian Agent, Meerza Mehdee Khan, was then Mr. Thomson, No. 94; sent to Bahrein to inquire into the recent proceedings Decem ber 1 1, 1869. there of Colonel Pelly. In obedience to his orders, the Agent addressed letters to the Chief of Bahrein, and forwarded them by a special messenger, who pro ceeded to the island in a native boat belonging to a Persian named Hyder Khan; but Colonel Pelly&gt; who had reached the island with several vessels before the Persian messenger arrived, prevented him from landing or communicating with the Chief, whereupon the Persian Agent returned to Bushire without delivering the letters to whom they they were addressed. On the arrival at Tehran of news of this event, Mr. Alison had an interview with the Persian Prime Minister, when the Minister said that the Shah expressed regret at the conduct pursued by Colonel Pelly towards the Persian Agent, but Mr. Thomson, No. 7; which he attributed to some misunderstanding. He ^ anuar &gt; 12 ! 18/0 stated that the Persian Government had no reason to complain of the punishment inflicted on Mahomed been Khaleefah for his lawless proceedings, but he expressed a hope that steps would be taken to prevent the recurrence of such interference in future. It transpired that, on the return of the Persian Agent, he pointed out to his Government that English influ-19 General Mohsin Khan January 22, 1870. India Office, January 29, 1870.

India Office, February I, 1870. ence would continue to be paramount in the Persian Gulf, and that Persia could never exercise the authority which she ought to have in that sea unless she possessed some kind of naval establish ment of her own ; and he strongly urged upon the Shah's Ministers the expediency of making imme diate arrangements, either by direct purchase or by application to one of the European Powers, with a view to the formation of a Persian flotilla in the Gulf as a means of making good the Shah's claim to Sovereignty over Bahrein ; of resisting the pre tensions of the Imaum of Muscat at Bunder Abbas and elsewhere on the Persian coast; and of coercing the Arab Chiefs on the shores of the Gulf. The Persian Charge d'Affaires in London also made a formal complaint against Colonel Pelly's proceedings; and the opinion of Lord Clarendon upon that officer's proceedings at Bahrein may be gathered from the following minutes. On the docket of one of the letters his Lordship wrote, 'I w T ish to know who authorized Colonel Pelly's recent high-handed proceedings in the Per sian Gulf; ' on another he wrote, ' The service was no doubt well performed ; but, query our right or duty to act as Colonel Pelly has done ; ' and on a third, ' I trust that full explanations will be given of the proceedings of Colonel Pelly, against which Persian Government seem to have just reason for complaint.' Full reports were applied for and received from the Admiralty and Indian Government respecting Colonel Pelly's proceedings, and from these it appeared that the sole object the British authorities had in view was the punishment of the Arab Chiefs at Bahrein for breaking the maritime truce and insulting the English flag, and the suppression of piracy. But, instead of the Persian Agent having been insulted, it appeared that he did not go himself to Bahrein, but sent one of his people; and Colonel Pelly thus explained how that official came to be detained;— •'On the 19th November, 1861), a native craft armed with guns, &amp;c., and flying Arab colours, endeavoured to break the blockade. She w T as visited and proved to have on board an emissary from the Persian coast, asserting himself to be the bearer of certain letters confirming the Pirate Chief20 Mahomed ben Abdullah in power, and affording him armed assistance. The emissary declared him self to be deputed by the Chief of Dayer, who was acting in obedience to one Merza Mehdee Khan, formerly a Persian Envoy to Bahrein; but the emissary added, that he had no authority from the Shah's Government.' Colonel Felly's conduct was entirely approved by the Government of India. Whilst all these proceedings were taking place, the Turkish Government remained perfectly silent; but at length, in January 1870, a telegram was sent from Constantinople to the Turkish Ambassador in London, desiring him to ask for explanations from the British Government as to what had been taking place at Bahrein ; in alluding to which place the telegram said, u L'lle de Bahrein nayant jamais cesse, que nous sachions, de taire partie des Posses sions Ottomanes.' Mr. Barron was, however, instructed by Lord Clarendon, to 'explain courteously to the Porte that the British Government could not recognize its claim to the sovereignty of Bahrein, with regard to which a similar decision was pronounced by Lord Palmerston in his despatch of the 12th February, 1851.' And Mr. Barron subsequently reported that he had done so, and that he had left with the Turkish Minister an abstract of the Memorandum which he had received from the Foreign Office on the subject, and that Aali Pasha had made no remark in answer to the communication. In March following fresh complaints were made by Persia against Colonel Felly's proceedings, especially of his having seized an Imperial Firman, and his not replying to a letter from Meerzer Mehdeh Khan. Upon this note Lord Clarendon wrote another Minute, in which he said, ' I con sider Colonel Felly's proceedings to have been quite uncalled for and, in fact, a gieat outiagc. We have a decided interest at this moment in conciliating, and in not insulting Persiaand an official letter was in consequence addressed to the India Office, which concluded thus :— 'Lord Clarendon directs me to add that, although suspending a final judgment until answers are received from India, his Lordship cannot # % Musurus Pasha, January 13,1870. r No. 19, February 8, 1870. s No. 21, February 11, 1870.

Lord Clarendon does not dispute the necessity of order being maintained in the Persian Gulf by the Indian Government, but he considers that this might be done in a manner less calculated to give offence.' A few days later, the India Office forwarded to this Office another long series of despatches from India respecting the proceedings of Colonel ] elly at the Island of Bahrein, i he India Govern ment pointed out that it would be seen that the Shah of Persia had no legitimate control over the Sheikh of Bahrein; but that his Government, had. nevertheless, encouraged the piratical faction of the Persian Gulf, proof of which was to be found in certain letters which had been intercepted by Colonel Pelly, and they therefore, expressed an opinion, wdiich was shared in by the Duke of Argyll, that, so far from the Shah having any just cause of complaint against Colonel Pelly, the Persian Government should be called upon to give some explanation of the conduct of its officers in encouraging a piratical expedition, which was prejudicial to British interests in the Persian Gulf. These despatches went fully into the question of the independence of Bahrein, and of the circum stances connected with the alleged complicity of the Shah's Government in the acts of the piratical faction in the Gulf; and the following is an abstract which was made of them at the time. [234] G —22 With regard to the first question, viz., that of the independence of Bahrein, the following account was given by the Indian Government:— It was governed by Arab Sheikhs till 150G, when it fell into the hands of the Portuguese, from whom it was wrested in a few years by Persia. During part of the 17th century, and for 25 years at the end of the 18th century, Bahrein paid tribute to the Shah; but from 1782 to 1801 it gave her allegiance to Muscat. 'From 1801 to 1820 the Wahabees and Uttoobees Hertslet's Treaties, vol. viif, fought for the possession of the islands; in the P*'?, 45 i i , , nn # # ^ otsitG x apers, v01 • ivij p« latter year a Treaty was concluded, in which Bahrein and all the Chiefs of the Gulf pledged themselves to peace with the British Government, and the suppression of piracy. The Uttoobees, at that time masters of Bahrein, in 1836 agreed, on certain conditions, to pay tribute to the Wahabees, and in 1839 made the same arrangement with Egypt, which, however, soon fell to the ground. ' In 1845, the British Government first used their influence with Bahrein, when (on the occasion of disputes arising between the members of the ruling family in the island) they objected to the interference of Persia, and ordered an exiled ex- Sheikh to abstain from disturbing the peace of the gulf. In 1847 (? 1848) the ruling Sheikh of Bahrein offered allegiance to Great Britain, which, however, was refused. In 1859, the above-men tioned ex-Sheikh was expelled from his stronghold, whence he had organized piratical expeditions against Bahrein. Shortly afterwards the ruling Sheikh on being remonstrated with on account of certain law less acts, declared his allegiance to Turkey; but in 1861 he concluded a Treaty with Great Britain State Papers, vol. vi, p. 1402. (similar to that of 1820) promising, as 'independent Ruler of Bahrein,' to abstain from acts of piracy, &amp;c. ' Her Majesty's Government having concluded this Treaty with the Sheikh as an independent ruler, refused to concur in a proposal made by the Shah that the Sovereignty of Bahrein should be transferred to the Persian Crown. ' The despatch then called attention to the fact that when, in 1868, it was found necessary to punish the Chief of Bahrein without reference being made to Persia, the Shah's remonstrance was met b y a reference to the decision of Her Majesty's » i23 Seep. 13. Government in 1861,* that Bahrein was indepen dent. ' The Indian Government, therefore, looking at the following facts, namely, that the Sheikhs of Bahrein had, at different periods offered their allegiance not only to Persia, but equally to Great Britain, Muscat, Turkey, and the Wahabees; that Her Majesty's Government had Treaty engagements with the Sheikhs of the Gulf as independent rulers ; and that, moreover, Persia had no Navy, and would, therefore, be unable to repress Piracy in the Gulf; were of opinion that any claim of the Shah to the Sovereignty of Bahrein should be met by a firm remonstrance on the part of Her Majesty's Govern ment.' With regard to the second question treated of in the despatch from the Indian Government, viz., the alleged complicity of the Shah's Government in the acts of the piratical faction in the Gulf, and the encouragement given thereto by his officers, the following explanation was offered :— 'It appeared that Ali bin Khalifa, the reigning Sheikh of Bahrein, had offered his allegiance to Persia, on which the Shah had sent a Firman, appointing him his Representative at Bahrein; but that on his being murdered by his brother Mahomed bin Khalifa, the name of the latter was substituted and a messenger dispatched charged with the neces sary instructions for nominating him as Governor of Mahomed bin Khaleefah was the island.* That during the blockade of Bahrein reported to have been killed by . ^ . inn /- i • i ^ i i i the Arabs. by Colonel relly, oi which notice had been given at Tehran, an Arab vessel had attempted to reach the island, which proved to have on board Hajee abd Abu, a special messenger deputed by Mirza Mehdee Khan (an official appointed by the Shah to superintend the affairs of the Gulf), to convey letters from himself, from the Prince Governor of Fars, and from three Arab Chiefs to Mahomed bin Abdoollah, the pirate Chief who had violently possessed himself of Bahrein; that the messenger denied being an agent of the Shah, though it was evident from Mr. Thomson's despatch (^o. 94, of 11th December, 1869), that the Persian Govern ment had acknowledged that he was employed by • them ; that Colonel Pelly, as instructed by telegram from Bombay, detained the letters; but, at an nterview which he had shortly afterwards with24 Mahomed bin Abdoollah, be had delivered them to him; that after perusing them he returned them to Colonel Pelly; that the Persian Agent was informed of this fact; and that the blockade being at an end, he was permitted to depart.' With regard to certain letters which had been intercepted, the following account was given :— 44 The one from the Prince Governor of Fars conferred the Government of Bahrein on Mahomed bin Abdoollah; that from Mehdee Khan summoned him to Dayer to arrange matters, and promised that he should there find a Firman and dress of honour from the Shah; whilst those from the Arab Chiefs recounted what they had done on behalf of Mahomed bin Abdoollah. ' Colonel Pelly was of opinion that the action of the Persian Government had been deliberately taken throughout, and the Indian Government called attention to the fact that the Shah's Govern ment, in complaining of Colonel Pelly's proceedings in intercepting a messenger from His Majesty to the so-called Ruler of Bahrein, overlooked the fact that Mahomed bin Abdoollah had no right to such a title; and Lord Mayo therefore said he trusted that Her Majesty's Government would call on that of the Shah for an explanation of the conduct of its officers in countenancing the unprovoked attack of Mahomed bin Abdoollah on Bahrein, by nominating him to the Chiefship of the islands; and also for the successive appointments by the Persian Government of Ali bin Khaleefah and Mahomed bin Khaleefah to the sovereignty of a district over which they had no legitimate control.' Under these circumstances, the Duke of Argyll proposed to approve Colonel Pelly's proceedings, as sanctioned and commended by the Government of India, and to express his concurrence in the views expressed by the Viceroy of India with respect to the status of Bahrein, as an independent chiefship, over which the Shah of Persia had no legitimate control, as those views appeared to be consistent with the policy which both the India Office and Foreign Office had approved as regarded the Police of the Persian Gulf during a long course of years. A despatch was accordingly addressed to To Mr. Thomson, in which he was told that it 1 appeared, from the paper which had been received25 India Office, March 31, 1870. To India Office, April 1, 1870. Mr. Thomson, No. 37 April 1, 1870. from India, to be very doubtful whether, instead of the Persian Government being justified in com plaining of the conduct ofColonel Pelly, in prevent ing a Persian Agent from landing at Bahrein and communicating with the Chief in possession, the British Government might not have cause to complain of the proceedings of the Persian authorities in endeavouring to communicate with a piratical chief who had been guilty of a breach of the Maritime Truce, and who had attacked the Chief placed in power at Bahrein by the British Government ; and he was told that no notice would be taken of the complaints against Colonel Pelly until the Persian Government gave full explanation respecting the intercepted letters. Lord Clarendon, however, stated in a Minute, that he could not concur in approval of Colonel Pelly's proceedings; and the India Office were therefore informed that his Lordship could not form any opinion upon the points referred to in the correspondence from India until he had received a reply to the inquiry he had instructed to be made at Tehran respecting the intercepted letters. In May following, a despatch was received from Mr. Thomson, inclosing copies of the correspon dence which he had had with the Indian Govern ment respecting the steps taken by Colonel Pelly to prevent the Persian Agent from landing at Bahrein, and the following is the abstract which was made of those papers at the time:— 'The complaint of the Persian Government against Colonel Pelly was that, during the blockade of Bahrein, he refused to admit an Agent of the Shah to the Island, and intercepted the letters of which he was the bearer. This the Persian Govern ment considered to have been an unjustifiable interference in their affairs, as it had nothing to do with the suppression of piracy ' The following was the explanation of Colonel Pelly's proceedings as furnished to Mr. Thomson by the Indian Government:— 'On the 19th of November an armed vessel carrying Arab colours approached the harbour of Bahrein, keeping up a fire of cannon. On her attempting, by passing Her Majesty's ship Daphne,' to break the blockade mQintained by [234] H26 • the authority of the Government of India, she was boarded. Colonel Pelly had an interview with Hajee Abel Alee, her chief passenger, who intimated that he was the bearer of a dress of honour and of • a letter from the Prince Governor of Fars to Mahomed bin Abdullah, who had recently usurped the Government of Bahrein; and of letters to the same person from Mirza Mehdee Khan, an employe of the Persian Foreign Office. He said that he himself was in no way accredited by the Persian Government; that Mehdee Khan had orders from the Prince of Fars to go as Envoy to Bahrein: but had deputed him to go in his stead. ' Two days after the interview Hajee Abd Alee asked leave to make over his letters to Colonel Pelly, who refused to accept them until he received instructions from the Indian Government. He accordingly referred the matter to the Government of Bombay, who directed him by telegraph to take possession of the letters. Colonel Pelly then took the letters, and Mahomed bin Abdoollah surren dering shortly afterwards, he delivered them to that Chief, at their first interview, in the same condition as they had been made over to himself. The latter perused the letters and then gave them to Colonel Pelly. The delivery of the letters to Mahomed bin Abdoolah was formally announced to Hajee Abd Alee, and he was informed that, as the blockade was raised, he was at liberty to depart. ' The Persian Government, in making their com plaint against Colonel Pelly, ignored the following facts:— ' 1st. That the vessel boarded by Colonel Pelly was attempting to break a blockade of which notice had been duly given at Tehran. '2nd. That the messenger, when questioned, denied being in any way an Envoy accredited by the Shah. ' 3rd. That the letters were delivered by Colonel Pelly to the person to whom they were addressed in exactly the same condition as they were made over to that officer.' Lord Clarendon, however, wrote the following Minute on the docket of Mr. Thomson's despatch, ' I cannot understand the rights of this matter.'

India Office, February 24, 1872. j- &gt; See Inclosure 7 in India Office, letter of February 24, 1872, p. 9. Sir H. Elliot, No. 399, November 14, 1871. To India Office, December 5, 1871. To Sir H. Elliot, No. 203, November 2, 1871. papers, relating to Colonel Felly's proceedings at Bahrein, was received from the India Office; but nothing further was then done in the matter. In the autumn of 1871, during the progress of the Turkish expedition against Nejd, a circum stance arose which re-opened the question of the Turkish claim to sovereignty over Bahrein. It was reported that a Turkish messenger had been murdered by order of the Chief of Bahrein. The Indian Government fearing lest the matter should give rise to serious complications, instructed Colonel Pelly to proceed to the spot, and to do all in his power to settle the question amicably. Colonel Pelly arrived at the Island in November, and reported the facts of the case to be as follows :— The messenger belonged to the Beni Hajie tribe of Arabs on the mainland opposite Bahrein, and was proceeding from Lahsa to Guttur viS. Ojair, with letters from his employer, Nassin bin Mobarek, and, having occasion to put in at the port of Bahrein, he was recognized by some Arabs as having been concerned in the murder, in 1869, of the late Chief of Bahrein, Ali ben Khaleefah, and killed on the spot; but the Chief of Bahrein was in no way concerned in the murder. On the body of the messenger was found, among other letters, one (but of which he was merely inciden tally the bearer), from Tereck Pasha at Lahsa, and this was sent, unopened, to its address. The Turkish Government at first took the matter up warmly, and, in November following, the Turkish fleet visited Bahrein, and the Commodore informed Colonel Pelly that he considered Bahrein Turkish territory ; but, at the request of Sir Henry Elliot, Server Pasha repeated the assurances for merly given by Aali Pasha, that the Porte did not entertain any intention of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes of Southern Arabia, nor contemplate any attack upon them. Before this despatch reached this office, Sir Henry Elliot had been instructed by Lord Granville to ascertain definitively what was the policy of the Porte with regard to the Persian Gulf; and, accordingly, on the 10th December, 1871, he reported that Server Pasha had again assured him28 that the Porte entertained not the least intention to attach nor obtain any supremacy over the inde pendent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf, nor did it harbour any design of subduing them. With regard to Nejd, Server Pasha observed that it formed an integral part of the Ottoman dominions, and that the Porte, as a matter of course,, was endeavouring to assimilate it to the other provinces of the Empire, and felt anxious to establish there permanent order and tranquillity. With regard to the construction of Turkish naval stations in the Gulf, Server Pasha said that all the Ottoman steamers had always been stationed there, on account of the proximity of the rivers connecting Baghdad with the Gulf of Persia, and that their numbers were daily increasing. In this despatch Sir Henry Elliot also stated that the Persian Minister had sent his Secretary to him in some anxiety about a rumour which had reached him from London, that the Turkish expe dition was about to be sent by Midhat Pasha for the reduction of Bahrein, which island, the Persian Secretary stated, had been acknowledged by the British Government as a portion ot the Persian dominions; and that, in proof of this assertion, he had handed to Sir H. Elliot a copy of the note which Lord Clarendon addressed to General Hadji Mohsin Khan on the 29th April, 1869 (already alluded to in this Memorandum, p. 16). Sir H. Elliot, however, observed that he saw in that note nothing more than an acknowledgment that the claim had previously been made; but that he was unwilling to discuss the point, as he believed there was no danger of any attempt being made to interfere with the position of Bahrein as it then stood. With regard to the murder of the messenger, the Bahrein Chief ultimately addressed a letter to Midhat Pasha expressing his regret at the occur rence ; declaring his ignorance of the quality of the messenger, who had no credentials; pointing out the imprudence of sending a man who had a blood feud with the Bahreins, and expressing his surprise that a servant of the Porte should have been the bearer of a letter in which the Porte was represented as wishing to annex the territory of the Chief of Bahrein (such a letter, having been found on the dead body of the messenger),4 29 No. 6, January 30, 1872 Mr. Ilumbold, No. 23 ; February 6, 1872. India Office, February 24, 1872. March 30, 1872. To this the Porte replied by demanding 10,000 silver dirams as blood money, and the seizure and confinement of the murderer; failing compliance with which demands, he declared that Bahrein must expect forcible measures to be taken. The Sheikh thereupon placed himself in the hands of the British Agent, and Midhat Pasha, influenced probably by the presence of British vessels on the spot, left the Gulf without carrying out his in tended visit to the island. With reference to these events, the Govern ment of India stated that they were of opinion that the Chief ot Bahrein s expression of regret at the occurrence of the murder was sufficient, and that no reparation on his part was called for: they added that they considered that, if it had not been for Colonel Pelly's deputation to Bahrein, very serious complications might have arisen ; and that they had expressed their approval of his action in the matter. At the suggestion of the Viceroy of India, Mr. Ilumbold was instructed to tell the Porte that the British Government was willing to arbitrate on the question; and he was further told to move the Porte to consent to this, and to state at the same time that, if indemnity were demanded, strict orders should be issued from Constantinople to the Pasha to make no attempt to support the demand by force, or even a show of it, pending the arbitration. To this the Porte replied that it was awaiting information as to the true facts of the case, but that on receiving them, the suggestion of the British Government should be considered. On receipt of this reply the Duke of Argyll suggested, in the event of the Porte being unwilling to accept the arbitration of the British Government, that it would be expedient to propose to the Turkish Government a reference to the French Consul at Bagdad, a perfectly disinterested officer near at hand, who might proceed to Bahrein and, after making due inquiries, arbitrate on the spot. In the following month, however, Mr. Rumbold telegraphed that the dispute was in a fair way of settlement between Midhat Pasha and the Bahrein authorities, and that the Porte therefore saw no use in arbitration; and the matter was finally settled by the Sheikh of Bahrein consenting to pay [234J Jn 30 a sum of money to the family of the murdered man Inclosure in Sir H.Elliot, No. 422, and to give up the murderers to the Governor of I)ecember 10, 18/1. Bagdad. In July following, the Turkish Government To India Office, July 28, 1872. complained of the British proceedings with regard to the Island of Bahrein. The Turkish Ambassador informed Lord Granville that two years previously he had made a friendly representation on the subject to Lord Clarendon, who had promised to institute inquiries, but that, owing to his death, the matter had been allowed to sleep ; but the Ambassador stated that further acts of Sovereignty had since been committed on the part of the English, and that his Government had, therefore, instructed him in the same friendly spirit to make ' representa tions against any encroachments on land belonging to the Sultan,' and he specially alluded to the station of twenty English soldiers on the island, and to the marking out of the limits of the port. • ? % The India Office, whilst again declaring that the India Office, July 30, 1872. Duke of Argyll could not in any way admit the * \ claims of Turkey to sovereignty over Bahrein, promised to institute, inquiries into the matter; and the Turkish Ambassador was informed that the To Musurus Pasha, August 8, • / necessary inquiries should be made, and that his l 87 -- Government might rest assured that it was not the wish of the British Government to interfere in the affairs of the Persian Gulf beyond what was imposed upon it by Treaty, for the preservation of peace in the waters; but it is, perhaps, to be regretted that the clause refusing to recognize the Turkish claim to Sovereignty over Bahrein was not repeated. The Indian Government, however, reported that India Office, April 26, 1873. the acts of Sovereignty said to have been committed by the British authorities were wholly fictitious ; it admitted that the alarm expressed by the Turkish Government might probably have been occasioned (by the survey of the Bahrein reefs and anchorage by the schooner ' Constance,' and from a party of • lascars having been landed, for the purpose of measuring base lines on shore in connection with the marine survey, but it declared that no soldiers had been stationed on the island. The Turkish Ambassador was accordingly informed that there were no grounds whatever for the statement that ^ ■ 1. r31 the British Government had attempted to exercise acts of Sovereignty over Bahrein. In October 1873 another question arose, and this is one which is still engaging the attention of Her Majesty's Government. It had reference to the enforced enlistment of natives of Bahrein into the Turkish army. On the conscription being enforced, the natives of Bahrein sought the intervention of the British Vice-Consul at Bussorah, who informed the Turkish Governor that these people were entitled to protection, and that, not being Ottoman subjects, they w T ere not subject to conscription. The Turkish Governor, nevertheless, obliged the sons of natives of Bahrein to serve in the army, and declined to recognize their right to British protection until he was so instructed from Constantinople. The matter was consequently referred by the Vice-Consul at Bussorah to the British Consul-General at Bagdad, and by him to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Con stantinople. Upon this the Persian Consul inter vened, and claimed these people as Persian subjects. The Turkish Governor informed the Porte that the persons taken as recruits were born n Turkey, their families having emigrated from Bahrein forty-six years previously, since which time they had con stantly resided at Bussorah, and had acquired landed property there. Assuming this statement to be correct. Sir H. Elliot stated that there appeared to him to be no just ground for objecting to the enlistment of the men ; but he, nevertheless, informed Her Majesty's Consul-General at Bagdad that, in the event of his perceiving any disposition on the part of the autho rities to treat natives of Bahrein as though they were the subjects of an Ottoman possession, it would be his duty to protest against it. Sir H. Elliot having brought the subject to the notice of the Ottoman Government, through Mr. E. Pisani, Raschid Pasha ' assured him that the Porte entertained no intention to consider the Bahreinites as its subjects, and promised to write to the Yahi in that sense;'' but in January last Raschid Pasha addressed the following note to Mr. Locock:— ' J'ai pris connaissance des observations pre sentees au nom de I'Ambassade Royale, relative- xcent &amp; un certain nombre d'habitants de Bussorah32 soumis k la conscription et qui seraient originaires de Bahrein. ' Permettez -moi de vous faire remarquer, M. le Charg^ d'Affaires, que ces observations toucbent a une question de principe qui, traitee pr^cedemment entre les deux Gouvernments par I'entremise de I'Ambassade Tmperiale Londres, est r^solue aux yeux de la Sublime Porte. Nous ne pouvons aujourd'hui que nous en tenir aux conclusions de nos communications ant^rieures et Musurus Pacha vient d'etre charg^ de s'en entretenir avec le Prin cipal Secretaire d'Etat de Sa Majesty le Reine.' On the 22nd of the same month Musurus Pasha Musurus Pasha, , . , January 22, 1874. communicated to Lord Granville a telegram which he had received from his Government on the Telegraphic, January s, 1874. subject. A copy of these notes were sent to the India To India Office, . „ February 2, 1874. Office, on the 2nd February, 1874, with a sugges tion that a reply should be returned, reminding the Turkish Ambassador that the explanations given by the Govern or-General of Bagdad as to the circumstances under which the enlistment of the Bahreinites was effected had already been accepted by Her Majesty's Government as satisfactory, and that Her Majesty's Consul-Gencral at Bagdad had been instructed accordingly; and stating that as his Lordship did not consider that it would be wise to pass over in silence the renewed claim to a right of sovereignty over Bahrein, which was implied in the telegram from Raschid Pasha, he proposes to draw the attention of Musurus Pasha to the com munication made to the Porte in 1851 and 18/0 Pages 9 and 21. distinctly stating that Her Majesty's Government did not admit the claim of Turkey to consider Bahrein as a part of the Ottoman Dominions, and that, if natives of that Island applied to British Consuls in Turkey for protection, the latter could not refuse their good offices on behalf of such persons, as being the subjects of a Chief with whom Her Majesty's Government had friendly relations. The Duke of Argyll entirely concurred in this India Office, proposed reply. This letter has not, however, yet I 'ebiuary 10, is&lt; 4. been sent off, and, since its adoption, a copy of a despatch has been received addressed by Colonel Herbert, British Consul-General in Bagdad, to Sir Mr. Locock, No. 20; • H. Elliot, in which he maintains the right of sons Februar &gt; 3 ' pf Bahreinites, not themselves born in Bahrein, to33 IA British protection and exemption from conscription, and request that peremptory orders may be sent by the Porte to the Governor-General to forego all future interference with Bahreinites or their offspring. The answer to be returned is now under consideration ; and the India Office in their last letter, of 3rd March, state :— ' That the Marquis of Salisbury cannot admit the right of the SnbtiTncTHfonTairTorte to exercise any jurisdiction over, or in any way interfere with, the inhabitants of Bahrein, a claim which Her Majesty's Government, in whatever shape advanced, have all along repudiated.' It would appear, then, from the foregoing short historical outline, that both Turkey and Persia, have, on many occasions during the present century claimed the right of sovereignty over the Island of Bahrein ; That, with regard to the Turkish cldim, the British Government, in 1839, 1848 ? and 1851, refused to recognize such claim ; That, with regard to the Persian claim, the British Government, in 1844, 1851, 1862, and 1869, also refused to recognize her claim ;_and. That, in 1861, an understanding was come to between the Indian Government and the Foreign and India Office, that Bahrein should be regarded as independent, and as subject neither to Turkey nor Persia which understanding still exists. It is true that, in 1861, the Persian Government was informed that the British Government would not, in ordinary cases, take any hostile proceedings in future against the Sheikh of Bahrein with out previously informing the Persian Government, although it reserved to itself the right of taking prompt action if necessary, without such reference, and that this promise was appealed to by Persia, in 1871, in support of her assertion that the British Government had acknowledged the Persian right of sovereignty over the Island, but no such right has ever been acknowledged, whilst Persia overlooks the fact that she, on her part promised, in 1861, to take steps to suppress Piracy in the Persian Gulf, which she has never done. The British Government has no designs on the [234] K34 Island ; but in the interests of peace and commerce, as well as with a view to prevent the re-establish ment of the system of Piracy and Slave Trade which hitherto existed in these waters, and which has led to the frequent interference of the British Govern ment and the conclusion of Treaties with the Arab Chiefs, including the Sheiks of Bahrein, it would gee page 23. appear to be as important now as it ever was, that neither the claim of Turkey or Persia to sovereignty over the Island of Bahrein should be recognized by the British Government; for, were the exercise of British influence to be withdrawn from those waters, no Power would be at hand to sup press either Piracy or the Slave Trade, and those scourges would, therefore, be revived, to the serious prejudice of our Indian trade, and to the hindrance of civilization.
