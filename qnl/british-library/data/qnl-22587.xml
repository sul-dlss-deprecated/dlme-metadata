When in Dohah discussions proceeded with the 3halkh 9 and we have advanced oonsid rahly froa the u PA position as reported in our letter No.72-s/7 of 2nd August 1936 to &gt;au. It was not, however, possible to reach a final conclusion, as certain points arose which had to be referred to our London Principals for exaisina- tion and decisioo, aaa it was therefore agreed with the Shaikh to refer these points 'by telegraa to our London irrincipals and to convey tueii reply tc him as soon as possible, with a view to early conclusion of these discussions. The Shaikh extended every courtesy ana consideration to our representative, and appears desirous of concluding an agreement with us at an early date. It has now been decided that Er.Chisholia must visit London for discussion of the rei&amp;aining points outstanding between tbe obaikh and ourselves, leaving 3asrah by Imperial Airways on 9tti November, ^e are sending our Kiraa Juma to ^Atar to Inform the Shaikh tbat our resumption of discussions with him will there- lore oe slightly delayed, but that we look forward to tfceir resumptl^n t and hope for a successful conclusion, at an/ early date.

D/0 72 - JD/7, 7tli KoTeaber 1923. My dear Powle, I enclose official letter to you on the latest stage of our negotiations with the Shaikh of ^a.ar. In view of the Jhaikh f 8 recent visit to Idymdh it has hean satisfactory to find that he shows no signs of wishing to keep us out of his territory until after August next,' when, on the conclusion of our current agraement with hiffi, he mi&amp;ut oe aDie to Invite otuei paxtieb, such as the iiasa Oonoessionaires, to Tsid for his conoession. I have not mentioned in my ofticial letter a matter which Ohisholm mentionea to Colonel Loch in iiahrain on his return from 4atar, This was that terore commencing discussions in Dohah on 16th October, the Shaikh showed to Ohisholm a letter whfch he had received a few days before frcxm the Political Besident concerning his negotiations. This letter simply advised the Shaikh on behalf of H.ii.Gr. that there are certain points in our proposed draft Concession which must he altered. The Shaikh professed to he perturbed at such a letter, which, addressed to him, appeared to imply that he haa done something wrong, and requested Ohisholm to inform him whether he \the ShaikhJ was making an agreement with H.M.a. or the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Chisholm advanced the view that the purpose of the letter was purely to remaind the jhaikh that, in consequence of his agreements with , no agreement between himself and ourselves(or any other Company) for a concession, could 03 finally binding until it had been approved by •*.£.; and that what should be done was for'the Shaikh and himself to agree terms, if possible, which would be binding if H.M.G. did not advise the shaikh that altera tions should be maae. This explanation ultimately satisfied the Jhaikh and discussions proceeded, but the wording of the letcer which, as far as Ohisholm can recollect, stated that certain alterations 'must be maQe% aaa had an unfortunate efiewt on bh*&gt; ^aaikh. Up to date neither our London Office nor otrselves have heard of any alterations being required by H.&amp;.G. in our proposed draft Concession, which, as you know, was submitted to them in London in kay or early June last. If it is possible for me to be informed of what such alterations are, I should be very pleased to receive them. I should be most g ateful also if you could let me kflow how, under H.k'.G.'s existing relations with the shaikh, we stand in regard to the following points raised by him.li -2 (1) If we operate in Qatar, we shall reguire to engage from the Shaikh, certain guards and watchmen, some of whom will he armed. I Imagine practically every man in Qatar has a firearm of some sort, 'but the Shaikh has requested, iX he has not sufficient arms for guards required hy us, whether we can supply the necessary rifles and amraunition. Could you inform me if we are tied in any way in dealing with such a request? (2) We have asked that the prevailing text of any agreement with the Shaikh should he the Snglish text; the Shaikh objects to this, and states that his agreements with are in Arabic only, or that the Arabic prevails. Is this correct? (3) The Shaikh wants it defined that, if operating in . t atar, the Company will remove any employee who is ohj ectiona'ble to him, and that any dispute between a foreign employee of the Company and one of his subjects should he referred to him for settlement, ^e are anxious to meet these requests as far as possible, bub I shoula like to know what, if any,agreements he has with K.^.G. regard ing jurisdiction over British nationals or foreigners generally before committing myself.

Sir, Further to previous correspondence regarding our nego tiations with H•£. the Shaikh of ^atar we now have the honour to report the latest stage dn these negotiations, which ftawt «5 as follows. ;'r. Chisholn arrived in Dohah on 15th December, and discussions took place with the Shaikh on 16th, 17th and 18th December. It was explained that as the result of our previous discussions we had redrafted the general terms of our proposals so as to cover various points which the 3haikh wished to have included in them, and we had also decided to offer him cash terms considerably in excess of those previously offered. At the Shaikh's request Mr. Chisholm gave him an Arabic trans lation of our proposed new general terms (as forwarded to you under cover of our letter GM/1327 of 16th December) omitting Article 4 which concerned only the ca^h terms; as regards the cash terms Mr. Chisholm also communicated to the Shaikh the figures which we were now prepared to offer. The attitude adopted by the Shaikh however was, while admitting the length to which we had gone to meet him as regards both general and cash terms, to refuse any offer which did not embody to the full the very large demands made by him at our October discussions. He made quite plain his opinion T,hat, if we would not accept his terms, there were other parties who would be ready to do so on the expiry on 26th August 1934 of our current agreement with him. As the Shaikh could not be persuaded to abandon this attitude, Mr. Chisholm suspended negotiations and returned to Abadan on 21st December. The Shaikh, while expressing regret that agreement could not yet be reached, and stating that unless his demands could be accepted in full it v&amp;s unnecessary for our representative to revisit ^atar, said that he would be glad to receive and consider any communications received from us. We have reported on this situation to our London Principals and will inform you in due course of any further developments.

Draft record of meeting hela at the India Office on Thursday, 14th December, to consider the A.P.O.G.re- draft of the C^tar Concession. Present ; Ivlr. Laithv^aite In the Chair. Mr. C.F.A. Warner ) Mr. K.3. Johnstone) Foreign Office. Mr. Seal ) Optain E.L.S. King )Admiralty. M.V.O., 3.N.) Mr. F.C. Starling Petroleum Department. Mr. Cronibie India Office. Ivlr. Laithwaite recalled that the meeting had oeen arranged at short notice to enable Departments to consider what amendments were desirable in the redraft of the C^atar concession, of which copies had been circulated hy the A.P.O.C. at the meeting at the India Office on 11th December. It was proposed that it should he followed the same afternoon by a further meeting between Messrs. Fraser and Hearn of the A.F.O.C., at which Mr. Starling and Mr. Laithwaite, in the light of the views expressed by the Departments, could indicate in general terms the directions in which it was desired to. amend their draft. It would of course be impossible to commit H.M.G. in any way on the major question of assignment. Neither on this question, nor, inaeed, on the details of the draft, had instructions yet been taken from higher authority. But if amendments not raising points of principle, but representing improvements from our point of view, could he secured in the draft in the course of discussion with the Company's representatives, no difficulty would presumably be seen. The/z. The other Departments concerned expressed their general agreement,in particular as to the avoiding importance of/any commitment on the question 01 assignment or safeguards. The meeting then proceeaed to consider the revised draft put forward oy the Company. Prearnole . It was agreed that no question arose on this. article 1 . Attention was arawn to the fact that one revised article gave exclusive rights 'throughout the State of c^atar.' The area involved was, so far as could he estimated, something over 3,000 square miles. It was decided that no objection need he taken to the grant of an exclusive concession to the Company and that it was unnecessary to require that the rights of exploration, prospecting and mining should he specified in separate schedules. The Petroleum Department drew attention to thefact that the article as revised gave the Company the exclusive right to 'carry away' the substances which it was entitled to secure, hut saw no objection to this. Mr. Laithwaite said that the Government of India had sent a reminder to the Political Resident on the question of the boundaries of Qcctar. Iftiis question was raised by the Company it would be better not to commit ourselves. We coula wait to see what map tney produced. Article 3 . The following points were raised: (a) the desirability of making provision to safeguard the position of aerodromes* It was agreed that this should be put to the Company, though the decision was complicated by the fact that we had not yet acquired a permanent site. In reply to a question by Mr. Laithwaite as to the probability of any special Admiralty/Admiralty interest developing in connection with harbours, Captain King expressed the opinion that it was unnecessary to rrake special provision ior this at the present time. S//U m j (t)) It was not clear whether the words 'any such normal extensions tnereof' referred to extensions of tiuiluings, though this was presun^oly the case. It was agreed that the Company should he asked to make the position clear, but tnat no objection need be raised if the assumption stated was correct. (.c) The phrase at the end of sub-paragraph 1 'and am subsequent extensions thereof' appeared dangerously wide. We were dealing with a period of 75 years and it was conceivable that difficult political problems might arise if the 3beikh or one of his successors were, e.g., to conquer a portion of Saudi Arabia or,to take an extreme case, to occupy Bahrein. It was agreed that the Company should be invited to omit the words. (d) £3 riod of agreement . No objection was seen to an agreement for 75 years, although this period was longer than that of the Bahrein ana Persian concessions. (e) The Petroleum Department said that it was unnecessary to specify areas for mining purposes under this article now that it was proposed to tive the Company rights over the whole area of the state. (f) Attention was drawn by the India Office to the fact that in a semi-civilized area such as Qatar it would be necessary for the Company to walk extremely warily in anything which might offend religious susceptibilities. We should find ourselves faced with responsibility for safeguarding their interests in the event of serious trouble breaking out and it would be well/I 47 4. well to impress upon them tne aellcacy of the position. The meeting agreed and thought that this might oe put ^ to the Company as a general point in connection with the concession. Article 5 . The Petroleum Department suggested that it would oe desirable further to safeguard tne interests of the Sheikh by amplifying this article on the general ^ lines of Articles 12A and 13 of the A.P.CuC.'s Persian concession. The effect would be to require the Company to preserve the deposits of petrol, if any, and to utilise the latest scientific methods in their operation; It was agreed that this should be put to the Company. thai Article 4 . This article was likely to be/of the greatest importance to tne Sheikh. The Foreign Office expressed the view that, subject to consideration of our own interests and tnose of the Sheikh, it was desirable to meet the A.P.O.C. so far as possible in view of the undesirability of bringing in American interests if this could be nelped. The petroleum Department agreed, and the Admiralty said that they thought their higher authorities would probably c^lso agree, subject to the reservations in question, as aid Mr. Laithwaite. Mr. Laithwalte saia that the Company haa already made it clear that they did not wish to disclose their bargaining figures at the moment and we could not very well press them to do so. On tne other hand, it would be material,in considering the terms to be accepted, that under the present concession they were to receive an exclusive licence in respect of the whole area of Qatar - some 3,000 square miles. Iv!r. starling saiu that the use of the phrase 'exported from or sola for consumption in' raised an important point. This formula was one which had been used in the Persian concession. The effect would be to make/make it possifele for the Company to use locally, to waste, or to lose in refining locally, as much oil as tney might think fit. He had regariea the point as so material that ne had taken the instructions of higher authority on it. As a result he expressed the opinion that it was unnecessary to take exceotion to it, so long finaneial as the/terms offered by the Company proved adequate, though it seemed desiraole that the Sheikh should fully understand what was involved. Article 5 . In the light of Mr. Starling's statement on Article 4 it was agreed that no question neea oe raisea as to the use of the words 'exported from or sola for consumption in' instead of some phrase such as 'produced'. Article 6 . (a) It was agreed that it would be desirable to make the provisions of this article the specifically subject to/compensation provisions of Article 7 (as in the case of Article 2 of the revised draft). (b) Considerable discussion took place as to the risks involved in giving the Company an absolute right, as in the terms of the article, in any circumstances, to construct communications, railways, refineries, etc. The meeting were reminded of the difficulties which had arisen in Hasa in connection with the provision of landing grounds for aeroplanes, ana elsewhere in Saudi Arabia in connection with wireless. Local prejudices and the danger of inflaming the Bedouin had been alleged by Ibn Saud as a reason for postponing action or refusing concessions. If similar difficulty arose in ^atar our position, if it proveo. necessary for us to intervene in support of the Company, might be difficult/aii'ficult. On the otner nana, the Company would clearly unci t require some clear understanding/they had liberty to erect ^ such huilaings, etc. as were essential for their purpose, e.g. refineries, pumping stations, harbours, pipelines, workshops, etc. Tne meeting was inclinea to think that the simplest course might be to draw a distinction between constructions of this nature and corrrnunications taken in a broad sense - wireless, roads, railways, etc. - and that in discussions with tne Company we should aim in the first place at making the Company's rights under the first sub paragraph of tne article subject 'to the agreement of the Sheikh which shall not be unreasonably withheld', and if endeavour to this proved impossible to/make a special exception in respect of comnunications ana wireless, putting them on a different footing from the technical builaings required by the Company. It was thought that here, as in the case of Article 2, the importance of aslking extremely carefully, having regard to local conditions might be impressed on the Company. Article 7 . (a) It was agreed that the desirability of specifically safeguarding the position of any aerodromes acquired by us in Qatar shoula be considered in connection with this article. (b) Attention was drawn to the possibility that considerable areas might be in the possession,not of the Sheikh, but (as appeared in the past to have been the case elsewhere on the Arab littoral) of the Jowasimi Arabs. That was, however, a point for the Company* (c) The second sub-paragraph was too widely stated and aia not sufficiently safeguard private possessors against expropriation at the request of the Company. It was agreed that the Company snoula be invited either to adopt/7. &amp; © r. L adopt a wording on the general lines o£ article 4(ti)( 3 ) of their Persian concession or to revise the first sentence of the sub-paragraph to run as follows;- 'x^ny other lands, houses or huildings required by the Company may he bought or leased by it with the consent of and on conditions to be arranged with the proprietors thereof, but the terms of such -purchase or lease shall not be in excess...' (d) The phrase 'such land shall at all times be less than the whole area of ^atar' caused some surprise, but was assumed to have been inserted at the request of the Sheikh. Article 8 . It was agreed that the Company should be invited to insert in the second sentence of the first sub-paragraph the words 'subject to the same proviso'. Article 10 . (a) Some discussion took place as to the desirability of fixing a maximum period during which the general customs exemption granted to the Company shoula run. The general feeling of the meeting was, however, in favour of letting the article stand, particularly now that the Company had to some extent met us by agreeing to pay duty on food supplies, personal goods, clothing and general merchandise imported by it for the personal use of its employees. (b) The question was raised of the desirability of giving the Company complete exemption in respect of harbour aues. The meeting felt that as any harbours made would be developed by the Company, it would be unreasonable to request them to pay harbour dues. On the other hand it would be worth ensuring that they would agree to the free use of such harbours by the Sheikh. Goods imported by private individuals through such harbours/8. harbours would of course be liabla ior arxy ordinary import auty charged, but it would be unreasonable to give the Sheikh the right to charge harbour dues in audition in respect oi trie importation of such goo as- article II &gt; attention was drawn to the correspondence which had taken place between the Political Resident and Air. ^1 Kington, ana also to the fact that under Article 3 of the Qatar Treaty of 1916 the sheikh was precluded from obtaining arms, save under arrangements therein aefined, to be made and approved by H.Ivi.G. It was agreed that tne Resident's view in the matter, as expressed in paragraph 3CU of his letter aated &lt;i4th November to Lr. Elkington, shoula be accepted. ^ -te article 12 . Assignment . ^iT^wa^recognised that this article raised fundamental questions and that no decision could be taken on it except after reference to higher authority. On the other hand it seemed desirable so far as possible to clear the ground with a view to exploring how far the Company were in fact prepared to go and what their intentions were in the matter. It had throughout oeen appreciated that as the A.P.O.G. were conducting as agents negotiations in Qatar only/on behalf of the I.P.O., which was itself an international Company containing only a relatively small British element, it would not be possible in practice to insert full British safeguards or provision for full British control in the concession granted. Iwr. Seal said that the Admiralty were of opinion that it would be desirable to insert the following safeguards in any assignment: (a) The assignee company to be registered in Great Britain; (b) The Company's office in Great Britain to be run by a British subject; (c)/(c) British director; (d) Chief Local Hepresantative to he persona grata to H.iuG, and. a British subject. Of these, they woula like (a), (h) and (a) to appear in the concession itself. Starling suggested thatwe might provide that the Company should he ana remain a British Company registered in Great Britain, having its place of business m Great Britain and a British Chairman, on the same lines as the I.P.C. Lr..Laithwaite said that might he possible, out that he thought the India Office would he content (if tills was found to he ana woula ease matters) sufficiently legally watertight/ to cover certain of these points in an exchange of letters with the Company, particularly the point aoout the Chief Local Representative. It seemed aesirahle also to provide that the sheikh should approve the conditions of transfer. Ivlr. 3eal saia that the Admiralty were anxious that they should he in a position to acquire or buy the oil produced in time of war, and he was anxious therefore that there should be no reassignment to .American interests. Mr. Starling drew attention to the aifficultie of entirely safeguarding the position when we were dealing with an international company such as the I.P.C. Ivir.Seal agreed that it was desirable to make provision that the consent of the Sheikh ana approval of the conditions of assignment shoula be included. Mr. Warner suggested that in so many wards the simplest course might be to meet the Company/as regards transfer to the I.P.C. if that was the point which they had principally in mind in the first sentence of the article ana then make provision to safeguard our position in the event of any reassignment.

Laithwaite said that it might dusirable to emphasise to the A.I .O.G, representatives that while we ware prepared to regard their draft concession as generally satisfactory (subject to their meeting us over assignment, etc.) they were not to assume that if negotiations between the A#?.O.C# and the Sheikh broke down we were in any way permanently committed to these terms, it other competitors came into the field the competitive offers put up would have to be considered one against another.

The meeting agreed. t^.clu jo . Lr. Laithwaite said tnat the India Office on general political grounds regarded it as undesirable that the third arbitrator should be nominated by the Gouru of International Justice at The Hague. They Vv 'ould LiUch prefer the Political Resident (on whom this responsibility had devolved in the original draft). Die meeting agreed that this should be put to the Company. article r? . (a) It was pointed out that this gave us no guarantee as to nationality of any non-Asiatic loreigners who might be introduced. Secondly, that ooi ious political difficulties might well arise if the Company were to import, say, Bahreinis or Iraqis, to operate the Qatar concession, on the ground that the wages aemanded locally were unreasonably high. It was agreed uhat tne Company should be invited to consider the omission of the words 'or demand unreasonable wages'. On the •iamotion oi nationality of non-Asiatic employees, Mr.Fraser ^ iloaa y it clear tnat they coula not conrnit themselves and it seemed difficult, important as the point was, to do more than had been done in Bahrein and endeavour uo secure that as large a proportion as possible shoula be British. (b)/. . 12 - iVr, Laithvvciit e saia that (b) / is article' raised the difficult question of Jurisdiction. The Company had maae it clear that they were not'prepared to accede to the Sheikh's request that disputes between its employees and his subjects should 'be aecidea by him and it would probably be necessary to reach some agreement with him over the cession to H.M.G. of his Jurisdiction over foreigners, though this was likely to be by no means easy. fcr. said that here as in the case of Articles 2 and 7, it was necessary to bear in mind the possible responsibility with which we might find ourselves- burdened in connection with the protection of / foreign employees etc. in Qatar, .ana the contingent risk of foreign interference if we proved unable to safeguard their position adequately, hx. Lathwaite expressed agreement and said that if the concession was developed it seemed likely that we might have to consider some time in the future trie appointment of a political officer to Qatar. Article 1q . A similar article appears in the A.P.O. Persian concession and it. was agreed that while its meaning was obscure it was unobjectionable. article ^0 . The Political Resident had expressed the opinion that a careful Arabic text might at a pinch suffice. Tne Foreign Office intimated that the point was probably of less general importance to them than if we had been dealing with the question of a treaty, but it would be well that we should not finally commit ourselves to the Company upon it. INDIA OFFICE. 15th December 1933.&amp; India Off ice CONFIDENTIAL ?.Z.3066/33 Final Reccr:! of meeting held at the India Office on the 11th Deceir /c er tc discuss oil in Kov/ei t' and Qatar . There were present:- Mr. L.D.Wakely in the Chair, Mr, G.W.Rendel Mr. C.. .A. : .7arner ) Foreign Office, Mr , K.H. J ohnst one ) Mr. F.C.Starling, Petroleum Department.

Deputy Chairman, Anglo- u Persian Oil Company. -ir. -.earn ^ Anglo-Persian Oil Company Mr. Y/akely said that Mr. Fraser and Mr. Hearn, of the -.r.O.C. had, he understood, been good enough to offer to attend meeting at which they could explain to the interested departments -he position and policy of the A.P.O.C. in the Gulf. The Company 'ere of course aware of the general position, which was that the sheikhs concerned were precluded from granting any oil concessions /ithout the prior concurrence of II.LI.G. who had, while paying pecial attention to the interests of those Rulers to consider applications for concessions from all points of view. A statement rom the Company would, he felt, be of much assistance. Mr , Fraser explained in the first place that in Qatar he A.P.O.C. were precluded from acting on their own behalf and ould act only as the agents of the Iraq Petroleum Company since atar was within the area covered by the I.P.C.Convention. Any oncession would, however, if granted by the Sheikh, be in the name of the/the*A.P.O.C. They had reason to believe that the Standard Oil Company of California, a purely American Company who had already obtained a footing in the Gulf at Bahrein and at Kasa, were also interested in Qatar, The Sheikh of Qatar had entered into an agreement with the A.P.O*C. expiring in August 1934 during the currency of which the A.P.O.C* had the right to apply for concession giving them sole rights to work oil in Qatar and the Sheikh had undertaken not to consider the grant of an oil concession to anyone other than the A.P.O.C. This would not prevent the Standard Oil Company of California from making suggestions to the Sheikh meanwhile and thus making things difficult foi the A.P.O.C. in their negotiations. Those negotiations had proceeded some distance this autumn, and Mr f Chisholm, the A.P.O.C. representative, had returned home to report progress in November. The Sheikh had, however, now suddenly and quite spontaneously inuimated that he wished to see the A.P.O.C. representative by the 14th of this month for the purpose of further discussion and Mr-Chisholm was already on his way out to Qatar by air with a revised draft concession. The Political Resident would, of course, be consulted regarding the terms of the concession but the A.P.O.C. were anxious if possible to avoid the delay which would result if the Political Resident had to refer home for instructions on every point which might arise during the negotiations. Mr.Fraser suggested that a great deal of time might be saved if H.M.G. would consent to give their blessing in advance to the general terms of the revised concession subject to any reasonable modifications which they might desire to make, and which could be the subject of informal discussion ^ Ler T|p &gt; p raser3. Fir. Fraser then circulated copies of the draft concession which Mr. Chisholm was t e&amp;ing out to Qatar. I.Ir. 'aliely suggested that the draft could hest be considered department ally- in the first instance, and this was agreed, Mr. Fraser, hov/ever, emphasising the anxiety of the Company that it should he dealt, with as expeditiously as possible. Mr. Fraser then turned to the activities of the A.P.O.C. in Koweit. Here the position v/as different since Koweit was outside the area covered by the l.P.C. Convention. For some time past the A.P.O.C. and the American Gulf Oil Company had both been negotiating for a concession in Koweit, but hitherto the had been unable to reach any agreement with the Sheikh. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company were most anxious that there should not be a rival foreign oil concern in Koweit on the ilank of their own operations in Persia and this was why they had themselves wanted to obtain a concession in Koweit. They had all along felt themselves at a great disadvantage in negotiating at Koweit in competition with the Gulf Oil Company, a very wealthy concern, owing to tne danger that by granting too favourable terms to Ko^eit they might involve themselves in difficulties with tne Persian GoVwinm^nt -/ho mi^ also accuse them of frittering away their energies outside Persia. They had therefore considered it desirable to endeavour to make an arrangement v/ith the Gulf Oil Company. An arrcviigernent of nature which fully safeguarded the interests of the A.P.O.C., work jointly with them for a concession through a new company be formed on a 50/50 basis, had been signed, and now only awaited ratification, a decision as to which was expected thio \The negotiations with the Sheikh if the agreement in question was ratified would be carried on by Mr. Gass, acting on behalx of the A.P.O.C., and assisted by Major Holmes, on behalf of the Gull Oil/Oil Company. He pointed out that the Gulf Oil Company was one of the parties interested in the I.P.C. through the American portion of the shares of the latter, while the Standard Oil Company of California was not. On this point Mr. Eraser explained that the A.P.O.C. felt that they had a legitimate grievance against the 'behaviour of American oil interests in this area since the war. When, after the TCar, the Americans and the French were admitted to participation in the I.P.C, the A.P.O.C. had understood that the American oil interests would then be satisfied with their share in the I.P.C. This, however, had not 'been so, since the Standard Oil Company of California had later appeared and obtained oil concessions in Bahrein and Hasa; they now threatened to come in also at Q^tar. The Standard Oil Company of California (now established in Bahrein and Hasa) was an entirely different Company from the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (interested in the Iraq Petroleum Company) but there were occasions when these large American groups appeared to v/orlv in sympathy with one another. Mr. Fraser suggested that the position would be very much simplified and delay avoided if the same procedure could be followed here as he had suggested in Qatar, i.e. if H.M.G. would be good enough to examine the draft concession at this end and make suggestions before it was presented to the Sheikh, He sincerely trusted that the Company could look for the support of His Majesty's Government. Mr.. Eraser then offered to give further exp 1 anat ions/explanations on any points in connection with either Qatar or Koweit which the meeting might wish to raise, » w akely said that subject to the opinion of the meeting he thought there might be advantage in informal discussion such as the Company had suggested of the terms of draft concessions. This procedure had been adopted with advantage in the case of Bahrein, But it was important not to short-circuit the authorities in the Gulf. Mr, Walton and Mr, Laithwaite said that H.1*1,0• and the Resident both felt that they had been kept rather in the dark regarding the details and the course of the A,P,0,C,negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatar, In particular they had no clear idea of the financial terms which were being offered to the Sheikh for the concession, , Fraser said that it was difficult to arrange the financial terms at this end and thought that this side of the matter could best be settled in the negotiations betv/een their representative and the Sheikh of Qatar, He could assure the meeting, however that the financial terms were likely to be not ungenerous to the Sheikh, They might indeed have to be rather too generous from the A,P,0,C.point of view, since the Standard Oil Company of California had paid a very large sum for their concession in Hasa and this could not be without effect on their own negotiations. Jjlr. Starling said that the Petroleum Department would favour the adoption of Mr. Eraser's suggestion for informal preliminary discussion in London of points arising out of the draft Qatar concession but that if they were to give their opinion about any concession whether in Qatar or Koweit they would of course have to have some idea of the financial terms since in some cases it was impossible to form an opinion whether the terms of a concession were fair without having this information. Mr. Hearn (A,P,0,C,)reminded the meeting that Ramazpn started/6. started on the 11th December. The A.P.O.G. representative was due to c«rrive in Q^tar on the 14th so that It the 3heik;h really intended to luake progress vath the negotiations for a concession there would be very little time to spare. Mr. uatnwaite said that it was relevant tnat the Company's application for a concession in -^atar raised certain political issues which could not be disposed of without consultation with India and the Resident, which would take time, e.g. the issue of jurisdiction, which with the Company the Sheikh had already raised/ and the bringing into force of certain dormant articles of the Sheikh's Treaty. kr. Eraser saia the Company had no intention of agreeing to tne exercise of jurisdiction by the Shaikh over their employees. Ivr. .{enael suggested that on this point it might help the A.P.O.C. in their negotiations in ^atftr vis-a-vis the standard Oil Company of Olifornia or a.ny other competitor if His to iYajesty's Government were now/point out to the sheikh that certain conditions as regards jurisdiction over employees would apply in the case of any concession which he might grant. Ivir. Hearn saia tnat the A.?»0.0. understood that tine Sneikh haa lately a sice d the political Hesident about the » procedure to be followed if a second Company came along in search of a concession, which seemed to imply that there was a real danger of the standard Oil Company of California coming in at Qatar- • M? ■ Walton referred to Article 12 of tne draft concession circulatea by lv2r. Fraser which provided for the transfer of the concession from the A.P .O.C. to another party and asked what the position was as regards assignment and what the Company haa in mind. Kr.Fraser explained that this provision had been inserted because any/Lis i. 'any concession would have to be h^naed. over to the (in which British interests were represented oy the a»F*C*C » and. hy the Britisn eierueiit in the oheil ^roup) • If a subsidiary conipany were tiion iornied the A»P#0#C» would claim and woula have a percentage of interest in it not less tnan the percentage (23i) of their interest in the Iraq petroleum Company. Sucn a company might, indeed, contain a larger British element than the I,P.C, if, for example, the French interests represented in the latter uid not wish to share in the new operations at ^atar. The A»F.O.C. of course wanted any new company to ce as British as possible and ne remindeo. the meeting that the alternative, that is the standard Oil Company of California, was a purely -american Company. He mentioned that nobody knew now the standard oil Company of California intendea to market the oil which it obtained from Bahrein or Hasa, since tho various Standard groups had njver yet been known to compote with one another in marketing o 3 • Til o Petroleum Dopartruent state that there are several standard Groups/ Mr. Laithwaite asked whether, if tae Qatar concession were handed over to the Iraq petroleum Company the exploitation of the concession would still be British. We attached much importance, both on general grounds and because of tne difficult Question of jurisdiction that might arise, to keeping exploitation here (ana in Koweit) wholly in British handSt Lr. Fraser .said that the personnel of the I.P.C, in Iraq was mostly British, since this had been found convenient by all parties concerned, though in theory the other participants in the I,P,C^ could insist/(&gt;3 8. insist on personnel in proportion to their share interest in the Company. He mentioned that over 52% of the material for the Iraq Petroleum Company pipe line had been ordered from the United Kingdom. He suggested that there was in practice no need for apprehension on the point. It would be better to avoid making specific provision in the concession, since that might lead other nationalities represented in the I.P.C. to claim the percentage to which their holdings entitled them. Turning to Koweit, Mr.Wakelv said he understood that the A.P.O.C. and the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate had first of all been negotiating against one another for a concession and that the latter had resigned their interests to the Gulf Company. The position now was apparently that the A.P.O.C. had entered into an agreement which was signed and merely awaited ratification to obtain and work a concession jointly with the Gulf Oil Company on a 50/50 basis which would extend to exploitation as well as to distribution. Mr. Fraser said this was the case and that his Chairman, Sir John Cadman, had particularly asked him to emphasise at the meeting in case any criticism was raised that this 50/50 arrangement with the Gulf Company had specially received the blessing of H.M.G., before the Company had entered into it. Mr. Wakely said that the India Office had no knowledge of any such approval having been given. MytHen^gl said he understood that the A.P.O.C. had had discussions with certain members of the Foreign Office out that the Foreign Office had understood that the 50/50 arrangement was to cover distribution of the oil only ana not exploitation. Mr.Fraser reiterated that the idea/idea ot a 50/50 arrangement to extend to wXploitation naQ been specl.Ti.caijiy approved 'by H.M.G. He woula if necessary write a letter giving further details ii desired. The arrangement ..ion tne 3-uif oil Company been forced upon tiie a. P.O.G . because it was embarrassing for them uo offer large sums ol money in Koweit (where perhaps there was no oil) in view of possible reactions on the Persian Government. Moreover they understood that the Sheikh himself wished for an international Company. He added that the A.P#O.C. nau also louna that tlirougliout their negotiations the Gulf oil Company through whatever source were kept iiuormed of all the A*P.O#C. offers to the Sheikh and lic^ci in tneir possession full copies of the correspondence that had passed, wnile the A.P.O.C. received no similar information about the offers made oy the Gulf Oil Company. In answer to a question from Lr. Wakely, I wr.Fraser oaia tn^o if they succeeded in reaching an agreement vvith the Gulf oil Company the latter might easily alio v. one personnel at Koweit to be even 100?6 British, but tnat it would not be politic for the A.P.C.C, to suggest any arrangement about personnel to the Gulf uompa,ny cot this stage, since it woula only lead to a counter claim on their part. The A.P.O.C. (as in the ^ c ^ sq oi (^atar) thought it oest to have no provision aoout personnel in their agreement with the Gulf Company. Witn i^gara to the employment of Iv^ajor Holmes, who, he unaerstooa, was not entirely persona to h•M.G., Ivjr. fraser assured the meeting that tneir own representative, Mr. Gass, would take the chief part in the/10. » ^ t/iiG negoti^tiono ^ioil uiiG i^ric/ikli qjqq.

Laithv/ctite said that it would he necessary to consiaer this question separately. It would,he thought, he desirable that all negotiations at Koweit should he conducted solely through the Political Agent. This procedure haa now heen laid down in Bahrein in the negotiations between tne Bahrein Petroleuiii Go Hip any •and the Anglo-Persian Oil Goinpany on the one hand and the sneikh of Bahrein on the other, kr. Eraser said tnat he hoped this proceaure woula not he insisted upon in Qatar and Koweit. Indeed he thought that under these conditions tiie sheikh of Koweit would reiuse to negotiate for a concession at all. The A*I .C.G. would of course gladly keep the political authorities fully in touch with what was going on. Lr. Laitnwaite said thect there was no political Agent at ^atar and that so long as this was the case tnere could he no objection I to airect negotiations between trie A.P»0'#G. ^ana the Siieikh, but he reminded ivir. eraser that this Vi/ould also apply to any coiupetitor who appeared in ^at^r, ana that we coula not discriminate in lavour the A.P.O.G. In Koweit, where there was a political Agent, the position was different and he d^a not ^e^ th^t American interests could object so long as we aid not discriminate against them. Direct negotiations might lead to serious difficulty on certain points. He reminded Lr. Praser tnat the Sheikh was not able to grant/11. grout q , concession wi'0iiout» t&lt;ii(3 conssnt» 01 Fraser said that hitherto the Americans and the Sheikh had oe^n allowed to negotiate direct and that ii that policy were now changed it would have an ex ureiiieij/ 'oad el feet hoth on the Gulf Oil Conipany and on 0116 oheikh. Mr» ^kely said that could not coinnit themselves on this point and that the Departments concerned would have to consider the matter. &gt; .'^Iton asked whether, when the arrangements with the Gulf Oil Company had been completed, the A.PkO.C. would inform E*M.G. of the position. Ivir. Fraser said that if Mr. Walton meant that the A.P.O.G. should show H.M.G. a copy of their agreement with the Gulf Oil Company the a .P«0*C . would have no objection hut he thought that this might be erribarrassirig for H.M.G., who, as I^r. Wakely had explained, had to consider the interests of the Sheikhs. In making their agreement with the Gulf Oil Company the A.P-.O.C. had had in mind the protection of their own interests (in which they haa, he thought, been very successful) ana not those of the Sheikh of Koweit and it might embarrass H.L'#G. in advising the Sheikh if they had previously seen the agreement reached between the A.P-.O.G. ana the Gulf Oil Company* From our standpoint it would no doubt be satisfactory ii the Sheikh received a substantial yearly sum, irrespective of whether the concession was actively operated or not. draft oil concession would, of course, be shown at once to H*M.G«3 In conclusion Iv^r. Fraser again emphasised the anxiety/anxiety 01 the A.P.O.C. thut nothing shoula, if possiole, oe allowed to delay their negotiations at ^atar, ana a ok &amp; cl wne uii 6 r tne De pci jftrne n t s concemed coulu give an opinion aoout the revised A.P.O.C. uiciit concession as soon as possible• He hoped, that H.ivuGr., subject to any reasonudie cinianciiuents tiiat might be agreed here, would feel acle to instruct the Hesiaent to regard it with a favourable eye. kr. Vvakely said that certain major points had been raised which woula have to be carefully gone into; Dut this would be done as expeditiously as possiole. ^very eiiort would also be made to examine tne revised draft Qatar concession without delay. Tne amendments aesired by the Departments concerned could then be discussed with Lr. x^raser by the Petroleum Department and India Office. He wished to repeat that it was the concern of H^vLG. to safe guard the interests of the sheikhs; but that subject to tills and to consiaer^tion of their own special interests ana obligations in the Gulf they were naturally anxious to give any assistance properly possible to British concerns. Lr. Fraser expressed the hope that all possible assistance would be given to the A.P.O.O., and added that he was anxious that the discussion which had taken place should be treated as strictly confidential. This was agreed. It was ^Iso agreed that the Company shoula cable Mr.Chisholm to give a copy of the revisea Qatar concession to the Political Agent, Bahrein on his arrival there, and to arrange that a copy should go by mail to the Political Resident. indli office. 13th December 19o3.n n IriiL.aa iute . P.Z. 7601 /33. INDIA OFFICE, ■ /H11 iLH ALL, S • W • 1. ota December 1933. Iviy dear Starling, iv^y letter of 17th August, P.Z.500^/33, gave our provisional comnento on the ^atar oil agreement put lorwara by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. I now write to say that, save on the points below, we have nothing at this stage to aaa to the criticisms contained in that letter, but that we suggest that it would be desirable, if the Petroleum Department could let us have their general observations in the light of comments of the interested departments and of the Resident before that aate, to try to nave a meeting before the em of this week, perhaps on Friday, 8th December. Would this be possible for you? 2. Our only supplementary comments are on the point raised in paragraph 2(i) of Foreign Office letter of the 29th August, No.£.4794/156/91, which was further discussed in Seal's letter of 29th September, No.M.02517/33. It is, of course, the case that what we had in rnina when my letter of 17th August, P.Z.5002/33, was written, was a clause which/ b oa r 1 ing, h) so,. , Petroleum Department, Lines Department, Dean Stanley street, S.W. 1.~ C, ~ which would preciuae the Iraci Petroleum Company from reassigning the concession to a non-British controlled company. We shall have to consider at our meeting to what extent, if at all, we should endeavour to secure in the present agreement the inclusion of a statement of the conditions subject to which alone we shall be prepared to agree to any further assignment. The main alternatives seem to be as follows;- (a) To provide in the concession that no reassignment shall be permissible {or that no reassignment shall be permissible save with the prior approval of the .Sheikh and subject to such conditions as he may lay down). Hie effect of this would be that the concessionaires, if and when they wanted to reassign, would have formally to submit an application to the Sheikh in reply to which they coula be informed in aetail of the conditions subject to which alone we should be prepared to recommend the Sheikh to agree to an ass ignment. (b ) To set out in detail in the concession the conditions subject to which alone reassignment will be permitted. If we adopt this course (and we should, of course, nave to bear in mind the point taken in paragraph 6/* 1° - 3 - 6 of Admiralty letter of 29th September) there would, I think, he much to he said for improving on the conditions of assignment to which we were forced to agree in the case of tne Bahrein concession, the circumstances of which were, of course, quite different, ana to endeavour to secure, e.g. that any assignee company should he registered in Great Britain (ana not in Great Britain or Canad a) ana possihly that a given percentage of the Board should he British; that the Chief Local Representative should he a British subject, persona ^rata to H.M.G., ana appointed only with their prior approval, and perhaps that the lessees should he required to undertake to refine locally and xo give rights of preemption to the Sheikh or H.IvLG. The a i sad vantage of emho dying our desiaerata in detail in the concession is that in tne lirst place we may conceivably frighten off the A»P»0«C. or the I»P«C. {though given the active interest in oil in tne Persian Gulf which is 'being man if est ea at present i shoula rather douht if the risk was a very serious one if reasonaole financial terms coula he agreed between them ^na the Sheikh) ; secondly that we show our hand as regaras in particular a British control clause ana the right of preemption. I do not know how far consideration of tn8 general/ ■ i11 - 4 - general oil policy 01 H.IU.G., Vvhich we understand has l)een unaer cj 11 siu.ji ^tiori -LOx soine ijiiiie, riao progressed# jiitj it is conceivabl'j that it would he no less embarrassing, hy a detailed description of our desiderata in a concession such as the present, prematurely to disclose ZLiG principles at the estahlishment of which we were aiming, than it would have 'been to have done so in the discussions about Koweit oil which took: place during the summer of this year. (c) The third course as I see it is something on the lines of paragraph 7 of Seal's letter of the 29th September, slightly modified, the general line of the provision in the agreement being that no assignment shall be permissible save to a company registered in Great Britain, on terms to be approved by the Sheikh ana with his prior approval. 4. It is, I suppose, quite impossible to safeguard ourselves against a repetition of what took: place in connection with the Eastern and General syndicate's concessions in Bahrein ana Koweit, e.g. by proviaing not merely that any Assignment ent^rea into in violation of the stipulation referred to in (c) of the preceding/- 5 - preceding paragraph shall he null ana void, but that it shall voia the whole concession? 5. I ao not know ii you are yet in a position to give us material to reply to Fowle's telegram of the 17th Novemoer, ot which copies were sent to you and to Warner 'and ivbore under my letter of 20th November, P.z.7476/33? The Sheikh's attitude, as illustrated by the correspondence received unaer Bushire despatches of 29th October, 1761-3, and C. 138 of loth November, is not, I think, altogether satisfactory. 6.

On the other hand, they are anxious for exemption in respect not only of material for the purposes of their technical operations and for office equipment, but also for 'household furniture'.

It was now proposed, after discussion with the Company's representatives, to invite the •overnment of India, if they saw no objection, to undertake 'Ih© necessary work, on a repayment basis so that full control for any buoys laid would be s©cured ta Government. The Company had intimated that the Standard Oil Company 01' California had placed an expert party at their disposal who would arrive in London fr«m the U .S .A. tn 4th January en rout® for Bahrein to deal with the question of the laying of the proposed submarine pipeline and the connected questions of laying moorages and floats. The meeting took note of the position. The meeting resumed consideration or the revised oil concession comnunieat.a informally by the A .P .O.O. on 11th Deoemher 1933, in the light of the record of the discussion which had taken place with the representatives of the Company on 14th Decemher, (p.Z.8i31&lt;s/33)- M-r&gt;-t. ih ithwaite said that t ie A.P.O.C. were pressing for the earliest possible inaication of any amendments that H.U.U. .night desire, in the interests of facilitating mr .Chisholm's negotiations in Qatar, and had been anxious for information before Christmas. That was impossible, out « J -vflhie to let them have a letter it seem .d desirable to ieu The meeting agreed. early next week. It/It was agreed that it would be best lirst to consider the general procedure to be adopted in negotiating with the Company and the Sheikh; secondly, the supplementary amendments, if any, to be suggested to the Company in Articles •!' the revised draft concession other than Article 12; thirdly, Article 12 and the connected questions of British control, exclusive British exploitation of any concession granted (though this point stictly arjse on Article 17), and the maintenance of a British Chief Local Representative of the Company in Qatar. The India Office wished to suggest consideration in this connection of certain special restrictions, arisirt: - -it zi political conditions in Qatar, wh.'.ch 'vcui apply to all Companies applying for concessions whatever their nat.LOii&amp;j.^ III. A«Procedure* On the question of pro^-^'ar^, Mr.Laithwaite saia that as the A.P.O.o. tfer apparently willing to cover certain points or special interest to H.M.G. in an exct-inge lettei'S (which must or course be o* character binding on the Company and on any transferees or assignees), the simplest course, in the light or previous informal discussion with the Foreign Of rice, and subject &lt;-0 views of the meeting, appeai-ed ^.c je that there should be : (a) an agreement between the Company and .he Sheikh which should be purely commercial xn character, possibly on th« gen «raT Ixnes revised/4. rLVibed clrui t- concession vi /hicli xjib Company had. now suomi ctea, v/ith such modification oi Ai'ticle 12 and such minor amendments in other articles as might be thought necessary; (h) a subsidiary agreement between the A.P.Q.C. ana H.M.G. to cover matters of interest primarily to H.M.G. and the Company, rather than to H.M.G. and the Sheikh, or to the Company and the Sheikh, and to deal essentially v /ith political points. This agreement, which should be binding not only on the Company, but on any assignee or transferee company,could be either an exchange of letters or a formal agreement, 'oerhaps preferably the latter- The I Company ai the discussion on 14th December haa indicated their readiness to deal with certain points of this character in an exchange of letters- Such an agieement could cover e.g. safeguards for aerodromes and seaplane bases, daieguards ior wireless and other communications, undertakings by the Company that they would pay due deference to the advice of our political representatives and the views oi the Sheikh, possibly (a point to be aiscussed later in connection with Article 12 of the revised draft Concession), exclusive Bri,t..sh exploitation of any concession, the appointment of a British Chief Local Representative, etc. Apart fr-m the points covers by (a) and (b), closer examination of the problem/problem had. shov/n that t he grant of my oil concession hy xhe Sheikh, whether t« the A.p.O.C., the I.P.G., or an American Company, would give rise to difficult political problems in connection with jurisdiction over the concessionnaire's employees, the grant of protection by H.M.G. in cases in which local conditions made this necessary and the Sheikh ror any reason failed t« afford it, and, probably, the appointment of a political Agent to represent H.M.G. and would make it necessary t# consider bringing into force certain articles or the Sheikh's Treaty of 1916 which were at present aormant* Such questions could best be dealt with in a third agreement or exchange of letters between the Sheikh and H.M.G-. Considerable difficulty might be anticipated in disposing of them: and if we were to take them up with the Sheikh and try to reach a general understanding with him on political points, it might be thought desirable tc take the opportunity also to secure the air facilities in Qatar which the Sheikh had hitherto refused to give save in return for guarantees of protection which H.M.G. were not prepared to undertake# Mr.Rendel said that, speaking personally, he was entirely in favour of a procedure such as had baen described. Higher authority at the Foreign Oil ice not or course yet been consulted. But action on these lines would, he was confident, be consistent with th£ir general view/IcA g- 6. view a3 at present aavisea; which was that, so long as the interests of H.M.Q. and or the Sheikh were adequately safeguarded, nothing should be aone which would tend to hamper the conclusion or an agreement 'between the Sheikh and the A.P.O.C, in the immediate ruture. Delay would inevitably increase the risk that the Standard Oil Company of Calirornia might actively interest themselves in obtaining the concession. Were they once to enter the iield, they could rely on the active support of t he U.S. Government, ana however strong the case on merits ftr any special conditions which H.M-G. mi ( ht be anxious to secure in respect or British control, British exploitation, British local representation &amp;c., we should almost certainly rind it much more difficult to have our way on such points when dealing with a wholly foreign company backed by the U. . Government than when dealing witk a company such as the Iraq x-^etroleum Company in which there was a substantial British element. The procedure proposed, wita an important proviso which the Foreign Oiiice had already r ecommended to the India Office, would make it possible lor the A.P.0.0. pursue negotiations immediately with the Sheikh with a view to reaching agreement on commercial points, - such an agreement tt contain no clauses of a political chaiactei as provision for jurisdiction &amp;c. While nego tiations/7. negotiations were in progress, we could separately discuss with the Company the points tote covered in the proposed Agreement between the Company and while iht: local political authorities, after consultation with H .M.G. and the Government of India, coula press on with a settlement or the points in issue oetweai H .M.G. and the Sheikh. The proviso to which he had referred, and which if accepted should fully safeguard the special interests of H .M.G., was that a clause should 'be inserted in any commercial agreement between the A.P.O.C. and the Sheikh to the el feet that the Agreement could not come into force until the consent if H .M .G. haci been obtained t« its provisions. Such a clause merely reaffirmed the Sheikh's existing treaty obligations and ought not therefore t# cause difficulty with him- Vi S _ a -vis the Company it would emphasize the special position of H .M.G# in the matter. Mr.Renael added that in his view it would 'be desii-atole that the conditions to be laid down in respect of British control ana exploitation or any concession, in whatever rorm they niight energe as a result of discussion hy higher authoiity, and necessary of reference to the Cabinet, should he conditions which would apply not merely t&gt; a British concessionaire but to any other Company, of whatever nationality, which nig endeavour to secure a concession in Qatar. We had not yet thought out in d.tail at what conditions it would he desirable to aim, the questions/He thought that it was essential that the main lines of the agreement with H.M.G. should be communicated to the Company in the very near future, in order to avoid any suggestion that the Company had been allowed to proceed with the commercial agreement with the Sheikh on false pretences: also that if any difficulty were to \ experienced in getting the Sheikh Jo agree to our terms it would be important to devise some means of avoiding the impression that pressure was being brought to bear upon him in the Interests of the A.P.O.C. questions inv need careful therefore be A .P.O.C. what be. But so could bd comir delay, and that whatever finally laid application, their difficu the Sheikh or Mr. Se judge, the I stated by Mr, to the procec Mr. Ls Office fully Mr. Rendel h£ great imports to be laid dc be well to gj idea of the r which Kis Ma; to require wlr our conments generally, they should 1 concluded on: if such an a^ only and con-i discussed, the A.P .O.C. with the She:8. He thought that it was essential that the main lines of the agreement with H.M.G. should be communicated to the Company in the very near future, in order to avoid any suggestion that the Company had been allowed to proceed with the commercial agreement with the Sheikh on false pretences: also that if any difficulty were to ^ experienced in getting the Sheikh to agree to our terms it would be important to devise some means of avoiding the impression that pressure was being brought to bear upon him in the interests of the A.P.O.C. questions involved were difficult and would need careful consideration, and it might therefore be impossible at once to inform the A.F.O.C. what precisely the conditions would be. But so long as their general outline could be communicated to the Company without delay, and the Company given to understand that whatever detailed conditions were finally laid down would be of universal application, it ought considerably to reduce their difficulties in negotiating either with the Sheikh or with the I.P.C. Mr. Seal said that, so far as he could judge, the Admiralty on the understandings stated by Mr.Rendel, were unlikely to object to the procedure suggested :. t . Laithv/aite said that the Indi Office fully agreed with the proviso to which Mr. Rendel had referred, to which they attached great importance. As regards the conditions to be laid down, he thought thao it v*ould be well to give the Company a fairly clear idea of the nature of the safeguards, etc., which His Majesty 's Government would oe lively to require when we infomed them next week of our comments on the revised draft agreement generally. It was obviously essential that they should have this information before they concluded any agreement with the bheikh, even if such an agreement covered conmercial points only and contained the proviso which had been discussed. It would not be overlooked that the A.P.O.C. could not conclude any agreement with the Sheikh without the approval 01 the I.P.C./9. I.P.C* ana it might well be that safeguards such as we had in view might be or great importance rrom the I.P.C. standpoint. Mr.otarlinK said that w9 must take care that the minimum safeguards etc. which we might prescribe, should not oe such as to 'be impossible for the A .P .O.C., acting as they would be on behalf of the I.P .C. ,to accept. We must not overlook that, whatever the justirication for them, if the conditions laia down by H .M .G. were toa stiff, the I.P.C. might be unwilling to take up, or to proceed with negotiations i'«r, a concession, and if they were themselves unwilling to take it up it was open to them to insist that no one of their component groups, such as the A .P .O.C., should take it up independently. if that happened we might find ourselves confronted immediately with the Standard Oil of Calii«rnia. He drew attention to the general principles whith had been laid downty the Cabinet ta govern the grant of oil concessions in British terri'Lory and the conditions to be satisfied in the case of such concessions. The most important of these were: (1) Registration in British territory; (2) Majority of Employees ana if possible Managing Director to be British subjects, (3) 50$ of produce to be refined on British territory, and the oil to be suitable f«r Admiralty use; (4) pre-emption in time oi war. Mr .Laithwai te pointed out that the decision in question had had in view British territory only* Qatar was not British territory,/ rf : • 4 1 I • it', i J ij'10. / territory, nor a British Protectorate. It was an independent Arab State in special treaty relations with H.M.a. The view that the Caoinet decision referred to did n*t cover the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gull, haa consistently been held by the India Oil ice in the inter-departmental discussions which had taken place in connection with the Koweit oil concession# Mr.Rendel agreed and suggested that it had been accepted at the time of the assignment to American interests or the Bahrein oil concession that oil concessions to be granted in the Arab Sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf must be dealt with separately and on their merits. It would be necessary to consider in the case of Qatar whether the conditions laid down by the Cabinet to apply in the case of concessions in British territory or more stringent conditions, and if so what, should apply. Mr.Starling, reverting to his previous remarks, enquired whether, ii we so stiffened up our conditions that the I.P.O. dropped out, we should be prepared to impose the same conditions on an American Company, e.g. the Standard Oil Company of California. Mr .Laithwaite said that he thought our general view was that such conditions as may/11. may 'be laid down should apply to any Company, whether British or roreign. The two important points were control and exploitation; and it would have to 'be dwciaed what our minimum requirements in respect or them v/ere to be. If H.M.Q. decided to lay down the principle that both control ana exploitation must be British, whatever might be the nationality of the Company ultimately controlling the concession, and we could secure acceptance of these terms from any concessionaire, so much the better. If it proved impossible in practice to go so far, and to secure etiective British control, then we ought as a minimum to require that local representation and exploitation should be in British hands. We could make a good case for this on the ground of the special local political dirt'iculties of yatar, v ' e should ce dealing with a State with ill-defined ■boundaries, a backward and scattered population, hitherto little in touch with the outside world, and not easily susceptible tP pressure by H.M.G* ' I - he oheikh v ' iiS precluded by his treaty engagements from dealings with ioreign powers - engagenents to which it was regarded as desirable to hold hlm . If roreign subjects were massacred In Qatar by a tribal uprising or the like, responsibility for securing effective thii=i fall on an&lt; ^ punishment would thus iai here as in dealing with air procedure we reasonably take the line that while prepared/ * :12# prepared, to race certain political clil 1 ! iculties where our own nationals were concerned, ve were not prepared to in the case of ioieigners. On the face of it, loo , we had a good answer to any American complaint that such conditions represented a refusal to maintain an open door policy in oil matters in the Gulf. The Trucial Coast was closed to all concession hunters, whether British or foreign. The Bahrein oil concession had already 'been reassigned, with our approval, t« American interests; and the latest information was that in Koweit f in which American interests had teen allowed full liberty to compete, we should in future 'be dealing with an Anglo- American combine. Our excuse for restricting exploitation in Qatar tc British personnel would 'be the special political difficulties presented by that area. Mr.Starling said that it was relevant, so far as the nationality of exploiting personnel was concerned, that Ibn Saudhid agreed that the concession granted in Hasa to the Standard Oil or Caliiornia should be operated by American personnel. Mr.Renuel said that the question ol nationality of the exploiting personnel and of the safeguards would clearly have to be considered separately, hut from the Foreign Office standpoint it would be -oasier to impose terms in respect of these on the l.P.C. than on a purely America! Company, such as the Standard Oil Company. Mr Sealiy13. Mr. Seal said that the question of safeguards for pre-emption would probably 'be regarded as more important from the Admiralty standpoint if the Qatar concession were to go to a U.S. Company tiian. if it v;eilt to ' tlle Ti ' ie fact to be faced was that the idrairalty must have the oil in War, and if the Company were American certain diplomatic difficulties might arise which would be very much more easily handled if the agreement provided for preemption. ^ Mr.Laithwaite said that the A.p.O.C. had been warned in the ■■ ' ■ I ■ • _ ~ • . .. IJI I* meeting on 14th December that in the event of their failing to secure the concession, or of competing interests entering the field, H.M.G. must not be regarded as permanently committed to approval of whatever terms they might in present conditions think suitable in the case of the A.P.C.C. We could if necessary endeavour to make special provision in such circumstances for pre-emption. Mr,Rendel regarded it as of great importance that any conditions made by H.M.G. regarding safeguards, British control, pre-emption etc., should be of universal application. He thought that if we demanded certain conditions from the A.P.O.C. or I.P.C., but demanded different or stiffer conditions from a purely U.S. Company, our international position would be much more difficult, ■I since the U.S.Government would certainly accuse us of differentiation. If, on the other hand, we could work out conditions which would be applicable universally - quite irrespective of the nationality of the concessionary Company - and could be defended on merits in view of the political situation, our hands would be much strengthened in dealing with possible eventual Representations of the U.S. or any other xoreign Government# Mr./M ft g. ILS 13 A* Mr.Lai'tiiv/a.it q expressed a^eement/ as regsirds the importance of making our conditions universally applicable. He asked what importance was attached to a special safeguard for refining locally? Mr&gt;Rendel said he had the impression that the A.P.C.C. would object to being required to refine in Qatar. Mr .Starling suggested that they might be asked to agree to refine in Qatar or in British territory, and this was agreed. After further discussion it was agreed, subject to the approval of higher authority, (a) to accept in principle the procedure suggested at the opening of the meeting; (b) that a letter (to be concurred in by the Departments concerned) should be sent by the India Office to Mr.Hearn in the course of next week, suggesting in the first place the adoption of the procedure which had been discussed as between the Sheikh and the Company/14. Company, and the Company and secondly, recording the points on which agreement had been reached or which had been raised but not disposed of in the discussions with Mr.Praser and Mr.Hearn on 14th December; thirdly, indicating in general terms the nature of the points (including safeguards (Sec. ) which H.M.G. would desire to see covered in the proposed subsidiary agreement between the Company and themselves. It would be desirable, in dealing with this last point, not to intimate a decision to the Company. The points in question were controversial and - the risk apart of deterring the A .P.O .C. from proceeding with negotiations if they were iu stated in too categorical terms at this stage - it might be some time before H.M.G. ^ad themselves reached decisions on them. It would probably therefore be preferable to indicate them in outline and say that a more detailed statement would follow;that we should be prepared to discuss them further with the Company if necessary later^ but that in the interest of clearing the ground for their commercial negotiations with the Sheikh, we thought it undesirable to postpone communication of our oomnent on the draft agresnent and on the question of procedure until the special desiderata of had been more fully elaborated* B. Amendments in Re v ised _Di &lt;^11 nnncession. The meeting then considered and approved the amendments which had been provisionally/15, provisionally agreed or raised on 14t,h December with Mr.Fraser and Mr.Heam in the articles of the revised draft other thon Article 12; and reached agreement as to the supplementary points to be raised with the A.P.O.C. on the articles in question. (These are set out in the enclosure to the dreJit letter to the Company attached). Subject to their acceptance and to a satisfactory solution of the problems raised by Article 12, the meeting agreed that the revised draft concession which had been submitted by the A.P.O.C. was generally suitable. Z~N.B. It may be recorded that a point raised for the first time in connection with the draft Agreement which gave rise to considerable discussion was that of the definition of the Sheikh's dominions in Article 2 (c). The Southern and Western frontier of Qatar is at present somewhat indeterminate. At the same time it is important that there should be no risk of Ibn Saud being given an opportunity to call in question the line established by the Anglo Turkish Convention of 1913, i.e. a line running from the coast just sast of Uqair due South to parallel 20 North, If a ma P I s attached to, or a definition included in, the concession, it will be necessary either to include or to omit from Qatar the territory between the various southern frontiers of Qatar as described in and the 1913 Anglo Turkish line, and this would inevitably load to friction and controversy, particularly in view of the fact that the Standard@) 15a, Standard Oil Company of California are now operating on the Hasa Coast. It was agreed therefore that It would be better to omit the map from the concession end to leave the definition as vague as possible, at any rate pending a further report on the whole question from the Political Resident In the Persian Gulf. The position would be frankly explained to the A.P.O.C. C. Article 12 and connected questions . The meeting then turned to consider Article 2 and the questions -arising out of it. It was agreed that these were: (a) British control; (b) Position and nationality of Chief Local Representative: (c) Nationality of exploiting personnel; (d) Pre-emption and refining arrangements. The discussion on points (b), (c) &amp; (d) may be briefly summarised as follows:- (b) Position and na .t.i nnalitv of Chief I nr -Ri rsnresentative . It was very important, particularlj' so long as there was no resident Political Officer, that he should (as in Bahrein) be a British subject whose appointment should be approved by H.M.G., and that he should be persona grata to H.M.G. It would be desirable also that if and when a Political Agent was ^ppointed, transactions between the Company and the Sheikh should/16» should 'be dealt with through the Political Agent. The Company had suggested that it might be easier* to secure our desiderata under this head if we expressed them as a wish rather than a demand. But the p«int seemed too important to leave open in this way. (c) Nationality or employees* The case on merits for requiring that, whatever the ultimate control and nationality of any Company •perating an oil concession in Qatar, local exploitation (and representation) should in present conditions be wholly British, had already been developed in the discussions above tn procedure. It was agreed that a ruling would have to be sought on the difficult points it raised, pending which we could not commit ourselves to it as a sine qua non in writing to the Company: but that our letter should refer in general terms to the probability of such a requirement. (d) Pre-emption and Local Refining. It was agreed that an understanding as to the right of pre-emption in time of war was desirable and that^his should be indicated to the Company. As regards refining they should be informed that it was regarded as important that oil won should be reiined either in Qatar or in British territory and that they should be asked for an assurance on this. The possibili^/ of K^raoiii ^as montioncu. (a)/„.fl (a) Brit.isn Control . The meeting consiaereu tne tentative red rait o± article 12 which had been put 1 or ward 'by Mr. He am at the meeting on 14th Decemoer. Tne effect was to secure that any company to wnich the concession might be transferred woula be a British Company, registereu in Great Britain, having its principal place of business in Great Britain, ana with a British subject at all times as Cnairmcin, but to give any such compojiy the right to form su-:sidiaries unaer its own control to worK the concession which, while enjoying the rights ana accepting tne obligations of the parent company under the Agreement, would be unaer no restriction as regards nationality or British control. It was agreea that the first paragraph of the rearaft was unobjectionable so J&gt;r as it went. The second paragraph was unobjectionable if the woras 'except the engagements expressed in the final sentence of the preceding clause' were omitted. Trie re would be no objection, if the Company tnou^ht this woula facilitate negotiations with the sheikh, to leaving the question of Britisn control out of the coijuercial agreements oo te negotiated between them ana the Sheikh altogether, so long as it was agreed with the A .P .CUC. that provisions to govern it satisfactory to/Qp m 18. to would tie includea in the separate a^rueLi-diio to oe negotiated between H• M• G• and the Company. It was generally felt, and k r.starling in particular empnasised that trie A.P.O.G., ne^o via uin^ at* tiivy iiiUoo ab agents oi tiie I*P. C., might iina considerable difficulty in accepting in respect of subsidiary companies British control provisions sucn as were embodied in Mr. Hearn's redraft of sUb-paragraph 1 of Article 12 in respect of a transferee company. In this connection IviT. starling, consiaered that there was no probability of persuaaing the A.P.C.C. to agree that the British control element in any assignee or subsidiary company should be as large as possible, and in no circumstances less than that in the I.P.O., and it was decided not to pursue this suggestion. Mr. Starling said tnat the points of real importance to us were he thought local exploitation by British personnel, the right of pre-emption in time of war, and the refining of any oil won either in i^atar or in British territory. The representatives of tne Admiralty and the Foreign Office suggested, alter fur trier discussion, that even if we could persuade the A.P.O.C. and the I.P.O. to agree that any subsidiary company should be registered ana nave its principal place of business in Great Britain, ana a British Chairman, the control/19. control whicn tais would secure to us might not in practice prove very substantial, ana that as our essential desicierata were those which had. been irientioned by ivlr. Starling, it might be that in the long run we should tim it simplest to agree with the Company not to press the British control clause on the understanding ^ that they would meet us fully as regards our other desiderata. Mr. Mendel pointed out in particular that It we coula secure our main desiderata by other means, it might well be bad tactics to insist on the strict application of the British control provisions to r subsidiary companies - since this might only further complicate the already delicate position of the A.P.O.C. on the Board of the I.p.G. - while it would probably be possible in practice to secure by other means that subsidiary companies were unuer the aoeciuate control of their parent companies. Questions connected with the registration and nationality of subsidiaries were often based on technical and financial considerations regarding taxation etc. and it did not follow that the non- application of the British control provisions to subsidiaries would in fact mean that those subsidiaries would escape from British control. It was finally agreed that In the letter to be sent to the Company our desiderata should be indicated in general terms and that a door should be left open for the Company to come back, on the ground tnat it would be unfortunate if. on hearing what our desiderata were, they decided that it would be useless to proceed with uieir negotiations, secondly that while the terms to oe used would require careful consideration we might hint that Has at present advised would require British control clauses/»7 /0&gt; 20. clauses in respect of subsidiary companias of the nature aDDOdied in bU^-ci^ub^ 1 Ox iv_t.

Confiden tial.-, Dear Mr.Hearn, The revised draft of the concession which the Anglo -Persian Oil Canpany are anxious to secure in respect of the State of Q.atar which was communicated to us at our meeting with you and Mr.Fraser on the 11th December has now been examined by the Departments concerned. As you will see from what follows there are certain points on which we are not yet in a position to let you know in detail the views of His Majesty's Government. But we are anxious to facilitate and expedite so far as possible the course of your negotiations with the Sheikh of Q^atar and we hope that, even if further discussion is necessary between the Canpany and the representatives of His Majesty's Government on certain points, the information contained in this letter will giv /'e you a general idea of the position, and will enaole you uo give the necessary instructions without delay to Mr.CnishoLu. 2. Procedure. We should like in the first place to make certain suggestions as regards procedure. You will remember that in the course of the discussion on 14tn December the attention of the Company was drawn to His Lajesty s Government's desire to safeguard certain matters such as air, wireless and telegraphic arrangements, the relation^ of t^e Conpany with the Sheikh and the local representatives His Majesty's Government etc., and the suggestion v.ao made your side that it would be preferable that matters such as these should not be included in the actual agreement ^...een the Canpany and the Sheikh and that they might equally sat isf act orily/ • c ^earn, Esq. , 4 ^lo-Persi an Oil Company, Britannic House, Pinsbury Circus, E.C.2ff satisi actci ily tc disposed of oy an excliange of letters between the Company and His Majesty's Government. As the result of further consideration we now think that the simplest course would be that there should be two agreements, the first between the Company and the Sheikh, the second between the Company and His Majesty's Government. The Agreement between the Canpany and the Sheikh would be essentially a commercial agreement which would deal with camnercial points only and would not include anything of a purely political character. It would, however, contain a clause to the effect that it should not come into force until His Majesty's Government had given their written consent to it. This would be in accordance with the Sheikh's treaty obligations and difficulty should not therefore arise so far as he is c cncerned in agreeing to it. Subject to this and to the modifications discussed below such an agreement could probably be substantially identical with the 'revised draft agreement' which we are now considering. 3. The proposed second Agreement between His Majesty's ^ Government and the Canpany - the ccmpletion of which would be a condition of the approval of His Majesty's Government to the first, or Canmercial Agreement between the Canpany and the Sheikh - would cover points of special interest to His majesty's Government. We think on the whole that a formal agreement would be a more satisfactory method of dealing with these questions than an exchange of letters, though on the understanding that legal effect could be given to any an dertakings embodied in an exchange of letters and that such undertakings would be binding on any assignee, transferee or subsidiary company formed to operate the Qatar concession, as We H as on the original concessionaire, we should not regardthe question of form ao one of vital importance. The matters which His Majesty's Government, as at present advised, contemplate that such an agreement would cover are set out in parao^S'ph 5 anci follcwing 'below* I ought to make it clear that it is intended that the conditions to be embodi in this Agreement would be conditiins which would apply not merely t3 your Company or another British concessionaire, but to any company, of whatever nationality, which may endeavour to secure an oil concession in C^atar. 4. Amendments in 'revised draft concession '. For convenience these have been set out in the enclosure to this letter. Save in respect of Article 12, on which, as you will remember, it proved impossible to reach agreement at our discussion on December 14th, and of a suggaation on Article 2, they are substantially identical with those which were th&gt;n provisionally agreed between us and which you have already communicated to Mr. Chisholm, though there are two or tnree points of minor importance which were not included in your communication to Mr. Chisholm and which, according to our record, were discussed at our meeting. 6. Content of special Agreement between Anglo-Persian Q-. Company and Kis Majesty's Governme n 1 :. I now turn to the question of the matters to be included in the special agreement or exchange of letters referred to in paragraph 3 above between Kis Majesty's Government and the Company. As already explained the requirements of Kis Majesty's Government under this head will apply equally to any company, whatever its nationality, which may seek to obtain an oil concession in Qatar. As you will appreciate, certain of these matters involve c onsiderati on/consideration of points of some difficulty on which it will ce necessary to consult the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf before His Majesty's Government can reach a final decision. Partly for this reason, and partly because in the short time at our disposal it has been impossible to be certain that we have exhausted the various aspects of the matters in question, we propose at this stage to indicate them only in general outline. We will in due course, and I hope before very long, let you have a statement in greater detail and possibly in a form suitable for inclusion in an agreement of the nature which we suggest, and we shall, of course, be ready to discuss matters further if on receipt of that statement the position seems to you obscure in any respect or there are any points you wish to raise. 6. We are anxious in the first place to secure an understanding that any sites which Kis kajesty s aOv ^mme may select for aeroplane or seaplane bases in ^atar future (at the moment there is merely an informal arrangement in regard to a particular landing ground Dohah) shall be secure from interference. As w^s mentioned in our discussion on 14th December an undertaking of this nature has been given by the American mteresto which are operating the Bahrein oil concession understanding would equally apply 't 0 hare ours perhaps improbable event of His Majesty s government at a later stage for any reason to develop a haroour -i _ _ 4. n rover the question Qatar, and it would be necessary also to of wireless and telegraphic c onmunioat ions. .•,1 Tpramter. we have emphasised 7. Secondly, as you will rerr.emo in the discussions which we have had on the question this/5. this concession the very special political conditions of Qatar. A- yc^ .t-aicj, it i,- practically unexplored 'by Europeans, ito iiiiiteiland is unadioiiniGtered., its 'jeoDle are 'backv/ara, scattered, and unfaL-iliar vjith the elements of ordinary western civilization; danger of serious political trouble, responsibility for dealing vath which would iall back on .^is Majesty 1 s Government, in connection vdth the Company 1 s activities in so far as these mi^ht either cause misunderstanding on the part of the local inhabitants or in any way affect religious or similar institutions or buildings, cannot be overlooked, and a further complication arises from the fact that the boundaries of the State of Qatar are undelimited. His Majesty^ Government regard it as most important in these circumstances that there should be a clear understanding with the Company (which would, of course, extend to any assignee, transferee, or subsidiary company working the concession) that they will undertake to pay due deference at all times to the wishes of the Sheikh (which His Majesty's Government will on their side see ere not unreasonable in character) and to the advice of the political representatives of His Llajesty 1 s Goverment in the Persian Gulf, whether stationed in Qatar or not. 8. Thirdly, while we are not yet in a position make a positive proposal to you on this point, it nc^ improbable that His Majesty^ Government as at present advised will require provision to secure the same degree of British control as has been discussed with you in tne case of the parent or of any transferee Company, in respect ox ony subsidiary companies operating trie ccncessj.on, of the nature embodied in sub -clause 1 of the uentauive redraft ox Article 12 of the revised concession which you drew up a. our/II our meeting on December 14th. In particular it will be -regarded as essential to secure that the concession is operated locally by British personnel exclusively, provision would also have t o be made in regard to the nationality and position of the Chief Local Representative of the operating Company (this would of course include the question of the channel of conmunication between the Chief Local Representative and the Sheikh) , the refining of oil won either locally in Qatar or in British neighbouring territory, and the right of pre-emption in time of war. These are all matters which can, we think, best be included in a separate agreement between the C cm pan y and His Majesty's Government which would be communicated to the Sheikh but to which he would not oe a party: and we feel that, other considerations apart, such an arrangement may facilitate the task of negotiating a canmercial agreement with him. 9. I hope the information contained in this letter, inc cmplete or provisional in character as it inevitaoly still is on certain important points, will meet yoar purpose. If there is anything on which you are not clear, perhaps you would be so kind as to let me know. I should be grateful if you would let me know the views of the Company on the procedure suggested, and if you v, ould confirm that they are prepared to accept the am end., en the 'revised' concession set out in tne enclosure to t letter, and also the understandings subject to which certain amendments have been inserted or omitted, further point, which was mentioned in the c ourse our discussions, I ought perhaps to put on recoid that while the draft Agreement, with the modifications suoject to the supplementary Agreement proposed, pres ant/present circumstances be generally acceptable to Kis Majesty's 5 overrun en t, it would of course be understood that they are not permanently ccrjr.it ted tc the terms in question and that should the present negotiations between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Sheikh break down, or any other material alteration in the situation take place '^such as the appearance of a competing conpany) they must reserve themselves full liberty of action.II P.Z. 8329/33 Note of amendinents proposed in 'Hsvised Draft Concession 1 ' communicated unofficially - -^he Anglo-Persian Oil Company to the representatives of Kis Hajesty 1 s Government at the India Office on the 11th December 1933. Preamble. No comment. Article 1. c comLieno. article 2. (a) If the position of air etc. facilities is safeguarded in the separate agreement or exchange of letters between the Company and His Majesty^ Government referred to in paragraph 3 of'the covering letter it will oe unnecessary to make special provision in this article. (b) It is understood th^t the words 'or such normal extensions thereof as might be indicated by the Sheikh' reier to religious lands and religious buildings. The following redraft is suggested to maice the position clear:- T! or such normal extensions of such religious lands, cemeteries, or buildings, as the Sheikh may indicate....' (c) In addition oo the amendments above we should like to suggest the omission o_ a reference to a map, at any rate at this stage. The precise boundaries of Q ,atar are at the moment under investigation by the political authorities. It is hoped that a very ear^y decision ..ill 'oe reached regarding them ana o. map can best be produced and attached v;hen agreement has been reached on this point. The point could best ce met cy the omission of the words '(as shown/2, sho.vn generally on the nap annexed hereto)' 1 . (d) Tne Company have agreed to omit thowordc at the; end 01 the first sub-paragraph 'and any subsequent extensions thereoi'.' Tne 'Jornpany agroed to consider ai.i|jliiiCc uon oi tiiis article on the lines of Articles 12A and 13 of their Persian concession, subject to certain verbal modifications. We suggest that the article might be revised to read somewhat as follows: - n 3. The Company shall make a thorough investigation of the State of Qatar by such methods as may in its opinion best enable it to ascertain its oil possibilities. In carrying out its operations under this Agreement the Company shall employ all means customary and proper and shall exploit its Concession by methods in accordance with the latest scientific progress. 'The Company undertaices to keep accurate plans, maps, records /ancf''siufti other data whether topographical, geological or 01 drilling as it is customary to keep and such material shall be open to inspection b^ the Sheikh or his duly authorised representative 'The Company shall supply Q-n annual re' ort to the Sheikh of its operations unu.ej. this Agreement.' It was agreed on December 14th that so long as (a) the financial terms to be given to the Sheikh under this article were sucn as// Article 5 . Article 6, as to give full weight to the fact that the wo.upany would obtain an cxclucive concession over the whole area of Qatar, which appears ■.o be rather over 3,000 square miles, without speciiic drilling obligations or without any ooli^a^ion in uhe event of oil bsinc-r proved to proceed to commercial production v/ithin a given time, end (b) tne Sheikh fully understood that the eifect oi acceptance ofthe royalty formula pro- pi o 3 e d would be that royalty would have to be paid only on oil actually exported from or sold for consumption in Qatar and not on the oil production, no modification of this article need be suggested, l.'o comment.. In the 5th line of the Article the words 'as it may require' appear to have been omitted. The Company agreed at the meeting on 14th De c ernb e r (a) to insert the words 'subject to the pro visions jf Article 7' after the word 'right' in the first line ofthis article; (b) to insert at the end of the first suc- paragraph the words 'but not other wise 1, ax veT the words ,r for the purposes of its op-^r;-Lions■'; (c) The question of a special safeguard in respect of telegraphic and wireless installation^ was discussed in connection with tnis clau^^. T/e do not wish to press that t.iis she aid be specifically covered in the Co.me.rcial aigi yement vvith the Sheikh so long as it is understood tnat it will be included in the separate agreenent to be concluded between the Company and His Majesty's Government. . . / (d)/in 4. ( d) Cn a s eparat e p o i nt, the Company 1 s representatives were very reluctant to agree to any specific safeguard for the political interests involved or for the position of the Sheikh in the clause, and the suggestion was made that it might be possible to meet the difficulties felt by the interested Departments of His Majesty's Government by an exchange of letters in which the Company would undertake to give all due deference to the views of His Majesty's Government and the Sheikh in the exercise of their rights under this article. To this we understood that the Company's representatives agreed and so long as it is understood that the point will be covered in a separate agreement between the Company and His ZJajesty's Government we do not wish to press for its insertion here, irtiole 7. (a) So long the safeguards aesired hy His Majesty's Government in respect on air facilities etc. are dealt with in a separate agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Company, no modification of the first sub -paragraph of this article to cover tnis point will be necessary. (b) The Company have agreed to insert 'vith the constint of and' after .ford 'leased by it' in the opening sentence of sub -paragraph 2. '-e suggest on a point of drafting that in the same sentence oh. words 'but the terms of such purchase ui le shall not be in excess' etc. shoula substituted/(io 5. rticlc S. Article 10 Article 11 Article IS, substituted for the v/ords 'but such conditioiiG shall not be in excess.' Sub-paragraph (i). Second ssntence. The Company have agreed to inuert the v /ords 'subject to the sane conditions'. In connection with this article it was understood at the meeting on the 11th December that the Company would see no objection to the addition of a provision in this article or perhaps more appropriately in Article 6 to the effect that the Sheikh 'shall have the right to use harbours utilised or constructed by the Company, provided that such use in no way hampers the Company or interferes with the safety of its operations.' It was agreed in connection with this article that there could be no question of acceding to the Sheikh's request thax rifles should be supplied by the Company. At the meeting on 14th December x.a .-'i-n, after considerable discussion, suggested the following redraft, which night, he thought, be acceptable to the Ira^ Petroleum Company, but beyond which he was not prepared xo go:- ' Article 12 . Che Company shall have the righw to transfer this agreement to any other British commercial company, but not to any government, subject to such Company being able to fulfil all the duties and obligations of this, agreement. The Company shall inform the Sheikh if it so transfers this agreement. Such other commercial company shall be and remain/6. remain a British company, registered in Great Britain, h; ving its principalpl -.ce of business in Great Britain, and the Chairman shall at all times he a British subject.' T, The Company shall be at liberty to form one or more subsidiary companies under its own control should it consider this to be necessar3 r for the working of this concession. Any such subsidiary company shall, so far as they are applicable to its operations, enjoy all the rights and privileges granted to the Company hereunder, and shall assume all the engagemento and responsibilities herein expressed, except the engagement expressed in the final sentence of the preceding clause.' The redraft in question has been further considered by the interested Departttents of His Majesty 's Government. Their position m regar' to British control, Brltisb exploitation, the position and nationality of the Chief Local Eepresentative, etc. in any oil concession m Qatar is referred to in paragraph 8 of the covering letter, though, as there stated, they are notyet in a position to .-- t out minimum conditions in so many v/oroo. -o f-r as the commercial agreement between the Company and the Sheikh is concerned they would however - -tide 12 the first be content to accept &amp;s Ai^icxe „ ...,,-v... -.-.'ii i of Mr .Hearn's two sentences 01 suo p - , 0 +vip «ame redraft redraft end sub -paragraph o ^ - 4 4.^^ pnee cement expressed less the words 'except the ^ in the final sentence of the preceding clause'' and to omit any reference to Britisn control from the commercial/7 ♦ commercial agreement with the Sheikh ?o long as it was understood that the ouestion would be covered in a separate agreement between and the Goapany. On a point of drafting, it is suggested that the word 'Agreement 41 be substituted for the word ^Concession 4 '' in the first sentence of sub-para.2 of the redraft. The Company agreed, subject to di scussion with the Shell Company, to the insertion in sub-para 2 of a provision that ''producing wells or borings at the time of such termination shall be handed over in good order and repair and fit for further working' and to make a corresponding amendment in substitution for the words ''in such working condition as the property then is' in sub-para. 2 and 3. ifje have not yet heard the result of their discussion; but we note that Article 20 (II) and (ill) of the revised Persian Concession requires wells to oe handed over in good order ana thai tnere appear to be no lack of precedents for a provision of tins nature (e.g. in the Brunei concession, which is operated by the Shell Company, Clause 19 reads: '19 T'ie Lessees shall (save in respect of any operations of which the Lessor shall have sanctioned the abandonment) at the en^ or sooner determination of the said term deliver upirJ 8. to the Lessor in good order repair and condition ana fit for farther working- all productive wells or borings which shall have been made by the Lessees urder the liberty and power in that behalf herein before contained..

When such a communication is made they are \j equally willing that the Company should inform the Jheikh that the modification is made at the request of H.M.I., who have intimated that it is in accordance with the practice in other Persian Gulf oil concessions and that they must make it an essential condition of any concession granted to any company. (a) The Company agreed, in the second sentence of the article, to add the word 'suitable 11 before the word ^labourers'' in line 5, and to delete th- words f ur demand unreasonable wages. 1 * (b) Tl^-y have also indicated thai i ae ■/ would welcome the exercise of jurisdiction by H.

The question of jurisdiction is one which can most suitably be decided in diicot discussion between the ^h^ikh and u .iu.j-. If necessary c reference can be made to the position in the agreement proposed between the eompam' and HJ '.' j .

I hope by then to have circulated the record of our discussion with Eraser and Hearn on the 14th December. 2. The main points in issue are, I think, the following:- (a) Safeguards for aerodromes and communications in Article 2 and 6. (b) Article 12. (c) Article 17, in so far as that affects the introduction of non-British personnel# 3. The Company in oar discussions with them appeared willing to consider an exchange of letters to govern certain points (particularly those mentioned in connection mith Articles 2 and 6 and the general question of their relations with our local representatives and with the Sheikh), It will, of course, be essential, that any undertekings reached between the A.P.O.C. (acting as agents for the I.P.O.) and us should in the first place be legally binding on the Company and secondly should be transferred to and become binding on any assigns* company which might be formed to exploi concession. It would, in fact. I thini, be preferable that they should constitute a separate agreement between the Company and dealing with points of concern primarily to the company end H.M.G. rather than to the Company and the Sheikh. 4. The points raised by Articles 12 and 17 fall into two categories; (a) '•G.Starling Esq #t Petroleum Department, Mines Department 9 Dean Stanley St., S.W.I.fi4. (a) safeguards sucti as the right of preemption in time of war, the obligation to establish a refinery locally, etc. (^i) - a point of much political .importance to us, and, I should think, also to the Foreign Office - the nationality of the personnel to exploit the concession and to represent the Company in aatar. 5. Tiie first category of Aealderftt. Is closely involved nltti major questions of oil policy and it may well be that it would be difficult to reach any early decision about them, though we might mention to the Company the desirability of local refining without further delay in view of our experience in Bahrein. 6. As regards the second category, the more we think about this concession the greater are the potential political liabilities of H.M.G.in connection with it, whether it goes to the A.P.O.C.,as we should prefer, or, as we hope may not be the case, to some wholly non-British body such as the Standard Oil of California. We are inclined increasingly to think that, having regard to possible political difficulties to the undeveloped and uncivilised condition o± M,atar ani to the complications which might arise were foreign personnel to suffer, it would be essential not only that the Company shall always be represented by a Chief Local .lepresenta^i - e w-- 0 shall be a British subject persona grata to H.M.G.and vmcse appointment shall have been approved by tnem, but tnat exploiting personnel, in so far as local native laoour is not concerned, shall be wholly British (an arrangement coulc^oossibly be made as regards one or two Individ Our own very provisional view at the moment is that it would be well to lay this down as a principle to apply eqaall,, any concessionaire who may secure a concession in . whether/]1?l vyliether it is the A.P.C.C., tae I.P,G #&gt; or the Standard Oil of Califo rrlia » arld t0 oar actior^n the ground of local circunistanoes and our special treaty relations with the Sheikh. But the best line might be (I think the Foreign Office vsoald probably agree) that we should tomorrow, if the meeting agrees, as a first move, inform the Company that the redraft left with by Hearn of Article 12 would leave the Company completely free immediately on the transfer of the concession to them by the a .P*0.C. to form subsidiary companies to operate the concession vyiiich would be wholly foreign; that while we quite accept their readiness to meet us so far as possible, it is essential in a document such as the present to put the position beyond doubt, and that we should regard it as essential that any assignee company should comply with the provisions of the last sentence of the first sub-paragraph of Article 12 as redrafted by Hearn; secondly that it is essential that both the Chief Local Representative and the non-Asiatic personnel to operate this concession should be British® 7» I am sending copies of this letter to Hendel and Seal.

Chisholm, in the event of ^ ] ls resuming negotiations with the sheikh oi Qatar before l^th December, of the line wnich he should take. Article 2/(a) The Company were informed that while H.M.G. had not as yet any regular aerodrome in c^tar it was to be anticipated that aerodromes would be established there in the future ana they were anxious to secure safeguards in respect of them from the Company. They had secured similar safeguards from the Bahrein Petroleum Company, by an exchange of letters, in the case of Bahrein. H.M.G. would probably also wish to obtain a similar understanding that any wireless arrangements which they might make in the future would not be obstructed by the operations of the Company. Mr. Fraser was very averse from the inclusion of any specific provision in Article 2 to cover these points, but thought/ tnat they coula be satisfactorily disposed of ty an e xchange of letters. It was agreed that the Inaia Office shoula suggest drafts to the Company. (b) The Company agreed tnat the words 'or such normal extensions thereof as mignt be indicated by the sheikh' referred to religious lanus ana religious buildings. They were understood to be willing to improve the drafting as to make this clear. (c) The Company agreed to omit at the end of the iirst sub-paragraph the words 'ctnd any subsequent extensions thereof.' ^TIGLE 3, Mr. Starling pointed out to the Company that tne article as it stood was very vague. It seemed desirable to amplify it on the lines oi Articles l^A and ^ (first and third paragraphs) of the Company's Persian concession, so as to make more specific their obligation 00 pursue the development of the oil resources of the territory ana to use the latest scientific measures in doing/doing so. Mr* Praser indicated that the Company v^ere reluctant to assume deiinite drilling obligations and that no reference had thereTore been made to such obligations in the article. These obligations if undertaken would be very expensive to the Company and if they did not result in production of no benefit to the Sheikh. They would much prefer to improve the financial terms given to the sheikh. It was pointed out to him that if drilling operations were unsuccessful the Company haa the right to determine the concession after notice under the conditions of Article 13. After further aiscussion tne Company agreed to consider amplification of this article on the lines of Articles 12A ana 13 of the Persian concession subject to certain verbal modifications. This would involve the acceptance by them oi an obligation to carry out operations in a proper manner and to keep plans ana other data which would be nude available to the Government. ARTICLE 4 . Mr. Laithwaite pointed out that under the concession as drafted the Company would obtain an exclusive concession over the vtfiole area of ^atar, apparently rather more than 3,000 square miles. This clearly was a fact which we should have to take into consideration in consiaering whether the financial terms, when these were communicated to us, were satisfactory. It was obvious that if the 3heikh were to grant them a fining lease in respect of a portion of his territory only he would be at liberty (as had happened in the case of the Sheikh of Bahrein) to entertain competing offers from other oil interests in respect oi oha balance of the territory. He also drew attention to the fact that the draf t/4. cirstft* sniDociisQ 'tn 6 ioniiUla whica a,pp8arsci in 1jh6 chss of the Persian concession in rGspect; of the payment of jfoys -l^y » dii ^ct being tlidt royalty v/ou I q have to be paid only on oil actually exported from or sold for consumption in C ^itar anci not on the oil produced. Mr. Praser said that in his view the provision was a perfectly fair one. Certain grades of oil products often involved in certain conditions loss in manufacture. For example, if there were an expanding market for motor spirit but not for neavier products, it was to everyone's advantage that as much of the light stuff should be sold as possible. This would be impracticable if the Company had to pay a royalty on all oil that was produced.- The A.P.O.C. had for some time overcome this difficulty by returning the heavier products to the ground where they once again absorbed light products ana gases. The Persian Government had accepted tne formula now suggested after a full aiscussion. Mr. Starling said that the adoption of this formula represented a new departure and was regarded as a matter of considerable importance. He had therefore taken instructions on it. It was obvious that the adoption of the formula suggested might have a material effect on the ^inaPiCial consideration granted to the Sheikh. He did not suggest that the arrangement was a bad one so long as the Sheikh appreciated what it meant. After further discussion it was agreed that the provision might be allowed to stand. The ofiicial representatives emphasised the importance of making clear to the Sheikh what exactly was involved in it. kr. eraser said that he thought the sheikh fully understood its effect. Article 6/(py IK (a) The Coiupany agrsGQ to iriake tlie provisions of this y ,rtiicl6 sp^cil ical iy c J^ j^go oo tno OorripGnsatory provisioiB of Article 7. (h) Mr, Laithwaite emphasised the possibility of political aifficultids arising if the article vvas allowed to stand in its present form, and developed the argument \ 4 on the lines which had heen agreed by the preceding official interdepartmental conference. Ke suggested that tiie rights granted under the first sub-paragraph of Article 6 should be made 'subject to the agreement of the Sheikh, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.' The A.P.C.C. representatives saia that they could not agree to this. The only effect would be tnat the sheikh would hold the Company to ransom each time the necessity for his approval arose. In their view the phrase 'which shall not oe unreasonably withheld' was one which in practice was no safeguard. Their experience of the Sheikh went to show that he would lose no opportunity of opening his mouth as wide as possible. Mr. Hearn added that provision on the i H same lines was included in the Company's Persian agreement. Mr. Laithwaite said that that might be so, but that the political position in Qatar,, with its wide hinterland and its extremely backward condition and semi- civilised inhabitants, was entirely different from that in Persia or Iraq, where there was a central government and ^ more or less effective control by that government over whole country. It was understandable that the Company snouid wish for some safeguard in respect of their technical e stabli s hments, such as refineries, workshops, etc., cut it ' VaS conceivable that serious difficulties might arise in event of their wishing to operate inland or to establish/6. establish wireless stations, etc, Mr. Starling pointed out tli^t in the Hasa stgreeiiient the arrangernent of air facilities was specii-ically leit to be settled in a sut sequent agreeiuent* Tne official representatives suggested that as a compromise it might 'be possible to distinguish 'between essential oil operations (which might include telephones for local corniiunication) and general conmunications such as telegraph ana wireless. The Company's representatives were very reluctant to agree. Mr. Laithwaite said that there were important political interests to be safeguarded which we could not overlook. He did not know that there was anything very material in the form of the understanding reached with the Company so long as it was binding. If it would ease matters it might be possible to meet the situation by an exchange of letters, in which the Company would undertake to give all due deference to the views of h.m .G. and the Sheikh in the exercise of their rights under this article. The Company agreed to this suggestion. They iurther accepted a suggestion that the words 'but not otherwise' should he added after the words 'for the purposes of its operations' in line 5 of Article 6. (c) The Company said that sub- paragraph (ii) of Article 6 had been inserted in deference to tne sheikh s views. AailGLS 7 . (a) it was agreed that if the safeguards aesired by H.I vi.g. in respect of aerodromes were ultimately not incluaea in the agreement but embodied in an exchange of let^ero, a ^ification of the first sub -paragraph ol this article wuid be unnecessary. The attention of the Company was drawn/7. drawn to the lact that the ownership of certain areas in Qatar raight vest in a tribe and not in the Sheikh.

In connection with this article the question was raised whether the Company's operations should be free of harbour aues and what trie position of the sheikh woula be in respect of any harbours which they might develop in Qatar for their own purposes. Mr. Hearn saw no objection ^ the addition of a provision that the Sheikh 'shall have tiie right to use harbours utilised or constructed by the Company provided that such use in no way hampers the Company or interferes with the safety of its operations.' expressed the opinion that it was not improbable that fto regular harbour might be developed since oil exported w ould probably be taken out to sea by a submarine pipe and all tnat might be necessary would be a pier for landing P u rpo se s. Article 11/137 8. Fir. jjaithwaite referred to the correspondence which had taken place oetween Mr. Elkington and the Political ^esidsnt on the suoject of the Sheikh's request to 'be suppli 6 ^ with rifles etc. hy the Company. He said that H.M.G. agreed with the views expressed hy the Resident, and that in any case the Sheikh's reQuest was in contravention 01 his treaty ooligations. Mr. Fraser said that the Company quite agreed that there could be no question of meeting the Sheikh's request on this point ana that this had been made clear to ivir. Chisholm. AZriGLi 12 &gt; Mr. Laithwaite said that he wished to rapeat that this article, which was obviously of great importance, was one on which H.L.G. could not com it taemselves at the present stage. At the same time he and Mr.Starling would be glad to discuss it with the Company with a view to clearing the ground so far as possible. It has been recognised that the Company were negotiating in Qatar on behalf of the I.F.C., which was an international bo ay with a British percentage substantially less than half of the share holding, and ir. Fraser had made it clear at a recent meeting that the ■foreign interests represented in the I.P.C. coula claim a in proportion to their interest in the operation of concessions which might be granted. Xhe question ol s cu^guards had, however, never been discussaci in any ^tail in connection with the Company's negotiations and while difficulty need not probably be cinticipated them as regards formal transfer of any concession stained to the I.p.c., would probably attach the greatest importance to securing that the exploitation ol the concession/®) (3« If concession W8.s itjisn p^isonnsl q^hq tiActtj CGr'to.ln otihsr ^ai-6 uuras ; ^ or it3 character were included: notably» tliat the Company should be registered in Great Britain, with offices in Lonaon, and a British Chairman, ana probably that a proportion of its Board shoula be British. It would als3 be necessary to consider the question of the Chief Local Representative in Qatar, but ^ that could be considered separately. He thought that it would also be considered desirable that the approval of the oheikh should be required to any assignment. He 3Ug6es^ e(i Article 12 might be amended to read 'The Company shall be and remain a British Company, registered in Great Britain, and the Chairman shall at all times be a British subject. Subject to tnese conditions and to the approval of the Sheikh and on conditions lai^ down by him, it shall have the right to transfer this agreement to any other commercial company, but not to any government* subject to such company being able to fulfil all the duties and obligations of this agreement. The Company shall inform the sheikh if it so transfers this agreement. 'The Company shall also have the right to form one or ffiore subsidiary corrmercial companies under its own control ior the working of this agreement, which snail enjoy the eights and privileges and assume the engagements herein sxpressed. Alternatively, we night specifically provide in the iirst sut-paragraph for transfer to the that Aas what the Company wanted to cover, leaving the secona sub- paragraph as redrafted above. Ivir, Fraser did not consider that the second a lternative would be acceptable to tae Company. In the first place, the I.P.O. might never want this concession and/and it wa^. quite conceivable that it might be taken up ov the A ^P.O.G, and the ^uell only. But he thought that the would see objection to the proposed redraft of pub-paragraph 1 and he was quite clear that there would be very serious difficulty as regards the proposed provision in the case of sub-paragraph 2, Save on the question of British control he saw, however, no objection to making any assignment subject to the conditions of the agreement as it now stood. He was opposed, however, to o giving the Sheikh any voice in approving the assignment. As he had made clear elsewhere, the Sheikh would use any right, however unsubstantial, given him under the agreement, to extort larger sump, of money. As regards the composition of any assignee company, Mr. Eraser and Mr. Hearn said that their difficulties, if they endeavoured to force a British assignee company upon the Board of the I.P.O., would be very great indeed. /Mr. Praser left at this stage7 Mr. Hearn pointed out that Mr. Praser had been entrusted with the negotiations in respect of this concession by the I.P.O., whom he must be regarded as representing. I'lie l .P.O, was an international concern it was most important not to give its Board an^ feeling that through allowing negotiations to be handled by the A,P,0,G. they had sacrificed their interests, On^ point of particular importance in this connection ./as tha Company was registered in Great Britain, with its headquarters in this country, it would oecomo to U.K. taxation. It was unreasonable to expect the •p • j.'u t p p tn cmbmit to U»K. taxation foreign element m the I.P.G. to -uonlyo 11. on ths Compan 7 ? t cuinovsr. nr. La.ithv/aite ©nquirGd whether it would oe po'-siole to meet this point bv providing that a subsidiary Company might be regiritercd. for example, in Canada, emphasising, however, that he did so purely as a suggestion and without any authority, Mr. Hearn, however, apparently thought that the same difficulties as regard^ British exploitation and control would still have to be faced with the l.P.O., if an attempt were made to impose conditions on these points. After considerable further discussion it proved impossible to reach any agreement on this point. Mr. Hearn was not prepared to go beyond the following redraft of Article 12, which might, he thought without committing himself, be acceptable to the I.P.C # The Company shall have the right to transfer this agreement to any other British 'commercial company, but not to any government, subject to such Ocmpaiw being able to fulfil all the caitics ana obligations of this agreement. The Company shall inform the Sheikh if it so transfers this agreement, ouch other commercial company shall be and remain a British company, registered in Grreat Britain, having its principal place of business in (}reat Britain, and the Chairman shall at all times be a British s•ubjcct,' ,, 'The Company shall be at liberty to form one or more subsidiary companiee under its own control should it consider this to be necessary for the working of this concession. Any such subsidiary company shall, as they are applicable to its operations, ^njoy all rights/12. rights and privileges granted to the Gcmpany hereunder, and shall assume all the engagements and responsibilities herein expressed, except the engagement expressed in the final sentence of the preceding clause.' 1 Mr. Laithwaite pointed out that while paragraph 1 of the redraft accepted certain safeguards, the I. P.O., under the terms of paragraph 2, would be completely free immediately on the transfer of the concession to them by the A.PfO.C, to form subsidiary companies to operate the concession which would be wholly foreign. The prospects of HJu .Gr. modifying their requirements were very small and if the redraft represented the best the Company could do it might be txhat the negotiations would break down. Q.u^tion ,q£ Qluvf u/gz1 -VgrQ^nt&amp;tivv. Mr. Laithwaite said that the question of the Company f s representation in Qatar was one of some importance to r . ; hat arrangements did they contemplate? Mr. Hcarn said that probably at first there might be a Fields Manager, or possibly even a geologist: in either event a man of some little standing Mr. Laithwaite said that here, as in Bahrein, li.H.Gr. would probably regard it as of great importance that the C .L # H. of the Company (particularly so long as there was no Political Agent in Qatar) should be a British subject, Pfirsp.na. grata to H.M.Gr. and appointed with their approval : - r • Hearn said that he thought that the prospect of persuading the Board of the I ,P%G. to agree to this ttight be greater if H.M.Gr. were to express it as a wish rather than as a demand. The point was not further ^soussecU AHflCLE 13/IqV 13. ^jnT.-Fi 13. T-ir: Company agreed to consider the insertion in sub -paragraph fii) of a provision that 'producing wells or borings at the time of such termination shall be handed over in good order and repair and fit for further working', and to make a corresponding amendment in sub -paragraphs (ii) and (iii) in substitution for the words 'in euch working condition as the property then is' 1 . Thie would have to be discussed with the Shell Goapany who were co-operating with the A.P.ChC. in this matter. ^TIOLS 15 . (a) The Company stated that the Sheikh had been anxious to restrict force majeure to conditions in i&amp;tar.

It war. agreed that there was no need for Mi . Chisholm to raise this point with the 'hcikh at the present time. The attention of the Company was drawn to the fact that this article as it stood raised several very important questions. (cO Jurisdiction . This had been referred to in the discussion at the India Office on 11th jecember. The Company stated that they would welcome the exercise of jurisdiction by H.11 %3-« and had already made it clear that they were not prepared to agre^ to the n heikh f s request that he should exercise jurisdiction in disputes between their employees and his subjects. (b) The Company agreed in the second sentence of the article to add the word if suitaole M in front of the , word 'labourers' in line 5 and to delete the words 'or demand unreasonable wages 11 .

Would it be possible to have an understanding, if not a positive guarantee, that employees 'ould in fact be British?

Ihey coulci do no more t an put it to the Board. r ^y would be quite willing to do this if we asked them to do so. fact tnat the rjnerican interests in Bahrein had agreed to a special provision might possibly ease matters, and he agreed that a reference to that fact and to the special treaty relations of HJ.I-'j . might be made in any communication which we sent on the subject to the ^mpany. The Company intimated that they intended to stand out for an Arabic and an English text. The/I IS. The following general points '.7orc put to the Company. (a) The possibility of the revision of the concc&amp;sion after a certain period. x.s drafted it ran for 75 years - a very long period: longer than either that of their concession in Persia or of the i^aerican concession in Bahrein. It might be to their interests as well as to those of the iheikh to have some provision for revision at an earlier date. The Company said they were strongly averse from agreeing to any such provision. It would merely put them in the hands of the Sheikh. They would much prefer to leave matters as the- were. It would be a considerable time before they knew where they stood in respect of oil in ^tar, (b) It was made clear to the representatives of the Company that while HJiwG-., subject to their being satisfied that the interests of the oheikh were secured ana that their own special interests ^nd responsibilities were also adequately s^fe 0 u^rdcd, might now be prepared to approve cert: m terms m a concision put forward by tho A.P.O.C. in tho interests of assisting the A.P.O.C. te secure the concession, they were not to he taken as in any way tying their hands as regards the future. If the A .P.C.C. failca no; secure the concession from the Sheikh on such terns as H.M .S. might approve and if subsequently other parties, e.g. the Standard Oil, oano into the fiela, H.K.a. must regard their hands as entirely free, and the terms of any concession would have to form the subject of further . ri^ r « miJcnv said that the-y appreciated the discussion. wmp^nv j - position. (c)/17, (c) Gonsidcrfible emphasis was laid at oarlicr stages in tho discussion on the special responsibilities of H.M.G'. Gnd the fact that the unsettled and uncivilised nature of ^atar and the fact that it was neither an island, like Bahrein, which could easily be controlled from the sea, nor in a more or less advanced state of civilisation, like Persia or Iraq, made it necessary for H.M.'j- to watch all developments very closely and to take special precautions ^hich might not otherwise be necessary or appropriate, and for the Company on its side to exercise extreme caution in taking advantage of certain of the rights given them under concessions and in their dealings wi ch the local authorities and population. The representatives of the Company appeared to understand the position, and it was agreed, in connection with articles 2, 6, and 17 (see record) that their specific attencicn should drawn to these facts, Mr. Heam said that he thought it would be possible to inform Mr, Ghisholm by telegraph of the more important amendments which had oeen ^grc^d c.t the meeting. kr it was clear that the question of Article 12 was still entirely open and would necessitate further consideration and discussion, Mr. Ohisholm woula be instructed to avoid committing himself in any w^y regarding it.

A copy of a revised draft concession which they have recently coiiiiriunicatad to us inforrnally is enclosed. 2. As you will see, the draft contains no provision to safeguard our position in respect of aerodromes, present or future, in Qatar.

The Company were very reluctant to agree to this, but ultimately indicated their readiness to consider dealing with the point in an exchange of letters. 4.

To this end, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, has favoured me with the treaties and engagements entered into between the Sheikhs above mentioned and the High British Government, and 1 hereby declare that I will abide by the spirit and obligations of the aforesaid Treaties and engagements. IL On the other hand, the British Government undertakes that 1 and my subjects and my and their vassals shall receive all the immunities, privileges, and advantages that are conferred on the friendly Sheikhs, their subjects and their vassals. In token whereof, Sir Percy Cox has affixed his signature with the date thereof to each and every one of the aforesaid treaties and engagements in the copy granted to me, and 1 have also affixed my signature and seal with the date thereof to each and every one of the aforesaid treaties and engagements, in two other printed copies of the same treaties and engagements, that it may not be hidden. IH And in particular, I, Sheikh Abdullah, have further published a proclamation, forbidding the import and sale of arms into my territories and port of Qatar; and m consideration of the undertaking into which 1 now enter, the British Go^vernment on its part agrees to grant me facilities to purchase and import, ^rom the Mask at Arm&gt; Warehouse, or such other place as the P)ritish government may a}&gt;pro\e, lor nn personal use, and for the arming of my dependents, such arms and ammunition as may reasonably need and apply for in such fashion as may be arranged hereafter through the Political Agent, Bahrein.

In my opinion, the amount of my early requirements will be up to five hundred weapons. IV. I, Shaikh Abdullah, further undertake that I will not have relations nor correspond with, nor receive the agent of, any other Power without the consent of t ie High British Government; neither will I, without such consent, cede to any other . ower or its subjects, land, either on lease, sale, transfer, gift, onn any other way whatsoever.

Laithwaitg recalled tnat the meeting had oeen arranged at short notice to enable Departments to consider what amendments were desirable in the redraft of the % atar concession, of which copies had been circulated 'by the A.P.O.3. &amp;,t the meeting at the India Office on 11th December. It was proposed that it should be followed the same afternoon by a lurther meeting between Messrs. Fraser and hearn ol tne A»lr•O.u., at which Iv 'r. Starling ana Lr. Luithwaite, in the light of the views ex-pressed by tne Departments, could indicate in general terms tne directions in which it was desire a to amend their draft. It v .ould oi course be impossible to commit H.IvI.G. in any way on one major question of assignment. Neither on this question, nor, inaeea, on the details of tne drait, nad instiuctiono ye u been taken from hibher autnorioy. r^-t if an ^^ndmento not raising points of principle, out iepicoenting improvements from our point of view, coula oe secured in the draft in the course oi discussion f;ioh trie Company's representatives, no difficulty woula presumably be seen. The/2. The other Pepartmenta concerned expressed their general agreement, in particular as to the importance of avoiding any ccnmitment on the question of assignment or safeguards. The meeting then proceeded to consider the revised draft put forward by the Company. Preamble it was agreed that no question Rrose on this. Article _1. Attention was drawn to the fact that the revised article gave exclusive rights 'throughout the State of Q.atar.' The area involved was, so far as could 'be estimated, something over 3,0C0 square miles. It was deciaed that no objection need be taken to the grant of an exclusive concession to the Company and that it was unnecessary to require that the rights of exploration, prospecting and mining should be specified in separate schedules. The Petroleum Department drew attention to the fact that the article as revised gave the Ccmpany the exclusive right to 'carry away' the substances which it was entitled to secure, but saw no objection to this, as the C ompany was the sole concessionnaire and there was no provision for surrendering a part of the territ ory. ttr.La.itYiwaite said that the Goveraoent of India had sent a reminder to the Political Resident on the question of the boundaries of Qatar. If this question was raised by the Company it would be better not to ocnmit ourselves, ^e could wait to see what map they produced. The Foreign Office representatives emphasised that they attached importance to definition of the boundary this question, since an inaccurate de-inixio might lead to trouble with Ibn Saud. Article 2. The following points were raised: UMhe desirability of making provision to safeguard , t 4- was agreed that this should be the position of aerodrcmes. ^ - +v 1 rMicr , h the decision was ccmplicateu oy put to the Company, though the aecj.^ , r ^ v, h nt vet acquired a permanent site. In reply t fact that we had not ye^ acquire ^ to the probability of any special a question by Mr. Laithwaite a *3. ^andralty inters it developing In connection ^ith nartiours, Captain King expressed the opinion that it was unnecessary to irake special provision lor tnis at the present time. (h) It was not clear whetner trie V/ords 'any such noniial extensions tnereol' rel'errea to extensions o! the ^ c reGi^ent or to extensions ol' relloiouo IcJils, though n presuDaoly to the letter. It was agreea that the Company should he ask;ea to make the position clear, hut that no object ion neea he ralsea if the assuif ^tion stated was correct. (c) The phrase at the end of suh-paragraph 1 'and asy subsequent extensions thereof' appeared dangerously .viae. We were dealing with a period of 75 years and it was conceivable that difficult political proolems might arise if the sheikh or one of his successors were, e.g., to conquer a portion oi 3audi Arabia or,to take an extreme case, to occupy Bahrein. It was agreed that xhe Company should be invited to omit tii- v/oras. ( q ) perlou of agreement . No objection v/as seen to an agreement for 75 years, although this period was longer than that of the Bahrein and Persian concessions. (e^ The petroleum Deparuiuent said J^c.,u iu ^as unnecessary to specify areas lor mlnin^ puipo^-s . this article now that it was proposed to tne Company rights over the whole area oj . oxid o ^ate. (f) Attention was drawn by the India Office to the fact that in a send-civilized area such as ^atar it would be necessary for the Company to walk extremely warily in anything which might offend religious susceptibilities. We should find ourselves faced with responsibility lor safeguarding their interests in ^ event of serious trouble breaking out and Iz wduIu oe well/well to impress upon them the delicacy of the position. The meeting agreed and tnought that this might 'be put to the Canpany as a general point in connection with the concession. (o) terri to ria l water s. The question was raised whether territorial waters were covered 'by the draft concession. It was agreed that they were included under the terns of Article 1. The Petroleum Department suggested that it would be desirable further to safeguard the interests of the Sheikh by amplifying this article on the general lines of Articles 12A and 13 (paragraphs 1 and 3) of the A.P.O.C.'s Persian concession, which provided for carrying out operations in a proper manner and also dealt with the keeping of plans, and other data which were to be made available to the Government. It was agreed that this should be put to the Conpery. Article 4. This article was likely to be that of the greatest importance to the Sheikh. The Foreign Office representatives expressed the general view that, sucject to consideration of our own interests and those of the Sheikh, it was desiratle to meet the A .P.O.C. so far as possible over the terms of this concession since any delay in settlement increased the risk that American interests might be brought in. The Petroleum Department agreed, and the Admiralty said that they thought their higher authorities would probably also ar;ree, subject to the reservations in question, as did ;ir.Laithwaite. Mr.Laithwait e said that the Company had already made it clear that they did not wish to disclose their bargaining figures at the monent and we could not very well press them to do so. On the other hand, it would be material, in considering the terns to be accepted, that under the present concession they were to receive an exclueive licence in respect whole area of Qatar - some 3 ,000 square miles. Mr.Starlin g said that the use of the phrase 'exported from v,4-•; in' raised an important point, ihis or sold for consumption in raiseu formula was one which had been used in the Persian concession. The/The effect would be that the Company mould not pay royalty on ar ,y oil used locally; on wastage, on loss in refining if done in Qatar, or on oil which might he returned to ground. He had regarded the point as so material that he had taken the instructions of higher authority on it. As a result he expressed the opinion that it was unnecessary to take exception to it, so long as the financial terms offered by the Company proved adequate, (i.e. such as adequately to safeguard the Sheikh's interests after taking into account the possible effect on his receipts of the fact that royalty would be paid not on all oil produced, but only on such oil as was exported from or sold for . . . ^0+0-^ thouprVi it seemed desiralole that the Sheikh consumption m Q.atarj -cnougn xu should fully understand what was involved. ▼ i -u i ■; ct V i -j- n -r ttt ^tarlinft's statement on Article 5. In the light 01 Mr. btarxxxib Article 4 it was agreed that no question need be raised the use of the words 'exported from or sold for consmption in' instead of some phrase such as 'produced'. would be desirable Ar ticle 6. (a) It was agreed that it would r +v^a article specifically subject to to make the provisions of this irtiole 7 (as in the case of the ccnpensation provisions of Article Article 2 of the revised draft). (b) Considerable discussion took place +&gt;10 n nm oanv an absolute right# as the risks involved in giving the company an + in any circunstances , to construe in the terms of the articl , comnunications, railways, refineries, etc. The meeting were reminded of the difficulties which had arisen in Hasa in connection with the provision of landing grounds for aeroplanes. and elsewhere in Saudi Arabia in connection with wireless. d the danger of inflaming the Bedouin na Local prejudices and the da g -r^ooonn for postponing action been alleged by Ibn Saud as a reaoon . lons if similar difficulty arose in qatar refusing concessions. - ,,,vnrvrt ^ for us to intervene in support position, if it proved necessa y v, the v.. &gt;, difficult. On the other hand, the of the Company, might be - - . , noiiire sane definite provision that the. Conpany would clearly Q . •, f 0T « + ^ as were essential I or had liberty to erect such buildings, etc..their purpose, e.g. refineries, pumping stations, harbours, pipelines, workshops, etc. The meeting was inclined to think that the simplest course might 'be to draw a distinction between constructions of this nature and ccmmuni cat ions taken in a broad sense - wireless, roads, railways, etc. - and that in discussions with the Company we should aim in the first place at making the Company's rights under the first sub-paragraph of the article subject 'to the agreement of the Sheikh which shall not be unreasonably withheld'. (The Petroleum Department did not wish to support any arrangement which gave the Sheikh the right to interfere with the construction of any works &amp;c. necessary to the operations of the Canpany, and pointed out that roads, small- gauge railways and telephones were an essential part of any large scale operations.) If this proved impossible to endeavour to make a special exception in respect of conmunications and wireless, putting them on a different footing fron the other matters referred to. It was thought that here, as in the case of Article 2, the importance of walking extremely carefully, having regard to local conditions, might be impressed on the Company. (c) Mr .Warner raised the question whether steps should be taken to secure the participation of the political authorities in dealings between the Company and the Sheikh after the granting of the Concession. Mr■«Laithwaite ., while agreeing as to the desirability in principle of ensuring this, drew attention to the difficulty of requiring or enforcing it so long as re nad -no resident political representative in Qatar.. Ar^^l^^T^ (a) It was agreed that the desirability of specifically safeguarding the position of any aerodromes acquired us in Qatar should be considered in connection with this article (b) Attention was drawn to the possibility that considerable areas might be in the possession, not of the Sheikh, but (as appeared in the past to have been the case elsewhere on the Arab littoral) of the Jowasimi Arabs- That was. however, a point for the C 0 ^pany.ffr 7. (c) The second sub-paragraph v;as too widely stated and did not sufficiently safeguard private possessors against expropriation at the request of the Company. It was agreed that the Company should be invited either to adopt a wording on the general lines of Article 4 (B)(2) of their Persian concession or to revise the first sentence of the sub-paragraph to run as follows:- 'Any other lands, houses or buildings required by the Ccmpany may be bought or leased by it with tne consent 0^—and on conditions to be arranged with the proprietors thereof, but. tVLe terms of such purchase or lease shall not be in excess.... (d) The phrase 'Such land shall at all times be less than the whole area of Qatar' caused some surprise, but was assumed t o have been inserted at the request oi the Sheikh. Arti c 1 e 8 . it was agreed that the Canpany should be invited to insert in the second sentence of the first sub paragraph the words 'subject to the same proviso Article 10. (a) Some discussion took place as to tne desirability of fixing a maximum period during which the general oustons exemption granted to the Company should run. The general feeling of the meeting was, however, in favour o- letting the article stand, particularly now that the Company had to so...e extent met us by agreeing t« pay duty on food supplies, personal goods, cWhing and general merchandise imported oj it for personal use of its employees. (b) The question was raised of the desirability of giving the Canpany complete exemption in respect of harbour dues. The meeting felt that as any harbours made would be developed by the Company, it would be unreasonable to request them to pay harbour dues. On the other hand it would be worth ensuring that they would agree to the free use of such harbours by the Sheikh- Goods imported by private individuals through such harbours/\ 8. iiarbours vvoula ot course liaols lor any ordinary import duty charged, out it would be unreasonaMe to give the Sieikn the right to charge harbour dues in aaaition in respect oi the importation of sucn goo as► Article iX * attention was drawn to the correspondence which had taken place between the Political Resident ana kr. ^Ikington, ana also to the fact that under 5 Article 3 of the Qatar Treaty of 1916 the sheikh was t precluded from obtaining arms, save under arrangements therein defined, to be made and approved by It was agreed tnat the Resiaent* s view in the matter, as i| expressed in paragraph 3(1) of his letter dated ^4th November to 'Mr. Elkington, should be accepted. Article 12 * Assignment * It was recognised that this article raised fundamental questions and that no decision could be taken on it except after reference to higher authority. On the other hand it seemed desirable so far as possible to clear the ground with a view to exploring how far the Company were in lact prepared to go ana Ahdt their intentions were in the matter. It had throughout been appreciated that as the A#r#0.G. were conducting 4 ^ as ^ ^ -h negotiations in Qatar only/on behalf ox the wiiicn j was itself an international Company containing a British eiemert .,.•1 q ii, n r6 hold 61*9 # it would net 136 possiblt; which rt presented only at out Zfy or tne sn-rcnuiuoxo, in practice to insert full British safeguards or piovicion for full British control in the concession granted. | Mr. Seal said that the Admiralty had originally propemed the falXowing five aafeguarde designed to maintain British control: - (a) The assignee company to oe registered in Great Britain; (h) The Company's office in Great Britain to be run by a British subject; (c)/9. ive to 'be persona g^rat a to H.M .G. (c) British director; (d) Chief Local Representat and a British subject. (e As many British employees es possible to be employed, i 't-ese, he thought that (a), (b) and (d) should appear in tne concession itself, and in view of the necessity for transfer to the I.P.C., he suggested that the other two might be inserted if at any stage the I.P.O. decided to sell the concession to a foreign Company. /or this purpose a clause should be inserted forbidding assignment without the consent of the Sheikh, and then only on conditions to be laid down by him. Mr. Starling suggested that we night provide that the Company should be and remain a British Company registered in Great Britain, having its place of business in Great Britain and a British Chairman, on the same lines as the I. i.e., I'r. Laithwait e said that might be possible, but that he thought the India Office would be content ( if this was found to be sufficiently legally watertight and would ease matters) to cover certain of tnese points in an exchange of letters with the Company, particularly the point about the Chief Local Representative. It seemed desirable also to provide that the Sheikh should approve the conditions ci transfer. Mr.Seal said that apart altogether from safeguards for British control, the Admiralty were concerned that they should be in a position to acquire or buy the oil produced in time el war, and he was anxious therefore that there should be no reassignment to American interests without provision for pre-emption, as otherwise serious diplomatic difficulties might arise, . &gt;za,z lin^ drew attention to the difficulties of entirely safeguarding the position when we were dealing with an international company sue-- as tne Seal agreed that it was desirable to make provision tnat one consent of the Sheikh and approval of the conditions of assignment should be included. Lir .Warner suggested that the simplest course might be to meet the Company in so many words as regards transfer to the I.P.C. if that was the point which they had principally in mind in the first sentence of the article and then make provision to safeguard our position in the event of any reassignment.11. ^ruicle 15 . IX, was agree a that the Company should he asked in suh-paragraphs £, 5 and 4 to Insert provision that producing wells or borings should he handed over in goo^ oraer ana repair and fit for further working. article 15 . i£r. Laithwe.ite suggested that in the interests of trie Sheikh it might he desirable to reword in lines 7 &amp; 8 after the word Melajre.^' this^fo'run:'^ p^noa oi sucn ael^T togetner with such period as may be reasonably necessary in the view of the for the restoration &amp;c. Political itesident^^rit would of course be open 'oo the Sneikh to &amp;0 to arbitration on the point, but something less uj-'Ador^te se^iixcd preferaoxe. inc; i.i^^oin^ ^c.r^^ article 16 . hx. uaithwaite sctid tnat the India Office on general political grounds regarded it as uriciesirable that the third arbitrator should be nominated by the Court of International Justice at The Hague. They would much prefer the Political Resident (on whom tnis responsibility h^a devolved in the original drait). me meeting agreed that this should oe put uo the oompan^. article 17 . (a) It was pointea out that this gave us no guarantee as to nationality o_ any ncn -n .siati^ foreigners who niiglit oe introduced. Secondly, that osrious political difiiculties might /, oil ioo i^ tne Company were to import, say, Bah re in is or iraqis, to operate the (^.tar concession, on the ground tnat the ;/agcs demanded locally were unreasonaoly nigh, io v.as agreed that the Company should be invited to consider uie omission of the words 'or demand unreasonaole wages • oiie question of nationality of non-Asiatic employees, wir.Eraser had already u^ide it clear tnat they coul^ no^ ^orxiit themselves and it seemed difficult, important as the point was, to do more than had been aone in Banrein and endeavour to secure that as large a proportion as possible should be British. / h w'n Telegram xx From Political Kesident f Bushire.

Mr.4fillianson , s note is a clear and accurate statement of fact and agrees with what I myself know of «&lt;atar and its history. 4» I did not know that the exact boundary lina, as claimed by Ibn Thani ran as Ur. (illiamson says it does: I was under the impression that it started from oalwa fort, and ran south to ANBAK wells and then turned due ^ast to the Jea, south of the Khor ODAID. As iir. Villiamson knows tho geography of %atar far better than I do, I think we must assume that what he says in this matter is correct. 5. Incident^ally, and as I have already mentioned in another letter which I eent you sometime back, the existing Government map trillion Jheet) give? the depth of the Bey of iialwa quite wrongly. It runs much further- a - further south than marlced,!!! fhot the true position of %asr JalTra, is only a little north of an riaat and ^©st line running through Hhor al Odeid. Tl^e bept existing uap to consult that I know of is that praparud by ldr« T hilby and vhich accoc^anies his book ihe jnpty carter' . although even he does not mention Jebel al NAX3H a conical hill a little north of ^asr oalwa.. I una erst and also that Ir .Cox of the a . T . Q . C ., Ltd., was able to laako a sketch map if the hinterland of ^tar, which could be studied jith advantage* 6« As regards the political situation existing bet ween His Majesty Kin;*? Bin Gaud and the 'lulcr of c^ntar: I c.rr^o with every word that Mr. .llliamson says, and It is bom out by what I have heard in Kuwait during the lest year or so. Cn ray opinion Bin ^aud defini tely claims the a tar peninsular, and will go on noinf; so, so lon^ as wo do not move with the times and adopt a policy there. ±11 the in- fonaution that I have been able to get from Riath, from time to time bears out exactly what ir. villi an son says in this reapoct. It is practically certain that Bin iaud warned, th^ shaikh of oxtar on tha letter's r^c^nt visit to the Capital that he expected him to ?ivo any Oil Concession that mir^it be goins;, to his friends, the Americans and not the British. He went, I believe, further, and told him, in a diDlomatic way, of course, that only DOHaH could be con sidered sc belonging to the Ibn n!AKI f family and that the rest of the peninsular was hi?. Certainly all the bedouins of Fassa look upon the s .atar desert (Bar al ^atr) as belonp?- in^r to Bin .auwl, and I only .;/ot this confirmed 3 days 2so (15.1.^4) by an Ajman ..haika, who is no^ in Kuwait. /hen I aske^. him ^uart^adly, if he knew the boundary between oaudiyeh and the ub-aikli of -^atar^ territory, he promptly replied, 'There Is no boundary. Bin i.aud rules 'Bar al s.atr 1IrOlT - 3 - ^tr' (the dosert of s^tar), and Ibn 'Itanl rul-w Doha'. V. Kin baud's contention in the past has always been that he alone ruler the !3edouin &lt;V Nomad elements In txabia, for the simple reason that, as he says, only hs can get at then and keep them quiet^ hence all territory form ing the habitat of '^omad' Arabs he ipso facto cleims to be hie. 8* B i n even went so ffip, some years a#), as to claim all 'Iraq nomad tribes, as well as all Kuwait edoulns up to the walls of Kuwait, until the OJalr eon- *crence of 1923 put a definite boundary line between him and his northern neighbours and forced hla no drop these ideas. To this day, howerer, In any public utteronces he nakes to his Nejd Bedouins, !31n Saud tells them that nil the bedouin of ^rabla (Badla) are his, and his neighbours only hold the Towns. This Is a regular trlok of his to 55ain their allegiance and Impress. 9. as regards the question of how to bring It home to Bin Saud that we consider ^atar State to be independent of Saudi Arabia, and that we will not stand by and see Ibn Than! coerced in any way, where Oil cr ctht&gt;r questions are concerned: I do not consider the problem presents many difficulties, but we wust tackle it at once , other wise the Americans will get into ^etar for a certainty, and that principality will pass under the suzerainty of Bin ^aud. 10. In my opinion the procedure should be a3 follows; His Majesty's Government should without further delay add ress a friendly but firm note to Din ^aud emoodylng the following points2- (a) ThF,t he was definitely told by Mr Percy Cox at OJair in 19&amp;5 (I was present at the interview) .Then I'ajor Holmes tried to include ^atar in his Hassa Oil Concession with his. Binlo* - 4 - Bin maud's, approval, that a tar wcs an indepen dent Jtate under our protection. (b) That he, Bin Seud, was further told by Sir Percy Cox that he had no rights in ^atar what soever and so could not give away what did not belong to him. (o) 'That as he nev*r raiped any objection at the ti3R or since to iir I ercy Cox 's pronounce- nent, Kis Majesty's Oovemnent considered the Better as definitely settled.

Knowing Bin oaud as I do, I believe that when he is clearly made to realize that we intend to defend -ater'n land boundaries in case of necessity, he will ac cept the oituatiloK at once as be did in the case of •Iraq raid Kuwait. 14 # .hat we must not do - and this is thf» crux of the whole matter - is to leave the situation as it is now, thet is to say unsettled and in fluid state. If we do, the astute Bin Saud will at once take full advantage of our laissez faire attitude and by means of bluff and bombast where we are concerned, and by secret pressure and tribal radio into atar (he denying responsibility all the time) where Ibn Thani is concerned, will gain all his points, and force Xbn Thani to acknowledge that he is the power that counts, and can do things, whilst His Majesty's c;ov«mment la not. Ibn Thani will then, whilst outwardly 'keeping in* with us, surrender his hinterland to Din iiaud and «ive any t Oil Concession that may be going to Bin iiaud^ proteges, the ijaericans, on the plea that theirs was the better offer. 15. iven if we are successful by diplomatic methods in keeping the otandard Oil of California out 01 nfltar, the Jhaikh of that 3tate will never give the concession to the I.P.O., or A .P.O.C., unless we can reive him an as surance that we intend defending his land frontiers, and will see hin through any and every quarrel that ' in Jaud may ohoose to pick with him in the future. 16. It should not be forgotten - and I state this aa a well known and curious fact - that everyone of the Arabian Coastal jiairates in the 1 ereian .&gt;ulf, have got it deeply fixed in their minds that in some way or other ; 3 .in^Bssassa f - 8 - own hls /family, has no tribe which he can claim as hie own in % atar v There are a few scattered fiemi ^onade of the KABl tribe on the peninsula dating back to the time of the BINI ^JSLIlri who were the rulars in ^atar before the Itiani family. Xbn HUiNI dep «5nds for his fighting force on men drawn frcm the BIIJ1 ILvJaK and the BI1JI tiUaRA, two of the three tribes pasturing along the border of ^atar. The third tribe Is al-MONAoIR, Ibn THAIil is definitely dependant on the good will of Ibn Saud and his HASoa Governor, Ibn JhLLUUI , for the safety of his lands from the raids of the Kejd tribes, especially from the MANA^IR. I be Here it irks Ibn THaNI to be so much de pendant for his safety on Ibn Jaud, but to strengthen himself by hiring a body of mercenaries from the tribes of BINI and AL FUHI a , other than the few dozen men he has at present, would cost him much and more then he coulc well afford. The income of Ibn THaKI, as I have sal«1 before, lb derived from pearling, and from monies lent out to traders on the ' percentage from the profit '' basis. This percentage varies from 6 &amp; to /*• &gt;enerally if on the 5 from the trader uakes good any losses from the capital lent; but if on the ?.6 ^ basis the lender suffers any legi timate loss to the capital. Ibn THANI draws a small income from Dohah customs but not enough to cover the upkeep oi the overnnen;. ^nd Town guards. Customs ohargeil are 4 &gt; ad valorem. No income is deBived from the grazing and the Bedouin tribes of BiSNI HAflAH, AflJHHA, and : Al4AJl&lt;: graze as they wish, except In one or two areas, which are set asic e for the herds of iith Thani. 3, TCMHS.

We are in general agreement isitu Resident and consider it most important that Shaikh should 'be dissuaded or prevented from granting concession to Standard Oil CJompany s:,a:ea ^ paragraphs 3 and 4 of Fo^le's telegram No.T/19 with which we concur and it is olavious that development, ^roha-l^ xDvolVi.no ahsor^t^ion wi ^atar xu.. oauu, woulo seriously unc ermine British politicpoox.xon in the Bulf administration of 'is l'aj3sty # s Govern ment's interest in general oil. 3. Most direct line to take woulo oe to do as Fowls suggests and tell the Shaikh that His -ajaty* Government 's consent will ^e mthheld unless concession is granted partly to British Company, realise that such an attitude might he dimoult to justify to American Government, jarticularly if better financial/financial terns w ^re off er. g to SViaikh 'by e.g.Standard Oil Company than An^lc Persian Oil Gompany and 'Iraq, letrcleum CJompany are prepared to give. We thersfore suggest alternative line of approaoti whicL might persuade Shaikh to do as we wish. 4. Kesiuent shoulu be authorised to offer Shaikh the full protection, similar to Bahrain ana Kuwait, which he asked for ana was refused it connec tion with emergency lanaincj grouna at ^atar. The previous decision is, we consider, Justified by tne far greater importance of interests now involved ana also 'by the fact that His Majesty's Government will in practice he responsihle for providing such protection if oil company is working in Q.atar wiLh taeir consent. We also understand, tix t pracii.cal afforaing protection oy use oi ail- craft would he comparatively small. This guarantee of protection would ostensibly he given as quia quo for surrender of Jurisdiction over foreign subjects which should, we consider, he made an mais? pensahle pre -condition under Article V 01 xreat^. There seems tc us to be no advantage in tryiug to treat guestion of jurisdiction on general Uines ana as unconnected witli oil concession since Shaikh is too cunning to oe aeoeivea ana will pro.Daoly only give a definite answer within a reasonaole jer- iod if he is made to realise that his finances will t e affected hy delay. It does not seen; nece.sary at present to insist on bringing Articles or Treaty into force as Article VIII is the only one of importance and this can oe arrangeu later it ? .r- tec tion/■v '8 -3- ?^rQteGtiori is granted. If he accents these terms anu otxXx a o o oia ^ o o t c ^x. ve c«&gt;]qceosxojq to o t ctrici cx JCL l Oil Company, it may 'be necessary to adopt a still firmer line and threaten him with deposition 'but it may 'be a that prospect of closer relations with His Majesty's Government may make him more amenable to their unexpressed wishes of which he is no doubt well aware. 5. As regards procedure, we agree with Besiaent that he should deal with Shaikh 'by personal discussions and that procedure suggested hy riesicent should he adopted after main question as to who is to obtain concession, has 'been settled. ■ I - F 0. lv '3 I Gr r . - ITelegram From To xx 3r «liwical Besident, Bijsliire.

P v' ^ Correspondence ending with your telegram No.127. 1• Having regard to all the circumstances ^ I am of opinion that next stej) shoulc be for me to pa„ a visit to the Sliaikh which would be in the nature of a preliminary reconnaissance. 1 b'o^dSt tilat in tud CJUl cic of fr^ok and friendly conversations with the Shaikh I should point out to him; (a) our natural desire that the concession should go to the Anglo Persian Oil Company. (b) that present terms offered by the latter are generous. (c) that it is no secret that Bin Saua is behinu California Oil Company and that result of latter obtaining concession will be absorption of his territory by 3in 3aud and his disappearance as an independent ruler. 3. If Shaikh attaches value to our protection he will presumably ask for it or throw out feelers and his attitude jn this important paint will oe clearea up. 4./ I4. Should Shaikh ask for our protection, in oraer to enhance its value, I will assume suitable hesitation ana reply that matter must 'be referred t© His Majesty 's Government. 5. Before however I approach Shaikh I venture to suggest that His Majesty's Government should for the moment ^ut all other considerations asiae and (1) decide whether if Shaikh gives Anglo Persian Oil Company concession we can v promise him full protection, (2) endeavour to extract from A.i .O.C. - I •P.O. the Agreement suggested in my telegrams Nos.69 and 70. In order to avoid complicating issue only two most important stipulations might be demanded (a) that all local exploiting personnel should he British, (h) conditions of transfer ol Agreement (Article 12) to he agreeable to His Majesty's Government. 5. A firm line in my opinion should now be taKen with the Anglo Persian Oil Company - Iraq Petroleum Company and they should be informea plainly that having been ^iven a perfectly free rianu in ^aoar and having by reason of their failure forced His Majesty's Government to come to their assistance it is now Kis Majesty's Government who will call tne Luna. - RSSIDSNX -S.No:14.
