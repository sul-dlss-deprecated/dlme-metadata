Unfortunately, we cannot trace the letter to which you refer, but it occurs to us that as you are now signing as Officiating Political Agent, the original enquiry may not have been signed by you and consequently our reply would in all probability be addressed to whoever signed the enquiry. This will probably account for the trouble, as it is quite unusaal for us to mislay filing of any description, particularly that on the subject of prices. However, we remember enough of the circumstanc-es' ahcf the date to be able to give you our prices for the two types of reinforced Foil, and these are today T s rates which, if anything, would be lower than those which we might quote some months ago. it In herewith, case we also omitted literature, we along with samples of the two types are enclosing of Foil. Your records should, therefore, now be in order and we hope that you will decide to make a trial with this product in the near future, because we are confident that you will find its properties of considerable importance to you in Bahrain.

If you will just glance through them we feel sure you will see what a tremendous opportunity exists to-day for those who can obtain sound unbiassed advice. An opportunity for saving money—investing money—in fact, making money by profit, brought about by the extremely competitive market created by over a hundred Insurance Companies competing for business. First of all, remember there are at least ONE HUNDRED first-class Insurance Companies in competition, and to get the most benefit you should have the advantage of unbiassed expert advice. We feel this fact must be obvious to everybody. For our own clientele we obtain this gratis and with pleasure. Let us send you further information. Investment Scheme A Investment Scheme B Investment Scheme C Investment Scheme D Investment Scheme E Investment Scheme F Investment Scheme G DO YOU REALISE that Insurance to-day and for the future, with its modern developments, is one of the few sound non-depreciating investments and comparable with first-class securities? Almost every big Insurance Company offers schemes for investment—we can help you with advice with all these. DO YOU REALISE that as a parent you can ensure the proper education of your child or children, whether you live or die? This is far better than taking the gamble that when the time comes you will be still alive and will be able to meet school bills comfortably from your income. Your child’s chance in life can be assured. DO YOU REALISE that parents can take out Life Assurance Policies for their children’s lives at very low rates, and after 21 {without increase of premium) the insured can take them on? Just consider what you would have saved in premiums if your parents had done this for you. DO YOU REALISE that a married man can protect and provide for his wife or family (or even his own old age) and ensure an income sufficient to keep them without undue privation or disturbance in their mode of life should he die? How many widows and children suddenly have to drop from a fair standard of life to absolutely penury and want, when there is no need for it if gradually provided against year by year by carefully thought out Insurance? DO YOU REALISE that unmarried men and women can assure, definitely, an income to live on in old age, come what may. Have you heard of the profit-sharing pension schemes? DO YOU REALISE that by Insurance you can provide for the repayment of mortgages or loans when you die? These liabilities may be a crushing calamity to those dependent on what you leave for them. Again, you can provide for the payment of Estate duties, thereby preserving your savings intact for your dependents, obviating forced sales of your securities or other effects. DO YOU REALISE that if you wish to benefit the living, an Annuity for the life of one or more persons is the best way to get the largest possible income with absolute certainty from your capital? How many people struggle to exist on income only from invested capital, whereas they would get far more from Annuities, with absolute certainty and absolute safety from fluctuation? Insurance to-day is a highly specialised business, unbiassed and expert advice is more than ever necessary in the selection of the particular policy you need. There is no need for you to wade through 100 different prospectuses each containing a multiplicity of schemes. Many of our clients have profited by our Insurance Service, the longer you leave insurance the larger the premiums and the cost to you becomes.

W Air Headquarters, British Forces in Iraq, Hinaidi, 28th April, 1936. r&lt;?&gt; Supply of Fire Extinguishers to Residency, Bahrai n. ^ V Sir, I have the honour to refer to my letter, number and subject as quoted above, dated 17th April, 1936, and to forward herewith instructions for the Soda-Acid Fire Extinguishers recently purchased by you. 2. Any further refills required for these extinguishers may be obtained on repayment from No. 84 (B) Squadron, Shaibah. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, A.ir Vice Marshal, Commanding, British Forces in Iraq. Lieut.Col. P.G. Loch, C.I.E., Political Agent, BAHRAIN•Extinguishers, Soda-Acid, 3 -gal lon Capacity 1. This extinguisher is provided for dealing with small outbreaks of fire of a general nature, and is not suitable for extinguishing fire involving highly inflammable liquids, fluids, or gases. A soda-acid extinguisher is discharged when an acid is added to the saline solution. This causes the generation of gas, the pressure of v/hich forces the water out at the nozzle as a chemical fluid. The principle of all chemical extinguishers of this type is the same in so far as the chemical action is concerned; they only differ as to the mechanical means employed in mixing the acid with the saline solution and the methods of storage of the acid. The charge consists of 18 ozs. of bicarbonate of soda and a sealed glass bottle of sulphuric acid. 2. Extinguishers are to be inspected monthly as follows:- (a) Remove the cylinder cap and withdrav/ the acid bottle and cage. (b) See that the solution is at the correct level and stir it up with a sticko (c) Replace the acid bottle and cage after seeing that the former is intact and not leaking. (d) Ascertain that the delivery nozzle is not choked; this can be effected by inserting a piece of wire. (e) If the extinguisher is found to be in a satisfactory condition, the cap should be replaced and screwed on tightly. (f) Should the solution be appreciably deficient in quantity, it should be emptied out and throv/n away; the requisite quantity of bicarbonate of soda should then be dissolved in about 2 quarts of warm water and the solution poured into the cylinder and made up to the water line with clean water.

This causes the generation of gas, tho pressure of which forces the water out at the nozzle as a chemical fluid, ^he principle of all chemical extinguishers of this type is the same in so far as the chemical action is concerned! they only differ os to the mechanical means employed in mixing the acid with the saline solution and the methods of storage of the acid. The charge consists of 18 ozs. of bicarbonate of soda and a sealed glass bottle of sulphur!e acid. 2. xtingulshers are te be inj ac ted monthly as follows:- (a) Remove the cylinder cap and withdraw the acid bottle and cage, (b) See that the solution is at the correct level and stir it up with a stick. (c) Replace the acid bottle and cage after seeing that the former is intact and not leaking, (d) Ascertain that the delivery nozzle is not choked; this can be effected by inserting a piece of wire. (e) if the extinguisher is found to be in a satisfactory condition, the cap should be replaced and screwed on tightly. (f) Should the solution bo appreciably deficient in quantity, it should be emptied out and thrown away; the requisite quantity of bicarbonate of socia should then be dissolved in about 2 quarts of warm water and the solution poured into the cylinder and made up to the water line with clean water. If the acid bottle is broken or leaking, the appliance should be emptied, washed out and ' fully recharged. 3. The appliance will not function properly and may burst when put into use, if the cylinder is filled to above the water lino. If, however, the quantity of water put into the cylinder is insufficient, the extinguisher will be slow in functioning. Tho bicarbonate of soda used with soda-acid extinguishers must be fresh and should be kept in sealed containers and stored in a dry place; if it becomes damp or scale, it is rendered useless, 'hen striking the plunger so as to discharge the extinguisher, excessive force is not to be used; the pltm must be given a straight sharp blow to avoid bending the spindle. 4. ^ After being discharged for any purpose, soda-acid extinguishers are to bo thoroughly washed out an examined internally (special attention being directed to the seams) in order to ascertain whether the metal is badly corroded; if such is the case, they should be replaced by new ones.TELEPHON B: 3ERRARD 6351?
