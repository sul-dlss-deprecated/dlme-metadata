Foreign Office, &amp; 193^'.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 01 JESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. October 21, 1935. 1935 CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [E 6264/6264/34] Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Sir Samuel Hoare.—{Received October 21.) I HAVE the honour to inform you that the press has recently announced the foundation of the “ Touring Club of Iran ” as part of the programme of develop ing the tourist industry in this country. The president of the club is M. Jam. Minister of the Interior, and among its leading figures are M. Soheily and M. Ansari, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs; Dr. Sajadi, the Director-General of Customs; M. Amir Aslan, the Director-General of Roads; and Mr. Ebtehaj, head of the Travel and Propaganda Department of the Ministry of the Interior. 2. It is stated that the objects of the club include the establishment of hotels and rest-houses for travellers, and of workshops for repairing motor cars; the provision of information about roads and of guides to attend tourists, especially those from abroad; the establishment of telephone posts and first-aid posts along the main roads; and the provision of customs facilities to members of the club and of the International Touring Union who wish to cross the frontiers of the country ; and in general the promotion of legislation for the encouragement of the tourist industry. 3. The establishment of the ambitious hotels owned by the Shah along the Caspian littoral has been a first step in exploiting the undoubted possibilities of Iran as a tourists’ country. Recent reports, however, suggest that these hotels are not likely to maintain the standard of comfort at which they aim. It is at any rate to be hoped that the newly founded Touring Club of Iran will do something to improve touring conditions. But it will certainly be long before the last is seen of the endless red-tape and innumerable irritating regulations and restrictions which inevitably discourage all but the most determined travellers from touring in Iran. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad. No. 86. (No. 415.) Sir, Tehran, September 25, 1935. I have. &amp;c. H. M. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN.His Majesty's Representative presents his compliments to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit herewith, copies of the documents mentioned in the subjoined Schedule, on the subject of Persian Visa Regulations. Reference:-Copy (T 3498/3498/378). No. 34/442 d Con 39/2. Bub hire. Dated the 18th Pehruary 1934 Dear Chancery, For the past few months the Persian Consular officers at Karachi and Quetta have insisted on the deposit of two copies of the photographs of any person ©PPlying for a visa to enter Persia. 2. We cannot trace any warning regarding these additional photographs and feel that the matter cannot have been brought to your notice, but the inconvenience caused by an unexpected and last minute request for photos is very apparent. 3. Though this type of collecting mania is harmless though annoying we wonder if you could obtain confirmation of its necessity, as if so we would like to suggest to the Government of India that Passport Issuing officers are instructed to warn intending visitors to Persia. In the meantime we are sending a copy of this to Delhi. Yours Ever, Consuls te-Genera1 To The Chancery British Legation Tehran.lfo &lt; 341/3-2. /V- Dear Residenoy, Your letter 39/2 of February 18th. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs tell us that the demands now made to applicants for visas for Persia for two photographs when filling up their application forms, is in accordance with regulations issued in Dey Mah (Decemfcer-Jmuary) last to all visa and frontier authorities* It would no doubt he a good thing if this could he brought to the notice of prospective travellers to Persia by passport issuing authorities. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Forei^i Office (Ho. 115) and the Foreign Department of the Government of India (Ho* 49)* Yours ever, Chancery. The Residencyfcj 33 . ^) Residency Permits .—British sub jects continue to experience considerable difficulty with the Police in regard to their registration for ‘ Permits de Sejour There are many British Indians settled among the villages of Khorassan. In such places the local police are ignorant of the requirements of the law and have not informed such persons of the necessity of registering. When they ultimately learn of the conditions and come to Meshed they are fined, and sometimes imprisoned for failing to register earlier. The fines levied appear to bear no rela tion to the offence and no extenuating cir cumstances are admitted. The police require the attendance of each person at Meshed, and as the permits must be renewed annually this is a considerable hardship for poor persons, who reside at considerable distances, sometimes 100 miles or more by road, from Meshed. An applicant who applied some months ago was told to come to Meshed. He was ill and unable to travel and was told to come when he was well. He recently arrived and in spite of the fact that he had originally reported to the Police in due time, was fined for late registration.No. 51-7/6. Confidential. 9 oni«^ His Britannic Majesty^ Consulate, Z 6 Sistan and K«in, Camp, Me shad. Dated the 17th July 1933. Sir, co I have the honour to inform you of the difficulties vhich are now being experienced by travellers entering Persia by the Zahidan route. Ho less than three minute inspections of baggage are carried out in the first 50 miles on entering Persia. One at the actual frontier, and two later, inside Persia. The inspectors at these places refuse to pass tiie most harmless articles of small value. Por instance, the following articles mere confiscated from members of our Vice-Consulate at Zahidan when travelling on this route - a meat mincing machine - a normaX article of household equipment - (the household equipment and personal effects of persons who are to be domiciled in Persia is supposed to be admitted duty free under the Regulations) - an. artificial pearl necklace belonging to a wife of a member of the staff - a few reels of sewing cotton among the personal articles of another female relative of a monber of our Vice-Consulate staff. These articles were only returned after strong representation to the Belgian Director of Customs and even then certain Customs Pees had to be paid. A family of pilgrims consisting of 12 persons, were deprived of 8 cakes of Sunlight Soap and 3 cakes of toilet soap - a very reasonable allowance for personal use on a long journey. A fine, and customs duty amounting to 52 Rials was levied on these persons on the ground that the soap had not been declared on the frontier. Even so, the soap was not returned to the owners. Jemadar Syed Rashid Ahmad I.M.D. - an Indian commissioned officer vho was proceeding to join his post as Sub—Assistsnt Surgeon z H 1*3 22 \ - « s 3 a t our Vice-Consulate at Zahidan, had every article of his effects o 1.U „ . I- =2 ^ LLi ^ examined at Mirjawa. His sword, (part of his equipment in India which was not required in Persia, but not having been warned not to bring it^ he packed it with his kit) was confiscated. He arrived at Dar at- 2 - at 3 am; when every article of hie kit was again examined by lamp e «n over and his personal keys and light* Here his person was felt all o^er an* f Rs. 60/- in Indian currency notes were confiscated. On arrival at Zahidan the Belgian Director of Customs personally inspected one of his boxes. The keys and note~ were subsequently returned, but not the sword, which the Director states he cannot return without special authority from Tehran. In view of the fact that swords are on view in any bazaar, this action seems singularly futile. A few months ago. Captain Galloway, His llajesty*e Vice Consul went to Kundi to bring in his motor car. On return he was subjected to a most minute examination of his effects - needless to say, he carried nothing but a little bedding and clothing and no * objection could be raised. The Officials at Kirjawa apologised, but let it be known that they had received special instructions from the Director at zahidan* In this connection it is interesting to note that the Zahidan Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, who returned from a visit to Quetta in company with a personal friend of mine, had PO ne of hie effects examined, while the luggage of my friend was subjected to examination. The explanation of this is that the Bank Manager had been asked to bring in a number of articles for the Director of Customs, and had been told in advance that the necessary instructions would be given to the Mirjawa Officials not to search his kit* Captain Galloway informs me that the Belgian Customs Director interprets the Customs Regulations in so narrow a spirit and with such partiality in certain cases that his actions are entirely incomprehensible - so much so that Captain Galloway has been lead almost to doubt his sanity* A copy of this report is being sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have etc* Sd* C.K. Daly* Major C• J *£• His Majesty^ Consul, Si stan and K&amp;in* 4 To Hia Britannic Majesty^ Charge de Affair**, Tehran.MEMORANDUM. British subjects travelling to Persia are required to take note that : (1) All travellers must be in possession of valid national passports, bearing a valid visa for entry into Persia, issued by a Persian Diplomatic or Consular officer outside Persia. iV.B.—Persons of dual British and Persian nationality must be in possession of Persian passports for entry into Persia. (2) Exchange Control Law and its supplement was abrogated on 14th February 1932. Travellers need make no declaration of money brought into the country except in gold or silver. Export of silver coin is limited to twenty Tomans. (3) Export of gold in any form is prohibited, and so is export of silver coin (except to limit mentioned in paragraph 2) or bar silver. Import of silver, except worked objects, is aiso prohibited. (4) Dealings in foreign exchange are now free and there are no Govern mental restrictions on purchases and sales except as regards ex porter's exchange which is controlled by Government. (5) No undertaking to sell exchange will bfi called for in the following cases (a) export of travellers luggage and personal effects, (b) articles sent abroad in the form of presents or samples, provided that the value does not exceed Rials one thousand, (c) goods leaving Persia in cabotage. (6) No resident in Persia can import, except with great difficulty, any personal requirements. (7) All visitors to Persia are required by Law to register with the Police within eight days of arrival and obtain a permis de sejour (residence permit). Their arrival in a Persian town must be notified to the Police within 48 hours. (8) The children born in Persia of British parents are by Persian Law Persian subjects but, in certain cases, have the right of renunciation of their Persian nationality at the age of 18. (9) A Persian Transit Visa is valid for one month only and foreign travel lers including pilgrims whose stay in Persia exceeds that period are required to secure a renewal of the visa by applying to the Persian Police before the expiry of the term of original visa. Failure to do this renders travellers liable to be turned back from the frontier and to a fine of from 5 to 150 Rials at the discretion of the Persian Courts. ^ the interest of pilgrims visiting the Holy Places in Persia \\ hile en route to ’Iraq to apply for a transit visa rather than an ordinary visa, provided their stay in Persia is not likely to exceed one month. The transit visa will not, how ever, be granted by Persian officials unless the applicant already has a visa for some third country to which he means to proceed on leaving Persia. A pilgrim proceeding to Persia en route, to ’Iraq should, therefore, first obtain the visa for entry into ’Iraq and then apply to the Persian Consular or visa authorities specifically for a transit visa through Persia.

A Persian transit visa is ordinarily ra-ii-d ic± one month in transit through 1 ersia from the date ci entry to the date of recrossing the frontier to leava tne country, ./ol d. a nd the charge therefor is one gold franc. 3. A Persian ordinary visa is also issued with trie limitation of one mcntn's residence in Persia ana custs .do1d ten gold francs. But tne visitor's stay in Persia may be extended indefinitely suoject to coupli.ui.Cu wj.t- formalities prescribed oy tne Pc reisers residence Lav/. 4. The holder of a transit visa, provided he does not overstay the month, does not require an exit visa to leave the country. The month’s stay in the country on a transit visa may, in certain cases, be extended for a short period without liability for an exit visa, provided application LS inade for suon extension before the expiry of the original men th. 5. The holder of an ordinary visa good for one montt. is required to cotain an exit visa before he can leave tne coun try. 6. It is, therefore, in the interest ci pilgrims visiting tne Holy Places in Persia while en rout^ to ’iraq to1 2 n to apply for a transit visa rather tnan an ordinary visa, provided of course that their stay in x- ersia is not likely to exceed one month.. 7 . A transit vi sa wil 1, nov/ever, not be gran t ed by lersian officials unless the applicant already has a visa for some third country to 7 /hi eh he means to proceed on leaving Persia. A pilgrim coming from India to Persia en route to 'Iraq should, therefore, first obtain the visa for entry into 'Iraq and then apply tc the Persian Consular or visa authorities specifically for a transit visa through 1 ersia. 6.

Sir R. Clive to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received June 26.) (No. 313.) Sir, Gulhek, June 16, 1931. WITH reference to the third paragraph of my despatch No. 260 of the 30th May concerning the recently passed law governing the entry into, sojourn in and passage through Persia of foreign nationals, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of the regulations referred to in article 19 relative to the control of ships' crews, and of passengers, landing temporarily in Persian ports. 2. Article 8 of these regulations will be seen to exempt the crews of war ships from the application of the provisions which precede it. on condition, however, that the permission of the Persian Government has been obtained and that the port visited is a free one. As you are aware, those of His Majesty's ships which are periodically notified to the Persian Government as being stationed in the Gulf at present visit Persian ports by simple notification to the local authorities, this practice being sanctioned by a provisional arrangement which dates from the summer of 1928. The Persian Government have shown of late an increasing tendency to ignore this arrangement, and I shall shortly have the honour to address you separately on this question, but I doubt whether in practice the regulations now issued will be found to affect the crews of warships calling at Persian ports by simple notification. 3. As regards the applicability of the regulations in question to the crews and passengers of merchant ships, I am not aware how closely these conform to the usual international practice, but I presume that they contain no stipulation to which objection could reasonably be raised. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch, with its enclosure, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government' of India, the Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and to His Majesty’s consular officers at Kerman (for Bandar Abbas), Ahwaz, Mohammerah and Basra. I have, &amp;c. R. H. CLIVE. Enclosure in No. 1. Translation of the Regulations foreseen in Article 19 of the Law governing the Arrival. Exit and Stay of Foreigners in Persia. Article 1.—Members of the crews of merchant ships stopping in Persian ports, as well as passengers aboard such ships, whose intention is not to disembark in Persia, are allowed to land during the hours of daylight (and circulate) within the limits of the sphere of the port on the conditions laid down below. They must in any case return to the ship before sunset. Article 2.—Every passenger not having the intention to stay, who wishes to land temporarily whilst the ship is stopping in a Persian port, must, with the knowledge of the passport inspecting officer, hand over his passport to the police. If the passport inspection officer has no objection to make, the passenger’s pass port will be taken, and permission to land will be accorded for the period mentioned in article 1. On the passenger's return to the ship the passport will be returned to him. Article 3.—Members of the crews of ships coming to Persian ports must each be in possession of seamen’s cards, in accordance with international rules. Article 4.—For members of crews mentioned above each ship must have a roll wherein are stated the names and nationality of each member, and on the request of the captain of the ship or of the ship’s agents, a collective visa will a'2 be made on the roll by Persian diplomatic or consular officers abroad. Such visa will be valid for one year and for any number of visits the ship may make to the coasts of Persia. The fee for such visa will be 10 fr. gold. Article 5.—When a ship is lying at a Persian port, if the passport inspection officer finds the roll in proper form, he will sign it, and subsequently the captain of the ship will give to the police a list of the members of the crew who wish to^ land temporarily, and on the responsibility of the captain permission for them tc^T land will be given. Those whose names are on the list and who wish to land must hand their sailor's cards to the police on landing; the cards will be handed back to each individual when he returns to the ship. A rticle 6.—As regards sailing ships, it is possible for a general visa for the crew to be given on the master’s passport instead of on the ship s roll. In such cases the master's passport must contain the names and nationality of the crew. A rticle 7.—Those who infringe these regulations will be prosecuted and punished with the penalties mentioned in article 16 of the law 7 governing the arrival, stay and exit of foreigners in Persia. Article 8.—International custom and special regulations wall govern the landing of members of crew 7 s of foreign warships which may come to Persian free ports w 7 ith the permission of the Persian Government.P. z. THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTiTS GOVERNMENT PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. ie n; 1931. mm [E 3057/2762/34] No. 1. Sir R. Clive to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received June 11.) (No. 260.) Sir, Tehran, May 30, 1931. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of the text of a law governing the entry into, sojourn in and passage through Persia of foreign nationals. This law was passed by the Majlis on the 10th May, and will enter into force on the 6th June next. 2. In its general lines it will be seen to resemble the regulations controlling alien immigration into the United Kingdom. I fear, however, that it will be found to provide scope for intrigue and may possibly give rise to difficulties connected with the large foreign staff of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Khuzistan. I would refer you in this connexion to my despatch No. 200 of the 30th April, 1931, concerning the recent press campaign against the company and in particular against the employment by the company of foreign labour on a large scale. 3. I am endeavouring to obtain particulars of the regulations referred to in section 19 of this law, which will presumably affect the crews of British vessels in the Persian Gulf and may conceivably be made applicable to the crews of warships also. 4. With reference to article 18 (2) of the law, I should be glad to be informed whether there are any regulations applied to Persian consular officers, their dependants or their official staffs in British territory, which could plausibly be used by the Persian authorities as an excuse for molesting British consular officers, their dependants or official staffs in this country on grounds of reciprocity. 5. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Government of India, His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq and His Majesty's consular officers in Persia. I have, &amp;c. R. H. CLIVE. (Translation.) Enclosure in No. 1. t m jU d f.z Law Governing the Arrival in, Sojourn in and Passage through Persia of Foreigners. (Passed by the Majlis on the 19th Urdibehesht, 1310, equivalent to May 10, 1931, to enter into force on the 15th Khurdad, 1310, equivalent to June 6, 1931.) 1. EVERY foreign subject must obtain permission from the competent authorities for entry into, sojourn in, and exit from Persia. 2. Permission for entry into or passage through Persia must be obtained through Persian officials by means of a passport visa or papers based on a state ment of the civil status issued by the Government of the person in question. Persian officials abroad will abstain from according a visa in the following circumstances :— (a) If* there is any suspicion as to the papers submitted. ■ (fc) .Where persons, who, according to Persian law, are Persian subjects, wish , to enter Persia on other than Persian papers. (c)‘ Where the. presence of a foreigner in Persia is contrary to the peace of the country, or to public security, or for other reasons contrary to the welfare of the country. [173 1—2]{d) If the foreigner has formerly been condemned for a minor or major crime in Persia or in another foreign country. (e) If the foreigner has previously been expelled from Persia. (/) If the presence of the foreigner in Persia is undesirable from the point of view of general hygiene or for prevention of immorality. {g) If the foreigner cannot prove that his means of subsistence in Persia will be by virtue of the money he possesses or by reason of fruitful employ ment, and Persian officials abroad, in addition to the permit of entry, will give permission for a stay of thirty days in Persia, in accordance with the provisions of article 3. There will be exemptions from this rule in cases where the Govern ment makes special provision. 3. Whenever one of the impediments mentioned in article 2 was not discovered by the Persian official abroad at the time of giving the visa and/or became known later the competent officials can refuse to give permission for permanent sojourn or temporary stay and/or cancel the authorisation already issued. In each of the above cases, after the cancellation of the permission issued, the local police authorities will expel the foreigner from Persia. The determination of the reasons in this article, as also in the preceding article, is confined to the judgment of the competent Persian officials, but in cases other than those mentioned, the withholding of permission is not allowed. 4. The residence of foreign subjects in Persia falls into two classes— temporary residence and permanent residence. Permanent residence presumes that the foreigner has taken up a place of residence as recognised by law; otherwise he is accounted a temporary resident. The permission for temporary or permanent residence must be given by the police and no foreigner may reside in Persia without the aforesaid permission or longer than the period mentioned in the permission. Permission for temporary and/or permanent residence may be renewed and prolonged. 5. Foreign subjects, on the expiry of the period oi their permission to pass through and/or stay on Persian soil, are obliged to leave unless they have requested the police for a prolongation of the time and have received the necessary permission to stay. In permits for entering or passing through, it is permitted to state also that the frontier will be crossed once or several times. 6. The permit for permanent residence will be given by the Central Police Administration of the district in which the foreigner chooses hisplaceof residence, on condition that the stipulations of article 3 are observed. Previous to his arrival in Persia the foreigner may obtain such permission through the Persian representatives abroad. The permit for permanent residence must be renewed every year. 7. A permit to transit Persia will be given by Persian representatives abroad with consideration for the stipulations of article 3, and the foreigner may stay en route during the period mentioned in the permit (for the transit). ' It is possible for the route to be followed and the time necessary for the transit to be mentioned in the permit ; the latter time can be prolonged when necessary by the police. 8. Every foreign subject is bound to notify the police in writing of his place of residence within forty-eight hours of his arrival at anv place in Persia. Every foreigner staying in Persia must, within eight days of arrival at his place of abode, go personally to the police of the pjace and register his name there and take out a certificate. Guest-house keepers dfre bound to report to the police each foreign subject who stays in their house more than forty-eight hours. The register of foreigners which is drawn up in the Central Police Administration will be (considered as) the central register. The duty devolving under this article on foreigners of informing the police of their residence and of having their names registered can, by virtue of a regulation, be performed by a third person. 9. Every foreigner living in Persia must possess a document issued by his own Government proving his nationality and civil status. In cases of necessity the local police are empowered to give to a foreigner, who for some reason or other is unable to produce the aforementioned document, a temporary permit for sojourn or a special permit to leave Persia. In that case, the local police can fix or limit the foreigner’s temporary sojourn or the route tie■ I t o V) takes (to leave). In the document establishing the foreigner's nationality, and in the temporary permit^) s^oii rn^ a^spj^ i^ pu^i^etpjnention the names of his wife, children, and malo iand brothers and sisters not yet grown up who are under his keeping. 10. The permit to leave Persia will be given to the foreigner by the police of ^ the locality where he is permanently or temporarily residing. 11. In the following cases, it is possible to expel a foreigner from Persia or to change his abode. The competent authorities will fix the time limit for expulsion :— (a) If he does not comply with the stipulations of the law. (b) If, in accordance with articles 3 and 4, the foreigner's permit to transmit or reside is annulled; the Police Administration will put into execution the decision of expulsion of foreigners. \V henever a decision to expel a foreigner has been taken and it is contrary to the interests of the country to grant a delay, notice of ^ expulsion and of the time limit will be given to the foreigner in question either by the police or by another competent authority. Whenever the foreigner accepts to quit Persia within the time limit fixed, he will be allowed to go freely, otherwise he will go under guard. In cases where the foreigner is expelled under guard, the expenses of expulsion will be defraved from the revenues accruing under article 14. 12. In cases where a permit to stay is refused and a decision to expel a foreigner has been taken by the competent authorities appointed by the Government, the foreigner has the right to appeal to the Ministry of the Interior and request a revision of the above decision. This appeal will be made either in writing or by telegram through the ^competent authorities who took 4Jlk-iicc^ion^tne foreigner may cond directio tliG Atinistry of Interior the -(prc&gt;o?s)^rGft^ofI^r^^^^p his appeal. The submission of a petition for revision will delay the expulsion—except in cases where the reasons for expulsion are urgent interests of the country—but it is possible foi the police to keep the foreigner under its own special supervision until the result of the petition for revision is known. 13. In the interests of national security and/or public welfare and/or public ^ health, the Council of ^Ministers may take the following decisions regarding the limitations or conditions governing the arrival, residence, exit or transit of foreigners :— (a) Closing the whole or part of the frontier. (b) Interdiction of permanent or temporary residence m certain zones or of transit through certain zones. (c) The adoption of measures of special supervision of foreigners in special circumstances. 1 1 14. The following fees will be levied on foreigners for the issue of temporary or permanent permits and for the prolongation of transit permits; (1) One gold rial for the prolongation of the transit permit and the issue of temporary residence permits and their renewal. (2) Two gold rials for the issue of permanent residence permits and their renewal. 15. People mentioned below will be punished as follows with correctional imprisonment of from 3 to 12 months and with a fine of from 200 to 2.000 rials and/or to either one of these punishments unless their actions come within the scope of a law which fixes even more severe penalties :— (1) Anybody who falsifies a passport or a permit of residence or a transit permit and/or uses such a document knowing it to be false and/or procures for a third person such false documents. [173 1-2] B 2(2) Anybody who knowingly gives false testimony to the competent authorities in order to procure a passport or permit of residence or a transit pass and/or makes statements contrary to the truth and/or conceals facts relevant to the decision to be taken in regard to nationality and/or knowingly uses passports or permits of residence and /or transit passes obtained by such means. (3) Anybody who crosses the Persian frontier without the necessary documents or permit and likewise anybody who crosses (the frontier) by forbidden roads or unpermitted parts of the frontier. Anybody who, in support of his civil status and/or nationality, uses documents or papers and/or a declaration of civil status belonging to another, and anybody who in order to prove the nationality and/or civil status of a foreigner gives to another his own documents and papers and/or civil status papers.

(b) If, in accordance with the laws of Persia, in regard to prosecution and execution of sentence, a prescriptive limit intervenes. 16. Every foreigner who does not conform to the provisions of this law and/or any regulations and decrees which may be issued by virtue of this law, will be condemned to pay a fine of from 12 to 600 rials, unless, by virtue of this law or other laws, a heavier penalty may be inflicted upon him. 1 This same penalty will be inflicted also on guest house keepers who do not execute the duty mentioned in article 17. The prosecution of people contravening the provisions of this law will take place in the public courts. 18. The following categories will be exempt from the provisions of this law :— (1) Members of the Diplomatic Body, (2) Foreign consular representatives and their dependents living in the same house, and their official staff, but if Persian subjects of this category living in a foreign country do not benefit wholly or only benefit in part from such privileges, reciprocal treatment will be given to the subjects of that country in this class. Persian officials will give a diplomatic visa to the persons coming under sections 1 and 2 of this article, both for arrival in Persia as well as for exit and transit^-^r^yh^ # (3) Members of special missions to Persia from foreign countries who visit Persia with the approval of the Persian Government, and other persons who have diplomatic visas from Persian officials. Note. The regulations governing the execution of this article will be drawn up in a special decree by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in agreement with the Ministry of'the Interior. ' 19. Regarding the members and equipage of boats, and travellers whose intention is not to enter and live in Persia, and who have not got the documents mentioned in the law, but, during the temporary stay of the boat in Persian ports, disembark, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Finance will draw up a special ' reglement and notifv it to the Central Police Administration and the port officers.5 to the competent t of residence or a ry to the truth taken in regard to irmits of residence xit the necessary □sses (the frontier) mtier.. r nationality, uses status belonging to nationality and/or \vn documents and e decision taken to ters Persia afresh ■mentioned . t iL. regulations havmg'^A' broad for profit in id 4 of this article, bo Persia unless in as been condemned^ ia, in regard to prescriptive limit 20.
