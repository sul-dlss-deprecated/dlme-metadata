The Native Resident acknowledges the Governor in Council's letter of 9 April 1802 and states that he has written to the Governors of Sheraze [Shiraz] and Isphahaun [Eşfahān], informing them that a European gentlemen [gentleman] is touring the country. Mirza Mehedy Ally Khaun reports that Colonel Harcourt, who is in charge of a packet for Europe from the Governor General [Richard Wellesley], arrived at Bushire on 4 June and left again on 7 June. Mirza Mehedy Ally Khaun concludes by reporting on the country's political situation. He states that the country vessels dare not venture out to sea for fear of the Beneattabee [Bani Utbah] Arabs, while inland the whole of the country is in disturbance, as caravans from Bushire to Sheraze are frequently being plundered. The Resident encloses three months' worth of factory accounts (not included). The letter is followed by a postscript, in which Mirza Mehedy Ally Khaun states that he has learned that Cherauck Ally Khaun, Governor of Sheraze, has issued orders for 200 cavalry and 200 infantry to be sent to Bushire for the purpose of embarking for the Island of Bahareen [Bahrain]. The Resident also reports that Shaike Nasseer [Sheikh Nasir, Governor of Bushire] has bound himself down as security for the revenues that Said Sultan is to pay to the Persian Court.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100074833292.0x00002e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
