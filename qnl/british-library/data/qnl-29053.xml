Many thanks for your D.C. letter of the 3rd March No. D. 1143E/A7 about Hay's application for four months leave in the U.K. from the 15th June next. Assuming that, when the time comes to reach a decision on this, H.M.G. will have assumed responsibility for the control of British interests in the Persian Gulf and that Hay will then be directly under the India Office, we should not want to refuse the grant of the leave for which he has applied, and to which he appears to be entitled under the rules of the Indian Political Service. At the same time, we should not be frank if we did not say that Hay's absence from the Gulf for so long as four months during the corain • summer/summer will be a matter of some inconvenience to us, particularly if,as I understand his intention is, he goes off to Ireland and is not easily reached for consultation on matters which are likely to arise. Before we reach a conclusion, however, we should like to be quite sure that,if Hay goes on leave and Galloway is put in to act as Resident, there will be a SviTi***, /- P. S . no difficulty about finding Wofficer to officiate as P.A.Bahrein. This, of course, is implicit in the outline^ scheme of transfer forwarded with the Secretary of State's despatch of 3rd I'arch,/but we could not contemplate leaving any of the Gulf posts unfilled for as long as four months during the transitional period. If you can reassure us on this point, and if we can come to some arrangement with Hay by which he will keep in touch with us while he is on leave in the U.K. in case we want to consult him urgently on any points which arise, we should for our part consent to his being granted the leave for which he has applied.

If the matter ws&gt;at solely in our hands I do not think there is any doubt that Hay would get his leave and that we should put Galloway in to act. But presumably either before the 15th June, or at any rate during the period that Hay wants to be on leave, H.M.G. will have begun to take over their own interests in the Persian Gulf and consequently the question of the Residents leave is likely to become more a matter for H.M.G* to decide than for us here. Before I take this matter further, therefore, I should be grateful for any comments that you may have to make. 3. I am sending a copy of this letter to Hay. E.P.

I shouted to the driver to turn back which he did with astounding rapidity and while he was doing so about P-10 men sprang up of whom three had rifles. The others shouted to us not to move while the riflemen covered us and threw at least three large stones at the car one of which dented the frame of the windscreen about an inch above the glass, another cutting the top of the hood and a th ? rd came in through the open window as we turned and Just missed me, \s we dashed off dom the road after turning a couple of shots were fired after us without hitting the car, I found that the near hind mudgard had been crumbled up where the driver had hit the hillside in turning. T&amp;, On the way back I stopped all vehicles and informed/’Hang’ of 2 the gendarmerie without useful result as no one would take any respons ibility, I got a guide and went on to the house of the Carhang (Khos- rowdad) who had Just returned from Isfahan. He was presently produced in his pyjamas and undertook at once to send a posse to the scene of the hold-up. 5. I refuelled and went to the Hang here an indescribable scene was taking place. eluct mt soldiery were being r^ped in, the driver of the touring car in which the first ’ arty were se t was asking all and sundry who would pay for his petrol and oil, and the cretin in charge of the post as asking who would give him a recent for t he rifles issued. The touring car was packed full of men *nd despatched and a lorry sent to fetch more. 4. hi le this was ping on Captain XMon ?j arrived in a Jeep and said that he had come £n from 3aadatubad and found a truck at the line of stones empty except for two sheep.* This was about 6 p.m. s Sarhang Khosrowdad h‘d passed the scene of the hold-up at ^ about 4.30 and found nothing and the Jeep found nothing on the site at about 5.45 (they reached the f Iring* at about ; r.m.) the party of robbers did not spend very long at the scene of operations. The e ipty lorry must f course have reached the line of stones shortly after loft. I think the reason we were not fired on to start off with was p__th«t they thought it would not be necessary and that later the men who closed in got too near and into the line of fire of the riflemen until we started, to move off, hich did with great rapidity, and it was not until we were actually under weigh that they fired, the bullets rp .rently going high. Cur escape was due to the great skill and r.pidity with which my driver turned so big a car in so narrow a space. I don’ t think it re flects any credit on the Persian forces that ouch incidents can take place on the outskirts of the town. ( &gt;gd.)
