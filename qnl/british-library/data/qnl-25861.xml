They agreed that Andrew Weir might arrange passages in the Isbrandtsen Moller ships, provided the tickets were issued through their agents Gray Mackenzie, a justifiable provision, in the Minister’s view, to protect their own interests as a British line against foreign competition. In all the circumstances the Minister is of the opinion that the incident is not one calling for his intervention. With regard to the general question of facilities for passenger traffic from the Persian Gulf, to India, I am to state that, owing to the fact that so many ships are being used as troopships, few, if any, of the British passenger lines are able to meet the large demand for passages, and the case^-of the British India Line is the rule rather than the exception. The Minister is advised, however, that the British India Line will not raise objection to accommodation on other/ The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London, S.W.l.i other passenger lines, being used to the best, advantage when accommodation_on their own ships is full, subject to the provision that the tickets are issued through.their^agents.

Gray fcacicenzle, agents for the British Indian Line, asi Messrs. Andrew Weir and Company, agents' 'for the Is brandtsen oiler line of lew York. 2. In the light of the facts as stated by Mr. Weld- Forester the allegation levelled by Messrs. Jackinnon Mackenzie and Company of Bombay against Messrs. Andrew Weir that the latter were 'soliciting for passengers from Basra tu India' and that this was an 'intrusion in the Persian Gulf trade' seems quite unwarranted. The Xabrandtaen Moller Line has only recently started operating to Basra and In any case Messrs. Andrew eir were instructed not to take passengers after all. The incident, however, raises the question of the b. I. Line’s monopoly in the Persian |;ulf. 3 . it ie understood that the British Indian and p. and 0 . group obtained at so vie international shipping conference long ago an agreement with other groups that they would not t&amp;ke passengers or freightage from any ports in the Persian Gulf along routes served by Hie B.l. and P. and 0. group. (This agreement Is said incidentally to enable the B.l. to *s:eep its freight and passenger rates very high;. As hr. eld-Pores ter however points out in the last sentence of paragraph 3 of his letter the B.l. have for the past four months been unable to deal satisfactorily with the demand for passages tc India and there ie now a steady stream of evacuees coming through on their way to India who are being held up at Government expense both here and at Basra for leek of shipping aecofa &gt;odstl©n on the B.l. In addition we are of ©curse anxious to ensure that there will be sufficient accommodation available in case a large scale evacuation from the .ear bast becomes necessary later on. L # As Mr. Weld-Forester points out the situation is one which eee *8 to merit Govern ent intervention as it calls for the utilisation of all available shipping facilities. A question of policy is involved which cannot be settled by the shipping agents in Basra and I would suggest that it may be desirable to take the matter up with the Ministry of Shipping, who may wish to consider arranging for some relaxation of the restrictions imposed by the conference in favour of the B.l. line. 5 . It is understood that the B.l. have in fact a temporary and provisional understanding with the Silver Java Pacific, almost the only othei’ line which operates between Basra and Indian ports and he passenger accommodation, that the latter should take any The Right Honourable passengers The Viscount Halifax, K.a., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., etc., etc., etc.- 2 - passengers whom the former cannot accept. This arrangement could perhaps be extended on a similar baeie to any other lines with passenger accommodation which may ope rate on the Gulf route, 6 , A copy of this despatch is being sent to the 'Department of ‘. verseas Trade and to the Govern ent of India* and to His Majesty T s Consul at Basra. 1 have the honour to be with the highest respect, My L 0 rd, four Lordship *6 most obedient, humble Servant, iStfd) Basil Neman. x t/tS.;ENCLOSURE IN BAGDAD DESPATCH NO, 521 DATED 15TH NOVEMBER.19U0 No* 2535 * British Consulate, (18/5/7/S) Basra* SECRET* 29th October, 1940. My dear Halford, Your Secret letter of September 27th and enclosure from de Gaury - B.I. Monopoly. I think the matter now perhaps 'merits Government intervention' on the strength of the enclosed letter from Messrs. Shaw Wallis, Calcutta dated October 7th, addressed to Messrs. Isbraddtsen Moller Company, Incorporated of New York, copy sent to Adnrew Weir and Company here. The facts are as follows About the 20th September the Manager of the Rafidain Oil Company in Basra, who had been trying for weeks to get passages to India for Anglo-Iranian Oil Company employees, heard that there was accommodation on a vessel of the Isbrandtsen Moller line for which Andrew Weir are agents. Murchison of Andrew Weir told Blackford of the Rafidain Oil Company he could not take passengers without consulting Gray Mackenzie, the B*I. agents, because of the conference arrangement for a monopoly of passenger traffic. He telephoned Gray Mackenzie’s manager who said he would telegraph the B. I. agents, Mackinnon ,;ackenzie in Bombay and sent a wire 'Andrew Weir wish to book passengers for India' adding that the B.I. was fully booked and asking if there was any objection. In due course he received a wire to the effect that Andrew Weir might arrange passages in the Isbrandtsen Moller &amp;hip provided tickets were issued through Gray Mackenzie as is done in the case of passages by Silver Java line. This telegram only arrived after the ship had left and so was useless, and anyway in the meantime Andrew Weir had received instructions from Isbrandtsen Moller in New York not to take passengers. But note the wording of the enclosed letter It accuses Andrew Weir of soliciting passengers and not to their face but to a third party, thus putting them in a very bad light, a thing they have in no way deserved as it was only at the urgent request of Blackford that Murchison approached Gray Mackenzie. In fact he could not have been more straightforward about it. I asked Murchison to ask Gray Mackenzie’s agent for some explanation as I thought it would make less bad blood that way than if X did. The result was that, as detailed above, the latter denied ever having used the word soliciting, but tried to make out that this word had conveyed no different meaning from the text of his telegram 'Andrew Weir wish to book passengers' which savours to me of casuistry. He also speaking in front of Murchison to me down the telephone said 'Isbrandtsen Moller are well known pirates', an accusation which Murchison was at pains to correct to me immediately afterwards, pointing out that Isbrandtsen Moller ships are coming here under Ministry of Shipping charter to ship grain and are in no way interested in passengers. And anyway it was- 2 - PL was not Isbrandtsen Moller which was concerned in the particular incident, but Murchison himself, by way solely of trying to help the Anglo-Iranian and their stranded employees. So if any one was a 'pirate' it was Murchison and it was scarcely politjse of Gray Mackenzie to imply this in front of him, even if it was intended in a Pickwickian sense J The final sentence of Meckinnon Mackenzie T s letter is remarkable in view of the fact that the B.I. have been quite unable to deal adequately with demands for passages to India for the last four months at least, as we all v|ell know to our cost. Who actually was responsible for the accusation of 'soliciting' for passages levelled against Andrew Weir as agents for Isbrandtsen Moller is not clear, but presumably it was Maekiimon Mackenzie, ^tobay. Anyway, apart from the inaccuracy of any such Btatem&amp;nt and^the harm it might do to Andrew Weir vis-a-vis their principals, it all smacks altogether too much of the most outrageous kind of dog in the manger behaviour and the worst evils of monopoly in the face of situation where all possible shipping facilities are urgently required and a spirit of co operation is essential. I feel that in be Gsury’s phrase it would appear to 'merit Government intemention'. Yours ever, (SIGNED) WGLSTAN WELD-FORESTER. ENCLOSURE Exp/13. * Steamer Department, Air Mail.
