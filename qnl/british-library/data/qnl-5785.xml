Th# frontier Xin* of Kuwait is as follows:- starting from tL@ Southern portion of His al-Qulai’ah (42 miles from Kuwait) f with the town as centre it describes an arc towards the West until it intersects 29° latitude, and from this point runs in a straight line to the Batin, opposite the junction og the Wadi al-’Aujah with the Batin, The line then runs Northward along the Batin to a point Just south of the latitude of Bafwan: then Eastward, passing just South of Jahal Sanaa, Safwan and Uim Qasr, and so on to the junction of Khuwair with the Khaur f Afcdullah* The territory enclosed within this line and the Persian aulf, together with the island of War hah, Bubiyan, Maskan, Pailakah, • Auhah, Kuhhar and Umm al-Maradim, is recognised as belonging to Kuwait. The tract of country hounded on the North by the Sou thern portion of the Kuwait frontier as described abo*?e, on the East by the sea, on the West by the Shaqd# and on the South by the straight line running due East from the Shaqo through *Ain &amp;1- * AM to the sea North of Has al«Mlsh*ab, is recognised as common to the two States of Najd and Kuwait, J in which both enjoy equal rights. The Capital itself has a population of about 50,000 souls of whom the great majority are Arabs. The Persian com munity, however, has greatly increased in recent years and now consists of about 10,000 souls* There are over 4,000 Negroes, a few Jews, and two or three houses of Chaldean Christians froia ’Iraq. Outside the Capital the inhabitants of the principality are all Arabs, and are mostly nomads.
