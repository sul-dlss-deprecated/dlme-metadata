The procedure suggested in paragraphs 3(b) and 6 of letter No.9295/429/21, dated 9th December 1921, from the British High Commissioner, Constantinople, to the address of the Bombay Government, for the payment of the shares of pension (including the arrears due from January 1915) of the heirs of late Saiyaid Yakub Khan Tora now living in Constantinople and Stayrna appears suitable. This procedure, however, is in conflict with that already decided by the Government of India to be adopted in para. 7 of their Memo.No.1316 E.C., dated 20th October. 1921, to the address of the Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, There is no information in this office as to whether pensions for the quarter enling 31st December 1914 have been paid to the heirs of Yakub Khan. It is not also known if payment has been made i £15-15-0 a quarter, for the two quarters ending 30th June 1920 and 30th September 1920 to the 4 heirs of Yakub Khan living in at Constantinople. The exact dates or months of payment of the pension @ £15-15-0 a quarter for the 9 quarters from 1st October 1919 to 31st December 1921 are not also known.

Sir I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter Ho • 820^, dated, the 29 th ox Oc tober, in which you communicated to me the conclusions of the Government of India in the matter of the pension payable to the heir of the late Said Yacoub Khan. 2. It is not clear from the second paragraph of the memorandum from the Government of India whether the quarterly payment of £. 15 ~h 5 - 0 , made to four ox the heirs since October 1919, is to be considered as the equivalent of the shares - amounting approximately to 160 Rupees per quarter to which they were entitled# At the time when these quarterly payments were commenced and the value of the Rupee was about two shillings, the ' four shares were worth rather more than £*15'”15~ , 3&gt; but, with the depreciation of the rupee during the last two I years, the position has changed and latterly the pay- -ments have been in excess of the sterling equivalent ox the amount due in rupees in respect of each quarter. As I am ignorant of the method and rate at which the Govern- -ment of India has reimbursed the India Office for the eight quarterly payments already made, I am unable to ascertain whether or not the total ox the rupee equiva— ^ -lents of these sterling payments has actually been in 1 u n excess of the total amount due in rupees to these four heirs for the past two years# The Secretary, v The Government of Bombay / India# J. For(ru J, For the purpose of effecting payment of the arrears due to these four heirs, two course are therefore open : - (a) to consider the eight quarterly payments already made and the additional one, which, as I shall explain later, I propose to make at the end of the present quarter, as liquidating the shares of the four heirs for the period 1st October, 191? - 31st December 1 921 without regard to any discrepancy between the actual cost of these payments in rupees to the Bombay Government and the amount which would have been payable had payment been made in rupees as the instalments fell due; and to pay to them - preferably as stated below, by means of a rupee bill drawn on the Accountant General, Bombay - their shares in respect of the period 1st January 1915 30th of September 19195 (b) to calculate the whole amount due to these four heirs in respect of the seven years ending 31st December, 1921 , to deduct the rupee equivalent of the nine quarter -ly payments which will have been made, and then to pay the balance in the‘manner indicated above* In the event of this course being adopted, I. should require to be in- -formed of the rupee equivalent of each of the nine - quarterly payments so that the necessary adjustment might be effected* I4.* I have purposely refrained in the preceding paragraph from suggesting anything in the nature of a sterling settlement* It will be readily understood that such a settlement would, in view of the constantly fluctuating rate of exchange, be most unsatisfactory and would give rise to much difficulty, unless I war© inform _ed in advance Of the r ate at which the amount due in rupees should be converted into sterling# Further, if the system were adopted of drawing Rupee Bills direct on the Accountant General, B onibay, both in respect of the all arrears and of /future payments, the India Office would i no way be involved and payments would be effected on pre-war lines, except that they would be made quarterly #quarterly In arrear instead of in advance* I have the ^^ honour, therefore, strongly to recoinmend this course to the Government of Bombay, and shall be glad if I can b© informed as soon as possible of their approval and of their decision as to the method of calculating the arrears, so that the whole position may be adjusted up to the end of the present year. 5* The question of the payment of the arrears due to those heirs who have not been in receipt of the quarterly advances since the 1st October, 1919* will of course present no difficulty once a definite decision has been &amp; taken as to the manner in which the payments are to be ♦ made* 6 * It is now too late to make any change in respect of the payment to the four heirs for the current quarter, end the usual Bill for £*15~15&lt;»C will, therefore, be Arshl drawn on the Accountant General, India Office, I would propose, however, if my suggestion in paragraph if above is adopted, to institute the system of quarterly payments in arrear by Rupee Bills on Bombay as from the quarter ending 31st March 1922, and have the honour to request that the decision as regards rupee or sterling payment may be despatched in time to reach me before the i^th of March, 1922. If no reply is received before that date, I shall assume that my proposal is accepted and payment in respect of each quarter will be made by means of two Bills - one for the heirs resident in Constantinople, and the other for the only surviving heir in Smyrna ~ drawn in Rupees on the Accountant General, Bombay.

Memo ran dum No. 1516 E .0. Dated Simla, the 20th Octo Payment of pensions to the heirs of the late Saiyid Yakuh Khan, Tora, who are now residing in Turkey. Your letter No. 4175, dated the 28th May 192 The conclusions of the Government of India on the various questions raised in the papers forwarded by you are as follows 2. Question (a) . In the case of certain members of the family who have, since October 1919, been receiving a quarterly allowance of £15~15-’0, (said roughly equivalent to their shares in the original pension enjoyed by,the family), arrears should be paid for the period 1st January 1915, to 30th September 1919. 3* Question (b) . In the case of those survivors of the original beneficiaries who have received no payment whatever since the 1st January, 1915, full payment of arrears should now be made with effect from the date aforementioned. 4. In the case of both (a) and (b) above, in addition to the payment of arrears, current pay ment should now be resumed on the original scale. 5. Question (c) . As regards members of the family who drew pensions up to the outbreak of the war, but have since died, the definite con dition laid down when the pensions were originally sanctioned, must be strictly adhered to : that isis to say, the allowance of each individual must cease absolutely on his or her heath. In the case of the two deceased beneficiaries, Abdur Rahman and Abdulla, payments in arrean are due from the 1st January 1915, until the dates on which they died, viz., the 26th June, 1918, and the 23rd July 191*9, respectively. These arrears should now be disbursed to their legal heirs; but there should be no continuance after the dates mentioned of the pensions of the two deceased. This disposes of the request of Yakub Khan’s widow that the share of Baiyid Abdur Eahrnan, who left no direct heir, should be assigned to Abdur Rahim, or to the son of the latter. The condition referred to also debars consider ation of the suggestion that Saiyid ruzzafar, the survivoj/r of the two original beneficiaries who lived in Symma, should be accorded 'considerate treatment.' 6. The remaining individual case for consideration is that of Saiyid Abdul Kadir. It is observed from the papers forwarded by you, that in November, 1919, the Secretary of State for India expressed the opi nion that, in view of tne fact that during the war this man was employed in the Ottoman office, his pension should be discontinued, unless he severed his connection with the Ottoman Government and also was in actual need of assistance. It is reported that he has been employed at the Porte for over -- thirty years and still holds therein a minor post of no political importance; and is, moreover, in considerable financial straits. In view of these considerations and also of the fact that iu appears creditable that he should have elected to work insSe-ad of being content to idle, the Government of India consider that, instead of being stopped, his tension should he continued with arrears. *■HMBHHHhi fOi Britis) ■ High Gonruiesioner, Co tib t. n” 1 :,;1 r i o T)le 16th I : rch , 1921.

The British Ambassador at Constantinople draws on the Accountant General, Bombay, quarterly — 2 hills at three days sight for the suras of Bs.267«14-0 and Bs.107-2-0 for pension due on March 31st, June 30th, September 30th and December 31st. The Accountant General, Bombay, pays these bills which are presented at the — Comptoir National D’Escompte, and passes on the debit to the Comptroller India Treasuries. In support of these — payments the British Ambassador at Constantinople — forwards to the Accountant General the receipts of the pensioners, which he passes on to the Comptroller — India Treasuries. 2. As regards future payment, during the war, the Accountant General, Bombay, suggests that it might perhaps be* V be possible for the Consul General for the United States of America at Smyrna to draw the bill on him in the same way as the British Ambassador at Constantinople has done hitherto. The orders of the Government of India v/ould be necessary to permit the Accountant General, Bombay, to honour the bills drawn by the Consul General at Smyrna. 3. If however it be not possible to draw bills at Smyrna on Bombay, the Consul General at Smyrna might draw them on the Secretaxy of State at -- London. If these pensions are a charge on Indian revenues, the Secretary of State for India could debit them to India through the Exchange Account. Sir I . A.

The Honorable Henry Morgenthau American Ambassador, Constantinople. oir: I have the honor to report that a number of the places in which various of the British subjects now in 33agdad have been living are now subject to the payment of money as rent. Owing to the fact that the British Consulate premises v r ere used as a plague hospital and many cases died there and no assurances can be obtained that the place is now free from germs, I do not con sider it wise that the British subjects be transferred there. Under these circumstances, where necessary, this Consulate is paying the required rent, in each case having it to be as small as possible but, should the payments continue long, it is necessary to expend a comparatively large sum for this account. I believe that it would be well to specially invite the attention of those interested to this matter.

Among my enquirers is the Government of India, which evidently desires to ar range for some money to be sent to Turkey to be distributed among certain British Indian subjects residing there. It is impossible to remit money from here to Turkey either by Post Office order or bank drafts, but it has occurred to me that possibly you could arrange to send money from London to our Ambassador at Constantinople, by whom it would be distributed among the people whose names and ad dresses I would give you. I am very desirous of doing what I can to assist the Government of India in this res pect. If it is not possible for you to remit money to Turkey at present, can you suggest any other means by which funds would reach the parties in Turkey for whom they are intended.
