The name of the artist, written in black Nasta'liq script, appears in the lower right corner of the page. It was produced in the middle of the 11th century AH/AD 17th in Iran. Such drawings are often framed by poetic verses. This example is surrounded by panels of verses from a poem by 'Abd al-Rahman Jami (died 898 AH/AD 1492).
