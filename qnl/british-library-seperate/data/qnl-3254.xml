The folio numbers are predominantly positioned in the top right hand corner of the recto page of each folio; however, between ff. 1A-6 they are positioned in the centre. Foliation anomalies: ff. 1A, 1B; ff. 29A, 29B; ff. 45A, 45B; ff. 46A, 46B, 46C, 46D.

A third very short foliation sequence (again written in pencil) runs between ff. 276-283 and is also found in the same position as the main sequence.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file relates to the service of the holders of the position of Second Clerk at the Political Agency, Bahrain, and includes personal letters requesting leave, including leave on medical grounds; papers relating to leave, appointment and transfer of Clerks, travel expenses, travel arrangements, salary, and leave salary; office orders announcing appointments and transfers of Second Clerks; statements showing Treasury cash balances, 1938 to 1940 and 1944; and medical certificates with related correspondence.The date of the final item of correspondence in this file is 1 November 1944.
