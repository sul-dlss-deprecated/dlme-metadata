Sir, I ha-ye the honour to state that in Chapter II, paragraph 4 of the Bast Indies Station urder Book it is laid down that when His highness the Sultan of Muscat pays a visit to any of His Majesty^ ilhips. His Majesty’s ships in harbour are to be dressed overall and manned, ana a salute is to be fired by the ship visited as his highness leaves her. 2. The ex-Sultan as far as I am aware never visited a ship except to return a call or on some formal occasion. when it was ri$nt that he should be received with the customary honours, and the regulation therefore was quite suitable, nowadays however circumstances have changed: the present Sultan lias for some time past been President of the Council, and in this capacity has frequently visited and travelled in His Majesty’s ships, ana lias cultivated y V personal relations with naval officers, and enjoyed their hospitality. It is very desirable that His Highness should still occasionally be able to visit aur and other places in his dominions in warships when opportunity offers, ana it/it is also desirable that the friendly personal relations subsisting between him and naval officers should continue and that he should participate in game a and in informal social functions, etc. The rigid ruling contained in the East Indies station order Book however makes no provision for infoxmal visits by His Highness to His Majesty^ bhips, and prescribes a very elaborate procedure on each case, and practically precludes informal visits. I would therefore suggest that if His Hxcellency the Maval Commander-in-Chief sees no objection, the words informal occasions His Highness should merely be received with a bugle. If there was any doubt as t o the nature ascertain His Highness* wishes through the j^olitical ably only be adapted when His Highness was returning a formal call, or at the conclusion of a journey in one of Hig Majesty*s ships, or on some special occasion. Excellency the Haval Coramander-in-Chief, xhot His Majesty's 'a visit* in Chapter II, paragraph 4 of the book, should be amended to read *an official visit*, and that on of the visit, the naval officer, concerned could always Agent. But in practice the full ceremonial would prob 1 am sending copies of this despatch to His Secretary of State^r India and the Senior MavaL officer, Persian Gulf Division.
