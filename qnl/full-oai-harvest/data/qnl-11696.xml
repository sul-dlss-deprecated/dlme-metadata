The correspondence mainly concerns British objections to an arrangement by which the Muscat State acts as a debt collecting agency on behalf of creditors against members of the ruling family. The system reportedly encourages merchants to lend money to members of the ruling family, with the State then collecting the debts out of the family allowances.Notable correspondents include the following: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; Bertram Sidney Thomas, Finance Minister for Muscat State.In addition to correspondence the file includes tables listing details of the debts owed by certain members of the ruling family, covering the period 1923-1930.The Arabic language material consists of a notice issued by the Muscat Council of Ministers.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Council of Ministers</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Financial Advisor to the Sultan of Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Family finance</topic></subject><subject><topic>Debts</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00000a#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00000a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
