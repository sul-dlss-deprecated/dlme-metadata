Ministry realise fully that scheme as worked lost season fell short of expectations but are confident * that with experience gained main object of ensuing supplies at reasonable price will be attained in coming year provided they receive cooperation of authorities in ?importing territories. Main defects in ?last seasons scheme in addition to its late ?ina uguration were (1) Owing to inflation of estimate of incidential costs sale price was fixed at a figure which allowed a margin over garden price large enough to encourage smuggling. (2) Weirs failure to consider purchase of dates immediately scheme started and their practice of sending merchants to growers for supplies instead of arranging these themselves retarded procurement, caused misconception and resentment regarding Ministry s profits. Regarding (1) Ministry under- stand smuggling ceased when price was reduced to Commission) shillings. For coming season it is hoped with .( mut)(mut) (mut) and proposed reduction in Weirds commission ?to fix sale price below price of 21 shillings provided garden price does not exceed that paid last season. This depends on negotiations now proceeding in Baghdad. Regarding (2) w e irs will be instrtiicted at earliest possible moment to commence active purchasing in advance of any commitments with buyers and will be expressly forbidden to send merchants to secure their own dates from garden, ihus hoped supplies will be available in Basra &gt;to take full opportunity of earliest dhow traffic to sheikha doms.

The Bahrain Government would prefer to make its own arrangements for buying dates through its agent in Iraq as was done the year before last. The Govern ment placed orders with the agent who bought and ship ped the dates to Bahrain. 3. If however owing to the monopoly this will not be possible then there seems no other course than to agree to purchase through Messrs. Andrew Weir, though owing to the confusion which resulted last season, His High ness is reluctant to have any further dealings with this firm. 4. In any case we cannot at present state what quan tity of dates will be required as there is a possibility of our having a surplus of Basra dates after the present season. The quantity required would be not more than our total purchases this year and might very likely be less. have discussed the question at length this morning Adviser to the Government 5.Z^ . j' Telegrsra From To No 489 Dated 2.7th May, 1944. political /gent, Bahrain.

Dear Prior, With reference to India Office telegram No.10840 of 10th Hay you may care to see the enclosed copy of a memorandum prepared by the Ministry of Food on the subject of the Iraqi dates scheme. You will notice that in section 4 (d) a possible figure of 19/- per cwt. is mentioned for the coming season. The Ministry of Food, however, now think that it is unlikely that they will be able to achieve that and are doubtful whether it will be possible to get lower than 20/- Yours sincerely, bd. R.T. Peel. The Hon'ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., The Residency, Bushire.IRAQ DATES - COORDINATED DISTRIBUTION . 1. Purpose of the Schem e. The short crop in 1942 enphasised the supply uncertain ties resulting from the uncontrolled marketing of Iraq dqtes. This among other consequences resulted in the U.K. only receiving f 10,000 tons of cased dates against a contract for that season of 45,000 tons. It was felt, therefore, to be desirable to attempt to bring dates under allocation in a similar manner to the procedure adopted for all other important crops under Combined Food Board machinery. This involved not only the control of cased dated, but also basket dates which are imported solely by India and Kiddle East countries. 2. Outline of the worklnx;the .schen e. It was the original purpose of the Cche-.e to purchase on GovernmentjfGovernment terms the entire production of Ir a q dates, and after making provision for local consumption to bring all exports under complete control. It soon became apparent that this design could not be realised and progressively the con ception of a direct contract between the Ministry of Food ( for H.M.G.) and the Iraq Government emoracing all Iraq dates had to be abandoned. By an endorsement of the original Concession agreement the purchase v/as effected between Andrew Wei?, &amp; Co, acting as principals, and the Basra Date Association. The Concessionnaires thereafter sold to the Ministry and acted as their Agents in the control of distribution. Euphrates growers held out for higher prices than it was agreed to nay 1n Basra and remained outside the scheme in its original form. Quotas were fixed for importing areas by M.E.S.C. in con sultation with the territories concerned, and deliveries were made by Andrew Weir &amp; Co under the instructions of the Ministry of Food in accordaxice with these allocations. Normal trading channels ?/ere used as far as possible, although in the case of Palestine and Baud! Arabia purchases have been centrally arranged. All sales were made to the recipient countries F.O.B. against 100/2 payment with no subsequent claims for quality. The prices originally fixed were calculated upon estimates of the costs intervening between the naked price and F.O.B. which were furnished by Andrew Weir &lt;?: Co. To these costs were added Weir * s agreed commission of 2/2 d.. and Ministry contingency reserve of l/lC d. The analysis oi the F.O.B. price of 25/- per cwt. was thQss- Ex garden cost 14/6d. Packing and other costs. 6/6d. A.W. commission 2/2d. Ministry reserve l/10d. 25/- — Experience gained in the working of the scheme disclosed a con siderable over-estimate of the packing and other incurred costs and by virtually eliminating its allowance for contingencies the Ministry was able to reduce the F.O.B. price for basket dates at the beginning of February to 21/- F.O.B. By this time however, substantial smuggling had undoubtedly taken place owing to the excessive margin between the ex garden and F.O.B. prices. Although the Euphrates growers had refused to accept the terms offered to them it was hoped to prevent their defection from dis turbing date markets in the Middle East by aaing military con trol of the Ir a q railways to deny transport facilities to Euphrates dates. It was anticipated that this might hav§ the further result of diverting some tonnage of Euphrates dates southward to be offered in the Basra Liwa. The ban on trans port proved effective and in February Andrew Weir &amp; Co were approached by the Iraq Authorities to purchase all Euphrates/ datedkdates offered to them and agreement was reached at prices equivalent to ID.55 per kara delivered Baghdad. Although this raised the cost of Euphrates dates in comparison with Basra dates the same selling price of 21/- F.O.B. or F.O.B was maintained except in sales to Syria where the actual cost price was charged. Whether due to the advancing season or to the effects of smuggling on an even larger scale than had been anticipated a sharp drop in demand since the conclusion of the Euphrates purchase threatens to embarrass the Scheme with substantial tonnages of surplus dates. The Red Sea ports, Saudi Arabia, Palestine and most of the Persian Gulf areas have indicated that their requirements have now been satisfied and Syria appears disinclined to make any centralised purchase within the framework of the Scheme. Analysis of results . According to the latest information available the results of the Scheme for the 1943 crop have so far been as follows:- EX BASRA Original allocation Deliveries India 9,500 7,320 Aden 6,750 3,795 British Somaliland 4,000 2,318 French Somaliland 800 - Palestine 750 155 Tanganyika 40 - Zanzibar 500 251 Bahrein 4,500 2,097 Xoweit 2,250 416 Saudi Arabia 8,000 1,754 Trucial Coast 4,500 2,759 A.I.O.C. 500 500 EX EUPHRAT ES Palestine/TransJordan 6,000 2,595 Syria/Lebanon 7,000 Other areas as required 12,000 It cannot be claimed that the Scheme in its first ( and ad mittedly difficult) season has been as successful as was hoped and it may be useful to summarise briefly its inherent defects and their causes. (a) Final instructions were given to I'urchison of Andrew Weir &amp; Co. at the end of September regarding the allocations for all Middle East areas, although detailed information re garding the quantity to be packed in cases and the requirements of basket dates was sent at the beginning of September. Murchison has repeatedly stated that the tardy issue of instructions seriously interfered with early procurement and delivery and it must be accepted that his complaint is not insubstantial. (b) Although Andrew Weir &amp; Co., London, were advised by letter on 6th July that the Ministry would purchase from them all dates fit for human consumption of Hallawi, Khedrawi, Sayer and Zahdi types of 1943 crop which they could purchase, it appears that in the early part of the season Murchison instead of setting out to make all possible purchases so as to be in a position to make immediate deliveries from stocks, sent merchants out to the gardens to make their own contracts with growers. This retarded procurement and caused grave miscon ception and resentment regarding the margin apparently absorb ed by the Ministry and their Agents on these transactions.(c) It is clear that this margin between the naked ex garden price and the original F.O.B. selling price of 25/- was excessive and encouraged snuggling on a wide scale, smugglers had ample room to pay the growers higher prices than ID. 40 per kara and still resell at less than the prescribed F.O.B price of 25/- per cwt. under zhe scheme. (d) The factors outlined above in (a) (b) and (c) contributed to cause a serious restriction in the volume of supplies available for the Sheikhdoms through the controlled channels. Althourh the somewhat inexplicable collapse of demand in recent weeks seems to indicate that these territories did An fact secure some supplies, presumably through smuggling, it would appear incontestable that the flow of supplies to them was unduly delayed. (e) Where centralised purchasing by the recipient country has obtained, delays havo occurred in finalising arrangements for payment and this has caused difficulties in relation to tne positioning of transport and shipping. Wether, however, such delays have ultimately reduced the total deliveries to any territory is doubtful, except possibly in the case of Saudi Arabia. (^f) The insistence of certain territories, particularly the ^haiklidoms, upon Sayers as against 2ahdis or other types at the same price limited the nuantitias which could be made available at particular times and doubtless resulted in some dhows sailing without full cargoes. Arranpement s for 1944 season . Although the experience of the initial year of control has reen discouraring, and although the Scheme nay not have appeared to offer advantages commensurate wihh its defects, it is felt that its intrinsic merits are such as to warrant its continuance for a further season if the support of the territories concerned is maintained. It is at least arguable that, even if disappointing in its direct results, it mater ially assisted in restraining the flight of prices and in giving some measure of direction to the flow of supplies. The experience gained, moreover, has been invaluable, particularly on price and cost matters, and lias clearly emphasised the factors which are essential to its smooth running. The fundamental elements of the procedure for 1944, assum ing a general agreement to the continuance of the Scheme, may be summarised as followss- (a) The Iraq ^ovornraant have again resisted proposals for a Government to Government contract, and as far as Basra dates at least are concerned the agreement for purchase will rest between Andrew Weir &lt;1 co. and the Date Association. On this occasion every effort would be made to include Euphrates from the inception. Andrew Weir would resell to the Ministry of Food and act under their direction for distribution. (b) Naked ex garden prices would be held to ID. 50 for Hallawi and Khedraqi, and ID. 40 for 2ahdi and Sayers. ( Braim and Chibchab which caused considerable pj^obleros in disposal would not be handled under the scheme.) (c) It would be hoped to secure 70,000 tons from the Basra area and 30,000 tons from the Euphrates area, of which not more than 4^,000 tons would be packed in cases for delivery \to the U.K., Services and Russia. (d) The Ministry would insist on a reduction in Andrew Weir's remuneration and by shading its own provision for contingenc ies to the narrowest margin, subject to Treasury approval, would endeavour to sell basket dates at around 19/- per cwt. F.O.B. This it is felt would reduce the margin within which■ m $ i • e smugglers could function to unattractive dimensions^ and thus remove a serious impediment to the smooth running of the Scheme. (e) Murchison would be instructed at the earliest possible moment to commence active purchasing in advance of any commitments with buyers, and would be expressly forbidden to send merchants to secure their own dates from the gardens. In this way it would be hoped that supplies would be available in Basra to take full opportunity of the earliest dhow traffic to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea ports. (f) M.E.S.C. would be asked to re-examine the requirements of Middle East areas particularly in relation to the net imports of Saudi Arabia. Based on this Year f s experience of demand it is provisionally suggested that the allocation of the 60,000 tons of basket dates might be along the following liness- tons. India 27,500 Saudi Arabia 2,000 3haikhdoms 12,000 Palestine, Syria etc 10,000 Red Sea ports and African coast 7,500 Ceylon l . i .Q.Q0. 60.000 It would be hoped that territories accepting an agreed allocation would guarantee to take up that quantity if offered within a specified period- say up to January 31st, 1945. (g) The cooperation of the rail authorities through the Ministry of War Transport would be invoked to secure a^ continuance of the check upon unofficial exports by rail from the Euphrates area. It would be a condition of the continuance of the co- ordination scheme that import controls should be maintained by the consuming territories. Although a price of 19/- per cwt• F.O.B against a naked price per kaka of ID. 40 would, it is hoped, be a deterrent to large scale smuggling, it is desired to prevent the intervention of would-be private buyers as this might well encourage growers to withhold their dates with consequent embarrassment to the smotth functioning of the scheme.

Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.E Adviser to the Government of Bahrain Bahrain. To His Britannic Majesty 1 s Political Agent Bahrain. Sir I have the honour to state that His Highness Shaikh Sulman wishes me to inform you that after care ful consideration and after a lengthy discussion with the Food Control Committee he has decided not to pur chase any dates this season through the firm of Messrs. Andrew Weir 8c Co. of Basrah. The following are the reasons which caused him to make this decision. 2. The Bahrain Government now holds a stock of 3450 tons of Basrah dates consisting of 2660 tons from the 1943 crop and 790 tons from the 1942 crop. Last year the Bahrain Government received 2270 tons of Basrah dates from the quota which was allocated to Bahrain. In addition to these the Government bought 1412 tons of similar dates from independent shippers who bought dates, ostensibly•from Persia, to sell in Bahrain, local merchants bought another 200 tons of dates from dhows,which were sold in the bazaar. The 2270 tons which were bought through the firm of Messrs. Andrew Weir cost the Government Rs. 8,18,000, including all expenses, an average of Rs. 13/8 per basket of 84 lbs.The 1412 tons, which were not quota dates, were bought at different prices varying between Rs. 12/- and Rs. 6/- per basket, the total cost amounting to Rs, 3,70,000/-. The average cost per basket of non-quota dates was Rs. 10/- At the end of the season non-quota dates were being offered for sale in the harbour of Manamah at very low prices but as the Government held a very large stock of expensive Basrah dates it was decided that a ban should be imposed on the purchase of any more imported dates in order to avoid the danger of the Government being left again, as was the case in the previous year, with a quantity of unsold dates on hand. Large quantities of dates, identi cal to those bought from Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Co. were being hawked round the Gulf and after being refused by Bahrain they were sold on the mainland at Rs, 3/- or Rs. 4/ per basket. The Government’s action in forbidding the import of cheap dates caused some resentment among the public who were not acquainted with the facts of the situa tion; this unsatisfactory position was the direct result of the inability of the authorities in Iraq to prevent dates being smuggled out of Iraq and sold in Gulf ports. 3. The 790 tons of dates from the 1942 crop, held by the Government, are the remainder of the 1000 tons referred to by me in my letter to you No. 1902/50SF of October 5th 1942. Only about 210 tons of these dates were sold since that date and if these dates were reweighed it would be found that there was a very considerable shrinkage. These dates are now offered for sale at one quarter of the price which they cost the Government, only a small proportion of them are fit for human consumption but they are useful for feeding animals. On this transac tion it is probable that the Government will be about Rs. 2,70,000/- out of pocket.4. His Highness Shaikh Sulman does not wish to give any guarantee to buy more dates because our stock of 1943 Basrah dates, 2660 tons, over 70,000 baskets, is sufficient at the present rate of consumption for the needs of Bahrain for the next tv/elve months. In this connection I cannot understand on what basis your \ estimate of Bahrain ai - - ■ - tion, stated in your letter C/1342 of '2to be 12,000 tons yearly, was formed. Even in peace time there was never an annual average import of 7500 tons. 5. The local consumption of imported dates for the last 12 months was approximately 2400 tons, 65,000 baskets, and this period included one complete diving season. The following facts have contributed to the great decrease in the consumption of dates (a) A basket of Basrah dates which used to cost in Bahrain Rs. l/- or Rs. 1/8 now costs about Rs. 14/-. Nobody, especially in these times^ can afford to buy the same quantity as they used to in the past owing to the enormous increase in price. The public eat less dates and in the villages they eat a larger proportion of cereals. (b) The local date crop last year was a very good one and the present crop is equally good. The G-overnment controlled the prices of locally grown dates giving the sellers a generous rate but a rate considerably lower than the price of imported dates. In the past owing to imported dates being available at cheap prices a large proportion of the Bahrain crop was used not for human consumption but for feeding animals. Lately the people have been using types of locally grown dates, which they did not previously £ eat, as food for themselves. Local production increases every year.J — 4:— (c) Until last year there was no absolute ban on the export of dates which were taken away by every vessel calling at Bahrain as supplies for the crews. Since last year the purchase of dates by nakhudas, other than men of the pearling fleet, has been forbidden except for a small ration per head which is restricted to the barest minimum to last the crew till they reach the next port. (d) The control of date prices by the Government and the distribution of dates in all parts of the state through Government shops has put an end to much wastage and loss. An illustration of the date position is the fact that until about two years ago beggars asking for alms at houses in the towns were always sure of being given a double handful of dates, today the beggars complain that nobody gives them dates, except the Bahrain Government which issues dates daily to about 700 deserving cases in Man amah and Muharraq.

Non quota dates sold last year at Pcs.10 and large quantities of dates offered at Rs.5 sere turned away at the harbour to avoid further financial loss to the Bahrain Government which has lost about three lacs over quota dates. Turning away of cheap dates has seemed indefensible to local people and aroused mur*h discontent. (b) Gxhorbitant date prices have brought about increased con sumption of cereals and local dates (formerly used largely for „ animals)• (c) Btrict rationing of reduced pearling fleet, complete ban on export, and control of prices arm distribution have also reduced consumption. 3. .

On the assumption that the former trade in dates between the Gulf Shaikhdoms and India was merely the re-export by the Shaikhdoms of dates imported by them from Iraq, it was decided that India's date imports should be centralised in Iraq and that Muscat and imports from the Gulf Shaikhdoms were accordinply banned. It was in any case thought improbable that the remaining Shaikhdoms would, under existing conditions, have any surplus for export to India. this*policy on the ground that imports from Iraq^ consisted almost entirely of wet dates, and that the prohibition on import from the Gulf ^haikhdoms other than Muscat had the had the effect of cutting off India's supply of dry dates, formerly received mainly from Bahrain, Kuwait ana the Trucial Coast. Some strength is lent to this argument by the fact that considerable consignments of dry dates from the latter territories have apparently recently been exported by them to Karachi and cleared under penalty, as licenses could not be obtained, while there is also the consignment referred to in your letter No. G/5^ dated 10th March, 1^45, Customs clearance permit for which has recently issued. tv*. * 4.

No-v Memorandum:- With reference to your memorandum No.2510-29/25 dated 17th June 1945. The dates referred to in your letter are boiled dried dates known as SILUQ. They are mainly prepared in Katif and exported thence to India. In the past; before the restriction on the export of dates from Saudi Arabia, some 30,000 bags of these dates used to be exported from Saudi Arabia to India via Bahrain. Not more than 1,000 bags of dates were produced in Bahrain and sent direct to India. They are not eaten locally and two years ago, owing to the shortage of dates in Bahrain, the production of SILUi* was forbidden. Bahrain has no surplus of dates and during the war dates have been imported from Iraq. Before the war Bahrain's needs were supplied mainly from Saudi Arabia. The contention that the action of the Government of India is responsible for preventing the import of dry dates from the Gulf appears incorrect because the main reason for this trade having ceased is the prohi bition in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia of theExport of dry dates.

Adviser to the Government. AY.Minutes of a Food Control Committee Meeting held in the New Gavernment Office at lO.a.na, on Wednesday, the 4th January, 1950. H.E.Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa alKhalifah, C.I.E., presided, and the following members were presents Mr.C.Dalrymple Belgrave, C.B.E., Adviser to the Govt. Mr.G.W.R.Smith, M.B.E., Food Controller. Shaikh Ibrahim bin Mohamed alKhalifah. Haj.Abdulrehman Abdulwahab al Zayani. Haj.Khalil bin Ebrahim Kanoo. Haj.Abdul Nebi Busheri. Haj.Mohsin al Tajir. Haj.Ahmed al Taweel. Mr.Mohamed Saleh Shater. Mr.Ibrahim al Khalfan. &gt;s^^AHRAtN* The Adviser informed the meeting that at the end of this Arabic month of Rabia al Awal, the period for allowing the import of dates into Bahrain free of Customs charges would expire, but that His Highness had agreed to extend the period and if necessary control the price of dates. With the introduction on the 1st Muharram 13^9&gt; of the privilege of allowing dates into Bahrain duty free, and giving barter sugar in exchange, the price of Busrah dates dropped to Rs 12.8.0 per basket of 84 lbs, to-day they were up to Rs 16/17 per basket, and it was felt that certain merchants were hoarding their stocks in anticipation of a rise in price when the free period expired. Haji Khalil Kanoo recommended that the period be renewed for a further three months, the Food Controller proposed that it be ex tended for an indefinite period and this was unanimously agreed to. A notice to this effect has been published and it is hoped that the price of dates will fall consiaerably as hoarders will now be forced to disgorge their stocks. The Adviser next informed the meeting that information had been received from H.B.M’s Political Agent that it was most unlikely that the Bahrain Government would receive further rice supplies from Egypt in 1950* The meeting appeared to be of the opinion that plentiful supplies of rice would be forthcoming from Iran, but both the Adviser and the Food Controller were of the opinion that it was advantageous to all for the Government to hold certain stocks, thereby keeping the open market price within reason. Enquiries are to be made by the Government from Messrs Hassam Premji &amp; Co., Rangoon re the possibility of their obtaining- supplies of rice from Burma during 1950. Haji Khalil Kanoo next proposed that all price control be abolished, the Food Controller however pointed out that this was not possible in regard to quota foodstuffs, and goods imported from Holland, Sweden, France and Italy with currency received through the medium of the Political Agency. After a somewhat lengthy discussion it was decided to leave conditions as they are at present. 1 The meeting then closed at 11.a.m. v TO; H.B.M's Political Agent, Bahrain. F** c.c.The Adviser, the Govt.of Bahrain, \l-to n-t. 4 v _ *• &gt;. tik Jf /* *- ; (§4) N S DATES It is proposed thnt the Ministry of Food should control the purchnse of dates in Iraq this year. It is suggested that Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Co. should again act as the Minis try's agents. It is proposed to reduce Messrs. Andrew V&amp;r's co/nmission and to fix the sale price below Sh.21/- a maund provided the garden price does not exceed that paid last year. Messrs. Andrew V eirs will buy forw ard and will deliver direct to Shaikhdoms* agents. Thus supplies should be available in the beginning of the season in Basrah. (Id) T.H. 21-6-44 P.5. Remember Messrs. Andrew Weirs have 12,000 tons of dates in their hands from last year's stock. 2&gt; A / £S QUO 7-/1 _ FO£ ^ A l/y Afyj) txucial coastx* lv\ u V /. /. J. kr. v/ i P.A. I made enquiries from Fakhroo about Iraqi dates and obtained the following information from them. They say it is not possible now to know what the quality of the crop of the coming season would be as there are still about 70 days for the dates to ripen. During this period sandstorms and ^aus’ winds may blow. Should there be nothing of this, the crop will be good otherwise bad. It would be possible to know the quality of the dates at the end of July or in the beginning of August. Usually the pricos of all dates are fixed by the Monopolists, Messrs. Andrew ''eir &amp; Co., and approved by the Ira/i Ministry of Finance and the Board of Dates. At the end of the season last year date prices were high, i.e., about I.D .50 per kara (of 40 maunds = ?6 kilos) but this year it is on the contrary, there is oomparatively less demand and the prices are very low. In Fakhroo 1 s opinion, the prices for the coming crop will be 3^0 less* as there^still large quantities of old dates for sale and the quantities already shipped to India have not all been sold 3 a large amount is still lying at Karachi and CLC Bombay due to the unavai^lbity of transport to the interior of Ind b \.

Included in the file is a comprehensive memorandum written by the British Ministry of Food Dried Fruits Division in Wales in 1944, describing in detail the Ministry’s wartime scheme for the central purchase and coordinated distribution of Iraqi dates throughout the Middle East, India and Africa, following the short Iraqi date crop of 1942. There is also correspondence between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire and the India Office in London in 1944, about the merits of the British governmental central purchasing scheme for Iraqi dates, for keeping prices down, preventing wartime profiteering, ensuring fair distribution and discouraging the sale of smuggled Iraqi (and Persian) dates in Persian Gulf ports. These concerns are discussed repeatedly in correspondence throughout the file.In 1944, the Political Agent, Bahrain discusses in detail with the Political Resident and other British officials in Sharjah, as well as the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, why the Sheikhs of Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial Coast shaikhdoms of Dubai and Sharjah prefer to use their own commercial agents and local merchants for the procurement of their respective allocations of quota imports of Iraqi dates, rather than as hitherto, the British company Andrew Weir of Basra (appointed Crown purchasing agents in the Middle East). From May 1945 onwards, their official discussions focus on gathering information about the annual requirements for dates in the Persian Gulf shaikhdoms in the current year, as well as the total number and quantity of their current date exports and imports, in preparation for the gradual relaxation of Government of India wartime trade restrictions on the export and import of dates by Bahrain and the other Persian Gulf shaikhdoms under British protection, with Iraq, Saudi Arabia and India.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs and Port Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Andrew Weir Group</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Food, Dried Fruits Division</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Dates (fruit)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Food control</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000cc#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
