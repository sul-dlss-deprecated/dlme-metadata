January j. 1773. • tt and obedient humble Servant, - 1 • V. - EDWARD IVES.'T H E P R E F A C E. HE principal part of the Firfl Book here offered to the Public, and the whole of the Second Book, were tranfcribed from original papers eleven years ago, merely for my own amufement, and for the gratification of my family and friends. Having however been lately prevailed upon to fubmit them to the perufal of two or three Gentlemen, diftinguifhed in the Republic of Letters, they warmly recommended it to me to fend them to the Prefs, giving it as their opinion, that they would not only be entertaining, but ufeful to the world. To them, therefore,, and the partiality of their judgments, it is owing,, that they now make their appear^ ance in public. The ftile of the Second Book, &amp; different from that of the firft, may poffibly afford juft room for criticifm; and I; may be cenfured for not having new-modelled it, and given the whole in a continued hiftorical narration. I once endeavoured to do it, but foon found myfelf unequal to the tafk: I therefore refolved to let the Second Book continue in the fame form as when firft com mitted'to paper. However difagreeable or diffimilar this mixture may be, yet it will be attended' with the following advantage at leaftVI PREFACE. leaf!; the feveral incidents will be fet before the Reader, juft as they flruck the Author's mind, and confequently in a more natural arid eafy manner. JBefides, I was apprehenlive, that to have cur tailed, or enlarged on, my original fentiments, would have given reafon to fufped the fidelity of the whole. Should it be obje&lt;fied, that I have treated too minutely of myfelf and my own concerns; l i have only to anfwer, that the man who writes his own journey, is under a neceffity in fome degree of making himfelf the hero of his own tale. But however trivial many of the incidents relating to myfelf, may now appear, at the time they happened they were felt by me with 'the moft exquifite fenfibility ; and therefore hope the infertion of them will be either overlooked or pardoned by the candid Reader. It becomes me to own alfo, that to enrich the FirA Book, I have made free with fome of the Obfervations made on the Eqft Indians, and on the Animal and Vegetable ProdudlTohs of their Country, by my two late valuable and ingenious friends, the Rev. Mr. Cobbe and Mr. George Thomas, whofe papers fell into my hands foon after their deceafe. However, though fenfible of the obligation I lie under, in having thofe Gentlemen's remarks thus fortunately blended with my own, I fhall think myfelf fufficiently happy, if even by fome borrowed riches and beauties, I have been able to produce a work not altogether unworthy of the attention of the Public. The general Map of the courfe of the River Euphrates, and of our route through Afiatic-Turky, which is inferted in the Second Book, muft certainly prove very acceptable to the Reader, as it conveys an increafe of knowledge in the geography of a country which hitherto has been but little known, and as the truth and accuracy thereof may be entirely depended upon, being done by the late ingenious Mr. Doidge, from his own, and the joint obferva tions of Captain James Alms of the Royal Navy. 7 ' The[ viii ] CONTENTS, BOOK L Chap .

IMmediately after the peace of Aix la Chapelle, or as foon as our fea and land forces under the command of Admiral Bofcawen had left the Indies and were on their return to England-, Monf. Dupleix, governor of Pondi- cherry, began by his intrigues to fow the feeds of diflention among the country princes-, and when he had fo far fucceeded as to fet them at variance with one anotner, he fent a body of European troops into the field, as auxili- aries to thole habohs who efpoufed the French intereft ; and who, by dint of this lupply, gained feverai luccelfive advantages over the other princes who were friends to our Eaft India company. M ustapha- J ing , a powerful prince, and C hunda- S aeb , an enterprifing general, were thofe with whom lie was principally conneded, and whom he made ufe of as inftruments for bringing about his ambitious defigns. Defigns no lefs extenfive, than of acquiring1 r ^ ] 1 749 acquiring for his nation an abfolute afcendency over the whole Carnatic and to Deccan, and forhimfelf, immortal honour and immenfe riches. The Englijh 1 753- prefidency were pofleffed of fuch convincing proofs of his infatiabie avarice, 1 and thirft for power-, that they prudently and refolutely determined to exert their utmoft abilities in putting a ftop to his violent, and hitherto rapid proceedings : for that purpofe, they, under the character of allies, joined their forces with the armies of a prince called Nazir-Jinc, and of the Nabob of Jrcot named Mahomed-Aly •, againft whom their enemies were now taking the field. Thus the Englijb and French companies, though they could not act as open and declared enemies, becaufe of the peace which fubfifted between their refpedive fovereigns; yet under the afiumed name of auxiliaries, they for feveral years carried on an expenfive and bloody war againft each other. And, although the Britijh arms never gained greater glory, than in fome of the battles which were fought on this occafion, particularly in thofe, where Major Lawrence and Mr. Clive commanded i yet, as the French had a far fu- perior number of European troops, and had been fo artful as to form con- nedions with the moft powerful princes of the country ; with thele ad« vantages, they made fo confiderable a progrefs, as greatly to alarm the whole of the Englijh fettlements, and to fill them with apprehenfions, left the day might come, when Monf. Dupleix's ambition might be gratified in its utmoft extent. The governor and council of thofe fettlements therefore fent repeated accounts of their difagreeable fituation, to the direftors of the Englijh Eaji India company, who petitioned government in their behalf; and at length a fmall fquadron of the king's ihips, under the command o{ Charles ft atfon^ Efq; Rear-Admiral of the Blue, and a regiment of infantry under that of Colonel Adlercronj were granted for their relief. 1754. On the 22d day of Feiruary 1754, the which Ihip I had been ' appointed lurgeon} failed from Spithead to Plymouth^ the place of rendez vous for the fquadron; and on the 9th of March, Admiralput to fea, with the following ftups for the Eajt Indies. ■ Kent (with the admiral's flag) Capt.

On the 19th in the afternoon, the wind blew very hard from the fouth eaft, accompanied with fleet and hail, and a very high fea poured into the bay, which occafioned the Eagle to part her fmall bower cable, and to drive a-thwart the Briftol's hawfe. The officers of the Eagle fo exerted them- felves, that they foon cleared her from the Brijlol, but not without the lofs of this laft (hip's head and bowfprit. At night, both (hips parted from their anchors, and drove very near the Ihore; their malts were cut away, and fignals of diftrefs were made j but unfortunately the fea ran fo high, that no boats could lye along fide of them, and confequently no effeftual relief could be fent to their affiftance. The wind and fea abating in the morn ing, gave the admiral an opportunity of getting off both the (hips, by his fending all the boats of the Iquadron to aflift them; but they were fo much difabled, as not to be capable of proceeding on their intended expedition. Mr. IVatfon, being by this accident deprived of fo confiderable a part of the force of his fquadron, for fome time debated with himfelf, whether he fhould immediately purfue his voyage with thofe few fhips which were (till fit for fea, or wait where he was, till the difabled fhips could be replaced. His zeal for the fervice however determined him to embrace the former alter native, and he difpatched two exprefles, one to the Secretary of the Lords Commiflioners of the Admiralty, and another to Colonel Adlercron: he acquainted the colonel with his determination of proceeding with the Ktnt^ Salijhury, Bridgewater, and Kingsfijher only ; and defired him, that the divifion of his regiment which was intended for thofe fliips, might embark with all poffible expedition ; and that the other divifion, might be put on board the two fliips which were difabled, and proceed in them to Plymouth^ where he did not doubt but other fhips would be foon ready to receive them, and follow him to India. The remainder of the regiment was to embark in fome of the Eajl India company's (hips, which of courfe would not fail to follow the admiral •, but as they were not ready at the time he failed from England^ he had received orders not to wait for them. On the 24th, fome of the troops were put on board; and the fame day, the admiral with his two (hips, frigate and (loop, weighed anchor, and failed ♦, leaving the two difabled (hips behind him, and appointing the Gar- landy Captain Spry^ to convoy them to Plymouth.—April the 6th, we anchored in Fonchial road, off the ifland of Madeira, a place famous for fupplying not only Europe, but all our fettlements in both the Indies, with a mod excellent wine. This refreftiing liquor however, like other things, of late years is greatly increafed in its price. Ten or twelve years before, the beft wine on the ifland was fold from 12 to 14 pounds the pipe-, but at the time we were there, none could be got for lefs than 20 and 22 pounds. B 2 This[ 4 ] 1754- T^ 1 ' 5 ^ ancJ Madehv is fubjed to the crown of Portugal-, fituated in a fine climate, in the latitude of 32 0 27' north. The face of the country is very mountainous, interfperfed with vineyards, which form a mod ro mantic and delightful profped. The tops of the higheft of thefe moun tains are always covered with fnow, fome of the gentlemen of our fquadron ventured to fcale one of them, but found the air round the fummit of it fo exceedingly cold, that they were glad to get down again as faft as poffible. We have a conful always refiding here, and feveral confiderabie merchants of our nation live at Fonchial, which is the only place of trade in the whole ifland. Whilft we continued at Madeira, we met with many difagreeable delays in fupplying our fquadron with wine and other refrefliments, on account of the Paflion-week, and the carnival that followed it ; at which feafon all bufinefs there is at a ftand, and ftrangers are fure to be entertained with much gaudy, fuperftitious mummery. The cuftom indeed of celebrating this feftival with a great deal of religious pageantry, is obferved in all Popifh countries, but probably no where carried to fo great an height as among the Portuguefe, who are the moft bigotted to the fopperies of their religion of any nation under the fun- On the rpth of April, at 10 o'clock in the morning, we took our leave of Madeira, and on the 23d faw the ifland of Palma, one of the Canaries, dis tant from us four leagues. By the 25th, we were got into the trade winds; and in a day or two afterwards were in fight of B&amp;navifta, one of the Cape deVerd iflands. About the middle of May, our fhip being too much crowded with ftores and men,, and confequently very hot between decks; the crew became fo fickly, that in fix days we buried feven men, and had 160 on the fick 1HI, chiefly with putrid fevers. On the gd of June, at the very hour Capt. had calculated, we difcovered the ifland Trinidada ; and the next morning Martinvas was in fight. The latter is compofed of inacceflibl® rocks; but the former, as I was informed, is well covered with woods, and has a. fandy bay at the north-eaft end, where there is plenty of. frefh water. In our whole run from Madeira to thefe laft mentioned iflands, we faw nothing very remarkable; or only fuch objefts as are always to be met with in thofe feas: fuch, as great flights of different forts of birds, near the land; and vaft numbers of flying fifh. We caught alfo fome fliarks in calm weather; to fome of which were fticking feveral black fifh from eight inches to a foot long: the failors ; called them the fucking-fifh, but they are really the Remora^ Some time in June the crews of the feveral fhins of the fquadron, with baited hooks, caught fome Pint ado ; they are about the bignefs of a pidgeon, and whe.n fwimming on the water, 'very much refemble that bird. They are prettily mottled on the back and wines, l^fhl t are , of , a da ^ k blu e colour, their bills are fharp and ftrong, their tegs black, and their feet webbed. When caught, they cannot rife to fly from[ 5 ] from the deck, but will moft readily do fo, out of a tub of water. An 1754. albatrofe^ a fea-fowl, was fhot off the Cafe of Gocd Hope&gt; which meafured v — 174 f ee,: from wing to wing. A was alio caught, and brought on board the Cumberland^ with 72 young ones in her belly, each from 6 to 14. inches long. Another was afterwards caught by the Salijhury\ crew, which had the horns, fkin, and many bones of a bullock in the belly. After it was dead and dried, a very large man pafied through its jaws. In the unfettled and hot weather we had, during our continuance near the line, the putrid fever raged among us •, (owing in a great degree alfo to the ftock-fifh, which we had taken on board as part of our provifion, turning putrid.*) Our people, when firft taken, complained of violent head aches, pain in their limbs, and an univerfal reftlefihefs. By the latter end of June, we had advanced far to the fouthward, and confequently were in a colder climate. On the 17th oi July, at three in the morning, we difcovered the long wifned-for ifland of Madagafcar, At four made the iignal, wore Ihip, and brought to •, and on die 1.8th we anchored in St. Auguftine's bay, at the fouthern part of the ifland, latitude 23 0 42' fouth, in 16 fathom water. The 19th, we received on board frelh beef for the ufe of the feveral fhips companies, who with eagernefs and tranfport fed on this delicious fare. The next day, the admiral was fo kind as to ifiue his warrant, by which I was appointed to take under my care the fick and wounded of the whole fquadron- The firft care after our arrival at Madagafcar, was to get our fick afhore. Thofe in the Kent alone amounted to 150: The complaints of fome, were the fame putrid fevers which had before given us fo much trouble while in the neighbourhood of the equinoctial; but the greater part were now af~ Aided with the fcurvy, and to fo great a degree, that they had not ftrength enough to crawl upon the deck, and fcarcely to breathe; we were obliged therefore to carry them out of the fhip in their hammocks : but fo falutar^ was the land, and the refrefhments it produced, that in lefs than three weeks after they were put alhore, almoft all of them happily recovered their former health and vigour. This illand, which lies between 12 and 26* fouth latitude, is of great ex tent, and very fruitful, abounding in moft of the neceflaries of life. It is governed by four or five kings, who frequently are at war with each other,- when they make inroads into the enemies country, and carry off both families and cattle : the firft are fometimes fold to the Europeans, as flaves. The bullocks on this ifland are very large and fat, weighing ufually from 6 to 700 pounds each, and are much valued by the feveral European na' •' Two thirds of the ftock -fifh which government fupplied the Ihip with, we were obliged to throw over board,. tions[ 6 ] j 1 ca tions who have fettlements in Mia. They fend {hips hither on purpofe for t^em, which they kill and fait upon the iHand. Thefe bullocks have all a remarkable protuberance, or portion of fat, feated between the two fhoulders, weighing about twenty pounds which in general is very much efteemed, after having lain fome time in fait. For my own part however, I could not join in the extravagant praifes given to this piece in particular, nor indeed to any of the beef of this ifland ; for though the oxen are very large, fat and fair to look upon, yet the herbage they eat, gives their flefh a peculiar,- and to me a very difagreeable tafte. The natives have a very dexterous method of bringing the ox to the (laughter. They throw a rope, with a running knot, over the horns of that particular beaft, which the purchafer hath chofen out of a great number, and with the fame rope drag the vidim to a tree; around the trunk of which, they take a turn with the rope, and draw the ox dole up to it, where it is eafily flaughtered by the butcher. The iflanders themfelves never (trip off the hide, but feed on that with as much pleafure as on any other part of the beaft. The (heep of Madagafcar differ very little from the goats, being alike hairy, only their heads are fomewhat larger. They have necks like a calf, and a tail that weighs at leaft ten pounds. We had no fooner come to an anchor at this iQand, but old Robin Hood, and another of the king of Baba's people, whom they call purfers j Philibey, the General i and Captains John Anderfon and Frederick Martin, came on board the Kent: thefe were fome of the chiefs of the king's court, who prided themfelves in being called by Englijh names. And the king's own family likewife, in imitation of the court of England, is not without a Prince of Wales, a Duke of Cumberland, a Prince Augujtus, and Pnncefles, diftinguifhed by Englijh names. All the great men abovementioned, came on board naked, except a covering over their hips, and another over their fhoulders, made of a cer tain grafs growing on the ifland, which they had ornamented with fmall glafs beads, by way of border or fringe. Their hair was not altogether (b wool ly as is the Africans on the coaft of Guinea, but rather refembling the long black hair of the Indian • The Madagafcarian wives take great pains with their hufbands hair: They fometimes put it in large and regular curls, and at other times braid it in great order, making it to fhine with a par ticular oil which the ifland produces. The men are rather tall than other- wife, and (lightly made, yet ftrong •, they always carry in their hands a wooden lance, headed with iron. This lance is in general made very neat, which forty yards with great exaanefs, ftriking the fmalleft mnfu#- i!- uV ,n !P lem !, nt of war . they are commonly mafters of a tauflcet, which they get from Europeans in exchange for cattle ; and this they hi irT r n ' Ceft order — 1 am fcrry to fay, that the Eng. ^ ,7 grea J t lnl P oritlons in this kind of traffic, by dif- g of chea P and ''-tempered gun-barrels, among the poor inhabitants. 5 who[ 7 ] who fometimes lofe their lives by the burfting of thefe pieces. Such 1^54- iniquitous pradices as thefe, muft in the end prove injurious to the nation ^ ^ and has indeed already made the name of more than one of thefe traders truly infamous among the deluded, but hitherto friendly, Madagafcarians* or Malgaches *. They are a civil, good-natured people, but eafily provoked, and apt to (hew their refentment on the leaft provocation, efpecially where they think themfelves injured, or (lighted. An inftance of this happened during our ftay amono- them. A wife of John Anderfon came to our tents, and purchafed a clafp-kntfe of a common failor-, in her return home fhe had the misfortune to drop it; as foon as (he difcovered her lofs, Ihe ran back in the greateft anxiety towards our people •, in her way, fhe obferved a feaman to ftoop, and take up fomething from the ground, which on her getting up with him, flie difcovered to be her knife, and demanded it as her property. The iailor refufino- to part with it, fhe hurried home, and acquainted her hufband with what had happened. Immediately, and in the greateft rage, he commanded his fervants and flaves to arm themfelves, and at the head of them he marched into our camp. Lieutenant Carnac of AdlercrorCs regiment, and our other officers on fhore, were at dinner in their tent; and upon hearing a great uproar, they ran out and difcovered John Anderfon with fifteen other natives, armed with loaded mufkets, and in violent altercation with our people.' It is impoffible to defcribe the fury which was vifible in Anderfon'% countenance. The officers being upon the bed footing with him, went to u - } 1 i mj a nd defired to know the caufe of this unbecoming behaviour. He gave 3t without i a anfwer, and in a very peremptory tone demanded the knife, d Princellb, They, in return, calmly reafoned with him, W afked him how he could think'of behaving in fo outrageous a manner to his friends. He anfwered, ' they were no friends of his, unlefs they did him jujtice' They flill went on foothing him, but at the fame time gave him to underftand, that his afting in this frantic manner was not only ridiculous, but dangerous to a great decree i for had they been as violent as himfelf, it was next to an impofli- biltty that either he or any one of his followers could have returned back alive. He replied, ' that he would fooner die, than tamely put up an injury' At laft, with great difficulty, they appeafed him, prevailed upon him to fend back his people, and to enter their tent. Here they gave him a dram, and fummoned before them the failor. The fellow frankly acknowledged that he had found a knife, and that it was very poffible it might belong to Anderfon\ wife, but that as yet he had only her word for it. The woman, in anfwer to this, produced the perfon from whom fhe bought it, who prov- ing it to be her property, the knife was prefently reftored, and the affair amicably fettled to the entire fatisfadion of all parties. Another charafteriftic of the Madagafcarians, is, the very high notions they eatertain of the dignity of their king j which they carry to io great an * A general term applied to the inhabitants of that iiland, _ height.r s ] 1754. height, that they are never more fenfibly hurt, than when they think you 1 are treating him with any kind of incivility. We met with a moft ftriking inftance of this, foon after our arrival at the ifland, when the king's purfers made Admiral Watfon their firft vifit. At the time thefe people entered the fhip, it happened that the admiral was deeply engaged in bufinefs ; he there fore defired Captain Speke, (who had been at Madagafcar before, and con- fequently was acquainted with moft of them) to officiate as his deputy, and entertain them in the ward-room, till he could wait upon them in perfon. This talk. Captain Speke executed with the greateft hofpitality and politenefs- but notwithftanding all his endeavours to pleafe, in lefs than twenty minutes they became quite impatient, and very ferious ; talked much of going afhore again, and ot their king's dignity being greatly hurt by this delay, 0 ' who (they laid) was a great man, and would be much difpleafed, when he Jhculd be told they had waited fo long before they had been admitied to an audience of the commodore ' for fo they called the admiral not only at his firft arrival, but ever afterwards, it being a title they had been much accuftomed to • nor had they before been ever vifited by an officer of Mr. JVatfon's rank. Captain Speke, touched with their complaints, hurried away to the admiral who immediately admitted them into his cabin, and made them happy' Before they took their leave however, they in very plain terms gave Mr.' H atfon to underftand, that unlefs he made the King of Baia the firft vifit no provifion of confequence would be fuffered to be put on board his fhips.

On the right hand as you enter the bay, lives one Prince William \ he is related, and tributary, to the king, yet in moft cafes afls as an indepen- dant prince-, and is always fure to ufe his utmoft endeavours with the officers of the fhips that touch there, to pitch their tents on his fide of the country, and to buy their provifions of him, inftead of the king or his fubjeds. In this prince's territories, not far diftant from the fea, are the remains of a fort, built by Avery the pirate. His majefty oiBaha refides in a town built with mud, which ftands up the country, about twelve miles from St. Augufiine\ Bay. About four days after our arrival, he came down with his family into our neighbourhood, and fent his heir apparent on board, accompanied by the duke of Bah a, and other great perfonages of his court, to congratulate the admiral on his arrival at Madagafcar, and to know on what day he intended paying him a vifit. The admiral made each of thefe ambafladors a prefent of a pair of piftols, a gun, a fword, and fome bottles of brandy; appointed a day for paying his re- fpefts to the king, and fent them all afhore in the higheft fpirits, and per- fe6Uy happy. On the day which had been fixed for his public audience, the admiral, attended by all the captains, and other officers of his fquadron, walked about half a mile from our own tents down to thofe of his majefty, and was ufhered into the largeft of them by the beat of two drums, whicii by the particular defire of Robin Hood had been fent from on board the Kent; this prime minifter declaring, that as the admiral was a great man, and the king of Baba a great man alfo, the admiral fhould bring his mufic to do honour to the king; and the king's mufic in return (which confifted only of two pair of great conch-fhells) fhould found in honour of the admiral. As nobody objeded to this reafonable propofal, the admiral was received in the manner prefcribed by Robin Hood. The king was about fixty years of age, very corpulent, and had at that time a violent fit of the gout. He was fitting on a grafs-mat fpread on the ground, with a wrapper round his middle, and on his head he wore a Dutch grenadier's cap, a foot and a half high, faced with the arms of the Butch Eaft India company cut in brafs. He took the admiral by the hand, and- enquired how King George did: wflen he was told that he was now in health, but had lately been in great afflidtion on account of the death of his eldeft fon •, he feelingly replied, ' Ay, I have likewife loft my Prince of Wales' He then enquired of the admiral, what prefents he had for him. Thefe, confifting of fire-arms, fwords and fpirituous liquors, were immedi ately given •, but none feemed to pleafe him fo much as the brandy, he only found fault that there was not enough of it. His three queens, and many other C ladiesc 10 ] i75i- V p' 1 ' ladies of the court, attended this meeting. They too had their prefertts. And the admiral, to treat them, as he thought, the more gemeely, ordered three or four dozen of bottles of white wine to be brought j but upon their tafting it, they fpoke of it as infipid, and, like the king, preferred brandy as the bettet liquor. Mr. TVatfon apologized for his not having a greater ftock of it-, but affured them, and his majefty of Baba alfo, that the next time he made this voyage, he would not fail to bring them a much larger quantity. Before the audience broke up, the king afked the admiral, whether he had any docftor with him ? who replied, yes. He then afked, 'Is he a great do51 or? A king's d&amp;tiorf' to which the admiral replied in the affirmative. ' Let him, (rejoined the king) give me fome mahomets (that is, fome medicines) for my fick knee.' The admiral then fpoke to me, who ftood near him; when ad- drefllhg myfelf to the king, I gave him my word, that he fhouldnot be many days without them. The admiral having mentioned to the king of Baba, the provifions he wanted for his fquadron, the latter gave orders to his purfers,. that we fhould immediately be fupplied with them: Then the admiral, after thanking the king for his civility and afliftance, took his leave. Before I clofe this fcene, I cannot omit defcribing the grotefque drefs and figure of one of the favourites at this court, \Vho in his younger days had been in England, where he acquired a tafte for the European fafhions. They called him Captain Torn Uill\ he was a little old man, had neither Ihoes, flockings, breeches, nor fhirt on, but wore a wrapper round his thighs, and an old filk-waiftcoat next his fkin, ornamented with a bugle-fringe: An old tattered blue coat, an old grey tye-wig, a filver-laced hat, and a fword with out a fcabbard, made up the remainder of his drefs, and all together pre- fented a moft ridiculous figure. . The generality of my readers, will probably look down with wonder and pity, if not with contempt, on the rude fimplicity and unpolilhed man ners of the people now delcribed: But let them turn back to the annals of our Englijh hiftory not two thoufand years agOj they will have the mortifi cation to find the ancient Britons equally unacquainted with the polite arts, and quite as barbarous and uncivilized as the prefent Madagafcarians *. And it our njde forefathers, by a perfevering virtue, a noble difintereftednefs, and a paifionate love for their country, could ere6t a kingdom, fo capable of ex citing admiration as we have now the happinefs to boaft of; why fhould not the defcendants of the brave Madagafcarians, at fome future period, emu- ate t le g ory o our anceftors, and lay the foundations of an empire oreat and extenfive as our own, and as much celebrated for the glory of its arms, .it' ''omn.T ^ &amp; vivunt, pellibuCque fun, vef- korribiliore fune in miona ln f' 1 '' ? u ° (i 'crulcum efficit colorem; atque hoc rafa pneter caru- fc lahrnm ( '' C ^P 1 ' 0( 1 U ® ' Uiu promiflb, atque Omni parte corporis &amp; maxim^ Fratres com Fratr^us^Parentefou^ VutrTlIberis n ' Sed imer habentur iibcri, a quibu S primum v^eV^^rfun, qU, ' h ' S naU e0rUn, Crefar. de Bello Gallico, Lib. v. height[ ' ] height of genius, and delicacy of tafte ?—The prefumption is neither ground- 1754« lefs nor extravagant; for the ifland of Madagafcar is very fertile, and near ' a thoufand miles in length, and at its wideft pare, three hundred miles broad, fituated in a healthy climate, full of the fineft timber, and furniflies many other valuable materials fit for fhipping by which her natives might be en abled to equip formidable fleets, extend their commerce over all,the known part of the habitable world, and perhaps carry the terror of their arms into countries hitherto undifcovered. Thefe iflanders, likewife, are not at all de ficient in that active and enterprifing fpirit fo neceffary for perfecting fuch glorious undertakings. Whilft we continued on this ifland, we found ourfelves frequently robb ed of our linnen, as it was hanging out to dry; yet it was always Jftolen in fo artful and dexterous a manner that we never had it in our power to de tect one fingle culprit during the whole time of our being there. One poor wretch indeed, who was concerned in this kind of theft, making his efcape with his booty over the river, unfortunately ftuck in the mud, and was drowned. The following inftance will fhew the great prefence of mind, and exceeding dexterity of thefe iflanders, in thievifli exploits. One evening, as thirty or forty of our men were fitting round a fire, boiling their vic tuals in their iron-pots, without the leaft fufpicion of a thief's being near them-, a Madagafcarian with wonderful agility jumped over their heads into the circle, took one of the pots by die handle as it flood over the fire, and ran off' with it towards the river: Our people, for a time continued looking on each other with amazement; but before any of them had fo far recovered themfelves as to think of purfuing the thief, the fellow had made fuch good ufe of his legs, as to be quite out of their reach. Among the great variety of women, that daily reforted to our tents, I obferved one, who, as to her make and fymmetry of features, was a perfedt beauty. The Dutchefs oi Baha was alfo handfomebut the king's two daughters were far otherwife. The eldefl: of thefe two ladies was extreme ly coarfe in her perfon, and no lefs mafculine in her behaviour. The youngefl; was not quite fo plain or mafculine as her lifter, tho' (he had not much delicacy to boaft of: they were both unmarried. One of them had compleated her fortieth year; the other was not quite fo old. They were of the company at court, when the admiral vifited their father; and foou afterwards, the eldeft; of thefe princefles condefcended fo far as to call upon the agent-vidualler at his tent: She carried a heavy mufket on her fhoulder, of which ihe appeared to be extremely fond, talked with great pleafure of the execution fhe had done with it in times pafl; but as the lock of it was nowfpoiled, Ihe defired the favour of him to get it put in proper repair for her; and added at the fame time, that (he ftiould be much obliged to him for his kindnefs. In jfhort, our agent-viftualler caufed her mufket to be repaired, and feemed to ftand very high in her good graces. But not many C 2 days[ '2 1 I 754- days pafled, before he unfortunately fell into difgrace, and too fenfibly ex- J perienced the efFe.(5ts of her refentment. It happened thus. The admiral had thought it neceflary to give the chief men of the ifland an entertainment on board his own (hip; and at the time appointed for their coming, he fent his barge to convey them to the Kent, giving orders, that none but men fhould be admitted. The king's eldeft daughter, notwithftand- ing this injundlion, was determined to make one of the company, and for that purpofe repaired with the men to the water's edge. The agent-vidlualler had before told her, and now again reprefented to her the very great impro priety of a lady of her quality going on board the fhip; and did not neg- le6l to add, that as the admiral's commands were abfolute, he could not poffibly allow her to go: All his rem on ft ranees availed nothing; for no fooner had the barge reached the fhore, and the ftool was put upon the beach but flie got upon it, and was advancing: The agent-vidualler then took hold of her arm, and again remonftrated, intreating her to defift from her purpofe ; nay he offered to make her a prefent, provided fhe would peace ably retire. But ail his pleading was to noeffed; itfeemed, that fhe had be fore determined what part to ad: He then in pofitive terms declared, that fhe fhould not go, and with fome difficulty pulled her from the ftool to the fhore. On this, fhe not only greatly abufed him with her tongue, but alio gave him fo violent a blow on one of his eyes with her fifl, that he de clared it to have been the fevereft he ever felt in his life. At lafl, however' he got the better in his troublefome difpute with this royal virago; who re' turned home in fuch ill humour, that fhe was never afterwards 0 thorouahlv TerTavou/ 0 ^ agent ' viaualler&gt; tho ' he took fome P ains be re-inflated in The younger of thefe princefles (as before obferved) had alfo accompanied .he king at the grand audience; and at that time was pleafed to take fo. r c j ^ ar ' Cy t0 , ^ P 6 n of one of the admiral's attendants that ihe .igmfied her good hking the fame evening, in a prefent fhe fent him of two.

The next day, the fame mefTenger took the gentleman afide and told him, that the youngeft prineefs was in love with him- i-Kar iV a he would come to her cabin at a certain hour of the night • and thar he W would accompany him, to (hew him where the cabin ftood ~ The iTlf man anfwered v that he could not poffibly go for at that rime a ^ T ^ for the whole night, he fhould be particular^ en^Ad ThlTf and for three or four days afterwards tf e fame amh fT A follow?n g tunate that due attention fhould be naid m tK ambairador was very impor- and expatiated very largely on the oreat hn ^ n COnc )f lcenrion u of the P ri ncefs^ the preference which was given hin^bv a ^ 0ne ) to the g en t^man in ..to fafed himfclifnot mfe„r.ble g,', excufes.[ i3 1 cxcufes availed nothing, and being entirely at a lofs to frame new ones, he plainly told Robin Hood, that he need not give himfelf the trouble ot coming any more for to fpeak the truth, he was a married man, and therefore could not accept of the princefs's favours, without being guilty of a breach of that folernn vow which he had made and ratified at the altar. He then repeated feveral religious maxims which he had before talked over with Robin Hood, and ftrengthened the force of thole maxims by a prefent of a piece of filver, and two handkerchiefs not doubting but that by this well- timed bribe, he fhould prevail upon him to become his advocate, and re concile the princefs to her difappointment. — Robin Hood, tho' he took the prefent, faid very coldly, ' that if it lay in his power, he would certainly pacify the lady's refentment; but it would be a matter of great difficulty and often infilled on the very important confideration, of her being the daughter of a great king. Several days pafTed after this, before any thing more was faid upon the fubje6t between the meffenger and the gentleman: at length the latter afked the other, if all was right with the princefs, and how fhe had taken his pofitive refufal ? Hood replied, ' I have been your friend, and told her your excufes but flie faid, that fhe did not believe they were the true reafons.' He then mentioned what had been this deli cate princefs's fuggeftions upon the occafion, which cannot be repeated j and added, ' She was very angry, and called you bad names, but I have now, after a great deal of trouble, made her tolerably eafy.' — Thus ended this ft range negotiation!— All the Madagafcarian women, except thofe who are very poor indeed, wear a covering over their breafts and fhoulders, ornamented with glais beads-, and none go without a cloth over their hips. They commonly walk with a flender, long ftick, or rod. The men are allowed to have as many wives as they pleafe, or can fupport. The king has three; the Duke Baba but one; John Anderjon two. Their children, they often name after any Englijh officers, who happen to be there at the time of their wives pregnancy, or delivery. One of John Anderforfs wives was with child, while we were there •, and he affured Sir William Hewet^ that if fhe brought him a boy, he would give the child his name and title. The men often prefent (or, as they term it, falamanca) you with an ox, calf, goat, &amp;c. and in return expert to receive its full value in filver, or fome other commodity. They without fcruple tell you, in their broken jar gon, ' If yoil my friend, I your friend. Ton no my friend, I no your friend. I falamanca you, you falamanca me' Their wives, without reftraint, vilit you in your tents, with or without their hufbands, and make you prefents on the fame footing as do their hufbands. If a wife is furprized by her hufband in the a&lt;5l of adultery, we were told, he never fails to put her and her gallant to death but if they are difcovered by any other perfon, the crime is fome- times compounded by a prefent of cattle, or (laves. Thefe are the chief, if not only riches of the Madagafcarians,. for they have no money •„ and exceptT except thofe who inhabit the Mud they all live either in mat-cab'm&amp;, or huts made with boughs. The grandees have a fence round their cottages, with a court-yard, and diftinft apartments for their different wives and child' ren, as well as for their Haves. During our flay at this ifland, I obferved with great concern feveral miferable obje6ls in the laft ftages of the venereal diieafe. They had not been able to find any cure; and as far as I could learn, their doctorg are to tally ignorant of medicine. The only method they ule for curing all com plaints, as well outward hurts, as inward diieafes, is the wearing on their arm or neck a particular charm or amulet-, or befmearing the part afflidect, with earth moiftened with the juice of fome tree or plant, and made up into a foft pafte. The country, befides large timber-trees of different kinds, abounds alfo with a variety of flirubs, and fucculent plants. The fugar-canes are as thick as a ftout man's wrifl:, and fo full of juice, that a foot of them in length will weigh two pounds, being much larger and finer than any in the Weft Indies. When the Madagafcarians travel, they take a fugar cane on their backs to fubfift upon, which will ferve them two or three days. The tamarind tree grows in great plenty; the leaves of which are like our com mon fern : The tree is about the fize of an Englifh pear-tree, and not much unlike it. The fruit is contained in pods about the fize of thofe of the bean, which, when fit to gather, are brown, hard and brittle. A good beginning for a colledion of curious fhells might be made on the ihore of this ifland-, they are now much more fcarce all over India than here ^ The a baflard kind of coral, is found *r7f h u ^ n ? berides r their abounding with great quantities of excellent filli, are tull of alligators of an enormous fize.

Its tricks are of the monkey kind. Guanas, chamaeleons, ferpents, tarantulas, and a kind of bats, called flying foxes, are found here: their wings from the tip of one, to the extremity of the other, are five or fix feet, and they are a foot and half in breadth. But the moft extraordinary thing on the whole ifland, is the innumerable quantity of locufts it abounds with. Thefe rife from the low lands in thick clouds, which are fometimes extended to an incredible length and dif- tance. The natives eat thefe infects, and even prefer them to their fineft Mi. Their method of drefling them, is, to ftrip off their legs and wings,, and fry them in oil It has been' generally fuppofed, that a mixture of the Mahometan and^ Bagan religion is profeffed in this illand ; but tho' this may be true, yet during our (lay here, we faw no figns of the firft ; the word mahomets indeed is frequently ufed by the natives, under which general term, they include all kinds of medicine, every fort of charm or amulet, and alfo a facrifice and player: hence it feems as if fome account of the religion of Mahomet had reached the ifland in pail ages, from the neighbouring continent; and alfo that it had been favourably received by the natives, though the prefent gene ration appeared to be entirely unacquainted with its principles and rites. I took lome pains to acquaint myfelf with their religious tenets ; and they appear to worfhip one univerfal Father^ whom, when they fpeak in Englijhy they call God^ and in whom, they conceive to refide all kind of perfection. The fun' they look upon as a glorious body, and I believe, as a fpiritual Being, but created and dependent. They frequently look up to it with wonder, if not with praife and adoration. They make their fupplications to the One Almighty, and offer facrifices to him in their diflreifes. I had the curiofity to attend a facrifice at the hut of John Anderfon, whofe father had for a long time been afflidled with ficknefs. At about fun-fet, an ox was brought into the yard, and the fon, who officiated as prieft, flew it -, an altar was reared nigh, and the poft of it was fprinkled with the blood of the vi6lim. The head, after it's being fevered from the body, * This cuftom of eating locufts among the Madagafcarians, will determine that queftion about which learned men have fo long difputed, what fandijohn the Baptijl did eat when he lived in the defert ? Whether the of this holy man were locufts, according to the literal fenfe of the word in all authors, or whether thefe 'Ax.pi/e? were the fruit of fome tree, or a fpecies of birds ? The firft, has been the opinion of all interpreters of the fcriptures, who attended merely to the contents ; others, who were for (hewing their critical and refined genius, have afterted, that John Baptijl never did eat locufts, for they are an unnatural food, never were ufed by any, and not adapted for fullenance. But if locufts are at this day eaten by the natives of Madagafcary as they truly are, and alfo by many befides, why may not the Baptiji have lived on the fame infedl, according to the gofpel hiftory ? and which needs no alteration. 'Ax.pi&lt;rs&lt; wiI4 always remain what they have been, and the greatcft fkill and labour will never change them to birds or fruit. See Hajfdquiji'% Travels. was[ '6 3 I 754' was placed, with the horns on, at the foot of the altar: the cawl was —' burned in the fire, and moft of the pluck and entrails boiled in a pot. The fick man, who was brought to the door, and placed on the ground fo as to face the facrifice, prayed often, and feemingly with great fervency : his eyes were fixed attentively towards the heavens, and his hands held up in a fupplicating pofture. The ceremony ended with the fon's cutting up the ox into fmall pieces, the greatelt part of which he diftributed among the poor flaves belonging to his father and himfelf, referving however fome of the befl; pieces for his own ufe. Upon the whole, I faw fo many circumflances in this Madagafcarian facrifice, fo exadly refembling thofe which are mentioned in the Old Teltament as offered up by the Jews, that I could not turn my thoughts back to the original, without being fenfibly ftruck at the exaftnefs of the copy. It happened fortunately for me, who conftantly refided at the fick tents afliore, that at the requeft of feveral officers of our fquadron, who promifed to accompany me, and intended themfelves much innocent pleafantry in fincr- ing the grand chorus anthem of God fave the king, long live the king, on the occafion, I had delayed giving his majefty of Baba the medicines Hiad pro mifed him; for the very night following that, in which I was to have de livered them, he died fuddenly. Now, tho' his death, by all the accounts we could pick up, was certainly occafioned by a violent fit of the gout in his head, and which probably was brought on by the too free ufe, and inebriat ing, inflammatory quality of the brandy, which he had been prefented with- yet there is no room to doubt, but that his loyal and refentful fubjeds would have imputed his demife to another caufe, and revenged themfelves on me as the poifoner of their king, had he chanced to have taken the fmalleft quantity of my medicines. The chiefs feemed deeply concerned at this fudden and unexpeded event and were very defirous th.t the king's death Ihould be ken? a profound wh l/k lr l u' 18 about u o'clock of the fame evenino- in which he died, they repaired to the Mud Town, carrying with them the corofe rovai e famnv and wer ^ accom P a '^d by the feveral branches of the oneoftheir tent Airr^.T''^ ^ t00k Care to r ' fire every ° 1 , lr t ^ nt L s - Ail the inhabitants in the neighbourhood foon follnweH ileep: butwe hadanother reafon to prevent our takin^anv reDo'f 8et f 0t ' our having oblerved the mnfl- i r ^ epofe, and that was, natives, which r ho ^ ^ ^ dif0rd . er am0n g ft the guard the whole nigh°.

It was a lucky circumflance for us, that our agent-vidualler had, before this event of the king's death, amply furnifhed all the (hips of the fquadron with frefh provifions; for as after that event all kind of bufinefs was at a ftand, we confequently fhould elfe have been under a neceflity of going to Johanna or fome other port to have taken in the remainder of our fupplies. It may be of ufe to future navigators to be informed, that no good water is to be had at St. Augujiine, unlefs they fend their boat four or five miles up the river ; and inftead of filling their calks at low water (as is the cafe in moft other rivers) they muft begin to fill here at about a quarter's flood. The reafon afllgned for it, is, that the river has a communication with the fea at other places, as well as with this channel of St. Auguftinfs Bay; and by experience it has been found, that the fea water brought into the river by the flood tide, is not difcharged till a quarter's flood of the next tide in St. Auguftines Bay, and for three miles at leaft up the river, the water is always very brackifh, if not quite fait. I cannot finifli my obfervations on this ifland, without hinting, that fuch quantities of limes and oranges grow here, the largeft calks may be eafily filled with their juices, and that at a very fmall expence, as they may be purchafed with iron-pots, muikets, powder, ball, flints, &amp;:c. &amp;c. It is fuf- ficiently evident, that a fmall quantity of thefe juices mixed daily with the feamen's common drink, would in great meafure prevent their falling into the fcurvy; adifeafe fo frequently attending all long voyages, and which by fad experience has been known to have deprived the nation of many more valuable men, than hath all the power of the enemy. It is, therefore, an objed highly worthy the attention of government, that every fhip of war, which ihall happen to touch at this ifland, be provided with the juices of the lime and orange at the public expence; with the addition of fuch a quantity of rum, or other fpirits, as Ihall be neceflary to preferve the juice from cor ruption. During our flay here, I procured and preferved about half a hogf- head full, which proved, as will be feen hereafter, of eflential fervice to the Kent\ crew againft the fcurvy, both before and after the fquadron got into the Ganges. ^ As the accounts hitherto given of this part of Madagascar, its produdions, &amp;c. by all former writers, have been very fuperficial and imperfedl, 1 prefume the fupplying this deficiency, will at leait merit the indulgence of the reader.

Dupleix in his authority, moderated the high terms he had before in- ed on with our countrymen, and quickly agreed with Mr. Saunders, (the company's governor at Fort St. George} that a fufpenfion of arms between the company and their refpeaive allies, fhould take place, commencing on the 1 ith ot Vttober, and to continue until the nth of January following: fo that, to our great furprize, inftead of being employed on the objeds of war, we had nothing to do but look about us i afid partake of that variety of amufe- ments, which Grangers muft ever find in a country fo diftant, and fo differ ent rrora their own. rifinrtrn,',?/^ iS f ^ ^ ib ' 0 ^ ^ fortification, built on a Mu 8 Thk'l/ft h a m n fr0m thc B'^k-Town, which is called Ci- baftions bi rilmnl a W r ' nnin g r o'nd it, with the addition of a few to defend In irrirf T' 0r al i tl,e En 8 lilh troo P 3 on che P ro P&lt; :ri )' fori rj i! le greatcd part ot' the native Indian inhabitants of the fca fide r^ / f eS - ^ the t0wn ' and the fo '&gt; 'e fituated near ^his fetdemin^s bfnrf y ' nS alm0ft dt,e r0l,th from the fo '- The c «ent of three along the lea fide • Thl' f towarcls . tlle 'and, about four miles, and brmer are pointed out by a thick hedge of the al.ee[ '9 J aloe plant, and cocoa-nut tree, having baftions of fix or eight guns, at about i 754. three-fourths of a mile from each other. In one of thefe little forts, deputy v— 1 Governor Starke had fitted up a pleafant apartment, and to which he fre quently retired from Fort St. David. The country within the boundaries is very pleafant, and the air fine, hav ing feldom any fogs. In the diftrid are many neat houfes with gardens*, the latter were laid out with much good tafte by the gentlemen, who either had been, or were in the company's fervice. Thefe gardens produce fruits of different forts, fuch as pine-apples, oranges, limes, pomegranates, plan- taines, bananoes, mangoes, guavas, (red and white,) bedams (a fort of al mond) pimple-nofes, called in the Weft Indies, chadocks, a very fine large fruit of the citron-kind, but of four or five times it's fize, and many others. At the end of each gentleman's garden, there is generally a fhady grove of cocoa-nut trees. Thefe gardens yield alfo many of the European kitchen plants, the feeds of which are either fent from England, or from the Cape of Good Hope j as celery, lettuce, onions, pariley, mint, artichokes, and fpinagc. They have alfo a common plant of the country, not unlike fpinage, which grows without any culture, and by our feamen is called Cul~ lake. Radiihes are to be had in great plenty; they are large, and of a white colour •, when boiled, their relifh is better than an indifferent turnip. Colliflowers and cabbages alfo grow here, but not in any plenty. Grapes are very fcarce indeed they never flourifh in any of thofe hot countries that lie within 25, or even 30 degrees of the equinodial. Probably we had never known that they grew in Egypt, but for the following lines in Virgil and Horace. 44 Sunt Hhafi# vites, funt et Mareotides alh#' Georg. lib. ii. ' Mentemque lymph at am Mareotico ' Redegit in veros timores ' Ctejar.' Lib. i. ode 37. I met with two very curious animals here at Fort St. David. ^ The firft was a Chameleon, which is faid to live upon air; probably this notion took its rife, from their remarkable fwelling and contracting their bodies in the office of refpiration. The Chameleon which I had in my poffefTion, was a very fine one, and along the back ran a rough ridge like fo many beads, fhining very bright. I frequently put it upon white paper, but could never obferve that it altered to that colour. I fometimes kept my eyes ftedfaftly fixed upon it for half an hour, but never perceived the leaft alteration in colour, unlefs I waved my hand over its back, or offered to touch it. T. he creature always appeared moft. beautiful when frightened. Whenever \ peeped into the balket where it was kept, it was of one colour, a faint, yel- lowifh green, with a mixture of meal, as if a little flour had been thrown over it after I had flood half a minute, a few dufky fpots on the fides, and ftripes acrofs the back, would be fure to appear: when touched, it would hifs, which dilated the body to a prodigious fize; the mealinefs D 2 tlienf 2° ] then went off, and the whole body appeared of a bright yellow; alfo the ftripes on its back, and the fpots on the iides and belly, turned quite black: fo that if you looked upon it one way, on the back, it had the appearance of a perch or a pilot-fifh ; if you took a fide view, the fpots refembled thofe of a cowry-fhell *. The focket of the eye was remarkably large, in which it turned and rolled about the ball with great quicknefs, but the creature had the fmalleft fight or pupil 1 ever beheld ; on its head was a kind of crown, not unlike that of an old hen ox galena bird ; the mouth was ugly and remarkably large. The Chameleon had a furprizing pouch (gulafaccata) under its throat- 1 put feveral flies and grafhoppers into the bafket, but it refufcd to eat, till I forced them into its mouth, and then it chewed and fwallowed very regu larly. It is an oviparous creature, feldom leaving off till it has laid forty or fifty eggs-, and in this refped as well as in the fimilarity of its fhane ir refembles the Crocodile. 5 The other remarkable animal which I met with at Cuddalore, was the am- mated Stalk, of which there are different kinds. Some appear lil-e dry ftraws tied together; others like grafs. Some have bodies much thicker than others, with the addition ot two fcaly imperfeft wings; their neck is no bigger than a pin, but twice as long as their bodies. Their heads are like an hare's, and their eyes are vertical and very brifk. They live upon flics which they catch very dexteroufly with the two fore feet, which they keeo' doubled up in three parts clofe to their head, and dart out very quick on the approach of their prey; and when they have caught it, they eat very voraci- oully, holding it in the fame manner as a fquirrel does its food On the outer joints ot the fore feet are feveral hooks, very fharp for the eafier catch ing and holding their prey, with the other feet, which are four in number lieTw.ir f TU CS thin g' the better to furprize whatever ^ ie in wait for. 1 hey drink like a horfe, putting their mouths into the water. are very white, arealmoft as large as the body of the animal, and (as the natives lay) dangerous-to the eyes.

At fome little diftance from one of thefe walks, is a building, belonging to the company, and defigned for the governor, called ' the garden-houfe.' It is roomy, handfome and well built; and has a very good and large garden belonging to it, with long and pleafant avenues of trees in the back and front. At the time we were at Fort St. David, the governor, and a few other gentlemen of the fettlement, kept a chaife and a pair of horfes; fome drove a two wheel chaife with a fingle horfe, and others were content to take the air on horieback. Since that time however, the number of carriages is greatly in- creafed. Almoft all the Europeans refident in India keep their Palanquin, which is a covered machine with cufhions in it, arched in the middle, to give more room, and air, and is carried on the fhoulders of four or fix men ; the expence attending it, is not lefs than thirty pounds fterling a year. This piece of Eaftern luxury therefore has been forbidden by the company to their youngeft lervants. Some years before our arrival in the country, they found fuch fumptuary laws fo abfolutely neceflary, that they gave the ft rid- eft orders, that none of thefe young gentlemen Ihould be allowed even to hire a Roundel-hoy whofe bufinefs, is, to walk by his mafter, and defend him with his Roundel ox Umbrella ivom. the heat of the fun. A young fellow of humour, upon this laft order coming over, altered the form of his Umbrella from a round to a fquare, called it a Squaredel inftead of a Roundel, and infilled that no order yet in force, forbad him the ufe of it. Thefe orders, no doubt^ were given with a view of preferving ceconomy among the young people ; whofe circumftances were fuppofed not able to fupport fuch expences •, and whofe extravagancies in this and many other particulars had occafioned their contracting fuch debts with the natives, as they were not able to difcharge. So far it muft be allowed, that the company aded very laudably •, but at the fame the dangers that furround them, and of their own weaknefs, fufpend their nefts at the extreme branches of the trees ; they are confcious of inhabiting a climate replete with enemies to them and their young ; as, with fnakes that twine up the bodies of the trees, and apes that are perpetu ally in fearch of prey; but, Heaven-inftru&amp;ed, they dude the gliding of the one, and the activity of the other. The brute creation are more at enmity here than in other climates, and the birds are obliged to exert unufual artifice in placing their little brood out of the reach of the invader. Each aims at the fame end, tho' by different means; fome form their penfile nell in fhape of a purfe, deep, and open at top ; others with a hole in the fide, and others, ftill more cautious, with an entrance at the very bottom, forming their lodge near the fummit. But the little fpecies wedefcribe (the Taylor bird) feems to have greater diffidence than any of the others: it will not truft its neft even to the extremity of a flender twig, but one more ad vance to fafety, by fixing it to the leaf itfelf. It picks up a dead leaf, and, furprizing to relate, fews it to the fide of a living one; its (lender bill being the needle, and its thread fome fine fibres; the lining, feathers, goffamer, and down,' 7 time.[ 22 ] time as the Fort, Cuddalore, and feveral other black towns, in which the company's bufmefs is tranfaaed, ftand at a great diftance from each other, and it is almoft impoffible for a gentleman juft arrived from England, to walk from one to the other of thefe places in the hot months, without getting an inHammatory fever; were it only from motives of humanity, it is to be wifhed, that this moft refpeaable body of merchants would at their own expence, allow all their fervants not only the ufe of Umbrellas, but alio of Palanquins-, fince it muft always be judged a duty incumbent on the conftituents to take as much care as poflible of the lives of their dependants in any of our diftant fettlements, but more efpecially in this unhealthy part ot the world. f ( The prefidency of all our fettlements on the coaft of Coromandel, was feated at Madrafs, until the taking of that place by the French in the year 1746. From that time, it was eftablifhed at Fort St. David, and continued there till about the year 1752, when it was removed back to Madrafs', at the fame time, however, orders were iffued by xht Eaft Company, that a fubordinate council fhould be ftill held at rort St. David, under a deputy governor, who in rank was to be the next fenior fervant to the governor of Fort St. George. The fecond of this council was ordered to be ot the rank of a councillor at the prefidency i the remainder of the affembly was to be made up of gentlemen, whofe ftanding in the fervice was that ot lenior or junior merchants. At our arrival in India, Richard Starke was deputy gover nor*, 'Thomas Cooke Elq - , was fecond; Meff.

The natives on this coaft are black, but of different fliades. Both men and women have long fhining black hair, which has not the lead tendency to wool, like that of the Guinea negroes. You cannot indeed affront them more, * In June 1758 Fort St. David was taken and demolillied by the French; fince that time it has never been rebuilt. Mr, Call firft went into India as pupil to the late very ingenious Mr. Benjamin Robins, and did great honour to his preceptor, as well as fervice to his country, in his {kilful defence as engineer of Fort St. George, when it was befieged by the French in the years 1758 and 1759, under the command of Monf. Lally. 5 than[ 2 3 ] than to call them by the name of negroe^ as they conceive it implies an idea of flavery. The habit of the common men is only a piece of rag round their hips. The women in general wear a fafh of different colours, about four yards long, and fomewhat more than a yard wide. They turn it round their waift lengthways, letting the breadth hang down, which forms a kind of petticoat; then they bring the remaining part over their left fhoulder acrofs the body, and finifh where they began : this forms a tolerably decent drefs, as the part that comes over the fhoulders, quite covers the breafts. The children never wear any cloaths, till they are five or fix years of age. Their method of carrying them, is not, like our's, in the arms, but acrofs their hips. None of them know the ufe of a pair of ftays, and very few of them are any way de formed. The men in general are tall and well-fhaped, and yet very timor ous and pufillanimous. They are ill calculated for war, and except when they are led on by the Englijh or other Europeans^ feldom make any great figure in the field. Their beft troops are the Rajpout foldiers, who are greatly inured to watching, fading, and hardfhips : upon a march, and at all other times, their bed is no more than the fwath that goes round their middle,, fpread on the bare ground and their cartridge box ferves them for a pillow to lay their heads on; and yet with all their military difcipline, they never make any ftand, when oppofed to the regular forces brought from Europe, The Gentoo or Pagan religion principally prevails among the Indians^ of whom they reckon up a great number of what they call cafts, or tribes, which all preferve their particular cuftoms, and never interfere with each other.) I fhall here fet down a lift of the feveral calls, into which the people over India divide themfelves, with a brief account of their parti cular cuftoms. The moft honourable of the cafts, is that of the B rahmins . Thefe are gene rally priefts, and by their office have great influence over the minds of the peo ple. They lead very abftemious lives;, and as they admit xheMetempfychojis, and believe that the fouls of men tranfmigrate into the bodies of beafts,they reli- gioufly abftain from the flelh of all animals. They abhor alfo the propitiatory facrifice of brutes, and yetfome of them admit of another facrifice infinitely more cruel and inexcufable, I mean offering up the wife to the manes of her deadhufoand *. The admiral and feveral other gentlemen of our fquadron, were prefent at one of thefe facrifices, and were all greatly affe&lt;5ted at the fight. Mr. IVatfon difcovering, as he imagined, fome figns of reludance in the woman, while fhe was advancing towards the funeral pile •, ordered his interpreter to go and afk her, whether fhe voluntarily devoted herfelf to- the flames ?

The poor woman was by no means mfenfible of Mr. IVa fon s kmdnefs-, Ihe defired the interpreter to return him her moft grateti 1 thanks; but withal to aflure him, that (he was about to die, both voluntarily and chear- fully She foon afterwards placed herfelf at full length on a platform, which had been ereded for the purpofe-, folded her arms round the neck and bread of the corpfe, with the greateft tranquility and compolure continued tne embrace, until both their bodies were covered with the firewood heaped upon them: then their neareft relation put fire to the pile, which was no fooner lighted, than the Brahmins, feconded by the multitude, made a loud noile, and continued it as long as they luppoled any lite could remain in the viflim. This was done, probably, to prevent the woman^s ihrieks from being heard. The admiral and the company left the place with an exceeding dejection of fpirits •, while the natives, (more efpecially the Brahmins) rejoiced and triumphed in this diabolical rite *. The Brahmins in many points retain the tenets of the ancient Brachmans, who lived in this part of the world, and of whom fo many incredible particulars are related by the Greek and Roman hiftorians. Doctor Hyde, in his hiftory of the religion of the antient Per/tans, obferves f, that this people implicitly believed their religion was the fame as Abraham's, and that they had received it from him, and by way of boafting, they called it, Religio Abrahami. He alfo gives it as his opinion, that the ancient Brachmans and modern Brahmins, derived their names from Abraham, or rather Brdham, which is the common way of pronouncing that word amongft the Perjians. The next in rank are the Rajahs , the title of the ancient kings or fovereigns of the country •, fome of thefe Rajahs by (hutting themfelves up in the mountains, (till remain independent of the Mogul government. Dur ing the former reigns of the Rajahs, it is faid, India was in a ftate of perfect innocence. • Mr. Rollin, in the 7th volume of his ancient hiftory, makes the following reffefUons on a facrifke of this kind: ' The aftion of this woman, was undoubtedly a real murder, and might juftly be confi- dered as a violation of the moft exprefs law of nature, which prohibits all attempts on a perfon's own life; and commands us not to difpofe of it in compliance with the didlates of caprice, or forget that it is only a depofit, which ought to be refigned to none but that being from whom we received it. Such a facrifice is fo far from dcferving to be enumerated among the inftances of refpedl and amity due to a hulband; that he is rather treated as an unrelenting and bloody idol, by the immolation of fuch precious viAims.' f De Religione veterum Perfarum, cap. ii.

Polygars and Motres are a fet of people who live in the woods, and, we are told, make not the leaft fcruple to plunder every one that comes in their way. Thefe are all independant of the Mogul government. ( Banians are a very rigid caft. Thefe (like the Brahmins ) never eat of any thing that has had life, and never prefume to kill even the moft defpi- cable animal. They have their hofpitals for monkies, fnakes, &amp;c.—A few of them alfo retain the horrid cuftom of burning the living wife with the dead hufband. They are merchants, brokers, farmers, &amp;c.—The head fervants in Bengal are likewife called Banians,) Niers on the Malabar coaft, are of the firft caft. They are always gentlemen; behave with great haughtinefs towards their poor countrymen, and diftinguifh their fuperior rank by vearing a fword, and carrying a par ticular kind of ftick in their hand, different from thofe ufed by the common people. On the Coromandel coaft, thefe Niers do not carry themfelves quite fo high, but are contented to ad; in the capacity of merchants, nay they are fometimes obliged to take up with much humbler profeffions. Some of them call themfelves chriflians, and fay their anceflors were made fo by St. Thomas. They add, that the chriftian religion once flourifhed among therA in its greateft purity, and that they were governed by a Patriarch ♦, but the having murdered this holy man, chriftianity fell with him; for they could not but prefer even idolatry itfelf to a religion whofe profeffors could commit fo atrocious a crime. i Chowlies are efteemed learned men, and in general are merchants. ) The common people fuppofe that they have the power of life and death in their hands, and that they are very powerful in enchantments. » ' Chitties are a particular kind-of merchants at Madrafs, and are generally] very rich, but rank with the left hand caft, and are not permitted to be carried in their 'Palanquin through the llreet of the right hand caji, although many of the latter are only fervants, Parriahs are the lowefl caft on the Coromandel coaft: both men and women perform the moft fervile offices, and eat and drink of whatever they can get, without fcruple. . ■ r.

On the 9th si April, annually, at Bengal* the natives undergo a very un common kind of penance: fome, for fins paft; fome, for what they may commit •, and others in confequence of a promife made by their parents, that if they Ihould be bleffed with a child, that child, when he came of a proper age, fhould be bound to perform it.—This ceremony is as follows: In a large plain about a mile from Calcutta, there are ereded about thirty Bamboos, at lead twenty feet high on the top of thefe they contrive to fix a fwivel, and another bamboo of thirty feet or more croffes it, at both ends of which hangs a rope. One end of this rope, the people pull down, and the devotee placing himfelf under it, the Brahmin pinches up a large piece of (kin under both the fhoulder blades, (fometimes in the breads) and' thrufts a ftrong iron^hook through each : thefe hooks have lines of Indian grafs hanging to them, which the prieft makes faft to the rope at the end of the crofs bamboo, and at the fame time puts a fafh round the devotee's body, laying it loofely in the hollow of the hooks, left by the fkin^ giving way, he fhould fall to the ground. When this is done, the people haul down the other end of the bamboo, by which means the devotee is immedi ately lifted up thirty feet or more from the ground, and they run round as faft as their legs will carry them. This throws the devotee out to the full length of the rope, where as he Iwings, he plays a thoufand antic tricks, being painted and dreffed in a very particular manner, on purpofe to make him appear the more ridiculous. Some of them continue fwinging half an hour, others lefs. They have alfo their time of preparation for this cere mony, which is four days. On the firft, they abftain from every kind of food ; on the fecond, they eat fruit; on the third, they faft *, and on the fourth, they eat fruit again. During the whole time of the preparation, they walk about the ftreets in their fantaftical drefles, dancing to the iounds of drums, and horns; and fome of them, to exprefs the greater ardor of devo tion, run a rod of iron quite through their tongues, and oftentimes through their cheeks alfo. Theie are a low caft, and \\zsc. Brahmins peculiar to themfelves.

' A man of one of the Gentoo cafts, hath, for feven months paft, fwung about two twit or three hours every morning over a fire. Two ropes are faftened to a tree, one of his ancles hangs in a noofe made in the end of one of the * The author w^s a fpe^latorof thefe exhibitions, and has feen ten or twelve perfons (wing ing at the fame time.

It is faid, he doth this, neither by way oi penance, nor from religious motives, but to fulfil a relol Jtion he made to fwing in this manner, until he had colle&lt;5ted as much money from the fpec- tators as would make an entertainment for 10000 peifons: fome fay, tnat lie will get into a higher call by it. However, he is at prefent gone into the country for his health, and hath not yet acquired fufficient for fuch a treat. I am amazed to think, how he could fwing fo long, without didocating hU ancle, or injuring his brain. The fight of him in this fituation v/as (hocking, and gave me a fevere head-ach.' , On the firft of their November &gt; (which is about the middle of our Ofioher) al^ the Gentoo cajls in Bengal hang out a light on a tall bamboo near their refpedive houfes, and this they continue to do for feveral fuccefllve nights, in order (as they fay) to light their deceafed parents, who are fuppofed to vifit them at this time. On the eleventh night in particular, you will be fure to fee not only every houfe, but the doors and windows, and even the highways and floats on the river ttuck full of lights, and every man, woman, and child with one in their hands. This is the lafl; and concluding night, when they exped to be vifited by all their deceafed friends i for the entertainment of whom, they make a great Chezuonsov feaft, and place meat and fruit in every corner of the houfe. The inhabitants of Bombay have alfo a ceremony of heaving the cocoa nut (as they term it) which they intend as an offering or facrifice to the fea, on the profped of the Monfooris breaking up: At this time, men, women, and children go to the water-fide all finely drefled, and the principal man is efcorted by a guard of European foldiers, and throws a gilt cocoa nut into the fea: all the reft of the company throw in fomething that is eatable j and prefently after they begin to fit out their (hips and veflels for fea fervice. The Moors likewife, or thofe natives who are \Mahonietans, are not without their feafts and proceffions •, and are extremely fond of them,, as well as the Gentoos \ particularly, of their Hcijfan Hajfan^ in memory of the two fons of AH by Fatima {Mahomet's daughter) being killed in one day fighting for the faith. They carry about a model of the tombs oi their anceftors, made ot light bamboo and paper finely ornamented, for three days and nights; and are attended by people ridiculoufly drefied, fhoutino- and dancing to their country mufici On the laft day of the feftival, they carry thefe models into the fields with a kind of funeral proceffion, and there, by breaking them in pieces, put an end to the ceremony. A trial[ 29 J A trial of veracity frequently ufed among the Gentoos is the eating dry rice*, 1754. if the perfon be innocent, then, fay they, he will eafily fwallow it, but if guilty, — r - there will not be faliva enough in the mouth to carry it down the throat. They have many other trials, and even by fire; fuch as putting their hands into hot quickfilver, &amp;c, &amp;V. In what manner the man and his wife among the higher cafts live together, I cannot fay from my own perfonal knowledge, but have heard, upon terms very different from thofe pradifed by us in England-, for the wife, we were informed, never prefumes to fit down and dine with her lord, but (lands behind him, and with great complacency waits till he has done. That this is the practice with thofe of the lower cafts, frequent occafions among my own, and other gentlemens fervants, prefented, to convince us. Notwithftand- ing the Indians are naturally lazy and inaftive, (for they Qeep very much); yet every one endeavours after a livelihood; fo that you feldom fee a common beggar amongft them. Although there are many fchools for the education of children, yet they feldom learn more than their own mother tongue. It is indeed furprizing, con fide ring the great number of Englijh that are fettled amongft them, and with whom they have continual dealings, that they fhould not be able in common to fpeak our language fo well as the people near the fea-ports of Madagafcar, where a fhip puts in by chance once in a year, and ftays perhaps only ten days» Though It is cuftomary in this country to fee the children rolling in the fand and duft before the door, yet their parents are very tender of them ; and they in return are as careful of their parents in their old age. The people in gene ral are very friendly and willing to affift each other in difficulties; yet fome- times words run fo high between them, that they will fly at one another like two fighting cocks, but always take care not to proceed to blows with clenched fifts. I obferved more than once amidft thefe violent altercations, that they little more than angrily patteach others hands with their palms. They are everlafting talkers, and have fo much grimace in telling a ftory, that you would almoft fwear they had lived their whole lives in France. —Whenever they meet upon the road, they never fail to chat about the news of the country •, and as they are very fond of pomp and fhew, their topic of dif- courfe is commonly of the laft Grandee that arrived on the coaft—how and in what fplendor he lives—how rich his furniture—and how many attendants he keeps. During the whole time of fuch confabulation, they never forget to offer each other their Beetel and Chunam *, the former of which is a leaf, with a nut of the Areca tree, the latter a kind of lime i both of which they as commonly chew and make a compliment of, as the Europeans do their tobacco and fnuff. There are two cuftoms very prevalent among thefe people, which to an European appear very difguftful. The firft is their chewing fo great a quan tity of Beetel, which turns exceftively red in their mouths, and occafions them[ 3° J - r ? -t 'K-xcS J'heTengthTf their nails, and the blacknefs of their teeth both wh.ch they are very careful of preferving. They reckon one a mark of beauty the other of a good family. White teeth are held m fuch d.fefteem with them, that thev make ufe of an artificial enamel on purpofe to blacken them; they fay ' white teeth are only fit for dogs and monkeys.' And a fnghttul length of nails in their opinion, proves them to be well defcended, as it mamfeftly Ihews that'they have not been accuftomed to do fervile offices. I ftiall clofe the account of the feveral Indian cap, with an incident, of which I was an eye-witnefs during my (lay zt hort St. David. One day, in company with Mr. Doidge, the admirals fecretary, I was obl.ged to ao from the fort to the town of Cuddalore on fome bufinefs, relative to the hofpital. In pafllng the ferry, we mixed with a conliderable num ber of Indians, but of what cafi or tribe we did not learn One ot the men who was with us in the boat, chanced to have in his hand a muiical inuru- ment of the country, which differed very little from a common flute. Mr. Doidge held out his hand to the Indian in a manner which exprefied his defire of playing upon it, and he with the greateft eafe and politenefs delivered the inftrument to my companion-, who atcer looking at it a little while, put it to his lips, and blew upon it, and then returned it to the owner-, who, with rrreat gravity and unconcern immediately threw it into the river. We were botji amazed at this ftrange conduct of the Indian, till we got to Cuddalore\ where we learned from one of our countrymen, that he was one of thofe cafts, which looked upon the flute as contaminated by Mr. Doidge, and therefore, by the laws and cuftoms of his tribe, he could ufe it no more. ti » 5 '■ - ■ V. ■ &gt; ■ 't C H A P,[ 3 1 I CHAP.

Though the foil is fo barren as not to produce any one thing worth mentioning, yet the convenience of its fituation will always^ more than make up for that defeft. It may be juftly ftiled ' the grand ftore-houfe of all Arabian and Perfian commerce.'* When this ifland was firft furrendered to us by the Portuguefe, we hardly thought it worth notice; but, in a very few years afterwards, we experimentally found the value of it, and it is now become our chief fettlement on i\\z Malabar coafh i The natives are fhorter and Wronger made than thofe on the Ccromandel coaft; only four Cocleys carry a Palanquin here, whereas fix are generally ufed at Madrafs and Fort St, David. The inhabitants of this place are numerous, and are made up of almoft every nation in Aft a, among many others, we met with feveral Persees ; who, like their forefathers the ancient Pcrfians, are followers of Zor0after, who is faid to have modelled and reduced into order the religion of the ancient Magi ; the fundamental maxim of which was, the worfhipping only one God under the fymbol of light. They adore the fun,, and particularly the rifing fun, with the profoundeft reverence and vene ration i and by a natural conlequence of the worfhip they pay the fun, thty likewife pay a particular veneration to fire. I met with a very remarkable inftance of this while I was at Bombay \ one day paffing through the llreet, I heard a very uncommon noife, and feeing at the fame time a large fire rn one of the houfes, curiofity led me a little elofcr to it ; in the middle of the houfe was fet a large brafspan with a fire in it; before this fire, or rather on each fide of it,, two men were kneeling at 7 tiieix[ 32 1 their devotions, which they hurried over with great rapidity *. I looked on i f or a confiderable time with great attention, and afterwards learned from a fervant of the admiral's who was of this cafty that one^ ot them was a pricft, then on a vifit to another prieft in a fit of ficknefs. 1 his fervant like- wife told me, that the -f- Perfees have fuch a veneration for fire, that they never put it out, or fo much as breathe upon it; and I took particular notice, that while thefe priefts were at prayers over the pan of coals, they had a X kind of little white bib over their mouth, as 1 imagined, to prevent their § breathing on their favourite element. The prayers appeared to me, to be only a repetition of the fame let of words, from the fimilarity of their founds. The vifiting prieft ufed manygeftures with his hands over the fire, and afterwards ftrokeddown the face of the fick prieft, which I looked upon as the final benediftion, for prefcntly afterward the ceremony ended. This inftance, ftrongly corroborates Prideaux's obfervation concerning their ufage at public worfhip. ' The priefts themfelves never approach this fire in their temples but with a cloth over their mouths, that they might not breathe thereon: and this they did not only when they tended the fire to lay ou more wood, or do any other fervice about it, but alfo when they ap proached to read the daily offices of their liturgy before it. So that they mumbled over their prayers, rather than fpoke them, in the fame manner as the Romijh priefts do their maffes, without letting the people prefent articu lately hear one word of what they faid HU.' Thefe poor mifguided people proftrate themfelves before the fun under the fame notion that the Gentoos reverence an ox or a cow: from the excel lent qualities they obferve in thefe created beings, and their great ufeful- nefs, each is induced to fuppofe that the godhead dots moft certainly dwell in them, and under this miftaken notion they blindly pay that homage to the crea ture, which is only due to the creator. As the Gentoos burn their dead, one would think that the Perfees, who are fofond of worfhipping their deity under the reprefentation of fire, fhould bedefirous of having their dead bodies com mitted to that element, wherein they fuppofe their creator principally to refide. But contrary to this, and to the cuftom of all other nations in the world, they neither burn nor bury their dead, but caft them out in die open air, to be expofed to the feveral elements, where they are foon devoured by eagles, vultures, and other birds of prey \\. The principle they go upon is, that a living man being compounded of all the elements, it is but reafonable, after he is * Sonora voce per femi-horam memoriter recitant ta:diofam aliquam precandi formulam : &amp; tanta celeritate hoc faciunt, ut vix halitum reciprocare Jiceat, quafi invincibilis efiet necef- Jltas earn verborum formulam tantillo tempore recitare.

One afternoon however, I refolved to fatisfy my curiofity fo far as to peep into one of thefe edifices. I perceived feveral dead bodies; but there was little ficfh left upon the bonesand that little was fo parched up by the exceffivc heat of the fun, that it did not emit thofe (linking effluvia which there was reafon to exped. _ It was owing probably to the fame caufe, that the bones were rendered quite black.—Upon the whole, this is a moft odious and abomi nable cuftom, and the reafon they give for following it, is truly ridiculous. The natural -produce of the ifland of Bombay, is chiefly the cocoa-nut tree: from which they extract a liquor called Toddy, which is foft and mild when drank immediately •, but if it ftands long, it gathers ftrength, and he who ventures to take a good draught thereof dale, prefuming to find it pleafant and .innocent as when frefh, will be miferably deceived ; efpecially if his head be weak : and from hence, probably, arofe the term Toddy-headed. The fruit or nut of the cocoa-tree has many excellent ufes. The kernel is rich, fweet, and milky like a filbert; the fhell is not unprofitably made ufe of for cups and ladles ; but above all, the rind is worked up into a kind of cloth, which ferves the poorer fort of people for garments. It is alfo fpun as hemp, and makes very durable cables.—Of the body of the tree and the leaves, the poor people build their houfes. For each tree a tax of twenty (hillings a year is paid to the company, which is appropriated towards maintaining the gar- rifon, and Ihips of war. Bombay is the moft convenient place among all our fettlements in the Eafl Indies, for careening or heaving down large (hips; and for fmall ones they have a very good dock. At the time we were there, they were making * Dum facerdos ad com mod am dtflaatiam ftando, fepulturae officlum hoc modo recitat, ' Illa frater nofter dum in vivio, conflabat ex quatuor dementis: cum jam mortuus quodvis elementum fuam partem capiat; terrea pars abeat in terram, aeria pars in aerem, aquea parsinaquam, ignea pars in ignem.'

Indeed, this is the only place, inthatdiftant part of the world, for (battered fhips to refit at; having always a good quantity of naval ftores, and its very name conveying an idea of a fafe retreat in foul weather. On this lOand are many little forts and batteries, as Dungaree, Maffegon, Mahee, Mendhawts Point, and Sion-hill. Some guns are mounted on each of them •, but the principal fort which defends the place, has above an hundred. This building is a regular fquare, and the materials thereof are very good. The church alio is not lefs fubftantial than the fort; it is a very handlbme, large edifice, and in comparifon of thole which are to be met with in the other fettlements, it looks like one of our cathedrals. It was built by a voluntary fubfcription among the gentlemen of this faftory, and the Rev. Mr. Coble, (father to my late worthy friend Mr. Richard Ccbbe, Admiral Watfons chaplain) was the chief promoter of this truly pious work: he at that time refided at Bombay as chaplain to the facflory. The whole time we • pent here, palled very agreeably i for as the ifland lies in 19 0 north, the heats mult of courfe be more tolerable than they are at Fart St. David, which is in the latitude of 11 0 48' north. The admiral's family refided at the Tank-hcufe {to called from a large tank or pond near to it) and here, as well as at all their other fettlements, the company allowed the admiral and his principal attendants Palanquins, over and above the five Pagodas a day, which were given him to defray part of the expences- ot his table. As the Indian horfes are of little value, and yet very fcarce, oxen are here frequently made ufe of in their (lead •, and the admiral had a chaife and pair of thefe oxen allowed him alio by the company. They are com monly white, have a large pair of perpendicular horns, and black nofes. The admiral oftentimes went in this chaife for an afternoon's airing to Malabar- Hli, and to the end of 0/^ IVOman's ifland, to Marmulla, and many other places. In England, if thefe creatures are forced out of their ufual flow pace, it is too., well known that they, will faint or lie down under their burthen-, but at Bom- hay they trot and gallop as naturally as horfes, and are equally ferviceable in every other rsfped, except that by their being fubjed to a loofe habit of body, they- fometimes mcommode by the filth thrown upon you by the continual motion of their tails. Whenever we got to the end of our ride, the driver always alighted, and put the near bullock in the other's place- then he would put his hand into both their mouths, and after pulline out the froth, mount his box again, and drive back. It feems this precaution . is abfolutely neceffary, for as they travel at the rate of feven or eight miles an hour, they would otherwife be in danger of fuifocadon, a f^n^tT r/ e at 1 t00k P articillar notice, that at the death of deceltl nr In f ans u colka ' d t0 ^hcr and fung, either in the houfe of the uecealed, or. under the window i agreeable to that palfage in St. Matthew's , 1 gofpe!,. «[ 35 ] ■4 gofpel, when Jtfus came into the ruler's hd'ufei and faw the mtnfirels and, the 1754* people making a noife^ He faid unto them, give place, &amp;c. There it was that I alio firft favv the ceremony of their burning the dead. As the place was very populous, there were feldom lefs than three or four burned every night near the water's edge, under Malabar-hill. During my ftay at this place, I hired by the month, a chaife drawn by a pair of bullocks. In the feveral excurfions I made in this carriage, I had frequently palled by one of thofe religious perfons, or anchorets, who in India are called Joogees \ and who, in confequence of a vow made by their parents, and dur ing their mother's pregnancy with them, are devoted to the fervice of heaven. One evening, I and a companion had an inclination to pay afhort vifitto this Joogee ; who always fat in one pofture on the ground in a fhady cocoa-nut plantation, with his body covered over with allies, and his long black hair clotted, and in the greateft diforder. As we approached him, we made our falutation, which he refpeflfully returned; and then, with the affiftance of our Indian driver, who could fpeak Englijh, we began a converfation with him, that principally turned on the wonderful efficacy of his prayers, and which he pretended had given health to the fick, llrength to the lame, fight to the blind, and fecundity to women who for their whole lives had been deemed barren. When w f e were about to take our leave of him, I offered him aprefentof two rupees, which he bade me to throw on the ground, and then direded his fervant, who was (landing by, to take them up; which he did with a pair of iron-pincers, throwing the rupees at the fame time into a pot of vinegar. After they had lain there a little while, the fame fervant took them out, wiped them carefully, and at laft delivered them to his mailer •* who foon afterwards, by way of return, prefented us with a few cakes of his infipid paftry. I then requefted of him, that in his next prayers he would petition for an increafe of my happinefs •, to which, with great complacency in his countenance, he replied : ' I hardly know what to alk for you : I have 44 feen you often, and you have always appeared to me to enjoy perfe&lt;5b 44 health; you ride in your chaife at your eafe ; are often accompanied with ' a very pretty lady •, you are ever well cloathed, and are likewife * fat fo ' that you feem to me to be in pofTefTion of every thing that can be any way ' neceflfary to happinefs. I believe therefore, when I pray for you, it muft ' be in this drain i that God ivould give you grace to deferve, and to he thank- a ful for thofe many hlejfmgs which he has already heftowed upon you' I told him that I was thoroughly fatisfied with the mode of his intended fupplica- tion for me; and with a mutual exchange of fmiles and compliments, we parted. * The rich Indians we were told take great pains to make themfelvesfat. To this end, they not only live moft luxurioufly, but in the day time fleep in a Twinging cot, and appoint a fervant gently to move it, whofe bufinefs is alfo at ftated times to awake the mafter, meerly to give him an opportunity of fvvallowing half a pint or more of liquid butter or Ghee. This fufficiendy accounts for the jtoogee's emphatically mentioning corpulency amongft the peculiar favours of heaven, F 2 Our[ 36 J Our hofpital at Bombay was without the town-wall; and in order to make my attendance on it the more convenient, Mr. Deldguarde * (a fador in the* company's Icrvice) was fo obliging as to give me the ufe oi: a very commodious- houfe, which lay near the hofpital, and belonged to him as fuperintendant of the powder-works. Here I took up my refidence, with other gentlemen who afTiiled me in the execution of my duty. At a little diftance trom the front of this houfe is a capacious bafon of water, which for the greater part of the year is perfeflly dry, but, during the continuance of the rainy feafon, and fori fome time after, ferves as a pond for watering cattle, and fwarms with a fpecies of fifh about fix inches lon&lt;T, and not unlike our mullet. The natives catch them in great plenty foon after the rain fets in, and more than once I had them fcrved up at my own table f. This would be looked upon as a very extra ordinary circumftance in any other place; but as thefe fifli are found in almoft- every pool and puddle at Bombay, it ceafes to be a matter of wonder among the inhabitants of that ifland. Various have been the fpeculations of curious- and inquifitlve men to account for this phenomenon. Some have fuppofed, that the exhaling power of the fun is fo ftrong in the fultry feafons,. as to be able to raife the Ipawn of the fifh into the atmofphere, and there fufpend and nourifh it, till the rains come on, when it drops down again in the ftate of living and perfedUy-formed fifh. Others, perhaps with a greater degree of probability on their fide, imagine, that after the ponds become dry, the fpawn may pofllbly fall into deep fiflures made in the earth below the appa rent bottom, where there may remain through the whole fultry feafon, a fuffi- cient quantity of moifture to prevent the animalcule from corrupting; and. when the rain-waters come on and fill the pond again, the fifh is produced and made to appear in fuch abundance. This, among other hypothefes which I have heard offered on this curious fubjeft, feems beft to account for it-, bu; whether even this folution be adequate to the cfFeds produced, I fhall not prefume to determine. And now, having mentioned the rainy feafon, I mufl here beg leave ttv infert a very curious andexad account of it, as it was drawn up and given to nie by my late valuable and fkilful friend, Mr. Thomas., then furgeon of his- majefty^s fhip the Salijhury, This gentleman, who was a man of great- curiofity, and unwearied diligence, happened to refide at Bombay during the- whole time of the rainy feafon in the year 1756, and contrived a method* for afcertaining the quantity of water which fell there in that interval. His- way of doing it was as follows^ ' I procured a lead-cylinder, of about nine inches diameter, and as^ many deep, marked with .inches and tenths on the infidc j and to prevent. • This gentleman is fince dead. t Mr. Thomas obferves, that it is on the tenth day after the rains fet in,.that the natives^ Wgin to catch filh. 7 theI [ 37 j tiie water from fplafliing over, I cut a hole two inches from the bottom, 1754' and placed the cylinder in a glazed earthen veflel. Then I tied a wax cloth fecnrely round it, fo as to cover the veflel, and to prevent any water from get ting in, fave that which paffed through the cylinder. When more than two inches fell, I ftopt the hole in the fide with wax, and poured the water from the veffel into the cylinder to meafure it. I always kept it in an open place, free from the running of any houfe, &amp;c. and meafured it at fix in the morning, at noon, and at fix in the evening. About the beginning of the fky looked cloudy over 'j Inch '' Tenths, the land and on the 25th of that month, we had a fquall of &gt; o 3 wind, with fomerainj when there fell J On the 31ft we had the like weather, with much thunder and 7 lightning, and rain in the evening; when there fell —&gt; 0 ^ Total — 1 oj \ ' J U N[ 38 ] JUNE, 1756.

I have feen them from four to eight or nine feet long; they kill whom- foever they bite in 15 minutes. There are many of them to be met with at Cud- ddlore. The Covra Manilla, is a fmall bluifh fnake of the fize of a man's little finder', and about a foot long, often feen about old walls: A fpecies of thefe at Bombay kill with their bite much fooner than even the Covra Capella above mentioned.— The Palmira is a very thin beautiful fnake, of different colours; its head is like that of the common viper, but much thicker than the body. I faw one that was four feet long, and not much larger than a fwan's quill.— The Green fnake is of a very bright green colour, with a fliarp head; towards the tail it is fmaller than in the middle; The largeft part of it is no bigger than a common tobacco-pipe.—The Sand inake is Imall and fhort, but not lefs deadly than the others.—The Covra de Aurellia is not unlike an earth worm ; it is about fix inches long, and no bigger than a fmall crow-quill.— This kills by getting into the ear, and caufing madnefs, &amp;c. —The 1 Manilla Bomho is a beautiful fnake of almoft the fame fize throughout its whole length, except at the two ends, where it comes to a point.

Thefe veflels were not unlike the tartans of the Mediterranean, only a great deal lower; they tarried two nuns in their bow, and vaft numbers of men. Their mufic was a plain brafs r tube, fhaped like a trumpet at both ends, and about ten feet in length • and a kind of drum called a Tomicm, being a fkin ftretched out on a large ihallow brafs-pan, on which they ftruck with two large (ticks, and made an amazing noife. Each fleet confilled of about 30 lail; but among Monavee Angria's there were two ketches, which they Called Grabs. Our 'Eaft India company had here one fhip of 40 guns; one of 20; one Grab ot 18 guns, and ieveral other veflels; more alfo weie building.

Before we take leave of this place, there remains a piece of antiquity to be mentioned, called the Elephant a \ which is an Indian temple, cut out of a Jarge rock, in an ifland of the fame name, near Bombay. The fame ingeni ous gentleman, Mr. Thomas, in the papers he left behind him, has furnifhed me with the following defcription of it. ' Its dimenfions may be beft known from the plan annexed, which was drawn on the fpot. The walls are covered with figures about 12 feet high, except thofe of the baths, in the front of which, next to the voranda or open gallery, they are only 4 feet in height, and on the back about fix. The grand altar is filled with a mutilated figure of the god Orixa, the head and neck of which are much decayed through time; and all the other principal parts of the temple are crowded with images of the fame god in different attitudes. The other figures which we faw here, I fuppofe are reprefentations of famous men. On each fide of the grand altar is a dark room. Perceiving the floor of thefe to be hollow,, we had the curiofity to dig into one of them, and found a large cavity, fa very deep, that we did not go any farther. The roof of the temple is about 18 feethigh^ fupported by pillars, the number of which is given in the plan. They have all a Iquare pedeftal, circular fhaft, and fluted cornifh, which is alfo circular. Near each of the vorandas, there is a fquare room with a pillar in the middle, and another fimilar room in the body of the temple. The pedeftals of thefe pillars are fquare, and about a foot high; the fhafts are round, and about a foot and a half long. In the room next the baths, the pillar isfurrounded with water, as expreffed in the plan by dots. Thefe three xooms appear to have been formerly private chapels.' CHAP,r 46 ] j -ft, C II A P. IV.

On the 15th however, we took our leave of governor Bourchier and the gentlemen of the council; and on the 16th we weighed anchor, and flood for the offing. A frelh gale fortunately fprang up, which foon ran us down the Malabar coaft, and to the fouthernmoft point of the ifland of Ceylon. On the 13 th oi January 1755, we arrived in Fort St. David's road, (having made an unufual quick paffage for this feafon of the year), and on the 18th in that of Madrafs where, to our great fatisfaflion, we found riding at anchor his majefty's fhip the Cumberland, Commodore Pocock and in eight days afterwards we were joined by the T'yger, Captain Thomas Latham, who had failed from England with Mr. Pocock. Here we learned, that during Admiral WatforC* ftay at Bom- bay, a conditional treaty had been adjufted between Monf. Godeheu and Mr. Saunders, which was to continue in force until it fhould be either rati- fi 5 d L 0 Lvi ea:ed by their rel P e(5live companies; fo that there was no profped of hoftihties recommencing here, at lead for eighteen months ; and in this long interval, xht French had a fine opportunity of acquiring riches fufficient to carry on another war: for by this conditional treaty, they were to con- tinue in pofTeffion of thofe many important countries, as well in the Larnatic as the Deccan, which by their intrigues they had fecured to them- e s , and whofe revenues brought them in almoft a million fterling; whilft In ^ ^ f 0nS d,d , not ^nually bring more than the fame number of rupees, deed, this was by all deemed to have been a mafterly ftroke of French C r rary ' the adv ^ ta g« refulting from'this treaty to the c l om P an y' were beyond every ones comprehenfion; for it excluflve of fo^e, our troops on the coaft exceeded thofe of the in number one thoufand. The[ 47 1 The town of Madrafs, or Fort St. George^ in the road of which we came to an anchor on the 18th of 1755, is the chief fettlement belonging to our Eaft India company on the Coromandel coaft-, and ftands between the thirteenth and fourteenth degrees of north latitude. It is fituated in a fandy barren foil, and the climate is fo intenfely hot, that were it not for the fea- breezes, which agreeably cool the air, it would be altogether uninhabitable. But notwithftanding this inconvenience, the place is exceedingly populous. Many of our countrymen refiding there, to ruaintain their dignity among the natives, live in all the magnificence of the eaft. The governor of Fort St. George is invefted with great authority, little lefs than that of iovereign power. Pie is not only prefident of this place, but of all our other fettlements on the Coromandel coaft. He, and the council under him, have the command of the army, the regulation of the police, and the appointment to all places of trull and profit. In a word, Aladrafs is of fuch importance to the company both for its internal wealth, and the extenfive commerce which is there carried on, that they have taken abundant pains, and have been at an immenfe expence, to make the fortifications as ftrong as pofTiblei The fort (which is the principal defence of the place) is a regular fquare, with a glacis, and covered way, and the whole town is furrounded with walls well mounted with artillery. The buildings at Madrafs, or the town of Fort St. George where the Engltjh only refide, are handfome, and built in the modern European ftile: but the houfes of the Black-?own are very low and flat-roofed-, fome of them are tiled, and others thatched, but neither the one nor the other have any chimney. The natives commonly drefs their viftuals without doors; and fhould they make a fire within, which feldom happens, the fmoke is obliged to make its way through the eaves of the houfe, which has fcarcely ever any upper rooms. This is the flate of the houfes of the merchants and mechanics,, who refide within the town •, and as to thofe of the pooreft fort, who live in the luburbs, and in the country, they are nothing but huts covered with Cajan leaves, and are fo exceedingly low, that their miferable inhabitants cannot ftand upright in them, and whenever they enter, are obliged to creep in on their hands and feet.: but though the houfe and garden belonging to thefe country people, feldom take up more than half a quarter of an acre of ground, you fcarceiy meet with lefs than ten or twelve perfons in a family, befides- an hog and a buffalo; fo very numerous are the inhabitants of this country. The Indians in general are very temperate in eating and drinking j they feldom ufe Itrong liquors, unlefs prefcribed by way of phyfic. Their food is chiefly boiled rice, with now and then a little fifli, and mutton or fowl dreflfed in a Cwnry, as they call it,, which is very warm to ^he palate. This, I have reafon to think, they alfo fealf on with great moderation. The Gentoo cafts never eat beef-, they pay adoration to the image ot the cow, and have a proverb among them, 44 that they would as foon taile of the flefh of their parents, as of that animal.' One ftrong evidence of the temperance of thefc 7 people,. I 755'[ 48 1 I 755' people, is their hands, which, if touched by chance, you will be fure to find J very cold, even in the middle of the hotted day •, while the hands of the Europeans are burning with an exceflive heat, partly the effe6t perhaps of our intemperate way of living. Let me add too, that the Indians are a very quiet, inofFenfive people *, and at ibme diftance from the lea-fhore, we were told, that we ftiould alfo find them honeft and fmcere. On the coaft, they will make ufe of a thoufand tricks, and ftratagems, to over-reach a ftranger. But for this we may thank ourfelves, who firft fullied their purity, and debauched their manners. They probably had never known the crime of cheating, had they not firft learned it from the tricking European, Among the lower cajts the poor women do all the drudgery ; they get all the fodder for the gentlemen's horles in the fort, and are obliged to bring it fome miles. They likewife grind all the rice ufed in their own houfes; fetch wood and cow-dung to burn-, and as the wafer near the fort is brackifh, they are daily neceflitatcd to go a mile or two to a good well, and to bring a large pitcher of this element upon their heads for the ufe of the gentlemen of the fadlory. I have more than once feen a line of 40 or 50 of them in a morning, engaged in this laborious employment. Their drefs is much the lame as that worn by the women at Fort St. David ; and that of the higher ca/ls, at both places, differs nothing from the lower, except, that the wrapper which goes round the loins of the former is made of finer ftufF, and that they commonly cover their breafts with a filk handkerchief. It is very feldom that any of the women, unlefs thofe of the loweft rank, can be feen, being forbidden by their call to ftand any where to be gazed upon by ftrangers. In our morning walks, indeed, we fometimes faw them (landing without their houfes for the benefit of the frefh air, but upon the firft fight of us, they never failed to run in, and fhut and bolt their doors. Wc could not but remark too, that whenever we had occafion to go into a (hop, our guide always gave us a hint to ftand a little while at the door, while he ftepped in-, and he made no fcruple to confefs, that his motive for doing it, was to clear the houle of the women before we entered. Much has been faid in regard to lervants in this country : fbme fpeak hignly in their favour, while others equally depreciate them. The fervice ot any^one of them is exceedingly cheap, but the number which you are ODiigc-a to keep, makes it dear in the end. Perhaps it may feem furprizing, though true, that an European gentleman or merchant in a confider- able way of buhners, cannot hire lefs than a dozen or fifteen ; for as they are a molt all of different cajis, the higher are not permitted to do the leaft thing which is the bufinefs of an inferior caft. ' They all wear turbans; the prin° cipal lervants commonly drefs neat and clean, in a robe of fine cotton cloth, or mu in, particularly the Gentoos^ whole religion enjoins much bodily purifi- &lt;L 10n ' ' e re ore the firft thing they do ih a morning is to go down to Iflliriv 1 an 1 W: I ' and afterwards to fay their prayers on the banks. and » L r m , ,/ t I y P ray for ' the y w ' 11 be rure to fay, « 0 wil (hew favour for mafler, that maficr may fhew favour for B[ 49 ] ihm' They are an artful cunning people, and very ready at returning an *755 anfwer. We met with a thoufand inftances of this fort, during our (lay in -v the Eaft Indies-, but the following ftory will beft illuftrate the natural good fenfe and fagacity of thefe black fervants. It happened, that an Englijh officer being with his Indian fervant in a public houfe at Cuddalore, was in a violent paffion, in confequence of fome- thing that had pafled between them in converfation: In the midft of the mafter's fury, his philofophical fervant calmly placed himfelf at his full length on the floor, with his face towards the ground, at the fame time flopping his ears with both his hands. In this poilure he continued, until his mafter's pafiion had fomewhat fubfided *, when getting upon his feet, and refpeftfully approaching him, he dryly faid, ' Indeed, mafter makes poor fervant's head fick: mafter is very ftrong man, hut fervant is very weak man: if mafter fpeaks honey-words, then fervant can do any thing for mafter, but when mafter frightens poor fervant, then he makes poor fervant Jick and when fervant is fick, mafter's huftnefs can no he done''' The officer replied with an hearty d—mn ; but upon recolledion, felt the juftnefs of the rebuke, and faw very plainly that before they could again proceed on bufinefs, it would be neceflary for him to con- * form to the rules which the Indian had fo fagacioufly and artfully fuggefted for his condud. The following lift of the feveral forts of fervants employed in India, with their names, wages, religion, and employments, will furnifh the inquifitive reader with a clear and diftind idea on this article. 1 .(Chief Dubafh\ who is a fervant of ftate to ufher in company, to receive meflages, and give an anfwer at your door. He is alio your linguift, and lays out your money. He has for his profit a Fanam out of every Pagoda paid and received*, and a Pagoda out ot every hundred Pagodas, There is no poffibility of tranfafting any bufinefs in this country without a fervant of this kind, except at Bombay, where they are not made ufe of. They are called Banians at Bengal, and are every where of the Gentoo religion.) 2. Dtihafh Boy*. He is always about your perfon to affift you in dref- ing •, he walks by the fide of your Palanquin ; takes care of your fword, hat, and cane, when you are vifiting a ftranger; and waits behind your chair at table. He likewife is of the Gentoo religion, and his pay at Madrafs is i pagoda and 21 fanams by the month •, at Bengal, 8 rupees. 3.{ Conucopola. He keeps your accounts, pays the reft of the fervants their wages, and affifts the Duhafh in buying and felling. At Bengal he is called fecretary, and is of the Brahmin caft and religion :) his pay is io rupees * Boy is the common appellation in India for many of your fervants, though they Ihould be threefcore years of age. H ' by[ 50 ] by the month. At Bombay he is filled Purvo, and is of the Gentoo religion, and his pay is 5 rupees by the month. At Madrajs, his pay is 8 pagodas, 4 Roundel-Boy. He carries a Roundel or Quit de Soliel over your head, to defend you from the heat of the fun, when you ftep from your Palanquin, or when you walk. 5. Peon. One who waits about the houfe, to run on meffages; and he commonly carries under his arm a fword, or in his lafh a Crefe, and in his hand a ratan, to keep the reft of the fervants in fubjeaion. He alfo walks before your Palanquin, carries Chits or notes, and is youi body guard. The more of thefe you keep, the grander you are thought to appear. Some gentlemen have at leaft 40 ®f them in their lervice.

Their pay is 2 rupees and a half by the month in Bengal, and in the fame proportion at other places. This diftindlion of fervants, and the keeping up to it, is reckoned no bad piece of policy in the Indian conftitution. For as the people are naturally indolent and inactive, every man by this means gets a decent livelihood with very little trouble, which is the thing he aims at; for though each of thefe fervants could earn double the wages in the intervals when his mafter has no occafion/ , [ 5 1 I occafion for him, yet confcious that he has a fufficiency, though bare, he (its 1755. down contented therewith, chafing rather to trifle and fleep away his time, than v to enrich himfelf and family by taking pains. Thefe fervants have a variety of tricks alio which they are fure to play off upon new-comers •, and where two or three of them are concerned together in a knavidi one, they never fail to puzzle the matter fo, as to make it almoft impoITible for the matter ever to ' get at the truth *. The palanquin bearers, are cunning diffcmblers, for they will be fure to groan fadly under the weight of their new mailer or miftrefs, let them be ever fo light. This is done with the view of exciting in the human bread a companion towards themfelves, and thereby acquiring fome Buxie money •, and in this they feldom fail of fucceeding, as there are but few Europeans, who, on their firft arrival, are not averfe to the making life of their fellow-creatures in fo degrading, and in appearance fo painful an employment. After the fervants have filled their bellies, they always betake themfelves to reft on the ground, or in a window, or on a table, or mofl commonly on the fand, which they prefer before every thing elfe, becaufe of its retaining the heat of the preceding day's fun. Upon the whole, the Indian fervants have both their good and bad qualities they are like fome neceflary evils we have in England, of whom we fay, there is no living with, nor without them. I cannot difmifs this fubjeft of fervants without fpeaking fomewhat more of the office of a Conucopcla. —It muft be premifed, that the natives in this part of India know but very little of the ufe of paper, pens, and ink ; and therefore keep all their accounts upon Cajans, the leaves of a certain tree. It is the Conucopola's bufinefs to keep the account of all your houfehold expences, to pay the other fervants wages, and tradefmen's bills, Thefe fervants are al-ways to be diftinguifhed from all others by their Cajan leaves, which hang dangling by their fide, like a butcher's fteel. The iron inftrument they mark with, is kept in a fheath like a knife. When they have occafion to fet down any thing, they hold the iron-pen in the right hand, and the Cajan leaves in the left; a little notch or groove is cut in their left thumb-nail for fixing the ftile, and they will write or rather engrave with great celerity. They are likewife very quick and ready at accounts, but fo very artful, that they feldom or never declare their own computation firft : their low cunning is inconceiv able, and it would be endlefs to recount all the artifices and frauds which are praftifed by thefe men. They generally afk ' PVhat does mafter make account come to If you fay more than it really is, they prefently cry out, 44 Very right, mofter' But if you make it lefs, fo as to prejudice them, they will be iure to take particular care tocorreft your reckoning. If you chance to detect them in any intentional cheat, they then plead the cuftom of their country •, tor their maxim is, ' What white man forget, that God give black % * The reader may fee a very remarkable Inftance of their dark and complicated villainy in Ornies excellent hiftory of theCarnauc, vol. i. p. 350 to 355. H 2 nan.[ 5 2 j man. Mafler, forgive this one time \ I am poor foolijh fellow \ what Jljculd I know ? * Aha! Jfee majler knows heft \ God has made good head for mafler r To the account I have given of the feveral Indian Servants^ for the better knowledge of a country now fo interefting to Great Britain, I beg leave to add a few particulars relative to the nature and genius ot their Mechanics.— The Cloth-merchants, forib they are there termed, feldom or never make ufe of a yard or meafure of any kind, but mete out every thing by the cubit-, which, in well-proportioned people, is the fpace between the elbow and the tip of the middle finger i and this they do with luch exaflnefs, as not to err perhaps-* of a yard in a piece of 70 cubits. It is alfo the cuftom in this part of the world, as if is in moft of the country towns in England, to oblige the taylor to come home, and work at your own houfe : but on viewing themiferv able condition of fome of this tradefman's tools, his rufty fcififars in particular^ and how loofely riveted, you would think it impoflible for him ever to cut out a coat with'them: It is much the fame with all his other implements; but in fpite of every inconvenience he labours under, the Indian taylor is fo exact an imitator, that he feldom or ever fails to give entire fatisfadion. And this is the more furprizing, as he never meafures you; he only.afks ' mafler for mufier,' as he terms it, that is, for a pattern, and they will be fure to keep exactly to it, be the fafhion thereof ever fo extravagant. The fame obfervation holds true with refped to the Carpenter, Black fmitb, and many other mechanics. It is aftonifhing how exa6lly they will copy any thing you give them, though they fcarce know the ufe of ten tools, and though the few they have, are always in bad condition. Every thing they undertake, they keep a long time in hand however, which is entirely owing to their own obftinacy and abfurdity ; for they will never be put out of their old way of working -, and fhould you be ever fo defiroir of inftrucfling them, or fhewing them a more expeditious method, they will be fure to plead the cuftom of their forefathers, for which they have fo great a veneration, that they were never known even in a fingle inftance to depart from it. ^ Hence it is eafy to conclude, that tKey muft always remain poor. Whenever therefore you employ them, you are always obliged firft to give them in hand, by way of expedition money, commonly half of what, your bargain comes to: and befides this, if the tradefman you employ be in want of the neceflary mate rials, (which is too often the cafe) you are then under a neceffity of fupplying him with three parts, if not the whole.money beforehand.) This is a cuftom frequently attended with many inconveniences-, for under the fanftion there of, it is not uncommon lor thefe, tricking mechanics to go about from houfe to houfe borrowing money, though at the fame time they do not intend to touch the promifed work with one of their fingers. The Siher-fmith, in regard to his fmall ftock in trade, is exactly upon the fame footino - with the- reft of his neighbours: he has not the leaft article in his fhop to indicate-his profeffion -, it you want any thing to be made by him, he too will afk for - wufter, and you mud alfo lurnifh him with as many rupees, qx other filver; I - tOj&gt;[ 53 I to melt down, as will enable him to go through with the work. The Btrier However Teems to be an exception to all the other mechanics here; i mean with relpeft to the condition of his tools and (having tackle. He doth not po about in this country, as in England, with a large pewter balon under one arm a wi'--box under the other, a water veffel in his right hand, and a powder-bag in his left. The ihaver and powderer here are two diftind trades. The former, for his extraordinary apparatus, is worth remarking: when he enters your houfe, if you did not know him before, it is impoffible for you to s-uefs at his profeffion. The implements he ufes, fuch as 8 or 10 razors, an hone, an oil-bottle, two leather-ftraps, a little looking glafs two or three towels, his beetel-nut, bectel-leaf, chunam-box, foap and little brafs-bafon, are all contained in the girdle that is round his middle. His manner ot operation is ftill more extraordinary, for he beats up a lather y our head, not in the balbn, which is no bigger than a large tea-cup •, and lhaves you eafier than ever 1 experienced from.any of the profeffion in England. (Upon the whole, though the Indian mechanics are by no means deficient^ in the handicraft arts, yet their talents feem to be only of a fecond rate kind.). In many refpefts they certainly do not come up to the dexterity of Euro-', pean artifts, particularly in thofe works where great accuracy is required. They likewife labour under a poverty of genius which makes them dull at invention, but at the fame time itmuft be acknowledged, that they aremoft! admirable copyifts, and indeed their principal excellency Teems to lie thac^ way.) The fkill of their phyfical people is very mean. Mr. Thomas- and I once employed one of the black dodors to procure us a lift of fuch medicines as they ufed in their pradice. Inftead of this, he brought with him a number of leaves, plants, barks, roots of trees, i3c. which, he told us, they generally made ufe of in decodions; and that their common method of practice was, it one root, leaf, or herb failed, to put in others of different forts. In tcveis, he added,, they ufed pepper, and fuch-like inflammatory fubftances. We enquired whether they had any written accounts of their method of practice; he told us they had, and brought us a large book, made up of a number of leaves of the Palmita tree, fuch as they keep their accounts upon, part of which we after wards got tranflated by a black Conucopola or cleik. It was v^ntten in the hio-h Eajiern ftile, and began with giving great praifes to the Almighty for the wonderful formation of man : it then went on with obferving that this formed man was divided into two or three hundred thoufand parts; ten thoufand of which were made up of veins ; ten thoufand of nerves •, feven- teen thoufand of blood; a certain number of bones, choler, lymph, &amp;c. ■ &amp;c. &amp;c. And all this was laid down without form or order, either of hif- tory, difeafe or treatment. We found this to be all the written account they have of phyfic •, which they never ftudy, but, like the other calls, the fon of a doftor is a dodor alfo, and fo he will continue to be from generation to generation,.mummuamwi r 54 ] i-rr The cuflom of inoculating for the Small-pox among the natives, though not common in other parts of the Eaft Indies, is frequent in Bengal-, and the manner of performing the operation is in many refpefts fingular, and different from that now pradlifed in England. They take, as Mr. Thomas and I were informed, fome matter from the pock of a perfon who has the difeafe in a favourable way, and put it into a phial or gallipot. They then dip the point of a needle in this matter, and with it prick the perfon intended to be inoculated feveral times in a circle, on the flefhy part of the arm. If he be a grown perfon, they prick him in both arms. After the blood is wiped away, they rub fome more matter on the part, and order the patient to bathe in cold water three times a day, and to live on the moft cooling things he can poflibly procure, fuch as water melons, cucumbers, rice, water,As foon however as the fever comes on, which happens about the fifth or feventh day, the patient is ordered to leave off bathing and the cool diet, and to live on milk and fugar : the fever generally lafts three days, and then goes quite off. On the fecond day after the pock has appeared, they wafh the whole body with cold water, which fills the puftul&amp;s; and this they do for the three fucceeding days, two or three times each day, continuing the fame regimen of milk and fugar for diet. When the pock is drying off, they fprinkle the patient with role-water; or when this cannot be had, with the juice of Suttamullie, Suttapot, Culmee, and root of green turmeric. If the pock be very thick, they give the patient Joan-feeds to chew, and frequently tie Bang-\ezves, (which is a kind of hemp) on the parts moft affeded. It is a common pradice among the Portuguefe, and fome of the Indians on the Malabar coaft, when the pock is fairly turned, to lay on wood and cow-dung afhes very thick, which they think imbibe the matter, and make the fcab fall off the more ealily. They leave it to nature to difengage herfeJf from this compound of afhes and puftulary difcharge. Their hopes of a cure from this method, feem to be founded on the fuppofed antiputrefcent and abforbent quality of the allies. I refer it to better judges to determine whether this pradice be rational or not; however, in general the patients recover from this loathfome dilbrder. M Tl-x:- CHAP.[ 55 ] C H A P. V.

ON the coaft of Coromandet, the N. E. monfoon * blows from November to March or April r and fomctimes to May, when the S. W. monfoon commences. Along this coaft the current generally fets with the wind ; to the northward in the S. W. monfoon, and to the fouthward in the N. E. mon foon. To avoid the danger that might, and too frequently doth enfue from the fhifting of the monfoon, we failed from Madrafs the 7th of April, in company with the Cumberland, Tyger, Salifhury and Bridgewater, for Trin conomale in the ifland of Ceylon, and on the 22d of the fame month came to an anchor in that harbour. At five in the afternoon Mynheer Van Beaumount the governor came on board to congratulate the admiral on his fafe arrival at Trinconomale, and to offer him every affiftance the place afforded. At his leaving the fhip we faluted him with 13 guns. He afterwards waited on Commodore Pocock on board the Cumberland, and at his taking leave of him, was faluted by the fame number of guns. The next day the admiral and commodore, attended by all the captains of the fquadron, waited on the governor at the fort ^ they were received in the great hall with trumpets, drums, and three vollies of fmall arms. After drinking coffee, tea, and a glafs or two of wine, they took their leave. They were complimented, both at their entering and quitting the fort, with a difcharge of 21 guns. Trinconomale harbour is a very good one for fhips to put into when in diftrefs, and perhaps is better calculated for wooding and watering a fqua dron, than any other in the Eaft Indies. It very much refembles that of Portfmouth, and is almoft quite land-locked ; but this laft circumftance, in fo ■ * There is a fpeclesof winds obfervable in the Indian feas, within the tropics, called by the failors monfoons, which during fix months of the year blow one way; and the remaining fix the other. The occafion of them in general is this: when the fun approaches the northern tropic, there are feveral countries, as /Irabia, Perjia, India, &amp;c. which become hotter, and refieft more heat than the feas beyond the equator, which the fun has left; the winds therefore, inllead of blowing from thence to the parts under the equator, blow the contrary way; and when the fun leaves thofe countries, and draws near the other tropic, the winds turn ^bout, and blow on the oppofite fide of the compafs. At the time of the fhifting of thefe winds, the Indian feas are very fubjeft to be tempeiluous, and the navigation becomes very unfafe.

The trade of this port is very inconfiderable, and it is manifeft that the fole view of the Dutch in fortdy.ng this and the feveral bays and rivers round the ittand, is to prevent other nations from fettling here, or having any commerce with the natives. The idand oi Ceylon is very large, being 250 miles long, and 200 broad. The inner part of it is in poflcffion of the natives, who are of the Gentoo reli gion, and they call their king the king The Dutch having taken care to fecure to themfelves the whole fca-coaft, endeavour to reconcile him to their converting the rich fpices of his country to their own advantage, by making him frequent prefents; but fometimes they have found him very refradSry, and their fucceeding in this important point has been attended with great difficulties. There are many trees of different kinds to be met with on this ifland, fuch as the euphorbium, tulip-tree, ebony, redwood, caffia, cocoa-nut, co-tton, lime, mamoe, citron, and black and yellow teak-, thefe laft have a moft beautiful grain, but are fo hard as to be very deftrudive to dae cabinet-maker s tools. But the tree peculiar to this ifland, and which has proved the fource of inex- haufhble riches to the T)utch, is the Cinnamon, which grows wild in every wood on the fouth weft part near Columbo, but there are few to be found near rrinconomak. This tree is propagated by a bird's eating of the fruit, pare of which he difcharges again, and afterwards the feeds ot it take root. It arows fomewhat like our common hazel j the leaves relcmble thole of the. laurel, but with this difference, that they have only three fibres in their compofition. According to fome, it has three barks; but all agree that it has two. What they ftrip from trees of a middling growth, is the beft Cinnamon.. The very young trees are not fit for rinding, and the old ones they cut down for firewood. From the root of this tree, the Camphor a is extracted. But the greateft quantity of this laft drug is brought from Sumatra, where it is fold in fmall flat cakes, at the enormous price of 4/. fterling an ounce. One pound of this genuine gum, Mr. Thomas was told, will produce an hundred pounds of fuch as is brought to us from the Indies after adulteration. Coffee alfo grows wild here ; as do the trees and plants which produce Balfam. Capivi, Lacca, Gambogium, Cinquenomale. Not having heard of this laft before, M.*. Thomas imagined it to be a name given by the natives to a certain drug. A Butch furgeon refiding here, fhewed him a balfam or oil extraded from it by diftillation, and which he aflured him was a very good medicine in a paralytic numbnefs. This gentleman alfo prefented him with a fample of a gum growing here, which he called Badu!e:' hel 57 J fie told me it was but lately noticed, and that as yet they knew not the ufe of it. Every morning and evening we were gratified with a line odour from the trees that were in bloom. At firft we took them for the cinnamon, but they proved to be nothing more than common flowering fhrubs, of which the whole ifland is full. The foil between the hills, which are very high and rocky, is a fat red earth-, and the vall'es are extremely pleafant, having a clear rivulet running almoft through every one of them. Here are alfo veins of black chryftal, intermixed with fpar, and iron, and fome black lead, and copper ores. I am almoft perfuaded alfo that this country produces tin, for Mr. Thomas *, who was a Cornijh gentleman, and particularly curious in fuch matters, aflfured me, that during his ftay on the ifland, he picked up as fine a piece of ore of that kind as ever he had feen in Cornwall and that he intended carrying it home with him in order to fhew it as a fample. I fhall only add, that if this very valuable com modity is really to be met with in this country, it is aftonifliing that the crafty Hollander fhould not as yet have found it out, who was never known to fpare pains in difcoveries of any kind, as this would manifeftly turn out to his inexpreflible advantage. The ifland alfo produces topazes, rubies, garnets, &amp;c. which the inhabitants difcover by wafliing the foil they grow in. Neither harp-Jhells nor ventel-traps are found here, but numbers of painted cockles, and others which are commonly called the panama-Jhells. We found the country to abound alfo with many uncommon curiofities; particularly the creeping leaf: This is certainly a fpecies of the grafhopper; it has every member you fee in common infeds, fuch as head, legs, wings, and body, and of a pale green colour, but yet in fhape and appearance exadly refembles a leaf. A great variety both of wild and tame fowl are to be met with here, and which are fold at a low price. A dozen of fowls, or five ducks, for a rupee, not quite a half crown of Englijh money. The bay, which has many coves, abounds in fifh, efpecially the cavally, and JurmuUet •, thefe are to be had very cheap. The fame may be faid of the fruits of the ifland, fuch as pine-apples, jacks, bananoes, cocoa-nuts, mangoes^ &amp;c. &amp;c. A pine apple may be bought for a penny or lefs, and all the other fruits in propor tion. Money is the fame here as in Holland-, they have only a different way of reckoning, as 8 doit to a cajb, 12 cajh to a rupee. A rupee goes but for two fiiillings fterling, or four fchillings Dutch', 96 doit make a rupee. Common deer they have here, in great abundance, and alfo Guinea deer, but few other horned cattle, and thefe too very fmall. We killed fix of * The author is obliged to Mr. Thomas for moft of the obfervatiorvs made on the country near Cvlumbo. I theirill '7 [ 58 ] r - their oxen one day during our (lay at Trinconomale, and the weight of the ^ whole amounted but to 714 pounds. One of them weighed only 70 pounds. How different were thefe little, defpicable animals, from the oxen which we flaughtered at Madagafcar, each of which weighed from 6 to 700 pounds and upwards ? But however fmall and contemptible the breed of bullocks may be on this ifland, nature Teems to have made her full amends in the ftupendous fize of her elephants, which are faid to be the largeft of any in the known world *. The Elephant is certainly the moft extraordinary of all animals, and well merits a particular defcription. His body is heavy and grofs, gene rally of a dark, dirty colour •, and though, when arrived at full growth, he is from twelve to fourteen feet high, and from eighteen to twenty in circumference, yet his head is Hill larger in proportion; and what is more extraordinary, his eye is no bigger than that of an hog, which it exadly refembles. His legs are like four large columns, rather long than fhorc, and jointed like a cat's juft above the feet, which are round at their bottoms, and do not Ipread much beyond the bulk of the legs. His ears are flat, hanging down, and furprizingly large; the tail is fmall, but long, with a few briftles at the end. At the two corners of his mouth grow two large tuiks or teeth, which are what we call ivory; thefe are fix or feven feet long in the male elephant \ in the female they are feldom half that length. But the moft extraordinary part of this animal is his frobofcis or trunk, which is long and hollow like a trumpet,, and ferves him inftead of a hand -f- to feed himfelf, being able to move it with incredible agility and ftrength, and to take up therewith the fmalleft thing from the ground, by means of a little point, which he can twift round it. His common food is leaves of trees, grafs, corn,, and fugar-canes, of which laft he is particularly fond. Notwithftanding the unwieldinefs of this beaft, his motions are very alert, and he walks with great eafe, fait enough to keep a man on a good run. Many incredible ftories are related by ancient authors of the docility and inge nuity of this half-reafoning animal. They are faid to be fufceptible of affec tion, fondnefs, gratitude and modefty. There is nothing but they may be taught: Arrian, an author of veracity, relates, that he had feen an elephant dance with two cymbals fattened to his legs, which he touched alternately in cadence with his trunk, and that many others of the fame fpecies gambol'd round him, keeping time with an aftonifhing exa&amp;nefs. Pliny too, fpeaking of the elephant which carried Poms in the battle he fought againft Alexander the Great, tells us, that perceiving his mafter quite finking under the wounds which he had received, he lowered him- * Elephantas ii multo majores erant quam quos fert India. Plint us, t Manus data elephantis, quia propter magnitudinem corporis difficiles aditas habebant ad galtum., Cxc. de Nat, Dm. lib, 2. », 123. felfj,t 59 ] fdf, that he might fet his nlafter down without hurting him, and puHed 1755. out the arrows which ftuck in him with his trunk ; at length perceiving v —-v~ him to faint through lofs of blood, he placed him again upon his back, and conveyed him in fafety to the camp : A moft amazing inftance of the docility and gratitude of the elephant. No wonder therefore that the ancients made uie of them in war, and fometimes with great fuccefs; but fince the invention of fire-arms they have, not been found of equal ufc as formerly •, for they are remarkably terrified at fire, and will at the fight of it, frequently turn back upon their friends, and overthrow every thing that Hands in their way. They are chiefly ufed at prefent for the fording deep rivers, and carrying over the baggage on their backs. After the keepers have loaded them with feveral hundred weight, they fallen ropes to them, of which the foldiers taking hold, either .fwim, or are drawn acrofs the river. In time of a6lion, they now and then fix an heavy iron chain to the end of their trunks, which they whirl round with fuch agility, as to make it impoflible for an enemy to approach them at that time. Another ufe they ftill have for this creature in war, is, to force open the oates of a city or garrifon which is clofely befieged. This he does by fetting his backfide againft them, riggling backwards and forwards with his whole weight, till he has burft the bars, and forced an entrance: to prevent which, moft of the garrifons in this country, have large fpikes ftuck in their gates, that projed to a confiderable diftance. However, after all, thofe prodigious animals are kept more for fhew and grandeur than for ufe, and their keeping is attended with a very great expence, for they devour vatt quantities of provifion ; and you muft fometimes regale them with a plentiful repaft of cinnamon^ of which they are exceflively fond. 1 have been told, that it is no uncommon thing with a Nabob, if he has a mind to ruin a private gentleman, to make him a prefent of an elephant % which he is ever afterwards obliged to maintain at a greater expence than he can afford : by parting with it, he would certainly fall under the dif- pleafure of the grandee, befides forfeiting all the honour which his country men think is conferred upon him by fo refpeftable a preient. The notions of the Indians concerning the elephant are various. It has been in all ages, and is to this day, the cuftom of the oriental nationjs, to wrap up all their wifdom in fhort fentences or proverbs, allegories and parables. Some of the Indians literally believe that the globe of the world is lupported by an elephant ; which notion probably had its rife from a proverb of theirs to that purpofe, but which certainly meant no more, than that the commerce of their country depended in a great meafure upon elephants. I could not but remark too, that in almoft all their Pagodas, or places of worfhip, ( they have the image of this creature depicted on the walls. Some imagine, that they place the elephant here as an emblem of * Eutrapelus cuicunque nocere volebat, Veltiraenta dabat pretiofa H or , Epiji* xviii. lib, i. I ^ God's'Ls ^LLL^UHUiHia^-' - « —' - tmrnmammmmimmmm f 60 J 1755. God's omnifcience; while others rather think that they pay adoration to^ *-—r^—' him, as being endowed with greater fagacity than themfelves, and therefore pray to him for a portion of his wifdom. Hie natives relate another inftance of the docility of thefe ereatures, that in marching with an army,, they gather up every ftick of fize they meet with on the road, which towards the evening is fometimes increafed to a faggot large enough to drefs alt- the provifions for that night. But not to mention any more of the multitude of things reported of them; the following particulars are what I obferved myfelf. They gene rally Jland under the fhadow of fome fpreading tree, to prevent their being ftung by the little ant, which, notwithftanding their gigantic fize and bulk, is a great terror to them. To prevent his crawling about them, they are continually taking up duft or land in their trunk, and throwing ic over their heads and backs; nay they fometimes take a whiip of ftraw or grafs, and brufh themfelves down with it behind, whilft with their briflly tail they fweep- their fore-parts. When you firft approach them, they are taught by their keeper to make their Salaam or obedience to you, whrch is done by falling almoft backwards, and making a prodigious eruftation or rattling in the throat, mot much unlike the firft breaking of thunder. The keeper then mounts his fhoulders, which he could not poflibly do without the elephant's affirtance, who for that purpofc crooks one of hrs legs: the keeper's firft ftep is made- on his lower joint, the next on his knee, and he then Iprings upon his back r laying hold of the flap of his ear. After the elephant has performed many tricks at the word of command, then, to fhew you how capable he is of picking up the moft minute thing with his trunk, you are defired to lay a fiiver fanam upon the ground : this, which is the fmalleft of all coins, the eleplant feels about for till he finds, then takes hold of it, and gives it to* the keeper, as feated upon his back.. He laft of all throws out his trurilc to its full length, by way of fhaking hands with you, and thus the cere mony is ended. Another circumftance I obferved was, that whenever they drank, they always firft ftirred the water, and made it foul with their feet: The reafon for their doing this, is, that the gravel and fmall ftones which they hereby fwallow, help to digeft their food ; and not, as fome alledge, that they render the water muddy, becaufe they hate to fee their own figure in that element. One more particular relating to thele animals, is their furprizing age. ^ It we could depend upon what we are told by Philcjiratus,. in his lite of Apollonius 'Tyaneus, and believe that this- great traveller faw the very elephant on which Torus rode in the battle againft Alexander, that^ elephant muft have been above 400 years of age. 'That they live .till between 2 and 300 years is ftrongly believed; and it is certain, that tley are in full vigour, at much above an hundred : but it leems that sothing can be faid with certainty as to the exaft time that they ufually f 1V u-'n W f neve ^ ^ afked any of the Indians a queftion relative to this aiWayS anrwered mes ' Tb' etyhant was my great-grand- The-[ 6r J The natives catch the elephant by the following method: they have two- places ftrongly inclofed; one contains feveral acres of land, the other is but fmall. When they intend to hunt, which they always do in the nighty they go in a large company, with each man a veffel of fire on his head- As foon as the elephant fees the light, he purfues; the man that is fmgled out runs into the large inclofure, there drops his fire, and retires to a tree; the elephant prefently employs himfelf in trampling and fcattering about the fire. When they have a fufficient number of them in the large inclofure, fhey fhut up the firil paffage, and then decoy the elephants one by one into the fmall place, where they get ropes about them, and by the help of tame elephants convey .them home. Sometimes, however, the men are overtaken before they reach the inclofure, when they throw down the fire* and fly to the next tree for fecurity. The 'Tyger alfo is an inhabitant of Ceylon \ this beaft, though fome- times found in other countries, yet is in a peculiar manner a native of the* Eaft Indies. Malabar is the moft famous for the breed of this animal: there are it feems three kinds, but that which I am going to defcribe is the largefb, and by way of diftinftion, is called the Tyger Royal's his fkin is of a yellow, fandy colour, fhining and gloffy, with long black ftripes ; his head and mouth very large; eyes exceeding lively; teeth long and yellow; legs very thick, with furprizing fharp claws; and the tail is perpetually in motion. The female tyger is laid to be much more fierce than the male, efpeciaily when fhe has young. But they are both beads of prey, and that of the moft cruel and lavage kind for it is obfervable, that as the lion never eats any creature till after it is dead, and even groans while he is killing it, indicating a generofity of temper, fo the tyger tears his prey to pieces while it is living, and feems to delight in torturing it. If he meets with a dead horfe or a fheep, he will not touch it •, but if a tyger, tygrefs, and their young fall in with an herd of cattle, or flock of fheep v they are fure to make a terrible havoc among them ; for as they will only fuck their blood, and paunch a few of them, they have been known to deftroy four- fcore fheep in one night. They generally hide themfelves behind fome thicket in an inclofed country, from whence they dart out with incredible fiercenefs either upon man or beafl; that is pafling by. Monfieur Thevenot, a French writer, fays, that ' if a man flands boldly upright, without betraying any fymptoms of fear, neither lion nor tyger will venture to touch him.' This affertion feems to have no manner of foundation, at leafl [ fhould not chufe to venture on the experiment. It is very well known, that if ten men are in company, they will fmgle out one particular perfon from the reft-, and they alio fddom care to attack a white man, if a black man be among them. The reafon for their making this diftinc c tion, is, probably, that taey are better acquainted with the black men, and. had rather prey upon them,, than upon Europeans-, to whom they are- ftrangers..

The woods in tins ifhnd abound with various forts of venomous infects-, fuch as fnakes, of an enormous fize and length ; I had a view of one that meafured 15 feet in length, and 30 inches in circumference; fcorpions, centi pedes, fpiders, tarantulas, &amp;c. I faw a fpider here as large as a toad, with brown hair upon it the legs were of the thicknefs of a large tobacco-pipe, and more than four inches long. A fcorpion alfo, which was taken out of a piece of wood, was brought on board the 9th of May, which meafured 8 inches from head to tail, exclufive ot the claws : the fhell was as hard as that of a crab. 1 killed a centipede here which was more than 7 inches long. The natives of this ifiand are the ftouteft Indians I ever faw. Mr. Knox in his hiftory reports many ftrange things of their religion and cuftoms, none of which I had an opportunity of feeing. He fays, that ' they have various ways of treating their dead. Some burn them, (which is not uncommon in India,) while others throw their limbs up into the forks of large trees.' This may be true, becaufe when our wood-cutters were once hewing down a (tick of timber, there fell from it, the fcull, and many bones of an human body ; and I alfo faw here a human body hanging on a tree. Other hiftorians relate, that the natives of Ceylon feed on human ficfh ; nay that they eat the bodies of their deceafed parents, imagining that no other fepulchre is fo fit for them as their own bowels, fince hereby they think they are changed into their own fubftance, and live again in themfelves. This fhocking cuftom is reported of the ancient Scythians, and poftibly it might have been ufed by the old inhabitants of Ceylon, but it is now in both countries entirely abolifhed ; and yet even at this time, theie iflanders are faid to make cups of their parents fculls *, with a view that amidft their mirth and jollity they may be fure to preferve a relpeclful remembrance ot them.—W hat a difference has cuftom wrought between Sir William Temple, in the 2d part of his Mifcellanea, obferves, that it was a fixed and general opinion among the weftern Scythians, that all thofe who gave themfelves up to war- f actions and enterprifes, to the conquefts of their neighbours, and flaughter of enemies, an ie in battle, or of violent deaths upon bold adventures and refolutions, went im- rnt late y to tae vail hall or palace of their god of war, who eternally kept open Oj' e *. or a11 luch guefts, where they were entertained at infinite tables, in perpetual feafts an mirt , carou ing every man in bowls made of the fculls of their enemies they had lain, accor mg to the numbers of which, every one in thefe manfions of pleafure was the moft honoured and the bell entertained.

The boats ufed by the natives of Ceylon are trees hollowed ; but when- the boat on account of the fize of the tree is too fmall, they build on top of it a trough, fquare at both ends; they are about 12 or 14 inches wide, and as many feet long ; the tree part at the bottom is much wider; they have outriggers and fails, much the fame as at Madagafcar.

The ancients, particularly Ptolomy, obferve that * Taprohana was famous for producing the largeft breed of elephants^ which is alfo true of Ceylon.

But in a few days after, we began to be fenfible that our anxiety for leaving Trin- conomale in order to return again upon the coaft, (the fcene of aftion) had occafioned us to be there too foon ; for unluckily the monjoon did not change till after our arrival; and when it did, it blew with fo much violence, that we foon defpaired of riding out the ftorm. Therefore, on the 24th ot May all the Ihips were obliged to put to fea, but returned •gain to St. David's road on the 31ft, without having received any material damage *. The * The S.

They were accompanied by Lieutenant Carnac, Mr. Doidge the Admiral's fecretary. and Mr. Cobbe, who gave me the following agreeable relation ot their tour. * i « Our retinue confided of two fets of Palanquin-boys for each perfon^ Dubajh-hoys, 20 Peons, a great number of Cooleys to carry the tent-baggage* tables, «' We were at anchor in the Namur, in For/ St. David's road, Thurfday z/pri/ 13th 1749. In the morning it blew frefh. Wind N. E.—N. E. by E. At noon we veered away to a cable and a half on the fmall bower. From i to 4 o'clock, we were employed in fetting up the lower rigging. Hard gales and fqually, with a very great fea. At 6 o'clock rode very well. At half an hour after, had four feet water in the hold. Immediately wc cut the fmall bower cable, and flood to fea under our courfes. The (hip laid out S- E. and S. E. by S. Our mate who cut the cable was up to his waiil in water at the bitts. At half pafl feven, we had fix feet water in the hold, when we hauled up our courfes, and hove overboard moft of our upper, and all the quarter-deck guns to leeward. By three quarters after eight, the water was up to our orlop gratings, and there was a great quantity between decks, fo that the Ihip was water-log'd. Then we cut away all the mafh, by which the (hip righted. At the fame time we manned the pump, bailed, and foon per ceived that we gained upon the (hip, which put us in great fpirits. A little after nine o'clock, we founded, and found ourfelves in nine fathom water. The mailer called to cut away the Iheet-anchor, which was done immediately, and we veered away to a little better than a cable, but before Ihe came head to the fea, (he parted at the chefs tree. By this time it blew an hurricane! You may eafier conceive, than I defcribe, what a difmal^ melancholy fcene now prefented itfelf. The Ihrieking, cries, lamentations, raving, defpair* of above five hundred poor wretches verging on the brink of eternity ! I had prefence of mind however to confider, that the Gtd All-mighty was alfojthe God Ail- merciful, with the comfortable refledion and hope, that I had ever put my whole truft in him. I then made a (hort prayer for his protection, and jumped over-board. The water at that time was up to the gratings on the poop, from whence I leaped. The firll thing I wrafped was a capltan bar : from which, in company with feven more, I got to the David,'but in lefs than an hour, I had the melancholy fight to fee them all waflied away, and myfelf remained alone upon it, almoll fpent. 1 had now been above two hours in the water, when, to my unfpeakable joy, I faw a large raft with a great many men driving towards me; when it came near, I quitted the David, and with much difficulty fwam to, and by the afMance of one of our quarter-gunners, got upon it. The raft proved to be the Namur'i booms. As foon as we were able, we lafhed the booms clofer together, and fattened a plank acrofs; and by this means made a good Catamaran. —It was by this time one o'clock in the morning. Soon after that, the feas were fo mountainous as to turn our machine upfide down, but providentially with the lofs only of one man, About-four o'clock we ftruck ground with the booms, and in a very little while, all that furvived got on fhore. After having returned God thanks for his almofl miraculous good- nefs towards us, we took each other by the hand (for it was not yet day), and trufting ftill in the divine providence for protedion, we walked forwards to find fome place to (helter us from the inclemency of the weather, for the fpot where we landed afforded nothing but land. When we had walked about for a whole hour, but to no manner of purpofc, we • J. etur ' e . to the place where we had left our Catamaran, and to our no fmail uneafinefs found it gone. Day-light appeared foon after, when we found ourfelves on a fandy bank fi tc !

So that our whole » - train confided of near 200 perfons. The firft night we reached Porto- Novo, where we encamped. The next day we got to Deve -Cotah. Mr. Hopkins the chief, having received fome previous notice of our coming, met us upon the road with another company of Sepoys and becaufe the weather was fo bad as to prevent our proceeding in our journey, he entertained us for three days at his own houfe in the moft friendly manner. Deve-Cotah is a fmall fettlement belonging to the Englijh Eaft India company, and was taken from the king of Tanjour by Major Lawrence in the year 1749. It is but weakly fortified j and indeed the only rea- fon that induces them to hold it, is, becaufe it is a fort of key to all the Tanjour country. Here we continued till the weather became more favourable, when we again fet out upon our journey, and having crofled one branch of the Coleroon, we on the fame night reached a Choltre within a few miles of that river. (A Choltre is not much unlike a large fummer-houfe, and in general is little more than a bare covering from the inclemency of the weather. Some few indeed are more fpacious, and are alio endowed with a falary to fupport a fervant or two, whofe bufinefs is to furniih all pafiengers with a certain quantity of rice and frefh water. They are all of them built at the expence of private perfons ^ for as it is a fundamental law in this country, that every individual (hall do fomething towards the benefit of the whole community, fo they are fure exadly to fulfil it, -according to their refpedive abilities.) One man therefore plants a tope or grove, a fecond digs a tank or large pond, another repairs a From our firfl: landing to our arrival at Porio-Novo, we loft four of our companions; two at the place where we were driven on fhore, and two in crofling the river. After we had fufficiently refrefhed ourfelves at Porto-Novo, the chief there was fo obliging as to accommodate me with an horfe and guide to carry me to Foyt St. David, where 1 arrived about noon the day following, and immediately waited upon the admiral, who received me very kindly indeed ; but fo excelfive was the concern of that great and good man for the lofs of fo many poor fouls, that he could not find utterance for thofe queftions he appeared defirous of alking me concerning the particulars of our difafter. Till I reached/Vro-A'oiyo you beheld me fhipwrecked and naked: I muft again repeat it, that the Dutch received, refrefhed, and kindly conveyed me to my truly honourable patron ; through whofe goodnefs and humanity, I am not only cloathed and comforted, but alfo made lieutenant of the Syren, from which fhip I date this letter.

The method of travelling in this part of the world is very fingular, and therefore worthy of notice. As the roads are not furnifhed with inns, you are obliged to carry mofl of your provifions with you, and all the implements to drefs it. Ta your Cooleys or fervants, whom you hire for this purpofe, you pay fo much by the day, and they find themfelves in viduals. Their chief food is rice, and their drink toddy, both of which are eafily to be procured in any part of the country, and at a reafonable price. The Gocleys are very extraordinary fellows for bearing fatigue •, and are very little impatient either of hunger or thirfL Their common rate of travelling is four miles an-, hour, and I have known them walk four-and-twenty hours without once breaking their faft. As people in this part of the world always travel in large companies, it feldom happens that the whole caravan arrives at the place of deftination at the fame time.') It is the cuftom therefore for thofe who get in firft, to make the neceffary preparations for the reception of fuch who are behind. The making a fire for drefling the victuals, is always the firft thing done, for which purpofe fome are immediately ient out to pick up Hicks, whilft others are as neceflarily employed in mixing the ingredients for making punch, &amp;V. One of the greateft inconveniencies attending a traveller, is the difficulty of his getting a draught of water from any of the natives, Ihould he chance to go on fafter than the Cooleys who carry his utenfils. Among the higher caftS) I have known their fuperftkion carried fo far in this refped, as to infift on all Europeans lying upon their backs, while the water is poured into their mouths, left they fhould defile the veflel by the touch of either their hands or lips. Upon the whole, though the method of travelling m India is not a little inconvenient to ftrangers ; yet it muft be owned, that the many ridiculous fhifts they are necefiarily put to, and the feveral laughable occurrences which happen upon fuch occafions, more than cc penlate for the lois of better accommodations. com- After haying pafied a very merry evening at this choltre, every man be- o im e to is palanquin as a bed, while all our attendants flept around An ^ 'I m r lin: be confefled, that except when they have drank too- i4. 0 r f 1? errnerite ^ toddy, or ftupified their brain with hang and heetel- dlfturWe M 8 ^ ^ ^ Wil1 Wake with ™ife Or ■went on with ^ morm ng before fun-rife, we refumed our march, and ou any impediment till we got to another branch of the CstlerooBy[ 69 J Coleroon, which was To much fwelled by the late rains, that for the prefent it was judged impaffable. We were now within little more than gun-fhot of Chilamharamy and therefore were very unwilling to turn back, after having taken fo much pains. Our Harcar prefently relieved us from our anxiety, by afTuring us, that we ihould be able to ford the ftream in lefs than two hours, for he well knew that the tide had a great influence on this river, and he added, that it was now on the ebb. This intelligence gave us all great pleafure •, therefore we made no difficulty of putting into the next choltre, and there with great content we fat down to breakfafl:. During our ftay at this choltre, we had leifure to examine the feveral. travellers, who had poifeffion of it before our arrival. They chiefly con fided of thofe remarkable pilgrims, who come from the kingdom of Bengal, and carry about with them velfels filled with the water of the Ganges, which is faid to have been confecrated by the ancient Brachmans, and at this time is fuppofcd to perform many miraculous cures. What truth there is in it, I cannot pretend to fay •, but this is certain, that almoft the whole life of thefe poor creatures is fpent in this kind of pilgrimage, and there are many families in Bengal, whofe fole dependence is the carrying about this facred water to the feveral Brahmins in the fouthern part of India, who again difpofe of it among their refpeflive difciples. It is a common faying, that there are cheats in all profeffions ; and for fome time we had reafon to fufped it here» For upon our offering a large fum of money for one of their veffels, a certain old woman in the company began to liften to the propofal, and looked rather with a wilhful eye upon the gold which we held in our hands. On this a general clamour and uproar arofe among the reft, which had fuch an effecft upon the old woman, that, whatever her intention might have been, fhe burft into a flood of tears, which put an end to our offering her any farther temptation. In about two hours we plainly perceived that the ebb was made i and feeing at the fame time an herdfman with a drove of cattle pafiing over,, we were induced to try the fame experiment, and fucceeded in it without any difficulty. We had no fooner got into the town of Chilamharam, but Mr. Carnac fat down on the bank of the river, and wrote a letter to Monf. Ville Nove the commandant, refiding at this famous pagoda, acquainting him with Mr. Watforfs arrival, and that the whole party were defirous of making him a vifit. To which he immediately returned an anfwer, that ' We did him a great deal of honour, and hoped that we would come in fans cere monies Monf. Ville Nove was only a lieutenant in the French lervice, but a very genteel, well bred man. He entertained us with all the politenefs of his country. After dinner we drank their Britannic and Moft Chriftian Majefty's health's, good fuccefs to each of our Eaft India companies affairs; and the ladies Madrajs Pondicherry.. Our ftay here was not above[ 7° ] _ r five hours, rather too (liort to make any remarks upon the place but what _ - r - j I remember I will briefly let down. Chilamharam Pagoda is one of the largeft in all India. It was once in the pofleffion of the Englifh, who neglefting it too much, entrufted the defence of it to only a lerjeant and twelve men. The French taking advantage of this, made a kidden attack upon it, and took it with great cafe.) Irs walls and gateways are ftrong and well-built. On the third inner wall are four lubilantial towers, curioufly wrought with figures of gods and pagods, and very much relembling the wefc end of our cathedrals. In the middle court or (quare is a very large tank of water, which is com mon in this country, and is uled tor bodily purification. It has a great number of little pagedas or chapels round it. The paintings are but indifferent, and coniift of itrange prepofterous figures. Towards the upper end, there is a dark repofitory, where they keep their Swamme, that is their chief god. The French indulge the Indians with full liberty of com ing hither to perform the duties of their religion, and never in the lead interrupt them. This indulgence, by the bye, brings in no fmall gain to the craftsmen; for as this place is a kind of Mecca, where all perfons arc obliged once in their lives to come and pay their devotions, fo the pil grims are always making the French confiderable prefents for granting them this toleration.) However, the prefent grand remains of the page da at Chil- amharam, are very well worth a traveller's obfervation, as they convey to the mind a very clear and diftindt idea of its former magnificence.' No« many weeks after Mr. Wat forts return from his excurfion to Chilam- bar am, he had the fatisfadion to receive his majefty's commiffion, promoting him to the rank of Rear-admiral of the Red, and he accordingly hoifted the red flag at the mizen-top-maft head : and at the fame time Mr. Pocock (to the very great pleafure of the admiral, and of every other gentleman of the fquadron) hoifted the white flag on the fame maft-head on board the Cumberland. The promotion of thefe two gallant officers gave great latisfadion not only to the officers in the marine department, but to thofe of the king's troops, and the company's land forces, to ail of whom our two admirals had carried themfelves with fo much affability and politenefs that they flood very high in their affedion and efteem. Such an harmony and good underftanding prevailed among the feveral branches of military gent emen in this part of the world, as promifed the fureft hopes of fucCefs, mould an opportunity offer of attacking the enemy. / L. Whilft our fquadron lay at Fort St. David, M ahomed -A llv, Nabob of Arcot (in whofe intereft we were engaged) arrived in that neighbourhood. As foon as he drew near the boundaries.

Watfon having firft given him notice of their intention, and the Nabob in v—— return fending word that he was ready to receive them, The ceremonial obferved upon this occafion, was, the admirals, captains, and lieutenants were carried in palanquins two and two a-breaft. .The number of midlhip- men indeed was fo great, that no palanquins could be got for them; they therefore walked on foot, four and four a-breaft, at the head of the palan quins, dreffed in their uniforms, and with their fwords. The admiral's fecretary, chaplain, and a few other ftaff-officers of the fquadron, doled the proceflion. At their coming within a fmall diftance of the Nabob's camp, they were met by his captain-general, who was fent out in compli ment to the admiral, and who prefently conduced him to the Nabob's tent; at the entrance of which he flood, and received Mr. atfon with great politenefs, embracing him at the fame time in his arms. The admiral immediately prefented to him his brother officer Mr. Pocock, and after him, the captains, lieutenants, and midfhipmen, acquainting the Nabob, as he received them feverally to his embraces, in what chara6lers they ftood. 'When this firft ceremony was over, the Nabob (hewed them the feveral apartments of his tent. He placed Admiral JVatfon on a wool-pack, which made his feat fomewhat more railed than the reft. At Mr. [Vatfons left hand Mr. Pocock was feated i and to the left of him the captains, lieu- tenants, &amp;c. On the admiral's right hand, the Nabob placed himfelf, and next him were ranged in order the feveral officers of his court. The Nabob was between thirty and forty years of age, and of a middle ftature. His complexion was much lighter than that of the common Indian. His drefs was entirely white, and confifted of a long robe or veft- ment which reached down to his heels. His turban was alio white, and quite plain. In fhort, he had no other mark of diftin6tion about him, but that of a truly majeftic countenance, tempered with a great deal of plea- fantnefs and good-nature. The admiral (by means of an interpreter) con gratulated the Nabob on his feeing him in fuch good health, and aflured him that he was particularly happy in having this opportunity of paying him perfonally thofe marks of friendfhip and efteem which he had long enter tained for him, on account of his excellent character. To this compliment of the admiral's, the Nabob made a very handlbme reply. Mr. Watfon after wards rejoined, that ' he was extremely concerned for the calamities which the Nabob's country had experienced in the late war; but he hoped better times were now coming on, which would more than compenfate for all paft misfortunes.' The Nabob in the eaftern ftile replied, ' It is true, fir, that I have fuffered much, but the remembrance of thofe troubles is no more; the heavens have made me ample amends for all thole misfortunes in the honour I receive from your vifit^' Mr. JVatfon, with a heart full of honefty, and with a countenance which fpoke the fincerity of his foul, aflured him, that 44 the thing he moft paffionately wifhed for, was an occafion to do him fervice j and that it was principally for this purpofe, the king his mafter[ 72 ] i-r- had fent him wrt'h Ws fquadron into the Indian feas.' The Nabob- appeared greatly pleafed with the franknefs of this declaration, and immediately turning to the feveral officers of his court, he repeated to them the admi ral's words, and they too, upon hearing them, did not tail to participate in the joy of their matter. The Nahoh, upon this occafion, ordered a rich perfume of what is called the Otta of rofes to be brought to him, a few drops of which, he put into his hand, and having himfelf opened the bolbm of Mr. Watfon\ fliirt, he rubbed the fame over the admiral's breaft. This was intended as the hisheft honour he could confer upon him. He afterwards did the fame to Admiral Pocock and his Bukhjhi, or treafurer, performed the like ceremony on all the other officers: Beetel-nut and chunam were then moft plentifully diftributedi and (howers of rofe-water fell upon all. Mahomed-Ally then folicited Mr. Watfon to give him leave to make him a prelent, which the latter nobly declined, repeating to him, that ' the king of Great Britain had fent him thither to do the Nabob fervice, and to fecure to him his country from the attacks of all his enemies •, which commiffion he would always execute with fidelity, but could never think of diftrefling him by accepting prefents, which he very well knew in the prefent circumftances of things could be but ill fpared.' He concluded, with ' defiring him always to look upon him as his fincere well-wilher, who would be glad to fhew him thofe real marks of friendfhip which his king and countrymen had for him, and of the attention which they paid to his interefls.' The Nabob appeared extremely furprized at this uncommon ftrain of generofity in the admiral, though at the fame-time he could not .be dif- pleafed with it. They parted foon after, exchanging a more familiar embrace, than what they had given each other at their firit meeting. Mr. Watjon returned to the fort with his whole company, which confifted of about an hundred perfons, and all had the honour of dining with him. The day following. Captain Hajlup, a brave and experienced officer, and commandant of his majefty's artillery, waited upon the Nabob* accompanied with almoft all the other officers in that department. And they all met with a moft gracious reception. The Nabob foon returned thefe feveral complimen tary vifits, paying them in the order his own judgment beft directed him; ■viz. to the admirals, colonel, governor, and commanding officer of the train. In the vifit which he made to the two admirals, he came from his camp to within a fmall diftance of the fort, leated on the back of an elephant, tie was accompanied by two moft beautiful boys, his fons, who rode on the fame animal, and whom he afterwards introduced to the admirals. Nine other Elephants were loaded with his grandees* domeftics, and band of mufic. His train confifted of ten or twelve camels, befides three or our hundred horfes, five or fix thoufand Sepoys, and perhaps ten thoufand ? Cooleys[ 73 ] cooleys and fpe&amp;ators. As foon as he came near die fort, he alighted from his elephant, and then got into his palanquin^ which was the richeft I ever faw \ the Pinjeree^ bed and cuftuons, being embroidered and inlaid with gold. The admirals met him at the entrance of the fort, and as they were now well acquainted, they familiarly embraced him, and led him up the ftairs into the great room defigned for his reception; where he was placed between them on a feat, covered with crimfon-velvet cufhions, embroidered with gold. One very remarkable circumftance happened on this occafion •, Mr. Cohhe, at the admiral^ requeft, had put on his canonical drefs, and the Nabob perceiving that he was uncommonly attired, feemed very defirous of knowing who he, was. Upon being informed that he was the admiral's chaplain, he made him a fecond falaam, and defired much that his own Faquier * might be introduced to him:; who entered prefently afterwards, quite in the apoftolic habit. He had a kind of white cloth that went round his loins, and another of a coarfer fort flung carelefsly over one fhoulder. He had no turban, and his hair was tied in a knot behind, while his beard hung down almoft to his ■middle. He wore a fort of fandals on his feet, and loofe iron chains about his legs. But exclufive of his extraordinary habit and appearance, he had fomething very wild and ftaringfin his looks; and indeed none are admitted into this particular order, without having manlfefled fome degree of enthu- fiafm and madnefs. The two holy men congratulated each other on their refpeftive office, and then feated themfelves with the reft of the company. The Nabob was faluted by the guns of the fort; and all the officers and troops of the garrifon were under arms upon the occafion. The feveral ihips of the fquadron likewife fired, upon a certain fignal being given to them from the fort. The Nabob attentively eyed thefe laft, and 0 feemed much pleafed with the view of them, though they lay at their anchors at the diftance of at leaft three miles. Mr. Watfon gave the Nabob an invi tation to go on board the fquadron, which he at that time declined, by reafon (as we imagined) of the furf of the fea, which in general is very rough here. He defired however, that the curiofity of his generals and fome other of his grandees might be gratified with a nearer view of the (hips; accordingly, attended by fome of our officers, they went on board immediately. While ^hey were vifiting the feveral fhips of the fquadron, the Nabob took his leave of the admirals, and direded his courfe to the water-fide, where he had ordered his tents to be pitched, that he might the more conveniently dine f there, and entertain himfelf I755« l i ^ * Faquier or Fakir in the Arabian tongue fignifies a mendicant monk.

The NaM accordingly came, and paffed through the fwell m the boat, with the greateft unconcern, and after he got on board, heard the fh.p falute Uim without any furprize or emotion at the nojfe. Admiral led h m by the hand to every part of the veflel. He was very mqu.flt.ve and made manv pertinent remarks on fo vaft, fo curious and wonderful a machine- but above all other things, the lower deck battery which confifted of 28 guns, carrying balls of 32 pounds ftruck him with alto- nifhment: the admiral perceiving this, ordered the gunner to exerc.fe a few of the cannon as in the time of an engagement. 1 he Aaioi appeared oreatlv pleafed with this, and the other different montcuvres within the Slip; and afterwards retiring to the great cabbin, the admiral told him, he would now sive him a view of a man of war under fail, and accordingly threw out the Tyrsrs fignal to chace to windward. Captain Latbaniy havin^ had previous notice of the admiral's intention, immediately flipped his cable, fet his fails, and worked to windward ; and as he pafled the Kent's (tern, faluted the Nabob with his cannon. This^ added greatly to- the fatisfaftion he had before felt, and he exprefled himfelf thoroughly fcnfible of the honour that had been done him. After he had thus agree ably fpent three or four hours on board the Kent^ he moved for going afhore. Both the admirals accompanied him, and on his leaving the fhip^ the whole fquadron fired together. The yards were manned at the fame time, and the failors gave three hearty cheers. This general acclamation gave the Nabob a particular pleafure, and he ordered the interpreter ro tell the admiral it was ' truly war-like.' The admirals waited upon the Nabob to his tent, where they parted, after exchanging reciprocal profeflions of friendfhip and efteem for each other *. Upon the admirals being firft introduced to the Nabobs they were by fome perfons given to underftand, that it would be expe6ted they fliould fend in prefents, and pull off their (hoes at entering his tent. Both thefe are ftridly and truly the cuftoms ofthe Eaji, and from the earlieft ages have prevailed among the oriental nations; and the Indians always infill upon them ; but as. Mr. JVatfon reprefented his Brit tannic majefty, neither of thefe humiliating ceremonies was fubmitted to by him or his company. The prefent made upon thefe complimentary occafions is a mere triBe, for an orange or lemoi* never fails to gain admittance. Two or three Indian gentlemen coming one day on board the Kent^ they, agreeable to this cuftom, prefeated everj^ * Soon after the exchange of thefe vlfits, the author wrote an account of them to a friend ik.

But when they approach -v—■ a great perfon for a favour, it is ufual to bring prefents of the richeft and moft valuable things of the country: thus the Magi who came from the eaft to vifit our Saviour, it is faid ' opened their treafures and prefented to ' him gifts, gold and frankincenfe and myrrh.' As for the other cuftom, the pulling off the (hoes very much prevails now throughout the eaft, more particularly when the Mahometans enter their Mofques, and the Gentoos their Pagodas. Probably they derived this cuftom from the divine command given unto Mofes in the 3d chapter of the book of Exodus: ' Put off thy Ihoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou ftandeft ' is holy ground.'* Let me add, that in this country we fee as many flippers and fandals at the doors of a Pagoda, as we do hats hanging up in our churches: and your Indian fervants never even enter your room with their ftioes on, if they have a mind to fhew mafter any refped. There ftill remains another cuftom which comes properly to be noticed here, and which is very common in this country, the fending for a fet of women, who are called dancing girls, upon every joyful occafion. We engaged a fet of them upon the day the Nabob returned Mr. Watfon\i vifit. I could not fee any thing in their performance worthy of notice. Their movements are more like tumbling, or (hewing poftures, than dancing. Their drefs is thin and light, and their hair, necks, ears, arms, wrifts, finrrcrs, legs, feet, and even the toes are covered with rings of gold and filver, made after a clumfy manner. They wear two rings in their nofes, and by their Haring looks and odd gefticulations, you would rather fufped them to be mad-women than morris-dancers. The band of mufic that attends them is not lefs fingular in its way : it is chiefly compofed of three or four men, who hold two pieces of bell-metal in their hands, with which they make an incef- fant noife ; another man beats what he is pleafed to call a drum j and that they may not want vocal mufic to complete the band, there are always two others appointed to fing. Thefe laft generally lay in their mouths a good loading of beetel-nut before they begin, which after having been well- chewed, tinges the faliva with fuch a rednefs, that a ftranger would judge them to bleed at the mouth by too violent an exertion of their voice. Thefe gentry are called ¥uky-1'aw boys, from the two words Ticky Taw which they continually repeat, and which they chant with great vehemence. The dancing girls are fometimes made ufe of in their religious ceremonies; ss when the priefts bring forth the images of their gods into the open fields on a car ornamented with lafcivious figures, thefe girls dance before the images amidft a great crowd of people-,* and having been felecled for their fuperior beauty, are very profitable to their mafters the priefts, who are laid to ■* ' And David danced before the Lord with all his might, and was girded with a linnen ** ephod ; fo David and all the houfe of Ifrael brought up the ark of the Lord with Routing, 4i and with the found of the trumpet.' 2 Sam, vi. 14.

They will tell you imleed that their goi firft debauched them upon account of their beautyj and that ever after they muft remain lacred to the church. During our ftay this time at Fort St. David, a very melancholy accident happened to fome of our people, for the Kent's boat in trying to get over the bar, was overfet by the violence of the wind and furf, and a young gentleman who was a midfhipman and relation of Admiral Pvcock's, the mafter- carpenter, captain's clerk, and two other men, were unfortunately drowned. This misfortune was entirely owing to their making ufe of their own boat, inftead of the common bar-boat, which is much better calculated for this particular purpofe. I fhall finifh this chapter with a fliort account of the caufe and violent effeds of the land-wind, which in the fouthern parts of India blows for two or three hours in the morning with an heat that is almoft intolerable. As to the caufe, we may fpare ourfelves the pains of enquiry, if we only look on a map of the continent of India, and obferve, what a vaft traft of land this wind comes over, fome hundred miles of which are fand, which necefiarily muft give the wind every burning quality long before it reaches the Coromandel coaft. That this is the grand caufe of this common phoenomenon, is very manifeft whenever a fhower of rain falls at the time this land-wind prevails *, for if the wind in its way towards you, chances to pafs through the fhower, you are fure to find the air agreeably cool, even though the day be ever fo clear, and the fun fhines in its meri dian luftre •, whereas they who live only at the diftance of a few miles from you, but out of the dire&lt;5l line v/here the fhower pafled, (hall at the fame time be fainting under the ufual exceffive heat. Very many and great inconveniencies arife from thefe winds. It is affirmed with confidence, that they will fnap glafs, if too much expofed to them. I have feen them ftrrp off the fineering from a cheft of drawers, and they will certainly crack and chap almoft every wood that is not well feafoned. Another great inconvenience arifing from thefe land-winds, is the whirling of the land in one s eyes: the air is fo full of fand, that there appears a perpetual hazinefs the whole day juft above the horizon. And when thefe winds blow with more than ordinary violence, great quantities of fand may be fwept from the decks of the fhips riding in the road, though near three miles fiom the land. This abundantly convinced me of the truth of that furprizing circumftance mentioned by the ancient hiftorians, of whole armies being buried under the mountains of fand, which are fometimes railed by thefe winds *. But befides the inconveniencies I have already mentioned, thefe land- winds have another quality which deferves particular notice; and that &amp; arenarum mohbus oppreffus, imerut. J ustini, lib. i. cap ix 4 ' ' is.r 77 i is, the baneful efFe6t they have on any perfon they blow rapon^ while he is fleeping. The confequence of this is always dangerous, as it feldom fails to bring on a fit of the Barbiers f (as it is called in this country), that is, a total deprivation of the ufe of the limbs, which the patient never gets the better of till he returns to England, or is braced up by fome other climate. The method our gentlemen make ufe of to cool theif liquors, is to wrap a wet cloth round the bottle, and fet it in the land-wind. And what is very remarkable, it will cool much fooner by being expofed thus to this burning wind, than if you take the fame method, and fet it in the cold fea-breeze. 1755- f See Dr. Lind'% treadle on the difeafes incidental to Europeans in hot countries. # .

IN the morning of the 19th of Auguft 1755, we once more took our leave of Fort St. David, and the fame evening came to an anchor with the whole fquadron in Madrafs road *. At the fame time, Commodore James in the Proteftor, who commanded the company's marine force in India, and had come round to this coaft after his expedition and iuccefs againfty%™f, (com monly called the Pirate,) failed for Bombay. It being the time of the contrary monfoon, he proceeded by the fouthern pajfage which he himfelf had happily explored the year before, and accompliftied in forty days, although obliged to crofs the equinoftial line, and to advance as far as 10° 30' fouth latitude, for the advantage of having the S.

This difcovery is of important and general benefit to navi gation, Mr. Jatnes having proved the pafiage to be, in the height of the con trary monfoon, very pradlicable, and not long •, as it may be performed in little more than one of the fix months that the contrary monfoons blow on the Malabar coaft, and which till now had rendered the communication by fea between the prefidencies on the coafts of Malabar and Coromandel almolt imprafticable till the change.

We arrived at Bombay the nth of November, and found there Lieutenant-colonel Robert Clive, who had lately landed on the ifland with three companies of the king's artillery from England. He was fent out with a defi^n of afting in conjundion with the Maharattas, againft the French in the Carnatic and Bee can ; but finding that a truce had been agreed upon with that nation, and perhaps partly excited by Mr. James's late fuccefs, it was judged proper by Admiral Watfon, Mr. Bourchier Gover nor of Bombay, Colonel Clive, &amp;c. that the fea and land forces united with the Maharattas fhould attempt the deftroying Angria's piratical ftate, which was become exceedingly formidable, troublefome, and dangerous, not only to the Maharattas, who were his neighbours, but alfo to our Eaft India company, and the whole Malabar coaft. 1 he admiral imme diately informed Mr. Bourchier, that his majefty's ftiips which he had the honour to command, were in readinefs to proceed on the intended expedition, and that the fooner they entered on the bufinefs the better •, as the careening and refitting the fcjuadron would be a work of time, and more proper to be done after, than before, fuch an undertaking. But the governor not having been able to fettle every thing relative to the co operation of the Maharatta forces, and thofe of the Eaft India company; or the government of the fortrefs in cafe it fhould be taken he fent Mr. Watfon word, that all thefe preliminaries ought to be adjufted before the expedition took place, left any difpute mit^ht arife afterwards; and that from the prefent complexion of our allies, he apprehended the fettling thefe matters would take up fome time. Upon receiving this intelligence, the admiral thought fit to alter his firft plan, and accordingly ordered the whole fquadron to fail into the harbour to careen. But while the careening work was going forwards, the admiral thought proper to difpatch Commodore James with three of the companies frnps to look into Geriah, and reconnoitre the harbour and fortifications; this gentleman's diligence and fucceis in the affair cannot better be expreffed than in his own words, in a letter he fent to the admiral the day of his return from Geriah. ¥0 Charles Watfon Efqi Rear-admiral of the Red fqu-adr'on of his majefty's fleet, and commander in chief of all his majefty's Jhips and veffels m the Eaft Indies, and of the marine force of the Eaft India company. SIR, I Have the honour to inform you, that I arrived off Geriah, with the Protettov, Revenge, and Guardian under my command, on the morning of the 14th inftant; where I faw the enemies fieet, confifting of 3 three-maft 1 grabs*I ] 17-5S- grabs, 8 Icerches and 12 or 14 gallivats in the harbour, rigged and their —v—^ lails bent, with one three-maft grab having only her lower mafls rigged. — I ftood into feven fathom water, when 1 think I was within point blank ftiot of the fort, but they did not fire at us.—I was exceedingly furprized at finding the place fo widely different from what I had heard it repre- ^ented: 1 affure you, Sir, it is not to be called high, nor in my opinion ftrong; it is indeed a large mafs of buildings, and I believe the walls may be thick, but tlvat part of the works which fell under my obfervation, and which was three quarters of their circumference, is quite irregular, with round towers and long curtains in the eaftern manner, and which difcovered only thirty-two embrafures below, and fifteen above. On the weft fide of the harbour is a fine flat table land opponte the fort, and I think within gun fiiot, but I am lure within diftance for bombarding, and from whence a very good diverfion might be made, while the principal attack is carried on by the fbips, and from a hill to the fouthward of the fort. The hill is very near to, and full as high as the fort, for when we were at a confiderable diftance it hid all the fort except the top of one houfe and the flag-ftaff : it is alfo very plain from our depth of water, that the (hips can go near enough for battering, and confequently for throwing Ihells, There are alfo three fandy bays under this hill, without any furf to render the land ing difficult; the firft two are rather too near the fort, but the third is out of their line of fire—The water is deep enough for the Ihips to cover the defcent, and the hill fo acceflible as to make the getting up of cannon, &amp;c. quite eafy afterwards. There is a very large town betwixt the fort and this hill, the houfes of which are covered with Cajans, and which the inhabitants will undoubtedly abandon and deftroy upon our landing, and then fly to the fort as at nay attack of Severndroog^ in which cafe, great numbers muft be killed by the fhells, the place being fo crowded and populous that they cannot fall amifs, and many upper buildings muft of courfe be knocked down, which will occafion great diforder and confufion.—They fent out no boats while I was off the place, and to deceive them, I caufed all the fails to be furled a little before dark, and made the fignal to anchor; after which I ran out of fight in the night, fo that they are ignorant whether I proceeded to the northward or fouthward.—Several of the Gallivats had blue, or ^reen, and white pendants like the Portuguefe at their maft heads, and o^ne of them had a white flag with a red crofs in the middle, which they hauled down when I drew near.—Nothing remarkable has happened in this cruife; the Mabaratta fleet was at Severndroog on my going down and coming up. 1 fhall be happy to wait upon you to relate farther particulars^ and have the honour to be, S 1 r, Your moft humble and obedient fervant, T&gt; A .r n , w. J A M E S. Proteftor, off Bdmbay, 21 Dec. 1755. About jo[ .81 ] About ten days after Mr. Jamefs return, it being rumourM that Angria, I 755* alarrn'd at the great preparations to attack him, had in a fit of defpondency v ' refolved to invite the Portuguese to take poffeffion of Geriah, and to hoift the flag of that nation in the fortrefs, the admiral fent alfo his own firll lieutenant. Sir William Hewet Baronet, and who was a good draughtfman, in the Revenge frigate before Geriah, to obferve whether any alteration had taken place there, and with orders to afcertain as near as poffible the exafl ftate of the harbour and the fort. 'Tullagee Angria, on feeing the Revenge come to an anchor in the very mouth of his harbour, and her boat found ing all round it, gave orders to the commanders of his grabs and gallivats, fome of which he filled with combuftible matter, to pufh out, and burn Sir William Hewefs velTel, to punilh him (as he termed it) for his in- folence. His intentions however were entirely fruftrated by Sir JVilliam's judicious and fpeedy manner of executing the bufinefs he was fent upon. The heaving down and refitting the feveral (hips of the fquadron, engaged all our attention for fome time, and this important affair was attended with many unforefeen difficulties: for on our endeavouring to heave down the Kent, her careening tackle broke, fo that fhe righted fud- denly before fhe was keel out. In a few days afterwards we made the fame experiment again, but then her main-mafl gave way. This was attended with great concern and vexation, and fuch as would have been without refource, had there not been another ftick in the company's marine yard, which, after a whole month's inceffant labour upon it, furnifhed us with another main-maft. The Cumberland had been fo very leaky for a long time, it was judged expedient to bring her on the (hore, to fearch out and repair the defed. This was accordingly attempted the firfl fpring-tide, but as fhe could not be made to heel fufficiently at that time, fhe was brought off again the next tide, and foon after happily hove down by the Kent. The defeat, which had been fo long complained of, proved to be in her garboard flrake, and was effeftually repaired with much lefs trouble than was at firft apprehended. The admiral, anxious to have all his fhips ready for the fea, and apprehenfive that another accident might happen fhould he attempt again to heave down the Kent, by the advice of the proper officers, ordered her to be brought to heel on the mud, and there her bottom was cleaned to within a few drakes of the keel. The c Tyger and Salijhury hove down by each other without the leaft accident, and the Bridge- - water and King*s-fijher floop went into the company's dock. All things being at lad in readinefs for putting to f.aa council was held, at Mr. Wat fan's particular defire, between the fea and land officers, . __ . 1 both of his majefty's forces, and thole of the Eaft India company, with a view of obviating any difficulties that might arife in regard to the proper diftribution of prize-money, fhould the intended expedition be crowned with fuccefs. It was fettled at this council, that Admiral Watfm, as com mander in chief of the king's fquadron, fhould have two thirds of one eighth of the whole j and Rear-admiral one third of one eighth. M Lieutenant-[ 82 ] 75^- Lieutenant-Colonel Clive and Major Chambers were to fliare equally with the captains of the king's fhips. The captains of the company's fhips, and armed veflels, and captains of the army, were to have an equal lhare with the lieutenants of the men of war. The fubaltern officers of the army, and lieutenants of the company's armed fhips and vefTels, were to have the fame diftribution as the warrant-officers of the navy, &amp;c. Thefe articles however had fcarcely been agreed upon in Council, before Colonel Clivei who commanded in chief on fhore, paid a vifit to Mr. lVatfon y and acquainted him, that the army was not fatisfied with the terms on which he, as their commander in chief, was to fhare; and that to make thofe gentlemen eafy, who were to ferve under him, he found himfelf under the difagreeable neceffity of remonftrating, and requiring that, as commander of the army, he might be entitled to a more honourable di- vifion. The argument the gentlemen of the army went upon, was, that tho' Mr. Clive^ by virtue of the commiffion he bore in common of lieutenant- colonel, could claim but an equal fhare with a captain in the navyj yet on this occafion, being commander in chief of the army, he ought certainly to be particularly diftinguiffied, and be admitted, at lead, to fhare with yix. Focock, the fecond !ea-officer, who was a Rear admiral. Mr. Watfon replied, that it was impoffible for him to' make any alterations in the articles agreed upon in council-, neither indeed would his doing it be at all confiftent either with cuftom, or the different ranks which Admiral Pocock and Colonel Clive bore in the refpective fervices: He told the colonel however, that to fatisfy the wiffies of the army, which in the prefent fitua- tion ot affairs, he deemed to be a point of the utmoft confequence, he would give fecunty under his own hand, to make good the deficiency, out of any monies he himfelf might be entitled to, fo as to make the ihare of the commander in chief of the army and that of Mr. Pocock exaflly alike. he colonel, fenfibly ftruck with Mr. JVatfon\ difintereftednefs, anfwered, that provided his officers were fatisfied with the propofal, he for his own part fnould come into it with great chearfulnefs. He accordingly took the hrit opportunity of making thole gentlemen acquainted with the admiral's de claration, who were lo much'pleafed therewith, that from that moment all dif- content ceafed, and the expedition went on with the greateft unanimity *. &lt;^ TI ' e , tr00 P s ' confift ing of about 700 Europeans, 300 Topaffes, and 300 Sepoys, being put on board the king's, and company's Ihipf, ke whole to 'th^'articies r ^r«d^Don'^'n a ^n and the money taken there had been dlfiributed aeeording pounds at lead, was due from Admiral S Colond «.. confi&lt;lerabl «''«■&gt;. a thoa ^ admiral prefentlv fent rhi's f„m w , Colonel Chve upon this account.

Cap- v —-v-— tain Martin with his majefty's fhip the Bridgewater^ and King's-fijher floop ; and the ProteRor and two 20 gun fhips belonging to the company, which the admiral had difpatched in January to block up the port. The Maha- ratta fleet were alfo here, confifting of 3 or \ grabs^ and 40 or 50 of their fmaller veflels, or gallivats. They lay to the northward of Geriah, in a creek called Raja-pore, the fmall fort of which, they had taken from Angria juft before our arrival. This fleet was commanded by Nari-Punf. The Maharattas had alfo aflembled an army, confifting of about 5 or 6000 horfe, and the fame number of foot, who were under the command of Ramajee-Punt, another of their general-officers: this laft came on board the Kent to pay his refpeds to Admiral JVatfon •, fome guns were fired on the occafion ; and the admiral, to do him the greater honour, con duced him in perfon to the feveral parts of the fhip, but at the fight of its batteries he appeared greatly aftonifhed. The very fame day we arrived before Geriah, the admiral fummoned the fort to furrender. He received for anfwer, ' That the garrifon were well apprized of the force he brought with him ; but if, agreeable to the fum- mons he had fent, he was refolved to be mafter of the fort, he muft take it by force, for they were refolved to defend themfelves to the laft extremity.' The next morning, however, feveral of Angria's relations, accompanied by fome officers of Ramajee-Punt's army, came on board, in order, as they pretended, to take a view of the fquadron ; but their real bufinefs was to found the admiral in regard to his final determinations. They had before waited upon the Maharatta general on the fame errand. Mr. Wat [on gave orders for their feeing the fhip, and afterwards told them to acquaint An gria, that he once more demanded a furrender of the fort; and that if he would give it up peaceably- and with a good grace, before any hoftilities commenced, he, his family and people might depend upon his protedion. In reply to this offer of the admiral, they earneftly intreated him to con tinue with his fhips where they then lay, and promifed in a few days to return again to him with an anfwer. But the admiral, having been fur- nifhed with demonftrative proofs from the obfervations made by thofe who had reconnoitered the port, and by Commodore James's venturing to go one night in the Protestor's barge fo far as to bring the flag-ftaff to bear S. W. which is within the fort, where he found not lefs. than three and a half fathom water, (fufficient depth for the large fhips to go in); he told them, he would not wait one moment, but on that very day, as foon as the fea-breeze would permit, he was determined to fail into the harbour, and there, and there only, would he treat. At the lame time he gave them his word, that unlefi the fort fired firft on his fhips, while they were under fail, he would not commence hoftilities, nor before he had received an anfwer from Angria \ giving them to underftand however, that he fhould not wait a great while for this anfwer, and that at all events he was determined to make himfelf mafter of the place. And as an earneft of his fixed refolu- M 2 tion[ 84 ] i75^* tion In this laft particular, he ordered that a thirty-two pound ball fliould be put into their hands, which he defired them to carry as a prefent to their mailer, and then difmified them. Between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, the fquadron weighed anchor, and ftood in with a light breeze, in two columns, for Geriah har bour. The outfide column was led by the King*s-jijher floop. Captain Henry Smith. * The Bridgewater, Captain Martin, led the line of battle fhips, con- filling of t\\Q Tyger, LathamKent, Admiral JVatfon, and Captain, Speke \ Cumberland, Admiral Pocock, and Captain John HarrifonSalijhury, Captain Thomas Knowler ; and the Protehor, Commodore James, and Captain Morgan, a (hip of 44 guns belonging to the Eafi India company. By which wile difpofiiion, according to the orders f which the admiral ifTued, each line of battle fhip covered a bomb-ketch, and protected the column of fmaller veflels from the fire of the enemy. The Drake, Warren, Triumph, Viper, and Difpatch bomb-vefiels, were under the direction of Captain Tovey, of his maiefty's train of Artillery; and the Maharatta gal- livats and other fmall veffels formed a third line out of gun-fhot. The engagement began about two, by the enemy firing on the King's-* fijher-, which fhe and the Revenge foon returned. In lefs than a quarter of an hour, being ftill under fail, the admiral made the general fignal to engage. Soon after that, the Revenge anchored, as did alfo the Kent, and the other fhips of the Iquadron. But the Tyger having done this, without the admiral's perceiving her fignal, for he had ordered each Ihip to make a fignal on her coming to anchor, the Kent fell on board her, carried * On the death of Captain Mighel in 175 5, Admiral Wat/en's firft lieutenant, Mr. John Har* rifon fucceeded to the command of the King's-jijher ; but on Mr. Pococi's hoifting his flag.

The two fhips how- 175^0 ever loon got clear of each other, and then the engagement began with vio-or. After an incefiant fire had been kept up againft the fort for about half an hour, the admiral fent orders to the Revenge and Guardian to ceafe from firing, for he plainly perceived that their fhot fell fhort; and at the fame time he gave the fignal to the Tyger and Salifhury to direfl their whole fire ao;ainft the north-eaft baftion. Soon after this, a fhell fortunately fet fire to the Refloration-grah, which had formerly been taken by Angria from our Eaft India company; and flie driving among the reft of the enemy's fhip- ping, which were lafhed together, fet them all in flames j fo that in a few hoiirs almoft the whole of yf^nVs fleet was deftroyed. The fire alfo was communicated to a large fhip lying on the fhore, and from her to feveral fmaller veflels that were building; and from thefe laft it was conveyed to the arfenal, ftorehoufe, fuburbs, and city, and even to feveral parts of the fort, particularly to a fquare tower, where it continued burning all the night with fuch violence, that the ftone walls appeared like red-hot iron. About half after four in the afternoon, the admiral perceiving that the enemy's guns were almoft filenced, made the fignal for the fquadron alfo to leave off firing •, and taking the advantage of the tide, which was now at its height, he ordered the fhips which had been thrown a little out of the line by the before-mentioned accident, to warp in nearer the fort into four fa thom water, clofe to Admiral Pocock in the Cumberland^ who, contrary ta the advice of his pilot, had, in ftanding in, ventured as near as the fhips which drew much lefs water, and by a very judicious and officer-like ma noeuvre in bringing his fhip up by an anchor droptfrom one of the gun-room ports, prevented her fwingingwith the flood-tide and fea-breeze which fet right in. In a fhort time after, the enemy having again brifkened their fire, the admiral made the proper fignal for the fquadron to do the fame. This had fuch an effed, that at half paft fix the enemy's fire was entirely filenced which the admiral obferving, he again gave orders to ceafe from firing. At half after feven. Colonel Clive, with the troops under his com mand, left the fhips, in order to land at the moft convenient place to the eaftward of the fort; and at about a quarter after nine, the Colonel made two falfe fires, to fhew that he was fafely landed, and that the troops which had been obferved on the hill were our Maharatta allies. The homh-veffels continued throwing fhells into the fort till day-light, when the admiral ordered all the line of battle fhips to warp in as clofe as poffible, that they might be ready to batter in breach as foon as he Ihould throw out the fignal •, and in that cafe he commanded them to make ufe of their lower deck guns only, unlefs their upper ones fhould afterwards be found neceflary to filence any fire which might chance to be made by the enemy. An officer was then fent with a flag of truce to the governor, and with a fecond fummons to furrender the fort. He foon came back with the governor's refufal; upon which all the fhips immediately warped within a cable's length.of the fort in three fathom and a quarter water, and the fignal was thrown out to renew the attack. 4 ThisIHIIIHlmi II lUlHULl—M— mmmMeaeHHHBBBMSESi [ 86 ] 1756. This was done with To much fpirit, that about two o'clock a magazine in the feu blew np, and about four, a flag was hung out as a fignal of fub- mifllon. Upon this the^ admiral fent Lieutenant Richard King to demand an immediate entrance into the fort for the king's troops, and that the B?itijh flag (liould oc hoifted on one of the baftions. A little before five, the lieutenant returned with an account, that the governor confented to the holding colours, that he was willing to admit five or fix of oiw men that evening, and that the enfuing morning he would furrender the place. This anlwer not being deemed latisfa^lory, we once more renewed our fire •, but at a quarter after five, they again thought proper to hang out the flag of capitulation, and all hoftilities ceafed. Colonel Clive, who, from the time he difembarked with the troops, had been making his approaches by land, and had greatly annoyed the enemy with his cannon, then came on board the admiral's fhip, bringing with him an officer fiom the fort with articles of capitulation. Thefe were prefently agteed to by the two admirals and colonel; and an JLngliJh officer was fent in to take poifeffion of the fort, and to hoift Englijh colours. Prefently aiterwards the Captains Forbes and Buchanan were detached with fixty men to fee the garrilon lay down their arms; and on the 14th, at fun-rifing, the colonel and the whole army marched into the place *.

Upon his entering their houfe, the whole family made a grand Jalaam, or reverential bending of their bodies, touching the very ground with their faces, and fhedding floods of tears. The admiral defired them to be comforted-, adding, ' that they were now under his protedion; and that no kind of injury fhould be done them.' They then again made the falaam.^ The mother of Angria, though ftrongly affeded with thefe teftimonies of goodnefs and humanity, yet could not help crying out, ' that the people had no king, fhe no fon, her daughters no hufband, the children no father!' The admiral replied, ' that from henceforward they muft look upon him as their father and their friend.' Upon which the youngeft child, a boy of about fix years old, fobbing faid, ' Then you JJoall he my father-' and immediately took the admiral by the hand, and called him 'father.' This adion of the child's was fo very affeding, it quite overpowered that brave, that good man's heart, and he found him- felf under a neceffity of turning from the innocent youth for a while, to prevent the falling of thofe tears,, which itood ready to gufh from liis eyes *. Mr. Watforts intention was to have taken the whole family with him to Bombay, and to have fettled them at that place; and they appeared at firfl: to be greatly pleafed with the propofal, for above all things they dreaded being put into the hands of the Maharattas. But this intention of the admiral's was never put in execution •, for afterwards, at their own requeft, he permitted them to remain in Geriah. They probably were ordered, by fome letter or meffage they received from Angria himfelf, before the fqua- dron left the place, to alk this favour of the admiral. Tullages Angria was an arbitrary, cruel tyrant, making his own imperi ous will the only rule of his government. He was originally tributary to the Serajah ; but finding himfelf very powerful, he had for a long time fhook off all fubjedion, and had treated fome ambaffadors fent to him from that prince, to put him in mind of his duty, with great infolence ; flitting their nofes, and commanding them to go and tell their mailer, that he would fend him his pr—te pa—ts to treat with him. On his quitting his principal fortrefs of Geriah (as before related) he repaired to Puna, the capital city of the Maharattas, and made his fubmiflion to the Nanah, who pardoned him, but upon what terms could never be exactly known. It was conjectured however, and with great probability, that he difcovered to this prince the place where he had hidden his treafure •, for it cannot be fuppofed that fo notorious an offender as he had been, would have dared to have thrown himfelf at his fovereign's feet, unlefs he had it in his power in a pecuniary way (the only way then left him) to atonS for his, paft behaviour. And what ftrengthens the fufpicion is, our finding only * An account of the conqueft of Geriahs and of this afFe£ling fcene, was fent by the author to a friend in England, who foon publifned it in one of the niOiithly magazines. iOOOOO L \[ 88 ] 6. iooooo/. in money after the capture of Gmab,. which could not be the tenth part of what he really pofieffed. The annexed views of the fort, harbour, and country round it, were taken by the late Captain Northai on the fpot with the utmoft exaclnefs; and to Sir William Hewefs and Com modore James's reports, Mr. Watfon always acknowledged himfelf greatly obliged; and Mr. James had the latisfaftion to receive the public thanks of the admiral after the reduction of the fort. The harbour of Geriah is fo exceedingly commodious, as to make it the beft upon the coalt; and the fort was fo ftrong both by art and nature at the time we attacked it, that it might have held out a long time againft all our efforts, had it been defended with any tolerable degree of fkill and refolution. The Europeans that were found in Geriah, and relieved from flavery, were, Mr. Rohin Maund, Durce, Jacob BuJJy, Garret Blough, Abraham Paenick — — Dutch. Before I entirely quit .the account of our tranfa6lions at this place, I tnuft not omit to obferve, that a young gentleman of the fquadron found a Mahomedan 1'alifman in Angria's own houfe, of which he was fo obliging as to make me a prefent. As I wifhed to have it explained, I put it Into the hands of S\v James Foulis Baronet, major and commander in chief of the company's forces at Bombay, a gentleman diftinguiftied for his learning and Ipeculative turn of mind, from whom I afterwards received a letter an extrad: of which I fhall make no fcruple to lay before the reader. ^ C0 ?

ON the 19th of February 1756, the Tyger was difpatched to Bombay with the fick and wounded of the fquadron; and On the 17th of March, Admiral Watfon in the Kent, came to an anchor in Bombay harbour; as did Admiral Pocock in the Cumberland the day following. On the 27th of April, Mr. Watfon with his fquadron left Bombay, and once more failed for the Corcmandel coaft. We touched at Geriah in our way, and on the 14th of May got to Fort St. David's road. Soon after our arrival here, the admiral had the fatisfa6tion to receive letters from the Secre tary of State, and from the Admiralty, acquainting him that his majefty had been pleafed to comply with his requeft of quitting the Eaft Indies, and directing him, whenever that event happened, to refign the command of the fquadron to Rear-admiral Pocock. The heat of the climate had, ever fince his firfb arrival, been greatly diftrefsful to Mr. Watfon, whole confti- tution was fanguine, and whofc habit was rather corpulent. The permiffion therefore he now had of quirting the fervice, could not fail of being agreeable to him, and he pleafed himfelf with the expedation of failing back to Europe in tlie month of OSiober. This fair profpefl was foon clouded, however, by the difagreeablc intelligence which the governor and council of Madrafs at this time fent to him, and which they juil before had received from the dire&lt;5lors of the Eaft India company. The purport of it, was, that 3000 regular troops had embarked from France in fix fhips of the line, and in the fame number ot large veffels belonging to their Eaft India company ; and that thefe lafl', as N ' ibonr 9® ] 1756. foon as they arrived at the ifland of Mauritius, were to be converted imo ' fhips of war. With this account, orders were laid to have been alfo fent from England to the prefidency at Fcrt St. George \ ' To Jland well on their guard, and to do their heft to protefi and defend them [elves again ft the threat-, ening power of France.' An exprefs was foon difpatched. with thefe tidings to Admiral Watfon, defiring him above all things to have a watchful eye on the proceedings of the French at Pondicherry. The news flew like lightning into every quarter, and different perfons argued very differently upon it. Many concluded, that the intelligence fent by the directors was ill founded, becaufe the fame fhip that brought the alarming account, had brought alfo letters from Lord Holdernejfe, one of his majefty's principal Secretaries of State, who wrote not a fyllable on the fubjefh This filence of his lorcjfhip on a matter of fo. much confequence was very ftriking-, yet as there was a poffibility that the directors in this inftance might be furnifhed with better intelligence than the Secretary of State, Admiral from this moment gave over all thoughts cf foon leaving the Indies for however agreeable it was to him, he could* not think of taking fuch a ftep, at a time when fo heavy a cloud was faid to be juft ready to burft on our moft important fettlements in that part of the world. So predominant in his breaft was the fpirit of patriotifm, and; the love of glory, that though folicited to return home by every allurement of domeftic felicity, he waved all thefe confiderations, and refolved ftill to expofe himfelf to the hazards of a, climate, peculiarly fraught with , danger and difeafe. It was foon determined between him and the gentlemen of. the prefidency, that in every department we ought to be prepared to receive the French m the moft effedual manner. For this purpofe the two admirals, and all the officers of the fquadron left their houfes, and repaired on board their fhips, where they lived tor the fpace of fix weeks, caufing a good look out to be kept for the enemy from their mafts heads. At the fame time, to increafe the alarm, the gentlemen of the French nation refidenc in India, very induf- trioudy and politically reported, and wLich report was echoed by our good friends the Butch, that this formidable armament from France was adually anived in xhz Indian feas. I his pofitive aflertion ferioufly affefted the government at Madrafs, who immediately requeued the admiral, to take on board his Iquadron the king's regiment then at Fort St. David, and With it repair to the prefidency. The admiral with great reluftance quitted fort St.. David, as he knew it was upon all accounts the propercft ftation for intercepting the French fleet, and for counteraaing any defigns which the enemy might have formed againft our fettlements But as he did not chufe to have any difpures with the prefidency, he immediately took Colonel ^w&lt;&gt;»s regiment on board, and failed with it to MaJrafs, where he purchafed a veflH for the king's fervice, and after having converted her 4 into wm[ 9 1 ' ] mto a fire-fliip under the name of the Blaze, he appointed to the command of her, his firft lieutenant, Mr. Richard King. ' ' On our arrival ixMadrafs, we had the fatisfadion to find the aclive and fpirit- ed Governor Pigot, at the head of a great number of artificers and labourers, making incredible additions to the fortifications of the place, hardly allow ing himfelf time to take any refrefhment, and fhewing by his own example, that it was poffible for men, in times of imminent danger, to expofe their perfons in the hotteft hours of the day, and in the snoft lultry leafon of the year. juft before the account of this armament from Europe reached our ears, the Nabob of Golconda had quarrelled with the French general Monf Eujfy, who for a long time had been preying on the vitals of his country. 1 he Nabob had made overtures to the leading men of our prefidency for their amding him in getting rid of fo troublefome a gueft, and they with pleafure had liltened to the propofal. Nothing indeed prevented their luccouring him at this time, but their own fuppofed danger from the formidable French armament which was loon expected to arrive upon the coaft. The apprehenfion of this made fo ftrong an impreffion on their minds, that for fome time they appeared more folicitous about defending themfelves, than of fending any effectual fupport to their new ally. At length, however, two (hips belong- in^ to the company arrived from England ; and as they failed the lateft in the feafon, and brought with them no kind of confirmation of the firft alarming intelligence, every one immediately concluded that it never had the leaft foundation. A detachment of troops therefore, and a train of artillery, were ordered to be gotten ready to march with all expedition for the kingdom of Golconda i a country of vaft opulence, the fource of thole amazino- fums which the famous jMonf. F)u.pleix and his countrymen had amaffed together, and from whence indeed all their importance was derived. ( But before thefe troops could be fent away, an exprefs arrived from o-^/with the diiagreeable account of our fort at Cajfmhuzar, near Muxadabad, being taken by the new Nabob, Serajah al Dowlah, who was a compound of temerity, cruelty, ambition, and avarice: he was particularly incenfed at Mr. Drake the Englijh governor of Calcutta, under the pretence of his having given prote6tion to fome of his offending fubje6ts j) but his attack of the Englijh lettlements, certainly proceeded from the hopes of confiderable plunder, added to the defire of impreillng his fubje6ls with an awe of his military talents and prowefs. Inftead of marching with the great army he had raifed, into xht Purhunean country, as he firft intended, we were informed he had turned his arms againft us, and was expe6led foon to appear before the gates of lort William in Calcutta. Thefe unfortunate tidings gave us all great concern and fcarcely were the firft tranfports of our chagrin abated, before another N 2 difpatch[ 92 1 7&gt;c 5. ^ifpatch arrived with the news of his having taken Calcutta, and of the dread* ' ful tragedy which happened in the Black hole prifon *. This was fuch a blow as filled us all with inexpreflible confternation; and was enough indeed to /hake the credit of our Eaft India company to its very foundations; for hereby they loft their principal fettlement in Bengal, and a fort which fecured to them the moft valuable part of their commerce. Here I cannot help refleding- on the fatal effects of that piece off intelligence already mentioned, which too haftily reached us, from the diredors of the Eajl India company. Had we at the firft arrival of our fquadron from Bombay on the coaft, been at liberty to a6l, inftead of being fixed to a certain fpot, no doubt but the greateft advantages would have enfued. Our troops would inevitably have marched into the kingdom of 1 ' Golconda, as auxiliaries to Salabadjing the Nabob of that country, and in all probability would have made themlelves mafters of all the ftrong -holds the French poflefTed there; Bujfy's retreat would infallibly have been cut off, and Frenchman there muft have fallen into our hands-f. The fqua- dron, in this cafe, would likewife have failed to Mafulipatnam, and there have feized upon a fhip from Pondicherry with 400 troops on board, under the command ot Mr. Law, intended as a reinforcement for Monf. Bujfy, Thus our countrymen would have firmly eflabliihed themfelves in one of the richeft provinces of India-, the fpot, which had been the caufe of all the jealoufy between us and the French, and the original fource of all the troubles which had arifen in this part of the world : And that detachment of our troops, which muft have been in the country of Golconda, at the time the melancholy account reached us of our lofies in Bengal, would have been fo far advanced in their way to the relief of the^r diltrefled country, men; with this additional advantage, that Salabadjing, being then in alli ance with us, would probably have joined our forces with a body of his own-, by which means our company's affairs would much fooner have been t ^ an were ' t ^ e te ^' l0Lls vo yage we afterward had from Madrafs to Bengal, prevented; and perhaps our worthy admiral and other galiant men, who died there through the inclemency of the weather, might have eft the river before the exceffive heats and rains fet in, and have been now alive and happy with their refpedive families in Great Britain. But fuch a train of fortunate events, heaven thought not fit to permit! and it would but ill become us to find fault with its difpenfations, however we may be allowed to fympathize in the affiidions of our countrymen and t This was afterwards effeaed under the command of the gallant Colonel ^ ' ' Many[ 93 % fint Many were the opinions that prevailed in India, concerning the difafter at Calcutta ; let it fuffice to obferve, that the conduft of the governor was univerfally blamed in abandoning the fort fo precipitately-, while the cou rage and refolution of Mr. Holwell, who, with the afliftance of a few gallant officers and a feeble garrifon, defended it for feveral days after the other had left it, could not fail of being much applauded. There were perfons however at Calcutta, who would not allow any fliare of praife to be due to thefe gentlemen; for they infifted, that their having defended the fort, was a matter of necefTity, not of choice-, and that both Mr. Holwell and. his officers would have followed the governor on board the Ihipsj had there been any boats left to carry them off. By the lofs of the two forts at Cajfmhuzar and Calcutta, the Englijh Eaft India company's affairs were reduced fo low, that nothing but the gallantry, and fortitude of a JVatfon, and the magnanimity and good fortune of a Clive, could poffibly have retrieved them.) A plan of operations was im mediately concerted between the company's principals, and thefe two brave and worthy officers, for, reftoring the company's affairs in Bengal, recovering Qalcutta, and taking ample vengeance on the Barbarian, who had exercifed fuch horrid cruelties on many of our unhappy countrymen. The necef- fary flores and implements of war, were fcarcely embarked, when a veflel arrived from the Malabar coaft, which brought a packet for the admiral, containing acommiffion appointing him vice-admiral of the blue*, and- orders for him to, return to England with the fquadron under his command. Mr. Watfon immediately called on his faithful counfellors and friends. Admiral Poccck, Captain Speke, and his fecretary Mr. Doidge, to confult with them what was proper to be done in fo critical a conjuncture -, and it appearing to them, as it had before to the admiral, that the miaiflry in England, when they fent thefe orders for his return, could not poffibly forelee the dreadful event which had fo lately happened at jtegv?/; they- unanimoufly agreed, not only that the admiral fhould poftpone his own departure tor Europe, but alfo that of the fquadron, until the company's affairs fliould be put upon a better footing than they were at prefent. The admiral then fignified his defire to the governor and feled committee at Fort St. George, to meet them in council, in order to communicate to them the contents of his packet. When they were affembled, he acquainted them with the tenor of his late orders. On which the committee, quite confounded, declared with great ferioufnefs and concern, that the company mufb be totally ruined, unlefs the king's fhips immediately proceeded to * And Tome time after, Mr. Watjhn .was made Vicc-adrairal of the White, but he did not live to receive the commiffioD.

Jc was therefore reiblved, that the whole fquadron fhould proceed as far as the mouth of the Ganges^ and anchor in Ballafare road, when the company's fhips and veflels already in the river, (hould fall down where the fquadron lay, and receive the troops from the Ihips of war. The Salijburyy Bridge-water^ and Kings-fi]her, were defigned to be put under the command of Captain William Martin, to carry on the expedition again ft the Nahoh \ for it was then looked upon as a certainty that the Kent, Cumberland, and tfyger, could not be got over the Braces *. Another delay and matter of debate, was, what force fhould be fent to Bengal, and who fhould command the military ; fometimes Colonel Adlercron, and fometimes Colonel Clive, was thought to be the moft proper perfon •, at lafl they determined on Colonel Clive, and indeed the general voice of our country men was in his favour.- Another fubjedt of the governor and council s confultations, was, concerning whofe hands the affairs of the company in Bengal ought to be placed in, provided fuccefs fhould attend the expedition. At one time it was determined, that the prefidency here fhould fend three of its own members in the fhips to Bengal, who were to ad; in obedience to the orders they were to receive from this place; it being agreed that the governor and council of Fort St. George ought now, until the pleafure of the Eafi India diredtors fhould be known, to take on themfelves the manage ment of this diflblved, but once independent fettlement. However, Mr. Watfon in particular, having ftrongly oppofed this refolution, and declared (as I have been informed by his fecretary) that he would not undertake the expedition on any other terms, than having it in his power to deliver the fettlement to the management of fuch as were appointed by the com pany to be their reprefentatives in that province •, after many debates, it was refolved that the former governor and council fhould be reilored to their refpedtive honour and ftations *, and it is principally to the admiral's interpofition on this critical occafion, that thefe gentlemen are indebted for their fubfequent good fortune and unexpeded affluence. But the greateft difficulty that prefented itfelf was the late feafon of the year; for the monfoon was now let in, and there was a necefHty for the fquadron's getting to Bengal againft it, which was confidered as very near imprafticable. We were given to nnderfland, that fhips failing at this feafon from Madrafs to Ball afore, were obliged to fland over to the eaftern fide of the bay, and that the currents generally proved lo flrong againft them, that whilft they were looking out by their reckoning for the coaft of Pegu, they had often, to their great aftonifhment, found themfelves driven again on the coaft of Ccrcmandel ; and after (landing over a lecond time in the fame manner, and • Dangerous (hoals at the entrance of the Ganges, in the way up to Fulta. looking ipr[ 95 J looking out for the eaftern fhore, they had been carried to the fouthward as I 75^ far as the ifland ot Ceylon, and then, for want of provifions, had been obliged to bear away for the Malabar coaft *. The admiral however, put ting great confidence in the ftrength of his fhip, and the dexterity of Captain Speke, who was much acquainted with thefe leas,, relblved to try this- difficult experiment, in order to lave the company from ruin; and having difpatched. xhz King's-fi/her to Bengal, with intelligence to our countrymen^ that affiftance would foon be fent to them, he on the 16th of Ottober failed' from Madrafs with his whole fquadron, and feveral of the company's Ihips, for Ballaferd' road in the mouth of iht Ganges -f. The time the fquadron weighed from Madrafs, was precifely the feafon when the currents fet ftrongeft out of the bay of Bengal, fuppofed to be occafioned by the heavy rains which fall in that kingdom during the months of July, Auguji, and September, and which about this time difcharge them- felves into the fea from the numerous branches of the great nvtv Ganges. 1 he winds too at this feafon J being either faint or very, ftormy, the admiral determined to pufh over to . the eaftern fhore; but foon had the mortifica tion to find, that in fpite of all his efforts to the contrary, his fquadron, by the force of the current, was driven down as far as Ceylon, although by our - reckonings it appeared that we had gained fome degrees of longitude to the eaftward.. A few days afterwards we had frefh gales from the north-eaft, and in the night one. of the fhips made the fignal of diftrefs; upon which the admiral bore down towards her, and found .it to be the Salijhury, that had fprung a dangerous leak, and could not poflibly keep company with the fquadron-, the admiral therefore was obliged to lay to all night and part' of the next day to aflift her. As the leak was in her bow, they were obliged to bring the fhip by the ftern, by moving her guns and other things aft, that the leak might be brought out of the water. In this they partly iucceeded, and flopped the leak with oakum j but as this was not ocraBC In what is called the latter pafiage from the coafts of Malabar and Coromandel during the^ months^ ot Qflober and November, in order to^ make a quick paffage it is neceifary to go as - jar to tne iouthvyard as 5 degrees, or 4. 0 30' north latitude, where you will find fouth-wefterly winds, which will carry you to the Nicobar iflands, and fometimes quite up to the Andaman:, ?om which iflands, in fhaping a courfe toward Ballafore rozdy. or to the entrance of the anges, a point of the conipafs, ihould be allowed, for a very ftrong current which fets to the Aracan Ihore.'

Extrafl from Captain King'j minuUs. effedual,'.[ 9^ ] effectual the admiral left it to Captain Martin's choice, either to bear away for the ifland of Ceylon, or try to pufti on with the rett of the fquadton. Captain Martin knowing that his (hip had been particularly fixed upon for eoin^ up the Ganges, and that he had more than 200 ot the king sand company's troops on board, thought his quitting the fquadron might be a fort of check on the fuccefs of the whole expedition} he therefore refolved to proceed, as long at leaft as he could do it with any degree of fafety to the mens lives. The monfoon this year was uncommonly tempeftuous, which made it a long time before we got to the eaftern part of the bay •, at length however, by great perfeverance and unwearied induitry, the whole fquadron reached one of the mouths of the Ganges: but our arrival there being in the middle of the night, we were obliged to come to an anchor, not knowing exactly where we were-, and when the day came on, we had the mor tification to find ourfelves off the Palmira, or Palm-tree point, and could eafiJy difcern an immenfe fand-bank ftretching far to the northward of u.s. Some of our fhips falling to leeward, had a very narrow efcape-, the Cumberland, Admiral Pocock, ftruck the ground, but fortunately got off again without receiving much damage. Two days after this, the Kent and Tyger reached the road of Ballafore, but the other fhips could not weather the point. Admiral Pocock, atter feveral fruitlefs efforts, and being in want of provifions, was obliged to bear away for Vizagapatnam, and the Salijbury, after being toffed about for fome time at fea, and her whole crew, both officers and common men, put to an allowance of a purfer's quart of water a day, was in great danger of perifhing for want of common necef- faries ; but at laft, by the perfeverance of her captain, and a kind provi dence, fhe got into Ballafore road, and afterwards proceeded over the lands to join the Admiral at Fulta. As foon as the 7^/arrived in Ballafore road, two Englifb pilots came on board us, who gave the admiral a farther account of the miferable fitua- tion ot affairs in Bengal-, as, that fince the redudion of Calcutta, almoft every inhabitant who furvived the attack of the place, or the dreadful cataftrophe oi the B'ack-hole prifon, had made their efcape to Fulta, a defpicable village on the river's fide ; that fome families lived in rents on fhore, while others continued on board the fame (hips and veffels in which they had efcaped from Calcutta. In fhorr, they reprefented the deplorable ftate in which the ladies as well as gentlemen were, in fo pathetic a manner, that the admiral was greatly aftected with the relation, and determined to pufh on imme diately to their relief. He was thoroughly fenfible indeed, that no time was to be loll, becaufe he was informed that the Nabob was then raifmg feveral additional batteries on purpofe to obftrutft his paffage. Me therefore conlulted the two pilots, whether the Kent and Tyger, at the moil favourable time 01 the tide, could poffibly pais the Braces ; they[ 97 ] both hefitated very much in their anfwers; but at .laft the admiral, biaflTed by the enterprizing fpirit and found judgment of Captain Speke, who had been in the river feveral times before, came to a refolution of making the attempt; which we happily fucceeded in, though not without great rifk to the fhips in pufiling through the fhoals, for through them, and not entirely over them, we forced our way *. On the 14th of December we had the fatisfadlion to arrive at Fulta, where we had the pleafure of meeting Captain King, who being fick at Madrafs ' when the fquadron failed, was left behind but, eager for a&lt;5lion, before he was quite recovered, had taken his paffage in the Protefior, one of the com pany's fhips, commanded by Captain England, who was ordered to Bengal with Sepoys, to reinforce the troops under Colonel Clive -f. Captain King's fhip the Blaze (commanded in his abfence by Lieutenant Peter Porter, an excellent but unfortunate officer, and who was afterwards killed in the expedition againft Manilla) having been obliged to bear away for Bombay, and not joining the fquadron afterwards, the captain ferved on board the Kent as a volunteer; and this unlucky incident reduced his fhare of prize-money, in confequence of our viftories in the Ganges, 10000/. lefs than otherwife it would have been. The reader may better conceive than I exprefs, what welcome vifitors wc were to our diftreffed countrymen at Fulta ; who, aftep having lived in the moft affluent circumftances, were now funk down to a condition that fcarcely afforded them common neceflaries. The cup of affliflion is always bitter, but has the tafte of gall itfelf, when it fuddenly fucceeds a ftate of opu lence. To fink at once into the loweft poverty from an eafy fortune; and from a condition that drew refpe6t from others, to be reduced to one too often attended with derifion and contempt; are circumftances that quicken the fenfe of mifery, and make misfortunes more intolerable. This was exadly the cafe of the prefent unhappy fufferers; they had fuftained fome figure in the world ; they had kept a generous and hofpitable table, where the friend and the ftranger had tafted of the elegancies of life; but now, by a fudden reverfe of fortune, were themfelves obliged to defcend to the moft fervile offices, and to be dependent on the commiferation of others for a precarious fubfiftence. They were crowded together in the moft wretched habitations, clad in the meaneft apparel, and for almoft five months had been furrounded by ficknefs and difeafe, which made ftrange havoc among them; and yet, when we faw them firft, to our great fur- prize, they appeared with as chearful countenances, as if no misfortunes had happened to them. This ferenity of theirs was certainly in great * In the year 1769 the Lord Holland, one of the company 's Ihips, was loft on thefe Jhoals. f The ProteSlor failed the 29th of Ofteher, thirteen days after the fquadron, and arrived tw» ilays before us, by purfuing the track before mentioned, ' O meafurcr : •••swa :[ 98 ] meafure owing to the pleafing hopes they now entertained of a fpeedy deliverance from their afflidlions: though fome little fhare of it might alfo be imputed to their having been fo long difciplined in the fchool of ad- verfity, as to make them kifs the rod, and in the true fpirit of chrif- tianity 'chearfully fubmit themfelves to the difpenfations of that benevo- lent Being, who, for wife and good reafons, had laid the burthen upon them. From thefe reflexions, to which the fubjecfl infenfibly led me; I fhall now proceed to our operations for their relief. The third day after our arrival at Fulta the admiral lent the following fpirited letter to the Nahh, ©n the behalf of his injured countrymen.

On the 27th ot December the admiral failed from Fulta with the Kent, tygtYr Sali/hury, Bridgewater, King y s-fjher, and IValpole Indiaman, having firfl: em barked the troops, which had been landed to refrefh them, and which now amounted to 600 Europeans and about one thoufand Sepoys : Thefe were made ■Qp of the troops which we brought with us, and the remains of a detach;- Eougkky. thiS letter ^ Nalsh retlirned no anfvver ' ti 11 afo* our taking Calcutta and^ 7 ment[ 99 1 ment from Madrafs, which, as far back as Auguft, had been difpatched to this river under the command of Major Kilpatricky an experienced and good officer; and intended for the relief of Calcutta, then fuppofed to be in dan ger. The detachment at firft confided of 240 men •, but an epidemical fever had made fuch deftruflion among them, that not above ten were ca pable of doing duty when we arrived at Fulta, and, to the beft of my re membrance, not thirty of the whole detachment were left alive. On the 29th of December, at fix o'clock in the morning, the admiral having landed the company's troops the evening before at Mayapore, under the com mand of Lieutenant-colonel Clive, cannonaded Bougee Bougee fort, which was ftrong and built of mud, and had a wet ditch round it. The fort began to fire at the Tyger at 7 in the morning, and foon after at the whole fqua- dron till 1 in the afternoon, but its batteries were at length filenced by the cannon from the fhips. About 11 o'clock the admiral made the fignal for the king's troops to land, and join fome of the company's, that were feen marching under the bank of the river. Captain Coote accord ingly landed with the troops from the Kent and Tyger, joined the company's divifion, and advanced and took poffefllon of two out-forts which the enemy had quitted without taking away their colours: about 4 o'clock, two of the Kenfs 9 pounders were fent on fhore to make a breach in the gate-way, and Colonel dive's troops, after a very fatiguing march, were polled at the back of the fort to intercept the enemy, fhould they attempt to make a retreat, and for this purpofe were divided into feveral different parties. One of thefe was unexpeftedly attacked by 3000 horfe and foot under the command of Monich-chund the Indian governor of Calcutta, and in this fkirmifh more than twenty of our troops v/ere killed and wounded; but notwithftanding this advantage, as foon as the colonel himfelt came up with a reinforcement, and had difcharged a few of his field-pieces, which did great execution among the Moors, this commander in chief of the Nabob's army, after a mulket ball hadpaffed though his tur ban, retired with precipitation. The cannon of the fort being filenced by the fquadron, but the garrifon not offering to furrender, and continuing to difcharge fire-arrows and fmall arms, it was determined in a council of fea and land officers on board the Kent, that Colonel Clive fhould endeavour to take it by affault. For this purpofe, at five o'clock in the evening, the admiral landed an officer, two midfhipmen, and about forty failors from each fhip, under the command of Captain King, to afiift the colonel in ftorming the fort, which he intended doing juft before day-light, under the cover of two 24 pounders mounted clofe to the ditch. In the mean time, the colonel had given diredTtions, that the whole army, (the neceffary guards excepted) and the detachment from the fhips, fhould reft on the ground, in order to recover themfelves as much as poffible from the great fatigues they had under-gone in the preceding day's fervice. All now was quiet in the camp j and we on board the fhips, O 2 ' which[ 100 ] 175which lay at their anchors but at a fmall diftance from the fhore, had enter- —' tained thoughts of making ufe of this interval to refrefti ourfelves alfowith 1 . an hour or 'two of fleep; but fuddenly, a loud and univerfal acclamation was heard from the fhore, and foon afterwards an account was bronghr to- the admiral, that the fort had- been taken by ftbrm. This was a joyfuh piece of news, and the more fo, as it was quite unexpeded but when the particular circumftances that ufhered in this fuccefs, were related, our ex ultation was greatly abated, becaufe we found that the rules fo indifpenfably neceflary in all military exploits, had been entirely difregarded in the prefent. inftance, and therefore could not help looking upon the perfon, who had 1 the principal hand in this vidory, rather as an objeflof chaftifement, than of applaufe.—The cafe was this. During the tranquil ftate of the camp,. one Strah'an, a common failor belonging to the Kent, having been juft ferved with a quantity of grog, (arrack mixed with water,) had his fpirits too much elated to think of taking any reft; he therefore ftrayed by himfelf towards the fort, and imperceptibly got under the walls; being advanced thus far without interruption, he took it into his head to fcale at a breach that had been made by the cannon of the fhips; and having luckily gotten upon the baftion, he there difcovered feveral Moor-men fitting on the platform, at whom he flouriihed his cutlafs, and fired his piftol, and then, after having given three loud huzzas, cried out, ' ^he place is mine' The Moorijh foldiers immediately attacked him, and he defended himfelf ; with incom parable refolution ; but in the rencounter had the misfortune to have the blade of his cutlafs cut in two about a foot from the hilt: this mifchance however did not happen, till he was near being fupported by two or three other failors, who had accidentally ftraggled to the fame part of the fort, on which the other had mounted. They, hearing Strahan's huzzas, imme diately fcaled the breach likewife, and echoing the triumphant found, roufed the whole army, who taking the alarm, prefently fell on pell-mell, without orders and without difcipline, following the example of the failors. This attack, though made in fuch confufion, was attended with no other ill confequence, but the death of the worthy Captain Dougal Campbel, who was unfortunately killed by a mufket-bullet from one of our own pieces in the general confufion. Captain Coote commanded the fort for that night,, and at day-light the fort faluted the admiral. It was never exadtly known what number ot Moors there were in the fort when our people firft entered: probably there were but very few,, the major part of the garrifon having made their efcape foon after their batteries were filenced. We took in the fort 18 cannon from 24 pounders downwards, and 4.0 barrels of powder.. Strahan, the hero of this adventurous a6lion, was foon brought before the admiral, who, notwithftanding the fuccefs that had attended it, thought it neceffary to (hew himfelf difpleafed with a meafure in which the want of all military difcipline fo notorioufly appeared. He therefore angrily enquired into the defperate flep which he had taken : ' Mr. Strahan, what is this that you have been doing?'—The fellow, after having made his bow, fcratchedf 101 ] (cratched his head, and with one hand twirling his hat upon the other, I 75^ i replied, ' Why, to be fure, Sir, it was I who took the fort, but I hope ^ there was no harm in it' The admiral with difficulty was prevented from fmiling at the fimplicity of Strahan's anfwer; and the whole company were exceedingly diverted with his awkward appearance, and his language and manner m recounting the feveral particulars of his mad exploit. Mr. Wat- fon expatiated largely on the fatal confequences that might have attended his irregular conduft, and then with a fevere rebuke difmiffed him; but not before he had given the fellow fome diftant hints, that at a proper opportu- nity he fliould certainly be puniflied for his temerity. Strahan, amazed to find himfelf blamed, where he expefted praife, had no fooner gone from the admiral's cabin, then he muttered thefe words u If T am flogged for this here attion, I will never take mother fort by myfelf as long as I live, by G—d ' The novelty of the cafe, the fuccefs of the enterpnze, and the courageous fpirit which he had difplayed, pleaded ftrongly with the admiral in behalf of the offender-, and yet at the fame time the difciplme ot the fervice, required that he ftlould fliew him outwardly fome marks ot his dif- pleafure. This the admiral did, for fome little time •, but afterwards, at the interceffion of fome officers, which interceffion the admiral himfelf prompted them to make, he moft readily pardoned him. And it is not improbable, that had Strahan been properly qualified for the office of boatfwain, he mio-htonfome other pretence, before the expedition had ended, have been, promoted to that ftation in one of his majefly s fhips; but unfortunately for this brave fellow, the whole tenor of his conduct, both before and after the ftorming of the fort, was fo very irregular, as to lender it impofllbie for the admiral to advance him from his old ftation to any higher rank, how flrongly foever his inclinations led him to do it *. December 30, the fame afternoon of our taking pofTeflion of Bougee Bougee fort, the kind's and company's troops were again lent on board the Iqua- dron to proceed up the river; but the Sepoys were ordered to march on by land.

The next morning all the fquadron weighed, and proceeded on to Calcutta, except the Salifbury, which was ordered to Itay behind, and, after bringing off the guns, &amp;c. demolifh Bougee Bougee forts.

Captain ^Latham however had no fooner brought his fhip to an anchor, (which he did very much like an expert and gallant officer) but he briikly returned the fire ; and the Kent having come to an anchor alfo and difcharged a few broad fides, the Indians at 11 o'clock gave up the conteft ; and obferving alfo that Colonel Ciiuc at the fame time had nearly invefted the town on the land fide, they abandoned the fort. On this fome of the old inhabitants of the town waved their hands from the fhore, and one of them hoifted an Englijh pendant on a tree. The admiral immediately fent Cap. tain King afiiore to take pofiefiion of the fort in his majefly's name, and in a few minutes after it was garrifoned with a detachment ot Adlercron\ Tegiment, under the command of Captain Ccote, who ferved on board the Kent, and who was appointed governor of this new conquefl. Soon after Captain Coote had taken poflefilon of the fort, Colonel Clive entered the place at the head of the company's troops, when the captain prefented to the colonel an order f which he had received from the admiral, appointing him governor of the fort •, the colonel denied any authority Admiral IVatfcn had to appoint an inferior officer to him as governor, and told Captain Coote that he would take on himfelf the command ; and if he offered to obftrud him, or dilbbey his orders, he would immediately put him under an arreft: the captain defired that he might acquaint Mr. Watfon with thefe particulars ; to which the colonel confented.—Upon this the admiral fent Captain Speke on fhore to know by what authority the colonel took upon him the command of the fort; who anfwered, by the authority of his majefty's commiffion as lieutenant-colonel and alfo commander in chief of the land forces. Captain Speke went to the admiral with this anfwer, and foon returned with a meffage from Mr. JVatfon to the colonel, that if he did not abandon the fort, he would fire him out. The colonel replied, he could not anfwer for the confequences, but that he would not give up his command. Soon after this. Captain Latham, ^vho was in a ftridl intimacy with him, was fent by the admiral to t ' Charles Watfon, Efq; Vice-admiral of the blue fquadron of his majefty's fleet, and commander in chief of his majefty's ftiips and veffels employed in the Eafi Indies t and of the marine forces of the united company of merchants trading to and in thefe parts.

AFTER the fuccefs of our forces at Calcutta, fome of the council of the French fettlement at Chandernagore, and alfo of the Dutch fettle- ment at Chinfura, came to pay their congratulatory compliments to the admiral and colonel. The firft were empowered to propofe a formal con firmation of the neutrality which had been hitherto ftriflly obferved between the two companies in the Ganges: they fuggefted, that fuch a neutrality was not only neceflary for the mutual interefts of both nations, but pleaded a claim of particular indulgence on account of the many good offices they had done the Englifh in the time of their diftreffes at Fulta. Thefe argu ments certainly carried great force with them, and they were attentively liftened to by Admiral IVatfon, and our other principals; who would not have fcrupled to clofe with them, if the French in return would have joined our forces in the war we were now to carry on againft the Nabob. But when this propofal was made to their deputies, they replied, that they were not invefted with proper authority to treat on that fubjecfh They therefore dcfired that they might be allowed to return to Chandernagore, to confult their governor and council on fo important a fubjed. The uninterrupted train of fuccefTes we had met with fince our firfl entering the mouth of the Ganges, had ftruck the Nabob and his adherents with fuch a panic, that our commanders came to a refolution of lofing no time, but to pufh on the war with the greateft vigour. Accordingly Houghley, a very large and rich city belonging to the Nabob, fituate on the river about thirty miles above Calcutta^, was fixed upon as the next objetft of our military ope- 7 rations-[ i 0 5 ] rations. This refolution was no fooner taken, but the Bridgewnter^ Captain 1757. Henry Smith, the King*s-fijher floop, Captain 'Toly, and the Thunder bomb- -v—. ketch, Captain Warrick, (which veffel had been added to the fquadron in the Ganges) with all the boats of the fquadron mann'd with 150 Tailors, 200 European troops and 250 Sepoys, were ordered on the expedition. Major Kil- patrick was appointed by Colonel Clive to command the land forces, and Cap tain King was, by the admiral, put at the head of the failors who were to ad on fhore. This armament failed from Calcutta the 5th of January, and though they were impeded two days in their paffage, owing to the Bridgewaterh running afliore, yet we had the fatisfadtion to hear, that on the 9th they came to an anchor off the place, and on the 10th the iliips cannonaded the fort till 12 o'clock at night, when Major Kilpatrick fent Captain Coote to examine the breach they had made; he finding it pradicable to enter, two attacks were immediately formed ; 50 men went to the main gate, and kept a conftant firing, while the chief force entered privately at the breach, and with very little refiftance took pofTefllon of the city and fort, the enemy going to the place of the falfe attack, and then running away through one of the gates. The fort was much ftronger than was at firft imagined, and the garrifon coniifted of 2000 men, who lired very fmartly from 'five in the afternoon till ten at night, and killed and wounded feveral of our men before they ftormed. We took fome ammunition, and 20 guns, from 24 pounders down wards. A fmall quantity of Tutenegg, Tinkal and Japan Copper was alfo found here, but far Ihort of what was reported to have been in the place : however, it is very certain, that in Houghley we fhould have met with a very confiderable booty, had not our old friends the Dutch at Chin fur a taken all the valuable efedis and principal perfons of the Moors, under their protedion. Soon after the ftorming and capture of Houghley, Captain Speke of the Kent, being fent up by the admiral, took on him the command of the failors, and in conjundion with 50 foldiers and 100 Sepoys, under the com mand of Captain Coote, undertook to burn a place called the Gongee, con taining feveral large granaries and other ftorehoufes belonging to the Nabob, for the fupport of his army, about three miles from the fort. In their march, they entered a Portuguefe convent, where they were in formed that between three and four thouland of the enemy were encamped behind the village they were going to burn. Nothing daunted, they pro ceeded, and marched into the village for about a mile and half, when Cap tain Coote defired the lailors, and ordered the land-forces to begin to fct fire to all the houfes in the rear, as they marched back. This was done; but betore they had gotten half way, fome of the advanced guard came running and told the captain, that the enemy to the number of 5000 were marching up towards them, and had taken pofleflion not only of fome houfes, but of the men of war's boats. As the rear of the detachment was svell fecured by the houfes in flames, Captain Coote formed his 50 European P foldiers•[ 106 ] \ foldiers into three platoons i but the ftreet was fo narrow, they were obliged to march by files, and the captain made every platoon into two firings, and fo advanced by ftreet firing brifkly upon them. At our firft fire the chief officer and 5 of the enemy fell, on which their horfe gallop'd off; but their mufketry, under cover of fome houfes, and at the corner of lanes, killed and wounded fome of our men, but dared not openly attack us. Major KiU patrick, on hearing the firing, marched out of the garrifon at Houghley to fupport the detachment, but the affair was over before he joined it, and on their return they found the fhips boats all fafe. After this fervice was performed. Captain Speke gave his commands to the failors to repair on board their boats, when three of them were miffing, who were then fuppofed to be either killed or defperately wounded; but it afterwards appeared that they had ftraggled into the country, and through their great fatigue had thrown themfelves on the ground, and fallen faft afleep. About the middle of the following night, feveral of the country villages were feen in flames by the officers on board the fhips, which appeared to them very extraordinary, and they could not poffibly account for it. Early the next morning, however, a raft was obferved floating down the river, and on it fat, with the greatefl compofure imaginable, our three miffing failors; who, after they were taken off, and brought on board their ihips, gave the following account of their adventure: ' that awak ing in the beginning of the night, and perceiving their companions had left them, they judged it expedient to fet fire to all the villages^ in order to intimidate the enemy, and make them believe that the whole detachment flill continued on ftiore, which had done them fo much mif- chief the preceding day. That as foon as the day broke they repaired to the water's edge to fearch for a boat, in which they hoped to be con veyed on board their fhips. No fuch thing however could be found; but luckily for them this raft at length prefented itfelf, on which they refolved to truft themfelves.' By good fortune, they arrived fafe among their com panions, before their enemies had fo far recovered from their panic, as to think of cutting off their retreat.- I cannot now afcertain the number of feamen killed in this expedition^ but by the books of the hofpital, it appeared that twenty-five were wounded; among whom was Mr. Edward Roberts, a young gentlemaa of the IJle of Wight, who ferved as midfhipman on board the Kent, and was fo much hurt by a mufket-ball he received in his hand, as to be obliged to have it taken off, and was in great danger of his life for fome time afterwards.. The admiral being informed of his misfortune, of the intrepidity he had ihewn in the aftion, and of his manly refolution at the time of the am putation, fent him a meffage by me, defiring him to keep up his fpirits^ arid that for his good behaviour, he would foon make him a lieutenants This iiift I0 7 1 This promire Mr. Watfon moft pun(5lually fulfilled, by giving him a commiffion, dated January 1757*. Mr. Hamilton^ another have young gentleman, a midfhipman alfo of the Kent^ was killed upon the fpor. Mr. Owen and Mr. Samhle, midfhipmen of the Tyger, were wounded, but not mortally. And in confequence of this expedition to Houghley, though not by the fliot of the enemy. Lieutenant James Roddam of the Kent, lofl his life : he was a moft amiable young gentleman in every refpe6t, and fo nicely fcrupulous of his honour, that when the expedition took place, he carefully concealed from the admiral's knowledge an indifpofition which he had laboured under for fome days, and chearfully fet off with the armament from Calcutta -■&gt; but through the great fatigue he underwent when the Bridgewater ran afhore, his difeafe^ which was a Diarrhoea and fever, fo much increafed, that it became abfolutely neceflary for Captain Smith to fend him back to the hofpital. He was received there on the nth, and died the 16th of greatly lamented by all his acquaint ance, who refpedled him not lels for his focial than his military virtues. Lieutenant John Gierke, (a fenfible and gallant young officer, a great favourite of the admiral's, and who from his earlieft youth had been bred up at fea under him) had a very narrow efcape in this expedition, from a mufket-ball which entered at the fore-part of the crown of his hat, and went through it, but did him no kind of harm. Mr. Pye, ftorekeeper to the fquadron, who went a volunteer to Houghley with his friend Captain Speke, was very near lofmg his life •, a bullet trom the enemy went through the bread of a failor, and killed him on the fpot, as he was walking dole by Mr. Pjy^s fide. Soon after the redu6tion of Houghley, the admiral difpatched Captain Richard King in a floop of 60 tons, to England, with an account of our fortunate proceedings thus far-, and preparations were made for carrying the war as far as Dacca, by another branch of the river : had this expedi tion taken place, doubtlefs it would have been attended with fuccefs, and confequently we Ihould have been put in poflelfion of an immenfe treafure; for here were no Dutchmen to counterafl us in fecuring the perfons, and fecreting the effects of our enemies. But our attention was called off from this very defirable and tempting object, by the alarming intelligence we received, that the Nabob, incenfed at the lofs of all his late conquefts, and alarmed at the rapidity of ours, had railed a formidable army, and was marching at the head of it from his capital Muxadahad towards Calcutta, fully determined to drive the Englijh out of all his territories, and take ample vengeance for the difgraces we had brought upon him. * This gallant officer remained in the Eajl Indies after the author left that country, and {erved with great honour in all the fea engagements which happened between the Englijh and French fleets under the command of Admiral, now Sir George Pocock* On[ ioS ] , 7 r 7 . On onr taking of Houghley, and burning the granaries, the Nahoh thought L J t ' ' proper to take fome notice of Admiral Watforfs letter to him on his arrival at Fulta i and the following is a tranflation of the letter fent by Serajah Dowlah to the admiral; dated January 23d, 1757. ' YOU write me, that the king your matter fent you into India to pro- ted the company's fettlements, trade, rights, and privileges: the inllant I received that letter, I lent you an anfwer * ; but it appears to me that my reply never reached you, for which reafon I write again. I muft inform you that Roger Drake, the company's chief in Bengal, a6led contrary p the orders I fent him, and encroached upon my authority: he gave pro- tedion to the king's fubjects, who abfented themfelves from the infpeftion of the Durbar f, which practice I did forbid *, but to no purpofe. On this account I was determined to punifh him, and accordingly expelled him my country. But it was my inclination to have given the Englijh company permiffion to have carried on their trade as formerly, had another chief been fent here. For the good therefore of thefe provinces, and the inhabitants, I fend you this letter; and if you are inclined to re-eilablifh the company, only appoint a chief, and you may depend upon my giving currency to their commerce, upon the fame terms they heretofore enjoyed : If the Englifi behave themfelves like merchants, and follow my orders, they may reft alTured of my favour, protedion, and afliftance.

Yoa.[ I0 9 ] You tell me in your letter, that the reafon of your expelling the Englijh out of thefe countries, was the bad behaviour of Mr. Brake, the company's chief in Bengal. But befides, that princes, and rulers of ftates, not feeing with their own eyes, nor hearing with their own ears, are often mifinformed, and the truth kept from them by the arts of crafty and wicked men; was it becoming the juitice of a prince to punifh all for one man's fake ? Or to ruin and deftroy fo many innocent people, as had no way offended, but who, relying on the faith of the royal Phirmaund *, expe£ted proteftion and fecurity both to their property and lives, inftead of opprefTion and murder, which they unhappily found ? Are thefe adlions becoming the juftice of a prince? Nobody will fay they are. They can only then have been can fed by wicked men, who have mifreprefented things to you through malice, or for their own private ends; foi' great princes delight in afts of juftice, and in Ihewing mercy. If therefore you are defirous of meriting the fame of a great prince and lover of juftice, fhew your abhorrence of thefe proceedings, by punifhing thofe evil counfellors who advifed them^ caufe fatisfaflion to be made to the company, and to all others who have been deprived of their property •, and by thefe a6ls turn off the edge of the fword which is ready to fall on the heads of your fubjefts.

The Nahoh being determined by all means to extirpate the Englffh, took, no notice of this letter, till he had collefted together his forces, and: began his march towards us, when the admiral received from him the.' following. tc YOU have taken and plundered Hcughlsy, and made war upon my fubjects; thefe are not anions becoming merchants! 1 have therefore- left Muxadahad, and am arrived near Houghley \ I am likewife crofiing the river with my army, part of which is advanced towards your camp.

I fliall not fcruplc to grant a Perwannah * for the reftitution of all the company's faftories, and permit them to trade in my country upon the fame terms as formerly. If the Englijh, who are fettled in thefe provinces, will behave like merchants, obey my orders, and give me no offence, you may depend upon it, I will take their loffes into confideration, and adjuft matters to their fatisfaflion. You know how difficult it is to prevent foldiers from plundering in war-, therefore if you will on your parts relinquifli fomething of the damages you have fuftained by being pillaged by my army, I will endeavour to give you fatisfadlion even in that particular, in order to gain your friendfhip, and preferve a good underftanding for the future with your nation. You are a Chrijlian, and know how much prefer able it is to accommodate a difpute, than to keep it alive ; but if you are determined to facrifice the intereft of your company, and the good of private merchants, to your inclinations for war, it is no fault of mine: to prevent the fatal confequences of fuch a ruinous war, I write this letter,' The Nabob waited not for a reply, but advanced with his forces, which confided of 18,000 horfe and 15,000 foot, 10,000 pioneers, and about 40,000 Cooleys, horfekeepers, cooks. Bazar-men^ &amp;c. 50 elephants, and 40 pieces of cannon and yet, infinitely inferior as our troops were in number to this vaft multitude, being but 711 Europeans in battalion, about 100 artillery, 1300 Sepoys, with 14 field pieces 6 pounders, befides the cannon on our batteries, they placed fuch confidence in the good fortune and abilities of their com mander, that they did not in the leait hefitate to abide the attack. Agree able to this refolution, the colonel formed his camp on a fpot of ground near the river, about four miles to the northward of Calcutta, between it and the Nabob's army : indeed Calcutta was then not defenfible, the fort had no ditch, its baftions did not deferve the name, and there were houfes fo near the fort as to command the few fortifications it had -f. On the 2d of February, the admiral by invitation dined with the colonel in his camp •, but they had not finiflied their meal, before the Nabob's army appeared in view, marching at about a mile diftance from them, in the way towards Calcutta. The admiral foon took his leave of the gentlemen of the army, and returned in his boat to Calcutta, to give the enemy a proper reception, fhould they attempt to recover the fort; one or two of their fcouting parties fired at him as he paffed down the river. The fame evening, the colonel marched out of the camp with a detachment, of men and fix field pieces two miles towards the enemy, and drew up oppofite to their line of march. A cannonade prefently began between him and the Nabob, (who iired trom 10 pieces of cannon, fonie of them 32 pounders) and which con- * An order or grant. f Wndc the colonel was in fearch of a proper place for an encampment, a wild buffalo ran W IJrfS ^ u- u 8 the ^ 11 attacked, difcharged his muiket ball into its body, ZilZ Zt? 00 bayonet, yet the creature killed the man, and made off.

In this little affair, we had a few men killed, and among the wounded were Captain Nicholas JVelkr of the king's regiment, and Captain Frafer of the company's troops. The following day, Meflrs. Waljh and Scrafton, in confequence of a pro- pofal made by the Nabob, that two proper perfons might be fent to him to treat of a peace,, were difpatched with the admiral's and colonel's demands. But thefe gentlemen, inftead of meeting with him at the place he himfelf had appointed, were conduced to Omichund's garden, which lies within the bound-ditch of Calcutta, and which he had now fixed upon for his head quarters. His army was encamped on a plain about 4 miles to the eaft- ward of the town, and now between it and our army. They did not fail to exprefs their furprize to the Nabob at not finding him at the place of his own appointment, and to which they had been directed to repair, by their principals; adding that they very much doubted whether it was in their power to treat with him in any other place. After entering however a little upon the bufinefs that brought them thither, they foon found from his converfation, that his intention was only to amufe j they therefore prefled for a permifllon to leave him, and prefently after withdrew. He referred them, for a farther explanation of his fentiments, to one of his principal agents, who was a Seraf or Banker but as foon as Meflrs. Walfb and Scrafton could get from him, they thought it prudent (for fear of any treachery) to put out their light, and then made the beft of their way to the colonel at his camp. As foon as the colonel had been acquainted with the ifllie of their nego tiation, he came to an immediate refolution of attacking the Nabob in his camp that very night. For this purpofe, he difpatched away an exprefs to the admiral, acquainting him with his defign, and defiring him to ftrengthen his little army with a reinforcement of failors. Orders were accordingly iifued to the feveral captains of the fquadron to fend their proportion of officers and failors for this fervice, all volunteers^ and who made up a body of five hundred and fixty-nine men. They had orders to proceed immediately by water to the camp, under the command of Captain Thomas Warrick of the Thunder bomb-ketch, and they joined the colonel about two in the morning, whofe troops were already under arms. Captain Warrick with his reinforcement was ordered to attend and guard the train of artillery, which confided of fix field-pieces and one cohorn. Soon after wards they marched off the ground in the following order : The king's and company's granadiers in the fronts the failors with the train next •, then followed the battalion •, and the Sepoys brought up the rear. At three,, the colonel altered his difpofition, and marched the battalion before the train. In this order they went on unperceived till day-break, (having Mr, Amy at t, one of the council,, and a black man, for their guides.) About 757- P II[ 112 ] i --7 five o'clock they got over tiie trenches into xht NaboVs camp, and then bco-an firing away' on all Tides, making their way quite through the camp, and killing 0 great numbers of the enemy. Unfortunately, there was at that time one of thole remarkable thick fogs, which at certain feafons of the year prevail m Bengal, and render objeds at the-diftance of two or three yards as invifible as in the darkeft night-, by this the guides miftook their way, 2nd inftead of going on to the Nabob's head quarters, as the colonel intended, they turned too much to the left, and led the troops without the Bungelo ditch, behind which the enemy had entrenched themfelves.. This miftake in all probability faved the Nabob's whole army from an entire defeat •, it is certain, that it made the colonel's vidory much lefs complete than it otherwile would have been', for as the day advanced,' and the fog difperfed, he could not think of renewing the a6lion by attacking the enemy again with his fmall body of forces, fecured as they were behind a ftrong intrenchment made fome years before by the Englijh for the defence of Calcutta againft the Maharattas. He therefore drew off his little army, and gaining a pafs over the intrenchment about a mile from the place of adion, advanced amidft a brilk cannonading on both fides towards Calcutta, where the army arrived about noon. We loft upwards of fifty men in this aftion ; a platoon of the company's grenadiers being blown up before day by a fhower of the enemies arrows with fire-rockets falling upon them, which fet fire to the powder that they carried in their pockets. Captain Pye, and Captain Bridges, (the laft of whom was alio Colonel dive's fecretary) were killed early in the morning. Lieutenant Lutwidge * of the Salijhury was mortally wounded, and about 15 other feamen loft their lives. The carriages of two pieces of our cannon which were in the rear of the army, breaking, we were obliged to leave them behind. We had various accounts of the number killed in the Nabob's army in this action. A Brahmin, who was in his camp foon afterwards, aflured us, that he had 1300 men killed and wounded. Among the former, were two of his principal generals, 22 captains, &amp;c. Five hundred horfes were alio killed, and three or four elephants. So great a flaughter however was made among them, as to alarm the Nabob, and fill his mind with continual apprehenfions of being foon attacked again. For the colonel, prelently atter his return to Calcutta, by a very fpirited and excellent manoeuvre, at five the lame afternoon took pofTeflfion of his former camp, and like a heavy cloud, feemed to hang over the NaboFs army, ready to burft upon it. 1 his timorous Barbarian therefore, for fear of a lecond furprize, kept his troops under arms the whole night. Mr. Lutiuidge was one of thofe many fpirited young gentlemen who went In Admiral IVatfons iquadron to the Eajl Indies, and who were often juftly denominated the flower ef nav y» he died at fick quarters the 10th of March, of the wound he received. Immediately■ [ US 1 iit Immediately after the ftorming of the Nabob's camp, the admiral wrote 1757 the following letter to him, dated February 6, 1757. 'THE letter, which you will receive with this, was written the day before yefterday * but before that I could get it tranflated into the Per/tan language in order to its being fent to you, I was informed by Colonel Clive, thaSt you had treated his deputies with difrefped, and that you was within the bounds of Calcutta, from which you had refufed to retire. Evidences fo full and pofitive, of your bad intentions towards us, that however ftrong my inclinations might be towards peace, I could no longer entertain any reafonable hopes of feeing it accomplifhed. I therefore de- fired Colonel Clive to Ihew you what an army of Englijhmen was capable of doing, that before it was too late you might agree to the propofals, which would be made to you. He yielded to my defire, and marched through your whole camp, as if it had not been filled with armed men; after which he returned to his own, where he will remain yet a little while, in hopes of feeing you accede to the reafonable propofals, which are now offered to you for the laft time, from the fecret committee. If you are wife^ you will grant them the juftice that is their due; otherwife, the fword is going to be drawn that never will be fheathed again,' * The inclofed letter, was as follows: ' THE letter which you fent me in anfwer to my reply to your former letter, I received ihe day before yefterday. But as I was fitting down to write an anfwer to it, intelligence was brought me, that part of your army had entered Calcutta, and that the remainder was advancing in great hafte towards our camp. I had no fooner heard thefe things, than looking towards the town, the fmoke and flames which I faw afcending from it, confirmed their truth. Wherefore, from fuch appearances, looking upon all treating as at an end, I .gave over the thoughts of writing. Since this, I hear from Colonel Cli've that you have again made offers cf treating, and that in confequence thereof he has fent to you Meflrs.

For my own particular fentiments, if you will look back upon my letters, you will find that they always propofed amicable methods; and my actions have always correfponded with them, for it was not till after defpairing of peace, by having no anfwers to my letters, that I could prevail on myfelf to commit any hoftilities ; to which 1 was always-fo averfe, that even in the midft of viflory, I ftopt fhort to liften to the voice of peace. I am ftill inclined to it, notwithftanding the little profpeft of its taking place. However, to take away all blame from me, both in the eyes of God and man, and to convince the world how much rather I wiflx to fee the happincfs of mankind than their mifery, I write this. If you really and fincerely mean to treat of peace, liften to the propofals which will be made by the gentlemen who are now v/ith you. They alk nothing but juftice, nor mean any thing more than the mutual good of both nations. If you refufe it, remember, that princes are only placed at the head of mankind to procure their happinefs; and that they muft one day give a very fevere account, if through ambition, revenge, or avarice, they fail in their duty.

And that fo long as the Souhahdar, i £c. fliail abide by his promifes, and the articles figned by him, I will always look upon his- enemies as the enemies of my nation, and when called upon, will grant him all the affiftance in my power.' The Soubahdar or Nabob, on the ratification of the treaty, fent the ufual prefent to the admiral, governor, and colonel; to each an elephant, a dreis or veft, and head jewel, and which were received by the governor and colonel as' reprefenrativesr of the company, but Mr. IVatfon, as reprefentative of the king, refufed to accept the prefent. However, he received the Nabob's officers who brought them,,in a very polite manner on board the Kent, and difplayed to them his lower tier of 32 pounders, of which they made a dreadful report to their mailer, who not conceiving any great liking to his new friends, continued his march with all hafce to the capital, happily for his fubjecfls fomewhat humbled by his late defeat. Mr. IVdtts, one of the council, being well verfed in the country language, and in their politics and cuftoms, accompanied the Nabob to attend the fulfilling of the treaty Mr. Watts carried with him the following letter from the admiral to the Nabob, dated the 16th of February 1757. « OMICHUND lias informed me of the particulars you was pleafed to inftruft him with. The advice you have received of a fleet of French men of war, and a large land army under the command of Monfr.

A requelt of this nature I fhall always take pleafure in granting, and by my readinefs to comply with your defire, you will be fufficiently convinced of the fincerity of my friendfhip and efteem, and be fatisfied with my a6tions.

Confidering all circumftances, the treaty was honourable and advantageous for us, and the Nabob was in fome meafure puniflied for thofe unheard of cruelties which he had fo wantonly exercifed againft many innocent indi viduals J. As foon as all difficulties with the Indians were thus happily removed, the next objed that naturally prefented itfelf, was the reducing the French power in this province. The committee indeed, who had the direction of the company's affairs in Bengal, took, care to reprefent to the admiral, that as a peace had been concluded with the Nabob, this was the only opportu nity he perhaps might ever meet with for afling offenfively againft the French, from whofe councils, great evils were ftill to be expelled. The admiral, who plainly faw the force of this reafoning, molt readily came into the propofal; and nothing would have prevented his immediately commencing hoftilities againft the French, had not fome gentlemen of that nation arrived at this time from Chandernagore with frelh propofals for a neutrality. Thefe were thought fo reafonable by many gentlemen of our company's council, that for a while matters flood in a ftate of fufpence, and * Thefe were for his confent to our attacking the Frtnch. + ^Mr. James s arrival in the Ganges., was very opportune, not only on account of the certain intelligence of the war with France, but by bringing with him in his own ihip and uvo^ tranlports, a detachment of 500 men, which enabled us immediately to aft offenfively the French. His great merit in undertaking, and unremitting perfeverance in accom- phlning, the paffage round from Bombay in that uncommon late feafon of the year, ought alfo to be particularly noticed; as well as his taking on the paffage Vlndien, a French Indiaman, aden wuh warlike flores and provifions for the French fquadron then at the ifland of Mauri' ttus, which greatly diftreffed them, and retarded their operations. * U P 01 } . the ratification of the treaty with the Nahb, the admiral fent home Captain H arrtck wuh exprelfes of intelligence to the Secretary of State and the Admiralty. 7 nothingr 1 '9 ] nothing was talked of but a treaty of peace and amity between the two 1757, nations in Bengal. At length, the following fuggeftion arole: ' Whether -y—' the government of Chandernagore, (being fubordinate to that zt Pondi cherry) had in themfelves fufficient authority to make the treaty valid, fhould the prefidency at Pondicherry chance to difapprove of their proceedings.' This iingle queftion put an end to all thoughts of a neutrality •, for as the French -deputies, upon its being put to them, did not prefume to anlwer in the affirmative, and as it was by this time known that war had actually been declared between the two nations in Europe^ the admiral came to a relblu- tion of breaking off the negotiation. Accordingly he, on the part of his majefty, and the committee, on that of the Englijh Eafi India company, entered into an agreement for attacking Chandermgore, the principal fettle- ment of the French in this part of xhe Indies, and ftrongly garrifoned. The fort was a regular fquare, about three quarters of a mile in circumference, with 4 baftions, each mounting 16 guns, befides fome on the curtain, and a battery of 4 pieces of cannon on the top of a church. There was a dry fofle round the three fides to the land, with a glacis of about 40 yards. At the northward port was a ravelin mounting 5 guns, and oppofite the port towards the water fide was a mud battery of 6 guns which flanked down the river. The expedition would have taken place in a few days, had not the Nabob interpofed: as early as the 19th of February, he fent the following letter to the admiral. 'TO put an end to the hoftilities in my country and dominions, I confented and agreed to the treaty of peace with the Englijh, that trade and commerce might be carried on as formerly •, to which treaty you have agreed, and a firm accommodation between us is fettled and eftablifhed: you have likewife fent me an agreement, under your own hand and feal, not to difturb the tranquility of my country; but it now appears that you have a defign to befiege the French fa6lory near Houghley, and to commence hoftilities againtt that nation. This is contrary to all rule and cuftom, that you fhould bring your animofities and differences into my country •, for it has never been known fince the days of 'Timur, that the Europeans made war upon one another within the king's dominions. If you are determined to befiege the French faftories, I fliall be neceffitated in honour and duty to my king, to alfift them with my troops. You feem inclined to break the treaty fo lately concluded between usformerly the infclled thefe domi nions, and for many years harraffed the country with war, but when the difpute was accommodated, and a treaty of peace with that people con cluded, they never broke, nor will they ever deviate from, the terms of the faid treaty. It is a wrong and wicked pradice, to break through and pay no regard to treaties made in the mod iblemn manner; you are certainly bound to abide by your part of the treaty ftridly, and never to attempt or be the occafion of any troubles or difturbances in future within the provinces under[ 12° ] under my jurifdiaion. I will on my part obferve moft pundtually what I have promifed and confented to, I will maintain and preserve on my part the treaty of peace I have made with the ENGLISH, which with the permission of God I hope will continue for ever. You may have heard, that for seven years, we had constant wars with the MAHA- RATTA's, but when a treaty of peace was concluded with them, they strictly observed the terms, and never deviated from them, I t is but just and reasonable that your nation should pay re gard to the late treaty, and commit no hostilities in my coun try, nor disturb its tranquility with any differences, that may subsist between you and other EUROPEAN powers. To this, the Admiral fent the following reply, dated the 21ft of Fe bruary, 1157' ' YOUR letter of the 19th, I was honoured with this morning, and obferve that you difapprove of our committing hoftilities againft the French fettled in thefe provinces. Had I imagined it would have given you any umbrage, I fhould never have entertained the leaft thoughts of difturbing the tranquility of your country, by acting againft that nation within the Ganges and am now ready to defift from attacking their fadory, or commit ting other hoftilities againft them in thefe provinces, if they will conlent and agree to a folid treaty of neutrality *, and if you as Soubahdar of Bengal will under your hand guarantee this treaty, and promife to protect the Englijh from any attempts made by that nation againft our fettlements during my abfence. I am perfuaded you have heard of no people in the world who pay a ftridler regard to their word, and to the faith of treaties, than the Englijh \ and I do fincerely affure you, that I will inviolably preferve the peace we have concluded with you, and I dare anfwer for the colonel and the company's reprefentatives, that they will not attempt to infringe any part of it. I have ratified the late treaty between you and the EN GLISH with my hand and seal', and I now repeat my' assu rances, made in the presence of GOD and of JESUS CHRIST, That I will maintain and preserve inviolably my part of the said treaty, not doubting of your sincerity in performing such articles as you have consented to.

'THE letter I wrote to you yefterday, I imagine you have received ; fince which I have been informed by the French Vackeel that five or fix additional fhips of war have arrived in the river, and that more are ex- pefted. He reprefents likewife, that you defign commencing hoftilities againft me and my fubjedts again, as foon as the rains are over. This is not afting agreeable to the character of a true foldier, and a man of honour, who never violated their words. If you are fincere in the treaty concluded with me, fend your fhips of war out of the river, and abide fledfaftly by your agreement •, I will not fail in the obfervance of the treaty on my part. Is it becoming or honeft to begin a war, after concluding the peace fo lately and folemnly ? The Maharattas are bound by no gofpel, yet they are ftrift obfervers of treaties. It will therefore be matter of great aftonifhment, and hard to be believed, if you, who are enlightened with the gofpel, fhould not remain firm, and preferve the treaty you have ratified in the prefence of God and Jefus Chrijl' mi; 01 ee ' To this the Admiral replied in a letter dated the 25th of February % ifci 1757- 'YOUR letter of the 20th inftant I received two days ago; but being jufl in the height of my difpatches for England, I was not able to anfwer it till now.

You tell me, ' It is unworthy the character of a foldier, and ' man of honour, to violate their words!' In what fingle inftance, fince my being here, have I a6led fo unworthily as to make you think me capable of violating mine ? Yourfelf can anfwer for me, in none.

Notwithftanding the perfidious Nahoh had by this time fent a body of forces to affift the French, he had yet the addrefs to fend the following letter to the Admiral. ' THE letter you wrote me about the French affair, I have received and perufed. You may depend upon it, that I neither have nor will aflift the French. If they begin any troubles or commit any hoftilities in my ter ritories, I will oppofe them with my whole force, and punifh them very feverely. I was informed you defigned to attack Chandernagore, which made me write you what I thought was reafonable and juft upon that head^ The forces 1 fent down were to guard and proted the King's fubjefts, and not to aflift the French. If the purport of my letter has been the occafion of your defifting from the attack of Chandernagore, it gives me great fatisfaftion. I have written the French likewife, what I thought was proper, in order to make them apply for a neutrality •, I fuppofe they will aft conformably. I will fend a perfon of confideration to bring me the treaty you may conclude with them, and will order it to be regiftered in my books. AfTure yourfelf that I have no other defign or inclination than; to live upon terms of good underftanding and friendfhip with the Englijh* By the grace of Qod, I nevec intend to do. any thing that you will not efteem juft ; this rely upon, and do not expedt a failure.

This laft requeft was inftantly complied with.. The Admiral to the Nabob, 1 I this moment received your letter, which gives me the grcateft fatis- faftion. I own I had a fufpicion, from your fo eafy crediting French reports, that you entertained a partiality for that nation to the pie- ju.djce of mine: your letter has removed all my doubts, fo that hencefor ward;/ [ I2 3 ] Ward I (hall rely with confidence on your friendlhip, and every day ftudy I 757* to give you the ftrongeft proofs of mine. ' v — The ready obedience I paid to your defire in not attacking the French, will, I perfuade myfelf, convince you that nothing but the flrongeft necef- fity, could make me again apply to you on that fubjed. I beg you will give your moft ferious attention to what I am going to fay: Immediately on the receipt of one of your pad letters, I not only gave over all thoughts of attacking the French^ but invited them to enter into a treaty of neutra lity, and to fend people here to fettle the terms; but judge what mud have been my furprize, when, after they were in fome manner fettled, the French deputies owned that they had no power to fecure to us the obfer- vance of the treaty, in cafe any commander of theirs Ihould come with a great power after my departure! You are too reafonable not to fee, that it is im- pofllble for me to conclude a treaty with people who have no power to do it and which befides, while it ties my hands, leaves thofe of my enemies at liberty to do me what mifchief they can. They have alfo for a long time reported, that Monfieur Bujfy is coming here with a great army. Is it to attack you ? Is it to attack us ? You are gojng to Patna —You afk our afiif- tance.—Can we with the leaft degree of prudence march with you, and leave our enemies behind us ? You will be then too far off to fupport us, and we (hall be unable to defend ourfelves. Think what can be done in this fituation. I fee but one way. Let us take Chandernagore, and fecure ourfelves againft any apprehenfions from that quarter, and then we will aifift you with every man in our power, and go with you even to Dehli, if you will. Have we fworn reciprocally, that the friends and the enemies of the one fhould be regarded as fuch by the other ? And will not God the avenger of perjury punifli us, if we do not fulfill our oaths? What can I fay more ? Let me requeft the favour of your fpeedy anfwer. You tell me the van of the KlNG of DEHLI's army is ad vancing towards these provinces, and that you are going to wards PATNA to meet them ; in consequence of which you ask me to be your friend, and give you assistance. H ave we not already sworn a, friendship? PuT it but in my power to assist you, by yielding to my request, and you shall find I will sup port you to the utmost of my ability. believe me, and most assuredly you will not be deceived. if you doubt me, look back into all my dealings towards you, and judge from them. I esteem you now to be such a friend to my nation, that I think it would be doing injustice to your good inclination towards me to keep any occurrence from your knowledge; therefore i take this earliest opportunity to tell you, the troops which should have come here with me, are now arrived in the river, a circumstance that will be beneficial to your interest, if you will but give m£ the m^ans of making it so.' R 2 A few '■Ti% [ 124 } A few days after this, the admiral's favourable fentiments of the Nabob —' were entirely changed ; he was convinced that he had entered into a private negotiation with, the and was determined to fupport them even with his' whole force, while every article of his treaty with us remained unfulfilled •, he therefore on March the 4th fent the following letter. The Admiral to the Nabob. « I anfwered your letter of the 20th of laft month fome days pad; 1 fuppofe you have ere now received it, and are thereby fully convinced of the falfhood of the French VackeeVs informations of my intention to break the peace. If you ftill want farther proofs of the fincerity with which I made it, and the defire I have to preferve if, you will find them in my 'patiences which has not only fuffered your part of the treaty to be thus long unexecuted, but has even borne with your afiifting my enemies the French^ with men and money, contrary to your faith pledged to me in the mod folemn manner, ' that my enemies fhould be yours.' ' Is it thus that foldiers and men of honour never violate their words ?' But it is time now to fpeak plain: if you are really defirous of prelerving your country in peace, and your lubjefls from mifery and ruin ; in ten days from the date of this, fulHU your part of the treaty in every article, that I may not have the leaft caufe ot complaint: otherwife, remember, you muft anfwer for the confequences •, and as I have always a6ted the open, unre- ferved part in all my dealings with you; I now acquaint you, that the re* mainder of the troops, which fhould have been here long fince (and which I hear the colonel told you he expelled) will be at Calcutta in a few days; that in a few days more I (hall difpatch a veflH for more fhips and more troops; and, that I will kindle iuch a flame in your country, as all the water in the Ganges Ihall not be able to extinguifh.

On the 14th the enemy fallied out, in which affair Captain greatly fignalized himfelf, and foon made them retreat; on this they quitted their outer works, and we became mafters of the town, and the batteries in and about it, with very little lofs and the enemy by this means were fhut up within their tort.

WILLIAM JAMES.' W ith this requeft, the admiral could not comply, as the public fervice obliged him to dif- pacch the Revenge to Fcr: St, George on buflnefs of great importance. • Our1 [ I2 7 ] Our preparations for the attack of this place had unavoidably been 5757. carried on fo openly, that it was impoflible they fhould be a fecret to the v——' French, who had therefore made ule of every poffible method to fruftrate our defign. Juft below the fort of Chandernagore, there was a large bank of fand, which made the paffage very narrow ^ to block up this channel, they had funk three fhips loaded with ballad ; the mails of which however ap peared above water. Three other large fhips lay at anchor above the fort; Thefe, it was faid, were prepared as fire-fhips, to be fent down with the tide to. burn our fquadron in the middle of the night. The admiral there fore refolved to be beforehand with them, and gave orders that all the boats of the fhips fhould go up as foon as the night came on, and endeavour to cut their cables. This was accordingly done, and they all drove upon the fands. It afterwards appeared, that the crews belonging to thofe fhips had been taken out to reinforce the garrifon.. The attack of the fort would probably have taken, place the next morn- Ing, had the tides in the river been at all favourable for that purpofe •, but unfortunately for us, they ferved either too early in the morning, or too late in the afternoon. This circumftance obliged the admiral to poftpone the attack for two or three days. In the mean time he fent Lieutenant Hey with a flag of truce to the governor, demanding a furrender of the place, which he politely, but refolutely refufed to give up. Mr. Hey^ having obferved, as he pafled between the vefTels mafts, which were funk in the channel of the river, that their hulls were not deep under water-,. Mr. John Delamotte, a brave and adive officer, and who was mafter on board the admiral's fhip, was the next day fent to found around them •, and notwithftanding all the efforts of the enemy to interrupt him by an inceffant liring of their cannon, he brought back the agreeable news, that there was room for our fhips to pafs with fafety between them. But befides the ob- ftruflion which we expeded to meet with from thefe funken veffels i the French had taken care to ereft two batteries of heavy cannon to render rhis narrow pafs ftill more difficult and dangerous. One of thefe was conftrufted in the form of a half moon, and lay on the very brink of the river, within mufket fhot of the funken veffels •, the other y/as a fafcine-battery on the glacis of the fort, and was intended to rake our ffiips fore and aft.—The cannon on their fouth baftion could alfo be brought to fire down the river. The difpofition made for attacking the fort was as follows. The tyger was to be placed againft the N. E. baftion j the Kent againft the curtain between the baftions oppofite the gate-, and the Salijhury againft the S. E.. baftion. Before we began the attack, it was judged abfolutely neceflary that Colonel Clive fhould ere6l a battery on the fide of the river, to fire on the fouth face of the enemy's S. E. baftion, and in cafe of an obftinate sefiftance, that we might breach that baftion by a crofs fire from the ihips, , - and;[ 128 ] 1757- and from this intended battery. Preparations were accordingly made fo? —^this purpofe; but before they could be carried into execution, the army were obliged to make themfelves mafters of the half-moon battery, which they did with great gallantry, driving the enemy's troops before them into the fort. All things being ready ; on the 226 the admiral appeared extremely anxious to begin the attack; but the flood-tide in the afternoon was fo very late, the fhips could not pofTibly be placed in their proper ftations while there was fufficient day-light to diredl our fire; the enemy therefore would have had a great advantage over us; for though the nights were too dark for us to diftinguifli the embrafures of their fortifications, yet they could plainly fee the hulls of our (hips, which would have lain fo near the fort, that a fhocking carnage muft have been made amongft their crews. That another day however might not be loft, the admiral the fame evening ordered lights to be placed on the mafts of the veflels that had been funk, with blinds towards the fort, that we might fee how to pafs between them a little before day-light, and without being difcovered by the enemy. At length, the glorious morning of the 23d of March arrived, and upon the fhips getting under fail, the Colonel's battery, which had been finifhed behind a dead wall, began firing away on the S. E. baftion. The Tyger, with Admiral Pocock's, flag flying *, took the lead, and about fix o'clock in the morning got very well into her ftation againft the N. E. baftion. The Kent, with Admiral IVatforfs flag, quickly followed her; but before ftie could reach her proper ftation, the tide of ebb unfortunately made down the river, which occafioned her anchor to drag ; fo that before fhe brought up, fhe had fallen abreaft of the S. E. baftion, the place where the Salif- htiry fhould have been, and from her mainmaft aft, fhe was expofed to the flank guns of the S. W. baftion alfo. This accident of the Kent's anchor not holding fad, and her driving down into the Salijhtwy's ftation, threw this laft fhip out of adlion, to the great mortification of her captain, officers, and crew, for (he never had it in her power to fire a gun, un- lefs it was now and then, when fhe could fheer on the tide. The French, during the whole time of the Kent and Tyger's approach towards the fort, vept up a terrible cannonade upon them, without any refiftance on their parts; but as loon as the fhips came properly to an anchor, they returned it with fuch a fury as aftonifhed their adverfaries. Colonel Clive's troops at hewdd I foTapAt VV o day fl bef0re l his '- had arrIved at BaIla / ore in Cumherland, and though fore in L baf^ W, Z t t P f T*'' ^ he WOuld b y n0 be fnadiv;, and there- nf g d a£ W Mch otherwifc'would^avc bfn KTommandcr h0n0,,ri the[ 129 ] \ tlie fame time goc into thofe houfes which were neareft the fort, and i!f)m 1757* thence greatly annoyed the enemy with their mufketry *. The fire now became general on both fides, and was kept up with extra ordinary fpirit. The flank guns of the S. W. baftion galled the Kent very much, and the admiral's aid-de-camps being all wounded, Mr. JVatfon went down himfelf to Lieutenant William Brereton, who commanded the lower deck battery, and ordered him particularly to direft his fire againO: thofe guns, and' they were accordingly foon afterwards filenced. At eight in the morning, feveral of the enemy's fhot ftruck the Kent at the fame time; one entered near the foremaft, and fet fire to two or three 32 pound cartridges of gunpowder, as the boys held them in their hands ready to charge the guns. By the explofion, the wad-nets, and other loofe things, took fire between decks, and the whole fhip was io filled with fmoke, that the men in their confufion cried out, fhe was on fire in the gunner's flore- room •, imagining from the fhock they had felt from the balls, that a fhell had actually fallen into her. This notion ftruck a panic into the greatefl: part of the crew, and 70 or 80 jumped out of the port-holes into the boats that were a long fide the fhip. The French prefently faw this confufion on board the Kent, and refolving to take the advantage, kept up as hot a fire as poflible upon her during the whole time. Lieutenant Br ere ton however, with the afliftance of feme other brave men, loon extinguifhed the fire, and then running to the ports, he begged the feamen to come in again, upbraiding them for deferting their quarters : but finding this had no efFe6l upon them, he thought the more certain method of fucceeding would be to ftrike them with a fenfe of fhame, and therefore loudly ex claimed, ' Are you Britons ? Tou Engli[hmen, and fly from danger ? For jhame, for ,Jhame !' This reproach had the'defired effect •, to a man they imme diately returned into the fliip, repaired to their quarters, and renewed a fpirited fire on the enemy. In about three hours from the commencement of the attack, the parapets of the north and fouth baftions were almoft beaten down •, the guns were moftly difmounted; and we-could plainly fee ftom the main top of the Keni, that the ruins from the parapet and merlons had entirely blocked up thole few guns which otherwile might have been fit for fervice. We could eafily difcern too that there had been a great Daughter among the enemy; who finding that our fire againft them rather &gt;increafed, hung out the white flag; Whereupon a ceffation of hoftilities took place, and the ad miral fent Lieutenant Brereton (the only commilfion officer on board the Kent that was not killed or wounded) and Captain Coote of the King's * Our fliips lay fo near to the fort, that the mufket-balls fired from their tops, by flriking againft the Chunam walls of the Governor's palace, which was in the very center of the tort, were beaten as flat as a half-crown, S regiment \I k I [ 13° ] t „ rTt realment, with a flag of truce to the fort, who foon returned i accompanied ' - ^ ^ the f r encb Governor's fon, with articles of capitulation, which being f/rded by the admirals and colonel, we foon afterwards took poffeflion of the place.

We never could learn how many of their men Were killed and wounded in the whole; tho* they confeflfed that they had forty carried off dead from the S, E. bafti6n. The north-eaft baftion was alfo cleared of its defendants twice, and among many others that were wounded there, was one Lee, a corporal and deferter from the Tyger, who pledged himfelf to the enemy that he would throw two fhells out of three into the Tyger ; but while he was bringing the mortars to bear for that purpofe, he was difabled by a mufket-bullet from the Kent's top.—He was afterwards fent home a prifoner to England.[ I 3 2 1 On onr fide three of the Kent's lower deck guns were difmonnted, and the fame number on the upper deck. The fhip received 138 cannon Ihot through her fide next the fort, befides being greatly damaged in her mafts and rio-mncr. Thirty-feven men were killed upon the fpot in her, and 74 wounded in a greater or lefs degree. Among the dead was Mr. Perreau the admiral's firft lieutenant, who fell in the bloom ot youth, unfpeakably lamented by us all. Mr. Rawlins Hey, our third lieutenant, and much of the fame a?e as Perreau, loft his thigh,, and died on the 31(1 of March at the hofpital, not lefs regretted than Perreau. Captain Speke was dan r creroufly wounded in the leg, and the fame (hot carried off the thigh of his fon Mr. William Speke, who afterwards died of the wound. Mr. Stan ton, our fecond lieutenant, received many contufions, but he foon got the better of them. Mr. Marriot, a midfhipman, was wounded in the thio-h, but not mortally. Mr. Wood, another midihipman, was {lightly wounded. Mr. James Lifter, under-fecretary to the admiral, as he was (landing by him taking minutes, was wounded in the leg; and Mr. Banes the purler,' received a violent contufion in both his thighs from the wind of a ball, 'which paffed very near^ but did not ftrike him. The number of the flain on board the Tyger almoft equalled thofe of the Kent. Admiral Pocock himfelf was (lightly wounded, but Mr. Phillips themafter, mortally, and his mate Mr. P^r loft an arm. Mr. Wilkinfin, Mr. Thompfon, and Mr. Grihble, midfliipmen, were alio wounded. The whole number fent to the hofpital from this fhip was forty-one. In which were included a few volunteers from his majefty's frigate and floop, who had been permitted to aft this day on board the 'Tyger under the com mand of the Bridgewaters Lieutenant Mr. Charles Saxtcn, a young gentle man then lately promoted to the rank of a commiftion officer by Admiral Wat fon, and diftinguifhed for his alacrity in offering himfelf as a volunteer on every emergent occafion. Every humane bofom muft needs commilerate the death of fo many gal lant Britijh youth, as fell in this day's aftion. The killed and wounded indeed on Ihore were trifling •, the enemy were fo much employed againft the fhips, that the army had but one killed, and 10 wounded •, but on board the two (hips they were fo numerous, that I would willingly forbear any farther mention of fuch a mournful fcene •, but the behaviour of Captain Speke and his fon, a youth of 16 years of age, was fo truly great and exemplary on this glorious but melancholy occafion, that I muft beg leave to defcribe it, with fome of it's moft interefting circumftances. When Admiral Wat fon had the unhappinefs to fee both the father and fon fall in the fame inftant; he immediately went up to them, and by the moft tender and pathetic expreffions tried to alleviate their diftrefs. The captain, who had obferved his ion's leg to be hanging only by the fkin, faid to the admiral, ' Indeed, Sir, this was a cruel Ihot, to knock down both the father and the fon !' Mr. Watforfs heart was too full to maketotlieM 11 ■ C 133 ] - . , the leaft reply, he only ordered them both to be immediately carried ro the furgeon. The captain was firft brought down to me in the after-hold, v where a platform had been made, and then told me how dangeroufly his poor Billy was wounded. Frefently after, the brave youth himfelf appeared, but had another narrow efcape, the quarter-mailer, who was bringing him down in his arms after his father, being killed by a cannon ball : his eyes o'erfiowino- with tears, not for his own y but for his father's fate, I laboured to affure him, that his father's wound was not dangerous, and this affertion was confirmed by the captain himfelf. He feemed not to believe either of us- until he afked me upon my honour, and I had repeated to him my firft afTurance in the moft pofitive manner. He then immediately became calm • but on my attempting to enquire into the condition of his wound, he folicitoufly afked me, if I had dreffed his father, for he could not think of my touching him, before his father's wound had been, taken care of. I affured him, that the captain had been already properly attended to ; ^ Then-, (replied the generous youth, pointing to a fellow iufterer) Pray, Sir, look ' to and drefs this poor man, luho is groaning fo fadly he fide me / ^ I told him that he already had been taken care of, and begged of him wita fome importunity that I now might have liberty to examine his wound : hefubmitted to it, and calmly obferved, ' Sir, I fear you muft amputate above the joint r I replied, my dear, 1 muft !— Upon which, he claiped both his hands together, and lifting his eyes in the moft devout and fer vent manner towards heaven, he offered up the following fhort, but earneft petition ■ ' Good God, do thou enable me to behave in my prefenl circtmftances, ' wor.hy my Father's fort !' When he had ended this ejaculatory prayer; he told me that he was all fubmiffion. 1 then performed the operation above the joint of the knee ; but during the whole time the intrepid youth never fpake a word,, or uttered a groan that could be heard at a yard diftance. The reader may eafily imagine, what, in this dreadful interval, the brave, but unhappy captain fuflered, who lay juft by- his unfortunate and darlincr fon. But whatever were his feelings, we difcovered no othe? expreflions of them, than what the filent, trickling tears declared •, though the bare recolleffion of the fcene, even at this diftant time, is too painful for me.^—Both the father and the fon, the day after the aftion, were fent with the reft of the wounded back to Calcutta. 1 he father was lodged at the houfe of Wilmm Mackett, Efq-, his brother-in-law •, and the fon was with me at the hofpital. For the firft eight or nine days, I gave the father preat comfort, by carrying him joyful tidings of his boy •, and in the lame manner I gratified the fon in regard to the father. But alas . from that time, all the good fymptoms which had hitherto attended this unpaialleicu youth, began to diiappear! The captain eafily gueffed, by my filence and countenance, the true ftate his boy was in •, nor did he ever after afk me more than two queftions concerning him*, fo tender was the fnbjeft to us both, and fo unwilling was his generous mind to add to my diftrefs. The fnil, was on the tenth day, in thefe words, ' How long, my friend, do you think my 4 i ' My l 7 57'[ 134 ] Billy may remain in a ft ate of uncertainty?' I replied, that ' If he lived &gt; to the 15th day from the operation, there would be the ftrongeft hopes of his recovery.' On the 13th however he died; and on the 16th the brave man looking me ftedfaftly in the face, faid, ' Well, Ives, how fares ' it with my hoy ?' I could make him no reply ; and he immediately ^attributed my filence to the real caufe. He cried bitterly, fqueezed me by the hand, and begged me to leave him for one half hour, when he wifhed to fee me again ; and aflured me, that I fhould find him with a different countenance, from that he troubled me with at prefent.—Thefe were his obliging expreflions.—I pundually complied with his defire; and when I returned to him, he appeared, as he ever after did, perfedly calm and ferene. The dear youth had been delirious the evening preceding the day on which he died-, and at two o'clock in the .morning, in the utmoft diftrefs of mind, he lent me an incorred note, written by himfelf with a pencil, of which the following is an exad copy. ' If Mr. Ives will confider the diforder ' a fon muft be in, when he is told he is dying, and is yet in doubt whether his ' father is net in as good a ft ate of health. If Mr. Ives is not too hufte to honour this chitt *, which nothing hut the great eft uneafinefs could draw from me. The boy waits an anfwer' Immediately on the receipt of this note, I vifited him, and he had ftill fenfe enough left to know who I was. He then began with me.—' And is he dead? —Who my dear? My father. Sir' No, my love; nor is he in any danger, I aflure you ; he is almoft well. ' Thank ' God!—then why did they tell me fo? I am now fatisfied, and ready to die.' At that time he had a locked jaw, and was in great diftrefs, but I under- llood every word he fb inarticulately uttered: he begged my pardon, for having (as he obligingly and tenderly expreffed himfelt) difturbed me at fo early an hour, and before the day was ended, furrendered up a valuable life. The following exquifite fimile fo finely illuftrates the beauty and un timely death of this incomparable young man, that I am perfuaded every good-natured reader will excufe my inferting it.

Captain[ '35 ] Captain Speke was confined to his bed and chamber, for fome weeks after the adtion, nor did he perfedly recover from his wound; at times he was much indifpofed, and in a great deal of danger. While incapable of duty, the admiral ordered his firft lieutenant Mr. John Gierke to take upon him the command. At length, the 7^/being condemned as unferviceable, the captain took his paffage to England in one of our Eaji India company's fhips •, leaving behind him the charader of, a fenfible and complete gentle man, as well as the gallant and Ikilful fea officer. He afterwards com manded the Refolution of 70 guns in the memorable engagement off Bellifle^ when Sir Edward Hawke defeated the French fleet, and particularly diftin- guifhed himfelf by obliging the Formidable to ftrike to him, though a fhip fuperior in force to his own. The Refolution in the night fucceeding the adion, was wrecked on a fhoal called Le'Four, but the captain with the crew were providentially faved. Captain tyeke afterwards returned to Eng land^ and for a while enjoyed in quiet thofe applaufes which the public juftly beftowed on his fuperior merit. He was afterwards appointed cap tain of the Modefte^ and once more went to fea but before he could render any farther fervices to his country, he died at Lijhon in the 43d year of his age, to the great grief of all his acquaintance, but efpecially of thofe whom he had honoured and made happy with a more intimate fhare of his friendfhip.

The generous and humane Cap- tain Ipeh having heard of the hard fate of Monf. took care to reoreient it to the two admirals in all its affedting drcumftances; who im mediately advanced the fum of 1500 rupees each. Their example was followed'by the five captains of the fquadron, who fubfcrmed 5000 between them Mr Doidre added 800 more; and the fame fum was thrown in by another perfon, who was a fincere well-wi(her to this unfortunate gentle man: fo that a prefent of 9600 rupees, or 1200/. fterhng, was in a few minutes collefted towards the relief this valuable and his diftreffed family. One of the company was prefently difpatched with this money, who had orders to acquaint Monf.

I have now the pleafure to acquaint you, that on the 23d of this month, after two hours fighting, we, by the bleffing of God, and the happy influence of your fortune and friendfhip, fubdued and took poffeflion of the French fort, making our enemies prifoners, except a fmali number who fled up the river with their effefts. I have fent a few armed men to feize them •, and I perfuade myfelf you will not be difpleafed at this ftep, fince I have given the ftridteft orders not to moleft or difturb any of your fubjedls. I have often declared to you my unalterable refolution of ftriflly adher ing to the treaty made between us ; and as we have fworn reciprocally that the enemies of either fliould be efteemed the enemies of both, I hope, by your favour, the enemies I have now remaining will be delivered into my hands, together with their effeds. T Thet n* 1 The moment I received your letter complaining of Mr. Drake 's having acWrefied himfelf to Monichchund m a manner difpleafing to you, 1 wrote to Mr. Drake and defired he would make an apology to you tor the expreffions he had made ufe of to Monichchund •, which he has done, and I hope you are fatisfied therewith: you may reft allured, you will have no eaufe- of fuch complaint for the future. I obferve by your letter of the 22d of this month, that you were under a neceflity of fending your brother Raja Roy Bullubram Bahader into the Burdwan country, to coifed the revenues which Monichchund excufed himfelf from paying : as you have given me your word, that this is the purpofe of his march it ?s not 'in the power of any artful defigmng villain to make me believe the contrarv •, and as it will be evermore my firft principle to pro- mote and eftablifh the friendfhip made between us, I lhall be very cautious how I give credit to any idle Itories, tending to break the unity, which I hope wTll endure for ever between you and the Englijh. I am fenfible our nation has many enemies at your court i but as you are a wife and prudent prince, I hope you will in time difcover all the wickednefs of thofe, who by afferting for pofitive truths what have appeared to be notorious falihoods, have attempted to injure us in your opinion. As I know your eais have been filled with evil reports of us, and you will ftill be fubjed to hear the ftories of fuch deceivers, the Major will be fent to you : receive what he may fay, as my fentiments, and be aflured you (hall not be deceived. What can I fay more ?' This letter not producing the defired effe&lt;5l, and being too well convinced, that the Nabob had hoftile intentions in his breatt j for, inftead of delivering he correfponded with and protected our French enemies, the admirtii addrefled another letter to him, dated the 3111 of March y 1757. ' I HAVE already informed you of our conqueft of Chandernagore, and making all the French our prifoners, except fome fugitives who fled up the river, after whom, I told you 1 had fent fome armed men in boats. I am forry I fhould be under a neceflity of fending you another letter ; but having received information that you have not as yet performed your agreement, 1 muft take leave to acquaint you, that from the repeated promifes you have made of keeping your word in every refpeft, I now exped* you will ad conform able to the oath you have taken before God and your Prophet, and comply Immediately with all the articles of the treaty. Deliver alio the cannon to Mr. which you now have belonging to the company •, and ftridly keep to the oath we have both fworn, of living in friendfliip, and efteeming each other's enemies our own-, and deliver up into my hands all the F/minn your dominions, with their efleds. This will be keeping your oath, and behaving like a prince, whole purfuit is juftice, and whofe utmofl; glory as a foldier, is preferving his word inviolable. Depend upon it, if there are any about you bold enough to advife you to ad contrary to thefe juft demands, theyC 139 ] they are your enemies, and want to fee your country involved in a ruinous 1757. war, which nothing but your breach of promife, of faith, and of honour, ' ^ fliall ever prevail on me to engage in. Nothing will give me more fatisfac- tion, than the being aflTured that continual peace and friendfhip will for ever laft between you and the Englijh. Since I began this letter, I am informed the fugitive French have offered to enter into your fervice. If you accept this offer, I fhall conclude that you intend to favour the French, and defire to live no longer in friendftnp with me-, efpecially as you have declined the afliftance of the Englijh troops, after ftrongly foliciting them.' The admiral, not able to obtain any anfwer^ either in words or deeds s fent another letter. The Admiral to the Nabob. Kent, off Chandernagore, zd of April 17 57. ' I HAVE been informed, that you exprefs fome uneafinefs at our fhips remaining at this fettlement, and at our army being encamped near Houghley. I find that our enemies have taken the advantage of your un- eafinefs, and endeavoured to perfuade you our troops propofe marching up in a hoftile manner againfl: you to Muxadabad. It is amazing to me, that any one fliould dare to impofe fo grofsly on your underftanding, without trembling at the confequence, fhould his villainous arts be difcovered. And it alfo furprizes me, that you fhould hearken to fuch idle ftories. You, as a foldier, muft know, that while I have enemies yet in your dominions, it would be very impolitic in me not to purfue them. _ Yet, if you will deliver up my enemies and their effeds to me, my (hips and troops lhall immediately return to Calcutta ; and then, and not before, ihall I be con vinced of your fincerity and refolution in abiding by the oath, you have taken, of regarding my enemies as your own.' The day after the forwarding of the above, the admiral received the fol lowing letter from the Nabob, though dated the ill of Rajub, or 22d of March 1757. m ' W H AT I have promifed, and fet my hand to, I will firmly maintain, nor in any refpe6t deviate therefrom. All Mr. Watts's demands, and what- foever he has reprefented to me, I have complied with, and what remains, fhall be given up by the 15th of this moon. This, Mr. JVatts muft have written to yon, with all the particulars •, but notwithftanding all this, it appears to me from many inftances, that you feek to obliterate your agreement with me. The country within the territories ot Houghly, Ingely, Burdwan and Nuddea, have been ravaged by your troops. For what T 2 caufe[ Ho ] *757- caufe is this ? Add to this, that Govendram Metre wrote to Nundcomar by the fon of RamdenGofe, requiring him to deliver Colliganty as belonging to the diftri&lt;5ts of Calcutta, into his the faid Metre's poflefTion. What is the mean ing of this ? lam fure this has been done without your knowledge, la confidence of your engagement, I made peace; with the view of procuring the welfare of the country, and to prevent the ruinous confequences which would befal the royal territories from both armies, and not that the people fliould be trampled upon, and the revenues obftrufled. Your endeavours fhould be daily to ftrengthen more and more the friencl- fhip which has taken root betwixt us, and to that end put a ftop to the influence of this mifchief-maker, and difcountenance the aforefaid Metre in fuch manner, that he may not dare to fay thefe things, nor be guilty of fuch falfe proceedings for the future. By the will of God, the agreement fhall never be infringed upon my part. I have fpoken to Mr. Watts fully on this fubjed:; the particulars of which you will have in his letter. P. S. 1 have juft learned that the French are bringing a large force from the Deccan, to make war againft you; for this reafon I write to you, that if you Hand in need of any forces of the government for your fupport, you will immediately acquaint me, and they ftiall be ready to join you whenever you fhall have occafion for them,' This produced the following reply. 'The Admiral to the Nabob. Dated Calcutta, 3d oi April, 1757. tc THE letter you did me the honour to write the 22d of laft month, did not come to my hands till this day. As the fubjeft of it required an anfwer as foon as poffible, I make no doubt but you have been furprized at not having found any thing in my three laft letters relating thereto. But this informs you of the true reafon, and 1 hope will latisfy you of my readi- nefs always to acknowledge the receipt of your favours. ' The affurances you continue to give me, or firmly maintaining the agreement between us; makes me hope \ou will hiten to all the juft demands I have made in my laft letteis, as the delivering up my enemies into my hands with all their effefts, and complying with all the articles of the treaty: the latter parr, you promiie me Hi all be done the 15th of this Mocn^ which will be to-mor- r 0 ^! W ]^ en ^ ^ 0 P e .^ F • Watts will be able to write, and affure me you have lurfilled jour promife. 'iou tell me, that notwithftanding the order you ave given for every thing being complied with, and fixing the day for its eing done, yet it appears to you from many inftances that I intend to break my agreement. You muft luffer me to tell you, that your apprehenfions my not ftndlly abiding by the treaty I have made, are founded on falfe repre-[Hi I reprefentationj, made to you by Monichchund, to excufe himfelf from paying 1757. the revenues of the feveral countries you fay have been pillaged by the -v— Englijh.. How can this poffibly be ? When the Englijh troops, fince the happy peace made with you, have penetrated no farcher into the Burdwan country, than marching from Bankehujar to Chandernagore along fliore ; and iince the conquefl: of the French^ a few armed men were fent after fome fugitives a little way, but they have been ordered back fome time iince, and are returned. Of this, upon very little rcfleftion, you muft be fenfible; why then will you hearken to thofe who ftek every opportunity to de ceive you, and make you believe fuch things as are in their nature impof- lible ? For how could the territories of Hcughly, Ingely, Burdwan and Nud* dea, be ravaged by our troops, when the troops have been no farther than I have aiTured you ? I am afraid the perfon who dares attempt the impofmg on you fo grofs a falfhood as this, has reafon to think you may be eafily per- fuaded into the belief of any thing, that would ferve as a pretence for your difpleafure againft the Englijh \ otherwife, I think no one would pre- fqme to fiU your ears with fuch falfe and idle ftories. What you tell me relating to Govendram Metre^ you do me great juftice in believing he has aded in the manner he did, without my knowledge. You may be affured, I will take pains to enquire into every circumftance of that matter, and will fee that ftrift juftice is done to you, and give Metre a-fevere rebuke for his late behaviour. Need 1 give you any. farther affurances of my immoveable refolution ftridlly to regard our treaty, and every moment to improve the friendfhip growing up between us ? I hope not. I would, willingly believe, you now know me fufficiently to place a confidence in what I lay, without having any doubts of being deceived -, which you may depend upon you never fhall by me : deceit is deteftable in the heart of an honeft man, and much too low a pradice for the true foldier to ftoop to. Give me leave to render you my thanks for your intelligence concerning t-he French from the Deccan, and your readrnefs in offering me affiftance, it I fhould havQ occafion. Should the French leave the Deccan, and come into this country with fuch a number as to make the jundtion of our troops neceffary, I then will do myfelf the honour to write to you on that bufinefs. In the mean time, if you would wifh to preferve peace in your country, deliver up my enemies into my hands, and by that means they will be lefs able to oppofe me^ if fuch a force fhould arrive. This will convince me of the fmcerity of your offer. It is now in your power to fettle everlafting ■peace in your country, and if you fuffer the opportunity to fljp, it may never offer again. You fee that God, by whofe po#. T er all human events are determined, has given me the victory over my enemies. He feeth the juftnefs of my caufe, and therefore fighteth for me. Hefitate then no longer about the things I have written to you, but openly fulfill the oath you made before God and your Prophet, of making my enemies your own; and let us evermore become as one people. Then, we fhall fee peace and tranquilky[ 142 ] tranquility will flourlfh ; for our enemies beholding us cemented in unity, will not venture to bring war into the country. Refleft on what I have written, and be aflured nothing is fo much my defire, as to fee peace and concord perfedly fettled throughout the whole kingdom •, and to give you the ftrongeft proof of my fincerity, I have ordered the King's (hips down to Calcutta, as I heard fuch a meafure would be acceptable to you. W hat can I say more ?' After a great many inward druggies, and ftill diffembling his refentment, the Nabob fent the following anfwer. The Nabob to the Admiral, dated i\th of April, 1757. &lt;c YOUR letters at feveral times, I have received, with the news of your health, which has given me great pleafure. The purport of them 1 have duly underftood *, and for your fatisfaclion, and in obftrrvance of the agree ment between us, to look upon each others enemies as our own, I have ex pelled Mr. Law with all his adherents from my country, and have given ftricl orders to all my Naibs ami Fougedars not to permit them to remain in any part of my dominions. I am ready upon all occafions to grant you my affiftance. If the French ever enter the province with a great or fmall force, with a defign of making war upon you ; God and his Prophets are between us, that whenever you write to me, I will be your ally, and join you with all my force. Reft fatisfied in this point, and be allured of my refolution to remain inviolably by the promifes which I have made in my letters, and in the treaty concluded betwixt us. With regard to the French fadlories and merchandize, I muft acquaint your excellency, that I have been informed, the French company are indebted to the natives, and have feveral Lacks belonging to my fubjeds in their hands fhould I comply with your demands in delivering up the effeds, how can I anfwer it to the creditors of the French ? Your excellency is my well-wifher and my friend; weigh all this aifair, and return me your anfwer, tha-t I may ad accord ingly. 1 have written before, and now repeat, that if the Englijh company want to eftablifh their trade, do not write me what is not conformable to our agreement, by the inftigation of felf-interefted and defigning men, who want to break the peace between us. If you are not difpofed to come to a rupture with me, you have my agreement under my hand and feal; when you write, look upon^that, and write accordingly. Mr. Watts will inform you fully of all particulars ; What fliall I write more ? If you desire to maintain the peace, write nothing contrary to the treaty.' This -[ '+3 J This letter, and dally infliances of the Nabob's perftdious and hoftile in tentions, engaged the Admiral to addrefs the Nabob more plainly in a letter dated April 19th, 1757* ' I AM honoured with your letter of the 14th of thi» month, acquaint- in^ me with your having received at feveral times the letters I lately wrote you. Your forbearance, and not writing to me, hath not the appearance of that friendihip, you would perfuade me you have for my countrymen ; and with regard to myfelf, I muft, take the liberty to fay, I was more parti cularly entitled to a fpeedy anfwer to my letters, from my high rank and. ftation ; and I cannot help looking upon your negled in this refpedl, but as a flight offered to the King my mailer, who fent me into India to proted: his fubje&amp;s, and demand jultice wherefoever they were opprefled. I obferve in your letter the following particulars, viz. ' That for my fatis- faftion and according to our mutual agreement to look upon each others ene mies as our own, you have expelled Monfieur Law and his adherents from your dominions, and given Itrift orders, &amp;c. &amp;:c.' My brother Mr. Watts^ who is entrufted with all the company's concerns^ always writes me the parti culars of your intended favours towards us; but I have never found that : what he writes is put in execution, neither do I find that what you wrote- me in your letter dated the ift of Rajub (22d of March) is yet complied with. You therein affured me, that you would fulfill all the articles you had agreed to, by the 15th of that Moon. Have you ever yet complied with them all ? No. How then can I place any confidence in what you write, when your adlions are not correfpondent with your promifes ? Or how can I reconcile your telling me in fo facred a manner, you will be my ally, and aflift me with your forces againft the French? when you have given a Ferwannah to Mr. Law and his people to go towards Fatna^ in order to efcape me, and tell me it is for my fatisfadion, and in obfervance of the mutual agreement, you have taken this meafure. Is this an aft of friendihip ? Or is it in this manner I am to underftand you will aftift me ? Or am I to draw a conclufion from what you write, or from what you do? You are too wife not to know when a man tells you one thing, and does the direft contrary, which you ought to believe. Why then do you en deavor to perfuade me you will be my friend, when at the fame time you give my enemies your protedion, furnifh them with ammunition, and fuffer them to go out of your dominions with three pieces of cannon ? Their effects I efteem a trifling circumftance, and as far as they will contribute to do juftice to your people, who are creditors to the company, I have no objection to your fcizing them for their ufe, for money is what I defpife, and accumulating riches to myfelf is what L did not come here for. But I have already told you, and now repeat it again, that while a Frenchman remains in this kingdom, 1 will never ceafe purfuing him \ but if they will deliver themfelves up, they Ihall find me merciful; and I am 4, confidentI r 4.4* ] ^rn. confident thofe who Rave already fallen into my hands, will do me the juf- J t ice to fay, they have been treated with a much greater generofity, than is ufual by the general cuftom of war. If you will reflet upon the oath you have taken, you cannot but join with me in what follows : As foon as Cqffimhuzar is properly garrifoned, to which place our troops will fpeedily begin their march, I defire you will grant a Duftuck for the pafiage of two thoufand of our foldiers by land to Patna. You may be affured they will do no violence, nor commit the lead injury to the natives : the only defign of fending them is to feize the French, and reftore tranquility and perfed peace in your kingdom, which can never be truly eftablifhed in thele dominions, while a war continues between us and them. If you are apprehenfive of any injury arifing to your fubjeds from the march of our troops to Patna, fend fome of your trufty Hircars to go with them, with orders to acquaint you from time to time of their tranfac- tions, and 1 dare anfwer you will find their reports agreeable to what I now write you. Inftead of fending Mr. Watts only ten guns, why did you not deliver up all that belonged to the company ? I will not write you what is not conform able to our agreement, and which you fuppofe was by the inftigation of felf-interefled and defigning men : I muft take the liberty to fay, I never yet have written a fyllable contrary to our agreement, and the oath and promife I have made i and be affured it is not in the power of any artful or defigning men to make me write any thing inconfiftent with my honour. I afk nothing more than your fulfilUng the articles of your agree ment, and abiding by the oath you have taken : This I have ftrongly urged you to do, becaufe you have been very flow in the execution, and this llirely 1 have a right to demand, fo long as you negle&lt;fb to perform it. If it is difagreeable to you to hear thefe things, put it out of my power ever to afk again, by your immediate compliance j and as you have defired me when I write, to look upon our agreement, and take that for my guide, let me requeft you to compare my letters with my agreements, and with what you have promifed, and when you find me differ from that, or afk any thing contrary to it, then tax me therewith; point out to me exprefly, where- Jn I have deviated from this rule, and you fhall find me ready to confefs it as an error : but till then, you mufl; exctife me for infilling on your having charged me wrongfully, and whidi upon an examination of my lette.rs, I make no doubt will appear to you too plain to be contradi(5ted. l.et me again repeat to yon, I have no other views than that of peace. The gathering together of riches is what I defpifc ; and I call on God, rvuo fees and knows the Ipring ot ail our actions, and to whom you and muu: one day anlwer, to witnefs to the truth of what I now write; therefore it you would have me believe that you wifh peace as much as I do, no onger Jet it be the lubject of our correfpondence, for me to afk for the u ti mem of the treaty, and you to promife and not perform it; but im^ ^ mediately[ h5 J mediately fulfill all your engagements: thus let peace flourifli and fpread 1757 throughout all your country, and make your people happy in the re-efta- blifhment of their trade, which has fuffered by a ruinous and deflrudlivc war. What can I fay more ?' After this letter, the correfpondence ceafed on the part of the admiral i and from the date thereof, to the month of June, the Nabob continued to give full proofs of his enmity towards us, and his defign to embrace the firft convenient opportunity of extirpating us. Hoftile preparations were now made on each fide j and on the 13th of June things drew near to a crifis, when the Nabob fent the following, and his laft letter to the admiral. 25th of Ramazan (13th of June) 1757. 'ACCORDING to my promifes, and the agreement made between us, I have duly rendered every thing to Mr. Watts, except a very fmall re mainder, and had almoft fettled Monichchund's affair : Notwithftanding ail this, Mr. JVatts and the reft of the council of the fadory at Caffimhuzar, under pretence of going to take the air in their gardens, fled away in the night. This is an evident mark of deceit, and of an intention to break the treaty. I am convinced it could not have happened without your know ledge, nor without your advice. I all along expedled fomething of this kind, and for that reafon I would not recall my forces from Plajfey, exped- ing fome treachery. I praife God, that the breach of the treaty has not been on my part: God and his Prophet have been witneffes to the contrad made between us, and whoever firft deviates from it will bring upon themfelves the punilhment due to their ad ions.' 1 &gt; W By the letters, as well as by a multiplicity of fads, it is evident that Serajah Dowlah, from the time of figning the treaty with us, had iliewh himfeif but little inclined to abide by any of it's articles 5 it was indeed in tended by him to lull us into a fatal fecurity. He was very liberal in his promifes, but always took care to put off the perfornfance of them, and that upon fuch trifling pretences, as demonftrated his ill intentions towards us. His pofitive orders at firft, that we Ihould not befiege Chandefnagore^ ftrongly indicated his attachment to our enemies ; though, after we had taken that place, he put the beft face he could upon it, and pretended that he was not difpleafed at our fuccefs. We were not ignorant however, that he had ordered a body of near 2000 men to the affiftance of that garrifon, who might have greatly obftruded if not defeated our enterprize, had we not found means to prevent their ading. It is certain, that a French corps under the command of Monfieur Law, was proteded by him, and even in his pay; and that he had invited Buffy with the French army to enter U Bengal[ '46 ] Bengal againft us. Befides thefe inftanccs of his ill difpofition towards us, it is to be remarked, that although four months were elapfed, the material points of the treaty were not fulfilled; and even his lolemn engagement to reftore to the company the villages which of right belonged to them, was evaded, without framing an excufe for fuch an atrocious breach of faith. The Englijh in this fituation faw no other remedy for their prefent griev ances, nor any other means of preventing the fatal blow of extirpation, which was to be expefted on the arrival of the French army, than by op- pofing openly the man who was thus planning the ruin of the company 's affairs, and only waited for the return of the fquadron to the coaft of Coro. mandel, to effed it. This point was much agitated in the council, and can- vaffed with all that caution and circumfpedion, which a matter of fuch. confequence required. It certainly was a very difficult and dangerous meafure, and perhaps would never have been carried into execution, had not a moft fortunate incident happened, which almoft infured fuccefs. Serajah Dowlah, after his taking Calcutta^ had behaved with fuch in- folence and cruelty towards his own lubjetfls, that feveral of the Grandees or confidcrable perfons of his court entered into a confederacy to depofe him. He had difplayed the feverity of his nature in fo many inftances, as to ftrike an univerfal terror; and from the ficklenefs of his difpofition, no man who was near him, and in his power, could think himfelf fafe. Meer Jafier AH Khan, a man of great power and influence, (and who had mar ried the filler of Serajah\ predeceffor and grandfather, AHverdy Khan) con- dudted the defign of depriving the Nabob of that power, he had fo egre- gioufly abufed •, he was feconded in it by Roydulluh, general of hori^, and by Jugget-Seet, who was banker to the Nabob, and efteemed the richefb merchant in all India. Thefe three leading men foon communicated their defigns to Mr. JVatts the Englijh refident at the Durbar or Nabob's court, and he to Colonel Clive and the fecret committee at Calcutta. The chiefs there did not hefltate long about coming into the fcheme. Great dexterity, as well as fecrefy, being neceflary in executing the plan for a revolution, the whole management thereof, was left to Colonel Clive, and to Mr. Watts. To avoid fulpicion, it was necefTary that Mr. IVatts Ihould -not be obferved to have frequent intercourfe with Jaffier: he therefore entrufted one Omichund a Gentoo merchant with the fecret, and through him carried on his correfpondence with Meer Jaffier. Omichund was a man of the deepcfl cunning and mofl: infatiable avarice, and ftrongly fuf- pefted to ha ve been the principal perfon that fomented the late troubles againft the Englijh,^ in hopes ot pecuniary advantages to himfelf: Mr. Watts did not lufficiently know the man till too late. Omichund, after the plot was fo tar advanced, that a treaty was juft on figning with Meer t- k ' unr ? fonabl y demanded a quarter part of all the Nabob's, treafure,. which was fuppoied to amount to 64 Crore, or 80 millions fterling. His[ '47 ] finai terms were 30 of Rupees for himfelf, by a fpecial article in the treaty ; and he made no fcruple to aflure Mr. Watts* that if his demand was not complied with, he would inftantly inform the Naloh of our fehemes, when every Englijhman within his reach would certainly be put to the fevereft: death. In this dilemma, Mr. Watts applied to Meer Jafier, who was deter mined not to accede to fuch terms, if any means of obviating them could be devifed. Mr. Watts then wrote to the feledl committee, who feeing that the fate of all depended upon temporizing with Omichund, and being at the fame time very averfe to fubmit to the extortions of fuch a confummate •rogue, contrived that two treaties fhould be executed and fent up to Meer Jaffier, who was to be let into the fecret. One treaty was the real one to be abided by ; the other was fictitious, but with no other difference than that it contained the article of 30 Lack for Omichund. The real treaty wts executed privately by Meer Jaffier ; the fictitious treaty was executed alfo by him, and in the prefence of Omichund* who was thereupon perfeflly fatisfied. It may be neceffary here alfo to obferve, that this fictitious treaty was figned by Colonel Clive and all the feleCl committee: Admiral Wat fan did not chufe to fign it, becaufe he had figned the real treaty. A ftrid principle of delicacy, which in him was fuperior to any point of policy, operated too ftrongly on his mind to permit him to join even in a neceflary decep tion of this nature : however, while he manifefted no difpleafure againft the actors, all clafles of people, from their knowledge of Omichnnd's ava rice and treachery, applauded the artifice by which he was fo defervedly outwitted. T reatv executed hy Meer Mahomed Jaffier Khan Bahadar, with Admifal Watfon, Colonel Clive, and the Counfellors Drake and Watts. I swear by G od, and the P rophet of G od, to abide by the terms of this treaty while J have life *. A rt. I.

That thefe were but trifles however, compared to his open and avowed protedion of the king's enemies, of which his letters to Monf. Bujfy, wrote but a few days after his entering into a folemn treaty with us, inviting him to his country, was a flagrant proof: that his protedion and allowance of ten thoufand rupees per month to Monf. Law, and many other circumftances, were not only fo many deviations from the treaty, but evidently fhewed his excellency's intention to fall upon the Englijh, as foon as the abfence of their troops and fleet might expofe them to it; that the main article of the treaty was infringed, in his proffering only a fifth part of the fum paid into the treafury, for the plunder of Calcutta, and yetr demanding a difcharge for the whole.' The colonel complained bitterly of fo many infults put upon him, and reminded the Souhahdar how different his own condud was y when called upon to alfift him againft the Pytans. He folemnly declared, that his intentions were to have fought for him to the laft drop of his blood ; but feeing his excellency had chofen. his friends from among his enemies, and had in every refped deviated from his engagements, he had determined, with the approbation of all who were charged with the company's affairs, to pro ceed immediately to Cajfmhuzar, and fubmit their difputes to the arbitration of Meer Jaffier, Roydulkb, Jugget-feet, and others of his great men j that if it fhould be found, that Le, the colonel, had deviated from the treaty, he then fwore to give up all farther claims; but that, if it appeared his excellency had broken it, he, fhould then demand fatisfadion for all the loffes fuftained by the Englijh, and all the charges of their army and navy; and concluded with telling him, ' that the rains being fo near, and it requir ing many days to receive aa anfwer, he had found it neceffary to wait upon him immediately *.'* Our army confided of 750 military (including 100 Topajfes) about 150 of the train (including 50 failors with 7 midfhipmen under the command of Lieutenant Hayter), 2100 Sepoys, 8 pieces of cannon fix pounders, and 1 haubitzer. The Europeans and artillery were embarked in boats, and the Sepoys marched on to the northward through Hough ley. The Bridge- water alfo failed up the river as far as Houghley, to keep that place in awe, and to preferve a communication between the colonel and the fquadron. The admiral's firft lieutenant, Mr. John Gierke, with a detachment of 150 feamen, garrifoned Chandernagore, and the fhips effedually fecured Calcutta from * Sera/ton's reflexions on the government of Indoflan. any-1757- [ '5° ] any kind of infulr, while a few Topnjfes were appointed to guard the Frtnth pri Toners. Thcfe previous and judicious mcafures being taken, the army advanced towards Muxadabad, On the 14th of June, Mr. JVatts and other gentlemen,' with 30 foldiers, who had made their elcape from Caffimbuzar, arrived at the army, and on the 18th, Major Coote (lately promoted from the rank of captain) was lent forward with a detachment ot 200 Europeans, 500 Sepoys, one field-piece, and a haubitzer, to reduce Cuiwah, a fort belonging to the Nabob, fituated on the bank of Cajftmbuxar river, about half a mile in circum ference. As he was reconnoitring the place, one of the foldiers of the party fuddenly grew delirious, and while in the agonies of death made fo great a noife, as to difcover to the enemy where they were; on which they began a brifk firing, and obliged the major for the prefent to alter his polition j but he prefently afterwards made a lodgement on a large baftion, and the next day, after fome oppofition, the enemy abandoned the fort, and left to the conqueror 14 pieces of cannon of different calibers, and a large quantity of grain and ammunition. When the army was within two days march of Muxadabad, Colonel Clive received fome difagreeable advices from Meer Jaffier, which he imme diately laid before a council of war fummoned upon the occafion, the majority of whofe members were of the colonel's opinion, that he ought not to advance any farther. He therefore halted where he was, and lent an £xprefs to Calcutta, defiring frefh orders. However, the fame evening Colonel Clive received a fecond meflage from Meer Jaffier, afluring him of his due performance of the articles mentioned in the treaty, but informing him that he was fo furrounded with fpies, as to be obliged to aft with the greateft caution. This intelligence foon determined the colonel to puih on; and that very night, without waiting for any jnftru(5lions from Calcutta, he gave orders for the army to hold themfelves in readinefs to march the next morning, when, leaving a fubaltern officer with all the fick at Cutwah, he broke up his cafrip, and marched towards the enemy, through water almoft to the foldiers middles ; the rainy feafon being now fet in. At 6 o'clock in the morning the army crofled the river, and marched about two miles farther, to a large tope (or grove) where they halted till the evening; about 4 the next morning, the whole army reached Plajj'ey grove, after a very fatiguing march, and through a whole night's rain. Advice having been brought to the colonel, on his arrival at the grove, that the Nabob's vanguard, confiding of 6000 men, was within three miles of our army, he ordered an advance guard of 200 Europeans, and 300 Sepoys, with 2 pieces ot cannon, to poft themfelves at Plajfey houle; and (everal guards of Sepoys, at proper diftances from each other, round the grove. At day-break of the 23d, the Nabob's army was perceived marching out o their lines towards the grove whiqh we were in poflefTion of. Their inten tion[ '5' ] tidn itemed to be to furround us. The colonel hereupon formed his army ; j the Europeans he told off in four divifions j the ifl he put under the command of Major Kilpatrick, the 2d under Major Grant, the 3d under Major Coote, and the 4th under Captain Gaupp. The Sepoys were formed on the right and left. Plajfey-gxove is furrounded by a bank ; our army's left flank was covered by Plajfey-houfe and river, and the right flank by the grove. The enemy's army kept marching towards ours in deep columns, fup- ported by a large train of artillery confifting of 53 pieces of cannon, chiefly of 18, 24 and 32 pounders. Their manoeuvres, upon this occafion, differed materially from thole they had been accuftomed to j for inftead of porting their artillery all together, as was their ufual pradice, they difperfed them between the divifions of their troops, and had not above two or three pieces of cannon on a fpot: fo that an attack upon any one part of their artillery, could not have been decifive. In this order they continued marching as far as the river would permit; but as foon as their rear was gotten out ofc'' the camp, failing in their plan to furround us, they halted •, and a body of about 50 French^, advancing in front of a large detachment of their army commanded by Meer Modun one of their principal generals, with 4 pieces of cannon, lodged themlelves within the banks of a tank (or pond of water) diftant from us about 600 yards, and/began a brifk cannonade. Our little army was at firft drawn up without the bank which furrounded the grove, but Toon found fuch a fhower of balls pouring upon them from the enemy's cannon, that the colonel thought proper they fhould retire under cover of the bank, leaving two field pieces without, while the other four were kept playing through the breaches in the bank. Our left wing was ftill covered by Plajfey houfe, which was about 50 yards diltant, and elofe to the river fide. In this fituation, both armies remained till about 12 o'clock-, when a. heavy fhower of rain falling, the enemy's horfe advanced, as it to take ad vantage of it r but when they found that our field-pieces continued firing, notwithftanding the rain, their ardor was checked. I he rain ceafing,, the cannonading continued till about 3 in the afternoon, when they retired- without confufion to their old camp, their artillery marching firft. And now, a large corps, on the left of our troops, was feen moving in fuch a. manner, as to make it doubtful whether their aim was to poffels themfelves of the village to the left, againft us, or whether they were friends, and: wanted to join our army i but they proved afterw r ards to be friends under Meer Jajjier'% command i however, as no fignal had been agreed on (owing to the mifcarriage of a meffenger which he had difpatched to the colonel in the morning) they were kept at a diftance by our field-pieces. After this retreat of the enemy. Colonel Clvve r leaving orders with Major Kil patrick to fend him notice if the Nabob fhould make any new motions, went into P/a/ey-houk to put on dry cloaths r and confider whether, notwith-^ [ '52 3 I 1757. Handing the fatigue which his troops had already undergone, he fliould i purfue the blow, by an immediate attack upon the Nabob's camp, or defer it till night, when he judged from paft experience the fuccefs would be certain. During this interval, information was brought to the colonel, that a de tachment of our army, with fome field-pieces, was marching towards the before-mentioned tank and eminence, at about the diftance of 600 yards, which had been pofTefied by the French, but who abandoned it when the army of Serajah Bovxlah retired to their camp. Colonel Clive exprefled his furprize, that fuch a itep Ihould have been taken without his orders, and immediately haftened after the detachment, which he reached nearly at the fame time it arrived at the tank. He now found that this detach ment was commanded by Major Kilpatrick^ whom he at firft ordered under .arreflrfor fuch unmilitary conduft, but was pacified by the major's making him an apology. The colonel then ordered Major Kilpatrick back to the grove, and took the command of the detachment himfelf, refolving, fince fuch a ftep had been taken, not to make any retreat, but rather to bring on a fecond adion and make it decifive. He therefore ordered a reinforcement from the main body in the grove i upon which Major Coote with his detachment joined the colonel. 1 he colonel then fent the king's grenadiers, and a grenadier company of Sepoys to lodge themfelves behind a bank that was dole upon the enemy's lines; from whence they kept a continual fire with their fmall arms, as did the detachment at the tank, with four pieces of cannon. In the mean time the enemy's infantry and cavalry pufhed out towards our leveral little bodies of troops, and endeavoured to bring their heavy artillery to bear, but they met with fo warm a reception, and loft fo many draught-oxen and drivers, that they failed in their attempt. When the in fantry and cavalry had faced our troops for fome time, and flood a very .mart cannonading, in which they loft a great number of men and horfes, it was o erved they were in fome confufion, and that their elephants grew veiy unru&gt;. The colonel took immediate advantage of this'critical mo ment, and fent orders to Major Coote to attack a large bodv of horfc and oot upon a n ing ground at about the diftance of 150 yards, and ordered another officer at the fame time to ftorm the angle of the camp. Both thefe attacks fucceeded, the enemy making but a faint refiftance •, Major marched into their ines, and a general rout enfued *. The aflailants pur- j-n. 1 r 11 ' was . a I ' an t: ^ en h a l te d at Doudpore, a place about 6 miles f p / /r f' 16 ' v y here . the y were joined by the reft of the y r m ajfey grove under Major Kilpatrick, who at the commencement through hisThfph^aq ^ m ' in was wou n^ed by a muflcet bullet which went JXabob's army. ' ^ to fhcot one of the French officers ia the of _______f 153 3 ®f the rout received orders from the colonel to march.—The Nabob's army 1757. was computed to confift of 20,000 horfe, and 40,000 foot: our lofs was very inconfiderable but he had about 500 men killed, among whom was Meer Mo dun (whofe death was the occafion of the confufion juft mentioned) be sides 3 elephants, and a great many horfes. Their 53 pieces of cannon, of 18, 24, and 32 pounders, fell into our hands, with their camp, baggage, ele phants^ &amp;c. See.. I have been more minute in the defcription of this battle of Plajfey^ than was Mr. S craft on &gt; becaufe fome perfons have taken great pains to mifprefent it, with a view to tarnifh the glory of Colonel Clive on that important victory j pretending that their accounts were taken verbatim from Sir Eyre Cooteh journal, as read by him to the feled committee of the houfe of commons, which fat the preceding feflions on Eaft India affairs. Hav ing therefore been lately favoured with the perufal of Sir Eyre Coote's jour nal, I can aver, that the feveral publications alluded to, are totally devoid of truth and the public may be aflured that the defcription here given of the battle, correfponds in every material particular with that journal. Sir Eyre Coote himfelf alfo, in a late converfation with me, declared, ' that the publications before-mentioned were abfolutely falfe-, that any perfon might be convinced thereof, by appealing to the minutes of the committee of the houfe of commons,, where what was delivered by him on this examination, was committed to paper.' He alfo authorifed me publicly to declare, ' that he has on all occafions been ever ready to do juftice to Lord dive's merit.' While our army was purfuing, a large body of horfe was obferved on ouif right; after firing a few fhot at them, a meflenger arrived with a letter from Meer Jaffixr to the colonel, acquainting him, that the corps was under his command, and requefting an interview that night or the next morning. Accordingly, the next day he had an interview with the colonel,, when after congratulating him on his vidory, he declared him felf ready to perform the articles of the treaty between them. The colonel faluted him as Soubahdar or Nabob of Bengal, Bahar, and Orixa, and ad- vifed him to advance immediately to Muxadabad after Serajah Dowlah^ pro- mifing that he would follow to fupport him with his whole force.. The late Nabob reached his capital, which was 20 miles diftant from the field of battle, a few hours after his defeat: and the next evening, not knowing whom to truft, or what to do, abandoning himfelf to his fears, on Meer Jaffierh arrival, he difguifed himfelf in the habit of a Faquier, and with one or two attendants attempted to make his efcape. Meer Jajfier immediately entered the palace, where all was anarchy and confufion •, but prefently, Mef- fieurs Watts and Waljh arrived from the colonel to pacify the inhabitants, and affure them of protection : and on the 27th of June Colonel Clive him felf made his public entry into Muxadabad. Meer Jaffier vifited the colonel the next day, and the 29th Colonel Clive went to the palace, and in the prefence of the Rajahs and Grandees of the court, he folemnly X 1 handed:■ippppp [ '54 ] handed him to the Mufnud or carpet and throne of {late, where he was unanimoufly fainted Souh-ahdar or Nahoh&gt; and received the fubmiffion of all prefent. He afterwards, and as foon as he was able, pundlually fulfilled the feveral articles ftipulated in the treaty ; and conferred upon the company, the navy, and army, fuch liberal rewards, as fully compenfated for the courage and intrepidity they had exerted in his behalf. The remaining part of the month was fpent in fettling many important matters, confequent to fuch an amazing revolution. On the 3d of July, Serajah Bowlah the late Nahoh^ after wandering about, forfaken and almoit naked, was taken in his way to Patna, near Rajamaul ; betrayed, it is faid, by one whom he had in his profperity cruelly treated, by caufing his ears to be cut off: The next day, he was brought back to Muxadahad, and in a few hours afterwards, privately put to death by Meer Jaffier's eldeft fon, to whofe cuftody he was committed. The father outwardly feemed defirous of having him confined for life; but the fon and other chief men did not think it prudent to hazard fuch a ftep in the prefent critical fituation of affairs, and therefore, agreeable to the cruel maxims of Eaftern policy, had him murdered in prifon, and his remains were expofed on an elephant round the city. He had not quite compleated his 25th year, and but one of his reign, when he thus fell: an exit, too iuitable to his fanguinary difpofition, and tyrannical acls ! On the 26th of July the new Nabob fent prefents, after the cuftom of the country, and of the eaft in general, to the admiral, confifting of an elephant, two fine horfes, a rich Moorijh drefs of gold gingham, with tur bans and lafhes ; and a rofe and plume compofed of diamonds, rubies, fapphires, and emeralds, which though not of great value, made ^ pom- a ^ ea - ranCe ' J ^ fr ^ ra l Pocock was alfo complimented with a prefent of the fame kind. AdmiraX TVatfon received the ambaffadors on this occafion with marks of great refped: •, he made a prefent of fine cloth and velvet to each in return; dreffed his (hips, difplaying as many flags of different nations as could be difpofed of on the yards, mafls, and rigging of the (hips •, faluted them with his cannon; and wrote the following coneratu- Jatory letter to the Nabob. Admiral Charles Watson, the great commander of the fleet belonging to the mcjtpuijjant King of Great Britain, irrefiible in battle-,—'To the Nabob bnujAH al Muluk Hassam 6 Dowlah Meer Mahomed-JaffierKhan bAHADAR MAHABUT J u NG . , MIRZA JAFFIER BEG, whom you have done me the honour to d.pute to me, has delivered me your letter and the other marks of friend- ™ , * h,cl ? y o . u &gt;ve been pleafed to favour me.

BY the articles of the capitulation of Chandemagore, the whole of that garrifon were to continue prifoners of war; but about the time of fign- ing the treaty, Mr. Law, with a fmall body of troops, made his efcape out of CaJJimhuzar, and with them marched northward, towards Patm. At that place, he was proteded by the late Nabob * j and on our recommenc ing hoftilities, Mr. Law collefted together about 200 of his nation, the only remains of the French in Bengal, to aflift him ; and which were within two days march of the Nabob's camp, when the battle of Plajfey was fought. On receiving the news of the defeat, Mr. Law flopped; but hearing alfo of the Nabob's efcape, he advanced again, and was within a few hours march of joining him, when he was taken. To clear Bengal entirely of fo reftlefs an enemy to the Engli/h, and the new Nabob', on the 4th of July a detachment of troops, under the command of Major Archibald Grant, of Colonel Adlercrorfs regiment, was ordered by Colonel Clive to hold themfelves in readinefs to go in purfuit of Mr. Law and his party. Mootenheg, a Sepoy officer in the company's fervice, wasfent on before, with two grenadier companies of Sepoys, as an advanced guard. 1 hefe orders, a few hours afterwards were countermanded, and Major Eyre Coote was then appointed to the chief command of the expedition, who ac cordingly on the 5th marched to Muxadabad, and there took on him the command of the detachment. On the 6th the Major left Muxadabad with 223 Europeans, officers and artillery included, 2 pieces of cannon 6 pounders, 3 companies of Sepoys, 50 Lafcars or Indian Tailors, and 10 Marmutty men, or pioneers to clear the road •, and the fame night arrived at Rumna, where he was greatly dil- treffed by the drunkennefs and diforder that prevailed among his people. * See Admiral If at/on's letters to the Kaiob complaining: of the protedion given to Mr. Law and his party, p. 14.3. &amp;V. * o xr o On 'C js? 3 On the yth, he continued his rout by water; only the Sepoys marching by 1757' land on the banks of the river: At night he reached Chepoua. The next - day he went on to Belgutta, where meeting with the Dacca fleet of king's boats, he thought it neceflary, for forwarding the expedition, to get two Bolias *, a Goordore f, and 8 7 Dandies or boatmen, from the Nazir, or of ficer who commanded the boats, to whom he gave a receipt for them. After this, the major left the boats and European foldiers under the com mand of Captain Alexander Grant (an officer in the company's military fer- vice) and pulhed on by land, with Mr. Johnftone, a gentleman in the civil employment of the Eaft India company, and who now afted as his fecretary, endeavouring to get up with the advanced body of Sepoys. That night he arrived at Sooty&gt; a place fituate at the conflux of the Ganges and Caffimhuzar- river. On the 9th the major quitted Sooty^ and in the evening of the fame day got into a creek near to Dogatchy. Captain Grant, with the Europeans, lay by at Cogatchy, The next morning the major joined Mootenbeg with the advanced party of two grenadier companies of Sepoys, who had been before reinforced with about 120 horfe and 7 gunmen, under the com* mand of two of the Nabob's Jamedars or military officers. The maior had an interview at Dogatchy with Doad Khan, brother of Nabob Jaffier Ali Khan, who informed him, that Mr. Law and his detach ment had left Teriagurry but a few days before. He then pufhed on with the Sepoys to Rajemaul \ where Duan Siburtray fliewed him a letter from Mr. Law, dated the 6th, from Baghelpoor, acquainting him with his arrival at that place, and that he intended to proceed by flow marches to Patna, at which place he expefled to receive a Perwannah from Meer Jaffier, and to that end had inclofed an Arzy or petition to that Nabob. The major took pof- feffion of this, and inclofed it in a letter to Colonel Clive the fame night; which letter informed him likewife, ' that the two Jamedars having received no orders to advance with him, had refufed to go any farther; and that the Phoufdar, or chief magiftrate of the diftridt, who had promifed to have 500 gunmen and 100 horfemen ready in the morning to reinforce the par ties already polled at the pafles of Sicarigully, and I'eriagurry, had been worfe than his word, pretending that thofe two places were already fuf- ficiently fecured, 200 gunmen and 40 horfe being ftationed at the former, and 50 gunmen and 15 horfe at the latter:' The major concluded, with requefting the colonel's orders concerning one Alexander Saufure, a Swifsy whom the Sepoys had apprehended difguifed in a Moor's drefs. This ex- prefs packet was fent to Captain Grant, to be forwarded by him to Co lonel Clive, and the captain at the fame time was exprefly ordered by the major to come up and join him with all expedition. * Indian boats, very long, but fo narrow, that only one man can fit in them abreaft# They carry however a multitude of rowers, and are remarkable for their fwiftnefs. f A veffel pufhed on by paddles. On[ 158 ] On the nth the major received a letter from Captain Grant, on this fide Dogatcly, acquainting him with the lofs of the boat which carried the ar rack defigned for the wfe of the troops, and that the whole fleet was in great diftrefs for want of proper tackle and dandies but he hoped to be able to join the major fome time in the night with the light boats only. On the receipt of this, the major was again obliged to apply to the Phoufdar, who promis'd to procure him fome country arrack, 10 light boats, 500 ad ditional dandies, and ropes for tackling : But on his being reminded of his late promife of afiiiting the major with a body of men, he defired to be excufed, telling him his troops were fo difperfed in different quarters, it was impoffible to collecl them together-, but, if that had not been the cafe he fhould never have prevailed on them to march, unlefs the two months arrears which were then due to them from the Nabob were firft paid. The major advifed the colonel of all thefe difficulties by letter, earneftly defiring him to procure proper orders from the Nabob to the Jamedars and other officers of the places he was to pafs through, to fupply him with all the necefTaries he might ftand in need of.—Captain Grant, agreeable to the hopes he h^d given him, joined the major this night with all the boats, ex^ cept that which carried the ammunition, and a tumbril-boat, of which no. tidings could be learned. The next day. Major Cwte fent out fome parties in fearch of the boats that were mifling, and employed all the caulkers and carpenters that could poffibly be procured, in refitting the other boats. The Phoufdar again aflured him, that he had difpatched people every where to collect the boats and dandies he had promifed, and faid he made not the leart doubt but they would be all ready the next day. At night the major had the fatis- laftion to be joined by the ammunition and tumbril-boats, both of which were fuppofed to have been loft.—At the fame time, he received a letter from Colonel Clive, ordering him to follow Mr. Law as far as Patna, if he could not come up with him fooner.. The 13th, Serjeant Devergue having reported, that the prifoner Alexander SanjU) e, (who at firft came from Europe to Bombay as a volunteer, in a Swifs company ox iojdiers, but foon after left our Eaji India company's fervice) had been endeavouring to perluade him to defert, and carry over with hint as many men as he could to the French, and that he had alfo difclofed to him a Icheme he had formed for his efcape, by the connivance of the Sepoy, w in was centmel over him; and farther, that he had communicated to him the contents g a letter which he had written to Mr. Law, giving an account of t ic procee ings of this Englijh detachment, and of its force; the major, on t e erjeant s imormation, fent Lieutenant Flaffon to the prifoner, who oo rom iim a letter addrefTed to Mr. Law? and another to fome other per- n?) r 0!T11 e er lt - appeared, that Saufure had been formerly in the *\ B J tavi \ where he had killed one officer, and wounded -rs m diiiCient duels-, that he had the good fortune to efcape ta[ '59 ] to -Pondicherry ; but lately, upon account of a rencounter of the fame kind, he had been obliged to leave that place alfo, in ztDanifh fhip bound to Bengal, and that juft before the battle of Plajfcy he had joined the few French who were then at Caffimbuzar. In his letter to Mr. Law, he gave an account of that battle ; the defeat of Serajah Dowlah, with his confnfion and perturbation of mind after the death of Meer Modun his chief general, and finally, his flight from his capital. He added, that had himfelf, previous to the adion, been fupported with 4000 men as an advanced guard, and which the Nabob had aftually promifed him, he would have prevented the little EngUJh army from taking pofleffion of Plajfey grove ; to which, and to his not being properly fupported in the tank, where he had placed the few Frenchmen who were with him, he attributed the lofs of the battle. — He went on with faying, that he had propofed to Monf. St. Frais, the commander of the French troops, to march with his handful of forces up the country, with a view of joining Mr. Law^ but St. Frais anfwered, it was impradicable, and therefore defired his people to difperfe, and take the beft care they could of themfelves. He added, that he had defignedly fecreted himfelf until Major Coote had began his march; and advifed Mr. Law to get a paflport from Meer Jqffier to fecure him a fafe and uninterrupted paflage through his country, though he acknowledged, that the Nabob, influenced by Colonel Clive, had aftually difpatched orders to the Nabob of Patna for detaining him and his party on their march. However, faid he 'You, Sir, have it in your power, with ' the troops under your command, to get the better of the EngUJh detach- ' ment, who are now in purfuit of you. In the twinkling of an eye, you ' may entirely change the face of affairs here. Your name is in high ' repute among the Moors, and the military reputation of Mr. BuJJy is fo ' great and dreaded, that this party muft inftantly fly at his very name.' He proceeded with advifing Mr. Law, by a counter-march, to attack our troops in the night-time, in a certain place which he particularly defcribed ; affurlng him, that by fuch a coup he might eafily kill or make prifoners all the officers, efpecially thofe of the Sepoys, who were more addi6led to drunkennefs than even the Europeans themfelves.-—He concluded his letter with thefe words: ' I wifhed to have delivered to you in perfon this intelli- ' gence, but on the third day of my journey, I had the misfortune to be ' arrefted, difguifed like a Moor: I lhall do every thing in my power &lt;l however to make my efcape for which purpofe I beg you to fend with 44 the bearer, a good Alcara *, who underftands the Portuguefe language.— ' The EngUJh arrived at Rajamaul the 11th inftant.' The prilbner being brought before Major Coote and the other officers, acknowledged the above letters to have been written with his own hand j and having nothing to plead in his defence, was judged unanimoufly to be deferving of death, as a fpy; and the major thinking it proper to carry the * A guide and fpy. fentenceL 160 ] fentence into immediate execution, he was accordingly hanged in the front of the battalion. The Sepoy whom he had feduced, was tried the next day by a court -martial compofed of Suhadars * and Jamedars, who finding him guilty of confenting to connive at, and aflift Alexander Saufure in making his- dcape, ordered him 500 lafhes with a ratan, and to be turned out of the fervice. The Pboufdar, reprefenting to the major, that he could not aflure him of the boats and dandies before the enfuing night, and exprefsly promifing that every thing fhould be then ready, the major thought it moft advifable to poftpone his march till the 15th in the morning. When this day arrived,, he found himfelf under the difagreeable neceflity of putting off from Raja- inaul in the fame embarraffed condition he arrived there the Phoufdar and 'Duan an officer next in command, having negleded to procure him the boats and dandies which they had fo faithfully promifed, and in the former of which he intended to have embarked the Sepoys. This body of troops therefore were ftill obliged to march on by land, and at night arrived at Sicarigully^ where they joined the major; who had a little before arrived there with the other part of the detachment, excepting 11 boats that were under the command of the officer of the rear-guard, and who could not get up that night through want of a fufficient number of dandies to trade againft the current. At Sicarigully, the major vifited the pais of that name, which is a road from about 9 to 12 feet wide, cut through a, rock, and covered on each fide by an impenetrable Jungle or coppice,., while a rivulet or water-courfe, very hollow and impaffable, runs near to- the Futtacks or gate : if a ball was difcharged here, it could not go above 100 yards in a line, the road every where abounding with fo many intri cate windings. In this pafs too, fuch deep breaft-works and trenches are thrown up, that it would be very difficult to force a paflage, if well de-^ fended. The King's Road is faid to be eafier of accefs than this, and lies, about a mile nearer the foot of the mountain. The major went alfo to&gt; fee the tomb of Seid Ahmud Mahdoom^ which ftands upon the top of the rock, and was built at the expence of Sharejhe Khan, uncle to the famous. Aurengzebe: here he received a vifit from ihtjamedar^ who promifed to procure him a frefh fupply of dandies, alfuring him however at the- iame time, that the French party he was in purfuit of, were already got ten beyond Patna. On the 16th, the major left Sicarigully, and on his arriva? at Goujapoor,. was complimented with a vifit from the Duan and Jamedar of 'feric.gurry pafs-, who informed him, that the French had halted there two days, at the time Serajah Bowlah was prifoner at Rajamaul-, and that upon the ^amedarh afluring them, that no kind of affiilance would be given them,, ould they perfift to advance farther down the river, they had returned; * Black commanders of a company* back:r 16, ] back, and ht adtli.dj that the preient li'lssv had done him the honour to thank him, for having rendered to him and his people fo acceptable a ieivice. ihe major loon afterwards proceeded on to agurry pafs. This is only a wall carried on from the brink of the river (which at this place is prodigioiifly rapid) to the foot of the mountain, ■and is almoft impaffable, being covered, like that at with thick woods and Jungle ; and hath this farther impediment, that very near to the wall, runs a^ rivulet, on the fide of the hill, feemingly impracticable to pals oyer. The, baftions are without parapets, having eight fides that are not eight reet wide, and they have contrived to build the walls fo artfully, that the rivulet ferves for a ditch in front. The baftion-wall, which is about 14 feet high, and 50 yards long, entirely commands the river, which though it be ^ ot a mile broad here, yet the current is fuch as to carry all boats clofe under the platform. ^The major arrived this night at Shah ah ad \ where being informed by Mootenhegi who commanded the Sepoys, that the French were a little beyond Baghelpoor, he difpatched two Hircars or fpies for more certain intelligencej detaching at the lame time 100 Sepoys with orders to endeavour to overtake tnem, to fire into their boats, and lb harrafs them, as to give him an oppor tunity of coming up with them. On the 17th the major left Shahahad at day-break, and at 10 o'clock arrived at Pyntaby, which is a pretty ftrong poll on the top of a hill, in which are quarries of lime. He here vifited the tomb of Shah CummuU and was told by the Nabob's Peons who were quartered in the place, that xht French had left it about ten days before. On this intelligence, the major continued to pufh on, and leaving Bolgutta on his left, rowed up to Latgow-Nulla, and arrived in the evening with fome of the light boats ac Calgow, where the reft of his troops did not get up till midnight, and the next morning. The fituation of Bolgutta is moft delightful, but whac greatly adds to the_ beauty and pleafure of the place and profpeft, is» in the river near to it, are feveral large rocks, which in the dryfeafon caufe a great fall of water and fome very fine cafcades. The Sepoys made heavy complaints here of the fatigues they had undergone, by fuch long and con- tinned marches through bad roads ; and the Dandies declared,' that they cou a work no longer at the rate they had hitherto puflied forwards : the major theretore, to filence all complaints, and to induce them to go on wit out delay, was obliged to make each of them a prefent in money, i ms day, a Coafi-Sepoy joined Mootenbeg on the march, who told the major that he had deferted from the French, and left them about teA days before encamped at Mongheer, to the number of about 140 Eu* ropeans, and 90 Sepoys, with three pieces of cannon; that all the men were we armed, but in great want of money; that he and feveral others who were at Chandermgore when it was taken, though allowed to go where Eiey p eafed, chofc to join Mr. Law -, but that having had fome words with , L . V ■ 1757- ■ || 11 ||jP I ■ r ft W g||P r[ 1^2 ] .. , nr i havinE received his pay with any kind of punftuality„ w KS a refolution o/quitting the ^ and offering his fervice to the While the major continued at Calgow he recetved alfc a vifit from the Phoufdar of that place, who told h.m, the Frmi party were I rived at the fort of Mongheer, where they were colleamg all kinds of provifions and ftores, for which however they pa.d a double pnee: H e added, they were enabled to do this, havmg received a little whi e before, Toooo rupees by Serajah VowlaV* orders, from the town of Monghm-, and that even at this time, they were in no want of money. On the 18 th, the boats being almoft all come up, the major proceeded on to RaMtoor Here, he received a letter from Colonel Cltve, dated the 15th at nofn in which were inclofed others from the to the different %amedars t and Phoufdars, ordering them to fupply the major with every thing he flood in need of. The colonel had hkewife taken care to inclofe the Nabob's PerwannaB, direding the feveral particular, to obey the major's commands; in conlequence of which, Mr. Cottle fent for Mtrza Kelbealy, the Ton of Ala Kuly Khan, the Phoufdar oi Baghelpoor, and after hav.. ins delivered to him the Nabob's letter,, he ftewed him the he had, received to command all theAWs forces. He then demanded 60 horfe of him which he readily promiled to furmfli, and alfo that they lliouid be in 'readinefs to march the next morning. The major afterwards put into his hands, (to be forwarded by him) the Nabob's Perwannah, and a letter of his own, addreffed to the Rajah of Caruckpoor, demanding ot hitn 200 horfe, which he faid he expeded ftiould join, him in two days at 'Mongheer The major likewife delivered to*him another Perwannah, incloiea in a letter from himfelf to xhtjamedar of Bhar, requiring him, on the •fuppofition of the French being at that place, to diftrefs them by burning their boats, and throwing every other impediment irv their way, that, might detain them till he himfelf could get up. But at midnight, the major received a letter from Mr. Pearkss, our company s chief atP^/w^, elated the 16th, in which be informed him, that the French had paffed by that city, and were going on to the extreme boundaries of the province.. Their force, he faid, confifted of about 100 Europeans, 125 Coafi and 4Q) Bengal Sepoys, 8 field-pieces, and 9 patteraroes.. On the 19th the major put off with his boats from Baghelpoor , having lent on the Sepoys by land. The fame day he vifited Mirza Kelbealy, and defired of him 40 Bandies to enable his troops to go on with the greater dilpatcn in purfuit of the French. —Here he faw. a Mofque built by Shah Zada, molt beautifully fituated on an high rock, by the river's fide: alio a pretty, romantic houfe on the top of a ftill higher rock in the middle ot the river, with a number of figures cut in the rock. This very agreeab e manfion was inhabited by Faquiers* who feemed to think that they 1 the major great honour by accepting of fome money from him. aoon afterwards he paflfed by Sattangunge a neighbouring town, and ' a y ^ A at Jehanguira. From hence, he wrote to Rajah Ramnardn, ^r 163 J • of Pstna, defiring him to oppofe the French^ and to prevent their going 1757. farther up the river; and alfo a letter to Mr. Pearkes, indofing a number '—-v-^ of papers calculated to induce the French troops to defert, which he defired, if pofTible, he would get dropt in the French camp. On the 20th the major left Jehanguira, and on his arrival at Gcurgat-Nulla, was joined by Mirza Kelbealy with 60 horfe, and a party of Buxerries or matchlock foldiers. He alio this day met Jgah Meer^ a Faquier, who told him, that he left Fatna but three days before, and the French were then at a garden- houfe, three Cofs or fix Englijh miles from that city. Late this nighr, the major arrived at Mongheer fort, and on the Duan's vifking him, he demanded of him Dandies and 100 trackers having been difappointed in receiving thole he expe6ted from Mirza Kelbealy. —A grenadier-boat, and a tumbril boat, and the rear-guard did not get up with him this night. The 2ill, the officer of the rear-guard having joined the major, and reported that the two boats which did not get up the preceding night, were a ground upon a ihoal, an officer and 30 Dandies^ furnifhed by the Duan^ were ordered to go and alTift in getting them off. r . ptfii '! ■ u n 1. ■ . : ro;fiw J- .. .0 In this interval, the major, accompanied by fome of his officers, went to take a view of the fort, but unexpeftedly found the gate fhut againft them, and that r.o admittance was to be gained, though the Duan made one of the company, who feemed greatly difconcerted at this feeming incivility. On the major and his attendants approaching very near to the gate, he perceived the garrifon to be fo much alarmed, or fo hoftile in their inten tions, as to be actually lighting their matches; on which he refolved only to walk round the fort, which was three miles in circumference, but badly flanked •, the wall, though pretty high and faced with flone, was to the land-fide ruinous in many places, and might eafily be fcaled. The wall is alfo overlooked in fome parts by an high bank at the diflance of but fixty yards. The current of the river oppofite to the fort, is fo very rapid, that boats are carried down at leaft two miles in croffing only to the oppofite fide. The major however was not deterred from making the attempt; and though he had the good luck to get over fafe, yet one of his boats with fome Sepoys was overfet, by which accident one 'man was drowned, and five ftands of arms entirely loft. Many of the other boats not joining the major in the night, he' came to a refolution of croffing the river again, and afterwards lay to, in order to give his people an opportunity of getting up with him. Finding however that the Sepoys were advanced three Cofs beyond Nahohgunge, he puihed on, and in very little time arrived at Hyhutgunge. On the 22d, the major .put off from Hybutgunge ; having firft written a letter to Colonel Clinje^ acquainting him that he fliould follow Mr. Law until he received his orders to the contrary. H« alio forwarded to the » Men to df aw the boats up by the help of rope*. y 2[ 164 ] colonel a letter he had juft before received from Mr. Pearkes, the contents of which informed him, that the French had advanced 3 Cofs beyond Chup- r ah, from whence they could eafily make their efcape out of the province; as they were not above 5 Cofs diftant from the territories of Sujah Dowlah] Nabob of Oude. The major lay this night zx. Nabob gunge ^ and was joined at midnight by the rear-guard. In the mean time, part of the boats paflTcd by, without touching at Nabobgunge^ and got as far as Lutchinpoor. On the 23d, at day-break, the major left Nabobgunge, and foon after, his Bui- gerow * by the force of the wind and current, was driven aftiore at Rhua Nulla ; there he left her to be refitted, and proceeded on foot to Lutchin- foor, where he joined the reft of the fleet, and the Sepoys, —Then putting off from Lutchinpoor, he reached Bharrai by five in the afternoon. The major now confidering the great rifk his boats had already run, and (till would, from the dangerous navigation of the river, and that a few more fuch accidents, would inevitably bring on the ruin of the whole expedition; he judged it neceflary to order the troops, with the ammunition and artil lery, to difembark, and then putting himfelf at their head, he marched three Cofs over land, which brought him to Dirriapoor \ the artillery was drawn, and ammunition carried, by his foldiers. On the 24th he marched with his whole little army from Dirriapoor to Purraruck, which places are diftant about 20 Englifb miles from each other. The European foldiers during this march, exprefied the greateft difcontent, complained of the fatigues they had gone through, and the many hardfhips they had fuffered, by the want of Ihoes and arrack, and at laft pofitively refufed to go any farther. The major finding the men in a difpofition to mutiny, and perceiving at the fame time that the wind and river were more favourable than they had lately experienced, thought it advifable to re-embark the European troops,, but putting himfelf at the head of the Sepoys, he marched with them to Bhar, which was three Cofs farther. On the European troops arrival at Bhar, the major fent fbme of the fer- ieants with a mefTage to them, reminding them of the favours he had con ferred, and how ready he had been to oblige them upon all occafions; and ' how fenfible he was of their prefent bad behaviour-, and concluded, with afluring them, that if they did not prefently amend, he certainly would reprefent their conduct to Colonel Clive, and the reft of the army, and. leave them behind him at Patna. They returned for anfwer, that ' they fhould look upon the latter part of the difgrace as the moft defirable event that could happen to them, fince they were perfuaded, that theifr *' officers intention was to kill them in order to put their prize-money into ' their own pockets.'— Iheferjeants told the major, there was nothing new in their prelent behaviour, for that they had been grumbling during the whole expedition.—1 he major, forry to find his remonftrances had no- ©ffeO; on thefe fellows, wrote a. letter to Colonel Clive, informing him,. * One of the moft convenient boats to be foimd in this country. 7 tlutC '65 ] that if on his arrival at Patna he fhould find Mr. Law and bis party were ftill within the bounds of the Nabob's country, he then propofed to go on in the purfuit of them with only the Sepoys^ leaving the Europeans (who in their prefent temper he thought could not be depended upon) to follow by eafy marches under the command of Captain Grant ; and requefted his pofitive orders, whether if the Nabob's forces refuted to accompany him, he Ihould with the Sepoys only, purfue the French into the next province. On the 2 5tK the major reached Bykulpoor, diftant from Bhar 10 Cofs^ and there received a letter from Ramnarain? Nabob of Patna, exprefling his uneafinefs at not having had any letters from him, or more early advice of his arrival in his province-, adding, that he had fent out fome of his prin cipal men to meet him, and condu6t him into the city. Soon after this, •a relation of the Rajah's waited upon the major, who allured him, that Ramnarain had fent 2000 men after the French^ but they unluckily were gotten out of the province. This news was afterwards attempted to be con firmed by a fecond letter the major received from Ramnarain himfelf,, in which he declared, had he been advifed in time, he could eafily have Itopped the French, but as that was now impradlicable,.. he would om the major's arrival in the city, confult with him about the beft methods- which were in future to be purfued. Major Coote anfwered, that he fhould be at Patna the next day, and would then wait upon him, and with his advice fettle his plan of operations. The Dutch chief was pleafed to fend his. fecond, in the State Budgerow, to attend the major and con- du6t him into the city. Mr. Pearkes alfo took this opportunity of waiting upon him. On the 26th, Mr. Coote, having fent on the Sepoys and artillery by land, put off with the fleet, and at ten, arrived at the Englijh faftory, where he quartered all the Europeans and Sepoys. In paffing by the Butch fadlory, he was faluted with 21 guns, and had a vifit from Mr. Delatour xht Dutch chief. Here a letter under the mafk of complaifance was brought him from Ramnarain ; the purport of which was to defire him, as the hour was late, and as the major could not but be greatly fatigued, that his vifit might be deferred till the next morning. But in the evening of the fame day, as if intended to prevent all ami cable intercourfe, three of the major's Sepoys and the European butcher with, three of his attendants, bringing in fome bullocks from the * Bazar, were* without any provocation, knocked down, beaten, and wounded. The major, on his being informed of this outrage, fent Mirza Kilbealy, to the Rajah to ! complain of it; declaring, that until he fhould be informed what was the reafon for that treatment, he thought himfelf obliged to provide for his own fafety: Ramnarain plaufibly anfwered, he was forry for what had hap-* ^ Market, X pened 3[ .66 ] ir ri. pencd, and Ihould he be fo fortunate as to find out the guilty perfbns, ht ^y~' would certainly fend them to the major to be punifhed. On the 27th Major Coote wrote to Colonel Clive, informing him of the feveral occur rences, and of the Nabob's declining to lee him. After he had finifhed his let ter, he vilited Mahmud Ami Khan (who, with many other men of diftinguifhed rank, though not in the command of a province, was commonly honoured with the title of Nabob) and Meer Cajjim •, the one the brother-in-law, and the other the brother of Jaffier Ali Khan: At night, both thefe gentlemen, attended by fome of the chief Jamedars, returned the major's vifit, and had a conference with him in private. The fubftance of what Mahmud Ami Khan laid, touching the dependance the major ought to place on the friendfliip of Ramnarain, was to the following purport; ' that Ramnarairi% views were to make hitnfelf independant of the Souhahdar Meer Jaffier, and that he had the night before been advifed in council to fall upon the major unawares, and cut off him and his whole party.' On the 28th the major wrote to Colonel Clive, acquainting him with what he had learned from Nabob Mahmud Ami Khan \ and again requefted his diregions, whe ther he fhould follow Mr. Law into Sujah Dowlah's country. He took this opportunity alio of writing a complimentary letter to Nabob Jaffier Ali Khan, on account of the affiftance which, by his Pcrwannahs, he intended to render him, though in reality they proved but of little fervice towards facilitating his expedition. Major Coote alfo now wrote a letter to the Nabob of Oude, Sujah Bowlah, requefting him not to allow the French to enter his dominions, but if they were already there, to feize and deliver them up into his hands, or at leaft to permit him to advance into his territories after them •, and concluded with telling him, that he Ihould exped an an- fwer at his arrival on the borders. The major finding, that his remonftrances to the foldiers on the 24th had very little weight, and that a tendency to mutiny ftill remained, now thought it neceffary to order a court martial, for the trial of the ring-leaders; ^o of whom were fentenced to punifhment, which they received that afternoon; by this timely feverity a total flop was put to any fuch diforders for the future among the European troops. But on the 29th feveral of the major's Dandies, Bazar , and black fervants delerted; and the Sepoys when they were paraded to march off, grounded their arms to a man, and refufed to go any farther. They complained bitterly of the great fatigues they had already gone through, the immenfe diftance they were now removed from their families, the promifes that had been made them at Madrafs, that they mould go no farther than Calcutta, which afterwards were changed to Chandevnagore, then to Muxadabad, and that now they faw no period to their marching : They complained alfo that they had not received their J1 pay- ^ ma jor, having inefFedtually endeavoured by fair words and promiles to prevail on them again to take up their arms, pointed out to t em the ill confequences which muft necefiarily arife to themfelves from P r eient procedure : As, that they were then furrounded by the Rajah's 7 troops,t 167 ] troops, whom they had no reafon to look upon as well affiled towards them / that by thus quitting their arms they were of courfe rendered in capable of defending themfelves and if no greater misfortune happened to them, they might be fure of being plundered of what little they had, befides forfei'ting all the prize-money which was ftill due to them: but if thefe re- prefentations had no weight with them, they were at liberty to go where- ever they thought proper, as he had already provided men to take up thofe arms which they fo fhamefully abandoned. This operated fo effeftually upon them, that they immediately refumed their arms, and confented to march. He then ordered the artillery and Sepoys to march by land to th^ Englifb gar dens at Baukypoor, 3 Cofs N. W. of Patna, and the Europea\ foldiers to embark, and proceed thither by water. Before he himfelf fet off from Patna, he was again cautioned by Mahmud Ami Khan to be diffident of Ramnarain and thole troops of his which were to^ accompany him, who r he affured the major, would be of no fervice to him ^ and then put him in mind of the incivility and infult with which the major and his people- had been treated by this Nabob.. On the 30th Major Coote halted at the gardens and fpent the whole day in adjufting his boats, ordering the Bazar, paying his men, and preparing every thing for his march. He fummoned alfo the four captains who were under him° to a council of war, and having laid before them two letters he had received from Colonel Clive of the 14th and 17th of Juiy, direding him to purfue Mr. Law as far as he poflibly could •, he obferved to them, that they had now proceeded beyond Patna, and that he had received pofitive intelligence, Mr. Law was now a day's march out of the pro vince, and encamped in that of Sujah Dowlah ; he therefore put the quel- tion, whether they thought it poflible that the detachment under his com mand, could go on with the fame expedition as they had hitherto done^ It was unanimoufly thought rmpoffible, for the following reafons. ift. Be- eaufe the Sepoys had already laid down their arms on account of the great fatigue they had undergone in their long march to Patna, and had been prevailed on with much difficulty to take them up again, adly, Becaufe of the difcontent that reigned among the Europeans, the defertion of the Dandies and black fervants, and the very great difficulty which was daily experienced of getting others in their room. The council however were unanimoufly of opinion, that they ffiould ftill proceed in the belt manner they eould, though by eafier marches, in purfuit of Mr. Law. On the 31ft of 'July, the detachment left Baukypoor-^v^ns, and came. to Dunapoor, diftant 3 Cofs. From hence the major difpatched three Hir- iars, ordering them to go on 'till they reached the French camp, and then bring him all the intelligence they could learn. One of the three, was ordered to make the beft of his way back to the major, as foon as they could pro cure any information on the road that might be depended upon. On the ift ®f Augufi, the troops reached Munere, a place belonging to Ramnarain, and fituatedlI 16S ] fituated at the conflux of the Soan and Ganges ; where Mootenhg informed Major Cootc, that on his arrival at the town, Hyat Khan, who commanded Ramnarain's troops there, had lent him word, that neither he nor his peo ple fhould enter it, or go into the Bazar, for if they did, he would put them all to death. Lieutenant Kinch alio, who marched with the artillery, remarked, that the inhabitants of the villages through which they had paflfed that day, (and which belonged to Ramnarain) were all armed; the major on this ordered the Sepoys to encamp in the plain by the river's fide; he likewife took care to reinforce the picquet, and pointed the artillery towards the town. On the zd, all the foldiers and Sepoys were ordered to embark, with the guns, tumbrils, &amp;:c. and with the aflifVance of as many Lafcars as could be gotten On board, to croft the Soan and Ganges in order to their being conveyed to Chuprah, The bullocks, the remaining part of the Lafcars, Marmutty -men, and a Jarnedar with. 16 Sepoys, together with the Bazar- people, were direded to march by land, till they got oppofite to Chuprah-, and Phcroofmg (an officer of Ramnarain's) undertook to get them all ferried over the river in three days time. The reft of the party arrived at Cbuprah the fame night, and were lodged in the large falt-petre Godowns or ftore- houfes, and the factory-houfe. Here the major learnt, that Mr. Law had left that place 17 days before, and was now at Banaras, Late at night, Pherooftng came to him, and told him, that he muft be very cautious how he proceeded, for that his mafter Ramnarain had fent a great man to him yeiierday, to defire the major not to think of going any farther than Munere, and with the moft pofitive injundtions to his own troops not to proceed a ftep beyond that place : On which accoimt, Pheroojkig taking it for granted that the major would immediately return to Patna, had.flopped the bullocks, &amp;c. on the road ; the major however infifted on their join ing him, and Pheroofmg promifed that they ftiould be with him the next day. On the 3d, Major Coote was joined by the Lafcars, bullocks, &amp;c. agree able to the promife given him by Pheroofing he then examined that of ficer concerning what number of troops Ramnarain had on the fame fide of the river he now was, who aiTured him, that there were none of any kind whatever; by which circumftance, the reader will eafily judge con cerning the affiftance which the major had to expefb from this Nahh The next day, the major fummoned his officers to another council of war, when he laid before them the intelligence received from the three Hircars, whom he had difpatched from Baukypoor -gdiV &amp;ens, ' That they had gone quite up to Banaras, where the French arrived 13 days before; that five of their gentlemen had waited upon the Rajah Bulwanjing to implore his protec tion, who had granted them an old ruinous fort, about 2 Cofs on this fide t ^e town*[ 169 ] town, by the rivers fide; that fome of their men ftaid in the fort^ and *757 fome on board the boats i that the Rajah had difpatched letters to Sujah Dowlah, acquainting him, that the French who had fled from the Fatna confines were now with him, and defired his permiflion to continue there } that Suja Dowlah now refided at Luchnow, 100 Cofs from Banaras, and that the French propofed entering into his fervice; that Rajah Bulwanftng, had 4000 men encamped in huts clofe to Banaras ; that Phafel AH Khan^ Nabob of Gangypour, with whom the French had ftaid two days, was marching with 3000 men, and had advanced 6 Cofs towards the borders of his diftrid i and that troops were affembling on all fides on the news of the approach of the Englijh. —Finally, that the roads, they the Hircars came over, were very bad, with water in them as high as their middle ; that there were three rivers to pafs over ; that the current new Banaras was very ftrong-, and that the French artillery was not yet landed.' The major defired them to give their opinions, whether it was advifable to proceed any farther in purfuit of Mr. Law and his party ? And they unanimoufly refolved, that it was not, for the following reafons. ' Becaufe, we apprehend the French would not have prefumed to remain fo long as they have at Banaras^ but have continued their route up the country, unlefs they had been very fure of being protedled by Sujah Dowlah, and the other neighbouring powers •, and with this protedion, we have not the lead reafon to expeft to fucceed at this feafon of the year againft them, fince we are in want of boats to carry the Sepoys up the river; and the depth of water on the roads, and the three rivers we have to pafs, is fuch as to render it impoffible for us to march them by land ; not to mention the diftrefs we are fure of fuffering in an enemy's country, through want of provifions for the foldiers, and of Dandies ; or the many bad confequences that may enfue from engaging ourfelves, and the Nabob Meer JaJper, at this junfture, in difputes with the neighbouring princes.' The next queftion, was, whether they had better remain where they were, or return to Patna, and there expedl the colonel's farther orders ? The coun cil, without one dilfenting voice, agreed, that it was moft expedient, and indeed, abfolutely neceffary, to return to Patna efpecially as the furgeon had reprefented, that the men fell fick apace, owing in a great meafure, as he apprehended, to the ground of the quarters they were now in, being prodi- gioufly impregnated with Salt-petre. Befides it appeared that the arrack which had been fent for the ufc of the ibldiers, was entirely expended, and no frefh fupply could be gotten in their prefent fituation. ^ This night, two deferters came in from (a town 14 miles north from Chuprah) who informed the major, that the Rajah of that place. Dun- feram, was colle6ting forces, and every day people were joining him from the north, and that he had already with him about 3000 horfe, 1500 foot, and four pieces of cannon; upon which Major Coote again queftioned l / Pheroojing on politics, who, after many equivocations, confefled, that the Z feveral&gt;757- [ '7° ] ; feveral Rajah's of the country, after the death of Sera]ah Dowlah, thoueRt / ihemfelves no longer obliged to pay the balance of the revenues to Nah h V Jaffier Alt Khan, but infifted on a Furkutey or full difcharge being granted them, for which purpofe they were affembling troops, and taking every other meafure to prevent any demand being made upon them. On the 5th Major Coote fent one of his * Chubdars to Rajah Dunferam, defiring to know his reafons for collefting troops, with orders to difmifs them immediately af luring him that if he refufed to do it, he would inftantly march, and attack him with his forces.—The next day the Chuhdar returned from Dunferam with the following anfwer; That the troops, he had been affembline were intended for his own fecurity ; but that on his receiving the major's orders he had difmiffed them all. He apologized at the fame time for not waiting upon the major, by faying he was not well, but that he had fent his Vacquetl to make his compliments. Major Coote however excufed himfelf from fee ing this mefienger. On the nth one Denautkhan, who was Gomaftah or agent for an Armenian black merchant named Coja IVazeed, an agent to the governor and council at Lalcutta, complained to the major, that the fecond was about to take the falt-petre out of his Godowns by force, which he had prepared for vented R 5 UI)0n lnI;el!l S enc e Major Coote immediately fent, and pre- .

And as it appeared to them, that by alter* ing the prefent mode of colleding it, much greater profits would arife to the company than what they had hitherto experienced, the major thought proper to convey the particulars to the governor and council at Calcutta^ through the military channel. And fome time afterwards, the major and Mr. JohnJione ftill ftrongly impreffed with the idea of its being highly necei- fary, that this bufinefs fhould be ferioufly attended to below, they agreed, that Mr. JohnJione fhould in his own name write to the governor and council, in a yet more circumftantial manner, pointing out the ways and means by which, if ftridly carried into execution, the company could not avoid making very confiderable advantages, and at the fame time be enabled to fupply government with falt-petre at a much lower price than ever before. Doubtlefs, due attention was foon paid to thefe falutary reprefentations; and the good efFedls of the major's and Mr. JohnJione's enquiries and reports, have for many years paft been happily experienced in this king dom. On the 13th, the major embarked the European troops, artillery, and Sepoys. Pheroofmgy finding by this manoeuvre the major was determined to march that day to Patna, feemed very uneafy, and framed many excufes to prevent his going ; but when he perceived that he could not prevail, he begged of him not to credit the feveral reports which had been propagated againft his mafter Ramnarain ; and concluded with alking the maior, whether he would have Hyatt Khan ordered with his troops into the city; but this Mr. Coote would by no means admit of. The major arrived the fame night at Patna, and no fooner fet foot in the city, but he lent for Nabob Ami Khan, and after reading him a letter, as he was direded to do, which he had received from Colonel Clive, at Muxadahad, he defired him to give his opinion oi the prefent fituation of affairs in general; and demanded of him in particular how many troops there were in and about the city, &amp;c. &amp;c. The major was now furrounded with a variety of political objeds; indeed he had fo nice and difficult a part to ad, as called for the utmoft exertion of all his abilities. We havefeen, that Meer Jafjier\ authority as Souhahdar, had hardly reached even the fouthern confines of this province, when the major entered it with his little detachment, otherwife fo many com plaints of the want of boats, Dandies, &amp;c. would not have been made. Cool, nay even unfavourable, was the reception given to the major by Ram narain at his entering Patna\ outrages were offered by this Nabob's people to the Sepoys and butchers belonging to the army j the council held Z 2 k} 7[ '72 ] *75 7- by the Nahoh on the fubjed of the major and his party, was hoftile- v—the intelligence given by Meer Jaffier\ two brothers, (whom the'major had received orders to confult and ad in concert with) concerning; the aim of Ramnarain, to make himfelf independant of the Suhahdar was corroborated by almoft every other poflible circumftance, in the behavi- our of Ramnarain himfelf; befides the preparation for war in the gar- rifon of Mongheer, and the levying troops in almoft every different pari of the country: add to thefe particulars, that Meer Jaffier\ two brothers had from time to time acquainted the Soubahdar of the uncertain tenure by which he held even his nominal dignity in the Patna country. Meer- Jaffier, aftuated by refentment towards Ramnarain, and being in dread of his power and machinations, (encouraged alfo by the afluranees fent him from his two brothers, that it would be an eafy matter for them, aided by the major, to depofe Ramnarain,) fometimes feemed refolved that an attack fhould be made on the palace, and that Ramnarain fliould be treated as a difaffefted perfon to his government. At other times, moved by poli tical caution and timidity, he would contradid the orders, which but juft before he had refolved Ihould be vigoroufly carried into execu tion. — Thefe inconftant refolutions, could not but make the fituation- of the Englijh commander extremely unpleafant. At length, after hav- ing maturely confidered the inftrucftions he had at different times re-- ceived from Colonel Clive, and the flate of the Nabob's affairs in this pro vince, the major concluded, that if by the ftrength of his reafons, and the influence ot his arms, he could convince Ramnarain that it was as con* filtent with his interefl, as it was with his duty, for him to lay afide all am- biuous views, and peaceably fubmit himfelf to him who was now become Soubahdar ot Bengal, Bahar and Orixa, the gaining fo material a point could not but terminate in the peace and happinefs of the provinces in; general, as well as the intereft ot the contending powers in parti- k U ^ a u could he but accomplifh this defirable end, r i i ^ ftr ° n S dt reafon t0 believe, it would afford great pleafure to' o one tve the commander in chief, and redound to the honour and r 0 , , 0 ^ n countr y» befides the enjoyment of unfpeakable m^nd 3 10n ' W happy fruits muft undoubtedly afford to his own Thus a cluated, he gerwroufly laid a fide, and nobly fubdued'in his breaft f,ff ery /r 0t i! ?n re 'entment for the indignities and outrage that had been. 0 18 ow ?

Pearhft acco i r, panied by moft of his officers, and Mr. ■&gt;&gt; waited upon him in a full Durbar, where he was treated; 1 politely.[ '73 1 politely, and received the uiual compliment of a drefs or veil, and a 1757 horfe. v -' The next day, the major had a conference with Theroofing^ to whom he urged the abfolute neceflity there was for his matter's fwearing allegiance in a public manner to Meer Jaffier \ and they parted after agreeing that Pheroof- ing fbould communicate the major's propofal to the Nabob. On the 20th, Pheroofing came to the major, and faid that his matter having fomething of importance to communicate to him, would be glad to fee him at any time that was moft convenient to himfelf, but intreated that no mention of this vifit might be made to Meer CaJJim untill it was patt •, to which requett Mr. Ccote readily confented, and promifed to wait on the Rajah the next morn ing. Accordingly on the 21ft the major went to Ramnarain, and ferioufly talked t6 him on the fubjeel of his duty and public fubmiffion. After a great deal of confidential difcourfe had patted, the Nabob declared,, that, provided his life, honour, and ttation were fecured to him on the faith of the Englijh, as well as the folemn promifes of the Soubahdar, he was ready, to take the oath propofed; and if the major would fay that he would be accountable for the fame, he would immediately do it in a full Durbar. The major replied, that he would engage, as far as in him lay, fo long as he Ihould-prove faithful and juft to the Soubahdar in every branch of his duty ; to this Ramnarain rejoined, that this he moft certainly ever would •, and then propofed as a proof of his fincerity, that he might be allowed immediately to fumrr.on a Durbar, and requetted the major to fend for Mahmud Ami Khan, Meer Caffim, and fuch Englijh. officers as he thought ■proper, to be witneffes of the ceremony.—Mr. Coote, with great delicacy declined the Rajah's offer, and begged that he would not think of doing it juft at that time, becaufe he was defirous it fhould appear to be entirely his own voluntary aft, advifing him to weigh the fubjeft maturely with his friends, and if they approved of his doing it, and he continued in the fame refolution the next day, he then would wait upon him again. On the 22d, the major received a meffage from the Rajah, defiring that he would come to him, accompanied by Mahmud Ami Khan, Meer CaJJim, and as many others as he thought proper. Accordingly Mr. Code waited upon him in the evening in full Durbar, where Ramnarain per formed his promife to him, by fwearing allegiance to Meer Jaffier Ali Khan and a few days after,, the major wrote a letter to the Soubahdar, acquainting him with the tteps he had taken towards fettling his affairs in this part of the country. On the 23d Mr. Coote received a very polite anfwer to the letter he had written to Sujah Dowlah, Nabob of Oude \ which aflured him of his attachment to the Englijb •, and that if the French had not marched out of his dominions before the receipt of the major's letter, he certainly fhould have made it his bufinefs to have fecured them, and afterwards to have given them[ '74 1 1757- them up into his hands. But on the 26th, notwkhftanding thefe profeffions '—v—' of friend /hip on the part of Sujah Dowlah, the major received certain intellj. gence, that the French flill continued in his province; and on the 29th he received a letter from Mr. Pearkes; reprelenting the ill ufage he and his people had met with from Cojah JJhruff's Peons, and requefting him to fend a party to his affiftance, as he was really in danger of lofing his life.- Mr. Coote on the receipt of this letter, immediately wrote to Cojah AJhruff, ordering him to wait upon Mr. Pearkes, and deliver up to him thofe people who had ufed him ill, otherwife that he would go himfelf, and find them out. The major wrote alfo to Mr. Pearkes, and communicated the contents of this letter, and added, that if there was a neceffity, he would march immediately to his affif- tance. On the 1 ft of September, Mr. received an order from Major Kilpatrick, who then commanded the army at Muxadabad, to return thither with his whole detachment; and the next morning he began to put thofe orders in execu tion, by fending off the train of artillery, bullocks, and Lafcars, under the efcort of a Jamedar, and 19 Sepoys, who were to march over land.—On the 4th, he lent to the Rajah, requefting him to haften the boats, anil the other things which were neceliary for his departure. — On the 7th the troops were embarked; but from their not being provided with a fufficient number of boats, there was a neceflkv for crouding a large party of Sepoys into one, by which the Chuppar, or upper flight deck, broke down, killed one man, and wounded 10 more. — That night the detachment arrived at Futwah, — On the 8th they left Futwah, but the major finding himfelf greatly indifpofed, was obliged to give up the command to Captain Grant. — On the 13th they arrived fafe at Muxadabad, where Mr. Coote received orders from Colonel Clive to go down to Chandernagore, with the kings troop's, a company of Swifs, and 200 Sepoys-, but as he ftill continued very ill, he was under a neceflity of remaining at CaJJimhuzar for a few days, and Captain Gaupp went down with the detachment. Such was the end of Mr. CW^'s, then, uncommon expedition; which, though it did not iucceed as to its principal object, ' the capture of Mr. Law and his party, yet was attended with great advantages to his country in general, and to the Eajl India company in particular.

BENGAL had but juft beheld the funftiine of peac€ and prorperity, when an event took place which overcaft the whole province: aa event to me, interefting beyond exprefiion, and which was confidered by all, as a public calamity. Mr. Watfon during the whole time of his ftay in India, had been more or lefs fubjed: to overflowings of the bile, which tbrought on either flight fevers, or griping in the bowels; but both thefe .complaints had been always carried off by fweats or ftools. Bleeding was more than once tried as a relief, but by experience we found that hk conftitution could not well bear it, efpecially in hot weather-, as lownefsof fpirits and want of ftrength were always fure to attend the operation. Friday, the 12th of Augufi, Captain Martin paid the admiral an occafional vifit at his country-houle,. and found him a little indifpofed : upon the cap tain's coming away, the admiral defired him to tell me, that if I took an .airing that evening, he fhould be glad to fee me. I went foon after I received the meflage, and was concerned to find him much more indifpofed than ever before, with laflltude, univerfal uneafinefs, and a ftrong difpofi- tion to vomit; the pulfe was low and feeble, his fkin hot and dry. I ad- vifed him immediately to take an emetic; he did; the medicine operated well, and prefently produced a moifture on the fkin, which feemed greatly to relieve him. I recommended his drinking plentifully of fherbet, which promoted a fine perfpiration all the night, and the next morning we all thought him better; his fkin however ftill continued hot, and his pulfe was too quick : He was reftlefs alfo, and as the heat of the day increafcd, 0 j 1 reftleflnefs. I therefore gave him fome faline draughts, and or ered a clyfter to be adminiftered. In the evening he became cool and muc eafierv andwas in good fpirits. All this night his perfpiration con tinued, and he flept with great compofure, 3 la 7C 177 J In the morning of the T4th, he was almoft free of complaint j his fkin was temperate, and his pulfe more regular and itrong. He defired me to read fome letters, which were juft then brought to him in a packet from governor Pigot. They related chiefly to the condudt of Admiral Byng, and the changes which had happened in the miniftry: he refleded, and reafoned much on the uncertain bafis on which an officer's charader (lands, and concluded with obferving how much more hazardous it was for him to err on the cautious, than the defperate fide. He afterwards ordered me to go to the hofpital *, and fend out Mr. Bevis to be with him in my ab- lence. This gentleman had been furgeon of the Blaze, but was now one of my afllftants, and enjoyed a great fliare of the admiral's favour.—With the heat of the day Mr. JVatfon grew again very hot, but in the evening I had the pleafure to find him cool and temperate, and much better in every refped. 1 repeated again the clyfter, and obferving a great deal of bile to come away in his ftools, and that his eyes were a little yellow •, to the faline draughts (of which he took one every two hours) I added fix grains of rhubarb, with a view of increafing the number of his ftools, and by that way carrying off the bile. Acidulated gruels, chicken-water, and whey, were his food. I vifited him early the next morning; Mr. Bevis informed me of the ad miral's having had a good night; and Mr. IVatfon himfelf added, that he was almoft well. I thought fo too, and in great fpirits left him to return to the hofpital, leaving direSions with Mr. Bevis to purfue the fame courfe of medi cines, not doubting but that a few more evacuations by ftool, and the gentle perfpiration he was then in, would by the evening quite free him from all com plaints. But this was the moft fultry day 1 ever experienced in India \ not a breath of air was there for many hours •, both man and beaft, and the very fowls of the air, fo fenfibly felt it, that fome of each fpecies fell down dead. My deareft friend Admiral JVatfon, I may truly fay, loft his life by it. At 11 o'clock he complained much of excefTive heat, and the want of cool air •, and though every door and window in the houfe were thrown wide open, he had no relief. His heat now increafed, his pulfe became feeble, and his head confufed. Mr. Bevis about noon fent me an account of this alarming change. I hurried away to his houfe, carrying with me three blifters, one for the back, and two for the arms, which I put on imme diately. I repeated the clyfter, and with the approbation of Mr. Thomas^ and one of the moft experienced praditioners in the country, I gave him a proper quantity of Dr. James's, powders. It operated well by gentle vomiting and purging, and brought away a great quantity of bile.

The room was alfo fumigated with lemons and vinegar, but alas ! all was to no purpofe, for on Tuefday the 16th, between 8 and 9 in the morning, to our unfpeakable grief, he died'- and a putrefaftion came on to fuch a degree, that in a few hours the body was in an entire ftate of corruption. The next day, his corpfe was buried at Calcutta, attended to the c^rave by Admiral Pocock, by all the captains, and by almoft every officer and feaman of the fquadron. Colonel Clive too, and as many gentlemen from the army as could poffibly be fpared, attended on this melancholy occafion. Many French gentlemen alfo (who through the fortune of war were his pri- foners) and feveral thoulands of Armenians and Indians followed him to his grave nor was there, I believe, an individual among them all, that did not fhed a tear, or give fome other mark of unfeigned forrow. In a word no man ever lived more efteemed, or died more regretted than Admirai TVatfon. A voluntary univerfal mourning, difplayed in fome degree the deep fenfe which the fleet, army, and fettlement, had of his merit. &amp; The Admiral, was the fon of Doftor John JVatfon, prebendary of Wejt- minfier and redor of Cajlle-Camps in the county of Cambridge ; his mother was half-fifter to Sir Charles JVager, admiral of the white, and firft lord commiflioner of the admiralty. Mr. JVatfon was born in the year 1714 ; and loft his father when he was but nine years old •, his uncle Sir Charles Warn continued him at the academy where his father had placed him, and anno 1727 he entered him at the age of 15, in the navy. In the year 17:54 he was made a lieutenant, and February 14, 1737, became a poft captain, being appointed commander of the Garland of 20 guns. In the feyeral line of battle fhips he afterwards commanded. Captain Wat- Jon highly diftinguifhed himfelf, particularly in the adion of the ?d of May 1747, when even the French admiral made the moft honourable mention of ihl P (t' 6 Prtncefs Louifa) and a few others, in the account he fent to his court or that memorable engagement. In the adion which followed that T ?

His manners were eafy and polite; 1757. he was a lover of temperance and fobriety, though he made no fcruple at his* ' own table occafionally to promote a free circulation of the glafs; and his fenti- ments were generous and noble. Few men, who, like Mr. IVatfon, had been taken from fchool at fo early a period of life, excelled him in epiftolary writing; he ftudied men and things more than books, and was confeffedlv quick and happy in finding out real charafters. He liked, and loved the honeft man, but detefted the hypocrite.—Though firm in his refolutions, he was ever open to convidion, and whenever he thought the public fervice would be benefited by any advice he had privately received, he would be fure to carry it into execution, and after fuccefs had attended it, to declare publicly to whofe counfel that fuccefs was owing. He carried about him the fureft mark of bravery, as well as delicacy; for notwithftanding he was well known to have frequently diftinguifhed him- felf in battle, yet thefe engagements were never the chofen topics of his converfation ; and if by others they were at any time introduced, he was fure not to dwell on thofe circumftances which in the eye of the world refleded honour on himfelf.—In his public, as well as private charafter, he ever Jliewed a proper regard for the religion of his country; was never abfent from divine worlhip on board his own fhip, and was remarkable for {hewing due refped to the clergy in general, and to the chaplain of his own (hip in par ticular ; if at any time indeed their conducl was inconfiftent with the duty of their office, he then became cold and indifferent towards them. In fine •, it may be truly faid of Admiral JVatfon, that he was a kind and faithful hufband, an affeftionate father, a fincere friend, and a gocd citizen. His integrity, humanity, generofity, and diftnterejlednefs * of heart were fuch, * This part of the admiral's charafter was very apparent even in an early part of his life, and which was made known to the public by a fea-officer in 1744, in a book entitled, 'A nar rative of the proceedings of his majefty's fleet in the Mediterranean the following is an ex- traft from it. ' 1 he fame day the Dragon, Captain Charles Watfon, unexpedtedly came to Hieres, which fhip had been lately employed in feveral cruizes, between Toulon and Gibraltar-, and in confequence of her orders was to have cruifed fometime off Cadiz, and then to hava proceeded to Lijbon, where the captain was fure of the benefit of 800 Moid ores freight money ; but the moment he heard of the preparations of the enemy, and the likelihood of their coming out to fea, he made no hefitation. The alluring advantages of a trip to Lijb'on, (the darling wilhes of the captains in his majefly's fleet) with a profpedl of catching an immenfe fortune, on a flation extremely envied and fought after, did not weigh with him, when thofe purfuits were incompatible with the fervice of his king and country. But from the moil dijin- terejied motive, without orders, he, with the utmoft expedition joined the fleet at Hieres, where by this gentleman poflibly loft that confiderable prize which wac taken by the Solehay, to the value of 300,0001.; for at that time he would have been on the very flation, and the Sdelay probably, either at. Gibraltar hay, or protedHng our trade in the Ga/ from the pri vateers. A demonftration of his choofing perfonal poverty in preference of riches, when the true intereft of his country called upon him. Such an ardent zeal, fuch jufl and unbiafled fentiments, fo uncommon, nay, without an example in the navy, cannot but raifeour admira tion to the highell pitch, and infpire us with the moft fervent wifhes for the happinefs of fo much real merit, which cannot be rewarded with too much dillinftion, or public acknow ledgment.' A a 2m ' kktV ' [ 180 ] nri, as to become almoft proverbial among the natives, as well as the Europeans refiding in the Eaft Indies, and for every one of his fuccefsful enterprizes, he rendered from the heart praifes to him who alone giveth the viflory. The admiral married in 1748, the eldeft daughter of John Francis Butler, Efq-, of Morval in the county of Cornwall r and left behind him one fon| the prefent Sir Charles TVatfon, and two daughters. On the Ton, the late king conferred the title of baronet, in honour of his father j and the Eaji India company, in gratitude for the great and effedual fervices the admiral rendered to them, have eredted to his memory a monument in JVeJlminfier Abbey. Admiral Pocock fucceeded to the command of the fquadron : he, and the brave, honeji, deceafed admiral, had lived for many years in the moft perfed amity •, and notwithftanding Mr. Pocock*s importance in this part of the world was greatly heightened by the death of his friend, yet I am perfuaded he was as thoroughly concerned for him, and as much lamented his lofs, as any one gentleman in the fquadron *. Soon after the interment of Mr. Watfon, Admiral Pocock aflembled all- the officers who had been particularly dependant on his predecefibr, and affured them, that he was their fellow-fufferer in the death of the admiral,, whofe memory he muft always have in the higheft efteem, and that he fhould think himfelf peculiarly happy in ferving thole whom Mr. Watfon had dif- tinguifhed by his more immediate patronage. He repeatedly defired us all to reft fatisfied with the fincerity of this affurance •, and told Mr. Watforis lieutenants in particular, that if they chofe to continue abroad with him, he would take them all, as vacancies fhould happen, on board his own fhip, and promote each of them in turn, in preference to any other recommenda tion. Almoft all thefe gentlemen did continue under his command, and were afterwards accordingly raifed by the admiral to the rank of poft-cap- tains. Mr. Pocock had no fooner taken the fupreme command of the fqua- dron, than a bufy fcene opened to his view •, it was introduced by the fol lowing letter from Commodore James, 1 R. To George Pocock, Efqj &amp;c. &amp;c..

They all anchor'd at Pondicherry that day at noon, but as they approached us fafb, (and with fuch an apparent profpedl of coming up with us) I imagine, thev would not have left off chace, but for the apprehenfion of being car ried to leeward of their port. I had an opportunity of making the following remarks upon the fleet.—The commanding (hip was the neareft but one, with a St. George's flag at the fore-top-maft head; 1 counted, and with great cer tainty, fifteen lower deck ports of a fide. Seven more of the fleet appeared large, and are at leaft two-decked (hips •, the other two were long and low, and appeared to be frigates of thirty-four or thirty-fix guns each. The VGloire a French frigate, lay at the fame time at Pondicherry^ fo that in all they have now eleven fail. Captain ¥ownley, after we feparated, flood on to MadrafS) from whence he propofed failing in a few hours to join you. I was but five days to Ballafore road, fo. that I imagine he may be hourly expefted. On the 5th of this month, the Bofcawen^ Braund, Norfolk, Bonham, Princefs. Augufia, Bade/on, and 'Tavifiock, Jenkins, bound to China^ arrived ztMadrafs \ they left England in March with Admiral Coats bound to Jamaica, and kept company with Commodore Stevens \n thz Elizabeth, with ^Yarmouth, Wey mouth, Colchefter and Queenhrough men of war and Warwick India man, all bound to India, as far as Madeira, where they (topped on the 12th of Aprils while thefe fhips proceeded on by themfelves. As we only juft fpoke with them at fea, I did not learn any extraordinary news, nor fhall I take up any more of your time, as I hope for the honour of waiting upon you in per- fon to-morrow. This early intelligence (for the Revenge had only 4 days and 18 hours paf- fage from St. David's to Ballafore road) was of great importance, and indeed of the utmoft confequence, as it put Calcutta and our iquadron on their guard, for until now we were totally ignorant of any French fhips of war being in: India. We had only three line of battle (hips left, xht Kent having been condemned; and the Cumberland was a fingle fhip at Culpee, thirty miles down the river from Calcutta, preparing to heave down, and not expeding an enemy, was in no condition to receive one. The French fleet *, which had touched at Porto-Novo, a Dutch fettlement, to the fouthward of Pondicherryi for intelligence, had from thence (leered along (bore in the * This was a part of that fleet, of which the Eaji India direftors had given fo early intelli-- gencc as 17,56.

September, 1757. night .5, \[ night; and without making any fignal by guns or lights, anchore.d in Fort St. David's road. Our cruizers (landing in from the lea, had done the fame about 7 o'clock in the evening, and the next morning at the break of day were found to be in a very critical fituation: The French (hips were firft difcovered, getting under fail, had Engltjh colours flying, and their number anfwered to Commodore Stevens's fquadron with the expeded India fhips of the feafon. The Revenge being the fouthermoft of our fliips, was by the accident of her ftation in a manner almoft furrounded by them, and an officer of lefs adivity and difcernment than Mr. James might have been fatally deceived efpecially as he had received certain advice but two days before that Mr. Stevens might every hour be expeded.—By an expert and fuperior manoeuvre our fhips were gotten under fail quicker than thofe of the enemy, and by that means foon increafed their diftance ; the French admiral therefore made the general fignal to chace, and feveral other fignals, all with Englijh colours, by which the governor of Fort St, David was fo much deceived, that he fent off Mr. Newton, a gentleman of the council, to congratu late, as he thought, Mr. Stevens, upon his arrival, and to invite him on fhore i and fent alio four Mojjulas, or country boats, to accommodate him, and any of the gentlemen of the fquadron, over the furf. Mr. Newton was in the firft boat, and adually went a-long fide of the French admiral, before he was convinced of his miftake, and was thus made a prifoner. The other boats took the alarm upon the French fhips firing at the Revenge, and rowed in fhore, and Mr. James had the prefence of mind to throw into them, for the reinforcement ot I'ort St. David, near one hundred recruits, which he took out of the India men mentioned in his letter to Admiral Pocock on their paflage to Madrafs. He left his own boats, an officer, and fixteen Lafcars, to aflift in landing t them, and eluded the purfuit of the enemy, with no other lofs or inconvenience, than having fome of his ri^P-ing cut, and his fails fired through. At this feafon of the year, the current fets ftrong to the N. E. which, to gether with the S.

In confequence of the death of my good friend Admiral PFatfon, and of my conftitution's being greatly impaired by the unwholefome climate of Ben^ gal, I came to a refolution of quitting the fervice; and having communi cated my intentions to my friend Mr. Doidge the late admiral's fecretary, and^ to Mr. Pye (ftorekeeper to the iquadron) I was happy to find both thefe gentlemen in the fame way of thinking with myfelf. We refolved therefore to throw up our feveral employments, and to return to England by the way of Bajfora, and the great defert of Arabia. But before this fcheme could pollibly be put in execution, it was abfolutely necef- fary for us to get the confent of Rear-Admiral Pocock who 7 upon our. making application to him, politely accepted of our refignation. We had now a little time to look about us, and from political and warlike tranf- adions, turn our thoughts to things, which though not fo important and interefting, were pleaiing and entertaining. In the evening excurfions which I made with Captain Martin Y Mr. Doidge T Mr. Thomas 1 and other friends near Calcutta, we had often observed an ex traordinary ipecies of birds, called by the natives A t gill, or Hurgill, a native of Bengal. They would majeftically Italk along before us, and at firft we took them fox Indians, naked. Upon difcovering however that they were birds, we refolved to fnoot one, to fatisfy our curioiity relative to their exad magnitude and fhape. For this, we frequently went out with fome of our fufils loaded with ball, others with Brijtol drop ; but, though we. had feveral good marks, our repeated efforts were fruitlefs. We had always, been attended by the Bearers of our Palanquins, in whofe countenances we could not but difcern the mofb evident marks of fatisfadion, on our want of fuccefs •, at length one of them gravely told us, ' That if we tried eternity to kill thefe birds, we fliould never fucceed, for that the fouls of the Brahmins poflelfed them.' We at laft grew weary of the purfuit, and gave it over. But one evening as I was returning from Calcutta, to. a houfe which had been lent me in the neighbourhood, I obferved one fly ing very flowly over my head, and afterwards to perch on a tree by which; I was to pafs; I took not the leaft notice to my Bearers, until they were within the diftance of 30 or 40 yards, when I ordered them to ftop, and' having in my Palanquin a loaded fufil, L difcharged it at the Monfter, and. brought him down.. The following are the exafl marks and dimenfions of this bird: The wings extended 14 feet 10 inches. From the tip of the bill to the cx-r- tr.emity of the claw, it meafured 7 feet 6 inches. The legs were naked,, and y[ 184 ] and fo was one half of the thighs; the naked parts were full 3 feet m length The feathers of the wings and back were very ftrong, and of an iron colour. The feathers of the bread were long : Over the belly was a areat deal of down, all of a dirty white. The bill was 16 inches round at the bafe, of different colours, and nearly of a triangular (hape. In the craw was a ferapin or land tortoile 10 inches long •, and a large black wale cat was found entire in it's ftomach. Havino- already mentioned the Beetle-nut as a favourite with the Indians^ (and which they chew with chunam, or fhell lime, and the leaf of an aro matic fhrub that grows like a vine, and is fupported on fticks as our fcarlet beans, called alio Beetle-leaf) I (hall here fubjoin a brief defcription of the Arkaxxt^ which produces the nut. It is a fine flender upright tree, not above 6 inches thick at bottom, but grows to upwards of 30 feet high, and is jointed at about 8 or 9 inches diftance, perhaps the laft year's growth : it contains a large quantity of pith, the woody part being thin, but as tough as whalebone. The leaves grow in the fame manner as thofe of the Cocoa-nut tree, very long, and with a ftrong, large middle rib; the flower comes out between the concave part of the leaves. The nuts are numerous, and out of the hulk (which is yellow on the outfide, brown and fibrous within) the fruit is about the fize of a large walnut, and of the fliape and colour of a nutmeg, though fome are round. The extraft of this, nut feems to be the terra Japonica ; for after boiling fome of thofe nuts with a little chunam in the water, the decoftion is the colour of that drug, and taftes like it. This nut, wrapped with chunam in the BeetU- leafy is not only chewed all over India, by men, women, and children, but is ufed likewife as an emblem of peace and friendlhip, being fent by the Rajahs and princes to thole with whom they intend to live in friendlhip, and is given to you on all vifits you make to the natives. There is alfo in Bengalzn elegant, large, fpreading flower tree, called Chulta: the leaves are a pale but pleafant green, deeply furrowed above, and highly ridged below; they grow in bunches, in a plume-like form, and round the end of the branches. The flower is at firft a hard green ball, on footftalks about 4 inches^ this opens, and the calix is compofed of 5 round thick fucculent leaves; the corolla is alio 5 fine beautiful white round petals: the ftamina are numerous and lingueform ; ftyles fixteen, and lancelated. They ftand in a radiated manner, and after one day the corolla falls off, and the ball clofes again, when it is fold in their markets. There is a fucceflion of thefe for feveral months, but no other appearance.—The Mango tree is plenty in Bengal, which grows to a large fize, and fpreads much ; the wood is brown, and ufed only for indifferent work, the leaves are a fine green, and grow in bunches at the extremity of the branches. The flowers grow on a fpike at the end of the branches, and at the extremity of the flower hangs one, two, and fometimes three Mangos. The fruit, when ripe, is yellow and reddifh, full of a fine agreeable juice: Some Mangos are very full of thread,[ 185 J thread, or hair-like fibres •, the juice runs out of thefe on cutting, or with a little handling*, the others which have few or no fibres are much the fined •, they cut like an apple, but more juicy, and I have feen feme as big as a large man's fift. The form is oval, and they contain a large kernel /-in a tough hufk near half as big as. the fruit •, this flone is taken out of the green ones which are pickled and carried to England. The ripe fruit is. very wholefome, and except very fine pine apples, is preferable to any in India i the gentlemen eat little elfe in the hot months, when they are in fea- fon, if no wine is drank with them, they are apt to throw out trouble- fome but*'healthful boils. In the walks at Bengal they have a tall tree, called the ^Fatoon, and which Captain Birch is faid to have firft brought from England. 7'he leaves are of a deep fhining green, the lower part rather p.der, where it is ribbed, and undu lated round the edges. 1 faw no flowers, but the fruit is of the fize, fhape and colour of an olive ^ it hath a modcrane thin hufk, and contains a kernel, like that of the date : five or fix grow on the fame pedicle.——Near Calcutta is a large fpreading tree called the Rujja, which makes a fine appearance when in full bloom. The natives fay that this, and another near the Dutch fettlement, are the only two in Bengal-, they pretend likewife that they could never find the feed, which muft certainly be a miftake, becaufe there is abun dance, and large. That they could not preferve them may be true, becaufe the ants and other vermin are exceffively fond of them, fo that you can never find a pod untouched either by infers within, or ants; Mr. Thomas attended the tree daily for a confiderable time to procure a whole pod, but in vain. The bark is brown and rough-, the leaves are a deep green, but bright; they are pinnated, 4 pair and an odd one, or 5 pair on every pinna; feveral of thefe grow round every branchy which makes the whole bufhy. The flower grows out between the lower leaves of the pinnas, on a fliort but ftrong footftalk ; this divides and fubdivides into a great number, lb as to make the whole a hemifphere. On the top of each of thefe, is a flower of a bright crimfon, orange, and different ihades down to yellow ; they are monopetalous; the cup is about an inch long, divided above in four, ten ftamina, and one ftyle: they almoft cover the tree, and there is a long fucceffion of them, but little fmell. The fruit is a pod of the fhapc and fize of a large garden bean, containing 4 or 5 large flelhy feeds, which eafily fall in two when dry ; they are brown on the outfide, white within, nearly fquare, but convex on the fides. The latter end of Offoher, the Indian inhabitants near Calcutta, were or dered by the governor and council to remove from the black town, and to build houfes for themfelves on another fpot, at a greater diftance from the fort. This was owing to the governor and council's refolution in confequence of Colonel dive's advice, to enlarge and well fecure Fort William, which could not be done, whilft the Indian town was Handing. It muft be owned, that the natives received but a fhort notice to remove themfelves and families j but certain intelligence having been received, that the country B b Rajahs,[ &gt;86 j Rnahs were aflembling troops with a view of difpnting the late acquired a uhority of Meer Jaffier, it was therefore thought indifpenfably necefiary that the' fortrefs fhould with the utmoft expedition be put on a much more rcfpeftable footing, than what it had ever heretofore been. Accounts are here kept in imaginary or current Rupees, Annas, and Pices. The Rupee is valued in the company s calh at 2 ^ 3 d. 16 Annas make a Rupee. 12 Pices make an Anna. Cowry fhells are alfo current here on account of the cheapnefs of provr* fions •, thefe vary as to their value, from 4000 to 4800 to the Rupee, as hath already been noticed. It muft alfo be obferved that the Arcol and Pondicherry Rupees have aa advance or Balta of 8 per Cent, over the current Rupees. 1 hofe of Bombay have a Eatta of 10 per Cent. New Siccas or Royal Rupees have a Batta of 20 per Cent. But the latter lofe in their value 2 per Cent, every year, until they are re joined. - II •;! •; Y i wy{ ' CHAP.fck ^ r 3 C H A P. XIII.

THE beginning of the month of November, was fpent in taking leave 1757. of our many friends, both of the fquadron, and of Calcutta \ and in writing letters to many others on the Coromandel coaft, expreffing our gra titude for the many civilities and a6ts of friendfhip they had fhewn us, dur ing our refidence among them. The polite and friendly treatment, we had all experienced on our arrival, and during our ftay in India, from the prin cipal families refiding in thofe places, required that this compliment fhou!d be paid to them. In truth, the hofpitality and generofity ftievvn to ftrangei s in general in this country, are beyond expreflion ; nor is it poflible to point out a part of the world where the fpirit of charity is more nobly exerted than in our Eaft India company's fettlements: numerous inftances might be mentioned, where princely fubfcriptions have in a few hours been railed, and applied to the effectual relief of many unfortunate families. On Saturday the 19th of November we left Calcutta, and embarked in a fmall boat on the Ganges, ' being provided with a letter of recommendation from Mr. Gee, a free merchant in Bengal, to Baron Kniphaufen, gover nor of the ifland Karec in the Ferfian gulph.) A young gentleman named Figot, (late furgeon of a bomb-veffel) went with us from Calcutta, with a view of getting a paflage to England in an European (hip from Bombay, A3 fo long and dangerous a journey was before us, we thought it neceflai'y, for ^ the good regulation of our little party's affairs, to appoint Mr. Boidge to ad as our chief, invefting him with the fupreme diredion ; and Mr. Pye we conftituted our fecretary. Mr. Boidge had in charge Tome difpatches of importance from Admiral Pocock to one of the Secretaries of State, and to the Secretary of the Lords of the Admiralty. He was entrufted alio with B b 2 other,®C »88 ] I7 r 7 others from the governor and council of Calcutta to the directors of the ^ Eafi India company. On Monday the 21ft, we and our fervants repaired on board his majefty's fhip the Cumberland^ which from the time file entered the river, had beetv ftationed at Culpte *. On the 25th we embarked in the Revenge, an armed Frigate belonging to the Eajl India company, which had been ordered by the admiral to carry us to Bombay, and which at this time was ftill com manded by Commodore James, whom I have had often occafioa to men tion. On our entering the Revenge, the commodore was fo&gt; complaifant as to honour us with a falute of 11 guns. In the afternoon we anchored at Ingeke. An incident happened during our palTage from Calcutta to« Culpee, which at the inftant diverted our company not a little,, and though but of I'm all confequence in itfelf, yet as it conveys an idea of the Indian cuftoms in this particular, the inferting it may, not be altogether unacceptable. One day we received a meflage from a farmer of that part of the country which belonged to our India company, requeftirg admittance to us on an affair which to him was very interefting. We were told, that he ha'd a petkion-to offer, and I was appointed to receive the petitioner in form,, becaufe 1 was the mod corpulent perlbn of the party; my fellow-travellers having pleafantly oblerved, that corpulency in this country is always efteem- ed an infallible mark of heaven's favour, and which it never beftows on any but its peculiar favourites. Upon his being introduced into the cabbin of our veflel v he immediately proftrated himfelf at my feet, kiffed my fhoe, and laid before me four or five rupees, with a remnant of cotton-cloth. He then was defired to feat himftlf, and to relate his bufinefson which, he complained much of the oppreffions he had lately fuffered from the Zemindar of his diftrift, expatiated on the feveral particulars, and intreated our aflift- ance, by a letter addreffed to fome gentlemen of confequence at Calcutta. It appearing to us that he had really been very ill treated, I ftated his cafe in a letter to Mr. Becher, a gentleman of the council, with whom T thought I- might take that liberty •, and fince have had the fatisfaftion to hear^ that Mr. Becher in confequence of my application, fo kindly exerted himfelf in our petitioner's behalf, as to procure him effedhial redrefs.. We wilhed very heartily to have returned the farmer his offering, but we had before learned from many fimilar inftances which had occurred during our ftay in India,. that this could not be done without taking from him all hopes of being relieved-, for he hereby would have underftood, that the letter which wc had given to him. was writtea.rather to his difadvantage, than his benefit. Monday the 28th at nine in the morning, we failed from Ihgeleej and at, the fame hour in the evening, our pilot left us, when we had a fine gale from the north-eaft. December the 2d at noon, we were happy to find . * During the time of her lying here, (he took z.

The boy became fullen from the moment the pilot parted with him, and told the other boys of the fliip, that he was much in love with the girl, and that fhe was then pregnant by him.—We could not but lament the hard fate of thefc two unhappy, buc faithful lovers 1' The 8th, by oblervation at noon, we found ourfelVes in the latitude of 6° 1' north, and in fight of the illand oi{Ceylon, remarkable as hath been already obfcrved for the large quantity of fpice it yields to the Dutch. Beiides fpices, it alfo produces arrack in great plenty.) The Dutch fupply- the other parts of JM# with this commodity, as well as fend a great quan tity to Europe. By age it becomes (as I was told) nearly as rnild and' foft to the tafte, as what they make at Batavia, though, when newly diftilled* it is very fiery and dilagreeable. Wednefday the 14th, in the afternoon, we anchored in Columho road. Mr. Doidge and I went on (hore to pay a vifit to Mr. Knox^ the fupercargo of the Fatty Salem, Captain JVocdfon: we found that he had been very ill,, and that his illnefs had been occafioned by a cold he caught at Galle, in dancing with fome ladies, who were juft arrived from Europe. By what I could learn from Mr. Knox, who had been bred to the praflice of phyfic,, and had treated his diforder as a fever of tile intermittent kind, he had-, unfortunately taken too large a quantity of the Peruvian bark. At this time he laboured under a very confiderable hardnefs on the left lobe of the liver, with a conftipation of the body.—The boluffes of the Mercurius* Alcalizatus, clyfters, and fomentations which I prefcribed, gave him a little relief-, but the next day his delirium returned, and then at his earneft re- queft, made in lucid intervals, he was carried on board the Revenge-, where he died the 18th of a mortification of the bowels and ftomach, much lamented by all who knew him. The town of Columbo, is the chief fettlement of the Dutch on this ifland^ and indeed, next to Batavia on the ifle of Java, is the moft important of any they poffefs in the Eaji Indies. It is fituated on the weft fide ot the ifland, in the latitude of feven degrees north, on a gently rifing ground. '1 he foil is a red land, mixed-with fmall blsfck fhining gravel, which harden to a good pavement in the ftreets. Thefe are all fo judicioufly contrived by eafy afcents and defcents, that no inconvenience can poflibly arife, even trom the 5 greateftt[ 190 ] greateft rains. They are alio very wide, and have a beautiful row of trees on each fide, between which and the houfes, is a very fmooth and regular pavement. Between each tree too, there is a very fine and rcfrcfh- ing grafs verdure, equal, if not fuperior to what we fee in the beft walks of the molt noted gardens in England. The llreets likewife all crofs each other at right angles, and upon the whole are fo elegantly difpofed, and fo very unlike any thing of the kind we had before feen in India, that we could not help admiring the fuperior fkill and ingenuity of the Dutch. After we had fatisfied our curiofity in viewing the beauty and recrula- rity of the buildings, we walked to the extremities of the tov/n, to ex amine the fortifications, which towards the fea are but indifferent. Indeed there is no neceffity for that part being very ftrong, as no enemy can ap proach near enough to do them any confiderable damage; they have wifelv therefore turned their chief itrength towards the land, and have fo well executed their defigns, we may venture to fay, that all the Europeans ip India, colleded into one army, would be able to make very little, if any' impreflion at all upon the place. The citadel is of an irregular figure, occafioned by the form of the ground on which it {lands; the wall feems to be built of very good and large (tones ; the baftions are very extenfive; and round moit part of the town there is a double wall. Here is alio a wet ditch, full fixty feet wide, and a covered way, and^Wj, where the ground will admit of it. The Butch zx. this place, feem to be as capable of defending themfelves againft an enemy by the good difpofition they have likewife made of their water, as by the ftrength of their fortifications; for they have fo contrived it, that a man cannot poffibly approach the citadel under any cover, though at a little diftance a Itranger would be apt to imagine, that the whole town was built in a wood. There is always a garrifon here of thirteen hundred Europeansj all fine looking, healthy young men ; for in our whole day's walk we did not fee three foldiers who appeared to be forty years of age. Among other military and naval ftores, we could not help taking notice of a great number of fine mafts, fome of which appeared as large as the middle piece of a feventy gun ihip's main-maft. e weie introduced to the governor of Columho, (who from his lofty deportment towards us, and the great authority he pofTefies in this part of the world, may be juflly ftiled High and Mighty) by Mynheer Planchard, his matter of ceremonies ; but our reception was fo cool, that we entertained a veiy mean opinion of the governor's civility to itrangers. As to Planchardy Ins open countenance befpoke a mind quite happy and at eafe, and he very lociably drank his bottle of wine with us at the public houfe the firft night alter our arrival ; but never took the leaft notice of. us afterwards. This change m his behaviour, was in all probability owing to the influence of Mynheer shrewder the governor; between whom and Commodore Jmes no in o civilities had paft, as the manner of faluting, and returning the lalute, could not be adjulted between them. We obferved nothing worthy ' . of' . [ l 9 l ] of remark in the inhabitants of this place, except that the breads of the men, 1757. who were natives of Ceylon, appeared to us of an uncommon fize. While -v— we lay here, three delerters from the Dutch came on board of us \ two were hollanders, and the third Alexander M c IntoJh, a Scotchman, The laft I engaged as my fervant, and he was added to our party. Saturday the 17th of December we fet fail from Columho, in company with, an Englijh merchant-fhip from Bengal. On the 19th we were off Anjengo, on the Malabar coaft, and then buried Mr. Knox, the Revenge firing half- minute guns. Anjengo lies in the latitude of 8° 35' north, and is the fouth- ernmoft of our fettlements. Mr. Moor came on board with Mr. Spencer the Chiefs compliments to Commodore James and his paflengers, defiring the pleafure of their com pany at his houfe. Here we were genteely and hofpitably entertained, till the 23d. Our mornings we fpent in reading, or rather feafting on the many news-papers, magazines, and political pamphlets, lately brought from Europe. The evenings we paft on the river in the Chiefs barge, with our mufkets, in purfuit of alligators. The groves on each fide the river, are chiefly planted with cocoa-nut trees, and are inhabited by men and women in almoft a pure flate of nature, for they go with their breads and bellies entirely naked: this cuftom prevails univerfally throughout every Caft^ from the pooreft planter of rice, to the daughter or confort of the king upon the throne. Here, for the firft time, I faw pepper grow: the plant is a creeper that runs up and around trees; and I found the tree which gives the Cmgery, or 'Tellicherry * bark, to be the moft common fupporter of it. This grows to the fize of our common cherry tree; the pepper, like the ivy, entwines itlclf about the tree, and fends off clullers, refembiing the firft fliootings of a bunch of grapes. A great variety of doves are found here; one fort is green, and larger than the common pidgeon. Here are alfo fnipes, a few woodcocks, hares, and wild hogs, but no partridges. The fea abounds with Sardinias, Mullet, Horfe-mackrel, Rock-filh, Eels, young Sharks, Nayer- hfli, &amp;V. Anjengo fort is fmall, but neat and ftrong ; it is a fquare with four baf- tions, having eight guns mounted on each, carrying a ball of eighteen pounds. Two of thefe baftions face the fea, the other two the country,, _ * rins oark was many years ago recommended to me by Mr. Sue mi, late furgeon of his majefty's dock-yard at Port/mouthy under the mime of the Cort de Pala, as an excellent fuccedaneum to the Peruvian or Jefuit s bark ; and when I got to India I frequently ufed it with fuccefs. It is no where to be met with but on the Malabar coaft; and fhould a large quantity be wanted, it cannot be f urchafed at Bombay on a fudden, but timely notice muft be given for it's being procured from Tsllicberry. 5 Befides1757' [ 192 ] Be fides thefe, there is a line of eighteen or twenty guns pointing towards the Tea, of eighteen and twenty-four pounders. About a pittol fliot from the back of the^fort, runs a river, which, befides its being a fecurity to the fadory, adds much to the agreeable fituation of the place. This river has its fource in fome diftant mountains, and defcending in a courle from the north and eaft, it afterwards turns in feveral pleafing meanders fo far to the weft, as to wafh the bottom of our fat5lory's garden, and at bft winding to the fouth, it empties itfelf into the fea. Several beautiful fmall iflands too, which are wafiied by its current, diverfify the fcenery, and greatly heighten the beauty of the profped. * I he following paflage in Guthrie's hiftory of the world, proves however that this maxim c\ the cidelt fon of the female line fuccecding to the throne, is not entirely confined to the Malabar coaft. ' According to the eftabliflied order offucceflion among fome of the jfcthiop 'tc nations, upon the death of the king, his fifler's Ton mounted the throne: and in cafe the female branches ot the royal family failed of ilTue, thty chofe the molt beautiful and valiant perfon among thero tor their king. ,, Vol. 5. page 252. The firft evening we fpent in the barge, we were accompanied by a Marchan, ox Moorman, governor of 12 Carricars, or officers of diftrids, all under the king of 7 ravencore. This Moor drank beer and wine, with as much fatisfadion as any of us. He had no covering for his back, and the evening being fomewhat fharp, one of our company exprdTed his fear that the air would be too cold for him; to which he chearfuily replied, ' The weather, while I am in the company of Englijh gentlemen, is never too cold, or any way difagreeable.' About feven miles up the river, at a place called Attinga, and at the diftance of half a mile from the water, is a Pagada or temple of the Gentoos, in which the queen of Attinga refides. Till of late, the town and country of Attinga were quite independent of the king of Travencore, but now they are tributary to him.) The eldeft fon of the queen of Attinga is always heir apparent to the crown of Travencon* 'We remarked at this place, a fingular maxim of (late policy, adopted by the kingdoms on the Malabar coaft. To afcertain to themfelves a fuccef- fion of princes, defcending from the pure and royal blood of their antient monarchs, the right of fucceflion to the throne is determined to belong to the eldeft fon of the female line: hence, a king's fon in this country is pre- cifely on the fame footing with a daughter of the French king, only with this difference (or rather degradation) that the young Malabar prince, being ranged (like all others of the Nayer or royal Caft) among the fecond €ajl or clafs.of the nation, gives place in rank to the Brahmins*. This fettlement fupplies our Eajl India company with pepper*, and its fituation is alfo very convenient for giving proper intelligence to our fhips touching here from Europe, or from any part of India.) The prefent chief, Mr. Spencer, is a man of an excellent character both for probity and fagacity;Ig ui [ r 93 I the greateft harmony and fatisfadlion fubfift among the inhabitants in his government *. December the 25th at noon we anchored in Cochin road, a fettlement be longing to the Dutch, in the latitude of 9 0 50' north. We dined with the chief, De Toung, by them called commandant; he was a very obliging little man. After dinner we drank fuccefs to the king of England, the llates of Holland, See. and when our wine was finifhed, we took a'fliort ride to the company's country honfe, in fingle-horfe chaifes, accompanied by the commandant and the late chief of guilon. (The town of Cochin is not unpleafant, but in point of grandeur, regularity, and indeed in every other reipeft, it falls greatly fliort of Columho. We found the Dutch in this fet tlement involved in difputes with the country powers, whofe head is ftiled Samoreen, a title equal to king. This prince had lately taken a fort or two trom the Dutch, at about ten leagues diftance from Cochin, they were then aflfembling forces to oppofe him, and for that purpofe had already landed three or four hundred foldiers from Batavia. From this place, the Dutch are chiefly fupplied with pepper. The fortification is irregular, but ftrong enough to refill any country power, and has forty or fifty guns facing the fea. Many families of Jews are eftablifhed here ; their anceftors were found on this fpot by the Portuguefe at their firft fettling in the country; and the general opinion is, that they are defcendants of fbme Jews who travelled hither foon after the final deftrudion of the temple. One Ezekiel a Rabbi is now living at Cochin, a man of confequence, and his word is held in high eftimation; he is a lover of fcience, and underflands aftronomy. W e could not but take notice at this place, of a great number of the Cochin or Elephant legs. This is a diforder peculiar to the inhabitants of the Malabar coaft, and efpecially to thofe of Cochin. It feems to be merely an cedematous fwelling, anfing from an impoverifhed ftate of the blood ; and in many perfons the leg is of fo enormous a fize, as to occafion it's being called the Elephant-leg, having greatly the appearance both in fhape and bignefs of the Elephant's. I could not learn that any remedy for this diforder had been difcovered by the natives, and as they feldom or never apply to Europeans for afliftance, I believe they are feldom if ever cured: but were they to do lo, probably it would but little avail, fince an alteration from the pooreft to the moft cordial and nutritious diet would certainly be recom mended to them, and we well know, that every Cafi of Indians are fb much wedded to their own particular cuftoms, they would fooner choofe to die, than materially to alter their ufual courfe of living, even if their circum- liances permitted it-f. The generality of thofe who labour under this * This gentleman is fince dead. f Of this, we had feveral inftances in our long paflage to Bengal, among the Sepoys under the command of Colonel C/w^, who perifhed becaufe they would not partake of the fliip's proviuons after their own had been expended. 1757- Cc diforder.r 194 i diforder, feldom are able indeed to call in any afliftance, being compofed of the very pooreft of the people, who feed chiefly on Sardinia:, and can not purchafe even the fmallcft quantity of rice to boil with the fifh for their daily fubfiftence. 1 was informed, that thefe poor wretches are fup. ported for whole weeks together, perhaps months, with no other aliment than what this fpecies of fifli affords •, and their drink is water only, unlefs by way of regale they now and then procure a draught of the fimple un- fermented juice of the cocoa-nut-tree, called Toddy. The 28th we failed from Cochin, and on the 31ft anchored at Tellicherry. The next day {January ift 1758) we dined with our company's chief, Mr. Hodges, who was fo polite as to introduce us to every gentleman and lady of the fettlement. After dinner, many loyal healths went round, with firing of cannon at each interefting toafl:. Tellicherry is a fettlement in- dependant of Anjengo, but both are fubordinate to Bombay.) Befides it's own garrifon, there are leveral other forts in the neighbourhood ; one to the fouthward, at about a mile diftance, and therefore called Mile-end, and eight or nine to the northward, all under the government of the chief here. Thefe forts are of no other ufe but to- fecure the pepper-trade, by preventing the natives from clandeftinely bringing it to the water's fide, to the prejudice of our commerce. Tellkherry fort is fituated on a rifing ground, but there is another hilt within cannon fhot yet higher, on which llands a little inconfiderable fort. Was this laft in pofleflion of an enemy, it would entirely command that of 'Tellicherry. ( About two miles to the fouthward, on a very fine eminence, is the French fettlement of Mdhie, the only one of confequence that nation has on-- the Malabar coaft. ' Juft before our arrival at Tellicherry, our fadlory having unfortunately loft their furgeon, a French gentleman of that profeflion at Mahie, notwithftanding the war between the two na tions, occafionally vifited our fick, and Mrs. Hodges had been fome time under his care ♦. Our garrifon for the defence of Tellicherry, and it's neighbouring forts, confifts of about four hundred European troops, and as many Topajfes. Almoft the whole time we continued here, the Brijiol Frigate (formerly an Englijh privateer, but which had been taken^ by the hrench) lay at anchor off Mahie. This fhip^ after having landed forty or fitty foldiers, took in fome pepper, and failed (as we then imagined) for Mauritius. About four miles from TtUicherry, there is a t fmall ifland, belonging to the Englrjh, called Damapatan, on which Mr. Doidge' difcovered a fpring of excelleiit' wate^ before Unknown to our people. * ( ' : to 1 . . ♦v Pondicherry in the year 1761, an armament was equipped agalnft 0 , Mahie &gt; under command of Major Hetfor Monro, who in concertt x^Hodgts, took the place, though defended by abov? zoo pieces of cannon.[ '95 1 We failed from Tellicherry, the 3d of January, and on the 8th anchored 175S. in the road of Goa. The fame afternoon, we paffed pleafantly up the river v in a boat belonging to a Portuguefe nobleman, accompanied by the Rev. Mr. Howel of Bombay, who embarked on board our frigate at Anjengo. 'Goa is the principal, and almoft the only fettlement which remains to the Portuguefe, of all the large poflefllons they once had in the Eaft Indies. It hath been generally governed by a vice-roy fent from Europe, but was now under the adminif- tration of the archbilhop, and two of the principal people, who afted as regents. The late vice-roy was killed in a battle with the Maharattas, (in the year 1756,) who inhabit the country at the back of Goa, and with whom the Portuguefe have for feveral years carried on a troublefome war. Goa is an ifland; there is properly no town, but many pleafant villas belonging to the merchants are fcattered up and down ; fome are moft agreeably fituated on the fides of hills, but the greater part on the banks of the river, for the convenience of landing goods. There are alfo feveral houfes built on the oppofite continent, from which Goa is not fepa- rated above three miles at the broadeft part. Upon an hill on the left fide of the entrance of the harbour, they have a line of about fifty guns, which is called the Alguardo \ and as you go farther in, they have a fort on the top of another hill, which entirely commands the harbour. There are many churches and monafteries here, fome of which were once fuperb ; the decay of thefe, and moft of the other public buildings, too plainly fhews the pre- fent ruinous ftate of the Portuguefe power and trade in this part of the world. However, the infamoufly cruel Court of Inquifitkn reigns here in all it's fury, and primitive diabolical glory. We left Goa the i ith, and on Monday the 24th of January, anchored in Bombay harbour. We found a confiderable addition bad been made the laft year to the flrength of the fortifications towards the fea, under the direction of Captain IDefunk, engineer-, a Swede by birth, and efteemed a man of ability in his profeffion. Juft before our arrival at Bombay, it unfortunately happen ed, that Major Mace (late of the king's artillery) touch'd there from Europe^ with a commiffion from the Eaji India company, appointing him engineer general of all their garrifons. Captain Be funk looked upon this commiffion of the major's, as a difhonour done to himfelf, and accordingly in great dif- guft quitted the company's fervice. Many imagined, that the refignation of this gentleman would be attended with circumftances very difadvan- tageous to the company ; as by his abfence Major Mace would necefiarily be detained in Bombay at a time when his beft abilities and fpeedieft fervices were required at Calcutta, in order to put its fortifications in a proper ftate of defence. It was known indeed, that Captain Browyer (an engineer in the company's fervice) had not yet left Calcutta, but then it was faid, that his ill health would oblige him to do it in March next, to avoid the killing heats and rains of the fummer. We expeded to have found the dock at C c 2 Bombayi ! IJ - ■ [ 196 ] j 75 S. Bombay capable of receiving a ihip of feventy guns, agreeable to the re- --V —' peated aflurances given to Mr. IVatfon j but we were difappointed in this particular, the hands to carry it on being very fcarce : however, Mr. Hou?h luperintendant of the company's marine here, was indefatigable in his en deavours to finifh this work of immenfe labour, and the dock is now com. pleated. Commodore (afterwards admiral) Stevens was hereobliged to heave down the Elizabeth, one of the (hips of his fquadron, to ftop a confiderable leak, but in the firft attempt, flie had the misfortune to fpring her main- maft, by which accident he was detained a longer time than he wifhed. We learned that he left Bombay to join Admiral Pococky a few days before ws arrived, with the crews in health, and his fhips in good condition. As foon as we went afhore, we all waited upon governor Bourchier- who received us very politely, and told us that the Swallow, a fhip be longing to the company^ commanded by Captain Price, was then tab ing in goods for Gombroon in Per/ia,) and if it was agreeable to us, we were welcome to take a paflage in her. — We very gladly accepted the offer. We continued at Bombay waiting for the fhip to be ready, till the 8th of February, when we embarked, having taken into our party my worthy old friend Mr. Alms formerly mentioned, a lieutenant in the navy, but late commander of the Hnrdwick, a large Ihip trading in thefe feas: And Mr. Pigot, who came with us from Calcutta, with a defign of getting a pafr fage from Bombay in one of the company's fhips to England, now gladly accepted of the invitation we gave him, and refolved to accompany us in our journey by land. Mr. Hough * (to whom and to whofe family we were greatly indebted for their polite and friendly behaviour during our refidence at Bombay) (gave us letters of credit, on Gombroon and Bajfora and Sir Jamts houlis was fo obliging as to furnilh us with bills forcalh on Mr. Drummond h our Turky company's conful at Aleppo.) , February 14, pafled hyiSurat, which was heretofore a very populous and rich city, about three miles in circumference, walled round, with fome antique 101 ts to defend it, but which are of no confequence. It is fituated in the kingdom ot Guzarat, and fubjedl to the Great The have a aaory there f and alfo the Dutch, French, Portuguese and Armenians \ thele lait trade very largely, and are very rich.) Surat is about 160 miles diltance from Bombay, latitude 21 0 30' nonh.—Saturday the 25th at noon, y obicivation we found ourfelves in the latitude of 23 0 10' north, and at un let law the coaft of Arabia Felix, which lies in about, thirteen degrees weft longitude from Bombay. The iR. of March at fun rife we ' 1 covered the Perf:an fhore. By noon we were in the latitude of 25 degrees north i and then we caft off a boat called a large Seebar, bound to * This gentleman returned to England, but in a year or two after died in London. t Since the year 1759, ^nglijh have been confidered as principals at Surat. Mufcati,[ '97 ] Mufcat *, which we had in tow all the way from Bombay^ and which had hindered our progrefs very much. Wednefday the 8th, at noon, we got round Cape Jafques, which on the Per/tan fide forms the entrance into the Gulph. At night we had a very hard gale'of wind, which we rode out with two anchors, between the ifiands Ormus f and Larac. The next dav, at 11 in the morning, we anchored in Gombroon road, where we found the Succefs, a veflel of war belonging to the Eaft India company, one of whofe officers came on board and Uold us the difagreeable news, that the Brijiol, a French man of war of 30 guns, had arrived at Bajfora the 8th of laft month, to take under her convoy a merchant fhip which had lain there for fome time.) This frigate we knew to be the fame fhip that lay at anchor off Mahie, during our ftay at Tellicherry, and which we then fuppofed had failed, to Mauritius*. Captain Price went on fhore the fame day we arrived at Gombroon^ and my fellow travellers followed him the next morning ; but finding myfelf) a good deal out of order J, and not knowing how we might fare in lodg ings, T did not leave the fhip till two days afterwards. Alexander Douglas Efq; of the council at Bombay, was chief or agent here. Mr. Moftyn, fon to a: captain of foot in the company's fervice, was next to him, a very, obliging, fenfible young man. Mr. Najh and Mr. Holmes, two writers, and Mr. Parker the Hirgcon, with Mr. Wait, book-keeper to Mr. Douglas, made up the company,., _ * A port town in Arahtd Felix, from whence there is a large trade withwhich hatfii civilized the natives much, and greatly prejudiced them in favour of the Enplijh, more thaA any other European nation. t Ormus was at this rime covered over with fait, which grows two inches thick on the fur- face in a folid cruft, and appears at a diflance, on the hills, like driven fnow. No frefh water is to be found on the i/Iand ; neverthelefs, the Portuguefe at their firft difcovering it in the fifteenth century, from its advantageous fuuation for^trade, built here an eleganc city, and ftrongly fortified it. About 120. years ago, the Perftans with the affiftance of the Englijh ex pelled the Poriugue/e, and the Shah Abbas caufed the fortifications to be demoliihed, 'and re* moved the trade to Qombroon on the oppofite ihore,, allowing the £«?///&amp; great privileges in oommerce. J During our Hay at Bombay I had been feized with a bilious inflammatory fever, which ii&gt; all probability would have been very violent, and attended with the moll imminent danger, had I not on the firft attack happily given diredlions, that the febrifuge powder of Dr. James fhould be adminiftered to me every hour during the (pace of a whole day, which operated fo powerfully on the ftomach, intellines, . kidneys, ami pores of the fkin, that in fix hours after i had taken the firft dofe, all the alarming and moft diftrefsful fymptoms went off. The quan-- tity of bile difcharged from my ftomach exceeded all belief. Indeed I have in the courfe of my practice for fome paft years, experienced fo much benefit from this noble medicine, that I have often., lamented it s fuperior efficacy was not fooner known to me. I am now verily per- 1 fuaded that it is as truly a fpecific in ardent fevers, as the Peruvian bark is in thofe that are intermitting, or as mercury in venereal complaints. However, there is great danger attend ing the common and indifcriminate adminiftration of it; fince it is as certainly true that this powder will deftroy in a putrid, as that it will cure in aiv inflammatory diforder. l! •[ 198 ] 175^ Comhroon is fituated at the foot of a very high mountain, which by inter- cepting the paflage of the land-wind, makes it intolerably hot. At prefent it is a place of no kind of conlequence, except what it receives from the Englijh and Dutch fadories, befides whom, no other European nation has any lettlement here. The two faftory houfes are the only buildings remain ing of any importance -, the whole city befides, is almoft one entire fcene of ruins, which ferved indeed to convince us of its once flourifhing ftare; buc the conftant wars carried on in this country, and their attendants, confufion and anarchy, have deprived the EngUJh of almoft all their commercial ad vantages, and the place of almoft all its inhabitants j the few that remain are only fuch as have a dependance on the two fadories, and a very fmall number of Banian, Gentoo and Perjian merchants who refide there. So different an appearance hath this city now, from what it had when Sir John Char din vifited itl The air is ftill as unhealthy, as it was in the time of that writer; the Per/tans themfelves fly from it in the bad feafon, and few of our faftory efcape putrid, intermitting fevers (which principally ra&amp;e in the months ot May and September) \ and though they fometimes recover, yet it generally happens that their conftitutions are much impair'd •, they lofe the European complexion, become pale, and enervated, and their difeafes terminate in obftrudions of the liver, and adhefions of it to the peritonaeum. Be fides the many conjedures mentioned by Char din and others, on the caufes ot the unwholefomenefs of the Gombroon air in the fummer months; Dr. Boerhaave accounts for it, from the nature of the foil, which as it abounds with lalt, renders it the hotteft part upon the globe in his eftimation, though its latitude doth not exceed 27 0 30'. The white cruft which the fait forms all over the earth, firft attracts, and then reflects the intenfe heat of the fun to the neighbouring bodies, &amp;c. Our countrymen refiding there, judged alio, that the very great quantity of blubber-fifti, left by the fea on the fhore, which at that feafon of the year quickly become putrid, and emit moft offenfive and noxious effluvia, contributed much to render the place un- -healthy. Mr. Douglass garden, adjoining to his houfe, produces however beans, colevvorts, Ipinage, lettuce, onions, and cucumbers; and fo do the com pany s public gaidens at Ajjein, diftant from hence about 12 miles.

There is another tree of this fort in the Cocoa-nut grove at Bombay, on the road to the arbour Malabar hill, which is the third largeft and moft fhady o any I have ever feen; but this laft differs from the other two in this remark^ able circumftance, that none of its branches have defcended into the earth, and formed (as the two others have done) new trunks or trees *. It appears indeed to have made fome efforts towards it, but the rooty fhoots have not yet it 1* S of tTftrwt fp«k e s . rame Ieaf as the 0th ' tWO ' aEd S0es by the ranie n3mf!

Under that on the Coromandel coaft, are the ruins of fome houfes; and it is commonly related (in order to make the tree appear the more marvellous) that this one tree once fhaded a whole town. At a fmall diftance from this tree near Gombroon, there is a Pagoda or temple, in a very ruinous condition, except a fmall part, which is kept in good repair, and much frequented by the Gentoos in their devo tions. The Gentoos likewife worfhip under the (hade of thofe trees which grow near Fort St. David and Bombay, but with this material difference that at the two laft places they have no f Pagodas built with mens hands' any more than the Druids of old had, who under their confecrated oak wor- fliipped one fupreme God, immenfe and infinite, and could not think of confining their adoration to the narrow limits of a temple, which they deemed would be quite inconfiftent with thofe attributes. In like manner the Banian tree is held facred by the Gentoos, who are almoft as fenfibly hurt by your cutting or lopping off one of its fuperfluous branches, as if you were to mutilate or deftroy a cow, between whofe facred horns they often place their hand, when they make their moft folemn oaths, and appeals to the Deity.

Round the company's houfe indeed, '-y- there is a tolerable good garden, and what makes it of more value, there are in it fome wells of excellent water, which is carried every day to Gom broon upon camels for the ufe of the fadory. At the back of the fadory houfe, there are ten or twelve large guns towards the land; and at the entrance of the gate towards the fea, there are a few others, but of fo fmall a bore that unlefs a fliip anchors very near the fhore, and the wind blows at the fame time off the land, their report cannot be heard; which was exadly our cafe, when they returned the falute which w? gave them from the Swallow. The kingdom of Perfta had for feveral years been torn to pieces by civil wars. At this time, there were four competitors for the empire; and till lately there was a fifth named Azet Khan, but his forces were entirely de- feated, himfelf forced to fly to Baghdad for protedion, and his power ruined, by an unfuccefsful battle he fought againft Hamet Scbah r his rival in the Afghan or Pytan country. Nauzir Khan, one of the four, refided at Laar, not far diftant from Gombroon ; and this is he who by the European gentle men there is called Our Khan, as living in their neighbourhood, and to whofe power the governors or Sheicks thereabouts are obliged to fubmit* I was told that this Khan, or general (as is the meaning of the word Kan, Khan, or Cawn in the Per/tan language) had not above five thoufand troops in his pay, but that he poffefied many ftrong-holds and garrifons among mountains almoft inacceffible; and that he had lately forced Kerim Khan* another of the competitors, who with a great army had befieged him in the city of haar, to retire without fuccefs. A fkirmifh happened a few days before our arrival, near Ajfein, which was occafioned by the ill behaviour of a certain Sheick, who being in pof- feffion of a fort with a garrifon of three or four hundred men, frequently interrupted the wool trade from Carminia going to the Englijh and Dutch fadories at Gombroon. Complaint having been made of this to Nauzir Khan, he immediately marched with a body of troops, attacked the fort, and took it; but unfortunately the Sheick made his efcape, with fome of his people, to another petty Sheick in the neighbourhood, who joined the fugitives, and together made up a body of fome hundred men. Nauzir Khan marching againft them in perfon, detached an officer before with a fmall body of troops, who foon got up with the enemy, gave them battle, killed about feventy of them, took prifoners as many more, and difperfed the reft. Elated with this fuccefs, the vidors lay, as they imagined, in per- fed fecurity, and fo fuffered part of their troops to draggle and plunder; one of thefe moroding parties was furprized by their lately defeated enemy, the chief officer of the Khan was killed upon the fpot, with four or five others of inferior rank, and the furgeon of the Englijh fadory at Gombroon was called on to afllft thofe who were wounded. D d Muley[ 202 ] Muley Alj, the Terftan govcriror of Gombroon is an Arab. The iOands ofe Ormus 'znd Larac are fubje^t- to him.^ He has three fhips of war lying at the former, but they-are in no condition to put to lea. The forts under his command'are alio out of re-pair. Bis ufual place of refidence is. Ormus, or he is fure to By thither upon every alarm of the Maris ap- proach •, and as he has been very, backward in paying thofe duties which are required from him, he is under continual apprehenfions of a vifit from that General. Befide the iHands of Ormus and Larac, Kifme another ifland inhabited by Per/mm, but of no great note, is-at ppefent under Mtdey Alf^ government, though till very lately quite independanf of him. The late- governor of this ifland for many years bravely refiijed all the attempts of Muley Aly lived to the age of fourfcore, and died at laft in his bed, at the very time that Muley Aly was befieging his principal fortrefs, which we obferved, as failing-by it, to be advantageouily feated on a hilh. It was generally imagined, that this lait expedition of Muley Alf% would not have been attended with greater fuccefs than his former, had not the death ot the governor given an unlucky turn to the affairs of the fiege. For foon after thate\ent, the garrifon found themfelves under a neceflity of furrendering j and Muley Aly, to give (as he thought) the greater eclat to his fuccefles, caufed the head of the brave, deceafed governor, to be, cut off, and returned in triumph with it to Banderahajfi, zwl. Ormus. This military robber * has- a bad character among our people-, he has been often threatened by Nauzir Khan, and probably would longfince have; been made a public example of, were it not for his connexion with a powert ful- Sheiek on the Arabian fhore, whofe daughter he married, and who is always ready to afiift him with veffcls to traniport him to the ides, and with- troops to defend himfelf there in cafe he fhould be attacked.. I cannot conclude this account of the fituation of affairs at Gombroon, witlv- out paying a juft compliment to the great prudence and fagacity of the Englifo and Dutch fadories eftablifhed there, who 'amidft all the fhocks and convul- fions ot a civil war among the Perftans, have met with little or no interup- tion in their trade from any of the contending parties ; it being a maxim wkh them, to fide openly with none of the competitors, and yet at the fame time to keep well with all: for this end, civil letters, and fometimes pre- fents, have been thought indilpenlably neceffary.. As the Brifiol, the French Frigate, was in Ba£ora river, Mr. Douglas was hereby prevented from difpatching the Succefs Grab with us to Baffora, as he had been directed by the governor and council of Bombay he not^ thinking it prudent, under the prefent circumftances, to truft the company's bales) which were her intended loading, in a veflel of fuch little force.- * It is believed) that he fecretly affifted the French Count de Ejiaing in his attack and conqueft of out tafitory houfe at Gombroon, ia the year 1 759. This[ 203 I This delay was the more dlfagreeable to us, being quite unexpeded, as 1758. no French fhip of war had made its appearance in thofe feas, fince the —v— commencement of the difpute between the two nations. We flattered ourfelves at the time we \th Calcutta, of having a quick paflage to Baf- fora^ and of being able to join the Caravan which goes from thence to Aleppo, early in the fpring •, but unfortunately for us, our views of that kind were now entirely difconcerted! But the interruption we met with from the French fhip, was not the firft difficulty we had experienced in our tedi ous voyage: a thoufand befides'had intervened to prolong our paffage, which coft us many ferious reflexions, efpecially on account of the public idifpatches we were entrufted with, the fpeedy delivery of which we had reafon to believe would be of the utmoft confequence to the nation ; and therefore we thought it our duty to run all rifks in getting to as Fafl; as poffible. Accordingly we refolved to hire one of the common, but uncomfortable veflels of the Gulph, called a Trankey, and to proceed in her to Bajfora, difguifed like Arabs. Upon our making application to Mr. Douglas for this purpofe, he was fo obliging as to fend a boat to Kifme to procure us one but no anfwer arriving from thence for feveral days, we grew quite impatient, and refolved to addrefs Mr. Douglas by letter to favour us with fome veflel to carry us up the Gulph as far as Karec, an ifland belonging to the Dutch •, to the governor of which. Baron Kniphaufen, we had abetter of recommendation. Mr. Douglas, after mature confideration, confented to this requeft, and accordingly ordered the SucceCs Grah^ Cap tain Lindefey, to put us alhore on that ifland. D d 2 CHAP.[ 204 ] P. XIV.

IN the evening of the 17th of March we took our leave of Gombroon \ and on the 19th pafTed by Congo-Bender, formerly a town of elegance and confiderable trade belonging to the Portuguefe, but now in a moft rui nous condition. The fame day we came to an anchor at Ling, a fmall vil lage, about a league from Congo, and there took in another pilot to carry us up to Karec. At eight o'clock we got under fail again with a'fine eafterly wind. Friday the 24th we paffed by the ifles ot Kifme, Polhar,. Kyes, Inderahie, Shittewar, and Bufheel. Some of thefe were quite barren •, on others we obferved a few trees or bufhes, and little fifhing towns, with two or three Trankeys lying on fhore. The Date trees were thinly fcattered among the hills, and though a fmall portion of green might here and there be difcovered, yet fuch was the barrennefs of thefe idands in general,, that it was for fome time a matter of furprize to us, how fheep and goats could poflibly fubfift there : But upon a clofer examination, when afhore, we found that the ground produced a fmall-leaved juicy mallows, which feems to be the principal food of thefe animals. The Perfian coaft afforded a moft romantic profped. It appeared to us at firft to be one continued rock, rent and torn afunder by earthquakes; but we afterwards difcovered, that fome part of it was only fand, hardened by the rains and fun. - I ' ! I ■ On the 25th we had the wind from the north-weft, whi^h obliged us to drop anchor, to prevent the Ihip being driven back by the ebb tide. We[ 205 ] We caught this day feveral forts of fifh ; fuch as the Bonetta, plaice, bream, 1758. conger-eel, &amp;c. &amp;c. At nine o'clock, a breeze fpringing up from the fouth- ' ward, we again made fail, and pafled by a little fifhing town on the Per- ftan fliore, called Shewee, where there appeared to be a fmall fquare fort, which by our pilot's account, has a few guns, and is kept in fome fort of repair. Englijh fhips trading in this gulph from Bombay^ frequently take in rock-falt for ballaft, and fell it on the Malabar coafl: for about thirty Rupees the ton, which is almoft ail clear gain. Captain Lindfey prefented me with two pieces of metal-ore, and one of rock-falt, which he got from the iiland of Ormus^ where both are found in great plenty. In our run thus far from Gombroon^ two prefents came off to us from as many Per/tan Sheicks: One was of a goat, and fome eggs; the other of eggs only. Our captain fent them fome rice in return. We found the wea ther hitherto very cool and pleafant. The evenings were made damp by dews, and we had no caufe to complain of heat in the night, although fix of us flept in one cabbin- Sunday the 26th we found ourfelves abreaft of Narhan point: It termi nates in a long and low piece of land, which runs off into the gulph, from the foot of the Per/tan hills. Mr. Parker, an officer on board the Succefs, informed us, that about two years before, he was between this point and the main land, where he difcovered a channel, in which a fhip of 900 tuns might ride : he farther acquainted us, that the Portuguefe had once a fettle- ment here, (and indeed, upon the main land, the ruins of their fadory- houfe are itill to be feen) where they alfo funk fome wells, the remains of which may eafily be traced. Mr. Parker added, that at this place a large river empties itfelf into the fea, and that the adjacent country is in fubjec- tion to two Arab chiefs. One refides up the country about three miles from Narhan point, and is tributary to the other, who lives on the oppofite fide of the river. Here providence feems to have allotted a fpot of ground, amidft inhofpitable rocks and deferts, capable of affording the kind pro- duftion of vegetables for the benefit of man and beaft. On the 27th at nine in the morning we were abreaft of Cape Ver- dijlan, diftant from Cape Narban twelve leagues. Hitherto in our paf- fage up the gulph, we kept as near to the Perfian fhore as poffible, for the advantage of anchoring when the tide ebbed, or the wind was contrary ; and alfo for avoiding the French frigate, which we were apprehenfive we fhould fall in with, if we approached too near the Arabian fliore. Arabia Felix was at this time governed by two fovereigns j one of whom- refided at Mufcat. This city, is a place of trade, as before obferved, and ftands at the entrance of that part of the gulph which is called Ormus, and is the capital of his dominions, whence the chief is ftiled King of Mufcat. The other has the title of King of Mofcha^ whofe chief refidence is on the borders.206 ] borders of the gulph of that name, otherwife called the Red Sen. Jhefc two princes are no way tributary to the Grand Seignior-, but are both in- dependant in their refpeftive dominions, and govern the whole country of .Arabia Felix, from the fouthern extremities of the two gulphs, even as far .almoft as Mecca. The province of Mecca-\s governed hy a.,Beglerbeg, who rrefides at Judda, and is in a manner an independant fovereign : He ftil es himfelf Monarch, and accumulates great wealth by the rich prefents which are yearly made to him by the devout 'Turks, Arabians^ and Per/tans, in -their pilgrimages to Medina anxi M^cca^ the .birth and burial places of their prophet Mahomet *. h\ the morning of the 2Sth we plainly difcovered the Salt mountains, •(which running out into the fea, form Cape Verdiftan) and opened the ■ high land to the northward of it. We were now in expedation of feeing •theifland of Karec in, a .day or two, being only thirty-fix leagues diftant. This day, .a large, locuft, and a beautiful /ea-fnake, about four feet long, and ten inches round, floated near the veflel. We had little or no wind aU ■this night; but at 7 the next morning, a light, fair breeze fprang up, and -continued till ten, when we difcovered the land Halala on our .ftar- fboard bow, about feven leagues off. On the 30th we came in fight of the .long wifhed-for ifland •, at 3 at night we came to an anchor off Karec^ in 20 fathom water, having had gentle breezes all the day. It lies in 29® a ' north latitude. Early the next morning we made fail again, and foon ran within two leagues of a fort, which llands on the north fide of the ifland, at the end of a low point, that ft retches towards .another flat fandy ifland, called At'half paft eight, a 'Dutch boat came off, with two letters of Mr. Shaw\ •our company's refident at Baffora. One was written in French', addrefled :to the Dutch mafter attendant at Karec, defiring him to fend the other {En- .glijh) letter to all fhips of our nation, which might come to an anchor off •Karec, or be ,feen in the offing. This letter was dated the 9th of March* and informed us of,the BrijloFs being in Bajfora river; that fhe carried 30 guns, had 85 Europeans on board, and that the reft of her complement was made up of Indians and Lafcars, in the whole, about 140 men. Mr. Shaw added, u that (he would probably take in a loading of corn, and con voy another French fhip, which had lain in the river ever fince the com mencement of the war : that this laft was of about 300, or 350 tons bur then, and carried 20 guns three pounders ; that the enemy gave out, .they were to ftay in the ifiver fome months longer, .and fhould they wak to take in frefli corn, this might probably be the cafe; that they had their * A good Turk, Arab, and Moor never fails once in his'life to make this pilgrimage in perfon, but kPerftan generally does it by proxy.

Upon the whole, he gave it as his opinion, that the two French vefTds could not be going yet, but advifed all mafters, in proceeding up the gulph, to call at every port, where he would not fail to lodge intelligence. He concluded with faying, ' that fhould any Englijh fhips get into Bajfora river, they would then be fate, as he was perfuaded,, the country power would interpofe to pre vent hoftilities.' We came to an anchor in the road about one o'clock in the afternoon^ faluted the fort with eleven guns, and received the fame number in return. Captain Lindefey, Me'flieurs Doidge and Pye went on fliore after dinner. The Grab faluted them on their putting off with nine guns, and at their landing they were received by the fecond in council, and the military officer, who introduced them to Baron Kniphaufen, to whom they delivered Mr. G^'s letter of recommendation. The fame evening Captain Lindefey came oa board, and gave us an account, that the Baron (who had given them the moft genteel and friendly reception) had in his opinion fuggefted an excel* lent plan for Our future proceedings,^having recommended it to Mr. Doidge^ that we fhould land at Grane on the Arabian fhore, and fet out from thence over the Great Defert for Aleppo. That the Baron knew it to be a road fre^- quented by people of trade; that an European^ attended only by a fingle fervant, had fafely travelled over it, and that the journey would not take up more than 25 days.) Captain Lindefey farther added, that fhould we approve, of the fcheme, the Baron would immediately fend a Felucca with a mef- fenger to Grane, who Ihould bring the Sheick of; that place (a man greatly obliged to him, and in fome meafure under his influence) to Karec ', with him he did not doubt, but he fhould be able to concert a plan for- conveying us fafe to Aleppo-,. The next morning, Lieutenant James Alms; Captain Lindefey, Mr. Pigot, and myfelf, went on Jfhore, and were very genteely received by the Baron. We v/ere met by Meflleurs Doidge and Pye, Mynheer Bofman the fecond; Mr. Rohingfon, an enfign in the artillery, but of Englijh ex traction, and who fpoke our language tolerably well; Mynheer Nicoli the company's accomptant ; Mynheer Tilick the furgeon ; and Mynheer Binkey, the mafter attendant. The Baron prefently opened to us his plan for our future journey, and it appearing to be a route as little hazardous, as any we had yet thought of, and more expeditious (though lefs commodious.) than that by Baghdad, we unanimoufly agreed to put ourfelves entirely un der the Baron's dire£lion ; who gave immediate orders for the Felucca''^ going to Grane. 10 bring the Sheick- Qi that, place to Karec. In the evening we took a walk to the fouth end of the ifland, aecompa- nied by Mr. Robingfon ; and pafTed through fome agreeable fields of corn, a few ears of which were then ripe, and fome gardens, where we faw Gole -worts, beans, and peafe in perfedlion. We could not but take notice 3 alfo 175S.[ 208 ] 1758. alfo of a large handfome building which we met with in the way, fuppofed v—' by the common people to be the tomb of Meer Mahomet the fon of Ah a man much renowned for his piety, and who is faid to have performed mira cles among them. The Baron however aiilired us, that this notion of theirs is merely imaginary, for that Meer Mahomet, was fo far from being buried under this tomb, that he never was once in the ifland, either living or dead. His opinion, and which was confirmed by the mod fenfible of the Arab and Perfians, is, that this monument was only ere(5led in remembrance and honour of that fage, and that neither his, nor the bones of any other per- fon were depofited under it. He obferved, it was poffible this tomb might once have been a Portuguefe chapel •, and that after thofe people had deferted the ifland, the Perftans had changed it's form into that it now bears. This opinion is probably well founded, for from the appearance of the ftone-mafonry, and the painted tiles above the door, it was very evident that fome parts at leaft of this building were of modern conftrudion. Juft before we reached this tomb, we entered, and furveyed with great atten tion, a long fubterraneous pafTage, made for the conveyance of water from the oppofite fide of an hill which (according to the Perfian cuftom) has at proper diftances, holes cut through the furface of it, for the admiflion of light and air. We obferved alfo at this fouth end (which is the higheft part of the ifland) fome caverns hewn out of the folid rock, which feem to have been the dwelling-places of the firft inhabitants. There were alfo two or three ftrudures here, which appeared to have been once appropriated to religious ufes, perhaps they were Portuguefe churches; and what ferves to confirm this opinion, is, that a crucifix had been dif- covered cut on one of the walls. The next day we began pitching the four tents which we had furnilh- ed ourfelves with at Calcutta ; but before we had finifhed with the largeft, our dining-tent, the Baron paid us a vifit, and put an entire flop to our proceedings, affuring us, that thofe high and fpacious tents, were by no means calculated tor our purpofe, fince the^ would certainly difcover us a great way oil, and give even thofe Arabs that were about us, too high an opinion ot our conlequence ; they were alfo, he obferved, too heavy and un wieldy, and promifed to provide us with proper ones in their ftead. He had witn him leveral Arabian merchants, who all joined in what the Baron had laid. After he had thus pafled his judgment on our tents, he went on examining the other part ot our baggage, and could not help fmiling at a two-wheel chaiie we had brought with us, in hopes of it's being ufeful in our journey over the Befert. We knew indeed that no fuch thing was uled in common either in 'Turkey or Perfia, yet as we imagined we might be able to get horles either at Bajfora or Baghdad, we had pleafed ourlelves with the thoughts of being fometimes relieved from the Camd's untoward motion by this meansj and in fuch roads as fhould turn out rugged or landy, we had formed a fcheme of taking the chaife to pieces, 1 - . -and—— 1111 ItHSta, [ 209 ] and throwing it on a earners back *. We were not quite clear as to the pradicability of this fcheme, but concluded, that at the worft, we could make a prefent of it to Mr. Shaw at Bajfora, to whom we flattered ourfelves it might be acceptable, having heard that Mr. Dorrel^ his predeceflbr, had made ufe of a two-wheel chaife at that place. The Arabs feemed greatly furprized at the conftru6Hon of this vehicle, and many of them with much pleafantry, placed themfelves in the feat of it. We hoped that the Baron himfelf might be prevailed upon to accept of the chaife, though from the rugged appearance of the whole ifland, there was but little reafon to expedt it -f. From the chaife, the Baron caft an eye on fome other things we had brought, and talked of making a ftill greater alteration, but faid, he would let that alone till after the arrival of the Sheick from Grane. He approved much of our fufils, bayonets, and piftols, as well as of the canvas and lea ther-portmanteaus, which we had procured to be made on board the Grab, in lieu of common wooden trunks. He advifed us to take no finery with us, efpecially no gold or filver lace, but to appear as plain as poffible ; to make our journey in the habit of Turkijh janizaries, for as the Arabs well knew thofe gentlemen not to be rich, we might probably go on in this dif- guife with little interruption. Our camp-tables and ftools, according to the Baron's plan, were to go no farther, and our clafp-cots were to be fent back alfo to Bombay, as being of no kind of ufe in our future journey, fince we muft deep on the ground. Had we been fo fortunate as to have met with fo able a counfellor either at Calcutta or Bombay, it would have faved us at leaft two hundred and fifty pounds fterling: but what was paft could not be recalled, and I have now only to wifli, that our miflakes in this re- Iped; may be of advantage to future travellers. Baron Kniphaufen is a PruJJian by birth, brother to the late Embaf- fador of that name at London, of a middle age, and was formerly in his Frujfian majefty's fervice, but from fome difguft left it, and ferved as a lieu tenant in a regiment of French dragoons. He afterwards went to the Eajl Indies, and was appointed refident to the Dutch company at Bajj'ora, where he unluckily fell into a difpute with the &lt; Turki/h government, the particulars of which are as follow.—The Baron one morning received a mefiage, thac the governor defired to fpeak with him : he haftened to the palace, and according to cuftom fat in the outer room, among fome of the Agas of the court. A fervant having been fent in to acquaint the governor that the Baron was waiting in obedience to his commands, brought for anfwer, * We afterwards forely repented that we had not taken the chaife with us -j- Non eft aptus equis Ithacae locus, ut neque planis Porreftus fpatiis, neque multae prodigus herbse.

Not lon^ after fervant came out, and defired him to walk into an inner apartment • h^k he had no fooner done, but an officer there in waiting abruptly toldh' that he was his prifoner. The Baron was exceedingly furprized and ' ring into the reafon of his being treated in fuch a manner, was anfwZi' that 'u was for being criminal with women, and defrauding the Government of it s cuftoms.'

The Turk readily promifed his beft afliftance, but faid, he feared it would not be lefs than one hundred thoufand rupees. The Baron demurred, and complained heavily of the enormous fum that was fixed, but all his complaints were to no manner of purpofe. At laft, he told the Turk^ he would that evening pay down his all, amounting to fifty thoufand rupees, ftay in Bajfora only the next day, and depart in a Butch fhip the day following; but as by this ftep, his fecond would be fure to fucceed to the refidency, the governor might, if he pleafed, demand a complimentary loan from him of thirty thoufand rupees, and make up the remaining twenty out of the private fortune of the Banian, who was employed in doing the bufinefs of the Dutch factory here, and with whofe conduft in the prefent difpute, the Baron had great reafon to be difpleafed. The hint was relifhed and accepted; the Baron was immediately ufhered into one of the beft rooms of the Seraglio, where the governor and his Agas were fitting, the money was fent for, and paid down, and the prifoner fet at liberty. The Butch fecond, and other Euro pean gentlemen were in company together, when they firft heard of the Baron's enlargement. The fecond immediately waited upon him, and was very inquifitive to know the terms of his deliverance, but received no fatisfaflory aniwer; the Baron only coldly telling him, that he fhould the next day embark for Batavia, where he would account for the whole of his conduft, and there only. Mynheer *********** was now looked upon as chief or refident, and re ceived the ufual compliments on the occafion. He was fent for to court, and befides being congratulated by the governor and all his Agas on his new promotion, he was honoured with a rich Pelife, or filk veft lined with ermine. He went home in the higheft fpirits, and without doubt hugged himfelf in the fuccefs of the day. But how foon did the fcene change ! that very afternoon, a melTenger was difpatched to him from the gover nor, with a demand of thirty thoufand rupees. He was aftonifhed at the unlooked for tidings; he raved, curfed and fwore; refufed to pay the money, and infifted upon being told why it was required of him. The meffenger dryly told him, that it was but a neceffary compliment to the governor, from a man who had fo lately received fuch honours, and who had fo fortunately gotten into poffeflion of a poft of fuch confequence. Upon this, he flew to the Baron, who referred him to others for better advice than he could give him. He afterwards repaired to the Seraglio^ to com plain of his ill ufage, but here too he met with no redrefs: the thirty thoufand rupees were paid down, and fo were the twenty thoufand by the Banian. The day following, the Baron embarked •, but he was no fooner on board, than he received a meflage from the governor, inviting him to come back again, with affurances of his protection, and readinefs to receive from him any complaint he had to make againft any other European gentlemen. E e 2 The[ 2I 3 ] workmen, was not the only difficulty the Baron had at fir ft to ftruggle with ; 1758. for at his coming on the coaft, he had the mortification to hear that his old ' '— J friend the Sheick of Bunderick had been murdered by his fecond fon, and that this unnatural villain having ufurped the fovereignty, threatened de- ftruftion to him and his intended enterprize. No way intimidated however with thele threats, he made, good his landing, and began and perfefted his work. This eftablifhment at Karec, was only a part of the Baron's fcheme. There was fomething befides, which from the beginning he had never once loft fight ot, the reimburfing himfelf, at the expence of the Turkijh government, the 50,000 rupees which had been fo unjuftly taken from him at Bajfora. Por this purpofe, he kept his fhips in conftant readi- nefs to put to fea, and in the months of April and May, when he knew the rich 'Turkijh veffels would be coming from the gulph, he ordered two of his fhips (for he had by this time fitted up a third) to cruize at the entrance of Bajfora river, and not to fuffer any velfels to pafs without examination. Thefe orders the captains of his two cruizers moft pundtually fulfilled, and moreover frequently landed in their boats, and took awajr oxen, fheep, goats, and all other forts of provifion, from the fhore. While the Bar oris two fhips were thus commencing hoftilitie-s in the mouth of Bajfora river,, two Turkijh veflels, very richly laden, touched at Karer for pilots, and to enquire into the caufe of the Butch commanders conduft, as reported to them in their paffage up the gulph. The Baron entertained the Turkijh captains in the moft polite manner, and took care to furnifh them with everything that could contribute either to the refrefh- ment of their (hips crews, or their own amufement. He pretended alfo to find great fault with the hoftilities committed by his two cruizers, and was politic enough to per/uade the Turkijh commanders not to depart from Karec, until the return ot his own captains, when, faid he, you yourfelves fhall be witneffes of their being brought to a proper account for their paft beha viour. He was all this while however very uneafy at his own untoward fituation ; being doubtful whether, in fpite of all his art, thefe two ftlips might not by fome accident or other be alarmed, and make their way back again out of the gulph. He could not but refled: too, that he had no torce with him at prefent capable of preventing it, there being but one fhip left at Karec, poorly manned, and ftill worfe commanded; and the two Turkijh veffels carried at leaf!: two hundred and forty men, with guns in proportion. Add to this, that he was in daily, almoft in momentary cxpeftation of his enemy, the Sheick of Bundarick, fending over his Tran- filled with foldiers, to. the affiftance of the Turks. In this dilemma, he wifhed only for an opportunity of calling in his cruizers, but at the fame- time defpaired of finding any. Luckily for him, at this very critical conjuncture, the mafter of a Trankey, bound to Bajfora, applied to him for a pafs ; the Turkijh captains feconded the requeft, the pafs was granted, and an order was fent with it to the commanding officer for the immediate A return[ 2i 4 ] . return of the cruizers. In two or three days they appeared, to the nofmall joy of the Bar en. And now, the Turks, who before were prevented from failing by what they thought prudential reafons, were to their inexprefllble furprize, compelled to ftay by force. x The hoftiiities committed by the two cruizers at the mouth of the river, had given the government at Bajfora the mof: fenfible alarm but how greatly was it increafed, when the news arri?ed of the Baron's having detained the two rich fliips, which they had been anxioufly expecting from Sural! They immediately wrote to him, offering to pay back the 100,000 rupees, and in ail other refpetfts to come to an amicable accommodation. The terms were readily accepted of, the was paid, and the reimburled M\uteer an money government of Btrlra, and the Baron 'who oenerouflv - and the Banian their (hare), havelronunued on a friendly footing ever fince. Having circumftamially given the particulars of the Barents hiftory rela- tive to his firll fettling at Karec, 1 fhall fubjoin a defcription of the ftate of ihat little iQand, at the time of our arrival. The fort is a fquare, built of itone, with four ballions, each of which hath eight guns mounted upon it •, fix of thefe were in the two faces, and the others were fo contrived as to flank the two curtains. Before the gate, facing the fea, was a battery or ravelin, with twelve guns mounted, from fix to eighteen pounders. There were alio thirty or forty more of various fizes lying upon the ground, for want of carriages. This irregularity in the weight of cannon, was owing to the Baron's being obliged to get them as he could from different Ihips, and at feveral times. An efplanade alio extended itfelf about 200 yards, be yond which, they had juft finifhed fome houfes for Europeans to dwell in, and a wall, which joined to thole houfes. This wall, it was deCgned, Ihould hereafter be continued from fea to fea, as a fecurity to the fort and the inhabitants within. It ran nearly north-weft and fouth-eaft. —The fort was garrisoned with an hundred European foldiers. There was alfo a trian gular baition at the north-weft end of the iGand, mounted with fix guns; two of thcle pointed towards the lea, two to the lhare, and the other two were to nanK the intended curtain-wall ot the town. About mid-way between this north weft point and the forr, there was a fmall pier -head of ftone- work, deligned to protect a little haven, whither all the Trankns, GaUkats, and : :.kcias run, when the louth wind blows hard, and where they lay in perrec: fecurity. In this haven we faw two or three armed GaUhais, with Hx or eight carnage guns, which is luperior to any force the Turks or their neighoours have in theic leas. L pon the whole, the Barcn had made a iUrpnzing progreis :or tr .e little time he had been upon the ifland, and it t -■ ) appeared to us, tnat he intended to make it a very ftrong and wealthy place. In the miuu.e cr this ifland, are very high hills, which abound with a variety or ihell?. Some iragrr .ents torn from their fides, gave us an op portuait) ci discovering feveral yards under the furface, an allonifhing quanriryf 2l 5 3 quantity of oyfter fcallop, cockle, lamprey, barnide, and other (hells. The. common tree here, is the Banian ; but none of the limbs yield thofe 'i, luxuriant fhoots which go downwards, and fix themfelves in the ground, as at Gombroon, and Fort St. David. —The lavender-cotton fhrub is found here in great plenty Here are alfo partridges, wild pidgeons, wood-peckers, many kinds of fmall birds, befides gulls, &amp;V. near the fea» Pearl oyfters have been found near this idand, but as they lie in confider- able depths, not lefs than or 14 fathom water, the divers (who were not very expert at the bufinefs) had not met with much fuccefs, at the time we were there. Some pearls of confiderable value however had been found, particularly one, very handfome and large, which the Baron was fo polite as to prefent to Mr. hoidge. It had a Lufus Nature upon it, llrongly re- fembling the face of a human fcetus in the early months of pregnancy. The Baron was very inquifitive about the diving-bell, and fome other late difcoveries made in England, for enabling men to keep a long while under water; and defired Mr. Doidge to think of him on this article. He gave me alfo a commiffion to buy, and fend him out from England the following books and inftruments, viz. Diflionnaire de Bayle 1 Moreri j Derniere edition.

The above catalogue is exactly copied from the Baron's original com- miffion, and inferted as a fpccimen of that gentleman's ingenuity and turn of mind. He was pleafed afterwards to add to the catalogue feveral me chanical inftruments ; as Captain Toveys new inftrument for levelling can non, &amp;c. and any other invention for the bomb. Any new-invented optical inftruments, being improvements on. the telefcope, microfcope, or common eye-glafs. And fuch other inftruments as tended to illuftrate any art or fcience, or could be of fervice to him in his new fettlement. Thefe feveral articles were to be fent to him by one of our India (hips, or by fome veflel bound to Scdnderoon i and from thence to be fent to Aleppo, configned to the care of the Englijh or Dutch conful at that place.) On my arrival in London, this commiflion of the worthy Baron, was pundually exe cuted, and difcharged out of a fum of money, which he had advanced to Mr. Doidge. , ^ ^ Not far from Grane is an ifland called Bareen or Baharen, where at certain known depths, divers go down to the bottom of the fea, and come up again with their veflels filled with frefh water. The faft is indifputable : 1 had it from the Baron, tewzvdX Arabian merchants who lived near the ifland confirmed the truth of it. The frelh water is found in holes or little natu ral wells, fome fathoms below the furface of the fea. The Arabs have certain marks on the ifland, to teach them where to dive for the frefli water holes. One of the merchants afiured us, that he himfelf difcovered a fpring upon the fhore, ferving one of thefe wells; that he put a bit of a heavy flick into it, and in two or three days afterwards, a diver brought it to him from the bottom of one of the holes. It is worthy of remark alio, that thr6ugh all the Perftan gulph, the fpring water of the iflands is much better than that which is found upon the continent 5 and the water neareft the fea in the iflands, has greatly the advantage over that which is found in the middle parts. This obfervation of the inferiority of the water upon the continent, holds good however, only refpeding that part ot it which is near the fea; for about 12 miles up the country, both on the P erfian and Arabian fide of the gulph, the water is very good. • To[ 2I 7 ] In the diftria of Bedejht near Bebaim, in the province of Pegfoai (or l 75%* Cokelaun) in Perjia, is a black Bitumen^ extrafted from a rock, which is looked upon as a fpecific in reuniting fraftured bones. The Baron o-ave me two little canifters of it; and the direftions I received for ufing u, were, ' Take half a drachm of the Bitumen, and melt it over the fire/mixed with an ounce of oil: when thefe are well incorporated, rub the'broken part with them quite warm, and in all other refpeds treat the fraflure ac cording to the common rules of furgery. The patient is alfo to take a pill of it inwardly three or four times a day.' Mr. Alves, an Englijh furgeon, had made ufe of it in a cafe where both thighs were fraftured, and affured the Baron that no fever came on during the whole time of the cure. Another perfon affured the Baron, that having once applied it to the broken leg of a fowl, it was able to walk in twenty-four hours. The rock yielding this Bitumen had formerly a guard placed over it, and a very confiderable profit arofe therefrom to the- governor of the province; but fince the kingdom of Ferfia has been rent in pieces by civil wars, it is fuppofed that thTs guard has been withdrawn, for feveral poor Per/tans, who fled for protedion to Karec, brought a little of this pitch along with them, and offered it in fale to the Baron. That which he gave me, was a prefent to him from the go vernor of the province *. We were greatly difappointed at the long abfence of the Felucca, which the Baron had fent to Grane, to bring the Sheick who was to condud us over the great Defert to Aleppo •, however, on the whole our time paffed away not unpleafantly. The mornings were generally fpent in making little excur- fions to different parts of the ifland, and our evenings in fupping with the Baron at the fort. Here we met with a very agreeable and fenfible gentle man, who amidft a variety of other topics, gave us the following account of the Arabs and Perfians. ' The Arabs ftill continue divided into 'Tribes-, and out of as many of thefe as pofllble, it will be advifable for you to fele6t the men who are to efcort you over the Defert ; for fhould you happen to fall in with a body of any of thole particular tribes, to which the Arabs who accompany you belong, you may depend upon pafllng unhurt and unmolefted; or if you meet with any of their fcouting parties, and can prevail only on one of them to enter your tents, drink of your coffee, eat rice, or any thing befides, you will then be fafe from any infult either by them or their brethren; it being an invariable maxim with them, ' never to moleft thofe jlrangers they have once eaten and drank with' looking upon it then as a breach of hofpitality, and confequently as a moll enormous crime. Should any of their out-lying detachments accidentally fall in with you, and inftead of * Sir John Char din in the fecond volume of his travels has given an cxaft and ample ac count of this medicine. F f entering2i8 ] 17^8 entering your tentSj snd partaking of your entertain men hurry back to /J ' j their main body to communicate the pleafing intelligence; even in this cafe, if one of your party can make greater hafte than they, and join the Arab- body firft, throw himfelf at the Sheick's feet, and demand protedion, you may relt a flu red of your lives and property : for another ftable maxim with them is, that lt whofoever Jhallfy to the powerful, and humbly implore ajftfiance, has a right to receive it' 1 his point they carry lo far, that were the murderer of the SheicVs father,^ Ion, or brother, to be the perfon ib pe. titioning, he would not be refufed. And what is flill more extraordinary, this aft of mercy is fure to take place, although the fupplicant may not be able to get quite up to the perfon of the Sheick. If he is only fo near him, as to be capable of throwing a ftick to, or beyond the fpot of ground where he happens to be, this circumftance fecures him from all danger. But though the Arabs are thus fcrupulous in regard to the right's of hof- pitality, yet in other inllances they will be found to equivocate as well as their neighbours. The moft effeftual way to bind them is by a particular oath of theirs, called the Tallauck-, the penalty of a non-pcr- formance of which is, that the perjured perfon fhall part with all his wives, and never cohabit with them again, until they have been proftituted to other men. The infamy and inconvenience arifing from hence, is efteemed fo very great, that you feldom, if ever, hear of this facred obligation being broken. The wife, that has the greateft power in a family, is fhe, who by the confent of the parents of both parties, was firfl: married to the young man •, fhe is early taught the art of cookery, and takes the lead of all the other wives in that refpeft •, fhe has alfo the chief management of his do- meftic affairs •, nor can he ever part with her, but with the utmoft difficulty and inconvenience.' The money ufed by the Arabs, are the Perjian and Indian Rupees, In one town in Arabia Felix, the government coins a piece of filver fomewhat of the fhape of an horfelhoe •, fifteen of thefe amount to a Rupee. The Indian Rupee is worth forty-fix Marmoodas, the Perjian is valued only at forty- five. The charafter which this gentleman gave us of the Perfians alfo was by no means likely to prejudice us in their favour. He reprefented them as ' a deceitful, treacherous people ; faithlefs in their dealings, and fo addidled to all the little arts of guile and falfehood, that a man muft be credulous to a great degree, to believe them even upon their oaths. Should one of that na tion fwear (according to the Perjian mode) that he will perform a certain aft, on the penalty, we will fuppofe, of his fon Hojfein being difhonoured by his wife; upon being detefted of failing in his engagement, and re proached with the difhonour which is done to his family by his perjury, he[ 2'9 ] he will only laugh and fay, that he took that oath at the expence of another 1758,. Hoffein, not of his fon, nor of any One of that name, for whom he had the v—- leaft affedion. A Perjian is not limited in the number of his wives : he may marry them for a certain time, and at the expiration of that period put them away if he pleafes, taking care however to perform his marriage con- trad, which always fecures to the woman a return of whatever money or goods fhe brought with her, in cafe of a divorce.' In Gomhroon if a woman fhall be difcovered to have committed adultery, ■ the hufband of that woman is obliged to pay a fine to the governor, if able i if not, the wife is taken from him by the officers of jullice, and lent to a common ftew, there to remain, 'till fhe has by a repetition of the fame crime, earned as much money, as will difcharge the fine : after this Ihe is returned to her hufband again, who may keep her or not, as he thinks proper. If he chufes to part with her, he muft exa&lt;5Uy fulfil the mar riage contract by returning the fortune he received with her. In a vifit we made to another gentleman of this ifland, who had the bell opportunities of getting at the true charader of the late famous Thamas Kuli Khan, he affured us, ' that all the hiftories yet written of him, were very erroneous. He was not naturally cruel •, his ambition indeed led him to empire, but he would have been glad to have governed mildly. That though the two lall: years of his life were attended with continual revolts among his fubjefls, at the head of whom were his own children, yet he feldom put any of them to death ; the punifhment he generally inflided was that of putting out their eyes. Kuly Khan being once afked, why he chofe this method of treating his rebellious fubjefts, rather than taking away their lives, replied, Becaufe I would have them live on-, eyelefs, as lajling monuments of their own villainy^ and of my jujiice. This gentleman alfo affured us, that Kuli Khan had once flattered himfelf with a vaft increafe of empire by a marriage with the Czarina of Mufcovy, and that he aftually fent an Emhaffador to Peterfburgh for that purpofe ; though the Czarina fecretly defpifed the offer he made to her, looking back with fcorn on his mean original, yet fhe took care to demean herfelf with much feeming refped upon the occafion, and exprefled herfelf highly honour ed with the Shah's propofal, but at the fame time advanced many reafons why flie could not pofiibly comply with it. Among others, fhe did not forget to mention the difference of their religion. Soon after the return of his cmbaffador, the Perfian monarch converfed often with the fathers of the three convents at Ifpahan \ feemed very defirous of being inftruded in the fundamentals of their religion, liftened to them with great attention, and threw out hints of his becoming a Chrifiian. He ordered alfo thefe fathers to fet about a tranflation of the New Teftament into xht Perfian language for his own immediate ufe, which they had very near finilhed, when his life F f 2 was[ 220 ] was put an end to by four of his own generals, who have been fighting for — i the crown or throne of Perfia ever fince. The firft competitor, Nauzir Khan, hath already been noticed as refidinw near to Gombroon. —The fecond, Kerim Khan, is in poffefllon of Ifpahan, and has an army of thirty thoufand men under his command.—The third is Hajfein Khan, who pofleflTes the northern parts of the kingdom, and at the time we were at Gombroon, was faid to be inarching from the provinces near the Cafpan fea with a great body of forces towards Ifpahan •, and that he carried with him a prince of the female line of the great Shah Abbas, in whofe name he founded his pretenfions.—The fourth is Achmet or Hamet Shah, governor of the Afghan or Pytan country his views were faid to be confined to the keeping pofleflion of that province only, which borders on the territories of the Great Mogul. During our ftay at Karec, we re ceived advice, that Hajfein Khan had obtained a fuperiority over all his rivals; that his troops were more numerous, and better difciplined than theirs; and that his carrying with him a prince of the royal blood had confiderably in- creafed the number of his partifans, and given him at leaft a fhew of better pretenfions to the crown. Hamet Khan or Shah, the chief of the Afghans, according to thefe ad vices, had juft before gained a confiderable, tho' not a decifive victory over Kerim Khan. We were now alfo given to underftand, that Nauzir Khan, b the neighbourhood of Gombroon was become of fo little confequence, as not to be thought worthy of being ranked among the competitors for the crown of Perfia. So that at this time the four claimants were reduced to- three. To the fame gentleman who furnifhed us with the account of the nations bordering on the Perfian gulph, we were alfo obliged for the rollowing anecdotes relative to a late maffacre in Batavia, the chief a:tors ot which furpaffed either Arabs or Perfians, in diffimuladon and- cruelty. . •^■ s kinds of grain were fcarce at Ceylon, and as all the fettlements in India were chiefly fupplied with wheat and rice from Bengal' the Malabar coaft, it was propofed in the Butch council at Batavia, that a confi- derable number ot Chinefe fhould be forcibly taken from the ifland of Java, and tranfported to Ceylon, in order to cultivate the lands, which thereby would be fure to produce great quantities of grain. This motion met with violent oppofition, and was almoft unanimoufly rejefted ; feveral alledging t ut it was tne height of cruelty and injuftice to force the Chinefe, who were a free people, into llavery ; and fome threw out hints that there ought to be methods taken to make their affairs better rather than worfe. Elated with what palled in the council, the Chinefe took great liberties, fpake freely of their real or : ' :\ [ 221 3 or pretended hardfhips, and at laft went fo far as to infult, and commit 1758,' feveral robberies. A council was prefently fnmmoned ro remedy thefe evils; when, after much debate, it was at laft refolved, v that all the va grant Chinefe fhonld be feized and fent to Ceylon •, but the officer, who put this order in execution, made a fatal miftake, for inftead of con fining himfelf to vagrants, he imprifoned feveral of the principal planters and merchants. During their confinement, many of their fervants com mitted great thefts, and did them confiderable damage in plundering their eftates. 0 No fooner however were they fet at liberty, but the fervants, appre- henfive of their mafters difpleafure, ran into the mountains, where they committed great diforders among the native iflanders, who came to a pitched battle with them, and beat them back to the Dutch territories. Upon their return, the ring-leaders were punifhed, and affairs were once more put upon a tolerable good footing. The Dutch council then thought it necef- fary to make a new law, by which all the Chinefe were forbidden to have a light in their houfes after eight o'clock in the evening. This was a moft fenfible mortification to people, who had ever been accuftomed to fpend their evenings in the greateft feltivity j and in fpite of this reftraint, they came to a refolution of continuing their meetings, and of increafing their mutual intercourfe with one another. For this pur- pofe, they broke down their partition-walls, threw feveral houfes into one, and kept up their fpirits. as well as men could do who were without light. The Dutch were greatly alarmed at this behaviour of the Chinefe they afTembled in council, and orders were prefently ilfued for all the feamen belonging to the (hips in the port, to come alhore, to be Rationed in the marine yard, where they were locked up every even ing, in order to keep the Chinefe - in awe, and to a6t as occafion might require. One night, either through carelefsnefs or defign, the gate of the marine yard was left open ; the favors foon difcovered it, and, enraged with being kept fo long confined, they broke loofe like fo many wild beafts, and roamed all over the city, maifacring every man, woman, and child, they met with, to the number of forty thoufand^. The news of this dreadful fcene was foon brought to the general ; but aks! no remedy was to be found ! Prefently after, an officer was diipatched to him in all hafte from the prifon (in which were kept fifteen hundred Chincfe, defigned to be tranfported to Ceylon) acquainting him, that the pri- foners wese in an uproar, that without immediate affiftance he fhould not be able to keep them under» but they would break out and put to death all that came in their way, and that little or no refiftance could be made to fo large a body of men, confidering how the Dutch feamen and foldiers were difperfed through the feveral quarters of the town. In anfwer to this, the general is laid to have replied, ' If that he really the cafe y the ^ prisoners[ 222 ] i—8. prifoners ought to he cut off:' This was a fufficient hint to the officer —' who took care to lee the bloody ad perpetrated without delay. Nothing more than giving the above anfwer,. could ever be proved againft the oe- neral, though he afterwards was accufed of being the principal adlor in tnis horrid butchery, and was accordingly removed from his government, and imprifoned, till death fct him free. On Friday the 14th of April, to our great fatisfadion, the Felucca returned r from Grane, and brought the long-expe&lt;5led Arab. He behaved very com- plaifantly, aflliring us of his beft afliftance, and how ready he was to accom pany us to Aleppo. He thought it his duty however, he faid, to acquaint v us, that if we undertook our journey at this time, we fhould run great rifle of being infulted by the tribe of a powerful neighbouring Sheick* t who having a quarrel among themfelves, were under no fort of regulation ; that two peribns had been lately attacked by them, one of whom, well known by the Baron, was mortally wounded. .He added, that this day was the feventh of the Moon, and by letters received from different places it appeared, that the great Caravan for Aleppo would be near Gram on the twentieth., when the camels from this laft place were to join it; that if we chofe to travel in company with them, we might do it with much more fafety and convenience, than in a fmaller party •, that the would be only thirty days in going from Grane to Aleppo, and would confift of five thoufand camels and a thoufand men. The whole of this intelligence was of too pleafing a nature to admit of our continuing long in fufpence-, we unanimoufly agreed to join the Caravan. The Sheick feemed delighted with our determination, and advifed us to leave Karec on the fifteenth, that we might get to Grane in proper time; afiuring us, that he himfelf would return back to Grane in a day or two, to get the camels, &amp;c. ready for our .ufe. The Baron, after confulting with the Arab, determined that our baggage : fhould confift of the following articles. One Bengal tent, two Arabian tents, Arabian bafkets, which, one with another, holds about 24 quart bottles. They were to contain 72 bottles of Madeira wine, 58 of claret, 54 of Man^ ;ihrub, 15 ot Arrack, 15 of cyder, 240 pounds of bifcuit or rulk, 6 hams, 30 neats tongues, 27 pieces of fhip beef, 1 chefhire cheefe, 32 pounds of butter, 2 Imall jars of pickled Sardinias, 3 quart bottles of oil, 5 of vinegar, 2 bottles ot muftard, 2 bottles of powdered pepper, 20 pounds of powdered fugar, 8 pounds of powdered fugar-candy, 12 quart bottles .of common fyrup clarified with whites of eggs, 28 pounds of onions, n The Sheick alluded to lives nearGr^«^ and is the mo ft powerful of all that live in the r l aVln ^ thirt y ^oufand men under his command; he receives fifty thoufand crownt ; , out ot the one hundred thoufand, which are yearly fent to the Arabs from \he Grand Seignior, 1 or permitting the Pitgrim-Caravans to pafs unmoleited. 12C 223 I 12 pounds of ginger-bread nuts, 30 pounds of Gombroon dried prunes, two Cattees of tea, two of powdered coffee, one canvas portmanteau, to hold our linnen and clothes, and a larger one for our bedding. ,As our whole party confided of eight perfons, it was agreed that each of us (fer- vants excepted) fhould take with him 30 fuits of linnen, one European fuic of clothes, four or five pair of thin fhoes, a plain hat, an Arabian Camaline, troufers, Turban and flippers, and a Turkijh Janizary's drefs. The above inventory of our baggage being fixed, and the Baron having acquainted the Arab, that he intended to accommodate us with two of his own horfes in our journey', the latter declared, that 30 camels would ftill be wanting to carry us, our fervants, and baggage. The Baron infifted, that a lefs num ber would be fufficient, and brought him down to twenty. It was then agreed between them, it would be neceffary for us to take from Grane an Arab of credit, whofe bufmefs would be to fettle all points with the com mander of the Caravan, to prevent infults, thefts, &amp;c. &amp;c. The Baron took me afide, and told me, by what he could learn, the price of a camel at and about Grane, was about thirty-five PiaJires, but he feared that we as travellers would be obliged to pay for the fervice only, more than the camel's original coft; but by a calculation he had made, he thought he Ihould be able to agree with the Sheick, to provide us with camels, and all other neceflaries, for about a thoufand or eleven hundred Piaftres*. I took upon me to anfwer for my brother travellers, that we fhould not have the leaft objedion to this fum, and defired the Baron to fettle matters with the Arab upon this footing. The affair, agreeable to the Arabian cuftom, was negotiated between them by the mediation of a third perfon; the Baron and the Sheick having no immediate intercourfe with each other. A great deal of pompous folem- nity fat on the face of the Arab, who treated this bufinefs as a matter of the utmoft confequence, and by figns upon his fingers, made a demand of two thoufand Piaftres. The Baron in return offered one thoufand, and the affair was thus debated by figns from the parties, and ferious whifperings from the mediator, for full half an hour; when they parted rather abruptly, the Baron being greatly difpleafed with the intended impofition of the Arab. He told us in the evening, that this exorbitant demand mufl; proceed from a report that we were exceedingly rich ; that he was fure- the crafty Arab had caft a wifhful eye upon our purfes, and that nothing but this, and the hopes he ftill entertained of our being obliged to clofe with him, prevented his acceptance of the offer, for the whole money would be clear gain to him; as we were immediately to depofit the cafh, and the camels which he was to buy with it, would fell at Aleppo for more than their prime coff. The Sheick, * Eight hundred piajlrts make one thoufand rufees, or one hundred and twenty-five pounds fleriing. afterf 2 25 ] r' abortive, I am very fnre he would be greatly pleafed if you fpared his delicacy fo far as to make the propofal yourfelves of goins by fome « other route.'* Mr. Robingfon ingenuoufly added, ' that every other gen tleman upon the ifland was clearly of opinion, that we ought to go bv water to Bajfora, and he had reafon to think the Baron was not to be ex cepted out of this number, however fcrupulous he might be of delivering his fentiments.' He defired however that the hints which he had cyiven might be kept a fecret from the Baron. Immediately, a fhort confultation was held between us on our prefent fituation; and the fame evening with the general confent of the whole party, I opened to the Baron, that 44 as fo exorbitant a fum had been demanded by the Arab, as the time of our con tinuance at Grane, before the arrival of the Caravan, would alfo be very uncertain, as well as difagreeable, and as from what had pafled, it was very probable we might ftill be fubjedled to farther impofition; I therefore fubmitted to him, whether he did not think our failing to Bajfora, the moft eligible route.' The Baron feemed greatly pleafed with the propofal, and adopted it without any hefication. He was fo obliging as ftill to infift on our acceptance of the two horfes, he had intended for our ufe, and pro- pofed fending them with our baggage, and one of our fervants, in a Trankey to BaJfora \ we were to follow in one of his armed Gallivats, This night 's Converfation ended, in our making him moft hearty acknowledgment? for the whole of his friendly and polite behaviour towards us; and in his giving the ftrongeft aflurances of the earneft defire he had of contributing to our eafe and fatisfadion. 5 The next morning a boat arrived from Bajfora, with a letter from Mr. Shaw, addreffed to Mr. Doidge : the following is an extraft. ' I flattered 44 myfelf that I fhould have had the fatisfadion of your company, for a few days at leaft at Bajfora ; but from the doubtful manner in which you 44 wrote laft, I know not whether I may now exped that plealure. I pre- 44 fume your intentions may be to proceed over the Defert by the way of 44 Crane which doubtlefs will be more expeditious, though in my humble 44 opinion not fo fecure, as by the way of Baghdad. BeHdes, a Caravan is « to fet out from this laft place in thirty-five or forty days, diredly over the 44 Defert for Aleppo. It is certain alfo, that the Defert is not fafe at prefent without a Caravan or fome proper efcort, for yefterday I had advices from Baghdad, that an Englijh gentleman, one Barton, coming poft from Aleppo 44 to this place with a few camels, was plundered fome days ago by the 44 roving Arabs, who have of late in particular, greatly infefted the Defert j and you mull have heard at Bombay, that one Captain Ivers, goino- hence to Aleppo, in September laft, was in like manner plundered. I he tenor of this letter confirmed us ftill more in the refolution we had taken of proceeding by the way of Bajfora. So that on Wednefday the i^th, we embarked our oaggage, and the two horfes the Baron had given g s 0 u5,[ 226 ] 75S, v% and Tent with them in the Trmikey, Benjamin Jenkins^ whoalfo carried att anlwer from his mailer to Mr. Shaw's letter. The next day about three in the afternoon, we all went on board the Gallivat, commanded by Mynheer Binkey, bound to Baffora. We were ac companied down to the water fide by the * Baron himfelf, Mynheers Bof- man, Rohingfon, Tillie, and Nicholi, who did not quit the fhore, till our veflel was at a confiderable diftance from the ifland. The wind was nearly north-weft when we firft put to lea,, but in the evening it came to the fouth- ward, and carried us along very pleafantly at the rate of about five or fix miles an hour: But in the morning of the 21ft it began, to blow hard and in the evening the gale increafed fo much, that we were forced out of the proper channel for Bajfora river. This obliged us to come to an anchor- we dropt two from the bow, yet the vefiel drove ; we then let ^o a third from the (larboard quarter, which brought her up, and we rode fafely till the next morning, when, to our great fatisfadion, the wind abated, the Gallmt having frequently in the night ftruck the ground. About fix we weighed our anchors, and with a gale (till from thefouth, flood into the mid-channel cf the river, having on our left, the ifland, on which are the ruins of old Bajfora. Thefe ruins extend eight or ten miles. An almoft innumerable quantity of black, withered flumps of date trees, flill remain, and reach for fome miles to the fouthward and northward of the ruined city. We pafTed this day very agreeably; for on both fides of the river quite up to. BaJJhra, are date and apricot trees, regularly planted, and the foil yields one continued verdure, a fight as uncommon in this part of the world, as it is beautitul. Lrom the fhrouds of our little veflfel however, at a few miles dillance beyond this delightful fcene, we could plainly difcover a fpe- cimen of what we were to expe&lt;5l in our journey, over the dreary Defert. of Arabia. \ In our pafTage up the river, we faw feveral people eroding it in bafket- boats i others on large bladders or fkins filled with air. The bafket-boats- are of a circular form, generally from eight to fixteen feet in diameter. 1 heir depth is about three feet, the bottoms flat, which, as well as their outfides, are covered with a kind of pitch. They are very convenieaf, will carry a great number ot paflengers, and are as eafily pulhed through the mud when there is no depth ot water, as over it when there is. The Bj 1 rc ' ; Kniphau/en, fince our leaving Karec, has quitted the Dutch fervice, and I am told 1 31 t . f 'r'* 1 ttundarick is again in polfeffion of the ifland. Our fettlement at Gmhmn was en fiom us by the French in the year 1759, and our affairs have not been profperous ce that event, if at all reinftated in that part of the world. Is not then the ifle of Karec, as we upon the account of it's fituation for trade, as for it's pearl-fifliery, an objeft worthy k t ^ r i r* Awrf com.pany's confideration ? it is about five miles in length, and two in readth, lies nearly in nud-channel between the Perftan and Aralian Ihores, about feve# , om eac ^' about 30 leagues from the mouth of Bajlhra river, whexe all Ihips bound to that place muit calUor pilots. largedmm ''I*!

JL xht Euphrates, \n Afiatic 'Turky: it is large, and populous, about Bassora 0 12 miles in circumference, and contains between fixty and feventy thoufand Saturday, inhabitants. The houfes are all built of mud, and bricks- dried in the fun, A?ril22 ' as is the wall of the city, which is defended by turrets at proper diftances from each other. It was befieged by Thamas Kuli Khan, but without fuc- -cefs. The ftreets in general are very narrow, and ftink abominably, owing to their taking no care to carry off the dirt and filth, tho' a creek very con- venient for that purpofe runs by the fide of the city. (Much trade is carried on here, through a navigable canal which is cut into the river; there is.a daily interco.urfe with Baghdad by water, on the two great rivers A Euphrates 4, and;[ 2 33 ] He accordingly began this fecond hazardous expedition with only two or three camels, and the fame country-fervam, leaving his fon behind at , with orders to follow him, by the firft convenient opportunity. For a tew days, he and his man went on uninterrupted over the Defert. At length five or fix hundred Arabs difcovered them ; but upon their comino- nigh Mr Barton drew out a brace of piftols which he carried in his belt, a^nd prefented them at the Arabs: aftomflied at his* raftnefs, they made a ftand, but at the lame time ordered him to throw down his arms. His fervant alfo per- fuaded him to comply, but all in vain ; he ftill held his cocked piftols to- 'wards the Afahs^ and with a determined look, and high-toned voice, de clared he would kill fome of them, if they dared to approach any nearer. By degiees they furrounded him, and with a blow on the head he was brought to the ground, and nis piftols taken from him i the Arabs now in their turn prefented thefe weapons to his breaft, and told him that he deferved to be put to death ; but they fatisfied themfelves with ftrippin^ him quite naked, and leaving the fervant a jacket and breeches, but nol a drop of water, or morfel ot provifion for either. Mr. Barton, after the enemy rode off, accepted the breeches which his fervant offered to him, and they both fet out bare-footed (their camels alfo ■ having been taken from them) in the track for Baghdad. After having paffed two days and nights without meeting with any other fupport than the Truffles oi the Befert, that happened then to be in feafon, and which thev found in great plenty, they fortunately fell in with another tribe of Arabs, to whole Sheick they told their melancholy tale, and implored his afllftance. The Sheick was touched with the relation of their diftrefs, and afforded them every help in his power; his own wives miniftred unto them, anointed their feet, brought them milk, and every other neceffary. As foon as they were fufficiently recovered to fet forward, the fon of the Sheick efcorted them fo far, as to put them under the protection of another Sheick, by whom they were entertained in the like hofpitable manner, and difmiffed with other guards and paffports ; nor did they want friends as long as their journey lafted, each tribe feeing them fafely lodged with it's next neio-fi- bour, until they had delivered them into the hands of our countrymen at Baghdad. From that city, Mr. Barton was carried in the Pajha's galley down the Tygris to Coma, and from thence to Bajfora, where we met with him. He was at that time clothed like a poor Turk, without fhirt or ftockings ; his beard was grown to an uncommon length ; and he declared that he would indulge himielf in few of the comforts, much lefs in the elegancies of lue, till he arrived fafely at Calcutta, the place of his deftination. (This morning we were complimented with a vifit from Monfieur Perdria A P riI the French refident, Monfieur Rivage the captain of the Brifiol Frigate, and two of his officers. Mr. Shaw invited them to dine with us^' and in the h eveningMonday, April 24. r ^34 ] evening we returned the compliment, and Tupped with them at the countrv houfe of Monf. Perdria, where we were politely and elegantly entertained Monf. Rivage and his officers were prefent, fo that we made up 26 in alf the greateft number of European gentlemen that were known to have been in Bajfora at one time. This was Mr. Shaw's levee day; his room was full of Turkijh, Arabian and Armenian merchants.' Moft of them were large-fized men, fine eyed 1 well^ proportioned, and of good complexions. Their principal defion in coming at this time, was to pay their compliments to us. Here alfo we had an opportunity of converfing with feveral Padrees or miffionaries, who are fettled in a convent at BaJJora, with a view to propagate the Chriftian faith. A very odd fcheme! fince they dare not attempt the converfion even of a fingle MuJJulman. Thefe good men paid us feveral vifits afterwards, gave us many benedidions, and a letter of recommendation to the Roman nominal Bijhop of Babylon. After dinner Mr. Shaw carried us to fee a long-boat of his, which he had fitted up as a little yacht, and was fo obliging as to offer us the ufe of it to carry us as far as Hilla, in our way to Baghdad. We gladly accepted it, as being much more commodious than any of the country boats; and Mr. Alms undertook to fit her for the voyage. We likewlfe hired a Sandal or boat for carrying our baggage and the two horfes we brought with aJ ^ t0 which ^ now aclded a third, as a prefem to Mr. Dotdge. Mr. Shaw alfo laid in a very large ftock of frefh provifions tor our paflage up the river, and was fo generous as to infift, it fhould not be carried to account. To the fame gentleman we were alfo obliged for the following direaions, which we thought proper to make minutes of, as neceflary for our future eoncluCt.--' ift. If, when we arrive at Aleppo, we fhall want more money t an we have credit for from India, Mr. Shaw gives us a letter of credit on his correfpondent at that place: If we fhall have occafion for lefs than two hundred pounds then our bills are to be drawn in favour of hulhvan hiq-, in England\ but if more than that fum, then on SamuelHouvh hfq; at Bombay, in favour of Mr. Shaw or order, 2d. To take with us an in enor Turkijh officer, called a Chocarda, who is to protect us from all t' and to carry with him orders to the feveral governors of thofe places we touch at, to fupply us with a fufficient number of men to track, or draw up our veflels again ft the ftream, when the wind and current fhall be un- iavouiable for failing. We are only to hire fix men at BafTora to track us up as far as ; there we are to engage twelve,, and Vo on, till we arn\e at / a. Eveiy time we change our men, we are to give them from lix to eight Ahajfees, according to their behaviour. To,the Chocarda, at the .

This will probably induce him to fend us an invitation to come afhore, which we are by no means to refufe but to wait upon him either at dinner or fupper, as he fhall appoint. We muft particularly remember to go in flippers, and be very careful not to thruft our legs and feet out, but contrive (after the Turkifo manner) to fit with them acrofs. Should he prefent any one of us with a vefl, we are then to give the fervant who fliali put it on, fixty Crufe, making at the fame time a proper apology for his trouble, but to take care not to give the money till the moment or our departure. If no veft be prefented, then we are to diftribute ten or twelve Crufe among the crovernor's ^ other letter mult be addrefied to Choudar Aga, governor of Hula, whom we are to lalute with three guns, and then fend the letter by our Chocarda and linguift with our compliments, as before to Aly Aga. Here we are to be furnilhed with horfes, camels, mules, and afles to carry us and our baggage to Baghdad, paying for each horfe ten Crufe, for each camel five, and for each mule or afs two and an half. Should the governor make us a compliment of paying for^ thefe animals himfelf, we are then to make a pielent of half, or lomething more than half of their value, to his fervant. ——4th. We are alfo to cany a letter addrefled to Mr. Garden at Baghdad, which we are to difpatch to that gentleman from Hilla', taking care that our ftay at this laft place be as ihort as poflible, left the fhew of our baggage might tempt the Arabs to endeavour to intercept us.—-—5th. Should we^be fo unfortunate as not to meet with Mr. Garden at Baghdad, we are then to apply to Cojee Raphael, an Armenian, who does Mr. Shaw's bufinefs there, and he will take care to provide us with camels, &amp;c. and will bargain for their hire to Aleppo which ufually is from fifteen to twenty Piaftres Rums of eight, five Marmoodas Baghdad currency; or 4 of a loaded camel. The hire of a camel to ride on, is little more than half the price of a loaded one. our fervants have a cuftomary right to mount the camels which carry pro- vifions, without our paying any thing extra upon that account. 6th. If we meet with Mr. Garden at Baghdad, he is beft able to inform us of the price of a hired horfe to ride on to Aleppo. 7th.

Mr. Shaw will give us a letter of credit on Mr. Garden or Cojee Raphael (as Mr. Hough ot Bombay did before on Mr. Shaw) tor what monies we fhall want. If we fhould not have occafion for the whole of v/hat w^ leave with Mr. Shaw, or rather, for what we have given our draughts on Mr. Hough in that cafe, he provides us with credit upon JVliner-Rigo, by means of Mr. Drummond at Aleppo. 9th.

When we fhall arrive within two days journey of Aleppo, we are to fend a letter to Mr. Drummond the Britifh coniul there, and acquaint him with the number of our party. This is cuftomary, as he generally makes a point to meet his countrymen at fome little diftance from the city, 13th.

They left us about noon, after our exchanging mutual good wifhes and compliments. Monl. Hemet of French extraction, but for many years employed as inter preter to the Englijh factory at Ifpahan, and now ruined in his circumftances by the civil wars carried on in Perfta, joined us at Bajfora, on his way to Baghdad* where his family refidedand he propofed carrying them from thence to Venice, his wife's native place. We found it extremely pleafant on the river, and were fo lucky as to have a brifk foutherly wind. At fix in the morning, we pa/fed by the ruins of an old village j and a little afterwards faw a tomb on the Arabian fhore. At feven, we were obliged to anchor, in order to wait for the coming up of our luggage-boat. At half paft feven weighed again, and difcovered a fmall Arab camp, in which, were many fheep. The defert came up clofe to the river on the left-hand fide. About ten, we pafled by the tomb of Meti Sahah Zemaun y who we were told was the Ton of Mahomet. He had been dead 1170 years, and according to the tradition of the country, was to appear again in a very fhort time, when he would mount on the back of an untamed mule in the foreft, ride over the face of the whole earth, and be its fovereign : the tomb Hands on the Arabian fhore. At twelve, we palfed by another tomb on the fame fide, railed to the memory ot Aly Kb en Hajfein,. a nephew of Aly the renowned. Between five and fix in the afternoon, we reached the village of Corn a or Quorne &gt; near which place refides the chief of the Janizaries of this pr ovince. Coma lies betwixt the two rivers Fygris and Euphrates, By tJu defire ot our Chocarda, we faluted the Sheick of the place-, three guns only were intended, but our Lafcar gunner, willing to give more, primed the fourth, and fired it. At eight in the evening we left Coma*, Had cloudy weather with lightning to the fouthward. At half paft twelve at night, we were obliged to come to an anchor : the weather fqually, the wind S. S. W. and a (trong tide letting to the N. E. We failed thefe laft 24 hours, about 75 miles. At two-o'clock in the morning we made fail again, the weather becoming fair: at five handed the fails, and lent the Trackers on fhore. The river is here about five hundred yards broad. Both fhores are very pleafant, particu larly that on our left, where is a great deal of ripe corn, which the people are now gathering in ; on the other fide large numbers of cattle are grazing. Geo graphers conje6lure the country around here to have been the feat of the gar den of Eden for no other reafon probably but becaufe it is pleafant, and lies between the Tygris and Euphrates, We obferved a company of above 60 Pelican s 3[ 238 ] Pelicans, fwimmlng majeftically along the river-, Mr. Alms fired a ball among them, of which they took but little notice: we were then golZ to dilcharge one of the fmall cannon loaded with (lugs, but our CbL'r-f* telling us it would be a fin, we delifted. At eight o'clock we pafTed by two slrab villages, and loon afterwards a large camp of Arabs. At twelve at noon, the latitude by obfervation was 31 0 go ' north. At three we ohsuRET. to^an anchor abreaft of Monfuret, zn Arab village, in order to change our Our Chocarda and we have not well agreed to day. We fufpea; that he intends to impofe on us, flarting difficulties only to make a merit of gettino- us out ol: them again. He wanted us to falute the Sheick of this village 5 which we would not comply with ; this offended him, and he talks taking himfelf on board the luggage-boat. We appear indifferent about ir as we know he will never leave the good wines and other liquors which he finds with us, and which he feems fo much to like, merely for indulging a petulant humour At fix o'clock, finding our Chocarda had not fucceeded in getting a new let ot 'Trackers^ we weighed and flood over to the villao-e where we found him in high difpute. The. chief of the hamlet happeV ing to be abfent, an old man who called himfelf Sheick for the time prefent, offered to fupply our officer with men, but infilled on bein« paid for them belore-hand; on this head, the difpute arofe. We thought it bell to accommodate matters, by ordering the payment of the money, and eight Marmoodas were accordingly depofited : no fooner how ever was the money paid, than new difficulties arofe from another, a younger perion, who infilled that he was the chief, and not the man who had received the Marmoodas and while our Chocarda was conteftina; it with this new Pretender, the firll endeavoured to make his efcape. Our officer twice took bdd of h. m and at length, by violence forced him on board the yacht. on this, the young fellows of the village fcreamed out Allah and multitudes ran towards the veflel, demanding the prifoner, who after Vome altercation was delivered up to fhem. In about three quarters of an hour after his enlargement, they brought down twelve who feemed to come on board with great reludance. Their chief, upon delivering them! recover The^ T T ^ glVen him as a P rerent . ^ h? was to recovei the Marmoodas from the other perfon in the beft manner he could. From this in (lance it plainly appears, what little regard is paid to the an'ord -r f om rhe ' ' ' ir0r notw ' : hftan(lmg we had obtained n ord.r tiom the governor of BnJJ to the chiefs of the villages to funnly woTourr ^dT 1 ftage tl ?- ftage ' the y tri,W - here for above be had T r nnnr Tr ^ mere cilnt of bribing that a frefli fet of men could ment ouahr m h k ^ Ve ^ Up0n this that no kind of pay- cmain ilm -iHn H d , eman ^ d from us-, for as thefe them befides ■ m Y ' lem • rorn t government, whatever we paid inem ueiiaesj was a mere impofiuon. 1 A*[ 2 39 J • A i ! :he e y e n ing We cro!red the river with our new Trackers, hav ing firft filled their bellies with mutton and rice, in hopes of getting them into good humour. We fent fix afliore firft, agreeable to cuftomt they tracked about three quarters of an hour, when our luggage boat comini near with the Chocarda, the others that remained on board told us that fix would not be fufficient to draw the veflH at night, as the wind then blew frefh, and offered to go afhore and affift their companions. When they found that we would not confent to this propofal, they took an opportunity of jumping into the Sandul^ and from her to the fhore, and there joined their comrades: they all direftly ran off, leaving us to take care of our- felves. On this we hauled into the middle of the ftream, and anchored, got our guns loaded with grape-fhot, and our fmall arms ready, to prevent being furprized by the Arahs y for from their late extraordinary behaviour we knew not what to think. At ten we called to Mr. Hewiet^ who with the Chocarda, flept in the luggage-boat; we propofed to him, as the wind was roul, to bear back again tor Corna^ and there take in men for the next ftage. He feemed to think that it would be lofing both time and way, and gave as his opinion that it would be more eligible to continue where we were, be upon our guard, and wait for a fair wind to carry us to the next town; adding, that the Choearda was of opinion the men would return again in the morning. We alked whether he approved of our firing a mulkel over any boat that might approach us in the night ? The Chocarda anfwered, ' if you$7 6 into tioe hoat and kill any of thcyyi^ I will he ciujwzvcihle for the coti* fequences' We refolved however not to proceed to fuch extremities, unlefs we apprehended our lives to be in danger. No difturbance whatever hap pened during the remainder of the night. Sailed this day 34 miles. About five this morning, our Trackers returned to us. They affured us, and April 30 we had reafon to believe them, that they ran away by the fole diredion of our Chocarda, but cannot get at the whole truth of the affair. We got under way immediately, as did our luggage-boat: we ftill fee great numbers of cattle grazing on each fide of the river, and alfo obferved a boy croffing it on the backs of Buffaloes., He fhifted himfelf from the back of one of thefe beads, to another, with great dexterity, as often as he found it necef- fary for the order and better conducing of his herd. This extraordi nary feat of adivity,. put me in mind of that paffage in the fifteenth book- of Homer's Iliad, where a man is reprefented as managing four horfes at once, and leaping from the back of one to another at full fpeed *. • So when a horfernan from the watry mead (Skili'd in the manage of the bounding fteed) Drives four fair courfers, prafHs'd to obey.

Pops*/ [ 240 ] . . Yefterday, as well as to-day, we pafled by feveral Arab towns, and feme W tombs. We fee from time to time ducks and paddy-birds : every mornina the lark fings moft delightfully. At noon our latitude by obfervation was north. We have now no longer any tide of flood to help us, but a conftanr 'ream running down. At half after two in the afternoon, we palTcd bva Turkijh galley, in which was the brother of Aly Aga, governor of Ihfca ■ this gentleman faluted us with one gun, which we returned under jack, enfien and pendant. he feemed to have a large train of attendants with him 'At three we came abreaft of a village on the left-hand fliore, called Mcochalban- and foon afterwards faw ten or twelve wild hogs at a little diflance from the river. Meffieurs Dodge and Pigot went afliore in hopes of killing one but they were difappointed by the hogs running into the nrflies. On the flight-hand fide we law alio ejght or ten turtle, which would not fuffer us to come near them, but flipt away into the water. After ei^ht o'clock this morning, no corn was to be feen on the right-hand fide of the river- and fince twelve, none on the left: the whole is pafture land. The oxen and buffaloes here arc large, and all the iheep have broad flat tails with Ipiral endings. ' The of the yacht have worked brifldy to-day, we encouraged them by good feeding; they had rice and Gee in the morning and 'the remnants of our meat at dinner, which they greedily devoured' firfl: tear ing it in pieces like fo many Jackalls. We pleafed them much by telling no e rT;,' fh W ^ W0 ^ glV j th T g 00d ^ and r a y them ourfelves, and not leave the CW^ to do it for us. At half paft flve this afternoon we made our little yacht fall to the bank, and waited for the Sandal, which was far aflern.

This excufe however did not fatisfy the remaining Arahs, who rofe tumultuoufly, and infifted on our refcuing their companions. We were obliged therefore with arms to purfue the Chocarda's boat; who immediately on difcovering that we were Frengees, or Franks, that is Europeans, difmiffed our people, took his own again, and proceeded on very quietly. We took the opportunity of waiting for the coming up of the Sandal, to prefent our Trackers with two or three -ftinking Sahle-fijh. They inftantk made a fire, and broiled them upon the coals : as foon as this was done, they feparated themfelves, and divided the fifli into two diftinct lots ; each party appointed a dire&lt;5tor, and he, after having made the feveral portions as equal as pofTible, ordered every man to take his Chare. When they had eaten as much as they could, and drank plentifully of the water of the Euphrates, they all feated themfelves on the ground in a circk, and joyouQy began to clap their hands and fing. Prefently, one of them got up and danced for awhile, then defired the favour of us to lend him a drawn fword, and hav ing obtained one, he danced again, and dextroufly flourifhed it, whilft the others clapped and fung. A fecond now joined him, with another fword, and both together difplayed their adivity and addrefs. The entertainment at length ended with a dance of fix, which was not much unlike our Eng- iijh hayes. We appeared, as we really were, pleafed with their mirth. When all was over, they drew nigh to us, kifled our lleeves, and afked for a Buxie, or prefent: we tendered them a dram, which they rejeded with vifible contempt j we then gave a Rupee among them, with which they were much pleafed, and very thankful. W r e took this opportunity to liint to them, that as we were fuch good mafters, and had given them fo much viduals and money too, we expected that they would work well, and .deferve our future favour, which they promifed very readily. A little before eight this evening, the luggage'-boat joined us, and our Chocarda and Mr. Hemet defired us, that for the next two or three days, we would keep nearer to them, becaufe they looked upon this as the moft dangerous part of the whole country, adding, that an hour or two before, they had been vifited by about twenty armed Arabs, who tho* they made no hoftile attempt, yet had a very fufpicious appearance. On this intelligence we refolved that the luggage-boat fhould keep a head, and that we would follow her clofely, keeping always a ftrifl guard, with our fwivel guns loaded, matches lighted, fmall arms at hand, and in order; a regular third watch was ordered alfo to be kept. Meffieurs Alms, Doidge, and Py* were appointed commanding officers: Mr. Pigot, Jenkins, M-Intojh, and other fervants, to watch •, I am excufed on account of my being indifpofed. We underftood from Mr. Hemet, who fpake with the Chocarda before-men tioned, pafling from Baghdad to BaJJora, that the Caravan would not fet out from the firft of thefe places for Aleppo 'till the tenth day of the Ra- I i mazan I75« f f 1Monday, May i. N awas hee. [.242 ] mcrzan (with us the twentieth of May) fo that we flatter ourfelves we arrive at Baghdad in good time. We advanced about thirty five miles td day. About 11 at night we palFed by two rivers on the right. ( ' ' v t At one this morning we got to a town on the left fhore, called The officer of the watch hailed the Sandal, intending to defire the Chocarda to go afhore •, but was anfwered, that he was aflcep, and would not be dif- turbed till the morning: we had reafon to think he was drunk. A little before four we fent our people on fhore to track. We wanted' two of tHe twelve men belonging to the yacht to go and aflift in tracking the luggage- boat, whole flow motion greatly retarded our progrefs ; but they would not comply, faying they were hired for our veffel only. About eight we came abreaft of another large town on the left hand (it's real name 1 have for gotten). Here fo great a number of men and boys, and even women, were colledVed to look at us, that they became quite troublefome. Among them we obferved fome of the men armed with fwords; and as the wind and ftream were both againft us, and confequently could pafs but flowly by, we thought it neceflary to make as great a (hew as poflible of our arms, to prevent any infult •, however, none was offered to us; on the contrary, fome of the chief of the yjrab inhabitants of the place, thinking we might be offended at fuch a concourfe of people, who could eafily have jumped into the vefiel, took upon them to difperfe the multitude. What feemed chiefly to attra6l the eyes of the /Irabs, and furprize them moft, was the form of the yacht, the manner of rigging her, and above all, the carved work of a horfe's head on the fiem, and the reprefentation of human figures on the ftern * The country hitherto has been fo level, that our officers have not wanted an horizon, for their obfervations at noon with Hadley's quadrant. Corn fields are now not fo frequently met with as formerly. The corn in general* was ripe and much of it gathered in, but there was ftill fome on the ground,, green and young in the ear. We pafled many villages on each fide of die river, but the greateft number are on the left. All the houfes are built of reeds, and covered with mats, and moft of them are in the form of tilted waggons. 1 he complexion ot the Arabs in general is pale ; children and fuch as do not work in the lun, are remarkably fo, but the Trackers are of a deep copper colour, approaching nearly to black. We had a farther trial of our patience this morning, having been greatly perplexed with additional demands from ihz Trackers, concerning provifions; they inhiling that we fhould flop and buy fome cakes, which they expeft to be lupplied with at leaft twice a day, befides their ufual allowance of rice 1 »* A . l2e ^ e iT re ex |. raordl , nar y %lits&gt; as all fuch images are forbidden by the Turks, left ido latry flioald fprout from them. 7 and ■Eiwmmmmmmm it i« r 243 J and Ghee. We had reafon to fufpexft our drunken Chocarda at the bottom of this difturbance, for notwithftanding his folemn looks and high founding voice, and all that pompous grimace under the Chocarda cap (which is at leaft a foot and an half in height) I obferved him in the morning very fami liar with our 'Trackers. While we were vexing ourfelves at the unnecelTary delay which this new demand of cakes had occafioned, he lay balking in the fun, upon the fhore, and had many fellows about him, who champooed, or itretched his joints, picked from his head and the collar of the coat his vermin, and at the fame time entertained him with one of their chorus fongs. The fellow appeared much delighted, and in a very parti cular manner expreffed his thanks, by putting his arm round the necks of the youngeft, and killing them; this mark ot his gratitude however was re jected by fome of the Arabs, who flung themfelves from him, with a look of ineffable contempt. There was but little difference here, in the drefs of the women and men, except that the firft had no Turbans^ but a fort of handkerchief, or veil, over their heads and faces. They had alfo rings in their ears and nofes, and bracelets on their wrifts •, but their outer garment is like the men's, a Camaline of black and white, like thofe we ourielves now wear, and which we provided ourfelves with at Gombroon, when we intended to go to Bajfora in a Trankey, difguifed as Arabs. We pafled feveral very ftately tombs; but faw no other birds to-day but gulls. Now and then we obferved a few date trees, but they have been rare fince we got into the Euphrates. We now begin to think that our Chocarda is in reality, rather a hindrance than of t ule to us, and almoll wilh we had come without him, and refolve to treat him more cavalierly than heretofore, and not fo implicitly to yield to his commands. The night before lad we put on board the Sandal, a bottle of claret, and another of fhrub for the ufe of Mr. Hemet, left we lliould be feparated from him again, as we were yellerday at dinner time. We are now told, that .the Turk, though he had before taken a chearful glafs with us, the very fame evening drank a pint of the claret off at a draught, and finilhed the bottle the next morning. He makes it a rule to call for punch every quarter of an hour, befides drams at intervals. Coffee (the Turks common regale) he often refufes, and has forbidden its being gotten for him; he fays, that he likes punch better, but prefers claret (of ten fhillings a bottle) above all other liquors. We fhall however mortify him in this particular, and for the future drink no wine at dinner, when he happens to be with us. At four this afternoon, we pafled a fmall river on the left-hand Ihore; as ■we had before feveral on the right ■, this we can trace with the eye above a mile into the Defert. Between feven and eight, we got to Cota, a village on the left fide of the river, a few houfes of which are built with ftone, I i 2 which 17 i8. \, 1 y iWMn mf C ot a.e •* V[ 244 1 which we did not obferve before in any other village fituated on the banlc of this river j a mud-wall furrounds it. We faluted the chief with one gun. At half pafl; ten, we changed our 'Trackers. Thofe we now difcharged, entertained us with a fong at parting, and gave an excellent charafter of us to their fuccefTors y they went fo far as to tell us r that fhould we not be able to get new men here, they would track us up to Hilla. We per- formed our promife to them, as to paying them their wages ourfelves, and behaved very coldly to our Chocardcr. On this account Mr. Hemet vifited us r and earneftly recommended, that we fhould not carry matters to extremities with this man, exprefTing his fear that if we did, his villainy might prompt him to carry on intrigues with the Arabs to our prejudice; he propofed that, on the contrary, we fhould put twenty rupees into his hands, and defire that with them he would procure provifions for himfelf and fervant, and purchafe of the villagers what might be wanting for the Trackers : he was perfuaded that the Chocarda would cheat us of our money, but that he looked on as the leaft of the evils we had to apprehend ; but obferved, if at our arrival at Hafca, we fliould flill have reafon to be dif- pleafed, there would be the fitteft place to difmifs and difgrace him, ao quaiming the governor Aly Aga of his behaviour. Sorely againft our will, we acquiefced in thepropofal, and at his requeft delivered into his hands for the Cho car da's ufe a bottle of flrong liquor, with which he got drunk before eleven o'clock the fame night.—Advanced the fall twenty-four hours T about thirty-two miles. Courfe was chiefly north-weft. May z. Yefterday we were greatly perplexed with files,,, but now with Mufchetos $ the air during the night, was rather cold. At three this morning we paffed a large lake on the left, and at four, another, with great difficulty to our Trackers ; {poke then with a boat from Baghdad^ Hojajhee mailer, who told us he was dilpatched by Mr. Garden with letters for Mr. Shaw at BaJfora r and that we fhould be early enough for the Caravan. At fix we an chored abreaft of the village Arsjia ; we faluted the Sheick with one gun,, difcharged our Trackers and got others.—At nine we weighed, and began to track again. Mr. Pye and myfelf, while we were off Arsjia, took a little walk on fliore; that place, like almoft all the other Arab villages we had yet feen, is chiefly compoied of very pitiful reed and mat-houfes r encom- pafled with a mud-wall and battlements, with a view to its being defended: with lances, and matchlock mufketry (the principal arms of the Arabs) againll their rebel countrymen in the Defert, who are commonly called the wild Arabs. Almoft all the Arabs who have not fwords, carry in their hands a hooked flick about two feet long. They here wear their beards to^a lull length, trimming them to a point below the chin: the young people have their hair long on the forehead, but behind they are commonly fhaved. la[ 245 ] In our walk we faw fix or eight loaded camels going into Arsjia. We 1758. now loft fight of corn fields; the banks and country near the river, being covered with a ftrong fcented thorny fhrub, having a ferrated leaf, fmaller, but in make like that of the Gum-Arabic, Two or three pelicans went down the river, and about three in the afternoon, many partridges fprung from out of the fhrubs. We were prefented by a poor Arab with a mullet, weigh ing two pounds, which he ftruck with his fpear; and laft night we had fome cucumbers and milk given to usj we returned thanks for each, in a two- marmaoda piece. We killed this afternoon, what we were told, was a venomous water- fnake, two feet and a half in length, that had gotten up the veffers rudder, and was making its way into the cabbin. At five MefTrs. Alms and Pigot went on fhore with their fufils, in hopes of fhooting partridges, which are here in great plenty j they faw many, but had no fuccefs, and returned with only three doves. Moft of the road to-day has been very difficult for our 'Trackers. Wind,, current, and rippling waves againft us. A boat pafled us this afternoon, three days from Hilla, loaded with provifions. We now hear every night a hideous howling of Jackalls, and our Trackers are very fearful of meeting with lyons. At noon our latitude by obfervation was 31 0 4' north, which being but fix miles more than we made on Sunday laft, (hews that our courfe has been chiefly weft. Got this day thirty-four miles. We pafled this laft night very difagreeably. Our rafcal of a Chocarda Ma y 3* was the occafion; without affigning the leaft reafon for it, he about eight in the evening, put the luggage-boat on fhore, and infifted that we fhould do the fame with the yacht j but his words had no influence on us; on the contrary we got at a proper diftance into the ftream, where we could both fee, and oppofe an enemy. This fellow, who was either much frightened himfelf, or willing to frighten us, expatiated largely on the danger we were now in from the wild Arabs, and urged the necefllty of our keeping clofe to him: the very reafons he affigned for our doing it, induced us to get farther from the fhore, whofe bank in this place, was much higher than our veffel, and almoft hung over our heads. We learned afterwards from Mr. Hcmet (who was fo unhappy as to be with him all night) that upon our get ting into the ftream, he grew enraged, whifpered the Trackers, and gave them their cue to alarm us: they hailed us from the fhore, and told us, if we did not immediately draw nigh to them, they would run away. We made no reply, nor any change in our conduct. Soon after, they fet up a hideous noife, fome times in the howl of the Jackalt, fometimes like a dog, and every now and then called to us in a threatening manner. Our Chocarda finding that all his fchemes had no manner of eflfeft upon us, ordered his Arabs to dance and fing around their fire •, and for the whole of their obedient behaviour, 5 ^■GR AY HIM, [ 246 ] iie diftributed among thetn two Abaffees, telling them they were good boys, and that he expcded the fame fubmiflion to his future commands, as they had Ihewn that evening. He dropt alfo fome threatening exprefllons to Mr. llemet, as ' that having refufed to obey his direfiions, we Jhouldperijh.' He load- .ed his muiketand piftol, and at half pafl eight, fired thefirft, and at ten the laft, both with ball, pointed towards us, but not fo diredUy, as if defigned to hit us. Mr. Hemet obferved, that foon after he whifpered again to the Arabs, when fcven or eight of them left the veflel and got afhore; prefently they returned on board in a diforderly hafte, and fo disfigured, as greatly to alarm him: the villains view, no doubt, was fofar to intimidate Mr. Hemet, •that we through him might be prevailed upon to fubmit ourlelves implicitly to his orders. The good old man indeed did hail us feveral times, and told us, the fcoundrers condud was luch, that he really was in ivar of his life, and that he could not help fufpeding, he was meditating i^me mifchiev- ous defign againft us. About a quarter after ten he once more got under fail, pafled to the other fide of the river and began to track: we did the fame. At one in the morning, he laid the luggage-boat afhorc again, for no reafon that we could think of, unlefs to give us a frelh proof of his infolence and endeavour for the maftery. We determined with one confent to purfue our plan, and by no means to fubmit ourfelves to his folly and obftinacy. We formed among ourfelves various fchemes for punilhing him for^his infolence; but on this head came to no final deter mination, having heard too much of the revengeful ways of thefe people, to refolve precipitately. However, as we carry a letter of recommendation from Mr. Shaw to Aly Aga, governor of Hafca\ we fhall talk to him, on the Chocarda's behaviour, and probably prevail on him to hinder his going any farther with us. At nine this morning we pafled by a large river on the right hand; which communicates with the fygris, and has a large place {landing near it called Grayhim. The weather cloudy, wind N. N. E. and blew frefh, fo that our 'Trackers had very hard work. At three in the afternoon, the Sandal flopped, and the Chocarda\ Arabs were very active in fecuring our veflel to a ftake, near his. We called out in a peremptory tone to call off our rope imme diately; they obeyed us, and we anchored off in the ftream, fo as to com mand either ftiore. We had prefently an alarm from the Chocarda, of Arabs being near us-, but not dilcovering any from our poop, or maft-head, we were very tranquil. In the fpace of half an hour, the luggage-boat tracked again; we did the fame, and foon joined her; then our Chocarda hailed us in a more complailant manner than of late, and told us to be under no alarm, that no thing fhould hurt us; we gave him .for anfwer, that we were perfe(5tly eafyin relpect to all the world, but himfelf •, that we were prepared to refill a thoufand Arabs or more .; but that our peace had been fomewhat diilurbed by his irregular condudl: we affured him that we would be our own mailers, and, if we thought fit to go ahead, to be aftern, near the fhore, or in ^he middle - ot the ftream, we fhould guide ourfelves in conformity to our 5 ownt 2 47 ] own opinion, whether it fhould pleafe or difpleafe him ; that therefore, if 1758. he chofe to be on good terms with us, it was neceflary he fhould reconcile himfelf to our reloJution. He made a civil reply, and came into our yacht. We recapitulated the particulars of his ill behaviour, and plainly told him* that a continuance of it, could not end to his advantage, either in refpecft to his mafter at Baffora, the Bajha of Baghdad or ourfelves. He now laid afide his haughtinefs, and faid, he was lorry for what had pafled, and promifed a better look-out for the future. We finifhed our lefture by advifing him to drink coffee and water only, gave him a diih of the firft and relblved he fhould have from us nothing elfe. No villages, corn fields or pafture land nothing but wild fhrubs on the banks of the river, and the Defert is at a quarter of a mile diftance. Numbers of partridges and pidgeons ftill. We this day were very bufy in making bounces to give a grand falute to Aly Aga\ and, as they may be ufeful to us againft an enemy in the room of hand-grenades, we propofed to prepare a number of them, loaded with flugs of lead and iron. At eight at night we anchored; at eleven weighed ; at a quarter paft eleven dropped anchor again, the Chocarda calling to us, that our men were run away, which was both falfe and improbable, being fo far from their home, and having had no wages ; they had laid themfelves down on the Ihore, being weary and in want of reft, after wading through much deep water. The weather from nine in the morning till five in the afternoon, was too warm to be pleafant, yet not fo hot as to give Eaji Indians great reafon to complain. Twelve at night, wind N. W. by N. and cold. Meflrs. Doidge and Alms, who flept on the poop during the firft watch, were glad to get. into the cabbin in the middle and morning watches, on account of the cold; the fharpnefs of the night air made me cough terribly, but this night being tolerably well, I began to watch. Tht Pelicans, which on rifingfrom. the water make a great noife with flapping of their wings, before wc- were accuftomed to them, gave our watchmen fome little, alarm. We got about twenty miles to-day. There was no horizon for an ob-- fervation at noon.—The boats which the Arabs ufe hereabouts differ from, thofe I defcribed at Bajfora only in the fhape; they are made like our Lon don wherries, and are paddled on by two men, but if large, by four. At five in the morning our Trackers arofe from their fieep, and began May 4, to track. Wind W. N. W. The river very crooked. At two in the after noon, we had paffed by feveral fmall iflands. At three we made our veffels fall to the fhore, the Sandal being behind j at a quarter paft four we began, to track again. Laft night our Chocarda fupped with us, and thereby deprived us,, for awhile, of our bottle of claret. To-day he dined with us, and made us undergo[ 2+8 ] undergo the fame felf-denial. He courted us very much, but we gave him to underftand, that works and not words dilplay the man: this obfervatioti filenced him, and we have no more repetitions of his being our devoted fervant. We defired Mr. Hemet (whom we had now taken on board the yacht) to beg the Chocarda to haften on board the Sandal \ and to tell him alfo, that as ^we had loft fo much time in the night, we ought not to lofe any in the day. He was not well pleafed, and told Mr. Hemet in a vulgar phrafe of the Turks ' That he (Hemet) had eaten T—d, and to him, all the difturbances and mirunderftandings, had been owing/' The road for our Trackers, is here in general very bad; they are obliged to work much in the water. The country about us, fuch as we paflcd ycfterday. Great quantity of partridges and doves, are yet to be feen. The edges of the river abound in fedge, the cyprefs-tree, a dry plant full of a thorny feed-veflel, and the caper fhrub. The Mufchetos are innumerablci their firings and hnmmings are intolerable to us in the night, while the flies are extremely troublefome in the day. At fix this evening, we pafled by an iflandand at«eight we anchored in the ft ream: the Sandal was made faft to the fhore. We gained but twenty-two miles to-day. No horizon for obfervation. At five in the morning weighed, and began to track. At nine pafled two fmall boats, one going down the river, the other up \ this laft had five men with three matchlocks-, they looked fufpicious, and our Chocarda aflured us they were rogues; but our Knockaty or pilot, told us he knew them, and that the chief of the boat lived in the next village; that he had come thus far as an efcort to the other boat, and now offered his fervifce to us. We thought this the moft probable ftory of the two, yet kept a good look out all the following night. At ten we anchored, our Trackers having left the rope; at eleven, weighed and tracked again: fome rain fell, but in no great quantity *, it thundered and lightned, as it did yefterday.—At half paft two, took the Trackers on board, and made fail with a fine and fair breeze. By four we pafled by an old ruined fort, and three rivers on the right, one of which we were told was a branch of the Tygris. At half paft five, fent afhore the Trackers. At half paft ten we anchored to wait for the Sandal. Had it not been for the vexation, proceeding from the Mufchetos, this evening had pafled very pleafantly. On both fides of the river are the willow, and poplar trees •, a number of birds rooft in them, which we dif- turbed in our paflage •, the pidgeon, turtle, and variety of finging birds are here in great abundance. During the whole night one of the fongfters chaunts the notes of the thrufh and nightingale. Large flocks of Pelicans^ many ducks, partridges, kingVfifhers and fwallows, are around us.[ 249 ] I ob/erved the river this evening, to be full of filh; manv of them iumoed out ot the water, and were two feet lono- W p ' u- J^mpea 1758. to-day.

SEMAVA Is a walled town, but the houfes are all built of mud. The place is governed by a Sheick, called Ifmael, (fubordinate to Aly Ago) a very artful, complaifant old gentleman. He came on board of us in a fmall boat a little before we reached the town, and told us, that ' havino- had advice of our coming by a boat which pafled us yefterday, he had gotten all things in readinefs for our reception, as twenty Trackers, and provifions for them in plenty; and that he came in perfon to aflure us, he was wholly devoted to our fervice.' He apologized much for his Bifhabille, and •negled in (having his head and trimming his beard, which he faid was owing to his being in mourning for two near relations. He had a great facility of fpeech, and his compliments were truly hyperbolical. He re peated often ' how much he was our fervant. Sick and weak as he found himfelf, yet he was ready to take his heart from his bread to do us good: his arms, his eyes, his head, the whole which he poffefled, were all at our command.' He foon added with a melancholy figh, that ' he had for lometime paft been indifpofed, much owing to worldly difficulties; and at prefent was called on by the government iox thirty purfes of money; but that he could, as yet, raile only five and not long after, we were given to underftand, that whatever prefent we were willing to make him, he was ready to accept with thankfulnefs. Flower, rice, and Ghee were brought on board for our new Trackers*, cucumbers, mn^, and two lambs for ourfelves. We faluted the Sheick with one gun, entertained him, his lecretary, and a little flave boy who ftood by him, firft with coffee and then with fugar by way of fweet-meat; but left it to r * Ij-Wiet and the Chocarda^ to recompenfe him for his prefents and trouble, icy gave him twenty-five Ahajfees j and the old gentleman appearing not fatisiied,■%ifl wGercetj, [ 2 5i ] fat is fie d, xhtChocarda, paffionately, offered his hand to receive the money hack, and the as haftily returned it: thus things flood for a little time; at length the old fox took back the money, and delivered it to his iurietaiy.i his little Qave kifled our hand, and the mafter recommendino-him to our favour, we prefented him with an Ahaffee. At half pad eleven, the Skcick left us, fam ceiemome, by which we concluded that he made lefs of us than he expe&amp;ed. We bought here one frail or bafket of 'Dates z*, an addition to the 'Track- mrood, and a few leeks, being all the proviQons we could purchafe. m tne rriaricet. At two m the afternoon, we pafTed a river going, from the N, E ; at half mft three, got into a perfect level, which made all the country around appear like one watered marfh. This overflowing of the river we were told is not common fo foon in the year We concluded there muft have been great rains, or extraordinary meltings of fnow on the mountains-, and we pleaie ourfelves with the hopes that the wells of water in the Defert, will hkewife be plentifully fupplied. At a quarter after fix, we flopped for the - other boat and were then abreaft of two large Arab camps, in the wildefl: and moft dreary country I ever beheld. Moft of us - took a fhort walk' on ihorei but not beyond the protedion of our little frigate. At feven we tracked again, and at eight were obliged to come to an anchor, it beino- very dark, and the proper channel difficult to find, by reafon of the river^over- rtowing it's banks for- a long way into die Deferi. We continued to keep a,good look-out, both night and day; and like watchful centinels called to each other, ' All' is well.' . ^ ur now altered his conduct much for the better, often tell- ^ I* our / ervant » and our's only, and that he likes us fo &gt; weil, he fhali be ready to accompany us to Aleppo-;' we have not re turned the compliment, but continue to treat him though civilly yet at fome diftance. Our prefent Arab Trackers, like all their brethren'of our acquaintance, already begin to grumble, notwithflanding they have had an addition to their common food by our giving them the preferved Bate fruit' which thefe people are at all times very fond of, but more fo now, as there is, and has been for fome time pafl, a very great demand for Dates haghdad, Moful, and Diarhekir, a dreadful famine having raaed in the two laft cities. Baghdad itfelf was alarmed, and twelve thoufand Eerfjans now refiding there, received orders to quit the place, before the - icarcity.fhould adually reach it.

A prefent of buffalo fteakes were fent to us to-day, which,we had for dinner, and relilhed them very well; and in the evening we had a prefent of milk, for which we always pay dear by a pecuniary return. ' It being Saturday night, according to our old fea cuftom, we allowed ourfelves an extraordinary bottle, devoting it to the remembrance of our wives, fweethearts, parents, families and friends. The Mufchetos are Ids troublefome than of late, owing to our having no bufhes about us. Wc advanced this day twenty-three miles. Had no obfervation. May/. This is the firft day of the new moon, and the beginning of the ^reat faft, Ramazan, It continues till the fixth of June, this faft beains ?verv year ten days fooner than in the former year. At three quarters after tour this morning, we began to track, wind at S. E ^ and we foon ^t into a very delightful meadow country, pretty well inhabited by Arabs and their herds, and watered plentifully by the river: this green and watery profped: extends as far as the eye can reach. On our right, the rifing ground js cultivated in fome fpots, producing radilhes, &amp;c. Here are the white and brown Paddy birds, fo common in the Eaji Indies, called by that name becaufe they chiefly feed in the Paddy or rice fields, We faw alfo the painted diver, and black and white crow. In the middle and morning watches the air was fomewhat cold ; the atmof phere continued perfedly dry till laft night, when we-felt it damp. This morning at five o'clock, we law our Chocarda leave the Sandal, and ^o down the river in a little boat we hired at Semava a meflage foon after came from him, that four of the trackers had deferted, and he was gone back to arcer them but defiring us to go on, and he would follow. ■We law a galley aftern coming up the river. At feven, we paffed a boat ne days from Ihlla ; we underftood from her people, that the Caravan let out from Baghdad five days before we failed fromBaffora-, we are unwilling to believe inch bad news. About ten we palled another boat carryino- a Janizary down the river, who gave us intelligence of one Ccjee-Simon°m Armeman merchant, having been robbed aiid wounded in the river about three weeks ago ; that he was ftill with Jly Jga, but the governor had not ocen abU, as yet, to recover a box of pearls valued at twenty thoufsnd .upee^, wmch had been taKen from him.

The Armenian was palTW up the river m a defencelefs conditron, at the time he was robbed, and it is faid, his extraordinary care of his box, occafioned its being difcovered • and that his wounds were owing to the refiftance he made in parting with fuch valuable effefts. We paffed to-day four or five with lance!- thefe we apprehend are fome of lh&lt;t Banditti who infeft the banks of this great river and ttrike fo much dread into the minds of travellers. A fingle^perlbn, or a company of travellers unarmed, might (and I believe would) be in o-reat danger from them; but we have nothing to apprehend, provided we keep a good look-out. r Our Trackers work much in the water, and are incelTantly murmunng; for more provifion than we can afford them.' At Bajfora we laid in fo much rice and Ghee, as by the Turks about Mr. Shaw, was thought an ample (tore to carry us to Hilla, but that has been a long time fince expended, and more has been added from every place we have touched at, where there was a poffibility ot purchafing; yet we are always in want. At Semava* a ftock was put on board by the Sheick for twenty men, to which we added a frail of dates, weighing one hundred pounds; thefe are now greatly exhaulled, and we are apprehenfive of being in want. The truth is, thefe poor tracking fellows come to us half ftarved, they work hard, and can eat five times as much as they ufually get at home, or are allowed, when they ferve a Turk, or one of their own countrymen i but, whilft they are in the fervice of an European, of whole riches they entertain a mod extra vagant idea, they are ever difcontented with a common portion, and even with a double allowance, and in fpite of all his humanity and care, will crmmble and give him diftuibance ; all travellers therefore who come this way, fliould b^ careful to lay in a very plentiful ftock of provifions at their firit fettino- out from Bajfora as they will find it a very difficult talk to get any quantity afterwards. On the obferying or neglecfting of this particular, their future eaie or difcjuietude will in great meafure depend. It is not poflible to conceive, much lefs to delcribe, the horrid noile and difturbance, that is made by thefe Arabian male-contents upon fuch occafions: a ftranser to their language and cuftoms, could not but have his doubts, whether they were not about to feize him by the collar, and cut his throat. Their gmtural language, fierce and ghaftly looks, and threatening geftures, added to the natural wildnefs of the country, muft needs fill him with conftant appre- henfions of violence, and therefore cannot fail of making his whole palTa^e painful and difpleafing to a great degree. About two in the afternoon, a boat went by us from Baghdad, by which we learned the Caravan was not gone. Soon afterwards a Turktjh galley alfo paffed us with fome people of confequence; they faluted us with one gun, which :4Monday, May 8. [ 254 J we returned. We have no profpe^l: now but of thick fedge on each fide of the river, which is here about 120 feet wide. At four, got a little out of the rufhy into a more open and pafture country : here we flopped for our boat. Several Arab encampments are in fight, pitched on the fmall rifing fpots, which are fcattered here and there about this overflown, and fiat country. The prefent Arabs are, like their forefathers, a moveable people; they tra vel eaft, weft, north and fouth, and pitch their tents, or rufh houfes, as the foil beft ferves for feeding their cattle, of which they feem to have great plenty. While here, we were vifited by one of their Sheicks accompanied by three or four men better drefled than common i we fhewed them our arms, and gratified the Sheick with five or fix charges of gunpowder, for his match-lock piftol, and afterwards added a little InufF. Here we un- drefTed and fwam in the Euphrates. The fame fort of birds were feen by us to-day as yefterday. This day has been much overcaft, and hot, with thunder and lightening. 1 We were again terribly perplexed with Mufchetos this evening, but were relieved about twelve o'clock by a frefh gale : the Turbans, which we all wear, are the beft defence for our heads againft the fun i and our whifkers,, that have been growing ever fince we left Bombay, fecure the upper lip from the vexatious fting of thele infe&lt;5h. We made feventeen miles to-day. By obfervation at noon we were in the latitude of 31 0 24 north. At one o'clock in the morning, cloudy weather, with thunder, lightning and an appearance of rain falling to the northward. At half after one a mufket was fired from our yacht towards a fmall boat, which, from it's fufpicious condud, our people believed to be a thief. At two the Chccarda returned from Semava with the four deferters. At three, the wind changed from the fouth, to the north, and for a little time, blew very frefh: every now and then we heard the report of a mufket a little aftern of us, and upon our left hand. At half pad four, we began to track, as did the lug gage-boat with the Checarda. About fix, Meffieurs Alms and Pigot faw two wild hogs not far from our Trackers \ they fired four mufkets with balls, but the hogs efcaped among the rufhes. At feven, pafifed on the right, a plantation of cotton trees, in a very fertile foil, and more raifed from the river, than any we have lately obferved. At nine got again into an over flown meadow-country, with encampments of Arabs, their families, and cattle. Birds we faw as laft mentioned, and fome turtle •, the infedt we call Ladycow every now and then is among us, alio flies, moths, and horfe- ftingers ^ the fparrow is alfo to be found here, and in every other place that 1 have vifited in Afia. The greateft part of this day we tracked thro* water, choaked up with fedge, moft of it breaft high j the bottom, in fome places, was out of a man's depth. At fix in the evening, we reached the fide of a little ifland, and not far from it was an Arab camp j we waited there for our luggage- boat,r 255 ] boat, which did not get up to us, till nine o'clock. At feven, whilft at anchor, a Turkijh galley pafied us, having the Pajha Gange.Mahomed Aga on board ; a general commanding thirty thoufand troops: he had been down the Euphrates, direftmg at what places the river fiiould be let in, and where (lopped. We hailed him, and fome compliments pafled • he told us he fhould haul a little ahead, and lye by for the night •, we aniwered that we would do the fame. After he had juft pafled us, we faluted him with one gun, which he returned. On this little ifland Meflleurs Alms, Figot, myfelf and two fervants went afhore with our guns, and had good diverfion, Hiooting at Jackals •, they were the moft hairy ones I ever faw, and which like fpaniels took imme diately to the water. We found feveral of their holes, tired into one where we fufpeded a Jackal had kenneled, and made a fire before it, but without fuccefs. We aimed feveral fhot at an animal we took for the otter; it lay on the bank near the water, but dipt in, and fwam from'us, often diving, and when up, turning its head every now and then towards us, givino- a melan choly yell: we found its dung as large as that of a dog, it confiftcd of the ihells of crabs, with which the banks of the Euphrates abound, as alfo turtle egg fhells, and the fkins of many kind of infeds. We killed divers birds. By our Chocarda, we were told, that the dogs of an Arab camp behind us, had killed a large wild hog, which had been before wounded probably by Meffieurs Alms and Figot, This afternoon Mr. Alms killed with a fingle ball, at the diftance ot about two hundred and fifty yards, a beautiful pheafant-coloured curlew; there were more in corqipany. This has been a windy fatiguing day for our Trackers-, the middle part not very hot, the evening coR The Mufcbetos about this idand put us to infufferable pain, but we got rid of thefe tormentors in the nio-ht, as wc reached to windward of the ifland. This afternoon we pafled the'very fpot, where Cojee-Simon, the Armenian, was lately robbed; near to a place called Monzaradub. We faw here a great number of Pelicans. Got nine teen miles. Latitude by Meflleurs Doidge and Alms's obfervations 21 0 22 north, ^ The laft night was very cold, and this morning the wind is high, foul and bleak. Our Trackers flate is fuch, as calls aloud for pity, and plenty of food : they have worked feven hours in the fedge and water, brealt high; and at eleven o'clock in the morning no profpe6l of a change for the better. Saw two otters on a little dry bank, and fome turtle. We ^got this morning three quarts of fine rich milk, and wanted to pur- chaie a calf, but the Arabs would not lell it, nor have we been able to buy one fince entring the river ; not owing, as in India, to a religious fcruple, but becaufe it would be a leflening of the herd, on whofe number the impor tance of the Sheick entirely depends. Our Chocarda, this cold morning, 4 greatly[ 256 3 greatly exerted hlmrdf, by encouraging, punifhing, and by his own ex ample fhewing the Trackers how they ought to work ; he even ftripped and threw himfeif into the water, Iwam to the rope, and affifted for a little while in the tracking. What a ftrange alteration in the conduct of this* man ! About noon we drew near to a high fpot of ground, and pafled a tomb on the right, raifed to the memory of Hakb Hojfein. Upon this rifincr ground, is a large town built of mats called Lemhloon it is on the left fide of the river, oppofite to which, on the right, is another tomb or monument raifed to Imaum Kzaai. The river here is about three hundred feet broad. We fent our fervant to the village to buy provifions ; during his abfence the 'Turkijh galley pafled us, which had been to-day behind us, and lefs ex peditious than ourfelves. At four our Sandal went by likewife, and then our man returned with fome rice and Ghee^ and a bull-calf, which with great difficulty he had bought for us j they would by no means part with the female. Since we left Bajfora, we have always had cool water in plenty, owing to it's prefervation in the earthen jars, which we there provided ourfelves with. The water is not perfedlly clean, nor is it very foul ; we fine it in the jars with a little alum, otherwife it would be very muddy. Upon the whole, at pre- fent we make no complaint of our water, but often declare, that if the wells of the Vefert are as propitious to us, as the Euphrates is now, we fhall think ourfelves fortunate in this important article.' The fatigue of the morning occafioned one of our Trackers to rnn away; another ot them is fick, and two more are, or pretend to be fo. With pain, I obferved this forenoon, that one of the Trackers to the Turkijh galley from exceffive wearinels gave over work, and made towards the veiTel, en deavouring to get into her he feemed to be almoft exhaufted, and cried out for admittance, but inflead of being fufFered to enter the galley, he was fevercly beaten with a large (lick by one of the officers, and the poor crea ture was obliged to quit his hold, and to fwim the river; he made for the fedge on the left-hand fide, into which he threw himfeif, and lay groaning as we paifed by : it was debated whether we ought to take him in, but twas concluded, that this might give offence to the Ba/ha, and efpe- cially as the man was not far now from an Arabian camp. Soon after we had pafied him, he creeped afhore, and made towards the encamp ment. Our people fed well to-day; for to their rice and Ghee^ we added the offals of the calf. How different the cuftoms of thefe Arabs, from the Gentoos in India! none of the latter will eat of the moil delicate food, even if but another Getitooy unlefs of his own Caji, has touched it: die former are lbifHuuvwm t 257 ] fo free of fcruple, that they will feed on the guts and fkins of beafts, and eat every fcrap left on our plates, ^ At nine at night we anchored in the ftream, waiting for the Sanda/, which joined us a little before eleven ; prefently, the Chocarda gave an alarm by firing his mulket towards the Oiorej and calling outj that ' rogues were very near us in boats.' Our fervant Vertan inftantly fired another from the yacht, which obliged us all to arm and run to the deck. We de manded from the Sandal, the real caufe of this manoeuvre; were anfwered, that four or five boats had been near us, and though hailed, would make no anfwer. Mr. Pye, who had the watch, favv one fmall boat pafs with two or three men, but no more; and was difpleafed at the fervant's following the Chocarda'% example, as there was not the leaft occafion for the diftur- bance: by the diicharge of the mulkets, a village alfo was alarmed, which by the voices of men and women, the cry of children, and barking of dogs, we difcovercd to be very near. Soon after, there was a profound filence on board the luggage-boat, by which we judged that the Chocarda railed the alarm, with the view only to make us keep a good look-out, while he took a found fleep. The Turkijh galley was at this time about a quarter of a mile ahead, at anchor alfo in the ftream. Since we paiTed Lemhloon, we have been again amidft a low, wet country; the fides of the river full of fedge, and very diftrefling to our Trackers, The otters here are about the fize of a cat. We faw but few birds to-day. A fmall water-lilly grows among the flags all up this river. At twelve at night, the air was warmer than ufual, and damp. By obfer- vation the latitude is 31 0 40' north. We advanced only 12 miles this day. • In Mr. Alms's watch this morning, between the hours of two and five, fome little noife was heard on board the Sandal^ and our people underftood, that a man had jumped from her into the water, and fwam to the fhore: about feven o'clock, we received a mefTage from the Chocarda, defiring we would flop a little, for he wanted to fpeak to us on an affair of confequence : when he came, he told us, with a melancholy countenance, that, early in the morning he had been robbed of fifty Venetian Zechins and his outer veft; that the thief had fwam from the fhore, ftolen into the veffel, gotten to the place where he flept, and taken the money from his troufers pocket, and his coat by his fide. We farcaitically looked furprized, rallied, and told him his fleeping was unlike an officer; that none of us (which was the truth) had taken our clothes off fince we had been on the paffage and then exprefled our fears about the fafety of our own affairs under his protedlion. He would fain have perfuaded us to have given full credit to the ftory ; a nd to acquit himfelf of negligence, he laid the whole blame on thedrowfinefs of a relation of his in the fame veflel, in whole watchfulnels he faid he had 1 placed May 10.[• 25 8 ] placed o-reat confidence, and brought him on that very account. We fmiled, and appeared fo incredulous on the occafion, that contrary to his late ceremonious deportment} he le£t our vcflel without talcing leave. We began tracking this morning a little before five, and prefently after a boat went down the river, three days from Hilla, which told us that the Caravan was not yet gone. The land here is on the drain, it having been overflowed: in fight were many comfortlefs huts, fome placed on the very water, but almoft all on exceeding damp ground, drained by a fur. rounding ditch of a foot and a half deep, dug within tour or five feet of the hut itfelf. Such miferable places of abode, as we have paffed in great abundance of late, I never before beheld; in each, which confifts of one apartment only, are contained the man, wife or wives, children, dog, and now and then'two or three fowls. One Buffalo-cow always belongs to this wretched fpot, which every morning and evening is driven home to oive fuftenance to the family. In thefe hovels, you fee fometimes a (word, but always a lance of about nine feet in length, of the fame kind, but not near fo handfome, as thofe at Madagafcar and from them, I ima gine, iffue out the petty robbers of this part of Arabia. About four this afternoon we had on both fides, a fine level pafture country, well inhabited with Bufalos, oxen, cows and fheep ; the latter we have not remarked in plenty for fome- days paft. Saw however a great quantity of Pelicans, and other birds. The river here, is narrow, deep, rapid, and very muddy : the two laft owing to the land on our right being on the drain, and the water falling with fome velocity from a hanging leveU the land to the left is rather lower than the river, but the water is pre vented from overflowing, by a bank which has been thrown up by art, and coaftantiy kept in repair. 'We were frequently near the c turkijh galley to-day, but could not get a fight of the Bajha, he being in bed the whole or greateft part of the day, and has been fo ever fince the commencement of the Ramazan ; fuch we are told is the ufage of the Mahometans irr this long faft of one moon : they fuffer no food or drink to enter their lips during the whole day, but, it is laid, moft of them feed heartily in the night. They are glad to fpend that time in fleep, which otherwife would be very tedious to them, and perhaps imagine that by this means they fhall be lefs liable to thofe folicitations ot nature, which their religion teaches them, at this feafon, entirely to relinquifli*. Our * Ramazan, or Ramadan', a folemn feafon of falling among the Mahometans, kept in the ninth month of the Arabic year. This faft confifts in abftaining from meat and drink, and from lying with their wives each day, from the rifing of the fun 'till the ftars appear; and is of fuch ftridl obligation, that none are excufed from it; for the fick, and all others who cannot obferve it in this month, are obliged to faft another entire month inftead of it.. So fuperfti- tious are the Mabomtam in the obfervauce of this lent, that they dare not wafh their mouths,,. J otfit. [ 2 59 ] Our Chocarda however is not of this fcrupulous turn; the quantity of fpirlts and wine he daily drinks, too abundantly declares it. He was fo much off his guard yefterday as to fay, that he would eat even pork or bacon with us; and yet this fellow, when in a pafTion, is always fure to brand his 'Trackers with the infamous appellation of Pork-Eaters. At feven o'clock in the evening, we drew near to Dewana, the capital of the government of Hafca, where refides Aly Aga \ his power commences at H asca. Coma (which ends that of the governor of BaJJhra) and extends up the river, as far as Hilla. The river grows much broader now, and a little higher up, in appeared to be at leaft a mile over. At eight, paffed a large river to the left hand. AU the country about us is neatly cultivated for pafturage, the river being with great care and judgment admitted, or fliut out, agree able to the neceflity of the herdfman. At a little after twelve at night, we anchored at a fmall diftance from Dewana, commonly called (as is the province) Hafca. We got twenty- five miles to-day. At noon the latitude by obfervation was 31° 48' north. At fun rife, which was a quarter paft five, we faluted the governor with fix guns and eight bounces i and agreeable to Mr. Shawns direflion, fent aihore his letter, and our compliments by Mr. Ilemet, the Chocarda, and one of our European fervants. In a little time we learnt, that the governor could not be fpoken with till five o'clock in the evening, upon account of the Ramazan. Cojee Pagoofe, an Armenian merchant of Bajfora, at prefent refiding here, to whom Mr. Shaw wrote a letter in our favour, came on board of us early in the morning, to bid us welcome, and to offer his beft fervices with the governor. He told us, he was confident Aly Aga would give us an honour able reception, but that on account of the Faft it would be impofiible for any perfon to get accefs to him before five in the evening •, that he would put Mr. Shaw's letter into the hands of one of the governor's attendants, who on his mafter's coming out of his room, would be fure to deliver it. He added, that foon after five, he believed we might be fupplied with Trackers and neceflaries in order for our departure, provided we could not be induced to tarry longer; but that he himfelf fhould be happy could he prevail on us to ftay a little while, and receive the civilities the governor would be ready to fhew to Englijhmen. As he verily or even fwallow their fpittle. The men are, indeed, allowed to bathe themfelves, on condi tion they do not plunge the head under water, left fome drops enter by the mouth or ears, &amp;c. But as for the women they are ftridlly forbidden to bathe, &amp;c. However, they frequently feaft all night. The Mahometans call this month holy, and believe that as long as it lafts, the gates of Paradife are open, and thofe of Hell Ihut. Difiiomrj of Art* and Sciences, L 1 2 believed[ 26° ] believed the Caravan would not depart from Baghdad before the fifteenth of the Moon, we refolved to wait, and it was agreed upon between Cojee Pagoofe and us, that at fun-fet, the time Aly Aga was to appear on his Terrace, we would, on the fignal of the merchant's waving his hand that the Aga was there, falute him fiorn our little yacht, which we accordingly did, repeating the falute of the morning. The governor and his numerous attendants, appeared on the houfe-top, a little before the fetting of the fun ; and when it was gotten to the horizon, I obferved that he and all his train, proftrated themfelves in prayer. Soon ■ after they had ended, a meflage came from Aly Aga, congratulating us upon our fafe arrival at Hafca, with afturances of his doing all in his power to forward ourpaffage np the river •, and excufes for having, on account of the ftrift laws of the Faft, kept us fo long without his paying his compliments: concluding with an invitation, to drink coffee with him in the evening. To all this having made our proper acknowledgements, the meffenger added, that the governor would be obliged to deprive himfelf of the plea- fure of our company till late in the evening ^ the reafon afligned was, be- caufe he intended to prefent one of us with a Turhijh vefl:, and as he had ordered that it fhould be a very handfome one, it would require fome hours to make it- Monfieur Hemet, on this occalion, was our interpreter-, and as he had fpent fo much of his time in Perfia, about the court, he knew very well how to a6l for us. He prevailed upon Aly Aga to fend us his great barge, at the time he wiflied us to come, and told him, that we^ere unaccuftomed to fit on the ground though covered with a carpet; the governor replied, that ' we Ihould have cufbions, and was he mafter of chairs, we Ihould be welcome to them adding, that if we chofe to fend our own feats, it would be altogether as agreeable to him. This was a matter of the utmoft indif ference to us, we had no public charafter to maintain, and fhould have been as well pleafed with the cufhion, as the ftool but our old friend would not hear of what he called fuch a conceflion, afluring us, that the chair or the ftool, ' voud he de more honorable we fubmitted, fmiling at each other. An intimation had been given us, that three would be the proper number to wait on this great man ; fuch he really is, his government being the moft important of any in this part of the world, the Bajha of Baghdad ex cepted. It was eleven o'clock before the officer of his houfehold came in the barge to attend us,, though during this time, there had been fent us more than one apology for the delay. As foon as we were landed, the barge faluted us with one gun : Cojee Pagoofe, with many officers, received us, on the fhore, attended with fervants and a number of lights, and they all ac companied us to the governor. We were received on the Terrace', Aly Aga was feated, furrounded by his principal Agas to the number of fifty, drefTed in green or red. At our coming to the carpet, on which the ftools were placed^ we put off our ftioes, which we had flipped down for that purpofe beforemwwaiM ■ ■ ww mmmium w ■ n LTlRTTTT—mW' ' 5 [ 26l ] before we left the veflcl: we were dreffed as Europeans, and on approaching him, we uncovered our heads, and bent our bodies, after our own manner^ he returned our compliments fitting, but gracefully bending his body for wards, putting his right hand upon his breaflr, and then immediately point- ihg to our feats, we fat down, and covered our heads. We fat frontino- him ; on each hand he had an ancient venerable perfon j farther to his right, were in four ranks other officers all fitting, fix or feven in each rank, and to his left were ftill more. Many fervants flood behind us, amoncr them my man Alexander had intruded himfelf, our Chocarda too was obferved to be at this entertainment. Aly Aga addrefled himfelf to us, by the mouth of Cojee Pago ofe and Mr. Hemet •, Pagoofe fpeaking to the latter in Per/tan, and he to us in French, and fometimes in broken EngHJh. Common compliments took place firft, refpecting our health, that of Mr. Skaw, &amp;c. then he afked us of the par ticular incidents of our voyage hitherto, of our intended route, and of our motives for undertaking fo fatiguing and perilous a journey ; he was greatly amazed to find they were not pecuniary ones, but proceeded chiefly from curiofity. He then changed his difcourfe to our company's affairs at Bengal, and the revolutions which had lately happened there; talked of our fleet in India, of the feveral powers at war in Europe, and of the face of affairs there at prefent •, and at laft, of the navigation up the river Euphrates, of the latitude of Bajfora, Dewana, &amp;c. During this converfation we were enter tained, firft, with a faucer of fweetmeats, of which fome of us eat four or five very fmall fpoonfuls, and intended to have finifhed the whole, but Monfieur whifpered to leave off, ' for dat one fpoonful only, was de more polite j' then a fmall cup of coffee was brought, and after a fhort in terval a fmall bafon of warm fweet water fcented with rofes ; laftly, our handkerchiefs were wetted with rofe-water, and our noftrils fumigated with the fmoke of Amhergreafe and Agala wood. We had been given to under- Hand, that foon after the ferving of the fweet water and odours, we fhould be at liberty to take our leave on our making a motion to do this, Aly Aga repeated to us, how forry he was the folemnity of the Ramazan deprived him of the pleafure of our company by day; but that, if convenient to us, he fhould be happy, would we continue here for a few days to recover from our fatigue, and he would endeavour to make us pafs the time as agreeably as was in his power. We excufed ourfelves from accepting his kind invitation, by informing him of the neceflity we were under to reach Baghdad as foon as poflible and that we had an additional mo tive to haften our journey, which was the earneft defire of feeing our native country, and our families, from whom we had fuffered a long and painful feparation. His anfwer implied, that he fincerely wifhed us a happy fight of both, hoped our journey and voyage would be as pleafant and fpeedy as poffible, and that the Great God would condudl us fafe. We expreffed in the befl terms we were able, our fenfe of his favors ; to which he replied very fenfibly and politely.. As foon as we got from our feats^ Mr,I75S. \ — I ' 111^ May iz. [ 262 ] Mr. JDoidge, our elecfled chief, had a filk Pelife or veil put upon him, lined with Ermine, worth about ten pounds, for which he made one of hishand- fomeft bows to Aly Aga. Our vifit lafted about half an hour, when we all took leave, and repaired to the barge, and in her to the yacht: the barge fired another gun at our getting on board. Pago ofe and the fame officer of the houfehold who had attended us before, now accompanied us to our cabbin. We drank before them Aly Aga's health, and fired a gun. Between twelve and one both thefe gentlemen left us, by whom we fent on fiiore ten fequins, or about five guineas, to the treafurer, to be divided among the governor's fervants. We detained them for a while, purpofely to give Mr. Doidge an oppor tunity of finifhing his letter to Mr. Shaw, to whom we were obliged to write, having this day, by the advice of Cojee Pagcofe, difmifTed Mr. Cho- carda, for a repetition of his infolence, without making him the lead prefent. We had painted his behaviour in its true colours in our letter to Mr. Shaw but at Aly Aga's requcft we added a poflxript by way of mitigation; this llrange inconliftent tellow having thrown himfelf at the feet of that gover nor, begging his interceffion with us to write as little to his prejudice as poffible. Before Cojee Pagoofe left our veflel, we defired him to tell us, what was the occafion of the hearty laugh, which we obferved had taken place whilft Aly Aga was making his enquiries; he acquainted us that the old gentleman who fat on the governor's right hand, affeded to be a judge of what Me firs. Doidge and Alms were telling Aly Aga regarding the latitude and longitude of places, and frequently threw in his approbation by fay- ing ' Aye ihafs true:'''' the laugh arofe from the governor's merrily reply ing, ' I do not doubt of the truth of what thefe gentlemen advance, and to be fure you are an accurate judge of it; for the utmoft of your erudition in this way, is I think confined to the latitude and longitude of my Perfon; that indeed, you are pretty well acquainted with.' Aly Aga is a native of Perfia^ and a man of a more inquifitive turn than is commonly found (as we were told) among the Turkijh governors. . Dwrna-, which by our obfervations lies in the latitude 31 0 56'north, i6 a confiderable town, built with mud; the governor is obliged to pay into the trealury of the Bajha ot Baghdad, fifteen hundred purfes yearly, it being the Hated royal rent of the diftrid; but I am well informed that Aly Aga remits at leaft three thoufand purfes; this additional fum is acquired by mulefts on the Arabs for different crimes, efpecially for rob beries 1 he fines are commonly paid in cattle by the Sheicks, but the Turks loon turn them into calh. This conduft ol Aly Aga in remitting more to the royal treafury than is required Irom him, appears a very extraordinary circumftance at firft fight; but[ 263 ] but it is truly a moft refined ftroke of policy : for knowing that immenfe riches in this country are the fureft means to fhorten a man's days, he puts himfelf out of all danger by never prefuming to accumulate them for his own ufe. He is rather ftudious to be thought the generous and difin- tereiled, than the rich and opulent man. Doubtlefs, it is entirely owin^ to this, that he is fo great a favourite with the Bajha of Baghdad, whole purfe he takes care to fill, though he finds it prudent to negiea; his own. Mr. Shaw told me at Baffora, the particulars of a difpute between him and Aly Aga when governor of that place, for which the latter was difplaced, and but of late appointed to the command at Hafca. He has fince acknow ledged, that he injured Mr. Shaw^ and made all proper concefTions to him. They had now entered into a friendly correfpondence, and a new branch of trade-, which it is hoped will prove advantageous to the company, and be of fervice likewife to this generous, genteel, worthy man, whofe common emolurr ents are judged inadequate to his fpirit and deferts. At half paft eight, we weighed, and took our laft leave of Aly Aga^ with the difcharge of all our guns; our bounces being expended in the unex- pefted fecond falute of yefterday, we could not carry the compliment any farther; Cojee Pagoofe undertook to apologize for us on this head. Here, two of the Lafcars or feamen belonging to our Sandal ran away; Vertan got two perfons in their room, one of whom foon left us alfo : this fervant had now the charge of that veflel fince the difmiffion of the Chocarda and his adherents, of whom we were now told there were three or four. At eleven we crofled the river, and began to track on the left hand fide,. The land in view is partly pafture, partly arable, the cattle continue the fame as lately mentioned, but horfes are more numerous. We obferved one of the latter fwimming acrofs the river, with a fervant. This horfe (by our information) was defigned as a prefent to us, had not Cojee Pagoofe difcovered that we had already a fufficient number, and that a habit would be more acceptable. At twelve we ftopt for our luggage-boat, and at half paft one begare again to track; at fix in the afternoon pafled a fort to the right called Monoly. The wind is ftill againft us, and the ftream runs down at the rate of five miles an hour, which, joined to our delays from the Sandal, prevent our making but a very flow progrefs. At half paft eight, the Trackers called to leave off work, the bottom being now bad, the banks bufhy, and they themfelves in fear of lions, tygers, and other wild beafts. We took the men on board, and ftood off into the ftream to avoid infults from the people on lliore, but were obliged to return to the bank on account of the rapidity of the river. If we could have lain at a diftance from the fhore, we lh6uld have been more at eafe in all refpeds ^ particularly from thofe 7 bittes[ 264 ] 175S. bitter enemies the Mufchetos, which peftered us this evening, rather more y. J than ever, and are inexpreflibly tormenting, even to the degree of throwing us into a temporary fever. Happy for us! that with the return of the fun and wind in the mornings, we are till the clofe of the day relieved from them, and without this interval, 1 know not^ what might be the confe- quence ; the fun is our great deliverer in this refpeft but alas! the increaf- ing heat of that glorious body begins to make us lament, our being no farther advanced on our journey ; but as we have no reafon to charge our- felves with the leaft unnecefTary delay, we endeavour to be fatisfied, and bear what may happen with becoming resolution. We made but eight miles to-day; latitude by obfervation 31 0 58'. May 13.- At half paft four this morning we began to track; at five we crofled to the right fide of the river, in hopes that the footing and current would be more favourable ; at eleven crolted again, the current being fo ftrong, that we could not turn a point of land. At one in the afternoon, flopped for the luggage-boat. At half paft two went on again, the Sandal being in fight. At fix anchored for the night at fome diftance from the fhore. A little before feven, we were faluted to our great furprize with the thunder ing voice of our late Chocarda, who in a fmall boat pafied by us and com manded our fervants to deliver us his compliments. We conclude that he is going on his own private affairs to Baghdad, or perhaps to execute there fome orders from his governor. The banks are now covered with a ftirub of the cyprefs kind; bramble- bufhes and fome other fhrubs make a fort of foreft, well fupplied with a variety of finging birds; fome of them chaunt all the night: there are great quantities of wild ducks. Got eleven miles. Latitude by obferva tion 32 0 4 north. This night we took into ferious confideration, the very little progrefs we had made, and the fmall portion of time we have to fpare, as the Caravan by all accounts will fet out the fifteenth of the Moon ; and unanimoufly refolved, for greater expedition to move ourfelves and all we have on board the yacht, into the Sandal, where are our horfes, &amp;c. and with our ten Trackers to join her's, that by their united force, we may haften her motion, which is at prefent very flow. Kay 14. Agreeable to this refolution, a little after four this morning, we dropped down with the ftream, and joined her ; by eight we difmiffed the yacht, with a letter for Mr. Shaw, telling him of the ftep we had taken, and of our having borrowed her fore-topfail, to make us a cover in the Sandal from the fun. At fix in the evening, we pafled the tomb of a reli^ gious perfon to the left: a little afterwards a human body floated by us, which probably had been drowned by the overfetting of a Sandal. This greatly alarmed our Trackers, who fay, that accidents of this kind | y fifip ' 7 havenlno'. tC [ 265 ] have frequently happened, and pofitively declared, that they would not proceed any farther during the night, for fear of meeting with the like fate. At half paft feven therefore, though a fine moon-light evening, we made our veffel fad to a (lake fixed on the fhore; we got our camp- table and ftools out, and for the firft time eat our morfels on the edee of the Defert. * 'We faw to-day many ducks and one pelican ; the banks are very woody, ©r rather bufliy; few people live hereabouts, only juft as many as are necef- fary to take care of their buffaloes, which are numerousi This morning a woman fwam acrols the river, which here was eight hundred yards wide, pufhing a balket before her. Mr. Alms (hot a turtle with a ball, but our fervants told us, it would not be fafe to eat of it. We kept all night a regular watch. Another fmall tracking boat rode near our vefiel, bound to Hilla, with three or four women, and perhaps twenty men they had two or three muflcets among them, and as many brace of piftols: at their coming to the fhore, they difcharged two loaded mufkets, in order to let the robbers know they were not unarmed, or off their guard.—Ad vanced 12 miles to-day. No obfervation. At half after four in the morning, we began to track, the river very ferpentine and rapid: continued working till nine at night, when we made faft to the fhore, got our flools and table afhore, and kept a flrid guard all night. Two or three Arabs with lances, came and made a great noife, and called in their cattle as if they were apprehenfive of lofing them; we let them know, they had nothing to fear from us, unlefs they fhould become troublefome themfelves •, and on ordering them to go away, they complied. Got twenty-one miles to-day. Latitude by obfervation 32 0 16' north. At half pafl four in the morning, began to track. At eight pafled a village called AJfca, with mud houfes, encompafTed with a mud wall; many Bate and other fruit trees about it. On the oppofite fide of the river is another village, and a pleafant garden, called Tffidea. At eleven paffed a village to the right called Vena-haara, where is always a guard of foldiers: foon after, paflfed another village on the fame fide, built of mud, named Zada ; the river water here, is fomewhat cleaner than heretofore. At one in the afternoon, went by two villages on the right, one called Chili, the other Dulab \ and at two came in fight of Htlla. Soon after, we paffed a river on our left called Romya, which at this place difcharges itfelf into the Euphrates. A little before four o'clock we got up pretty near to the governor of Hula's palace, fituated in that part of the town which (lands on the left, or fouth fide of the river. Our Sandal carrying no guns, we could only falute with five bounces, their report however was equal to that of a four pounder. M m We Mondav, May 15. May 16. Assca. IsSIDEA. Vena- haara; Zada. Chili. Dulab.[ 266 ] We were foon furronnded by a very numerous company of people, of boys efpecially ; even the women, who came down to the river with their pitchers for water, fatisfied their curiofity by looking at us; moft of them had their faces half covered, many were comely, and of a pretty eood complexion. The men in general were well made, fome are white,^but moft of them tawny. We had been but a very little while near the fhore, before one of the governor's officers came to bid us welcome- lie iat with us on a ftool by the fide of the river, and took care the crowd fhould not prefs upon us. In the mean time we fent by Mr. Hemet, and our man Vertan, Mr. Shaw's letter, and another from Aly A?a ^ they foon returned with the governor's compliments, and an invitation for us to repair to the Seraglio-, an officer with a filver and high cap came alfo to condud us. Notwithftanding it was the faft of the Ramazan, and before fun-fet, we- found the governor, Chouder Aga, feated on a carpet in his porch, at the entiance of his palace, ready to receive us; (he was about forty years old , and of the genteeleft deportment) he bade us heartily welcome, thrice; told us we fhould do him honour by taking up our abode at his houfe, expreffed his unfeigned forrow at the fatigues and difficulties we had paffed through, of which he faid he had been informed three days ago, hoped we mould reft well under his roof, and recover our loft ftrength, and that we might depend on every affiftance in his power. At our firft coming in, he obliged us immediately to feat ourfelves on the fide of the porch, oppofite to him, where had been placed a carpet and cufliions. The rules of the fait, were frill farther dilpenfed with, for coffee was brought to us, as foon as we were feated. In the courfe of the interview, he faid, as every people had their different manners, and he could not but be a ftranser to our's, he muft defire the favour of us, while we continued with him, to purfue our own inclinations in all things, but efpecially in what refpeded refremments i he fliould therefore be glad if we would trouble ourfelves to dnect his domeftics what fort of repaft they fhould provide for our upper. We replied to his civilities, but begged we might be admitted to be ierved only with a plate of what was the ufual provifions of his family: upon his repeating his wifhes, we anfwered, ' nothing could be more accept able than a common Pillaw' (boiled fowl and rice). We begged indeed the- ravour of being accommodated with a warm Bagnio, which he immediately ordered to be got ready, and direded his attendants to be there in waiting with Sherbet, dV; but before we went to the bath, he ordered his people to fliow us the apartments that were provided for us above ftairs. We then took our leave each paying the other the moft obliging compliments they could think of; but the Turk was very much our fuperior in this fort of converfation. Our rooms were the beft in the palace, lofty, with painted walls, and go *5 alx ' iecl roofs ' We were accompanied to and from the Bagmo, by an officer carry,ng a filver-headed ftaff. At our return to the Seraglti we[ 267 ] we found fix or eight diflies placed upon our own table, with our ftools fet rdund it; and though the whole was drefied after the Turkijh manner, it was by no means difagreeable to an Englijh palate. An intimation was alfo given to us, that the-governor made it his particular requeft, that in regard to our liquors, we would be quite free and unreftrained. This was carrying his complaifance to a great height, confidering how very ftridl the regular Turks are on this article : we doubted at firft, whether we fhould fend for wine, but the governor having interrogated our domeftics, and learned our common pradice, repeated his requeft by a meflage fent on purpofe. Chouder Aga whiift we were at fupper, fat on a terrace at fome diflance with feveral of his principal officers: his treafurer accompanied us the whole evening, who eat, and would have drank wine with us alfo (as he whifpered to our interpreter) had he not been furrounded by many obfervers, who were aflembled to remark our cuftoms. At this repaft, both before and after fup per v/e were careful to fay grace ; the Turks thought it a very odd cuftom, I believe, for they talked to one another about it a good deal. We fat with out hats while at our meal, and the treafurer, who feemed to have fome drollery, after we became a little familiar with one another, pulled off his IT urban and fat uncovered too; this afforded great merriment to the fpeftators, and they all feemed greatly pleafed with our manner of eating, fo different from their own, for they never make ufe of knives and forks, chairs or tables. Soon after the cloth was taken away, a melfenger came for the treafurer; he went, but prefently returned with the governor's refpedls and a mef- fage, importing, that ' as it was his real wilh, we fliould be gay, and ufe his houfe as our own, and as it was probable his prefence might be a re-^ ftraint upon us; he therefore had taken the liberty (begging our pardon at the fame time) to withdraw hirrifelf to the Mufti's, merely to convince us, that what he had faid about our being free and unreftrained, proceeded from the very bottom of hni heart, and he flattered himfelf, that we would difplay our belief of his fincerity, by our adions.' Upon receiving this meffage, the bottle paffed about very brilkly; the governor's health was drank, and a chorus fong was fung. Among the lookers on, were two young gentlemen, fon and nephew to the governor, and for each of them a glafs of wine was ftolen, which they drank off in a private room. We had before this time, given in by an Aga, an inventory of fuch things as were neceffary for our journey to Baghdad-, and the treafurer at his taking leave this evening, told us, that our beafts, provifions, guards, &amp;c. fhould be ready for us as foon as poffible in the morning; for though the governor had given us the moft preffing invitation to fpend a few days With him, yet we excufed ourfelves upon account of the hurry we were in, and the neceffity there was for our getting forwards. It was five in the afternoon before our beafts were loaded, and we ready to begin our journey. We had very handfome provifion made, boj:h175%- [ 26,8 ] for our breakfaft and dinner; and, in the morning, on the fuppofition W e Ihould have gone earlier than we did, the governor again broke in on the rules of the Faft^ and feated himfelf in his porch, with a defign of givino- us an opportunity of taking our leave. Our whole party attended him except myfelf who was greatly indifpofed ; but I afterwards learnt from them, that they were as much outdone in hyperbole of compliment at this lecond, as we all had been at our firR interview. The whole of our hoft's behaviour was fuch, as greatly to prejudice us in his favour, and we wanted only a proper prefent to fend him, as a grateful acknowledge ment for his favours. We could not offer him money, confident with the inllrudions Mr. Sjoaw had given us, and of every thing elfe.that was valu able we had,ftnpped ourfelves ztKarec. At laft our good friend Mr. Hemek fpared us a white Shml, made of fine goats hair from Carminm, and worn much in habits by the Turks of failiion ; it's value, was about fixteen zechins eight guineas: this, with an hanclfome apology, was fent by one of his domeftics, who foon returned with his, matter's compliments, and That he hoped we were convinced, the trifling fervices which he had ' done us, proceeded altogether from the refpefl, he had for our cha- ' raders, and from his friendfhip to Mr. Shaw ; thefe were his only mo tives, for endeavouring to become ufeful to us in our long and wead-• fome journey ; that he had done nothing with an interefted view, and he ' flattered himfelf we would do him the juftice to believe it; that the. prefent which we had been fo kind as to make him, with fuch an obliging M apology, was th? more acceptable to him, as it was greatly expreffive ' of our fatisfaftion in his conduct: that he made not the leaft difficulty. ' therefore in accepting of, and was infinitely obliged to us for it.' Such was the complaifant and polite behaviour of this Turkijh governor, which, to fay the leafi', did honour not only to himfelf, but to his country. At five this afternoon, we crofled the Euphrates on a bridge of 'about 38 - boats, attended by fiye Turkijh cavalry, taking our route for Baghdad. We, made up a little Caravan of fifteen camels, thirteen horfemen well armed, fix mules and afles, befides our proper fervants. Soon after leaving the town of Hilla. (which is pretty large, but bad buildings, and fituated. on both fides of the river), we came upon a fandy plain, and travelled a „ north-weft courfe, meeting in our way feveral hot blafts from the Defert: at ten o'clock we arrived at a poor village called Mahoul-Kaury^ about , twelve miles Irom Hilld ; but being told the houfes were dirty, and full of vermin, we fpread our carpets and bedding on the ground ; trufting to. the clouded canopy of heaven, while the, foldiers kept a good look-out. The ; wind blew trefh the greateft part of the night, and as there were hills of, land very near us, accumulated by the winds of the neighbouring Defevt, our bedding was well covered with it. When I rofe in the morning, I was grtatly diftrefTed with thirft, pain in the bowels, and a bilious T)iarrhcea for tunately, we got here lome good milk, both at night, and in the^moxn- yig, - 0 • 4. ' - At:May 18. Efcandreaa Caravaa- .ferah. [ 269 ] At half paft five this morning, we refumed our march, the wind blowing frefh and cold ; we travelled at the rate of near three miles an hour, and at ten reached the Caravan ferah of Efcandreaw, a ftrudure eredled for the convenience of all travellers*: but our guards would not lei us enter, it was fo filthy, they therefore fpread carpets for us in a poor man's houfe juft oppofire to it, and there we lay down to reft. Our camels, fervants, and baggage, which had been hitherto behind, but with orders to go on, paffed us about eleven and at twelve at noon, we were called upon to follow them : but finding on enquiry, that they went no farther this evening than the - next ftage, where they would continue till midnight, and that we could eafily overtake them, we determined to tarry here, until the heat of the day - was over; and fent all but,one of our Turkijh foldiers, as an' efcort to the- baggage. At a little before four in the-afternoon, we mounted ; a quarter after fix, came up with our camels, which had been put into a large Caravanferah at Horta Cara- the entrance of Horta^ a fmali miferable village, with only five or fix poor -vanferah. families in it. This public place of reft, for travellers was in very good order, and large enough to receive five hundred men, befides a great many • beafts. The man in waiting at the Caravanferah, fupplied us with ftraw and water for our cattle ; the water is not good, therefore travellers always bring feme with them for their own ufe, as we did. I got fome goats milk here, which was very acceptable, not having been able to eat any thing but milk, fince the firft evening we were at Hilla. I was much harraflfed to-day with a Dyfentery, attended with thirft. Our courfe from Efcandreau to this Caravanferah has been about N. E. We pafled many travellers; the road is broad and good, the country flat, and hath many paths or tracks of camels, &amp;c. but no cultivation in fight. This is faid, and fup- pofed to be the plain in the land of Shinar, where Babylon once flood. We f walked up to a little eminence, where we faw a vaft quantity of broken- bricks and .fome cement,.. We met with an uncommon field-moufe here of a very light-grey colour,'■ its feet much longer than the feet of our mice, with a fmall long tail, ending broad, and forked like a trident: feveral of our company endeavour ed to catch it, butrthe creature was fo fleet and quick in it's turnings, that 1 it efcaped them, and hid itfelf in a hole in the ground. This road indeed, abounds in holes, and about them are a great many green birds, in fize and make like a fwailow : I firft thought, that in thele little burrows, thofe- * ** The eaftern nations feem always to have had a peculiar difpofkion to the offices of hu manity. Their manner of keeping houfe was generally near a highway, purpofely for the relieving of travellers; the patriarchs in the Old Tel^ament fit at their gates to fee thofe who pafs by, and entreat them to enter into their houfes. This cordial manner of invitation is particu larly defcribed in the 18th and 19th chapter of Genejis. It is yet a piece of charity frequent with the lurh to eredt Caravan/erahs or inns for the reception of travellers.' Pope's Nates on Homer's Iliad, Book vi.

There is a fhrub here of about two feet high, the leaves of which in make and tafte are like the famphire ; alfo a Imaller fhrub which produces cotton. We travelled about 20 miles to-day : courfe N. h E, At one in the morning, we rofe, and began to pack up our bedding; the camels that carried the other baggage, had been loaded by our fervants about midnight: At two, we fet out in company with fome additional Arabs and Turksy who with their loaded mules and affes, took up their lodg ing lait night, within the fame hofpitable walls. At five we reached another Caravanferah in the village of Azaup here we got coffee, and two quarts ot good milk warm from the goats : this morning, the air was fo fharp, that I was glad to exchange my Camaline with Jenkins^ for his thick Huffar cloak. At this place we found a fire ready to make our coffee, and were refrefhed by (landing before it. Here, one of my friends was greatly hurt, by feeing one or two pretty women employed like horfes or affes (as he in his tendernefs exprefled it) drawing water from a well; though even in England^ we often fee offices equally laborious and much 1 more fervile, performed by women. Befides, the drawing of water in all ages, and over all Afia^ appears to have been the bufinefs of women •, Homer fpeaks of princefTes drawing water from fprings, and waftiing with their own hands, the linnen of their refpedlive families. We know that the woman of Samaria^ who met Jeftis at Jacob's well, came upon this very errand, and we have not the leaft intimation given us that it was deemed an hard- fhip. But if the female is fo bad off in this country, hard alfo is the def- tiny of the poor Trackers! who, exclufive of the continual fears they are under of being devoured by lions and other wild beafts, muft drag like horfes, through briars, builies, water, mud, ruflies, &amp;c. and this too in the coldeft feafon, and the darkeft night. Such is really their cafe, and there is no pofllbility ot avoiding it, efpecially when they are in the fervice of a Turhjh galley. We did not tarry above half an hour at this Caravanferah) but proceeded on after our camels ; about this village the country is pleafant, we faw a great deal of wheat growing, and large numbers of cattle grazing. About iix^we difcovered the Minarets of the Mofques in Baghdad) whofe ftile of building is not much unlike the monument at London. For a few miles, on both fides of the road, were many flocks of fheep, herds of goats, and other cattle, as well as large fpots bearing wheat; the foil all along is good, and wants only a little induflry to cultivate and improve it. The diftance between the Tygris and Euphrates here, we were told, is not more than fix or feven miles, confequently by letting in the water from thofe two rivers, the whole might be made extremely fruitful.[ 271 J fruitful. For many miies back, a plain open country fee^an, and flill continues gently to afcend, forming a hanging level, the higheft pare beinp towards Baghdad. At feven we took notice of a building to our left; and having been before apprifed of it's fituation, we had no difficulty in deter mining it to be, what here paffes for the ruins of the tower of Bah el By the alfiftance of an interpreter, I queftioned our TurkiJJj foldiers on this fubjed, who anfwered it was Nimrod\ tower. They faid alfo, upon my pretending to know nothing of Nimrod, that he was once a king of the country, but long before their Prophet or our Prophefs time ^that he declared war againft the God of heaven, and in his foolifhnefs and pride, built this tower, with iatention to get to heaven, and make war with the Almighty: but he found himfelf deceived^ for God confounded him and his machinations, by rending the building with the breath of his mouth; and that this ruin had been permitted to remain as a lading monument of the folly of man^ and of the power of God. We queftioned the foldiers alfo about the confufion of languages, but of that they appeared to be to tally ignorant; concluding however that we might have all our enquiries anfwered by thole who were acquainted with the old Per fan books, where all the particulars of this remarkable ftory were fully related. At about a league diftance from the city we obferved an handfome large green tent, with two fmall ones; as we drew nigher to them, two Turks mounted on very handfome light grey horfes, richly caparifoned, rode to wards us full fpeed, jfhewing their dexterity in the Gereed. Upon their coming near us, they flopped, made their Salaam^ and gave Us to under- fiand, that they came from thofe tents, and were in the fervice of Mr. Garden and Cojee Raphael, by whom they were ordered to wait there for our reception. We rode towards the tents, difmounted, and entered the largeft, the ground of which was covered with a carpet. An Argile or fmoking tube, and coffee, were immediately brought us, and one of the ftirks galloped towards the town to inform his mafters of our arrival, but both the gentlemen appeared very foon, and on their coming into the tent, were fo obliging as to make many apologies for their abfence at our alight ing, it having been entirely owing to an accident they met with upon the road. It was lucky for us that Mr. Boidge difpatched a letter to Mr. Garden from Hafca, otherwife he would before now have left Baghdad, and been on his way to Bajfora. He appears to be an accomplifhed young gentleman, and had been a writer in the company's fervice at Bombay ; was lately appointed fecond at Baffora, and is at prefent engaged in bufinefs of confequence at Baghdad. Cojee Raphael is an Armenian merchant, a chrif- tian, who with many others of his religion, and profeffion, was, obliged to retire from Perfia, on account of it's troubles: in Mr. Garden's abfence, this gentleman tranfafts all the bufinefs with the Bajha and the merchants here, on account of Mr. Shaw, Thefe two gentlemen, after haying received us.[ 272 0 in the moil hofpitabic manner, perfuaded us to fpend the heat of the day in the tent, which was placed clofe to the edge of the river Tygris: we did, and except myfelf (who was too ill ro partake of any thing but milk) all were merry, and dined very comfortably on the carpet, where was ^placed an excellent cold entertainment. By the advice of thefe gentlemen, our party dripped themfelves of their 'Turbans, and every part of their country drefs, and put on hats and other European habits. Now a little of the finery fent back to Bombay from Karec, was wifhed for. I was apprehenfive of catching cold, and therefore rode towards the,city with my HuJ]'ar-c\oak and Turban, Before we got to Baghdad, we palTed over a creek on a ftone bridge of four or five arches; very many were the fpectators here, and much their furprize, on feeing fo many Frengees, or Franks, (the general name throughout all Turky for Europeans) and by the plealure which appeared in the countenance of the boys, it feemed they had never been fo agreeably entertained before. The hat, the hair differently drefTed, wig, coat, and every part of our habits .and accoutrements, even the horfe-whip and European faddles, were all mat ters of curiofity to men as well as boys ; and yet not the leaft kind of in civility pafTed from any one of them. Such a number were never feen here before in European drefTes, for the few who tarry any length of time, put themfelves into the Turkijh habit; but this would have been very im prudent in us, on account of our fhort ftay, and of the great expencej two complete and genteel fuits would not have coft lefs than near an hundred pounds. From the want of them however we are to be in a manner prifoners, for our polite countryman Mr. Garden would not have us degrade the Englijh name (which is here in high repute) by going into the ftreets on toot, and our horfe-furniture at prefent is much too mean to appear with; fo that only one or two of us at moft can go out properly mounted at a time, that is, with managed horfes, gayly capari- foned with trappings of gold or filver all over their heads and crefts, very rich laced or embroidered faddle cloths, gilt or filver flirrups, &amp;c. &amp;c. The Turk never rides with a whip, he either has a flick for gerceding, or fpear for adual war About * The Gtreedls an exercife, which con lifts in a man's dextroufly throwing a lance at an an- tagonift, and avoiding at the fame time that thrown againft himfelf. This is always done on horfe-back, and at full fpeed, the rider throwing himfelf, when in danger, under the horfe's belly, or under the cover ot his fide,-ever keeping himfelf from falling, by an expert ufe of the foot which is Hill retained in one of the (Hrrups, and by taking hold with his hands of the horfe s mane, the girth, or fome other part of the faddle furniture. As foon as he finds that he has eluded his adverfary's lance, he throws himfelf upon the horfe's back again, and rides after the weapon, which juft before had been direiled at him. This he contrives to fnatch from off the ground, even while his horfe is in full career, and then in his turn pur- lues and attacks his enemy with it. Thus the combat continues, until one or other is ftruck, and fuppofed to be killed, wounded, or taken prifoner. When this manoeuvre is only performed in fport, they make ufe of a ftick, inftead of a lance. It is the Twri/principal mar tial exercife, and they greatly pride themfelves in doing it expertly. Their horfes are in com mon,[ 273 ] About five in the evening, we entered the old town, or that which lies weft of the Tygns. We paffed the river by a bridge of thirty-nine boats floored with Date trees, flags, horfe-dung, and flime or mud • it is very badly railed. This bridge brought us to the new city, on the'eaft of the river. Both cities are built with bricks, and mud ; this on the eaft fide is walled round. The public buildings are better than thole of but the beft would be efteemed unfit for a private gentleman of a thoufand pounds a year in England. The ftreets are very narrow, the Bazars lontr generally roofed m the gothic tafte, but fome which have been lately re paired or rebuilt, are only clumfily covered with Date trees, and mud : holes are left in the roof at certain diftances, for the admittance of light and air At fix we got to Mr. Garden's houfe. Soon after, I drank fome milk, and * went to bed, not a little fatigued.

TO our great mortification the Aleppo Caravan had left Baghdad twenty days before our arrival. This was a melancholy piece of news to every one of us, but efpecially to me, on account of my ill ftate of health. The weather was already too warm, and the prolpedl before us of waiting ftill longer before we could begin our journey over the Defert, could not fail to make us very uneafy. Our old friend Mr. Hemet ufed his utmoft endeavours to prevail upon me not to leave this place till the month of Otto- her *, he urged my prefent bad ftate of health, the increafing heat of the wea ther, but above all the danger of our meeting with thofe noxious blafts, cal led in the Arabian language Samiels *, hot and fudden gufts of wind, to which travellers are expofed in pafling the Defert of Arabia ; by fome fuppofed to be the deftruflive Kafi Wind mentioned in fob, and fome of the Fro- phets. They fometimes blow about the middle of June, but more frequently in the months of July and Auguft, when they commonly bring inftantaneous death to every man and beaft that happens to (land with his face towards them. Providentially, a certain though fhort warning of their approach is given, by a fenfible alteration of the air. When this is per ceived, all travellers, together with their horfes, camels, &amp;c. muft, as the only means of fafety lie proftrate with their faces to the ground, and their feet towards the S ami el, and thus continue till it is pafled. This peftilential vapour flies fwift, and commonly does not expand itfelf far; it's ftreams are of no great breadth, fo that travellers at a few miles diftance from each other are expofed to different Samiels, and fome are fo fortunate as entirely to efcape them*. This T . h ^, hot w ^ n( l&gt; peculiar to the Defert of Arabia, is called in the Arabian language, Sa- iniel: it blows over the Defert in the months of July and AuguJ}, from the N. W. quarter, and tomstimes k continues with all, it's violence th^ very gates of Baghdad) but never affefts any[ 2 7S] This morning we were vlfited by many Jew, Armenian and Italian mer chants ; our future journey naturally became the fubjea: of converfation, and there were as many different opinions as there were men ; however, all agreed with Mr. Hemet, that unlefs we could fet off at fartheft, by the mid dle of June, we muft find the Befert extremely diftreffing, and very dan gerous. One or two propofed our going by the way of Moful and JDiarhekir from which laft place we might eafily get either to Aleppo or Conftanti- nople. They told us, it was almoft certain, that at Moful we ftiould join the great Caravan, which left Baghdad about three weeks ago for that city, Diarbekir^ and Tocat, but would be obliged to wait at Moful twenty days: they propofed we ffiould make it known that we were to take that route, as the merchants would gladly embrace the opportunity, and fit out a Caravan to join us, and thereby we fhould mutually ftrengthen and affift each other. We objefted, that this would be a tedious method ; they re plied, that we might travel by ourfelves, and with entire fafety, pro vided we took the Bafha\ paffport with us, and a proper officer to fee that the orders contained in it were put in execution. The Italian merchant Michael, affured us that travelling thus, we might reach Confiantinople, or, as the Turks all it, Stamboul, in thirty-five days. The thoughts of avoiding any body within the walls. Some years it does not blow at all, and in others, it appears fix, eight, or ten times, but feldom continues more than a few minutes at a time. It often palTes with the apparent quicknefs of lightning. The Arabians and Perftans, who are acquainted with the appearance of the flcy, at or near the time this wind arifeth, have warning of it's approach by a thick haze, which appears like a cloud of dull arifing out of the horizon ; and they immediately upon this appearance, throw themfelves, with their faces to the ground, and continue in that pofition till the wind is pafled, which frequently happens almoft inftantaneous; but if, on the contrary, they arc not careful or briflc enough to take this precaution, which is fometimes the cafe, and they get the full force of the wind, it is inftant death. The above method is the only one which they take to avoid the effefls of this fatal blafl; and when it is over, they get up and look round them for their companions, and, if they fee any one lying motionlefs, they take hold of an arm or leg, and pull and jerk it with fome force ; and if the limb thus agitated feparates from the body, it is a certain fign that the wind has had it's full etFed ; but if, on the contrary, the arm or leg does not come away, it is ~a fure fign there is life remaining, although to every outward appearance the perfon is dead ; and in that cafe, they immediately cover him or them with cloaths, and adminifter fome warm diluting liquor to caufe a perfpiration, which is certainly, but flowly brought about. The Arabs themfelves can fay little or nothing about the nature of this wind, only that it always leaves behind it a very llrong fulphureous fmell, and that the air at thefe times is quite clear, except about the horizon, in the N, W. quarter, before obferved, which gives warning of it's approach, I 'have'not been able to learn whether the dead bodies are fcorched, or diffolved into a kind of gelatinous fubllance ; but from the (lories I have heard, there has been frequent reafon to believe the latter; and in that cafe, I Ihould attribute fuch fatal efFeds rather to a noxious va pour, than to an abfolute and exceffive heat. The ilory of it 's going to the gates of Baghdad and no farther, may be reafonably enough accounted for, if the effects are attributed to a poi- fonous vapour, and not an exceffive heat. f The above- mentioned wind, Samiel, is fo well known in the neighbourhood of Baghdad and J&amp;ajfora, that the very children fpeak of it with dread. , a r j* Letter from an officer in the fewice of the tait India company to friend in London-, Annual Regifter, 1766. » N n 2[ 2-6 ] iheDefert, and feeing the metropolis of the Ottoman empire, were circumftances very flattering to us: with avidity we adopted the propofal, but our pleafure was of Ihort duration ! others politively declaring, that the country through which we were to pafe, was ftill in the utmoft diftrefs for want of provifions • that a fatal ficknefs had taken place in confequence of the famine; befides which, there was at prefent a civil war in and the whole country about it extremely infefted with robbers from the Sanjac mountains there fore it would be impradicable to travel without a large Caravan. After a calculation of time had been made, it appeared that it would take two months before we could reach Stamhoul, fo the fcheme of Michael dropped. Two reverend fathers.

We therefore haflened to vifit the biihop, in hopes he would be able to help us to fix on fome decifive method. We found him a lively, well-bred, fenfible man, be tween nity and iixty years of age; very communicative, wilhing to advife u$ ior the beft, but open enough to declare, he hardly knew how. He men tioned a common laying in France, Be relates to marriages,or journies, and then faid, notwithftanding the prudence ot the maxim in general, in the prefent cafe he would deliver his fenti- ments with all freedom. He told us a piece of news juft come to town, ot a Caravan haying been robbed between Moful and ; he ex- prefled his apprehenfions of the rifle we (hould run from the heat, and the pefliferous wind of the Defert, provided we did not fet out by the tenth or twelfth of next month at fartheft; but feemed to think, that if we could get away by that time, and would be at the expence of litters, or as they are called here Takht Revans, or moving thrones, we might perform our journey without any great degree of danger or fatigue.

The Arab conduflor of the intended expedition, whofe name is Hahil Swylem, was alfo with us this morning, and promifed to fet off with his little Caravan in eight days at fartheft, as the Jew's goods were daily ex pected from Bajfora. We had a great deal of converfation, and at latt, by the afliftance of iVIr, Garden^ llruck a bargain with him on the following conditions. • Five Camels for the carriage of ftores in twenty-one balkets. Four Camels for fourteen portmanteaus, three of which arc common Englijh ones, the others are made of canvas, with our bedding, linen, and' a tent. Six Camels for water for ourfelves and fervants, who (including the two country Chrifiians) make up ten perfbns. Three horfes, and two mules. One Camel for carrying corn for the beafts.

In the afternoon we paid the bifhop a fecond vifit, and prayed Mr. Garden to fend to die Jew merchant, revoking an order before given him, to pay the Arab on our account, fourteen hundred piaftres. About leven in the evening we heard from our Terrace the report of two fmall cannon, and a little after eight the Jew came and acquainted us that his goods were arrived. We told him our apprehenfions; he declared that he fhould have his merchandife all ready to put on the Camels in three or four days, and after that it would reft with Hahil Swylem to lade, difpatch and depart : which he heartily wifhed on his own account, as well as ours, could be the follow ing day, as till then, the expence of keeping three hundred Cameh would be a great drawback on the merchant's profit. We found he had already advanced they^r^ eight hundred piaftres on our account, but wc defired him to ftop his hand. Hahil Swylem came to us this morning with the Jew merchant •, the firft promifed to enter into a written agreement, that if he does not go hence in ten days, he will repay the fourteen hundred piaftres on demand, and the contraft at our pleafure fhall be void : we commiflioned the Jew to get this agreement, and the whole of our former contrad with the Arahy committed to paper in the Arab's own language, and ligned by him. • Cojee Raphael ox&amp;tved. a ¥akht Rev an to be brought for our infpeftion; we found it too fhort, and too little in every relpedt for our purpofe, but the bifliop fent us carpenters to make new ones out of the wood that ?vlr. Garden had bought for the occafion: each is to be large enough to hold two perfons, and is to be fix feet long, four broad, and five in height, arched at the top with thin boards, over which we purpofe to put hides, the better to fhelter us from the fun ; the fides are to be letticed for the convenience of admitting air-, the infide is to be lined with green linen, and the machines are to be fixed upon two poles, and carried by two mules. The conveniences for travelling in Turky are confined to the Takht Re- ■van. Cage, or Cradle, horfes, affes, and camels.

The Arab told us yefterday, he would be ready to leave this place with our party in a very few days, if we thought fit; and advifed our advancing as far as Aet, a place fome tew leagues on the other fide of the Euphrates, and there wait for the coming up of his Caravan i he propoled this, he faid, as a means of our getting palt the moft dangerous part of the whole journey, in refpeft to the S ami el wind. Taking the thing for granted, we feemed to relifh the fcheme, but the bifhop who paid us a vifit this morning unattended, diffuaded us from it, laying there was no more danger between this place and Aet, than between that and Aleppo ± and he hoped, if Swylem kept his word, or even it he fhould not exceed above five or fix days of his time, we might with the precautions already taken, go on hap pily enough ; but was altogether for our itaying till the Caravan let off, left after our departure, the condudlor, though reckoned a good fort of man in his way, fhould play us fome flippery trick. The afternoons are very hot now in the city ♦, the ftreets are fo narrow, and the walls fo high, that the common houfes are quite fuffocating.

We are at prefent fupplied with pretty good apples and apricots from fome gardens which are fituated by the fide of the river near Hilla \ and in thofe gardens are vines, date, and other fruit trees ^ grapes and plumbs will be ripe in a few days. Our table is furniflied with plenty of cucumbers, and berenjoles; but cabbages are paft, fo are beans and peas : the river affords fifh, but they are not firm*[ 28o ] Mr. Alms and I rofe at four this morning, and took a ride round both towns, accompanied by the bifhop and Mr. Garden, We were about an hour and three quarters in compafllng the old town, which we judged to be near nve miles in circumference; the other, which lies on the eaft fide of the Tygris, and is not quite fo large, took us up an hour and fifteen minutes. The bifhop thinks they both contain about four hundred and fifty thoufand fouls. He was not clear as to the precife time when they were built; but what is called the new town, is lefs ancient than the other *. When the emperor Amurath took Baghdad from the Perjians, he fet about fortifying this part. It is furrounded with a good wall, with many turrets, and a parapet for mufketry; it has alio, at certain diftances, nine baftions, each mounting eight brafs guns, but in bad order, and of irregular fizes, procured from the Portuguefe fettlements in the gulph of Perjta ; fome were caft in Germany^ fome in Perfia^ and others in Holland. His lord- ihip told me, he believed there might be in the city, mounted, or on the ground, one hundred and fifty cannon. Before the wall is a good ditch, and an indifferent glacis; the ditch is dry, unlefs in a fmall part, where fome water remains from the laft rains, in v/hich we obferved the Turks to be wailiing their linen : this accounts for the miferable colour of our's wafhed at Baghdad. Through this ditch a conftant run of water might eafily be brought from the river, had the Turks the leaft inclination to add to the ftrength of the place, or rather were they not fo extremely indolent, and inattentive to their own fecurity; and yet, inconfiderable as the fortifications of Baghdad are, the famous Nadir Shah, or Kuly Khan, * Prideaux in his connexion of the Old and New Teftament has fatisfaftorily cleared up this point. 44 Perchance, fays he, the giving of the name of Babylon to Stieucia, was that which gave life to the prefent vulgar error, that Baghdad now fuuated in the very place, where formerly old Babylon ftood. For when Baghdad was firft built, it truly was upon the fame plat of ground. Where formerly SeJeucia, or new Babylon flood. For as old Babylon was exhaufted by Yehuda, fo afterwards was Seleucia by Ctejiphon and Almadayen, and' thefe two again by Baghdad ; it being the humour of the princes of thofe ages, to build new cities to be monuments of their names, and to defolate old ones in the neighbourhood for the peopling of them. By this means Seleucia being reduced to defolation, as well as Babylon, at the time when Jlu Jaafar Almanfur, Caliph or emperor of the Saracens, begun his reign (which was in the year of our- Lord feven hundred and fifty-four) it had nothing upon it but the cell of a chriftian monk, called Dad, and a garden joining to it. From whence it had the name of Baghdad, that is, in tiie language of that country, the harden of Dad. And upon this place was the cky firft built, which hath ever fince been called by this namfe of Baghdad. For the fame JUmanJur being refolved, out of diflike to Hafhernia, where his predecelfor before refided, to build him a new city, to be the capital feat of his empire, chofe that place for it where this garden lay, and there in the year or our Lord 762, ercdted this city upon the very foundations on which formerly Seleucia had flood, on the well fide of the Tygris. I^ut not long after it was traftf- l.ued over to the other fide, and there it at prefent ftaniis, above the place where Ctejiphon was formerly fituated on the fame fide of the river, that is, on the eaflern fide ; and that which was firll built on the weflern fide, is now no more than a luburb to it. This city, from the reign of Alrnanfur, was for many years the capital of the Saracen empire, and ftill remains a place of great note in the eafl. but they are much miflaken, who think it the fame with old Babylon. i'or that was upon the Euphrates, but Baghdad is upon the Tygris, at the diilance of forty miles from the place, where that old city flood. Prxdeaux, Book viii. although Ki muim » ■ Mini ■iiwwii w m n im i &gt;i im in 11 1 WJtj; jt«?* [ 281 J although he fat down before it twice with a very numerous army, and threw fcveral hundred (hells into the city, could not matter it. The wall all round is full of loop-holes for mufketry, and has in its infide, little cham bers or lodgments for the foldiers. From the bottom of the ditch to the top of the wall is about forty feet: the De/er/ comes quite up to the foot of the glacis. The bifliop remembers, that about twenty-five years ago, the rivers Euphrates and Tygris were fo overflown, that the whole country between them appeared as one large fea •, and over all the plain between this city and people could pafsonly in boats : the water flowed quite up to the o-Ia- cis, the ditch was full, the city alio overflown, and the foundation of moft of the buildings hurt-, th ee hundred houfes were entirely deftroyed. To pre vent as much as poffible fuch a thing from happening again, the Turks take care now to face the foundation wall of their houfes, with a compofition of charcoal, aihes, and Demar (a fort of bitumen.) The land towards the Defert is almoft entirely barren, except two or three fpots with com, whofe harveft is now gathering in. Without the city were many hundred Camels^ fome preparing for Bamafcus, others for Mofiil In our ride, I obferved every Mofque or church to be crouded with pigeons on the outfide, which breed in the Domes and Minarets-, and you generally fee on the Minarets the Stork, a large bird called by the Jrabs Leg-leg, a deftroyer of ferpents j the Turks never offer to moleft it, on the contrary a neft of them is efteemed by a bigoted Turk more than a field full of fheep and camels. Thofe who own a houfe where Storks have nefted, are fuppofed to receive great bleflings from heaven; and if a Chriftian fhould happen to kill one of them, his life would be in danger. Upon the wall and glacis, were feveral large birds, not unlike a Mallard-, but by the peculiarity of their cry, they muft be of a different fpecies. After our ride, we breakfafted with the bifhop, on coffee, bread, and country cheefe, (which laft is very indifferent) apples and mulberries ; the mulberries are of the fmall Indian fort, not much refembling ours in Europe. We finiflied, with fmoaking the Argik, and drinking a glafs of French white wine, and came home about nine o'clock, when wc found the carpenters, brifkly at work on our Takht Revans. Bap a Solyman, is the chief commander at Baghdad under the Grand Seignior: in effeel, he is the fupreme lord himfelf of this part of the empire. He makes no remittances to the Porte, but rather, he yearly brings his matter in debt for repairs, or pretended repairs of fortifications, fupporc of troops, &amp;c. The Grand Seignior has more than once attempted to fuperfede him •, but the Janizaries, of whom he has at leaft forty thou- fand under his command, would admit of no other mafter; fince that time three or four different meffengers have been fecretly fent for his head, but O o as 1758. I 11 I ' '■ 11 If fa- I I[• 2 8a ] as he has always been wary and apprized of their errand, inftead of fubmit- ling and reverently kifflng the mandate, as is the commbn practice of thofc who live within reach of the Grand Seignior's authority, he has always made it a rule to fend the heads of thofe very meffengers to Conftantinople inftead of his own. He keeps the province in good order, for all have a high opinion of his military fkill and prowefs i but whenever he (hall die, it is expe6led, the greateft confufion will enfue: Chriftians in particular will not be in fafety for their perfons or property and therefore, it is appre hended, will take care to remove in time. The Janizaries here are in gene ral difpofed to be rude to ftrangers, but fo reftrained by the prefent Bajha's power, that the fubjedls of European princes not only live in peace, but; are alfo treated with the greateft refpedt. We found refiding at Baghdad, Azet Khan, one of the competitors for the Terfian empire, who after his defeat by Achmet Shah, fled here for proteflion, with only twenty followers. The Khan has lately exprefled a defire of re- turning to Perfia : This requeft of his in all probability will not be granted, the Bajha pretending that it is not in his power to accede to it, until he fhall have received an order from the Grand Seignior for that purpofe. Cojee Raphael, who frequently attends the Bajha's, and Kahierh levees, aflures me, that Kerim Khan has lately fought and defeated Hajfein Khan. Achmet Shah ftill continues in his own, the Afghan or Pytan country, but in the year 1757, he marched an army into the empire of the Great Mogul, and plundered the capital city Dehli of its jewels, monies, and valuable effcds, though he did not think proper to dethrone the Mogul, following herein the example of the famous Kuli Khan. This Achmet is reported to have 300,000 foldiers under his command. When we came from BaJJora, we left the fon of the Grand Seignkrh Jef- terdar, or chief treafurer, a prifoner there ; here we found the father him- felf in prifon. He is charged with having been guilty of many frauds, and his goods and chatties were a few days ago feized upon, and expofed to fale at a public audion. It is generally imagined that he will not be long- lived. Two months ago, Selim, Bajha of the Courdiftan ipvovmct, was put to death in this Seraglio during the government of Achmet the late Bafoa of Baghdad, this was zCaun, and governor of the Per/tan province of Courdiftan?, and gave great trouble not only to the Perfians who were under his own immediate command, but alfo to the fubjedls of the Seignior who lived in his neighbourhood. Achmet Bajha had often fent troops againft him, and a little before he died, put himfelf at the head of an army ; but the Perfian, though oftentimes in great danger of falling into his hands, yet made a fhift to efcape, which [fo much mortified the Bajha, that it is uni- verfally believed, he died of a broken heart. The civil wars oi Perfia having for fome years fubjecled the Courdijian province to the authorityaniirarmanft t ] -of the Bajha of Baghdad-, Selim* though much againft his inclination, had been obliged to make his fubmiffion. Solyman, the reigning 5^, not'fatis- fied with this, had long wiflied for an opportunity of getting Selim into his power, to gratify not only his own revenge, but that of his wife (daughter to the deceafed Achmet) who, with many other Turks and Per/mm whom he had injured, thirfted for his blood: Selim it feems had conducted himfelf with fo much cruelty, that he was among the Turks become almoft the objed of as much terror, as ever was the famous Nadir Shah. Solyman, to effba: his defign, pradifed the moft refined diffimulation; the ftrongeft profefllons of friendfhip on his part were repeatedly made, with'afiuranees that the requeft Selim had prefented of being appointed Bajha over the province of Courdiftan, fhould be moft readily complied with. Accordingly, an in vitation was fent him to come to Baghdad, in order to his beino- invefted with the honours annexed to the high office ; Selim hefitated a long time, being doubtful of the event, but at length all his fcruples were overcome by the perfuafion and art of two falfe friends, who had been often fent by him in confidence to Baghdad, but through mercenary views had now been brought over to the intereft of Solyman. The Bajha of Baghdad took care to be abfent at his country-feat, fome diftance from the capital, when Selim made his entrance with his two friends; but left ftrid orders, that he fhould be ufhered in with all the honours due to his rank. He was accordingly conduced to an handfomc apartment in the Bajha?s palace, and treated with the greateft refped. Pre vious to this however, doubts had again OpprefTed his mind, and on his drawing nigh to the city he was feized with an agony of fear; but as it was too late to think of retreating, he refolved to make ufe of the only means that remained for fecuring his future fafety. Before he entered the walls, he paid a vifit of devotion to the tomb of the late Bajha, and there, agreeable to the Mahometan cuftom, irwoked the fhrine of the departed fpi- rit. He fent alfo a fupplicating embafTy to the Bajha and his wife, defiring fome new marks of their favour and forgivenefs : the embafTador returned with an handkerchief from each, which is looked upon as the ftrongefl proof of friendfhip they could poffibly have. fent. Thus comforted, all Seliiris fears vanifhed, and with alacrity he repaired to the palace. In about five days afterwards, Bajha Solyman returned to his capital ; and the morning following was fixed upon for giving Selim an audience, and for invefting him with the Pelije, or vefl of filk lined with Samoor-fur, which in Turky and Perfia is prefented only to thofe whom they defign highly to honour. On the day and hour appointed, the unfufpedting Selim was con duced by the proper officer into a grand apartment; then into another, lefs fpacious •, and laft of all into a third, mean and obfeure to a great degree. He had not continued long here, before four or five fellows rufhed in and rudely deprived him of his Cuttari or knives, and then of his Shaul, being the better part of his drefs; foon after, they prefented him with fhackles for O o 2 * his HMlnt 284 ] his hands and feet; when they had put them on, they condiKfled him to a prilbn, where he lay eight or nine days, and then was ftrangled •, his head alfo was cut off 7 , and fent to Conjlantinople. Soon after the death of Selim, a fchedulfe of the debts due from him to government was produced to his two falfe friends, and the difcharge of them infifted upon as an indifpenfable pre liminary to the Bajhcfs appointing one of them {Abdallah) to the govern ment of Courdijian, and the other to another advantageous and honourable poft. They both agreed to the terms ttipulated for their advancement and on this occafion, the crafty Solyman, got in money or good fecurity,. twenty thoufand purfes, each containing five hundred Fiajlres, or one million, two hundred and fome odd thoufand pounds fterling.. The forces kept up at Baghdad confift of abont 5000 horft, 1000 AJfafa and 40,000 Janizaries^ many of whom are tradefmen. Cojte Raphael tells me, that out of all thefe, the Bajha cannot of a fudden fend into the field above 10,000 men, though in a little time perhaps he might make them up 30,000. In matters indeed where the Grand Seignior's intereft is materially concerned, reinforcements might be had in a few weeks from Moful and Diarhekir •, and'the government alfo of Bajfora could fend troops, fhould the Bajha of Baghdad give his orders for them. Solyman is turned of fixry ; he was a (lave to the preceding governor, hath only one wife, but, fhocking to relate ! we were informed that he kept upwards of 20 boys for his unna^ tural gratifications. There are about 150 Armenian Chrijlian families in Baghdad, fbme of whom are Papijls, but the greater number are under their own Patriarchy who refides on the confines of Turky and Perjia* Here are three minifters ordained by the Patriarch \ their income is uncertain, as depending upon the voluntary fubfenptions of their people. Cojee Raphael hySy that each of them may pofllbly get 2000 Piaftres a year, or thereabouts. A very intelligent gentleman gave us the following particulars concerning the 'Turks : That they are not allowed an unlimited number of wives, but are confined to four at the moft-, nor do they marry for a certain time, or at pleafure (as Sir John Char din relates) but for life. If their women exceed four, all above that number ihould be of the hufband's flaves, for he has no property in his wive's flaves, and a criminal communication with them is deemed highly fcandalous. She receives them from her own family on her marriage, and ever remains miftrefs of them, independant of the autho rity of the hufoand. Neither are the Turks cruel to their flaves, as has been commonly, but erroneoufly imagined-, for excepting thofewho work in their galleys, thefe people are the happieft of any in the Grand Seignior^ domi nions,. A mailer, who has been faithfully ferved by a flave for a twelve month or more, will not fell him *, on the contrary, fhould that flave chance to behave ill afterwards, the mafter, though he has power over his life, yet fclUom extends his feverity farther even for the greateft fault,, than to ftrip. 7 hitnif 285 ] him of his clothes, difmifs him from his ferviee, and turn him out of the houfe. If a flave has at any time been put to death, it muft have been by a drunken, diflblute Janizary, and not by any mafter who bore the chara£ler of a. gentleman or merchant. In general, the Turks fo abominate cruelty in this refpeft, that fhould a mafter treat a flave with too great leverity, his neigh bours would not fail to reproach him, bidding him to refledl, that the flave is of the human fpecies as well as himfelf, and fhrewdly propofe to him this interefting queftion, How would you like to be fo ferved, in the fame cir- cumftances ? 5 Tis no uncommon thing with them to give their daughters in marriage to their flaves, and who are often made governors of places. There is one piece of refpedt however, which the mafter always requires when ftrangers are in company, and that is, for the flave to ftand in his prefence. This ceremony (which they take care deeply to.imprint upon the minds of all) is ftri&lt;5Uy obferved during their whole lives; for though a flave,. after hav ing obtained, his freedom,, may by a lucky turn of fortune, rife to^ fome honourable ftation, while the mafter continues in the fame rank of life^ or perhaps finks into a lower condition -, yet the formers in this point of civi lity at leaft, will never be unmindful of his primitive ftation. It happened lately for the flave of a button-maker in Baffora, to be railed to the govern ment of that city; they never afterwards met, though in the Seraglio, but the governor paid this point of refpcd to his old mafter,. who ftill continued, to carry on his trade. A Turk will frequently difinherit an undutiful fon^ and give his fortune to his flayer only leaving the fon a fcanty pittance for his fupport. They always look upon a flave in a more refpedable light than an hired fervant the one, they fay, is a fervant only by misfortune, the other often from choice. If a Bafha of three tails, or any other man of rank, fends a flave to fome diftant place on bufinefs of importance, it is expected that he fhall- have greater civilities fhewn.him, than, if he had never been in bondage;:, for you are to fuppofe that the flave fent on fuch an errand is in the fecrets of his mafter, and confequently one in whom he places the greateft con fidence. Upon the whole, it is^ found policy that direds the 'Turk to pur fuch truft in his flave, rather than in any other perfon fince it is natural- to believe, that he whofe happinefs or mifery entirely depends on his- mafter's pleafure, will be leaft liable to deceive him. ji# , a ^ Our friend obferved alio, that the Bafhas, and other TurEfb governors^ are in general very diflblute in their manners; they commonly pur- chafe their offices with a fum of money,, but they never fail to reimburfe themfelves out of the pockets of thofe who are fo unhappy as to live under their jurifdi6lion. No Gentleman, or Merchant Turk, will ever attend the court of a Bafha,. if he can poflibly avoid it. Whenever any of them are fent for, they always go with fear and trembling, left they fliould be obliged to pyy[ 286 ]. 175^- P a y a fum of money, or forced into a fcandalous aflbclation with „-y—/ the great, to the prejudice of fome honeft man. The Janizaries are generally enemies of the Bajhas, and they are the only people of whom thefe officers, and the Grand Seignior himfelf, are afraid. They enjoy many privileges above other fubjedls occafionally wear a cloak, and in the Bazars or markets, they have a right to purchafe, duty free, as much of moft commodities as their cloaks will cover. The Salaam, or falute which they make to their fuperiors, is far lefs fubmiffive than that cf any other perfon. They are never punifhed for any crime in public, but are conduced into a private apartment, the doors of which are immediately fhut; in the room are many other Janizaries, who forming a circle round the prifoner, hear and judge of the charge that is exhibited againft him : if he is found guilty, and fentenced by them to be corporally puniftied, the punifhment muft be inflided by one of their own order, who in doing it, is obliged to reft his right knee on the ground, and not to carry the hand which holds the fcourge higher than his own ear. And even the execution of this fentence, may be prevented by any one of the attending Janizaries fhewing his difapprobation by a hem or cough, or by rifing from his feat; for if he does fo, the others will immediately follow the example, and the prifoner is of courfe difcharged. If a Janizary be condemned to die, he is ftrangled by other Janizaries ; the corpfe is interred at eight in the even ing, and honoured with the difcharge of one cannon, in the fame manner as if he had died a natural death, I.i » O V. .v Our friend concluded his account, with obferving, that it was morally impoflible for a Turk, Perftan, Arab, or any other perfon profeffing the Mahometan faith, ever to be converted to Cbrifiianity, fo long as any men tion fball be made of the dodlrine of the Trinity. For as their prefent grand article of faith is the unity of the Godhead, whenever they hear of one being three, and three, one,' they are fure to fmile at the weaknefs of fuch a be lief. They acknowledge the divine milfion of Jefus Chrijiy and fay that he was the greateft of all the prophets before Mahomet, that he taught the truth relating to the Godhead, and the duties neceflary for mankind; but that his followers abufed the purity of his religion, committed blafphemy by calling him God, and that Jefus Chrift will hereafter appear in judgment againft them. They alfo deny that this prophet of God was ever crucified; for they fay, God would never have permitted fuch an indignity to be offered to fo faithful a prophet; and aflert that the identical Jefus Chrift was fnatched away by God himfelf, and the Jews ignorantly put another to death in his ftead *. A gentleman Turk's drefs is very neat. On his head he hath a white or green J urban, made of linen or fhawl -f ; or he wears a green, red, or black * This was a very early opinion of fome Chriftian heretics, and no doubt Mahomet borrowed it from them. . f Shawl is a manufafture of Camsl\ hair, or Carminlan wool. cloth[ ^ 3 doth cap, or bonnet, which is a foot or more high, very fliff, being thickly quilted, and flat at top : over that part of the cap which goes round the head, is twifted a white or green linneh cloth, but his neck is always bare. Next to his body he wears a long Hurt, fhaped like our women's fhifcs; the tail of this Ihirt is put into a pair of linnen drawers, and over thefe drawers, is another large loofe pair of drawers made of fhawl, and to each ancle part, is fewed a yellow thin flipper, without an heel, the fole of which is- no thicker than the upper leather of the fame flipper; thefe flippers are worn within another ftronger pair of flippers, which alfo are without heels the outer flippers, on coming into an houfe, the Turk leaves at the door. Next to the ihirt, is a veft that fits dole to the body and buttons on the breaft, whofe tail reaches to the calf of the leg: upon this firfl: veil, is another with lapels made of fine linen cloth, which buttons clofe at the fleeves near the wrifts i this veft reaches to the' ancles with an open petticoat-like tail, and over it, around the waift, is pafled a fine fafh, with a border that is generally ornamented with gold or filver needle work t In the bofom, under the lapel of this fecond veil, is carried the watch and an handkerchief, which handkerchief is alfo ornamented with gold and filver embroidery : over all is worn a third veft, loofe, made either of fine cloth, or of fhawl; this has flit fleeves which are lined with filk, and at pleafure are either buttoned, or worn open ; but this outer garment is ufually thrown off when the perfon is at home. This defcription is appli cable to their fummer habit, the quality, though perhaps not the make of their drefs, may differ in the winter. Befides the cap defcribed, we fee a va riety of other caps, fome of which are a foot and a half high, of very great' circumference, whofe outfides are covered with fur. The cap-gentlemen, I believe, are always in office under the government. The drefs of the women, with whofe fight we have been favoured, but Who indeed are only thofe that are'on foot in the ftreets, and confequently of the lowed fort, confifts of a fhift, like the men's fhirts; a veil or two over that, and then a loofe cover or veil of linen from top to toe; their- legs and feet are covered like the men's. On that part which goes over the head, is faftened a black horfc-hair covering for the face, about fourteen or fifteen inches fquare, which they fometimes lifted up to look at us : their- hands and arms are full of different marks made with gunpowder, their faces are fpotted blue, and their lips often the fame. The better lort ot women are admitted on the Terraces in the evening?, but their hufbands are ex tremely fearful left they fhould be feen by men, from the houfes adjoining. We have difficulty to keep ourfelves within rule, not more from curiofity, than inattention. Mr. Garden and Cojee Raphael cautioned us on the fub- jeft ; the former told us, that one of his neighbours had been very trouble- fome on this head, and once fwore to him aloud, that it he fhould ever again catch his eye towards his territories, he was determined to thiow himfelf inftantly from the Terrace^ and dafh out his brains, that his blood might reft on Mr. Garden 9 ^ head. One of our caps or hats, was feen by anoihec:[ 288 ] another neighbour, who immediately, open mouthed, protefted againft the affront: in fad, we are in this great city, prifoners in a very ftrid fenfe j a circumftance, fomewhat mortifying to the free Britijh fpirit. A little before we got here, -a country Chrijlian merchant of fubftance, •was difcovered by the public officers in bed with his own Turkijh fervant's wife-, 'twas believed that he had given the h-afband a fum of money for this liberty, and which he had enjoyed, for fome time paft. Death is the punifhment which the law inflids on offenders of this kind, or embracing the Mahometan faith ; by intereft and money however the fentence was not executed in this cafe, but the following punifhment in it's ftead : the breeches or troufers of the offender were taken off, and the petticoat, or that part of the apparel which is ufed by the Hurkijh women inftead of it, put over his head, and thus fhamefully attired, he was led over a great part of the city, publicly expofed, and infulted by the rabble. Chrijtians, Jews, and all the other Infidels of this country, are publicly jdiflinguifhed from the Mujfuhnen, by the colour of their'Twrte i the latter wearing them only of a white, or deep green, the others of different colours. 'None but true MuJJulmen likewife are allowed to wear a green drefs i not- withftanding this, Mr. Garden's cloaths were made of a pea-green. This near approach to the Muffulmarfs colour, is permitted to ftrangers in a refpeft- able flation, but they cannot go farther without giving offence, or running a great i;ifk of being affronted. At five this evening, our whole party (Mr. Garden alfo accompanying us) fet off on horfes, and mules, for an ancient ruin called Tauk-Kefferab, which means Kejferah's Arch it lies to the fouth-eaft of Baghdad, diftant about 20 miles, and within a mile of the tfygris. The journey by land is about fix hours; we rode it in fix, and returned in five, exclufive of the time fpent in the village. Having been difappointed in getting horfes and mules for carrying our baggajge, we were obliged to fend it in a Sandal down the Tygris, intending that our fervants fhould join us with the tent, &amp;V. at the village TeaUah ten miles from Baghdad: we defigned to have refted there a few hours, and then have proceeded on to view the Arch early the next morning before the fun fhould be troublefome •, but our fervants in the boat met with interruptions which prevented their joining us till the next morn ing, long after we had reached the ruins. We got to the village about a quarter paft nine, having paffed by a good deal of corn and garden ground, well fupplied with water from the Tygris. Here we procured a little milk, others chofe a bit of bread and cheefe, and drank a glafs of the wine we carried with us ; after which, each endeavoured to get a little fleep, either in the open air, or under cover of a T urkijh hovel j but all were difap- pointed, from the perplexing mufchetos, lice, and fleas, which greatly abound in and near fuch fort of habitations. Atmmmmmamm [ 289 ] At one o clock we croiTed a large creek, in a boat which held twelve men, three horfes, four mules, and one afs, and went on towards the Wrcb which was feen by the help of the moon two or three miles off: the ereateft part of the way was through a thicket made up of the liquorice, caper the low cotton and cyprefs flirubs; in this cover (called here a foreft) are often feen Lions and JVild B ocits ^ we met with neither, but got very ouietlv on to Soliman Pack's tomb, or the tomb of Soliman the Clean, alias. Smack ■Smooth, who was barber to Mahomet. The traditional hiftory of this per- fon is, that he was much reverenced by his countrymen, and looked on as highly favoured of the Prophet: he lived to a great age, and was in the general eftimation, a pious old man, but as he always was obliged to keep with him a female fervant for the management of his domeftic af fairs, his moral condud thereby became doubtful, and the fubjeft of much difputation: his revilers however (as the ftory goes) at length fuf- fered fbame, for the Prophet himfelf, concerned at the injuftice done the character of his faithful Soliman, miraculoufly caufed the genital parts to fall off^ thereby enabling the old man, in the moft effedlual manner to eftablifh his innocence, by fhewing them the impoflibility of his commit ting the crime of which he ftood accufed. In this holy man's fleeve, fome of the moft credulous Mahometans tell you, the cat made it's firft appearance : having been fupernaturally pro duced there, through his devout interceflion, for the advantage of mankind. On the firft difcovery, the Sage fo cherifhed it, that in tendernefs he cut off the fleeve of his garment, and placed it as a carpet for the valuable ftranger. So much for this fabulous ftory: the outer wall of his tomb appears to be of modern brickwork, nor does the tomb itfelf look fo an cient as the porch or entrance to it. At a quarter of a mile diftance. Hand the ruins of that very confider- able work of antiquity, we intended to vifit. Neither the not Arabs know any thing about it; they are at a lofs to determine, whether it was .a temple or palace. The bilhop told us it was commonly fuppofed to have been a temple, dedicated to the fun; probably people have been led to this conjedlure, from obferving very many openings yet remaining in the Arch, that pafs for lamps, and which they fay, could have been all lighted in the twinkling of an eye; our opinion was, that thefe holes were fo many funnels for the admifTion of air. Mr. Doidge took with his Qua drant, the exa6t meafurement of the Arch, and the front of the building, and drew a perfpeflive view of it w-ith his pencil: the eaft face of the whole is 300 feet in length, the breadth of the Arch 85 feet, height of the Arch 106 feet*, length of the arched roofed room from eaft to weft * Our common journal contains thefe farther obfervations. ' Part of the roof of thi» room is fallen in ; the front on each fide of the arch is full of niches like our cathedrals, which there probably onse flood fome images: the whole fabric is built of bricks a foot fquarc, ^nd three inches thick.' P p[ 2 9 0 I is 150 feet: the niches, in the face or front of the building, refemble the work of our old abbies. The front, of which Mr. Doidge has taken a view, ftands due eaft, in which are ftill niches, and defaced pillars •, the weft and back front is- very much deftroyed, no view therefore was taken of that. In the Arch were pigeons, jays, fparrows, and fome other birds. Until the fun got high, we had fhelter from its rays, within the Arch ; but after that we had recourfe to our tent, where we found it very hot indeed. - To the fouthward, between this ruin and the Tygris, is a tomb and Mofque, named Haud Eeffey: and on the other fide of the river, is a rifing fpot on which ftands a powder-mill, for the ufe oi Baghdad, called Purite Kaune. For a very confiderable way all around the Arch, the ruins of other vaft buildings are to be found, though in fuch defolation, that not the fmalleft piece of a wall is now ftanding. The bricks and mortar however are in fuch abundance, that no doubt can poflibly remain but that here once ftood a city of feveral mites in circumference and from the accounts given by hiftorians of the extent and fituation of Ctefipfan *, there is the greateft reafon to believe, that on this very fpot, that magnificent and powerful city once ftood. One of our Turkijh fervants who fpoke a little of the Portuguefe language, told my man M'Intojh, that the moft general received opi nion in this country, was, that ^auk Kejfera, was not built by a Perfiany Parthian, Turk, or any other Afiatic, but by an European prince, who came into this part of the world with a large army, and fubdued it. As we had not yet met with any edifice in Afta, carrying with it fo great a refemblance of the ancient European architefture as this; it ftruck me, that Tauk Kejfera might have been conftrufted, foon after the con- queft of this part of the world, by Alexander the Great, or one of his captains -f. The Turks confefs that they know nothing certain concerning this ruin;.' there is however a traditionary and fabulous account amongft them, that it was built by one Kejfera, the fon of Shirwan that he was the king of the country and refided in this palace that he caufed a chain to hang down Ctejiphon, according to the ancient accounts of It, was fituated on the eaft fide of the Tygris, at fome diftance from Seleucia, and a little removed from the river. Thefe ruins are on the eaft fide of the Tygris, about 18 or 20 miles from Baghdad (the ancient Seleucia), and that part of them which is neareft the river,, is a mile dittance from it. . . v. t ; J .i 1 • ; 10 . : . • t From the fimilarity between the name of this ruin Keflra, and the Greek word a friend of the author luppofes that this edifice might poliibly have been built by one of the C&amp;faru emperors of Rome, feveral of whom are known to hava carried their arms into this gart of AJia j. and then the Tauk Kejfera will fignify Cafor's Arch, tOs[ 291 ] to the ground from the room in which he himfelf flept, fo that whoever 17 in his dominions had any grievance to complain of which they wiftied the king to redrefs, they were ordered to pull at this chain. It once happened, that an afs which had fuffered much from the crucky of his mafter, came and tugged at the end of it and what was ftill more furprizing, the power of fpeech was fo far miraculoufly given to him, as enabled him to make one of the king's attendants underftand, that he the als had bufinefs with his majefty. The creature accordingly got admittance, diicovered its wounds, &amp;c. The owner was lent for, feverely rebuked, and told, that if in a certain number of days, he did not cure the afs, he fhould certainly be put to death. Fortunately for him, fays the fable, the creature was made well exadly at the time limited, and ever afterwards the afs, and all other ufeful cattle, were exempted from thofe heavy fufferings, to which before this incident, they had been accuftomed from the feverity of their matters, who intimidated by this furprizing ftory became alfo more care ful of the lives of their beafts. The ftory adds, that a great fnake came afterwards to make a vifit, but his bufinefs was only to bring the king a water-melon-feed, as a reward for the faithful difcharge of his kingly truft: and from this fingle feed have fince been produced all ,the water-melons in the world. Such kind of allegorical ftories are not uncommon in Turky. About a mile and a half to the eaftward of the Arch, (lands an ancient mud-wall, three fides of a fquare, fronting eaft, weft, and north •, the river is to the fouth: the wall is about forty feet high, and thirty thick, and each fide about a mile in length -, we conclude it to have been a citadel to this once extenfive city. From the ruins hereabouts, are picked up ancient coins: not long ago, a poor fellow in digging, found a Imall jar with one piece of gold, and feveral forts of filver and copper pieces of money. I could only learn that they are looked on as ancient Perfian or Parthian coins: thp prefent Bajha has them, though neither he nor any of the Turks have a true tafte for fuch remains. The bifhop's paflion turns to medals \ he has made a great collection, it is faid to the value of 50 or 60,000 pialtres, or about 6 or 7000 /. fterling. From fome poor Arabs, who live in a fmall village near the Arch, we got milk, butter, and a lamb which our fervant broiled; he fhot alfo a young Jackal, which we prefented to an old Arab woman who was very thankful, and we were told would eat it. At half paft twelve at night, we lent our baggage to the Sandal, to be Mon carried to Baghdad, and mounted our cattle; we returned over the river Ma y toTeallah about three in the morning, when we were entertained by the lark ; reded before the ferry-houfe for half an hour, faw eight Pelicans in our journey back, and arrived at Mr. Garden's in the city, between fix and feven, P p 2 where[ 292 ] where we got a comfortable breakfaft on tea and clouted cream, fung as fong, and went merrily, bu£ very weary to bed.—Slept till near noon. In^he- evening we were vifited by the bifhop, and father Fidelity his lordftiip. had exprefled a defire that we. would favour him with the out-lines, fhouid we make a {ketch of the Arch •, Mr. Boidge fhewed him what he had taken in his pocket-book, apologized for not being able now to compliment his lordfhip with a copy, but promifed him one to be fent from when finiftied: the bifhop appeared pleafed and obliged, and invited us all to dine with him to-morrow. We were politely entertained to-day by the bifliop; two courfes of eight difhes at dinner, a deflert, punch,, claret, French, and TurkijU white wines. His lordfliip entertained us alfo with an account of an antique pile of buildings called Shah*, ftill to be feen at about twelve days journey between this place and Ifpahan ; wherein is a great, deal of fculpture in marble, with. Bajfo. and Alto Relievos, reprefenting battles, trophies, arms, men, and camels; and one moffc remarkable horfe whofe body feems quite detached from the wall, being joined only by the pedeftal on which it ftands. In the roof is. a window reprefented, and a head crowned,, with great earneftnefs looking through it, but at what objedl, the obferver is for a time at a lofs to guefs, till calling his eye in a particular diredion, which he is led to do by the extatic gaze of the figure above, he difcovers a. bath, and in it a naked Venus -fv In another part of the building, there is a long infcription in charaders •unknown to the bifliop, or any other of the French antiquarians. The letters are neither Per/tan, Parthian, Chaldean, Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, Coptic^ or any other type now known in this part of the world. His lordfliip had in his pofleflton two or three pieces of filver coin, one of which he prefented to •Mr. Doidge, on which is a head exadlly like that before defcribed as? looking- with fuch defire on the Venus in the bath. The charaders around its edge,, his lordlhip fays, are of the fame fort with thofeof the infcription in Kurman Shah, but whole head it is, he does not pretend to determine. He has compared it with the feveral impreflions in his books of medals, but can find no fimilitude. He fliewed us indeed, another coin,, and upon compar ing it with one in hi« book, we faw that it bore a ftrong refemblance of tbir. • * I i ur .'?f. n SbfiKbgnifoyRoyal Kurman I but whether it ftands for the name of a coiintry^ *ity, builamg, or king, nobody here could inform us,. m.

The bifhop however is very confident that this coin, and the head in Kurman Shab, were both defigned for the third or fourth king after Artaxerxes, for he thinks it was not till their reigns, that this new and unknown language was, introduced, Mr. Doidge borrowed of the biftrop a cover of an earthen vcflel, to take off an impreflion. It was found near the ruins of Tauk Kcjfera, and in it were many coins both gold and filver of feveral kings of Parthia and Syria, who reigned after Alexander. One of Antiochus the 4th, and another of Antiochus the 5th, of the moft curious metal •, the laft is judged to be worth 500 crowns. The cover is four inches and a half in diameter, and thirteen and a half in circumference: It has an indented knob in the middle' of the furface, through which is a hole, probably for a ring to hold it by. On each fide of the knob is a Sphinx rampant, one with its back to the other. Between the hind and fore leg of each, is a fprig with a flower. Their wings join at the top, and terminate in a flourifhing fprig over their heads. At the bottom, between their legs^ is another fprig, not much unlike a mitred cap. Around all, is an infeription on the margin in large charac ters, unknown to every one here, but which the bifhop fufpedls to be of the fame kind with thofe on Mr. Doidge''s medal, and the infeription in the ruins of Kurman Shah,. N. , *&gt;■ '■ . f, \ * • ' - • This morning, our conducing Arab came to^ us, ancT brought the Jew with him, who told us that all his goods were in the Defert, and ready to be put on the camels backs; fo that Habil Swylem's ill health is now the only impediment to our fetting out. We talked of paying a vifit this evening to Nimrod's tower. People ufually fet out early in the morning, flay there in a tent during the heat of the day, and return in the evening. But to avoid the inconvenience of continuing fo long under, a tent, as we before experienced in our excurfion to I'auk Kejfera, and to fave ourfelves the trouble of carrying with us our fervants and baggage, we propofed fetting off early enough to allow our being at the tower by break of day, and re turning to Baghdad before breakfaft. About nine o'clock this evening, the whole city was in an uproar, occafioned by a fire breaking out in one t)f the Bazars. It^was luckily extinguifhed,. after having confumed three fhops only., We were aflfured this morning that there is great danger in going to the tower of Nimrod by night, as the Arabs frequently make ufe of this favourable opportunity to attack travellers. . Laft night arrived at the Seraglio a meflenger from Aleppo ; who brings an account of the Bajha of that city being removed to ths BaJhalit-oi Mofd, wid of another's coming to Aleppo in his place.. MabiU[ 2 94 ] Hahil ^Swylem called upon us this rnorning, and feemed to be in better health ; he declares he will leave Baghdad next Friday, and proceed diredtly for Aleppo. The bilhop and four reverend fathers flipped with us this evening, and ftaid till pafb eleven. His lordfliip defired us not to forget, when we fhall arrive at a certain place, (four days journey on this fide of Aleppo) to ftrike a little out of the road, in order to fee the remains of an antient Roman canal. And in our journey from Aleppo to Scanderoon, he advifed us to take that road which leads to Antioch, there being fome old ruins well worth feeing in this lalt place. The bifhop and Cojee Raphael told me to-day, that they heard the Arabs about Bajfora had lately broken down the banks of the river, by which the Dejert near to the city is quite overflown. His lordfhip exprefled great uneafinefs about it, as the Handing water made putrid by the heat cf the fun, and by the great quantity of dead fifli which are always floating in it, never fails to produce fatal fevers; by which, about fifteen years ago, 12 or 14,000 people died, and not above two or three of the Europeans who were then at Bajfora, efcaped with their lives. Our Takht Regans are now quite finiflied-, we begun to feafon forty- fix large, and twenty fmall dog-fkins, we bought here for the holding of our water. The furnifhing ourfelves with neceflfaries for our journey has been attended with great difficulties, the laws of the Ramazan forbidding the people to work. The ^z^r-folks and artificers have been all hungry, thirfty, and out of temper; through the intereft of Mr. Garden, and the promife of extraordinary pay, we are at laft fitted for fetting out. At nine this evening the Ramazan ended, the Turks having difcovered the new moon. I obferved they were attentively looking out for her at fun-fet. The government at nine o'clock made her appearance known to the people, by £ring four guns from a baftion. « This morning was ufliered in with a difcharge of all the artillery of every baftion, to the number of near fixty : this is the ufual demonftration of joy at the expiration of the Ramazan. The difcharge was repeated in an hour afterwards, not, as at firft, in regular fuccefllve firings from each baftion, but in a hurrying confufed mariner. The Turks are all dreffed in their holy- day fuits, and MefTieurs Garden and Raphael went to make their congratula tory compliments to the grandees. Yeflerday we delivered to Habil Swylem, for the ufe of himfelf, the Takht Revan men, and our other attendants, the following articles of provifions j it being cuftomary, either to furnilh them with their whole ftock at once, ornHMBmBaoBaii [ 295 3 or to fupply them daily from your own tents on the journey : and as in coming up the Euphrates we had already experienced too much vexation on this head with our Trackers, we were determined on not rilking a repe tition, to Rice — — — Ruik or bifcuit — — Flour — — — Ghee or butter — — Coffee — — — 8 Baghdad Maunds, or 120 Itj 4 — — 60 lb 4 — — 60 lb 1 — — 15 Jk 1 — — J5lb I75S. At eleven o'clock in the morning, we received the mortifying news of our Arab conduflor being again taken ill of a fever. At five in the evening, he with great difficulty crawled to our houle, and we were all witneffes of his being ill indeed. We defired Mr. Hemet, who had fome knowledge of medicine, to take care of him. Our friend Mr. Pye is likewife indifpofed with feverifh fymptoms; I took away a little blood from him about fix o'clock in the evening: at eight 1 ordered an Ipecacum vomit to be given him ; but his fever continuing to increafe, at ten he took the fourth part of a paper of Dr. Jameses powder. The biftiop came to fee us this morning. Mr. Pye's medicine operated June 8.- properly : he fleeps, and is tranquil. The^good and friendly bifhop vifited Mr. Pye in the charafler of a phyfician. With the reft of us he reafoned as a divine, recommending patience, fortitude, and refignation to the will of heaven; bidding us to be of good cheer, even though we fliould be detained here till the month of September, A purple fever now rages in the city % it is fuppofed, that an eighth part of the inhabitants are ill in it; but as yet it has not been very fatal. The very hot months, they fay, are commonly moft healthy. His lordlbip re commended it to us, not to think of fetting out from hence over the great JDefert, with any other conductor befides Habil Swylem, and prays us to be mindful of this maxim, that ' in Turky an imprudent ftep cannot be re medied as in Europe' Mr. Pj^'s.fever is entirely gone, but has left him quite relaxed.. Cojee Raphael is of opinion, that the Arab will nor leave the village Aet for a long time, as the Damafcus Caravan is ftill there, not being able to purchale the neceifary Camels. This, he apprehends will be our cafe. We are greatly alarmed at it, and have fent a fervant to infped into the real ftate cf the camels. This morning the wind blew from the northward, and was agreeably cool. The holy-days following the Ramazan, end with this day. To morrow the feveral artificers will make no fcruple of going to work. We- 7 June 9^ li t fell . 1 mm ''rim illl' IJune 10. [ 296 1 We were informed this evening by our Jrab, that the Camels are not yet come, but he expeds them foon, and will certainly fet out this day feii'night. Such fliuffling and deceit have quite wearied us out; aad as it was clear, that we could not now leave Baghdad before the hotteft weather would fet in, we confulted together, and refolved, ' that the rifk attending our travelling ' over the Defert, is too great, and cannot be encountered with prudence.' Two Chrijiians who attempted to pais it iaft fummer exadly at this time of the year, died on the journey : fo did fourteen or fifteen of the country- people, belonging to the Great Caravan, We concluded therefore to tarry here, though to our unfpeakable mortification, till September next. The conductor of our Takht Revans ufed his utmofl: endeavours laft night to perfuade us to proceed by the Moful and Diarbekir roads. He faid, that he lately travelled that way from Conftantinople to ^his place; and aflured us, that the ficknefs and troubles which prevailed in thofe parts of the country are over •, that in the way from hence to Mofuly not the leaft danger can poflibly happen; that every day we fhall be in a village, where refrefhments may be had •, that between Diarbekir and Aleppo&gt; the Defert we have to pafs, will only take us up feven days ; that the Satniel winds may be avoided by travelling in the night only; and that a guard of fol- diers, which might be procured from the Bajha, would fecure us from all infult. Cojee Raphael this morning joined in the propofal, on which we refolved to take this route, and commiffioned Cojee Raphael to get the Receflary Phirmaunds from government, and every other thing which may be ufeful to us on our journey. In the evening, Cojee RaphaeU after having confulted his friends in the city, on the nature of our journey, returned, and gave us great encourage ment. He confirmed the account before given us by the condudor of the tfahht Revans, that by that route we fhould avoid the great Defert wholly, find ourfdves daily in towns or villages, and finiih our journey in thirty- five or forty days. We give ourfelves up entirely to his directions; and not- withftanding the many difappointments we have met with fince we left Cal cutta, begin again to pleafe ourfelves with the hope of being in a few months, in our native country, blefied with the happy fight of our families and friends. Hahil Swjlem returned us this morning 1200 Piaflres ; the remainder, he faid, had been laid out in neceflaries for us, which he is to account for to-morrow. We now find, even was he in health, that it would be impof- fible for him as yet to proceed on his journey, through the want of a fuf- ficient number of camels, He fent us a meflage expreflive of great forrow for our difappointment, and with offers of waiting upon us, three months hence. This poor man, we think, has not dealt quite candidly with us; yet, believe, he was not without hope of being able to fulfil his contract ruuch better than it has turned out. He has for the moft part, gotten his livelihoodf 2 97 J livelihood under the patronage of Mr. Shaw, and other European gentlemen '758. and they all give him a good charaaer. Mr. flsmst thinks he will aet the '— i r y m t* —v i-ii better or his fever. 0 I paid the blfliop a vifit in company with Meflieurs Garden and Doidre. June n. He ihewed us a very large and valuable Ruby, Tome antique Onyx ftones, very curioufly cut, and fome more medals. He has two colledlions of Roman coins; one of them is compleat, (which he does not intend to part with) in a regular fucceffion from Julius Cafar down to Corfan- tine. The other fet (which has a chafm of leven Emperors) his lordOiip propofes to fell *, and imagines that it may be worth. 50 ,000 Piafires. He has alio fome medals of private Roman families, and a great number of the Kings of Syria, Parthia, and Perfia. Of the laft he has many dupli* cates in gold, filver, and copper. Yefterday returned a Patamar or exprefs to our Jew merchant from Monday Aleppo, by the way of the Befert, which he had difpatched from this place J une about a month or five weeks ago. He was robbed three times by the Arabs, but knowing fome of the tribe, he had the good fortune to preferve the letter he had in charge. The Jew merchant, with 4 or 500 of his brethren, as alfo many Mahometans, are gone to pay their annual devotion to the tomb of Ezekiel the prophet, which by their account is at Kuta a village on the weftern bank ot the Euphrates, eight or nine miles above Hilla: where like- wife they (hew you, what they call the fiery furnace, into which Shadrach, Mejbach, and Ahed-nego were thrown. Somewhere about Coma, are the re mains of an ancient tomb, which is faid to be that of the prophet Ezra\ and in the ruins of Niniveh, near Moful (of which hereafter) is one reported to be the prophet Jonah's. We are impatient for the return of the Jew hither to open his packet, being big with expectation of news from Europe. Our fetting off for Moful depends alfo on the return of thefe devotees, for we are to be ferved with thirty of their mules. At three this morning, all the party (except Mr. Pye, whofe want of June 13. ftrength would not admit of it) accompanied by Mr. Garden, and an Italian mifllonary named Clementina, with one of Mr. Garden's fervants, and an Arab to (hew us the road, left Baghdad for NimrotPs tower. It lies weft by north, diftant about nine miles. We pafied the Tygris by the fame bridge of boats before-mentioned, and rode through the old city of Baghdad ; from whence, quite up to the tower, ruins of buildings either wholly above or fome- what under ground are ftill to be feen, which can be no other than the re mains of the ancient Seleucia. The ground began to rife in a gentle afcent, for half a quarter of a mile before we reached the tower, occaiioned, as wc imagined, by the rubbilh of the old buildings which once ftood here. • , * • He feemed to wifh that we would give notice of this to our countrymen. Q^q Whether s ifil: § I r, ■ ' 'ak . •m' 5[ 298 J 1758. Whether the tower was at firfl: of a fqnare or round form, is now difficult v. .yi' to determine, though the former is moft probable, betfaufe all the remaining bricks are placed fquare, and not in the leaft circular. The bricks are all twelve inches fquare, and four and an half thick. The cement is of mud or flime, mixed with broken reed as we mix hair with mortar; which flime might either have been had from one of the great rivers, or taken out of one of the fwamps in the plain, with which the country hereabout very much abounds. We paffed one of thefe fwamps in our way, which was about an hundred yards broad, and four feet deep. Between Baghdad and Kir coot e, according to the bifhop^s intelligence, are two fountains of Nufi Demar, or bituminous pitch. It comes out of the earth boiling hot •, and this is what fome writers have fuppoled the fcriptures to mean by (lime, in the building of the Tower of Babel. Betwixt every feventh or eighth brick in the tower, is a layer of reeds, of which I took a few for the fake of curiofity, alio fome of the flime, and a piece of both forts of - the brick, the harder and fofter-, for thofe which lie in the rubbifh are of a much harder fubftance, than what now remain ki the tower. The height of the ruin is 126 feet; the diameter of the largeft and middle part about 100 feet. We judge it to be folid to the center-, yet near the top there is a regular opening of an oval form, but as we could not climb up to, can determine nothing pofitive about it *, it appears however from the prcfent look to have been a window. The circumference of that part of the tower which remains, and is above the rubbifh, is about 300 feet,- but probably could the foundation be come at, it would be found of far greater extent. Mr. Boidge, from whofe draught with a pencil, the cop per-plate here inferted, was taken, calculated the vifibk ruins of the tower to contain about 100,000 cubic feet. The prefent Turks, Jews, and Arabians., are fond of believing this to be the identical ruin of the ancient tower of Babel, for which they affign a variety of reafons; but all, fo void of the appearance of truth, that to fet about confuting them would be lofing time in trifles. I am clearly of opinion, from its fituation, and many other circumftances, that it never could have been the tower of Babel-, but rather fufped it- to have been^ a beacon or watch-tow er to give notice of the approach of an enemy ; or perhaps uied as an obfervatory to infpeft the various motions of the- heavenly bodies, which fcience was fo much cultivated among the an cient inhabitants of this country, that even the Grecians,, though defirous of being efteemed the inventors of all arts and fciences. Could never deny the Babylonians the honour of having laid the foundations of aftronomy. And indeed the advantageous fituation of Babylon, which was built upon a wide, extended plain, where no mountain confined the profped ; and the conftant clearnefs and ferenity of the air in that country, fo favourabie to the free contemplation of the heavens, were fufficicnct 2 99 ] fafficient motives to engage this people in die purfuit of -aftronomical obfervations *. In our excurfion to the tower, we met with no interruption, and faw but very few perfons however, it would not be prudent for a man to go thither alone, or even for a large party unarmed. We all had our piftols with us, and Mr. Garden's fervant carried a mufket. We tarried at the tower an hour and half, and by ten in the morning got back to Mr. Garden's houfe. In our return through the old city, we pafled clofe by a decayed Mcfque, upon whofe dome we obferved a ftork, of the fize of a goofe, its breaft white, its head black and white, as were its wings; it had a long beak, and legs not lefs than two feet in length. In its neft on the top of the dome, were young ones, the head of one of them was vifible to us; the neft was built of fticks, and of an entire round form , we judged it to be four feet deep, and at lead two over. I took notice this morning, that almoft all the Minarets bend or in cline to the fouth-eaft. Two of them lean very remarkably that way, but whether they were fo defigned by the builders I was not able to learn. Perhaps the inclination may be owing to the force of the north-weft wind, or to the foundations giving way. From thefe, the people of the Mofques^ five times in the 24 hours, (at fun rife, at noon, at three o'clock in the af ternoon, at fun fet, and at midnight) call the inhabitants to prayers, crying aloud, ' There is but one God, and Mahomet is his Prophet: it is the duty of man to remember his God. Mujfulmen are now by his fervants called upon to come and pay their acknowledgments, and humbly to prefent their lupplications.' We were informed to-day, that the Bajha was preparing for war, and would very foon put his army in march for the north-ward. The bifhop, who prefently afterwards paid us a vifit, faid he had heard the report, though not as a thing certain, but would make farther enquiry about it. He did not think it improbable, becaufe the^h^J had lately robbed a Cara- vayi on the northern road, and even at this time, another between JV/p/a/ and Diarbekir is hindered from proceeding, through the appreheniion ot meeting with the fame fate.

We found the tents pitched on the eaftern bank of the Tygris, oppofite to a country feat of the Bafha* about a mile to the northward of the walls of the city. We had the fatisfaftion here to meet with the biftiop and father Fidelle, who came to wifti us a good journey, notwithftanding we had mutually taken leave of each other in the city. His lordfliip gave us three recom mendatory letters; one to Padre Lanza zn Italian miflionary zx. Moful\ a fecond for Pere Eugene a French miflionary at Merdin ; and the other for Monf.

He is to find his mules in provifions ; and fhould we make him and his people a prefent of a flieep and a little rice now and then, it is what they may expert by way of en couragement only, not a matter of demand. 7 Our ■■ ■wmi HI WHtinww lljr if t 303 ] ^, 0u i ?! c \ 0r groom ' is t0 , have 2 5 P iaftr «. be paid him it Jeppo. The Takht Remn-gee, or conduftor, has already been paid 29 and on our arnyal at Aleppo he is to have 31 more to make up 60 for him- felf and his feven men. Cojee Raphael nbW told us, that we muft provide a tent for the J?a who in general will chufe to live by himfelf, and which will be much more' con venient for us. Having given away one of our India made tents to Mr Rohingfon at Karec, and a fecond to Mr. Garden at Baghdad, we commiffioned ■Raphael to pufchafe another for our Aga, We continue on this fpot till to-morrow evening, in order to recollea: whatever may be wanting, and to get ourfelves well fupplied before we advance too far. We took a Walk this morning in one of the Eajha\ gardens, and found black and white grapes quite ripe; mulberries of the European kind, which were originally brought from Moful, peaches, nedlarines, and apricots, (the two firft were riot ripe): almonds, apples, and plumbs come to perfeftion here in their proper feafons. The quinces, figs, Pomegranates, and MoJJungs (a fruit not much unlike a very fmall apple, but of a dif ferent fpecies) were not ripe, though mufk-melons and cucumbers were. We obferved alfo a very large fort of fervice-berry, and fome olive trees. In the afternoon, feveral 'Turkijh and Armenian merchants delired leave to go in company with us, which we readily granted. Aga Mahomet or Hamet, whom they call Aetch Aga, carries with him orders from Solyman Bajha, for all governors and captains between this place and Aleppo-, alfo four recommendatory letters from him to the Bajha's of Moful, Diarbekir, Urfa and Aleppo ; four others from Abdulla the Kahier or prime fecretary, to the four Kahiers of thole Bajhas. The four letters for the Bajhds were put into white purfes, thofe for the Kahiers into red ones. Mr. Garden and Cojee Raphael recommended it to us, to prefent the Aga with 500 piaftres at parting, fhould he bfehave properly^ They like- wife wifh that t\\z Britijh conful zx. Aleppo would write a letter by the returri; of the Aga to the Bajha of Baghdad, ackno\vledgihg his favours to us.. Had we been merchants inftead of king's fe'rvants, we were told, we ftiould not have met with fuch honours •, or have been permitted to travel in Takht Revans, or have carried a gilt ball on the top of our tent, none but the BaJJoa himfelf being allowed this laft privilege. While we con tinued on this fpot, the Bajha difebvered oiir gilt ball from his Seraglio,. and immediately enquired whofe it was : upon being told, that it belonged to the tent of the Englijh travellers, he very obligingly replied, ' Take no notice of it' As foon as we were informed of his politenefs,, we imme- ordered the ball to be taken down* ^ Monday June 19,, H BHB[ 304 ] At feven c/dock in the evening we flruck our tents, took leave of our worthy friend Mr. Garden, and Cojee Raphael, and at nine got up to Kuli Khan's towers and entrenchments, railed during his fiege of Baghdad, to prevent the garrifon's receiving any relief from this fide of the country. Thefe towers are eleven in number, and now fomewhat decayed ; they are 'built of brick, have holes formufketry, and (land at about five hun dred yards from each other. At half paft two this morning we got to Tainkjah, having pafled over fome fields of wheat-ftubble; and in an hour after arrived at another town . called Dokehalab, where we continued till the evening. The latitude of Dokehalah, by obfervation, is 33 0 43' north. Around both thefe towns are plenty of gardens (inclofed with mud-walls) which fupply the city of Baghdad with vegetables and fruit. We put up at a clean, mud-built houfe, one of the beft the place afforded. Our Aga, who was not under the fame roof with us, came and paid us his compliments. He appeared to be a fenfible grave man, of few words, .yet can handfomely exprels himfelf on particular occafions. We agreed before we fet off, that he Ihould fupply himfelf, as well as his own three horfemen and their cattle with provifions, at our expence •, and we now commiflioned him to ferve our Takht Revan men with their provifions, being defirous not to have any difputes with them on that fubjed. At half paft fix in the evening, we mounted our horfes and mules, but it was almoft feven before we could fet off' with our little Caravan* We took an eaftward courfe for about an hour and half, which brought us to a bridge, thrown over one of thofe little rivulets, which run into the Tygris. We pafled over the bridge, and then travelled north. Very many people were going the road to Baghdad. One party had a Caravan, which confided of 2 or 300 beafts, camels, mules, and affes, loaded with flraw-fodder for the Bajha's ftables. Until half paft ten we marched over a dead level country, fave here and there we met with a hill of fand, blown together by the wind. We paffed alfo feveral creeks which had fma!l bridges over them thefe creeks are a kind of artificial rivulets, cut purpolely to fupply the adjacent villages with water from the Tygris. This great river is now to the left, or the weft of us, and appears fometimes two or three miles off, at others not more than half a mile. About eleven we came to a large hill, which in this level country might be juftly called a mountain; it feemed by moon-light, to extend a great way to the eaft- ward. 1 o the right of the high road hereabouts, I was informed, there are feveral fmall towns, that the land is cultivated around them, and the rivulets afore-mentioned ferve them with water. Now I got into one of the Takht Revan's for the firft time, of whofe untoward motion we had re ceived a difagreeable account from our European fervants, but which was not fo bad as to hinder me from taking a fhort fleep. Ac[ 305 1 / At one In the morning we arrived at pur fecond fhge Kaun-Mufahah, xyrSt latitude 33 0 58' north, where we pitched our tents, and lay in them; The Caravanferah here is old and not kept clean. Our Aga would have procured r J ulie 21 us a houfe in the village if we had chofen it. About nine o'clock, two par- k:aun * Mi - ties with camels and afles came in from Confiantinople, and put up at the Caravanferah', they were accompanied by a few horfemen, who had been robbed and wounded to the northward of MofuL The evenings and nights are pleafantly cool, but the days very hot. We get mutton,; milk, and grapes. We ate pretty freely yefterday of the lafl:, but as fome of us had fymptoms of a Biarrhcea's coming on, we denied our- felves to-day, and fed on milk. Few of us have any appetite for meat, fo that little is ufed. Yeilerday we allowed ourfelves one bottle of Madeira wine, and the fame quantity at night. At feven o'clock this evening we fet off, and travelled rather eafterly for about two hours, when we croffed a pretty good bridge over a creek of the Tygris, and then went north; paffed through fome fields of corn-ftubble, and about eleven, over a good ftone bridge built acrofs a river called (according to the found of the word as pronounced by our country fervants) Chiba Harpjie, which they tell us, rifes in Perfta, and falls into the Tygris. Chiba At a quarter of a mile diilance to the right of this river, is a handfome Harpsie. new Kaun or Caravanferah r and the ruins of an old one. It is called Souhah-Kauti) or Chibach Couprie, that is, Chihach Bridge. The Aga obferv- ing that we were defirous of feeing every thing that was remarkable, pro- poled riding up to it, which we did. The late Bajha Hamet performed a very gallant aflion near this fpor, killing with his lance a lion which for three years had been the terror of the whole neighbourhood : they fay, that his horfe in its violent exertions ®n the occafion, burft afunder, he then mounted a mare, which as fome relate, kicked the lyonon the head, and ftunned him; by this lucky circum- ftance the Bafha had an opportunity of plunging his lance into his belly s and laying him dead at his feet, At three this morning, we patted over another (lone bridge of two arches, June 22. after travelling eight hours, and pitched our tents by the Caravanjerah of Dely-abafs-touprie, which by an obfervation taken by Mr. JDoidge, lies in abasTcou latitude 34 0 id ' north. This Kaun is but a forry one; we got to it a prieKauk little after three in the morning, but found other travellers in pofleflion. We again repofed under our tents, having experienced this day and yefter day, to be violently hot; the hotteft indeed I had ever felt, and to me almoft infupportable, taking away the appetite, and producing an exceffive third: my fellow travellers however could eat a bit of mutton, and fup a little broth, which is more than 1 can attempt. R r At[ 3 o6 ] 175S. At fome ^diftance np the river is a village, from whence we got good «-—y—milk, buc no fruit. In our journey for the two laft ftages, we obferved locuils in great abundance ; the foil was well cultivated and fertile, by means of the river-water being let in. We paffed many travellers, among others, the prefent Bajba of Kircoote, who for fome mifdemeanour had fallen under the Grand Seignior's dilplealure. lie is going to Baghdad to get Solyman Bajha to intercede for him. At feven in the evening, we mounted again, with our arms; it being thought expedient to be well on our guard, until we have paflfed fome Kufcadawrie mountains in fight, called Kufcadawrie^ often infefted by robbers. Now Mountains. W e drew lots, and fettled our turns in the 'Takht Revans ; and as Menienrs Pye and PigQt, the two lighteft men, ride together in one, we are alternately, on and off our horfes or mules, every two hours. The motion of thefe vehicles is uneafy ; yet, not to fo great a degree as to prevent wearied travellers from getting a little fleep, which, though broken and interrupted, we find to be of great benefit. The heat of this day has been beyond meafure fatiguing. I intended to have proceeded to, and parted over the mountains on horfe-back with my arms •, but foon became fo faint and weak, as to be obliged to difmount, and betake myfelf to the Takht Revan, 'till nine o'clock, when 1 remounted at the foot of the hills with fome degree of fpirits, and fo travelled on till eleven, amidft romantic, craggy, flinty rocks, formed very advantageoufly for giving a few robbers an opportunity of attacking a gueat number of paflengers: but fortunately none prefented themfelves. At twelve we got on. the other fide of the hills, into a well cultivated valley, where were corn-ftubbles. This vale is flooded at the difcretion of the Narin river, farmer, by a little river which we paflfed over, called Narin, whofe water is very brackifh, owing to the fait petre, with which the foil abounds. June 23. K aratapa About two in the morning, as we marched on, we difcovered a fmall village to the left, inhabited by the hufbandmen of the arable lands i we diftinguifhed it by the lights, and barking of dogs. At four, we got near the town Karatapa, lying, by Mr. obfervation, in 34° N. latitude v but our mulateers miftaking the road, it was half paft five before we reached it. The Aga advanced before, and at our entrance met us, enquiring whe ther it was our pleafure to pitch our tents, or put up in an houfe; we chofe the latter, and were fhewn to the chief's, wherein were prepared two or three well fwept apartments, with carpets and culhions laid on the ground. This is a good looking Turhjh country town, built with mud •, it {lands on an eminence, and the ftreets are broader than any I have feen in Turky. The inhabitants were more fwarthy than thofe of Baghdad^ owing, probably 5 IQ I t:eTe m stnorij [e-back wiil 11 ed to difre; hen 1 reinoffi advant^i i, in an r 307 ] to their working in the fields and gardens; here are many gardens, and yet n tr&amp;r nrv fniif ' tS ' ^ lifclJ r we can S et no In this town of Karafapa are hundreds of Slcrks ; you fee them almoft jr 0 - l? on every houfe, in every garden, and on the walls and trees. They feem to think themfelves in great fecurity, are in no kind of fear at the fi ^ht or approach of man or beaft. They had three or more young ones in' their nefts. The old birds make a very odd noife with their beaks, not unlike ams ;itfc that of the Negroes mufical finger-cracker. When this is doing, the w paiHijj head is turned backward, and the upper bill placed on the rump, while ro bber&gt;. the under is fet into the quickeft motion, and made to ad upon the md as Mstj! other: this bird's beak is eight or nine inches in length like that of the e are alter, Pelican, and of the fame ftiape ; there is alfo a fmall red bag hanging at; morioorftiii the throat. prevent ftnei _ ■ _ andinteimp^ The houfe we refide in belongs to the Sheick of the village, who cleared it of his women, and had it cleaned on our account. The walls are very thick, whereby the heat is much lefs diftrefling than in the two preceding I intrir i days. The water here would have been good, had it been firft fined, but this our fervants carelefly negleded : we find by experience, that half an ounce of the powder of Alum, thrown into 12 or 14 gallons of muddy water, will in an hour and half make it perfedly clear; learning this before we left Bajfora^ we there fupplied ourfelves with a fufficiency of Alum for thefe ufes. We found no inconvenience from the Alum, and I am inclined to think that it is not only an excellent purifier of thick muddy water, but that in hot climates, it cools the body and braces up the relaxed fibres. At m R ^ At fix this evening, the weather was cloudy, which we very feldom had an opportunity of noting before •, the air fince we left Bajfora, has been very d ^ i: : : dry, a few nights on the Euphrates excepted. The primings to our fire- whicli tk t locks and piftols were never damp. Our Aga here acquainted us, that he thought it proper to take with us the armed men of the place, and if we approved of it, he would fpeak to the Commandant to be ready to march. Covered3(By virtue of his order from the Bajha he could command this •, neverthelefs a pecuniary fatisfaftion from us will be ©xpeded). We contented, and at ir we goi^ feven fet out with our guard confifting of an officer and 12 horfemen equip- : o i^: ped with piftols and lances. r, [jpi On our left were the ruins of fome houfes and at a quarter after feven a e Chocarda who rode poft, pafled us, accompanied with two horfemen fervants; they were from Moful going to Baghdad, and their news was, that the Bafha from Aleppo was expeded at Mojul next Monday, and that two Caravans were ftill detained there. At half paft eight, there fell a fliower of la^gc drops of rain ; a fliort but acceptable refrefhmejit to fuch thirfty, panting ve wretches as we are. ,0^ - R r 2 At[ 3°8 ]' At twelve we crofled another river (which they called Irke the laft, Narin) on a little paltry bridge. AH this night we travelled over a hilly, ftony uncultivated country, until about half a mile before we reached Afkee-couprie to which place we got at half paft two in the morning. Here we fotm i the Sheick's houfe ready to receive us, the Aga having advanced before for that purpofe. This village lies by obfervation in 34 0 50' north latitude; is built on an hill, hath rivulets running by it, the water of which is very clear and good. We could get no fruit here unlefs the Bo&amp;herry, but were told, that at the next ftage we fhall get fruit, as well as wine ^ both will be very acceptable. The want of the firft we judge to have been the caufe of our beiny; all pain fully conftipated ; and the ftock of wines laid in at Calcutta and Bombay, is ex pended or deftroyed to about three dozen of bottles. Our ^77 indeed puts us to no expence for wine or ftrong liquors-, he drinks only coffee, fherbetand water: a man every way different from our Bajfora Ckocarda. Twenty Piaflres were given to the Commandant for himfelf and the troop which efcorted us hither-, and as the Caravan for Moful had been lately rob bed between this fpot and Kircoote, the Aga recommended our taking another guard ; he behaves with great care and modefty, and aflured us^ in a very pleafmg rranner, that his only ftudy is that of our eafe and fafety. We hope he is a Turk of honour, and lb fubmit ourfelves to his difcretion. , We faw this morning in the air, a prodigious quantity of very fmall bats, and about noon we obferved thoufands of them clinging to the rafters of our houfe. We fptnt this day comfortably, compared with fome that were paft, chiefly owing to our being in a houfe. Our tents are made of canvas, well painted, lined with chintz, and have alfo a marquis; but a v painted tent like our's, is better calculated to refift the rain than the heat and could we have fortleen that we fhould have come a road, where we hitherto have found plenty of water, a common canvas tent would have better anfwered our end ; as in the heat of the day, we might have kept it conftamly wetted with water, which is altogether imprafticable with thofe we now have. The wind blows generally frefh, but fo loaded with burning particles of fand, that we find it more for our refrefhment to follow the Eaft India cuftom of ihutting it out, than admitting it to us. . A l'' 16 before fon-fct, we began to march ; our little Caravan is now increaled, leveral travellers going our way having joined us for protedlion. it conTirrs or our own three horfes, and twenty five mules, there ought to ave been thirty, in exenfe for the deficiency, the mulateer pretends that although we agreed for eight mules to our two Takht Revans, and two to olu cages, yet trom cullom, there Ibould be but fo-ur for the firft, and one or the lair, and that Cojee Raphael knew of this cuftom, and agreed to thewtlDJil It ii I 309 ] the obferving It: we have now no remedy, unlefs at Aleppo. To our Cara van, muft be added our Agds^ and his three fervants horfes, eight horle- guards, and near 30 muies or a fifes. The moon not rifing till late, the Takbt Revavs were preceded by two great lights, placed in iron (loves, and carried by Turkijh fervants. AH this night, we travelled a W. N. W. courfe, having, not far to our right, a chain of high, rocky mountains, which are called Courmaratida* Courmaratida among which are ruins of ancient fortreffes, but now without inhabitants; Mountains, and on the top of three or four of the mountains are fome decayed tur rets built by Kuli Khan. Thefe mountains ftand about N. W. and S. E. they continued near to us without any break, till three in the June 25. morning, when we arrived in the neighbourhood of Douzcourmatee. Here D ouzcour- the mountains ceafe for a while, and a valley begins, through which run MATEE&gt; many little rivers; we pafled over five or fix by bridges of one and two arches. To within a quarter of a mile of this town, the whole night's journey was barren and uncultivated, when we came upon fome corn- ftubble, in which were abundance of Locujls: many thoufands of them muft be deftroyed by the trampling of our cattle •, but their numbers not- withftanding, fall vaftly lliort of what I faw in Madagafcar, where the air hath been fo full of them, that a man could not be diftinguifhed at the diftance of a hundred yards. Douzcourmatee is compofed of good mud houfes, the gardens arc well walled, and yield dates, apricots, apples and grapes, the latter not ripe. The feverity of the laft winter had fpoiled many of the vines, but we were told, that commonly, good wine is to be found in this place. The Aga, as ufual, went before, and got a room ready for our reception. We procured fome good milk, a lamb, very fine apples, and cucum bers. Laft night the wind was high, and moft difagreeably hot and dry ing ; I fpoke to our hoft of the iuffacating effecl which I experienced from it, and he told me to confider it as a fhoit and flight Vint of the- S ami el. This mornh'Tg, we obferved many women of the village very bufy in fupplying their fafoiftes Wh water from the running ftreams, at the foot of the hills, in earthen pitchers. Two men of confiderable confequence, vifited us ; the governor of the place and country adjacent, was one of them, and Who is a near relation of the Bajhn of Diarbekir, a handfoma man of thirty years of age ; the other was the Commandant of a thoufand of Brfoa Solyman\ forces, which are maintained here. Our Aga confulted them on the ftafe of the country we are to pafs through the following night, and learned that k is not altogether peaceable, for very lately a courier of the hejha of Baghdad accompanied with fixer eight other horfernen, had been at tacked by fome Arabs: we therefore refolved to take 15 foot foldiers, and that the[ 3'° 1 j ^ -g the Shekk who lives at fome diftance in our road, fhould join us with 15 Arah^ 1 who would be of more fervice to us than' a greater number of any other kind, as Arabs do not ufually fight v\\.\\Arahs but this order is difcretional, and left to the Sheick to decline executing, provided he fhall be convinced that the road is not infefted. Monday We fet off at feven in the evening as ufual, and without any moleftation June 26. got to Tawook, in 35 0 io ' north latitude, about half paft two in the morn ing, having had for two thirds of the way, mountains at a fmall diftance on our right, but for the laft part of our journey, they were farther from us, inclining more to the eaftward of the north : when we were only about a mile from the village they were almoft out of fight, and a plain, or ex- tenfive vale fucceeded, through which paffed many a rivulet of good water j over one of them was a water-mill at work. This village is but a forry one, feated on a hill i we got to it over a very ilony road : the adjacent country was rude and barren, if we except a very few ftubble acres. The inhabitants of Tawook breed filk-worms, and weave a filk, which they fend for fale to the merchants of Baghdad, and other towns. We were riot fo well off here for lodgings, as of late, yet thofe we have are much lefs difagreeable than a tent, and are the belt the place affords: they belonged to a private man whofe wives were obliged to move out •, we faw them in the yard, nor did they feem to take much pains to conceal their faces. But this was not the firft country village fince we left Bagh- dad, where we noticed the women to be little fcrupulous in this re- fpeft. Two or three females are our fellow-travellers-, they ride aftride their mules, but with the black horfe-hair covering over their faces; and as the cuftom of the country forbids us even to look at, much lefs to fpeak to them, we remain entire ftrangers to each other, nor can we gratify our inclinations by complimenting them in any refped whatever. Mr. Sbaw, who has refided many years among the people of Turky, affured me, it was not only the higheft affront you could poflibly fliew a Turk to enquire for the healdi of the female part of his family, but that it was efteemed very rude even to mention the name of any of the fair fex. The laft night was very pleafant, the air cool and ferene, which, thank God, continues even now, though twelve at noon. Five Turks with high caps on their heads, and armed, paffed us juft now on horfeback, and alfo a fmall caravan with about 12 camels and 20 affes loaded with tobacco, which probably was under the protection of thefe high cap gentlemen. AYitR[ 3' ] With the fame fellow-travellers as yefterday, and about 'fifteen foot fol- diers taken from hence, we began our march at feven in the evening, and ■continued advancing over barren ground far the village Tazalcomatoor^ until we got oppofice to it. We then ftruck off to the right, travelling more north, diredly for Kirccote-, taking care not to touch at'the firil men tioned village. By this condud, they fay, we lave a two hour's journey. Until we got within four or five miles of Kircoote, we p.afied nothincr but uncultivated ftony lands; but then all was arable to the city, and forlfome miles around was a fine plain. We reached Kircoote, which lies in 35 0 30' of north latitude, at four in the morning, and pa fled by the town and citadel to a houfe which had been provided for us, at a little diftance from the town. The fort is of an oblong figure, fituated on a high artificial mount, which in the rainy leafon is by the run of waters from the neighbouring mountains, made an illand. About fifteen years ago. Nadir Shah took it after a fiege of 24 days: an old Turkijh gentleman of the place informed me, that the citadel was defended by the inhabitants unafTifted by the foldiery ; about 5000 were in arms, nor did they furrender but on honourable terms; their properties were fecured to trhem, only a grant of provifions for the Per/tan army was agreed to. Kuli Khan conformed himfelf to the letter of the capitulation, till he returned from his uniuccefsful expedition againft Moful, and no longer ; for he then levied heavy contributions, and on the approach of the Turkifo army, retired, taking with him as much money as he could get from the inhabitants, as well as goods and effeds for the ufe of his army. A little to the louthward of the town he ftored a magazine with corn and other pro- vifions •, thefe, he could not conveniently take away, nor would he deftroy them, but left them to fall into the hands of his enemy. During the fiege of the citadel, near 500 of the defenders were killed, and the people in general were very much fatigued and diftrefied. To the eailward ot the city mount, is the tomb of the Turkijh BaJJoa Hojfein, who was WOunded in the battle of Derhent by a mufket ball from Nadir Shah's, army, and then put to death by the fabre of a mercilefs Ferfian foldier; for which difhonourable and inhuman aft, the Shah ordered him im mediately to be executed, and fent the body of the Bajhu hither to be honourably interred j this incident happened a fhort time before the cap ture of Kir coot e* The inhabitants in general, are maintaiifed by agriculture, the lands here abouts being very fertile i large quantities of corn are fent from hence to foreign markets : the mechanics, fuch as taylors, fhoemakers, &amp;c. live as in other places, by their induftry.

This fpot belongs to the chief of the Mahometan pricfts i our Ago. had rode on before, and obtained permiffion of the governor and prieil for our admittance. We made a Ihort repalt, and about five, threw ourfelves down on our cots. At nine in the morning, the governor, the Mujj'alem or captain of the fort, and commanding Janizary, with two or three of the prin cipal officers, came to vifit us ; as we were not rifen, they ftayed fome little time with the prieft, and our Aga, and then went away leaving their com pliments. The real governor of Kircoote is a Bajha of two tails, who at prefent was in difgrace, as juif obferved ; the gentleman who aded in his abfence is only pro tempore. At four in the afternoon, Mr. Dcidge and I returned the vifit, accom panied by the Aga, an interpreter, and two other fervants. We were re ceived with high marks of refpeft j ftools with cufhions both for our feats, and feet, were placed on the right-hand fide of the governor. The gover nor received us after the common cuftom in Turky, fitting on his carpet, but politely bending his body, and bringing his hand up to his breaft; and after we were feated, he paft fome handfome compliments, and gave us an invitation to tarry four or five days for our refrefhment, afiuring us that after having entertained us in the beft manner in his power, he would take care that at our departure, we fhould be very well efcorted. We excufed ourfelvcs from tarrying, but thanked him for his polite offer. On his left hand, fat eight or ten of the principal Turks of the place; moft of them were very perfonable, as indeed the Turks in general are, both as to ftature and comelinefs, adorned with full, large, piercing black eyes, and arched eye brows. Curionty had brought about the court-yard where we were en tertained, a great number of fpedtators, who had never before feen an Eu ropean habit. We enquired among other things, concerning the prefenc ftate of affairs in Perfia, but could not find that they had any late accounts. It v/as obierved during the converfation, that unhappy kingdom had not only been made miferable for many years paft through the Iword, but by the plague y which occafioned me to fay that thefe two were the greateft of human curies; on which the governor gravely replied, 'they are not oi Many but of Cod' In the evening, our party, in company with three or four priefts, fpent an hour or two on the fide of the pond, into which continually flowed feveral pleafant rivulets. The Chief Prieji, who feemed to have an haughty fpirit, informed me, that within the fort was preferved the tomb of the ChrijHan St. Dennis, buried here at the time when Chrijlians had pofiefiions in th'fs country. No fooner had he concluded, than, very abruptly, he by the in terpreter, put to me tht following queftion ; ' Since we Mujfulmen have in c theUntei ' the higheft regard all the Prophets, whom Chriftians revere ; and fince wc « even greatly honour and refped the name of Jefus Chrifl, how comes it ' that you Chriftians, pay no regard at all to our Prophet ?' Defirous of avoiding to enter on what I efteemed a dangerous lubjeft, I laid, tc That as we were not priefts, but men whole bufinefs was to ierve their King and 44 country by fea, fuch religious matters did not naturally fall under our ' confideration.' This anfwer did not prove fatisfaftory, for the prieft re peated the queftion with an uncommon earneftnefs •, to whicu I anf^ered, ' That there were not wanting among Chriftians, men, who paid fome at- ' tention to the memory of Mahomet, on account of the charitable maxims ' he inculcated •, and the temperance and fobriety which he fo ftridly en- ' joined his followers.' He muttered to himfelf, but faid no more. I afterwards bathed in the prieft's rivulet, under the (hade of the willows ; which brought to my remembrance, the fatisfadion I had formerly enjoyed of the fame kind in the plealant ft ream of the Avon. The Aga judged it proper to reft this day here, both for the relief of men and beafts : the heat to-day and yefterday, though great, hath yet been tolerable j the nights are agreeably cool, and have continued fo during our whole journey. Agreeable to advice given us before we entered Turky, we all decline having the leaft pretence to phyfical or chirurgical knowledge ; for otherwife, our lodgings from morning to night would be crowded with patients: as it is, there are many who apply to us and a(k queftions, but we do not forget to let them know, we fpeak from hearfay only. Storks are here in abundance. We have heard no finging birds, except the lark, fince we left the Euphrates, Yefterday, for the firft time fince 1 left England, I faw a magpye. We find here a troublefome biting gnat, or Mufcheto, different from all others, in that it makes no buzzing noife upon its approach. At fix in the evening we mounted our bcafts, accompanied by the Muf~ felem and Jlga •, we fet out earlier than ufual, in order to fee the fort; three or 400 boys followed us, who were very rude, and proceeded even to throw ftones at us, which behaviour gave the Aga znd MuJfelem a great deal of vexation. We afcended the hill on horfe-back, and fo entered the ciradel; rode through a Bazar, and feveral narrow ftreets. The length of the fort was about 250 yards, breadth 120; the hill it is upon, together with the wall, is about 80 feet high : a work of great labour, confifting of earth and fmall ftones well rammed. We faw no cannon, nor any regular baftions ; the ftrength of the place depends on its fituation, and capability of being' defended with ftones and mufketry. Many common trades are carried on by the inhabitants within the fort. We faw feveral of their women, whofe curiofity had led them to the tops of their houfes to view the Franks. We were conduced to a Mofque with a Minaret, and there were defired to difmount; which we did, following the example of our Aga ; we were then bade to S f pull 1758. June 2S. ms0m ,V j m IMmIII[ SH ] pull off our boots, before we entered the church to fee the tomb of St. Dennis: as we had received no intimation that any fuch honour as feeinw i- Mofque was intended us, and not knowing that Chriftians were ever per mitted to enter, we hefitated, and ordered it to be intimated to the Caliph who was there, that we had always underftood that none but thofeofthe Mahometan faith were allowed to go into their churches, and that our curiofity was fufficiently fatisfied, defiring that we might do nothing irre gular. He replied, it was true that Chriftians, inhabitants of the country, were not allowed to enter, but as we were travelling gentlemen, and Chriftian Saints were depofited here, they wifhed to oblige us, and provided we left our boots without, there was nothing that hindred our admifllon. We ftill doubted of the propriety of the ftep, and were the more uneafy about it by an incident which had happened between Mr. Pigot and the Chief Prieft. On this critical occafion we looked round, but could not for the crowd difcover our ylga\ we then made the interpreter call aloud for him, and agreed he fhould be afked, if there was nothing improper in the thing propofed, and whether we ran any rifk in complying: he, with great feriouf- nefs Ipoke to the prieft and Mujfelem, and after receiving their anfwers, he told us, ' No.' We then defired that he himfelf fhould fhew us the wayv accordingly he pulled off his boots, and entered tht Mofque we did the fame, and found it a neat little building without painting, or other orna ments ; it had a fmall pulpit fomewhat raifed, and two tombs railed round,, in which they told us were the remains of two ancient holy Chriftians \ one of them they called Saint Dennis, the other we could not make our, they faid either Hofea or Ifaiah. I afked, if they were fure it was not the tomb of a5^0; inftead of a Chriftian? Was anfwered, no Jew, but a Chrif tian. Within the railing were the coffins of the dead, but as thefe were covered, our curiofity carried us no farther. The prieft of the Mofque fprinkled us with rofe-water, and threw fome on our handkerchiefs; and then we withdrew to the porch, where he afked us for a prefent, which we ordered our fervant to give him. We put on our boots, mounted our horfes, and rode out of the fort to follow the Caravan, which had already began its march. We had great reafon to believe, that the prieft had fixed his eye upon Mr. Pigot, a handlome youth of about twenty, to make a convert of him; for he took Icveral occafions to go to him, whilft he lay on his cot in a (hady retreat, and endeavoured this very afternoon to make him repeat after him feme Turkifh^ fentences, which Mr. Pigot, unfufpicious of danger, attempted to do: the prieft took him by the hand, and directed him to ftand (as Mr. Pigot underftood rather by his motions than words) inftead of continuing to lie at length on his cot: Francifco, one of our country fervants, z Maronite Chrif tian, and born zx. Aleppo, paffing by and hearing him repeat the words il Allah, Muhamed refold Allah,' which fignified, a declaration of the exif- tence ot one God, and ot Mahomet being his true Prophet, called to Mr. Pigot, and defired him not to repeat them; he then ran to me, defiring with tears inM wp—i— ■■Mai ■gwwMHwiui t S'S I his eyes, that I would enjoin the young gentleman not to fuflfer himfelf any 175^ more to be thus exercifed, for the prieil was attempting to convert him to u--y—- Mahometanifm ; adding, he knew an inftance of it at Smyrna, where an unwary perfon having been taught the like words, the meaning of which he did not underftand, and enticed to repeat them before proper witneffes, found himfelf under a neceffity of undergoing the other ceremonies, as ablu tion, circumcifion, &amp;c. which are always the appendages of converfion. This fervant fince afllired me, that the Chief Prieft did then and often afterwards highly abufe him for having intermeddled i adding, that he was now grown old, muft die foon, and would go to hell, unlefs he embraced the true faith. On our leaving the prieft's houfe, we defired his acceptance of fome raw coffee, and half a dozen of china coffee-cups which our Ago, had recommended as the moft agreeable prefent we could make. We fent it by Francifco, with our thanks for his civilities; he received it with a con- fequential air, but thanked us, and with a high founding voice, faid, ' He hoped before long we Ihould all become true Mujfulmen' We took with us from Kircoote 1 5 armed men, and travelled over a June 29. trad, rocky, and perfedly barren, till after four o'clock in the morning, when we met with fome ground which had here and there a cultivated fpot. At half paft four, we rode by a miferably looking village on our left; it extended to a new bridge of one high arch, which was of fo difficult an afcent, that we judged it fafeft to difmount. This bridge was built at the expence of the reigning Bajha of Baghdad, the old one being in ruins ; two arches of it ftill remain at a little diftance from the new bridge, which is about 45 feet high, and very narrrow. Having pafTed a little river by this bridge, we came to a fmall town called Alton-Couprie. The river hath A lton- its fource in the high Courdiftan mountains, which we now faw to the right Couprie. before us, whofe tops are partly covered with fnow, and empties itfelf into the Tygris. The old bridge here, they tell us was built by the ancient Chriftians, to whom the town formerly belonged. The river abounds with fifh, and we got fome fine carpj there are fome we were told which weigh 200 pounds. We pitched our tents on an eminence, fomewhat to the northward of the town, and for want of a houfe, continued in them the whole day. Here I again experienced the weather to be unfpeakably hot and diftreffing. We have to rejoice however that our good fortune brought us this way, and did not fuffer us to go by that of the Great Defert. Dreadful is the heat even here ! but how much more muft it have been in the other road, where we (hould ever have been in want of a houfe and vegetables, and never have had a plenty of water. In our way hither, we faw a large ftone bomb-fhell, which our guard told us was one of Kuli Khan's \ we met alfo a little Caravan, four days from Moful: they confirmed the account we before received of the Bajhafs being expected there in four or five days, and that the two great Caravans waited for an efcort. S f 2 To[ 3 16 ] 1758. . To-day we got a fine water-melon, and two or three ordinary mnfk- '—v—' melons. This town has not any manufadure, the people live by what they get from paflengers who go through it, and by the produce of their agri culture. The country in general is hilly, not to fpeak of the before- mentioned Courdijian mountains, which appear to me to run about N. N. W and S. S. E. Thefe, and the Sanjack mountains oppofite to them, are the retreating places of the common robbers of the country, who always attack luch parties ot travellers, as they think are unable to refifl them. Here are many ftorks; thefe birds feaft on flugs, worms, &amp;c. which they find in the corn-fields, and fometimes on ferpents i at leaft we were credibly informed fo. ; At the common hour, (feven in the evening) we decamped from Alton- Coupne, and took with us 30 foot foldiers. We travelled the whole night in a pleafant, cool air, and without the leaft moleftation; our puard according to their ufual cuftom, firing now and then a mufket, in terrorem-. country like what we have lo long travelled over, is ilony and uncul tivated, afiording only wild fhrubs and thiftles; of the laft there are ^reat quantities, and a vaib variety, from the fize of a middling artichoke to June 30. that of the fmalleft rofe-bud. At one in the morning, we got to Temec Yengeekaun. Raun, which is a good building, (landing by itfelf, and weif adapted for the reception of travellers. Here our Takht Rsvan-gee and Mocah or head mulateer would have put up, but were oppofcd by us and the A?a: they pleaded that both men and beafts were tired, and that we were at too great diftance to think of proceeding to Arvele. The debate continued for ome time, till at length we prevailed; and purfuing our journey through the lame kind of country, without any thing remarkable happening, we came in fight of the high fort of ArveU about five in the mornino- *. o This fort is built like that zt.

At half paft four we faw a hare, and foon after j u iy 1. got to a river called Zarp^ which we paffed on Kellecks *. We had but ^arp River, a little way to walk on the other fide, before we arrived at a comfortable clean houfe, near a town called Zaave, in which we continued the whole day ; Z aave. and there heard by an Aga from Moful, of the new Bafhas arrival, and that the Caravan would let out next ihurfday^ with 40 flags, or about 1000 foldiers. Our Aga had fome trouble here to make the captain of the foldiery attend us with a guard to Moful. He at firft abfolutely refufed, and even when he feemed to confent, he made fuch an exorbitant demand tor his at tendance, that our leader could not comply with it, but pofitively told him, that if he perflfted in his conduct, he would immediately difpatch a mef- fenger to Bajha Solyman, and wait either here, or at Mcful, for his anfwer aflfuring him moreover that he would oblige him to give his refufal under his hand. The captain was greatly alarmed at this, and after fome reflec tion, agreed to go with us, on the promife of 25 Fiafires for himfelf and 12 men accoutred with lances and piftols. This captain is iufpefted ot. being privately concerned with the robbers in the neighbouring mt-untains y and that either for his aftual afliftance, or certain connivances, he fhares with them in all the plunder they get between this place and Moful: but this my informer faid, was no wonder, fince this very man and all the in habitants of the village, pay adoration to the Devil. I did not give credit to this report at firft, but afterwards was aflured by Padre Lanza a miflionary at Moful, that it was very true, and that there are many more of the fame religion in this country. The Sanjacks in par ticular are of the number. Thefe people once proteflfed Chrijiianity, then Mahomelanifm, and laft of all BeviUfm. Yet even now, according to the Padre, they will in their greateft diftreflTes, call out J ejus, J'efus! I hele people fay, 'tis true that the Devil has at prefent a quarrel with God-, but the time will come when the pride of his heart being iubdued, he will make his fubmiflion to the Almighty and as the Deity cannot be implacable, the Devil will receive a full pardon for all his paft tranfgreffions, and he, and all thofe who paid him attention during his difgrace, will be admitted into the blefifed manfions. This is the foundation of their hope i and this chance for heaven they efteem to be a better one, than that of trufting to then * Kellecks are made oflheep or goat-fklns blown up; upon thefe, large fticks are laid acrofs,. which make a fort of deck ; they are moved along by two men with paddles. own-C amalisk G a werjcoe [ 318 ] own merits, or the merits of the leader of any other religion whatfoever The perfon of the Devil they look on as facred ♦, and when they affirm anv thing lolemnly, they do it by his name. All difrefpedful expreffions of him, they would punifh with death, did not the Turkijh power prevent them. To (hoe a horfe, in their language, is exprefled by a word that has a double meaning, and may imply a maledidion of the Devil. This ex- prefllon therefore they religiouOy avoid, and have conftituted another for the purpofe. Whenever they fpeak of him, it is with the utmoft refped- and they always put before his name a certain title, correfponding to that of his Htghnefs^ or Lord. At twelve at night we refumed our march, and travelling over the fame lort ot country as of late, with nearly a weft courfe, jwe paffed about three in the morning a Imall river, which takes its rife alio amonaft the Ferfian mountains, and falls into the Tygrh. About five o'clock we got to a poor town, inhabited by Chrijiians, called Camalifk Gawerkoe, which, I was told, means Chrijlian Gawerkoe. The chief of it informed me, that it was once a city, the teat of a Chaldean bifliop, and larger than Moful is at prelent, but that it iuffered great persecution, and was almoft entirely deftroyed when Mahometanifm firft took place in this part of the world. The town has now only about thirty families, defcendants of the orieinal pollefrors. 1 heie, with the other Chrijlians within the Grand Seignior's do minions, are permitted to live in peace, and to enjoy their religion on con dition that they pay extraordinary taxes, and do not attempt to make pro- felites among the Mujfulmen •, a breach of the law in this relbed, being always pumfhed with death. Not a miffionary or Chriftian dares to write or 1 peak to z Turk about religion. Of what utility then can the miHion- anes of the church of Rome be in Turky, in propagating the Chriftian faith, iinlefs we can fuppofe that they are fond of embracing martyrdom ? And ^ 1 ^ not: a f ]n gle inllance can be produced of the converfion of a Mahometan to any other religion, fince the commencement of the Uegira. The inhabitants fubfift by the profits of agriculture, and a fmall /nanufaaure of coarfe linen cloth. They have a church, and four miniflers 01 apas, \\ o are allowed to marry ; they live upon the voluntary contri butions or their flock, and are appointed to their offices by the Chaldean Pa- narc . ole by the town, are the remains of an artificial mount, whereon once ooe citadel •, and within the town, ^a fragment or two of a large cnurt \tt land: heaps of rubbifh are to be leen all around the village, f S , as u Pp n fhe hill. The prelent inhabitants (as we are informed) t le original Chaldean language, as well as the Turkifh and Arabian. At a little diftance from the town, thev fhew you the tomb of St. Bar- ara, v. 0, according to the Papas account, died a martyr by the hand of ner own father, a becaufe Oie perfiftcd to believe in Jefus Chrijt. i ney tell you, that the father's Iword fell to pieces in his hand at the firft 3 attempt[ 2 l 9 J attempt on his daughter's life, that he then burnt her with red-hot pincers, and at lafl cut her into pieces. They likewife tell you, that Sr. Thomas preached the gofpel both at Nineveh, and at this place, in his way to the Eaft Indies. The air this morning was rather fliarp r and not fo ferene as ufual. In the evening, our hod, who is the head-man of the village, led us to the tomb of St. Barbara, which had been alfo her prifon. It is placed at the foot of the hill, whereon had Hood the citadel, and the King's palace. Her father, as our conduftor told us, was prime-minifter to the King, and made ufe of the royal authority, as well as his own, to bri^g his daughter back from Chriftianity to the worfhip of the Gentile deities; but all in vain, and fo fhe fuffered martyrdom on the account. Her afhes, it is faid, (till remain depofited in the wall of the prifon, on which is a tablet of marble with an mfcription in Chaldean characters, within a circle. The diameter of the circle is about a foot. The infcription was quite perfedt till the time of Nadir Shah, who vifiting the tomb, and apprehending that money was hidden there, ordered the wall to be pulled down, by which fome of the characters were defaced. In the feveral corners of the prifon we obferved other infcriptions in the fame chara^lers •, they too are cut in marble, and relate to the father's treatment of his daughter. Her figure is wretchedly executed in coarfe marble, with a crofs on her bread. Several other croffes are alio drawn and placed about the walls. 'We were afterwards condutled to the church of the prefent Chrijiians i, the face of it affords a finking impreflion of its antiquity: it was built, ac cording to the accounts given us, in the earliefl ages of Chriftianity : it is without painting, has two ailes and a nave. The door of the altar was ihut, but we were told that within was contained the reprefentation of a crucified Jefus: on the right of the altar is the veftry; to the left, the font for baptifm by immerfion : at the weft end of the church are books, and among them the Old and New Teftament, with the church's daily fervice, all in manufcripts of the Syriac and Chaldean charaders. Mr. Dcidge bought of one of the inhabitants, the Old Teftament as he fup- pofed, for the feller called it an hiftory of the Prophets. And one of the Deacons fold me an old manufcript, which on the word of a Chriftian he declared to be the Gcfpel: of the truth of thefe affertions neither of us was in the leaft able to judge, we only intended them as curiofities for our learned friends in England *. The church ftands eaft and weft, and is about 400 yards from the faint's tomb. At fome little diftance to the fouthward of the town, are the ruins * A fpecimen of the MS. purchafed by the author, having been fmce laid before Dodlor Morton and Mr. Ridley of the Royal Society, they both decifively pronounced it to be the old or fimplex Sjriac verfion of the Ne-w Tejiament, An extract hereof is in the annexed place, ofMonday J uI y 3- [ 3 ao ] of a confidcrable church, dedicated to St. John the Evangelift : in the church which they now make ufe of, is a fmall crucifix, brought, fay the Papas, from Jerufalem. This place, as well as Moful, and many others, fuffered extremely laft year through the fcarcity of provifions, but not to fo great a degree as Diarhekir. We ftaid at this village till twelve at night, and then travelled W. b N. without any thing happening worthy of notice till half paft four, when wc got upon arable land, which continued quite to the 'Tygris. About a little after five, we pafled a village on our left, (landing clofe to fome ruins, which are reputed to be thofe of ancient Nineveh. Nigh the high road, is an old building held in great veneration by the Turks and Jews, who verily believe it to be the tomb of the Prophet Jonah, We crofled part of the Tygris on horfe-back, and the other part by a bridge of 19 boats: a little higher up the river, are the decayed arches of an antient ftone bridge. The water of the Tygris is very low here, and far from being rapid. A few days journey farther up, I was told it is much more fliallow, and continues to diminifh until it becomes very fmall, from whence probably its head cannot be far off. At half paft five in the morning, we entered Moful through the gateway facing the river; then turned to the left, and rode quite through the city, encamping a little to the fouthward, without the walls.

While our ^ was vifiting at the palace, we difpatched the biftop of Babylon s letter^ to Padre Lanza, and then repofed ourfelves on our cots.

He invited us to take up our abode at his houfe in the city •, we promifed to be with him fometimes in the day, but be»cred leave to Heep in our tents, becaufe of the (hortnefs of our time. he Caravans for Diarhekir and Aleppo, had but a few hours before our arrival, left the very fpot on which we pitched our tents ; they marched only an halt hour s jouiney, when they again encamped, and there tarry in order to dilcharge the cuiloms due to the government on their merchandifes. Friday next it is expected they will proceed, with an efcort both of horfe and foot. In the evening we were vifited by Padre Trancifco another Car)nelite, lately i_rom Aleppo in the Bajhd's train. He is the BaJ/jd's body phyfician, a poll or honoui, which befides protecting him and his brethren, makes him ^or lome confequence in the country, but produces very little pecuniary T t profit.[ 3 22 3 profit. His houfe indeed is partly fupplied with provifions bythej?^ ; and now and then, though very feldom, he gets a prefcnt of fifty Piajires: Hojfein, like the reft of the great men in Turky, being not only very cove tous, but alfo is of opinion, that any perfon is amply rewarded by having the honour of admittance into his prefence, without receiving any other emolument for his fervices. He is at prefent indifpofed, fo that our Aga has not kifled his fleeve. His Kabier hath promifed us all prote6lion; and on his defiring to know our wants, and being told by the Aga that we defired only his charge to the Caravan-Bajbi, and commander of the troops which accompany the Caravan, to behave properly to us in our march, he afllired the Aga they fhould, and that with the greateft refped, on forfeiture of their heads. Moful* (which by an obfervation taken by us lies in 36° 30' north) is the beft built city in Turky that I have yet feen, but ftill has nothing in it wor thy the notice of an European : its walls and baftions are pretty much out of repair, and have but a bad dry ditch around them ; yet Nadir Shah, although he befieged the place near fix months, could not take it. The prefent Bajha, at that time commanded, and the city was full of brave inhabitants, who one and all refolved to die rather than give it up to the enemy. The latter afiaulted the walls three feveral days fucceffively, but were as often re- pulfed •, the breaches they made in the day were repaired in the night; an uncommon ardor poflfefled the breads of the befieged, even their women and children with the greateft chearfulnefs afiifted in the defence of the city. The Chriftians (who amounted to 10 or 12000 within the walls) be haved fo well, as to gain the efteem and admiration of the other inhabitants. Some of their churches being much damaged during the fiege, were after wards repaired at the expence of the government. The reigning Bajha indeed leans towards the Chrijlians, his grandfather being one, and a prieft ; and he often calls them his relations. He is now 68 years of age, and very infirm. During the fiege, the 'Turks declared publicly, that fhouid the place be forced to furrender, they were determined to put all their wives • ' Mou/uly the capital of a Beglerhegat, ftands on the weft bank of the river in latitude 36 degrees. It is a large city lurrounded with ftone walls, and has many fair ftreets, but withal a great many lying wafte. Tcvvtrnier fpeaks of it as a ruined place, that there are only two blind markets, and a forry caftle, and yet he fays it is much frequented by merchaats, and that its Bajfa commands 3000 men. Here is a bridge of boats over the Tjgris, and the city is a thoroughfare from Perjia to Syria, which makes it a place of trade, and which is more augmented by a conftant traffic from this place to Baghdad. The country on this fide the river is fandy and barren, but over-againft it is exceeding fruitful, and yields them very good crops of corn and divers fruits. This town although fubje&lt;9t to the Turks, and the feat of a Bajha* is moftly inhabited by Neft or i an Chriftians, a people (fays Rauivolf) who though they pretend to be Chriftians, are worie than Turks, for they pradlife many villanies, and ordinarily rob on the highway. This place is commonly called the fucceffor of Nineveh ; it may indeed have been built oat of its ruins, but the fituation is different, for that city Hood on the other fide of the river in Moll's 3 and[ 3 2 3 J' and daughters to death firft, for that they fhould never fall into the vile I 75 8 « hands of the abhorred Perjians. v—-v— About 400 yards without the walls of the city, and for two thirds of its -circuit, is the burial ground. There feems to be but very little difference in the method of the Turks interment and our own : the corpfe is carried (as I had an opportunity of obferving) on a bier, attended by a prieft and the friends of the deceafed ; it is afterwards put into the ground, and a ftone or tomb put over it, agreeable to his circumftances and profeffion. A foldier's tomb has always trophies and military implements placed upon it. The learned world has been much at a lofs to determine the fpot whereon Hood antient Nineveh * •, fome fay near Jonah's tomb juft oppofite to Moful\ others, at another place fome hours journey up the river. Is it not probable that both thefe opinions may be right, and that antient Nineveh took in the whole of this ground ? Geographers defcribe it, as a place of prodigious magnitude and extent, of one hundred and fifty Stadia (or eigh teen miles three quarters) in length, and ninety Stadia (or eleven miles and a quarter) in breadth. Its circumference was four hundred and eighty Stadia^ or fixty miles. Befides this account of heathen writers, the fcripture expreily tells us, that it was a city of three days journey-, and in whatever manner we explain the exprefTion, whether it would take up fo much time to walk round the walls, or to make a regular perambulation through every llreet, it will at leaft ihew that it was a place of vaft extent. It feems there fore probable, that all the cultivated lands which now lie between thefe two ruined places, were once contained within the limits of Nineveh: what confirms me in this conjedure, is, that much of this ground is now hilly, owing no doubt to the rubbifh of the antient buildings. There is one mount of 2 or 300 yards fquare, which (lands fome yards N. E. of Jonah's tomb, whereon, it is likely, a fortification once ftood. It feems to have * Antient Nineveh, built by Ninus, or by Nimrod, and named in honour of Ninus his fon or nephew, ftood on the eaft bank of the Vygris, over againft where Mo/ul now ftands. So en larged by its kings, that it became bigger than Babylon&gt; namely, 480 furlongs, or 60 miles in compafs : the wall 100 feet high, and lo thick as to admit of three chariots to go on it abreaft, and adorned with 1150 towers of zco feet high, which were fo ftrong as to be thought im pregnable : neither had Arbaces after three years fiege taken it, if the river by overflowing had not become its enemy, and broken down 20 furlongs of the wall, thereby fulfilling an old pro phecy, and giving the viftor entrance. To this city the Prophet Jonah was fent to denounce God's judgment, but upon repent ance, it was fpared. Deftroyed afterwards by Ajlyages, the eighth Median king from Arhaces, becaufe of it's fre quent rebellions : and laid fo low in time, that St. Cyril of Alexandria, in the middle of the fifth century, in his comments upon the Prophets fays, the place where it ftood was hardly to b6 difcerned: and at this time nothing of it appears except a heap of rubbifh a league in length. On a hill not far from Mouful, the people fhew the monument of Jonah, which is in great veneration, and has a mofque built over it.' Moll's Geography, T t 2 been[ 3 2 4 ] 1:758. been made by nature, or perhaps by both nature and art, for fuch an ' ufe. In fo large a city there are of courfe many Mofques--, one near the palace is the largeit and moft modern : its top on the outfide, is- ornamented with green tiles. At the door of the Mofgues are ufually infcriptions in ailt letters, declaring the awfulnefs of the building, as being the houfe of God. One of the Mofques hath a Minaret which bends as thofe at Baghdad -, Tome of the moft bigotted of the ¥urks fay, Mahomet faluted it as he paffed, and that the Minaret bent in. reverence to the Prophet. This city's mannfafture is MuJJolen (a cotton cloth) which they make very ftrong, and pretty fine, and fell for the European, as well as other mar kets : agriculture and trade maintain the reft of the inhabitants. We can get no other fruit here than poor water-melons and cucumbers: The laft winter's froft killed their trees. There is not one garden on either fide of the river, that produces any thing valuable. What lirtle fruit the Bajha gets is fent him from Courdijlan, whofe mountains to the N. E, of the city yet fhew their Inowy heads. 1 he bread is good here, and we think not dear, it being about- five farthings per poundbut this may be a very high price for a poor 'Turk. Dreadful, and even incredible are the accounts we daily hear of the calamities of the province of Diarbekir. The countiy, comparatively fpeaking, is now depopulated.. The inhabitants, during the famine, ate dogs, their own dead children, and every other thing whitii manK.ind abhor at another feafon. The bodies of the dead lay in the ftreets for want of people to bury them. This terrible news makes us wiflv that we may be able to avoid feeing the metropolis of that province! the effects of this dearth reached, and in fume meafure ftill continue in, and to the louthward of MofuL The hire of a mule hence to Aleppo, is from 50 to 35 piaftres-, laft year it was no more than 12 : this is one of the ill confequences of the late. readtul famine *, almoft every fpecies of the brute creation having been, ki ed for the fupport of man. This calamitous vifitation is faid to have een entirely owing to a preceding hard winter, and to an innumerable a ™7; 0f Iocufts th ^ deftroyed the fruits of the earth. The inhabitants of ojii were fuppoled, before the famine, to have been 300,000, but, fay l e athers, io many died or quitted the place during that time, that they now do not amount to near that number. They reckon here are about one thoufand Roman Chrijtians, and four thoufand Nefiorians* Jacohines and. Maromtes \ in,the villages around are many more. ply 4. To-day we were vifited by the chief Chrijlian of the city, whofe office is t at o Haram hajhi^ chiei officer of the Haram, or female apartments of 1. /tlie;■ itimf«imuii u uum fl ni lrv nnr [ 1 o .* o D ] t 6 are graVe ' like the ^ a ' d his —pHments of This morning, accompanied by our and we went into the city and fpent the day at the father's houfe, very aareeably • I learned from Padre Franafco vho afts the phyficmn, that the difeafes common here are ardent fevers and bloody fluxes in. the fummer •, intermittents in the wet weather and winter; and that bilious obftruetions, and tumid livers are frequent, as in India. b The neighbouring mountains afford filver mines;, and they would yield much quickfilver, had the Turks either fkill or inclination to work them to advantage: Lanza fays r that an Englijhman fome time ago got two or three botdes of it m his way home, and prefented it to the Bajha, as a fpecimen cf what might be- Gone in that way; but qo farther attempts have been made in conlequence of the difcovery. In this country alib are lead mines, wnich piouiice as much of that metal, as furmfhes them with bullets, and lome neceffary utenfrls. ' Thefe gentlemen gave us no pleafing account, either of the integrity or valour of the loldiers who guard the Caravans ; as that upon an attack thefe very men are frequently the firft who abandon the charge and fl y : nor is it uncommon for the condudor to be in league with the chief of the robbers: upon my afldng, whether fuch conduft would not be puniflied with certain death by the Bajha, whofe own honour and interefl:, as well as xht Grand Seignior, were concerned? I was anfwered with a fliruo- of the IhoulderSi, and a hint that even this great man might peflibly receive Hujh-money from the leaders of thofe very Banditti: but the robbers them- felves have no true courage, for they tell us of a large Caravan having peen faved by the valour of a fingle European, who happened to be travell ing with it, when the Sanjacks made an attack. I told Lanza of our adventures at Kircoote, particularly of our fcruple about entering the Mofque: he replied, that himfelf had been drawn into conver- lations on the fame fubjed; once in particular at a great Turk's houfe, who was a man of fenfe, and a reader of the Prophets, and with whom were four or five other Turks. The mafter of the houfe took occafion, amidft an aoree- able converlation, very gravely to afk the father, what was his opinion of their Prophet.^ On his anlwering, that as Mahomet was not one of the prophets whom his religion acknowledged, it was not for him to fpeak on the fubjedt: the Turk with a lefs ferious air,!*replied, ' But come, my friend,' clappino - his hand familiarly on his fhoulder, ' tell me what your books fay of Ma homet. Lanza tried to avoid an anfwer \ but the queftion being repeated with (till more freedom and good humour, and with the word Mahomet^* inftead of Prophet —'And is it your real defire,' faid Lanza, ' that 1 fhould tell you what they declarer' Yes, truly,' rejoined the Mujfulman. ' Why thenj, J ul y s* s'SSw -e 'll Jt'i-ffsl[ 3 26 ] 175^* then, faid Lanza, they prove that he was zn Arah ; foc:h a one as thofe wh® '—v—inhabit Arabia at prefent.' The whole company appeared thunder-Uruck, for the Arabs are looked on by the urks y as exceedingly perfidious and wicked; the mafter of the houfe was gravely filent, while the others foftly converfed with one another. At length one of them uttered .the .follow- ino- fentence : ' JVere there not political rectfons which prevent the execution of jujtice at prefent, for the blafphemy you have uttered, Mr. Chrifiian! that head of yours fhould in a few minutes fly from its fhoulders' The Padre added to me, ' I feek not occafions, but if thefe people will oblige me, I will fpeak the truth without fearing what may be the confequences.' I could not but applaud him as a man of courage, but advifed him not to let his zeal get the better of his dilbretion. He informed us, that at Aleppo and Con- Jiantinopk, it is not permitted for Chriftians to enter their Mcfques ; but in this part of the country, it is .not much objefted to on particular occa fions. He is of opinion, the prielt was trying to make a convert of Mr. Figot. July 6. Our Ago. faw Hoffein Bafha this morning, whofe difcourfe, relating to us and our journey, was much the fame as that of the Kahier, and fo were his promifes of fervice. As the Caravan waits the return of the fcouts, who are fent out to reconnoitre the country, the Bajha aiked our Aga, if we chofe to travel poft, or with the Caravan ? and being told the latter way, fhould it meet with his approbation; he faid it did, and that he would take care to give proper inftru6tions to the chief conductor to infure our future eafc and fafety. We are to .take with us from hence provifions of all kinds, except water, .as we can get no fupply till we arrive at Niftbin •, and there, as far as I can ?find, but a poor one. Our head mulateer demands of us a camel to be liired in this place for carrying provifions, not only for ourfelves, but alfo for every one of our attendants. Great difputes this day arofe between us and him on this fubjeft *, by his pofitive afiertions, we have too much reafon to fufped that we were deceived by Ccjee Raphael, by whom (as before obferved at Baghdad) we were informed, that we had nothing to do m refpe&lt;5l to provifions for him., or his people. This is now pofitively denied, and we are threatened that they will proceed no farther, unleis we continue •conftantly to fupply them with every article of their diet, in the fame man ner, (which to our furprize, we find) our Aga hath hitherto done, he not knowing or fo much as fufpe6Ung that our contract did not make it necel- fary. The Aga declares, that Cojee Raphael never hinted that the mulateers were on a different footing from the takht-revan men. We learned this evening, that a Caravan from Aleppo and Urfa, is within a day's journey of this city, and had met with little or no obftrudion from the Sanjacks. it fent hither for an efcort, and part of the troops which are to convoy our Caravan are gone for that purpofe. The[ 3 2 7 ] , The Sanjacks are a people who inhabit the mountains oppofite to the , 75^' Gourdiftan or Per/tan mountains: they fubfift chiefly by plunder, and the fcanty produce their own hilly country affords. The late Bajha Achmet of reduced their power-, he purfued them in perfon to their fubter- ranean retreats, fuffocatcd a gj-cat many, killed 7 or 800 who attempted to make their way out from the holes, and carried off fome hundreds of both iexes, and fold them for flaves. This flroke put the country for a while into a more peaceable ftate, than it had enjoyed for many years, but of lace their numbers feem to have increafed, and they are again become very trou- blefome. Our Caravan Ba/hi affurcd us that they have attacked Caravans of 200 to 700 men, and fometimes carried all off: he himfelf, with 200 armed * men, was fet upon lafl; year by 600 of the mountaineers-, but exert ing himfclf to the utmoft, he made a fhift to fave about half the Cara van. His fon who conducfted another, being of lefs experience was taken prilbner, and the whole merchandife fpoiled and carried off; he fays, that fometimes when the robbers difcover a ftronger force than they chufe to encounter, they will parley, and profeis friendfhip, and feem contented to receive a fmall prefent for their chief. They have fuffered much lately by- the famine, which probably has occafioned their being more daring. A few days ago, a party of twenty perfons, among whom was a Chriftian mer chant with 6000 Sequins, was fet upon and overcome by a company of thefe robbers, and all they had taken from them. The Sanjacks are moftly to be dreaded hereabouts, becaufe they always make their attack in great bodies; but after the next ftage, though they continue infefting the roads even to Nifihin, yet their ftrength leffens, and a well guarded Caravan hatli- not fo much to apprehend from them. I paffed the whole of this day with my fellow-travellers in the tent, but July 7. felt the afternoon fo exceedingly hot as to throw me into a fever, and deprive me of all appetite. There were brought to us as very great rarities, a fmall plate of apricots, two or three tolerable mufk-melons, and fome young cucumbers. Neither the city nor neighbouring villages could furnifh us with wine, fpirits, orange-juice, or verjuice •, European lump and powder fugar is very dear and fcarce here, but candy is more plenty, and rather reafonable. We have feen but few buffaloes, oxen, or cows here, or at any other place fince we left Baghdad. The milk we have at any time been fupplied with, was of the goat or fheep. Storks are here in* great plenty, and fo are locufts people are employed with broad flails to keep &lt; the laft away from the riling plants. In the evening Mr. JDoidge in his little walk, caft his eye on a country houfe of the *BaJha at a fmall diftance from our tents, and this day the chief gardener gave us poffeffion of it. It ftands pleafantly on the fide of the tfygris, oppofite the ruins of Jonah's, tomb, in one of xheBaJha's gardens; it has but two rooms; the dimenfions of the largeft; are 40 feet by 20, with a vaulted roof, and arched front; the top of the arch is 30 feet from the ground.i75 8 ' J lily 8. [ 3 28 ] ground. Through the room goes a waterdud from a refervoir at the back of the building, to a fountain in the front: the works of the fountain are out of repair, which is a very unlucky circumftance for us in this fultry fea fon. This, as well as moft of the chief houfes in the city are ornamented with marble brought from a quarry in the neighbourhood. ■Padre Lanza vifited us 1 aft night, when I propofed being at his houfe as to-day, but cannot think of giving up even for a moment the tranquility I enjoy in this agreeable retreat. The ftreets too are fo fteep in many places, and badly paved, that there is great difficulty in ridina through them ; in the evening alio we are always followed by an army of boys who are fcarcely to be reftrained from throv/ing ftones at us. Our pWent fituation is a very agreeable one, being quite dole to the river in the middle of a cucumber and melon garden, and having in view all the gar dens and vilias, with which the banks of the river are ornamented*, befides that venerable piece of antiquity, called Jonah's tomb. We intended to have refided entirely in this houie, but having been told it would not be prudent to Qeep in it at night, we then repair to our tent. Laft nio-ht our watchman difcovered, more than once, fufpicious perfons lurking ^around us ; and about one this morning, we were awakened by the difcharge of a firelock, and the moft vifible confufion amongft our people ; owino- to an attempt having been made by a pilferer, on the fervants arms as they lay on the ground in the tent: our guard fired powder only, and then grap pled with the thiei, but luckily for him he made his efcape. Yefterday afternoon, the wind was high ; it blew from the fouthward of the weft and brought with it a deal of heat and duft: as I kept under T 0 X er i 0 /, Sf den 1 did not feel ^ q'ite fo diftreffing as otherwife I inould have done, but even with that advantage, it was truly trouble- fome : I was very hot and reftlels, nor did I breathe fo freely as ufual. MefTrs./&gt; and Pigot, complained much as well as myfelf, and the latter very often fhifted from one place to another in hope of finding relief. Our TurhJh feryants, and the people of the country inform us, ^hat the win was a rea Samie, ; and they advife our European fervants not to think of buying for us any poultry or pigeons ; declaring, that neither of thefe can ive ong even in tiie city, much lefs in the Defert over which we are to I 1 1 n ls t , ei ' n00 ' ^ accoun t was brought us, that out of eight fowls {oui whole ftock) fix of them were dead. Our Aga waited on the Kahier this mornino- he left him, came in the commander of the* Caravan: the Kahier took the opportunity to cerns, very warmly to him. The Aga told this manner we paiTed yefterday, and defired leave we might be indulged with the free ufe of the i .xhat we might be permitted to lodge in it; the for intelligence, and before troops who is to efcort the recommend us and our con- minifter, where, and in what that while we remained here, '^'s garden and bouie, and Kahier replied, we were very welcome®Eiri ,3^ C 3 2 9 ] welcome to ufe it as we pleafed, but that in confideration.of the very many wretched, half-ftarved people who filled the country, he would not recom mend our being there m the nighttime, not knowing what attempts might be made on us .n fo lonely a place. However, Mr. Pigot and I determined to ri(k it, the reft ot our fellow-travellers, as they killer not fo much from the heat ot the climate, chofe to tarry in the tent rather than occafion the trouble ot carrying our moveables backwards and forwards everv morning and evening. Since we left B I have not eaten more tnan twice with any degree of appetite, and have for the laft three davs been entirely without one; I have lived wholly on bread and milk, and very little ot the firft fufikes. f / We were to-day vifited by two confiderable mer chants, vsho have goods in, and are themfelves going with, our Caravan ■ we law them once before at Padre Lanza\ houfe. The wind this morning was not lo high, nor fo hot as yefterday ; but the afternoon was ftill more intemperate, being diftreflingly fultry, and the air loaded with duft from the Defert, Horfe foldiers vifit us in the garden every evening, who regale themfelvej on cucumbers, each eating fix^ or eight very large ones without either bread or lak: among them this day was a renegade Frenchmtn, but he did not chufe to talk to us in French-, he eyed the books I had by me but only fpoke to his comrades, and in the Turkijh language. As ouJ Itock ot wine was nearly expended, we were obliged (agreeable to our invariable naval practice) to drink Saturday night in water only, from the bountiful Tygris. This day I palTed alone in the garden houfe; the he4t has been fufferable. Padre Lanza had a complaint exhibited againft him to the Bafia, by the Chaldean Patriarch, (the head of the Nejiorians) for having enticed to the Roman communion a large party of the Patriarch's flock : the Bafha, with whom Lanza has an intereft through Francifco the phyfician, fent for Lanza, and as a friend advifed him ' to direft the loft Jheep to return and kifs their Jhepherd's Jleeve.' Thefe bickerings, thefts and difputes, 1 have been told are frequent in this country, amongft the many different Chrijlian nunifters: Tantane animi cceleftibus ir&lt;c. At five in the afternoon the kind Padres came to bid us farewell, having heard of the Caravan's letting out this night i they brought us a.prefent of three or four bottles of fpirits, and fome preferves. We put ourfelves in readinefs for marching, and in the evening threw ourfelves on our cots in our cloaths, expecting to have been called upon foon after midnight, but they fuffered us to ileep till five in the morning. At fix o'clock we mounted, and with our attendants and baggage fet m ?. f- ofr from Moful\ loon atterwards we pafled by fome marble quarries, JuiyVof ^ u and July 9. ■•'I fi I , ! i H S &gt; a ■'.a[ 33° 1 ,7*8 and at half paft nine, joined the great Caravan upon a rifing grouhd, near a river called Baduce. For the firft four miles to the northward of M q [ u I x Baduce River. we paffed over corn lands the reft was a defert affording only flirubs and thirties. We got fome milk this morning from an Arab village. The day was very fultrv and fatiguing, although the wind was near north-weft. In the evening the troops appointed for our dcort came up to us, and at fun-fet all the tents amounting to near forty were ftruck, in order to our being in readinefs for marching at the word of command. Our Ava. ftaid behind a little, to make our compliments, and to take his leave of the Kahier. He was again witnefs to a fecond warm recommen dation which that minifter delivered in our favour to the commander of the troops, as well as to the Caravan Bajhi. Our live ftock, which confifted of five lambs, was through, the forgetfulnefs of our fervants, left behind. We were told however that we fhall have an opportunity of purchafing more at old Moful to-morrow. All the country about is very hilly, and the Courdiftan mountains are not far from us. July ii. At one this morning, notice was given by a loud voice, ' To charge. At two the camels had ceafed their melancholy groans (which they always utter when loading) and were all in motion, taking a courle to the eaftwaid of the north fome little time •, but on the whole we travelled about N. W. over the fame kind of fterile land as yefterday. About half paft four we faw twenty Antelopes near the foot of the hills. Half an hour after, we pafled a ruined village to the left. At five our horfe-guards went a-head between fome high hills of chalk and ftone. At the entrance of this pais on the left hand, is the ruin of a fmall fortrefs, and farther on we law more ruins. This road was fo rugged for about half an hour's journey, that wc could not with any fort of fatisfaclion keep in our fakht Rev am ; it brought us at fix o'clock to the banks of the Tygris, where were numbers of ftieep feeding, a few oxen, and fome calves. Here we made up our late lofs, buying of the Arabs five or fix flieep. Eagles and pigeons^ are here in great plenty *, Locujts alfo in abundance, with blue, purple, vane gated wings, and which I obferved did not By near io high as the common Locujis. The Arab women were hard at work in pitching their tents. We took pofleliion of them for a while, at which they were much out of humour, but we at length appeafed them, by giving them good words and a little K sche money. At feven we raifed our own tents upon a fpot belonging to EJcbe M osul. Mofuk or old Moful i which probably was part of the fpot on which ancient Nineveh once ftood. Our Aga here made us a prefent of a young Antelope juft killed. The heat to-day has been excefllve. To leften it as much as poflible, I caufed one of the Takht Revans to be placed under a tent, and t e top[ 33' 1 of the tent to be as well wetted with water, as the paint would admit of, and likewife the ground for fcveral yards round, by which means I fuffered rather lefs than I fhould otherwife have done. In the evening we took a walk about the ruins, which appeared to have been thofe of a confiderable city. I enquired of the Turks how long it had been deferted, but they could not tell, only believed it was before the time of Chrifii unity: they are bad chronologers., fo no dependance is to be put upon their account. The houfes were built of flone, and the ftreets paved with the fame. At two in the morning, we fet off with our great Caravan, which now confiils of nine hundred camels, principally laden with coffee-lkins, Mujfolen cloth, and gauls, 150 horfe-guards and 100 foot foldiers, befides our own party, and 120 armed merchants with their fervants. We were more than an hour getting through the ftreets of the ruined city; and in leaving it pafled through what had been a gate-way, joining to a rampart or high wall. The land, for an hour after we left the ruins, was near level we then pafled through a long ftreet of Arab tents, whofe inhabitants appeared to poflefs large flocks of flieep •, but before we reached them, we forded a piece of Handing water about two feet deep, and twenty yards over. Our courfe^ through the old city, was N. E. then we travelled N. N. W. which brought us to hills and dales; and a quarter before feven we refted, and pitched our tents upon a hill called ialmajh or Talmoufe ; having in fight the Sanjack mountains on the left. Here is plenty of water, but riot reckoned good, therefore called Ajefew, or Bitter Water. We tailed it, but could not efteem it very bad, and obferved many people drinking of it. About the hill on which we are now encamped, are the ruins of buildings; we are told that formerly here was a town, but the inhabitants could not con- tiune in it, on account of their troublefome neighbours the Sanjacks. We faw a great many birds like pigeons, but they have the cry of rooks. All my brother travellers have fallen off their appetites lately, and though not to fo great a degree as myfelf, feel much trouble from the heat of the day; Mr. Pye complained much, Mr. Alms had a troublefome diarrhoea. Mr. Pigot looks very much fatigued, and we all have loft fome inches in waift fince we left Baghdad: my fervant Alexander has a bloody- flux. I paffed this day better than any one of our company, owing to the care I took in having my tent again wetted with water; was able to eat a morfel of ham, the firft meat I had tafted for a great while paft. The people of the Caravan, I here obferved, drefs their visuals by a fire made of camel, horfe, or mule's dung; fometimes the ground aftords a dry fhrub for that purpofe. At eleven in the night we decamped, and took our march over i tolerable plain country, our courfe for fome time was N, then N. N. W. U u 2 and[ 332 ] and yet farther to the weft j upon the whole aboitt N. W. It brought us about two in the morning, nearer to the Per ft an mountains than we have been yet. We pafled over fome hills and vales, but' in general a fmoother road than of late. The land by nature very fertile, though it now produces only wild grafs, flowering flirubs and thirties, which are almoft all in the feed. At feven we encamped upon a rifing ground, having at its foot a run of good water, with an innumerable quantity of birds of the kind' I mentioned yefterday : this fpot is called Sefaya. The Caravan Bajhi here paid us a vifit, and before he left us whifpered Francifco our fervant, that ' it was cufiomary for gentlemen like us to make him dprefent. The fervant gave him to underiland, he muft not expeft it, at leaft until we fhould be on taking our-leave of xhz Caravan. He fmoked his pipe, drank coffee with us, and parted. 'Turk we have yet had to deal with, (except Aly Aga, and the governor of Hilla) has been rather indelicate in regard to money matters. Even their greateft Bajha\ will be fcandaloufly guilty of the loweft qieanneffes in this refped •, for which reafon we have always cautioufly avoided making vifits to them, or their minifters knowing it could not be done but at a very confiderable expence. Our Aga told us, that the Caravan Bajhi behaved very unpolitely, in not having waited upon us while we were in our tents before Moful\ and therefore he defired, we would not think of making him any prefent without his advice. He told us alfo, that the Aga, general of the foldiers efcorting the Caravan, had begged of him to prevail upon us, particularly this night, to keep together, and as near to the Takht Re vans as poffible ; as well on account of the danger we were in of an attack from the Sanjacks, as to prevent our being infulted by any of his own troops, who mi^ht do it through miftake and ignorance. He added, that he hoped they would not do it through wantqnnefs. At nine in the evening we marched, went N. h. W. the firft four hours, then N. W. W. for two more, afterwards about W. and W. b. S. upon the whole a N. W. or N. W. h. W. courfe, over the fame kind of foil, luxuriant in grafs and feedy flowering fhrubs ; all which are very thick, and as high as the horfe's middle. The Courdijian mountains are in fight to the right, the Sanjacks to the left j diftant from each other fometimes 12, 20 and 30 miles : the country between them a mixture of hills, dales, and plains'^ moft of the latter covered with a deep rich mould. This night I obferved feveral of thofe curious infers, which fo abound in India, and are by us called Fire-flies : they are not quite fo long as the Spanijh fly, are ot a brown colour ? and carry under their bellies a luminous hag which is opened and fhut by two aftive lips : by this, (their own light) ■they are guided in the evening and night, when like the owl they are always bufyv In the Hajt Indies I very often faw the air almoft full of theft iittk 1738.

At feven we got to a imall run of water from the Per/tan mountains Kemjr . and encamped on a hill clofe by the ftream called Demir -Rapee. ^ ' Rapee . part of the laft night was agreeably temperate, the middle cool. This morning was (harp and a little hazy, and what is a rare thine to us, the air was a little damp. We all breakfafted with tolerable o-ood appetites. Yefterday and to-day, we obferved on the fides of the rivulets fome green fedge, the only verdure in fight. About the water to-day we had many larks, and liKewife vaft multitudes of thofe birds which refemble pigeons, but croak like rooks. Mr. Alms brought in a sraf hopper (if it may be ranked in that clafs of infefts) which meafured from nead to tail five inches, its horn four, circumference of the belly three ■ it had fix legs, three on each fide ; two little claws on each fide of its mouth no wings, and feemed, though very llrong, very inadive. Its head and joints had a relemblance of the craw-fifh. Yefterday were brouo-ht us half a dozen land-crabs of the fize of a common fmall fea-crab. Out of the little river near us, we got a difli of mullets and dace, of which I eat a few but either they, or the fherbet I drank after them, made of the juice of green grapes, difagreed with me. Mr. Boidge has the rheumatifm in the moulders; Meffieurs Pye and Pigot look thin and harrafTed : I bore this day s heat pretty well in the Takht Rev an under the tent, and eat my bread and cheefe with more fatisfadion than for a o-ood'while paft. 0 In our Caravan we now obferved fome hundreds of men, women, and children, who are really very miferable objefts ; moft of them have hardly wherewithal to cover thir nakednefs: it is piercing to hear the cry of the in fants at their mothers back ; and thofe of four and five years of a.^e are forced to walk with the Caravan^ lending forth the moft piteous lamenta tions, until overcome with fatigue, they either fall down on the ground, or are taken up into the lap, or behind fome compaffionate rider, 'in- ftances of this fort of charity, are frequent among the Turks. Thefe poor people are returning to their abandoned houles, which they were obliged to leave on account of the famine. This evening came into our camp, from a village at the foot of the Courdiftan mountains, twelve Gourds well mounted, not meanly drelfed, and armed with lances and piftols; they, in appearance, live in peace with the government, and pay thefe cere monial vifits to Caravans, to give information of the ftate of the road; or rather with a view of getting a prefent: they received ten Hookers of coffee, equal to 25 pounds, from the Caravan-Bafm. They fay, a body of the Sanjach[ 334 1 Sam ads were a few days ago hereabouts, and bent their courfe to the fouth- ward, the very road we have paffed. About half pad eleven at night, agreeable to cuftom, orders were given aloud, throughout the camp, ' To charge' This, and every other com mand, relative to our motions and reft, is from the Caravan-Bajht. A thief beino-' detefted, was ftripped, bound, and feverely flogged : they talk of hanains him to-morrow, and the Caravan-Ba/hi*s power, though lo mean and ^nii^mfkant a perfon, during the journey is abfolute. At twelve at niaht w? fet off, and travelled the greateft part of the night over a very fine plain, lying between the eaft and weftern mountains. The foil here is re markably o-ood, and capable of producing great crops of grain and fruit, were it but in the hands of induftrious perfons to cultivate and im- prove it. There was a time when a fpirit of induftry prevailed among the inhabi tants of this country, and when the improvement or agriculture was one of the main things that engaged their care and attention. Even their greateft princes did not think it an employment any way beneath them, to look into every thing that related to hufbandry •, and for that purpole, caufed an exact account to be given them how every province and canton was cultivated, that they might know whether each country brought forth iucn fruits as it was capable of producing. They defcended fo tar into thole particulars, as to inform themfelves whether the private gardens of their lubjeds were well kept, and yielded plenty of fruit: they rewarded the fupenntendants and overfeers, whofe provinces or cantons were the bed cultivated, and pu- nilhed the lazinefs and negligence of thofe idle perfons, who did not labour and improve their grounds *. Such is the account given us by hiftorians of the ancient inhabitants of thefe provinces. But alas! how is the face of things now changed ! for in all that part of Chaldea^ Babylonia^ Mefopotamia^ and Ajfyria^ which we have pafTed.over, no other care feems to be taken of the land, but thai: it fhall be capable of producing fuch a quantity of corn, as barely t0 ^ tls ^ the wants of the inhabitants for the enfuing year. So that mould any extraordinary inclemency of the feafon, or their common enemy the Locufi chance to prevail, a dreadful famine mufl inevitably be the con- fequence, as was fadly experienced by the whole country round Diarbmr the laft year. It was pleafant travelling to-night by the moon, and afterwards by the ftars. The air, except its being more or lefs filled with duft, occalione by ^he march of the Caravan^ was ferene and agreeable.

At fix we faw the fpot we were to reft upon, called Geraza, being a rifing ground on the other fide of a rivulet of good water, which takes its rife in the Per/tan mountains. To the left, jufb before you reach the ftream, is a fmall mount, contain ing the tomb of Geraza, an ancient fage. Some ruins alfo are obfervable in a plain near to it lying between the Courdijlan and Sanjack mountains. I took notice here of eight or ten mounts (in fhape like thofe of Kirccote and Arvde) which appeared to be artificial j they were placed at about a mile diftance from each other, probably they have been places of defence, or boundaries of a kingdom. By this day's obfervation, we found we were in the latitude of 37 0 b' north. It was near feven before we pitched our tents •, this work was delayed by the obftinacy, or rather infolence of our Takht Revan-gee, who behaved fo very ill to the Aga, that he was obliged to ftrike him. This was fo much refented by him, that he put his hand to the dagger in his fafh, and menaced the Aga. This officer was very grave upon it, and threatened to leave us, if we did not turn him away. We gave him up to the Aga to do what he pleafed with him ; not caring to give the leaft umbrage to a man, who during our whole journey, had (hewn himfelf fo extremely careful of us and our concerns. 1 was afiured, that were our Takht Revan-gee within the reach of Solyman Bajha, he certainly would be put to death for his infolent behaviour to his Aga. This la(t ftage we tra velled a weft courfe. In the evening we allowed ourfelves a bottle of Madeira to the remembrance of our friends. A quarter before twelve, we ftruck our tents, and immediately went on, advancing all night over one of the fineft plains in the world-, at leaft what nature intended fhould have been fuch, the foil being rich, and ot the moft luxuriant kind. We every now and then obferved mounts, fuch as thofe we met with yefterday. Our courfe upon the whole of this ftage was W. N. At fix o'clock, we difcovered the Minaret of a Mofque in Nifibin. Several little rivers ran through the plain near to this place, coming trom the high hills to the eaft. As we drew nearer, we were ravifhed with the fight ot verdure, and ploughed lands, at a little diftance from us. The green we afterwards found to be a feed plant, which the poorer people make ^ into bread ; they call the feed Nat chile ^ which is the fame as what with us is called Indian corn. There was a plough at work, drawn by two yoked oxen, followed by a man who guided it ♦, the fhare was caied with iron, the foil was a fine deep rich mould, but neither the man nor beafts feemed to la bour much.[ 336 ]j At feven in the morning, we got to Nifthin*. It looked pretty at a diftance, being leated on a confiderable eminence, at the foot of which runs a river formerly called the Mygdonius, with a rtone-bridge of eleven arche- built over it. Juft by the river, at the foot of the hill or hills (for the town is feated upon two) begin the ruins of a once more flourilhing place which reach quite up to the prefent town. From every part of this place' the moft delightful profpeds would appear, were but the foil properly cul' tivated and planted j but inltead of thole extenfive woods of fruit-trees v/Yiich Rauwolf Ipeaks ot as growing near the place in his time, we could not difcover above thirty or forty ftraggling ones of any kind ; and inftead of that great extent of arable land, on which he dwells lb much, a very inconfiderable number ot acres are now remaining. This is one of the many towns which fo leverely fuffered by the late fa mine. It loft almoll all its inhabitants, either by death or defertion. Of thofe who left it, and furvived, fome begin to return. The ftreets pre- fented us with many wretches, miferably poor, and more than half-ftarvedj they now greedily devour the rind of cucumbers, and every other refufe of food thrown out into the highway. We purchafed at this place, bread, milk, cucumbeis, and pretty good mutton. The firft article, according to our lervant Francifco\ information, (who was here about fourteen years ago) has rifen in price near four thoufand per cent \ at that time, forty cakes were fold tor one Para, the price of a tingle one at prefent. The town itfelf is defpicable, the ftreets extremely narrow, and the houfes, even thofe which are of ftone, arc mean. Our Jga fecured us a ^ood roorn in one ot the Kauns. The late MuJJelem or governor of Nijibin is now in irons, by order ot Solyman, Bajha ot Baghdad, for not having taken proper care m efcorting a meflenger from Stamhcul to Baghdad, who in con- iequence ot the governor's negled, was rifled by the Sanjacks. It was agreed between us to difpatch a letter from this place to Mr. Drummond, our conful at Aleppo. Accordingly Mr. JDoidge wrote one, and ient it y a Ipecial mefTenger, who upon delivering it in feven days is to e paid 14 piaftres; but it he fails one day only, he is then to have but pf lbin ' a TOidIa ' d town 35 miles from the Tygris towards Charra, (or donlut whirK ' ^ c ' ore a v . er y conliderablc city called yf/i/onia Mygdonia, from the river tfbndedtv i^hy Un . / Romans it was the capital of Mefopotamia proper, wdl in the tim • nf ^ in ° n fi antiUS s time againft the Perjians, but taken by them afterwards fraall M1U 1/T\ ian ' u ^ &gt; the feat of a Turkijh Sangiack, Hands on two but -1 fnrrv t ma 63 ^ ^andiome view at a diflance, but though a pretty large town, has very fruiffuffi^r' T- I 0 '. 00 /' 6 , in r t0 it ' bein g piti^Hy built.

This ftep offending a letter by exprefs, we judged a probable means of fecuring us an early paf- fage in fome (hip from Scandaroon to England. The Tahkt-revan-gee was this morning imprifoned by the governor for his inlolent behaviour to the Aga yefterday, but was releafed again before night; the Aga contented himfelf with barely convincing him of the power he had over him.—-A rare inftance of clemencv in a Turkifh officer. ' J While in the Kaun I ordered our interpreter Francifco to enter into a coh- verfation with a poor Turk, relative to the late famine ; and the account he gave ot it was dreadful even in retrofpeflion. This poor creature in his turn aflced many queftions refpefting the probability of fuch an event happening in our country: He appeared furprized to hear, that a famine had not been known for more than a century, or hardly heard of by us; and was in the utmoft amazement to find, that by the laws of England a poor man could not ftarve, fo long as there were any rich to provide him with food and raiment. This point, relating to the poors laws, j(b ftruck the Turk, that with clinched hands, and eyes fixed towards heaven, he for awhile leemed employed in ejaculatory prayer: at laft, he gravely, but with confidence replied, ' 'The happinefs of this world is yours: 0«rV, in a future Jiate' The great Caravan will flay here three or four days, in order to pay the duties due to government. Twelve of the principal inhabitants came from Geraza yefterday, and after continuing with the Caravan a fhort time, went back again. Thefe were officers of the cuftoms, to prevent fmuggling. ^ This morning an exprefs arrived, which confirmed an account we re ceived yefterday from fome poor women who were in the rear of the Ca ravan ^ that ' early the Sunday morning, being fome miles behind, they faw about 500 armed men both horfe and foot, from the Sanjack country, who on coming up demanded of them a faithful account, whether the Caravan was before or behind ? on being told before, they were greatly enraged, and rode off.' As we had often met with alarms of this kind, which turned out to be nothing more than bugbears, at firft we gave no manner of credit to it. The exprefs was fent by an Arab Sheick^ on good terms with the government, who advifed, that the Sanjacks difappointed at the efcape of the Caravan^ had turned their fury on him, alledging that their unfuc- cefsful expedition had been owing to the falfe information which he had given them: the Sheick prayed the government to fend him immediate help for the recovery of his flock, and 300 cavalry are this moment fet off for that pur- pofe. X x I learned Monday July 17.[ 338 ] I learned laft night, that at the foot of one of the Cottrdijian mountains, were ftill a few gardens in fome fort of order, particularly one which is called an hermitage, and belonged once to a Chriftian Patriarch i the houfe is in ruins, but fome of the trees remain. Upon hearing this, I ordered a per- fon to be fent to the fpot j but he returned with only a plate of walnuts, and they not quite ripe. Saturday night laft, about eleven o'clock, I was taken with a fmall fhiver- ing and yawning, which foon went off; but the next evening about feven o'clock I found a tightnefs on the abdomen, with fome bilious twitchings about the du6ts of the gall bladder : all my joints fo ached that I was not able to ftand, or walk, but with pain and difficulty. I laid myfelf down in hopes of deep, and found that pofiure the moft agreeable ; but the per plexity from the Mufchetos (which are now again become troublelbme) and from a flie, which though fo fmall as fcarcely to be perceived, yet leaves a fting behind not much lefs painful than that of the MufchetOy added to the fatigue of my complaint, made the night pafs very uncomfortably. This morning I was in fome meafure relieved by a difcharge of bile; and in the evening took an Ipecacuana vomit, which was of great fervice.. As I could not on this account accompany my brethren about the town and its ruins, I muft therefore infert here fome notes made by the other gentlemen, in our common journal. ' Here is a building that has fome- ' what of the appearance of a caftle, but we faw no guns mounted on it* There is alfo a ftone Mofque with a Minaret ; and a little way to the eaftward of the town, is an old Chriftian church, which muft once have been a very large and noble building by the remains: two capitals of pillars, which fupported an handfome arch, are to be feen above ground, ' and a fmall part of the arch is ftill remaining; but the pillars are buried ' under the ruins. About icq yards from the church are five large co lumns of the Corinthian order, the greateft part of which are alfo buriecU thefe they tell you were once part of the building, and it is not improbable but in the time of the Romans it might have been a temple.' At half paft eight in the evening, we left Nijthin and the great Caravaity taking with us twenty foot foldiers; two companies of cavalry joined us likewife, who are going to Merdin. At ten we paffed a ruin on the right, called Serka Kaun, and at five in the morning, another to the left. The country hath the fame face as what we lately pafled. Near Nifibin. we paffed feveral runs of water. This night, a falfe alarm was given to oilr little Caravan of robbers being in fight, which put us all on our guard; but there feemed to be no foundation for it, it was rather a piece of pleafantry by our Turkijh foltiiers.

A little before day-light, the mountain on which Merdin (lands, was fliewn to fuch of our party as were not in the Takht Rev am ^ and at the morning dawn the buildings appeared. The city looked large, and of difficult ac- cefs, diftant from us about five miles. At fix we put up at a very forry village called Arin, having travellod near nine hours, about a W. b. N. courfe. In this village we faw a thoufand marks of poverty, defolation, and dif- trefs. At the very entrance of it, two human ikeletons almoft entire, pre- fented themfelves to our view; the bodies muft either have been thrown, or perhaps dropt down dead here during the famine, and the flefh devoured by the beafts of the field, or the birds of the air. Two other villages are in fight: one lies N. N. W. four or five miles the other weft fix miles. This lad is called Cojafur. — A fine plain for many miles is in fight, pretty well cultivated, and this year has given to it a tolerable crop of ' corn. - ARIK. Our Aga took no reft after this ftage, but rode on to Merdin to folicit the governor for a guard to efcort us to Urfa, He returned in the even ing, with Francifco, whom we had fent to Fere Eugene with a letter from our friend the biihop of Babylon, and another from Mr. Gar din. The former brought back the compliments of the governor, with many afllirances of veneration and efteem. Our fervant delivered us three letters in French from Pere Eugene, the purport of which, and a mefiage that attended them, was, ' That he had waited upon the governor, who was very ready to grant us forty or fifty foldiers, the whole that he could fpare •, but that he was very diffident, whether fo fmall a number was fufficient to enfure our fafety, as he had certain information that four tribes of Arabs having heard of our coming this way, and that we were very richly laden, were lying in wait on purpofe to intercept us. He therefore advifed us by all means either to wait for the coming up of the great Caravan from Mofuly or to let our for Biarbekir this very night, as by much the fafeft road j and as we carried with us a letter of recommendation to the Bajha of this laft place, who was going for Aleppo next Friday, he ftrongly recommended us to put ourielves under his protection.' * Such were the principal contents of * The following Is a copy of the father's third letter.

I was informed here, that a linen and filk manufactory is carried on at Merdin ; and that the inhabitants make and fell great quantities of turbans, and many other parts of drefs. The foil about the place is very rich, and yields good wheat, part of which is fent toother markets. We got from the city pretty good beef, bread, milk, a little butter, a few fowls, fome grape-juice, apples, cherries, and plumbs; thefe are now in feafon: The environs abound in gardens of good fruit, though perhaps lefs now than formerly. It is remarkable that from Hilla to Baghdad, and from Baghdad to Merdin, not fix trees are to be feen, but what are in private gardens, or on the tops of high mountains. Both Merdin and Niftbin, although in the Ba/balic of Moful, are under the jurifdiftion of the Bajha of Baghdad, and their refpedlive governors are appointed by him. On four neighbouring mounts, the ruins of as many Chrijiian monafteries are ftill vifible. The caftle at Merdin was built by Chrijiians: The famous 'Tamerlane befieged it feven years before he took it, nor would it then have furrendered, had not the befieged been in want of provifions. We are told, excellent water is to be had here. Merdin, by an obfervation taken by Mr. Alms, lies in 37 0 18'north latitude. Alexander M*Intcjh all the laft night, though better of his flux, was very ill with a fever, thirft, pain in his bowels, difficulty in making water, and bloody ftools. He was bled twice yefterday, fomented, and had nitrous powders, He had not carefully obferved that regimen which was recommended to him, but indeed a very irregular kind of life we all are forced to lead at prefent.

Ihe cartilages were quite frefh, and part of the ragged covering ftill remained. On the left hand leading up to the mount of Merdin, are the remains of a fmall town. We left Merdin on our right, and from eight to ten we were afcending the Courdijian hills, over fome parts of which we had great diffi culty to get our Takht Revans, the roads being narrow and rocky. From Arin to the mountain of Merdin, we marched five miles a N. N.

The frefli recruit of fpirits we received on breathing the cool air of the mountains, and our joy in paffing through a country covered every where with fo beautiful a verdure, can only be conceived by thofe few Europeans, who, like us, have travelled over this fultry part of the world in the hotted feafon of the year.

Our ears were continually faluted with the cooing of the dove, the melody of the lark, and other finging birds, to which the hawthorn, the poplar, and the willow afforded fhelter. But all thefe natural beauties were greatly enhanced to us by the frefhnefs of the air, and the almoft conftant breezes which prevailed here. Thefe were fo extremely grateful and refrefhing, that at the joyful inftant, we could not help looking upon them as a full and fufficient recompence for all our paft labour and fatigue. The command of this pleafant diftrid is lodged in a Sheick-Salem, who is a Courd. At twelve at noon we refted in a valley by the fide of another running fcream, not far from a village. Here we got fome milk, but heard a very difagreeable piece of news by a traveller from Biarbekir ; ' that the Bafha was already fet out for Aleppo \ and that fince his departure, the road be- tween^us and Diarbekir had been infefted by a company of banditti confifV- ing or 5 or 600 men, who committed all kinds of outrages, extorting whatever they wanted from the feveral villages, and plundering every paf- fenger that came in their way.' Our Aga had heard this fome hours before, but did not think proper to acquaint us with it till fix o'clock in the evening, when he came with Francifco to our tent, and with a mofl: forrowful countenance unbofomed the difagreeable intelligence. He added^ however, that he was not without hopes the whole of the account might be falfe; that he had difpatched a perfon to a narrow pafs before us, in order to get farther information, and who, he trufted would return with a good account-, but if not, we fhould then be obliged to ftrike out of the road towards our left, and take up our abode in a village in the moun tains, until fuch time as he could procure a proper guard to condudl us in fafety to Diarbekir. This news alarmed us all to a great degree, and threw a damp over thofe flattering hopes which we had lately entertained of being in ten or twelve days bleffed with the fight and converfation of our countrymen at Aleppo. To keep up our fpirits therefore as well as we could under fuch alarming circumftances, we allowed ourfelves a glafs or two of Madeira wine, though our whole (lock was now reduced to ten* bottles of this, and four of claret. About nine, the Aga\ meflenger returned, and brought advice, that there were fome armed men upon the road, but he could not learn they had committed any violence, otherwife than by exading provifions for their own ufe, from the feveral towns and villages 5 and that in all probability they were troops belonging to the Bajha's army, fent by him to colled; the duties due to government. This intelligence railed once more our drooping fpirits, and we determined to proceed ; bur to avoid an ambuf- cade, we refolved to continue where we were 'till two or three the next morning. About[ 344 J About eight this evenings we difdovered the moon rifing over the hills, almoft totally eclipfed, being only illuminated in the lower limb, in appear ance about the twentieth part of its diameter. In half an hour after, it was quite clear. We afked the Turks, what this appearance meant ? they anfwered, ' Some portentous event!' At the hour agreed upon, wefet off, and foon met a company of travellers with loaded mules and afles going to Merdin \ among them was a Chocarda with a fervant or two from Diarbekir. As we did not underftand the coun try-language, we kept on, leaving the Turks and Francifco behind to pick up intelligence. In a few minutes, the late affrighted, half-dead Framfco % reanimated by the account which had been given him, came galloping after us, calling aloud, 'Courage meffieurs! point de crainte! les toutes font de menjonges ! le chemin eft net! Courage gentlemen ! there's no fear! 'tis all a lye! the road is clear!' From whence we eafily underftood, intelligence had been given him of no robbers being on the road, and that no kind of danger was to be apprehended ; which upon his coming up, he confirmed, as foon at leaftas his extacy of joy would permit him. We continued there fore to travel over the mountains, taking a north courfe 'till feven in the morning, when we met with a fingle Turk on horfeback, who informed us, that in going on in the road to Diarbekir, as we were, he had difcovered at fome diftance to the right, a great body of Arab horfemen, confiding of about 700, who were lying in wait for travellers, and that to prevent their feeing him he had ftruck away to the left of the road. Upon receiving this frefh piece of difagreeable intelligence, we thought proper alfo to quit the main road, wheeling towards the left; our Jga at the fame time putting fpurs to his horfe, and riding off to the right, by way of reconnoitring, leaving the whole conduct of our little troop to the difcretion of Mr. Pye i whom, for his expert behaviour on this occafion, we afterwards dubbed with the honourable title of Captain General. We could not but difapprove of our Aga\ behaviour, which though well intended, feemed in our opinion rather calculated for making a difcovery of us to the enemy. In half an hour's time, under the guidance of our new general, we got to the foot of a village, which we found deferted by the inhabitants through fear of the Arabs: as we were riding heedlefly on towards a cultivated fpot of ground, the occupier of it with great emotion waved his hand to us, to avoid his plantation; we, fuppofing that every thing had reference to our prefent danger, concluded he meant the enemy were to cur left, and that we fhould again return to the right. Still however we kept on through the corn, 'till we got up very near to the farmer ; when our old trufty Francifco afked him, 4t JVhat news The Turk or Courd, enraged at the damage done to his crop, put his hand to his fword, and in the moft violent paflion replied, ' The news he had for him, was, that he would 3 immediatelyI — imiinnnMiimiiiinniniiiiiiimi m i t 345 ] ummiiately att off his W.'—This threat was the finilhing ftroke to the irei? poor old man s fpmts ; he trembled, tried to make .an apoLy but could not utter a word.

The firft time, we did it by a ftone-bridge of five arches, the laft, by another bridge of ten. It was about nine in the morning when we firft law from the high mountains the city of Diarhekir, then diftant from us about fourteen miles. W r e continued from that time to leave the § ts ' a travelling north, we reached the village of Hallipoi about half a mile from Diarhekir, at two in the afternoon, after a march of near 13 n,.... hours and the greateft part of it in the heat of the day.

In the latter part of this day's journey, I rode in thtfakht Rev an three hours; one hour was in my own proper turn, one in Mr. Deidge\ and the other in iyiv. yllms s, who bearing the fatigue-better than myfelf, were fo obliging as to infift upon my doing it.

He defired his compliments, and recom mended it to him to wait on Ahdallah Bajha in the evening. Mr. Pye and I were half poifoned to-day by drinking too freely of a bowl of wine and water, into which through miftake, we put Alum inftead of fugar.

We put into the hands a French father (who came this evening to invite us to take up our habitation with him and his brethren) a letter of credit which we received from Cojee Raphael zi Baghdad for 5000 piaftres, on our - draughts upon Aleppo or Conjianiinople. It was drawn by Cuttal Aga on Haffen Ef- fenai in this city.

The great body which we fo narrowly efcaped lail Friday, the fathers aiTure us, encamped but a little while aao between this city and the Courdiftan mountains, and continued there feveral days without interruption ; nay, fent meffages into the city to the Bajha, and received from him provifions of many kinds. Their 'chief being indif- pofed, defired that a phyfician might'be fent out to him, which 'requeft was immediately complied with. The fathers add, that all this indul gence could not, be fliewn them without their making fome kind of com- penfation.

At eleven o'clock three or four Turks ■ of fome rank in the city, vinted us. The Syriaft Papa, or Jacobine Patriarch, we find refides in Diarbekir * ; he is an aged man, of very good life and converfation, and the chief inftrument of what ever good is done by the Turks hereabouts, who in fpite of their religi ous prejudices, cannot but revere the virtue he poffeffes.—Such was the charadter given him by the fathers, Francifco returned to us in the evening, and faid it was a falfe report that he was loaded with irons-, he confefles indeed that he was confined in pri fon for refufing to pay the duty due to government on a country Chriftian's arrival; but on our Agrfs applying to the Mujfolem, and letting him know, that he was one of our fervants, he was immediately fet at liberty.—The old man upon the whole feems to have been lefs terrified with the Turkijh prifon, than he was with the farmer's fword. This evening alio the father returned to us, whom we had entrufted with our letter of credit, or rather draught as we underftood it to be on Hajfen Effendi: he brought his mattrefs, with the defign of tarrying all night with us, forefeeing he * Monfieur Journejort, in his travels, fays, that there are mzviy Patriarchs in the domi nions of the King of Perfia, and the Grand Seigniori He of Itchmiadzin, who has borne the name of Catholicos a great while, is the chief of them all. This Patriarch is clothed as plainly as the other priefis; he lives very frugally, and has but a few domeftics, yet he is the moft conf derable prelate in the world, in regard to the authority he has over his nation, which tremble at the leail threat of excommunication from him.

He made an apology for his being abfent fo long from us, but affured us, that this delay had been entirely owing to the difappomtment he had met with, and the diftrefs of mind he was in upon our account. He in fhort told us, that Hajfen Effendi could not fupply us with anv money. ' We were exceedingly chagrined, as well as difpleafed at this piece of in telligence, and talked of complaining to the Bafha. The good father re plied, ' I have already threatned the Effendi, but he has convinced me, that fuch a procedure will not be attended with any good confequence; fince the blame cannot with any kind of juftice be laid upon him, but rather on Co'ue Raphael your pretended friend at Baghdad, whofe letter expreffes no more than this: ' Sir, Five Englifh gentlemen coming your way, if they fliould ' want money, and you can fupply them, or can prevail on any of your tc friends to do it, their bills drawn on their countrymen at Stamhoul, or tc Aleppo, to the amount of 5000 piaftres, will be fafe i and you therein will ' oblige Yours, &amp;c. cuttal A ga.' •' '■ 'I f'i '* fl i .4 0; &gt;rii: rs 1 i j .. . i ■ • ' * !..

As we had not among us all above ten piaftres left, there appeared to be no other relburce, but difpofing of our watches, buckles, and whatever other trinkets we could mutter. The kind father however did not permit us to continue long in this painful flate; but told us, that he and his brethren had been all over the city, endeavouring to r e a tnend to fupport us in our prefent exigencies, and at laft had in fome meafure fucceeded. At the fame time he called upon a perfon whom he had brought with him, to draw nearer to us. « This good man, fays the miUionary (pointing to his companion) has given us his word, that he will immediately advance you 200 piaftres, which wiU be enough for the prefent, ic wil from time to time on the road to Aleppo, lupply you with whatever C U oT ^ all 3 nd in need of - He •^■country and goes with the Bajha. i he great degree of joy which this acceptable piece of news ^ 1 / eader may more earil y conceive, than I exprefs.

The city, about two years ago was very populous, its inhabitants amounting to four hundred thoufand fouls ; but in the laft year, three hundred thouland died, either by cold or famine. 1 he Chrifttans refiding in the city before this calamity were reckoned to amount to 26,000, of whom 20,000 died. This account we had from one of the French miffionaries, a who alfo faid, that fh e famine, the city contained 60,000 fighting men, but that now ey are not able to mufter 10,000. He affures us, that the houfes and Itreets, nay the very were filled with dead, that every part of the city exhibited a dreadful image of death, and that the furviving inhabi- tants not only greedily devoured all kinds of beafts, brutes, and reptiles, but alfo were obliged to feed on human bodies. Yet, in the midft of this , ene , of . h ° rror i the Grandees of the city had every thing in plenty; for they had taken care to monopolize vaft quantities of corn, which they fold out to the other inhabitants at moft extravagant prices, and therebv acquired for themfelves immenfe fortunes. Corn rofe from two piaftres a meafure to 50, 60, and even 70 in the fpace of fix months. The father added, that the very fevere winter of 1756, and the in 1757, were the caufes of this dreadful vifitation ; for by reafon of the former, there were but few acres of land fown with corn; and by the latter, the fmall crop they had was in a great meafure deftroyed. He fpoke of thej'everity of that winter m terms almoft incredible ; that it was common to fee the people fall down dead in the ftreets; that he himfelf once on quitting a warm room and going into the open air, fell down motionlefs, and that his brother in attempt ing to aflift him, met with the fame fate.

There are alio vineyards, of whole fruits the Chriftians make wine and fpirits. There is at this time a good deal of arable land round the place, but not a thoufandth part of what there might be, the foil being naturally very rich. This day, early in the morning, the Bajha with his retinue fet off from Diarbekir. We could not immediately follow him, being obliged to wait for proviiions for the Ago, and his fervants, for our beads and horles, and feveral necelfaries for ourfelves •, fo that it was pad two in the afternoon before we began to march. In the mean time we wrote a lettei to the hofpitable fathers, thanking them in the moft grateful terms for the re peated a6ts of friendihip they had conferred upon us, anc^ defiring the ia- vour of their names, that we might not be ignorant of the perlons to whom we were fo much obliged.

As he was the firft ftranger of the name of Ives I had ever met with, and as in conjundion with his brother miffionaries, he had rendered me the moft obliging offices, probably I fhould have been fond of believing that I had difcovered a fimilitude of features in the face of Father Ives, with thofe of my own family, and have made myfelf happy in thinking that a confanguinity of but a few intervening genera tions fubfifted between us. Perhaps I might even have carried my reverie fo far as to have concluded, that this relation of mine had been placed here by the particular defignation of providence on purpofe for my relief. But as the above recited letter did not arrive till we were juft fetting off, it never was in my power perfonally to know this name-fake of mine, or his fervices, more than thofe of the other fathers. At leaving Diarhekir, we were favoured with the fight of two fair and pretty women, whole curiofity led them to take a look at us, and who from fome motive or other, which it was impoffible for us to afcertain, were fo obliging as to uncover, and give us a full view of their faces.

At half paft nine in the morning, we encamped in the moft pleafant vale we had met with on this fide Diarhekir, fhaded by willow and poplar trees, interfeded with runs of water, and covered with grafs and flowering fhrubs. Being told that there was a mifunderftanding between our Bajha and that of Urfa, and therefore we fhould not pafs through that city, it was thought expedient -by us to write a letter laft night in Mr. Doidge's name, to the European Chriftian miffionaries at Urfa, begging them to make enquiry for a meffenger, who we imagined muft have arrived there with an anfwer to a letter we had addrelfed to Conful Drummond while we lay at Ni/ibin-: we requefted the fathers, if they found out the meflenger, to fend him back with Mr. Brummond , s, anfwer to Bir or Birjoup, a place we fhould be fure to touch at.—We fent this letter by a perfon going to Urfa, who had accom panied the Bcijha thus far from Diarhekir, At half paft three in the morning we decamped, and let off with fome of the firft of the Bajha\ people. After about three hours travelling over a hilly, fandy country, we arrived at a moft delightful plantation of walnut, willow, and poplar trees, which lay in a vale, where were many black-berry bufhes, and a refrefhing ftream of water ran through it. For about two hours we fkirted the outfide of this pleafant covert, and then got to the place where the Bajha intended to encamp for the day, greatly difap- pointed to find our ftage fo fhort, and yet partly reconciled to it, feeing we were to reft on fo iweet a fpot.—Our courfe to-day was W.

As the Bajha travels fo much flower than we chufe to do, and as by this delay we were apprehenfive of not arriving foon enough at Scanderoon to embark in the fhips which fail from thence about this time to England ; we defircd our Jga to wait upon the Kahier, and folicit his good offices with Dr. Heylin fuppofed it to be Charan or Haran, whither Abraham removed with his father and family, when they departed from Ur.

The Jga, without waiting for an anfwer from us, replied, ' All applications of that fort would be in vain, becaufe one of the two Takht Revans was, and had been for fome time, totally criven up to the lervice of their fick European fervants; therefore, but one Remained for the relief of the five gentlemen, who were not themfelves in the beft ftate of health, and moreover were quite unaccuftomed to ride in the fun.'

He fet before him in the Itrongeft light the neceflity we were under of getting to Scanderoon as loon as poffible, and begged his intereft with the Bajha to permit us to depart with a proper efcort for Aleppo \ making it plainly appear to him, by that means we fhould fave a great deal of what otherwife would be loft time : for he obferved, if allowed to proceed by ourfelves, we could with g . rea p ^ a ' e ^ in one ftage (being only eight hours journey) which the Bajha with his numerous retinue would make two of at leaft ; and the Zijri 7*1 ? 0m Bir to Jle PP 0 i would tak e us only three days, whereas Abdallah Bajha (exclufive of the time he continued at Bir) could not per- torm u m lefs than four. In anfwer to all this, the Kahier ftarted many object Jons ; the principal were, the roads being infefted with robbers, and the ratal conlequences that might enfue fliould we chance to be attacked by them. He defired the Aga however to call upon him again in the even ing, by which time, he told him, he fliould be able to acquaint him more fully with the Bajha\ fentiments. .Jf rlY l r the we hurried the J g a awa y' a ncl by fix he returned with a pofitive refufal from the Bajha v who pleaded in excufe for his non- Compliance with our requeft, that the roads were full of deferters from the bapa ol Urfa s foldiery, who having quarrelled with their mafter had turned u/'t-K ? r:5 ' a ' r ir^r ie himfelf in confequence of their mutiny, had withdrawn hirnfelf from Urfa, where he apprehended his life to be in danger, nn \ • renre . t0 as a of fafety.

We uro-ed alio the importance of our public difpatches, and peremptorily infifted ^on fetting out this very night.. The converfation exceedingly alarmed the Aga, who with the moft vifible marks of concern, told us, that if we were relblved to take this ftep, it would be out of his power to go with us, for the Ba/ha's orders were pe remptory, and fhould he prefume to break through them, the inevitable confequence muft be the lofing of his head. We rejoined, that however forry we fhould be to leave him behind us, yet in the prefent cafe we thought ourlelves obliged fo to do; but for his indemnification with the Ba/has Solyman and Abdullah^ we would write him a letter, which was as follows ' Sir, « The bufincfs we are upon in refpefl to the king our mafter is fo pref- fing, and the hazard we run of miffing the opportunity of an Englijh&gt; fliip of war failing from Scanderoon, fo great, that we are obliged to ac quaint you, we muft run all rilks, and get to Aleppo as foon as poffible. If the Bajha therefore will not permit us to have a guard, which we defire you again to folicit, we muft this night fet off by ourfelves for Bir. We write this to you for our juftification to all whom it may con cern, but particularly our own King. To Aga Amada» We are, Sir, III ' &amp;c. See.' 'We ordered our interpreter to explain this letter to the Aga, and to ex- prels to him the lively fenfe we had of his great care over us during the whole journey, affuring him withal, that on his arrival at Aleppo, we fhould take him by the hand as our good friend, and fliew him the fame token of our thankfulnefs, as if he had accompanied us thither •, but if we fhould have quitted that city before his arrival, we would not fail to leave with Conful Drummond the proper mark of our gratitude, from whofe hands he would be fure to receive it. This gave him an opportunity of minutely en quiring into the exad: value of our intended prefent, which he did not omit, faying, ' How fhall I be able to judge of your confui's rightlv delivering the identical fum you are fo kind as to intend me ?'—We withheld from him the entire gratification of his wifhes in this rclped, for fome little fpace, and ■-I:! I Hi[ 35? 3 and only anfwered in general, that the Britijh conful was a man of honour. We prefently added however, that for his future fecurity we fhould leave a letter at Aleppo addreflfed to him, which, on his producing to Solyman Bajhciy would not only juftify (lis whole conduft towards us, but alfo exprefs our thanks for his fervices, and intreat his acceptance of certain tokens of our efteem. He feemed to pay great attention to this declaration, and made fome civil returns to it, by an eafy inclination of his body but ftill fuch a fhare of diffidence fat on his brow, that we evidently faw his heart was not perfectly at eafe. Knowing the inordinate third which even the heft among the Turks have for money, and aftuated befides by the real regard which we had for the man, we could not defer any longer telling him, that our prefent would not fall fhort of 500 piaflres.—After this he appeared very well fatisfied. We then defired him to fend for the Mocha and Takht-revan-gee. When they came, we gave them to underftand, that we intended to let off this very night at twelve o'clock for Bir without the Bnjha •, and ufed evgry argument we could think of to perfuade them to go with us. But they too ' raifed a thoufand difficulties, telling us, that exclufive of the rifk they ran of lofing their mules, which were not their own, they did not dare to pro ceed without the Aga, efpecially after what had pafled between him and the Kahier. Upon their refufal, we held a ffiort confultation among our- felves, and refolved to requeft the Aga to go immediately to the Kahier with our moft refpeftful compliments, befeeching him to give us leave to wait upon him with our interpreter. He would fain have poftponed it till the morn ing, reafoning with great propriety on the unfeafonablenefs of the hour for waiting upon a man of his rank •, but we were not now to be put off, plead ing in our turn the abfolute neceflity we were under of not lofing another moment of time : he at laft yielded, taking with him Francifco. They did not return till paft ten, and then, only with the minifter's compliments and prayers, that we would reft fatisfied, and acquiefce in his and the Bajha's wholefome advice. He defired them to aflure us, the road was extremely dangerous, and that our requeft could not be granted with out the moft apparent hazard; adding, that if we were robbed, it would re- fled great diffionour not only upon Ahdallah Bajha who had taken us under his protection, but. alfo on Solyman Bajha who had fo ftrongly recommended us •, and befides, the difference of time between going by ourfelves, or with the Ba/ha^ could not now be very great, and he hoped no kind of lofs or inconvenience would arife from it. We were obliged to put up with the dlfappointment, and fo repofed ourfelves once more on our cots ; it being impracticable for us to fet off, as .the Kahier by this time had denounced a punifhment of the feverert kind on all our country attendants who fhould prefume to go with us. However, we had taken care to difpatch a meflenger to with orders to looc out for the man with Mr. Drummond's expected anfwer j and Ihould he find 7 him,; Will of b mi wiA 1 [ 359 ] him, he was directed to return to us immediatelyif not, to wait there till our arrival, with or without the Bajha. Early this morning, Ahdallah Bajha himfelf fent for our Aga, and talked with him a great deal on the prefent fituation of our affairs. He concluded in the fame drain as his Kahier had done the preceding night, ' that he neither could, nor would confent to our going one finger's length before him.' On the contrary, he defired, that during our future march, we would take care to keep more in the body of his guards than we had hitherto done, for the times were exceedingly perilous. The Aga foon returned to us, and delivered the Bajha\ meffage. He was accompanied (agreeable to an order given by Abdullah) by three other perfons: the one was a filver-ftaff officer, the other a Chriftian of his houfehold, and the third a foldier. The two firft were direfted to beg that we would have patience, and put confidence in the Ba/hd's care of us; to affure us that nothing but the real concern he had for our fafety, prevented his giving us his per- niiffion to proceed ; that the whole country was full of danger, and that a hundred foldiers would not be fufficient to proteft us, there being more than two hundred deferters from the Bajha of Urfa\ troops, between whom and their late commander there was now an open war. As a proof of the truth of this reprefentation, the Bajha had ordered the foldier to attend us, who this very morning had come from Urfa, and confirmed the ac count in every particular. We had all the reafon in the world to'believe, that the Chrijlianyf^ joined with the other two, not only on the preftimption that his word would gain greater credit with us than that of a Mujfulman, but becaufe this was the very man who at the requeft of the fathers, had fupplied us with cafh. In the courfe of our converfation with thefe perfons, we were informed, that the Bajha, on hearing of the precipitate meafures we were taking, had once propoied that Francijco our fervant and interpreter fhould be fent for to re ceive the Bajiinado) on the prefumption that he had been chiefly inftrumental in perfuading us to fet off by ourlelves. We appeared to fmile at this ac count, and told the Turks r that we were very -fure a perfon of the Bajha\ dignity and politenefs could never think of carrying into execution fuch a ftep, therefore we took for granted that if it was propofed, it was only in jeft. They obferved in reply, that the Bajha had told them, he was educated at Conjiantinople^ and haki the honour of being a Vizier to the Grand Seig- nior\ from which happy circumftances he had frequent opportunities of be coming acquainted with the genius and tempers of the Englijh nation^ which he knew to be fo amiable in every refped:, that he was entirely convinced we had never withftood his intreaties, if this fervant who was an Aleppean^ and a fubjeft to the Emperor, had interpreted with integrity all he was com manded to let us know. We allured them,, that he was an inoffenfive and hone it[ 3 60 ] honeft man, and to the befl: of our belief had always executed his commif- fion with fidelity. We defired them alfo to represent to the Bajha, that though we had the moft lively and grateful fenfe of his great concern for our welfare, yet we could not but regret every hour that did not let us forwards in our way to Aleppo: we therefore through them, again befeeched him to grant us a little efcort, with which we would willingly venture our perfons and effefts. The officer peremptorily replied, that we muft not go. Prefently he added, that the Bajha had propolcd our fending an exprefs from hence to the Britijh conful at Scanderoon^ requefting him to detain any one of the Kings fhips that happened to be there; and that the Bajha him- felf would write a letter, informing the Conful at Aleppo how delirous we were to get forwards in our journey, but how impoffible it was for him to comply with our defires. We begged the officer and his companions to make our acknowledgments to the Ba/ba for this farther inftance of his kindnefs, but added, that we had already written to the Confu), who we made not the lead doubt would do every thing in.his power to ferve us; yet we knew likewife fo much of the nature of the orders given to the cap tains of our fhips of war, that nothing was fufficient to prevail on them to tarry for even a fingle day. We concluded, with defiring them to make the Bajha acquainted with our thanks, and our intreaties to be gone. Before they took leave they obferved, that the difference of rime between our going by ourfelves, or accompanying the Bajha, would be only two days, owing to the Bajha of Urfa\ being arrived at Bir\ for that would prevent our great-man from tarrying fo long there as he other- wife intended. In the evening two fmall plates of ready-drefled victuals were lent us from the Bajha's cookery-tent. This fcanty fupply was intended for oiir- lelves j at the fame time a certain allowance of bread. Ghee, &amp;c. was fent to our Ago, and his people. As we knew not by whofe order thefe things came, we defired our Aga to make enquiry ; for it they were a prefent from the Bajha or Kahier, we very well knew that their diredions in ref^ed to the quantity, muft have been but ill executed ; if they came from any inferior perlon, we were defirous he fhould be acquainted that we could receive no more from him, though we were obliged to him for his good will, and fhould not be unmindful on our arrival at Aleppo^ of any civilities that were either done, or intended us on the road. To divert our piefent melancholy in fome degree, we took a walk in the plantation before us, where, be(ides the trees and bullies already mentioned, we found the apple and plumb-tree. 1 he firawberry plant alfo flourifhed here in gieat abundance. Soon after we had finifhed our walk, we received a mef- fage from the ifo/Zw, that to prevent any indecorum or mfult being offered to our perfons in the night, he had thought it neceffary to order fix or eight ioKucxs to attend us at our tents. We immediately ordered q \ xx Aga to wait'Witts leliEi! r 75^ Monday J' 1 / 3 1 ' [ 361 ] wait upon the Kabier, and to demand the real meaning of fo unufual a guard. At his return, he told us, we were to look upon it as an addi tional mark of the Bajha's refped: and care for us, who had alfo conde- fcended fo far as to diredl the particular order of our march. In the even ing we found this to be in the rear of what he moft valued, his Women and his Treafure. By this extraordinary teftimony therefore of the Bajha's kindnefs, we were in reality his prilbners ; it not being in our power now to leave him, how much foever our inclinations might prompt us to do it. We refumed our march at nine in the evening; travelled weft, and va rious other courles, but upon the whole about S. W. near 32 miles in 12 hours, oyer a barren, hilly country, and not at a greater diftance than 12 or 14 miles from the Armenian mountains, which run almoft eaft and weft. We were told yefterday, that we were only eight hours journey from Bir^ but we have travelled twelve hours, and have ftill another journey to make! We pafted by feveral Arab burial-grounds, and three or four ruined vil lages and forts, fituated on eminences one of thefe has two fmall ftone- gateways remaining. Now and then we came to a little patch of ground fown with Indian corn. At nine we encamped by the fide of a run of water, on the declivity of a hill called Cortocoar. The villages all around Cortocoar us are deferted *, the Arabian inhabitants having removed themfelves and ^iU. their effeds, through an apprehenfion of their being taken from them by the rapacioufnefs of our foldiery, or the extortion of our great men. No flocks, not a fingle flieep is to be feen ! we have no viduals to eat! and are almoft ripe for mutiny, upon account of our forcible detention, which we think has its rife more in vain-glory, mixed with a little felf-intercftcd policy, than from any real apprehenfion the Bajha entertains of our being in danger, were he to fend us away under a proper efcort. At five in the evening, we fent our Aga to the Kahier to lay our necef- fities again before him, and to defire either a frefh fupply of provifions, or leave to haften by ourfelves to Bir. Our Aga returned with the minifter's moft ceremonious compliments, and expreffions of forrow for our uncom fortable fituation, declaring at the fame time, that the Bajha and all his at tendants laboured under the fame fcarcity of food, but that he would deny himfelf the fcanty pittance that was allotted him, and fend us a couple of plates of drefied meat from his own family. Thefe werefoon after conveyed to our tents, and though they barely ferved to take off the keen edge of my brother-travellers appetites, yet we looked upon them as infallible marks of the Kahier*s humanity and politenefs. For my own part, I fuffered but very ittle upon this occafion, not having as yet fo far recovered my ap petite, as to feel in any great degree the painful fenfation of hunger. A a a At rl[ 3 62 ] At one the next morning, we fet off again, and travelled five hours over rocky hills. The firft two hours our courfe was W. S. W. the two fucceeding ones S. W. and S. S. W. and the laft hour S. which brought us to the city of BiVy or Birjoup (as it is called by the inhabitants) which is fituated on the eaftern bank of the river Euphrates^ againft the fide of a very high, chalky hill. It is about fix hundred yards in length, and has five or fix Mofques with ftone Minarets. The buildings in general are in a ruinous condition, which with the craggy hills around, afford a pidturefque and ro« mantic profpe&lt;5t. The tops of thefe hills are covered with vineyards, as indeed are moft of the environs of the city, but we could not difcover any corn-lands. The city is defended by two caftles one (lands by the river's fide, the- other on the top of the hill. From this laft, two fmall guns were fired in honour of the arrival of Abdullah Bajha^ who entered and rode through the city on horfeback, attended by his own train, and by the Bajha of Urfa, who went out-of the place to meet him. There being no bridge here, and only three ferry-boats, which were all employed in tranfporting the Bajhah Ear am and retinue, foldiers and baggage, we had little hopes of getting acrofs the river for fome time, and therefore feated ourfelves on fome ruins that lay in the ditch before the town ; but the Bajha riding by, and feeing us and our baggage in the open ftreet, immediately called our Aga to him, and fternly demanded, ' Why the Englijh gentlemen were thus fhame- fully treated ?' Upon his being told the realon, he gave him the ftrifteft orders, and commanded his own officers to take particular care, that the boats fhould be no more employed in his fervice till we and all our baggage were wafted over to the other fide. This was the firft time we had ever feen the Bajha, and it muft be owned that his whole behaviour upon this occafion was truly humane and polite. Our Aga kiflfed the hem of his gar ment, and we bowed after our manner, which he returned with a fmall bending of the cheft, and a vifible complacency of countenance. He was about fixty years of age, feemed adtive, and had a very long flaxen beard- The Kahier, who immediately followed the Bajha^ faluted us alfo with great freedom and good-nature. It was about nine in the morning when we pafted over the Euphrates' for the fecond time ; and thus quitted Mefopotamia and entered Syria. The river is here not more than 150 yards over, now, but in- the winter-months,, ©r after great rains, and the melting of the fnow in the mountains, it muft be at leaft twice as broad, which is very vifible from its prefent dry bed. It fupplies the inhabitants of Bir with a great variety of exceeding fine fifh,. We got here ftieep, eggs, bread, and a few grapes,, but no wine or fpi- rituous liquors. It is fomewhat remarkable, that the burial-ground belonging to the city of Bir , is on the Syrian fide ot the river; poftibly it may be owing to the- ground' Pffffr- ■ Jip ' ' v[ 3®3 ] ground on which the town is built, being of fo rocky a nature as not to admit of graves being dug in it, but with the utmoft difficulty. It was . ^P o n this fpot that we pitched our tents, from whence we had a full view ot the city but as its houfes are built of a white, chalky (lone, which bears the lame colour with the neighbouring hills and foil, we could not eafily diftinguifh the one from the other. Here we had the mortifica tion to learn, that the two men whom we had difpatched from Niftbin. with a letter to Mr. Drummond at Aleppo^ had between Urfa and fallen in ^ ith a party of Sanjacks, who in a great rage had defaced our letter, and carried the meffengers up into their mountains, where after feverely whipping them, they at length fufFered them to depart. Thefe unfortunate men it feems did not arrive at Bir till yefterday, and after ftaying a few hours let out tor Aleppo j lb that all our hopes of getting fpeedy intelligence from Mr. Drummond are at an end. At a quarter before three this morning, we decamped from the banks of Auguft 2 the Euphrates^ having the Bajhas ladies and treafure before us, and travelled W. S. W. and S. W. for four hours and half, over a hilly, rugged coun try, abounding in chalk and ftones. At fix we pafled over a bridge with three arches, and difcovered a pretty looking village on our right called Mazar, which had many trees about,' and on the hills beyond it: At half paft feven we pitched our tents in a pleafant valley under the lhade of a walnut-tree, with a pomegranate at our fide, and an agreeable plantation of peach, almond, apple, and other trees around us. From this fpot, we dif patched one of our Hakht-Revan men with a fecond letter to Mr. Drummond* He engaged to deliver it to-morrow at fun-rife, and to meet us on the road with an anfwer. Our Aga has juft given us all great fpirits, by acquainting us that we are to keep the Bajha company only this and to-morrow night's ftage. After wards we are to have liberty to make the beft of our way. We learnt alfo this evening by a traveller from Aleppo^ that a malignant fever had 'till lately mightily prevailed in that city, and carried off many of the in habitants : He added, that bread was at fo high a price, that the poorer people were almoft Itarved. At a quarter before two this morning, we took our former ftation, behind Aaguft 3. the ladies, and marching off travelled a winding courfe for two hours. We paffed quite through the village of Mazar, which has two Mofques with Mi- M azar. narets then went a S. W. by W. courfe for, two hours and half more, over a good, but much neglecled foil, and at length pitched our tents in a well cultivated plain, at the eaft fide of an artificial mount, on which a caftle once flood, and around it a town named Sajuera. This is much fuch S ajuera another mount as that at Kir coo te^ only not quite ib large. From the top of it you have a commanding profpeft of a fine extenfive country with two or three villages j were the lands about them green with Indian corn or Nat chile* A a a 2 A river[ 364 ] A river called alfo Sajuera runs through the plain, which greatly added to the fcenery of the landfcape. Some ruins on the fummit of the mount are ftill vifible, particularly on the weft fide, where you plainly difcover the pillars of a portal to the caftle, which were made of bluifli hard ftones about five feet in lenath, and two in thicknefs. On one of them placed at the right hand as 'you enter the gateway of the eaftern fide of the ruins, and nine feet from the ground, fome ancient charaders were apparent, though now fomewhat eftaced.—They are copied in the annexed copper-plate. On the north fide of this gate-way, are two or three arches, which appear to have been formerly paffages to fo many apartments : They are built of the fame hard large ftones as thofe which compofe the portal, and are cemented together with a moft durable mortar, in the compofition of which I obferved many fmall ftones. We were told, that this mount and town were formerly in the poflefllon of Chrijliaiis\ but I am apprehenfive that the Tttrh, from whom we receive our information, make ufe of the words Chris tians and Europeans as fynonimous terms ; fo whether they mean Eurch pcans who lived before the times of Chrijiianity, or thofe who formed the Crufades in the twelfth Century, is difficult to determine. At fix this morning, the principal men of another village juft by us, and called alfo Sajuera, pafled on towards our rear, in order to pay their compliments to the Bajha. Thefe gentlemen were all armed and on horfeback, attended by a perfon carrying a pair of colours. About eight ©.clock, near forty ot the chief people of Aleppo came alfo into camp, with their horfes very richly caparifoned. Their bufmefs is alfo to com pliment the Bajha on his drawing nigh to their city. They have been four days on the road, and had waited many hours in this village for his arrival. . D We defired our interpreter to make our compliments to one of them, smd to enquire of him the true ftate of affairs at Aleppo and Scanderoon, The gentleman he fpoke to, was fo complaifant as to wait upon us imme diately at our tent. We entertained him in the cuftomary method of the c ? unt I.y, a or two of tobacco from the Argile tube, and a difh of coffee without fugar. He confirmed the account we had before received u m ^ ignant ^ ever ^ av i n g raged at Aleppo, but added, that its effedls had not been very fataL He told us, that conful Drummond was his tenant^ and was very well, but he knew nothing of his intention of foon quitting this country for England^ for from an intimation given by Mr. Drummond il a er J. 0 ^ r ; Garden at Baghdad, we had flattered ourfelves with the hope of having him for our fellow-traveller. The Turkijh gentle man laid farther, that there were fome Englijh fhips now at Scanderoon ta ing in their cargo, but when they intended to fail he could not take upon him to fay. He knew nothing for certain in relation to the ftate of 7 affairs[ 365 ] affairs between the Englijh and French nations, but recollefled to have heard the chief Turktjh officer of the cuftoms lately declare, that there were ereat hopes of a peace being foon concluded between them, confequently ffiips would come to Alexandretta more frequently, and with lefs interruption, than they had done of late. For better information, he recommended us to the Kahier ot the late Bajha^ who came aJfo into the camp this morninp;. Upon our afking him fome queftions relative to the robbers, he anfwered without hefitation, that the road to Aleppo was tolerably fafe for travellers • but afterwards, on our Ago, holding a private converfation with him, and (as we fufpedl) checking him for the favourable account he had given us he prefently changed his note, and added, that it would by no means be advileable tor us to travel by ourfelves. Having advanced only 13 or 14 miles to-day, and ftill lefs yefterday, wc are quite wearied out, and have loft all patience. As an additional morti fication, we now hear, that inftead of being permitted to proceed by our felves after this night s ftage, as promifed, we are to be detained till after the Bajha comes into camp to-morrow. Our liquors too are all drank up, fo that we are now reduced to drink the pure element of our firft parents; a moft uncomfortable beverage to keep up the fpirits of worn-out travellers, and who for fo many years have been ufed to the more generous and exhilaratino- juice of claret and madeira. With refpefl to our lx}od, we are in much the fame, if not a more uncomfortable fituation ; fometimes we have nothing at all to ^ eat, and if by chance we are favoured with a fupply from the Bajha's kitchen, it is only of a little mutton juft killed, and fo indif ferently drefled, that we are fcarce able to fwallow a bit. However, all of us except M c IntoJh, have recovered our long-loft appetites ; but this circum- ftance, which a few weeks fince would have been efteemed a blefling, is now become a real misfortune. As we have no other refource left but getting to the end of our journey as foon as pofllble, we are all impatient to make the experiment, even at the expence of hazarding the Bajha's dif- plealure. Francifco, whom we had fent to the late Bajha's Kabier for in telligence, brought us a confirmation of fome Englijh fhips being ftill at Scanderoon, At half paft feven in the evening, we were moft agreeably furprized with the following letter from Aleppo, Aleppoi 2d Augufl^ 1758. 'Sir, ' THIS day, about an hour and half before noon, your letter of ' the 16th of July, from Nijibin, was brought to me. The cover of it was ' torn, but enough of it remained to fhew it was intended for me. I ' cannot pretend to fay that the receipt of it gave me pleafure. No, Sir, 44 it gave me an excefs of pain; and I figured to myfelf a variety of ugly circumftances, which I ihall not give you the trouble to read. Now, I ' cannot[ 366 i] &lt;e cannot but blefs God that you are fafe, and that I have a reafonable ' profped of feeing you at Aleppo, freed from a thoufand inconveniences, ' and as happy as f, and the other gentlemen here, can make you. « I lhall not at prefent lofe a moment in telling you news •, only that « our convoy, and three other men of war, are in thefe feas. I purpofe ' going in one of them, but when, is a queftion that cannot eafily be ' anlwered; becaufe the plague now rages at Smyrna, and no patent can ' be acquired till forty days after it fhall ceale.

Vernon — — 24 ■'To Henry Doidge, Efq; ' I dont know where, ' but I hope near to « Aleppo.' * Father 4nge oi Merdin intruded to Mr. Doidgeh care fome ancient medals which he had ^olleftcd for the conful, and of which Mr. Doidge in his letter had informed him.[ 367 ] The reading of the above letter gave us all frefli fpirits; we drank the writers health in water, which (as before obferved) was the only liquor we were now mafteis cu, and alter wards threw ourfelves on our cots, but fuch was the joyous perturbation of our fpirits, that we could not take a mo ment's ileep. . At ten we f et off once more in our proper ftation, and travelled near eight hours over an uncultivated country, though much lefs ruo-aed than what we had lately met with. At feven in the morning, we pitched our tents by the fide of a river, in a plain, near to an old Caravanferah. Our courle was from S. S. W. to W. S. W; we travelled about three miles an hour, which has hitherto been our ufual progrefs in tolerable roads. In bad ones we do not get forwards above two. I judge upon the whole, that from Merdin we have made two miles and an half by the hour 5 from Baghdad to Merdin, three. From hence we fent our sfga to the Kahier, with our beft compile ments and thanks to himfelf and Ahdallah Bajha, and likewife to know whether they approved of our proceeding to Aleppo by ourfelves after the next ftage. An anfwer being brought us in the affirmative, Mr. Doidge thought it neceflary to acknowledge the receipt of the conful's letter by the fame melfenger who had brought it, giving him to underftand that we hoped to kifs his hand at Aleppo to-morrow morning. In the evening we were cruelly mortified by a melfage which the Kahier fent by 'the Aga, importing, that fince the morning he had held a confultation with the Bajha on the fubjefl of our parting with him to-morrow ; that the Bajha would by no means confent to it, but infifted on our accompanying him quite to Aleppo, which, he faid, would be doing a mutual honour both to himlelf and us. As the whole tenor of this mefTage was con trad i(5lory to the promife we had received in the morning, we did not fail to remonftrate againft it, but to no manner of purpofe. The Kahier fent us word, that he was forry for our difappointment, yet fuch was the will of the Bajha y and what reply could pofllbly be made to it ? Adding however, that the confent given us in the morning had been without the Bajha\ knowledge; that he (the Kahier) had taken upon himfelf to give it, not doubting of his mifter's acquiefcence, and knowing that upon every account it would be moft acceptable to us, whom he wifhed to oblige. Thefe were foothing words, but by no means fufficient to ftifle our difcontent, or to reconcile us to this abominable aft of turkifh defpotifm. We determined therefore to leave the Bajha at all events, being now fully convinced that his fole motive for detaining us, was the fooliih pafiion of having us in his train when he enters the city of Aleppo, • ■ ' ;v ; n {i \ At half pad ten we decamped again, and moved off in our ufual order, pafling by a few inhabited villages, and others that were quite in ruins. At fix in the morning we got to the fpot where the Bajha intended to encamp, 7 but[ 368 ] but from whence we were determined to make the beft of our way. As the great man was ftill in the rear, we had time to place ourfelves in the very 3 track he was obliged to take. Accordingly at nine, he came by in his Takht Revan with great pomp and ftate ; we (ftanding in a row) faluted him, and exprefled by figns a defire of fpeaking to him. He faw us, and made a motion with his hand for us to come nearer to him. He then made a full ftop, and we advanced, having before conjured our interpreter Fran- cifco to take courage, and not be afraid of repeating the whole of what we fliould bid him fay to the Bajba •, we gently hinted the fame falutary caution to our Aga but alas! our good advice with both of them was all in vain. The laft turned as pale as death, and reverently kilTed the great man's fleeve: and as for the poor, affrighted, trembling Francifco, he had not the leaft power of utterance, but ftood ftiivering with apprehenfion, and contented himfelf with touching the hem of the Takht Rev an* s covering, and licking the duft from off his fingers. The Bajha eafily gueffing at the purport of our intended petition, told us with an air too haughty to be pleafing, ' we muft ftay, and that we had but one day more before we fhould arrive with him at Aleppo' In anfwer, we intended to have fet before him the feveral reafons we had for going forwards, fuch as the want of health, neceifaries, and time, befides the promife we had made our conful of feeing him to-day; but unfortunately, our interpreter (who had not yet gotten the better of his fears fo far as to deliver our fentiments properly) made ufe of this plea of our appointment with Mr. Drummond, firft, which we had defigned fhould come in order laft. Upon which, the great man probably conceiving his dignity to be hurt, replied with a Turkijh monofyllable, tantamount to our Englijh word, ' Pfhaw;' adding, 41 What lignifies your engagement with the conful ? Let that remain with me. — We attempted to urge many things in reply, but 'twas all in vain: this Beglerbeg, this Lord of Lords, ordered his people to march on, and left us to digelt his final refolve as we could. The abrupt departure and lofty deportment of the Bajha upon this occa- fion, chagrined us not a little, and indeed piqued our pride fo much, that with the fame hafte as he had made from us, we ran towards our horfes, mounted, and in an inftant got into the high road for Aleppo^ leaving our Aga, all our country-fervants, I*akht Revans, and baggage behind us. Our worthy Aga (who dared not to accompany us but at the rifk ot lofing his head) made ufe of many intreaties to prevail upon us to flay another day, concluding with that which to ingenuous minds is the moft powerful^of all, ** That he fhould efteem it as the higheft favour done to him^elf.' , We aflured him in general, that we fhould be always more ready to oblige him, than even the Bajha himfelf, as our obligations to him were conteffeuly greater; but upon the prefent occafion it was morally impoffible lor us to do it, and therefore we defired to be excufed, though at any other time, we fhould look upon his defires, as having the force ot com- jnands.

W,S.V conic fi ■ rotn c faiit-tre where ■ and the journey putatic[Upon uli f 369 ] Immediately after this we rode off at a round trot, difcourfing with each other on what might be the event. The perfuafiom of our Ara had indeed already wrought fo powerfully with fome of the party Vhat they began to have their doubts refpecling the propriety of their behaviour towaids the Bajha-, but now, as the die was calf, it was impoffible for us to recede. We had not gone on above half an hour, before we efpied two horfemen riding full fpeed after us from the Bajha\ camp : one of them made figns for us to ftop, to which we paid no kind of attention, till he drew nearer and we difcovered him to be our own trufty Aga, the other, proved to be our fervant Vertan. At their coming up, the Aga told us, that as loon as we rode off, he waited upon the Bajha^ and related to him the particulars of our flight; upon which he faid, ' If that be the cafe, do you immediately follow them, with all their fervants, baggage, and a company of foldiers to proted them.' Thefe joined us foon after, and we went forwards with a part of the foldiers, leaving the others behind to take care of our baggage and Takht Rev am ^ in one of which Alexander M'Intofh was obliged to be carried, being ftill extremely weak. In a few minutes alter this, the gentlemen and troops from Aleppo^ who had now taken their leave of the Bajha, and were returning to that city to be in readinefs to re ceive him in a proper manner to-morrow, came up with, and foon went a head of us. 1 his fingle circumftance proved that Ahdallah Bajha\ motive tor keeping us with him, was really what has been already fuoo-efted: if he had not been adtuated more by the vanity of having us in the number of his retinue on making his public entrance into Aleppo, than by any real concern he had tor our fafety, he certainly would have directed us to keep company with thefe gentlemen and their body of troops, under whofe pro- tedion we could not have failed of travelling in perfed fecurity. . Our road towards Aleppo was very rough and bad; we pafled by many a - A lepp® high hill with a hard, chalky bottom. Our courfe upon the whole lay W. S. W. At noon we came abreaft of a village, whofe houfes were of a conic form, and built of mud. Soon after, we paffed by fome gardens. } rom one to near four o'clock, we fkirted a very pleafant valley full of fruit-trees and legumens, which continued quite up to the city oi Aleppo^ where we arrived at four, very hot and fatigued, having rode all night and the greateft part of the day. We have been exadlly feven weeks in our journey from Baghdad, which is diftant from Aleppo, by the moft exad com putation, in our route, 698 miles. B b b w[ 37° ] CHAP. VII.

As we found this point to be a matter of the utmoft indif ference to Mr. Drummond, we chofe to decline the increaf.no- of our ac- quaintance, fo that our converfation and vifiting were confined to the fmall, but agreeable circle of our own countrymen. And this very cir- cumftance. confidenng the great fatigues we had fo lately undergone! was not without its advantages; for hereby we had an opportunity of bein^ more at our ea.e, and ot devoting the fhort time we were to continue herf to our own concerns, which otherwife would have been almoft entirely taken up in receiving or paying ceremonious vifits. Mr Holloway was too ill to officiate to-day, in the public fervice of the church. At noon, Abdullah Bajha made his public entrance into the ,,Jf erda J an ^ our whoIe time was tilken up in fettling ac- AoguftJ. counts, and paying ofi our Mocha and takht revan-gee, with whom we had much trouble, and clamorous difpute. Mr. Baron our countryman a cren- tleman ot great lagacity, and Mr. Edee our nation's firft Braroman ox in terpreter, took much pains to prevent our being impofed upon; but in fpite of all their endeavours, thefe rafcals will be paid more than they have a light to demand: to get any red refs from government muft be attended with great expence and lofs of time, therefore the remedy would be worfe than the dileafe Wc refolved to leave the fettling of thefe matters to the difcretion of Mr. Baron, and the Dragoman, who is a man of fenfe genteel in his deportment, and we are told, of a very confiderable for- tune, which is made in fome meafure fecure to him by his connedion with the Englijb nation. Our party are now all recovering; we have better fpirits, and tolerable Auguft good appetites. Meff. Boidge and Pigot, with myfelf, returned all our vifits. Mr. Ktrkhoufe was fo obliging as to go with us. We learned from Mr. Edee, that the Bajha had enquired after us, and told him of our great hurry to get from him, as well as of his own re- lolution to detain us, affigning no other motive for his condud but the great anxiety he was under for our fafety. As Mr. Edee is quite the polite,^ weJ-bied man, doubtlefs he made the Bajha a great many more compliments on our part, than we ever defired he fliould ; fince to this moment we cannot but be of opinion, that he ought to have granted us an efcort many days before he did; by which we fhould fo much the fooner have been freed from our extraordinary hardfhips and fatigues.

This day the Kahier was fo obliging as to make the kindeft enquiries after our welfare. We believe him to be a very valuable man, and to have been much difpofed to have facilitated our journey, had it been in his power. The city of Aleppo has been very fickly for fome months pafl. The ma lignant fever ftill continues here, but its mortality is greatly abated. They do not bury now more than 200 a day, whereas till very lately they loft at lead double that number. The natives for fome time paft have been under continual apprehenfion of the Europeans Ihutting themfelves up in their houfes, which ftep it feems is always deemed an indifputable fign of the plague prevailing here. This dreadful calamity has ufually vifited the citizens of Aleppo, once in 12 or 13 years. As far as I can find, there is but little difference between the prefcnt malignant fever, and what is com monly called the plague; the fooner therefore we get from hence, the better *. Augu ft 12.

The fhocking accounts related to me on this fubjeft, would appear fabulous, were ' they not confirmed by numberlefs eye-witnefTes, both Europeans and natives. In many places the inhabitants were driven to fuch extremities, that women were known to eat their ' own children, as foon as they expired in their arms, for want of nouriftiment.—Numbers ** of perfons from the mountains and villages adjacent came daily to Aleppo, to offer their wives and children to fale for a few dollars, to procure a temporary fubliftence for them- ' felves : and hourly might be feen in our llreets, dogs and human creatures fcratching to- &lt;i gether on the fame dunghill, and quarrelling for a bone or piece of carrion, to allay their ' hunger.

Mr. Hollow ay, the chaplain of the fa&lt;51ory, was fo far recovered of his late indiipofition, as to be able to perform divine fervice to day ; we all with much gratitude and devotion offered up our thanks to God for our fafe arrival here, after fo long, painful, and dangerous a journey. x v .-I. We put into the conful's hands, fome little prefents, intended for the Monday, good fathers at Diarbekir, as a fmall teftimony of our gratitude for the kind Auguil 14* offices they did us in our diftrefs. We alio left with the fame gentleman, our beft compliments and thanks to every one of our other friends upon the road, defiring our countrymen to behave kindly to them for our fakes, fhould they have opportunity. To-day likewife, but with great reluc tance, we lent a prefent of a gold watch to Abdallah Bajha. This, or fomething of equal value, had been demanded of our Dragoman by his minifter. We for fome time determined not to give it; but applying to Mr. Drummond for his advice, he told us, that as it had been de manded, we could not, confiltent with the intereft of future travellers, do otherwife than lend it. Abdallah therefore had the watch, and we (in our opinion) a full difcharge or every obligation we owed him for all thofe high marks of refpecl, favour, and protedtion, which he pretended he had conferred upon us. The Kahier and under fervants had alfo prefents from us, but with this difference, that what we parted with to them, was with the greateft alacrity,. As the ifland of Cyprus feemed to be the moft proper place for ns to get a paffage down the Streights, we relblved to proceed thither : and as Mr. Baron's, affairs call him to Latichea, we (hall fet out with him this evening for that city ; it being the nearcft port for taking boat for Cyprus. I was tall to much out of order, that nothing but the earnel]: defire of getting one ftep farther towards my native country, could pof- fibly induce me to leave this place. But the ' Amor Patriae' gets the better of every other confideration. Mr. Doidge this afternoon addreffed two letters to Mefl. Shaw and Garden^ complaining, bitterly of. the treacherous behaviour of Cojee Raphael. The laft perfon we took leave of at Aleppo, was our very worthy and faithful Aga •, to whom, befides the 500 piaftres we promifed him, we gave fuch additional prefents as would have made him perfectly happy, had he not been apprehenfive of being robbed of them when he re turned back to Baghdad, by the very Kahier who engaged him in our fervice. It is a maxim of Turkijh policy, that their great men having purchafed their offices at an immenfe expence, (hall be allowed to lick themlelves whole, by plundering the effects of thofe who live under them ; and hereby the great end of their empire is moll etfeftually ferved, which is, to break the fpirits of the generality of the people by heavy exadbioas, and to ■ accuftom * Stiijf' it !&gt;£• m[ 374 ] accnftom them to bear all manner of injuftice and opprefllon with a perfeA fubmiflion. At half paft four in the afternoon we all mounted on horfeback, and left the city of Aleppo ; for the firft hour and half we were accompanied by the conful, and almoft all the other gentlemen of the Englijh fadory, whofe horfes and furniture made a gay appearance. We then halted at a well of good water, where we drank a parting glafs in wine or punch, ex changed a mutual huzza^ and then pronounced Vale, farewell not with out the lively hope of meeting again at fome future period in our native country. We kept on a S. S. W. courfe, and at half paft eight, pitched our tent by the fide of a river very near to a Kaun, and not far from a village called Cantaman. Poor Mr. Hollow ay made it a point to accompany us thus far, though he now is, and has been in an ill ftate of health for the laft two years. We moft fincerely wifh him a perfeft recovery j for nobody can help efteeming fo worthy, fenfible, and pious a man. At five in the morning we again mounted our horfes, and after having taken an affecflionate leave of Mr. Holloway, we purfued a W. S. W. S. W. and S. S. W. courfe, for eight hours, over a ftony road : we then got to a vil lage named Benifo, feated on a hill. In our way hither, we left feveral other fmall places, both on our right and left. The two lad hours pafled away very unhappily, efpecially with myfelf, my man Alexander^ and my poor grey horfe, which was one of the two, Baron Kniphaufen had prefented us with at Karec. The mafter was ready to fink under a very excruciating pain in his fide, the fervant complained of being worfe in his bowels, and the poor horfe was feized in fo violent a manner as to fall down in the road; his agonies were fuch, that at one time we determined, out of companion, and trom a perfuafion that he never could get up again, to fhoot him; after however he had lain about an hour, he fo far recovered as to be able to get flowly to this place. The pain in my fide continued fo bad, that Mr. Pigot drew fome blood from my arm, fomented the part affeded with hot water, and rubbed in fome mercurial ointment. In the evening, I took a mercurial pill, with opium, and diluted freely. I find myfelf better this morning, but not fo well as to proceed in my journey. My cafe is bilious, for every copious difcharge of the in- teftinal tube gives me immediate relief in th^ hepatic duds, and lobes of the liver. Alexander^ and the other faithful companion of my travels, my grey horfe, are alfo better. This morning I was prevailed upon to offer my medical advice for the relief of a fick youth, the fon of the ^urk whofe roof we are under; but at noon, was told by the father, with the m jft perfect compofure, that ' His JonC 37S ] fon is gone to Paradife. About four o'clock in the afternoon, a 1758 traveller entered the village, who, a few hours before, had been robbed by two armed fellows of 160 piaftres. At half paft five we fet off from Benijh, and travelled four hours and half through an extenfive grove of dead olive-trees, which had been killed by the feverity of the winter in the year 1756. This plantation brought us near to the large village of Eadlip, whole environs are fernle in corn Eadlik - and tobacco. Here are alfo plantations of mulberry-trees, preferved for the Silk-worm. By twelve at night, we had palled by a high hill or moun tain, and entered upon a large plain, called Roudge, where is a well of water, and from whence we difcovered feveral fires at a diftance, which our fervants told us belonged to fome encampments of Arahs^ though they appeared to be nothing more than the burning of Hubble or weeds. We fhould have been glad to have tarried longer here, but our country attend ants grew uneafy, knowing it to be the molt dangerous fpot, and the moft infefted by robbers of any in the whole way between Aleppo and Latkhea.. We therefore armed ourfelves, and proceeded in a more regular order than we had done before.. At two in the morning we had gotten over the plain, and reached iS. a watch-houfe, placed on the fide of a rock to our right. Here a party of foldiers is always ftationed, intended to proteft travellers palling this way, who upon this account, are obliged to pay a toll. It was at firft demanded of us for every man and beaft; but upon their being told that we were Englijhmen, we were fuffered to pals on, makinpr a prefent of but one Sequin to the commanding officer. At half paft four we got to the village Shoger, greatly fatigued with a journey of eleven hours, Shogkr., in which we took many different courfes. S. one hour; S. W. three; S. S. W. two and a quarter •, W. and W. N. W. and N. N. W. four and three quarters. We put up at a Caravanferah^ not chufing to be at the ex- pence of making prelents, which muit have been the cafe, had we taken an apartment in the governor 's palace. Shoger is by no means an incom erable place. It has a governor, a man of fome confequence, who is not appointed by the Grand Seignior^ but by a private lord; the revenues of the village^ and the country near it, being by the imperial bounty, the property of a Vizier family. Here are fome Mofques with Minarets^ all feated on a hill. Juft before we arrived at this village, we paffed over the river Orontes, Orontes river; by a ftone-bridge ol feven or eight arches. The bridge is the largeft we had crofled for fome time ; for though the river is in general not very wide, yet at this place it occupies a large fpace,. owing to a confiderable ifland in the midft ot it, which occafions the water to fpread and become quite (hallow. The bridge is about forty yards over; but a little below, the Orontes is not more than twenty yards broad. From the accounts given b y.(C [ 37 6 3 1758. by ancient writers, I had fancied the Orontes to be a much larger river^ i-- than what we found it to be. Ovid mentions it with the moft confider- able rivers in the then known world. ' Arfit et Euphrates Babylonius, arfit 'Orontes^ ' Thermodonque citus, Gangefque, &amp; Phafis, &amp; Ifter.

The Orontes abounds in a variety of excellent fiflb. We had a defire to get fome eels, but were difappointed, althouo;h they are fometimes very plenty here. At fix in the evening we left Shoger for Ingezeek, a village chiefly inhabited by Greek Chrijlians, wiiere we arrived at halt paft feven, after having croflcd a very large and high mountain. Our courie was W. N. W. and W. S. W. This evening we had a view of mount Cafius which is faid to be to high, that on the top of it one may lee day in the eaft, and night in the weft at the lame time. According to Plmy^ the mount is four miles high in a perpendicular line. Lucan Ipeaks of a mount Cafms near Egypt.

During our (lay at Ingezeek we made ufe of the Chrijiian Papa's houfe, where we found every thing extremely mean. Fortunately for us, our conlul at Latichea, to whom Mr. Baron had written a letter from Benijh, had fent hither a fupply of wine and provifion for us. We left Ingezeek about fix this morning, and travelled over fuch high mountains, that if we had occafion to write a letter from hence, we might with great propriety have dated it, from the clouds, which were flying much below as well as above us. Thefe mountains have a great plenty of trees and fhrubs growing on them. The fir, live-oak, crab-apple, and pear, are among the trees, and the myrtle among the fhrubs.—We found the air here very (harp, and fometimes damp. At eleven we refted near a watch-houfe, and continued there till four in the afternoon. We were fheltered by a fine grove of fycamores, and a pleafant ftream of water ran by our fide. From four till half paft five, we went on through plealant vales interfered by rivulets, whofe banks were blooming with the oleander and other flowers, and fliadcd at the fame time with mulberry-trees. 3 Hence[ 377 1 Hence we had the pleafure to fee on the top of a hill juft before us, Mr. 175S. Beaumefter the Britijh conful of Latichea, who, with Mr. Jdfper Cruter the Dragoman, and his brother a doftorof phyfic, were come thus far to meetus^ We foon joined their company, and from the hill we were ravifhed with the tranfporting view of the Mediterranean fea. It is impoffible to exprefs the joy which this delightful profpedl gave us, and how eagerly we feafted our selves on a fight which we had fo long and fo paffionately fighed after. We began now to think that all our difficulties were at an end, and the cime not far off when we fhould be landed on that happy, native fhore, where all our hopes and wiihes centered. We continued to advance with our new companions till feven o'clock, having upon the whole of this ftage, made a W. S. W. courfe ; and then difmounted, and betook ourfelves to an handfome tent, which the conful had ordered to be pitched the day before, purpofely for our reception, near the village of Balearea. Here we found B alearea plenty of provifion, but my indifpofition would not permit me to tafte of it. Augull B esnada We got on horfeback before fix in the morning, travelled till nine, W. by S. through a moft agreeable country, abounding in Indian corn, and plantations of olive and mulberry-trees. We met with a fmall river alfo in our way, and feveral runs of water. The ground was quite covered with myrtle and oleander bufhes, in full bloom. We alighted at the conful's country houfe, which is feated on a hill near the village Befnada, about two miles from Latichea, and the fame diftance from the fea. From this fpot you have a moft delightful profped of the town, and of mount Li- hanus, and of the Mediterranean. The ifland of Cyprus bears from this houfe about S. W. and is diftant twenty leagues. The conful's country houfe at Befnada, was flored with every kind of Augull 23. refrefliment, and we flattered ourfelves that notwithftanding our long and fatiguing journey *, we fhould all be fpeedily reftored to our former health * A table of the diftance between each of the capital cities and towns in our route from Bajjcra to Latichea, From Bajfora — to Coma ■ to Cot a ■ to Dewana — to Htlla ■■ to Baghdad —- to Kircoote — to dwela — to Mojul ' to Nijihin —— to yfr/a to Diarhekir —- to Bir ■ to Jtkppo to Coma Cota Deivana • Hilla Baghdad Kircoote Ar&lt;vela ■ Moful Nijihin Arin Diarhekir Bir Aleppo Latichea Total of Miles C c c175 s - Auguft 24.

Our whole party however, except Mr. Pigot and felf, made a fhift to get to Latichea yefterday with the conful. They learnt there, that his majefty's fhip the Amhufcade Captain Gwyn, is now at Cyprus, to which ifland he has lately carried a fmall French prize. Mr. Doidge and I, in confequcnce of the above intelligence, wrote each of us a letter to Captain Gwyn at Cyprus *, likewife two others addreffed to the fame officer at Scanderoon, on a fuppofition that the Ambuf- cade might poffibly have left Cyprus for this laft place. Mr. Doidge wrore alfo to Captain Evans of the Prefton at Scanderoon. Thefe letters related to our future proceedings, and Mr. Doidge's were direfbed on u his Majefty's- fervice.' Auguft 27. This evening our good friend Mr. Baron left us in his way back to Aleppo \ he will foon proceed to Scanderoon to fucceed Mr. Brown as conful^ the latter being appointed fucceflbr to Mr. Drummond at Aleppo, when he fhali return for England* Auguflzp. Auguft 31. Mr. Pye was feized yefterday afternoon with troublefome blotches all over his body, and an univerfal itching of the Ikin. Laft night he fainted, but recovered again upon being carried into the open air. This morning he took an emetic, but has not been well all day. His fkin is inflamed and fwoln, and his pulfe naturally loft, now labours greatly. At night he took the third part of a paper of Dr. James 1 % powder; this morning we found him almoft perfeflly recovered. An account is juft come from Scattderootty that Captain 'Turner, commander of one of our Turky fhips there, is ill; and that a malignant diforder pre vails among the crew, which has already carried off his furgeon, and five private men. I find myfelf rather better to-day, my bowels are ftill in a weak ftate. I bathed this evening in the fea, hoping thereby to brace up my relaxed conftitution. The boat we had difpatched with our letters to Cyprus, returned this morning with an account, that Captain Gwyn failed from thence laft JVednef- day fe'nnight, to the weftward. He is fuppofed to be gone to the Eng- lijh fleet for fait provifions, and to clean, and get freflb orders. The realon lie gave for taking this ftep, was, the little probability of the Turky traders being foon ready to fail under his convoy, becaufe of the plague ftill raging with great violence at Smyrna. A letter from Scanderoon, in anfwer to Mr. Doidge*s, addrefled to Captain Evans, fays, ' We know not where. Captain Evans is, and have not had the leaft intelligence of late from Smyrna ' Mr. Turner, who is ftationed at Cyprus, recommends, our: going*at® IN I Kit m fkii if: |i P r k!/ [ 379 ]f going immediately to that ifland, and from thence taking our pafTage to Alexandria, from which port, he fays, fhips are frequently going to Leghorn. We are defirous of firft having fome certain account of the Prejton, Captain Evans, who probably may ftill continue in thefe feas to take under his convoy a part of the Turky trade : yet we are appre- henfive alfo of his tarrying here too long for our purpofe, by being obliged to wait for the fhips now. lying at Smyrna \ and fhould that be the cafe, it is very pofllble that he will not arrive in England before the fpring, fince the merchant fhips cannot begin to take in their cargoes till the plague has ceafed forty days, and when that will be, God only knows! Mr. Doidge has been treating with the mafter of a Ragufan veflel to carry Septembers us to Malta, where, we have not the leaft doubt, but we fhall meet with fome of our own men of war belonging to the grand fleet. They could not however agree about the price. The Ragufan at firft demanded 2500 piaftres, but afterwards came down to 2000 j Mr. Doidge would only give him j 500, fo they parted. My fellow-travellers Meflrs Doidge and Pye, being beyond meafure anxi- September 3 ous to arrive in England, on account of the difpatches with which the former is charged to the miniftry, admiralty, and the Eaft India company, and alfo to fettle our deceafed friend Admiral Wat Jon's affairs, they therefore (with my full confent) refolved to-day to proceed to Malta in the Ragufan veffel, hoping by this means to get to the commanding officer of our fleet, who probably might think it expedient to difpatch a frigate with them to England. Lieutenant Alms too, whofe expeftation of preferment prefled him to get home as foon as poffible, and Mr. Pigot, who wifhes to pur- fue his ftudies fome months next winter in London, determined to accom pany them. Having with pain refledled on my unhappy flate of health, and the many inconveniences that muft inevitably arife from fo many fickly people being crowded together in the cabbin of a veflel of only 1 50 tuns burthen, I refolved to tarry behind in this place, till my health fhall be better efta- bliihed ; or till the Prefion with the 'Turky trade fhall fail for England, or a better and more commodious opportunity offers than at prefent. About feven this evening, my dear friends took a mofl affedling leave Monday, of me, and foon after left Befnada for Latichea. At eleven they embarked September 4, in the Ragufan vefTel, and immediately fet fail, taking with them Benjamin Jenkins, and Toney the black boy. They are to give 1800 piaflres for this paffage to Malta \ but fhould they on their arrival at that ifland, get cer tain intelligence of our fleet being only 20 or 30 leagues to the weftward, then the mafter on his being applied to, is to put them on board the admiral's fliip, and be paid 200 additional piaftres. C c c 2 This[ 3*0 ] This day arrived here in the conful's boat from Cyprus, Mr. Prefton, a ^ \ young gentleman late from Leghorn and England, in his way to Aleppo-y September 5. where he is going to refide as a merchant, in the houfe of Mr. Free. September 8. I wrote another letter to Captain Evans of the Prefion, and fent it to Scanderoon r I fent alfo duplicates of the fame to Cyprus, to beg the favour of a paflfage in his fhip. Conful Beaumefter difpatched a Mefs or packet, for Aleppo this afternoon ; I embraced the opportunity of writing to Meffrsr. JDrummond and Baron, and fent by the fame meffenger a parcel which Mr.. Doidge had left for Mr. Shaw at Bajfora. Septemb^u . received advice from Aleppo, that the plague ftill rages at Conjlanti- nople, but had ceafed at Smyrna the 5th of laft month: the 14th inftant therefore will be the fortieth day from its ceflation ; the fhips at this lafl: place, we prefume, will then, according to cuftom, begin to take in their lading. This advice, which comes from one of our merchants at Aleppo,. farther tells us, that the Prejlon, with the fhips under her convoy, will nor be able to fail from Smyrna till the id of Ottoher, * 0 Septemb. 12. I thank God I am much better to-day. My pains are gone, and the flux greatly leifened, For the firft time I now drank a glafs of tar-water, and rode with the conful to Latichea* Septemb. 13. j continue to drink tar-water, and have received great benefit from it. I rode again to the town with the conful, Mr. Prejton, and Mr. Jafper Cruter. This laft gentleman was fo obliging as to fhew Mr. Prejton and me, the marine-yard, and the mole or imall harbour, wherein were 12 French fhips, from 150 to 200 tuns burthen, whofe employ is to carry Turkijh goods, and Jew paifengers from port to port: they are called Caravanferahs.- We afterwards vifited the remains of two triumphal arches,, which are fo tully delcribed in Mr. DrummoncFs book of travels, that it would juitly be deemed impertinent in me to fay any thing of them. We then paid a vifit to Mr. Clinkey, who adts here as vice-conful for the Dtitch and Germans. In cur way to this gentleman's houfe, we paffed through feveral ftreets, in which are colonnades (mentioned alfo by Mr. T)rummond) and Bazars, or market-places, kept in good order. liATlCHEA. Latichea is a pretty large town, built of good ftone got from the fea- fhore. It has fix or feven Mofques with Minarets, and the houfes are better built than the 'Turkifh ones are in general. The governor is appointed by t\\t Bajha oi 'Tripoli: He is abfolute in his power, of which he has given a mofb convincing proof fince our arrival at Befnada, having ordered three criminals to be impaled, for a robbery on the highway. This punifhinent was inflicted immediately upon their being taken, without waiting for the tedious form of a trial. 3 Myr j &lt; My health continues to mend.—This evening the whole family took a I7r ^ ride to the conful s new plantation of mulberry and cotton trees, three ' -^ * miles to the northward of Befnadci^ and mount Cafius appeared to be about Septemb. 20 miles diftant from it. To the N. E. of Latichea, for fome miles, all the rocks near the fea fhew the remains of ancient wbrkmanfhip. Large excavations are to be feen in many of them, which Mr. Drummond very properly fuppofes to have been chiefly Catacombs or tombs for the dead, though fome of them appeared to nie, to have been- rather grottos for the living. The conful and his company entertained us to -day with the Gereed. The figs are now ripe, and in confequence we have great plenty of Becca-ficca birds and Ortolans. They are about the fize of a bull-finch, exceedingly fat, and the tafte of their flefii is generally efteemed as exquifitely good* I had the mortification to hear to-day from the Patroon belonging to the Septemb. 161 confuFs boat, that by letters received from Smyrna of the 21ft ult. the pfague then continued to rage there, and that it had made its way into the neighbouring iflands. If this be true, how diftant yet are my hopes of getting to England ! Letters received this day from Mr. Drummond bring no public news. He Septemb. 17. fays, he writes in hade, and intends detaining the packet, till letters ar rive from Conftantinople, which are daily expedted. We went this day to Latichea, and there learned, that two Engliflx Monday,, privateers were arrived at Cyprus-, and that two French merchant fhips Se P te mb. iB* alio had put in there, only eleven days in their pafifage from Marfeilles. In a letter received by Mr. Beaumefter from Mr. Conful Drummond, the conful advifed, that he defigns being at Latichea in the beginning of Oftober, from whence he intends going on board Captain T^rwr's fhip, and failing ink under convoy to England. This circumftance gives me frefh hope of the plague having cealed, and of the fpeedy failing of the Prefion man of war. This evening at ten o'clock Mr. Prefion fet out for Aleppo. Mr. Free had fent a fervant and horfes for him, and Mr. Jafper Cruter the Dra goman^ accompanied him. We took another ride to Latichea, where, to the furprize of the conful, Septemb 20. he learnt, that his uncle Mr. Purnel (brother to the gentleman of that name at Bajfora, and predecefifor as conful and merchant to his nephew here) was juft arrived from England, but laft from Leghorn. He travelled through France and Italy. We flept laft night zrLatichea, where I found the air much warmer than Septemb. 21, here at Befnada. Every body complained of it; but as it was not by any means to be compared with what I had lately felt, I was not in the leaft in commoded. I'i[ 382 ] commoded. The houfe, ever fince Mr. Purnel arrived, hath been full of vifitors, compofed of the chief Turh of Latichea. The following is part of a letter I received this morning from Mr. Drum' mond. « I wifli your brother travellers a happy voyage, but am extremely ' forry you was not able to go with them. A Swede, now lying at Scan- « deroon, may poflibly get fome goods for Leghorn. If that (hould be ' the cafe, I would advife you by all means to go in her, « At Cyprus you lie in the way of all that offers; and were I there with ' my bufinefs finifhed, I fhould certainly move off with the firft veflel; for ' God knows whether we may fee a convoy fooner than the end of No- ' vemher. At prefent my affairs are fo uncertain, that I dare not think of form ing any fcheme one way or the other. I have been acquainted with ' German roads in winter, but 1 was then young. In any fhape, your company would be a pleafure to me •, but I carry no fervant farther than Cyprus, for they can be of no ufe to a traveller. Were I to go by Leg horn, I fhould chufe the Swijs road, but all at prefent, with me, is build ing caftles in the air. ' I know you have many reafons for wifliing yourfelf at home; I there fore hope you will meet with fome good opportunity, without a thought ' of me, who feem in no fhape my own mafter.—Nothing promifes more to make you eafy, than the Swede I have before-mentioned.' As Meff. Drummond and Purnel are both of opinion, that Leghorn is the place I ought to go to *, and fince the convoy probably will not be ready till the end of November, and both myfelf and fervant are now in tolerable health, I refolved to let out for Cyprus as foon as poffible •, hoping we ihall be better able to encounter the cold of the Alps in the winter, than we were the excefTive heats of Turky lafl fummer, Yefterday I rode out in the evening with MefT. Purnel and BeaUmefief. To-day 1 wrote a letter of compliments and thanks in my own and fellow- travellers names, to Emanuel, bifhop of Babylon ; and another to Mr. Shaw at Baffora i putting them under the care of Conful Drummond. A Leghornefe being bound to Cyprus, I agreed to take my pafTage in her to that iiland, and fent on board my baggage. Mr. Beaumejler was lb obliging as to accept of the two horfes, which Baron Kniphaufen made us a prefent of. In the evening I wrote a letter, and fent it in a boat to Cy- prusy MkMQ' ■■[ ■ 383 I prus&gt; to Mr. Turner, begging the favour of him to fccure ms a raffao-e in the Swede bound to Leghorn. ■ A Mefs, juft now arrived from Mr. Jafper Cruter at Aleppo, brings the Septemb. 29. melancholy news of the death of the Rev. Mr. Hollow ay, and of the verv dangerous ftate of Mr. Conful Browne, juft returned thither from Scanderocn where he caught the infedlion. Mr. Cruter in his letter informs us alfo' that the plague ceafed at Smyrna the 20th of Auguft, but that the P reft on is blocked up there by three French fhips of war. That Captain Gwyn is. ordered to fail to her affiftance, but as his fliip the Ambufcade is gone to the weftward, thofe orders probably will never reach him. The wind hath been, and ftill continues foul for Cyprus -, which circum- Septemb. ?oi fiance, (as I have fome return of my bilious complaints) is not unlucky; and I am told, that the Swede will not fail for Leghorn in- lefs than three weeks. The wind is now fair for our failing, and I am in all refpefts ready to oaober 1. embark; but the vefiel has not taken in her water, and the Italians will do no work on a Sunday. By the conful's boat, which arrived this day from Cyprus^ I had the fatis- Monday,, fadloa to receive the two following letters^- Oftoberz* Cyprus, 12 th of September, ' FOUR days after weleft you, my dear Ned, we arrived at this place. The news we firft learnt here, was, that the fhips were admitted to prattique at Smyrna, and that the Prejton was gone thither from Scio, in confequence of it. About three hours after fhe got in, three French fhips of war arrived, who had been lying in wak for her. One of them carried 64 guns, the other two were frigates. This news came by letter from Smyrna., and Mr. 'Turner afiures me, it may be depended on ; fo that in all probability, the P reft on will be blocked up till a reinforce ment comes from the fleet ; and that will not be, perhaps, till we carry this news to the admiral. But the captains of two privateers who-' came irv yeflerday, give us hopes that the Prefton mW fail very foon, for they fpoke with a boat in their paffage hither, who told them, the cap tain of the Ptefton had fent to Scio for a pilot to carry him out of Smyrna, and that the French fhips were certainly gone off the ftation : If this latter account fhould prove true, it will not belong I hopre before you hear of the Preftoris being at Scanderoon. If however you do not hear of her foon, there will be an opportunity of going down in the Swede, which is now at Scanderoon ; fhe will ftop here, and proceed from hence to Leghorn, where I hear you may be certain of meeting fome of our cruifers, as that is the port our fleet in common victual at.

I believe it would be proper to difpatch a meflenger to Scan deroon to know the truth of this report, by which you may take your meafures : but I think at all events, your being here as foon as poffible would be beft, for this porf is more in the track for fhips for Europe* than Latichea.

At eleven I embarked on board the Elena Fortunata brig, Giovanni Taddei mafter. Mr. Nun, an Irijh gentleman is the mate, and Moni. Rey, a Frenchman the pilot. The brig carries eight hands, and two guns, half- pounders. At twelve we fet fail for Cyprus, with a fair breeze from the caft. At funfet the next day, twelve minutes before fix, the ifland of Cyprus was feen by our people •, and at twelve at night the day after, we came to an anchor in Salines-bay. About eight in the morning, I went on fhore at Larnica, and found Mr. Turner with his chaiie at the water's fide, waiting to conduft me to his houfc. I was foon vifited by Monf. CV«/fr (father to Jafper Cruter Dra- goman at Latichea) and by many other gentlemen, and loa.e tew ladies.— This evening came in the Swede from Scanderoon bound to Leghorn', a few hours however too late, for the Italian hath been before-hand with her, and engaged the whole of her intended freight. This iOand of Cyprus is fituate between 33 and 36 degrees of eaft longi tude, and 34 and 36 degrees of north latitude, oppofite the fhores of Syria and Cilicia. It extends in length from eaft to weft 220 miles, and is in circuit about 550. The air is io pleafant, the foil fo fruitful, and the hi Is fo abounding with metals, that the ancients called it Macaria, the Happy IJland-, and the inhabitants thereof being a lewd, lafcivious people, it was thence confecrated to Venus, who is frequently ftiled Venus Cypria and Dea Cypri. The firft inhabitants were Cicilians, who yielded to the Phenicians, as they did to the Greeks. Ptolemy the laft king of this ifland, knowing that Cato was fent againft him by the Romans, put an end to his own life. It continued in the hands of the Greek emperors till 656, when it was con quered by xhz Saracens. In 807, the Greeks recovered it; but Richard ift. King of England, going to the holy war in 1 191, and being ill treated by the inhabitants, conquered it, and gave it to Guy Lufignan, whole luc- ceflbrs were difpofiefifed by the Templars in 1306. In i47 2 » Venetians poflefifed themfelves of it-, and in 1560, Selim the Grand Seignior took it, whofe fucceflbrs have enjoyed it to the prefent time. This evening I took a ride with Mr. Turner, to the Salines, or natural Salterns an accurate defcription of which Mr. Brummond hath already given to the public.—To-day we went together to the ifo/Z^'s garden, and toon a view of the aqueduft, by which Larnica is iupplied with water a fpring at the foot of a mountain, fix miles off. ^Wtlti ¥■ W(.^' ilieii [ 387 I . Mr. and I dined this day with our conful, and rode out as ufual in the evening. We vifited a fmall village called fuppofed to be built on the lame fpot as the Cilium of the ancients. The mornines and Od,obcr lo - evenings are fharp, but the middle of the day is yet warm. A boat jult now arrived from Lalicka, with a letter from Jafper Cruter, n a„i,„ ,. who is returned from Aleppo ; which gives me the painful account of ' my friend Mr. Bur on, and his fervant Afioore, being nigh death in a fever of the malignant kind, which attacked them foon after their arrival at Scanderoon. Captain Turner continues alio very weak and low from a diforder he caught there 5 and of which his nephew, and another young gentleman, befides many of his people, died. There alfo, three officers of the Amhufcade got the ficknefs which occafioned their deaths; and thither our little party had certainly gone from Aleppo, had not pro vidence kindly interpofed, and carried us to Latichea. Mr. Cruter's letter alio advifed, that Conful Browne cannot live long -, and that Mr. Brummond is expedled to anive at Latichea as this evening, or to-morrow mornin 0 *. He defigns coming to this ifland, in order to take his paffage with me to Leghorn, there being at prefent no hope of the convoy's failing, as the French Ihips continue to cruize for them off Smyrna. At five this morning, I fet out on horfeback for the top of Mount Croce Odober 18. or St. Crux, in company with Mr. Turner, and his clerk Mr. Michael Clamfon, Alexander M-Intojh, and two other fervants. We rode about W. ww an h0Ur and half throu g h a P lain » having paffed in our way the Jalt fet of {lone arches belonging to the aquedud, and which confifts of 31 to the beft of my remembrance. At fix we left the village Vajirio on our right, and in half an hour, Vudia. We then began to afcend a rifino- ground, and after riding two or three points to the northward of the weftt we got at half pad feven, to a fmall Greek church and convent dedicated to St. Athanajius, fituated between two hills; where, in the rainy feafbn and for fome months after, is a great run of water from the mountains (called by Mr. Brummond, the river Talius) but the bed of it is at prefent dry. On the fides of both thofe hills, are the ruins of many buildings, in appearance very ancient. Some of them are of brick, others of ftone, and they are fevei al miles in extent. We alfo pafied by fome ruins of a more modern date, feated on another hill to our right. The inhabitants frequently dio - up ftones, marble, &amp;c. among the ruins. We continued riding on till half paft eight, ftill afcending, and paffing between mountains covered with the pine, oak, olive, locuft (or Caruhee) and walnut-tree. Here were alfo the hawthorn, myrtle, blackberry, vine, oleander, and other bullies and fhrubs in great plenty. From half paft eight till a quarter after nine, we continued to afcend Monte Croce then we came to another convent, where we difmounted to reft our horfes. In this convent we found two or three Papas or priefts, one of whom was making D d d 2 a pair[ 388 ] 175R. a pair of fhoes. They readily gave us all the afliftance m their power,nor ■ ^ did they think it beneath them to take care of our beads •, fuch was the real, or at leaft feeming humility of thefe holy men. We made free with the Papas kitchen utenfils to drefs the victuals we had brought with us. At eleven, leaving our horfes behind for greater fafety, we mounted on- mules to vifit the Holy Crcfs, a church placed on the very fummit of the mountain, and reached it in about half an hour 's riding. We found there another Papa, and a little boy. The church is fmall, and its walls are built of an iron-ftone found in the neighbourhood. Tradition fays, that this edifice was eredled at the expence of St. Helena the mother of Confiantine r 1400 years ago; though it plainly appears to have been rebuilt fince that time, for not a third part of the ancient wall now remains. They fhew you a large crofs, before which a filk curtain is drawn; and if you will be lieve the priefts, it is inlaid with a part of that very crofs on which our Sa viour was crucified. Devotees never fail coming here once a. year, to offer lip their devotions at the Holy Crofs. From the top of this mountain we had a moft delightful and extenfive profped over the greateft part of the: whole ifland. We clearly faw the following places. Hours.

Both in going and returning, Mr. 'Turner and I thought it neceflary to- difmount and walk over fome particular places, the road being narrow, and the precipices dangerous. We made the Papas at both convents a fmall prefent, with which they appeared very well pleafed. He, who refided in. the laft convent, took our Douceur fo kindly, that, mounting his afs, he gratefully accompanied us for a confiderable way, and Ihewed us the beft turnings in the road. 0&lt;Sober 2o. A letter received this day by Mr. Conful Boddington, brings the melan choly news of the Confuls Browne and Baron being both dead. Advices from Latichea mention, that Mr. Drummond in confequence of the above unfortunate event, and to gratify the factory at Aleppo, had determined to continuer 3 ? 9 i eontlnue there a few months longer.—The fame advices add, that there 175?.- are now five Englijh gtnl\em&lt;tn n Aleppo, travellers from who are v—^ daily expedled at Latichea in their way to England. 1 clofcd to-day with the captain of the Elena Fort-uftata for my own and-O&lt;^ 0 her st, my fervant's paflage to Leghorn.

On my parr, I am to pay him fifty Leghorn fequins in hand, and provided I (hall be thorouo-hly fatisfied with my treatment, ten more,, on my landing at Leghorn. The marriage ceremony was this day performed between- two young O&amp;obcr -zz; perfons, who were Chrijiians. It was intended to have been a public affair, but afterwards changed to a private one, as- the point of precedence could «ot be fettled between the Britijh and French confuls.^ Mr. Turner was fo obliging as to trouble himfelf about my fea-ftock, and? procured me an hogfhead of old Cyprus wine. All the wines almoft of this ifland, have in them a peculiar tafte of tar; this is owing to the vineyards &lt; lying on the fides, or at the foot of the mountains which are covered with pine trees, whofe juices wafhed down by the rains, impart this flavour to- the grapes.. The wind blew this morning from the N; E. which brought the coldefl oaober 2** weather-1 have known for fome years, and obliged me to have a fire. This afternoon, four of the Englijh gentlemen from India, Meflrs. Gregory, oaober 26, Nottingham, Bailey, and Fajley arrived here, having left one of their party behind at Aleppo \ and at five o'clock they paid me a vifit.- I returned their vifit this moming, and made them an offer of the ufe Oaober 27, of the great cabbin with me, provided they were inclinable to go in the Leghornefi veffel.. They expreffed themfelves greatly obliged to &amp; me, and agreed with the captain for a paffage for themfelves and fervants. They left Bengal in February laft ; touched at Karec and Bajfora, and brought a' letter from Baron Kniphaufen addreffed to Mr. Doidge and me, which I efteem ■ fo great an addition to his former favours, that 1 cannot help tranfcribincr: it..

They concluded with telling me, that Lieutenant Cormick of the Tyger, and Captain Young of the army, were dead ; but thac all my other particular friends, except Captain Smith, were in good health. v In the evening we rode out, and vifited thofe other remains of antiquity, mentioned in Drummond's travels, p. 251. We went alfo to the marine town, and faw the church of St. Lazarus. ThtPapas told us, it is now 1722 years fince he was buried here. This faint is he, whom our Saviour railed from the dead. They (hewed us the end of his coffin under ground, and defired us to take notice of fome fcraps of rags and ends of thread brought hither by thofe who have been favoured with the afliftance of the faint. The end. of what they call the coffin, has been pitched or befmeared with fome bitumenous fubftance, defigned to impofe upon the ignorant and credulous, as moifture iffuing from the faint's body.

We paid our farewel compliments to the conful in the morning, who ■with his Chancellor^ returned the vifit a few minutes afterwards i and we went on board. My very worthy and obliging friend Mr. Turner made us a vifit on board the Elena Brig, and finding the captain not inclined for failing, infifted on taking us afhore again. We yielded, and in our way paid our refpeds to the conful, but fpent the day with Mr. Turner, who at our requeit, procured for us two hogfheads of water, fome charcoal, and other culinary necef- faries, which we on examination thought the veffel wanted, though the captain and pilot both infifted on the contrary. Mr. Turner accompanied us on board in the evening, and after fupping with us, left the fhip about nine; when we weighed anchor, took leave of the illand of Cyprus, and put to fea, fteering the proper courfe for the port of Leghorn in Italy. As the dull detail of a fea-journal can afford but little entertainment j it will be fufficient to obferve in general, that after the moft dillrefsful and alarming voyage I ever made i (owing chiefly to the inexperience of our young commander, who had been bred a clerk in a merchant's office) we hap pily came to an anchor in Leghorn road on the 4th of December.

This has been a fhort, yet one of the moft threatning attacks I ever had in my bowels; owing to my clofe confinement, the cold wet weather, and the want of every conveniency when on £hip-board. To thefe may be added, the heavy rains to which we were expofed on coming alhore, and the extreme cold and damp air of the Lazaretto, whofe rooms have been .untenanted, and without a fire for 18 or 20 days paft. The conful repeated his vifit with Mr. AJkew, this evening. This was December 16. the firft time I had an opportunity of paying him my perfonal refpedts. He ^ave us great fpirits, by affuring us, that our quarantine would be but of thirty days continuance; and he added, that of thofe thirty, he believed he fhould be able to get off five, provided we could refolve to leave all our wearing apparel behind us. With pleafure we accepted of the propofal, and gave our orders to taylors, fhoe-makers, to accommodate us with every thing new; for, as Addifon obferves, ' A day, an hour of precious liberty, ' Is worth a whole eternity in bondage.' f I thank God, I am once more happily reftored to health.—Our little Decenjbcrl7 .. -community aflembled this morning, and read the prayers of the church, offering up our moft devout thanks to heaven for its kind protedtion hitherto. Mr. and Mrs. Level, to whom Mr. Pajley had been recommended, have Monday, been very civil and complaifant, in fending us feveral things from their December iV own kitchen.—The confyl too has been exceedingly kind, fencing us rum E e e 2 and 'Mi-, : ■ Tmlif li II tin HI[ 396 i75 g - an^ beer j and wc are under a thoufand obligations of this kind to Mefirs. Becher and AJkew. — A moft melancholy piece of news reached us this morning •, that' a Ragufan veflel from Turns, with the French conful and his family on board, had been wrecked on the ifland of Corfica, and the whole crew except fix men, periihed. Had not Meffrs. Bailey and Gregory one night of our paflage, defignedly raifed a falfe alarm ©f feeing land, wc fliould 3 certainly have met with the lame fate as this Ragufan veflel. Thefe gentlemen not fatisfied with the courfe we were fleering, intreated the captain to haul up two or three points more to the northward, which he, by the advice of his pilot, refufed to do ; but was at laft brought to it by Mr. Gre gorys calling aloud 'Land!' which, though not at that time feen, yet by the bearings of Corfica from us the next morning, it plainly appeared that had we continued our firft courfe, we mufl: inevitably ha# been upon the rocks before break of day. We have had dreadful accounts lately of Ihip- wrecks in the gulph of Venice. —God grant that my friends are well! Becemberzt. Heaven be praifed!—This evening Mr. Becher fent me a letter he had received from Venice-, which fays, that ' fome gentlemen from/«^, who em- ' barked at Cyprus in the St. Blaijfe of Ragufa for Malta, are, and have ' been fome time in the Lazaretto, and will be at liberty by about the ' time the Leghorn poll fhall return thither.'—I immediately difpatched a letter to Mr. Doidge at Venice. I&gt;ecember23. Meflrs. Becher, AJkew, and the Rev. Mr. Hut chinfon chaplain to the faftory, vifited us. In the courfe of our converfation fome doubts arole refpedting the length of our quarantine, whether it will continue 30 or 40 days; we hope for the beft. Many French gentlemen are in this Lazaretto, from whom we found that things are in a very bad fituation in France, and that nothing but murmurings are to be heard among the people. On-' my oblerving, that there were new fquadrons fitting out in the ports of Brejl and Toulon, one of them, fhrugging up his (boulders, anfwered, ' To what, end, unlefs to be carried into your harbours!' SccqsjberzS. This day the confut and yir. AJkew came to pay us a vifit, and brought with them the doleful tidings of our being obliged to perform a forty days quarantine. However, the conful gave us fome little comfort, by re-al- furing us that the five days grace would be allowed, by a change of clothes. We told him we were prepared for that, and fhould rejoice at even but five hours addition to our liberty. We begged his pardon, if he difcovered any degree of impatience in our anfwer, affuring him, we were perfeftly fenfible of his friendly endeavours and wifhes to ferve us.—He was fo obliging as to place all we faid to its proper account. I could not but obferve, that three Cyprian birds were fuffered to be taken out of the Lazaretto to-day for the governor's own ufe. Surely our naked bodies cannot be fuppofed to retain more infedion, than the feathers of thefe. animals. ThiVt 397 3 This evening we received a letter from the conful^as Allows: ' He is 175&amp;. 6&lt; forry to acquaint us, of his being informed by the chancellor of health, ^—s'—* ' that the magiflrrates of Florence having received late accounts of the plague Decemb ^ r2 9 ' breaking out at Salonica and the neighbouring places, have direfted that the grace of five days lliall not be allowed us : but yet that the chancellor ' has advifed him to apply to the governor for our being permitted to take ' t the advantage of them, promifing to back his requeftadding, he thinks it very probable he fhall fucceed. The captain of the Lazaretto, whofe behaviour to us has been exceedingly 175^.^ polite, having applied to the chancellor and governor, to indulge us with Monday,, the five days grace, this morning received for anfwer, that ' the quarantine J anuar y l ' ' is an affair determined upon at Florence^ from which the magiftracy of M Leghorn cannot deviateo' This morning, I received with a pleafure not to be exprefied, a long letter from my faithful and valuable friend Mr. Doidge. I fliall tranfcribe fo much of itj as will ferve to give the reader a proper idea of what he andv his party underwent after their parting with me at Latichea. ' My dear Friend, Venice, 29 December; 1758. ' I really do not know how to go about to tell you, the furprize, the joy,. ' the concern, I' felt all together, at the receipt of your letter of the 22di ' inftant, which was brought to me laft night. Had the poft returnedt 4t immediately, it muft have gone without my anfvver, fuch was the hurry ' and perturbation of my fpirits! but I am made happy in having this- ' whole morning to write to you, for I have a thoufand things to lay. ** In the firft place,.. I moft fincerely thank God that you are fafely ' landed at Leghorn, and. hope by the route you propofe to take, you willi 41 have a pleafant and entertaining journey home-, where 1 fhall not expeft^ to fee you till the latter end of March, or beginning of April. You might well be furprized at hearing of our being here, but you 5 ' know, my dear Ned, there is no contending with fate; we endeavoured' ' to get to Malta, but it was impcflible ; and I afiure you we are all very * ' thankful for our being fafely landed here, it being more than we expelled.- 'To give you any tolerable idea of our voyage, I muft carry you back to- ' Cyprus, from whence we failed the 14th of September. We had nothing ; ' but contrary winds and bad weather all the way to Rhodes, where we 44 arrived the 6th of Ocloher. Upon examining into our Itock of provifions,, ^ we found that by being fo long out, it became necefiary to get a recruit, 44 as well as to fill our cafks with water; this we had been obliged to do 3 44 once before, between and that ifle; the rafcal of a captain having; 44 moft villainoufly deceived us in this article, by the account given in, &gt; • 4 before we failed. The 9th of Ottober we left Rhodes, and carried with 44 U5 our old luck, nothing but contrary winds, till we got the length of:' 3 ' Modon[ 393 ] 1759' ' Modon, in the Morea, when a gale fprung up from the -foufh, and blew -v—' u hard we intended to have (topped at Modon to complete our water, ' being reduced to the laft cafk, but our captain informed us it was impof- ' fible to lie in Modon road, with that wind, and that he could carry us to « another place more fafe and convenient; at the fame time hinting, that ' he could not think of going to fea (though the wind was tolerably fair) 46 until the weather became more moderate. He often talked oiVenice^ and ' of the wind being fair for that port. We perceiving his drift, confulted \ *' together, as to what was beft to be done, and at laft agreed to take ad- v vantage of the foutherly wind, and make a puili for Venice, without « flopping any where till we fliould be forced to do lb for water. Accord- ingly we bore away, and fleered our courfe for this place; but, before we arrived, which was not till the 8th of laft month, many were the difficul- ' ties and dangers we had to encounter. I often rejoiced you was not with ' us, hoping, my dear Ned, that you was at your eale on board the Prefton j for I could not be fure of your being in the Swede. Indeed, had I the ' leaft thought of your getting into Leghorn, you know I would not have omitted writing to you. However, I muft again thank providence we ' are both in the land of the living •, and I hope by and by, the re- ' counting of thefe difficulties and difappointmeats will afford us much ' pleafure. ' You may fuppofe I was not long here, before I wrote to all my friends in England ; among the reft, you will be fure I did not negled our friend Cap- ' tain Speke, from whom I have received an anfwer, the copy of which I in- ' clofe you for your information. Befides the bufinefs it fpeaksof, it willlhew ' the high regard which that great and good man has for us both. He has ' fet my heart at eafe, for 1 was fearful of being cenfured for having idled ' away my time. ' As foon as we arrived here, I wrote a letter to Mr. Murray the Englifh ' minifter, to acquaint him with our fituation, and the public difpatcheswe ' had in our cuftody. He very genteely fent his fecretary to us, to inform ' us of every thing we wanted to know. I fhall leave a letter with this ' laft gentleman, to be delivered to you, when you get here. His name ' is Ducket ; you will find him a very fenfible and friendly man. ' Soon after we got into the Lazaretto, I recolleded that our friend ' Baron had told me of an intimacy that fubfifted between him and a ' General G e of this place, and of his wanting an opportunity to fend ' him a cafk of Cyprus wine. Now, as 1 had laid in a ftock at Cyprus, I ' wrote a letter to the general, acquainting him with Mr. Baron 's inten- tions •, and as 1 was under great obligations to that young gentleman, I ' begged the general to give me an opportunity of anticipating his friend 's ' defign, by fending him a cafk from my own ftore, which I defired him tc to look upon as coming from Mr. Baron. The general returned me his thanks in the politeft terms, and very obligingly came to the Lazaretto to 3 .[ 399 pay us a viSt. He brought with him a Colonel , who is another omcer in the fervice of this republic. By this means I have made a very « good acquaintance with the general and the colonel. I Ihall take care to ts make them acquainted with your name, and dare fay you will pafs your ' time here very agreeable, as you'll be lure to meet with feveral EvrM ^ ladies and gentlemen. ' .We have loft no time in preparing every thing for our journey. I fhall ' leave you a copy of the route we intend to take. We have been oblicrecL ' to buy two carriages, but as you will not go poft, perhaps you will not r ' ' be under that neceffity. Mr. Ducket is the beft able to inform you of: &lt;c that, and every thing elie you want to know. ' Earewel, my dear Ned, and believe me unalterably. Your affeflionate and faithful friend, Henry DorDGE. ,r P. S. ' I had almoft forgotten to advife you upon your arrival here, ro ' enquire for Seignior Sehaftian Battagio, who will procure you the lodgings 44 we are now in, and if you want ca(h, will fupply you with any fum,' ,, The conful favoured us this morning with a very polite letter, touching Januarys, our difappointment of the five days grace. He faid, he had fet forth our hardfhip in the ftrongeft terms to Sir Horace Man, the refident at Florence. We returned the conlul our belt acknowledgments in a joint letter. \ Sunday, January 7; Mr. AJkew was with us, and confirmed the account of the conful's carry ing his complaint to Florence, and of his having particularly mentioned the taking out of the ; birds which came from Cyprus in our veflel for the ufe of the governor, at the end of 20- days.—An opera is to be performed this night. The following lines are cut on one of the window-fliutters of our room, which I here inlert not for the goodnels of the poetry, but becaufe they fenfibly ftruck- me, as exadly correfponding with my own melancholy^ fituation.

In the afternoon, the captain of the Lazaretto fent in his compliments, defiring the favour to fpeak with on which we began to affume new hopes of the five days grace being ^ranted. But it turned out nothing more, than delivering a compliment from the governor, who had come to the Lazaretto in the morning, intend ing to tell us in perfon how forry he was that the five days grace could not be allowed us, though he had ufed his utmoft endeavours with the govern ment at Florence for that purpofe. As we were engaged with the conful and his lady at the time the governor came, he would not come in, but went away, defiring that his compliments might be made to us. Sir Horace Man alfo wrote, that his folicitations in our affair had been unfuccefs- ful. This evening we were vifited by the phyfician of the place, who, with great folemnity, pronounced that we were uninfefied. We breakfafted with the captain of the Lazaretto, and immediately after wards, in a tranfport of joy, left the place of our long confinement. The firfl: perfons we paid our refpects to, were our particular friends MefTrs. Becher and AJkew. The latter was fo obliging as to attend us in the vifits we made the fame morning to the Englijh conful, to the go vernor, and to Mr. and Mrs. Levet. After thefe were over, we walked round the mole and arfenal, dined with Mr. Becher'% family, and in the evening went to the opera. The theatre here is fmall, but seat; it will hold about 700 people, and is the property of private perfons, who let .the boxes out to hire for the feafon. But exclufive of the feat, you pay for the performance alfo; and this, by perfons of falhion, is either done by the quarter, or more commonly by the whole feafon. People. in the pit pay three polls (about eighteen pence) for each night, and three or four fcratches more to the owner of the feat. The manager receives the whole .money, and out of it defravs all expences, contrading with each ador and niufician» [ 40i ] amifician for the feafon. The band confifts of 25 hands, among whom -are fome of the beft performers in Italy. The opera-dreffes are made up -in a good tafte, and very droll. The governor, conful, and Mr. Levet, returned our vifits. As foon as they were gone, we went to take a view of Donatella's famous ftatue of the grand duke in marble, and the four 'Turkijh flaves in bronze, which is a piece of exquilite workmanfhip. The grand duke is Handing on a pe- deftal, with the father and his three fons fo chained, that at its four corners from the proper point of view, all their faces are at once beheld. The bagnio likewife is a very noble fight, and well deferving a traveller's attention. We breakfafted with Mr. Hutchinfon, who afterwards, with Mr. Levet^ January 18. walked round the walls of the garrifon with us. It is a neat, compact fortifi cation, with a wet ditch, redoubts, glacis, &amp;c.: from the walls, we had a moft ■beautiful knd and fea profpeft. We were afterwards conduced to feveral ■handfome churches. One belonged to the Greeks of the Roman perfuafion, and another to the Armenians. We faw a pretty collection of paintings at Mr. Hutchinforis : Among others, were fome very ftriking likeneffes of the •gentlemen ot the fadory, done by our countryman Mr. Dance^ who bids iair to be at the top of his profellion. At this gentleman's lodgings, we heard the famous Seignior Giardini play upon the violin •, he was a pupil of Carton?s, and is looked upon as the firft fiddle now in Italy. In our walk this morning, I could not but take particular notice of a January if. great number of horfes, which were led about drefled with ribbons and other ornaments. Upon my enquiring into the reafon of this piece of pageantry, a French gentleman who came with us from Cyprus^ and now happened to be upon the parade, (hook his head, and faid, he was afliamed to inform me, but the fa6t was, that the too credulous people, conformable to an an nual cuftom, were leading thofe creatures to a certain church, in order to their being blejfed^ which was done by the prayers and laying on of hands of a prieft, who for his good offices received a pecuniary fatisfadion ; and with out this benedidion, the owners never exped any good fervices from their cattle for the enfuing year. This day Meflfrs. Becher, AJkew, Levet^ Hut chinfon. Dance, and Dr. Gar- January 2®; den (uncle to our good friend at Baghdad, and whom I made very happy in my account of his nephew) gave Mr. Gregory and me the pleafure of their company at dinner. Many gentlemen and ladies of the fadory, and our whole party dined January au with the governor to day. He is called Seignior Bourbon, Marquis de Monte, His falary is 1000/. per annum, exclufive of his houfe, firing, wines, and F f f many I 759*[ 402 ] many other articles, which arc provided for him gratis. He has likewife an annual prefent from the Jews, who carry on a great trade here. Cap. tains of (hips alfo, and their owners, are not unmindful of paying kirn tri bute. He prefides over the inquifition and other courts v and has an un limited power to reprieve or pardon. Leghorn is fituated on what they call an ifland r made fo by an artificial canal which runs round the walls, and at length communicates with the river Arno. There are faid to be 50,000 inhabitants in this place, of whom they reckon 14,000 are Jews: thefe live in a part of the town by them- felves. Some ot them are rich, and keep their carriages; but what is very remarkable, they are never fuffered to be driven by a coachman fitting on a box,' but by a poftilion only. The trade of Leghorn is ftill very great, though of late years it has been much leflened by GenM^ Civita Vecchia y Ancona^ and Naples, being declared free-ports. * January 23. At nine this morning, a letter was put into my hands from a friend in England* dated the 28 th of December laft, bringing the moft melancholy tidings ot the death of my dear and only furviving parent, whofe face above all things I once more defired to fee. The good natured reader will eafily conceive what 1 thought, and felt, on this afflicting occafion, and fpare me the trouble of defcribing it. During the whole time I had been feparated from her, I had formed to myfelf the exquifite lenfation of comforting her in the decline of life, and had often fighed out in the ardour of my heartj and in the fpirit of poetry, and of Pope y &lt;c Me let the tender office long engage ' To rock the cradle of repofrng age I ' With lenient arts extend a mother's breath, ' Make languor fmile, and fmooth the bed of death t Explore the thought, explain the alking eye, w And keep awhile one parent from the fky !'* But heaven thought not proper to indulge me in this perhaps my too jfamonate requen: j and to its decrees, how rigorous foever, I am taught to J759- In the evening we took leave of all thofe whofe flation, friendfhip, or ac quaintance made it neceffary. being then under time prove very Atf 403 ] At ten o'clock this morning, Mefirs. Gregory, Baiky, and myfelf, with our fervants, in three poft chaifes left Leghorn for Pifa, accompanied &lt;-4^ by our obliging friends Meflrs. Becher and Hutchinfon. The road between J anuar &gt; r H- thefe two places runs partly through a very pleafant wood, and partly through the moft delightful valley that poffibly can be conceived. The profped: to our right, was that of an unbounded plain ; while that'to our left, was terminated by the Apennine mountains, many of whofe tops were covered with fnow. * After we had left the wood, we entred upon thcr plain, and got to Pifa^ by dinner-time. Leghorn has almoft depopulated the city of Pifa, which if compared with P ha. its former flourifhing ftate, may be now truly faid, to be without inhabi tants. We did not omit to vifit the much talked of leaning or hang ing tower, whofe inclination has been at length determined by judi cious artifts, to be entirely owing to the foundation^ giving way. This tower ferves as a belfry to the cathedral, and ftands but at a little diftance from it. The cathedral is a large, noble, gothic pile of building, and its baptiftry or dome, and three brazen doors done by John of Bologna^ can never be fufficiently admired. St. Stephen's hofpital, and the beggar's church, are likewife worth feeing. We dined at a public houfe here 5 and at three o'clock parted with our two friends Meflrs. Becher ixA Hutchinfon, who returned to Leghorn, while we went on t for Lucca \ where we arrived juft before the (hutting of the L vcca&gt; gates, having travelled over the fineft vale, and t|ie beft: cultivated fields and vineyards, that imagination itfelf can poflibly conceive. Lucca is a well built city, and though the ftreets are narrow, they are well paved. Its fituation is delightful. We left Lucca at half paft feven, for Borgiana, which is a journey of two January it. pofts. We got to it at half paft nine, having ftill the fame delightful Borgian/. country to pafs over, diverfified by many a pleafant villa and little town. Among the laft were Manze and Lontina on our left, and Saint Mariana* Cote K to our right, Borgiana is a neat country town; we took horfes there for Pijioria or P istoria. Pizoria, and reached it about one in the afternoon. This is a walled city, and famous for the battle fought near it, between Anthony and Catiline, in * Horrebat glacie faxa inter lubrica fummo Piniferum ccelo mifcens caput Apeninus: Condiderat nix alta trabes, &amp; vertice celfo Canus apex ftrifta furgebat 3d aftra pruina.

The people of the country through which we travelled to-day look gay, and there appears a certain air of chearfulnefs and content in all their countenances. The women are handfome, and at the fame time induftrious: we faw none of them but were bufily employed, either in the work of the fields, or fpin- ning and knitting in their houfes.. We arrived at Florence about half paft feven in the evening. We made it our firft bufinefs this morning to wait upon Sir Horace Man the Britijh envoy, who received us very politely. We afterwards vifited the great duke's palace of Pitti. It confifts of a body, and two wings, built of Hone, with Tufcan pillars and ruftic work. The wings contain chiefly bed chambers, but the rooms in the center are filled with a variety of paintings,. &amp;«. done by the moft celebrated matters. I lhall only mention thofe that ftruck me moft fenfibly. Antiochus and Stratonice, by Pieiro de Cartona. f Four large pi&lt;5lures, reprefenting death, purgatory, judgment, heaven and hell, by the Chevalier Nafcini of Sienna, A Judith, with Holifernes*s head in her handi. The Saviour of the world, by Marroche, A Mars going to war, by Rubens. The three Deftinies, holding, fpinning, and cutting the thread of life,, by Michael Angela. A Cleopatra in Affliflion, by Guide.

The rape of the Sylvan nymphs by Satyrs ; by Rubens, Two pictures by Salvator Rofa. One of them reprefents a Sea-port-' crowded with fhips and gallies. The other is alio on a marine fubjeft. A portrait of Cardinal Bentivoglio, by Vandyke. A fine pidlure of St. Francis. He is reprelented to be in a dark room, with a ray of light ftriking upon his hands and face. This circumftance- has a wonderful effedt. * Reliquos Catilina per montes afperos, magnis itineribus, in agrum PiftOrienfetn ab* ducit.

A Luther, Calvin, and Calvin's wife; this laft is reprefented as a beau tiful nun, with golden difhevelled hair, on whom Calvin is made to look- very wifhfully.—This picture was done by Girgonu But the moil valuable piece in the whole palace, is the incomparable Madona de la Segiola, or the Virgin Mary in a chair, with Jefus in her arms. This is a fmall pidure, but is efteemed by connoifleurs to be the beft in the whole world ; it was painted by Raphael. Forty thoufand dollars, fome fay fequins, have been offered for it; but if they were dollars only r this pidure mull be worth about nine thoufand pounds fterling. There are alfo in this palace many pieces of exquifite worknaanfhip in the other arts. Such in particular are four beautiful Alto Reliefs in ivory. The firft reprefents the Rape of Venus by Mars. The fubje£l of the fecond is the well-known ftory of Bacchus and Ariadne. *The fable of Ceres looking after her daughter, is reprefented in the third. And in the fourth, Silenus? is depictured as fitting drunk upon his afs. -f Here are alfo four pieces of admired workmanfliip in bronze, done by Faguri. Their fubjeds are, our Saviour at the well with the Samaritan woman ; the- Prodigal Son returned to his father; the appearance of God unto Mofes in the burning bufh ; and another piece of Scripture-hiftory which I have now forgotten. Thefe, and a thoufand other things, perhaps (till more curious, are to be found in the palace of Pittk. We had the honour of a vifit to-day from the Earl of Northampton, and another from Sir Horace Man. At night we went to the opera, where we were furprized to find the performers in every refped greatly inferior to thofe at Leghorn, In the morning wevifited the Northampton •, and afterwards went to fee the old palace, which is juftly efleemed the greateft reppfitory in the * For this fable of CVm, vide O vid.

On the floor of the gallery, on one fide, are placed bufts or ftatues of all the Emperors of Rome, (landing on marble pedeftals; and oppofite to them are their Emprefles or wives. The feries begins with Julius Cafar in bronze, and ends with Conjiantme in marble. They all deferve to be taken notice of, either as fingular in their kind, or admirable for the excellence of their fculpture. In the fame gallery, is a Roman Cenfor in his robes.

A drunken Bacchus, with a cup in his hand, done by Michael Angeh, This is the only finifhed piece of his in the whole gallery; and here he «xerted all his powers, to convince the world that the abilities of men in his age, fell not fhort of thofe of the ancients. We were defired to obferve, that one of the arms of this ftatue was joined by a cement to the trunk •, and were told, that Angelo himfelf had purpofely broken it off, as foon as he had finilhed his work, and after fecretly burying the remaining part of the ftatue under ground, where he fuffered it to lie for fome time, he then caufed it to be dug up as though by accident, and fent it to the pope's court, where it met with univerfal admiration, as a moft finifhed piece of antiquity. Angelo was foon afterwards fent for to Rome, to partake of the general fatisfaftion which this new difcovery had created, and after he had iuffici- ently diverted himfelf with the ignorance of thefe pretended antiquarians, he at length thought fit to clear up the whole affair, by producing the arm.

The reafon affigned, is Brutus s crime m murdering his friend and benefaftor Julius C^cfar- but the true reafon why this, and the feveral other ftatues by Michael Angela were not finiflied, probably was, becaufe he was called ott trom time to time by his matters, the popes, who fet him about other performances. The laft ftatue I fhall take notice of in this gallery is a very fine one Bernini s miftrefs, done by himfelf; in which he has been fo exact as to (hew a fmall Icar in her face, occafioned by a fcratch he o-ave her at a game of romps. Two magnificent marble pillars ftand at the E end or the gal.sry, on which feveral Roman arms and implements of war are cunoufly wrought. At our return to our lodgings, we had the plealure to find Mr. Tottinr- ham there, who was juft arrived frora Leghorn, This morning we made a fecond vifit to the old palace, and were fhewn Tannary ^2 the feveral chambers of curiofities, ^ that ftand on the fide of it. The firft chamber, which is about forty teet fquare, and of a good height, has its walls decorated with portraits ot the great mafters in painting, each of whom drew his own picture, and lent it to this coiledion. The fecond, is almoft full of fine old china, and has a large touchftone table, cu- noufly inlaid with oriental ftones of different kinds and colours. The third is made up of different relicks of antiquity, dug out of the ruins of Rome. In the fourth, you are Ihewn a corona muralis, and a corona radial is with only eight fpikes. Mr. Addifon very juftly obferves, that the ulual number was twelve, and quotes the following lines from Virgil to prove it: ^ ingenti mole Latin us T.CarJU'' 1 Quadrijugo vehitur curru ; cui tempora circum Aurati bis fex radii fulgentia cingunt. Here alfo I had the pleafure of feeing an ancient Egyptian Siftrum *— This, and the two foregoing articles are of brafs. The fifth chamber, is an octagon; where I could not but take particular notice of two youno- Morpheus'$ in white marble, as it ferves to invalidate an obfervation of Mn Addifon s, who feems to intimate that the God of deep was never reprefented ' Regina in mediis patrio vocat Agmina Siilro.

Here was alfo the ■' famous ftatue of the Roman flave, liftning, and whetting his knife, which is held in high eftimation. dpollo and five other deities in bronze, by John of Bologna. A Venus in porphyry. A large fawn in marble. Another fine marble ftatue of what is called the ' two wreftlers.' An Hermaphrodite lying afleep on its fide, but in fuch a manner as to partly difcover the male parts. The large breafts and hips declare aHb its feminine participation.—This ftatue was made after that celebrated one in the Villa Borghefe. A Priapus \ four feet in length, and three feet one inch in circumference. Around this ftrange and obfcene figure, the twelve conftellations are reprefented. A Roman conful fitting.—This is the ftatue taken notice of by Mr. Addifon, as having the large ring upon his- finger-, which, he tells you, i^minded him of Juvenal's expreflion. ' majoris pondera gemmas.' A Jupiter tonans. A buft of Euripides, the famous Greek tragic poet; Three marble bufts of Homer, found in Leghorn road. A fatyr, by Michael Angela, not quite finifhed. Three pretty babes afleep, and refting their heads upon one another. Over the door is a moft excellent buft of Oliver Cromwell, in plaifterof.' Paris ; from , which many copies have- been taken. Another very remarkable ftatue in this collection, is the juftly celebrated Venus of Me diets, fo called from its being in the pofleflion of that family, of whofe incomparable beauty of lhape, air, and pofture, fo much has been laid by all travellers. She is here ftiled ' Venus Viftrix' to diftingui(h» her from two other Venus's which ftand near her. One of thefe is called i ' Venus marina' the, other 'Venus ccelejiis j' and both have a covering round the waift: the firft is quite naked* In this room you are alfo ihewn a great, variety of excellent paintings: fuch as John the Baptijl, by Raphael ; he has a tyger's fkin about the waift, and is fuppofed to be in the wildernefs *, he is painted very young, not more than fixteen or feventeen years of age.—Lord Southwell* and Martin, Luther, by Holbein. Two much admired paintings by 'Titian. One of them is a portrait of his own wife, whom he has drawn at full length, lying on a bfed, and naked as fhe came into the world.. The other^ is of'a moft beautiful girl,, a favourite miftrefs of a great duke, who is alfo painted quite naked.. The portrait of !Titian's wife feems to be alive, and is as finiflied a piece of the painter's art, as the Venus of Medicis is of the fculptor's.—Many copies both » ' ©fr■HUHHHI [ 4'i ] of the ftatue and picture are to be feen in private families, elpecially in thofe apartments where company is generally entertained. Three excellent night-pieces by Schalkin : and a fourth by Francis Douven a Palatine. —A nurfe teaching a child to read by candle-light, a friar ftands behind them, warming his hands at the fire: the light of the fire ftriking upon the perlbn of the friar, is admirably well executed, as is alfo that of the candle on the nurfe and child. The laft curiofity that was fhewn us in this odagon room, was Cardinal Leopold's cabinet of female beauties in miniature, done by the beft painters of the age he lived in. The cabinet has fixty drawers, with feven hundred pictures in each, all fet in filver. There are three or four other large chambers which are adorned with cabinets, tables and other pieces, inlaid with ebony, ivory, wax, lapis lazuli, amber, agate, and precious ftones, but as all voyage writers and authors of travels are full of thefe, I (hall pafs them by, taking notice only of four or five paintings which are exquifitely fine. John Baptiji's head in a charger, by Caracci, Mars and Venus, by Ruhens. Charles the fifth, emperor of Germany, and an Italian lady, by Vandyke. Adam apd Eve, by Albert Durer. Over the door of one of thefe chambers, are the portraits of the great Duke of Marlborough, Prince Rupert, and Lord OJfory, done by our country man Sir Peter Lilly. In the afternoon we went to the baptiflry, which is an oftagon, and was once a temple dedicated to the god Mars. It has three brafs gates one of them was the work of Ghiherti, a Florentine, with many fcripture ftories in Bajfo Relievo. The famous Michael Angelo, was fo ftruck with its beau ties, that he pronounced it worthy of being one of the gates of Heaven. The other two are alfo very handfome, but greatly inferior to the former.—We then drove to the Doma church, which is a large Gothic cathedral. The Rotunda vi the firft of its kind, and fo much Michael Angelo, that he in part took from it the model of St. Peter's at Rome. In this church, a Johannes Acutus (as he is called) is painted in Frefco, on horfe- back. He was an Englijhman in the Florentine fervice, and behaved very bravely. His proper name according to fome was Hacluit, by others. Sharp, which the Italians rendered into Latin by the word Acutus. We next vifited the Annunciata, a very neat church, with a gilded roof, and many fine paintings. The Madona del Sacca here is much admired. We then repaired to St. Croce, a Gothic pile of building; the moft remark able things in it, are two fuperb monuments, one of them was erefled to , ■ G g g 2 the i759 ;[ 412 ] 1759- the memory of Michael Angela, and has three ornamental ftatues about it, ' done by three of his fcholars, reprefenting painting, fculpture, and archi- tefture. The other is oppofite to it, and was defigned for Galiko the famous geometrician and philofopher. Ta^ar/zo We went this ^ the famous chapel of St. Laurence, which was 9 ' begun an hundred and fifty years ago, and yet remains unfinifhed; nor is it probable that it ever will be compleated. This is the burial-place of the great dukes of the family of Medicis. Adjoining, is a prodigious large octagon building, with an high dome, which is looked upon as the greateft defign now in the world. Each fide of the odagon has a moft magnifi cent tomb or monument, with pilafters of the Corinthian and compofite orders, and ornamented in the moft elegant manner with the arms of the family, curioufly wrought in a great variety of marbles; whofe fine colours, exquifite poliftungs, and nice difpofitions, intermixed with oriental ftones and ores, would make one fulped the whole to be the work of fome great mafter in painting. This building is finifhed from the ground to the upper part of the odagon, and beginning of the dome; the fcaf- folding is ftill {landing, but no workmen have been employed for thirteen years. . - A e were then fhewn the library, fo much celebrated for its large and valuabje collection of manufcripts, in the Greek, Latin, and other dead languages. There is one of Virgil, written in the fourth century i in the whole, there are at leaft three thoufand volumes all written on vellum, and in the moft elegant charaders. Our party had this day the honour of dining with Sir Horace Man ; and were fo fortunate as to meet there, the Earl of Northampton, and his gover nor, with Mr. Anderfon, Mr. Wyte, and Mr. Henry, all Englijh gentlemen on their travels.—Our converfation turned chiefly on the glorious and un interrupted feries of fuccefs, which had lately attended the Britijh arms in ail parts of the world. A theme of this kind could not fail of affording a peculiar fatisfaftico to a company of Englijhmen, thus accidentally met together in a foreign land but more particularly to me, who after fo long and painful an ablence, was once more going to be made happy in a fight ot my native country, and at a time too when her reputation was about to be railed higher, than ever before, in the annals of Great-Britain. January jo. Mr. Nottingham being obliged to fet out from hence this day on his return to England, I refolved to accompany him ; and about eleven o'clock in the morning, (having previoufly taken leave of all our countrymen in general, and of our friends Meflrs. Gregory and Bayley in particular) we lett Florence, and after a very troublefome and dangerous journey of two days over the Apennine mountains, we arrived at the D gates of Bologna.

The city of Bologna, for extent, and the number of inhabitants, and the B ologna, importance of its trade, is the principal next to Rome, in ail the ecclefi- aftical flate. It abounds in magnificent buildings, and is likewife famous for^ the numerous colle&amp;ion of excellent paintings, mailer pieces of art, which are to be feen in it; but the emotions which were then felt by my companion and me for fpeedily getting home, were fo powerful, that we were obliged to deny ourfelves the fatisfadion and pleafure of feaftin^ our eyes with them. The Bolognefe women of fafhion wear a veil or mantle of black filk over their heads and flioulders, which comes down before as low as their waift. 1 hey make ufe alio of a black filk apron, a petticoat of the fame colour, and a jacket of cloth, with open fleeves, which are turned back on the arm, and laced. They wear no caps, their hair is braided, and being circularly placed on the crown of the head, is faftened with long needles or pins ftudded with gold. But the moll prevailing fafhion among them is the wearing gold ear-rings j and in the winter months they never fail to preferve their hands from the cold by a little muff. The country girls are not lb fair here, or fo prettily featured as thofe of Tufcany, though their drefs appeared to be much the fame. They have a bodice, and over it a fbort jacket either of coarfe fluff ot cloth. A white handkerchief covers the breads, and another is pinned clofe on the top of the head, and loofely under the chin. Some of them wear fhoes, others none; the few that do have a pair of red or green worfted ftockings, and one and all ape their fuperiors in wearing either gold or brafs ear-rings. To their honour how ever be it fpoken, the fame fpirit of induftry prevails among thefe, as does among the pretty female peafants in Tufcany. We left Bologna at half pad feven this morning, and went on through February i, Pevia, which is a handfome country town, with houfes built on Wooden pillars or arches. The roads hereabouts are very bad for travellers, running through a fat and dirty foil. The country however is very pleafant, culti vated to the beft advantage, and extremely well laid out in vineyards. The vines here, as in Tufcany, are fupported from tree to tree *, and both the ftandards and vines are nicely trimmed, and uniformly planted, for many miles together. * —— adulta vitium propagiac Altas maritat populos. mm H orat .

An iron ring or two loofly hung to a pillar of the fame metal, which ftands on the pole between each yoke, ferves all the purpofes of bells i for thefe rings, by the motion of the car riage, are made to fall on and off the pillars, whereby a found, fomewhat refembling that of a bell, is happily produced. At a quarter paft three in the afternoon, we arrived at St. Carlo, having gone over an ugly, long caufeway, by the fide of the little Rhine *, which river lofes itfelf in a marfh near St. Carlo. The edges of the marfh are full of willow-trees and (hrubs, and according to the belt intelligence we could pick up, thefe fwamps continue quite to the fea, by Ravenna. The banks of this river are every where pleafantly fhaded with the willow, and other trees •, but fo narrow, that we were feveral times apprehenfive of falling into the river. At half after five we reached the gates of Ferrara: a city but poorly walled, and at prefent in almoft a defencelefs ftate. The ramparts indeed are fo extenfive, that even in its beft eftate, it muft have required a whole army to defend it. The ftreets are regular, and the houfes fo handfome, that they may with great propriety be ftiled palaces, being built of marble, and in an elegant tafte. The convents and churches are alfo very mag nificent. We were obliged to put up at the poft-houfe, where we had the word attendance in the world, but were made to pay mod extravagantly for every thing we called for. The fervants here, and in almoft every other public houfe between this and Pija, are down-right thieves; we have been pillaged by them already no lefs than four times, though we always endea voured to keep a good look out. At a quarter paft feven this morning,, we left Ferrara, and prefently after, the horfes that drew my chaife (which was built on purpofe for me at Leghorn, ftrong and well fitted for the Italian and German roads) fell down in a boggy road, and in my endeavouring to get clear of the carriage and (lough, i had the misfortune to fprain my back. A full hour pafled away P onte de la before the horfes and chaife could be gotten out again.—We afterwards went by a town, called Pontede laScuro. The famous river Pi?, or Eridanus, runs by it, and is here about half a mile broad f. I obferved -Parvique Bononia Rheni.

Virgil in his Georgic, ftilcs k ' Fluviorum Rex Eridanus and in his fourth, he fpeaks thus of its importance: ' Eridanus, quo non alius per pinguia culta In mare purpureum violentior afiluit amnis.'

We often • , . iaw three, four, and five in a row together. They are worked by the ftream of the Po which here runs at the rate of four miles an hour, and is navigable from Ponte de la ccuro quite to Ven We travelled feveral miles to-day on us high artificial banks, which on both fides of the river are railed twenty or thirty feet above the level of the country, and were in- tended to be broad enough for two carriages to pafs each other. At ten o clock we crofled a branch of the Po in a ferry-boat, and in about two hours after, arrived at another branch'of it called Canale Bianco. over which we pafled alfo in the fame manner. About two miles on the other fide of this river, the ecclefiaftical territories end, and thofe of the Venetian ftate begin. At five we arrived at Rouvtgo, having travelled only Rowxco. twenty-five miles the whole day, owing to the deep and fwampy roads we w J sn ''. through. We here met with, a clean houfe, and a very neat and obliging hoftefs. . , We XthRonvigo a little before feven in the morning, and were obliged February % to make ufe 01 four horfes to each chaife, and likewife to pay for a poll ex traordinary, on account of the common road being at prefent overflown, tor feveral miles we met with a great deal of trouble, being obliged fre quently to get out of our carriages r to prevent our being fafl: in the mire. At eight we reached a ferry on the river Adige^ which is navigable up to Verona f ; and by ten had almoft got clear of the overflown, marfliy coun try, which had occafioned us fo much fatigue. In going through one of the grape plantations, I obferved an image of the Virgin Alary fixed in a box, and nailed to one of the trees that fupported the vines. She is looked upon it feems as the proteftrefs of vineyards, and is therefore always honoured with a falute by every devout Roman Catholic. traveller..

At eleven we paffed over the little river-CW##, by the help of a wooden &gt;—v~&gt; bridge, built on piles-, and in a quarter of an hour after, we reached pifancrvitlage. pij ano ^ having but fix miles to Montfslice. A little before one o'clock we reached Montfelice, which is fituated at the foot of a moumin, has an old wall, a gateway, and a worn-out wooden gate. On the top of the moun tain, an ancient fort once ftood, but it is now converted into a church. Oppofite to this there is another hill ftill higher, called Monte Rocca, which has a convent upon it. Great part, of the road between Montfelice and Padua runs along a nar row, artificial caufeway, and fo nigh to the river Brent or Brenta, that we chofe rather to quit our carriages, and walk feveral miles on foot, than run the rifk of being overturned in fo dangerous a place. As we drew near to Padua, we met a great number of country-people returning from the market ot that city. We obferved that their oxen were drefled out with ribbons, bells, &amp;c.—They had alfo ftieep, hogs, and poultry in great abundance with them. The Venetian country women wear their hair plaited, and in general have nothing upon their heads but a ftraw-har, with the edge turned a little up : with this hat they falute after the manner of men.

We reached Padua before tbe gates were fhut^and entring the city at that part of it called the Holy Crofs, paffed by the church of St. JuJtina, which at a diflance makes a moil noble appearance, but upon coming near, you prefently difcover that the original ftone-work has been patch ed with rough brick, which gives a fhocking deformity to the whole building. 1 his edifice is remarkable for having fix rotundas or cupolas, and is built in the form of a latin crofsit was defigned by Palladio, and is univerfally held in greac efteem as a mafter-piece of art. Like all other PopiJJj churches, it is adorned with a variety of pictures *, but the chief or nament of this kind, is the martyrdom of the faint, which was done by Paul Peronefe, and is hung up over the high altar. Padua, though a famous city and univerfity, is neither fo well built nor paved as that of Bologna. The houfes in general are old-fafhioned, and the ftones ufed in the pavements are much too large. 1 he walls alio are built of brick,, which gives then^an odd appearance. * This i« / fy-s, that in the town-hall of Padua^ liere (lands a ffone fuperfcribed, Lapu / ituperii.^ Any debtor that will f'wear himfdf nor worth fivf pounds, and is fet by the Montse- LICE.[ 4'7 1 This morning we hired a boat for two fequins and an half (about 25 (hil- 1759. lings) to carry us down the Brent to Venice.

' Venice (according to Mr. Addifori) has feveral particulars, which arc not to be found in other cities, and is therefore very entertaining to a traveller.. It looks, at a diftance, like a great town half floated by a deluge. There are canals every where crofling it, lb that one may go to moft houfes either by land or water. The ftreets are generally paved with brick or frceftone,. and always kept very clean, for there is no carriage, fo much as a chair that pafles through them. There is an innumerable multitude of bridges, all of a fingle arch, and many noble palaces. Their furniture is not commonly very rich, if we except the pidures, which are here in greater plenty than* in any other place in Europe, from the hands of the beft mailers of the Lombard ichool, as 'Titian, Paul Veronefe, and Tintoret.

We 1759- Monday, Bebruary 5,r 419 ] We were employed this morning in taking a view of the arfenal, which has a line drawn round it ot abouc three miles. Xhree thoufand artificers « and labourers in the feveral naval branches, are conftantly employed here. February 1 he cxpence to the ftate, upon this account, amounts to about fix thou fand ducats weekly. It is upon the whole, a neat and compad dock yard, the whole navy of the republic, confifting of twenty-four (hips of the fir ft rate, which carry eighty guns each, and twenty-five galeafles, being kept herein. They all lie under cover, are finilhed to the upper deck^ and we were told, that in the fpace of two years, they could be all fitted out, and fent to fea. The maft-yard, rope-walk, fail-lofts, fmith-fhops, founderies, and magazines of every kind are upon this fpot j and as far as we could obferve, every thing feemed to be ready at hand, and in exad order. We walked through that part of the arfenal where the fmall arms are laid, and faw the complete fuits of armour which the greateft captains belonging to the republic formerly wore. Thefe are hung up as precious relicks; and are held in great veneration by the prefcnt race of Venetians. We were afterwards fhewn the famous Bucentaur Galley^ which has two decks, and is truly a fine fight. It is decorated with a great variety of curious carved work, reprefenting the different feafons, the arts and fciences, juftice, charity, prudence, patience, and other virtues. The bare gilding of this vefTel coil 12000 ducats of gold, which in our money amount to near fix thouland pounds. The Bucentaur is kept merely for fhew, being feldom it ever ufed, but on the day of our Lord's Afcenfion, the anniver- fary of the Doge's marriage with the fea. After taking our leave of the arfenal, we went to fee the church belong ing to the bare-footed Carmelites^ which is a gay, handfome ftrudure, and has an altar-piece truly majcftic. This church was defigned by the fame artift who built that belonging to the Jefuits ; and what is very remarkable in a place fo confined as Venice, has a good and fpacious garden adjoining to it. One of the brethren who fhewed us the church, refufed to take the money we offered him for his trouble.—A very extraordinary circumftance this, and worthy to be noted ! We had the honour to dine this day with Lady Wentworth and her huf- band ; Mr. Murray, Mr. Bridges an Englijh gentleman on his travels, and Mr. Ducket fecretary to Mr. Murray, made up the reft of the company. We had before been favoured with complimentary cards from Lord Bru- denel fon of the earl of Cardigan, Mr. Conful Smith, MefTrs. Lyte, Frazier, Udney, and Seignior Sehajiian Battagio. This laft gentleman is the fame per- fon who was mentioned in my friend Mr. Doidg€ 9 s letter. He tendered his beft fervices, and told me, that he had received a private letter of recom mendation from Mr. Smith of Aleppo in favour of Mr. Dcidge and me, with credit for whatever cafli we might Hand in need of. This was the more H h h 2 kind[ 420 ] kind in Mr. Smith, as he had done it without giving us the leafl intimation of his friendly intentions. In the evening we went in mafques to the Ridotto, or public gaming- houfe, which is here eftablifhed by authority. In it are feveral apartments; and in each apartment gaming-tables, loaded with either gold or filver. At each bank fits a Venetian fenator unmafked, and arrayed in his fcarlet robes. To him the adventurer repairs, trys his fortune at the game of Bajfet, and very oftea, in a few minutes is totally ruined. There is fomething truly diabolical in thefe fcenes. The mafques are commonly dreffed in black j the rooms though large, are but dimly lighted; fome people you fee pen- fively fitting, others gravely ftalking along, or defperately gaming. And all the while fo profound a filence is kept, that fcarce a figh or whifp&amp;r is ever to be heard. I left this place with abhorrence, being fenfibly ftruck with the proftitution of magiftracy, the encouragement of. vice, and the. ruin of families! From hence we went to the Buffo*, or comic opera, and were drolly enter tained : then we adjourned to a grand Feftino or ball, given by a Venetian nobleman of the Veniero family, in his own palace, upon his being lately defied Procurator. This feltival continues three days and three nights. The magnificence and brilliancy of the prefent, is faid to equal any that has * ever preceded it. Every apartment in the palace, intended for the reception of company, is illuminated with a vaft number of wax-candles, placed in filver- branches, or glafs-girandoles, finely cut and has a band of mufick in it,, confiding of at leail twenty hands. Only the native nobility, and gentle men-foreigners of different nations who happen to be at Venice, are ever admitted to thefe feftivals ; for which purpofe a detachment of foldiers is placed at the entrance of each paflfage to the feveral apartments, to prevent any improper perfon from going in. All who pafs by the foldiers are obliged to unmaik, unlefs it be thofe who are accompanied by fome foreign minifter, or by one of his houfehold. This happened to be our cafe; Mr. Ducket having been fo obliging as to take us with him. He there fore, Of our whole company, was the only perfon who found it neceffary to^ unmafk, and acquaint the guard, that we were ' Englijh Gentlemen.' , In the feveral chambers of this palace, the greateft profufion of coftly jewels were difplayed by the noble Venetian ladies ; they were all drefled cither in black filks, or black velvet, except the lately eledted Procurator's wife, who upon this particular occaiion, is allowed to appear in colours, with the foreign princefles, the nieces or other near relations of the Pope, and the ladies of public minifters. Every woman's hair was ex tremely powdered, and drefled either in the French or Englijh tafte, and be- fides the abundance of coftly brilliants, rubies, &amp;c. with which every part of their drefs was ornamented, there was fcarce a finger upon either of their handshltll, or pltfu djj ;.. ^egameof^j ^cre is fonictl^;. monly drcffd me people foofej tie i® ! r 4 21 j' hands but what was loaded with rings of immenfe value. Dancin®- and' oardsmade up the pnncipal entertainment of the company, though many ot both iexes alfo feemed to be happily employed in chit-chat converfation. In fome o; the rooms', the feveral parties were regaled with tea, coffee, chocolate, fherbet, wines, &amp;c. •, and in other rooms, were tables covered^ with the niceft eold-meats of various forts, fuch as poultry, wild-fowl paf- ties, cuitards, fweet-meats, fyllabubs, fnow-balls, jellies, &amp;c. ' The Pope's Nuncio, the Engltjti refident, the French Embaflador, and the- reft of the foreign minifters and their families, and all the people of the firft' rank in Venice, were at this Feftino: and the whole was fo truly fplendid, fo politely, and fo regularly conduded, that I never went away'from any'en- teitainment o thoroughly delighted. It may not be improper to add, that the laws of Venice ftriftly forbid any of their nobility holding the leaft con verfation with the foreign minifters but upon thefe public occafions, or when national affairs are to be agitated between them. A deteftion of 31 breach of thefe laws, is fure to be punilhed with great rigour and fe- verity.. Mr. Murray the Engltjh refident, is a polite, well-bred, fenfible man; Mr. Conful Smith has behaved with great good-nature towards us, and Mr. 'Ducket has fully anfwered the very amiable character given of him by Mr. JDoidge. In a word, we have experienced zt Venice tvevy civility, which travelers could pofTibly wifh for. At Leghorn we got letters of credit and recommendation to the feveral places we were to pafs through in Italy and Germany, but Mr. Udney of this place has been fo obliging as to cnve us another on Mr. Aman of Augsburgh. Both the refident and conful advife us not to be afraid of pafting through Franckfort on the though it be now in poffeflion of the French. They Teem lorry that my friend Doidge and his party have taken another route from Augshurgh^ as hereby their expences and difficulties will be con- fiderably increafed. * By the advice of the fame gentlemen, we fupplied ourfelves with a pafs- port from the Aujirian Embafiador refiding here, as it was apprehended by them, that the French would pay but little regard to the one we had before gotten from the regency of Florence. This pafs-port from the Aujirian Embaflador, coft us four fequins, which was a great impofition in his fe- cretary, who was mean enough to declare to our iervants, that we Ihould not have it for lefs money, becaufe we were Englijhmen^ and confequentlyv * Mr. Doidge s party, intimidated by Franckfart 's being in pofleffion of the French, quitted their intended route, and pafled through Germany by way ot Nuremberg, Bamberg, Coberg? • hlunungen, CaJJel, Munjier, &amp;c. 3 wereFebruary 7' Padua.

We embarked about nine this morning for Padua, having previoully taken leave of all our friends at Venice. We got to Padua in nine hours, having hired a horle extraordinary to draw our boat, that we might arrive there before the gates were (hue. This morning early, while our carriages were getting ready, we paid a 'vifit to the church of Sc. Anthony, the titular faint of this city. It is a vvery large, and magnificent pile of building, but in the gothic tafte. The &lt;outfide of it has rather a heavy appearance; within, it is richly adorned with grand marble altar-pieces, branches of mafly filver, and many excel lent paintings. The church, which was once dedicated to the Virgin Mary, befides the tomb of Saint Anthony, has alio an abundance of other elegant marble monuments, and ieveral Alto Relievo's, expreflive of the miracles wrought by the faint; of David's playing and dancing before the ark *, of Solomon's temple, &amp;c. Here alfo the whole hilcory of Sampfon is to be i'een in brafs, Bajfo Relievo, finely executed. The pavement of the church is all of marble, of different colours, well polilhed and cubically formed. We left Padua about nine o'clock, and pafllng through the town of Meftrey, got to Sleftca by eleven. We crofled here the river tfefin, formerly the Ticinus *, by a imall bridge, and at one o'clock reached Vkenza. Vve found the ftreets of this city narrow, the houfes irregularly built, and in an old-fafhioned tafte. A very few indeed which are modern, have a handfome appearance. MONTE- ■ello. Verona, We took frefli horfes at Vicenza for Montebello, where we arrived at a quarter paft three o'clock, having had a good road all the way. At a quarter after five, we again changed our horfes at a place called Caldier, and fet out^ for the city of Verona, which we reached about fix in. the even ing. Silius hcdicus has given the following beautiful defcription of this river. '• Caeruleas Ticinus aquas et ftagna vadofa ' Perfpicuus fervat, turbari nelcia, fundo ; ** Ac nitkium viridi leme trahit amne liquorem ; •* Vix credas labi, ripis ramen mitis opacis '* Argutos inter (volucruni certamina) cantus ' Somniferam ducit lucenti gurgite lympham.' How ihall we be able to reconcile the above defcription of this river, with the account given us by Dr. Buraety Mr. Addi/on, and others of our modern travellers, who have all repre- iented it as running with an aftonifhing rapidity ?

We afterwards^ went to fee St. Bernard's chmch, and its beautiful rotunda chapel de-^ figned by the fame San Miccheli. Its pillars are of the finefl marble of the* Corinthian order, and held in the higheft eftimation. Some of them are fluted, others fpirally worked, and others beautifully cut into foliao-es. We next took a view o. a brick bridge of three arches, which is burit over the rivzxAdige. The firft of thefe arches meafures 142 Italian ^ at the bafe; the fecond 82, and the third 70. This bridge, and an oldcaftle that (lands- near it, were both built in the year 1354. The principal arch is reputed^ to be the wideft in the known world, that of the Riako at Venke makinsr only a fpan of 86 feet^ ■ We were then fhewn the ruins of the Area built by Vitruvlus, A D. 145. This (according to the accounts given us) was the entrance to the fepulchre of the Gavian family. We were afterwards led to the hofpitali di Mifericordia^ to fee a much admired piece of painting of a Saviour juft taken down from the crofs, done by Alexandrino Veronefe. The' bleffed virgin, wringing her hands, and in an agony of grief,, ftands look ing on the bloody corpfe, which is fupported by Nicodemus. Our Saviour is repieienced of a fhorter fiature in this pidlure, than in any other painting ever faw of him.—The laft piece of antiquity we took a view of at Verona^ was the famous Roman amphitheatre,- the infide of which is ftill complete, but the outfide-work has iuffered. ib much from time and wea ther, that a very- fmaii part of the old, original wall, is now remaining,- There are in all three walls, beginning from the flreet, and ending at the centre or area for the fports. Within thefe walls, are ftages of feats for four different ranks of people^ and fixty portals for their entrance, it being cuftomary among the RjMnans fov each order or tribe to go up by its owns refpedtive ftair-calK The Patricians fat on the firft row of feats from the area or field of combat, and the Plebeians on the higheft of all. There are forty-five of theie feats, ranged: circularly one above another, and will hold 22184 peribns. In the- feco»d wall from the ftreet, are feveral dif- tindt apartments for^ keeping, the wild beafts, and in the third, or inner wall,' are twenty eight prifons, . four of which are entirely dark. Here the • malefacftors were confined, who were fentenced to give diverfion to the Roman citizens, by combating the beafts. Little channels of water run^ quite through the building, and were undoubtedly defigned to carry off evtryv kind of filth to the.common-fhore,, At:t 4*4 3 I 759' 1 —' At ten o'clock in the morning we left Verona, having hired what are here called Vet urine horles for the city of Trent. At twelve we pafled over the ■rapid river Adige in a ferry-boat, whofe current runs at the rate of feven miles an hour*. The roads now begin to beftony and hilly: and that beau tiful country which has been fo diftinguifliable in our whole journey from Leghorn, is now putting on a different afpedl, though even here, the vines hang like fo many garlands, from tree to tree. We tailed fome excellent white wine this day at a little obfcure village, which was the more extra ordinary, as good wines are very fcarce all over Lombardy. Chufa pafs. j n ^ afternoon, we got to the remarkable pafs of Chufa, where the road was fo very fteep, narrow, and rocky, that we were obliged to get out of our carriages, the horfes not being able to draw them over it. At this pafs are always kept fome foldiers, whofe afllftance in dragging along the chaifes, our poftilions were obliged to purchafe at the expence of ten pauls. The charge of our four horfes, of the feveral turnpikes, and of getting through this pafs, amounted in the whole to eleven fequinsj five and a half of which we depofited before we left Verona, and agreed to pay the remainder on our arrival at Jj rent. At half paft fix o'clock, we pafled by the boundary ftone, which divides the Venetian (late from the bifhopric of 7' rent. At eight in the evening, we reached Borgetto, which is one of the many little towns feated on this road among the Alpine mountains. Here we got a clean room, and fome whole- fome food *, were well attended, and (what is ftill more extraordinary) our bill was very moderate. Borgetto. Borgetto lies about twenty miles from Verona-, and through the whole journey, a traveller's mind is very differently amufed and agitated. At one time, he is wonderfully ftruck, and pleafed with the grand and romantic fcenery that is every where about him. At another time, he is almoft chilled with horror at the fight of huge precipices of naked rocks hanging perpendicular over his head, and feeming ready to fall upon him. To this .may be added, the extreme narrownefs of the road, and the horrid Gulfi of fome hundred yards depth, all along on his left, at the bottom of which he dilcovers the river Adige running with great rapidity, between a double range of fharp pointed rocks. It muft not be underftood however, that fuch frightful ideas as thefe attend the traveller during the whole of this diftance; for fometimes the eye is entertained with a view of feveral ranges of mountains, covered with trees and pafturage, which form one of the mod irregular, and at the fame time one of the moft pleafine fcenes in the world. February 10, We left Borgetto at feven o'clock in the morning, and having paflcd through Aid at eleven, and Roverido at three (two confiderable port towns) • Claudian calls this river, ' Velox Athcfis.' - i weand tli [ 42s ] wc got at fix in the evening fafe to the city of Trent, The feveral poft towns we pafled through between Verona and this place were as follows.

It is fituated in a plea- Trent. fant plain, and the river Adige runs by it, over which is thrown a wooden bridge of eight arches. While our carriages were fitting at Trent with an additional pair of wheels, I took a coach and vifited St. Simon's tomb, who lies buried in a church dedicated to him. I faw the reputed faint's corpfe embalmed, lying on its back in a glafs cabinet, that is lodged within the tomb. The room in which the remains are depofited, is hung with pidures, badly painted, reprefenting the murder of the faint and his two fons*. In another church, which we afterwards vifited, we were fhewn a very handfome altar-piece of four fpiral marble pillars; the fquare they form is open at the top, and within it the altar is ere£ted. We were told, that this altar-piece is done in imitation of one in St. Peter\ at Rome, which is in high eftimation. We now repaired to a third church, much talked of in thele parts for the excellency of its organ. 1 he prieft, at the time we entered the church, was faying mafs; and yet by virtue of a ducat feafon- ably prefented to the organift, we were highly entertained by fome mirth- ful tunes which he did not fcruple to play at our requeft. The organ, is a very good one, and moft elegantly ornamented with five well finifhed, gilded, pilafters, which ftand projeding out of a handfome gallery, the front of which is embellilhed with fome marble figures in Bajfo Relievo* done by Vincent Vincenti.

He even advifed our returning back again to Leghorn, and taking our paflage from thence in fome fhip bound to England. In fpite however of every thing he alledged to the contrary, we refolved to purfue our plan, and agreeable thereto, this evening about five o'clock left Trent, in our way to Infpruck.

At Neumark we began to pay forty-five creutzers for each horfe (fixty make a florin) the fame price was continued all through the Queen of Hungary's dominions. On the other fide of the city of Trent, we took notice, that both the men and women's drefles were made in the Italian faftiion, but fince we left Trent, the German mode has taken place. The male peafants all make ufe of gallowfes to keep up their breeches, and the females wear a thick quilted worited cap upon their heads. They are alfo remarkably large and indelicate. W e flept laft night at Bolfang, (which for a Tirolefe town, is a very good one) and this morning iet out again on our way for Infpruck. In the road between Brixen and Mitlewald, we palled by an immenfe quantity of pine trees, many of which being felled, had impregnated the very air with their tarry fmell. During this poft too, we once more crofled the river Adige, by a large bridge.

We reached Infpruck about four o'clock in the morning ; where we had the February 13. plealure to reft ourfelves in a bed, for the firft timefince our leaving Infpruck is the capital city of Tirol, and received its name from the river Inn, which runs near it. It has a noble caftle or palace, formerly the I nspruck. place of refidence of the dukes of the houfe of Auftria, and a (lately cathedral where they were buried. The houfes, though built in the German tafte, are rather handfome, and the ftreets though narrow, are remarkably well paved. For the defence of this city, the inhabitants can place but little confidence in the ftrength of its fortifications, which are very trifling •, they feem rather to depend on the natural face and faftnefles of the couhtry 3 , which 1 indeed form a barrier fo perfedly inacceflible to any enemy, that even the great Guftavus Adolphus, after having over-run with his viftorious arms the other parts of Germany, could never make any impreffion upon this part of the empire. We had fcarcely alighted out of our chaifes here, before we were vifited by the governor of two young German noblemen, who propofed to us an exchange of carriages \ and the reafon he gave for it, was, that their own were not fo well fitted for the Italian roads, as were ours: we defired how- ever to be excufed from clofing with this gentleman's propofal.

[ 428 ] Between Infpmck and Dorftenhacb, we found the road tolerably good, although the adjacent Jlps were covered with fnow, and the path in moft places full of ice. We had fortunately taken care to have our horfes Ihoes well turned up and frofted, which prevented their flipping, and made us pafs over this otherwife troublefome road with little interruption. We had no great reafon to find fault with the roads between Dorftenhacb and Payervis j in both which places we obferved, that the women wore the fame frightful quilted cap, before noticed. Their petticoats were long before, but cut remarkably (hort behind. Their ftockings are very thickly quilted, which occafions the fmall part of their legs to appear monftroufly large and clumfy. Thefe ftockings reach no farther up than the calf of the leg; fo that whenever the women have occafion to ftoop forward, the naked thigh is almoft entirely expofed to the view of any perfon who happens to ftand behind them. We were obliged to wait at the obfcure village of Payervis, full two hours, for a relief of horfes; and arrived at Nazareth N azareth , village at eight o'clock in the evening. For the little time we flayed, we were agreeably entertained with a Tirolefe dance, by the young people of the place. At the opera at Venice we had a fpecimen of this country manner of dancing, whofe greateft peculiarity feems to confift in the noife made upon the floor with their wooden Ihoes. The figure is not much unlike that of our country dances in England. We might have had lodgings at the poft-houfe in Nazareth) but chofe to fet out for Heidervang *, where we arrived at three o'clock in the morning. We here found, that we were now gotten out of the 'Tirolefei and had entered Swahia. During this laft poft, our paffport was twice examined, (at Eren- hetg and Crinberg) two very narrow paffages between the mountains. We found it neceffary to give the corporal or ferjeant who was on guard, a little money to buy liquor for him and his party: and indeed we were obliged to do the fame at all places we pafled through in the night, other- wife the opening of the gates would have been attended with great lofs of time, and other difagreeable circumftances. Heidervang is a large village, and can accommodate a traveller with a good bed. The road from this place to Fuejfen, is a very good one, where we arrived about eight o'clock in the morning, having firft croffed over the F vessen . river Lecb^ which is here not very broad. Fuejfen is a large town; we ftaid till nine at the poft-office, and having refrefhed ourfelves, fet off for Sau- S aumrster, mejier, where we arrived at three quarters paft eleven, over a very bad road. This village is an infignificant one, and affords but indifferent accommoda- tions. The women here, and for feveral polls back, wear a long broad belt round their waifts, with a ftrap fufpended from it, which reaches almoft down to the ground, and to this they tye their keys, knives, fciflars, &amp;c. The quilted, woollen cap, which has hitherto given us fo much dif- tafte, begins now to be no longer in fafhion ; but a double one made of linen H eider vang.

After waiting there an hour and quarter for frefh horfes, we fet out for Dijfen, where we arrived at nine o'clock in the evening; and as the roads D isskm. were too bad for travelling any farther in the night, we put up at, the poft-houfe, and were accommodated with fome excellent veal-lbup, and tolerable good beds. The road from Dijfen to Hurlac, which was our firft ftage this morning, February i. is not bad i It lies partly over a plain or down, and partly through woods. We took frefh horfes atii/«r/^, and about four o'clock in the afternoon, got Hurlao , fafe to Augfburgh. Augjburgh is a very large and handfome city, the merropolis of Swahia, A ' u G 3i and fituated on that branch of the river Lech, which is called JVertach. BURGH * It is a bifhopric under the archbifliop of Mentx, and was made a free imperial city in the ninth century. It has more than once felt the fevere effefls of war-, but, like what is reported of the Phoenix, has as often rifen fairer out of its allies. The ftreets in general are wide and fpacious^ and one in particular is the broadeft and beft paved ftreet I ever faw. The houfes are built in the German fafhion; their fronts are fo narrow, that (they all appear like the gabel ends of buildings, and have fuch deep roofs, that two, three, four, and fometimes five ftories of dor mant windows are contained in them. The fronts of every houfe in the city belonging to people of fafhion, are painted. A great number of artificers are employed here, whofe curious workmanlhip in plate, ivory cabinets, watches, &amp;c. is every where admired. An univerfal liberty of confcience is allowed and the Proteftants and Papifts have an equal fhare in the government of the city. It is famous alfo for the Con- fejjion of faith drawn up by Melanchton and other Lutherans and prefented to the emperor Charles V. at a diet of the empire, hence called the Augfburgh'' confeflion ^ and for the Confederate Treaty againft the growing power of France: in 1683. Our firft ftep after our arrival, was to wait upon Mynheer Lihert, a Dutch merchant refiding here, to whom our letters of credit were addrefied. We afterwards paid our reipeds to Mynheer Aman, another Dutch gentleman, to whofe favours Mr, Udney of had been fo obliging as to recom mend us. From both thefe gentlemen, we had the fatisfadion to be* affured, that we had nothing difagreeable to apprehend from the French forces quartered at Franckfort 5 as the prince de Soubife, upon being applied to by a friend of his at Nuremberg to grant a paffport for Mr. Doidge and his party, had written word, (though his anfwer unfortunately did not arrive* till after Mr. Doidge had left the place) that it was quite unneefflary, feeing[ 43° ] -Donawert. they were fufficiently protedlcd from every infult by that which had already been given them by the Imperial embaflTador at Venice. We have often in our prefent journey experienced the good effedts of the unparalleled fuccefs attending the Briiijb arms this year in all parts of the world, having upon that account, been treated with the greatell deference and reiped in the feveral countries through which we had pafled.

We left Augjburgh a little before eight this morning, and did not get to Mittingen till eleven, having had a deep and heavy road to pafs over. The lands hereabouts are only in part cultivated, vaft forefts extending them- felves on every fide, more particularly to the eaftward. Indeed we have had forefts in our view, with very little interruption, ever fince we left the Alps. We reached Donawert * at half paft three in the afternoon, and fliould have taken frefh horfes for Nordlingen, and from thence to Dinkefpukel (which was our proper road) but our Swifs fervant contenting himfelf with barely telling the poft-mafter, that we were going to Franckforty orders were given by him to the poftilions to drive us to Vendete, which blunder was followed by great lofs ot time, and the unneceflary expence of a poft extraordinary. * A fortified town, and famous for two viaories gained in its neighbourhood by the great duke of Marlborough. The firft, was over the duke of Bavaria, who was intrenched niSchel- lenberg with fixteen thoufand French and Bavarians. The fecond was at Blenheim, where a French army of fixty thoufand men, under MarJhalTallard. was almoft entirely deftroyed. The3 [ 43' J The journey from Bonawcrt to Vendete, took us up five hours and half. 17/50. The hrlt part or the road was hard and ftony, the latter was deep, heavy, &gt;— and doughy, fo that we did not get to our inn till twelve o'clock at ^ rENDETfi - night. Between feven and eight this morning, we fet off for Hey ding, and reached February i 7 it ^bout ten. This is a large garrifon town, and in coming to it, we pafled HEyDIN0 ' over a river, which empties itfelf into the Danube. Without flopping iono- at Hey ding, we drove on for Binkefpukel, and arrived there in about four Dinkes- hours. This is a confiderable large town, and has a. garrifon- conftantly kept in it. The men of the lower clafs here, and in many other towns of Germany, wear a coat made of a coarfe green frieze cloth ; while thofe of the better- fort, make ufe of a fuperfine one of the fame colour, and line it with furs. The firft imitate the Butch in the cut of their clothes, the lafl: the French, On the feveral roads in Germany you are fure to find the imacre of a cruci fied Saviour nailed to a crofs, accompanied by the two thieves, cut out in wood as large as life; in the fame manner as you meet with a Virgin Mary in Italy, (luck up in a cafe with the infant Jefus in her arms. ^ We \th Dinkefpukel at a quarter after three in the afternoon, and got to K Kreiljheim in four hours. This is a large town, and has two walls round 7 he EIL ' it. _ We flept at the poft-office, but met with very indifferent accommo dations. At half paft feven this morning, we left Kreiljheim, in our way for February 18 Blaufelden, which we reached at one o'clock in the afternoon. The firft Blaufel- part of the road was good, the laft fcarcely paffable. The poft-mafter here D£N - was a very entertaining man, and gave us fome excellent Vine-rotii. Be tween feven and eight in the evening, we got to Mergantheim. Our being M ergan- fo long in travelling this poft, was owing to a great deal of fnow havinct theim. fallen laft night, and to-day : Mergantheim is a fortified town, and has always a good garrilbn. The country round it is in general cultivated, but in a very flovenly manner. We left our beds at one o'clock this morning, and fet off for Bickhajlen, Monday, where we did not arrive till after fix : the fpring of my carriage unfortunately February 19. broke, by which accident more than an hour was loft before it could be ±!ickhas - properly fecured with cords. As foon as we had changed our horfes at Bick- T£N ' hajien, we went on for Huntein, and reached it about a quarter after nine H untein. o'clock. The road we travelled over, was compofed of ftone and land, and in many places fo rugged, as to be very trying to our carriages. Durino- this poft, we faw two or three flocks of (heep, a fight altogether new to us fince we paffed the Alps. In our whole journey hitherto through Germany, we have not been able to procure the leaft morfel of mutton at any of the publicMilten- bovrg. O ffen- BOURQ.

The drefs of the women's heads hereabouts, differs from that of the Ita Jans and Tirolefi. Their caps are of another make, and they keep their mouths muffled in the fame manner, as the Armenian women do in Afta. The laft adopt this cuftom through modefty, but probably the reafon for the German females doing it at this time, is to defend their lips from the feventy of the weather. The feveral apartments of the houfes in Germany, are all made warm by clofe ftoves. The fire is never feen in the rooms, neither have they any chimnies in them, but this occafions the air to be difagre*. able and unwholefome. AVe got to Miltenhourg from Huntein a little after one o clock in the after noon ; from whence we let out for Offenbourg, and arrived there at a quarter after two. Offenbourg is feated on the fouth fide of the river Maine, a large, but old falhioned, ill-built town. The houfes, like thofe of the other places I have feen in Germany, have too great a quantity of timber in them ; fo much, that Ihould a fire at any time take place amongft them, the confequences mult be dreadful ! The country-houfes belonging to the nobility anti gentry in the neighbourhood, are large, and heavily built j they have generally domes, and four towers around them. At half after three o'clock in the afternoon, we left Offenbourg, and con tinued to travel on the left, or fouth fide of the Maine, whofe banks are here neatly cultivated, and formed into the fame kind of vineyards, before noticed, with flights of fteps, all faced with Hone, and theiefore in t £ fummer feafon, muft afford a very pleafing view from the river. On the lands adjacent, many flocks of Iheep are now feeding, and various forts of wild-fowl fwimming in the ftream. At half pafl five we reached Afchaffenbourg, a well -fortified town belonging to the eledor of Mayence or Mentz, who has a fpacious, but in elegant palace here. The place ftands partly on a hill, and partly in a bottom, and has a good ftone bridge of twelve arches built over the Maine. Fifteen hundred French troops were in garrifon, at the time of our arrival. We fell into converfation at the poft-office with an obliging, fenli- ble Abbe of that nation, who advifed us not to entertain a thought ot going farther than Dettingen for the night, as he was very confident that the gates of Hanau would not be opened for us until the morning. We kft 4f c ^' fenbourg at fix in the evening, and at eight reached the village of Vet- iingen. 3 ThisWSBBBBM t 433 J This once obfcure village was made famous by the vidbory gained here in 1759- the year 1743, by King George the fecond over the-Frmi? army commanded by Marfhal Noailles. The fellow, at whofe wretched cottage we lay, feemed, very fond of relating the feveral particulars of this engagement, and was efpecially folicitous to Ihew us a hole in one of the beams of his houfe, which, he faid, was made by a ball from the Britijh artillery. He dwelt particularly, and with an apparent pleafure, on the fpirited attack of the Englijh, and the confufion of the French, when they made their precipitate retreat over the Maine. My fellow-traveller Mr. Nottingham, and I, were obliged to put up with one bed in this miferable hovel; we lay with our clothes on, and our fervants llept in the fame room on ftraw. Thefe were the beft accommodations we could procure from our Dettingen hoft and yet, the money we paid the next morning (to the value of three ftiillings) did not fatisfy, the woman of the houfe telling us, that as we were Eng- liftmen, we ought to have depofited a fequin at lealt (near ten fhillings); and fhe infifted that her bed was the beft in the whole village, and that a great man, a German Baron, having lately flept in it, pronounced it to be a very good one. At fix o'clock this morning, we left the village of Dettingen, and at half February 20. paft feven reached Hanau, which is a well-fortified city, having a double wall, and two wet ditches. The French are at prefent in pofieflion of it, and maintain a large garrifon here. The ftreets are broad and well-paved, and the houfes large and handfome. The country around is well cultivated, and the town is fupplied with water from the Maine by artificial canals. On our entring the inner gate, we were conducted by the ferjeant ftationed there, to the French captain who commanded the main-guard. He looked at our pafsports, and civilly difmifled us. ' '&lt; &gt; &gt;•• • The women in general here wear a quilted linnen cap, which coming a long way down the fides of the face, even below the chin, is then turned back, and pinned over the fhoulders. They make ufe of a long cloak alfo, made of quilted linnen. The women of better fafhion appeared to drefs in the Englijh and French manner. At half paft ten o'clock, we arrived at Franckfort a free, imperial city, Franck- very large and populous ; and the place where the Emperors of Germany were fort. formerly always ele6led. It is well-fortified with a double ditch, baftions, redoubts, and ravelins. The ftreets are remarkably wide, and the houfes handfomely built. By means of the navigable river which runs through it, this city has great conveniency for carrying on an extenfive trade with the other parts of Germany, and the two fairs held here annually are very con- fiderable. The fuburbs are called Saxenhaufen, and are joined to the city by a ftone-bridge, built over the Maine, Our firft intention was to have proceeded immediately on, without making any ftay at Franckfort*, but Mr. Hope, who keeps a houfe of public entertainment there, per- K k k fuaded mil m. -•J? m :-4 I ■■ -tf M\February 2!« [ 434 ] fuaded us to put off our going till the next day, becaufe it would take np fome time to provide a proper boat, and to lay in fuch provifions as would be neceflary in our paflage down the Rhine. We begged alfo the favour of Mr. Hope to make an agreement for a boat, as the lum demanded of us, 130 florins, appeared to be very extravagant, for carrying us only as far as Cologne. Mr. Hope informed us, that although 15 ducats had been the cuf- tomary price, yet confidering the great change which had lately happened in the country by means of the French army, and the extraordinary expence which the boatmen were now at for horfes to draw their boats back, he did not think we fhould be much impofed upon, if we could fettle it at 18 or 19 ducats. We had no objedion to his fixing the matter on this foot ing, but delired him, that he would take particular care in making the •greement, that the boatmen fhould not be allowed to encumber the boat with any kind of merchandife or goods. This, upon Mr. Hope's propofing it to them, they readily agreed to, and the terms were committed to writing. A little after eight o'clock in the morning, we embarked, and to our great furprize found the beft of the three cabbins or rooms as they are called, filled with merchants goods. The boatman, without paying any regard to our remonftrances for the great injuftice he had done us, very unconcernedly put off from the fhore, and upon our giving him orders to land us again, he refufed to do it, and kept failing down the river. We hailed fome French officers, who were along-fide of us in another boat, tel ling them how we had been treated, and defiring their advice and afliftance in the affair; who replied, that they themfelves were under much the fame circumftances, but that at Mentx^ or Cologne^ juftice would certainly be done us. M ayence or At half paft three in the afternoon, we left the river Maine, and entered M hntz. Rhing^ anc i by four, got to the city of Mentz, an archbifliop's fee, and the firft of the electoral college. Its fortifications towards the river are inconfiderable, but we were told, that towards the land they are remark ably ftrong. It is a very large populous place, built much in the fame talle as Frqpckfort and other German cities, and would have been efteemed handfome in England, an hundred and fifty years ago. The ftreets are nar row but well paved, and are all fupplied with water from - the river by means of artificial canals, which prevent any offenfive fmells arifing from the common fewers.—A bridge of boats reaches from this city to the oppo- fite Ihore of the Rhine. 1 In the way to our inn, from the river's fide, we ftept into two of the principal churches ; they ftand clofe to each other, are both built in the Gothic tafte, and contain fome altar-pieces and tombs wh'ch are well worth feeing. In the cathedral, we were fhewn the morum nts cf many ot the archbilhops of Mentz^ who were alfo electors of the empire. Over their ' Map ^0([ 435 ] their tombs are feveral of their ftatues cut out in marble, with the coats of arms belonging to their refpedive families. In this cathedral the bones of St. Alexander *, and two of his fellow-lufferers in martyrdom, lie depofited in thiee Teveral caflcets, which are always fliewn to the ftrangers who vifit it. 1 hey are kept in the middle of a Iquare open Maufoleuwi^ within the choir, which is ornamented with handfome marble pillars at its four ano-les, and a beautiful carved foliage is carried from the architrave of one pillar to that of another. Here is alfo a well-toned, handfome organ, with a canopy of gold and filver tifTue, in which the miracle of our Saviour's railing Lazarus from the dead, is curioufly worked. The pulpit too is ele gantly finifhed, being fet off with pillars and pilafters made of alabafter, on whole bales are fome good Bajfo and Alto Relievos. We did not fee either the archbiflicp's palace, or the arfenal, becaufe the perfon whole bu- fmefs was to (hew them, could not be found. Mentz ftands on the left hand, as you go down the Rhine, near the February 22. jundion of that river with the Maine. Here our boatman difembarked the merchandife which had lb juftly given us offence. He would have left the city early in the morning, as foon at leaft as the gates had been opened, but was prevented by a very thick fog, which did not difperfe till one o'clock in the afternoon, when we got on board again, but got no farther than Bingen that evening, our watermen refufmg to proceed but by day-light. Bingen is a confiderable town, fituate at the mouth of the river Nahe^ which here empties itfelf into the Rhine. It is diftant about 16 Englijh miles from Mentz. We left Bingen this morning, and had a thick, fmall rain for the whole February 25. day. 1 mention this, becaufe it is the firft rain we have met with, fince our leaving the Lazaretto at Leghorn. We were almoft continually palling by towns and villages on both fides of the river. Vineyards alfo are all around us on the hills, and bear the appearance of hanging gardens even at this feafon of the year; they form a moft romantic and delightful profpe6V. This day we failed by the famous ifland of rats, where Hatto, the wicked archbiftiop of MentZy is faid to have been devoured alive by thole animals. At fix o'clock in the evening, we reached a fmall town, called Loenftein y from the river Loen which here falls into the Rhine, and continued there for the night. r * I apprehend that the St. Alexander here mentloRed, was Alexander the JirJl, Pope 0/Rome; who ordered holy water in its benedidtion to be mingled with fait, and fprinkled in private houfes, ' Ad dcemona morbo/que fug an do s' to drive away devils and difeafes; and water to be mingled with the wine, as a token of Chrift's union with his church.—He was martyred in Adrian's time. See Abridgment of Moreri's Diftionary, publilhed in 1703. K k k 2( 43 6 ] At feven this morning we put off our boats from Loenftein, the weather very foggy, and at half after two got to Coblentz. This city is very large I ^ ruar y 2 4* and populous, and the metropolis of the electorate and archbifhopric of blent z• cf reveSt i t i s pleafantly fituated on a point of land, which is formed by the meeting of the Mofelle and Rhine. Over the firft of thefe rivers, is a large ftone bridge of twelve arches, built for the convenience of the inha bitants of Cohlentz, and the adjacent places. A ferry machine is conftantly going from the city to the other fide of the Rhine, where is a little town and a very ftrong caftle built on an eminence, lliled ' The rock of ho nour;' in the German language, Ehrenhriejiein, The ferry-machine is built on two boats in the form of a large fquare gallery, encompaffed with bal- luftrades, and carries a tall flag-ftaff, on which are difplayed the arms of the eledlorate of Treves. This machine is put in motion, by the ferryman's pulling a rope, which is fixed to a ftandard on each fide of the river. The caftle appears to be almoft inacceflible to an enemy, and entirely com mands the city of Cohlentz. The archbifhop's palace (lands at the foot of the fame rock on which the caftle is built, and the arfenal at a little difr tance from the palace. Awd^ernach . At three quarters after eleven at night, we got to Andernach which is a fortified town, fituate on the weftern fide of the Rhine, and at the entrance of a fine open country, the mountains which hitherto had reached quite down to the river, ending juft before we arrived at this place. Here our boatman paid a toll, as indeed he had done before at many other places in our paflage down the river. At eight o'clock this morning we got to Bon, after having lain by, and flept all night in our boat. The city of Bon is the ufual refidence of the Eleflor of Cologne, whofe caftle and gardens are very curious. The fortifi cations of the city at this time are very confiderable, and in the year 1703 this place eoft the Duke of Marlborough twenty days open trenches before he took it. At half paft one o'clock, we arrived at Cologne, a rich and populous city, and faid to be the largeft in Germany. It is built in the form of a crefcent, and by fome called the Holy City from the great number of churches in it, which amount to Tome hundreds ; among them you are fhewn the reputed tombs of the three wife men, who vifited our Saviour by the guidance of a ftar, commonly called the three Kings of Cologne. It is well fortified towards the land, and has a ftrong wall next the Rhine. Five regiments of French fol- diers now make up the garrifon. Immediately on our landing, we repaired to the Hotel d*Holland, and after refrefhing ourfelves, intended to have pro ceeded dire&lt;5Uy on our journey by land ; but on fending our fervants to the poft-houfe for horfes, we had the mortification to find, that there was no poffibility of getting any till the next morning, every one belonging to the poft- poft -maftf Uan opt Horfes v off from Ci number wl Fror Nxvj, h by the Gtr whidi is ei We dro\ tairce on 01 Bmmi then fet off % is a c( be made longing ta cavalry qua very agrcea 'eft Nuji b ov er a mo( cached tht wer e gettin Here w now to be tilions wca fcall Fren inoft p art advance 1 t ^ e Pmc fize. 0^ an d expflC 437 I poft -mafter having been hired yefterday to carry people to Eon, where an Italian opera, and other diverfions, are to be exhibited this night.

They have a regiment of cavalry quartered here at prefent, who, while we ftaid to refrefh ourfelves, very agreeably entertained us wrth feveral tunes on their French -horns. We left iVajy-f between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, and travelling over a moft charming, and well-cultivated country, by eleven-at night, we reached the fmall village of Ilochfirat ; and during the time that frefh horfes Hochstrat, were getting ready for us, we threw ourfelves on fome chairs, and took a- little fleep. Here we muft bid adieu to the gay livery-drefs of our poftilions ; and are now to be drove by plowmen both in drefs and behaviour. In Italy the pof- tilions wear a coat of blue cloth turned up with red, a laced har, and carry a fmall horn acrois their fhoulders, decked with taffels. In the fouthern- jnoft parts of Germany, the poftilioa's livery is always of a red cloth. As you • advance farther northward, it changes to a yellow faced with black, and the Fr^^-horn at every hundred miles diftance, gradually increafes in its fize. Our prefent fhabby poftilions have the vanity alfo to carry a horn,, and exped that the fame relped fhall be paid by all travellers to its found, asFebruary 27. Rhinp.berg. S akten. [ 438 ] as has been done to the horns of their well-drefled brethren. The fellow who drove us to Hochftrat, did not ride one of the horfes, but feated him- felf on a low box, and made ufe of a long whip. At half paft two this morning, we left Hochjlrat, and at five got to the gates of Rhineberg. The French are aifo in pofleflion of this place, and have a garrifon quartered in it. The gates however were opened to us without a queltion being afked relative to our paflports. This town is fituated on the weftern fide of the Rhine, and at about a mile and half dif- tance from it. The country round this place is very pleafant, and well cul tivated. Since we entered the Prujfian territories, we have frequently met with direflion pofts on the road, which though of great afllftance to a ftranger, are not to be feen in countries more to the fouthward. At twenty minutes after eight o'clock, we got to a fmall eminence, and difcovered the town of Santen lying at the foot of it. We had likewife in our view a molt beautiful vale, very broad and extenfive, with the river Rhine running through the midfl: of it. From this eminence, we could plainly difcover feyeral fpires belonging to the churches in Cleves. We reached Santen at nine o'clock in the morning. This town alfo belongs to the King ot but is at prefent.under the fubjeftion of the French^ who have railed enormous contributions here, to the impoverilhment of the poor inhabitants. We left Santen at half pafi; nine o'clock, and at two in the afternoon ar rived at the poft-office of Cleves, which ftands juft without the gates of the city, from hence we were obliged to lend a fervant with our paflports to the officer commanding the Fnnch garrifon, with a requeft that he would give an order to the poil-mafter to fupply us with fix horfes. The officer complied with our defires, but not before he had put feveral queftions to the fervant relating to our journey and charafters, and exprefled great fur- prize at our thus venturing to pafs through the armies of the Grand Mo narch. Cleves is a confiderable city, feated on an eminence, about four miles *rom the Rhine. We travelled towards it over a very fandy road, of a long but gradual afcent, having both on the right and left hand of us, a double row of fine elm-trees, which had a pretty efFeft, and greatly add to the agreeable fuuation of the place, and the beauties of its environs. Ve left Cleves at three o'clock in the afternoon, and at fix arrived at Nimegnen. ' &lt; NiMEcv.v This city is large, and firongly fortified, and the ftreets are well paved and regular.

Between ten and eleven o 'clock this morning, we embarked in a boat February we hired here to carry us to Rotterdam, for which we agreed to pay forty guilders ^ and at half atter five in the afternoon, we got to a confiderable town leated, as Nimeguen is, on the left-hand fide of the river Waal, called BmmL 1 he wind not being fair for us, our Ikipper fleered the boat to the Bommsl. right-hand fide ot the river, to lie by for the night: we therefore went alhoie, and repaired to a imall neat public-houfe, where we met with the beft accommodations. i. Wereimbarked this morning at feven o'clock, and at ten pafled by Lovef- March .. tttn cattle. In half an hour more we reached Gorcum, a confiderable town, Gorcum leated on the right-hand fide of the river. The whole country about us is flat and low, but at the fame time looks extremely rich. An infinite num ber of willows are regularly planted all along the banks of the river, which in the lummer feafon muft form one of the moft delightful prorpe(5ls in the world. At two o'clock in the afternoon, we got abreaft of Bort, a laro-e Dort. town, and very confiderable port, famous for the Proteftant fynod hetd here in 1618. At half pad ux we arrived at Rotterdam, where we had the iatisfaflion to receive letters from our families and friends in England, agree able to inftruclions we had given them from Leghorn. i his is the richeft town of the feven united provinces, except R otterv dam, with clean, regular fbreets, and canals fo cut that the largeft fhips can d am . come up to the very doors of the merchants. We vifited their anatomical March 2 ' ichool, and were fhewn the moft curious preparations laid up there, but did not find them comparable to fome we had before feen in England. Phis city being the birth-place ot Erafmus, we had the curiofity to go and fee his ftatue, which is well executed in bronze. We vifited alio the ex- $ ' ' 1 he extreme moifture ot the air I take to be the occaCon of the great neatnefs of their houfes, and cleanlinels of their towns. For without the help of thofe cuftoms their country would not be habitable by 1 uch crowds of people, but the air would corrupt upon every hot feafbn, and expofe the inhabitants to general and infectious difeafes, which they hardly efcape three fummers together, efpecially about Leyden, where the waters are not fo eafily renewed ; and for this reafbn, I luppofe it is, that Leyden is found to be the neatell and cleaneft kept, of all their towns. The fame moiflure of air makes all metals apt to ruft, and wood to mould ; which forces them, by continual pains ot rubbing and icouring, to fcek a prevention, or cure ; this makes the brightnefs and cleannefs that feems afiefted in their houfes, and is called natural to them, by people who think no further. So the deepnefs of their foil, and wetnefs of feafons, which will render it unpalfable, forces them, not only to exaftnefs in paving their ftreets, but to the expence of fo long caufeways between many of their towns, and in their high-ways: as in deed, moft national cuftoms are the effeft of fome unfeen, or unobferved natural caufes or necefTities.'

Toon after the edifice was finiftied, that it appeared to be in great danger of falling •, by a proper and curious application how ever of the mechanical powers, the defed was perfedly remedied, and this building now ftands as upright, as any other of the churches in the city. At Rotterdam we intended to have difpofed of our Italian chaifes, which :had coaft us near forty pounds each, but not being able to get more than about eight fequins for them, we refolved to have them conveyed to England^ in expectation that it would anfwer better to fell them there. And Mr. Rofe (a Britijh merchant who relided here) was fo obliging as to agree with the mafter of a Ihip to land mine ar. Port/mouthy for three pounds ten (hil lings. We had been told at Leghorn, that we fhould be able to fell our carriages zi Rotterdam for two-thirds at leaft of what they coft us; but we experienced quite the contrary, and the reafon is, becaufe our Englijh gentlemen, who ufed to be travelling abroad, are by the prelent war con- jined at home confequently thefe foreign carriages are now of little ufe or value. At nine o'clock in the evening, we embarked in a ketch for Helvoetfluys, and by three quarters after nine in the morning, arrived there, difembarkcd, and put up at a public houfe kept by Mr. Fell an Englijhman. Hehoetjluys is a clean, little fea-port town, where the packet-boats, which pafs between England and Holland, are always ftationed. At the upper end of the town, is a large bafon, in which lie three or four Dutch ihips of war, in or dinary. At eight this morning, we went on board the packet-boat, and made fail for England-, but at five in the afternoon, the wind coming from the welt, we were obliged to put back, and in a few hours got again to Hehoetjluys. This morning at eleven o'clock, we once more put to fea, and in a few hours difcovered a fail, bearing down towards us, whom we fLiipe^ed to be an enemy. The mafler of a Dutch veffel affured us, that the fhip in fight was a French privateer, upon which we altered our courle, and pre tended as if we were putting back to Helvoetjluys ; but at fix in the evening, when it became dark, the mafter put the packet about, and ftood for the northward, by which means we had the good luck to efcape the enemy, and at half paft eleven the next morning, had the unfpeak- Harwich. able joy of entering the long wiflied-for port of Harwich, Thus after an irkfome abfence of more than five years, and a journey at tended with fuch a feries of difappointment, difficulty, and illnefs, I once more fafely landed on my native fhorei and in thirty-fix hours afterwards, was made g completely March 4.

TO avoid interruptions in the narrative, I omitted to enlarge on the feveral difeafes with which the fquadron was afflidled. I fhali now treat of that fubjed more diftindly, as fomething of this kind will certainly be expecled from a perfon of my profefTion ; and I flatter myfelf, that, although I mean to be concife, yet, what I have to offer will be of fome fervice to the general interefts of the navy. On this occafion I beg leave to carry the reader as far back as the 9th of March 1754, when Mr. iVatfon left Plymouth with all his fhips com panies in perfedl health. In the months of May and June following, feveral diforders took place in the fquadron, and in fpite of the united efforts of all our officers, who ordered the decks to be conftantly fwept and fcraped, and the ventilators to be daily ufed, by the 9th of July^ when we arrived at Madagafcar, they had increafed to fo great a degree, that the Kent alone had buried twelve men, befides a large number who were reduced to fuch an extremity, that they muft have died, had we con tinued only a few days more at fea. The diforders under which the Kent's people laboured at this time, were principally Putrid Fevers, and Putrid Fluxes-, which though common to hot climates, were, I believe, confiderably increafed by the great quantities of ftock-fifh and other provifions ftowed in the fifh-room and between the guns of the lower deck: the fifh becoming putrid by the heat of the wea ther, and by their long continuance there, emitted fuch a noxious fmell, as made the air, in every part of the fhip below, unfit for refpiration. Be fides, by this time the fea water had unavoidably made its way through the chinks of the ports and hawfe-holes, and by its linking effluvia had greatly added to the contagion. L 1 1 2 It[ 444 ] It would be almofl: needlefs to defcribc the particular manner in which I treated thofe patients, while they lay on board, as there was nothing tin- common in my pradife; it will be fufficient to obferve, that I made it my principal care, to keep them as clean in their perfons and births as pofiible; to purify the air around them as much as lay in my power j and not only antileptic medicines were adminiftered, but wines, punch, and culinary afliftances were daily fent them from the admiral's, captain's, and lieute nants ftores. Indeed, it is to thefe ads of humanity in the officers, and to the unwearied diligence of the fdrgeon's mates in feeing thefe fupplies pro perly applied, that the prefervation of many of their lives muft be attributed. I have obferved in the voyage, that at our landing on the ifland of Mada- gafcar, where we met with a variety of frefh provifions and vegetables, efpecially thofe of the acid kind, our fick people were reftored to their health and ftrength in a very fhort time j and only four of thofe who were put on fhore from onboard the Kent, died. The fquadron left that ifland on the feventh of Auguft, and arrived at Fort St. David on the 10th of September following, in a condition as to health, that was by no means to be called bad ; but we thought it prudent, (notwithftanding we were fo foon to fail for Bombay) to fend on fhore to the hofpital 78 of the moil fickly of our (hips crews, moft of whom were labouring either un der fcorbutic or bilious complaints •, for bilious diforders begun to make their appearance among us ibon after our getting to India. The fcurvy however was now become the moft predominant diftemper, which was undoubtedly owing to our fea paflage from Madagafcar to Fort St, David. Between the 14th of November 1754 an d the 14th of February in the following year, 104 patients were fent from two (hips to the hofpital at Bombay, who chiefly laboured under fcurvies and fluxes. There were feme alfo very ill in bilious fevers; the fluxes were either of the fcorbutic or bilious fort. At this period likewife, the fcurvy appears to have been the moll prevailing diftemper, which perhaps was in a great meafure owing to its being the winter feafon. On the Coromandel coaft, between the 24th of January 1755J and the 24th ot Oifober following, we received at the hofpitals, from the Kent) (Amber la nd, Tyger, Salijhury, Bridgewater, and King's-fjher, 12 14 * patients, of whom 1 OS only were in fcurvies j the much greater part of the reft were down in bilious fevers, bilious fluxes, or fome other diforder that difcovered an overflowing of the bile in the conftitution. As this was the fummer * The reader is not to fuppofe by 12 14 patients, that fo many diftind perfons were fent iick irom the Ihips; for the compliment of the whole fquadron at any one time did not exceed j 800; he is to be apprifed, that the fame man may have been fent to the hofpital, and after f cured difcharged ; then fent again on account of a relapfe, or his being feized with another diforder, within the time mentioned in this account.—This obfervadon is to be ap plied on every future occafion. 3 feafon,[ 445 ] ieafon, it will fufficiently account for the number of my icorbutic patients being very trifling, in comparifon of thofe who were afflifled with bilious complaints. At Bomhay, between the 10th of November 1755, and the 27th of April ®75^&gt; we received into the holpital from the whole fcjuadron 1334 patients t of whom 514 were in fcurvies, and fcorbutic fluxes. The reft were dif- eafed with various hepatic complaints, common diforders, or cafes of furgery. Here it is worthy of remark, that this was the winter feafon, when the fcurvy again became the predominant diftemper among us. On the Coromandel coaft, betweeQ April 1756, and the 12th of ORoher following, we received into the hofpital from all the ftiips 847 patientSi of whom 132 were in fcurvies, 108 in bilious fevers, 163 in bilious fluxes, and 223 in bilious obftruflions. The remaining 221 were down in various diforders, but even in moft of thefe, the bile was predominant. A very few chirurgical and venereal complaints are to be excepted.—This again was the fummer feafon, and we fee plainly, that bilious diforders were by much the moft prevalent during this period. On board the Proteftor an occafional hofpital (hip in Bengal river, and at the hofpital at Calcutta, between the 25th of December 1756, and the 8th of February 1757, we received 455 patients from the king's fhips, of whom 72 were in the worft ftage of the fcurvy, 27 in convulfions of the bowels from a fcorbutic cafe, co-operating probably with the muddy water of the river; 12 in putrid fevers, and the remaining 104 were ill of various diforders, all of which, except a few cafes of furgery, partook of the fcurvy. Out of the whole number received into the hofpital here, I find, that at the clofe of the firft quarterly account, we buried 27 men: a par ticular mention of the number of the dead, may be proper to exhibit a com parative view of the mortality attending the difeafes of the fquadron in Bengal^ and our other fettlements in India, Here my former obfervation re- fpe&amp;ng the difference of feafons, once more holds good, for thefe being the winter months, the fcorbutic diforders greatly increafed, while thofe of the bilious kind decreafed in the fame proportion. I muft add, that the fqua dron juft before had a long and fatiguing paflage of feven weeks from the Coromandel zoiSk \o the x'wtx ot Bengal', which doubtlefs was an additional reafon why the fcurvy fo greatly prevailed at this time. At Calcutta, between the 8th of February 1757 and the 7th of Auguft following, we received into the hofpital 1140 patients, of whom 54 were ill in fcurvies, 302 in bilious fevers, 109 in intermittents, 16 in meafles, 32 in bilious and bloody fluxes, 56 in bilious cholics, 21 in venereal com plaints; and 155 were chirurgical cafes. Out of the whole number we buried 52 men. It is neceflary here to obferve, that much the greater part of this time, the weather was exceedingly hot and dry j confequently, during[ 446 ] during that feafon, bilious difeafes were mofl: predominant: afterwards when the rains had let in, the interrnittents began to make their an' pearance. At the fame place between the 7th of Auguft 1757, and the 7th of November following, (during the greater part of which period, the weather being lulcry and rainy), we received into the hofpital 717 frefh patients befides 430 who were there before ; fo that in the whole we had in this in terval 1147 on fhore. Among the 717 which were taken in laft, there were 20 only in fcurvies, 147 in putrid fevers, 304 in intermitting fevers 19 in putrid bloody fluxes, 155 in putrid fluxes; 10 in bilious ob^trLla:ions , 6 in inflammations of the bowels ; 6 in confumptions, and 19 cafes of furgerv! The 41 unaccounted for, were made up of men labouring under various diforders, but fuch as in general difcovered a putrefcent difpofition in the conititution. ^ Out of the whole number that were in the hofpital at this time, we buried 101, which added to thofe we had before loft in the Pro- tettor, and in the hofpital, fince our arrival in the river, (which took in no more than 10 months and 13 days) make our whole lofs to amount to 180. And tms is exclufive of fuch as had been (lain in battle, or who had died on board their refpedive fhips before a provifion had been made for their re ception in the Protefior, or on fliore. So that (as will foon be fliewn) the number of men buried in Bengal, amounted to more than half of all who died in the feveral hofpitals in India, during the whole time of Admiral yy atfon s command, and for fome fhort time after his death, including a period of three years, one month, and 14 days. 0 Thus far it is evident, that in the winter feafon, and during a Ion? continu ance at fea, the fcurvy is the difeafe to which failors are moft fubjed: in hot climates ; that in the fummer months, when the weather is hot and dn, bilious fevers and fluxes are the prevailing diftempers ; and that putrid fluxes and tntermittents are particularly incidental to European failors in the Jultry and rainy feafons at Bengal. ■ : I fhall now produce as exa^ an account as our hofpital books will r^Ti - r patle , nt reived at different times into the leveral hof&gt; 1 ro . m ^ I 3 th 1 of September 1754, to the 7th of November /57&gt; which includes the whole of the time they were under my care; and to each particular diieafe, I fhall put the number of thofe who died in il i he whole number received into the hofpitals, amounted to 6062.

Gun-fliot wounds 131, died 17. Stumps after limbs amputated 15, died 9. Blown up by gun-powder 13, died 3. Scalds 4. By the foregoing account, the number of dead amounts to 241 ; but befides thefe, there were alfo 87 perfons who died chiefly in fluxes, fevers, intermitting, or bilious diforders: but as at the time of their deaths they Itand on the hofpital books under the article -of ' fundry perfons remaining for a confiderable while in the hofpital in various difeafes fo at this time it is not practicable to exactly aicertain what were their refpedive com plaints, or to fix a name to thofe diforders that carried them off. I once intended to have written very particularly of the feveral difeafes to which Europeans are fubjedt in the Eafi Indies •, but having again and again read over, and always with frefli delight, that excellent eflay on this fubjeft publiflied by my ingenious and learned friend Dr. Lind^ I am obliged to confefs, that I find myfelf altogether at a lofs for new matter. Inftead therefore of offering any thing of my own on this head, I think it will anfwer a better purpofe to make a few abftradts from the doctor's very valuable book, and for more particular information refer to the work itfelf. * ' Next to Bencoolen, of all the Englijh factories, the climate of Bengal proves the moft fatal to Europeans. The rainy feafon commences at Bengal in June, and continues till Otfober j the remainder of the year is healthy and pleafant. * p. 78-[ 448 ] ' During the rains, this rich and fertile country is quite covered bf the Ganges, and &amp; converted as it were into a large pool of water. In the month of Oftoher, when the ftagnated water begins to be exhaled by the heat of the fun, the air is then greatly polluted by the vapours'from the flime and mud left by the Ganges, and by the corruption of dead fifh and other animals. Difeafes then rage, attacking chiefly fuch as are lately arrived. Here, as in all other places, ficknefs is more frequent and fatal in fome years than others. The diftempers are fevers, of the remitting or intermitting kind: for though fometimes they may continue feveral days, without any perceptible remiflion, yet they have in general a great tendency to it, and are commonly accom panied with violent fits of rigors and fhiverings, and with difcharges of bile upwards and downwards. If the feafon be very fickly, fome are feized with a malignant fever, of which they foon die. The body is covered with blotches of a livid colour, and the corpfe in a few hours turns quite black and corrupted. At this time fluxes prevail, which may be called bilious * or putrid, the better to diftinguifli them from others which are accom panied with an inflammation of the bowels. In all difeafes at Bengal, the lancet is cautioufly to be ufed. ' But to quit Bengal, let us proceed to obferve—That though the air in the Englijh prefidentfliip of Bombay is not fo pure as at Madrajs, yet it is much more wholefome than at Bengal the coaft of Malabar being pretty healthy, though inferior in this refpedl to the coaft of Coromandel. ' The ifland of Bombay has of late been rendered much more healthy than it was formerly, by a wall which is now built to prevent the incroach- ment of the fea, where is formed a fait marfli, and by an order that none of the natives fhould manure their cocoa-nut trees with putrid filh. ' At Surat and ¥dlicherry^ on the fame coaft, Eurepeans generally enjoy a ,good ftate of health. ' Madrafs is efteemed the moft healthy government belonging to the Englijh: and indeed the air of the whole coalt of Coromandel is in general pure and temperate, in refpeft of many other parts of India, not only Madrafs, but St. David's, Cuddalore, and Negapatnam the Dutch prefident- fhip on this coaft. ' Befides thefe malignant and remitting fevers, which rage during the wet feafon, and fome time after it, in the unhealthy parts of the Eaft Indies, * In my hofpital accounts there is a diftinftion made between the bilious and putrid flux. In the firlt fort there was always heat and fome degree of inflammation in the conjlitution an bowels, accompanied with a full pulfe. In the latter the patients had chills, their fkms were clammy, and pulfe feeble. And what was commonly underftood to make the dillinftion, was, that in the bilious fort, the bile was not in a corrupted or putrid ftate, in the other it was. r Europeans,m Europeans^^ efpecially fuch as live intemperately, are alfo fubied to fluxes and to an inflammation or difeafe of the liver ; which laft is almoft peculia^ to India, and particularly to the Coromandel coaft. ^^ uxes . are Seldom here accompanied with inflammatory fymptoms* the dncharge being chiefly of a putrid or bilious nature, they are removed bv ad- miniftermg firft a vomit, then rhubarb^ and laftly ipecacuanha in fmall dofes After the bile and other putrefcent humours have been thus fufficiently evacuated, opiates, with a diet of rice, and fuch food as is antifeptic, muft be prefenbed. r The difeafe of the liver is generally preceded by a high fever, a dif ficulty of breathing, and a violent pain fixed in the right fide upon the feat of the liver, to which the fick perfon often applies his hand, feekin^ for relief*. On its firft attack the patient fhould lofe blood, and the part ought to be bathed with a warm, relaxing and difcutient fomentation; or a blifter may be applied to it. When by bleeding, the fever is fomewhat abated, a gentle purge or clyfter being previoufly adminiilered, immediate recourfe mull be had to mercury, as a fpecific for this difeafe. A gentle fahvation of 15 or 20 days muft be raifed by means of the mercurial oint ment rubbed upon or near the affefted part, together with the ufe of mer curial pills of calomel taken occafionally.' To thefe obfervations of Dr. Z/W, I beg leave to add my own teftimony, that I almoft always found a falivation to be a fpecific in fuch complaints. Now and then it happened, that in the height of a ptyalifm, the mercury turned on the bowels, and brought on a fatal bloody flux ; but notwithftand- ing this, upon the whole I will venture to pronounce mercury to be the moft efficacious of all medicines in fuch cafes. I may add, that it is the onlv medicine yet known which gives a patient any chance for his life, fince without his undergoing a falivation, an abfeefs of the liver is almoft fure to take place, and which in the end proves fatal. For inftances of fuch abfeeflfes, I muft refer to two or three, which have been particularly ftated, and with great care and judgment, by Mr. John Bogue, now furgeon of Admiral Sir Robert Harland's Ibip in the Eafl Indies, and which are preferved in Dr. Lind's eflay. I cannot finifli this fubjeft without obferving, that about the time Mr. JVatfon\ fquadron entered Bengal river, a moft melancholy fcene was exhibited by thefcurvy: It raged with fuch violence, as to make great devaftation among us. This malady (as before obferved) was entirely owing to the very long paflage we had in our voyage from the Coromandel coaft to * And he always complains of a pain in one or both of the (houlders. M m m[ 45° ] Bengal, and in the winter feafon. The Kent it is true loft but few of her people in this diforder, but the other Ihips of the fquadron buried a great many which difference, I am perfuaded, was occafioned by the large quantity of orange and lemon juices that I had preferved in a half hogfhead during our flay at MaSagafcar, and which I now ordered to be daily given them in their common liquor. At this time, not only mofl: of the fad fymptdms of the fcurvy, which have been fo accurately enumerated by Dr. Lind, made their appearance, but two others, not mentioned by him, were unfortunately fuperaddedj viz. the Scrotum in many patients was iwollen to an enormous fize, equal to that of a globe of 12 inches diameter, and the contents of this fweliing was water, as appeared upon our tapping the Scrotum. The other un- ufual effed: was a convulfive fpafm of the inteftines, which fuddenly car ried off feveral men. Some who were thus attacked, recovered, but others remained in the moft exquifite torture for twenty-four hours, and then expired. From the foregoing obfervations, and from others taken notice of in the courfe of the narrative, thefe four general inferences are indifputably clear. Firft, That (hips bound to the Eaft Indies fhould be as little incumbered with ftores between decks, as pofTible. Secondly, That dryed ftock-fidi, which upon the account of hav ing no fait ufed in the curing of them, are fometimes put on board our {hips of war, to prevent the fcurvy breaking the amongft our peo ple, by their foon corrupting and growing putrid, are fo far from an- fwering the good intention, that on the contrary they are productive of much evil. Thirdly, That as but few, if any, of the Kenfs people died in the fcurvy during our winter's paffage to Bengal, whilft the other (hips of the fquadron buried many •, io this difference ci.n no other way be ac counted for, but by the antifcorbutic quality of the orange and lemon juices. It therefore follows, that if ^government would be fo far at tentive to this fubje6l, as to order all fhips bound to the Eajl Indies to ftop at Madagafcar, or any other proper place, and take in. fome pipes of thefe juices, which might be made up into punch, and ferved to the feveral crews inftead of grog •, they would certainly be the means of preferving many liyes, and greatly redound to the emolument of the nation *, \ * This obfervation will hold good in every other country that abounds with thefe fruits. See I)r. Linci\ laft edition of hisTreatife on the Scurvy, p. 541, where my remarks on this inte- lefting fubjtft are more fully fet faith. Laftly,••&lt;- ■ «■&lt;*■'■ m [ 45 1 ] Laftly, Since intermittents, and other putrid diforders, arc found to be fo prevalent in Bengal, fhips deftined to the Eafi Indies, ought therefore to be lupplied with a very large quantity of the Peruvian bark and Ipecacuanha root-, and (as Dr. Lind has juftly obferved in reiped to the firft article) the lurgeons of the navy fliould on that account be excufed from taking'with them other drugs, not wanted, or which may at a little expence be pro cured by themfelves in the Eafi Indies. I think it my duty alfo to infert in this place fuch diredions and obfer- vations, as my own experience and refiedion have furnifhed me with dur ing my long fervice in the navy, with refped to the mod eligible method of managing the wounded in the time of adion ; a point of fuch im portance as equally demands the attention both of the Jurgeon and the commander. The firfb engagement I was in, was that between the late excellent and well known naval commander Commodore Barnet and the Chevalier de Caylus in the Mediterranean, in the year 1741, when feveral of our men were wounded by the fhot of the enemy, and others blown up by fome car tridges of gunpowder taking fire. At that time I too fenfibly experienced the very great inconvenience of the furgeon's attending the wounded in the Cockpit, the place then, and in the late war, too commonly allotted for this important bufinefs. At the very inftant when I was amputating the limb of one of our wounded feamen, I met with an almoll continual interruption from the reft of his companions, who were in the like diltrefsful circumftances; fome pouring forth the moft piercing cries to be taken care of, while others feized my arm in their earneftnefs of being relieved, even at the time that I was paffing the needle for fecuring the divided blood-velTeis by a ligature. Surely, at the time when fuch operations are in contemplation, the opera tor's mind as well as body ought to be as little agitated as poffible j and the very fhaking of the lower gun-deck, owing to the recoil of the large cannon which are placed juft over his head, is of itfelf fufficient to incommode a furgeon, and in a confiderable degree prevent the fkilful per formance of his duty. I muft add, that a place of entire fecurity to the furgeon and his affiftants in the time of an engagement, is an objed of the greateft con- fequence, how much foever it may have been hitherto overlooked or dif- regarded. In the two lad wars we met with feveral inftances ot furgeons or their mates being wounded in the Cockpit by cannon balls, which plainly M m m 2 evince i \, | i * 1[ 452 ] evince that this cannot be a proper ftation for men, upon, whofe perfonal fecurity, the lives of fo many brave feamen entirely depend. I would earneftly recommend it therefore to the Commanders of our (hips of war that the printed inftrudions of the navy, relative to the place in which the furgeon is to be ftationed, during the time of adion, be literally carried into execution : and that inftead of the too common and abfurd cuftom of con fining him to the Cockpit, a platform be erefted for his ufe in the Hold, where being as much as poffible fecured from all apprehenfion of danger' his mind will be quite calm and ferene, and his judgment undifturbed [ confequently he will be more capable of performing thofe difficult operations, which he is always lure to meet with in a fevere en^a^e- ment. D D This point, it muft be owned, is a very delicate one in refpedt to the iurgeon, who, fhould he make an application to his commandino- officer for this purpofe, might fubjeft himfelf to the jocofe fmiles of fome of his fhipmates, and to the unkind farcafms of others, who would be ra ther apt to impute his folicitude on this head to the care he takes of his own perfon, than to any good conlequences he thinks tray hence ariie to the public. ^ 1 his was exactly my cale in the feveral fhips I ferved on board of; and yet in fpite of cenfure on one hand, and ridicule on the other, I had always refolunon fufficient to declare my fentiments openly on this fubjeft; and never once tailed in the end to convince the commander, of the un- fpeakable advantages that neceffarily muft attend it. As many able, but modeft practitioners, however, may, through the fear ot being thought over folicitous about their own fafety, too timidly give up fo important a point; I take the liberty in their behalf, of thus pub licly addrefiing myfelf to the commanders of our navy in general, befeech- jng them, that for the fake of their own and their crew's lives, and for the fake ot their country, they would take this matter into their moft ferious confiueration, and in times of war order a proper platform to be laid in the Hold tor the reception of the wounded, without waiting for any applica tion from the furgeon of the (hip. As an inducement for their fo doing, 1 beg leave to fet before them the example ot the late Admiral Leftock (who was univerfally allowed to be as good a fea-officer as any of the age) and who upon the profpedt of his Ihip s coming into action in the year 1744 (though at that time he was laid up^with a levere nt of the gout) caufed himfelf to be carried into the Neptune s Hold, that he might be an eye-witnefs of the platform being pro- perly conftrudted, which he had before particularly ordered for that place. And this able and judicious officer was often heard to declare, that in the courfe of his early fervices he had fully experienced the ill confequences a contrary meafure,. and therefore always recommended this for which I am[ 453 J am pleading, to thofe gentlemen who ferved under himj as a matter of the higheft importance. The brave Captain Speke (a man as much diftinguifhed by his pru dence in advifing, as by his adivity in executing) did not fcruple to own himfelf thoroughly convinced by my reafoning on this fubjed *, and though much innocent pleafantry had occafionally fallen from him whenever this became the topic of our converfation, yet afterwards, at the attack of Chan' dernagore, when he himfelf was brought down wounded into the Hold, and there faw the neceffity of the arrangement I have been recommending, he with great ferioufnefs made the following declaration to me : ' No fur- geon, my friend, fhall ever again be put to the pain of applying to me for a platform in the Hold-, for I now too well perceive what diftrefs and embarraffment muft have attended both you and the wounded, had you been obliged to receive and drefs them all indifcriminately in the Cockpit:* The method which was at that time taken, and which with fubmiffion, I think always fhould be taken, was, all the wounded were fent into the Cockpit, until that place could hold no more ; afterwards a part of them were conveyed into the Cable 'Tier, Two of my mates were ftationed there, to examine into the nature of their wounds. Such as were defperately hurt, and whofe cafes, in the opinion of thofe gentlemen, required an im mediate operation, were brought by the afliftants to me and my other mates, who were waiting for them on the platform in the Hold. Thofe who were lefs wounded, were drefled by my two mates in the Cockpit, and then placed on the fail, fpread there for that purpofe; or on a floor made of boards, and covered with canvas, in the Cahle Tier, I cannot conclude, without hinting to my brethren the furgeons of the navy, that had I in my earlier years known the confequences of a hot and bloody engagement, as well as I do now, I never would have embarked on board a large fhip of war, without furnifliing myfelf with fix or more amputating knives inftead of two or three ; having learnt from experience, that the beft of knives after an operation or two quite lofe their keennefs; and unfortunately, the exigency of the time is fuch, as will not admit of their being properly reftored by the hone. The fame reafon holds good with refpeft to the number of faws, which in like manner ought to be in- creafed, for to difplace the old, and to put the fpare faw to the frame, is equally inconvenient in the time of aftion. I wouM alfo advife every fur- sreon to furnifh himfelf with a greater number of crooked needles than have been commonly thought fufficient; for unlefs he has experimentally known it, it is impoffible for him to conceive, how many of thefe are either loft or miflaid during the noife and confufion of an engagement. ^ Having ■ • k[ 454 ] Having given the beft directions in my power, for the better management of the wounded in a day of battle, with a few hints to the captains of our men of war; I could wifh to afcend to the Lords Commiftioners of the Ad miralty, and other gentlemen to whom the condudt of our naval affairs is committed, and pray them to take into confideration the prefent difcou- raging fituation of the furgeons of the royal navy. It is univerfally allowed, that many of thefe gentlemen, are men of the greateft abilities in thei r profeffion ; and the importance of their ftation, to a kingdom whole very exiltence depends on the welfare of its feainen, ap pears at firft fight, without the trouble of entering into a long chain of rea- ibning. It is alio as true, that the fcanty provifion at prefent made for the furgeons of this * fervice, when they are out of commiflion, gives but little encouragement, either for retaining thofe who are now on the lift, or for the acquiring other able ones, fiiould there be occafion by the breaking out of a new war; for only fifty of the feniors out of three hun dred and upwards whole names are mentioned on the naval lift, have any claim to half pay ; while the others are put to the moft wretched fhifts to earn even a precarious fubfiftence. And what adds greatly to the hardfhip of their cafe, is, that a great majority of them are gentlemen, who have had the advantages of a good education, and been regularly brought up in their profefllon ; who embarked in the fervice in their youth, or prime of life, have done their duty for feveral years with great credit, and at laft after the war was ended, were left to the mercy of a wide world, as much, or more at a lofs to get their daily bread, than they were the firft day after their apprenticefhip expired. It mufl: be confeflfed, that a few of them out of fo large a number, by their own merit and afliduity, or by the deaths of old praftitioners in the feveral places where they fixed themfelves after the peace was made, have at this time the happinefs to acquire a comfortable fubfiftence. But can it be imagined, that thefe men will ever engage in the navy again (tho' their inclinations may poflibly lead them to do it) unlefs they could de pend on a more certain provifion being made for them after another war was ended ? It cannot, it muft not be expelled from them. And how much the public fervice will fuffer in the want of fuch experienced lurgeons, I need not mention. For though, upon the breaking out of a new war, there is no doubt but that many young men bred up to this profeflion, would offer themfelves as candidates for a naval employ, yet being new to the fea, and quite unacquainted with pra(5lice, they cannot pofTibly be put in competition with thofe older furgeons, who have been long inured to the fervice, even on the fuppofition that their refpedive edu cations were exactly the fame. * Every furgeon of the army is intitled to half pay. 5 I i';Went (ilk [ 455 ] I intreat the liberty therefore, (after above 30 years fervice as a fur- geon in the navy, and when no advantage can poffibly arife from it to my- felf) to recommend it as an objea: worthy of the attention of government, that a greater number of Naval furgeons be put upon the half pay lift! An effort of this kind, will not fail of proving highly honourable to its chief promoters; and as hereby a great many excellent praftitioners will be fecured in the fervice of the public, it is fufficiently evident, that in the end it muft redound to the advantage of Great Britain. ■ 1 •; • . - A P P E N-[ 4J6 ] APPENDIX, N o . ir. Indian Trees, Shrubs, Plants , and Medicines. C ocoa -N ut T ree. ALTHOUGH mention hath already been made of the Cocoa -nut tree, yet as its produflions are of fuch great confequence to the natives of the Eaft Indies, I cannot avoid prefenting it a fecond time to the notice of the reader. It has neither bark nor branch, increafes an nually, and at length gets to a prodigious height. Some of the trees arc of 50 years (landing, and 60 feet high, but none are ever more than 18 inches diameter. The root is compofed of a great number of black foft fibres, which are tough, 15 or 16 inches long, and of the thicknefs of a goofe quill. The body, or ftalk, is fingle, and full of tough, perpendi cular, and oblique fibres. A bundle of leaves fhoot out annually in a kind of fpatha from the top of the ftalk, and is concave towards the centre of the plant; when thefe leaves firft fhoot out and open fully, they are per pendicular, and then the leaves of the laft year are gradually forced from them, and become horizontal. Thofe of the preceding year fall off, or arc cut down by the Toddy gatherers. The old leaves are compofed of a ftrong and large middle rib, which fometimes next to the body of the tree is as thick as a man's thigh, and 18 or 20 feet in length. From the bundle all around the tree, leaves of two feet or more in length Toon grow, thefe are double at the bafe, affixed to the rib, and grow taper to a point at the end ; thefe leaves ftand very clofe together, and at the top of the tree form an almoft perfedl, and pretty looking circle. The flower comes out from the concave part of the leaves on the top of the tree •, the footftalk of which is as thick as a large man's wrift, and nearly round; this di vides and fubdivides into many branches, among which are the flowers, fend which in lome lort refemble the feed-veflel of our common plantain. WhenC 457 ] When the flowers fall off, the fruit which is called the cocoa -nut, are in great numbers affixed to the fame branches; they grow to the fize of a boy s head, and are at firft full or a fine pleafant limpid water, which gra dually grows thicker, and at length hardens to a firm nut. The Indians make boats, conftrud the frames of their houfes, and make rafters, of the body of the tree; and by fplitting the centre fibre of the leaf, and weaving the pinnae together, they cover or thatch them alfo, by which they effefhially keep out the wet, even in the rainy feafon. They likewife make mats and bafkets of the leaves fplit lengthways. They cut off a branch, or two, of the flower-ftalk, and hang to the flump of it an earthen pot, in which they colled every day, from half a pint to a quart of Toddy \ this looks like clear whey, and when frefh, being fweet and grate fully acid, is extremely pleafant: if kept, it eafily ferments, and then it is ufed by the baker in fermenting his dough for bread. Good Jrrac is diftilled from this fermenting juice, and alfo that fiery, fingle and fimple diftilled fpirit, called Fool, with which our feamen were too frequently in toxicated. The nut, when thoroughly ripe, is thin, and of a yellowifli colour. The coat or hulk of the Ihell, is compofed of a large quantity of ftrong fibres folded from end to end, and is two or three inches thick. With thefe fibres, after foaking them fome time in water, they make cables and cordage even for their largeft fhips and yarns alfo, which are ufed in the conftrudion of their fhips, boats, houfes, &amp;c. thefe they call Kiar- Tarns, as the firfl is called Kiar-Cables. To attempt to enumerate all the feveral forts of yarns, would be endlefs; it is fufficient to fay, that nails are feldom made ufe of in any of the country people's buildings, and that in their Head ropes and yarns are fubftituted. The fhells of the nut, ferve for bottles, cups, glafTes, lamps, &amp;c. and at laft they make of them lamp black for painting. The contents of the (hell in its firfl; ftage is drank as a pleafant, cool ing, refrefhing beverage; in its riper flate, it is ufed to fatten hogs, eaten as a part of the natives diet, and put as a thickner in all their curries: by heat ing it gently over the fire a large quantity of oil is alfo extracted, with which the natives rub their hair, and fay that it makes it black, and fome- times they make ufe of it in their diet. This oil has no difagreeable fmell or tafle, and I do not doubt, but if procured by expreflion, it would be ex ceedingly good. After breaking the fliells and expofing the kernel for fome time to the fun, they procure a ftill larger quantity of oil, but which is of a coarfer kind than the former •, this they ufe in lamps, and for their common fervices. When the tree is cut by accident, or blown down, the rudiments of the leaves which nature had in ftore for the enfuing year, are found to be of N n n a conic[ 458 ] a conic (hape, and when cut tranfverfely, appear like the folds in a hard cabbage, though not fo thick ; this is brought to the table in thin flices and taftes like young almonds or filberds. B rabu , fo called at Bombay, P almira , on the Coaft j and T all, at Bengal. This grows much in the fame manner as the cocoa-nut tree, though, I think, in general, fomewhat taller. The veftigia of the leaves of former years remain longer on this than on the cocoa-nut tree, and when the tree is 18 or 20 feet high, make it look as if it was covered with fcales.. The fibres of the wood are rigid, as thofe of the cocoa-nut are tough ; the ftalks of the leaves grow out in the fame manner, and arc all as thick at the bale, but they are naked fix feet or more from the bafe. The leaf grows round its own end, like a fan from its centre, and being doubly inferted into the end of the footftalk, it appears open almoft to a circle ; the leaves grow together thus for two thirds of their length, then they feparate, and each duplicate of the leaf goes gradually to a point, which makes each leaf appear like the rays painted round the lun, or the heads ot Romijh faints, fpreading four feet in diameter: but the aggregate ot leaves form a head on the tree, in the fame manner as on the cocoa-nut. 1 he flower ftalk appears like that of the cocoa-nut, but is fomewhat thicker. 1 he fruit is as big as the fruit of that tree, but the hulk is not fo fibrous, and lightly divided into three lobes, in each of which is a fingle fruit, of an oval form, as big as an hen's egg, and when ripe as fubftantial as a chefnut; thefe are eaten by the poor, and the na tives feed hogs with them, but, before they are in a (late of maturity,, there is, as I was told,, a jelly-like fubfbance round the kernel which is eaten particularly by the rich. The body of the tree is converted to the like uies as the cocoa-nut, and is of a ftronger contexture, the Palmira rafters being efteemed fufficiently ftrong for the belt houfes on the CoromandelQ02&amp;. The fiower-ftalk or ftalks are cut for the extradion of Todd}\ in the lame manner as are thofe of the cocoa-nut tree ; the Toddy of the Palmira, is held in dill higher eftimation, than that of the cocoa-nut tree, and from this extracted juice, a fugar is made, which is finer and better than that made from the juice of the lugar-cane. D ate T ree. I his tree grows much in the fame manner, though not fo High, as the two former, only that the veftigia of the leaves of fome former years remain longei on this, than on the other trees, and almoft always give to the tree a Icaly-like appearance : the leaves grow out of the head in the fame manner as they do from the others. 1 he main fibre is full as long as the cocoa nut's* but much fmaller, fince it feldom exceeds two inches in diameter. 1 he l.'dc pinnae are not above four inches long, they are inferted doubly into the bafe.[ 459 ] bafe, where they touch each other, but are far afunder at their points, which are hard: the duplicate of the bafe of the leaves is continued along the main fibre, fo that it appears fomewhat alated. The flower is like the former, but more ramous: the fruit are very numerous, their Ihape almoft every body is acquainted with, and it is well known that they make a great part of the diet ot the inhabitants of Arabia^ and part of Perfta, but not to fo great a degree as Pomet has related. The numerous fruit on the trees in the Peninfula of India are never perfedtly ripe, although the trees are in great abundance there. A rica T ree. This has been fully defcribed in the 184th page of this work. I (hall only add, that it is a fine (lender tree, and grows in much the fame manner as the date, &amp;c. B onana and P lantain T rees. Thefe grow fo much alike, and the fruit only differing in fize, that it is needlefs to make a diftinftion •, they are alfo in many places commonly con founded one with the other. Generally the Bonana fruit is the fmallert, and of a round form, whereas the Plantain is angular; there are of them from three inches in length, and one in diameter, to eight inches long, and two and a quarter diameter, but the larger fort are coarfe. In general, when ripe, they are of a fine yellow colour; yet fome are green, and others of a bright red, efpecially the T* anjourine Plantains, which are held in the higheft eftimation. The Plantain tree is not fo tall as the cocoa-nut or Brahb, and thick pedicles furround each other at their bafe, and continue that appearance to the difbmce of fix, eight, and ten feet, when they fpread, but then the pedicle is contracted, and forms the middle rib of the leaf, which leaf is fix or eight feet long, and 18 inches wide, of a beautiful green colour, and entire, but eafily to be fplitted crofsways ♦, the natives fplit them, in order to make of the leaf, didies and plates for putting their boiled rice upon. (The leaf is alfo ufed for dreffing blifters with, in the Weft Indies.) The flower grows out from the centre of the leaves on a very long ftalk, which is as thick as a large man's wrift, of a deep purple colour, a conic fhape, and about 10 inches in length; when this appears, you fee the fruit furrounding the ftalk in great numbers ; 1500 of great and fmall fruit, have been feen on one ftalk, but not more than 100 in ge neral come to perfection. B anian T ree. -•v Although this tree hath already been taken notice of in page 199, I fhall here prefent to the reader, a more particular defcription of it, N n n 2[ 460 ] This is the Indiarfs facred tree, but they do not, as is commonly fup- pofed, pay adoration to it: the root fpreads a great way ; the bark is a red- di(h brown ; the wood is white and fpungy ; the tree grows to a prodigious height, and its branches fpread a great way. The limbs drop down fibres, which take root, and become another tree, united by its branches to the* firft, and fo continue to do until the many trees cover a great extent of ground : the arches which thoie different ftocks make, are gothic, and as before obferved, fomewhat like thofe we fee in Weftminfter Abbey-, the ftocks not being fingle, but appearing as if compofed of many ftocks, are of a great circumference. There is a certain folemnity accompanying thofe trees; nor do I remember that I was ever under the cover of any of them, but that my mind was at the time imprcficd with a reverential awe ! The leaves are of a bright, fhining green colour, flefhy, oval, and about fix inches long. The fruit is a fig, but of what kind I cannot fay; it was with dif ficulty I faw thofe which grow on that fpecies of the Banian, called the little Banian tree, (mentioned in the marginal note, page 199, whofe fibres had not entered the ground, and formed other trees) on account that the birds eat them almoft as foon as they appear. I know of no quality this tree has in medicine, but have been told, that the dropping fhoots, when young and tender, and boiled in milk with the flower of the cocoa-nut tree, is a cure for a Gonorrhoea. L ittle B anian. This is a very large fpreading tree. I have feen them 20 feet round the ftock, which carried the appearance of being many ftocks clofely united. The outer bark is of a whitifh, the inner is fpungy and of a reddifh brown colour. Shoots drop from the branches, and look as if they were defigned to touch the ground, and take root, in order to form another body, but I never law that they did fo. The leaf is of a deep fhining green above, but very pale below, and highly ribbed on the upper fide •, it emits a milky juice. , The flowers I could never find, but I imagine they are the fame as thofe of the common fig. The fruit is a fig of the fize of a fmall hazel nut, of a pale fiefh colour, fpotted with a deep purple. This tree grows all over India, and was curforily mentioned in my note made at Gom' hroon. P00N T ree. This tree grows very tall and ftrait; the bark is greyifh ; the wood light, but tolerably ftrong; it is frequently ufed for mafts, but unlefs great care is taken to keep the wet from the ends of it, it foon rots. I meafured one of thofe trees in Maham wood on the ifland of Bombay, which though but 14 inches in diameter near the ground, yet was full 50 feet high, and gradually taper.

The flowers which this tree produces, I have not feen. The fruit is in a hard pod, opening in two of its convex fides, fhaped like a pear, but only a little flatted j it is five inches long, of a fine crimfon colour, containing two rows of circular flatted feeds, as big as a boy's marbles, and of a crimfon colour.

This grows to near 30 feet in height, it is full of fhort branches arifino- from the very root. 1 he bark is red, and of an aftringent tafte; the leaves are fhining, and thick like our bay, oval, and about three inches long. The flower has efcaped my notice. The fruit is yellow, of the fize and lhape of a very fmall olive, pulpy, very fweet, and contains a milky juice. The Itone is large for the fize of the fruit, and of a deep brown colour •, the kernel white, and tailing the fmalleft bit of it naufeates the flomach. T ulip T ree , called B endar. The branches of this tree may eafily be cut into a fine thick, fpreading head, and it naturally fpreads a great deal. It is planted by the European gentlemen \n India, for forming their fhady walks. The bark of it is brown, the leaves are pretty large, and undulated, with a long flender point at the end. ' The flowers are like tulips in fhape, though the corolla are not fo flefliy as thofe of the tulip, and are often curled on their upper part: fome are of a yellow, fome of a red colour only, but moft of them are varie gated. The feed-veflel is a round pod, a little pointed, not very hard, and divided lightly into three lobes, which contain a fmall black feed of a cot ton-like fubftance. E uphorbium. On the illand of Ceylon, this tree grows to a tolerable fize, and is to be found in great plenty. The bark is grey, wood white, and pretty firm all the fmaller limbs and branches, which are very numerous, are compofed of triangular, flefhy, folid, deep green fubftances, each about three inches long, affixed to the ends of each other, where they are fmaller than in the middle: at the joints, there come out oppofite to each other, fometimes four very fmall flefhy leaves, and little red fibres, which are all the ap pearances of flower or fruit that I have ever feen. The joints near the ftock of the tree, are much thicker and longer than the others, and fometimes ,near the extremity of the branches, they are a little flatted. The branches fpread a great deal, and the whole and every part of the tree yield a large quantity of a cauftic milky juice, which foon grows tough and ropy like bird lime, clogging up the wound you made in the tree to let it out, and foon hardening to the Gum-Euphorhium of the fhops. I could not find that any[ 4^2 ] of the trees yielded the Euphorhium fpontaneoufly, and ail the gum juice that at any time was found about the Hem of the tree, might eafily be traced as coming from a wound. In all the other parts of India except Ceylon, I never fiw any part of the tree that was woody, but the plant from the very ground was compofed of thofe late mentioned joints. At Bombay, and fome other places, there is a fpecies of it, which the natives plant around their fields and gardens, and which grows three or four feet high j this is of a yellowifh colour, and as thick as a large man's wrill, fquare, but as it were a little twiftedj on the angles grow very numerous iharp fpines, and round thofe fpines very fmalt leaves and flowers, fuch as are between the joints of the fort before de scribed j the juice of this, is of the fame kind as that of the other fort. M ilky H edge. This is rather a Ihrub, which they plant for hedges on the coafl: of Coromandel \ the root of it grows in all diredions, and is woody. In thefe hedges the ftems are not to a great degree woody, but where they are fo, then the bark is grey and cracked, the wood white, and pretty folid. The whole fhrub grows very bufhy, with numerous ered branches, which are compofed of cylindrical joints, as thick as a tobacco pipe, of a green colour, and from three to fix inches long •, the joints are thicker than the other parts, but upon any accidental violence, the plant always breaks firft at thole joints, and then it yields an exceflive cauftic milk, which prevents ,any human being going through the hedge, for it biifters whatever part of the fkin it touches, yet I have feen buffaloes and goats to cat of it. When the joints are broken off at each end, the tube then contains but very little of this milk, with which I once ventured to touch my tongue, and found it a little fweet. At Bombay it grows to the fize of a fmall tree, and the wood is greatly valued there for burning to charcoal for the fineft gunpowder. As to the great medicinal virtues which it is fuppofed to contain, it will be neceffary, in order to convey an idea of them, to relate •the ftory that gave rife .to its' fame. There was in my time a poor Portugueze widow woman, who was the .oldeft female of her family, and had wrought furprifing cures in the moft inveterate venereal diforders, many of which had been pronounced by .all other praditioners, even European phyficians, as incurable ; thefe noto rious fadts had induced the .company's fervants, and particularly their fur- geons, to offer a very confiderable premium to the woman, for a difcovery of her medicine, but Ihe always refufed to comply, affigning for her reafon, that while it was a fecret, it was a certain provifion for the main tenance of the family, as well in the prefent as in future generations. On account of this denial, our furgeons 3 when a particular cafe Jbas been under her management, have been at the cxpence to have her motions with out■ 3 i lOCItSi wild® 1 ' f 4S3 ] cw cbars carefully watched, and as they were not able to difcover that flie ever gathered of any other plant or tree but this thev con^Ic cures!

The root grows perpendicularly, of the Jhape and fize of a carrot touch black without, and white within. The plant is robult, and ftrubby and is p,anted m the Eajl Indian gardens for borders to their partitions, and is cut like our box or quickfet hedges. The flowers are the Belle de nuit of our gardens ; they grow in great numbers on the plant, and are of various colours. The feed remain after the falling off of the flower, naked, flntde and of the fize, colour, fhape, and ftruaure of a large pepper corn' i wice the quantity given by us for a dofe of our Jallap, is required in general of this, but as it grows wild in fome parts ot India, an equal quan- tity ot that wild fort is iufficient.

Thefe circumftances I cannot fay I ever faw^.but received the account from perfons of undoubted credit.

C onissie, Is a fhrub, which grows like a currant bufh on Malabar hill, in Bombay. The roots run horizontal in the ground, and, if broken, emit a little milky juice: the ^bark of the root is a fine bitter, and fomewhat of an aromatic tafte. A decodion of it is given with fuccefs in fluxes. This bark is rougher, and not of fo deep a brown colour, as that which is commonly called at Bombay the ConiJJie-hzxk, at Tellicherry the Congerie-hzxk, and by the late Mr. Swan, Cort de palla \ which is a thin, dark brown bark, with a whitifli mofs on it, a fcruple of which is given every evening as an excellent medicine in confirmed dyfenteric fluxes, as well as in agues, and which is faid to be taken from a large tree, the common fupporter of the pepper about 'Tellicherry, as mentioned in page 191 : the leaves of which tree are oval and indented, and the fruit are like an orange in lhape and colour. Doctor Hill mentions the Malabar ears as the fruit of the tree, from which he fuppofes the Gw/^fo-bark to be taken •, but the bark yielding thole ears has little or no tafte, as will hereafter appear j what it has, is neareft to that of the liquorice root. After all, the indefatigable Mr. Thomas was of opinion, that the Conijfie, which grows on Malabar hill at Bombay, is the very fhrub from which that excellent bark, mentioned in the preceding part of this work, is taken, and he believed that Don Diego the Portuguefe dodlor at Bombay (by whom we uled to be lupplied with it, and as he pretended from Tellicherry) deceived us in the accounts he gave concerning it. Mr. Thomas's words are: ' It grows on Malabar hill, though Diego endeavoured as much as poffible to hide it from you and me, but I once faw fome of the branches of the ihrub with the ufeful bark on it, by accident in his fliop, and afterwards found the fhrub on that hill, the whole of which affords a milky juice. Diego fays, that he gives the Congerie or Tellicherry bark (he chofe not to fay the Conijfie) in intermittents only, and that it anfwers as well as the Jefuits bark j but from experience you and I know that it anfwers alio in old fluxes, and its virtues are well known to every praditioner in India, as well as to many in Europe' C odagi[ 465 ] C odagi P alli , called by Mr. C ort de P alla.

The feed -veflels grow from a fhallow cup on a footftaik of three inches; they are double,^ inches long, green fmooth, and as thick as a fwan's quill: when ripe thev are black, and longitudinally furrowed, fometimes forming nearly a circle fome times an elhpfis, at other times they are nearly parallel, but always touching at their ends, and at their ends only. From their fliape they are called lahar-ears, an account of the refemblance they bear to the ears of the women on the Malabar coaft, which from the large flit made in them and the great weight ot ornamental rings put into them, are rendered very laroe and fo long as that they lometimes touch the very fhoulders. Thcfe veffeis have brown leeds, of the fliape of our oats, contained in a fine fibrous filky fub- kance of a pale colour. I could not find that the bark is at all ufed and what Dr. Hill, and the author, have before called Codagi Pallis, is the'bark ot a large timber-tree with indented leaves, on xht Malabar coaft, commonly named the Congerte bark. The feeds however are ufed as carminatives and on the coalt of Malabar are highly valued for their medicinal virtue in the cure ot fluxes, for which end they chew a few of them mornincr and evening. 43 B E e t l e, This is a volubilis, and is fupported on flicks, like French beans, and runs 12 feet high ; the leat is flefhy, and of a pleafant green •, its ufes have been related-in p. 184 and elfewhere, T a ma rind. This tree is very large, and has been well defcribed by Dr. Hill M ussendell. The root is fibrous, perpendicular and woody. The ftalks grow double from the root, are woody and tough, with a thin brown bark over the green; the leaves grow in pairs, are foft, of a bright green, whitifli above, and hoary below: the flowers grow on umbels in the ake of the leaves near the top of the branches.

This grows only in Ceylon •, it will increafe to a very large tree, but when the bark is of no ufe (as it grows very thick and Tpungy) except when they diftil it for its oil, or for cordial waters, of which laft the Dutch have great variety, and very fine. The bark of the branches is the firft year of an elegant green, and almoft tranfparent. The fecond year it is brown; the third, they take it oft for cinnamon. That the root of an old tree pro duces camphire, has already been noticed. The natives make an oil from the fruit, which fruit is hard, and has the appearance of old caftile foap, and when fcraped yields an agreeable fragrancy. The Dutch are very careful that no cinnamon or oil be carried from the ifland by foreigners, and cinnamon fells in any Dutch fettlement in India for two dollars per lb, G lantigura or G ocrow. This is a handfome plant, grows 16 inches high, the root ftrikes perpen dicular into the ground, is yellow, and throws off fome loofe fibres; the ftalk is fingle, ered: and fucculent, but foon divides and fubdivides into a number of branches which are alio green and fucculent. The leaves are of a pale but pleafant green, fomewhat thick. The flowers are yellow, and campaniform ; they grow in the alas of the leaves, and at the divifion of the branches; the fruit is only a hufk, which contains one ftellated feed, whofe points are very fharp, and when dry it falls into feveral pieces, each having two fpines; the make of the hulk is adapted to the fhape of the feed. A fmall branch of this plant, when trefh, dipped two or three times into a bafon of water, changes the water to the confiftence of the white of an egg, changes milk to the thicknefs of rich cream, and gives to both a very agreeable fmeil and tafte. Half a pint of this cream drank every morn ing, in the comic ot 10 days, as I, and Mr. Thomas too, experienced in our praflice, often cured a Gonorrhoea without the aid of any other medi cine ; the firfl: account we received of the virtues of this plant was from Dr. Diego^ whole name has already occurred. Mr. Thomas, in a letter he favoured me with foon after his arrival in England from India, wrote thus; ' The mucilage plant, you well remem ber we luccefsfully tryed in Gonorrhoeas, dipped in milk agreeable to Diego's diredions, as well as with fome advantage for dilbrders in the breaft. I mufl now inform you, that the Indians ule it to purify their foul water. On the coaft of Coromandel, where it grows in great abundance, they call it Glantigugla or Grantigugra, At Bombay Dr. Diego called the feeds Koufette, and laid he gave a decodion of them to promote fpitting in a fali- 5 vation. to my mi: under mj kk fro of the vii mifed cu plant in 1 than thre' afterward Is a lat three tog( bright gn This gi Is a ve as an aftri: This s from one They, cathartic.

This is a tree which grows like the lemon-tree, the fruit is alfo of that kind, grows as large as a man's head, and is round ; it is a fine pleafant fruit, is eaten at our tables, and reckoned as wholefome a fruit as any in India: there are plenty of them at Ceylon and other places, and they com monly are called pumple or pimple-nofes. CoLOCYNTH. This is well defcribed by Dr. Hill, I have feen them at Fort St. 'David fpread full twenty yards in diameter; they lie clofe to the ground, and gene rally fill the whole fpace of ground they run over, forming an almoft perfed circle. The Cathartic quality of this plant is too well known to need a defcription. B o n N e e. This is a robuft fhrubby plant, grows to two feet in height, and ramous. The root goes perpendicularly into the ground, and is as thick as a Iwan's quill, but divides below. The leaves on the branches are pretty numerous. The flowers are of a fine purple like our pea-flower. The root powdered and mixed with pepper, is given by way of fnufF to clear the head when Huffed. God's Pipull. This is a fhrub which grows four feet high ; its root, which is an inch in diameter, is of the tap kind, of a reddifh brown on the outfide, and white within. The leaf is of a bright green. The root bruiled, and applied as a cataplafm, the natives fay, will cure pained limbs. Maccumseem. The root, which grows like the liquorice, is as thick as a man's finger, fibrous, in colour fomewhat grey, but tinged yellow. The ftalk is round andr 469,] and green. It grows to a confiderable height, but the ftalk is fo flender that it is not able to fupport itfelf. The leaves grow three together on mo derately long pedicles ; they are of a deep green colour above, but paler below. The flowers I have not leen. The fruit is a pod, of the fhape of that of the pea, about five inches long, and two wide. The feeds are enclofed in a double membrane, are of an oval fhape, a little flatted and half an inch long. The juice of the root is given in a dropfy. R acalcurry. This has a tap root, which neverthelefs throws off many fibres that are nearly as large as itfelf, but not much bigger than pack-thread. The ftalk grows iS inches high, but is procumbent; it has five deep furrows running along all its length-, the ftalk, which is of a green colour, throws out many branches. Leaves of different fhapes, grow from the branches on pedicles of four inches. At every joint of the main ftalk are two fmall cordatcd leaves furrounding it by their bafe, and, as the joints are near each other, thefe appear like fquamms. The flower is a fmall bilabeated corolla; I could find no (lamina : the ftyle is pyramidal, with many fine fibres on the top of it. The fruit is a pod about three inches long, as thick as a crow's quill, and ftrait, containing about ten black feeds •, three of thefe pods grow from the top of every branch. The juice of this plant given with honey, is efteemed to be a great cooler. H arrijose. The root is fibrous; the plant is compofed of a number of fqu^re hollow joints four inches long and ^ of an inch wide, of a deep green colour; it feeks fupport from bufhes and trees, and grows pretty long, and is much divided. When near the ground it throws out roots at its joints, and emits a milky juice. At every joint is one leaf, (on fhort, fucculent, and bright green petioles) and a flower. The flowers are red, and umbelliferous, but 1 have not feen them perfed. The whole plant is uied as a repellent and difiblvent. A cknok. The root grows perpendicularly, and is of the thicknefs of a crow-quill. The plant is a creeper, which throws out roots at its joints, and runs up trees, &amp;c. to the height of 12 or 14 feet. The leaves are of a deep green, grow regularly at four inches diftance from one another. The juice of the plant is given with pepper for the cure of an anafarcous fweHing; one table fpoonfui and half is eileemed to be a fufficient quantity for a purging dofe. L ajut.ee. This is a pretty little plant with a perpendicular root as thick as a fmall pack-thread, but which divides. The ilalk is naked for about two inches, 7 redddh[ 47° ] reddifii at bottom, but woolly above, where it forms a kind of head, and throws out above twenty ere&lt;5l fibres four inches long, round, red,' and woolly : on two thirds of the outer ones are the leaves, of a fine green colour. On the top of the remaining third part of the fibres are the flowers, five on each, the calyx is green, corolla yellow. The root is powdered and applied to wounds. K aoon. 1 he root is tuberous and like ginger: the (lalk grows upwards five feet, and is 4 of an inch in diameter, of a brownifh green colour, jointed regu larly at the diftance of three inches.

The leaves are of a lio-ht green, fiefhy, and grow but thinly on the plant. The root is powdered and ufed in foul ulcers ; but its moft excellent quality is, that if a piece of it is held in the hand, it will drive the covra capella fnakes away from you in great hafte, as they will not come near the place where the root is. D urka J omp. The root is black, fmall, contorted and tuberous, thickly fet with nume rous black rigid fibres. From each branch of the root grow fingle, hard, fquare, black fhining ftalks, naked about a foot from the ground, then at every three inches diftance grow, in pairs, the leaves; it rifes to two feet. The feeds, I think, are round the margin of the leaf. D urka J omp, 2d. The root confifis of a number of very fine, fmall, black fibres; from thefe grow feveral fine black fhining ftalks, 10 or 12 inches high, as thick as a pack-thread at bottom, but gradually IcITening upwards.

The root is compofed of a number of fmall black rigid fibres from a kind of head, from which alfo grows the ftalk; this ftaik is perfectly round, woody and ftrait, and grows to 14 inches in height; on the top, it is divided into two branches, and thofe again into two others, on the top of which branches are the leaves, which are of a pleafant green colour. The three jaft plants are reckoned to be great pedorals. bhawlpon. This grows from the ground three feet, but not quite eredl. The root is fmall and fibrous yet perpendicular. The leaves grow alternately and are of[ 47 2 3 of a pale green. The flower I have not feen. The parts where the fruit are produced are above the leaves. This, and half a dozen more cooling plants are made into a deco&lt;flion, and given in India as their greateft febr£ fuge. sutta mullie. The roots are very numerous; they hang from the bafe of the plant by thin fibres, which gradually^enlarge to the fize of a man's finger, then taper gradually to a point, they are about eight inches long, white and fucculent, eafily dividing lengthways. There is alfo amongft them, here and there, a fmall fibre which runs off to a confiderable diftance, and from this grow frefti bundles of roots which fend up plants. The ftalks are of the fize of a Iwan's quill, woody and fpinous, and fome of them grow 12 feet high, then come branches which are very like the afparagus, but fpinous, and are an inch afunder. Indeed the firft fhoots from the ground, which are alfo fpinous, bear likewife fome refemblance to the afparagus. The quantity of roots which was brought to me, and was the produce of 6ne original plant, would more than fill a peck meafure. The juice of the root is given in Gonorrhoeas, Nawpetkee. This is a beautiful little creeper, and fpreads a good deal. The flower and fruit anfwer the charader of Dr. HilVs Cordiofpermum, only that the feed is a beautiful blue. Bale Tree. This grows to a large tree and is fpinous: under each fpine grow the leaves, which are of a pale green. It bears fruit, fome of which are as big as a boy's head; when ripe they are of a greenilh yellow ; the (kin is very thin, and Imells like a citron, under which is a hard woody fhell 4- ani inch thick, full of a fine pulp, of an high flavour, and which is elteemed to be very nutritive •, in this are very bitter feeds covered with a fine balfamic fubftance, of the colour and confiftence of Venice turpentine. The whole when dry is red and granulated, and given on the Coromandel coaft in the jaft ftage of a fever, and is called Billapatree. D oomar. This is a fmall tree, or rather flirub, growing in hedges, or out of walls; the bark is grey and rough. 1. he leaves are of a pale green ; the upper part of the leaf is paler than the under part, the latter is very harfh and rough. The fruit is a yellow fig of the fize of our fig in Europe. It grows all over India^ and on the coaft of Malabar they ule the leaf to polifh their Black-wood. S car-[ 473 1 Scarlet Fig. This is a very fpreading tree, the branches generally growing in a cir cular manner as if cut by art, the under part of the limbs making almoft a plane at the diftance of 10 or 12 feet from the ground, affording fine Ihelter for the cattle •, the upper part is convex, and of a confiderable height. The femidiameter of one near Calcutta in Bengal is full 20 yards. The bark is brown, the fkin next it, and alfo the wood, is of a bright reddifh brown. All the figs from their limbs drop fhoots which take root. The leaf is of a fine deep ihining green above, but fomewhat paler below. It flowers as the other figs do; the fruit is a fine fcarlet fig, whofe diameter is an inch. Coddam. This is a large timber-tree which grows to 40 feet in height; the root fpreads much. The bark is grey, and much cracked \ the wood is of a pale yellow, and clofe grained. The leaves are of a fine green colour and elegantly ribbed, they grow in pairs. The flower grows at the end of the branches, it is round and of the fize of a tennis-ball, and almoft as hard, exceptino- the ftyle, which is much longer than the cup, and being perfe6lly white^ ftanding out of it, makes it look as if it was larded: the furface of the ball is made up of fine yellow monopetalous cups, 4 of an inch lono-, divided into five parts for a third of their length j and their five (lamina are fhorter than the cups. Stigma are oval; thele are fo very clofe together as to make it of the hardnefs above-mentioned ; within this, of the fame length, is another feries of white flowers : the reft is a fibrous white fluff, without any appearance of feed ; the flower is fixed to a long and (lender peduncle. This tree is planted for ornament and fhade, on the fides of the walks at Bengal. Singo , on the Malabar coafl; Morunga , on the Coromandel. This tree grows up to 20 feet, and fpreads a great deal. The bark is nearly white, the fkin that is next to it, reddifh j the wood is whitifh and fpungy. The leaves are of a pale green, very tender, and pinnated farther than Dr. Hill defcribes them to be, but I think what he calls the ramofe leaf of the Ben, comes neareft to a true defcription. The flowers are white, and grow on large fpikes almoft covering the tree, yielding a beautiful appearance. The fruit is a long triangular pod, which contains in its cavities hard, angular, alated nuts, and which I apprehend to be the Ben nuts. The root of this tree is ufed as horfe-radiih, and taftes very much like it. The leaves mixed with a little fait, and taken after a furfeit, vomit fmartly. The fruit when green the Indians eat in their curries, and fo they do the flowers. The tree affords areddifh gum, in fhape and quality like gumTra- gacanth. Query, if the wood be not the Lignum Nephriticum ? It grows all over India. P p p Jack[ 474 ] Jack.

The flowers grow out of the ftock and large branches on (hort foot-ftalks • they are white, very flefliy, and fhaped like a tulip. The fruit is lame', rough, and of an oblong figure, containing three feries of feeds, which are about the fize of a bergamote pear within thefe, is a large kernel which fills the Jack to within a third of an inch of its diameter j the coat of this is what is eaten, and which is extremely fweet and lufcious; it feels in the mouth like preferved citron, though fomewhat tougher and harder. Some of thefe capfules weigh more than 20 pounds. The tree grows in every country in India^ but the Butch are more fond of the fruit than any other of the Europeans. C hulta. An elegant flower tree. It grows near Surman's bridge in Bengal^ and has been fully defcribed in p. 184. W hite C hampowe. This is a fmall tree, but it fpreads much ; the flowers appear firfl: round the ends of the branches, and are of the fhape and fmell of a jonquil, but of a white colour; after the flower, the leaves come out in the fame manner round the ends of the branches, but no where elfe, fo that on the outfide, the tree looks well covered, but if you look from under, it is a ihell: when the leaves are off it appears like a tree divefted of all its fmall branches, there being none that are lefs than an inch in diameter, nor are there many of thefe. The wood is fpungy ; the bark fmooth and brown, it fmells very fweet. This tree grows all over India. Y ellow C hampowe. This is the Michilia of Dodor Hill, and by him has been well dcfcribed.

This grows in fome places very tall even to 50 or 60 feet, and where it does not fhoot high it fpreads much. The branches are horizontal, and the leaves grow round their ends, and are of a bright green colour. The flowers are ftaminous, growing round the end of the branches among the leaves. The fruit are like almonds, and alfo are contained in hufks, the infide of which are red, and of an acid tafte. The kernel taftes like a young almond, and is compofed of fine clofely-compaded fcales. C ustard A pple. This grows as large as our apple tree. The bark is brown and fmooth. ' The leaves are of a deep green colour, deeply furrowed, and highly ridged ; they grow alternately on the branches. The flowers are monopetalous and cup-like, having many ftamina. The fruit is like the cone of a pine, of a foft green colour, but white infide, having many oblong feeds intermixed with its pulp, the latter tailing very much like a rich cuftard. There is another fort of this kind of fruit which is fomewhat fweeter than this, but grows altogether in the like manner. Atlas. This is a very large and ftrong tree, with leaves confiderably large, which are of a pale dirty green colour. The flowers grow on fpikes greatly ramified, and look well on the tree; on each fubdivifion of the fpike is a flower, whofe calyx is Ample and green; the corolla is a white monopeta lous cup with four fmall hooked filaments. The fruit is a hard green ball, as large as a cricket ball, inclofing two hard feeds of the fliape and lize of nutmegs.

The leaves are fmall, of a bright green, growing on a fingle petiole longer or fhorter in proportion to the fize of the leaf. The flowers grow in pyra midal fpikes on the top and large branches of the plant, and after they drop off the fruit remains, which are prickly green capfules divided into three lobes, each of which contains an oblong feed about half an inch in length; the hulk is of a purple colour ftreaked with white. The kernel is white and oleous, and the Indians make ufe of its oil for burning in their lamps; they alfo give it to their children in the earlieft ftate of infancy, looking upon it to be the moft lenient and innocent of all other laxative medicines.

This grows to the fize of our largeft plum-tree, and is a good deal like it. The leaves are of a pale dirty green, almoft white below, where it is alio fomewhat hairy. - The tree has many fpikes. The flowers are fingle. The fruit a plum of the fize and fhape of a yellow bullace, but cats more like an apple than like a plum. It grows in every part of India. G um A rabic. Some of thefe grow to large trees. The bark is brown without, but reddilh within, and yields a great quantity of gum. There are three forts of thefe trees, all of which are full of fharp fpines, and the leaves are altogether al ke, except that fome may be a little longer than others. The flowers grow on foot-flalks from two to five inches long, are round, yellow, and of a fine fmell, and refemble the tufts on the hangings of old- fafhioned beds. The fruit are not all alike; the ift fort, or thofe which grow on the Ihorteft peduncles, are oblong, round, black pods of the fhape of that of a pea, three inches long, and of the fize of a man's little finger, each containing five or fix round, dark brown feeds. 2d fort grows on fomewhat longer peduncles from different parts of the branches like the former, and the fruit is an oblong flatted pod, in length three or four inches, and half as broad, containing five or fix dark brown flatted feeds, with the impreffion of a heart, or rather of the letter V on each fide of them. On the 3d fort, the flower grows on fpikes at the end of the branches, and the fruit is a flat pod full 12 inches long, appearing like a ftring of buttons, and contains 10 or 12 round flatted feeds, convex on each fide; the pods are of a whitifh hoary green, very gummy, and hang on the fpikes in clufters. With thefe pods, and the fruit they call Packekaile, the Indians tan and dye their leather. L ien C auta. This is a moderately large fpreading tree. The bark is of a bright brown, and fmooth. The branches are full of fliort fpines. The leaves a pale green. Flowefs,[ 478 ] Flowers, which are very fmall, grow on fpikes like an amentum or the hazel catkins, but longer: the calyx is green.

This tree grows very large, and fpreads much. The bark is whitilh, and full of ftrong ftiort fpines. The wood is white and fpungy •, when the tree is young, it has a beautiful appearance, the limbs then growing horizon tally, bow down, and around the body of the tree ; at five feet above thefe, there is another circular row of branches of lefs extent, and in this man ner they proceed on to the top, fo that the tree appears at a diftance like a pyramid. The campanulated flower however appears before the leaves, and is as large as a tulip: its calyx is fingle, green, and flefhy •, corolla is compofed of five oblong thick petals, which are of a deep crimfon colour: the ftamina arc 15 fubalated filaments, attached to each other in five bundles, and thefe again to the petals of the corolla. The fruit is a pod, of the fhape of a fhort cucumber, divided in three feveral parts, containing fome roundifh black feeds, involved in a filky cotton-like matter. After thefe, come the leaves, which are of a pale green colour *, by the time that thefe are all out, the pods fplit longitudinally in three places, and then the cotton foon efcapes, and is carried to all places with the wind. Of that lubftance which adheres to the feeds, they make mattrefies, pillows, &amp;c. And a decoflion of the leaves, will cure in the laft ftage of a dyfenteric flux, attended with a prolapfus aniy and other fatal fymptoms, as hath been experienced by Mr. ^homas^ when deprived of all other hopes of laving the patient. M ergoosa , or N un. It grows to the fize of our large apple trees. The bark is brown, and rough, yielding a gum of the flavour of garlic. The wood is brown. The pinnae grow very thick about the limbs and branches, and becaufe the trees make a good fhade, they are planted in the ftreets and walks at Cuddalore and Madrafs, on the Coromandel coaft. The leaves are of a deep green, the flowers grow on fpikes, and are numerous. The fruit, when ripe, is yellow, half an inch long, and of the fhape of an olive cut off at its end ; thefe are very foft, and almofl infipid : they grow in thick bunches, and contain a fmall oblong hard kernel, of which they make a very milmsm \ [ 479 ] very bitter oil, and give it to cure many diforders, particularly thofe of the venereal kind. They rub it alfo into the joints of people ftruck with the Berhiers. They mix the pulp of the ripe fruit, as I have been informed, with their cream, in order to increafe the quantity of their butter for the markets. P hysic -N ut. This grows eight or ten feet from the ground. The bark is brown. The wood fpungy ; when there are no leaves on it, the tree looks like feveral bundles of blunt fticks (tuck into the ground, and I believe is what Pomet has taken his draught of the Gamboge plant from. The leaves grow thick on every part; they are undulated, and of a pale green. The flowers grow on fpikes, on the top of the branches. The fruit is in bunches, of the fize of apricots, and as it ripens looks like them j when quite ripe, it is a black roundifh pod, dividing into three parts, and containing three oblong feeds, with a black hufk. The kernel is white, and divides like an almond^ between the divifions, is a fine membraneous fubftance, in which lies its violent emetic, and cathartic quality i for when that is taken away, the kernel is as innocent and pleafant as an almond.—Every part of this plant yields a greyifh or milky juice, which will fo feparate the globules of quick- lilver, that it is not eafy to make them unite again. soonatulla. This grows to a pretty large tree. The leaves are of a bright green colour, grow on very long ftalks, and look like thofe of green elders they are triplicately pinnated, and on each pinna are three pair and one odd leaf. The flower is a club on a long peduncle, bearing a number of large purple campaniform monopetalous flowers. The feed-veffel is a large flat pod, four feet long, and five inches wide, but not quite an inch thick, and which very often grows fingle on the top of all the branches of the tree, when it gives the appearance of a fcythe •, this divides longi tudinally on its edges, Emd contains a great number of very fine, thin, white, membraneous fept^, about two inches wide, among which are nu merous feeds inclofed in the fame membraneous coverings ; the feeds are flat and brown, of the fhape of two kidneys united by their concave fides, each lobe being feparate.

The root is of the fize and colour of that of the Gentian, but is contorted, and throws out many fibres •, from the root and fibres, three or four {talks are produced, which are robuft, erefl, and fometimes ramofe. The leaves grow three at a joint by pedicles, which are half an inch long ; they are of a pale green, fomewhat flefhy, and of a lanceolated fhape. It flowers like the honey- fuckle, but is not fo abounding in flowers as that is on the head. D oolacur. This is a tolerable fized tree. The bark is brown on the outfide, then a whitifli colour appears, but yellow within. The leaves grow two or three from one foot-ftalk, they are of a light green, oblong and pointed. The fruit is a green hulk with a (hell, inclofing a large kernel. The bark of this tree when powdered, is given in rheumatifms. CONTA CoCHU. This plant grows in mud-ditches. The root is an inch and quarter in circumference, running with the fame thicknefs a long way into the mud, throwing out fome fibres, and has at irregular diftances, Ibme rough an nular prominences, which are green within, and white without. The ftalks are numerous, and of the fize of a man's finger; round, green, fucculent, and three or four feet in length : on the top of each ftalk, there is either a leaf or feed. The leaf is 16 inches wide, divided to the ftalk in feven places, and fome of thofe are ftill further divided, in two or three other places: the leaf is rough, and ferrated. The whole root, flock, and ftalks of the plant are fpinous. The flower is four inches long, and two thick, and grows round the upper part of the ftalks, like the Indian corn. P aw P aw.

The flowers grow on a thick fpike, from the als of the pinns, and are of a fine yellow: the calyx is a fine yellow rounded perian- thum, and the leaves are affixed to the peduncle by a (hort (lender unguis • the corolla is compofed of fix round concave petals, of half an inch broad, whofe ungues are alfo very ftiort and (lender. The flower confifts of ten fhort and flender ftamina, whofe antherse are double, and coronated j two of the ftamina are larger than the others, whofe antherse are not only double, but of a femicircular form, and nearly one third of an inch in length ; another of the ten ftamina, is longer and thicker than all the reft, but its anthers differs not from the fmall ones. The ftyle is fhort; the ftigma triangular, and near an inch long. The leaves, when pounded, the natives apply by way of a cataplafm to the ringworm (which is a very troublefome and common diforder in the Eaft Indies) ; it makes a hard cruft over the affeded part, and whenever any of this cruft breaks, they lay on more of the pounded leaves, and continue fo to do until the whole cruft falls off, not negledling to give at proper intervals cathartic medicines.

It is truth, that wonderful cures to perfons labouring under flow nervous fevers have been wrought by this cucumber whofe excellency doth not meerly confift in its emetic, and purgative oua- hties, but is alfo indifputably fraught with ftomachic and reftorative virtues: it is alfo a gentle fudorific, and the feeds are efteemed as a power ful vermifuge; 30 drops of a tinfture made of the fibrous cells infufed in French brandy, and taken in a glafs of Madeira wine before dinner, feldom fail, to cure the moft violent pain of the ftomach, which Mr. Thomas often experienced. The virtues of this plant feemed to be totally unknown to our brethren of the faculty in India-) until Mr. Thomas (who refided with me at the- hofpital) was informed of them by the black doflors of the country that we employed for colleding of fimples, and of whom we endeavoured to get all the information we could relative to botany and the phyfical pradlice of the country. - To me, this gentleman foon imparted his intelligence, and after repeated and'iatisfaftopy trials had been made, I collected a confider- able number of the dried cucumbers, and made ufe of them with ^reat fuccefs, as well in my, private, as in the hofpital praftice.

This grows on the fides of watery places, is often planted for hedges, and anfwers the purpofe exceedingly well, it being thick, clofe, and full of fpines. The root runs a great way under the furface of the ground ; the branches of it, which are from half an inch to three or four inches in diame ter, continue to be of the fame thicknefs for a long way; thefe are hard, but not woody, of a greenifli colour without, and white within. The plant grows in the fame manner as other pines do, but the old leaves of this are Tome what longer than thofe of the other, and at the fame time fpinous; as thefe drop off, there is a kind of (lock remaining which is five or fix inches in diameter, and not unlike the Bamboo \ and whenever thefe have been fuf- fered to remain uncut for any length of time, if you lift upward the outer leaves, you will fee a number of thofe ftocks, or ftems, and a large cavity in the middle ot them, which is always proportionally correfponding to the height of the hedge, as there are no leaves but what are near the furface of the hedge. At Madrafs you fee a remarkable high hedge of this kind, (originally planted for limiting to the northward the boundaries of that fet- tlement,) which is nearly 20 feet high, and hollow enough for fheltering many hundred men, but their general height is no more than five or fix feet. The flower is an ered fpike, very thick and foft, of a brown colour, and like our grafles it grows in a double ftrong and flefliy fpatha, yielding a fweet and highly perfumed odour j and which, if dried and put amongft linen clothes, will prevent their being injured by the ant, or any other deftroying infe&lt;5l or vermin.

It would be endlefs to attempt a defcription of the number and forts which India produces of the creeper and volubilis kind, and that are by the Europeans and natives ufed in their curries, and foups; there are of them, whofe fruit are from the fize of a bufhel meafure to that of the gooleberry and of every fhape, fuch as round, oval, oblong, angular, &amp;c. There is alfo a great variety of the bean kind, too tedious to mention here •, but the one which they call Try, I cannot pafs over: it is highly efteemed when ftewed, .by the Europeans, and when ripe and dry, carries with it the appearance of the JVild Cucumber, and is, as I was told, like that, of an emetic qua lity. Whether it is the fame, has been a matter of difpute; however, by comparing the defcription already given of the Teetpulia, wich the few particulars which follow relating to this, the reader will foon difcover how miftaken thofe are who fuppofe them to be the fame. This fruit when dry, is highly ridged, with five or fix large fibres running its whole length, and without a piltil; neither are the fibres fo diftin&lt;5t as in the other, but are plufFy, as if beaten.

An Account of the Diseases incident to Gombroon, contained in a letter from an ingenious phyfician who relided feveral years in that fettlement. DURING my abode at Gom&amp;roon, autumnal and vernal Intermittents raged in as various forms, as have ever been remarked in the defcrip- tions given of thefe difeafes by medical authors. The moft fimple of them often continued to harrafs the patient for a confiderable length of time. Others were quite anomalous, the paroxyfms frequently redoubling, and that not always in a regular order •, which plainly evinced the malignity of their nature. I have known a regular autumnal 'Tertian (which never doubled the paroxyfm, except upon Tome cafual indifcretion of the patient), lb obftinate as to continue twelve or thirteen months, and at length to occa- fion indurations in the fpleen, liver, &amp;c. The obftinacy of thefe difeafes, and the bad confequences arifing from them, do, I believe, but feldom occur in other countries, and here, were by no means occafioned by bleeding, or other improper evacuations. Even when by the irregularities of the patient the fits were anticipated, or re doubled, the fever quickly aflumed its firft type, and fo went on until the patient's want of ftrength and the dread of worfe confequences, obliged me to put a flop to its career by the bark. A repetition of the fame medicine afterwards, at intervals, according to Sydenham's method, did not always prove fuccefsful. Otberpfr eimici^' f 499 ] Other Intermittents, were of a more malignant nature, and attended with fuch complicated and redoubled fits, as fometimes to terminate in a con tinual fever of the worft kind, to the great danger and often the deftrudion of the patient. Continual Putrid Fevers^ appeared as the fun approached the winter, or fummer folftice, but were by no means fo freqjient as to defervc the name of epidemics. Bafltird Peripneutnonies^ alfo occurred from the middle of Ottoher to the middle of November, and might in fome years be obferved even in the fucceeding months to the end of February. But the various fpecies of Intermitting Fevers already mentioned, were, at leaft while I was there, the moft prevailing dilbrders at Gombroon. The Quotidians, during the firft days, by reafon of their obfeure inter- miffion, were fomewhat difficult to be diftinguifhed from the reft: but by attending to the attack of the firft cold fit, and the progrefs of the other fubfequent fymptoms, the cafe may be known. The chilnefs in the begin ning of this fever commences in the extreme parts of the body, fuch as at the tip of the nofe, and the ends of the fingers, or toes: it never feizes with an univerfal rigor, or in all or moft of the mufcular parts of the body at once, as in the beginning of many Continual Fevers ; neither does it rife to fo great a degree as in a 'Tertian. The cold fit is often very flight at Gom broon, and I believe in moft hot climates. Towards the end of the cold fit, a pituitous vomiting, with great drowfinefs, often attacks the patient, and foon after, the pulfe becomes quicker, having an undulating motion, but not fo ftrong in its vibrations as in a Tertian, nor attended with that tenfity and hardnefs as in acute Inflammatory Fevers: neither does the patient com plain much of thirft, but is on the contrary frequently troubled with watery and frothy fpittings. Moreover, the heat of the body during the increafe or ftate, is accompanied with a moifture, and is very moderate when com pared with the heat attendant on conrhnuaX Ivflammatory Fevers, ox Tertian Intermit tents, in the fame ftate. If the face continues for any time pale, livid, and as it were a little bloated, with tenfe Hypochondria, danger is portended. The patient in the firft days hath feldom any truly critical fweat; nor are the intermiflions for the moft part perceptible. However, in five or fix days thefe Fevers moft commonly fhow their nature more plainly, by Inter- tniffions of fix or eight hours continuance, and, what I have not elfewherc obferved of fuch Quotidians, they in about a fortnight afterwards terminate in Tertians. This Fever will by no means bear a hot regimen; by this it will foon be thanged into a Continual Putrid, and more dangerous Fever. A cold regimen is alfo a dangerous extreme. At Gombroon, if I may be allowed the expreflion, it is of a phlegmatic arpituitous nature, in which a mean courfe between the two exceiTes of either of thefe regimens, is to bq followed. S f f 2 On1 i m [ 500 ] On its firft attack, I ufually gave a vomit, either of Ipecacuanha, or Salt of Vitriol, adding to the former a grain or two of Tartar Emetic, or two drachms of Vinum Benediftum for robuft habits. Bleeding is feldom requifite in this fever the pulfe, joined with the ftate of other fymptoms, muft alone determine the expediency of that operation. The conftitution, fo far as I could find, in Gombroon, will not bear too fmart, nor too great evacua tions of any kind. For common drink, I ordered fack-whey, fao-e-tea or orange-whey ; and gave often fome grains of Sal Prunella mixed with them fo as that the patient might take about the quantity of a drachm and a half of it in the fpace of twenty-four hours. I directed panado, and water-gruel, for their food, allowing fome fpoonfuls of rhenifli, old hock, or other white wines, to be given when the fever was almoft on the decline. I have fome- times, to ungovernable patients, allowed chicken broth, but cannot approve of flefh nutriment, even of the lightefl fort, efpecially in the firft days of a fever of any kind, as more eafily tending to putrefadion than the farinace ous aliment. Sage, or other tea, I frequently allowed as a change of drink; but I found the fack-whey infinitely preferable, as fupporting the fpirits better, and alio affording fome nourifhment, which the teas did not. Sweats forced by art in the beginning of thefe fevers, as well as in moft others, pervert the intentions of nature, and render the difeafe more malig nant and irregular; but when occafioned by gently diluting and refolving medicines, they either bring the Fever fooner to an Inter million, or by gradually refolving and eliminating the morbific matter, reftore the patient to health. In cafe the bowels are much conftipated, a clyfter of milk, oil and lugar, with two drachms of lenitive eleduary diflblved in it, may be adminiftered ; but in moft cafes at the beginning of Quotidians, the ftools are crude and watery, and an emetic will ufually procure as much evacua tion as is necefiary this way. Where the drowfinefs was fo exceffive as to threaten a Coma, and the languor of the pulfe required the application of a blifter, I have found benefit from applying it, but great care is to be taken, ieil fo powerful a Jiimulus Ihould throw the patient into a Continual Fever', and indeed, although Quotidians are very troublefome, and often dangerous, as I leldom had occafion to lower the Fever with the lancet, fo neither have 1 been often obliged to raife the pulfe by the application of vefica- tories. Such by a prudent treatment, without running into any ex tremes, will often in a few days grant fome hours truce daily to the patient, .ind provided his conilitution holds out, may in a fortnight afterwards, form themfelves into regular ertians. But where I have been apprehenfive of the patient's fuccumbing under the fever before fuch a wiihed-for change, I have then taken the opportunity of the fmall intermifllons, to give the bark, with as much cau tion and prudence as 1 was mafter of. You are fenfible, no particular advice in fuch a cafe can be given ; this muft be left entirely to the judgment 01 t^e phyfician or lurgeon who has attended the patient through the whole courfe courfe 0 third, 01 tunity, . approacl tlian th( Attbt ounce, ai failed to beenfoir fafety wh p youi tailed me watery ft( ever I foi don of tt Man. fome days in this fh ing the 11 ardent, ai fit too is always to ^ry natui pragnoftic 'er, the to the torn timls.

I have however obferved, that on the firft, fccond, third, or fourth perfect Intermiffion, if I had a mind to embrace that oppor tunity, I could always exhibit at leaft two drachms of the bark before the approach of the next fit, which I indeed obferved to be fomewhat higher than the preceding one, but without danger. At the next Intermiffion I could generally make the patient take half an ounce, and on the third, fix drachms, or thereabouts which pradice never tailed to drive off the Fever, or change its type to a Tertian: nay, I have been fometimes forced to lay hold of Remiffions, and it is to be done with lafety when one is lure of the nature of the Fever. Sometimes you will gam your point in twice giving your bark as above-mentioned, thrice never tailed me. In Quotidians I almoft always obferved that the bark occafioned watery ftools, but never durft venture to check them by opiates; how ever I found by experience that notwithftanding the ftools, a third exhibi tion of the bark feldom failed of luccefs. 'Tertians at Gombroon, as well vernal as autumnal, frequently imitate for fome days the genius of Continual Fevers. They may be diftinguifjhed even in this Itate from the other fpecies of Intermit tents, in that the pulfe, dur ing the ftate of the Fever, is more full, and ftrong; the heat is more ardent, and dry •, and the fymptoms feemingly are more violent; the cold fit too is frequently more fevere, though as obferved above, this is not always to be relied on. As to their refemblance to the Continual, it is fo very natural, that it is not eafy in this period of them to make always a juft prognoftic, or judge truly what Fever one hath got to deal with. How ever, the fetting in of the Epidemic may greatly afiift one's judgment. It may likewife be obferved in them, that the heat of the patient's body feems to the touch, of an equal temperature, not greatly increafed, as in moft Con- tinuals. But notwithftanding all this, you arc very fenfible that Sydenham, and after him Boerhaave, have written, Quin et Jape initio Autumni mulan- tur exafte indolem continuarum, oh longiores et duplicates paroxyfmos, dum tamen indoles &amp; curatio plane diverf&lt;e fuht. The firft part ot which Aphorifm fhows, that at leaft in the beginning of Autumn, their appearances are as tallacious in other countries, as in Gombroon ; and the latter part of it declares, that a very different method of cure from that of Continual Fevers^ is requilite in thefe Intermit tents. I muft confefs, that notwithftanding two fuch great authorities, I have been frequently obliged to ufe the lancet to determine their Inter- miffions more fpeedily, left greater mifchief fhould have befallen the patient. Boerhaave, in another aphorifm on Intermittents, fays, VenafeRio meet per fe femper, prodefi alias cafu ut et tenuis exattaque Di&lt;cta: Yet he foon after wards adds, Porro fymptomati urgent i occur at ur juxta regulas in acutis datas. And I can with truth affirm, that in Gombroon, I often found moderate bleeding neceffary, as well as the tenuis exaflaque diata.[ 502 ] In the beginning of thefe Tertians^ as there are but few rules or precepts which wili not admit of exceptions, I have in fome very fanguine habits of body bled even a fecond time j and am of opinion that the probability of thereby protrading the fever's duration for a few months, at leaft in Gm- broon, is not fo hazardous as running the rifque of its change into an Un- remilting Continual Fever ; in which laft cafe it is always highly dangerous and ot a malignant nature. I am a living witnefs of an Autumnal.Fever which began and continued almoft perfedly regular for thirteen months in my own perfon, in fpite of all the medicines I took to get rid of it; neither did it ever double the paroxyfro, unlefs it was my own fault. I neither bled nor ufed any other fevere evacuation, and I have known the like hap pen to leveral others; fo that m Gombroon thofe Intermitting Fevers fometimes run much beyond the ulual period of their duration in other countries- nay even where bleeding hath not been ufed, xhz Vernal often continues to harrais the patient for fix months. But to return from this digreffion : I have often found the Fever by its continuance for a few days fo to weaken the patient, that I was dad to- a mimfter the bark even on the firft TntermiJ/ion, and always have done it with latety and fuccefs ; fometimes indeed, as was obferved in Quotidians* on firft giving this medicine it did not fucceed, nay in fuch cafes I have' tound the next paroxylm, as it were exafperated, though without danger to t iC patient, ut the fecond exhibition of this noble medicine never failed to put a temporary ftop to the fever, and often, if I might be allowed the exprellion, to make an entire conqueft over it. When fymptoms were not o after Intermijfion from the Fever, I gave the patient a drachm of the bat Polychreft evening and morning in a draught of bitters, and diredled e bitteis by themfeives to be taken two or three times a day, efpecially unng the IntermiJJions of the Fever. Care was taken not to overheat the patient to prevent his difeafe being converted into a Continual Fever, of which (except fome very great irregularities had been committed by the patient; he runs no great rifque, after the Intermijjions from the Fever have tor lome days been perfedly diftind. &lt;1J th Wh P /n Pared L im / 0r the /r , bark ' as mo ft praflitioners in Europe do at this rJ'hJ !'!, 0nce &lt; . the tMermifftms are fair and compleat, you are fenfible there be imnron^ S T r nT 'u 0 b ? rk - To ^ more t0 y 011 u P on the f'bje&lt;a would FpmfJt wirh ' , la ' '^ore on 'y add, that I have fometimes feen thefe ihmpfimi»c 10 ' l an y re a |0 ' 1 that I could affign, double their paroxyfms; and and fhnf , n Intermifficn that appeared, I adminiftered the bark, InhdnpH h fV, a ^^1^° t n eir P ro g re fs.

As to the Complications of thefe Fevers, I muft own 1 never met with * Dtmble Quotidian, unlefs the patient by interrupting the fweat at its beginning, brought back his fever before the wonted time. Double Tertians at Gombroon, are frequent, and eafy to be diftin^uifiied from Quotidians, by the paroxyfms being equal on equal days; for inftance if the accefs happens to-day at noon, to-morrow it will happen at fix at night, next day at noon, and the day following at fix in the evenino - , but often the fits anticipate each other. When the Fever was of the Tertian kind, thus redoubled, I ufed in the firft, fecond, or third IntermiJJion to reduce it to order by the bark. When it appeared in this form from the beginning, after a vomit and a few days treatment as in the Quotidian, I commonly took the firft fair opportunity to give the bark in fmall quan tities, which feldom failed of reducing the difeafe to a fimple Tertian, but I never ufed to be in too great a hurry. A Semi-tertian fometimes happens, and yields, fo far as I have found, to the treatment ot ^he Quotidians ; but be very cautious with regard to the bark. I have fometimes feen a Tertian afflift the patient for two days together, and intermit the third; and fometimes continue for two days, and intermit the two following days; both which cafes do however but feldom occur ; but among thofe Fevers you will find more irregularities than even what I have mentioned. When you are fearful of. ufing the bark in the mixed or complicated kinds of thofe Fevers, or even in the more regular Intermit tents, the Elixir of Vitriol is an admirable medicine, joined to bitters. It is alfo excellent to prevent relapfes. I never obferved at Gombroon, the Simple Continued Inflammatory Fever: and Putrid Continual Fevers feldom occurred, unlefs fuch as were of a periodical difpofition. As to bleeding in fuch Fevers, it muft chiefly be determined by the pulfe; this evacuation however in the fame fpecies of fever during fome rimes of the year, may be proper in fome perfons, but in others not fo neceflary, or 6ven advifeable j in general I found the nature of thefe Fevers, and like wile of the air, admitted of bleeding, if not carried to too great an height.[ S 0 4 ] height. I never omitted giving- a vomit as early as poffible, and if the vomit did not pais downwards, I the lame evening adminiftered an emollient clyfter i after which carefully attending to the genius of the Fever^ I pre- fcribed a cooling antiphlogiftic regimen, with attenuating falts, and julaps acidulated with the Elixir of Vitriel, being, as careful as I could, of a ne quid nimis. Violent attenuants or refolvent?, when too plentifully ufed, may diffolve the Crajis of the blood in too great a degree, and thereby contrary to their antifeptic nature, produce in the human body, effedls quite different from the intention with which they are given, by even converting the animal fluids into a putrid latex, altogether unfit for the functions of life. Thefe alfo too freely indulged,' frequently bring prepofterous fweats in the beginning of the Fever, before nature hath fufficiemly con- codled the febrile matter. To prevent or correal both which inconveniencies, I never found any thing equal to the Gas Sulphurise or fpirit of vitriol, frequently given either in julaps, or in the patients common drink. Orange- juice, and diftilled vinegar, are good medicines, and the laft is found in plenty in Gombroon. In Fevers the fpirits are more apt to flag at Gombroon, than at any other place I ever knew, efpecially during the heats, and in the foggy damp weather, yet I never had recourfe to any of the heating cordials, but found the acidulated julaps anfwer my intentions very well. . I rarely ordered emulfions, finding they curdled on the ftomach, either through the heat of the weather, nature of the patient's ftomach, or perhaps by means of the acidulated julaps lb neceffary m xhofe Fevers \ I therefore generally advifed whey for common drink, in which I could diflblve what refolvent falts I thought fit, and could acidulate to what degree I thought proper, without accumulating a numerous farrago of medicines upon the patient, which in fuch cafes ufually becomes naufeous; by this beverage* I found the patient's fpirits better fupported than by emulfions or teas, altho' I frequently allowed the latter, efpecially that made from fage, by way of variety. I fometimes indulged the patient with a cool tankard made with rhenifti, old hock, or in want of them with any other white wine; which if not acid enough, I fliarpened with orange juice, or fpirit of vitriol; but I think it not fo well to allow the patient this draught quite cold, as they ufually defire, for fear of occafioning obftruflions by its chilnefs. I pre ferred the farinaceous food, fuch as water-gruel, panado, Congee, &amp;c. to the lighteft flefh nourifhment, which in thefe fevers is ftill more to be prohibited, than in the beginning of any of the intermitting kind. A cooling clyfter is fometimes neceftary, efpecially if the fever much affeds the head; and by this gentle treatment, thefe Fevers in five, feven, nine, eleven, or fourteen days, ufed to go off by a gradual refolution j a very beneficial way to nature, and by no means hazardous.. 7 Fewand if i r rAr&lt; 1 f ff V1 p.: .
