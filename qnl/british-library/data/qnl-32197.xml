In Kuwait it is kept in tne Shaikh's name, separately from the Finance Department': account. Only the Shaikh can operate on it and he has recently given the Kuwait Municipality a cheque for Rs.5,00,000 against it. This confirms that the Shaikh told me himself viz. that the money was paid to him in London and that he distributed it amongst departments. He said that he was keeping none of it for his privy purse. The royalty is paid annually for the year ending the 23rd September. The first payment of just over Rs.10,00,000 for the period/June 30th - September 23rd 1946 was made in December last. 'LB* (ltd.)

Donaldson Mr, Southwell, Koweit Oil Company, rang up yesterday and asked if we could let him have a note on the Koweit frontiers for the information of his directors, I have ^epared a note below giving the definitions of the Koweit Saudi Arabia . and Koweit-Irak frontiers and pointing out briefly the points in the latter requiring interpretation, I think he intends to come and see you shortly about this and any further information he nay require and which may be given, could perhaps be furnished when he sees you. 7Ext 2262/47 Note cn the Koweit Frontiers The frontiers of Koweit can be divided into two sections: - ^ (D The frontier with Saudi Arabia; and (2) The frontier with Irak. (D The frontier between Koweit and Saudi Arabia was established by the Koweit - Nejd toundaxy Convent! n of 1922 which defines the frontier as follows:- 'The frontier between ITajd and Kuwait begins in the west from junction of the Wadi al Aujah (W. al Audja) with the Batin (El Batin), leaving Raq*i (Rikai) to Najd, fmn this point it continues in a straight line until it joins latitude 29° and the red semi-circle (referred to in Article 5 of the Anglo-Turldsh Agreement of 29th July, 1913)* The line then follows the side of the red semi-circle until it reaches a rjoint texminating (sic) on the coast south of Ras al-Qali’ah (Has el Kaliyah) and this is the indisputable southern frontie] of Kuwait territoiy. The portion of territory bounded on the Ilorth by this line and which is bounded on the West by a low mountainous rid e called Shaq (Ssh Shakk) and cn the East by the sea and on the South by a line passing from West to East from Shaq (Esh Shakk) to ’Ain al’Abd (Ain el Abd) and thaace to the coast north of Has al Mish’ab (Ras lasha b), in this territory the Governments of Uajd and Kuwait will share equal rights until through the good offices of the Government of Great Britain a further agreement is made between Najd and Kuwait concerning it.' This definit ion includes the definition of the Neutral Zone in which the Governments of Saudi Ar bis and Koweit enjoy equal rights.:ja ft oq I Bi vt Kt ) it:, f 0ii: e[ - l o,r Jit:: . r .ti . :'J.

(2) 'The junction of the Khor Zubalr with Hie iiior Aodui, lah n * There is some doubt as to wr^re Hie Khor Zubair ends and the Khor Abdullah begins..(3) The frcaitier alignment between the neighbourhood of Safwan and the junction of the Khor Zubair with Khor Abdallah, i.e. should this run in a straight line or in a Line passing close to Um Qasr, ^ ? .

AND Pi AOF 14-50 ^ ar Harrison, / • You will remember a recent conversation when I told you about the film which we had had taken of the Opening Oil Ceremony in Kuwait in June of last year. I mentioned to you then that when a proof of the film was shown to the Shaikh, he commented on the fact that it did not include photographs of the investiture which took place the day before the Opening Ceremony, and asked that these might be included. The Gaumont-British photographer photographed a number of things which were not put into the final film, but at the request of the Shaikh a few shots of the investiture have now been in cluded. His Highness was anxious to have this film with an Arab commentary, and this is being read by the B.B.C. Arab Commentator, Mr. El Ghazzawi. The script is all ready except for a note on the investiture, and I have now had information that at this investiture Shaikh Abdullah al Jabir as Subah was invested with the C.I.E. and Haji Ahmed as Salman with the Badge of Khan Sahib. I am wondering if you would be good enough to let me know how this scene should be referred to in the commentary. Yours sincerely. F.A. K.

Ol January concerning the use of a wireless transmitter 'by the Sheikh of Koweit and the allocation of the necessary frequencies* The suggestion that the channel for frequency demands should he via the Persian Gulf Manager of Messrs. Cables and Wireless and thence through Head Office in Tendon was made as being a practical method of frequency clearance, and in addition suggested a method whereby a speedy termination of this affair could be foreseen. I have since had words with Tbrrox of the G.P.O., who stated that he was not too happy about this suggested method of channelling as it might introduce political repercussions. I agree with Bbrrox, and now suggest that ary application from the Sheikh should first go to the Political Agent at Kbweit. If the latter then passes the application on to the Persian Gulf Manager, I do think that any question of abnormal procedure, which the Sheikh may raise over applying to Messrs.Cables &amp; Wireless direct, will be , Hf. ) F.A.K.

Horrox E s q*, G.P.O. 1 I am soriy about the misunderstanding and delay over the letters concerning the Sheikh of Koweit*s desire to own a private wireless transmitter. I have now seen the previous correspondence on this matter and can note that the point at issue is not so much whether a wireless set can be given to him as that of whether interference will be caused to other wireless installations in the area. There appears now to be no objection to the use of a set of this power on normal frequencies providing some system of frequency clearance is arranged, as there is seemingly nothing to prevent the Sheikh from purchasing a wireless set himself from any manufacturer and opening it for operation. With a view to finding a good channel to prevent frequency interference I rang Entwistle of Messrs. Cables &amp; Wireless and suggested to him that the clearance of ^ freauencies miriit be conducted via Messrs. Cables &amp; Wireless Persian Gulf Manager through the Head Office of Cables &amp; /Wireless5&gt; Tei.: Tel.: Whitehall 9000 Ext hh.6...

He said that he was agreeable to this procedure, and on hearing further from you in this matter would inform the Persian G^lf Manager that frequency applications from the Sheikh would be channeCLed through the former to the Head Office. I do not see any disadvantage in this arrangement and it will (a) ensure local co-ordination of frequencies in the Persian Gulf area. (b) get frequency request problems into a correct channel. In view of the comparatively low power (250 watts) of the proposed transmitter I foresee no major difficulties. I suggest that you arrange further action on these lines with Entwistle. As I see that a copy of the original letter came through the Foreign Office, and as frequency problems are strictly the responsibility of the G.P.O., I ajp sending a copy of this letter to Freese Pennefather and Bbrrox of the G.P.O., in addition to Entwistle.Tei.: Whiteha! ftLE COPY WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY BOARD, ^ / c/o ADMIRALTY, Tel.: Whitehall 9000 Ext 446 ..

Yvhile believing that reliance on the Party will lead to betterment in wages and working conditions, they seem to disregard the dangers of dismissal. As the source phrases it, n May God help the ungrateful Indians who may have to revent to India on four annas and six annas a day wages 11 . The informant expresses the opinion that these Indian employees are now more pro-Soviet than pro-British in outlook. f 2. Information from' Kuwait points to attempts to spread Tudeh ideas among employees of the Kuwait Oil Company and the likelihood of strikes for better conditions. Soviet influences are seen at work and numerous agents are known to be employed on the Perso- Iraq and Syrian borders. Though our informant had not actually come across subversive literature in Kuwait, such is known to be in circulation. 3. An informant employed by a British concern in Baghdad gives a somewhat similar picture of the course things are taking in the Rafidain Oil Company, with which his firm maintains close touch. The employees of the Khanaqin Company are full of sympathy for the Abadan strikes and admire them for the stand they have taken. The general opinion among people of this type seems to be that the oil companies are in for a bad spell. (SGD.) H.P.THOMAS, Lt .-Col. M.I.Q.

It is understood that the Sheikh has renewed his request for a private wireless installation, but its purpose is not clear, as Cable and Wireless Ltd. are already operating regular schedules with Bahrein, connecting Kuwait with the world wireless and cable network, and any further development which the Sheikh may require, including any external radiotelephone circuits which may be practicable, should presumably be operated by the Company under the terms of their concession.

Future constitution and activities of the Kuwait Oil Company. MEMORANDUM. The following emerged from a confidential discussion with Mr. C.A.P.Southwell, Director of the Kuwait Oil Co., on the 27th June, 1946. 2. The Kuwait Oil Company, staff, offices, etc., in London are to he separated from those of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company and Southwell is to be Managing Director on the new board, which consists apart from him of three British and three Americans. 3. Whereas originally it was intended to consolidate the developments at present under way before expanding further, it has now been decided to push on at a maximum speed with a greatly enlarged drilling programme. He was unable to say what the increase in personnel would be but instead of the ' 2 rig ” drilling programme originally planned there was to be a M 6 rig H one. It is not possible yet to give any idea of the increase in production expected. ( The scheme just completed is for 30,000 barrels a day or 2,000,000 odd tons a year.) 4. The biggest bottle-neck at present is housing. The building capacity of 'Kuwait is being utilised to its utmost and is still incapable of constructing more than a fraction of the houses required by the Company. It Is understood that it is proposed to bring in some Indian firm of contractors to erect buildings using Indian masons, carpenters, fitters, etc., and Indian labour to such an extent as may be necessary. 5. Although the decis^ion has not yet been formally taken a refinery will be built. It will not refine all the crude produced but enough for local demands and those of shipping etc., 6. All this will mean a large increase in personnel, of which the (frillers will be largely American, and in the local activity of the Company. JU7i&gt; JU * fUKC'k*' A. J. S. fa-' Sd. M.P.G’C Tandy.

Donaldson Pleas© see the enclosure to Mr. Peel’s letter No. PZ.6357A-0 - flagged - to #iich Colonel Hay refers, and earlier minute at PZ.104-5/41 • Towards the end of 1940 we learnt frcsa the Censorship that the Koweit Oil Company were contemplating the gif t of a 250 W radio transmitter to the Sheikh. The Political Resident did not like the idea, especially in view of the Sheikh’s doubtful loyalty, and suggested that his reported imoortunity in the matter was a false impression. After consultation with other departments it was decided that for security reasons it was in any case undesirable that the gift should be made in Wartime. The Company, in order to avoid the odium which,they thought, conveying a refusal to the Sheikh would incur, asked that we should ’‘mention the difficulty we should have in supplying the set in Wartime. The Sheikh agreed readily (to our surprise), to forego the set (PZ. 2417/41 )• Colonel Galloway’s view at the time is at PZ 1804/41 - it seems that Mr. Scott of the K.O.C. asked hL to forbid the gift of the set on political grounds, when the Company discovered it was going to be much more expensive than they expected. This Colonel Galloway refused to do. It is not clear from Colonel Hay’s present letter whether the Sheikh in fact suggested on the present occasion that he expected the wireless set for nothing; nor indeed why a set bought and installed privately by His Highness would be more likely to interfere with Cable ana Wireless ana Hi radio transmitter than one which he received as a gift. x, there is ^-^t^a ^h.luSIy SSy, Sheikh a wireless set in aaai-ciuu /andamd not the Political Agent should be made to refuse it* In any case the original object of giving him toys frcm time to time was understood to be the need to keep.him **sweet' until the Oil Compares got under my. As thes^ have now done soj and the Sheikh is rolling in wealth (his royalties are £ 30,000 a month), there seams no reason why hf should not buy a set if the K.O.G. will not give hip one. the suggestion that H.M.G. should give him anything the K.O.G. will not in order to prevent the Eastern Gulf Oil Company giving it to him, smacks rather of appeasement and would make it difficult to draw the line in any future case. cks As to the provision of a set fron Service stoap^s, the War Staff say that there are surplus 250W generating sets in India, but these are the American type S.C.R.399 which are LeaseLend and cannot therefore by the terms of the Agreement be disposed of to a .third party. They are in process of replacement by the British No. 53 set of the same power, but these are only now in production and there is therefore no surplus. However, we should be able to ^ obtain Foreign Office backing if necessary and could no * doubt crash the queue to get just one set, as the total ^ on ofder for India alone is over 700. The Ministry of Supply cost-price of this set (tropic-proof) is £1150 to which of course departmental inspection, freight and installation charges would have to be added, together with the cost .of a supply of spares. It should however at the worst be m than the American installation at £2500, which the K« 0.0. originally proposed to order (PZ. 6207/40). xt ^3 suggested that the Political Resident should be informed that H.M.G. cannot consider the provision of a set as a gift frcm them, but that if the Sheikh (or the K.0.0.) would place an order for one, we should be glad to help in any way we could. An installation of this kind would /apparentlyapparently not cut across any concession which Gable and Wireless hold, as they have no written agreement with the Sheikh and the Sheikh’s set would presumably not be used for conraercial messages.

A pipe line runs from Burgan in the centre of the oil field to the top of the ridge overlooking the sea at Ahmadi where the main storage tanks are situated and thence down to the sea at Fahaheel. There was a large gathering of European and American residents of Kuwait and of Arab notables. After coffee and lemonade had been passed round the proceedings were opened by a speech by Mr. South- well, the Managing Director of the Kuwait Oil Company. His Highness then unfurled a flag as a signal to the tanker,- thm 'British Fusilier', which was lying about a mile off the shore, enquiring whether it was ready to receive the oil. ta 3 ^ 61, r e Pl3- e&lt; ^ in the affirmative by 6 short one\ ^ blasts and one long4 The Shaikh then walked .across to the pipe line where he opened a valve which released the oil. When the Shaikh returned to his seat Mr. Southwell presented him with a handsome gold casket-2- contairdrig a translation of his speech in Arabic on vellum. His Highness then delivered a speech in Arabic and a translat ion of it in English was read by his Secretary. I enclose herewith a copy of the speech delivered by Mr. Southwell and a translation of the Shaikh* s speech. g. Towards the evening an ^rdha* or Arab dance was held in the public square at Kuwait and several members of the as Subah took part in it. After sunset an Arab dinner was given by the Company in the house of the Manager Mr. Scott and a hundred guests including His Highness sat dov/n to a meal which included 27 sheep roasted whole and 50 chickens. 3. The final event was a grand display of fireworks. Nothing of the sort had ever been seen before in Kuwait and the local population turned out in its thousands and was most enthusiastic. 4. From the purely local point of view the most significant result of the fact that the Kuwait Oil Company now h as/g one into production is that the Shaikh will in future receive from them an income of about Rupees four lakhs a month - a sum which may well increase before long.

On behalf of the Directors and Staff of the Kuwait Oil Company, I wish to express ou'fcr great and sincere appreciation of your presence with us to day. We have met here to commemorate the first shipment of oil from Kuwait, an outstanding event in the development of Kuwait*s oil resources which Your Highness entrusted to out Company some twelve years ago. We greatly appreciated the confidence which Your Highness then placed in our Company’s ability to fulfil this task, so important for the prosperity of your State. Nov/ we are happy to celebrate with Your Highness to day's event marking one more stage in the successful progress which, with Your Highness's encouragement and assistance, our efforts have achieved. May to day be auspicious for Your Highness, for the state of Kuwait, and for the Kuwait Oil Company. Your Highness is aware that the work so far done by the Company has had to be carried out in successive stages. In the first place, the Company's geologists examined the country in order to see whether, from surface indications, there was any likelihood of finding oil. In the course of their search they discovered what seemed to be some promising locations. The second step wasyto determine whether these surface indications were merely the vestiges of what had once been an oilfield in the in the remote past, or whether, far down in the earth, there were still large quantities of oil. The answer to this question was obtained by means of the drill, by which the Company has, after lengthy researches, found that under part of the mm. of Kuwait there is a big store of Petroleum. The third stage in these operations has now been reached, namely the actual production of the oil and its transportation to the markets of the world. Your Highness will agree that this successful result of the Company's preliminary endeavours represents no mean achievement, particularly as much of the work has had to be carried out under the very difficult conditions caused by the war, when the manufacture of essential drilling and other equipment was often greatly delayed and the shortages of shipping imposed further limitations op. activities. The success that has, so happily, crowned out efforts would never have been possible without four Highness's unfailing patience, loyal friendship and close collaboration, the excellent work of our Kuwait personnel and the technical skill and large resources of this Company, in which British and American interest and personnel are so happily blended. There can be no shadow of doubt that, if 'God will, this shipment which we are celebrating to day is but the first of manv that will convey Kuwait oil to the markets of the woild. We are proud that our Company, as the instrument chosen by Your Highness, has been able to make such su cce s s tu] progress and thus to contribute to the prosperity of youi State and people. . In order to express our warm feelings of gratitude and friendshio, I now present Your Highness with this humble a- which our craftsmen of the West have designed and made for this most auspicious occasion.INSCRIPTION FOR TOP OF CASKET 57 ,, Thi s casket was presented to His Highness Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as oubeh by the Kuwait Oil Company on the occasion of the first shipment of oil from the principality of Kuwait m June ( Mohammedan date ) TRANSLATION OF KI3 HIGHNESS THE SHAIKH OF KUWAIT * 3 SPEECH IN ENGLISH Today is a very happy day as we celebrate the first shipment and exportation of oil from Kuwait.

At the end of last year the Sheik of Kuwait wanted to obtain certain motor vehicles and spares. For reasons unknown to us he started trying to get this equipment through the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. He does not appear to have mentioned the matter to the political Resident. The Company discovered in l?ew York that the equipment could be secured in the United States at an approximate cost of 118,000 exclusive of charges and that export licenses and State Department approval could be obtained. 2 # Enquiries made in London by the Anglo— Iranian Oil Company produced the reply that it was not considered des rable that the vehicles should be supplied by any of the Oil Companies, By the micdie of* January this year the Sheik had evidently •..ecxaec, to try through more normal channels and had approached the political Resident who then recommended that the vehicles sixnad be supplied from India. -x ’fhe State Department approached us about thla matter on the 6th February preaumahly under th. _ lH.i impreasion that there was some ai-lficuity in supply ng the vehicles from India, they t«»W thlB were so, they were prepared to aupP 11 ? lii-clear I Imagine that this would also give ^P ® ual- f ro m if the vehicles which It was proposed to “yPP 1 -* India were lend-lease material or £ lend-leas© supplies * A**' fa - 4 V e are not at all clear about **• background to this transaction! we enclose y °]f s ^ en4)8P 15 th information copies of twocableB.oneo, from S r William Fraser to MF* JacKson, ™ Eastern DepartMent, Foreign Office,^ T.nyirfnn_ S.V . 1 .

This Commission established five possible alternative sites, from a technical point of view, for a refinery and terminal to handle, in the first instance, the crude production from the Burgan Field, vide Para 1. The alternatives were as shewn on Drawing No. KS 44/6^ 67261 and can be described as follows A. Refinery at Bandar Shuwaikh with tank farm and terminal at Duhat Kadhama. B. Refinery, tank farm and terminal on the south coast of Duhat Kadhama. C. Refinery tank farm and terminal in the Ras-al-Ardh/Al Bidda are^. D. Refinery, tank farm and terminal in the Fahahil/Shaiba area. E. Refinery, tank farm and terminal in the Urn Qasr area. General considerations appeared likely to rule out the Um Qasr alternative and a selection from the other four # alternatives could only be made alter additional hydrographic and site data had been obtained. It was, therefore, decided to embark on a series of preliminary hydrographic surveys and site tests which are now being carried out. PRELHuINARY HYDROGRAPHIC SURVE Y. SITE TESTB., AND KETEBaLOGICAL.

In this connection the Company would be grateful for any information that the Political Agency could provide. B. SITE TESTS. Examination and analysis of the surface soils, ground bearing tests etc., have been made in the Shuwaikh area and in the area south of Duhat Kadhama togetner with detailed topographic mapping of the areas of interest. In this category too, it is required to ascertain the proportions of coral and mud that would have to oe dredged if it were decided to erect jetties in Bandar ohuwaikh j.or unloading cargo boats up to 27 ft. draft.

One of the areas involved was Kuwait where certain wells which had been drilled, were plugged. For some time we have been discussing the possibility of re-opening these wells and also of going on with a larger scheme of development. The larger scheme of development has not yet been cleared, as in these matters we have to work in with the U.S. authorities. We have, however, recently secured agreement to a scheme for the re-opening of the wells already drilled, and you may consider it desirable to let the Political Resident know of this so that he could inform the Sheik of Kuwait. The Sheik has been very good during this period when it has been necessary to safeguard the position in the Middle East against possible enemy attack, but we have reason to believe that he has been observing developments such as have been taking place in Saudi Arabia and therefore it may help him to know that conditions have changed to the extent that we can begin to resume development work on a rather restricted scale in Kuwait. * I Yours sincerely R.T.

You will remember that the A.I.O.C. is an equal partner with the Gulf Oil Coup any in the Kuwait Oil Company- and that, I thxnk, is the reason why the representatives of the Gulf Oil Company in New York have discussed this matter with Jackson, who represents the A.I.O.C. Apart from trying to get an idea whether the supply of the suggested equipment would he contrary to H.M.G-’s policy,^ Fraser has raised with me the further point that if the Gu Oil Company is to he allowed to supply this equipment, it may have souse repercussion on their position with the Sheik o Kuwait. They, apparently, have not been asked to supply c*nd do understand the reference to the suggestion attributea to he Sheik that he had been unsuccessful in securing similar equipment through other channels. You will probably feel that you must consult the Political ■Resident on the matter and in doing so we shall be glad i you' 1 will eL that Mr. Patrick' s position is ^ P-te^a in any discussion which the Political Resident might feel it necessary 3 to have with the Sheik.

I found him very stiff and reserved, obviously with something on his mind, and inclined to be critical of everybody. He was critical of the Kuwait Oil Company (l know that he makes some strong remarks about them in private) and hinted that he would have had very much better and quicker results if any other Company had been handling his concession. I think their local affairs are dealt with in a very pettifogging way, and the Shaikh prefers open handedness so long as somebody else has to foot the bill. He mentioned the case of some R.A.P. planes which had crashed down the coast and how whereas Casoc had come forward with every assistance his own Company had been slow to move and prone to enquire who was going to pay for what*! I O Confidential D.O.No.C/295 153 Political Agency, Kuwait. 19th April, 1944. I Dear Sir Deoffrey, You will recall our conversations during your stay here from the 13th to the 16th instant on the subject of the new series of payments by the Kuwait Oil Company of advances of Royalty to the Shaikh; ani that you asked me to send you copies of the correspondence between Jameson and the Shaikh, concerning them. I now enclose copies of -Certified True Copies' of the Letter No.150 relevant letters as noted in the margin. I am filing the Letter dated 17-4-1944. “Certified True Copies* with my records You will also remember that I expressed some doubt on the question as to whether the Company should have conducted their negotiations with the Shaikh in this matter through my self as Political Agent; andthat you asked me to let you have a considered opinion on the question. The clause relative to it in the Political Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company, which I had in mind.is Ho.4 and reads as follows; «0ne of the superior local employees of the Company shall be designated chief local representative of the Company in Kuwait, -he approval of His Majesty’s Government shall be required for the person so designated. He will be ordinarily resident at Kuwait and will be responsible for the Company’s local rela ions vm the Kuwait authorities. These local relations shall always be conducted through the Political Agent at Kuwait, except as , _ tyhi f'o mav b© 'ti'sris&amp;ct}©d regards routine commercial business, vhi.n ma? through the official representative (if «*r) ^ may appoint under the agreement; between the Company and Shaikh ‘ pt seems to me, on consideration, quite fair to argue . the “local relations' of the that this clause only uon~~ - lt (-O.POT- «M» W. wrw—w ** Company } ^ fact the case) are not of relatione-, (» 1^ - v&gt;that there is no other provision in the Political Agreement (or in the Commercial Agreement between the Company and the Shaikh) making it incumbent on the Company to negotiate such arrangements through the Political authorities. We would not, therefore, have a strong case for insisting that, according to the letter of the agreements, the Company should negotiate through us. Nor, again after consideration, do I think that it is at all expedient or necessary that we should do so on general grounds. Ordinarily even we cannot touch oil and not he defiled. The fact that the Shaikh did not refer to me during these recent negotations may, I think, he taken to imply not that he distrusts the Political authorities, hut that he trusts the Company in the person of Jameson well enough to he able to dispense with our advice; this is to the good, further, this fact precludes the Shaikh from having any complaint against us if (which God forbid.) the xien agreement should not turn out to his liking. The company, as you know, informed me (withal very informally) of the result of the negotations thus admitting our ultimate directive right in their activities and their desire to have us on their side. This is also to the good, finally, in this as in other similar cases, I believe that the parties concerned will come to us if they nave any trouble; and that, provided Government-s interests are not threatened, it is better to leave them alone if they do not do so The other course - direct interference - is likely to saddle us with undesirable and unnecessary responsibilities for (occassion- ally) murky commercial transactions and, in the case like the Shaikh, to cheapen our help in his eyes when it is preferred unasked. If you generally agree, then the only action now required is to send copies of the enclosures to His Majesty-s Government and to the Government of India for information.

Dear Peel, In reply to your letter of April 24tn, you will have nobiced that discussions have recently heen taxing place in regard to denial schemes at Bahrein and on* the mainland of Saudi Arabia and that the proposals have now reached a fairly advanced stage. It seems to us that at a time when a number of wells in the Persian Gulf are to be cemented off in order to obviate any risk of their falling into enemy hands, it is illogical to continue drilling operations in an adjacent territory, particularly when these operations are not directly connected with the war effort. We therefore feel that although the effect on public opinion locally may be unfortunate, we are not r in a position to encourage further developm ent* in this • area. The same considerations also apply to - -atar j/ulL and w r e are at the moment considering whether we ought wwif to recommend that operations in this area should also be discontinued and the existing wells immobilised.

DRAFT LETTER. sDx^.iocs'i ol , j 9 4 2 - id-i** »4? e'XC Dear Starling, ax © .■ . gi oi In connection with the question of oil pioduction in the Persian Gulf, on which we have had recent correspondence with you regarding the situation in Bahrein, it has occurred to me that we ought perhaps to consiaer the position in Koweit also in view of recent events in the Far nast, and the entry of America into the war, by which our supplies of oil may be affected. The position in Koweit as you will no doubt 1 ~ ,&lt;J - ^ ? - ■ remember is t at you agreed in your letter of the 8 th November, 1939 No.PD.98/2 Part 2, that there were no grounds for the decision of the Koweit Oil Co. to restrict their activities to a one rig programme, and the Company has been working on this basis ever since. This was recently confirmed in your letter of the 3 rd November to me when Mr.Kemp raised t v a question of supplies for his Coup any. We should be glad to know whether, in changed circumstances, you consider that there A.is any case for asking the Company to reconsider their decision. it may of course be t^at the production of crude oil in Kov,eit is not likely to be of sufficient importance to make this worth while, and in any case it would be some time, depending largely on how soon the necessary materials coula be made available, before they could get going-. If your view is,as I rather anticipate^ that for the time being at any rate the Company should continue to work on their present restricted programme? there is a further point that Mr .Kemp raised with me w en he called the other day, and that is whether, with the entry of America into the war, t^e problem of securing the necessary supplies to keep the Company's activities going in Koweit on their present scale is likely to become even more difficult. I gather that the Company will in fact be able to carry on for some time with the materials t&gt;ay now have in hand ’ and we COUld P'raps leave the question over for consideration if, and when, difficulties begin to arise but from the political aspect it is desirable if p 0ssib that the Company shoulu be able to secure such necessar; materials as will enable them to carry on, at any rate - some extent w (ogd.)

Dear Starling, % Kemp of the Kuwait Oil Company has sent me a cony of his letter to you of October 22nd about the equipment and other supplies which the Company wish to send out to Koweit, 2. You will remember that in the early days of the war, when the Company announced their decision temporarily to curtail their operations in Koweit, the Political Resident, in the Persian Gulf in his telegram No.T/485 of November 17th 1939 (a copy of which was sent to you under our No.F. Z.7257/39 j urged that they should tU. dauliup be pressed to reconsider their attitude. Ye nevertheless v j . accepted the vie?/ which you/expressed&gt;in your letter of (&gt; 4 * however, that from the political point of view it would be a very bad thing if the Company’s activities were to be restricted any further or if they were obliged to suspend operations altogether. As Kemp points out. . f ki . 1 a fal. Pen. ZaasLcx Lyx^cAyy^oU^y November the 8thReference 98/2. fart 2, that the Company’s decision should not be contested. We feel, 4. AS.

The development of an indigenous ’water supply would therefore be axwery excellent thing, mid it is. of course, desirable that this inestimable benefit should be conferred upon Koweit by a predominantly British company. Moreover, the military authorities in Iraq have^mtdfrConsideration various schemes for improving port facilities in Koweit and just over^Iraq borde^; and in this connection also a water suouly in/In these in Kovveit would clearly be of very great value, circumstances, not only do we support on general gTounds the Company’s application for permission to export the water drilling equipment, but you may also find that the War Office and the Admiralty would be prepared to support it as of direct importance in the prosecution of the war.

The shareholders felt that although no immediate gain to ther.selves could result from the continuance of operations in Kuwait, It would be highly impolitic from the concessionary point of view to suspend them* This view was reinforced by the India Office who, I think I m. right in saying, would then have preferred a’vigorous 'programme of work to be adopted. Early In 1939* the Company had embarked on a large development scheme but on the outbreak of war this was cancelled and we continued to drill with one rig only.

My dear Colonel, Will you please refer to the 20th January, 1941 ? I have not yet letter No, 6357 of November 27th, your telegram Ho. 7 i of received India OfiTce* :'r. -'ktk '■ ^ 1 think at the outset that it should be explained that the picture the India Office have gathered of the importunate attitude of the Shaikh with regard to presents is not correct. He, true enough, likes something for nothing, but it was Holmes who jockeyed the Company into the Buick, and Scott who landed them for a Wireless. ^ 3, The idea of the Buick was put into the Shaikh’s head by Holmes at the time of Jameson’s visit in January last year. Jameson did not commit himself, but said that if the Shaikh were to ask the Kuwait Oil Company to place an order for a car it might so happen that no bill would be sent. Holmes, presumably to feather his own cap, must have put the facts falsely to the Shaikh, and told him that he had induced the Kuwait Oil Company to present him with a car. The Kuwait oil Company, on their part, kept to Jameson^s word, and so in the autumn of last year Holmes was forced to write to the Shaikh that if he wanted a car he would have to place an order. Having thus defeated the machinations of Holmes, the Kuwait Oil Company played the game and promised a Buick to the Shaikh. Holmes thereupon sent a telegram to the Shaikh cancelling his letter. 4 4. As regards the Wireless, the Shaikh asked the Kuwait Oil Company to purchase one for him. Whereupon Scott suggested that the set should be a present to the Shaikh, The Company, having in mind a hundred pounds or so, agreed,and the Shaikh was duly informed. it was only then that they decided that they needed fuller details, and from, these it appears that the set is to cost thousands. Scott then asked me my views and thought perhaps i might like to forbid the presentation on political grounds. To this I could not agree and suggested that he should tell the Shaikh that the set he wanted could not be obtained in war time. It seems now that Scott’s approach failed. no ending It has already been decided that there is objection to theShaikh’s broadcasting (vide correspondence with my demi-official letter Bo.C/210 of the 10 th May 1940) and I have nothing more to add except t~K&lt;ft now that the Shaikh s him, he is not in a position to broadcast, and londer wants to. nevertheless, while i see no Shaikh’s broadcasting, i think on the whole it Aide is not with and probably no objection to the v/ould be better if the Company could be helped to escape from// The Hon’ble Lt.Colonel C.G.Prior, C.I.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

My dear Gibson, With reference to our talk over the telephone this morning I enclose a message which we should be glad if you would cable to the Political Resident or Political Agent, Kuwait, for transmission to Mr. Scott - if possible before the Shaikh is informed of the cancellation of the wireless set. (The Company will of course be glad to defray the cost of the cable.) As you know, the Company is carrying out an investigation in Kuwait by means of special drilling apparatus to ascertain if supplies of water could be made available by drilling wells. Very shortly after the decision to cancel the wireless set Mr. Scott reported that a test well, situated in a remote and waterless part of Kuwait near the Riyadh Road and about 40 miles from Kuwait town, had produced water which is considered potable by Bedouins for themselves and their flocks. Mr. Scott suggested that there would be an excellent re-action in the Company’s favour if, at chosen points, we sank wells and erected windmill pumping units and storage tanks. I referred this proposal to Directors who immediately agreed to the provision of three sets of equipment. J.P.

I am happy that the frequencies concerned were selected for geographical and not political reasons. I am not so happy about the stipulated Radio Telegraphy equipment - much depends upon the bona fides of the Sheikh in question. I agree that the immediate course is to await Resident Bushire f s reactions. But if he says he can see no way of taking a hand in the proceedings, I rather feel that we should take action at this end. The Radio Company from whom the goods are ordered will be obliged in due course to apply for an export permit and that should enable us to ’’make enquiries” without revealing the censorship source of our information.

Dear Gibson, You will remember that when I last called on you I mentioned that the Company was contemplating presenting H.H* The Sheikh of* Kuwait with a rather high wireless powered/telephony set. You expressed a shade of doubt as to the desirability of such a set being sent to Kuwait in war time. The specification of the set which we contemplated presenting to the Sheikh comprises the following (a) An output of 250-watts to 500-watts on telephone is requested, (Duplex Telephony) and a Halicrafter Sykrider Receiver. (b) Three crystal controlled frequencies: (i) 17600 Kilocycles. * (ii) 11700 ' (iii) 8800 ” (c) Although the equipment is primarily required for the transmission of telephony, telegraphi c signalling may be required occasionally. I understand from our electrical engineers that Military or other objections to the existence of wireless apparatus in Kuwait may centre more upon the possibilities of the set as a telegraphic instrument rather than for its telephonic powers. In this connection H.H. already possesses a Heintz Kaufman 50-watt Radio Telephone Transmitting Set which was given to him by H.M. King ibn Saud. This set, I am informed, would not have the range of that which we propose buying but the fact that it already exists in Kuwait and is capable of P.T.O.- 2 - telegraphic transmission may lessen the objections which H.M.G. might otherwise have to the proposed gift by the Company. The Company is already committed to supply H*K, with the new set and we should find it rather difficult to back out except at the express wish of the India Office. Would it be possible for you to let me have your views about it fairly soon? Yours sincerely. J.P.

To avoid expense we are prepared to accept a manually operated device in the form of a control button or switch which will not apcomplish true duplex telephony but which.will allow the rapid switching of the carrier so that question and answer can be exchanged without long delays whilst valves are heating up, etc. Gramophone Transmiss ions - While some importance is attached lot he bro a d c a s tTng ''of gramophone records the type of music likely to be dealt with does not warrant the expense of broadcasting equipment with straight line characteristics throughout the musical scale.

The apparatus should comprise an electrically driven gramophone turntable a robust 'Pick up' and a 'Mixing Panel' which will select either Microphone or Gramophone or both, for the purpose of making announcements. Telegraphy - Although the equipment is primarily required for the transmission of telephony, telegraphic signalling may be required occasionally. Unless the apparatus offered is equipped with a keying circuit for C.W. and I.C.w, transmission as a standard feature, it will be sufficient to supply a telegraph signalling key with 800 cycles buzzer or oscillator suitable for connection to the Audio frequency input circuit in place of the microphone. Antenna system - It is proposed to install the equipment in a room on the ground floor of a two storey building and to erect an aerial system on the roof. A feeder system will be necessary the minimum length of the feeder being about 100 feet. The site is open and adaptable so that any standard arrangement proposed by the Manufacturers can readily be carried out.

In making this proposal, I feel that you will agree with me that I am within rights in requesting additional financia* help-from the i ny- seeing that I had been led to hope that a declaration of the discovery of oil in commercial quantities would be mad© during the late months of 19S9* If such declaration had been made, the increased development activities which-in the ordinary course- thr- Company would have undertaken, thereby giving my work-people the opportunity of work and hastening the day that regular production of oil would eventuate. I request that I may ask for an extension- to be agreed upon between the Company and myself,-after the expiry of the period of the first five years, if the production of oil-at’that time- ha s not reached the stage where the yearly revenue in the form of Royalty does not equ«l the minimum. Royalty of As#250,000 plus the yearly advance against Royalty of Hs.200,000 mentioned below, making a total of Rs.4S0,000# And such an extension -if any be made- shall be upon the same terms and conditions-except as to the period of extension -as mentioned in the following suggestion. SUOaBOTUh. (a) The Kuwait Oil Company shall make to me an advance against Royalty by yearly instalments of the sum of Rs.200,000. each, for a period of five (5) years. The first instalment -of such advance against Royalty- shall be made to me by the Company on March 1st, 1940# The remaining instalments of Rs.200,000.each, shall be made on each anniversary of the date on which the first payment is made. The final payment being made on March 1st, 1944. This advance shall be free of Interest# (b) The Company at any time subsequent to March 1st, 1944, may deduct each year lOp from all Royalty which may become due to me, in excess of the sum of As#450,000. per annum until the whole sum of Rs# 1,000,000. has been recovered by the Company. (o) It must be clearly understood that this advance made by the Company is an advance against Royalty, and not in any manner a login. The advance made is not recoverable by the Company, except from Royalties that may become due to me on the oil produced# I trust that the Board of the Kuwait Oil Company Limited, will decide regarding the above request with as little delay as possible.

AHMED ALJAB3R ALSUBAH. 313 KUWAIT. 10th November1939 M 7 dear Major Holmes, I thank you very much for your letter of 28 th ultimo, enclosing the letter sent to you by the Kuwait Oil Company. I have studied both yours and the Companyts letters, and your comment on the latter and I have come to conclusion to make the following ooservations which I find quite opportune. Firstly, I have to express my regret at the very slow conduct of the Company^ operations here from the commencement • 0 4 . now £. considerably delaying the early attainment of the object, ’which is yet to be decided. Unlike the other oil companies operating in the neighbouring countries, I regret to say, K.O.C. has been working on with one rig only, instead of working with two or more rigs, especially when the oil struck at the first well in sufficient pressure, thus speeding the achievement of the desired result. Secondly, their conference at the Political Agency in the March last discloses the fact that they were expecting the present troubles, but they never thought of getting sufficient stock of drillimg material from abroad for the proseotion of their activities without hinderance. This failure is a sufficiei t proof which substantiates my above point. Thirdly, I have not heard that the Iran, Iraq, Bahrein or Saudi Arabian Government have allo?;ed their respective oil companies to close their oil w T ells down which are working with increased pressure. Further, in the last War Turkey was at war with H.B.M’s government, and was operating in the western parts of Persia to attack the A.P.O.C f s Oil Fields, even then A.P.O.C. was working with full speed. Now I don’t understand the reason why K.O.C. has taken this measure in particular for Kuwait State which has not yet started its oil production and which is far from enemy action. My other point is this, that while other Oil Companies are not entertaining such imaginrry fears, why K.O.C. takes it as a reality and gives full effects to it. Lastly, I consider that the Company’s decision of payment of annual Royalty of Rs. 250,000 is quite inadequate. They should increase it to the minimum Royalty of Rs. 400,000, to make up the loss of my revenue which will be deficient on account of their decision. Further I want to know the definite period of the relaxation of their operation in the present state. TP say in brief, I reluctantly disclose my opiniontojou with regret that the K.O.C's way of working foj Kuwait is far from satisfactory. -Therefore I shall ^ y 2 u ,J Y J li ^ k 3: ] ? dl3r take U P this question and discuss j thv&gt; Boo.rd of Directors^ and let me know the result. With my best compliments. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) AHMED ALJABER ALSUBAH oil in grateful withHigh Highness, Shaikh Sir Ahmed al Jubar as Subar. KUWAIT. * 28 th October, K.C.I.E., C.S.I. aid 1959 .

The Company, therefore, decided to pay the minimum o£n a nnn as ^ rovided in the Concession Agreement, i.e. Rupees 250,000 per annum, until such time as circumstances permit of normal operations being resumed. I should have written to Your Highness about the Company’s letter before, but I have not been well as I had a sharp attack of malarial fever, it began on the 20th October and it was only today I have been able to leave my bed for a lew hours and so took the opportunity of writing to Your Highness I hope Your Highness will excuse this letter being short, as I still have xever on me which does not tend to clear expression.

While the cessation of activities may, on the face of it, appear to be unfortunate, it is the case that at present there is a surplus of oil production in that part of the world, and difficulties over tankers are causing us to restrict purchases for the time being. There are so many other directions in which the technical staffs of the oil companies can be more usefully employed that I do not think we have any ground for contesting the decision of the Company. v; e win not fail to let you know if circumstances change and the Company ought to be asked to reconsider their decision. ^ 1 ' etter to jarrett and Eyres.

Scott attended a conference with the Honble. the Political Resident and other representatives of H.M. Government at which were discussed the steps to be taken in Kuwait in the event of war. The Political Resident was anxious that our wells should be adequately safeguarded against enemy action, and that we should take particular care against such types of action as those v/hich took place in the region of Bushire during the last war. . The Board decided, therefore, that in the event of war any live wells should be mudded off. This procedure is quite usual in oil field practice and is not harmful to the wells, which can be brought back to their original condition by de-mudding. On the outbreak of war. Wells Nos. 1 and 2 were forthwith mudded off. With regard to Well No. 3 , the position is that this well has only recently been completed and casing has been set with its foot in bottom water. It was the Boards intention, in the ordinary course, to have this well tested by gun-perforating the casing from the bottom upwards. In the present circumstances, however, they feel that it would be inadvisable to do so and that the well itself and the oil resources of Kuwait would be better protected if the well were mudded off and the test postponed. • As you are aware, however, it was also the Board f s intention to consider making a declaration that oil had been found I In commercial quantities when Burgan No, 3 Well had been tested and if satisfactory results had been obtained. The Board feel that i ~ without this information they will not be in a position to make the/ ■ ■ .4 ■ ■file copy plotted to Political Department. £fiEX~£° Mr»Walton* 4621b D E C Y P H £ R ,QF T 3S L E G R A Prom Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* to Secretary of State for In&amp;ia* Dated Kuwait, 14.00 hra* 23rd Ootoher P 1939* Received 16*00 hrs* 23rd October, 1939* X ?/4Q6q Addressed to Secretary of State for India, copy by post to Government of India, copy Political Agent, Koweit* Reference Gibeon ? s p.Z. 5999 dated September 29th to Kemp* Sheikh asked me 2 days ago to press the Company to make this declaration ae early as possible* Presume I may inform him of contents of above letter?

Dear Peel, Your letter, P.Z.3882/39, of 29th June about the Koweit Oil Company and the question of the commercial production of oil. 2 . I note from your letter and the enclosure to printed letter P.Z.4061/39 of 3rd July that the Company have decided to make a declaration to the Sheikh at an early date in connection with Article 3(b) of the Commercial Agreement that 'petroleum has been found in commercial quantities'. 3. I do not think that we can possibly maintain that the - making of this declaration involves the raising of the question of the erection of a refinery which is dealt with in Article 10 of the Political Agreement. It is true that under that Agreement the Company agree to examine with H.M.Gr. the question of establishing a refinery if end when they are 'satisfied that commercial production is assured'. R. Peel, Esq., C.B.E., M.G., India Office, King Charles Street, S. W. 1. RECd. POL. DEPt, 18JUU939But under the Article the Company only declare their intention to erect a refinery ”should they consider that commercial conditions justify it”. The drilling of three wells, which is all that has taken place so far, represents in effect only a very early stage of the development of the field and it may be some time before the refinery question becomes a live issue. I think it is arguable that the Company 1 s declaration under the Commercial Agreement is a trifle premature but I do not feel that justifies us in raising the refinery question. 4. In the circumstances I suggest that you might inform Mr. Kemp that we do not propose to raise the refinery question at this stage although we attach considerable importance to it and will, of course, raise it if and when the field develops. 5.

Major F. Holmes, Mill Hill, Sandon, Chelmsford, ESSEX. Dear Major Holmes, ; ;ith Reference to His Highness* letter to you dated 24th ar J Ji ls ’ t:ruc 'ted by Directors to request you to trans mit the following observations to His Highness. At all times since the discovery of oil in Kuwait at Burgan^Ho. 1 well, Directors have been mindful of the provisions of the Concession agreement relating to the declaration that oil has been found in commercial quantities and ^ r ere anxious to make this declaration as soon as it was justified by the information obtained from drilling. As you are aware, Burgan Ho. 1 well was regarded as complete when it had penetrated only 13 feet into the oil reservoir. This action was taken on the sound principle of not jeopardising a discovery well by further deepening at a time w r hen reservoir conditions are virtually unknown. Burgan Ho. 2 well was then drilled and, having struck oil, was carried to a considerably greater depth than Ho. 1 . In order to obtain information on reservoir conditions, a petroleum engineering examination was made promptly after the discovery of oil in Ho. 2. Unfortunately, the examination did not provide the data which it had been hoped to obtain because the shales above the oil horizon in Ho. 2 well caved in and prevented tests being made in that well. In many respects, the information provided by the examination of Ho. 1 well was satisfactory but it was found that, after the well had been flowed and then closed in, recovery in bottom hole pressure was very slow. This fact will probably have a considerable influence on methods of production from the Burgan reservoir and if it is confirmed by observationDRAFT COPY. 3 i 4 Major F. Holmes, at other wells it may he necessary to drill a much greater number of wells than are necessary in regions which are not characterised by slow recovery of pressure. With these factors in mind, but realising that His Highness would doubtless wish a declaration to be made as soon as possible, Directors had agreed to reconsider the question immediately information from No. 3 ' ;; ell became available. This well is now drilling in the cap rock. 11 inch casing will shortly be set and the well will then be drilled into and through the reservoir. If oil is found in this well also, casing will be set throughout the oil sands which will be tested from the bottom upwards by gun perforation. Directors are satisfied that this procedure i- the best that can be adopted for the development of the oil resources of His Highness’ territory. Director's wish me to stress that tne procedure for No. well outlined above will be carried out with all expedition. It is their great hooe that the results of tne driltinf and examination of the well, taken in conjunction with information already obtained, will enable them to make a^declaration that qxI has been found in commercial quantities in the near future.

Scott has now informed me that though he has as yet received no definite instructions from Lorrton, it is most probable that the second test well will be drilled some 4 miles to the west of Ma’adaniyat and at a later date a third well in the vicinity of Burgan. After some consideration, Scott has finally decided to site the new camp at Majwa, from where he hopes to be able to service both wells when drilling operations recommence. (He hopes to commence drilling at Ma’adaniyat by October next). Por the moment the Company’s activities are confined to moving camp from Bahrah to Majwa, where building operations are now in progress, and completing the geophysical work, which should all be finished by the end of the month. Though the camp at Bahrah will be closed down when the move to Majwa has been completed, it is not Scott’s intention to vacate the site as it is believed that at some later stage in the Company’s work the No.l well may be of use as an indicator.

The Ruler at the request of the Local Manager of the Kuwait Oil Company having agreed to a formal opening of their boring operations, arrangements were made for His Excellency to come to Bahrain, the site of the well, on the 30th May there to start the rig working in the presence of the Notables and The hour chosen for the reception, the first of its kind in Kuwait territory, was 4.30 p.m. and the day falling as it did in the ”Barih ath-Thuraiya’* period of warm and strongish winds, the start from Kuwait at 1.30 p.m. for the 100 or so guests was a hot one. Nevertheless at that hour all the Kuwait cars most of them very fully laden with the Notables and their followers, set out at racing pace into the dust haze. Strangely there were no casualties reported but many of the guests arrived an hour before the time for which they were invited. Meanwhile the Company found the weather had destroyed its arrangements. The flapping dust-filled tents were quite unsuitable as places of reception and were abandoned in favour of the garage. To a very crowded audience only slightly revived by Sherbet, the Manager delivered his address and His Excellency through his Secretary briefly replied before the rush by car to the derrick began. There the Ruler at 5 P.M. on the 30th May 1936 by pressing an electric button had the gratification of V $ SECRET. setting/0 » M S / 2 . setting the rig, the first ever in Kuwait and the third only in all Arabia, to work. Some shy applause greeted the vertical jerking of a length of boring pipe by the percussion drilling machine. His Excellency thereafter examined with attention the machinery both at the rig site and afterwards at the workshops. Acetylene welding, in particular stirred his interest and he watched, through dark glasses, for some time the cutting of metal by an Indian welder who had already lost one eye through the pursuit of his trade. Before leaving the Ruler was shown the Offices and storerooms where the Manager of the Company as a parting gift presented him with 2 tins of Nestle*s milk. His Excellency expressed his very great satisfaction at everything he had seen and the hope that Oil production would not be far behind. As His Excellency entered his car he was informed that the well had already reached a depth of eight feet. (c) Particulars of the derrick are as follows:- The derrick is located approximately at: / ■■ 47° - 58* - 45’* East Longitude. 29° - 36* - 15” North Latitude. The height of the top of the derrick above mean sea level is 169 ft. It is immediately beneath the route at present used by Imperial Airways. The derrick from now onwards will be lighted whenever work is in progress at night b y electricity, there being two single lights at the extreme top and single lights at 20* intervals up the derrick legs. Batteries of flood lights at the 100 ft. mark and at ground level are arranged to give bright illumination of the derrick floor and interior. All lights will be steady.
