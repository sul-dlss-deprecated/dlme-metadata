Your^ Crilly Senior Statiojl^Gfricer For Station M a nagerReduced Air Fares for Children and Students Dear Consulate, You may be interested to see the enclosed copy of Foreign Office Circular No. 10. This gives details of the concession now granted by all major air lines to children under the age^ofjwelye and to school-children and university students travelling between the country in which they are being educated and that in which their parents or guardians are resident. A similar circular has been addressed to Chanceries (as No. 022). Yours ever, Personnel Department.OFFICE CIRCULAR No. 10 [ GA 80/2 ] Reduced Air Fares for Children and Students I.—By a resolution passed at a meeting of the International Air Transport Association, which has since been approved by the Governments concerned, school-children and full-time college or university students between 12 and 22 years of age, travelling from the country in which they are pursuing a full-time academic course at an educational establishment to rejoin or visit their parents or guardians resident in another country, may be allowed a round-trip reduction of 50 per cent, of the sum of the normal one-way fares for both the outward and inward journey on the following conditions:— (a) that a certificate from the educational authorities regarding the student’s age, status and the purpose of travel is submitted; (b) that normal free baggage allowance and excess baggage rates apply; (c) that normal cancellation (voluntary or involuntary) and refund procedures shall apply provided that no action is taken which in the case of voluntary cancellation results in a passenger obtaining one-way transportation at less than normal one-way fare; and (d) that stop-over privileges are not included. The above reduction applies throughout the world with the following exceptions:— (a) the South Atlantic, where on the routes to and from South America the reduction is 25 per cent.; (b) the North Atlantic, where the 50 per cent, reduction operates only during the periods 1st September-31 st March for eastbound trips, and 1st December to 30th June for westbound trips. These reductions are authorised maxima but are normally granted by the air lines concerned, including the British Corporations. ]L—The fares payable by children under the age of 12 are governed by the following resolution of the I.A.T.A.:— Resolved (1) that the passenger fare for infants under two years of age not occupying individual seats shall be 10 per cent, of the adult fare, 16009—1 38341—9a- r* A.' providing that only one infant accompanying each passenger paying the adult fare be carried at such 10 per cent, fare; (2) that the passenger fare shall be 50 per cent, of the adult fare for (a) children who have reached their second birthday but have not yet reached their twelfth birthday, (/&gt;) infants under two years of age occupying individual seats and (c) infants under two years of age in excess of the one accom panying a passenger paying the adult fare; (3) that children and infants referred to in clause (2) shall be allowed the full adult free baggage allowance and their excess baggage assessed at the full rates as for adults; (4) that infants for whom the passenger fare is 10 per cent, of the adult fare shall be granted no free baggage allowance; (5) that the age limits referred to above shall be taken as of the date of commencement of the outward journey; (6) that where a through journey consists of a combination of an international air service and a domestic air service, the fares of which latter either are not subject to any reductions for infants or children or are subject to a different rate of reduction, then the fare for the entire journey shall be the sum of the applicable infant or child fare for such international air service and the adult fare for the domestic air service, less percentage reductions, if any, appli cable to infants or children that may be provided for in the tariff of such domestic air services; and (7) that the term “ adult fare ” as used herein shall include any published, normal, all-year, one-way, round trip, circle trip or open jaw adult fare. III.—Even when journeys are not chargeable to public funds, officers are reminded that it is in the public interest to make use of British air services wherever practicable. 13f/i March, 1950. H.

Unfortunately, the resolution of the International Air Transport Association on which they were based was nullified subsequently, and although in many cases concessions are granted it should not be assumed that the reductions will invariably be offered by British or other Air Companies. You should, therefore, refer to your local travel agents to ascertain exactly what the present con ditions are in each particular case. A similar circular has been addressed to Chanceries (as No. 076). Yours ever, General Department.
