(Copy to the Political Resident in the^ ersian Gulf no. 53/421 HEEJAM 'EOV/iir/' S' LIBERTY?HU IHCIDEi'T Attached report from 'PO’VEr’ - Ho. 121 dated 14th Hovember 1934 - is forwarded. It was received before 'SHOREHAM' reached Henjam, and additional information collected by the Clerk-in-Charge after 'POWEY' sailed, was also reported on 2. It would appear that after the pitcher (per;-.4 of above report) was broken, the rating who had thrown the stone enquired as to its price from the water-carrier, as he wished to make good the damage. The water-carrier asked Rupees 2, and it was obvious that the pitcher was not so valuable and the sailor commenced bargaining. (The Clerk-in-Charge and 5Jr.Hardin ( considered it worth * nas 2 and 3 respectively when new). tfhilr this was in progress several armed police appeared, and one of them seized the sailor by the front of his Jumper. He was promptly knocked down for his pains as were two other police. The sailors then valked down to the pier. The remain er of the story appears to be correct. 3. Later, the Deputy Governor informed the Clerk-in- Charge that he was thinking of ordering his police to use their firearms. ’r.Telles then advised him that he would place arrival himselfhimaolf in a most u; enviable position should he do this. 4. It is thought that the Deputy Governor has tak^n a peculiar dislike to ktr.Telles lately, probably because in his presence he has an inferiority complex whichb is not compatible with his idea of his own importance, particularly since he has moved into his large rew residence. 5. aly staff officer, prior to landing in order to discuss the registration of boats question, was also armed with the above information. rebuke for being improperly dressed on a former occasion when lying in bed in full u iforra looking a picture of defection. He stated that he was sick. 8. After completing the registration question, the Deputy Governor asked ray staff officer whether he desired to discuss finished the interview as far as he was concerned but if the Deputy Governor had any other question on his mind he would be pleased to listen. 8. The former then recounted the incident at length from a very Persian point of view, and he was infortaed that, while the accident was regretted, it was considered that his police in their failure to control the villagers had magnified the affair unnecessarily and that the subsequent disturbance was due entire ly to them. It was also pointed out to the Deputy Governor that as he was sick at the time, he could not personally vouch for the accuracy of his version of the incident. 9. When mention was made that the incident had occurred on the first visit of a new commission, opportunity was taken to receiving ray represei tative, very much to heart, was found to b&lt; 6., The Deputy Governor, who appeared to have tqken his any other question of duty. The latter replied that this remind-3- remind the Deputy Governor that, although lihertymen had been warned that the Persians were most peculiar people to deal with libertymen had not realised that conditions ashore were so very different from those to which they were accustomed and had a right to expect in civilised countries. Though warned, they could scarcdy be blamed for what must appear to those who do not know to be truly ridiculous. 10. The Deputy Governor then volunteered that the people of Hen^am were 'savage' and that his police were little better. while agreeing with this, the staff officer informed him that he need not fear any trouble on this score in future as a small patrol ould be landed from His Majesty 1 s Ships. After expressing himself grateful, it was agreed that in the unlikely event of further trouble with libertymen, the Persian police should Jake no action other than informing the patrol. | 11. A suggestion that libertymen should not use the H.I.Ij. pier but should land on the beach below the Canteen » * was not entertained, was a second that libert; men should f K*' re-embark before sunset. 12. The Deputy Governor also mentioned that he had forwarded a report - couched in very mild terms in view of his admiration for the Senior Naval officer - to higher author ity, and was informed that though the Senior Naval officer considered the matter trivial and laughed when he heard of it, naturally under the circumstances he would also report the incident as the British authorities must have the correct version. 4 13. Instructions have been given that in addition to the normal pier patrol, the path between the Canteen and the Pier is also to be patrolled while libartymen are embarking. Ships 1© ~4— Ships* oompaaies have again been specially warned in addition to the usual warning every time before landing. 14. The police are a low type of coolie, some of them dismissed from Telhe* work party and take their cue from the Deputy Governor. The latter, who as far as X can gather, is better part^ T rkish, is peculiar and not much/than his police. He has very little intelligence. V.*hen attacked and told he is stupid, he believes it, but when no notice is tek en of one of his many acts of pettiness, he interprets this as a sign of weakness on our part assuming that we are in the wrong and becomes objectionable. 15. I am in agreement with the Commanding officer of H.tf.S. KMEY that advantage was probably taken of a new Comraamiing Officer and a new 8hip , s company. I have warned all Commanding Officers that this would be the case. It as unfortunate that the Commanding officer did not send ashore in the first place to demand an apology for the behaviour of the police and the consequent disturbance informing the Deputy Governor he would take &amp; serious view of the matter unless the latter promised he would i;ake necessary action himself. All would then have ended satisfactorily. 16. But, though warned, it is practically impossible for a newcomer to realise the extraordinary mentality of these petty people. If a complaint against the Persians does happen to be forwarded, I cann&amp;t but feel that the recipients have every reason to consider our report exaggerated, as do the new Commanding Officers. 17. Under present conditions these small trials must be expected whenever new ships Join the division. Kven with old ships* companies, though the men are oomraendably and surprisingly-fj- surprisingly carsful, one oan never feel oertain that a trivial accident will net cause an international commotion.

Sir, I have the honour to forward the following report of certain unfortunate happenings ashore at Henjam, yesterday evening, 13th rtovember. 2* Libertymen, after having been warned in accordance with Persian rjulf Order Ko. 112, in addition to directions as to their conduct ashore given thea by me on recommission- ing, were landed at 1530. I am satisfied, from reports of Chief petty officer* that there was no excessive drinking and that the libertymen left the canteen to return to the pier in an^ orderly manner. 4. In spite of their warnings, however, it appears that there was some 'skylarking' on the way dov n to the boat to another and a small stone thrown by one rat ing/accidentally hit a water pitcher, carried by a man, and broke it. 6. Immediately there was a shout, whilst police and natives rushed one party of libertyraen, throwing stones and lashing out with sticks. no attempt was made by the police to arrest any of the men who naturally, but regrettably, defended themselves. Both this party and the party ahead, who had neither heard nor taken part in the disturbance, were followed to the boat and were pelted with sticks find stones until the boftt left the pier. 6. Meanwhile the Glerk-in-Charge, hearing the x&amp;kiKjt cine went to the Canteen and informed the Chief and Petty Ofiioers who were still there, that there warn some trouble on Three tnu pier. Xke Chief and one Petty Officer run to the pier. The Senior Naval Officer They VPersian Oulf.They were also pelted with stone^y men, women and children and the Petty Officer was deliberately tripped up and his knees cut# These ratings were surrounded by an angry mob and informed that someone had interfered with one of thej(i women# 7. Two of these Chief Petty Officers and the Petty Officer were for no apparent reason arrested, and therefore demanded to see the Deputy Governor. They were taken to his house; sentries with loaded rifles on one side and a howling mob on the other. After ten minutes they were informed that the deputy Governor was sick and a few minutes later were released and given permission to return to the ship. Police with loaded rifles were guarding the steps to the pier. 8. The stoker who was the cause of the trouble to reported the fact of his being so/the First Lieutenant immediately on his return on board. After the Chief and Petty Officers had returned aid investigations made, I sent Lieutenant Commander Ian M.Martineau, R.N., ashore to the Deputy Governor to apologise for the unfortunate accident but for nothing else. 9. It was evident that a disturba ce had been plained because :- I (a) The whole police force of the island had been collected at this village. (b) The police and natives were obviously lying in wait, otherwise they could not have arrived on the scene so quickly nor been so well armed with sticks. The suggestion that the water-carrier was a woman was also nreaumdb ly made in order to give further exouse for the attack. 10. I consequently felt in no mood meekly to admit that right was on the side of the per si tins. Beyond the original act, about which disciplinary action is being taken. I I considerconsider my libortymen in no way to blame, since they were not resisting arrestxacao: no attempt to arrest anyone was being made. 11. Lieutenant Commander Martineau, on arrival at the pier, was not permitted to land for come quarter of an hour, although it should have been obvious, even to a Persian policeman that he was an Officer and had plainly come ashore on duty th out this matter. He was eventually allowed to proceed to the Deputy Governor’s house. 12. Lieutenant Commander ^artineau apologised for the 13. The Deputy Governor then stated that the trouble originated through a rating jostling a water carrier, who vus a woman, but made no reference to the high-handed action of the badly hurt and these ere paraded for inspection. However, it transpired that two were suffering from abrasions only and the third from loss of several teeth. 14. Lieutenant Commander Martineau then pointed out that some of our sailors were also hurt - one rating had the back maintaining friendship, that this never happened with other ships and that he did not v/ish to make ariy trouble or stop as unforeseen accident but expressed his surprise (a) that the police appeared so suddenly and in such force. (b) that they made no attempt to control the populace from Joining it, nor made any effort to arrest anyone but only to deliver a. general attack, eventually arresting obviously innocent men. police nor for their lack of control of themselves or the * natives. He then stated that three of his policemen had been of his neck cut with a stick and the petty officer was injured as already referred to. lb. The Deputy Governor then said that he was all for libertyraen-4- libertymon landing again. Unless he reoeived a oomplaint from the woman he was quite prepared to let the matter (2rop. He was assured that it need not hare happened if his police had main tained control. Lieutenant Commander Martineau concurred with the hope that the matter was finally settled and stated that we also desired friendship and collaboration. 16. Lieutenant Commander Martineau attempted to land at 0600 this morning for exercise and to interview Mr.Herding and the Clerk-in-Charge in an endeavour to obtain any fu ther details that might have come to litfit; but found a policeman, this time unarmed, vdio forbade him to land. 17.1 then sent my interpreter to the Deputy Governor to enquire why, after being informed that the matter t*as settled, an officer was not allowed to land. The Deputy Governor replied that his orders must have been misunderstood arid if an officer 1 anfled latfcr he would explain. Lieutenant Commander Martineau went ashore to see the Deputy Governor at 11.00. 18. It was not clear why the Deputy Governor wished again to see an officer, unless it was in order further to emphasise his desire for cooperation with the I.avy in view of his friend- ! uhip for you. He reiterated his reluctance to report the matter officially. Lieutenant Commander Martinuau pointed out that I had no alternative but to report the unit ter to you. He repeated that we also desired frie dship and cooperation. The Deputy Governor now admitted that the viator carrier was a man and not a woman. 19. The Dep- ty ^vernor proposed that tonight libertymen should be landed on the beach abreast the canteen. This looked strangely as if he felt unable yet again to control his police if the pier were used. 20 ..ZO.Thts Deputy Governor suggested that the ratings primarily responsible xxxxxat should be landed to meet the injured policemen This Lieutenant Commander Martineau was of opinion (rightly I consider) would have been undesirable and he tactfully evaded such a commitment by pointing out the ship was sailing within the next few hours. | £1. The meeting ended on a most amicable note and in view of the fact that the matter was apparent ly forgotten and also that the Deputy Governor had stated, hintingly, how kind you had I been to make him a present of fruit, I felt it would not be amise and might seal the bonds of forgetfulness, if I sent him a basket of fruit this afternoon, which X had originally intended \ to do before the episode of yesterday occurred. 2£. To my surprise and disgust, the fruit was returned (though my ”card of compliments' was retained), with a somewhat i garbled message suggesting I was endeavouring to ’’grease his \palm'. X mention this merely as an indication that it is unlikely that he intends to let the matter drop but will in all probability report it. He pompously announced that it was a very big matter but he would make it a very small one l In view of this suspicion, I thought it advisable to inform you briefly by signal that some slight trouble had arisen. X ueeply regret that such an unfortunate episode should have occurred at the commencement of a new commission but I am convinced that some 'casus belli' would have been found or manufactured for a disturbance designed to aggravate &amp; new Commanding Officer arid Ships* Compary • I am equally corvineed that the occurrence has had such a salutary effect on the ''’.hips* Company that it will not recur.

His Majesty's Ship 'Ormonde' was on the date mentioned coaling ship at henjam and a number of coolies were on board in consequence• Among the coolies was a young boy who at a given moment was holding in his hand some bread when one of the coolies, a grown man, came up to him and took away the bread, or a large part of it* One of the petty officers of His Majesty's Ship 'Ormonde', who happened to see the coolie take the bread, deprived him of /it. His Excellency Mirza seyyld Bagher Khan Kasemi, Minister for Foreign Affairs.2 it* The eoolle thereupon attempted to strike the petty officer and succeeded in pushing him to one side* The petty officer retaliated and In doing so hit him on tiie lip with the hack of his hand f making his lip bleed* 3* The eoolle was taken to the hospital quarters of His Ha^esty*# ship 'Ormonde 1 9 hut as he refused medical treatment it was impossible to ascertain how such he had been injured* Subsequently he complained to his foreman and asked for an investigation* An investigation was accordingly held and the coolie was told that considering that he had been caught stealing bread, had been neglecting his work, and had attempted to strike one of the petty officers of the ship, he had no valid ground for complaining of what had happened* At the same time the petty officer was admonished by his superior officer for acting hastily. 4* On February 3rd (bahman 14th) that Is to say seventeen days later, the I&gt;eputy Governor of Hen jam sent a message to the Commander of Els Majesty's Ship 'Ormonde' asking that the petty offleer concerned and the ship's Interpreter might be sent ashore for the incident of January 16th (Day 26th) to be Investigated* The Commander at once /eent3 I sent hie Interpreter to tfte deputy Governor to explain tnat tiie incident had taken place on hoard a man-of-war and had heen fully inveetigated at the time it occurred, and to give the Deputy Governor any explanation he might need* fhe Interpreter added that the incident had heen reported to the Senior Jfaval Officer and the Deputy Governor said that he too would bring it to the notice of hie superior authorities* 5* While expressing my regret that Your excellency should have heen troubled by this incident, I trust that the explanations which I have given will enable you to assure the Imperial Government that the coolie concerned was not the victim of any injustice or ill- treatment while on board His Majesty 9 a Ship 1 Ormonde 9 • 6 * My personal view la that as the deputy Governor must have known that it would nave been contrary to internat- ional practice to send the petty officer ashore for interrogation, it la a pity that he did not accept the invitation of the Captain of his Majesty 9 s ship 9 Ormonde 9 to dlaousa this trivial matter with him on hoard* I avail myself of this opport unity to renew to Your T £ceellency the aaauranoe of my highest consideration* (Signed) R.

Tinder the status quo arr««went, ehlch I hare always understood to be the basis for Treaty negotiations, our original rights at Hen jam should still ob+aln. 3. It is by turning the other cheek that we hare encouraged the 'ignorant and ▼aln** officials mentioned to further petty acts of annoyance* Thourrh I realise that conditions ashore are Gilbertian and it is necessary for political reasons to submit to treatment which would never be tolerated elsewhere, I have found on several occasions in the past that these Persian officials respect firmness. 4. The behaviour of the ships* companies of the Persian Gulf Division idien ashore at Henjaw has been exemplary, at times under very trying conditions, but, unless a firmer attitude is,ado pied and adequate safe guards introduced into the proposed agreement human nature i* such that further incidents are bound to occur sooner or later. sd.

C»3 Gould you please refer to Hoare’s letter i^o. 79 o f ICth February 19 34 to the Foreign Office on the subject of an incident which occurred at Renjam in which the Chief Stoker of Rie Majesty's Ship '‘Ormonde'* struck a coolie. 2. In my memorandum dated the 6th September 1933 i put forward various arguments for moving our i^aval Bas from Henjam. r 'Lis rnemorandum formed the subject of discussion at a C.1 .D.meeting on or about the 12th October, at which l was present and at which the Admiralty representative stated that the Admiralty had decided that they lid not want henjam on the terms which the 'breign Office and the Minister rauld get it for them. Later the Admiralty apparently changed their minHs and agreed to Hoare trying to make a 'gentlemen's agreement’’ with the i?ersian Oovernment on the subject pf the base - vide, for instance, paragraph 2 of Foreign Qo Office letter ho.50 of 25th Januaiy 19 34 to Hoare. — -% 3jp6 3 ? paragraph 5 of my memorandum quoted above -r - p* gave it as my opinion that whatever agreement was . come 1o wi1 h the Persians over lienjam there woul^in mv opinion continue to be difficulties : 'Henjam is of course one of the questions to be adjusted in the forth- comi ng/ J.C. i'alton Esq. ,C .B. ,M.C The India Office, Lon d on. 2 3 MAR 1934- 2 - ^coining treaty negotiations with the Persian Government. ^ven if formally adjusted, however, in the shape of a lease or whatever other arrangement is come to, personally I doubt whether, the Persians being rtiat they are, this will obviate the risk of further incidents”. Hoare's re-rarks - vide paragraph 2 of his letter quoted above - would seem fdlly to substantiate this opinion. he says^'So long as His Majesty’s Government are dependent for refuelling and recreational facilities for the Persian Gulf l^lotilla upon a depot situated on foreign soil and administered by officials as ignorant and vain and easily offended as the average Persian official, they must be prepared, if they wish to retain this depot, to be content on occasion with less than their strict rights under international law and even to submit to treatment which, if we were dealing with a full 37 - civilised country, would not be Ttfiol^ consonant with the dignity of the -Navy* 1 do not pretend that this is a situation which can be contemplated with satisfaction, \ but there is no advantage to be gained by refusing to face it. Whether an 3 ^ concessions or safeguards which 1 can obtain in the General 'treaty will alter the fundamental facts upon which it rests remains to be seen”. 4. I do not know for what reasons the Admiralty have changed their minds since the C.1 .D. meeting already alluded to, but from the political point of view 1 am still of the same opinion as expressed in paragraph 2 of my memorandum: 'In fact, to sum up the position briefly, it appears to me that our naval base at Hen jam embitt e rs/ 0-3~ ers our relatione with -fereia; hampers our policy towards that country, and is the indirect cause of incidents which are damaging to our prestige'*. 1 am sending a copy of this letter to Hoare and to Metcalfe, C| MMWe 0 • » pc-'ijrcp j?y| OFFICIE Telegram (en clair) from Sir R.

As two particular comments I will say that I do not think present moment suitable one for abandoning -D^siciu in view of recent attitude of Persian Government as shown hy treatment of Mr, Sykes and Bahreinis, ey accusation that we are stirring up trouble in Baluchistan, by highjy disobliging replies to representations on one or two matters of less importance and above all by delay in resuming treaty negotiations which may now be regarded, as ostentatious I think in fact that abandonment would be regarded as evidence that pressure pays and we should be worse off whether or not negotiations are resumed than before. Secondly I do not entirely share views expressed in paragraph 2 as similar attempts to levy taxes have been made at intervals since 1928. What I should regard as ideal line would be to say to Persian Government 'If you wish to resume negotiations please furnish a formal assurance that you will act in the spirit of the status quo agreement until negotiations are either concluded or abandoned; this means that you will stop persecuting Bahreinis in Persia, molesting Arab dhows on high seas and taxing inhabitants of Basidu.2. We also'wish to be assured that you do not suspect us ci making trouble among the tribes, I£ you will not give us these assurances we consider negotiations to be definitely abandoned and shall take measures as may be necessary to protect our interests and those of the Sheikhs. This would of course mean withdrawal of rail head of Baluchistan railway to Dalbandin', I f Perslan reply were negative we should proceed to abandon Basidu and begin to prepare naval station at Bahrein informing Persian Government that as soon as it was ready we should evacuate Henjara. We should also inform them that our abandonment of Basidu was result of careful study of our title and we had reached conclusion that it might be successfully attacked. We had simultaneously examined question of Bahrein, Tamb and Sirri, We had no doubts whatsoever about two first and wioh regard to last we were content not to disturb status quo though we regarded Persian title as doubtful. If the Persian Government showed signs of taking up this challenge whether directly by an appeal to the League or indirectly by molesting Arab dhows and persecuting Bahreinis we would take the initiative by forcing an issue on one or other of these disputes and take it to League if necessary. Whole of above represents I fear counsel of perfection but I put it forward because I am becoming more and more convinced that until the ghost of Persian preoensions to Bahrein is laid our position with the increase of Persian activity in the Gulf and of growing oelief here that the Persian army is a serious factor will become • ♦ •3 become increc^ingly difficult. Shell has all the proverbial characteristics of a hully. Most practical course with regard to immediate Basidu issue is to protest against taxation as we have done on previous occasions, to advise inhabitants net to offer actual resistance and'refund the trifling sum which may be extracted from them, I fully realize - and it i* a point on which Mro Mallet who has just been to Basidu lays stress - that for officers cormanding His Majesty’s sloops passive acquiescence in these Persian encroachments is most galling. But I can see no alternative at present if I am right in believing that simple abandonment of Basidu would now be bad tactics„ Repeated to Government of India No. 1 Saving and Bushire No. 4 Saving,N ^Iir,aiItIBUTION .

If we are to remain at Basidu, and it would be a mistake to abandon it now, status quo should be observed and action taken in this case.

I realised when the political Resident first fcrou^it the matter to my notice that as the inoident took place on hoard a foreign man-o-war the peputy-OoTemer had no right under International law to require the ehief stoker to he produced before him for enquiry. But the position under international law is not, with all submission, the practical point at issue, this, to ay mind, is that the incident took place at Henjam, and that so long as Hi* Majesty's Government are dependent for refuelling end recreational facilities for the Persian Gulf Flotilla upon a depot situated on foreign soil and administered by offleli ** as ignorant and rain and easily effended as the average Persian official, they ianst be prepared, if they wish te retain this depot, to be content on oooaslon with less than their strlet rights under international law and even to submit to treatment which, if we were dealing with a fully civilised country, would not be wholly consonant with the is a dignity of the Kavy.

X have not as yet reeeived any complaint from the Persian Government and the matter may not oreate a serious incident since the latest reports from the senior if aval Officer suggest that X mqy be able to convince the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the ohief eteker acted in self-defence, and that as the incident occurred outside his jurisdiction the Deputy Governor, if he wanted to hear all about it, could reasonably have accepted the invitation toXX.

Previous Papers .*— The Deputy Governor of Henjam is not a very important person, tut it is most unlucky that this incident, petty as it is, should have occurred at the present moment* It is to be hopea that if the Deputy Governor fulfils his threat of reporting the matter to Tehran, the Central Government will not make too heavy weather about it. 2. The Admiralty are of opinion that we are on strong grouna in international law.* But that is likely to make little difference to the Persian reaction if there is any disposition on their part to cause trouble. *A. £ \v v 7- &lt;' H v 5041 2000 1.31S E C P E T IQ n - i ‘“h Peb^ry 1934, M.0341/34. My dear Varner 9 As arranged over the telephone, I am writing this note to let you know the Admiralty view about the questions of International Law raised by the recent Incident at Henjam when a chief stoker belonging to H.M.S. ORMONDE was alleged to have struck a coolie. There seems to be no doubt that the Persian Government have no right to d emand the surrender of an individual alleged to have committed a crime on board a foreign war vessel int erritorial waters. The law seems to be very well summarised in paragraph 450 f page 675 of Volume 1, Oppenheim's International Law, 1928 edition, *Crime8 committed on board (i.e. a warship in foreign territorial waters) by persons in the service of the vessel are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the commander and the other home authorities*. Hall in paragraph 55, page 246, 8th edition, says ’'a vessel of war, or other public vessel of the state, when in foreign waters is exempt from the territorial jurisdiction; - No doubt you will find the matter dealt with in your file E430/305/34, on which you wrote to us about the abolition of capitulations on the 8th February 1926. I think there can be no reasonable doubt that the only remedy the Persians have against us is a diplomatic d emand..... i C.F.A# Warner, Ksq., Foreign Office, a.
