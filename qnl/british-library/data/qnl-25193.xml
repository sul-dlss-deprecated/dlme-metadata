This is seizures referred tom Admirals telegram to Mar Addressed Foreign Secretary to the Government of India; repeated to Admiral, Senior Navai Otlicer, Persian Gulf Division.171 314 Telegram P., No. 78, dated the 11th (received 13th) September 1912. From—His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, Diyatalawa, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department (repeated to the Political Agent, Maskat, Political Eesident, Persian Gulf, and Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf). It has not been customary latterly, for reasons of policy, to exercise our right of search in Maskat waters which was conferred in 1898 by His Highness the Sultan of Maskat. In view, however, of the fact that His Highness is now committed to (arming the warehouse), (?) I propose that dhows, suspected of having arms on board and evading the Sultan’s proclamation of 1st instant and disobeying later proclamation forbidding the removal or sale of arms except through the arms warehouse, should be searched. The above course has * become necessary since large quantities of arms are being sent by sea out of Maskat and our only chance of capturing them is to seize them as the dhows leave Mutra or Maskat or off the ports of destination which probably are the Batinah. Of course French dhows will be immune from search. It does not seem necessary to inform the Sultan as the proclamations issued by His High ness should be sufficient to warrant us to act. If, however, it is considered by Political Officers that the Sultan should be informed, I have no objection to this course, provided there is no delay and the matter is treated as very urgent. If strong measures are not adopted now, arms traders will he able to remove all their stocks from Maskat, and, as the arms can be transported by land from the Batinah to the Trucial coast and up the Arabian coast, our chances of capturing them, when once they are exported are small. As there are signs indicating that some of the Trucial Coast Shaikhs seem to realise that the arms traffic is dead, the procedure I have proposed is very necessary. It is reported that 700 or 800 rifles with ammunition have been given up by the Shaikh of Shargah to the armed launch “ Karanja’^and before reporting I am asking for further details. It will have everywhere a very bad effect if it becomes known that notwithstanding the proclamation issued by His High ness the Sultan of Maskat, arms can still be removed with impunity from Maskat. A very urgent treatment of the case is requested. 315 Telegram P., No. 80, dated the 12th (received 1 th) September 1912. From—His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, Diyatalawa, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Marine Department. I have sent the following telegram to the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf :— Major Knox’s reasons are not known to me, but, as he is on the spot, they are probably sound from the point of view of the present, but the effect on1 to nior 172 the future may, I think, be more important. If the arms dealers realise that we do not take notion against their dhows in Maskat waters, it seems to me very probable that they will transfer their dep6ts to Sohar or other places on the Batinah Coast and arrange for steamers to discharge at these ports. I understand that there the Sultan’s power is only nominal, and, in the event of steamers being foreign, difficulty likely to create an awkward position will arise, and our work over the warehouse at Maskat may be lost.

Again I must place on record with the utmost respect my opinion that it can be~no part of the duty of His Majesty’s ships to enforce within His High- ness’s territories, His Highness’s proclamations, without an invitation from His Highness the Sultan of Maskat. Permission has been applied for by rae to raise with His Highness the question and to endeavour to obtain such an invitation, but I trust that until n reply has been received to my application you will be able to see your way to suspend the execution of those orders because, in my opinion, carrying them into effect will gravely retard main scheme of arms warehouse, unless His Higimess is first consulted.

Reference Your Excellency’s telegram, dated 12th September, addressed to me and repeated to the Government of India, Marine Department. The position is as follows from my point of view. Please see telegram, dated the 9th September, to Senior Naval Officer. Action ordered therein to seize certain dnows appeared so me trorn the context to constitute adoption of the course recommended in paragraph 5 of your letter* No. 248, dated 31st July, to the Government of India, Marine Depart ment. In this connection both the Political Agent and 1 had been of opinion that the Sultan might be approached but 1 personally expressed doubt, vide my telegramf No. 911, and repeated to Your Excellency as to what his attitude would be. It was clear from the Govern ment of India’s reply $ No. 524, dated 4th September 1912, that they thought that without consulting the Sultan the action in regard to this and other proposals should not be taken and that even to do that we should not be in a hurry. Sultan no doubt feels he has done a good deal up to now and that, before he considers any fresh departures in the way of suppression, the difficult position in which we have placed him with the French should be adjusted, and the permanence of warehouse assured. I see no objection fairly outside territorial waters to seizure of dhows, as hitherto, but we have too much to be thankful in the loyal co-operation in regard to the larger issues we have hitherto received from the Sultan to make it worth while alienating that co-operation at this critical juncture for the sake of possible seizure of a consignment or tw T o of arms by taking action in his territorial waters without first securing his concurrence. I would suggest for the Government of India’s consideration that authority be given to the Political Agent to use his discretion to take a favouiable opening to discuss with His Highness the Sultan with reference to his notice of 6th September this question.

The naval resources of the French Government in the Indian Ocean are, 1 think, ordinarily limited to one antiquated 2nd class crusier and one anti quated 3rd class with head-quarters at Diego Snarez. Navy will be in a posi tion to watch their movements and will know what ships they have at present. I should say that the resources which the Commander-in-Chief at present has in the Gulf are sufficient pending any suspicious movement of the French ships, if the present enquiry is made with regard to need to show the Sultan that he is fully supported. On the other hand, I am of opinion, if His Majesty’s Government are considering the question of keeping a strong squadron at Maskat as a step calculated to strengthen their arguments with the French Government, that the uncompromising attitude towards the Sultan of the latter and the gene ral situation at Maskat have now reached a point at which there is no longer any local objection to proposal.

Knox has doubtless replied in terms proposed in our telegram of 28th August, and approved by you. We would suggest that in negotiations with French Government stress should be laid on dangerous character of trade. Analogy of gambling house was used in Lord Morley’s letter of 1st April 1911 to Foreign Office. But arms trade might perhaps more suitably be compared to trade in noxious drugs or explosives, such as petrol, which is carefully regulated elsewhere.

I presume as regards the 33 cases, they have been merely detained as explained in your telegram and not confiscated, and that as regards Sultan’s alleged threat all i is proposed to do (if not done already on expiration of fortnight’s grace from 1st September), is to place cordon round warehouses containing existing stocks the property of French citizens . see your telegram of 28th August and my telegram of olst August.

Failure to enforce rule IV will have a pre judicial effect.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla (repeated to the Admiral and Political Agent, Maskat). His Highness the Sultan of Maskat may, the Political Agent thinks, now at any moment raise the question of payment. Please see my telegram No. 143, dated 25th Pebruary 1912, in this connection. Sultan can, strictly speaking, press the claim that he is entitled to receive one lakh cash down, as soon as warehouse arrangement is inaugurated, as compensation for the past together with the first instalment of the enhanced subsidy. He should, the Political Agent recommends, be authorised to pay on the 1st September the last mentioned item and considers that such payment will have beneficial effect. He recommends, on my enquiring his views regarding the one lakh, that payment should, if possible, be delayed until the Batina coast problem has been satisfactorily adjusted, and the warehouse arrangement has been working satisfactorily for three months. It would hardly appear that we can, in principle, if the Sultan raises issue, impose a specific period for the delay of140 payment, and a e;ood deal must depend on the developments, but, it would I think, he reasonable for the Political Asrent, if His Highness raises the question to explain to the Sultan that as yet nil the rules have not been seen by His Majesty’s Government, and that there still remain to he adjusted one or two important points, and advise His Highness not to press him (i.e., Political Agent) to apply to Government for the payment of the one lakh of rupees until all is cut and dried. I support Major Knox’s recommendation as regards payment of the first instalment of the increased subsidy and beg that the matter may be treated separately and urgently and, if possible, orders telegraphed on the 1st September. 264 Telegram P., No. 911, dated Ihe 31st August (received 1st September) 1912. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. I have been in communication with the Political Agent, Maskat, regard ing the following two problems regarding Arms Traffic negotiations, which have in recent correspondence been specially mentioned, viz., — (a) (please see 1. o - J? 1 _ * -XT _ -i l i.1 * Serial No. 91. paragraph 3 of my letter* No. 136, dated the 5th June) supply of the wants of Oman subjects; and (5) treatment of the depots, especially Sohar, on the Batina coast. As regards («), the subject of any special dispensation for Oman subjects has not yet been broached by the Sultan, and meanwhile they have lately been arming themselves briskly owing to apprehension of cessation of arms trade. Consequently Major Knox and I agree that this question can be treated deliberately by letter, as it is not likely to come into issue for some time to come. As regards (b) we are in His Highness’s hands. Sultan has so far played the game thoroughly, but if we in opposition to his inclinations press for any arrangement, he can defeat us by giving the persons interested a hint to remove their arms inland. There seems to be two alternatives. If the Sultan can be brought to the scratch he can take sufficient force on his steamer and raid depots, one of His Majesty’s ships for his moral support lying in the offing. If by friendly persuasion he cannot be brought to that course, we are of the opinion that we must make up our (sic) mind to treat the Sohar depot as a question of minor and passing importance, and be contented with far-reaching advantages gained by the successful inauguration of the warehouse scheme, maintaining our blockade a little longer in order to cope with it.

I have sent a copy of this telegram by post to the Political Agent, Maska , and repeated it to the Admiral.141 266 Telegram P., No. 150, dated (and received) the 1st September 1912.

With reference to consignments coming by sea after the 1st September, steps will be taken, and I have explained to His Highness the clearance of customs house, and His Highness informed me that he would arrange accordingly. Before receiving the notice already referred to officially, His Highness under un-official cover sent me a copy of a letter which had just been received by him from the Prench Consul in which latter under telegraphic instructions just received from the Minister of Foreign Affairs informs His Highness that the French Government abate none of its rights under Treaty of 1844 and will demand all necessary satisfaction and compensation for all loss or damage resulting to French merchants residing in Oman or France or foreign countries. The French Consul has also been reminded by the French Government that it has not consented to enforcement on French subjects of the new regulations. French letter ends. His Highness reminds in forwarding above that he shifts the burden of compensation to our shoulders, if any has to be paid.

The delay in its publication need therefore cause us little concern. 3. It will he noticed that, in bis forwarding letter, His Highness gives me to understand very clearly, and in writing, that the proclamations, and the rules made thereunder, will be enforced from the 1st of September 1912. I had not actually intended that this intimation should as yet be conveyed to the Consular body at Maskat, thinking that it would be preferable to notify them by means of the draft proclamation forwarded under cover of my No. 127, dated the 12th instant, to your address, but His Highness, probably thinking that the letter to the Consular body was not of any great importance, did not consult me as to its terms. It will not even now be possible to dispense wiih that proclamation as the public have not been officially informed. 4. I have every reason to believe that my colleagues have been addressed in exactly similar terms, as appears most probable from the copy of a letter, with translation, from the French Consul, Maskat, to the address of His High ness, which I have the honour to forward herewith, in duplicate. The letter merely reiterates the French determination not to enforce on their subjects the rules made under His Highness’s proclamation.

(Addressed to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf.) • ; On the 2nd September His Highness the Sultan received from the French Consul a letter which he sent me and asked me to draft his reply. The letter runs as follows“ I have been informed by Menaschi, Agent of Louis Dieu, that he to-day presented bills of lading to Saiyid Kasim, who is in the customs house, for 33 cases of ammunition ex ‘ Ekbatana \ ' On the plea of His Highness the Sultan’s order Saiyid Kasim replied that he could not deliver the goods. At this statement the writer expressed astonishment in the face of his previous letters and says that there is trouble and loss to i rench trade and merchants in this refusal. French Consul demands, relying especially on Article X, Articles XI and XIII of the Treaty of 1844, the delivery to the merchant after the payment of customs dues of the merchandise. The demand, the Consul declares, is in accordance with treaty which has been observed for 68 years by His Highness’s ancestors and the Sultan himself and which is not in the least opposed to the independence of Oman or his relations with other powers. A protest will be entered by Louis Dieu if the Sultan refuses, and loss and trouble from this date will be reckoned against the Government of Maskat, and it will be necessary for French Government to support in full his claims. Please reply. ” The reply should, I would suggest, refuse to deliver the goods, and express determination to enforce the proclamation issued on the 1st September and should state that it is not treaty that affects relations with neighbouring States or threatens the independence of Oman, but the extraordinary liberal inter pretations placed on the freedom of trade by the French, especially in regard to dangerous goods the sale of which in all civilized communities a fortiori France is the subject of careful regulation. 280 Telegram P., No. 927, dated (and received) the 3rd September 1912.

They trust that no untoward incident will arise, as it could not fail to have a most serious effect on the relations of the two countries. “ In spite of the cordial understanding between them, it has been impossible, owing to the unreasonable demands of the French Government, to put a stop to a trade which has supplied uncivilised tribes hostile to this country with arms and ammunition for years past. If all the facts were known they would prove very exasperating to the public here. I need not say that I should be very happy to receive proposals for an arrangement and would consider them in the most friendly spirit, but pending any negotia tions the status quo established by the regulations would have to continue. I would agree to submit the question of compensation to traders to arbitration, but I could not consent to pay compensation, without arbitration, as His Majesty’s Government do not admit that French rights are infringed.” Question has been raised in view of French statement as to sending ship whether it would not be desirable to send further naval force to Muscat.

Bertie (Paris). (No. 6. Africa.) Foreign Office, September 19, 191 £ I HAVE impressed upon French Ambassador that we are bound to support Sultan of Muscat in carrying out new regulations ; our position and prestige in the Persian Gulf would be sacrificed if we did not. In our view regulations, which did not prohibit, but only regulated, trade in arms, were not contrary to French treaty, but if there was difference of interpretation of treaty question should be referred to arbitration. Ambassador said he was sure his Government would not refuse arbitration as to whether regulations were in accord with treaty, but pending this decision regulations should not be enforced. I replied that question would be whether regulations did in practice interfere with the treaty rights of the trade, so as to entitle the traders to compensation. To ascertain this regulations must be enforced, and I again impressed upon Ambassador that we were bound to support the Sultan in this, and that I trusted his Government would not create an incident, or we should be bound to create another. This was, I said, very important. Ambassador cordially agreed that an incident must be avoided, and said he understood me to propose that arbitration should decide whether compensation was to be paid for interruption caused to trade pending the decision of arbitrators; if this was decided in the affirmative an indemnity would be paid ; if in the negative the regulations would continue without compensation. He said he would transmit this proposal to his Government.

Au the interview which I had with honsieur Poincare on tn® th ultimo, which 1 uad the honour to reoort to you in my telegram N* 1 Africa and in ray despatch H° 40 Africa of tuat date, iiis Excellency never suggested an arbitration on the question of the Muscat arras trade. There was consequently no occasion for ne to act on your instructions of the lf&gt;th of the month. Moreover the French Oimrge d* Affaires in Lon don stated at the Foreign Office on the 4th instant (see Foreign Office desoatch N° 65 Africa (3B054/12) of that date) in referring to a previous informal conversation on the sub ject of tne Muscat arms trade that ha should not have men tioned arbitration on that occasion for the French Government desired an aAS*&lt;^|M»MM^not an arbitration. This is quite in aocord&amp;ne with the French system as distinguished from the British custom which generally is to treat questions on their merits. The frQnoh Government fearing an adverse decision at n?*bi trationI arbitration and wall aware of injury wnicu tne uncon trol lea trade in arras in the Persian Gulf causes to us and how anxious we are to come to a sett lenient, intend to avoid arbitration if possible and to drive as n&amp;rd a bargain with us as our necessities naay render it possible for them to exact from ua. They do not take into consideration past unrequited services from us such as the grant to the French authorities of the right of search of British vessels in tor ocean territorial waters for the purpose of facilitating for tnsra measures to prevent the illicit introauction of arms into Morocco for thi tribes in that county which might be used against the French forces* tven v/nen an application is made for the sanction of the French Government to the quotation of a foreign loan on the Paris market they generally make their consent conditional on the settlement by the Foreign Government caneerned of souse j* ranch claim the validity of which is not established or is disputed by such Government., V ''V O' I beg leave to submit for your consideration that His Majesty s uovernment aaouid propose to tli© rencn Govern ment that tne matters at issue between tnem in regard to the Muscat anas trad© should be referred to arbitration, his ajesty* s Governrnont to undertaile to pay cornncnsation if the decision be agadnst them and the French Government to undertake that they will instruct their Consul at Muscat pending such decision to take all the measures that may be necessary to prevent any export of French arms from that i country; I tiiink it would not be advisable to oronose to include in such arbitration either the Jibuti arms traffic or the Abyssinian railway and least of all the claims of Messrs Ochs, for in their case not only is there a strong prejudice against them at th£ Ministries for Foreign Affairs and the Colonies but Monsieur Poincare is himself adverse to them and there might be Parliamentary difficulties in the way of a reference of these claims to arbitration. 1 iiave the honour to be with great trutn find respect.

From—MAJOR S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of my official letter* No. 86, dated the 2nd July 1912, # serial No 134 anc * as directed by Sir Percy Cox in his No. M.—193, dated 1st July 1912, I forward herewith, for convenience of reference, rules Nos. 13 to 17, which have not yet received the formal approval of His Highness the Sultan, although, at ray last interview with him, he said that, so long as he had received the assurances, t Enclosure to Serial No. 91 . contained in the vernacular letter No. 124 M.,f dated the 2nd July 1912, addressed by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to His Highness, of which a copy was forwarded to your address as an enclosure to letter No. 136 M., dated 5th June 1912, from the Political Resident, all the rules were good. May I take this opportunity of asking you kindly to refer to my endorse- t Serial No. 133 . mentj No. 83 of to-day’s date. It is perhaps interesting to note that His Highness also received a copy of this extract from the “ Libre Parole ” and sent it to me. While I think he will probably resent warmly the tone of the article, I am a little anxious as to the effect that the being described as the “ man of straw ” of the English may have upon his determination, as he is so extremely sensitive to any slur on his dignity. Rule 13 .—On the production of the weapon as directed in accordance with the provisions of Rule 12(&lt;?), the Warehouse Superinteudent shall pro ceed to satisfy himself that the weapon is duly marked on the barrel with the official mark of the Arms Warehouse and on the butt with the serial number of issue. If it is found not to be so marked, the Superintendent shall, after marking the weapon with the marks and number of the Arms Warehouse, refer the question of the legality of possession of the weapon to me for orders. The burden of proving that the weapon was innocently come by and not in infringement of the rules of the Arms Warehouse, will lie on the owner and, should he fail to prove innocent possession, the weapon shall be liable to confiscation. Rule 14 .—All owners of any firearms, kept in our territories for personal use and protection, are earnestly advised to bring them to the Maskat Arms Warehouse to be marked with an official number and mark as soon as possible. Within a reasonable period of the publication of these rules, it is intended to alter Rules 12(c) and 13 in such a way that no ammunition will be allowed to issue from the Arms Warehouse except to— (a) holders of rifles or firearms marked with the official mark and number of the Arms Warehouse, (b) purchasers of new rifles or firearms issuing from the Arms Warehouse. Rule 15 .—To meet the needs of traders who may desire to expose in their shops a sample of arms and ammunition for sale, a trader’s license in Form E, Arabic form ( ), can be procured by them from the Warehouse Super intendent. A trader holding such a license will he permitted to withdraw from the Arms Warehouse one sample weapon of every kind of which he may have stocks Iving in the Arms Warehouse under the provision of Rules 1 and 4 7 and 8‘aforesaid, together with 200 rounds of ammunition per sample weapon. This stock of ammunition may be renewed under trader’s license twice a year on the personal guarantee of the trader that it is not for sale bu merely “ practice” ammunition. Rule 16 .—Ihe Warehouse Superintendent shall have power to frame rules for the charge and collection of warehouse charges not exceeding 2% per mensem ad valorem on all arms and ammunition or parts thereof stored in the Arms Warehouse and for the discharge of such obligations, when over o e month in arrears, by the appropriation to the state of an equ^atot^portion the offending goods.2 Buie The Warehouse Superintendent shall frame rules to be approved by me regulating the transfer between traders of arms, ammunition or parts thereof stored in the Arms Warehouse except that—(1) no such transfer shall be valid without the consent of the traders concerned; (2) it shall be reduced to writing and subject to the certificate of the Warehouse Superintendent, to be confirmed by me, that all charges leviable under these rules have been fully paid; (3) it shall be duly registered by the Warehouse Superintendent; and (4) the fees to be charged for the registration of any such transfer shall not exceed Rs. 10 for each such transfer.222 Telegram, No. 879, dated the 22nd (received 23rd) August 1912.

A reply has now been received from the French Consul to His the Sultan of Maskat’s communication stating that he has no doubt independence of His Highness and Foreign Powers {sic), but he see the connection between them and the subject of his letter. He next refers to freedom of trade and limit of duties to 5 per cent., and lays stress on French Treaty of 1844 and fact that without the consent of the signatories of the Treaty it cannot be changed. The French Consul reiterates the orders of his Government and that without compensation it will not admit enforcement of new arrangement. He says that, although His Highness the Sultan will not accept the liability for compensation, rights of France are preserved according to law of nations. I consider reply amounting to non-aceeptance of His Highness’s letter, and that I should now advise the Sultan to reply that question must now rest with French and British Governments in Europe.

I venture to suggest that His Highness the Sultan of Maskat should reply that in his opinion the attitude of the French Government does concern and affect his independence and that the point in issue is clearly one for discussion between two Governments in Europe, as that independence is jointly guaranteed by the Governments of France and Great Britain, and that in similar terms he is informing the British Representative. 233 Telegram P., No. 893, dated the 25tli (received 26th) August 1912.

I have asked the Political Agent, Maskat, for his views on your telegramJ j Serial Ne. 229 . ^96 S., dated the 24th August. Meanwhile I submit the following. The present position seems to be as follows :—Tinder rule 1, arms lyin 0, m Maskat are required to he brought voluntarily to the warehouse ' forthwith ”, which we may agree to interpret as two weeks- Sultan will be justified, after expiry of two weeks, in applying pressure short of violation of domiciles, but under rule 2, the arms will not be liable to confiscation until the expiry of a month. In the same way, freshly imported arms will be taken compulsorily to the warehouse but will not be liable to confiscation for a month. We have always been warned by Sultan of his unwillingness and inability to raid, and confiscate un-aided stores of French dealers who may refuse tof ) 130 ad k at, He dlity for ns, to, 3iij resUltl ' ^ from tie remove to the warehouse their stock of arms and ammunition, hut the follow ing courses would seem to he reasonable ones for him to pursue : (a) To issue a rule or notification to the effect that the sale or removal of arms and ammunition in the town will not he permitted after 1st September except after passing through the special warehouse; and that any Maskat subjects will be severely punished if found to he assisting in the sale or removal of such arms by sea or land. (5) In his reply to the French Consul he (recommended in my imme- • Serial No. 232 . diately preceding telegram*) might add that it was unlikely that the question could he settled before 1st September by the French and British Governments, but nevertheless he hoped that the French Consul would, in the meantime, direct his subjects to comply like others with the general rules and regulations and deposit their stock of arms and ammunition in the warehouse ; that His Highness undertook, on condition of their doing so, of holding such arms in trust, and in regard to them to take whatever action might he decided on by the two Governments in Europe. Sultan would have strong justification for placing a cordon round bazar (?) of refractory dealers if the great portion of owners comply, and for arresting any persons w r ho may purchase arms from them. 1 venture to recall third clause of the Hague award in the French flag ' case in regard to position of French dhows and proteges. 234 Telegram, No. 999, dated (and received) the 24th August 1912.

Prom—The Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Please refer to Cox’s telegram No. 891, dated the 25th August 1912- Although shipments of ammunition and arms which will arrive after 1st September are to be taken direct to arms warehouse, I would remind you that whole of September next is period for depositing existing stocks of traders. I agree to proposed confiscation of consignments which will arrive after Sunday next and property of recalcitrant merchants, but after 1st October only. In the case of subjects of Prench Government, I would suggest that Sultan of Maskat should send a letter to their Consul after 1st Octobe r warning him that as a result of French attitude His Highness is taking such a course, and that if French subjects fail to obey the order, he will, a fortnight later, execute his threat. Equally I concur in proposal hut not until after 1st October that guard be posted round dealers’ stores, and I suggest for your consideration the issue of a proclamation on 1st October warning all subjects of His Highness under pain of fine, &amp;c., if necessary, not to buy arms from recalcitrant traders. While, in my opinion presence of Admiral is indispensable, should Govern ment of France attempt naval demonstration of any kind, I would, until we know whether French propose sending warships, deprecate such strong measures. In such circumstance, I am sure that Sultan would doubtless appreciate Admiral’s presence, otherwise he would be apt to resent visit as an attempt on our part to coerce him. Admiral might eventually reach Maskat about beginning of October next when I shall be prepared to tackle problem of confiscating existing stocks of ammunition and arms. Stocks though large are so far as my information goes very scattered due to merchants, including French, selling and exporting their wares ; successful confiscation will, there fore, require His Highness’s utmost willing co*operation. October visit being normal would not excite remark.

The Commonwealth Government protested strongly against a partition of the new He or ides in August 1903 (the date August 1901 given on page 56 of Cd.3288 is a mistake) and so far as Mr. Harcourt is aware their opinion on the subject is unchanged. Sir E. Grey recognises that no steps for such a partition can be taken without the concurrence of the Governments of Australia and Few beaiand. As indicated aoove it is extremely doubtful whether the Australian Government would concur even in an equal partition but Mr. Harcourt is certain that neither Government would agree to a partition which woula leave the greater share of the group in the hands of the French. _l a.. i, ac . ihe Under Uecretar, of ftate, SOKBIGK Oi’i'ICK.No. ^ and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

Sir, Your Excellency’s most obedient humble Servant, LLE7r~ % ‘ i Telegram to Sir F. Bertie, Paris, No, 4 Africa, Foreign Office, September 14, 1912, 2 p.ra. Your telegram No, 4 Africa (of September ll). Subject to any observations you may have to offer, you are authorised to inform the French Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty^ G-overnment are firmly determined to support the Sultan in maintaining the regulations which in their view, do not infringe French Treaty rights, but merely regulate a dangerous trade - a right enjoyed by every Government, They trust that no untoward incident will arise, as it could not fail to have a most serious effect on the relations of the two countries. In spite of the cordial understanding between them, it has been impossible , owing to the unreasonable demands of the French Govt, to put a stop to a trade which has supplied uncivil ised tribes hostile to thiskountry with arms and airamition for years past. If all the facts were known, they would prove very exasperating to the public here. I need not say that I should be very happy to receive proposals for an arrangement and would consider them in the most friendly spirit but pending any negotiations the status quo established by the regulations would have to continue. In return for this d t^w o uld A a|re^at i irbitmt.on, as H*.M.G.do not admit that French r ights are inf ringed.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 31st August 1912. C&gt;tA^ ' Foreign Secret. Your telegram of 28tli August. Muscat. Your proposals are approved. Extra territorial rights should be carefully respected.From Viceroy, 28th August 1912. [Repeated to Resident at Bushire and Political Agent, Maskat.) Your telegiam of the 23rd August last. Maskat. Political Agent reports that Sultan objected strongly to expression £&lt; to expect him to compensate would be unreasonable in the reply suggested in your telegram of 20th August. Political Agent accordingly allowed him to alter this to “ payment of compensation would be' unreasonable.” This appears unobjectionable. Sultan replied accordingly. Knox telegraphed on 25th August:— “French Consul has now replied to His Highness’ communication stating that he has no doubt as to His Highness’ independence and Foreign Power (sic) but he does not see the connection between them and subject of his letters. “ Next refers to freedom of trade and limit of duties to 5 per cent. “ Lays stress upon French Treaty of 1844 and fact that it cannot be changed without the consent of signatories of the Treaty. “ Repeats orders of his Government and that it will not admit enforcement of new arrangement without compensation. “ He says that rights of France are preserved according to law of nations although His Highness will not accept liability for compensation. 1 We consider Sultan should now be advised to reply, “ Your attitude in regard to my proposed regulation of trade does concern and affect my independence which is jointly guaranteed by Governments of France and Great Britain. The question is one for discussion between those Govern ments, and I regret I cannot further discuss this question with you. I intend to proceed with the regulation of arms traffic as announced. To this end I shall publish on 1 st September an order to effect that sale or removal of arms and ammunition will not be permitted except after passing through special warehouse, and that Maskat subjects will be severely punished if they assist in such sale or removal. I trust you will direct French subjects to comply like others with rules and deposit their stocks in warehouse. I undertake to hold such stocks in trust pending decision of question by two Governments in Europe.” Should modus vivendi with french Government not be reached by 1st September we propose that Sultan should issue order as above, and after fortnight’s grace should order seizure and removal to warehouse of all fresh consignments coming by sea. As regards existing stocks he should place cordon round refractory dealers’ warehouses and arrest all Maskat subjects assisting in sale or removal. In accordance with preamble of t e original notification Sultan should on or about 14th Septembei pu &gt; is i subsidiary notific ition confirming all rules approved by that date.TREATY SERIES.

They declare that they will not obstruct the action taken by France for this purpose, provided that such action shall leave intact the rights which Great Britain, in virtue of Treaties, Conventions, and usage, enjoys in Morocco, including the right of coasting trade between the ports of Morocco, enjoyed by British vessels since 1901.

An Agreement between the two Governments shall settle the conditions of such transit and shall determine the points of entry. This mutual engagement shall be binding for a period of thirty years.

[The Agreements dated October 13, 1904, and January 18, 1905, were published in “ Treaty Series No. 3, 1905.”] Mr. Graham to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—(Received August 9.) My Lord, The Hague, August 8, 1905. I HAVE the honour to report that the Muscat Arbitration Tribunal met at 3 o’clock this afternoon and the Award, copy of which is herewith annexed, was read aloud by the Secretary-General in French and English. As regards (a), the scope of the Declaration of the 10th March, 1862, in relation to the issue by France to certain subjects of the Sultan of Muscat of papers authorizing them to fly the French flag, the Award decides that:— “ 1. Before the 2nd January, 1892, France was entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, only bound by her own legislation and administrative rules.” The date in question is that of the ratification of the Brussels Act, the Court holding that France is, in relation to Great Britain, bound to grant her flag only under the conditions prescribed by Article 32 of that Act. “ 2. Owners of dhows, who before 1892 have been authorized by France to fly the French flag, retain this authorization as long as France renews it to the grantee. “ 3. After the 2nd January, 1892, France was not entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His. Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, except on condition that their owners or fitters-out had established, or should establish, that they had been considered and treated by France as her ‘proteges’ before the year 1863.” The year 1863 is taken as the date at which, in virtue of legislation by the Ottoman Porte, and of the Franco-Moroccan Treaty of that year, the creation of new “ proteges ” was regulated and limited. As regards (6), the nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of the Sultan who are owners or masters of dhows and possess French papers, or are members of the crew of such dhows, and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and immunities affect the jurisdiction of His Highness over his said subjects, the Award decides that:— “ 1. Dhows of Muscat authorized as aforesaid to fly the French flag are entitled, in the territorial waters of Muscat, to the inviolability provided by the French-Muscat Treaty of the 17th November, 1844. “ 2. The authorization to fly the French flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner. “3. Subjects of the Sultan of Muscat who are owners or masters of dhows authorized to fly the French flag, or who are members of the crews of such vessels, or who belong to their families, do not enjoy, in consequence of that fact, any right of exterritoriality, which could exempt them from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. The results of the Award may be summarized as follows :— France may renew the licences to fly the 4 rench flag granted to ownei s of dhows before the 2nd January, 1892. But no licences given since that date are valid, unless the grantee was a bond fide French protege before 1863. Moreover, under Article 2 of (b) the licences in question cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other d row even if belonging to the same owner. Thus it would appear that if one of the licensed dhows were to be lost or disabled, the owner, in order to obtain a new licence, must 11008] ‘l'IiM ■■■■ ■ ■'—' (Official Translation.)

Th^Prraident^cSls on tlie Secretary-General of the Tribunal to read the Award of the Tribunal, which is as follows : The Tribunal of Arbitration constituted in virtue of the “Oompromis” concluded Muscat; f ,v t Dpplaration have arisen in relation Whereas difficulties as to the scope of that Highness the Sultan to the issue, by the Trench li,epu , p re nch flag, and also as to the sKtraaSs &amp;2UVA-- * »»w~ * SZSS *' “ SSto. ./Hi, Highness She Sn.*n hiS S Whereiffte two Governments have agreed by the “ Compromis’’ of the 1 Sth October 1904 that these questions shall be determined by reference to arbitration, ^accordance with the provisions of Article I of the Convention concluded between flip two Powers on the IPth October, 1903 , . i Whereas in virtue of that “ Compromis ” were named as Arbitrators- Bv the Government of His Britannic Majesty, Mr. Melville W. Fuller, Chief Justice of the United States of America , a -n i q And by the Government of the French Republic, Jonkheer A F. de Savornm Lehman, Doctor of Law, former Minister of the Interior m the Netherlands, former Professor at the Free 0Diversity at Amsterdam, Member of the Second Chamber of the States-General; Whereas the two Arbitrators not having agreed within one month from the date of their appointment in the choice of an Umpire, and that choice h^g then been intrusted in virtue of Article I of the “ Compromis to the King of Italy, His Majesty has named Umpire : Mr. H. Lammasch, Doctor of Law, Professor at the University at Vienna, Member of the Upper House of the Austrian Parliament, Whereas the Cases, Counter-Cases, and Arguments have been duly communicated to the Tribunal and to the Parties ; i 1 Whereas the Tribunal has carefully examined these documents, and the supple mentary observations which were delivered to it by the two Parties; As to the first question: Whereas generally speaking it belongs to every Sovereign to decide to whom he will accord the right to fly his flag and to prescribe the rules governing such grants, and whereas therefore the granting of the Prench flag to subjects of the Sultan of Muscat in itself constitutes no attack on the independence of the Suitan, Whereas nevertheless a Sovereign may be limited by Treaties in tlie exercise ot this right, and whereas the Tribunal is authorized in virtue of Article XLVlli ot the Convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes of the 29th July, 1-* 9, an of Article V of the “Compromis” of the 13th October, 1904, “to declare its competence in interpreting the ‘ Compromis ’ as well as the other Treaties which may be invoke in the Case, and in applying the principles of international law,’ and whereas therelore the question arises, under what conditions Powers which have acceded to the General Act of the Brussels Conference of the 2nd July, 1890, relative to the African slave trade, especially to Article XXXII of this Act, are entitled to authorize native vessels to fly their flags; , Whereas by Article XXXII of this Act the faculty of the Signatory Powers to 0grant their flag to native vessels has been limited for the purpose of suppressing slave trading and in the general interests of humanity, irrespective of whether the applicant for the flag may belong to a State signatory of this Act or not, and whereas at any rate Prance is in relation to Great Britain hound to grant her flag only under the conditions prescribed by this Act&gt;; Whereas, in order to attain the above-mentioned purpose, the Signatory Powers ohAhe Brussels Act have agreed in its Article XXXII that the authority to fly the flPlfg of one of the Signatory Powers shall in future only be granted to such native vessels which shall satisfy all the three following conditions :— 1. Their fitters-out or owners must be either subjects of or persons protected by the Power whose flag they claim to fly ; 2. They must furnish proof that they possess real estate situated in the district of the authority to whom their application is addressed, or supply a solvent security as a guarantee for any fines to which they may eventually become liable ; 3. Such fitters-out or owners, as well as the captain of the vessel, must furnish proof that they enjoy a good reputation, and especially that they have never been condemned for acts of Slave Trade; Whereas, in default of a definition of the term “ protege ” in the General Act of the Brussels Conference this term must be understood in the sense which corresponds best as well to the elevated aims of the Conference and its Pinal Act as to the principles of the law of nations as they have been expressed in Treaties existing at that time in internationally recognized legislation and in international practice; Whereas the aim of the said Article XXXII is to admit to navigation in the seas infested by Slave Trade only those native vessels which are under the strictest surveillance of the Signatory Powers, a condition which can only be secured if the owners, fitters-out, and crews of such vessels are exclusively subjected to the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the State under whose flag they are sailing; Whereas since the restriction which the term “ protege ” underwent in virtue of the legislation of the Ottoman Porte of 1863, 1865, and 1869, especially of the Ottoman Law r of 23 Sefer, 1280 (August 1863), implicitly accepted by the Powers who enjoy the rights of capitulations, and since the Treaty concluded between Prance and Morocco in 1863, to which a great number of other Powers have acceded, and which received the sanction of the Convention of Madrid of the 30th July, 1880, the term “ protege ” embraces in relation to States of capitulations only the following classes : (1) persons being subjects of a country which is under the protectorate of the Power wdiose protection they claim ; (2) individuals corresponding to the classes enumerated in the Treaties with Morocco of 1863 and 1880 and in the Ottoman Law of 1863; (3) persons who, under a special Treaty, have been recognized as “ proteges ” like those enumerated by Article IV of the Prench-Muscat Convention of 1841; and (1) those individuals who can establish that they had been considered and treated as “ proteges ” by the Power in question before the year in which the creation of new “ proteges ” was regulated and limited, that is to say, before the year 1863, these individuals not having lost the status they had once legitimately acquired; Whereas that, although the Powers have expressis verbis resigned the exercise of the pretended right to create “proteges” in unlimited number only in relation to Turkey and Morocco, nevertheless the exercise of this pretended right has been abandoned also in relation to other Oriental States, analogy having always been recognized as a means to complete the very deficient written regulations of the capitulations as far as circumstances are analogous ; ., , , T Whereas, on the other hand, the concession de facto made by lurkey that tlie status of “proteges” be transmitted to the descendants of persons who in 1863 had enjoyed the protection of a Christian Power, cannot be extended by analogy to Muscat where the circumstances are entirely dissimilar, the “proteges °i the Christian Powers in Turkey being of race, nationality, and religion different from their Ottoman Rulers, whilst the inhabitants of Sur and other Muscat people who might apply for Prench flags are in all these respects entirely in the same condition as the other subjects of the Sultan of Muscat; „ _. 0/&lt; . Whereas the dispositions of Article IV of the Prench-Muscat Ireaty of 1844 armly only to persons who are bond fide in the service of Prench subjects, but not to persons who ask for ships’ papers for the purpose of doing any commercial business; P Whereas the fact of having granted before the ratification of the Brussels Act on the 2nd January, 1892, authorizations to fly the Prench flag to native [1008] vessels not C■satisfying the conditions prescribed by Article XXXII of this Act was not in contradiction with any international obligation of France; For these reasons, decides and pronounces as follows :— 1. Before the 2nd January, 1892, France was entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, only Itound by her own legislation and administrative rules ; / ~« 2. Owners of dhows who before 1892 have been authorized by 1 ranee to fly French flag retain this authorization as long as France renews it to the grantee; 3. After the 2nd January, 1892, France was not entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, except on condition that their owners or fitters-out had established, or should establish, that they had been considered and treated by France as her “ proteges ” before the year 1863. As to the second question :— Whereas the legal situation of vessels Hying foreign flags and of the owners of such vessels in the territorial waters of an Oriental State is determined by the general principles of jurisdiction, by the capitulations or other Treaties, and by the practice resulting therefrom; Whereas the terms of the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between France and the Iman of Muscat of the 17th November, 1844, are, particularly in view of the language of Article III, “ Nul ne pourra, sous aucun pretexte, penetrer dans les maisons, magasins et autres proprietes, possedes on occupes par des Francais ou par des personnes au service des Frangais, ni les visiter sans le consentement de Foccupant, a moins que ce ne soit avec Fintervention du Consul de France,” comprehensive enough to embrace vessels as well as other property ; Whereas, although it cannot be denied that by admitting the right of France to grant under certain circumstances her flag to native vessels, and to have these vessels exempted from visitation by the authorities of the Sultan or in his name, slave trade is facilitated, because slave traders may easily abuse the French flag for the purpose of escaping from search, the possibility of this abuse, which can be entirely suppressed by the accession of all Powers to Article XLII of the Brussels Convention, cannot affect the decision of this case, which must only rest on juridical grounds ; 'Whereas according to the Articles XXXI—XLT of the Brussels Act, the grant of the flag to a native vessel is strictly limited to this vessel and its owner, and therefore not transmissible or transferable to any other person or to any other vessel, even if belonging to the same owner; Whereas Article IY of the French-Muscat Treaty of 1844 grants to those subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat “ qui seront au service des Fran 5 ais ” the same protection as to the French themselves, but whereas the owners, masters, and crews of dhows authorized to fly the French flag do not belong to that class of persons, and still less do the members of their families; Whereas the withdrawal of these persons from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, would be in contradiction with the Declaration of the 10th March, 1862, by which France and Great Britain engaged themselves reciprocally to respect the independence of this Prince; For these reasons, decides and pronounces as follows :— 1. Dhows of Muscat authorized as aforesaid to fly the French flag are entitled in the territorial waters of Muscat to the inviolability provided by the French-Muscat Treaty of the 17th November, 1844 ; 2. The authorization to fly the French flag cannot be transmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner; 3. Subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, who are owners or masters of dhows authorized to fly the French flag, or who are members of the crews of such vessels, or who belong to their families, do not enjoy in consequence of that fact any right of exterritoriality which could exempt them from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat.

(No. 40 AS I had the honour to inform you in my despatch No. 38^ifrica^oUo-day, reporting the conversation which I had with M. Poincare on the subiect of the traffic in arms through Jibuti, he reminded me that the French Government had refused to adhere to the Brussels Act in the matter of arms. At the close of our discussion on this matter his Excellency informed me with reference to the communication which I had made to him on the 22nd instant that he had examined the question of the arms trade in the Persian Gulf. He found that France has the right to trade unreservedly in arms with Muscat. She derived that right under the treaty with Muscat of 1844 and the treaty of 1862 with England. / The trade is therefore a legitimate one for French subjects and they are entitled to carry it on without any impediment such as would' be thrown iii its way by the Sultan’s regulations, and they have the right to expect the French Government to protect them in the exercise of that trade. The French Government are, however, quite ready to enter into conversations on the subject with His Majesty’s Government as they find the trade in question injurious to British interests, and M. Poincare has every desire to find a solution of the question without delay, but he cannot recognise any right on the part of His Majesty’s Government to deal with it in the manner proposed by the regulations issued by the Sultan of Muscat, who is an independent sovereign having treaty engagements with France. The regulations in question had not been his spontaneous act. They had been prompted to him by the British Government who appear to be treating him as the sovereign of a State under British protection. I told M. Poincare that you had approved what I had said to him at my interview on the 22nd instant, and I thought that it would be well that he should see my report of it. I therefore showed to his Excellency my despatch to you, No. 36, Africa, of the 23rd instant, and I added that you had informed me that His Majesty’s Government had sent two ships to assist the Sultan in dealing with the traders who carry on the traffic in arms as they intend to continue their support to His Highness in putting a stop to it. M. Poincare thereupon observed that such a proceeding would be a very grave It would be an interference with a legitimate French trade with Muscat. one. I replied that what we object to and have taken measures to prevent is the transfer from Muscat of arms, brought into that State, to other destinations where the importation of arms is prohibited. ’That would not be an interference with the French trade with Muscat. As matters at present stand we do not propose to interfere with such trade. M. Poincare went on to contend that His Majesty’s Government have no right to interfere with vessels carrying' French arms either in Muscat territorial vateis oi on the high seas. All that they can legitimately do is to intercept in British waters aims intended for destinations where the trade is of right prohibited. I observed that the French Government appeared to desire to protect a trade which furnished the tribes on the Indian frontier with the means of attacking t le territories of a friend of France. M. Poincare’s only argument m favour ot the traffic was that being a legitimate one under treaty it must be the subject o c iscussion wi i the French Government before it could be abrogated, and compensa ion m some o™ 1 would be necessary for that end. I reminded his Excellency that tie emam so e French Government in the conversations which had taken place la no teen sue i as His Majesty’s Government could accept. . , ,. p tt- M. Poincare further stated that an announcement ot the intention ot His Majesty’s Government to interfere with the French traffic in arms would cause real surprise and ill-feeling in France, and it would consequently te very ci c [2592 gg —4] -u 16SEP1S12r French Government to persuade the Chambers to sanction an arrangement with England for the cessation of the traffic if His Majesty s Government were to take so serious the French Embassy in London on the subject of mv communication to him. His Excellency is. he says, quite ready to have fresh conversations at once with every intention of coming to an agreement, but he cannot accept the mode of proceeding contemplated by His Majesty^Government. i FRANCIS BERTIE.—* ! 1 im 10874 . 1 . 1033 . 2000 — 5 / 1911 . \ From Viceroy, 8th September 1912.

Consul declares demand is m accordance with treaty which His Highness’s ancestors and Sultan himself have observed for 68 years, and which is not in the least opposed to his relations with other Powers or the independence of Oman. If Sultan refuses, Louis Dieu will enter protest, reckoning against Muscat Govern ment loss and trouble from this date, and it will be necessary for France to support his claims in full. Please reply.’ (End of letter.) I would suggest that reply should refuse to deliver goods, expressing determination to enforce proclamation issued 1st September, and should state that it is not treaty that threatens independence of Oman or affects relations with neighbouring States, but the extraordinary interpretation placed by French on freedom of trade, especially dangerous goods, sale of which is subject of careful regulation in all civilised communities a fortiori France.” (Addressed to Political Resident in Persian Gulf, repeated to Foreign). Knox has doubtless replied in terms proposed in our telegram of 28th August, and approved by you. We would suggest that in negotiations with French Government stress should be laid on dangerous character of trade. Analogy of gambling house was used in Lord Morley’s letter of 1st April 1911 to Foreign Office. But arms trade might perhaps more suitably be compared to trade in noxious drugs or explosives, such as petrol, which is carefully regulated elsewhere. From Viceroy, 10th September 1912.

PROTEST BY FRENCH FIRMS. (from our correspondent.) PARIS, Sept. 12. The Temps has received from Muscat a tele gram from two French firms engaged in the irms traffic, MM. Dieu and Goguyer, protesting igainst the alleged violation of French rights ey the Sultan. It will be remembered that the Sultan on June 4 issued certain regulations, which were published in The Times of June 12, and which were to come into force on Septem ber 1. In pursuance of these regulations the Sultan on September 3 confiscated a shipload of arms and ammunition consigned to the firm of Dieu, which had arrived at Muscat in the steamer Ekbatana, and was worth over £6,000. MM. Dieu complain that the Sultan’s attitude not only conflicts with the treaty of 1844 between' France and Muscat and the agree ment of 1862 between France and Great Britain, but that, if his regulations are enforced, they will mean the total suppression of the arms According to MM. Dieu the French Govern ment protested at Muscat as soon as the regu lations were published that it would not recog nize them, as they were contrary to the treaties. A few days later the Sultan announced that he would give notice about September 1 of the date on which the regulations would come into force. The French Government there upon informed the Sultan that it might modify its decision, if he were prepared to grant certam compensations to be mutually agreed upon. This was the position of affairs when the Ekbatana arrived. The French Consul at once protested against the confiscation of the arms, but has as yet received no reply. MM. Dieu urge the Government to compel the Sultan to respect the treaty of 1844, give up the arms confiscated, and compensate the owners. They add that the Irench firms established at Muscat hold considerable stocks of arms and must have time to dispose of them and Se up their affairs, if the trade is to be summarily suppressed.CONFIDENTIAL. !

French charge d’affaires, in reporting to Minister for Foreign Affairs his conversations at Foreign Office, probably did not say that he had mentioned arbitration and laid stress on compensations,'which he had discussed with Sir L. Mallet, and probably reported that compensations seemed likely to be accepted as basis for negotiations, as French charge d affaires, in the conversation recorded in your despatch Iso. G5, Africa, of 10th September, said that he should not have mentioned arbitration in the previous conversation. I think that it is evident that he suggested arbitration to Minister for Foreign Affairs and was snubbed for that idea, but that Minister for Foreign Affairs adopted impression of charge d’affaires that we would negotiate on the basis of compensations. Sir L. Mallet had pointed out to him that if His Majesty’s Government offered an indemnity they would be admitting that they had been in the wrong and had infringed treaty rights, whereas they maintained the exact opposite. There is no record of his having explicitly stated that compensation for French traders could only be granted after adverse arbitration.In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. 3 and address— ^—-—' / O / The Under-Secretary of State, ' ^ Foreign Office, London. r i L. \ t /V v LiiLi? i The Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Undersecretary of State for and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop of the under-mentioned paper.

The Sultan had been behaving in an insolent manner towards the rights which appertained to France by her Treaty with Muscat and the French Government would he obliged to send a ves; el of war thither un less the status quo existing before the Sultan's recent II regulations regarding the trade in arms were establish ed at once.

His Excellency replied that it could not be supposed that Muscat it self could absorb all the arms Imported Into the country. and the placing of the arms in depots with a vitf.v to the regulation of the export trade amounted to an obstacle to and interference with the export of arms in dhows flying the French flag.

No large cargoes of arms are being run, hut, many dhows crossing the Gulf carry a few on the chance of getting them'thnuigh, jettisoning them on meeting with one of the blockadmg vessels 3 Latterly the Government of India has approved applications, which I have put forward, to burn dhows of which the Nakhodas have been proved to have run cargoes of arms on previous voyages, and such action will if con tinued, have a great moral effect and tend to check the insidious form e traffic has assumed. . 4 It is not considered that it will he possible for some time to reduce | the force now employed in the Gulf. Major Craufurd, m his Arms Traffic ' Diary 1st to 12th July (Secret No. 65), states that the arms dealers are remoy- ine arms from Maskat to the Batinah Coast. Major Craufurd has previously reported (vide my letter quoted above) that a dep6t of 6,000 arms has been established at the Sohar, and other depots are known to exist on the Trucial and Katar Coasts. Until the stock at these dep&amp;ts is exhausted, it will not be possible to relax our vigilance, as we may expect that, owing to the rise which will take place in the prices of arms as soon as the restrictive measures at Maskat come into force, great efforts will be made to get rid of the arms wherever it is found the coast is not being watched. 5 As soon as the bonded warehouse arrangement at Maskat comes into force (on 1st September) it should be possible to prevent any export from Sohar by sea, as it is presumed that there will be no objection, m view of the Sultan’s proclamation in Maskat, to the .Batinah Coast being closely watched and dhows searched in Maskat waters, in which case the Mekran and the Bivaban Coast south of Musandam can be cut off. Arms will, however, still be able to go by land to the Trucial Coast, and the whole of the Persian coast inside the° Gulf will require watching. This will not admit of any reduction in the strength of the blockading squadron, and it may be necessary to press for the four additional launches to he commissioned as proposed in my letter of 12th May. 6. The only alternative to this would appear to be to buy up the arms in all the depots. Possibly there may be objections to such a course, but if the bonded warehouse at Maskat can be depended upon to prevent the illicit export of arms from that place, it would undoubtedly he the cheapest method of putting a stop to the trade.u From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 1st April 1911.

R. RITCHIE. [1980 m—2] * Sent to Foreign Office, April 10, 1911.India Office, 1st April 1911 Sir. ^ With reference to your Secret Letter No. 7846, of 3rd March, regarding negotiations about to be opened with the French Government for the ex tinction of all those French rights at Muscat under which the arms traffic is carried on, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs copy of telegrams*' that have been exchanged with the Government of India on the subject. 2. Viscount Morley understands that it will be upon India. But before discussing what India has to offer he desires to place on record the following general observations. 3. He is fully aware that the French rights are secured by Treaty and that they are a valuable consideration, the surrender of which it is not reasonable, as an ordinary matter of business, to expect except in exchange for another valuable consideration. But that is a doctrine which may easily be pressed too far; and in Lord Morley’s opinion a Power that has rendered to civilisation such services as France has rendered has not the right—and His Majesty’s Government should be very careful not to admit any such right to press that doctrine to its extreme limit. Even on the lower plane of an ordinary business transaction the right cannot be admitted without reservation. There is, it is true, a perfectly legitimate trade in arms at Muscat, for the extinction of which the French are entitled to full compensation. But it is important to remember that the legitimate trade would not pay by itself-as is shown by the fact that most of the dealers, when restricted to it by the activity of His Majesty’s ships, have been' obliged to withdraw from the market; impossible to satisfy the desire of the French Government “ that the negotiations should embrace “ a wide field and should not be confined to any “ local exchange of advantages,” and that the burden of payment is therefore likely to fall mainly * To Grovernor-General, dated 29th December 1910.

Abecause his premises were incidentally used for gambling purposes. It is further to be borne in mind that (as has often been stated before) although the distributing agency is mainly, if not entirety, French, the French manufacturing interest con cerned is very small. The figures for the last four years are as follows : — 1906-07. 1907-08. 1908-09. 1909-10. Total value of all arms and ammunition imported into Muscat. 112,338 279,050 237,644 103,862 Value of French arms and ammunition. 5,995 26,343 19,914 15,389 It cannot therefore be argued that the extinction of the trade involves the dislocation of an important French industry i and, m fact, the damage falls far more heavily upon British industries, seeing that the value of arms of British origin for the same four years was 52,327L, 101,432L, 82,017?., and 23,785?. severally. Lastly the value even of the distributing trade has been reduced to an insignifi- cent figure, and will be still further reduced, by the well devised measures of His Majesty’s Navy. 4. Lord Morley trusts that these considerations may be strongly urged upon the French Govern ment in mitigation of damages, and I am now to state what he is prepared, if necessary, to offer in behalf of India :— (1.) Territorial compensation. —(a) In their letter No. 88 (Secret), of 30th June 1910, the Government of India proposed the cession to France of villages in the neighbourhood of Pondicherry, covering an area of about 138 square miles (88,426 acres), with a population of 98,314, and bringing in a revenue of about 2| lakhs (18,333?.) a year. But they regarded the cession by France of Chandernagore and the other French possessions (except Pondicherry) and loges in India as an essential element in any such transaction. These settlements have an area of 88 sq uare miles, and a population of about 99,000. In Lord Morley’s opinion this is a reasonable offer. In 1857, when a similar exchange of territory was under consideration, but no question of Muscat was involved, it was proposed to cede 65 British villages, covering an area of 60,759 acres, with a population of 36,195, and a revenue of Rs. 1,07,712. The difference, therefore, represents the price of Muscat under this head. (6) But from the Government of India’s telegram of 25th March it will be seen that they are now prepared to offer, if necessary, 140 villages, with an area of 216 s quare miles, population 160,000, and a revenue of about 4| lakhs.liamln! lhls ’- Lor d Moriey, who views the w^tl ° Ver ,° f Britlsh Sllb j ec ts to France with extreme distaste, is in no circumstances prepared to go. (-•J Extradition. In this connection I am to invite reference to Mr. Campbell’s letter of tonl beptember last, and to say that his txjrdship is prepared to agree to a modi- c 7 atl ^ or re Peal of Article 16 of the Treaty ! ° ^' e on the conditions mentioned in paragraph 5^ of the Government of India’s better No. 117, Secret, of 4th August last, (o.) 1 oi some years past the French have been anxious to build a railway from Pondicherry I to Tirupapuliyur in British territory. The line would probably divert a certain amount ol trade from British to French ports; and partly for this reason, and partly because of difficulties connected with construction, man agement, and rates, the Madras Government have not been able to accept the proposals of the French authorities. Lord Morley believes that a modus vivendi might be found, and is in communication with the Government of India on the subject. (4.) Direct money payment for existing stocks of arms at Muscat. —It appears from the Government of India’s telegram of 25th March that (leaving out of account certain small quantities lying unclaimed at the Custom house) the estimated value of these is about 18 lakhs (120,0001.). 100,0007. would probably be sufficient to offer as a round sum. \ 5. These are the Indian assets, and, apart from any concessions that Sir E. Grey may have to propose in other regions, Lord Morley is of opinion that the first offer should not exceed (1) (a) a ndJA^Jt being clearly understood that theTcTOST^is innill satis faction of all claims whatsoever, whether of the French Government or of firms or individuals of French nationality or under French protection connected with the trade. If that proves insuffi cient, (2) and (3) should be offered in that order; but (1) (h) should be kept in reserve and not put forward except in case of extreme necessity. 6 Y i- x \ 6 The Government of India mention that the Political Agent at Muscat telegraphed on 4th March that further large quantities of arms and ammunition were arriving by steamer. Lord Morley does not think that any claim can equitably be advanced to compensation for imports made after M. Gambon’s communication referred to m your letter under reply, since it has been open to the French Government to warn those concerned that they would continue to import at their own r isk In this connection I am to refer to para- orarffi 4 of the letter from the Naval Commander- m-Ghief dated 18th February, regarding recentlarge imports of German arms. Germany has no treaty rights at Muscat, and Lord Morley trusts that any attempt to establish a German ‘ interest, whether commercial or political, will be firmly resisted. And with reference to paragraph 5 of the Admiral’s letter, I am to point out the im portance of insuring that the Sultan of Muscat obtains a free hand to prohibit the import not only of manufactured ammunition, but also of the raw material. 7. It| conclusion I am to say that nothing less than the complete extinction of French rights arising out of the Treaty of 1844 and the joint declaration of 1862 is worth any substantial sacri fice of territory, and Lord Morley trusts that the French Government will be under no misappre hension as to the power and intention of His Majesty’s Government to destroy the trade if these negotiations fail. 1 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, (Signed) R.

It is now necessarv to consult r what line should be taken when the French Government make their reply to vour Excellency s representations if they do not ' ' ‘ ‘ 1 ' Majesty’s Government. i . ^ seems probable that they may propose to refer the question at issue to arbitration and. if so, it will scarcely be possible, even if desirable, to refuse altogether to do so. It would be well, however, that, in accepting the principle of aiInflation, we should press them very hard to agree to the arbitration at the same time of the differences between the two Governments on the subject of the Jibuti arms traffic, and the railway from Jibuti to Adis Ababa. Should the Muscat question be arbitrated alone, and a decision be given in our favour, Jibuti is likely to be made a depot for the arms trade on as large a scale as Muscat, and even the ordinary traffic is, as I have pointed out in another despatch, very dangerous to the peace of our possessions in the Soudan and East Africa. It is therefore very important that this traffic should, if possible, be stopped, and we have, in our opinion, good ground for holding that it is contrary to the Brussels Act to allow the almost unrestricted import of arms into Abyssinia, knowing that those arms will find their way into the hands of tribesmen, and equally contrary to the Brussels Act, as was pointed out in 1S93 by Baron Lambermont, to allow the export of arms to places outside the zone from which they are known to be reintroduced within the zone. Moreover, what Baron Lambermont said of export from Jibuti seems to apply really to the passage of arms into the interior, for instance, his conclusion that s ‘ La puissance locale a done I’obligation stricte de ne pas laisser reexporter les armes perfectionnees des entrepots situes dans la zone sans etre assuree que ces armes ne penetreront pas dans les regions de la traite.” It is, therefore, possible that even if the Muscat question be given against us, the Jibuti question would be given in our favour. I have also suggested the inclusion in the scheme of the Ethiopian railway question as this has come to be connected indirectly with the arms question. Mr. Thesiger has proposed that we shall abandon our support of Messrs. Ochs Brothers’ claim, and do cur best to promote the interests of the French railway in return for the co-operation of the French Government in restricting the tiade in arms, which he thinks we shall not otherwise obtain. I he abandonment of the claim does not appear to me to be justifiable, but it would be most useful to arrive at a settlement which would leave the way open for a complete understanding with the French Government in regard to Abyssinia, and even the loss of the case would inng about this end. If we win this case and lose either of the others, it may, I think, be possible to use it as a means of negotiating a compromise. ^ ,, , With regard to Muscat the questions which the arbitration tribunal would have to decide would be first, whether the recent action of the Sultan is an mtrmgement o treaty rights, which renders him liable to ,,ay compensation, second, extent of compensation he should pay to the French overnmen , ? , that they will not object to the new rules if the compens^ion is adeq^teIt possible, also compensation should be limited to the aims c .- die Sultan issued his warning ot the intended re^Mations.^^ l&lt;wllpnnv ™ i™ ac on the arbitration of all of the three questions to have referred, out it it s to Jibuti and Abyssinia, you should press . arbitration of the Muscat question within the limits which we desire. 12592 cc—1] the more strongly tor anf 0 ^ 2 understood that these suggestions are on y Excellency should not take any M.
