BUCKLAND. 13-3-72.j#- CH AFTE R T.—(S ections 1—25.) THE 'CLYDE' AFFAIR. On 9tli October 1869, Syud Naseer bin Thoweynee warned the Moonshee of the Agency of the likelihood of his making a hostile demonstration against Muscat. On 14th October Colonel Disbrowe, Political Agent, Muscat, requested Captain Elton, Commanding H. M. Clyde, to leave his usual anchorage at Muscat Cove and take up a position near the Julalee Port on the south-east of the town so as to prevent the enemy from landing. This he did on October 15th, when immediately without provocation the garrison opened fire on him with matchlocks for the space of half an hour to the imminent risk of the lives of his crew and to the dishonor of the British flag which was flying all the time. 2. Captain Elton reported the matter in person to Colonel Disbrowe. lie also wrote;— ' The firing- was continued after I left the vessel in my gig with the ensign flying and passing close under the walls of the fort to report the matter to yon. I refrained from taking any notice of this indignity until 1 knew your wishes, otherwise we could have silenced them in a few minutes/' Colonel Disbrowe demanded, in the name of Her Majesty's Government, of Khulelee what explanation he, in the absence of Syud Azan, could offer. 3. Khulelee urged that the Clyde had taken up an unaccustomed position, that she was taken for an enemy, and that the firing was without his knowledge or instigation. He also asserted that the Clyde had first attacked the fort, a statement which Captain Elton declared to be utterly false, as also the other assertion that the position was an unusual one. Nor could Captain Elton believe that the Clyde was not recognized, as she had been for six months lying within a mile of the fort and her appearance could not possibly be mistaken; anyhow the firing on Her Majesty's flag at 400 yards was unjustifiable. He added that he was only restrained from resenting the insult on the spot by the knowledge of the unprotected position of the Political Agent and Biitish subjects on shore. 4. Colonel Disbrowe thanked Captain Elton for his coolness under trying _ * . , , ,. , , , K(;Q circumstances, and reported* the whole affair to and'No! 599, dated iGth' October the Bombay Government. At the time of the 1869. . occurrence Syud Azan and Sheikh Salih had pro ceeded to the interior towards Jaalan. The Bombay Government submitted t to Govern- f No. 4G6, dated 30th October 1869. meilt ^ole Correspondence. 5. The Bombay Government forwarded t to Government the Political Agent, Muscat's telegram, which concluded (after # + 18th 0ctober 1869 - giving the main facts as above):— ' Explanation demanded, lleply imperious and false. Matters may come to a crisis, liefer to my previous written warning. I continue in shore. \\ hat are the Government wishes? Major lloss will send me answer across express. Please send out Dalhousie. Ivo use particulars by mail.' 6. The next day Bombay Government again telegraphed to Government: «■ Referring to telegram from Colonel Disbrowe reporting that Clyde had been tired on, Colonel Felly has been directed to proceed to Muscat, and if apology and reparation be not imme diately o-iven, to instruct Colonel Disbrowe to embark and remove British subjects and property. Colonel^Pelly has been cautioned that these instructions have been given on tho understanding that Disbrowe has not been misinformed. Enquiry has been made of Senior Naval Officer at Trincomalee whether any, and what, ships of war at that Station. Letter will be despatched to Aden for the Commander of the first ship of war arriving there, informing him that the services of a small squadron are urgently required, and requesting him to proceed to J ask, where instructions from the A iceroy will mtet him.( 2 ) 7. The Viceroy telegraphed, 19tli October:— ' Has Daphne left Bombay? Where are the other Gun-boats of the Indian Squadron?' and to Naval Officer Commanding at Trincomalee ' What vessels are at your station ?' It appeaml that the Daphne was in Bombay Harbour, the Forte had gone to Suez, no ships of war were at Trincomalee. 8. Accordingly* the Viceroy telegraphed to * - wh l81 ®' the Governor, Bombay ' Send no instructions to Disbrowe. Telegraph again to Pelly to go to Muscat at once. ' If Clyde has been wantonly fired at, let Pelly demand apology and explanation. If refused, authorize Pelly to order Agent to withdraw temporarily from Muscat. But perma nent withdrawal of British Agency very undesirable. 'If Pelly thinks Disbrowe has acted with imprudence or want of judgment, or seems to desire to pick a quarrel, let Pelly replace him at once by another Agent. ' Desire Pelly to use every effort to bring the matter to sueh a peaceful conclusion as is consistent with the honor of the British tlag. ' Tell Pelly that we cannot take any step as to recognition of Azan, or any Ruler of Muscat, until we receive a full report from him as to state of affairs in Oman. ' No ship of vvar at Trincomalee. 'Send Daphne to Muscat, calling at Jask, and support her with one or two small vessels if possible.' 9. The Bombay Government answered as follows:— ' Your instructions mostly anticipated, but w r ill be repeated. No instructions given to Disbrowe, and Pelly instructed to proceed at once to Muscat. This has been telegraphed to Disbrowe. Explanation will be demanded if circumstances, in Pelly^s opinion, justify it, and if not given, relations will be temporarily suspended; but we do not think Pelly should be authorized to remove Disbrowe. The latest dispatches will show that there has been much misunderstanding between them, and that in some respects admitting Disbrowe unfit Pelly has much to blame. No doubt Pelly will report against Disbrowe, and he will be practically superseded until the orders of Government removing him, or Pelly telegraphs. I am quite prepared to remove him under any circumstances, but think it would be very objectionable to give that power to Pelly. The remainder of your telegram answered by my last. Pelly is informed already we (nic) his Report. Our situation as regards vessels of war is most unfortunate.' The Viceroy agreed that Colonel Pelly should not remove Colonel Bisbrowe, but remarked ' the sooner another Agent goes to Muscat the better.' 10. It appeared (on the 21st October) that the Daphne could not be got ready for 10 days, as her engines had been taken to pieces for repairs and she required examination, having been ashore; orders were issued to have her got ready with all speed. Thereupon the Viceroy telegraphed to Sir L. Heath at Suez :— t ' On account of news from Muscat I ordered Daphne to go from Bombay. She cannot start for ten days, can you send one or two small vessels to Muscat? I telegraphed on chance of your being at Suez. Place vessels under Colonel Pelly's orders only.' This the Commodore answered, ' sent Daphne, will give similar orders to vessel next arriving, and the next after if necessary. Cannot place vessels under Pelly.' 11. On 1st November the Viceroy telegraphed to Governor, Bombay :— ' Commodore says cannot place vessels under Pelly. What instructions has Daphne received from Commodore? When does she start?' The Governor, Bombay, replied : — ' Nymph sailed this morning. Ships are not put under Pelly, as I was aware of tenacity of Admiralty as to putting officers of Navy under orders of Indian Government. ' Daphne requested to proceed to Muscat and to act in concert with Pelly; my instruc tions to him sent you by post. Daphne left Wednesday evening.' r( 3 ) rhe Secretary of State was informed * by telegraph of the attack on the • 2oth October 1869.

' His Excellency has entire confidence in the prudence and discretion of Colonel Pellv and has therefore not thought it necessary to fetter him with precise instructions, as he has no doubt that, while he will not hesitate to take such steps as will uphold the honor of his Govern- mciitj he will adopt every means to avoid the necessity of having recourse to force. His Excellency feels sure that you will willingly second him in either course which it may be found necessary to adopt, but requests you to bear in mind that even if it be suffi- ciently shown that the authorities of Muscat have been guilty of the outrage alleged, it is his desire that no hostile measures should be used until all hope of otherwise obtaining redress has failed. T am instructed to impress on you that, in the opinion of the Government, no operations on land should be undertaken unless absolutely necessary, and that no portion of your force should be disembarked. Her Majesty's Gun-boats Clyde and Hugh Rose, of the Bombay Marine, are placed under your orders. ' A piratical attack having lately been made on the town of Bahrein, which led to the plunder of many British subjects and the destruction of a great amount of valuable property belonging to them, it may be considered advisable by yourself and Colonel Pelly that advan tage should be taken of the presence of your vessel in the Gulf to proceed to that place in order to punish the Chiefs implicated in this signal breach of the maritime truce, should you, after careful consideration with Colonel Pelly, be of opinion that the force at your disposal is sufficient to enable you to carry out promptly and completely the objects of such expedition. 1 am instucted to request you will lose no time in communicating with the Government by telegraph, but it is His Excellency's desire that you should take no further steps for this purpose until he has had an opportunity of communicating with tiie Viceroy and giving you further instructions in this respect.' 13. This was answered by Foreign Department No. 1606, 14th November 1869 ' His Excellency in Council does not understand the remark in the 4th paragraph of your letter to Commander Douglas. On the 20th of October precise instructions'for Colonel Pellv's guidance were telegraphed to His Excellency the Governor of Bombay, who replied by tele graph on the 21st, that the instructions had been mostly anti- ' ^ 1S E x # e * e * Cy h - aS • entire . con{i ,: cipated, but would be repeated.

'With reference to your letter No. 466, dated 30th October, His Excellency in Council learns from the public newspapers that the affair at Muscat has been amicably settled, and that the Muscat authorities have made an apology on board the Balhousie. No report to this effect has been received by the Government of India either by letter or telegraph, and I am to request that a full report of what has been done may be submitted without delay.' This was the last letter in the despatch to the Secretary of State, No. 23, dated 16th November 1869. 14. The Bombay Government in their No. 479, dated 10th November 1869, forwarded to Government copies of letters from Colonel Disbrowe and Colonel Pelly. The latter reported his arrival at Muscat on October 30th. He received from Colonel Disbrowe copies of all his letters to the Bombay Govern ment relative to the firing on the Clyde, and had a lengthened interview on board{ '1 ) * The chief are probably the cases ol the Prince of Wale*, '&gt;* Sulhmu, the man whose servant, Haymut, was lately beaten, and Abdool Luteef, whose house was lately searched tor tobacco. il 1P Dalhoime with Sheikh Nasoer, Azan bin Gheis's Secretary. ^ cXnel Pelly gathered the foUowxng parttculars - ^ een the ^ Dlaint on both sides, which have been duly brought to notice, thai all communication had ceased. Whilst matters were in this state the Moonshee of the Agency received information, erroneous as it subsequently turned out, that S&gt;)'ud N aster, the usurper of Gwadur, was about to attack Muscat by sea. On The affair then occurred as related. 15. Colonel Pelly regretted that „ • x* _ Prd/^npl Divibrowe should have altered the position of ' in the state of feelings then oas i ^ ^ an a he consid#s that the place chosen was the Clyde without ™ ^ ,n h less ha&lt;1 [„ in8u lt been offered to Her Majesty's flag, and for an unusual one.

To Colonel Felly's report was 'appended a translation of a letter from Azan bin Gheis without English date, but received OP OctoW the mh IP it he complaiped that Colonel Disbrowe's conduct of business was in , mapper contrarv to the rules of Treaty,' and he hinted that the Agent might lie reporting to his Government what was contrary to facts, for that there was really no oppres^w towards British subjects in Muscat. On the contrary. His Highness ^ ^ anxious for the comfort and ease ' of the poor people. Being unable to find fault w th me m this respect,' he added, 'Colonel Disbrowc took to some other means, the object ot which 1 o not understand, but which he may make the subject of complaint, l .r nistapce he tme uay sent the Gun-boat towards the east fort.'

Colonel Pelly wrote e con ^ ar &gt;' Colonel Pelly's influence was, he thought, by some ascribed to the beliei' that he was re a the Queen.' From these( 5 ) 1&gt;. The letter No. 479, of 10th November, of the Bombay Government, was answered by No. 1656, dated 20th November 1869, whieh ran f ' The Viceroy and Governor-General in Council has very carefully considered the docu ments regarding' the apologies which have so far been received, as well as the letter from Azan bm (xheis which Colonel Pelly received on 30th October. His Excellency in Council observes that m that from Khulelee the excuse is still persevered in that the Clyde was notjrecognized by the match] ockmen who fired upon her. From the statement made by Captain Elton, however, which forms an enclosure to your letter No. 466, dated 30th October last, His Excellency in Council is inclined to doubt whether the matchlockmen could' have been ignorant of the character and nationality of the vessel. She had been lying in the harbour for the space of six months previously, and her ensign was flying during the whole time that the firing lasted. Khulelee has accounted for his apology not being sealed by saying that he did not happen to have his seal by his side at the time that he wrote it. This may possibly be true, but His Excellency in Council would have been glad to have been favoured, both on this point and on the other parts of the correspondence under notice, with the opinion of the Government of Bombay. In a telegram dated 9th November to Colonel Pelly, which was received with some other telegrams unofficially from the Governor by the Viceroy , it appears that His Excellency the Governor of Bombay stipulated that the apology from Azan bin Gheis should not be evasive, but real and satisfactory; that it should be understood as a sincere apology by the inhabitants of Muscat; and that it should be conveyed through the proper channel. It would have greatly assisted the Government of India in coming to a con clusion as to the proper course to be adopted if the Government of Bombay had expressed its views on the adequacy of the apology, as well as on all the proceedings which have taken place in connection with them. ' The Viceroy and Governor-General in Council is of opinion that it would have been better had Khulelee's apology been duly sealed with the State Seal, and had it been submitted by him in person. But as Colonel Pelly on this matter should be the best judge of the spirit and of the manner in which it was tendered. His Excellency in Council is willing to accept it if that officer considers that, despite its defects, no evasion was intended. If it be practicable. His Excellency in Council would still desire that Colonel Pelly should take such steps as he may consider advisable to have the State Seal of Muscat affixed to the document. You are requested to forward a copy of this letter to Colonel Pelly without delay 19. The Secretary of State was apprized by telegram of 20th November 1869 ' Khulelee, in absence of Azan bin Gheis, apologized by letter to Pelly at Muscat on October 30th, and sent deputation on board Balhousie with same object. Formal apology pro mised in due course from Azan bin Gheis. Provided Pelly considers Khulelee's apology in no respect evasive, I have agreed to accept it/ J Syud Azan apologized to Colonel Pelly on 3rd November (No. 506, 30th November 1869, Bombay Government, to Government of India). He said:— ' You have already heard of what occurred on the part of the garrison at Muscat on the occasion of Colonel Disbrowe sending his ships towards the eastern fort to a station which was not the anchorage for vessels. I was not present there; and if I had been, such a thing would perhaps not have happened. I am sorry to be thus made ashamed before the high Government for whom I entertain the greatest respect, and would not wish anything to take place which would give them offence. I have enjoined on the people of Oman and the inhabitants of the towns in general to show every respect and consideration to all connected with that Govern ment. I request that you will communicate this from me to the Government, and state that I beg to be excused and forgiven, and to get their good-will, I have already written to them in detail of what had happened/' This was considered satisfactory and accepted unconditionally. 20. A correspondence by telegraph between Colonel Pelly and the Govern ment of Bombay was kept up between 1st November and 10th November with reference to the insult to the Clyde, the apologies of Khulelee and Syud Azan, the removal of the Arab Commander in the Port, the necessity of proceeding to Bahrein, and the expediency of recognizing Azan's Government. These were all sent up together demi-officially to the Viceroy on November 11th, 1869. 21 On the 10th December, Bombay Government telegraphed :— 'Referring to your letter No. 1656, of November 20th, Colonel Pelly telegraphs the State Seal to Khulelee' s document was offered, but I declined it, because it was an autograph apology from( 6 ) i t from Ruler of Muscat State.

To which the Viceroy replied:— ' If you now think that immediate removal of Disbrowe undesirable as giving a triumph to Muscat authorities, I have no objection to your postponing for a short time, but early oppor tunity of placing another in charge should not be lost sight of when you think it can be safely done.' The Secretary of State was informed t of the t No. 36, dated 30th November 1869. postponement. 25. The Bombay Government (No. 512, dated 24th November, and No. • , , 533, dated 6th December) transmitted several letters + : Snd.^f Ikt^foSr lud from Colonel Disbrowe containing further remarks 26th November 1869. relative to the firing on the Clyde. On receipt the Poreign Secretary wrote :— ' I presume that His Excellency in Council will not desire that any action be taken on this letter from the Bombay Government beyond circulating it. 'The letter from Khulelec, to which Colonel Disbrowe takes such exception, hardly appears to justify the tone in which Colonel Disbrowe writes. We have authorized Colonel Pelly to accept Khulelee's apology if he thinks that no evasion was intended b\ not amxing t e sta . 'We have since authorized him not to insist on the seal being atlixed. We have alst authorized him to accept Azan's apology unconditionally. There the matter ma}/ lest. 'In regard to the other points noted by Colonel Disbrowe, viz. '(1.)—The Prince of Wales' case and alleged outrages upon British subjects in Muscat. ' (2.)—The allegation that the attack on Bunder Abbas was made by sea, the Bombav Government and Colonel Pelly have been respectivelv asked for an opinion and report. 1 he receipt of these may be awaited or perhaps expedited by a reminder.' The papers were merely circulated for perusal. \( V ) C H A P T E R II. —(S ections 26—42.) QUESTION OF RECOGNITION OF SYUD AZAN BIN GHEIS. 1 Government of India wrote to Bombay (No. 1A., dated 23rd October 18G9) J K ' / ' reference to recent reports regarding affairs at Muscat, His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-* lenera] in Council desires me to state that it would be desirable to obtain some more reliable information than that which Colonel Disbrowe, in the present unsatisfactory state of his relations with Azan bin Gheis, appears able to procure. His Excellency in Council accordingly desires that, as soon as one of Her Majesty 's Ships appears in the Persian Gulf, Colonel Pelly should repair to Muscat, remain there some little time, and endeavour to acquire, both at the capital itself and at various points in the Coast, all the information he can. He should report, as distinctly as possible, what the position of Azan bin Gheis really is, whether in his opinion Azan bin Gheis is likely to maintain his rule, and, in the event of his overthrow, what are the probabilities of any member of the late ruling family of Muscat acquiring sovereign power/' 27. To this Colonel Felly's letter to Bombay Government (No. 202, dated 3rd November 1869) was substantially an answer. (Submitted in No. 506, dated 20th November, from Bombay Government.) He invited attention to a memorandum of instructions to Captain Douglas of the Daphne, showing to him how the affair of the Clyde stood on the 1st November, and suggesting what should be the movements of the vessels of war at his disposal against Bahrein. His proposals on the latter head were, to touch at Henjam for the orders of Government and to make that island the rendezvous. When matters had been settled at Bahrein, he was anxious that the squadron should pass down the Pirate Coast from Aboothabee to Has el Khyma, and thence that Captain Douglas should go to Muscat, by which time he hoped that the result of Azan bin Gheis's expedition against the Beni-boo-Ali tribe being known might deter mine the question of his recognition by the British Government. The British subjects in Muscat were very generally questioned by Colonel Pelly as to the inilueDce of the priestly faction on them, and they answered that they had no complaints to make of personal oppression on the part of the Government. They had, however, two grievances :—; 1st. —The Mahometan religious law of debtor and creditor was enforced. 2ndly, —The subjects were forbidden to buy tobacco, and so the interests of British traders in that commodity were injuriously affected. But in this matter, so long as Azan bin Gheis was not authorized, and so long, therefore, as the Sultan was not bound by treaty engagements. Colonel Pelly thought that the British Government had a right to interfere. He did not believe in Colonel Disbrowe's apprehension of violence to British subjects being well founded; but to avoid all risk, during his absence at Bahrein, he left the Dalhousie in the harbour, which was capable, if necessary, of accommodat ing all British subjects. If Syud Azan bin Gheis should succeed in his present expedition in the south, he would be likely to strengthen his authority so consi derably as to be able to keep a firmer grasp on Muscat territory than any other aspirant to power could. There would be still danger from the threatened attack of the Wahabees, which the Ameer of Nejd in all probability would undertake in the hope of recapturing Beraymee and avenging the insult which the unprovoked assault on that fort constituted. The Sultan's adherents did not dread the consequences. There were not supplies or water for a large force, a small one, they urged, would not venture, and under any circumstances Azan bin Gheis had the advantage, as he was able to choose where he would await and oppose the enemy. What the result of the campaign might be the Resident did not dare to foretell. But he did not think that the contingency of such a conflict, which was in the nature of a foreign war, should bar the British Government from acknowledging a Ruler who had been successful in( 8 ) arms in nearly even- ^ T M u 'month' desriite^ many difficulties, and whose chief rival was beyond the sea-s lhe altcnuUive, therefore, in his opinion, lay between recognizing v-'' m ■, o.wi inrlofinitolv Drolon^in^ the present state of affairs.

Notwithstanding A^bin Uheis's improved prospects. Colonel Felly's own predilection was in favor of the rule of some member of the Syud Saeed hraneh, but he di no see what member had a chance of regaining power at present. With despatch No. 203, dated 4th November 1869, Colonel-Pelly sent a translation of A/.an bin Gheis's apology for the firing on tlie Clyde, and m i- mated his opinion that it was satisfactory. Colonel Pelly also announced his departure, with the Ihrphne a.m\ Clyde, for Bahrein. The Nymph and the Rugh Rose were to follow and join him at Henjam. He anticipated the necessity ot a long blockade. 28 The Bombay Government (No. 475, of 9th November 1869) com mented on Colonel Pelly's No. 191, 9th October 1869. They said 'The recognition* of Syud Salem, referred to by Colonel Pelly, is. His Excellency the ine reco^niu . ^ tll i n k S| a warning how we should * When he had been Sultan only a rec .ofrnize Syud Azan in the present state oi iiflairs. He has few months. retained power for a year, but only owing to the interference of the British Government, first, in preventing Syud Toorkee's departure, and secondly, by tor- bidding any operation by sea. But even thus His Excellency in Council consider. Syud Azan s authority so precarious that it would he most unwise to recognise his government at the present moment. «It remains to be seen whether the Wahabec Ameer undertakes operations agamst Muscat md with what result. Under any circumstances, the Governor in Council does not think that 'rrTclgnton would in any way so confirm Syud Ws anthority over the tribes a. to affect in any degree his prospects of successful resistance. The letters, Nos. 625 and 625A., of 25th and 29th October 1869, from Colo nel Disbrowe (in No. 511, 23rd November, from Bombay Government), expressed his opinions on the state of affairs. 29. Colonel Pelly (No. 205, 12th November 1869) reported that he had left Muscat in H. M.'s S. Daphne and arrived at Henjam Telegraph Station. He proceeded— ' Svud Salem, late Sultan of Muscat, communicated with me from Kishm, and desired to visit me at Hem jam; accordingly he arrived by boat yesterday, and has since paid me two unofficial visits. ' He spoke to me at great length concerning the present condition of Arabian affairs, and asked if Government would object to his putting to sea with hostile intent. 1 repeated to tmn the orders of Government on this question, and added that both Syud 1 oorkee and His Hig i- ness the Sultan of Zanzibar had already been required to refrain from any attack by sea. ' Svud Salem stated that friendly communications had passed between himself and the Wahabee Ameer, and that the latter professed to be en route himself towards the Muscat fron- tier But Svud Salem more than doubted whether the Ameer would himself accompany the expedition further than Lahsa, the rather so since the Ameer fears being long absent from Lis own capital, where his brother Saood is still on the watch to supplant mm. 'Syud Salem considered that, if the Ameer himself led the expedition, the Chieftains along the Pirate Coast would probably aid him, and the position of Azan would become critical ' If, on the contrary, the Ameer should send a force under a Lieutenant, it was, in S&gt; nd Salem's opinion, doubtful whether the expedition would succeed. ' As regards the position of Azan, Syud Salem was of opinion that he (Azan) had been unexpectedlv successful. He added that this success was due in great part to stratagem, but he admitted that, in regard to the majority of the Muscat territories, Syud Azan s position was more than ordinarily strong.'% ^5 IS d ( ^ ) 30. On 8t]i December 1869 Pelly telegraphed from Anganm : i fas Azaii writes and Major Boss confirms Azan's success over Beui-boo-Ali. 1 believe he ' H es a Jman^ and has only to meet possibility of external war with Wahabees wherein chances are even. Azan s government popular among Bedouins, but disliked by townsmen. My own stedtast views are known to Government in favor of the old branch, but circumstances change with time, and 1 am unable to advise better than recognition of Azan; at the same time my acquaintance with Arabs would not permit me to commit myself to predicating permanence in any - la &gt; arrangement whatsoever. The only advantages in recognizing Azan now instead of ereatter are that Her Majesty's Ships of War are present to represent our power, and that by recognition we close irritation with unrecognised Government. My letter No. 202, 3rd -November, summarises my estimate of situation.' 31. The Government of India acknowledge No. 506, of 20th November 1869, of Bombay Government, with the following remarks and instructions:— '2. His Excellency in Council concurs with Colonel Pelly in considering that the apology of Azan bin Gheis, dated 1st November 1869, for the outrage on the Cly/de^iH satisfac tory, and accordingly authorizes Colonel Pelly to accept unconditionally. The apology would no doubt, have been more complete if the State Seal had been attached 'to it, as suggested in my letter No. 1656, dated 20th November, with respect to the apology from Khulelee; but His Excellency in Council is of opinion that it is now perhaps unnecessary to insist on this. ' Excellency in Council approves of the action of Colonel Pelly in leaving the Dalhousie in the Muscat Harbour during his absence at Bahrein. ' 4- In his letter No. 202, of 3rd November, Colonel Pelly reports that, from all he can learn, our subjects at Muscat have no complaints of personal oppression to make against the priestly rule. Colonel Pelly, however, gives no information as to the feelings entertained by the subjects of Muscat towards their present Government; but he considers that if Azan bin Gheis succeed in his expedition against the Beni-boo-Ali tribe, he will hold the territories of Muscat with a firmer grasp than we could expect from any other aspirant to power. What may be the chance of Azan permanently retaining his rule in the event of a W T ahabee invasion, Colonel Pelly is not prepared to say; but he states that, under present circumstances, no member of the Syud Saeed branch has a reasonable chance of regaining power, or would be more likely to retain it against the Wahabees than Azan. Under these circumstances, he is of opinion that matters are come to a point at which we have simply to elect between recognising Azan or protracting indefinitely the present unsatisfactory state of affairs. ' 5. His Excellency in Council observes from your letter No. 475, dated 9th November, that His Excellency the Governor of Bombay in Council considers Syud Azan's authority so precarious that it would be most unwise to recognise his Government at the present moment. No opinion is given in your letter under reply as to how far the later information supplied by Colonel Pelly may have influenced these views of His Excellency the Governor in Council; nor do you express any opinion in your letter No. 511, of 23rd November, on the less favourable report of Azan^s position and prospects made by Colonel Disbrowe. His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council would have been glad if he had been favored with a reply to my letter No. 1A., of 23rd October, and with the opinion of the Bombay Govern ment, based on the latest and most reliable information, as to the probability or otherwise of 'Azan bin Gheis maintaining his rule, or of his being supplanted either by a member of the late ruling family or by any other Chief or Power. a 6. Judging, however, from such information as has been laid before him, the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council is of opinion that the time is approaching when it will be necessary to take some steps for the formal recognition of a Government in Muscat. In a telegram received on the 9th instant. Colonel Pelly states that, in his opinion, the Government of Azan is popular with the Bedouins, but is disliked by the people of the town. This information, however, is not in sufficient detail, nor is its bearing on the permanence or otherwise of Azan's rule sufficiently clear, to enable the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council to decide on the expediency of formally recognising the Government of Azan. His Excellency in Council, accordingly, desires that, after the operations at Bahrein are concluded. Colonel Pelly should return to Muscat and endeavor to make himself acquainted with the feelings of the people of Muscat on the subject of Azan's rule, as far as opportunities of quietly obtaining information may present themselves. Should Colonel Pelly be of opinion that there is nothing in the internal affairs of the Government of Muscat to render it probable that Azan may be soon dethroned by an internal revolution. His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council, on receipt of Colonel Pelly's report, would not be indisposed formally to recognise Azan bin Gheis, and to authorise Colonel Pelly to inform Azan, or, in his absence, Khulelee, the Deputy Governor, at an official interview, that His Excellency in Council has watched with interest the establishment of the power of Azan bin Gheis, which has at length given hope of a settled Government within the Muscat territories, and that His Excellency in Council has much pleasure in continuing with him those relations of friendship which have so long subsisted between the British Government and the Muscat State.( 10 ) . a 7 }[i s Excellency in Council does not overlook the possibility ot Azan bin Gheis sustain ing reverses at the hands of the Wahabees; but His Excellency in Council concurs with Colonel Pellv that the fact of a menaced war with a foreign power ought not to deter us trom the recognition of a Chief who has succeeded in establishing his authority and maintaining himself as de facto Ruler for a considerable time; and who is the only Chief of whom it can be said that then-' is at present anv reasonable expectation that he will be able to maintain his power The continuance of our Ag^it at Muscat in the exercise of Consular and^political pow( mi Colonel Pellv to pursue would be only a more open and explicit declaration of an acknowledg ment already indirectly made. ' 8. His Excellency in Council does not share the opinion expressed by Colonel Felly that, under present circumstances, and until Azan bin Gheis be formally recog-mzed as Ruler of Muscat, he is free of treaty engagements towards the British Government. 1 he treaties m which the British Government is directly a contracting party with the Muscat State must be held to be in full force, notwithstanding any changes in the internal constitution of the Muscat Government or in the person of the Ruler. It is impossible that our treaties can be considered in abeyance while we have continuously maintained a Resident Agent at Muscat and insisted on the rights and privileges which are secured to us by these treaties. ' 9. With respect to Colonel Felly's remarks on the interdict placed by the Muscat Government on the sale and use of tobacco, I am to observe that, although we may by friendly remonstrance point out the impropriety and hardship of such restrictions, we have no right to insist on the rescinding of the order which does not interfere with any rights secured to our subjects by treaty. ' 10. A copy of this letter will be sent to Colonel Felly direct.' 32. The above letter closed the series of papers despatched in No. 4, 18th January 1870, to the Secretary ol l^tate. Paragraph oi this despatch concluded— ' Svud Azan has now been successful in his expedition (against the Beni-boo-Ali tribe) ; but we have deferred any formal recognition of his Government, until we are in possession of a more detailed and satisfactory report upon the state of affairs at Muscat, which we expect shortly to receive from Colonel Felly.' 33. Colonel Disbrowe (No. 688, 6th November 1869) reported that an attack against Zanzibar was being plotted at Muscat; and again in his Nos. 708 and 712, of the 11th December, on the same subject and of the forcible clipping of mustaches in Muscat by Arab sepoys acting conjointly with Muthowas. 34. The Bombay Government were requested (No. 96 F., 13th January 1870) to ascertain from Colonel Pelly what foundation there was for these statements. The Secretarv of State was apprized* of the- * No. fi of 1870, dated 2oth Jan. ^ 11 rumour. 35. Colonel Disbrowe (No. 733, 25th December 1869) submitted his latest intelligence :— 'A dissension has actually occurred amongst the members of the Muscat Government. Khulelee has left Muscat with his family and proceeds, as I am told, to Somaeel, being on bad terms w ith both Azan and Sheikh Salih.f Ibrahim's feelings, + - I am not satisfied on this pomt ag j understand, are better towards Khulelee than Azan's. Syud Azan continues sick; some say very sick. ' Muscat is quiet, but I dare not predict regarding the future. ' I hear Sheikh Salih threatens to make a descent upon Gwadur after the Eed; probable port of departure from Muscat shores would, according to rumour, be Birka. Colonel Pelly was asked to report. 36. The Secretary of State was informed in No. 9 of 1870, dated February 1st. *37. Syud Azan had returned to Muscat on December 14jth under a salute. 38. The despatch No. 17, of 22nd February 1870, to the Secretary of State, recurred to the matter of Syud Azan's recognition :— ' Although we were of opinion that the mere fact of threatened hostilities with the Wahabees ought not to deter us from recognizing Azan, if we were satisfied that his authorityJ_ mmmmmmm —IHMIIWM JWULUiUlllllllilUJJ.LItUILFt S™.

'It will be in the recollection, of Government that a few weeks ago a Dutch corvette similarly visited Muscat and saluted the Muscat white flag. As I hope to amve on the Arab Coast a few davs hence, I postpone any further remarks' ' 40. From Colonel Pelly's letters of 29th March and 8th April in Nos. 134 and 147, from Bombay Government, it seemed that there was more probabi lity than ever of Synd Azan being firmly seated in power. He wrote: ' As regards the Chiefs of the Littoral, it appears that, when Syud Azan took Beraymee, he entered into alliance with the Aboothabee Chief, and paying him a portion of the tribute! which previous Sultans of Muscat had paid to the Wahabee Ameer, secured the aid of the Aboothabee Chief in the protection of the Beraymee frontier. ' Syud Azan, thus strengthened by Aboothabee, next proceeded to threaten the remaining • Chiefs of Debay, Shargah, Oj m an, . of . Littoral. These in turn (« above stated, Ommulgawin and Rasel Khyma. entered into a dctensive compact. Syud Azan hearing of this compact refrained from attack; but feeling apparently assured of Aboothabee's fidelity, and of the Wahabee's complications, confided Beraymee to the charge of a relative, and himself returned to Muscat. ' Meantime, the compact of the Littoral Chiefs was scarcely entered' into when one of the subscribing parties, viz., the Chief of Shargah, turned traitor in favor of Azan. Thereupon, the remaining subscribers to the compact compassed the peaceable expulsion of the Shargah Chief and replaced him by his relative, Ibrahim, who is at this moment visiting me as Chief of Shargah. ' The question arises, in what way do all the circumstances above sketched, and which are purely of the nature of a contest by land, affect our interests or notice ? ' The direct answer is, that these circumstances affect our relations with the Muscat State, the stability or otherwise of Azan's power, and more immediately the question whether we should or should not recognize Syud Azan.' 41. He also remarked :— ' It is probable that the Muscat authorities would prize our recognition principally on the following accounts :— ' \stly. —By being recognised by us, the status of the Muscat Government would be improved, both abroad and at home, while the public mind would cease to mis apprehend our relations with other aspirants to power; ' Indly. —Recognition would probably be considered to imply restoration of Gwadur, and the other outlying Muscat territories in Mekran; also, perhaps, our good offices in respect to a release of the Bunder Abbass districts; and ' K&gt;rdly. —A recognised Ruler of Muscat would probably infer that the arbitrament of the late Earl Canning would secure to him the Zanzibar subsidy; and this is a question in which the vassal Chiefs of Oman are interested, for this subsidy is a source whence those Chiefs are benefited by the Muscat Ruler.' 42. The Bombay Government telegraphed on 20th April 1870:— ' Following m'essage from Colonel Pelly :—' I have received the following from Major Way: —2nd April. Symptoms of dissension between Sala and Khulelee; Sala declined to go south to collect troops, alleging he did all the work and Khulelee got the pay, and that reward promised and expenditure incurred for past assistance had not yet been received; Syud Azan, Ibrahim, and Sala go to Fuluj to-day. Khulelee remains here/ By later advice, 11th, Acting Political Agent reports that dissension has been made up, but a coolness remains.' (see despatch to Secretary of State, No. 31, of 27th May 1870, in the Chapter on Syud Toorkee's return to power.) The subsequent history of Syud Azan is comprised in the Chapter on Syud Toorkee's return to power.C 12 ) C H A PT E R 111.—(S ections 43—58.) WAHABEE ADVANCES ON BERAYMEE. 43. On 29th January 187^ the Bombay Government telegraphed 'The Gulf mail just in leaves little room for doubting that the Wahabees are actually on thp march for Beraymee. It seems also that they have prepared boats, loosely stated at 100, to co -operate with land force. We have only Clyde in the Gulf and at Muscat. I $hall send Colonel PeUy back in the Dryad, if possible, as soon as she can be got ready. 44. The Foreign Secretary wrote a summary of the question and his opinion, dated February Oth, 1870: ' From the Bombay Selections regarding the Persian Gulf, it appears (117) that the Fort of Beraymee was built by the Wahabee General Syud bin Mootluk, and was held by the Wahabees till the decline of their power, when it was taken possession of by the Naecm tribe, who inhabit the surrounding country. It is really the key to Oman. ' In 1845, when the Wahabee forces were marching to demand tribute from Muscat, the Fort of Beraymee again fell into-the hands of Syud bin Mootluk, and ilif ( hicis of the Naeem and other neighbouring tribes tendered their allegiance. The Hennas Chief reduced the Fort of Beraymee and defeated the Wahabee troops m 1848, but the Wahabees recovered it m the following year and appear to have held it ever since till it was taken by Azan bin (jheis m June last It was always considered as the Wahabee outpost towards Oman, and held by a Wahabee Governor, and in 1853 Syud Thoweynee, then Chief of- Muscat, agreed to the perma nent occupation of Beraymee by the Wahabees. ' During the recent contest for power in Muscat, Suleyree, the ahabee Lieutenant of Beraymee, was pledged to the side of Syud Salem. He was murdered, however, by the Chief of Shar-'ah on 7th April last year. On his death the Naeem tribe, according to Colonel Disbrowe,* who ' complained bitterly of oppression suffered at ♦ Proceedings, August 1869, No. 170. ^ hands of Sidcyree, the late Wahabee Lieutenant, resolved in their minds how they could free themselves from the Wahabee yoke, and resorted to the expedient of inviting 'Azan to take possession of Beraymee. Azan and Khulelee not being the men to allow the grass to grow under their feet, the offer of the Nacem was accepted.' The proceedings of Azan were most probably hastened by a peremptory demand made on him by the Wahabees for payment of tribute. At any rate, the result was that Azan marched on Beraymee with about 1,500 men, and took it on the 18th of June after a very slight resistance. ' On 2nd August Colonel Disbrowe wrote :—' So far as I can see and judge, Beraymee was gratuitously and unjustly invaded by Syud Azan, and Azan must look for Wahabee retaliation.' ' From the telegram received from Bombay it appears that the W ahabees are now really marching to recover Beraymee, and that they have prepared boats, loosely stated at 100, to co-operate with their land forces. The question is whether this is, or is not, a breach of the maritime peace which will justify our interfering to prohibit the co-operation by sea. « Now, in the first place, it is to be remarked that although in 186G the Wahabee Ameer gave us a written declaration that he would not ' injure or attack the territories of the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government, especially the kingdom of Muscat, further than in receiving the zukat (tribute) that has been customary of old,' yet this agreement can, of course, give us no ground for remonstrating against any attack provoked by the hostilities on the part of Muscat. The engagement is therefore wholely inapplicable to the present case. ' In the next place it is to be noted that neither the Ameer of Riad nor the Sultan of Muscat is a party to the maritime peace. We have, however, of our own authority declared our determination to prevent, by force of arms if necessary, any party at Muscat or elsewhere from undertaking warlike operations by sea; but we have also declared that these orders will not prevent the Muscat Government from sending munitions of w ar from one port in Muscat territory along the unbroken Muscat Coast line to another Muscat port, provided the vessels remain constructively within Muscat territory by never going beyond gun-shot distance from the beach. ' Now the case of Wahabee boats co-operating for the reduction of Beraymee seems very different from that of Muscat above referred to. It is not stated in the telegram where the boats are to sail from, where they will probably land, and by whom they are manned. I have been unable to ascertain precisely how far the Wahabee Coast line extends. In the map attached to his memorandum on the Wahabees, Wheeler only brings it to the west of the promontory of Katar, quite 350 miles to the west of Beraymee. At any rate whether this intervening coast line is actual Wahabee territory or only subject to Wahabee influence, it is( 13 ) IreHnlw 7 %® eni y a ^ Joasmi and other tribes, upon whom the terms of the maritime peaee except bv kndinJ? 16 f 0 ^,? 0 mlles from the sea-coast, and cannot he reached from the wa of pfacc 7 h ff o,Td a b^u,tffi K 0CCCUpied . by tribeS 10 the IWl »8~t « 3 ? ^ ™ «Pon these tribes to prevent their coast fine from the Ameer aud ' th&lt; ' retor \ should equally be justified in remonstrating with thmA w , makl ! lg such use of ' Md in preventing him from doin» so even though he is no direct party to the maritime peace. • g ^ e e the C^7^' 3 3 8T ® at di ®' !reno ? betw een the transport of munitions of war along the Coast lor the purpose of storing and garrisoning a fort, and the transport of such munition^ ^Wch Z 0 ^Ttn1h at,? t m V r —ingThe one is a 'precautionary meagre CJ1 may really be in the interests of peace and the prevention of hostilities, the other is directly aggressive and provocative of hostilities. spTirHni ther . efor % we should b e quite justified in calling on the Ameer to abstain from dmg a force against Beraymee by sea even it it never go beyond gun-shot from the shore.

He does not seem vet to have left Bombay He might now be directed to return to the Gulf with the AW. or the Daphne, or both, taking Muscat on the way.' * Tel. No. 23 op ., 7th Feb. 1870. 45. The Bombay Government was asked *~- a Have you any information to show where Wahabee boats are likely to start from, and where likely to land ? Is coast line and country between Kateef and Aboo Debay allied with or teudatory /jf. Ameer of Iliad, or are tribes inhabiting it quite independent. Can you quote any precedent for our interference in Persian Gulf between two States who are not parties to maritime truce ?' 46. This was answered on the 10th February:— The ahabee boats aie likely to start, some from Kateef, which is a AVahabee port, and others fiom the Guttur Coast, and to land at some point between Aboothabee and Shargah. The chief port of the Guttur Coast is Wukra, belonging to the Chief, Mahomed bin Salehj who may be said to be independent, though he pays an annual sum to Bahrein, a portion of which goes to the Wahabee Ameer. ' Shargah belongs to the Joasmee tribe who, as regards religious tenets, approach nearly to the Wahabees, though politically they are independent. The Beniyas tribe inhabiting the coast line adjacent to Aboothabee would not appear to be allied or feudatory to the Wahabees. The Chief of Aboothabee, who is at the head of the Beniyas, has always been closely allied in interest to the Syud Saeed branch of Muscat. The Beniyas tribe are stronger on land than the Joasmees, and, therefore, exercise considerable influ ence over the surrounding Bedouin tribes, but the Joasmees are more powerful at sea. ' The British Government has always been adverse to the extension of Wahabee influence in Oman. No precedent can be quoted of actual interference between the Muscat and Waha bee powers by our Government, but it has always lent a moral support to Muscat in the differ ences of that State with the Wahabees by sending vessels of war to the Arab Coast when hos tilities threatened, and in one instance (in 1865-66 when the late Syud Thoweynee undertook to resist the Wahabee Ameer) guns and material of war were supplied to the Sultan by our Government. ' The latter policy of the Indian Government has been, however, to forbid operations by sea in the Persian Gulf or Gulf of Oman to any power whatsoever. * ' In June 1868 the late Viceroy directed the prevention by force of any operation by Muscat against Persia, and, of course, would similarly have resisted any operation by Persia against Muscat. Similarly the Zanzibar Sultan has been told that operations by sea against Muscat would not be permitted, and the Government at Muscat has been prevented attempting to regain Gwadur and Charbar. The maritime truce affects only the smaller Chiefs on the Littoral; neither Muscat, Persia, nor the Ameer of Eiad are parties to it.' 47. The following on the 7th February came from Bombay :— ' Following telegram received:—' Wahabee force approaching Muscat. Tribes in Jaalan southward are generally holding back. Appears at present doubtful if Azan can raise any suffi cient opposing force/ Telegram ends. My instructions of February 3rd were, to observe strict neutrality between contending parties, and to interfere with no operations by land, as force only sent to protect British subjects and property, and to maintain maritime truce by force if necessary; if thought necessary to alter these instructions, it will be best to do so at once, as three days will be lost in going to Jask, which is 150 miles beyond Muscat. Bullfinch reported to be ready on Wednesday.' D( 14 ) These instructions to Captain Douglas were approved. 4.8 Maior Way writing from Muscat on January 21st, reported that nien and money were hemg collected but slowly by Azan bin Gheis who was endea- ZthTto recruit in Burka. His firm adherents, Ibrahim bin Gheis and Sheikh SaHh^were at the s^e pSce, but their success was no better than their Chiefs. V rumour had reached him, for which he could not vouch, that the Hem-bro- Vii against whom the Imaum was lately victorious m Jaalan, had again lebelled, bad rescued some men of their tribe who had been taken prisoners and had refused to co-operate with the Iraaum against the Wahabees. letter is also sent, in which the Ameer of Nejd commuiucated to S^d Salem, the Ex-Imaum. his advance against Oman, and promised to reinstate him. From the date of this letter, which must have travelled, if authentic, from the Ameer's camp through Kishm to Muscat in three days, Colonel Pellv was inclined to doubt the fact ol its having emanated Jj Wahabee Ameer, and inclined to the belief that it was the handiwork o v Salem or of Hajce Ahmed. Major Way could not state tlie P° slt ' 0 ' j 1 '', Waliabee Army at the time that he wrote, all he knew being that it had e Lahsa. Colonel Felly, writing at Bombay on the 31st ot January, on the strength of information received from Gwadur and Busbue, icpicsen &lt; being at Guttur, and Sheikh Saleh as being in Jaalan. Azan bin (rheis, he added, was endeavoring to obtain the support of the Chief of ^boothatee. This Chief was, unlike the rulers of Nejd and Oman, a si^na &lt;iiy o f time trace. His principal port was well-situated for the landing ol troops intended to operate against Beraymee, and preparations were on toot at Kateel for an expedition by sea to co-operate with the land forces. Another report, to which Major Way was not able to attach full credence was that an amnesty had been granted to all of the .Naeem tnt)C who ''n return to their allegiance to the Wahabees. This was the tn )e or ' protection against Wahabee aggression Azan bin Gheis took up arms last jeai and stormed Beraymee. Khulelee by the latest account was at Muscat. 49 The Bombay Government forwarded* fur- • No. 55, 14th February 1870. ^ Muscat news i n detail I ' According to Sheikh Nasecr, the Wahabee force, variously computed at two to five thousand men, and again at ten thousand men, was within five days of Beraymee. zan m Gheis had met with no support from the fighting tribes of the south. He had with him certainly not more than two thousand men. Some were inchned to put the strength of his followers so low as six hundred. The Chiefs from Ra.s el Khyma to Debaye were not hostile to the Wahabee Ameer; the Chief of Aboothabee, though suspected of playing a double game, was likely to remain neutral. It was expected that the myaders would experience no check at Beraymee. In such case their next move would be in all probability to . ohar, and lence a passage by sea to Muscat might be attempted. To prevent such an attempt. Major W ay urged on the Bombay Government the necessity of letting him retain the/W/We, which the latter had telegraphed for, if her presence was not absolutely requuvd at lusca . e - tm e had ordered at Guttur a hundred vessels from his own coast for the embarkation of his troops. Syud Salem had expressed his intention of joining the W ahabees, but had not by the late, account left Kishm.' 50. This information was sent to the Secretary of fetate in ^No. 17 of 1870, 22nd February. Inter alia, it briefly recapitulated the e\ ents : ^ ' The advance of the Wahabee Ameer upon Beraymee, as reported in the enclosures of this despatch, has somewhat altered the complexion of affairs. According o re a es * ( 1'°* which we have received from Muscat, dated February 4th, the Ameer of Kiat ac • a with a force probably not less than two thousand, or more than five thousan men, an within five days' march of Beraymee. He had granted an amnesty to all t e aeem n x of Beraymee who may return to tlieir allegiance to the V\ ahabees, and had dec are is m c i tion of marching on the town of Muscat itself after reducing Beraymee. At ie a er p a e it was anticipated that he would meet no check. The Chiefs from Ras el Kh^ma o ej.ne had shown no signs of hostility to the Wahabces. Syud Salem had expressed is in en ion o joining the Ameer's army, but by the latest account had not left Kishm. On the o ei an , it is reported that Azan bin Gheis has not been successful in collecting men ant mone},( 15 ) and that the Chief of Aboothabee, on whose support he had counted, was Ukely to remain neutral, it is also rumoured that the Beni-boo AH, against whom Azan was lately victorious m Jaaian, have rebelled and refused to co-operate with him against the Wahabees.' 51. Colonel Pelly, then at Government House, Calcutta, on the receipt 01 telegram from Muscat, reported (22nd February 1870) u On the whole, the Muscat Wahabee quarrel seems to be approaching its solution. And I would respectfully suggest that I return to the Gulf with all convenient speed, and with des- cietionary power to recognise Azan or otherwise, according as circumstances may seem to require ; any recognition should be in writing, and should explicitly declare all questions of detail. Treaty, Convention, or claim to territory, to be reserved for subsequent discussion. ' Meantime, I would propose addressing the subjoined telegrams to Major Smith and the Assistant Resident at Bushire. ' To Major Smith, Angaum : f Proceed with Kwangtung to Bahrein and rendezvous Clyde. I doubt the Ameer molesting. If he do, prevent any boats arriving touching the island. If absolutely necessary, address a letter by direction to Ameer informing him that I am instructed to maintain the maritime peace, and am embarking for the Arab coast. If all seem quiet at Bahrein, leave Clyde there and proceed in Kwangtung along Arab coast, warning all parties gainst breach of truce, and informing them of my approach. From Arab coast return to Angaum and report, and look out for mail steamer/ ^ 52. These instructions were approved, and Colonel Pelly was requested to proceed to the Persian Gulf with all convenient speed, and invested with dis cretionary power to recognize Azan bin Gheis or otherwise as circumstances might seem to require, but with the explicit reservation of all questions of detail. Treaty, Convention, or claim to territory, as suggested, and provided that the advantage of Azan's recognition were not neutralized by this reservation. (Reported to Secretary of State in No. 19, 15th March 1870.) 53. On 5th March Major Way telegraphed :— ' Muscat quiet. Syud Azan writes, 1st March, from Beraymee, f Sheikh Zaeed of Aboo- thabee has arrived and sworn friendship and promised to oppose Wahabees. Mahomed Ali Naeem sworn allegiance and promised Littoral Chiefs should visit me at Sohar. Sha'nt visit coast, but shall return to Sohar when arrangements finished for protection of Beraymee. Wa habees appear to be still at Guttur. Not believed here that Wahabees can now come by land, and half of war tax has been returned. Can't say at this distance if attempt will be made by sea. Amulgavine Chiefs cousin and Wahabee emissaries arrived at Kishm, and Syud Salem left for Amulgavine with them on 23rd.' 54. On 21st March Colonel Pelly wrote - 'All accounts concur in stating that the Wahabee Ameer is still at his own fort of Ojair as already submitted. His Highness probably hesitates to leave the Aboothabee Chief in his rear, and his advance is, no doubt, rendered more difficult through the want of rain and consequent poverty of drinking water along the line of march. ' The alliance between the Aboothabee Chief and Syud Azan, and the fact of the latter's return to Muscat, tend to show that Azan's position is increasingly strong.' 55. On 2nd April 1870 Colonel Pelly telegraphed:— ' Wahabee Ameer still in his own territories. Doubt if he will attempt Beraymee this year. Bahrein proceedings have had good effect. All quiet down to date. Clyde still at Bahrein watching Wahabees.' 56. Colonel Pelly reported on 8th April (in No. 147 from Bombay Go vernment, 25th April 1870):— 'The Wahabees. It appears that some months ago the Wahabee Ameer collected his forces in the neighbourhood of Lahsa with intent to attack Beraymee. He communicated with the Chiefs of the Littoral as per margin, in view to their co-operation or neutrality, and these Chiefs with the exception of Aboothabee, returned conciliatory answers, but the Wahabee Ameer was deterred from further movement by the following considerations « \ s l t That rain not having fallen, water and grass were not available for his horses and men along the line of march; ' Indly. That the combination of the Aboothabee Chief with the Muscat Sultan rendered the march more hazardous; ' 3vdly. That the Ameer, conscious of having harboured one of the Bahrein pirates and of havin„- received the Bahrein plunder in his territories, feared that, sooner or later, we should demand satisfaction from him at his ports—Ojair and Kateef; and ' Uhly* In a minor degree, the Ameer was suspicious of intrigue on the part of his rela tives at his capital, Riadh.( 16 ) ' Influenced by the above considerations, the Wahabee Ameer refrained from marching, and the season is now so advanced that it is doubtful if he will attempt anything this year. The most recent report is to the effect that he is already returning towards his capital. (See despatch to Secretary of State, No. 31, of 27th May 1870, in the Chapter on Syud Toorkee's return.) 57. On 7th May 1870 Colonel Pelly continued ' Several communications 1 have recently received concur in stating that the Ameer him self has returned to his capital, and that Nasir -bin-Mobarck, the pirate Chief, who escaped from Bahrein, has sustained a defeat at the hands of certain of the inland Wahabee tribes. Some of the reports allege that Nasir -bin-Mobarek himself was killed in the fight, while other reports are to the effect that he fled, and that nothing certain had since been heard of him.' ' p,S. Since writing the above I have received a letter from the Bahrein Chief, in which he states that Nasir-bin-Mobarek was killed. It appears further that the defeat of his tribe (the Howajir) was complete.' 58. On 8th January 1871 Colonel Pelly telegraphed ' Reports of Saood^s victory, capture of leader of Wahabee Ameer's forces, and death of Wahabee Ameer, Abdoolla, confirmed. Saood's success beneficial to interests of Bahrein and coast line.' CHAPTER IV.—(S ections 59—67.) MARITIME PEACE IN THE PERSIAN GULP AND SEA OP OMAN. 59. In connection with the Wahabee advances on Bareymee arose the question of the preservation of the maritime truce. 60. On receipt of the telegraph of the 29th January 1870 from Bombay, which was as follows:— ' The Gulf mail just in leaves little room for doubting that the Wahabees are actually on the march for Beraymee. It seems also that they have prepared boats, loosely stated at one- hundred, to co-operate with land force. We have only Clyde in the Gulf and Dalhousie at Muscat. I shall send Colonel Pelly back in the Dryad, if possible, as soon as she can be got ready.' the Foreign Secretary asked of Bombay Government— Cf Have you any information to shew where ahabee boats are likely to start from, and where likely to land ? Is coast line and country between Kateef and Aboo Debay allied with, or feudatory of. Ameer of Riadh, or are tribes inhabiting it quite independent? Can you quote any precedent for our interference in Persian Gulf between two States who are not parties to maritime truce ?' 61. Commodore Heath also wrote on the 9th February 1870 :— ' His Excellency the Governor of Bombay has recently requested that a Man-of-W ar may be sent to Muscat, with instructions to protect British interests and to prevent by force any infringement o£ the f maritime truce/ ' I beg to submit, for Your Excellency's consideration, the necessity of defining, for the guidance of Naval Officers who may now or in future be employed in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf, the precise meaning of the term maritime truce and the geographical limits within which it is to be maintained. ' There is at present much uncertainty upon the subject, and I have been informed that whilst some of the Political Officers in the Persian Gulf consider that any carrying of warlike stores by sea for any purpose whatever would be an infringement of the truce, there are others who would allow of such transport, provided the vessels remained during their voyage within a distance of three miles from the beach. ' The original instructions from the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, under which I act, imply that the ^maritime truce' is confined to the Persian Gulf, and the draft instructions recently approved by His Grace the Duke o£ Argyll bear the same interpretation, whereas during the recent disturbances at Muscat, the Sultan has been held to be bound by that truce with respect to Muscat and Gwadur, both places being outside the Persian Gulf.'( 17 ) 02. The Viceroy's opinion was :— ■nnccacc/^ ^ ^ difficult to decide without knowing whether the Ameer of Riadh really has State^ 10nS !ri sea - coast at all or not, or whether Kateef is merely an allied or a feudatory telegram does not say where the expedition has been organised. If it is to proceed lorn neai Kateet to any part of the coast opposite Beraymee, it can hardly do so without going out or sight of land and getting across the deep indents and bays. Politically speaking, our interest cannot be improved by the Wahabee Ameer establishing' a paramount influence upon the coast of the Gulf or in Oman. 1 he information at our disposal is so very scant that it is a difficult matter to decide w nether this expedition ot boats ought to be stopped by force or not.' 63. The Foreign Secretary's note reviewed the history of the question :— ' Our first general Treaty * with the Arab Chiefs on the southern shores of the Persian * Treaties, VII., 249. Grulf was concluded in 18-20. The object of it was to put down plunder and piracy, but no attempt was then made to interfere with acknowledged wars between the tribes. An acknowledged war was defined in the Treaty to be a war 'proclaimed, avowed and ordered by Government against Government/ Under the cloak of acknowledged war, however^ piracies were regularly committed, more particularly during the season of the pearl fishery. The Chiefs were, therefore, induced, in 1835, to bind themselves not to engage in hostilities by sea for a period of six months, on the understanding that the British Government would not interfere in their wars by land. The results of this agreement were so good that the Chiefs were easily persuaded to renew it the following year for eight months. Thereafter, it was renewed annually till 1843 when it was f Treaties, VII., 258. prolonged for ten years, f and, finally, in 1853 was made perpetual. J This Treaty provides that there shall be a Ditto 2o9. complete cessation of hostilities at sea between the subjects of the subscribing parties; that in the event of aggressions being committed at sea by one subscriber upon another, the injured tribe should not retaliate, but refer the matter to the British authorities in the Persian Gulf; and that the British Government should watch over the s t. f vtt 9 peace of the Gulf and ensure at all times the due observance of iea us ' '' ' the Treaty. In 1861 the Chief of Bahrein became bound§ by similar engagements. ' The Chiefs who are bound by these engagements are— ' 1. The Joasmee Chief of Ras el Khyma or Shargah. ' 2. The Beniyas Chief of Aboothabee. ' 3. The Boo Filasa, Chief of Debaye. ' 4. The Chief of Am'algavine. ' 5. The Chief of Ejman. ' 6. The Chief of Bahrein. ' But though these are the only Chiefs who have subscribed the engagements, we have, as guardians of the peace of the Gulf, in practice extended the terms of the Treaty to all acts of aggression by sea. 'Thus, in the instructions of 11th December 1868 to the Bombay Government, we consi dered ourselves ' justified, by our supremacy and position in regard to affairs in the Persian Gulf/ in preventing both Syud Salem and Syud Toorkee from making an attack on Muscat by sea, although Muscat is no party to the Treaty of Peace. On the 9th January 1869, also, we told the Bombay Government by telegraph that ' all naval operations by any party at Muscat or anywhere else should be prevented by force of arms, if necessary/ These instructions were again repeated by telegraph on 23rd and by letter on 28th January, and again on 10th February. ' In the same way, when the Sultan of Zanzibar wished to fit out an expedition against Muscat by sea, his Envoys were told by the Government of Bombay that no exception could be admitted to the orders of Government for the preservation of the peace at sea. ' In regard to the orders about Muscat, however, we have declared || that, while they would applv to a vessel putting out of the Muscat port to the outly- II c « l01 «; 1 ^ A foJ ; o' ing territories of Muscat, such as those on the Mekran coast, a mrove'd in letters to Government! they would not apply to vessels going with munitions of war Bombay, No. 1076, dated 4th August, f r om one port of Muscat territory to another, provided (1) id No. 1177, dated 23rd August 1869. pl ac es lay on the unbroken coast line, and (2) the boats rever left what is constructively Muscat territory, i .e., gun-shot distance from the beach. ' Further when Bunder Abbas was recently captured by Sheikh Saeed from Hajee Ahmed the latter begged that Sheikh Saeed might be called to account, because he had come by sea • and we thought the matter of sufficient importance to make enquiry about it. E( 18 ) 'We l.avc no copy of tl.e instructions referred to in Commodore Heath's letter. But the \\e nave no toj y ther ,. ul „i ven) if correctly described, is, in our opinion, too interpretation oi tin ma ■ ■ I . ^ ..

The Hon'ble Mr. Stephen's legal opinion was as follows ' I am inclined to agree with Mr. Aitehison as to the definition which he susgeetsof 'the sphere of our protectorate,' to use his own language, but wc must face the fact that to issue with a definition for the instruction of Naval Officers is a mere ^^whTch ca. it is altou-ether distinct from the maritime truce established by the 'ruit v ot \ o4 } vvh ch apply only to the Chiefs who signed it and their successors. 1 think that our conduct with regard to Muscat and Zanzibar, referred to in the note, is to be explained and defended on the broad 'round that it is our right and duty not merely to punish, but also to prevent piracy, and that the most, and indee/the only, effectual mode of doing so is by prevent^ maritime raids which practically are sure to degenerate into piracy. I should lay 1 jwn ^ l8 ^ j. ? broadly and take the responsibility, when necessary, of acting upon it, and think t le i proposed by the Secretary for its application judicious. „ • i \ ' I do not think, however, that it is in our power (except in a case of special emergency) to give wider instructions to Naval Officers than those which they have already received from the Government at home/' 65. The order in Council, 16th March 1870, was 'To lie over till Azan is recognised. Whole question then to be reviewed for submission to the Secretary of State.' 66. The Secretary of State was informed in despatch No. 32, of 27th May 1870 - 'In forwarding, for Your Grace's consideration, a copy of a letter from Sir Leopold Heath, dated 9th February, we take the opportunity of inviting the attention of Her Majesty s Govern ment to our position in regard to the coasts of Mekran, Oman, Arabia, Somalee, Zanzibar, &amp;c. 4&lt; Of late years we have been.gradually assuming a position with regard to the maritime affairs of this enormous line of coast somewhat similar to that which we are by 1 reaty engage ment bound to maintain within the Persian Gull. ' It is for Her Majesty's Government to consider how far that interference which has partly been necessitated bv our efforts to suppress the Slave Trade, partly by our occupation of Aden, and partly by our relations with Muscat, is to continue and be maintained. ' We are disposed to think that it would be almost impossible to recede altogether from the position which we have assumed, and to limit our interference to the Persian Gulf only; but, at the same time, there is (as in the cases reported in our No. 259. dated 5th August 1809. despatches noted in the margin) some risk lest our friendly So. S S ™ ntTiTlu relations with Turkey, Egypt, and the smaller States on these coasts may be endangered. ' We invite attention to the subject, because it is possible that Her Majesty's Government may not be fully aware of the extent to which we are committed to the preservation ot the maritime peace on a line of coast extending from Kurrachee to the morthern limits of the Mozambique Channel.' 67. The question arose again after the alfair of the Quantung (see Chapter on Quantmig affair). CHAPTER V.—(Sections 68—71.) THE 4 ' BULLFINCH' AFFAIR. 68. On 19th March 1870 Major Way at Muscat telegraphed to Colonel Pelly:— ' Bullfinch's boat fired on from Julalee. Explanation demanded. Shame and regiet expressed by Khulelee. Governor of fort imprisoned, and garrison dismissed. Khulelee informed that matter must be referred to Government. Azan returned and force dismissed, and says Wahabees are at Hissa and will not come; and trusts in Aboothabee's assistance; and Syud Toorkee on mail; and all quiet at present.'( 10 ) M«W W^ 1 Pelly T 0t \ (i11 No - 11() ' 22n(l Marcl i 1870, from Bombay) that ^ a PPearcd to have proceeded with all care in the matter. 6J. On 31st March 1870 the Bombay Government telegraphed :— on to-day : ' Acting Political Agent reports that firing reoorts fW ^ v! was Wlthout kllowled g e or consent of authorities. Commander of Bullfinch X. of th^ 111 11S iT ni T ,17 ? 1 SU i t t0 fla ^ was .^t intended/ but that fort was carrying out Svud A70 n ^ 0r ] 1 V' / () boats having lights after dusk. In above opinion i concur, annpni T r de facto ^ Government, has sent me written apology with State Seal (governor of fort already imprisoned and garrison removed. Acting Political .^considers Muscat territory is quiet, and Azan strong and confident; but that he is much annoyed at return of Syud Toorkee under British flag. Trade reviving, and Major Way satis- ed with general conduct of authorities. I respectfully solicit instructions as to whether Govern ment deem present arrangement of firing difficulty satisfactory, and as to whether there are any ircsh instructions regarding recognition or otherwise. Syud Toorkee said to be at Bunder Abbas, and VV ahabees still m their own country. Bullfinch will await reply at .Task station.'' 70. The matter was reported at length in Colonel Felly's No. 44, of 29th March 1870 (in No. 131, Bombay, 13th April) :— a Having yesterday arrived at Muscat I communicated with Major Way, the Acting Poli tical Agent, and with Captain Lodder, the Officer Commanding Bullfinch, and learned from tliem that they considered that no insult had been intended to our flag. Captain Lodder read to ln e an extract from a report which he had already addressed to the Commodore in these terms; and he further favored me with a letter, copy of which is appended, and in which he writes as follows:— I beg to inform you that I am of opinion that it (the firing) was not intended as an insult to the flag, but carrying out the rules of the port relative to all boats having lights after dark. I also believe that the people in the fort were not aware at the time that it was a boat belonging to this ship. ' The Acting Political Agent reports as follows :— No. 175, of 16tll March 1870. , . ' Fl ' 0m ® hei '? h N f ^ '!' U, ? ere ! h f the 8rin ? &lt;&gt;» the Copy appended with appendices. t&gt;oat was not on v no t with the knowledge or consent of the authorities, but contrary to their orders and wishes. 'After I had received these' communications, Sheikh Naser, the Agent of the Muscat de Translate and copy appended. f acto Government, called on tfie, and renewed to me the expla nations and expressions of regret already tendered to the Acting Political Agent. He also brought to me from Syud Azan, the de facto head of the State, a letter of apology with the State Seal attached. The Governor of the fort had already been imprisoned and the garrison removed. ' I replied briefly to Syud Azan's letter expressing my extreme regret at the occurrence, adding that I was glad to receive his apology, and that I would telegram proceedings to Govern ment. At the same time 1 verbally impressed on Sheikh Naser, in a decided manner, the graveness of the complications which might arise out of such accidents. ' My own impression is, that the firing had taken place without the knowledge of the Muscat authorities, and that no insult w T as intended. It appears that a rule had some consider able time ago been established and notified to the effect that between gun-fire and sunrise all boats passing to and fro in the harbour should carry lights. But the rule does not ap'pear to have specified whether by gun-fire was to be understood sunset, or the eight o'clock evening gun. And the time when the Bullfinch's boat was passing was intermediate between sunset and eight o'clock. The Acting Political Agent is now specifying that it is to be understood that boats should carry lights between sunset and sunrise. ' Bullfinch is now proceeding to the Jask Station with a telegram on this subject, copy of which I beg to append. ' I respectfully trust that the above arrangement of the firing difficulty may be deemed satisfactory by His Excellency in Council.' 71. (See despatch to Secretary of State, No. 31, of 27th May 1870, in th^ i chapter on Syud Toorkee's return.) CHAPTER VI.— (S ections 11 —150B.) RETURN.OF SYUD TOORKEE TO POWER. 72. In their telegram of 31st March 1870 the Bombay Government said ' Svud Toorkee said to be at Bunder Abbass, and Wahabees still in their own country.'( 20 ) In reply to Government of India, tliey said that- • nn pvt^ress permission from Bombay Government to return to the -—-'' ni Mml ' 7 o On the Cth April the Government of India called on the Bombay Pnvr f/ment a-aln to the same effect, and asked what were the circumstances of £ departure—they repeated their former answer. 7 . Colonel Felly visited Bunder Ahbass, and on 2nd April telegraphed that Syud Toorkee had gone to the Arab Coast, but his success was improbable. 75 On 10th April, Colonel Pelly again i 2sr.s&amp;jsG.i.. ..•&gt; ^ The Government of India answered i i- v&gt; ^ ^no-Tiifinn of Azan do not require modification, unless, in «Previous orders regarding recognition 01 , I , S eriouslv the aspect of your opinion, Syud Toorkee's appearance on Arab Coast has altered seriously the aspec t ot affairs.' 76. The Government of India (No. 858P., dated 26tb May 1870) wrote to the Bombay Government 'The arrival of Svnd Toorkee at Muscat in an English Mail Steamer lias apparently given . l tlu. i.art of the Museat authorities, that he is supported bv the British rise to the Mid, p opposed to entertain, of renewing cml war for the Government in the proj^ wmcn n^ , p^ ^ ^ ^ accountS) Synd Toorkee'seems tu'have little chance of gaining adherents to his cause! He has no means, and according to « J th lnnl X whom Colonel Pelly ouestioned on the subject, he may for want of resources ho^v have to ret'ire from his pr«ent position at Dehaye. lint, whatever his intentions may he H should be ehwly ,iilimat«l to the Muscat Government that the British Government has fZGuH hould h to 5 inform him thai the British Gaverument can neither help h^m with money, nor assist him in any way in his des.gns against the present Government of Muscat.' 77. The situation at Muscat was fully described, and the questions arising therefrom were submitted in despatch to Secretary ol State, &gt;«o. 31, of 27t - &lt;} 1870. . '2. When last we addressed Your Grace a collision between the Azan bin Gheis seemed imminent. The Wahabees were known to have ^ed l. hsa u. ^on- siderable force with the intention of endeavouring to recover Beraymee. craft on a Uige scale was being held in readiness at the ports of Ojair and Katerf and Azan b.n Gh^as busilv engaged in enlisting recruits in the districts ot the liatma , 1 Aboothabee greatly strengthened by the open adherence to his cause of the Sheikh of AbOTthahee, one of the most powerful of the Chiefs of the Arab Littoral This alhance, c ' u P f .'' th ^ want of water Ud forage along the line of m «eh, and the fear lest his relatives m|ht tete advantage of a protracted absence from Riadh to intngne against him, induced the ' ahah«. Ameer to refrain from further advance, ahhough assured of the nentrabty of ^c Chiets d Ejman, Debaye, Shargah, Amulgavine, and Eas el Khyma. By Oie latort , , fallen back with his troops on his capital. Aian bin Gheie, having left the C ic , ' ■ t ,. ( i a to watch his interests near Beraymee, and having dismissed his own troops an rn portion of the war tax, returned to Muscat, and has (since been hear o in ' ' a mW i r province of Jaalan. It is not unlikely, as Colonel Pelly remarks, that the 1 a ,, ^ may at some future day renew his attempt to retake Beraymee, and to compe e p • from Muscat of the tribute which has now been for some time withheld. In or P all danger of war appears to be at an end. It would indeed be difficult for im o field for some months to come, as the support of those Chiefs who have not rejec 1 tures could not be depended upon till the pearl fishery season is over. '3. Towards the end of last March we were informed by telegram that^thc of the Julalee Fort had fired on a boat belong-ing to Her Majesty's Ship Bulljinc • ' c ore details were not communicated to enable as to form an opinion on the case, an we p „ delayed the issue of orders till we were in possession of a detailed report from 0 ouf ^ ' who had previously been instructed to visit Muscat for the purpose of making hinibe g^n - .( 21 ) , on^pnm^r the feelin ^ s of the people towards Azan bin Gheis. The firing has proved, i J 0 f ^ h ^ ve b f' Provoked by an omission on the part of the crew to complv with a ♦ l , s an in 8' ^gj^lation of the local authorities that every boat moving in the harbour shall carry m * (Sic.j a ll §5 t between sunnse and sunset * The act was neither authorized by, nor known to ^ ^ mem ^ ers of the . Muscat Government. Ample apology has been made, and j , If (xovernor of the tort has been imprisoned, and the garrison dismissed for their share in the $ Wfcak a i ' . Lhe Comman(ier of the Bullfinch is convinced that no insult was intended. Under BlUilS I these circumstances, we have accepted the explanation given by the Muscat Government as sa- tistaetory, and iiave expressed our regret that so grave a complication should have been risked by the neglect of a British Officer to observe the ordinary rules of the harbour. ■Hi* i , B % , resu ^ the enquiries which Colonel Pelly has been able to make during his recent visit to Muscat shows that trade is reviving, and that the authorities are conciliatory in their demeanour towards our Agent, and desirous of -promoting British interests. The general ^5!I:.: opinion is, that Azan bin Gheis is more firmly established than any of his immediate predeces- sggnguaftp hh HPI i I sors, and that his rule is acceptable to his subjects. According to Major Way, the Political Agent, he has made all the tribes own his authority, he is more tolerant than formerly in matters of religion, and the country is gradually settling down under his Government. 1 For the present his rivals do not seem to have power of injuring him. Syud Salem, whom he j , deposed, wanders from place to place along the Littoral without a party, and without'the means of raising one. Colonel Pelly is not at all certain that Syud Toorkee, who lately, of his own accord, left his asylum at Bombay for Bunder Abbas and went thence to Debaye, will be able to enlist the support of those Chiefs of the Littoral who have declared against Azan bin Gheis. Ij), u,,He has applied to us for a loan, which we have declined to grant. Abdool Aziz, who in January last made an ineffectual attempt on Gwadur, has since arrived at Bushire without resources of any kind. In conversation with Colonel Pelly, he has frankly admitted his own failure, and has declared his opinion that neither he, Syud Salem, nor Syud Toorkee, has at present any chance against Azan bin Gheis, who has visited every part of the Muscat territories as a conqueror, has refused to give tribute to the Ameer of Nejd, has enforced the payment of the revenue, has enlisted recruits, and has been acknowledged by the people as Imam—a title which they refused to Syud Saeed. Abdool Aziz was further of opinion that Azan bin Gheis, far from being in danger of an attack from Syud Majid, might easily make a successful invasion of Zanzibar. It is true that there have lately been open differences between Khulelee and tat ii itab'£ Sheikh Saleh, both of whom are members of the Council of the Muscat State. But ill-feeling Bntki fe: v it between these men has often existed before, and, so far as we can judge, their dissensions have lIlfMkff- •' uot hitherto endangered the interests of their ruler. On the occasion of their last dispute, Azan bin Gheis was able to effect an outward reconciliation, and immediately afterwards to leave the capital for his southern dominions. Prom this we gather that he himself had no fear of evil consequences to his administration from the quarrel. ' 5. Major Way has drawn our attention to the recent presence of a Dutch corvette and a French gun-boat at Muscat—the former of which saluted the (K Muscat flag, whilst the latter would have paid a similar com- pliment had it not been contrary to rule for her to salute with the small armament which she carries. He has represented that the opening of the Suez Canal will, in all probability, lead to frequent visits of the vessels of European powers, and has : ^ , y t suggested that if we delay the recognition of Azan bin Gheis as the de facto Ruler of the W Muscat territories, the Imam may be disposed to secure the interposition of some other power. Colonel Pelly is of opinion that the Muscat Government ,• n enelosiire to No. 134, from Bombay wou ld at the present time value the recognition of the British taWft' Government, dated 14tli April 1870, J I 1 , . . ±1 J » . . ° ; w A ® Government; but he believes that such recognition would nil ; probably be considered to imply the restoration, through our good offices, of 'Gwadur and the other outlying Muscat territories in Mekran/ a renewed lease of Bunder Abbass and its depen- dencies, and the continued payment of the Zanzibar subsidy. 6. As reported in the enclosures of our Secret despatch No. 4, of 18th January last, we 1^,10^: are of opinion that the continuance of our Agent at Muscat in the exercise of Consular and ggtofc Political powers, the acceptance of apologies from Azan bin Gheis for the outrage committed by his subjects on the Clyde, and the assertion from time to time of the rights and privileges ft tk ^ '''' which are secured to us by our treaties with Muscat, are of themselves a qualified recognition ^ of Azan bin Gheis as the de facto Ruler. At a later date, under the circumstances stated in our despatch No. 19, of 15th March, we invested Colonel Pelly with discretionary power formally to 'f recognize Azan bin Gheis, or otherwise, as circumstances might seem to require, but with the explicit reservation of all questions of detail. Treaty, Convention, or claim to territory. Circum stances have not permitted Colonel Pelly to avail himself of the discretion given him to make i an open an d explicit declaration of our recognition of Azan. In our opinion, however, the ^j me i s approaching at which the recognition of Azan, if it is to be made at all, can be no longer delayed; and our recognition of his Government ought to be accompanied by some declaration of policy on our part, and an intimation whether we intend to maintain existing treaties and engagements with the Muscat State, or which of them we propose to abandon, and which to maintain. In our letter to the Bombay Government of l 23rd December 1869 ^ p i( 22 ) 4(ip , ur despatch No 4, of ISth January 1870) we have expressed our opinion that the treaties, n which the British Government is directly a contracting party with the Muscat State, must ' he l d to be still iu force, notwithstanding any changes in the internal constitution of the Muscat State, or in the person of the Ruler. On this important question, however we have not vet been favored with Your Grace's decision. \\ e feel that the formal recognition of Azan's Government mi-ht lead to embarrassment and difficulty, unless we are in full possession of the views of Her Maiestv's Government on this and the other subsidiary questions, which, as ilreadv observed are certain to be raised as the immediate consequence of any formal act of reco' . nition We have therefore directed the Resident to return for the present to Bushire, and to await our further instructions before taking any overt action in the matter. ' 7 We have already on several occasions represented that, before formally recognizing \zin bin Gheis it is essential that we should be placed in possession of Your Grace's final decision regarding the Zanzibar subsidy. We have also explained fully the reasons which have led us to consider that the payment of the subsidy is still binding on Zanzibar, and the dis astrous consequences likelv to result, not only to the reputation of our Government, but to the peace of the Persian Gulf and the prosperity of Oman, from any countenance given to the Sultan of Zanzibar in the evasion of the just demands of the Muscat State. We need there fore only now remark that, since the date of our last despatch on this subject. No. 17, of 22nd February 1870, nothing has occurred which, in any respect, induces us to modify our views. ' 13 Similarly in our instructions of 11th December 1868 to the Bombay Government, we considered ourselves justified in preventing both Syud Salem and Syud Toorkee from making an attack on Muscat by sea; and on the 9th January 1869 we informed the Bombay Government bv telegraph that ' all naval operations by any party at Muscat or anywhere else should be prevented bv force of arms if necessary.' These instructions were again repeated by telegraph on 2.'3rd, and by letter on 28th January, and again on 10th February, as reported to Your Grace in our despatch No. 61, of 24th l ebrftary 1869. ' 14. In the same way when the Sultan of Zanzibar wished to fit out an expedition against Muscat by sea, his Envoys were told by the Government of Bombay that no exception could be admitted to the orders of Government for the preservation of the peace at sea. ' 15. If in recognizing Azan bin Gheis as the Ruler of Muscat we were authorized to intimate to him that the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy, so essential to the prosperity of his Government, will be continued, and that we intend to maintain the same relations with him as with former Rulers, we anticipate little or no ditliculty, by the exercise of our legitimate influence in preserving 1 le peace in the Sea of Oman on which the prosperity of the neighbour- ^ ing countries so intimately depends. Without such an intimation our recognition would be of little or no value, and unless we are prepared to secure to him the subsidy, to which not only he, but every Chief in Oman and on the shores of the Persian Gulf, considers our guarantee and good name are pledged, we consider that we should not be justified in preventing him from endeavouring by force of arms to recover those rights, of which he considers himself to have been unjustly deprived. We need hardly remind Your Grace that it was with the express purpose of preventing such hostilities that Lord Canning intervened to mediate between Muscat and Zanzibar, that our mediation was offered when an armed expedition had actually started against Zanzibar, and that the promise of the payment of the subsidy by that State formed one of the principal conditions of peace. ' 16. We feel so forcibly the difficulties in which we shall be placed by a recognition of the de facto Government of Muscat without a definite intimation of the views of Her Majesty's Government as to the policy to be adopted in future towards that State, that we earnestly solicit an early decision on the various points which we have from time to time laid before Your Grace. * l These points are— 'First.— Whether the recognition of Azan bin Gheis is to be accompanied by u declar ation of our future policy towards Muscat, and an intimation of our intention to maintain all existing treaties and engagements with the Muscat State ; or, if Her Majesty's Government are not prepared to maintain all former treaties and engage ments, it is necessary that we should know which of them it is proposed to abandon, and which to maintain ? ' Second.— Whether the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy is to be enforced ; and if not enforced, whether we are to inform the Ruler of Muscat that we should interfere to prevent a recurrence to that state of things which existed when Lord Canning intervened to mediate between Muscat and Zanzibar ; and in the event of hostilities being threatened, as they then were, v^hether we should fend an armed force to prevent the Ruler of Muscat from enforcing that to which he doubtless considers he has an indefeasible right ? Third.— Whether we are to hold out any hopes to him that we shall endeavour, by out friendly offices with Persia, to obtain for him the restoration of the lease of Bunder Abbass ?( 23 ) Fourik—Whether we are to endeavow to mediate on. the subject of Gmadur and Gharhar and m what sense; and in the event of our 'mediation proving unsuccessful, whether we are to abstain from interference if the Ruler of Muscat desires to resume the sovereignty of those places by force ? Fifth,—~ If hether we are to endeavour to obtain from Azan bin Gheis such engage ments as wiU y at all events for the present, secure the peace of the Gulf of Oman ? ' '• ^ e feel assured that the momentous considerations affecting our national honour, toe peace of the seas, and the prosperity of the Chiefs and States on the shores of the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman, which we have brought under your notice in our present and recent despatches on this subject, will receive that serious attention at the hands of Her Majesty's Government which their importance demands. (The paras. 8 to 12 are quoted in the Gwadur and Cliarbar precis.) 78. On the 7th May Colonel Pelly wrote :— * While on the Other hand a. note from ' ' n an unofficial communication which I have received the brother of Wahahee Ameer would from the Persian Governor of Bunder Abbass, he considers, . sho ™ that Aboothahee apparently from hearsay, that Syud Toorkee's position is im- v-lner is m alliance with Syud Azan. ' J J 1 ^ proving.* 79. On 31st May 1870 Colonel Pelly telegraphed to Bombay Government and Government of India :— ' Native Agent replrts from Arab coast, after interview with Aboofhabee Chief, that Littoral ( hiefs and Chief at Beraymee have forsaken Syud Toorkee at instance of Aboothabee ( hief, wlio is in friendship with Azan. Agent thinks that under such circumstances Syud Toorkee would have no chance. Wahabee Ameer returned to his capital.' [This was forwarded to the Secretary of State.] 80. And again on 14th June :— ' Syud Toorkee writes he cannot trust the Arabs; that his stay at Debaye is useless and expensive; that had he known the Wahabees would not come to Oman, he would not then have left Bombay; and that he is purchasing boats preparatory to embarkation.' 81. Major Way, the Acting Political Resident, Muscat, reportedf to Colonel 4. xr oka a i a ia.i m iu^n Pelly that Azan bin Gheis, attended by his brother f ISo. 2o4, dated 10th May 1870. T , \ . i 0.1 -i t ^ i n i i /. j -»«- , r. ^ , Ibrahim and Sheikh Sala, had leit Muscat tor Burka with the intention of storming the fort of Azun, near Rostack, his object being to prevent it from falling into the hands of some rival like Syud Toorkee, as the allegiance of the Hear bah tribe who held it was not above suspicion, and the + xt i ^ n.! t -,0^ fort was strong, though short of supplies. The t No. 196, dated 9th June 1870. n j o t t i i -r^ n » Bombay Government lorwarded? Colonel Pelly s Xo. 172-62, of 23rd May 1870, with enclosures, the summary of which is con cisely given in the Office Note of June 15th, 1870. 82. • The Chief of Aboothabee has returned to his post from Beraymee, having left in the latter place some forty of the followers of Azan bin Ghais to protect their master's interests. Syud Toorkee is at Debaye and entertains hopes of attacking Beraymee. He is looking for the ' support of Mahomed bin Ali, the Chief of the Naeem tribe. In the opinion of the Native Agent at Shargah this Chief is not favorable to his cause. The Chief of Aboothabee is said to have expressed his determination to remain neutral. The other Chiefs of the Littoral have promised to help him, if he can also enlist the support of Mahomed bin Ali. The reply of the latter is being awaited. Colonel Pelly cannot see that Syud Toorkee's cause progresses much. Syud Toorkee is also in correspondence with the Sheikhs of the Batinah and Jaalan. His \ difficulty is that he has no money. Amongst the present papers is a translation of his letter to Colonel Pelly asking for a loan of 20,000|. This request His Excellency has already declined to entertain, 83. Syud Toorkee failed in his endeavour to gain support for Mahomed bin Ali, and retired to Bunder Abbass. In anticipation of his attempting to operate thence by sea against Muscat, the Bombay Government was requested to inform him through Colonel Pelly that the rules regarding the preservation of the maritime peace sull remained in force. Syud Salem was then at Kishm Colonel Pelly told Major Smith on the Arab Coast to return at once to Bushire with the Kwantung. This news formed despatch No. 122, dated 24th June 1870, to Secretary of State.( 24 ) 84. The despatch No. 128, dated 15th July 1870, to Secretary of State, continues the chain of events ' From letters written towards the close of May it appears that the troops of Azan bin Gheis were still besieging the fort of Azan. As the garrison has proved itself to be stronger than was expected, and the Governor has intimated his intention of resisting to the last, it is possible that the siege may continue for some time. The neighbouring Batineh tribes are averse to the •fortress' falling into the hands of Azan bin Gheis, it being considered by them as a place of refuge for their families and property in time of danger. In Colonel Felly's opinion the Imam would not be acting as he is, if he had not great confidence in his power to accom plish his object. The Ameer of Nejd before withdrawing to Riadh left Abdoollah bin Soweylim with 3,000 men at Guttur. The Ameer's brother, Mahomed bin Feysul, is at Lahsa. ' As regards Syud Toorkee, the information last received by telegraph of 2nd July shows that, being unable for want of means to keep his men together, he had left Bunder Abbass with 40 followers on the British Ship Mozuffer ostensibly for Bombay. It was, however, suspected that he intended to divert the ship's course towards Muscat and to land at some point of that coast. Colonel Pelly has therefore started in the hope of overtaking him (he was last seen with seven crafts of Persian Coast towards Cape .Task). We have instructed Colonel Pelly not to lav hands on Syud Toorkee, unless he is evidently bent on armed attack on some part of the Coast of Oman, and we have expressed our opinion that it might be sufficient to warn him, and recommend him to proceed on the Mozuffer to any place that he may choose out of Mus cat territorv. We have added that Syud Toorkee must not be taken prisoner, if his capture can possibly be avoided.' 85. It also appeared that ' the Chief of Aboothabee had sent a horse as a present to Azan bin Gheis and asked for pecuniar}' help, provisions to be sent to him in return, but no money. The neighbouring Chiefs of the Littoral had entered into an engagement with this Chief to.be steadfast to Azan bin Gheis. According to the Native Agent at Shargah, although the Chief of Aboothabee had promised to interest himself in his neighbours' behalf, he was in reality setting Azan bin Gheis against them.' 86. On 12th July 1870 Colonel Pelly telegraphed— ' Syud Toorkee has put back to Bunder Abbass, having postponed further movements till opening of fair season, and sent his native craft to Khor Fekkan.' This was communicated to the Secretary of State. Inaccuracy of Statement of the Government of Bombay that Syud Toorkee left Bombay by the authority of the Government of India. 87. In forwarding the letter of 2nd July 1870 from Colonel Pelly, the Bombay Government added— ' Pelly has been instructed as follows :—Syud Toorkee should be prevented landing. He left Telegram from Governor of Bom- Bombay by the authority of the Government of India, and bay to the Viceroy, dated July 3rd, His Excellency knows no reason why he should not be per- 1870 - mitted to return. Mere suspicion would not justify his cap ture without overt act of aggression.' 88. As the Government of India could not admit the accuracy of the statement that Syud Toorkee left Bombay by the authority of the Government of India, when in fact his departure was neither known to, nor authorized * No. 1242P., dated 17th July 1870. ' ^ iem ' tliey wrote a despatch * to the Bombay Government, reviewing the facts :— ' 2. When on December the 5th, 1868, the Bombay Government reported that prepara- Telegram, from Government of Bom- t' 1011 * ^-being made by S^d Salem for the recovery of bay, dated 5th December 1868. P 18 kingdom and asked for instructions, they were informed, ^ in reply, that no attempt to enter Muscat by force from the TO d^dS'^lL«te&amp;. • be permitted. It was, however observed that should a large and mnuential portion of the Chiefs and people signify their fixed intention of recalling Syud Salim, or of inviting Syud Toorkee, totdko up power, His Excellency in Council would be disposed readily to acquiesce in such a wib i, and to allow the person so selected or invited by public opinion to return to Muscat and to resume or enjoy supreme authority in the State. But until this desire shall be clearly mamtested by the people, or by a reasonable majority thereof, His Excellencv in Council would be ready to An ploy force in order to prevent either Syud Salem or Syud Toorkee from making- any warlike attempt to effect their respective objects from the sea-board. ' S. On the lOth February 1869 the Bombay Government communicated by telegraph the opinion of the Political Ag-ent at Muscat that the election of Syud Toorkee as Ruler would be more than ever acceptable to the majority of the people of Oman. On the same day, His Excellency the Governor of Bombay addressed a confidential letter to His Excellency the Viceroy advocating, in strong terms, the claims of Syud Toorkee, and showing the advantages to the British Government and to the people of Oman which were likely to ensue from his accession To Government of Bombay, No. 241, ^ Sult . anate - The Goye.nment of India accepted the dated 17th February 1869. cnange in circumstances which had taken place since the issue of their letter of 11th December 18(&gt;8, and withdrew the pro hibition on Syud 1 oorkee s leaving Bombay. But it was expressly provided that he was not to be allowed a British ship-of-war for his voyage, and that no pledge of protection or help was to be given him in respect of any attempt that he might make to establish his authority over Muscat. It was at the same time enjoined that if any change had occurred in the interval between the receipt of the Political Agent's report that Syud Toorkee was likely to be acceptable in Muscat, and the issue of the Supreme Government's letter allowing him to return, the restriction previously imposed on him was to continue in force. ' 4. Syud Toorkee did not avail himself of the permission then given him to depart, but remained at Bombay for a further period of more than twelve months. The first intimation received by the Supreme Government of his absence from Bombay was in a telegram from the Bombay Government, dated 31st March last, at the end of which it was announced that f Syud Toorkee is said to be at Bunder Abbass/ ' 5. Judging by the correspondence above alluded to, which contains all that has passed between the Supreme Government and the Government of Bombay since November 1868 on the subject of Syud Toorkee ; s departure, the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council cannot admit the accuracy of the statement made to the Resident in the Persian Gulf that Syud Toorkee left Bombay by the authority of the Government of India, nor can he regard the conditional permission granted in February 1869 as applicable to a totally different state of affairs in March 1870. That permission was given under special circumstances reported by the Bombay Government at a time when the power of Azan bin Gheis to maintain his authority was doubtful, and when it was believed that Syud Toorkee would have been welcomed by a large and influential party of the Chiefs and people of Oman. In the interval which elapsed before he actually took his departure, Azan bin Gheis had succeeded in firmly establishing his rule. Svud Toorkee, therefore, w r hen he left Bombay, did so under circumstances which would have rendered the authority given in February 1869 quite inapposite, even if that authority had been general and permanent, instead of being, as it was manifestly intended to be, special and temporary.' 89. The Bombay Government replied ' 2. His Excellency the Governor in Council is unable to accept the construction of Mr. Seton-Karr's letter of the 17th February 1869, now given by the Government of India. The Governor in Council does not find that that letter contains any intimation that the restriction before placed upon His Highness Syud Toorkee, namely, that he should not be per mitted to leave Bombay for any other destination whatever was to continue in force if he did not then avail himself of the permission then given to return to Muscat. The 5th paragraph of that letter records in explicit terms the intention of the Government of India to be that anv restriction as to the residence of Syud Toorkee should be taken off, as well as that all prohibition regarding his embarkation from Bombay should be withdrawn. ' 3, In the letter under reply two things are dealt with, Istly, the permission to return to Muscat in consequence of the report made by the Political Agent that His Highness Syud ToorkeVs return would be acceptable to the people of Oman. This impliedly was not to be oiven if any change had taken place before the letter of the Government of India of 11th December 1868 was received; and Zndly, the withdrawal of any restriction as to the place of His Hio-hness' residence, which was understood by this Government to be general and uncon- ditional, a construction which His Excellency in Council thinks the words and general tenor of Mr. Seton-Karr's letter fully justify.' 90 The Government of India closed * the controversy, as His Excellency . No 15WP, dated 3rd September in Council adhered to his opinion and saw no 1870. advantage to be gained m a discussion 01 the terms of Mr. Seton -Karr's letter of 17th February 1809. G( 26 ) The remark was repeated that ' as a matter of fact the departure of Syud Toorkee was not even known to the Government Telegram to Polical SecreUrv, Bombay, dated 1st April 1870. ^ 1 Mdia &gt; f:1r k ' s M^rmitted by .. from „ „ ' .. 4th „ „ them, as a reference to the tele- Lette'r „ ' „ „ » 4th „ „ No. 127. grams and letters marginally » » ' - 14th •• » » 135 - noted will show. ,, lie turn of Synd Toorkee to power continued. 91. On 3rd August 1870, in their No. 261, the Bombay Government trans mitted letters from Colonel Pelly connected with Syud Toorkee's proceedings in relation to the Muscat State, with his correspondence with Native Agents on the Arab coast, and the Political Agent, Muscat. The dates of all these were anterior to the telegram of 12th July from Colonel Pelly, in which the return of Syud Toorkee to Bunder Abbass was reported. The main features were given in the Office Note of 17th August:— ' Before leaving Debaye for the Persian Coast Syud Toorkee had received from Hajee Ahmed, the Governor of Bunder Abbass, horses, camels, and powder to a small extent. His hopes were also momentarily raised by letters from certain Chiefs of Jaalan and Soor, who were at enmity with Azan bin Gheis and consequently showed a disposition to take part of his rival. They were willing to make a descent on Soor and proceed thence by land to Muscat, but would not co-operate in an attack against Muscat from the sea. They appeared to have been at Bunder Abbass after the arrival of Syud Toorkee at that post, but if they had any personal communication with him, nothing came of it, as they left by themselves some days before Syud Toorkee took his departure on board the Mozuffer. There was reason to believe that early in June Syud Majid was intriguing with the Chiefs of the Lit to ml on Syud Tookee's behalf, hav ing sent presents to all except the Sheikh of Aboothabee, whose alliance with Azan bin Gheis was probably so well known to him that he deemed it useless to attempt to win him over. Syud Majid was also reported to have warned the people of Batinah and Soor, whom he found at Zanzibar, that if they did not aid Syud Toorkee in taking Muscat, they should not be allowed to appear again on the Zanzibar Coast. Accordingly they promised assistance, but whether their number or their influence in Oman was sufficient to give any value to their promise was not stated. The authorities of Muscat about this period took precautions by increasing the garrisons of their maritime forts, but in the opinion of the Political Agent their measures were no more than would have been taken to guard againgt surprise by any enemy. I heir whole bearing showed that they had full confidence in themselves. Major Way still adhered to the view expressed in the March previous that Azan bin Gheis ' holds the reins of Government with a tighter hand than any of the late reigning Sultans have/ 'Syud I oorkee's followers from Debaye were variously estimated from 50 to 90 men. I he party crossed in boats belonging to Hajee Ahmed. The reason that he lingered on the Aral) ( oast after all chance of obtaining support from the Chiefs had disappeared was probably that he expected letters from Zanzibar. Notwithstanding that he had the good will of the Persian Governor (1 lajee Ahmed) at Bunder Abbass, he could collect no considerable force. Accordingly he embarked on board the Mozuffer, his passage money to the amount of Rupees 1,500 having been furnished by Hajee Ahmed. He himself was quite without funds, and his object was said to have been to return to Bombay in order to induce the British Goverment to continue his pension. Reeling this, he meant to return with his family to Bunder Abbass, and thence to renew his attempts against Muscat. 'Colonel Felly's letters. No. 257-157, dated July 2nd, and No. 267 -83, dated 10th July 1870, addressed respectively to the Political Agent at Muscat and to the Bombay Government, concisely recounted the proceedings of SyudJToorkee on the Persian Coast, and the circumstances ot his return in the Mozuffer. He also intimated the existence of a belief in the south of the Persian Gulf that the British Government, though not actively helping Syud Toorkee, did not disapprove of his conduct and would not prevent operations on his part by sea against Muscat territory. 1 he Resident had taken proper steps for removing this impression. He had also a&amp;sured Azan bin Gheis that our policy for the maintenance of the maritime peace had in no wise been changed. Ihe 1 olitieal Agent at Muscat called attention to the injury which traders suffer so long as ms uncertainty about Syud Toorkee continues, and raised the question whether he should be permitted to make further attempts, which, to judge by experience, would only be futile, though they affect the tranquillity and welfare of the country! Colonel Pelly was of opinion that it is oo a now tor Syud I'oorkee to hope for success in any unaided efforts that he might make( 27 ) iSTi/fL 1 A le 0f A f Za « bi n^ b f 8 ' thol,gh he was uot P re P ared to say what might he the the Ameer 0 * ^ ahabees were successful in a war against the Imam. ,, 1 ! u ' sie S^ Azan was still going on, the tactics of Azan bin Gheis being to starve out § &gt;arriso n.

A\ edderburn^s covering letter.' 92. The interest of those papers was superseded by the telegram of the 10th August irom the Bombay Government, which ran thus :— Colonel telly telegraphed on sixth as follows:—' Bunder Abbass Governor writes that Zanzibar Sultan has sent by war-ship Prince of Wales bill on Jairam Sewjee of Bombay for twenty thousand dollars in favor of Syud Toorkee. Firm of Jairam instructed that if Wahabee Ameer aid Toorkee against Oman, should pay any and all money required. Governor adds that Toorkee writes from Menas that he intends proceeding to Kuteef to join Wahabee Ameer. I would propose proceeding to Bahrein in Kwangtung, moving thence to Muscat if advisable/ Message ends. 'By desire of His Excellency I telegraphed on the seventh as follows;—'What is vour object in proceeding to Bahrein? Explain your views more fully/ To which Colonel Pelly replied as follows :—' Your telegram of seventh. Wahabee Ameer having written complainino- of Bahrein Chief in respect to tribute payment, harbouring traitors, etcetera: added that Bahrein belonged to him, that he purposed attacking it, and suggested removal of British subjects. My object in going there was to see Bahrein Chief and, if possible, adjust difficulties, advising him to refrain from all unnecessary cause of offence. Under the circumstances reported in my other telegram of to-day, concerning Zanzibar Sultan's proceedings, I think I should move direct to Bunder Abbass, and at present simply write to Ameer and Bahrein -Chief recom mending amicable adjustment. Zanzibar Sultan's interference for general disturbance of Gulf peace must, I fear, lead to commotion and aggression. If Wahabee Ameer endeavours to retake Beraymee with the lakh of dollars placed at his disposal, he will probably first try to injure Bahrein where his disaffected brother is. In event of attack is gun-boat to prevent it, or simply look on and take off our subjects?'— Message ends. ' Further telegram of same day received on ninth as follows;— f I have just seen con fidential letter from Bunder Abbass Governor, stating that Zanzibar Sultan has sent three bills, —one for twenty thousand dollars for Syud Toorkee's immediate use, one for thirty thousand to be paid on Toorkee's taking Soor, one for lakh dollars to be paid to Wahabee Ameer on his taking Sohar. Further, aid is promised. War-vessel Prince of Wales is placed at Bunder Abbass Governor's disposal, with promise of another if this do not suit. Governor recom mended Toorkee, who has hired large native craft to proceed direct and land at Soor. Report of four crafts with Persians and Beloochees having landed at Soor and been joined by detachment of Jaalan tribes confirmed. Major Way has warned British subjects at Soor. Action of Zanzibar Sultan calculated to disturb Arab Coast throughout entire length. If attempt is still to be made to prevent Toorkee landing on Muscat Coast, I submit I should be permitted to embark for Bunder Abbass forthwith, observe Toorkee's movements and proceed to Muscat Muscat authorities likely to become irritated at combined proceedings of Toorkee and Zanzibar. I recommend that vessel of war be sent to Muscat to protect British interests.' Further telegram received this morning as follows:— f Following from Major Way, August 8th:— Matters at last reported confirmed. Syud Toorkee's arrival still awaited and confidently expected by his party at Soor, Sheikh Sala not arrived there yet. Ibrahim bin Gheis pro ceeded to join Sala.'' 93. A second telegram was sent on the 10th August from Bombay Government:— ' His Excellency is of opinion that great embarrassment will ensue if Resident is allowed to go beyond his present instructions, namely, to prevent warlike operations by sea, and there fore his first proposal to interfere between Wahabee Ameer and Bahrein very impolitic. As regards Syud Toorkee, if he has any force with him he should clearly be prevented leaving Bunder Abbass, and orders to that effect have been sent to Resident. But His Excellency requests instructions whether he shall desire Resident to prevent his going to Soor if alone or with his personal servants only. It appears to His Excellency that we are not called on by the maritime truce to do so. Our position has hitherto been that we prevent actual warlike operations on sea, but otherwise remain strictly neutral. We are still less called on to prevent his embarkation now without troops for Kuteef.' 94. The Government of India answered the above on the 11th August:— ' Your telegrams of lOtb. Views and instructions of Bombay Government in regard to Syud Toorkee approved. As to Bahrein, Resident should limit his action to preventing breach of maritime peace by any party.( 28 ) ' Warn Jairam Sewjee that if, by honoring bills referred to by Resident, he abets waging war against Muscat or Bahrein, being Asiatic powers at peace with the Queen, he is liable to prosecution under Section 125 of Indian Penal Code, and may on conviction be transported for 'Is it considered advisable to send vessel-of-war to Gulf. 95. On the 24th and 26th August the Bombay Government again for warded Colonel Polly's telegram that Syud Toorkee was credibly reported to have proceeded to Soor with some 40 followers in a bugla, intending there to join liis advanced parties of some 200 men who had already landed and were awaiting him in a position where they were enabled to prevent egress of Soor craft. Colonel Felly asked for early instructions as to when he should interfere, as Syud Toorkee would move with first shift of wind. 96. The Government of India replied (25th August):— • ' Unless maritime truce is broken and warlike operations are being carried on by sea, no interference should take place. Colonel Pelly should not prevent Toorkee going to Soor alone or with a few followers. Viceroy agrees with opinion expressed in your telegram of tenth ' 97. On the 7th September 1870, in their No. 307, the Bombay Govern ment transmitted the answer of Messrs. Jairam Sewjee, Bombay, with regard to the bills drawn in favor of Syud Toorkee :— ' As far as our present advices go, we have a bill of exchange, dated Ax had Shood lOth, drawn upon us for Ru})ees £0,000 by our corresponding firm at Zanzibar at one month's sight in favor of His Highness Syud Toorkee. It would appear that His Highness the Sultan paid into our firm at Zanzibar the sum of Rupees 20,000 and got a bill in favor of His Highness Toorkee, pavable at one month's sight. This bill was presented to us on the 15th instant and falls due on the 18th September next, on which day money must be paid by us. ' We would beg to observe that, without having the remotest idea of furnishing to His Highness Syud Toorkee*the means of equipping an expedition, and without, moreover, the least intention on our part of aiding him in breaking the maritime peace in the Persian Gulf, it would be a flagrant breach of contract on our part—a contract which could be enforced against us in any Court of Justice in Her Majesty's dominions—not to pay at maturity our acceptances drawn by our own corresponding house at Zanzibar after our having honored them. It would, moreover, involve the loss of credit and commercial honor of our firm, which we are bound to maintain, without/ we would take the liberty to rei)eat, our having the least intention of sup- , porting anv person to carry on a expedition against any power in alliance with Her Majesty the Queen. ' If the Political Agent at Zanzibar while reporting to Government on the subject, had given a due note of warning to our firm at Zanzibar, as you have been so kind to inform us here, our firm would have refused to grant any drafts such as those which may have been granted. 'We shall of course advise our firm at Zanzibar, by the mail which leaves this on the 31st instant, not to grant drafts of the kind mentioned in your letter. Such drafts, however, as may have been already granted by our firm before the date of our advice we are in honor bound to accept and pay, as otherwise, in case of non-acceptance, we shall be compelled by any Court of Justice to pay them.' The Government of India decided that no orders were needed, as Messrs. Jairam and Co. had had their warning. 98. Colonel Pelly telegraphed from Bushire on September 16th:— ' Syud Toorkee landed at Kher Fekkan and proceeded towards Beraymee. Wahabee force and Aboothabee Chief asserted to be approaching Beraymee. Syud Abdool Azeez states that he is proceeding to Soor to join Syud Toorkee. I think more probably he will go to Mekran. Advices from Bahrein bring satisfactory assurances that Chief will hold aloof from Wahabee affairs, but apprehends annoyance from Wahabees.' This was forwarded to the Secretary of State. 99. Further details of Oman affairs up to 13th September 1870 were con tained in No. 338 of 12th October, and No. 342 of lit a October, from Bombay Government:— ' Azan bin Gheis was then to the north of his capital, but his exact whereabouts was not known, no news having been received from him for many days previously. His object was to reduce the Naeem and other tribes on the north-western frontier. This strong inclination to centralize and to deprive of their independence tribes whom his predecessors refrained from( 29 ) mtruding' upon was only intelligible to Colonel Felly on the supposition that Azan bin Gheis was very confident of his own strength. The Resident looked upon his present policy as rash and unnecessary, but he could not conceal from himself that it had been largely successful during the last two years. Syud Toorkee was said to have landed at Khor Pekkan and to be proceeding towards Beraymee with the intention of joining the tribes in those regions against Azan bin Gheis. Syud Abdool Azeez had also g*iven out his intention of making common cause with Syud Toorkee. Colonel Pelly was disposed to think that he was not unlikely to intrigue on his own account with the view of supplanting the influence of Nusseer bin Thoweynee at Charbar and along the Mekran Coast. In August last Colonel Pelly reported that the Ex-Chief of Shargah, Salim bin Sultan, was endeavouring to recover the place. The operations were, however, entirely by land, and therefore the local Agent was warned not to mix himself up with the quarrel. Colonel Pelly gave later news about Oman. Azan bin Gheis and Syud Toorkee had each scored a victory, but the latter was considered to have had the best of the contest. The Chief of Bahrein was blockading Kuteef for fear lest the Wahabees should issue thence with hostile intent against his territories.' 100. Colonel Pelly discussed the policy of Azan bin Gheis and the His No. 346-110, of 3rd September, in No. 344 of 19th October, from likelihood Ot byild 1 OOl'kee S Bombay Government. SUCCeSS * ' Before concluding this letter, 1 would respectfully submit a few remarks on the present aspect of affairs in the Muscat State. It appears to me that, whatever may be the personal feelings of parties as towards Syud Azan's Government or towards aspirants to power from the Syud Saeed's dynasty, the main question which underlies these feelings is that of centralization versus feudality. Under the Syud Saeed branch every Chief, and more particularly the warlike Chiefs, of the interior and south were respected and their authority little interfered with. Many of them were rarely or never visited by the Sultans, to whom they paid little or no revenue. From time to time they were invited to the capital, and received money or presents from the Sultans themselves. ' But the Government of Azan Khulelee has been an attempt to cripple the independent power of the Chiefs and to supplant them by local governors or deputes of the central power. In carrying out this policy, KSmlelee brought the influence of religion to bear, while Syud Azan and Sheik Sala visited in person the large majority of the tribes, and, whether by force, artifice, or a system of hostages, contrived to reduce them to a state of obedience to the central power. ' Considered from a European point of view, precedents might be found for similar attempts made successfully. But it is, perhaps, open to doubt whether such a policy would be perma nently practicable amongst the Arabs. ' At all events, the Azan Government seem to have given rise to much irritation amongst the Chiefs by their confinement of hostages, while from without the Wahabee Government, always of course desirous to re-capture Beraymee, appears now to be influencing the Naeem and other tribes on the north-west of the Muscat territories against the authority of Azan's Govern ment. And it is probable that when the bribe offered by Zanzibar to the W ahabee Ameer for the capture of the northern part of the Muscat dominions shall be generally known, it will excite the cupidity of the tribes and increase the chances of attack. ' Meantime Syud Azan, w ith his brother Ebrahim and Sheik Sala, are on or near that frontier with a considerable force, apparently as arrogant and confident as ever in their power to coerce the refractory tribes. It is generally and officially reported also that the Aboothabee Chief is himself at Beraymee with intent to aid Azan in his coercive measures. ' It is remarkable that, although the advent of Syud Toorkee in the south has for some time been expected, the Azan Government appear to deem the difficulty on the Wahabee frontier of a graver or more emergent character, since they ignore the tribes of the south when Toorkee is expected and proceed north. ' So far as Svud Toorkee is concerned, the prospects of His Highness seem (if he be prompt and active) more favourable than they have been. Former orders of Government have been to some degree, relaxed in his favour; the intervention of the Sultan of Zanzibar has at least' afforded him funds and credit; the desire of the Wahabee Government for retaliation on \zan combined with the money assurances to that power from Zanzibar, would be likely to constitute a valuable diversionary aid in Toorkee's favour; and many tribal Chiefs would probably hope to regain their influence and their independence under a member ot the Syud Saeed branch. 'On the other hand, the difficulties of Syud Toorkee after landing may prove numerous. The two principal tribes in the south are the Beni-boo-Ali and the Bern-boo-Hassan, who are usually in a state of feud. It is probable the Beni-boo-Ah would join Toorkee at once, but as usual the arrangement would involve presents and time. It is possible that, at all events, a portion at the Beni-boo -Hassan might be induced to join, but this again would involve expen- diture and the alliance might not prove very reliable. Then the .Tenebah and the Hejnyen H( 30 ) wnnU have to be sained, and this in turn would involve time and money. Then the question of the CT&lt;at tribal division of the Muscat territory would have to be considered, the H vec and the Ghafree. Of these two divisions, the Ghatree is estimated the more nume rous' but is somewhat divided, while the Hcnavec are supposed to be in favour of the present dvnasty, and mijrM. perhaps, apprehend that its subversion would result in their abasement and in the elevation of the G ha free. f&lt; In any case unless the invasion be accomplished by an initial enthusiasm, the aggre^a- f - £ m . ( ' won 1,1 ivauiiv time and constant expenditure. It is unlikely that the existing Government would vacate without a struggle. It might so happen that Syud Toorkee would find his nurse exhausted when affairs were on the balance, and when Khuleelee might begin to oi.en his purse in view to turning the scale. The influence of the Muthowahs, diffused as they are tlmmU nearly all the tribes, would no doubt be great; and I trust I do not wrong the priestly character of Khuleelee when I express a doubt whether, other means failing, he would hesitate to employ one of his fanatical subordinates as an assassin. a should Syud Toorkee succeed in taking Muscat, it would not of necessity follow that Syud Azan would abdicate the Imamship, or his colleagues wholly resign power. In old days Nuzwah and Rostak were successively the so-called capital of these territories, and I under- • stand that the present (xovernment are said to have always been in favour of having the capital at one of the above or some other inland point, while the difficulties of the new Ruler would be very grave from a financial point of view. « gut whatever may be the political event, I would earnestly remark that the trade and general interests of the Muscat State appear to me to render some permanent condition of affairs, under a recognized Ruler, very desirable. ' I need not add that, in thus generally remarking on the present aspect of affairs, I con tinue carefully to refrain from prediction. In fact, the more I see and learn of Arabs the stronger becomes my conviction that the tribes themselves are often uncertain of their own action. An accident or the longest purse may decide the day, and when decided, restlessness and cupidity may at once endeavour to contrive the means of disturbing the settlement arrived at.' 101. The BomlTay Government* thought Colonel Pelly was right not to prevent Syud. Toorkee from proceeding on his » No. 344, dated 19th October 1870. 1 1 course. ' With respect to the remark made by Colonel Pelly in his 33rd paragraph, that the orders of Government had been relaxed in Syud Toorkee's favor, the Bombay Government observed that their orders, in which the Government of India concurred, were that the maritime truce should be enforced, but that it should not be extended to bring under its operation circumstances and persons to which it did not properly apply. ' Explanation was called for with reference to the statement that some of the ammu nition in possession of His Highness Syud Toorkee's party was of the Government pattern/' The Government of India approved of the orders of the Bombay Govern ment. 102. On receipt of the narrativef of events in Oman between September t No. 366, dated isth November i87o. Hth and October ^j'Sth, TH/0) the Bomhay Govc rn- from Bombay Government. Dient Wd'C Called Oil to forward COpieS of reports from the Persian Gulf and Muscat with greater despatch as the public news papers had more than once recently conveyed intelligence faster than the official reports. They were requested to adhere to the practice prescribed in No. 480, dated 25th March 1869, to Government of Bombay, and to conform to the instructions laid down in 171P. of 24th January 1870, from Foreign Department. 103. The Bombay Government answered (No. 420 of 28th December 1870.) ' I he Government of India desi-re that the reports from the Persian Gulf and Muscat should be forwarded with greater despatch. In order to carry out this object. His Excellency had already adopted a system which it is hoped will have the desired result. Under the instruc- No. 3196, dated uth October 1870. tioTls marginally noted (copy appended), news -reports are now . _ furnished every mail by the Political Resident at Aden, the Kesi- ent in p Persian Gulf, the Political Agent at Muscat, the Political Agent at Zanzibar, and the Commissioner in Sind. Immediately on receipt, copies of these reports are sent to the overnment of India from the Office in Bombay, and in thisiW'ay the Right Hon^ble the Vice roy and Governor-General in Council will iu future be very promptly and regularly informed of current events.' j v l j■eeeeeweooBem IHHBKB 17 Mhj U':,, t tMfc TVfNfflp! ( 31 ) Of this the Government of India approved. 104. News-reports of Oman affairs, enclosed in Nos. 370 and 372, dated 22nd and 23rd November, from Bombay Government, contained Syud Toorkee's admission that he sustained a repulse at Beraymee. u At Zunk he amply retrieved his fortunes. The fact of the rout of Azan bin Gheis at the latter place was communicated to the Bombay Government by Colonel Pelly in a telegram from Bushire, dated 17 th October. No copy of that telegram was ever transmitted to the Supreme Government. 'The enclosure to No. 370 was a concise narrative of events in the P.ersian Gulf up to * 80 000$ 5th November, and in Oman up to 14th November. The report of pecuniary aid* to a considerable extent from Zanzi bar to Syud 1 oorkee was again repeated. But whatever the money from that quarter Syud Toorkee was still short of funds. There was a rumqur which needed corroboration, that in his march from boor towards Muscat he was deserted by the tribes who had supported him and had been obliged to fall back on Soor. Syud Azan was laid up with a swollen knee at Sohar for some time, but was able to return to Muscat on the 10th of November. The garrisons at Muscat and Muttra were not strong, their aggregate number being computed at 800 fighting men. Beraymee was still held by the Sheikh of Aboothabee for Azan bin Gheis; and it was said that the Naeem and Druah tribes have, through that Chief, tendered their sub mission to the Imam, and had offered to surrender Zunk to him. The trade of Muscat was almost at a stand-still, the British subjects having sent all valuable property on board the ships and being ready themselves to follow at a moment's notice. The Muscat authorities had issued a notice that goods shipped without their permission and re-landed would be liable to duty. 'The Chief of Bahrein, acting on the Resident's suggestion, persuaded the rebellious brother of the Wahabee Ameer to leave the island and ceased to interfere with the seaborne trade of Kuteef. An attack upon a Bunya by an Aboothabee subject and a piracy on a Kutch bugla by Arabs were being enquired into, with a view of justice being done to the sufferers.^ These papers formed despatch No. 252 of 14th December 1870, to Secre tary of State. 105. From the enclosures in the Bombay Government letter No. 398 of 8th December it appeared that— ' Major Way visited Soor on the 29th of October in order to warn Syud Toorkee against under taking operations by sea, and received an assurance from His Highness that he had no intention of disobeying the orders of Her Majesty's Government on this point. He declined to comply with the Syud's request for an interview. He instructed the Commander of the Hugh Rose to take steps for stopping the approach of armed men by sea against Muscat. He repeated what His Excellency knew before, that the Muscat Government had notified to all persons shipping goods without its orders that they would not be allowed to re-land property so shipped without payment of customs duty at the same rate as if the goods had been newly imported into the country. This ruling, he urged, being contrary to Treaty could not apply to British subjects, but he did not intend to notice it till a British subject was charged duty.f The stipulation to which he alluded was the 9th Article of the Treaty of 1839, quoted in the foot-note below.' 106. For some time Syud Toorkee's inability to oppose the de facto Gov ernment of Muscat was patent owing to the desertions of his followers. Some Beni boo Hussan Chiefs visited Syud Azan, and received pardon for having lately joined Syud Toorkee. Subsequently Syud Toorkee— 'left Soor with a force for the purpose of again attacking Syud Azan at Muscat. The Com mander of the Hugh Rose was instructed to take steps for stopping the approach of armed men by sea against the latter place. The Muscat Government was asked to make arrangements to secure the safety of the British subjects there.' (No. 20 to Secretary of State, dated 25th June 1871.) 107. The result of this expedition was communicated to the Secretary of State, No. 134 of 15th February 1871. + 'No dutv exceeding 5 per cent, shall be levied at the place of entry in the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat on any goods, the growth, produce, or manufacture of the dominions of Her Britannic Majesty, imported by British vessels and this duty shall be deemed to be a full payment of all import and export and tonnage duties of license to trade of pilotage and anchorage, and of any other charge by Government whatever upon the vessels or upon the goods so imported or exported. Nor shall any charge be made on that port of the cargo which may remain on board unsold, and no additional or higher duty shall be levied upon these goods when afterwards transported from one place to another in the dominions of His Highness, but the abovementioned duty having once been paid the goods may be Lid by wholesale or retail without any further duty. No charge whatever shall be made on British vessels which may enter the ports of His Highness for the purpose of refitting or for refreshments, or to enquire about the state of the market.'( 32 ) Briefly the course of events was as follows:— , ' Syud Toorkee was at Mazabee in the interior of Oman on the 13th of January with a of 3 to 4 000 men and was about to attack Sumud. (Sumud lies due south of Samayel and southwest of Muscat in about latitude 22° 50' N. and longitude 58° 20' E.) From Sumud Svud Toorkee proposed to take the direct road to Muscat. On the 12th of the same month his Lieutenant Svf bin Suliman had taken Kuryat on the coast between Muscat and Soor. He had separated from Syud Toorkee shortly after they left Soor, and had marched bv the coast route, whilst Syud Toorkee had chosen the more circuitous road which skirts the northern part of the province of Jaalan and leads through Sumud and Semayel to Muscat. He was said to have advanced from Kuryat towards Rooee above Mutrah on ^he 17th of January. Meanwhile Sheikh Saleh, one of the members of the Muscat Govera- liient, had been ordered to proceed to Sumud, and Azan bin Gheis and his brother Ibrahim were busily engaged in preparing for the defence of Muscat and Mutrah. Ammunition was being served out to the garrisons of these fortified towns; the persons residing outside of the walls of Mutrah had been called in, forced loans were being exacted, and additional taxation was being imposed to provide the sinews of war, and British subjects had been warned by the Political Agent to leave Muscat territory. So affairs stood up to the 20th of January. Apparently, on the 30th, Syf bin Suliman attacked Azan bin Ghies in Mutrah,. and obtained possesssion for Syud Toorkee of all but two forts. Bot/jh. Syf bill SlllilUclIl 3/lid. AZ c IH bill Gheis lost their lives in the fight. Colonel Pelly, on obtaining this intel ligence, repaired at once to Muscat. On the 3rd of this month he telegraphed thence through Gwadur that Khulelee, the priestly Minister of Azan bin Gheis, held the forts, but that the troops of the late Syf bin Suliman held the towns, referring, probably, to the forts and towns of Muscat and Mutrah. Sheikh Saleh then occupied the forts of Sumud. By his position there he had evidently so far been able to check the advance of Syud Toorkee, who was believed to be in his neighbourhood. The expectation was that Syud Toorkee would shortly arrive before Muscat. Ibrahim bin Gheis had fled northwards to the Batineh. The forts in this province were in the hands of the adherents of Azan bin Gheis, but, as he was dead. Colonel Felly doubted whether they would be able to hold together,' 108. The Foreign Secretary's opinion on the situation was thus given:— 4 ' The death of Azan bin Gheis gives a new phase to the subsidy question. It also gives a good opportunity for reviving our relations with Muscat, if His Excellency in Council think it desirable to do so. I think it would be wise to take advantage of the present state of affairs quietly to withdraw from the position we have assumed in the sea of Oman, and to limit our protectorate to the Persian Gulf. No communication need be made to the Muscat Government, whoever is now or may be hereafter in power. All that is needed is to instruct the Agent for the future to abstain from interfering in the event of operations being conducted by sea along the Oman coast. We shall probably never have so good a chance again of receding from a false position.' 109. On 13th February 1871, in his No. 153-33, Colonel Pelly described his share in the negociations which ended in a declaration of peace between Syud Toorkee and Khulelee :— ' The first thing which he secured was an armistice. Then he allowed the \ akeels of the contending parties to meet at the Agency as a neutral ground, where they might discuss conditions without danger to their persons. When terms had been agreed on and recorded in a formal document. Colonel Pelly and the Political Agent attested the signatures of the V akeels.' 110. The translated purport of the agreement ran ;— Be it known to all concerned that peace has been made between me, Saeed bin Khelfan A1 Khulelee, and His Highness Syud Toorkee bin Saeed bin Sultan on the conditions detailed below:— ' First. That I should not be answerable for having entered into the (service of the late) Government and for the changes that had taken place affecting persons and property during the reign of that Government. Second. That I should reside where I like, and he {Syud Toorkee) should protect me from molestation and from any person who might bring charges against me, and that I in turn should not countenance, or encourage, or put up any enemies against him, or entertain any ill intentions towards him. 'Ikird In regard to property sold, it should remain as it is; and if any such property belong to any person, and he demand it, it should not be given to him unless on payment of its value to the purchaser (who now holds it.) Fourth. In regard to the dates belonging to Towaynee bin Mahomed, what remain of them should be returned to him, and what have been consumed should be paid for by Syud Toorkee,( 33 ) .FifUi. All claims or demands should be (considered as) settled: great many demands and claims might be preferred against me by the people. Syud Toorkee should lelieve me of the responsibility thereof. ^ Sixth.- llif salaries of the troops and other expences incurred by me (should be paid.) Seien/k. The rice and other provisions in the forts should not be interfered with. Eighth. The provisions made by these conditions should extend to all who had a hand with me in the (late) Government, and to all who depend on me, and those who depend on my dependants. ' 3 ma.—The promises and engagments of Syud Toorkee should be in the writing of Colonel V u 7' Als0 the P romises of the Ghafferee and Henavee Sheikhs, viz., Abdoollah bm Saulem bin Hamudeh, Yusef bin Alee, Homaid bin Khalifeh , Nauser bin Ameer, Naujem bin Mahomed, and any others whom they would wish to have with themseves. ' 7^.—Some person should escort my people to the place they would wish to go.' . ]11 - Colonel Pelly declined that the assurances of Syud Toorkee should be in his writing, as suggested in paragraph 9 of the agreement. His letter proceeded :— Major \\ ay and I then appended our signatures as witnesses, prefacing the same with an explanatory minute as follows :— '' Certified that His Highness Syud Toorkee and Sheikh Saeed bin Khelfan A1 Khulelee having requested the good offices of the undersigned in view towards terminating the present conflict, the undersigned have accorded their good offices to the following extent, viz., \at, of' inducing an armistice; %nd, of permitting the Vakeels of His Highness 'Syud Toorkee and of Sheikh Saeed bin Khelfan A1 Khulelee, respectively, to meet in the British Consulate, where, as a neutral ground, they might confer without danger to their persons, and Srcl, of certifying that the signatures of the Vakeels appointed by His Highness Syud Toorkee and by Sheikh Saeed bin Khelfan A1 Khulelee were attached to the above deed (purporting to be a deed of agreement) in the presence of the undersigned. But it has been clearly explained to, and is clearly understood by, all parties concerned that, in according good offices to the extent above specified, the undersigned in no manner or degree accept for themselves, or commit the British Government to, any guarantee or responsibility whatsoever in regard to any provision, condition, stipulation, or other matters of whatsoever character which the said deed may contain. ' f The signatures of the undersigned are attached simply and purely as those of witnesses to the facts of the meeting having had place, and of the deed having been signed by the Vakeels/ ' 112. In his No. 154-34 of the same date he said— ' No reliable intelligence of the movement of Syuds Ibrahim and Feysul, or of Sheikh Sauleh, have reached me. ' His Highness Syud Toorkee has received from some of the Chiefs of Batinah tenders of allegiance. ' His Highness informs me that Syud Abdool Azeez is expected by the incoming mail steamer from Gwadur, and requested my opinion as to the advisability or otherwise of taking Abdool Azeez into his confidence. The question seemed to me to have many pros and cons. The policy of Syud Toorkee lies in a.conciliatory bearing towards the tribal Chiefs, and Syud Abdool Azeez is by temperament hasty; on the other hand. His Highness is at present almost without any Chief or Noble of influence or position near his person. His Highness lamented this fact to me, and it was only too evident in the interviews I have had with him. ' His Highness Syud Toorkee purposes moving out of Muscat and proceeding to occupy the forts and territory of Oman in person. This course appears to me judicious. ' Notification has been made to the British subjects dispersed during the recent disturbances that they can now return to Muscat. ' His Highness has alluded, in conversation, to the Bunder Abbass lease and other questions. But it seemed to me premature to discuss these matters. ' All being quiet, I have told His Highness of my intention to return to Bushire by the mail steamer, introducing to His Highness Major Way, in whose judgment and integrity His Highness may place every confidence.' 113. The Governor of Bombay and the Hon'ble Mr. Mansfield approved of Colonel Felly's proceedings, considering he had acted promptly but with caution and judgment.( 34 ) 114. The Hon'ble Mr. Tucker dissented fKJc ovr&gt;rpssion of approbation of Colonel Felly's proceedings. It ' I cannot coneut interfered at all, and that the action he has taken will, appears to me that lie uug i n,) ' ( .f arac ter of the British Government, if the agreement with KImlel^hasb^^e^and K 1 inle 1 ee hin.elf treaeherouslv murdered, as seems probable.' The Government of India agreed with the Bombay Goyernment (^o. 49, C.P., 18th April 1871). 115 On 19th February Colonel Felly telegraphed. ' Kriiort of proceedings at Muscat was sent thence direct by Kwangtungou thirteenth; } } J,;, . nu i have just received subjoined telegram from Major Way. February r^axoo^ f .

Tckffraui etuh: ,, , , nfi On receipt of the above telegram the Governor, Itomhay, thought it necessary to enquire of the Political Resident, if there was any reason to believe A ,, Khulelee died by violence or foul means, as the concurrent deaths of Khuletee and his son seemed a suspicions coincidence. 117. Major Way investigated the matter, taking evidence, and reported— 'On the 10th February, about 7 p.m ., His Highness Syud Toorkee sent Sheikh Hashoolal \mree and two others to Khulelee with his compliments, and to say he wished to see hun. Khukte at first declined the invitation, but afterwards his son and Sheikh Nauser acc-ompamed the messeno-cr On landing, they were set upon by the populace and severely beaten and Ill-used. Thev were then conveyed to the Merani Fort. Later in the evening. His Highness Syud Toorkee'had an interview with Khulelee, who was brought dow ; iom could not walk and appeared nuite paralyzed. The next day Khulelee died, and 1 received an intimation from His Highness that he had been like a mad man from-the time he was seized, and had died irom fright and diarrhoea. ' The next morning, Khulelee's son died from, I am informed, diarrhoea, from which he ha been suffering for some time past. . 'KhuleWs death is a great relief to His Highness Syud Toorkee, inasmuch as it is a death-blow to Ibrahim bin Gheis's cause; it releases His Highness from the engagement® e had entered into with him, and which it was almost impossib e for him c J r y out and it removes all fear of his influence, which was very great m the country, against His Highness in any future troubles: and there are several rumours that both Khule e and his son were made away with by His Highness' order, but such dictory, and the enquiries I have made tend to show that they died from the ca &amp; g above shown.' . 118. The Bombay Government (No. 1298, dated 29th March 187 ) thought it a matter of eoDgratulation that Government was not commi e } an acknowledgment of Syud Azan, and advised that formal relations should fie. entered into with Syud Toorkee as Sultan of Muscat. The Ilon'ble Mr. Tucker dissented :— ' I should have fully concurred in the proposal for the immediate recognition of His High ness Syud Toorkee, and for the grant to him of pecuniary aid, if it had not been tor ttie , ne J received by the telegraph of the imprisonment and death of A1 Khulelee, who surren ere forts at Muscat to His Highness Svud Toorkee under an agreement attested n e s W )a of Colonel Pelly and Major Way. 1 am of opinion that Syud Toorkee should not be recogmzeu until this matter is cleared up. ' I cannot say that I feel satisfied from the inquiry that has been made that A1 and his son died from natural causes only, and it appears to me that it would e pru e avoid any expression of opinion on this subject until further events become knonn 0 , consider that what has taken place shows clearly that Colonel Felly 's mediation be ween y Toorkee and A1 Khulelee was unwise and impolitic, and should be censured mstea o appro of.' 119. On the 17th March Major Way telegraphed :— ' Syud Toorkee represents inhabitants of Sohar and dependencies daily complain of ! je ' n ^ oppressed and pillaged, and urge him to send at once and take possession; and solicits permissi to send a deputy and fifty armed men by sea. He urges to send by sea would save expense which he cannot afford; that there will be no opposition and fighting, and the p un t ^ ing now going on would be stopped; and that this opportunity, if lost, may no recur.L r W.;;.', &gt; nect i'L , rpi~ i of .nkti* 0 J*db 0&amp; m •ttupf ! ^ f [if t ( 35 ) respectfully submit possession of Sohar would tend greatly to bring about the early settlement ot the country so desirable to State and trade. Early reply by boat solicited'—- and the Bombay Governmeiit answered (No. 1275, dated 20th March) ' Pending the instructions of the Government of India, the position of Syud Toorkee seems to be the same as that of Syud Azan before Syud Toorkee landed, and your instructions are the same. The de facto Ruler should be at liberty to send reinforcements and ammunitions of war to its fortresses/' Major Way had previously cautioned British subjects as to the risk they might run by remaining on the Batinah Coast owing to the unsettled state of the coast line. On 20th May the Bombay Government were told— ' there need be no restriction on Syud Toorkee's desire to send men by sea along coast to take possession # of Sohar. Instructions on other points hereafter.' 120. Colonel Pelly telegraphed from Bushire, dated 23rd March— ' Major Way reports having visited Batinah Coast, which being somewhat disturbed, he cautioned our subjects to leave. Major Way found the white flag still flying at Sohar Fort, also Azan's brother in Batinah, but not in force. Syud Abdool Azeez had arrived at Muscat. Sheik Sala said to have tendered allegiance improbable. We shall not have an accurate account of affairs until Syud Toorkee moves through the country.' With regard to the truth of a rumour that Toorkee was paralysed,. Colonel Pelly reported that he had recovered from illness, but still suffered from weak ness in the right leg. 121. On 3rd May Colonel Pelly telegraphed :— ' Clyde arrived at .Task with telegram from Commander of Bullfinch, reporting sudden death of Major Way on 1st May. Commander had taken charge, pending instructions. I would sug gest that Major Ross proceed to Muscat by mail steamer, passing Gwadur on Friday. If Clyde, Hugh Rose, and Bullfinch be not all required in Gulf of Oman, I would suggest that Clyde come on to Bushire, as I have no vessel in Persian Gulf, whether for police and ordinary duties, or for carrying out instructions contained in your telegram of 13th April.' 122. Major Way's death, which occurred from the discharge of a gun which he had taken up on the morning of the 1st of May, caused deep and universal sorrow in Muscat. The sad accident not having been witnessed by any person, the circumstances attending it remain unexplained. All classes endeavoured to show the respect and esteem they felt for Major Way. The Government of His Highness Syud Toorkee was represented at the funeral by Syud Saeed, Governor of Muscat, and a general mourning was ordered in Muscat. 123. The news-reports of 22nd April 1871 shewed :— ' Muscat. —The country under the rule of His Highness Syud Toorkee seems to be quiet. ' Sohar and Rostak still disturbed. Ibrahim bin Gheis said to be at Sohar, and desirous of peace with Syud Toorkee. ' Sheik Sala said to be restless and intriguing. ' Properties confiscated by Azan's Government are being returned to original owners. ' Trade increasing. ' Small-pox has broken out in the town. ' Syud Toorkee said to be preparing to move on Sohar. ' Gharebee has proposed to visit Syud Toorkee, but has not been accepted. He is consi dered inimical. ' Merchant of Muscat subscribing funds in aid of Syud Toorkee; it is supposed 5,000 dollars will be collected.' 124. The despatch No. 27 of 23rd May 1871, to Secretary of State, ran In continuation of our Secret despatch No. 13, dated 3rd April, we have the honor to forward further papers, as per annexed Abstract of Contents, from which Her Majesty's Government will learn that the following questions, connected with the accession of Syud Toorkee to power in Muscat, have come before us for consideration I « Whether Syud Toorkee should now be recognized by the British Government.( 36 ) II—«What answer should be given to his request for the intervention of the British Government to procure for him the lease of Bunder Abbass. HI ' The payment of the Zanzibar subsidy. IY ' His request for permission to send 50 armed men to Sohar by sea for the purpose of taking possession oi it. * u i n t j ie gth paragraph of our despatch of the 3rd April, we have expressed our opinion in favor of recognizing Syud Toorkee, and this we propose to do as soon as we receive an expres sion of Your Grace's views. (See Chapter on Bunder Abbass and Zanzibar precis.) 125. On 4th June 1871, the Viceroy telegraphed to the Secretary of State:— 'Our despatch, 3rd April, No. 13. I propose to recognize Syud Toorkee at Muscat. Do you agree? ' • 126. This step was taken on receipt of a demi-official note from the Poli tical Secretary, Bombay:— ' With reference to the question of Syud Toorkee's recognition, His Excellency the Governor has asked me to send you the following extract from a demi-official note from Major Ross, who was sent to Muscat to 'take the place of the late Major Way :— ' ' I was civilly received by the Arab authorities. All seems going on well, and there is no competition for favor as yet. * If Government would recognise Toorkee, I think we might confidently look forward to quiet times, but the Arabs attach considerable meaning to non- recognition ; it is a sort of invitation, according to their lights, to every one who has a pretence to come into the field. ' Toorkee has been thinking of sending a deputation to Government. The Governor here asked my opinion and advised him not to do so. ' This note is dated Muscat, 11th of May. 127. The Secretary of State agreed to the recognition of Syud Toorkee by telegram, dated 9th June 1871. 128. The ' News-Reports ' forwarded by Bombay Government, No. 2399, 6th June 1871, stated :— 'On the 17th May salutes were fired from the Muscat forts for the alleged capture of Sohar by the troops of His Highness Syud Toorkee, but it turned out that the news was incorrect. A body of His Highness' forces had invested Sohar, but had not succeeded in taking it. Syud Toorkee, changing his original intention of proceeding along the Batinah Coast with the main body of his forces, returned on the 22nd to Muscat. A force has been left to watch Sohar, which is still in possession of Ibrahim bin Gheis. Feysul bin Hamood is dangerously ill at Rostak from pleurisy. ' The frontier post of Beraymee has been suffered to fall into the bauds of a small body of Wahabees by the Naeem tribe, who were fighting amongst themselves. ' The following members of the Al-boo-Saeed family have recently arrived from Zanzibar; Hilal bin Mahomed, Nasr bin Thoweynee (lately of Gwadur), and Hareb bin Thoweynee. The Sultan of Zanzibar has sent a small amount of pecuniary aid to His Highness Syud Toorkee. ' On the 24th May, the Queen's Birthday, His Highness Syud Toorkee ordered a British flag to be hoisted on Fort Jalalee, and a salute of 21 guns was fired.' 129. On 12th June, Bombay Government telegraphed:— ' Following telegrams from Pelly ; ' A letter from Syud Toorkee. Is earnest in hoping he may be recognised as ruler of Oman.' Telegram ends. Major Ross reports Sohar still in hands of Ibrahim bin Gheis; dissensions between Henavees and Ghaferees said to have frustrated Syud Toorkee's plans. Saleh intriguing. Abdool Azeez discontented; Syud Toorkee still sanguine of success. Major Ross thinks recognition of Toorkee would give him'moral support. Our Agents on Arab coast and at Lingah report all quiet down to 29th May and 6th June respec tively. Telegram ends. A boat arrived from Kuteef states Turkish troops have occupied that fort.' 130. The recognition of Syud Toorkee as Euler of Muscat was commu nicated to Bombay Government (No. 1238P., 16th June 1871):— I am to request that the Political Agent at Muscat may be instructed, through the Kesident in the Persian Gulf to inform His Hrghness that it gives His Excellency the \ iceroy and Governor-General of India in Council much pleasure to recognise him as the Ruler &lt; i( 37 ) W '] I 1 OOT J t ;! 1U(J r r V1 !, ™ tlie same Nations of friendship that existed in the days ot feyud Saeed; and that His Excellency m Council trusts that the contentions which have so ong- distracted Oman may speedily be brought to a close, and peace and prosperity restored to -H is Highness dominions. 'Orders have been issued for the Lyns to proceed to Muscat, and it is the wish of His Excellency in Council, that the Officer Commanding may be instructed to arrange with the olitical Agent Tor a salute to be fired in honor of His Highness Svud Toorkee on the occasion of his recognition. ' With reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No. 2382, dated 5th June, I am to request that the Political Agent will be careful to make no reference to the former dependencies of Muscat on the Mekran Coast, or to Bunder Abbass, or to the Zanzibar subsidy. No orders on these subjects can be passed till the views of Her Majesty's Government are received, and till a reply is received from you to my confidential letter No. 085P., dated 23rd May, regarding the Zanzibar subsidy. Should His Highness refer to any of these subjects in conversation with the Political Agent, or otherwise, the Political Agent should merely answer that he has not yet received any instructions from his Government on these points. He will at the same time, however, receive and forward any representations which Syud Toorkee may make respecting them.'' 131. The News-Report of 10th J une stated :— ' His Highness Syud Toorkee is residing at Muscat. The situation as regards Sohar is unchanged. A body of Syud Toorkee's troops continues to besiege that place which is still in the hands of Ibrahim bin Gheis. ' The murder of Syed Mahomed bin Saeed, Governor of Semayal, by certain of the tribe Beni Rooaheb is reported. Agents have proceeded from Muscat to make investigation. Other parts of Oman are at present tranquil.' 132. On 11th June Major Ross, Political Agent, Muscat, telegraphed;— ' Bin Syf with 1,500 men besieging Sohar, Ibrahim still holding out. Abdool Azeez proceeds there/ 5 133. On 24ith June the news was :— ' The Agents despatched by His Highness Syud Toorkee to inquire into the circumstances of the murder of % Mahomed bin Saeed, Governor of Semayel, have returned and report that onlv very few persons of the Rooaheb tribe were concerned in the deed. The Chief and majority of that tribe are well affected towards the present Government, and the district is quiet. ' The siege of Sohar is continued. The garrison is not numerous, and consists partly of Persian settlers; but the strength of the place enables it to hold out. Syud Hareb bin Thoweynee and Syud Ahmed bin el Imam have been sent by His Highness to endeavour to push on the operations. Other parts of Oman continue tranquil/ 5 134. In May 1871 Syed Toorkee issued an anti-slavery proclamation :— ' To all whom it may concern. ' The owners or masters of all vessels which shall arrive in any part of our possessions with slaves imported for sale shall be liable to punishment, and we order such vessels to be burnt on the facts being established; any person concerned in landing slaves as aforesaid shall be punished. No person permitted to traffic with such vessels, and whoever shall aid them, conceal their affairs, or land slaves in any place, shall be punished by us/ 5 135. Major Ross on 27th June reported by telegram:— ' Abdool Azeez declined Sohar command. Proceeds to-day to Gwadur. Situation gener ally unchanged/ 5 On which Colonel Pelly wrote cc ^} ie departure of Syud Abdool Azeez for Gwadur will relieve His Highness Syud Toorkee of the presence of a restless relative at Muscat. ' The jealousies between the great tribal divisions of Henavee and Ghafferee were to be expected, and will probably continue at intervals, be the Sultan who he may. ' The straitened financial position of His Highness is, perhaps, the most pressing difficulty. a There can be no doubt that His Highness is very desirous that his authority should b^ recognized by us, and this recognition would in many ways strengthen his position. 55 136. On 10th July Major Ross reported the embarkation of Syud Toorkee again for the Batinah Coast to operate against Ibrahim. K,( 38 ) On 30th July 1871 Colonel Felly telegraphed:— «/wr had proceeded to Bombay before I received Government of India's instructions concerning' recognition. Bdljinch now proceeds to Muscat, instead of Lynx, and will after wards return to Gulf.' 137. On Gth August 1871 the latest intelligence was ' His Hio-hness Svud Toorkee started in his ship the Rehmanee for the port of Shinas, latelv taken from Svud Ibrahim bin Gheis. On arrival there, His Highness arranged for bodies f ll •ulliercnt^ to 'ioin him before Sohar, and sailed himself for Hormool. In the meanwhile, Bashidbin Maktoom, a Chief of the Beni Yas, had landed at the latter place with about 70 mpu acti02' in concert with His Highness. About hve miles inland is the fort of Lawa, windi was held by Mahomed bin Saeed, of the El Hina tnbe, for Ibrahim bin Gheis. This ( hief sallied out and encountered Rash id, but was killed and his followers were defeated. His Highness soon after arrived and took possession of Lawa. ~ ' Thence His Highness proceeded to Sohar, which he besieged and erected a battery of three guns. ' \n engagement also occurred in Khadra of Batineh, between the tribes Yal-boo-Rasheyd and Yal-boo-Sad, resulting in the defeat of the latter, who favored Syud Ibrahim. « V breach was made in the walls of Sohar, and all was ready for the assault when some of His Highness' adherents interceded and proposed terms of compromise, which were granted by Svud Toorkee Under this arrangement Syud Ibrahim retains Sohar and the Coast line from Sullan to El Khabooreh, the remaining districts and ports, including Suweyk and Musnah, being delivered up to His Highness. ' Syud Toorkee arrived in Muscat this morning. 138. On Bth August 1871 Colonel Pelly telegraphed ' Major Ross telegraphs that Toorkee has made terms with Ibrahim, the latter keeping Sohar and Toorkee receiving Surveyk and Musnah. I do not think this altogether satisfactory. ■Bullfinch and Toorkee had arrived at Muscat/' Colonel Pelly (No. 892-231, dated 14th August 1871) commented thus ' If this be a final arrangement, and Ibrahim hold that strong fortress as an independent command, I cannot think the settlement advantageous for His Highness' interests as Ruler of Oman. ' it may be that His Highness Syud Toorkee having heard of the intention of the British Government to recognise him as Ruler may have been anxious to return to his capital in \iew to meeting the Political Agent, and that His Highness has, therefore, made such temporary settlement at Sohar as was practicable on the spur of the moment.' The Bombay Government requested Colonel Pelly to endeavour to ascer tain the exact circumstances of the truce made between Syud Toorkee and Ibrahim. 139. Major Ross's No. 468, dated 10th Axigust 1871, to Colonel Pelly summarised the occurrence and the arrangements ;— ' It appears that there was every prospect of an assault resulting in the capture of Sohar, when some of His Highness' followers of the tribe Val-boo-Rasheyd persuaded him to sta&gt; his hand and make peace. The terms are that Ibrahim shall hold Sohar and the portion of coast from Sullan to Khabooreh, a tract of some 30 miles, all. other parts of the Batinah being made over to Syud Toorkee. ' An Arabic document, probably the composition of Thoweynee bin Mahomed, His High ness' Minister, explains in some measure the reasons which influenced Syud i oorkees decision in this matter. I have no doubt that, as hinted, His Highness considered that a portion or his adherents would, in the event of his refusing compliance with their request for a peace, have deserted and, perhaps, aided the opposite party. This would have prolonged operation, and His Highness' want of funds would have prevented his keeping his forces together for any length of time. He has thus been forced by circumstances, I apprehend, into an arrangement distasteful to him. It cannot, therefore, be considered a permanent settlement, as the hrst favorable opportunity will, doubtless, be taken to renew the struggle for Sohar. r lhis is evident from the expressions used in the latter part of the document. ' The forts of Soweik and Musnah have been delivered to His Highness, who returned to Muscat on the Gth instant. a At present the situation is much as follows;—His Highness tihe Sultan has possession of the sea-board with the exception of about SO miles of coast, and in the interior no opposi tion to His Highness of any importance has been organised. It is to be remarked that t it adherents on whom the Government of His Highness mainly relies at present are tribes ot the( 39 ) Ghaferee division, the Ilenavee tribeSj mostly the co-religionists and former supporters of the All too Sandee family, being-, it is considered, in general lukewarn, in some eases showing signs of disaffection. The elation of the Ghafirecyeli will naturally be accompanied by proportional discontent of the Henaveeyeh. The tribes and their Chiefs have, during many years of contention, learnt to prize their power in setting up and putting down Rulers at will, and, probably, will not find their advantage in supporting any one Ruler to consolidated and undivided supremacy. It is not, therefore, to be supposed that His Highness Syud Toorkee will be exempt from the difficulties which have beset every Ruler of Oman. With command of an adequate income, the Government of His Highness is now in the position to repress any attempts at disorder and establish itself durably. You are aware how embarrassed His High ness is in a pecuniary point of view, and the Sohar affair is a good instance of the consequences/' 140. Colonel Pelly replied to Major Ross :—• a The idea of apportioning the Muscat territories between the representatives of the Syud Saeed branch and those of the Bin Gheis branch of the ruling family has been frequently mooted by the Arabs themselves. In old times, this paHition of territory actually obtained. And at the time of British intervention in 186U, His Highness Syud Toorkee ruled Sohar, while his brother Thoweynee ruled Muscat. ' But the arbitrament of the late Earl Canning held it to be unadvisable that Sohar should continue independent of Muscat. ' 'In my opinion Syud Toorkee will always be liable to find the peace and prosperity of his dominions disturbed so long as the representative of a rival family branch rules independently over the strongholds and region now resigned to Ibrahim bin Gheis. But, of course, the question is one of domestic policy, and all we can do is to Watch events.' 141. Up to 14tli August the Busliire News-Report announced— ' Great mortality by cholera occurred at Bushire during the first two weeks of August last, since which time the disease had somewhat abated. According to medical opinion, the insalu brity ofi the place was in a great measure owing to the flooded condition of the plain in its vicinity. Cholera prevalent at Lingah and along the coast line the Congoon and in the interior, as also in the islands of Bahrein. The villages of Sittreh, Bedeeyeh, and Jaffair, and some of those in Guttur, still infected with this disease. ' The peace at sea continued undisturbed, and pearl fishery was expected to yield a very handsome return this year.' 142. On 20tli August the Xews Report continued :— ' Syud Toorkee having returned from the Batinah Coast was made acquainted, on the 8th August, with his formal recognition as Ruler of Muscat by the British Government. His Highness received with due ceremony the Political Agent accompanied by the Senior Naval Officer and officers of the Bullfinch and the Constance, as well as other Engish residents. After congratulations a Royal salute was fired from the Bullfinch. The day was observed as a holiday, and the vessels in harbour were dressed. His Highness entertained his European visitors at breakfast and received congratulatory visits from deputations of the various classes. Syud Toorkee's recognition is regarded as of special interest and importance for the people of Oman, and the general expectation is that it will mark the inauguration of a more peaceful era. ' Suweyk and Mesnaeh Forts have been given up to His Highness. No disturbances at Muscat.' The Viceroy and Governor-General in Council concurred in the approval expressed by the Bombay Government of the Political Agent's proceedings on the occasion (No. 2745P., dated 22nd December 1871). 143. Major Ross wrote on 25th August (No. 504) ' I do not consider that there is at present danger of a reorganization of the party of the late Government. ' His Highness Syud Toorkee is now acknowledged in almost all of the places which recognized the 'authority of his late brother, Syud Thoweynee, the exceptions being Sohar and Rostack, and attached to Sohar the fort of Hebi. It is not new to find Sohar temporarily separated from Muscat, but its being so is, I am deferentially of opinion, very injurious to the Muscat State and must inevitably be the source of recurring disturbances. ' It is difficult to judge of the extent and nature of His Highness the Sultan's real power over the various interior districts, because it has yet to be tried. I do not myself think that more is possible, or will be attempted, than the mild feudal system of former times.' 144. On 15th September 1871 Colonel Pelly telegraphed to Bombay (&lt;■ g yjjd Toorkee wishes to send vessel to (vassad to enforce his authority. Please instruct me whether Government would object.115. The Secretary noted :— \n account of Kassacf will be found at page 537 of the Volume of Persian Selections. It is a April last dependency of Muscat, hut lies well within the Persian Gulf. * In our despatch of 3rd .a-l No. 13, in which we advocated a withdrawal from interference in the Sea of Oman, nv (. Viu-^csted that the Ruler of Muscat should be relieved from the restrictions imposed on warlike' operations out tide the Persian Gulf. That despatch would not, therefore, apply to the present case. Tne answer to be given therefore depends on the policy we mean to maintain in the Gulf The recent Turkish expedition has raised very important questions affecting that policy. _ | ' Muscat, for example, has just as much right to send troops by sea to Kassad to establish bis authoritv there as the Turks have to send a naval expedition to Kateef to establish their authority at Nejd. We have permitted the Turks to send their troops by sea. Are we prepared to object to Muscat doing the same, and, if so, why ? ' Vs it appears possible to reach Kassad by landing on the east side of the promontory of Ras el Khyma. and then marching inland, 1 think the answer to Toorkee might be that no objections will be raised, provided the vessels do not enter the Gulf or go beyond Mussendom.' 146. It was answered (Xo. 2()13P., dated 22nd September 1871)— 'Viceroy cannot object to Toorkee sending vessel to Kassad, provided it does not go out side territorial limits of three miles from shore. It is -understood here that Kassad is ifmler Muscat, and can be reached by vessel as above. If not, telegraph. 147. On the 18th. September Colonel Pelly telegraphed ' Captain Miles reports Abdool Azeez started for Charbar with 150 Rinds and other followers. Believes he will proceed westwards and, perhaps, join Ibrahim bin Gheis at Sohar. Major Ross unsatisfied with state of affairs in Oman.' Abdool Azeez. relinqnished liis project by the 23i'd September and returned to Gwadur. He was met by Mahomed All at Kilah and persuaded by him to return. Colonel Pelly was told to enquire from Syud Toorkee whether he was apprehensive of any danger from bis brother, and to inform him of what he heard of Abdool Azeez's movement. 148. The News lieport of 23rd September related— 'The Turkish Steam Corvette Lebanon and Steam-ship Iskenderia, 16 and 8 guns respectively, arrived at Bushire under the command of Aarif Beg, Commodore of the Sublime Porte, who gave out that these two vessels were the vanguard of a fleet often set apart for duty in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. A Royal salute was fired by the vessels after anchoring in the Bushire inner roads. The salute was returned after a short interval by the Persian Artillery. The Commodore, Aarif Beg, then landed and called on the Deputy Governor, who had previously sent a deputation to wait on him ' 149. On 6th October 1871 Colonel Pelly telegraphed— ' Major Ross telegraphs renewed hostilities between Sultan and Ibrahim imminent. Col lision between parties already occurred at Stayath. I propose proceeding to Muscat by mail steamer to-morrpw. If Lynx coidd join me at Muscat on way up advisable. 1 think our utmost moral endeavours should be given to prevent another exhibition of upsetting rule in Muscat. The Government of India telegraphed to Bombay (IN o. 2151 P., dated 7th October 1871) Authorize Colonel Pelly to proceed to Muscat and use all legitimate means short of actual interference to prevent renewed hostilities with Ibrahim. Lynx will be ordered to join him.' Instructions had already been sent to Lynx to meet Colonel Pelly at Muscat. 150. Colonel Pelly (No. 1186-335, dated 13tli October 1871) reported at length;— 'On the morning of the 8th I embarked on board the mail steamer and arrived at Muscat last night, ' After the conclusion of the truce between His Highness and Syud Ibrahim bin Gheis, reported on in my letter now marginally noted, matters continued in statu quo during some weeks. ' Subsequently Ibrahim bin Gheis, having some family business at Hazam, proceeded thither from Sohar. .No. 970-250, dated 28th August 1871, and accompaniment from Political Agent, Muscat, No. 468, dated 10th August 1871.( 41 ) '' ^ Highness hearing of this march, either bond fide deemal it to be in the nature of a strategical combination between Ibrahim and the Bostack Chief, or else inferred that the move, Sohar Fort 0381011 affor&lt; ' ed h ' m (His H^ness) a fayonrable opportunity for occupying the ' On reaching, however, the intermediate Fort of Burkah, His Highness seems to have become aware that a surprise of Sohar was impracticable. ... His Highness then made a demonstration against Hazam, which failed of success, and j\ re-embarking- returned to Muscat, where he now remains, and without {as it is stated) entertaining any present intention of renewing hostilities. In so far as I am informed, Ibrahim bin Gheis entertains no present intention of attempt ing any thing against Muscat. His views (which are probably shared among many Arabs) K'cm to be limited to a return to that posture of affairs under which in older times Sohar and other northern districts were held under a branch of the Royal tribe, or by a Governor, separate from, and independent of, the Ruler at Muscat.' 151. On 15tli October the Commissioner in Sind telegraphed :— Captain Miles reports from Gwadur. e Abdool Azeez has again left for Charbar with 20 followers. Has been promised assistance by Hossein Khan of Gaih/ ' Ills real intention was believed to be to join Ibrahim, who was reported to be in open revolt at Sohar, Syud Toorkee arrived at Charbar from Muscat. 152. On the 28th October (No. 1213-346) Colonel Pelly wrote again— ' Referring to Ibrahim bin Gheis at Sohar, and his relative Fysul at Rostack, I asked His Highness whether he deemed their object to be the retention of their present independent positions, or aggression towards Muscat. His Highness replied—' Ibrahim wishes to turn me out, just as 1 wish to turn him out. But,' continued His Highness, * Ibrahim is without money, and when his provisions are exhausted I may be able to do something. Meantime, I do not fear his proceedings so much as I do those of Syud Abdool Azeez, Moreover/ added His Highness, ' I purpose shortly sending, my ship to Khabooreh, when I may be able to gain possession of that place, and so threaten Ibrahim/ ' His Highness voluntarily explained to the interpreter that he was extremely unsatisfied with Thoweynee, and would gladly be rid of him if he could. And there is, I think, no doubt that the position of Thoweynee has done as much as, or perhaps more than, any other circum stance to alienate the Chiefs, in particular those of His Highness^ hereditary supporters, the Henavee tribes, from His Highness' cause. In brief, I have heard but one opinion expressed concerning this man, viz., that his present position is in all respects injurious and dangerous to His Highness^ prospects. ' At the same time, this question of domestic and even personal policy has seemed to Major Ross and myself to be one in which we could not interfere or even advise. Nor do I feel sure that in advising we should benefit His Highness in his actual circumstances. ' It is well that all aspirants to power, and all their subordinate intriguers, seem to be almost, or quite, as destitute of funds as His Highness, and may from this cause be unable to carry into successfnl effect any serious or, at least, immediate conspiracy. It may be hoped also that the recent recognition of His Highness by Government, followed by my arrival here with Her Majesty's Ships Magpie and Hugh Rose, may afford His Highness all the support of which moral influences may be capable,' 153. On 4th November the news was— ' Her Majesty's Steam Ship Lynx, Royal Navy, arrived at Bushire from a cruise on the 27th October, She brought the melancholy intelligence of the death at sea, from fever, of Major Sydney Armstead Smith, Bombay Staff Corps, Her Britannic Majesty's Acting 1st Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf, on the morning ot the 26th.' On 10th November it .was reported— ' Tranquillity has continued in Oman since the date of last report. ' The Political Resident, Persian Gulf, arrived from Gwadur on 6th instant, and proceeded to the Gulf in Her Majesty's Steamer Magpie on the following day, ' His Highness Syud Toorkee purposes visiting the Batinah Coast in his ship-of-war, the Rahmanee. ' Fevers are very prevalent.' On the 24th November the news continued— ' His Highness Syud Toorkee, having embarked in his corvette, the Rahmanee, proceeded on the 23rd instant to visit the Batinah Coast. Syud Hareb bin Thoweynee has gone to Kishm to pay a visit to his brother Syud Salem. Fevers continue to be very prevalent.' L( 42 ) 151. The Bushire &lt;iews on 2 ti (1 December was— « Nodeem Effendi, Turkish Consul for Bushire, arrived here per British Indian Steam Navigation Steamer bulla on the 19th November last. ' A rnrtv of sixteen Turkish soldiers, under command of a Non-Comnnssioned Officer, arrived at Bushire on the 28th November, and is supposed to be a guard for the Turkish Consulate.' , 155. On 8tli December 1871 it was reported— 'His Highness Syud Toorkee having proceeded in his ship-of-war the Rahrmnee to Khabooreh on^he Batiiiah Coast, that place, which had previously been held for Ibrahim hi a Gheis, was surrendered to His Highness by the El Howasineh. ' His Highness returned to Muscat on the 30th November. On 22nd December 1871 the news was that Syud Toorkee had been to Bushire on the Rahmanee and returned to Muscat on the 18th. 156. On the 3rd January 1872 the Bombay Government telegraphed— ' Colonel Felly telegraphs to-day, 29th December. Imprisonment of six British Indian sub- iects at Sohar by Ibrahim bin Gheis for refusing demand for money contributions Subjects were lontr ao-o warned of risk thev incurred in remaining at Sohar at present. Sultan writes com plaining of intrigues and intention of Syud Salim. Senior Naval Officer promises to arrange for a ship proceeding to Muscat Coast and give moial support. No orders were issued. The Bombay Government (No. 645, ''51st January 1872) letter continued the correspondence on this matter. JVlajor Ross submitted a letter from Hindoos residing at Sohar, asking for rescue from imprisonment from British Govern ment. Major Ross added, 25th December ' The traders who returned to Sohar on the conclusion of terms of truce between His High ness the Sultan and Ibrahim bin Gheis were certainly warned by me that Sohar was under the command of a Chief with whom the British Government had no relations of any sort, and were warned that in returning to Sohar it was on their own risk. On the 2nd January he wrote that the imprisoned traders were released by Syud Ibrahim on payment of a forced contribution of about one hundred dollars.' 157. On the 10th January again Colonel Pelly telegraphs as follows : * rn. M p ^ ^ 9 vf 1879 'I have received subjoined telegram from Major Ross:— refermf to Muscat, 6th. Fight * J «ecu,Ted near Sohar in which Ihrrinm the same matter. beaten with loss. Retains Sohar. General position as before. Toorkee holds Khabooreh. He returned here yesterday. The letter of the Bombay Government (No. 376, of 20th January 1872) forwarded correspondence from the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, relative to the em ar- rassed condition of Syud Toorkee's finances, the intrigues of the Ex-Sultan Syud Salem, and the proceedings of Ibrahim bin Gheis with reference to British ^ at Sohar. It contained Colonel Pelly's opinion that it is our duty to attord all lawful protection to British Indian subjects sojourning in the Independent States along the Arab Littoral, though this broad principle must necessari v &gt;e qualified in practice. He added (in his letter No. 1328-607, dated 29th Decem ber to Major Iloss) — 'Aware of the extreme weakness of the Sultan's rule, 1 refrain from requesting you to urge on His Highness the advisability of reducing the rebellion of Ibrahim bin Gheis. u ^ same time we must bear in mind that His Highness is the recognized Ruler of the usca - territories, and that the British Indian Government will ultimately expect from him tiat oui subjects sojourning within his dominions should be treated in conformity with Ireaty, am a^ if injury be done to them in their persons and property, reparation may ultimately be require . 158. On the 17th February the Bombay Government telegraphed ' Following from Colonel Pelly;— f Political Agent telegraphs Sultan received reliable information Ex-Sultan Syud Salem meditates descent on Soor with about 100 men, an so ici s aid of steamer.

His Highness heard Syud Salem left Hen' jam twettth. 1 hmks he will certainly land in south-east, and proceeds in person to-day to Soor m Kahmmee. Trouble anticipated.—Telegram ends. Magpie called at Muscat some days ago, and 1 have requested Senior Naval Officer to despatch a ship of war to Muscat to give moral support. • ^ No orders were issued by the Government of India. 159. Colonel Felly's (No. 130-28 of 1872, dated 27th January) letter showed that Khabooreh remained in His Highness' possession. Ibrahim was still moving in the matter. His Highness' Commander, Bedr bin Seyf, surprised Ibrahim near Sohar, on his way to Khabooreh, and routed him, Ibrahim escaping into Sohar. Syud Toorkee had returned to Muscat and Thoweynee bin Maho med had obtained hold of Khabooreh for Syud Toorkee. In his No. 131-29, of the same date, the Bullfinch was said to be on her way to Sohar to discover the real facts in the case of the confinement of six Banyans in the Sohar Fort by order of Ibrahim. Major Boss reported (No. 25, 13th January 1872) that the six Banyans were confined by order of Ibrahim in a tower of the Sohar fort. On the second day they agreed to supply 25 bags of rice and were released. Major Boss, the Political Agent, also reported that the Khabooreh Fort was in charge of one of His Highness' adherents. The Government of India awaited for the report. The news report of the 4th February stated that no movements of import ance had occurred during the past fortnight. The Batinah Coast continuing unsettled. Her Majestys Ship Bullfinch had proceeded to the Persian Gulf. On the 18th February (in No. 1204, dated 28th February 1872 from Bom bay Government) tranquillity was reported to have prevailed in all the provinces of Oman. It was rumoured that Syud Salem bin Thoweynee designed taking the field in the south-east. Her Majesty's Ship Magpie had left for Bombay on the 13th. It was added— ' His Highness Syud Toorkee is sending an Envoy with a present of horses to his brother Syud Burgash of Zanzibar.' On the 29th February the Bombay Government (No. 1249) forwarded a letter from the Political Agent at Muscat, dated 4th October 1871, regarding certain expressions alleged to have been used by the Turkish Commodore con cerning His Highness Syud Toorkee. The Turkish Commodore complained of the Sultan conversing with the Dutch Consul in the house of oiie Hajee Abdool Nubbee. The grounds of complaint being— \st. —That no Pilot was furnished at Muscat. ^Ind.—That His Highness did not depute any one to welcome the Turkish Commodore on board Ms vessel. Zrd.—That His Highness was wanting in hospitality and friendliness. Colonel Pelly reported that there was one opinion among the natives of those regions, viz., that the Turks are desirous of availing themselves of every opportunity for interfering in Arabian affairs and exerting direct control over Arabian territory. The Bombay Government directed Colonel Pelly to instruct Major Boss to take an opportunity of mentioning to His Highness Syud Toorkee the advisability in his position of treating the officers of the Porte with courtesy on such occasions.v . ; ; : ; ; . ; . i ' • • t't LLL lai ill ( 44 ) 159 V On the 24,tU February the Bombay Qovernment again telegraphed— ' Following from Colonel Pelly:— 'Maior Ross telegraphs as follows :-Muscat 21st Syud Salem at Sohar arranging lans witli lbrahim.

Syad loorkee proceeds to Gwadnr iifetead of to Soor.''' % ' i I Accordingly on 1st March Colonel Pelly was asked by telegram to telegraph his views of the present situation in Muscat. Colonel Felly replied on 2nd March - | '■Ross's letters received to-day state Sultan has cause to apprehend danger or treachery from J m v side and thai his popularity and reputation are undermmcd by banrfal mflucncc of his m ;« L w Present combination in Oman is probably led by Ibrahim bin Gheis northward, s vi s ,iem southward, and Sheik Sauleh inland.

The nresent situation will probably develop itself within a short period, and meantime '» course Id need to bo consistent with our policy other than to wateh events and protect British intereste Senior Naval officer has promised to despatoh a man -of -war to Muscat where she should be near arriving now.' 5 In forwarding this the Bombay Government added a r opinion the injury to British interests, political and commercial, which will result from this recurrence of disorder in Oman, and the possible establishment of an unfriendly power there can scarcely be exaggerated. The present condition of affairs is mainly the result of the Siiltan's want of means partly caused and certainly greatly increased by the withdrawal of the Zaimbar subsidy On the accession of Syud Burgash the slightest intimation of our wish would have secured its payment in future and of all arrears. I have more than once urged that he should receive pecuniary assistance pending the settlement of this question. 1 am afraid that it is now possibly too late, and that we shall see the flag of the Porte flying over Muscat. His Excellency's order was— 'Nothing to be said at present. Let events develop themselves, lurks have disclaimed intentions against Muscat.' iH I 159B. The Bombay Government wrote (No. 1161, dated 26th February 1872) that though they did not think that there was any prospect of byud Salem bein- successful in any attempt he might make, on Muscat, these continual intrigues against the Sultan's Government were most mischievous as giving a feeling of insecurity and tending to keep alive a feeling of opposition, v\ Inch otherwise might subside. As long, however, as the present want of money on the part of Svud Toorkee continued, the Bombay Government feared that we could hope for no improvement, and earnestly pressed on the Government ot India looking to the advantage that it would be to us to have a strong Govern ment in Oman, the necessity of affording the Sultan some assistance in his pre sent difficulties. The Government of India answered (No. 590P., dated 11th March 1872): ' His Excellency in Council is quite alive to the advantages that would be gained by the establishment of a firm and just Government in Muscat, as well as in all other countries with which the British Government is in friendly alliance. His Excellency in Council would also gladly see the Museat throne perpetuated in that family with which the British (Tovemment has had such intimate relations since the beginning of the present century. To secure results so desirable the Government of India is willing to exert all the moral influence at its command. But to go further than this His Excellency in Council considers would be a departure from the line of policy hitherto pursued in dealing with the affairs of Oman, and His Excellency m Council is not at present prepared to sanction expenditure from Indian revenues in assisting Syud Toorkce to maintain his position. His Excellency in Council however, in view of the pecuniary difficulties from which Syud Toorkee is suffering, will again lay before the Secretary of Sta an expression of his opinion that the arrangements by which Muscat was to receive an annua subsidy of 40,000 dollars from Zanzibar should be maintained, and will strongly urge an eai y decision of the question.' On the 6th March the Bombay Government telegraphed :— 'Colonel Pelly telegraphs. I have received the subjoined from Muscat.

The fort of Mutthra and the unbroken line of coast between Muscat and Mutthra were also in his possession Ihe boat that was sunk appears never to have left what is constructively Muscat territory. * S condition, therefore, required under the Government orders of the 4th August 1869 was fulnlled, and under those orders the boat ought not to have been interfered with. 1 Tl ; i ! i 1 S 011an ®ther instance of the indefensible and dangerous character of the policy we have lately pursued m the Gult of Oman, a policy which has its origin in the events of 1868 It is tounded on no law or engagement with Muscat; on nothing but the will of the strono-er. Oui will and pleasure is perhaps as good a foundation on which to rest it as any other if^the policy be in itself an expedient one, and the circumstances of the case justify it ' In a separate note on the maritime peace however, I have endeavoured to show that the policy is positively a dangerous one, unjust to Muscat, and incapable of defence, if challenged by other powers. A^ icgai ds ourselves there is no advantage resulting from it, and I cannot understand why it should be persisted in. - ' In the Persian Gulf, the case is totally different. Not only is the policy in that Sea justi fied in the case of some tribes by Treaty and in respect to all by long usage; but a departure from it would be dangerous to the general peace of the Gulf and injurious to the rights and interests of our own subjects. For instance, the southern shores of the Persian Gulf are occupied by numerous warlike Arab tribes, who own no central authority and are always at war amono- themselves. The coast is studded with islands where our subjects have invested large sums in the pearl trade. Hostilities at sea entirely stop that trade and ruin our subjects. It was also found that, under pretext of lawful war by sea, the Arabs plundered our traders and committed piracy and all kinds of outrage. Temporary measures of remedy were tried, but it was found impos sible to distinguish, in dealing with such barbarous races, between acts of lawful war and M( 46 ) n i of war and that the only means of securing peace and the piracies committed muier c^ r ^ ^ all warlike operations by sea.

Although the position we had assumed was distasteful * to Azan bin Ghies, and although the original instructions f of 11th December 1868 and 28th January 1869 for the prevention of all war like operations in the Sea of Oman, which appear to have originated in a geographical error, were very soon found to be impracticable, and. had to be modiiied by the later instructions or 4th August 1869, still so long as Azan bin Ghies continued in power, we considered it desirable to adhere to the policy which had been entered on. But we would take advantage of the recent events at Muscat, without any declaration of a marked change in policy, gradually to cease to exert a power which, unless exercised with the greatest care and good judgment, may at any time lead to very serious complications; and we would gradually return to those relations with Muscat which existed before we attempted to take on ourselves the ^forcible sup pression of warlike operations in the Gulf of Oman. ' 7. We are no doubt very materially interested in the preservation of the peace of these waters. If disturbances broke out, it might be difficult to prevent their spreading to the Persian Gulf. It has, therefore, been long our policy to exert our legitimate influence to preserve the peace on the coasts of Mekran and Oman. At the same time there is not, and has never been, the same occasion for a direct exhibition of force as in the Persian Gulf, the southern shores of which are inhabited by a multitude of warlike tribes owning no common authority. If our relations with the Ruler of Muscat are of a friendly kind, we entertain no doubt that by advice and the exercise of our influence we can practically obtain the same results as, regards the general peace and safety of the Sea of Oman as we now secure by measures, the propriety of which is not altogether beyond question. 8. If, -therefore, Syud Toorkee should establish his position and should evince a desire for the formal recognition of the British Government, we propose to recognize him as the Ruler of Muscat; and if he should express his determination to endeavour to recover by force of arms the outlying possessions of Muscat, we would inform him that he is quite at liberty to do so, and that there is no longer any necessity for maintaining so rigidly as heretofore the prohibition of warlike operations outside the Persian Gulf. At the same time, although we should not directly interfere if he endeavoured to recover by force the distant possessions of Muscat out side the Persian Gulf, we would endeavour as a preferable course by friendly offices to enable him to settle such disputes amicably. By this means we should gradiially be relieved of the responsibility we have by insensible degrees assumed for the preservation of the maritime peace on a line of coast extending from Kurrachee to the northern limits of the Mozambique Channel, to which we drew Your Grace's attention in our despatch No. 32, dated 27th May 1870. It is under any circumstances a course we should deem it absolutely incumbent on us to adopt in the event of Her Majesty's Government deciding that the Zanzibar subsidy is not in future to be paid to Muscat. ' 9. Minutes by the Hon'ble Sir R. Temple and the Hon'ble Mr. Ellis, dissenting from the views expressed in paragraphs 6 and 7, enclosed/' Dated 3rd April ]871. Minute by the Hon'ble B. H. Ellis. am 164. I fully concur in the first five paragraphs of this despatch, but I unable to give full concurrence to other parts, especially paragraphs 6 and 7. 2. I so far agree that I believe, as stated in the commencement of the 6th paragraph, our policy in regard to Muscat and the Sea of Oman requires careful reconsideration; for we have in recent years gone beyond what was necessary or expedient for the maintenance of the maritime peace in these waters. ' If we have exceeded our legitimate duty, it was not, in my opinion, owing to our having taken too direct an interest in the dynastic changes in Muscat, but rather owing to our having held aloof from Muscat affairs, and hesitated to recognize any one as Sovereign. To maintain a position of impartial neutrality, we prevented all alike from breaking the maritime peace. 3. The interests of Muscat are intimately bound up with those of our Indian ports on the one hand, and with those of the Persian Gulf on the othei% and it seems impossible to draw so clear a distinction between the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman as to maintain our policy in the one case, and wholly recede from it in the other. While there was a strong Government at Muscat our interference outside the Gulf was not called for, and it will not be needed if a strong Government be again established, but we cannot say that if need( 48 ) ■irises, we are not to prevent raids by sea, and piracy under the name of warfare, in circumstances which would justify our interference inside the Gulf. 1. Instead, therefore, of laying down a stringent rule that we are to cease wholly to exert in the Gulf of Oman the power which we propose to maintain unimpaired in the Persian Gulf, I would be content with stating that this power is nol to be exercised so freely as of late. In the proposal to recognize Syud Toorkee, and to allow him full liberty to recover by an expedition by sea his outlying possessions, I quite concur, and I conceive' that we can give this per mission without waiving our rights to intervene, if circumstances should appear to us to demand our maintaining the maritime peace in the Sea of Oman. 5. I have no objection to w ithdraw any pretensions that may have been asserted in regard to the sea from Easal Had to the Mozambique Channel. It will be understood that the remarks above recorded apply only to the Sea or Gulf of Oman. Dated 3rd April 1871. ^ Minute by the Hon'ble Sir R. Temple. 165. I entirely concur in the above minute by Mr. Ellis. I further think we ought to interfere whenever necessary to preserve the maritime peace in the Sea of Oman, or whenever necessary for our political or commercial interests in that quarter. 165. J ust before these papers arrived, the following interesting minutes were written:— (Confidential.) ' From the time that I came to India first to the present I have had the misfortune to dis agree with my predecessors in this Government, and also with the Secretary of State, on many- points of the policy hitherto adopted with regard to the States of Oman and a portion of the Arabian Coast. ' I always felt that the direct interference in the affairs of 'Muscat, which had been for some years carried on, would ultimately entangle us in a complicated net of difficulties; that our position with regard to their vast extent of coast is untenable, and should be considered wholly different from that which we had assumed with regard to the Persian Gulf; that the safety of our trade did not necessitate any such action; and that we really had as much right and interest to meddle in the affairs of Oman as we had in the affairs of Madagascar. However, 1 found it impossible absolutely to recede—Syud Toorkee was a prisoner in Bombay, brought thither in a very questionable manner. We had interdicted all warlike maritime operations on the Coasts o£ Oman and Mekran. Coloael Disbrowe was misrepresenting British interests at Muscat. We found it difficult, nay almost impossible, to recognize the de facto Ruler of the country, and we considered the suggested action of the Secretary of State with regard to the Zanzibar sub sidy a political mistake, and one which was little short of a breach of faith. ' The suppresion of the slave trade enters so largely into the consideration of Her Majesty' s Government in respect to these matters, that it complicates the question still further, because, though it naturally occupies a foremost place in the minds of Her Majesty 's Government, it is a matter of Imperial policy with which the Government of India have nothing to do. ' Azan bin Gheis's question with regard to our real intentions and policy was so awkward that it has never really been answered. I thought at the time, and still think, that it was really unanswerable. However, as events roll on in the manner so well described in the Secretary's notes, the difficulties do not decrease, and I certainly am prepared to advocate under certain circum stances a bold and decided course. ' If Syud Toorkee establishes himself at Muscat, I should recognize him at once. '■ I should inform him that we did not propose to interfere with any movements which he might find it necessary for his safety to make either for the defence of his shores or the recovery of what he may consider his ancient possessions. ' The duty of suppressing piracy is one that is common to the cruisers of all civilized nations, and beyond that duty which imposes itself on our ships in all parts of the world I would not interfere. 1^ Her Majesty's Government think it their duty to take upon themselves the suppression oi restriction of the slave trade between Muscat and the Arabian Coast on the one side and Zanzibar on the other, I certainly think that all communications on that score should be made to Muscat by Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.( 19 ) ■e ^L^tSMrRsssnftss .t*' - *-«—» rs2^Jtt^^£S^S^5=s if flw ie Pb tha t l s a matter entirely to be decided by Her Maiesty^ Government and that mevZ T^X^Z 8 - ^ 11 right or dut 7 of England to interfere and bv W to t rr. obtaining by warlike means those rights to which he thinks he is pntitUl th Indian Government have nothing to do with the matter. entitled, the .

To that extent we are interested in the stability of the de facto Government, whatever it be of those portions of the Coasts of Arabia and Africa. And we have entered at different times into political relations in respect thereto from which we cannot recede. But beyond this I would not go, and. I would abstain from interference in the interior as much as possible. T also agree that the suppression of the slave trade between Arabia and Africa is not at all a matter for India, but is a question solelv for Her Majesty's Government in England. (Sd.) R. T. 167. I am not prepared to concur unreservedly in the views here set forth. I considered that the despatch to the Secretary of State, No. 31 of 1870, dated 27th May, paragraphs 12 and 15, gave a correct exposition of what ought to be our policy, and I conceive that we could not recede from the assertion of our supremacy in the Gulf of Oman with more credit or safety than we would from our position in the Persian Gulf. It is true that there are special Treaties with certain maritime tribes in the Persian Gulf which give us special rights, but those engagements affect only the tribes with whom they were concluded, and our general rights there rest on precisely the same grounds as those in the Gulf of Oman. I fail to perceive that there is any essential difference between our relations with Muscat and with the States on the borders of the Persian Gulf that we should resign the supremacy which we have long exercised in the Gulf of Oman as fully as in the Persian Gulf. The intercourse of our traders with Muscat is even closer than with the States of the Persian Gulf, and we ought not to withdraw from our position in the Gulf of Oman, if we would maintain our character in the Persian Gulf and protect our interests in these seas generally. These remarks do not apply to the coast southwards from Ras-el-Had to the neighbourhood of Aden, for.with this, so far as Indian interests are involved, I concur with His Excellency in considering that we have no concern. The difficulties which are stated to have arisen seem to me to have been caused by mistakes of policy, and as first and foremost in such mistakes I would, with all deference for the decision of higher authority, point to the orders of N( 50 ) n \r - cix 'c of Stato regarding the Zanzibar subsidy. His Excel- f S's wh-it W should do if Zanzibar fail to pay the subsidy and Syud ^ war bj sea? With m y opinion of the ob igations of Zanzibar 1 should hv all mrans let him go to war. The assertion of our gnpre- macv does not debar us from giving remission to a Sovereign ally to vindicate Ids rights when it seems fit to us, and the difficulty in this case will arise from i ; i but regard as a decision unjust to Muscat, and not from our resolve^ to ltS X- at Sea in tlu&gt; Gulf of Oman for so long as we think S peace ought to be maintained. I see m the assertion of such a right no difficulty in permitting the ruling power to punish ite refractory vassals. The d if c dty in the case of Azan simply was that we hesitated whom to recognize. I do not sav here whether the policy was right or wrong but this hesitation was our difficultv, and had we felt sure that Azan would ultimately prevail, I doubt no even under the present system, reasonable grounds would have been ass.gn- able for permitting him to transport armed men and munitions of war by sea. I ontirelv concur with His Excellency that the questions from time to time arising in reference to the slave trade of the East Coast ot Africa and to our relations with Zanzibar generally are entirely for the consideration of Her Majesty's Government in England in the Department of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and that the Indian Government has no concern therewith. But I do feel most strongly that in the matter ol the Zanzibar subsidy, on which the late Viceroy was arbitrator, a guarantee was given under the sh'nature of the Governor -General of India, and the settlement was declared ^ him ' to extend to your respective successors and to be held to be a final and permanent arrangement,' and that, therefore, the Government of India is deep! v interested, and I would lose no opportunity of pressing this on Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India. As I understand that His Excellency does not proppse to make any formal renunciation of 'w claim to interference, I am not sure that there is any practical different 3 of opinion between His Excellency and me, tor i would certainly aid Syud Toorkee as His Excellency proposes, to enable him to estab- lisU himself move firmly; but; on the other hand, if on pretence of claiming the Muscat throne a number of other pretenders were to commence warlike or piratical operations by sea, I should not hesitate to put them down just as we have hitherto done. 27-2-71. ( Stl -) ^ E ' 168. I am inclined to think that in this matter we are, and have been, hampering ourselves needlessly by laying down general rules of conduct instead of acting in particular cases with a view to interests which we have an un doubted right to protect by force. Why not content ourselves with preventing proceedings which are substantially piratical, and which as such endanger our own interests. The declaration on which I gave my opinion a year ago appears to me to be indefensible if it is construed as going beyond what we shou e justified in doing without it, and unnecessary if we so construe it as to con ne its meaning within the limits of what we could do without it. 2-3-71.

'&lt;3. But even if these instructions had not been communicated to the Government of India, His Excellency in Council cannot but express his surprise that the Eight Hon'ble the Viceroy in Council should have deemed it necessary to make such an omission a ground of complaint to H er Majesty s Secretary of State, without, in the first instance, affording to this Government an opportunity for explanation. Even in the case of subordinate officers, it is not customary to pass censure without first asking for an explanation. And where a local Govern ment is concerned, it appears that a departure from this salutary practice must necessarily pro duce misunderstandings, and impair those cordial relations which should exist between the Supreme and the local Governments. In the present instance, if the explanation of this Government had been asked for,, the Government of India would not have assumed that the omission was intentional, and an oversight in the Secretary's Office would not have become the ground for a serious representation to the Home authorities. ' 4. From a similar cause. His Excellency in Council has been placed at a disadvantage with reference to the instructions recently issued by him regarding Muscat affairs. For he has now learnt for the first time that the proceedings of this Government have not been approved. The course taken by His Excellency in Council was not adopted without due care and considera tion, and the circumstances will presently be set forth in detail. But what I am here directed to point out is, that His Excellency in Council conceives that he has just reason for complaint when his proceedings are condemned without due consideration of his grounds of action. It would have been easy for the Government of India to have ascertained from this Government the ground on which the instructions to Colonel Pelly of the 9th of January last were based, but they have preferred themselves to supply the reasons, and then to condemn the action of the Bombay Government, because those reasons are invalid. Thus in paragraph 5 of the despatch, it is stated as follows :—' The ground upon which the Bombay Government appears to have based its instructions is that as a state of war had broken out in Muscat, we were bound to maintain a neutral position between the combatants and to prevent Syud Azan from doing for his own defence what we would not permit Syud Toorkee to do for purposes of aggression.' But it appears to have escaped the notice of the Government of India that the reference to which the orders were a reply was for instructions in case an attempt was made, not to defend Muttra, but to drive out Syud Toorkee from Soor by aggressive operations from seaward. And if the Right Hon'ble the Viceroy in Council had been pleased to refer to Gov ernment Resolution No. 184, of the 14th of January last {vide paragraph 2 of this letter), it would have been apparent that the orders of this Government referred to offensive operations only. For the opening direction of that Resolution runs as follows:— ( The reply to Major Way's question as to permitting Muscat Government to send an expedition against Soor hy sea must be in the negative and the Resolution thus concludes;—''It is our object to preserve a neutral position between the combatants and to prevent all warlike operations by sea. We should abandon our neutral position if the Muscat Government were permitted to undertake not defensive hut offensive operations as proposed.' ' 5. With these preliminary observations I am now directed briefly to review the various orders which have been passed regarding the maintenance of the maritime peace in the Gulf of Oman. This appears to be necessary in order clearly to show the position of this Government and the grounds upon which the instructions now under consideration were issued. 6. In his letter No. 115, dated 21st November 1868, Colonel Pelly reported that there was an intention on the part of Syud Salem to collect some of the. tribes from the Arab Coast to recover Muscat, as he considered the tribes to the southward still loyal to his cause. Colonel Pelly had thus instructed Captain Way f Syud Salem is desirous of embarking some men from the Arab Coast on board of his men-of-war. I am telegraming to Government on the subject. In the meantime I do not think that I am authorized in preventing him so long as no breach of the peace at sea occurs in the Persian Gulf. Syud Salem would use his men solely on the Coast of Oman for the recovery of his lost dominions.' Subsequently Colonel Pelly informed this Government [vide his No. 118, of 3rd December 1868) that Syud Salem's •( 52 ) ... , , -4, i i,; T&gt;vnT&gt;nsal to the employment of some men of the Henavee tribe from Minister h;u hn;. .&lt; • M 1 accordingly he had agreed not to interfere with them provided the Vl-thul X C^,-l^ «c« r) and th^hip. on board of which the S ailor s might Se' lor^rLXl«.ved otherwise than in His Highness' Mn^eat dominions. ,&lt; 7 Such was the state of circnmstances in the Gulf of Oman when Sir J. Lawrence , V Pp^wino- order on the 9th of January 1869;— f Naval operations by any party at issued the tollo i ij b prevented by force of arms if necessary/ Under this order Muscat or any wlH- e el^ouWhe^cn^ ^ ^ ^ in the p ersla[1 Gul{ of the&lt;'o emmc ^ . d ' the prohibition was held to extend to Gwadur and the coast of or the Gu ' fV^general.both as to parties and places, and no exception was made Mekran. 1 iU J , r . u f orce or, in the language of the Government of India, by t0 ^ neeisary At the tme time, .he charh-understood policy of the British an act ot * dl , n f f he eom mencement to the end of the official papers on Muscat and scrupulous neutrality. So long as the peace at sea was not vioTatol, ™d British subjects were unmolested, no interference wrth any military operations by land was to take place. «» Farlv in May of the same year Syud Azan, who was in possession of Muscat, desired to reinforce his forts at Birkah by sending thither some troops and ammunition by sea. Tt ameaml t.. Lieutenant -Colonel Disbrowe, then our Agent at Muscat, that the prohibition of the Government of India extended to the transport by sea even of necessary reliefs and supplies for the various garrisons tn the Coast and on Syud Azan proceeding to deLteh troops notwithstanding his protest Colonel Disbrowe suspended diplomatic rela- Ss and retired on board a sloop of war in the harbour of Muscat. Reference was 'lade to S Government for instructions, and it appeared to His Excellency m Council that this va« an erroneous construction of the order which appeared to be directed against warhke tL. In sea or operations in furtherance of actual or imminent hostilities. But Ee this view could be communicated to Colonel Disbrowe it appeared that a similar view had been taken by Colonel Pelly who was at that time at Muscat and the transport of the reinforcements was permitted by that officer, as reported ill his despatch of 'th May lsb9 Subscqnenth the Government of India, in their despatch, dated 4th August 1869 expressed theii concun encc ' in the interpretation' put by Colonel Pelly on the original orders of the Government of Sir J, Lawrence of 9th January 1869. ' 9 With reference to this interpretation of Sir J. Lawrence's order, Colonel Disbrowe shortly afterwards informed Syud Salem {vide letter of 10th August 1869) that Colonel Pelly had liven Syud Azan permission to transport ammunition, stores, &amp;c., along the Oman Coast that lies between Sohar on the north and ilas-el-Had on the south. \\ hereon this Govern ment passed the folknving Resolution, dated 11th November Vide Abstract of Proceedings of the 1869 ' Colonel Disbrowe's letter to His Highness Syud Sa- Govemment of Bombay in the Poli- } em no t seem accurately to represent the permission given tical Department for November | JV Colonel Pelly and concurred in by Government which was 1869. Euti&gt; i O. . pagt . ^ transport by sea the ordinary supplies .of ammunition and stores required by forts in his possession. Any extraordinary supplies for a force in the field would properlv be stopped.' This Resolution, which clearly indicated the interpretation placed bv this Government on the orders of Sir J. Lawrence, as modified by the subsequent ruling ot the Government of India, was communicated to Colonel Pelly, and became the rule tor e guidance of our officers in the Gulf. The Government of India neither at the time nor since have expressed any dissent as to the correctness of this intorpietation. 4 ' 10. At a later date, a reference was made to this Government by Colonel Pelly fo^ instructions as to whether Syud Toorkee should be permitted to cross the Gulf mto Mu ^ at territory. Although it was clear that he could have but one object m landing on t le - ra &gt; Coast, it did not appear to this Government that his crossing even with a hostile intent came under the term 'naval operations/ and that to prevent his doing so would be an active inter ference in favor of Syud Azan and his Government. And accordingly Colonel Pelly was instructed thus by telegram :—' If Syud Toorkee attempts to cross to Soor or Bahrein with an armed following, you are at once to prevent him; but if he embarks alone with on y ^ personal servants, you are not to interfere/ In pursuance of these instructions, yu Toorkee was permitted to cross the Gulf and joined the armed, forces in his inteu&gt; o had seized and occupied Soor. These orders having been reported to the Government o n la, the following reply was received :— f Unless maritime peace is broken and warlike opera ions are being carried on by sea, no interference should take place. Colonel Pelly should not preven Toorkee going to Soor alone or with a few followers. \ iceroy agrees in opinion expresse m your telegram.' ' 11. Having been joind by the most powerful tribes of the south, it was rumoured that Syud Toorkee intended to send an expedition by sea to attack Muttra, Such an expe ^ would necessarily have proceeded within Muscat waters along the Coast in the sa ' ae „ ' would an expedition from Muscat to Birkah or Muttra; but he was warned by Colone e }( 53 ) be^revenTpd'w'f , il( 1&gt; ™' H ' ,ltlon 1 ' c 8 arJni 8' warlike operations by sea, and that it would abandoned ^ ara18 rf ne0e « n! y- Alld ^ntion, it ft wa s entertained, was orders lh^ h r is a ''tf. reVie T ' £ af f air3 in the Gulf of C)man ' lowing the original the L tw&lt; h^f' t h m0 j e '1 which those orders have, in repeated instances during the tart two years been interpreted and acted on by this Government and their officers in the Gnlt I proceed to consider the ease which forms the subject of the present correspondence. . ' 1 '\ tl ' s instance the instructions of Government were requested on the followino- mw bTLldiTi T C 's T J0 'l Wa y, to , C olouel PellyIt is not impossible that an attempt IvnL t ( ' e &amp; y' d toorbee out of boor, and I would solicit instructions in case the Muscat (government wish to make any such attempt from seaward/ And the following tele graphic reply was given, dated 9th January last:— f The permission to Muscat Government to remtorce garrisons on coast by sea cannot be continued now that a state of war exists in 1 iuscat temtory, as we should thus abandon our neutral position between the combatants. All military operations by sea must be prevented.' '14. These are the instructions to which the Government of India have now taken exception and with regard to which it is stated in the despatch to the Secretary of State that they are (1) at variance with the instructions issued by the Goverment of India on 4th Auo-ust 1869; and (2) are such as it was beyond the competency of any subordinate Government to give without the previous sanction of the Governor-General in Council. ' 15. With regard to the former of these points, it is to be observed that the letter of the Government of India of 4th August 1869 does not contain instructions of any kind. It simply conveys the approval of the \ iceroy in Council ' of the interpretation of the orders of the Supreme Government relative to operations at sea contained in the letter from Colonel Pelly to the address of Colonel Disbrowe/ dated 27th May 1869. It is true that Colonel Pelly inti mates the opinion that the orders of Sir J. Lawrence were mainly directed against expeditions such as might be contemplated from Mekran or Bunder Abbass against Muscat, or from Muscat for the recovery of those possessions; but it may be observed that such a limitation is altogether inconsistent with the distinct statement of the policy of the Government of India contained in their despatch of October 11th, 1869, of which the orders themselves were only a more explicit enunciation, and at variance with the circumstances which existed at the time as reported by Colonel 1 elly himself [vide paragraph 6 above). And this Government, therefore, understood the approval of the Government of India to apply to the instruction given by Colonel Pellv and not to the arguments on which they were based, and to indicate that the original orders of Sir J. Lawrence, namely, that ' naval operations by any party at Muscat or anywhere else should be prevented by force of arms if necessary/ still held good; but that the prohibition did not extend to the transport by sea of ordinary supplies and reliefs for the simple reason that such transport did not constitute 'naval operations/ Accordingly in their Resolution of 11th November 1869, this Government held that the prohibition was in force with regard to the transport of f extraordinary supplies for a force in the field/ And, in the present instance, it is submitted that tkere can be no reasonable doubt that sending artillery to troops that were being collected to drive an invading force from their position is a warlike operation by sea. It appears, therefore, to His Excellency in Council that the instructions of this Government on the 9th of January last, so far from being at variance, were in strict accordance with the orders of the Government of India as they stood at the time when the letter of the 4th of August 1869 had been received by this Government. And, further. His Excellency in Council cannot resist the conclusion that if an opportunity had been afforded to him of recalling to the recollection of the Government of India the Resolution of November 11th, 1869, to which I have adverted, their views of the action taken by this Government in the present instance would have been materially modified. It will be apparent to the Government of India that that Resolution was sufficiently explicit to have justified Major Way in preventing the trans port of artillery under the circumstances noted without further reference to Government, and that, in reply to Colonel Felly's request for instructions, it would have been sufficient for Government to have referred him to that Resolution for his guidance. ' 16. With regard to the second point, I am desired to convey the assurance of His Excellency in Council that he has no desire whatever to trench upon the authority secured to the Right Hon'ble the Governor-General in Council by Acts 13 and 33 of Geo. III. The sole object of this Government has been to carry out without question or hesitation the policy of the Government of India. In cases of emergency, and in cases in which the construction of the existing orders seemed too clear to admit of a reasonable doubt. His Excellency in Council has from time to time given the necessary instructions to the officers on the spot. This amount of discretion is conceded by the Government of India even to Colonel Pelly and other local officers. But in cases where a doubt exists, the local Government would equally, by rule, and for their own protection, feel themselves bound to refer to the Supreme Government. '17. In the case which has given rise to the present correspondence, His Excellency in Council has, from your despatch to the Secretary of State, learnt with regret that the orders given , by him in January last are opposed to the policy of the Government of India, who( 54 ) i 11 have allowed to Svnd Azan what they refused to Syud Toorkee. It intimate that they womu . ^ ^ ^ a t . ourse w ould have been inconsistent with our appears to His ^ceUe'^ laid down by Sir J. Lawrence. If, however, the local declared neutrality • l » d i4 Um that the altered policy, stated m your despateh to Government had had «»' • • ^ ^ , )V the Government of India, it would have been the Secretary ot Mate, n i ^ ^ they di(1 was simp i y t 0 interpret, and, as it their duty »t ^ h » ^ U1 Coancil , reasonably to interpret, antecedent orders in execu- still appears to His Jixce ^ t0j the instructions laid down by Sir J. tion of, not in rcve.s ^ j obedience was enforced by an act of war such an act of Lawrence.

The ^na^ considerations which have influenced His Excellency m Council in comim'to Semination are. that, as guardian of the public - Ti f t hP Government of India is bound to interfere m the course of ordei and Mcurity a-ainst confusion and violence.

Pelly to Colonel Disbrowe, the pmport of the Gov- . 116 - 1 f- ^ eminent of India's approval of which is so com pletely misunderstood by the Government of Bombay. 'Synd Azan had embarked munitions of war on board one of his crafts in view of throwing them into the port of Burka, Colonel Disbrowe warned him of instructions received from the Government of India to prevent operations at sea by force, if necessary Syud Azan persisted in his embarkation and the craft left. Colonel Disbrowe, to mark his sense of Azan's disregard of the in] unction, hauled down his flag. Colonel Pelly ' doubted whether the Viceroy would desire to apply the orders to craft leaving the port of Muscat in view to ammunitioning the Forts of Oman, situate on the unbroken coast line of the Muscat dominions proper between Ras-ool-Had and Sohar. A craft so plying, he said, would pass along the continuous coast line of the Muscat State, and 'need never be more than gun-shot distance trom the water line. Hence the craft need nevel* leave what are constructively considered to be territories of - the State, and unless caught at sea en route at more than gun-shot distance from the water line would not come under the category of a craft operating by sea. ' The case of a craft crossing from the Muscat port, or the Muscat Coast to the outlying territories of Mekran or Bunder Abbass is obviously different, because to reach those outlying regions the craft must quitt he Muscat Coast and cross the sea.'. But Colonel Disbrowe was Ly no means satisfied as to the justness of Colonel t Proceedings, August 18G9, Nos. P e ^y s judgment, and wrote + to the Bombay Gov- 158-159. ernment representing ' the risks run in granting such a concession.' If Syud Azan, a Buler ' not recognized by us, be permitted to move muni tions along the coast by sea, will not Syud Salem, the Ex-Sovereign, who pretends to be endeavouring to recover his throne in like manner, consider himself per mitted to move with munitions down the coast by sea ? ' Again, even though no open enemy should appear, does not the permission to despatch vessels with munitions stand in danger of being abused ? So long as no temptation be thrown in the way, Syud Azan would probably respect, and cause to be respected, so val able a concession, but let temptation to plunder or violence arise, will not the case assume an altered complexion ? ' To allow a particle of law on the waters to barbarous authorities like these, enveloped as they are in tyrannical prejudices, appears to be dangerous. Had Syud Azan been a just and popular lluler, a Ruler, too, recognized by us, of course the movement of troops and munitions by sea would have been his right; yet for all that would not our maritime supremacy receive a shock did outrages like these, no matter by whom committed, pass unchecked by us ?' remarks which, as usual, the Bombay Government passed on to the Government of India without comment. \ The Bombay letter No. 256, dated 25th June, sending on the letters in which Colonel Disbrowe raised these objections, was received by the Govern- o ta* , A A . 10™ AT 11 Q meut of India on the Ist July. It was not till the ngu^t . , /ith August that, by No. 1076, the Government of India issued that approval of Colonel Pelly's interpretation of its order, which the Bombay Government now seeks to d,eprive of all force. Obviously, if theGovernment of India had tliou^lit Colonel Pelly based his interpretation, which was impugned by Colonel Disbrowe, on any wrong argument, it would have taken notice thereof. On the 3rd August (nearly two months after its receipt, 1| months after they had passed it on without remark), the Bombay Government answered Colonel Disbrowe's letter of the 11th June, impugning Colonel Felly's interpre tation on the orders of Government, and said that Colonel Felly's ' view of the case was correct. The movement of reinforcements from one part of the terri- torv io. the possession ot Syud -A.zan to another cannot be considered, in the cir cumstances under which it took place, a hostile movement. Each case must stand on its own merits. If active hostilities were being carried on in the vici- nity, or on the adjacent coast of Muscat, the case would he different.' And this answer the Government of India in No. 1177, dated 23rd August 1869, approved without, perhaps, noticing the force of the words printed in italics, and which it is odd tl'iat the Bombay Government have not now brought forward to prove their point. On the 10th August 1869, Colonel Disbrowe wrote the following reply to a question on the part of the Ex-Ruler Syud Salem, as to whether Government had nven to Azan a permission to act by sea which had been refused to him. ' I have nothing whatsoever to do with the land, but as regards the sea, Colonel Pelly has. pending further instructions from Government, given Syud Azan permis sion to transport ammunition, stores, &amp;c., along the Oman Coast, that lies be tween Sohar on the north and llas-el-IIad on the south. This permission and nothing further, but no irregularity nor violence is permitted on the sea. 4 It becomes now my duty to inform Your Highness that this permission has been granted by Colonel Pelly to Syud Azan and to no one (Ise, further, to warn you that vessels belonging to any other party or parties that may be (found) on the sea having on board warlike stores or armed men, will render themselves liable to be immediately captured or sunk by Her Majesty's Gun boats serving under my orders, and this course will be pursued by me until instructions to the contrary reach me from Government.' He sent this up to the Government of Bombay in his No. 459, dated 18th August. The Bombay Government, in their No. 373, * dated 10th September 1869, sent on the paper, without remark, to the Govern- * s. I. No*. 223 to 232 of 1869. of tlmg l eav ing it to be Supposed that they saw nothing to dissent from in Colonel Disbrowe's reply. But two months later, nearly three months after the date of Colonel Disbrowe s letter, they passed the Resolution of 11th November, above referred to, dissenting trom the tenor of Colonel Disbrowe's reply for the following reason : ' Colonel Disbrowe's letter to His Highness Syud Salem does not seem accurately to represent the permission given by Colonel Pelly, and concurred in by Government, which was to transport by sea the ordinary supplies 01 am munition and stores required by forts in his possession. ^ Any extraor inary supplies for a force in the field would properly be stopped. In this Resolution the Bombay Government obviously missed just the very point of the argument which made Colonel Felly's the correct \iew. ey i not report the Resolution to Government, but left it to be disco\ ere m leir volume of Proceedings. As has already been observed, a local Governmen can not pretend to be functus officio when, instead of reporting a proceeding, i eav the supreme controlling authority to find out what it has done. 171. The answer to the Bombay Government was as iollows: (No. 1327P., dated mh June 1871.) 'I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 2145, dated last, conveying certain remarks on passages in the Secret despatch of the Governmen o n( 57 ) for St « 0 V 18 ' ^ ^ ^ a 0f which was to™*** confidentially 12th April 0 Excellency the Governor of Bombay, in my letter No. 24C.P., dated 7 ^ wr letter explains that the omission to report immediately to the Government of India the telegram sent on the 9th January to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, was owing .o an oversight in the Secretary's Office, and it expresses the great regret of His Excel lency in Council that this error should have occurred. At the same time it adds that the Gov ernment of India are scarcely accurate in stating that the instructions of 9th Januarv have never been reported to the Government of India, as they were embodied in explicit terms in the Kesolution of the Bombay Government of the 14th January, which found a place in the volume ot Proceedings submitted on the 4th February. '3. Were it not for this remark, and the belief which from paragraph 9 of vour letter the Governor-General in Council infers that the Bombay Government entertain, viz., that the omission to criticize entries in the Monthly Abstract of Proceedings implies an approval of those proceedings, the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council would not have thought it necessary to point out that no inference whatsoever regarding the opinion of the Government of India, either for or against any particular measure is to be drawn from the fact of no notice being taken of it on receipt of the Proceedings Volumes, and that the periodical submission of Proceedings Volumes does not absolve any local Government, least of all when the proceed ings are printed only in Abstract, from the duty of reporting at once, and specially all acts or orders affecting the Imperial policy. ' 4. The Resolution of 14th January was duly placed before the Governor-General in Council when the despatch of 3rd April' was written. But there was nothing at that time before the Government of India, nor is there yet, to connect the telegraphic orders of 9th January with the Resolution of the 14th January. If, as may be inferred from your letter under reply, both orders were in reply to the Resident's letter of '3rd December on which the Resolution was based, that letter is not even now before the Government of India, and the Abstract of it in the Proceedings Volume gives no indication of its contents, except that it related to ' the movements of His Highness Syud Toorkee/ The telegram of 9 th January is ' The permission to Muscat Government » very distinct prohibition of all military operations by sea, to reinforce gamson on coast by sea whether onensive or defensive. Major \\ ay expressly stated cannot be continued. * # # # in his report of the 25th January that he acted on the instruc- 4 11 Rented ' perati0ns by ** ^ tioils conve y ed in . th ® &lt;&gt;f the 9th. That he under- C plucn (&lt; ' stood them as prohibiting not offensive operations only, but all military operations by sea is evident, for the boat which was sunk by his orders was proceeding with a purely defensive object to the Fort of Muttra, distant only two-half miles from Muscat, and still in the possession of Azan bin Gheis. Indeed, the Resolution of 14th January could hardly have reached Major Way when the boat was sunk on the 23rd of that month. Moreover, when, on 23rd February, the report of the Political Agent's proceedings was forwarded to the Government of India, with the remark that the commendation of the Bombay Government had been communicated to the Political Agent for his energetic and judicious action, no allusion was made in your report to the Resolution of 14th January, nor does it appear to have been observed that, if the orders of the Bombay Government referred to offensive operations only, the com mendation bestowed on the Political Agent was somewhat misplaced. ' 5. His Excellency in Council does not consider that any advantage to the public interests will be gained by discussing at length the arguments advanced in paragraphs 5 to 15 of your letter. He will merely remark that he cannot approve of the endeavour which is made to de stroy the force of the letter of the Government of India of 4th August 1869, on the ground that it does not contain instructions of any kind, but simply conveys the approval of ' the interpretation of the orders of the Supreme Government relative to operations at sea, contained in the letter from Colonel Pelly to the address of Colonel Disbrowe, dated 27th May, No. 52/ His Excellency in Council does not understand the distinction between approval of a proposal and instructions to carry it out, or between approval of the interpretation of orders and instruc tions to act on the orders in the sense approved. That the interpretation put on the orders of Gov ernment by Colonel Pelly, and approved by the Government of India, prohibited interference with the transport of warlike stores by the Ruler of Muscat between points on the unbroken coast line of the Muscat dominions, provided the boats did not go beyond gun-shot from the shore or leave the waters which are constructively considered to be the territories of the State, does not admit of question. Had this interpretation not been superseded by the telegram of the Bombay Government of the 9th January, directing that -'all military operations by sea must be pre sented,' those unfortunate circumstances would not have occurred, on which His Excellency in Council has found it his duty to animadvert. a 6. In paragraph 17 of the despatch under acknowledgment, a remark is made that the Government of India f intimate that they would have allowed to Syud Azan what they refused to Svud Toorkee.' His Excellency in Council has not been able to perceive in any part of the despatch of the 3rd April the grounds for this statement. No such intimation is either made or implied in any portion of the despatch.

CHAPTER VIII.—(S ections 173—192.) RENEWAL OF LEASE OP BUNDER ABBASS TO MUSCAT RULER. 173 Vu outline of the relations of the Sultans of Muscat towards Bunder Abbass is aiven in'Wheeler's Summary of Affairs in the Foreign Department of the Government of India, 1804-1869, pages l.)2-153. Mr Girdlestone's note on events in Oman subsequent to the expulsion of Syud Salem,§ 16, continues the summary. 174 On 13th March 1871 Syud Toorkee applied for Colonel Felly's mee in arrancriner for the lease ol the Hunder Abbass districts, upon A\hich Colonel Felly asked the instructions of Government. 175. The Under-Secretary noted on this request— ' As regards Bun dor Abbass it will be remembered that, with considerable difficulty, and only after Syud Salem had been on the point of blockading the port. Colonel Felly managed to negotiate*a renewal of the lease to Syud Salem and his descendants, the continuance thereof to any conqueror who might take possession of Oman and Muscat being expressly barre . ' When Azan bin Gheis turned out Salem the lease ceased, and Hajee Ahmed, a Ministei of Salem, was appointed Governor ostensibly in the interest of Persia. And with the approval of the Government of India the Bombay Government deferred taking any action in the matUT till it turned out who would eventually be Sultan of Muscat, saying at the same time that the reasons which induced the British Government to desire that Bunder Abbass should be attached to Muscat still existed (those reasons being the interests of trade in the Persian Gulf, which were benefited by the habitual liberality of the Oman people in such matters). * a In September 1869 Sheikh Saeed, a former Governor of Bunder Abass, on the part of Sultan Thoweynee, recaptured it, but was immediately afterwards turned out by Hajee Ahmed. ' Colonel Felly might be desired quietly to ignore Syud Toorkee's present mention of the Bunder Abbass lease. As soon as Syud Toorkee feels himself quite secure, he will most probab y follow the example of Salem and threaten Bunder Abbass, unless there is a renewal of the ease, to which he, as a son of Syud Saeed, has the strongest claim. Then would be the time when the British Government might most advantageously step in.' 176. In the despatch No. 30, of 23rd May 1871, to the Secretary of State, the Government of India wrote;— 'As regards the lease of Bunder Abbass, we have to remind lour (J race that, in our Secret despatch No 31, dated 27th May 1870, we solicited the instructions of Her Majesty s Govern ment on the question whether we should hold out to Azan any hopes of the exercise o om friendly offices with Persia for the purpose of obtaining the restoration of the lease of Bun er Abbass. To that despatch no answer has arrived. The present claimant, Syud Toorkee, is no a descendant of Syud Salem, and, therefore, he cannot claim under the lease of 1868 , an , although he is a son of Sultan Saeed, with whom the engagement of 1855 was contractu , }e the agreement of 1868 having been made with the de facto Government of the day at - ^ s( ^' may not unreasonably be considered to have superseded that of 1855, and, in virtue o e termination of the engagement of 1868, Persia has already entered into possession ot bun ei Abbass. ^ ....... ■» .... . ** ' ■ ■ • 3S (i'llK- ■ ■ fij .

Ihe Viceroy wrote to Mr. Alison demi-officially statins what had occurred, and asking for his opinion whether, under the altered circumstances of the case, he thought the Persian Government would object seriously to the renewal of the lease. r . 1 -3 '^' to - iw -T 1^71 (in xSo. 2382, frciin Bombay Government, 5th June 18/1) Syud ioorkee wrote again:— i i / ,&gt;nm ^ er Abbass, Ahmed has recently not been going on satisfactorily, and has been building without foundations, on this account the people have been desiring that I should lease Bunder Abbass and put them at their ease. ' I hope you will without delay arrange my affairs with Bunder Abbass. I do not seek Bunder Abbass with a view- to profit, but to make the people comfortable.' With reference to the despatch. No. 27, of 23rd May 1871, to the Secre tary of State, the India Office addressed the Eoreign Office:— ' The \ iceroy enquires whether Pier Majesty's Government are prepared to exercise their good offices with the (xovernment of His Majesty the Shah of Persia to obtain the restoration of the lease of Bunder Abbass to Syud Toorkee. • With reference to this question, I am to state that the Duke of Argyll was prepared to recommend the renewal of the lease in favour of Syud Azan bin Gheis, had he remained supreme at Muscat. And His Grace is of opinion that there are still stronger reasons for using our friendly offices on behalf of a member of the family of Syud Saeed. He would, therefore, suggest that Lord Granville, if he should see no reason, to the contrary, should place himself in communication with Mr. Alison, with a view to his obtaining from the Persian Government the restoration to the present Ruler of Muscat of the privilege in question.' 179. &gt; The Poreign Office, accordingly, issued in July or August 1871 a despatch to Mr. Alison, Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran— ' The Governor-General of India has called the attention of Her Majesty's Government to an application which has been made by the present Ruler of Muscat to be'recognized as such by the British Government, and that they should use their influence with the Persian Govern ment to obtain for him a renewal of the lease of Bunder Abbass. ' Various changes have taken place in the Government of Muscat since the' lease was renewed in 1868 to the then existing Ruler, the Persian Government appear to have considered that agreement as terminated by those changes, and to have again entered into possession of Bunder Abbass. It will, however, be known to the Persian Government that, whereas some objection was raised at the time the to renewal of the lease to Syud Salem, on the score that he had obtained the sovereignty of Muscat by usurpation and violence, no such objection can be urged against the present Ruler, who is a son of Sultan Saeed with whom the Persian Government entered into an engagement in 1855, that he should farm the port of Bunder Abbass under cer tain conditions at an annual rent of 12,000 tomans. ' Under these circumstances I have to instruct you to use your good offices with the view of obtaining from the Persian Government the restoration to the present Ruler of Muscat of the privilege granted to his father in 1855.' 180. On the 28th July Mr. Alison telegraphed to the Viceroy :— ' This Government appears disposed to farm Bunder Abbass to Syud Toorkee, but have doubts about his stability and solvency. The Shah will be here in a few days and I will let you know T further.' 181. In his News-report, dated 17th July 1871, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported' that disturbances were said to have broken out at Bunder Abbass, consequent upon the Governor of Minao having collected a force with the intention of expelling Hajee Ahmed from the Government. The- latter was preparing to resist. All was quiet at sea and on the Arab Coast. 182. Prom the enclosure to the Bombay Government letters (Nos. 3829 and 3830, dated 17th August 1871) it appeared that the people of Bunder Abbass complained to the Prince Governor of Pars against the exactions of Hajee Ahmed, and that the latter had consented to proceed to Shiraz to answer the charges. • .I S- On the 19t1i June the British Native Agent at Ldngah stated that w received from Bunder Ahbass that Agha Mahsin, the brother of Ahmed Sh .h had raised an army of 1,500 men for the purpose of attacking Bonder U.ha'ss, and that Hajee Ahmed was preparing for an encounter; that •Mimed Shah had taken Minao from the hands of Hajee Ahmed s Governor, n-hom he had driven to Bunder Ahbass. The Bombav Government said that it did not know who were Agha Mahsin ,11 i Mimed Shah. The Native Agent at Shiraz had said that Hajee Ahmed owed -&gt;0 000 tomans to the ' Dewan' on account of last year's revenue, and that he had this vcar received revenue from the ryots, but had given nothing to 'the Devi an' The Botahav Government suggested that Agha Malisin and Alimed Shah might be officers of ' the Bewan' referred to by the Agent at ^ j The Bombay Government were asked to ascertain who the men were. 184. Mr. Alison's telegram was answered on 8th September ;— a your telegram of 28th July. How have negotiations progressed for obtaining lease of Bunder Abbass for Syud Toorkee? Hajee Ahmed^s defalcations (your letter, 14th July, to Viceroy) may dispose Shah to accept good offices for Toorkee.' 185. Mr. Alison replied on September 10th « Your Lordship's telegram of 8th. Nothing is yet settled, and some delay is occasioned by the absence of the Persian Secretary, who is especially cognizant of those matters. Would Syud Toorkee be prepared to send an Agent here to negotiate and conclude v ' 186. On 23rd September Mr. Alison again reported ' Shah will not consent to re-lease Bunder Abbass to the Imam of Muscat. Hajee Ahmed Khan was received lately at Shiraz with honor and reconfirmed. ' The Persian Government has no intelligence of the alarming state of affairs at Bunder Abbass as reported in despatch from Pelly of 23rd July. To which the Government of India replied (No. 210GP., 4th October 1871) '• a Yours of 23rd September regarding Bunder Abbass. Endeavour to persuade Persian Government not to decide finally till you hear further by post.'' 187. In reply to a telegram asking whether Syud Toorkee would be pre pared to send an Envoy to Teheran, the Government of Bombay sent on a reply from Colonel Pelly that he would gladly do so if he had reason to expect that the mission would prove successful. Colonel Pelly would telegraph again after communication with Syud Toorkee. 188. The Government of India wrote to Mr. Alison (No. 2148P., 7th October 1871) :— ' With reference to your telegram of 23rd September, reporting that His Majesty the Shah will not consent to re-lease Bunder Abbass to the Sultan of Muscat, the \ iceroy and Governor-General in Council desires me to express a hope that you will be able to induce the Persian Government at all events to allow the question to remain an open one, and to abstain from giving any final decision at present. ' From the papers which I have the honor to enclose* Your Excellency will perceive tliat , since his accession to the Government of Muscat, Syud SS Toorkee ha S on three oecasions solicited the good office March, and 465-115, dated 6th of the British Government with a view to obtain tor mm a May 1871. . re-lease of Bunder Abbass. 'Considering the length of time during which the Muscat (rovernment have been entrusted with the administration of this sea-port, the friendly relations which it is desirable to see established between all the Governments possessing authority on the shores of the Persian • Gulf, and the assistance which would be given to Syud Toorkee in consolidating his authority in Muscat, if His Majesty the Shah were to exhibit his confidence in the present Ruler by re-leasing Bunder Abbass on reasonable terms, considering also how very desirable it is that the British Government should be enabled to strengthen its influence at Muscat by the successful exercise of its good offices in the matter, His Excellency in Council desires me to express the hope that you will continue your endeavours, as opportunity may offer, to bring about so desirable a result, or, at all events, to prevent the question being finally closed by a decision adverse to Syud Toorkee's hopes.3i { 61 ) tW / IlS Ex f 1 ' ene y 111 Council is mdnced to urge this more stronrrly by the consideration that, on receipt of your telegram of 10th September, a communication was made through the Ka? toneS TnT g ^ ^ W0U,&lt;1 be P-Pa-dl setl an A?e'11 has been i4ei^d W TT^t T' , to that ^mniioation a favourable answer nas oeen received. Yout Excellency will easily understand what embarrassments will arise if S issuoTth 0DS gave rise to a reasonable expectation of a Syud Toorkoe that^l^P r ^Council is under the necessity of informing oyua looikee that the Persian Government decline to renew the lease.' 189. On IStli October 1871 Colonel Pelly (in No. 5778, from Bombay Government, 30th November) submitted in detail the views of His Highness the said 0n &lt; l uestlo n a re-lease of the Bunder Abbass districts. He ' The gist of His Highness' arguments seems to be that he would be very desirous of ^-leasing the Bunder Abbass districts, provided he could do so on the terms accorded to the ±&gt;x-bultaa Syud Salem; provided, further, that,the negotiation for the lease could be carried lough without extravagant outlay at the Court of Persia; and provided, lastly, that if prac ticable the negotiation should be entirely in the hands of Colonel Pelly, or f officer of similar rank, the Muscat Envoy being merely present for form's sake/ m • Ml ; f lison char ^ ed Mr - Dickson with a message to Sadr Azem, the onah s Prime Minister, with the view of renewing the subject of the lease of Bunder Abbass, and reported (15th December 1871) that the Sadr Azem's lan guage was unfavourable, but (as requested in the despatch of the Government of Incba, No. 2148P., of 7th October 1871) he would not omit any good opportunity of bringing this matter before the Shah's Government. 191. To Mr. Dickson Sadr Azem said that he did not believe that the Shah meant strictly what his reply did literally convey. He entered into the early history of the question, recounting how previously an Agent of one of the Imams imprisoned a Persia,n Governor of Bunder Abbass for whose release Her Majesty's Government refused to intercede, and which was only obtained by a renewal of the lease. He said it would be humiliating to the Persian Government, who can perfectly maintain their country, to have to rent a posses sion to a family who, after having professed their allegiance to Persia, cast upon it the grossest indignity. Persia, he added, would always value England's fiiendly advice and do her best to meet the wishes of Her Majesty's Govern ment and would protect British traders : any Agent of the Imam would not be officially recognized, though he would be treated with proper respect. 192. Mr. Alison (dated 18th December 1871) had since heard officially and reported the appointment of Ahmed Shah, of Minab, to the Government of Bunder Abbass, in the room of Hajee Ahmed Khan who has been dismissed. The Native Agent at Lingah reported (enclosure in Bombay Government letter No. 1034, dated 20th February 1872) of the intention to sell the landed property of Hajee Ahmed Khan (his horses having been sold already), who was still in confinement and under a guard. 13-3-72. 0.

The further papers were accordingly transmitted to the Secretary of State regarding the affairs of Oman, and the favor of an early reply requested to despatches on the question Of the Zanzibar subsidy. (No. 43, dated 15th March 1872.) 194. Prom subsequent correspondence,* it appeared that Commander Lod- * From Bombay, No. 1327, dated 5tii der.

A repre sentative party of four went on board next day, and informed Commander Lodder that there were about 12 British traders at Sohar, and a few more at Saharn, all wishing to leave. As they could not be ready before four or five days, he promised that a vessel of war should return and embark them for Mus cat, where they wished to go; and, according to his letter of 2nd February to t From Bombay, No. 1655, dated isth Major Boss, he sent Commander Doughty with the March 1872. Magpie to call at Sohar and Saharn.f Commander Doughty offered the British subjects at Sohar and Saharn a passage to Muscat. Ibrahim being reported to be at Sohar and to have moved off inland. They were only willing to go if he would wait four days and receive their frieghts of corn, &amp;c., the only complaint made was at Saharn that Ibrahim had not paid for some rice bought. On 15th February Commander Doughty telegraphed the report at Muscat that Salim bin Thoweynee meditated a hostile landing at Sur. Toorkee had applied to Major Boss for the moral support of the presence of a ship of war, which the Political Agent thought would be for the general good. See § 158, No orders were issued. 195. In their No. 1424, dated 8th March 1872, the Bombay Government , , ' CT ^ , sent up two letters 1 from Colonel Belly re^ardinff 1 No. 1019-269, dated 12th September ,, i j i? j • ^ 3 i/u • • ? 1871, with enclosures, the plunder oi a native cratt and the imprisonment No. 1250-364, dated 2ist November 0 f some British Indian subiects bv Ibrahim bin i8/i, wuh cndosuu^. Ghais at Sohar, and submitted their views. Major Boss reported to Colonel Pelly on 10th August 1871 that a small native bugareh laden with merchandize to the value of $1,600, the property of banyan traders, and bound from Muscat to Shinas, was seized by Syed Ibrahim's orders, when passing within a few miles of the coast near Sohar ; that about $600 worth of the property was restored on the affair being represented to Syed Ibrahim bin Ghais; that his interference had been requested to obtain restitution of the remainder. Major Boss not feeling warranted to address Ibrahim direct, referred the matter to Syed Toorkee, who communicated with Ibrahim. From the latter's reply, it appeared that he was urged to take the property by the necessities of his posi tion at the time, and 'that he would compensate the owners. Subsequently Ibrahim wrote on the 12th September 1871 to Major Boss, and from the tone of his letter, it appeared that he meditated evading the restitution of the banyan's property, on the ground that the provisions were being sent by Toorkee for his troops. On enquiry Major Boss was of opinion that the buglah was not fitted out with munitions of war, although it was admitted that there two of Toorkee's followers on board. Major Boss did not answer Ibrahim, waiting to see what he would do. On 9th October Major Boss transmitted the deposition of a Khojah, mer chant of Khabooreh, brother of the men who were imprisoned by Ibrahim at Khabooreh. This deposition stated, that 'ov 19tli September 1871 Ibrahim bin Ghais of Sohar came to Khabooreh and demanded 30 bae-s of rice from his brother Hameyd. That Hameyd refused, unless on payment of ready money That Ibrahim offered to pay 'afterwards; but that deponent, who was present, stated to Ibrahim that they had previously on two occasions given supplies to Azan and were not paid.taSBSSaBBOBBeBBSfflBB ( 64 ) Til at they were pressed by Ibrahim and refused to comply with his demand, stating to himthey were under British protection, and not his subjects. That Ibrahim thrice repeat^ his demand and was thrice refused by Hameyd. That thereupon Ibrahim ordered Hameyd and Somw ar and Dosa to be imprisoned and placed in irons. That they were at once imprisoned, and irons placed in their legs. That deponent was present and a witness of this; that many persons wit nessed this affair; that he, deponent, was not imprisoned ; that his brothers Hameyd and Som- war and Dosa were imprisoned, and put in irons on the 19th September, and on the 20th, about mid-day, were released. That no rice was taken from them, nor was any money taken.' There was no doubt that the Khojahs were imprisoned, because they refused to meet Ibrahim's demand for rice unless he paid; they claimed British Consu lar protection. At Colonel Felly's suggestion Major Ross sent to Syed Toorkee a copy of the last letter he had received from Ibrahim, to which Toorkee replied:— 'I have received your letter regarding- the plundering of certain banyans (Britishsubjects) by Ibrahim. In my opinion the only way to obtain restoration of the property is for the Gov ernment (British) to demand the same under severe threats of coercion. My demands would be ineffectual without using force.' The Bombay Government were of opinion that, as we have recognized Toorkee as Sultan, we should do nothing that could bear the appearance of en tering into a negociation or apparent negociation with Ibrahim, and if the Sul tan was unable to inflict punishment or give redress, that we should do it ourselves. They accordingly recommended for consideration of Government of India that Colonei- Pelly be authorized, if he had satisfied himself of the truth of the complaint, to direct the Lynx to proceed to Sohar, and require the payment of double the value of the property taken by Ibrahim, and of such compensation as Colonel Pelly should fix (say $200 each man) for the imprisonment of the traders entitled to British protection. 196. The Government of India issued orders to Government of Bombay. (No. 783P., dated 2nd April 1872.) ' Although the rule of Syed Toorkee over the Oman territories is far from effective, and he has in a measure recognized Ibrahim bin Ghais as in quasi-independent possession of Sohar, yet as the British Government has recognized the succession of Syed Toorkee to the Muscat throne, it was undoubtedly correct to address him in the first place on the subject. As, how ever, he has admitted his inability to procure redress from Ibrahim bin Ghais, His Excellency in Council sees no objection to a direct demand being made on the latter for redress on account of the imprisonment of the three British subjects, and the plunder of the boat. These acts were distinct violations of the rights secured to British subjects by Treaty ; the latter act, indeed, was one of piracy. 'While admitting the necessity for demanding compensation for the violated rights of British subjects, it appears to His Excellency in Council that in the present condition of Ibra him's finances, it would be impossible for him to pay the amount proposed by the Bombay Government, and that by making a demand disproportionate to his means, the prospects of an amicable settlement will be lessened. After Colonel Pelly has satisfied himself of the truth of the complaints preferred, and after he has heard and disposed of the allegation that the boat was carrying contraband of war. His Excellency in Council empowers him to demand the restoration of the plundered property or payment of its value together with 10 per cent, of the value in addition, as compensation to the owners; he is also empowered to demand compensa tion at the rate of ^100 a head for the persons imprisoned. In case of a refusal to comply with these demands or to give such other satisfaction as Colonel Pelly may think reasonable. Colonel Pelly is authorized to bombard the town after giving the inhabitants 48 hours' notice of his intention to do so. All action in this matter should be taken promptly. Coionel Pelly should be directed to proceed in the first instance to Muscat, and take thence with him to Sohar a responsible officer of His Highness Syed Toorkee, who will be useful both in negotiating an amicable settlement and in giving greater regularity to the retnbutue measures that will be necessary, should negotiation fail. I am not to conclude without communicating the regret of His Excellency in Council at the delay that has taken P f ce , ^ a ca8 ^ ^ h ere action ought to have been prompt and decided.

He urgently requests that both parties in present civil strife may be prohibited operat ing by «ea, as was the case when Syed Toorkee was opposing Azan's Government.' These were the demands referred to in § 196. This compliance was consi dered satisfactory. The Bombay letter No. 2418, dated 24th April, showed that Syed Toorkee went with a force of Ghafiree tribes to Semayel in order to coerce a refractory tribe. The Political Agent arrived at Muscat on the 7th April in the Kwantung. Communication with the south-eastern districts was cut off owing to the disturbing presence of Salim. The Bullfinch anchored at Muscat on 14th April. • 200. The Secretary noted on Ibrahim's request, that both sides should be prohibited from operations by sea, that there seemed to be no necessity for making any communication to him at all adding— ' we have acknowledged Toorkee as ruler of Muscat, and there is no reason why we should acknowledge Ibrahim as a belligerent or hold any communication, with him as to the manner in which Syed Toorkee may see fit to endeavour to assert his authority. Toorkee, however, seems in a bad way. 'No orders needed.' 201.

While Toorkee has failed to consolidate his power by force of arms, his antagonists have been imahle to effect a successful coalition against his authority. The want of money debarred all parties from operations of any magnitude: Syud Salim bin Thoweynee failed in his efforts to obtain funds from Zanzibar ; Toorkee applied repeatedly and Ineffectually for the restoration of the subsidy. The coalition attempted between Ibrahim bin Ghes and Syud Salim in April 1872, when the former was to act in the north and the latter in the south, resulted in nothing through Ibrahim's defeat near Lawa and Salim's failure to raise the country. The departure of Salim for Bombay in December 1872 relieved the Sultan for a time of the presence of an intriguing rival. The assumption by the Govt, of India of the direct control of political relations with the Persian Gulf, Zanzibar, &amp;c., and consequently of the appointments in those regions, was effected in January 1873 on the proposal of the Bombay Govt. 203. Persian Gulf Politics .—The Secretary of State forwarded in February 1872 letters from Commander Doughty of the Magpie and Rear Admiral Cockburn, respecting the state of affairs in the Persian Gulf, and the Turkish expedition to Nejd. Commander Doughty propounded his views of the causes which were then (November 1871) inducing the Turks to turn their attention to the Persian Gulf and the Bed Sea under the mask of quieting feuds in Arabia. Admiral Cockburn urged the advisability of sending another vessel to the Gulf, as the Govt, of India had required three vessels to be continually stationed there. A return of the Turkish vessels in the Persian Gulf showed a strong squadron of seven ships of war, two other 18 gun corvettes being on their way out. The Govt, of India did not answer this despatch. The Secretary noted on the papers thus— ' I do not suppose the Secretary of State expects any expression of the views of the Govt, of India on Commander Doughty's exposition of Gulf politics. Govt, have already written fully and repeatedly to state to the Secretary of State their objections to the presence of a lar^e Turkish force in the Gulf, and I don't see that any further writing will do any good. It might, perhaps, be enough to acknowledge this despatch, refer to our various letters, and tell the Secretary of State that it would be well to send an early answer. « There is a very great deal that is both suggestive and true in Commander Doughty^s letter. It is generally understood that, since we threw the Turks over in the Black Sea affair, they are on far better terms with Russia tban they ever were before. Whatever may be their ultimate object, it is beyond dispute that the Turks have, within the last two years, shown every disposition to extend their authority in Arabia and in the Persian Gulf both by sea and land. Perhaps it is inevitable ,* and possibly the time has gone bye for the maintenance of our exclusive authority in the Gulf. I hope not; but it looks very like it, and it certainly will be the case if the Secretary of State leaves our numerous despatches on Gulf politics much longer unanswered. But however that may be, I think the opening of the Suez Canal has made it ten times more our interest to be on good and intimate terms with Turkey than it ever was before, and the course taken in the Black Sea discussions is much to be regretted so far as the interests of India are concerned. Turkey is a far more valuable ally than Persia, who is and will continue to be, under the thumb of Russia. We can hardly expect to compete successfully with Russia for influence in Persian counsels. When General Goldsmid was in Calcutta he told me that the Shah did not take a single step in the discussions about the Mekran boundary without consulting the Russian Minister. a Now that the overland carrying trade from China has been ruined by the opening of the Piinal 1 look upon it as a matter of certainty that the Russians will sooner or later have a part in the Persian Gulf for their commerce. We shall then be brought face to face with bigger Questions than have arisen during the Nejd campaign and it is of the utmost importance before that event occurs, that our position m the Gulf should be put on a well recognized and sound footing, and all causes of irritation with Turkey and Persia removed. If the discussionswith these powers are ever to be amicably settled, and what is more important, settled in our favor, it must be now. It will never be done if we put off till some other European power has established itself in the Crulf.' [Progs., Secret, July 1872, Noi. 120-12:!.] 204. state of parties in April 1872.— The situation in Oman (see Section i59A) appeared on 23rd March so menacing, owing to Salim's presence at Bideeya with Shiekh Saleh, and the possibility of his advance upon Muscat with the support of the Hinavees, that Major Boss thought Colonel Felly's presence at Muscat desirable, where he was allowed to proceed by the Bombay Govt. * From there the Political Resident gave on 13th April a succinct statement of the position of parties. Salim was intriguing at Bideeyah, Sheikh Saleh scheming and waiting his opportunity at Ibra ; Ibrahim bin Ghes intriguing and raiding near Sohar; Fysul bin Hamood in possession of Rostak, and the Aboothabee Chief besieging Beraymee. Toorkee held Soor and Muscat with a few miles of country round with a force of about 3,000 or 4,000 men, chiefly Ghafirees, but could not take a decided step from want of money. Though hemming him in on every side his enemies had no cohesion or combination, each watching the chance to strike a blow for himself only. Colonel Pelly thought the result might be to disintegrate the Sultanat and break it up into sections, perhaps into numerous Sheikhdoms. Eventually Toorkee marched on 8th April into the Semayel valley to punish the Beni Rooaheh tribe for the murder of Mahomed bin Saeed, a Chief of the Al-boo- Saeed, a murder alleged to have been perpetrated in revenge for Toorkee's proceedings in the imprisonment and death of Khuleelee (see Section 117). Though Toorkee's forces were augmented by the junction of many of the Ghafiree tribes, yet on hearing of the coalition between Salim and Sheikh Saleh (the latter to assist the Beni Rooaheh and the former to march on Muscat) he retired hastily after a meeting with some of the Beni Rooaheh to save appear ances. ith this result the Ghafirees were discontented, but Toorkee's advisers thought their disaffection opened the way for a reconciliation with the Hinavees, while Salim was attempting to gain over the Ghafirees. The Govt, of India had no orders to issue on receipt of this information, which was duly commu nicated to the Secretary of State. [Pro^., Voltl. A., July 1872, Nos. 238-250.] 205. Interference of Turkish Consnl-Grenei al at Bombay with Muscat vessels* —A complaint having been made by the Muscat Govt, in 1871 that the 1 urkish i onsul-General at Bombay was in the habit of interlering wit h vessels coming from the Oman and Muscat coasts to Bombay, it appeared in May 1872, after careful enquiry, that the complaint was unfounded, as t lie requisition of the Turkish Consul-General only extended to all vessels ni:U arrived at Bombay sailing under the Turkish flag. No complaint had been made to the C astoms authorities that the Turkish Consul-General had at any time interfered with vessels sailing under Muscat colours. Accordingly no notice was taken of the complaint. [Progs., Poltl. A., June 1872, No. 60.] . demanded from Ibrahim bin Ghes at Sohar.-Colo- . . euys proceedings at Sohar in demanding redress for the violation of the 1!° 18 j objects by Ibrahim bin Ghes in obedience to the orders of the Lrovi. ot India (see Sections 196 and 199 of jPrfais) were duly reported.

Ibrahim bin Ghes also, who had taken Shinas and was besieging Lawa, suffered a defeat from Toorkee's Commander, Bedr bin Seyf, but himself escaped to feohar. ihe fort of Jjawa was thus relieved, and Shinas and Majees retaken. Colonel Pelly, writing on the 18th of May, doubted whether the check to the Bin Ghes faction would be permanent, as, 1^, Ibrahim represented the party who looked to dividing the Muscat Sultanate into two portions, viz., Muscat and Sohar, and obtaining the Sohar division for the Bin Ghes branch; Znd, Ibrahim represented what might be called the Arabian conservative policy of the inland tribes as distinguished from the advanced and free thought line of the seaboard ports. The inland or Bedowin party seek strictness in morals and religion, and desire a spiritual leader, an Imam, rather than a temporal Sultan, while they regard the policy of the reigning branch as too subordinate to that of foreigners in temporal affairs and as tending towards infidelity in spiritual concerns.

Question of preventing all hostile operations at Sea in Per sian Gulf and Sea c f Oman—On the 27th May 1872 the Bombay Govern ment enquired of the Government of India by telegram ' whether the ordinary policy of preventing all hostile operations at sea is to be maintained in the present civil strife in Oman/' Ibrahim bin Ghes had taken Shinas and had besieged Lawa with a gun sent by sea from Sohar, and had urgently requested that both sides. might be pro hibited from operating by sea, as was the case when Syud Toorkee was oppos ing Azan's Government. The Government of India replied (No. 1284P., dated 8th June 1872) to Bombay :— ' Instruct Pelly not to interfere with operations by sea outside Persian Gulf between the con tending parties in Muscat. Communications from Ibrahim and other recusants cannot be answered. We have recognized Toorkee, and for present at least communications on questions jf this kind should only be with him. Pelly need not address Toorkee regarding our resolu tion not to interfere unless Toorkee appeal to him.' And at the same time our despatch No. 13, dated 3rd April 1871 (Sec. 163 of Precis) was declared to be the guide as to policy in the Gulf of Oman. [Progs., Secret, June 1872, Nos, 156-159.] §09. Views of the Grovernment of India thereon. —The views of the Government of India were fully stated to the Bombay Government thus:— ' The first active interference of the British Government to prevent hostilities in the Gulf of Oman is of very recent date, and it arose out of circumstances described in the correspondence noted in the margin. Government were drawn into it almost insensibly from having taken a more direct and immediate interest in the domestic politics and dynastic changes in Muscat than His Excellency in Council was subse quently disposed to consider expedient.

But the position which was assumed even under these modified instructions was dis- * S nC oTT ^ o 1 ?p r v from 1 ?-n nl)ay ' tasteful to the Ruler of Muscat, Azan bin Ghes, who, in a 35 ' ' ktc&lt;i 3 ' d lebrw, 1870 - letter dated 16th December 1869 * and address^ to Colo- nel Felly, remonstrated against our interference with his proceedings at sea. ' On the accession of Syud Toorkee, His Excellency in Council deemed it advisable, without making any declaration of a marked change of policy, to take the opportunity gra dually to recede from a position which was liable at any moment to involve Government in very serious complications. Accordingly, in my telegram of 2 &lt;)th May 1871, you were informed that ' there need be no restriction on Syud Toorkee' s desire to send men by sea along the coast to take possession, of Sohar/ and in paragraph 4 of my letter. No. 2537P., dated 7th December 1871, it was stated that f His Excellency in Council has no desire to prevent Syud Toorkee from putting to sea with a view to establish his authority in any part of his dominions that may be situated outside the Persian Gulf. 5 ' It will of course be the duty of the Political Agent to take all necessary measures for the protection of the lives and property of British subjects, and also by advice and personal influence, as far as possible, to maintain peace in the Gulf of Oman. But His Excellency in Council does not desire that any attempt should be made by force, or show of it, to interfere with hostile operations which the contending parties in Oman may undertake against each other by sea outside the Persian Gulf. As you are aware, our position in the Persian Gulf stands on a different footing: to which these instructions do not apply.' \Frogs.. Secret, June 1872, Not. 150-161.] . 210, Refusal to aid Syud Toorkee —On 31st May the Bombay Gov ernment reported that Toorkee's factotum, Thoweynee, had applied ^pn 20th April to Colonel Pelly to have one of his ships laden with reinforcements towed up the coast to Sohar or Lawa as the wind was contrary, to which request Colonel Pelly refused to listen, on the ground of want of authority over the Quangtmig or to interfere in the intestine commotions of the Muscat State. The Bombay Government and the Government of India approved of Colonel Pelly's proceedings. [Pro^., JPoltl. A., June 1872, Nos. 207-211.] 211. Mediation between Toorkce and Salim proposed and post poned; appiicataon for Zanzibar subsidy.—On 10th June Colonel Pelly telegraphed:— ' Political Ageift reports that Sultan of Muscat earnestly desires any form of our media tion as between him and Syud Salim in view to relieving Sultan of cost entailed on him by Syud Salim's presence. Mediation would be difficult, but might be tried if Government approve.' Upon which the Government of India called for a report on what basis Colonel Pelly would propose to mediate between Toorkee and Salim. Colonel Pelly replied :— The basis consistent w r ith integrity of Sultanat would be pension to Salim on condition of not molesting Muscat territory, but I doubt Sultan's present finances being capable of pay ing adequate pension; if Sultan receive Zanzibar subsidy, he might perhaps expel Salim as sub mitted. I think mediation difficult, and represented it only on Sultan's urgent application I proceed on leave to Bombay and Simla in few days, and if desired, might then more fully explain details.' The Government of India allowed the matter to stand over till Colonel Pelly came to Simla. {Vrogs., FoltL A., Jmie 1872, Nos. 592-601,. and Progs., December 1872, No. 664.] On 12th June Colonel Pelly telegraphed that Toorkee wrote most earnestly praying for Zanzibar subsidy, as the Arabs were constantly demand ing money, and were discontented at refusal. Toorkee was convinced he would ha\ e to give up the government of Muscat unless he could obtain funds. The Government of India sent this telegram to the Secretary of State with an inti- mat ion that their views had been repeatedly given, and that it was most desir- able i he subsidy question should be settled one way or the other.

Un the 12th June the situation in Oman was unchanged, fealim being still at Bideeyah, and Ibrahim still urging the disaffected to rebel m the south-east: the arrival from Zanzibar of Syud Hamad bin Salim, formerly Wullee of Mesnaah (cousin of Toorkee and'uncle of Salim), was expected to influence local politics. On 18th another application was received by Colonel Felly from Ibrahim that permission might be given to all, or all be prohibited alike from carrying on hostilities at sea. Colonel Pelly, acting on the telegram of 8th June from the Government of India (see section 208), did not reply to Ibrahim. [Frogs., Foltl. A., July 1872, Nos. 386-395.] 214. Toorkee receives $ 5,000 from Zanzibar Sultan.— On 13th June Major Ross reported that Sheikh Syud bin Hamad Mulkhee had brought to Toorkee $ 5,000 from Syud Burgash of Zanzibar, but that Toorkee having expected at least $20,000 was most dissatisfied and annoyed at the smallness of the sum and meant again to address Government on the subject of his claim on Zanzibar. This was communicated to the Secretary of State. [Frogs., Foltl., A., August 1872, Nos. 346-349.] / 215., Syud Salim without a following— On 27th June Major Ross wrote that Syud Salim had no following. The Sheikh of the Beniboo Ali tribe on returning from Mecca invited him to their settlement in Jaalan, in reply to which he asked them to Bideeya where he was residing, but they declined as Bideeya was inhabited by Hinavees. [Desp. to Secy, of State, No. 178, dated %Qth August 1872.] ^ ^ 216. Toorkee's application about Zanzibar. —On ^lie 14th August Colonel Pelly telegraphed again through the Bombay Government that the Muscat territories were tranquil throughout, and the Sultan inquisitive con cerning Charbar and Zanzibar subsidy, apparently desirous, if the subsidy should be withdrawn, that restrictions of arbitrament as to interference with Zanzibar should be also withdrawn. The Secretary upon this wrote the following note:— ' Government have so repeatedly urged the necessity of paying the Zanzibar subsidy, not only on grounds of good faith, but in the interests of Muscat, which depends on that money for the maintenance of a settled government, that nothing further can be urged in any fresh repre sentations to the Secretary of State on the subject. The fact is that the Home Government are in a dilemma. The payment, of the subsidy by Zanzibar has been urged so for^bly by the Gov ernment of India that the arguments can hardly be ignored, or the strong opinion of the Indian Government set aside. On the other hand, the Sultan of Zanzibar (the predecessor of the pre sent Sultan) was informed by the Political Ag-ent, by order of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, that the payment of the subsidy to Muscat would not in future be required of him. The con sequence is that, although the question has been pending for years, the Home Government delay their decision; the delay adds enormously to the difficulty of reviving the payment, and becomes in fact an additional argument for non-payment. The practical result will probably be that the arrangements made by Lord Canning will become a dead-letter. However deplor able this result may be, the Government of India have done their best to prevent it and are helpless to do more. ' But it is not fair to Muscat^that the question should remain in this condition. If the subsidy is not to be renewed, it is only fair and just to tell her so plainly and leave her free to take her own measures. The present telegram gives an opportunity of so doing, if the Secre tary of State be disposed. It may be telegraphed to the Secretary of State, with the remark that a decision on the subsidy question, one way or the other, becomes daily more pressing, and it is hardly fair to Muscat that the decision should be delayed.' 5 BThe Viceroy wrote privately to the Secretary of State. [Progs., Poltl A August 1872, .Yo. 425.] 217. Situation in Oman in July and August 1872.—All July Oman remained apparently tranquil. Toorkee received several visits from Bedouin tribes, who came to obtain donations, but was much embarrassed to find means to satisfy them. Syud Salim was still quite powerless at Bideevah and was said to be keeping up communications with the bin Ghes family. The hurricane at Zanzibar was ascribed as the cause of his mother failing to raise money to aid him to rebel. Colonel Ross was told that Toorkee's Agent at Bombay advised an Envoy on deputation being sent to Bombay about the Zanzibar subsidy, and his opinion was asked. He replied that he did not think the step necessary. Colonel Pelly informed Colonel Ross that the Zanzibar subsidy question was fully before Government; that a deputation would do no good/and would cost a sum which Toorkee could ill afford. On the 15th August Colonel Ross wrote of reports from the south-eastern districts that Sheikh Saleh-el-Harithi was trying to organize a party against Toorkee, who, however, had no apprehensions. The communications were still open. [K.- W. Progs., Poltl. A., September 1872, Nos. 1-6.] Towards the end of August Salim left Bideeya, but was deserted bv his followers and had to return; the Muscat Government exhibited no uneasiness, as Toorkee was able to muster some 400 or 500 fighting men, even some of the Hinavees, the opposite faction, having offered to join him. [Progs., Poltl. A., September 1873, Nos, 1-6 and 148-150, and October, Ms. 331-33'8.] 218. Colonel Ross's Eeport and map of the tribes in Oman —In September 1871 the Bombay Government forwarded a memorandum drawn up by Co one! Ross, the Political Agent, Muscat, on the tribal divisions in Oman, with a table of the tribes, a map showing the general distribution of the tribes, and a genealogical tree ot the descendants of the Imam Ahmed Al-bu-Saidi (the latter is tuller tffan the one given at page 407 of the Rev. G. P. Badger's Imams and Syuds of Oman'), He traced the origin in the beginning of the i centuiy ot the classification of the tribes into the two great divisions of mavees and Ghafirees, and described the modern history of Oman as mainly the narrative ot the contentions between these great rival factions. The maio- 11 ^ J? fi ^ mavees follow the Ibadhi sect, whilst the opposite faction are mostly orthodox.

This happened in this wise. So as * to meet the wishes of Syud Majeed bin Saeed, the Sultan of Zanzi bar, who considered it derogatory to his dignity to pay any subsidy to Syud fealim, the Government of India in December 1867 consented to allow the Bombay Government to receive the'subsidy from time to time and pay the amount to the Muscat State. On the 6th of May 1868 the arrears then due on account of the above subsidy, viz., Rupees 1,68,000, were paid f into the Bombay General Treasury; since that date not a dollar was sent to Bombay either by Syud Saeed, the late, or Syud Burgash, the present, Ruler of Zanzibar. The Bombay Government drew attention to this, and solicited instructions as to the adjustment of the out standing sum of Rupees 22,850, probably that advanced between the 6tli May 1868 and March 1870 when Toorkee left Bombay. (See Sec. 72 of this Precis.) [JProys., Poltl.

Colonel Pelly requested instructions as to whe ther he was at liberty to notify publicly or otherwise intimate to Ibrahim bin Ghes the views of the Government of India set forth in tlieir 'No. 1304P., dated llth June 1872 (Sec. 209). The Government of India referred the Bombay Government to that letter as clearly indicating the course to be adopted by Colonel Pelly towards Syud Toorkee and those who refused to acknowledge his authority in Oman. The Bombay Government not being satisfied that this reference of the Government of India to former orders disposed of Colonel Pelly's question, again applied, and were told on 31st October that there was no necessity to notify publicly the views of Government in the matter, as such a course would be a direct encouragement to rebels to commence hostilities by sea, and Syud Toorkee might witli good reason complain : the line of policy laid down on llth June was to be adopted.

Engagement of March 1862 between England and France to respect independence of Muscat and Zanzibar. —In August 1872 the Secretary of State forwarded to the Government of India a copy of the engage ment entered into on 10th March 1862 between England and Prance, by which both powers engaged reciprocally to respect the independence of the Sultans of Muscat and Zanzibar. This was as follows:— ' Her Majesty the (Wen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and His Majesty the Emperor of the French, taking into consideration the importance of maintaining- the independence of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and of His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar, have thought it right to engage reciprocally to respect the independence of these Sovereigns. ' The undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipoten- tiarv at the Court of France, and the Minister Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of His Majesty the Emperor of the French, being furnished with the necessary powers, hereby declare in consequence that their said Majesties take reciprocally that engagement. , '' 1 * Zanzibar Precis, paragraphs 35-36 ■f Progs., Poltl.

Toorkee himself reported to Colonel Pelly the submission of the Abootha- bee Chief and the renewal of friendship, and that bygones would be bygones. Colonel Pelly replied suitably. The Aboothabee Chief unsuccessfully offered his good offices between Toorkee and Salim, and Colonel Ross wrote that proposals for some settlement between these two was being mooted by the Ilinavee tribes of the south; that Toorkee was willing to make an allowance to his nephew, but the tribes wished the latter to reside in Oman. In conversation Syud Saeed-bin Mahomed Suliman told Colonel lloss that the last letter received by Toorkee from the Sultan of Zanzibar was very unfa vorable with regard to hopes of pecuniary assistance from that quarter, and that without the aid from Zanzibar they would be powerless to act offensively, i.e., to put down a rising. Colonel Pelly went to Muscat and saw Toorkee, who was very frank, and spoke of Ibrahim-bin Ghes as ruling in his own country at and around Sohar (where he had been settled some time). Toorkee regarded the quelling of Ibrahim's rebellion as a question of money; if he received the Zanzibar subsidy or other funds, he would dispose of Ibrahim's pretensions, otherwise matters would remain in statu quo. Toorkee was aware that Salim was at Shargah in communication with Sheikh Saleh '(the most active and intriguing member in the Government of Azan bin Ghes), but could not admit his pretensions, as he demanded $600 per mensem with permission to reside in Muscat territory. He consideved Syud Fysul, ruling at Hostak, a religious candidate for power, to be more likely to succeed than Ibrahim, though lately discomfited at the hands of the Beni Ryan tribe. With regard to Zanzibar, Toorkee desired either that he should be paid the arrears of subsidy and continue to receive it annually, or, that failing this, the British Government should permit him to seize Zanzibar. Colonel Pelly pointed out to Toorkee how illogical it was of him, while admitting his inability to quell a local revolt without cash, to be demanding permission to conquer an Independent State without the subsidy. When it was explained that other means, not force, would be used to conquer Zanzibar, Colonel Pelly reminded Toorkee of Lord Canning's arbitration. As to Abdool Azeez (his brother), Toorkee was not satisfied that he would desist from further endeavours to disturb the peace, but expressed his willing ness still to allow Abdool Azeez $200 per mensem, on condition of residing out of Muscat territories, and desisting from interference. On the 3rd October the Chief of Aboothabee was still at Muscat, but was' expected to leave daily. Toorkee had given him $2,500, which, with the daily expense of keeping him (nearly $150), had compelled resort to various expedi ents to raise ready money, such as buying rice on credit and selling it for cash at a loss. In his letter of 5th October, Colonel Pelly doubted little that Toorkee's Government had from the first been one of sufferance, and one quite unable to withstand the tribes of Oman, though there was no reason to suppose it was weaker than at any previous date since the commencement of his rule. On the 26th October Colonel Ross reported a raid made by Syud Salim on the seaport village of Karriyat, with 14 men of the tribe, El-Hijreen, in which 16 camels of Toorkee's were driven off and the Wullee of Karriyat wounded. Salim decamped before the arrival of Toorkee's Wahabee guard, and medi tated a dash on Soor, but the inhabitants were on the alert, and Salim retired inland and back to Bideeya. 9 - cI :i m. Even Salim's supposed friends disapproved of this petty robbery. Mutual distrust was said chiefly to bar any settlement between Salim and Toorkee, though there was reason to believe that mediation would not be unacceptable.' Coionel Pelly asked for instructions whether good offices should be given in view to mediating between Toorkee and Salim. The camels taken by Salim had not been surrendered by the 9th November. After three months' quiet residence at Sohar, Ibrahim had assumed the role of a zealous religionist, wear ing the white turban of the Mettowa and fasting; as the character was foreign to his real nature, Colonel Ross inferred he had political motives. On 10th November Colonel Ross heard that Ibrahim had taken possession of Khabooreh with its small fort, and subsequently Colonel Ross wrote that Toorkee had been unable to attack Ibrahim for want of funds, but had sent a small reinforcement to Soweyk, on which an attack was apprehended. Ibrahim was said to be too weak to extend his operations; he returned to Sohar leaving a guard to hold Khabooreh, which Toorkee would not be able to reoccupy immediately. Toorkee was unable to send money even for the purpose of an attack on Sohar during Ibrahim's absence. [Progs., Poltl. A., January 1873, Not. 256-288.] 225. Transfer of Political relations with Persian Gulf, Zanzibar, &amp;c M from Grovernment of Bombay to Grovernment of India— On the 30th December 1872 the Bombay Government submitted a proposal to transfer, to the direct control of the Government of India, political relations with the Persian Gulf, Zanzibar, and the tribes beyond the western frgntier of Sind. They wrote:— ' The correspoDdence carried on between the Bombay Government and these territories consists in part of unimportant communications, copies of which are transmitted by post to the Foreign Office, and partly o£ more momentous and complicated questions which can only be considered in connection with the general foreign policy of the Indian Government. In the case of the former no advantage is gained from the additional labour of recording copies, \\hilst in the case of the more emergent and serious business a reference to the Government of India is generally necessary, and with the facilities afforded by improved communication by railway and the telegraph this reference might advantageously in the first instance be made direct. r ^' :ie lion hie the Governor in Council is, therefore, of opinion that it will both be more satisiactory to the Government of India, and also tend to facilitate the conduct of business, if tne Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent at Zanzibar be directed in future to (ommunicate upon all matters direct to the Government of India through the Foreign Depart- meut. But at the same time, in order to guard against any possible contingencies. His Excel- eucy would be inclined to recommend the submission to this Government of occasional sum- manes ot intelligence, and, if necessary, the direct communication to the Political Department or any matters of special importance. W ith reference to Sind, however, a distinction must be drawn, as long as that province lemavns an integial part of the administration of this Presidency, between questions of purely foreign po icy m connection with Beloochistan and the Trans-Indus tribes along the frontier, an ose cases in which the interests of our own subjects are directly and specially involved, e ormer s ou J, m His Excellency's opinion, be treated in the same manner as that proposed .J'' P !T P a i a £ ra phj whilst in the case of the latter the Commissioner should continue final^ 01 lreC t( ' I 118 !

In order, however, that the Government of Bombay may be fully informed of events in connection with the Persian Gulf and Zanzibar, and more particularly with Beloochistan and Khelat, which may have a bearing- more or less direct on the interests of the Bombay Presi- e ' e y&gt; Resident at Bushire, the Political Agent at Zanzibar, and the Commissioner in Sind will be directed for J:he present to send to the Bombay Government, for information, copies of all communications they address to the Government of India, and a copy of any replies that may be sent, or orders that may be issued, will also be furnished to you from this Office. Should His Excellency the Governor at any time desire to submit any remarks or proposals on any of the papers forwarded to him, the Governor-General in Council will be glad to receive them, and it will be optional with the Bombay Government at any time to request the discontinuance of the supply of copies of papers which they may not desire to place on their records. ' The appointments in the Persian Gulf and at Muscat and Zanzibar will in future be made by the Government of India. But with respect to Khelat and Gwadur, which are to continue subordinate to the Commissioner in Sind, it will probably be better that the appointments should continue, for the present at least, to be made by His Excellency the Governor of Bom- bay, subject to reconsideration hereafter, if experince shows a change to be desirable. ^ ith reference to paragraph 6 of your letter, His Excellency the Govern or-General in Council desires me to state that the claims of the members of the Bombay civil and military services in respect to the appointments now transferred to the Government of India will always receive full and fair consideration, and that in his opinion the prospects of the Bombay officers will rather be improved than otherwise by the amalgamation of the appointments in the Persian Gulf and at Zanzibar with the political service directly under the Government of India/' Copies of this correspondence were sent to the Political Agent, Zanzibar, the Commissioner in Sind, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, with orders to regulate their proceedings accordingly. To the Political Resident it was added— &lt;e The Political Agent at Muscat is subordinate to you and under your orders. His official letters and communications should be forwarded to the Government of India through you with your remarks and observations thereon, but in cases of urgency or importance, in which delay would be injurious to the public interests, he is authorized to forward direct to the Government of India a copy of any documents he may address to you. When he avails himself of this power he must invariably inform you at once that he has done so.' The correspondence was forwarded to the Secretary of State, and reference was made to the Government of India's despatch No. 13, dated 1st March 1872, in which the same views had been expressed. It was also shown how the scheme for the classification of the Political sendee would be affected by the change in the control over these appointments. [JProt/s., Secret. January 1873, ivW 226-231.] 226. Arrival of Syud Salim at Bombay— On 4th February 1873, the Bombay Government reported that Syud Salim had arrived in Bombay from Oman, where he proposed to stay for a short time, but the object of his visit had not transpired. Abdool Azeez was said to have left for Zanzibar. m Hareb, bro ther of Salim, remained at Bideeyah. [Frogs., PoltL A., February 1872, Nos. 43-48.] 227. Toorkee's actions during February 1873— Early in February Toorkee went to Burka for 10 days with 200 Wahabee soldiers, leaving one Nazir bin Ali in charge, as he had recently dismissed his Minister Thoweynee bin Mahomed, atid appointed no successor. It was considered not impossible that he might proceed on to Khabooreh or even to Sohar should he succeed in obtaining the co-operation of the tribes on the way. He effected a reconciliation between certain tribes, but made no further attempt. The general opinion was that Toorkee had left Muscat to escape the expen diture of the Bukree Eed in the low state of his Exchequer. 11 illColonel Ross, who had succeeded Colonel Pelly as Acting Political Resi- the deputation of the latter to accompany Sir B. Frere s mission to Zanzibar aifd Muscat, authorized Captain Miles, the Officiating Political Agent, \rn«at to five his advice on the choice of a Minister, if asked, guardedly and fnTeneral terms, and to apprize Toorkee if British mercantile or other interests suffered from tlie want of competent officials. [Frogs., Foltl. A., March 1873, Nos. 190-192. J 228 The saine.~-O n the last day of February Toorkee again went to Burka on bearing that Ibrahim bin Ghes had arrived at Rostak to concert with Feysul. This man, Feysul bin Hamood of Rostak, first cousin of Ibrahim' was understood to be the person whom the majority of the religious fa ction of Oman would choose as their leader in case of their again obtaining the ascendancy. [Frogs., Foltl. A., Afril 18&lt;3, Xos. 129-130.] 229, Alleged landing of slaves at Muscat —In reporting in October 1872 the capture by Her JMajesty s Tl olvcrifiB of a sla\er ott the Somali Coast, Dr. Kirk said he had heard, though he could not vouch for the accuracy of the statement, that slaves were landed a little way from Muscat, conveyed there by land and sold in a public market, duty being taken for the Government. The Bombay Government ordered the Political Agent, Muscat, to make strict enquiry into this statement. Captain Miles reported in February 1873 that he could find no foundation of truth in the statement. There was no public slave-market in Muscat, and no duty was taken for Government. Toorkee was too anxious to meet the wishes of the British Gov ernment in assisting to put down the slave trade. Though slaves were some times landed secretly on the coast. Captain Miles thought the frequent presence of men-of-war rendered it unlikely that they were landed in the vicinity of Muscat. [Frogs., Foltl. A., April 1873, Nos. 95-97.] 230. Proposed departure from Bombay of Syud Salim and Abdool Azeez. —On 16th April a telegram was received from Bushire that both Syud Salim and Abdool Azeez were about to leave Bombay for Oman or Mekran, and suggesting that intimation of their movements and destination should be given and precautions taken to prevent their shipping arms, as their return would be sure to cause difficulty to Toorkee. On enquiry from Bombay it was ascertained that Abdool Azeez had arranged to leave Bombay within three or four days, and that Salim was also preparing to leave. The Commissioner of Police, Bombay, did not state whether any arms or munitions of war had been collected. The Bom bay Government asked the opinion of their Advocate-General with reference to the detention of Salim and Abdool Azeez, and as to the steps to be taken in case they should attempt to export arms, &amp;c.; they referred to the orders of Gov ernment, No. 1216P., dated 30th May 1872, on 'which Abdool Azeez had been told that he would not be detained in Bombay against his will. The Govern ment of India replied that Salim and Abdool Azeez could not be detained against their will; but that the shipment of warlike stores should be prevented if necessary, and that the movement of these persons should be communicated to the llesident at Bushire. Government also wrote :— ' In the absence of any public grounds to justify such a course, Syud Salim and Abdool Azeez cannot be detained in Bombay against their will, nor can their movements be interfered with so long- as they are innocent. On the other hand, all possible precautions should be taken to pre vent them from making British territory, in which they have, found an asylum, a basis tor organizing an expedition against Muscat, or shipping warlike stores to be used against that State.' [Frogs,, Poltl. A., April 1872, Nos, 286-^92.] a i —A^ m ^ n i s tration Report of Muscat for 1672-73. —The Annual Administration Report of Muscat and the territories adjacent to the Persian Guii for 18^2-/3 contained a summary of the chief events of the year, which-iiir have been narrated above. In October 1872, Colonel Pelly having been attaelied to Sir B. 1 rere s bpeeial Mission, Colonel Ross was appointed to act for him at Bushire, and Captain S. B. Miles assumed charge of the office of Political Agent, Muscat. The same report contained brief sketches of the conduct of the several trucial Chiefs, which was on the whole satisfactory as regards their engagements to the British Government, few complaints having been received from the Native Agent. Peace was preserved in the seas, but unfortunate differences occa sioned disturbances by land. The report also alluded to the Turkish expedition in the Wahabee territory of Nejd and to the slave trade. [Progs., Poltl. A., June 1873, Nos. 93-96.] 232, Murder of Nasir bin Ali, Wullee of Muscat. —Nasir bin Ali, the Wullee of Muscat, was murdered in his bed on the night of April 14th. He was a man of mild and amiable character, was not known to have had any personal enemies, and as he had only recently been appointed Wullee, suspicion fell upon three men, intimates of Syud Thoweynee bin Mahomed, the late Wullee, the supposed instigator of the foul deed, a man often described in Oman papers as Toorkee's evil genius and councillor. Thoweynee was nominally put under surveillance by Toorkee, but on the 19th April effected his escape from Muscat in open day, bound for Soweyk, whence he proceeded for Bunder Abbas. One of the men upon whom suspicion fell of being concerned in the murder confessed that Thoweynee had engaged two men (one of them his fellow-prisoner, and the other had absconded from Muscat) for 200 dollars each to commit the murder. On the 10th May Toorkee wrote to Captain Miles that Thoweynee's guilt was proved beyond doubt, and that he was a passenger on the mail steamer to Bombay; the Sultan, therefore, asked that Thoweynee should be given up when the steamer touched at Muscat. Captain Miles, having previously received Toorkee's assurances that if Thoweynee was found not guilty, he should not be further molested, addressed the Commander of the Mail Steamer India, who agreed to surrender a passenger travelling under the name of Abdoolla, if he should prove to be Thoweynee, and if Captain Miles would accept all responsibility. The result was that Abdoolla was identified as Thoweynee and given up to Toorkee's officers. On being taken before Toorkee, Thoweynee, almost paralyzed with fear, besought his pardon with so much earnestness that Toorkee was induced to pardon him and granted him his life. He was then released and conducted to his house, where he remained. Captain Miles was actuated, in surrendering Thoweynee, by a considera tion of the universal and apparently well-founded belief in his guilt, as also the inconvenient precedent that might be established by a contrary course; but he took care to make Toorkee understand that Thoweynee was surrendered on a criminal charge only, and was not to be looked upon or dealt with as a political prisoner; and on receipt of assurances to that effect he was given up. Captain Miles' proceedings were approved by the Government of India. [Frogs., Poltl. A., June 1873, Nos. 161-182.] 233. Slave Trade Treaty with Toorkee —Sir B. Frere was successful during his stay at Muscat in April 1873 in concluding a satisfactory Treaty with Syud Toorkee for the abolition of the slave trade in His Highness' dominions. This will be found at length in the despatches about Sir B. Frere's mission to Muscat and Zanzibar. [Frogs., FoltL A., June 1873, Nos. 161-182.] yi s 23-7-73. 13 (Sd.) C. E. BUCKLAND. Exd.—J. T.

Ibrahim bin Ghais was, as was his custom, intriguing on the Batinah Coast, Syud Salim and Abdool Asieez were at Bombay apparently meditating a movement, but where was not known Syud Thoweynec bin Mahomed, the former Wullee of Muscat, had been surren dered to Toorkee and was charged with the murder of Nasir bin Ali, who had succeeded him as Wullee, while Toorkee himself was hampered in all his move ments by want of funds and was eagerly awaiting the decision as to the pay- ment of the Zanzibar subsidy. 235. General outline of events contained in the present precis. —The twelve months from June 1873 to June 1874 have been marked by the following occurrences. The settlement of the subsidy question, chiefly owing to the instrumentality of Sir Bartle Prere; the attacks by Abdool Azeez and Syud Salim on Gwadur; the rising of Sheikh Saleh bin Ali, his attack on Muttra, and the injury caused thereby to the property of British subjects; the rebellion of Ibrahim bin Ghes, the capture of Mesnaah by him, the further injuries caused to the property of British subjects, and the destruction of the fortifications at Mesnaah by British ships of war. Finally, Toorkee's natural incapacity, aggravated by the severe illnesses to which he has been a victim and by the want of a faithful and responsible adviser to assist him in the duties of Government, has induced him to recall his brother, Abdool Azeez, who with the consent of the Government of India has been allowed to return to Muscat where he at present resides. The details of these various occurrences will be grouped in this narrative under the following heads :— (1.) The results of 'Sir Bartle Frere's visit to Muscat. (2.) The proceedings of Abdool Azeez and Syud Salim. (3.) The rising of Sheikh Saleh bin Ali. (4.) The rebellion of Ibrahim bin Ghes; and (5.) The general condition of affairs at Muscat which resulted in the recall of Abdool Azeez.• THE EESULTS OF SIR BARTLE PRERE'S \ ISI1 TO MUSCAT. The immediate results of Sir Bartle Erere's visit were (1) the inclusion of a Treaty with Stud Toorkee for the suppression of the slave -trade; and (2) the seJement of the subsidy question. ' - ! oQ fi conclusion of a Slave Treaty with Toorkee by Sir Harfit TTrpre and proceeding of the Government of India rtiprpuoon.—Sir Bartle Erere arrived at Muscat on the 12th April 1873, and without difficulty induced Toorkee to sign the following Treaty : Preamble. 'Her Maiesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and lieiand and His Hio-hness the Syad Toorkee bin Saeed, Sultan of Muscat, being desirous to give more complete effect to the engagements entered into by the Sultan and his predecessors for the perpetua abolition of the slave-trade, they have agreed to conclude a Treaty for this purpose, which shall be binding upon themselves, their heirs and successors ; and Her Majesty the Queen, &amp;e., having appointed as Her Plenipotentiary Sir H. B. Jrere K.C.B and G.C .S.!., he having communicated to the Sultan of Muscat his full powers found in good and due form, and the aforesaid Sultan of Muscat, Syud Toorkee bin Saeed, acting on his own behalf, they have agreed upon and concluded the following Articles: A rticle I. ' The import of slaves from the coasts or islands of Africa or elsewhere into the dominions of Muscat, whether destined for transport from one part of the Sultan of Muscat's dominions to another, or for conveyance to foreign parts, shall entirely cease, and any vessels engaged in the transport or conveyance of slaves after this date shall be liable to seizure and condcmna- tion by all such naval and other officers or agents and such Courts as may be authorized tor that purpose on the part of Her Britannic Majesty. And all persons hereafter entering the Sultan's dominions and dependencies shall be free. Article II. a The Sultan engages that all public markets in his dominions for slaves shall be entirely closed. A rticle III. a The Sultan engages to protect, to the utmost of his power, all liberated slaves, and to punish severely any attempt to molest them or to reduce them again to slavery. A rticle IV. ' Her Britannic Majesty engages that Natives of Indian States under British protection shall, from and after a date to be hereafter fixed, be prohibited from possessing slaves, and in the meanwhile from acquiring any fresh slaves. A rticle V. 'The present Treaty shall be ratified by Her Majesty, and the ratification shall be for warded to Muscat as soon as possible. In witness w r hereof Sir H. B. E. Frere, on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, &amp;c., and Syud Foorkee bin Saeed, Sultan of Muscat, on his own behalf, have signed the same and have affixed thereto their respective seals. ' Done at Muscat this 14th day of April 1873. [Poltl. A., June 1873, Nos. 476, 477, 483.] L -f Secretary of state ' No - 62 ' dated i6th Sir Bartle TVere, in reporting these pro- . ceedings to the Secretary of State for r oreign Affairs, wrote regarding his treaty:— ' ' will perceive that by this Treaty Syud Toorkee engages for himself, his heirs ant ^ ,-i. c (x:Sb o rs, to prohibit absolutely the import or export of slaves within his territories, to a o is a public slave markets, and finally confers for the future freedom on all slaves as soon 16 SECTION I.as they set foot in his territory. This last stipulation I consider peculiarly valuable, as it will discourage slave-traders from bringing their human wares to a country where the latter at once cease to be available property. Syud Toorkee however distinctly informed Sir Bartle Frere that he anticipated great difficulty in carrying out the provision.^ Toorkee at the same time addressed a letter to His Excellency the Viceroy stating that he had signed the Treaty without demur. In reply a letter was addressed by His Excellency to Toorkee on the 9th June 1873, conveying the congratulations of the Government of India on the adoption of such an enlightened policy. In reply to the Viceroy's letter* of the 9th June the Political Resident on s ^ vi* I. * at the 3rd July forwarded a letter from Toorkee * Political A., August 1873, No. 275. j. - • li i t n _ containing the usual compliments, &amp;c. In this letter the following passage occurs regarding the suppression of the slave- trade ;— ' With reference to the communication which Sir Bartle Frere has made to Your Excel lency that I am ready to co-operate with him in carrying out the proposals of Government, I beg to say that I will continue to act agreeably to those proposals and will never swerve from them;' 237. Agreement obtained from Toorkee conceding to the Political Agent at Muscat jurisdiction over subjects of Native States guilty of breach of Slave Trade Laws— With a view to the effectual suppression of the slave-trade, the Government of India considered it desirable:— ' that all subjects of the British Government and of Native States in India, who within the Muscat territories may commit offences against the Slave-trade Law should be amenable to the jurisdiction of the Political Agent at Muscat. With this obiect the Political Resident t No. 1229P., dated 9th June 1873. ^ ^ 'Jurisdiction over British subjects is already provided for by the Treaty of 1889 and Her Majesty's Order in Council dated 4th November 1867. But as regards the subjects of Native States, who, like the Kutchees, appear to be greatly implicated, indirectly at least, in the slave-trade, the Political Agent's jurisdiction would appear to be defective without the express consent of His Highness the Sultan, ' His Excellency in Council accordingly thinks it desirable that you should obtain from His Highness a formal agreement to the effect that subjects of Native States of India who may commit offences within the MLuscat dominions shall be amenable to ■ -le 1 olitical Agent » Court in the same way as British subjects, if the Political Agent in any particular case hinks fit to exercise such jurisdiction/' [Poltl.

Major Miles reported that during the stay at Muscat of the Turkish vessel Nedjed on her way from Busreh to Oonstanti- rinnle four African slaves were taken off and sold to one of the Turkish officers on board. This occurred during Toorkee's absence at Sohar. Major Miles WJ?ot'0 *'' '• 'On hearino- and ascertaining the truth of this occurrence I applied to Syud Mahomed bin Azan &gt;- ho is in^cbarge at Muscat during His Highness' absence, to have the principal Agent in'the sale of the slaves, a Belooch, named Sulliman, put into confinement and the affair investigated. This was done, and it appeared that four or five others besides bulhman were implicated in the transaction. ■ ||p J® « Although Mahomed bin Azan was willing to do anything I wished towards the punish ment of the offenders on shore, he was averse to requiring the slaves to be given up by the Turks as it was highly probable the Turks might refuse to accede to his request, and 1 con curred'with him in thinking that the demand would not be politic. « The Captain of the Nedjed was an Englishman, but he appeared to have little authority • over the officers who were all Turks, and he could have rendered no assistance. The purchaser of the slaves was the Chief Officer of the ship, and I was informed they were intended for a Turkish Naval Officer of rank at Constantinople. ' Finding, however, that the affair had become known, and that Sulliman had been imprisoned, the Turkish officer apparently considered it prudent to arrange with the other parties to the sale to reland the slaves and receive back the purchase money. The slaves were accordingly put on shore secretly the next night, and the money, which I understand amounted to 60 Turkish Lira, or about Rupees 550, was returned. a As the sale had thus been cancelled the local Government was desirous to release Sulliman from confinement, promising at the same time to keep a watch on all of those concerned and prevent a recurrence of such cases. To this I consented. Sulliman being only one of a number, it would have been necessary for justice, had he been detained in prison, to have had the others punished also. ' In Syud Toorkee's absence, however, I deemed it unwise to force such an unpopular measure on His Highness' representative, and I thought sufficient notice had been taken of the matter/' In reporting this to the Government of India, Colonel Ross asked to be furnished with copies of any Treaties or Conventions with Turkey relative to slave traffic other than the ' Imperial Pirman addressed to the YV ullee ot Baghdad,' dated January 1847, and the supplementary instructions to Negib Pasha of Baghdad about slaves (without date). In reply copies of a Resolution of the Porte dated 29th January 1857 and of the instructioDS issued by the local Government under that Resolution were forwarded to the Political Resident, and Major Miles' proceedings were approved by the Government of India. The papers were also on the 29th October 1873 reported to the Secretary of State, and it was added:— 'We would suggest that the attention of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be directed to the Political Agent's letter for such action as may be considered advisable, and we would solicit definite instructions for the guidance of our Political Officers when dealing with cases of the sale of slaves at Muscat to Persian or Turkish ships. 'If any Treaties or engagements have been entered into with Turkey since 1857 for the suppression of the slave-trade, or if any declarations or resolutions on the subject have been published by the Ottoman Porte, we would beg to be furnished with copies of them.' On the 9th January 1874 the Secretary of State replied,f forwarding copy of t Political A..

Sir Bartle Prere's proceedings and views regarding the subsidy.—On the 1st February 1873 Sir Bartle Erere, then at Zanzibar, addressed the following letter to His Highness Syud Burgash;— ' In the year 1861 it was agreed between His late Highness Syud Majid and His late Highness Syud Thoweynee to refer certain matters in dispute between them to * the arbitration of the late Lord Canning, the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, and after full enquiry and report by General Sir William Coghlan it was decided— ' \st. —That -His Highness Syud Majid be declared Ruler of Zanzibar and the African dominions of His late Highness Syud Saeed. ' Znd.—That the Ruler of Zanzibar pay annually to the Ruler of Muscat a subsidy of 40,000 Crowns. ' Zrd.—That His Highness Syud Majid pay to His Highness Syud Thoweynee the arrears of the subsidy for two years or 80,000 Crowns. ' It was further decided that this arrangement was not to be f considered as merely per sonal between the two brothers, but was to extend to their respective successors, and is to be held to be a final and permanent arrangement compensating the Ruler of Muscat for the abandonment of all claims upon Zanzibar, and adjusting 'the inequality between the two inheritances of the two brothers, which are to be henceforward distinct and separate/ ' This award was formally accepted by both brothers, and is, according to its express terms, equally binding on their successors. ' But His Highness Syud Toorkee, who has now succeeded to the possession of Muscat, complains that'the subsidy of 40,000 Crowns has not been regularly paid since the death of the late Syud Thoweynee; I have been employed by Her Majesty^s Government to enquire into and make arrangements regarding the payment of this subsidy, and I am directed to go to Muscat for this and for other purposes. ' I request, therefore, that Your Highness will inform me what sums have been paid from the Zanzibar Treasury on account of the Muscat subsidy since the death of Syud Thoweynee, and if any arrears remain unpaid, what arrangement Your Highness is prepared to make for their liquidation, and for the more punctual payment of the subsidy in future ' [Poltl. A., June 1873, Nos. 476-489.] With reference to this letter the Political Resident at Zanzibar reported to Sir Bartle Frere that the Sultan of Zanzibar was disposed to treat the matter with the greatest levity, and that finding this to be the case, he had on the 15th February 1873 addressed the following letter to Syud Burgash:— ' When the Envoy of Her Majesty, Sir B. Frere, had the honor of his last interview with Your Highness he mentioned the subject of the Muscat subsidy, and Your Highness used words which implied that you would pay nothing to Muscat. The Envoy was unwilling to believe that Your Highness meant that you would not pay the subsidy and wrote a letter on the 1st of February asking Your Highness what arrangements would be made for paying what is due to Muscat on account of the subsidy ? To this no answer has yet been received. I therefore request Your Highness to send an answer for the information of the Envoy and of Her Majesty^s Government.^ To this letter Syud Burgash vouchsafed no reply, and the Political Besident stated that he had ascertained that the Sultan had on more than one occasion, since its receipt, spoken of the Muscat subsidy, stating ' that it will never be paid by him, and that if his brother Toorkee should ^ come to Zanzibar by permission of the English, he would find him first to meet him outright. Dr. Kirk added :— 'As His Highness is thoroughly aware that he is unable with Zanzibar natives, and without ships to face any body of Oman Arabs, this confidence only shows his^ trust that Toorkee will be unable to leave Muscat owing to rivals in Oman, and T am told that by asi mail letters were received encouraging the belief that soon Toorkee would Lc attacked and driven even from the town of Muscat. Whether His Highness is now more actively engaged in intrigue against his brother Toorkee I have not been able to ascertain, but there seems reason to think that his (m'tawa fanatic) advisers are so occupied, the present Ruler ot Muscat being to them, since the murder of El Khalili, an object of the greatest religious hatred. . I the same time, since departure of the English Admiral and fleet on receipt o lb ^ kcss final refusal to abandon the slave-trade by sea between Quiloa and Lamoo, he has become convinced that England will not interfere actively in obtaining payment of the subsidy for Muscat.'Sir Bartle Trere therefore on the 15th* April (then at Muscat) informed the Political Agent at Muscat that he * Political a., june 1873, No. 481. i iac [ told Toorkee that he was at liberty to draw on the Muscat Treasury for a sum equivalent to one year's subsidy due from Zanzibar, viz., 40,000 dollars. Sir Bartle Prere also authorized the Political Agent, in the event of his receiving no contrary order within three months to advance to Toorkee after that period a further sum of half a year's subsidy reporting his proceedings to the Indian Government. .Afterwards Sir Bartle Erere on the 2nd May, writing from Mahableshwar, forwarded the following memorandum to the Indian Government regarding the Muscat subsidy:— ; - 1 ■. |&amp; j ' It is unnecessary to recapitulate the history of the acquisition of Zanzibar and its African dependencies by the late Syud Saeed, of Muscat; of the division of his dominions after his death Syud Maiid taking Zanzibar and his brother, Syud Thoweynee, Muscat; of their quarrels, and their reference of the causes of dispute to Lord Canning; of Lord Canning^ award and its acceptance by both brothers. All particulars on the subject will be louiid m Sir William CoffhWs Reports to Sir George Clerk's Government of Bombay, printed as Appendices Nos. 7 and 8 to the Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons of 1871. a The further history of the case is thus summarized by Colonel Pelly, Resident in the Persian Gulf— c ' Under the terms of Lord Canning's arbitrament, the Ruler of Zanzibar was bound to pav annually to the Ruler of Muscat a subsidy of 40,000 Crowns. This sum to be paid annually in two instalments, viz., the first at the Mosim, and the second at the Daiman. ' 'This subsidy was paid accordingly down to the date of the death of His late Highness Syud Thoweynee bin Saeed of Muscat in beginning of 1866. (C c His Highness Syud Salem bin Thoweynee succeeded his father aforesaid, but Syud Majid, the Ruler of Zanzibar, objected to paying the subsidy to His Highness Syud Salem on the ground of his alleged parricide. But in September 1866 Her Majesty's Indian Government recognized His Highness Syud Salem as Sultan of Muscat, and required His Highness of Zanzibar to continue payment of the subsidy; in view further to avoiding misunderstanding or dispute as between the two Rulers, a subsidiary arrangement was made, under which the subsidy was to be paid through the medium of the British Political Agent at Muscat. cc &lt; In September—October 1868, Syud Azan bin Ghes, a scion of another branch of the reigning family, rebelled against His Highness Syud Salem and expelled him his dominions. At the date of this expulsion a balance of subsidy, as per margin, was owing to &amp; 0,00a His Highness Syud Salem. '' Syud Azan bin Ghes having expelled His Highness Syud Salem usurped the Sultanat, and was acknowledged by the tribes of Oman as Imam. ' 1 The Ruler of Zanzibar again declined payment of the subsidy on the ground of the usurpation by a member of another branch of the family. '' The British Government did not recognize Syud Azan bin Ghes. Discussions ensued between the Home and Indian Governments concerning the subsidy, and it was, 1 believe, at one time suggested that we should permit the payment to cease, on condition of the huler of Zanzibar granting us some concessions in respect of the East African slave-trade. Meantime no subsidy was paid to the ile facto Ruler of Muscat, Syud Azan bin Ghes. ''In January—February 1871, His Highness Syud Toorkee bin Saeed invaded the Muscat territories; Syud Azan bin Ghes was killed in battle, and His Highness Syud Toorkee assuming power was subsequently recognized by us as Sultan of Muscat. '' His Highness Syud Toorkee being a member of the same branch of the reigning family with His Highness the Ruler of Zanzibar, the plea upon which the latter had refused payment of the subsidy to Syud Azan bin Ghes ceased to have force, and His Highness Syud Toorkee appealed, and stiil continues to appeal, to Her Majesty's Indian Government to insist on a faithful observation of the terms of the arbitrament. ' f On His Excellency the Special Envoy addressing the Ruler of Zanzibar concerning the fulfilment of his subsidy obligations. His Hichness replied verbally by an absolute and haughty refusal, and down to date has failed to acknowledge even the receipt of H is Excellency s written communications.' The total amount due from Zanzibar to Muscat, as estimated by the Resident, is shown in the annexed memorandum at $120,000. u But on reference to His Highness Syud Toorkee, it was ascertained that he claimed only $90,000, as shown in the enclosed memorandum drawn up by His Highness desire by the Assistant Resident in charge of the accounts for submission to the Special Envoy. 20' The third enclosure is a letter which the Special Envoy addressed to the Sultan Burgash of Zanzibar on the 1st of February last, with a view to ascertain what, if anything-, had been paid of the arrears due to Muscat, and what arrangements the Sultan of Zanzibar was prepared to make for payment of arrears, and more punctual payment in future. 'To this letter no answer or acknowledgment of any kind was sent up to the 17th of March, when the Mission finally left Zanzibar, though His Highness was repeatedly pressed by the Consul to send an answer. 'Verbally Syud Burgash distinctly stated to the Envoy at his last audience, in reply to the Envoy's enquiries as to what His Highness proposed to do in the matter of the subsidy,—' we will not pay Muscat a cent/ ' No other inference therefore can be drawn from His Highness' omission to acknowledge the Envoy's letter than that he repudiates all liability on account of the subsidy, and declines to account to the British Government for this repudiation of the obligations imposed on Zanzibar by the terms of Lord Canning's arbitration. ' This inference is in complete accordance with the whole tenor of the correspondence with Zanzibar, which I find in the records of the Bombay Government since 1868. ' In the absence of any statement of any reason why Zanzibar should not pay, nothing more can be said than that a careful examination of the correspondence relating to the award fails to disclose any shadow of argument on which any claim to escape from liability could be founded as against the present occupant of the throne of Muscat. 'The obligation to pay was the basis of the agreement to divide the dominions of Syud Saeed. But for that obligation, which is distinctly stated to be binding on successors, and not to be personal, there could have been no Sultanat of Zanzibar to which Syud Burgash could have succeeded. It was, therefore, by virtue of that engagement that Syud Burgash is now Sultan of Zanzibar, and his repudiation of liability is an ample justification of its enforce ment by appeal to arms. ' Such an appeal Syud Toorkee is most anxious to try, and if permitted to make the attempt, I have little doubt he would be ultimately successful. 'This, however, would be an entire reversal of our policy for many years past; it would stultify our arbitrament undertaken by us, specially with a view to prevent hostilities between the two States; it would be destructive of the peace of those seas, and for a time at all events would affect most injuriously the growing commerce and incipient civilization of Eastern Africa. ' It was under this conviction that T told Syud Toorkee that I felt sure no such appeal could now be permitted by Her Majesty's Government. ' But any such exercise of our power or influence to prevent Syud Foorkee obtaining hib ■just rights for himself appears to me, as it did to His Highness, to involve an obligation on our part to see that the terms of the arbitration award are duly observed by the other party, i .e., by Zanzibar. ' This seems to be the view consistently taken by the Government of India, and concurred in by Her Majesty's Government, as I judge from what is said on the subject in my instruc tions from Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. ^ ' I had, therefore, no hesitation in informing His Highness in reply to his remarks on the subject, that I would represent the case to His Excellency the Viceroy, who I had no doubt would do what was just and right in the matter. 'It would have been within the letter of my instructions to have given His Highness at once a distinct assurance that the subsidy would be regularly paid to nn v m ^ ^ tt f treasury at Bombay, but I thought the assurance would come with more effect from His Excellency the Viceroy, and I wished to comply with the obvious wish of His Highness that the two questions of slave-trade and subsidy should be kept clear &gt; dio mc an separa e. ' Meantime His Highness' treasury is utterly exhausted b) long civil strife^ and h's want of ready money for all purposes of peaceful internal admmistiation. ^ and I have command any amount of men and raise sufficient money for a raid on Zanzibar and l h^ little doubt would easily there carry all before him; but ^ u f nded , aS n h ^ kelw order of civil discord in Oman, he has great difficulty in consolidating his power and keeping or at h0 ™The regular payment of the Zanzibar subsidy is in fact of vital importance to the orderly government and well-being of Mn S eat Muscat for |40,000 (£8,500), being 2i F/ . one year's arrears of subsidy, and at the expiration of three months for a further sum of $20,000, being half the subsidy due for the current year, unless other measures for settling the question should be taken in the interim. | 'I find that a similar course was authorized by the Government of India when Syud Majid of Zanzibar refused to pay the subsidy to his parricide nephew Syud Salem, and I trust, there fore that my proceedings in this respect will meet the approval of the Government of India. I felt bound to act at once, without previously submitting the case for the consideration of His Excellency the Viceroy, or Her Majesty's Government, because Syud Toorkee's position is really very critical, and £8,500 may do more for him now than ten times that sum after another series of revolutions and civil wars in Oman, every month of which must inflict heavy losses on our traders and their commerce. ' His Highness had, moreover, just shown in the most practical manner his anxiety to meet the wishes of Her Majesty's Government as regards the suppression of the slave-trade, and I cannot see any chance of a ruler more friendly to British interests, or more likely to rule wisely and well than the brave and prudent prince who has shown himself equally capable in adversity, and moderate when victorious, and who has the best legitimate claim to the throne on which he has just been seated by his own courage and conduct, and by the choice of the majority of the tribes and people. With such a port and a position so capable of fortification as Muscat, so close to India, it could never be a matter of indifference to us who rules there, even if all the commerce of the country were not so exclusively Indian as it is. ' Without referring to the views which other European nations have from time to time of late years held regarding Muscat as a step towards India, it is specially noteworthy just now that both Persia and Turkey have lately shown more interest in its affairs than they used to do in the days not long since when the late Syud Saeed successfully defied both those powers in the Persian Gulf. Persians tell us that Persia in her palmy days ruled at Muscat, and Turks refer to legends that the Ottoman Khalifahs' fiat only some few centuries ago was all powerful in Oman. Dreams founded on such reminiscences may be innocuous if they could be confined to Constantinople or Teheran, but the interests of India forbid our permitting them to end in Turkish iron-clads in Muscat Cove, or in a ruler who looks to the Persian Capital and its Legations for orders or inspiration. ' ' Nor would India be quieter if a Wahabee Lieutenant ruled in Oman, which would be a natural alternative, if Arab fanaticism were roused to resist Turkish or Persian aggressions after it had crushed the rival sect of Ibadhiya which now is dominant at Muscat. ' I would submit for the consideration of His Excellency the Viceroy that the Government of India should assure His Highness by an autograph letter from His Excellency the Viceroy that the Zanzibar subsidy will be regularly paid with all arrears from the Bombay treasury to His Highness' Agent in Bombay, as long as His Highness abstains from all agressions on Zanzibar, and observes the obligations he and his predecessors have entered into regarding the suppression of the slave-trade. ' I have nothing to add to what I find has been suggested by Colonel Pelly on previous occasions, and approved by the Government of India, regarding the mode of paying the subsidy from our treasury. ' The subsidy thus paid should, I think, be punctually and peremptorily recovered from Zanzibar. This is the course which I was directed in my instructions 'emphatically' to impress upon the Sultan of Zanzibar would be followed in the event of his signing the treaty to stop the slave-trade, which I was directed to propose to him, and of his subsequently being guilty of ' the slightest infraction' of its provisions. 'It appears to me, therefore, to be a fortiori a suitable course to be adopted in the event which has occurred of his refusal to observe his engagements with Muscat entered in through . the British Government. If immediate and satisfactory arrangements are not made for the liquidation of the subsidy, an embargo should be laid on the Sultan's custom-houses. ' Nothing further would be necessary for this purpose than to continue the embargo which I have recommended should be imposed for the purpose of stopping slave-trade, till the Sultan of Zanzibar gives substantial satisfaction in the matter of the subsidy due to Muscat. It would also, I think, be well that the Consul at Zanzibar should impress on His Highness the Sultan that, whilst the Sultan of Muscat will not be permitted to disturb the peace of Zanzibar by naval expeditions, the British Government will not regard with indiffer ence any attempt from Zanzibar to stir up strife in Oman. 'I note this, because I find in the correspondence with the Bombay Government repeated reference to intrigues by Syud Salem to obtain from Zanzibar, through his mother, the means to? organizing an invasion of Oman. Similar attempts seem to have been made on behalf of another brother, Syud Abdool Azeez; and Syud Majid, the late Sultan of Zanzibar, is reported to have furnished large supplies of ordnance and ammunition to some of the independent Chiefs o &gt; e Arabian Littoral ostensibly as friendly presents, but in effect as aids to them in hostili ties with the then reigning Sultan of Muscat! 2223 «, o u he VoMo^tand Consul appears at fte time voy properly to have pointed out to _ Sultan or Zanzibai that this practice was inconsistent with the principles recognized in the amicable separation of the African from the Arabian kingdom, and the late Sultan seems to have so far recognized the propriety of the remonstrance, that for the time the practice of sending presents of ordnance and ammunition to the Northern Arab Chiefs was abandoned But there appear to be symptoms of a desire on the part of His Highness the present Sultan of Zanzibar to resume this mode of annoying Muscat, and they should be promptly noticed and checked. r i j His Highness Syud Toorkee is v\ illing. if he receives the Zanzbar subsidy regularly to ^ assign suitable pensions to his brother, Syud Abdool Azeez, and his nephew, Syud Salem both now resident in Bombay. ' I agree with Colonel Pelly in thinking that these pensions may very properly be settled in communication with the Resident in the Persian Gulf, and paid through the British treasury, by deducting the amount from the Zanzibar subsidy before it is paid over to Muscat, with a -f clearly expressed intimation that we cannot allow the Syuds to make the British territory which affords them a secure refuge in exile, a basis for intriguing against the peace either of Muscat or of Zanzibar. ' (Sd.) H. B. E, F eere, ' Special Envoy to Zanzibar and Muscat.' ' Addendum to memorandum showing amount of arrears of subsidy due by Zanzibar to Muscat, ' His Highness Syud Salem's expulsion from the Sultanat occurred in October 1868, and at that time two instalments of the Zanzibar subsidy were still owing to His Highness, viz., the instalment of Mosim (April) 1868 ... 20,000 Crowns, and that of Daiman (September) 1868 ... ... ... 20,000 „ instant 40,000 ' His Highness Syud Salem was succeeded by His Highness Syud Azan, who Vide Memorandum. remained in power from October 1868 to February 1871, and for this period it is not proposed to compel the present Sultan of Zanzibar to make good the arrears of subsidy. ' His Highness Syud Toorkee assumed power in January—February 1871, and if the plan of dealing with his demands in the subsidy be accepted.

The Government of India sanction payment of the subsidy to Toorkee with arrears from the date of his acces sion. —On the 9th of June the Government of India addressed the Political i Resident in the Persian Gulf requesting that Syud i oorkee might be^ informed \ that it afforded His Excellency the V iceroy and Governor-General in Council | Note .—If it is deemed preferable to demand in arrears down to September 1872, instead of to the 30th of the current month, the total of arrears due would be exactly 1,05,000 Crowns.much satisfaction to guarantee to His Higlmess the payment of the Zanzibar subsidv of 40 000 Crowns per annum with arrears from the date ol his accession to the throne of Muscat in February 1871, and to convey to Toorkee an assurance that « so long as he continues faithful to fulfil his treaty engagements and manifest his friendship towards the British Government the subsidy of 40 000 Crowns will he paid to him annually during his rule. the linancial Department were at the same time asked to make the necessary arrangements for payment. [p^W, A., June 1873, No. 486.] In reporting to the Secretary of State on the same date the guarantee thus given to Toorkee it was said :— « We must leave it to Her Majesty's Government to determine the steps to be taken for the recovery o£ the subsidy from Zanzibar, as these measures are intimately connected with the arrangements to be adopted for the suppression of the slave-trade consequent on the refusal of the Sultan of Zanzibar to conclude a new Treaty. Meanwhile, from the enclosures of the despatch from the Assistant Secretary in the Political and Secret Department, No. 138, dated 20th December 1872, we understand that if any portion of the sums now or hereafter advanced to Syud Toorkee on account of the subsidy be not eventually recovered from Zanzibar, the half of such unrecovered advances will be repaid to us by Her Majesty's Imperial Govern ment/' [Poltl. A., June 1873, No. 488.j On receipt of this despatcli the Secretary of State on the 9th July telegraped the following enquiry;— « Do you mean that you have undertaken on behalf of India to pay Toorkee whole Zan zibar subsidy ?' [Poltl A., July 1873, No. 235.] To which the Government of India replied:— 'We have undertaken to pay Toorkee whole Zanzibar subsidy during his rule, subject to good behaviour, with arrears from date of accession. We hope Her Majesty's Government will recover whole from Zanzibar and make her pay in future. Whatever is not recovered, or what ever future remission may be granted to Zanzibar, we expect will be shared between Indian and English Government, according to enclosures in your No. 138 of 20th December 1872.'

For the past six months, however, the case has- been different, and he has now, I believe, very little, if anything, left of the We amount he has received. There is no doubt that the great bulk of the money has gone to subsidize and pacify the isedouins, Arab tribes, and various parties who sway the currents of political events in Oman, and who have not been slow to put forth their claims to share in His Highness' newly- acquired means; it is certain also that he has greatly gained their favor by his open-handedness and apparent generosity; but on the other hand, they have now more than ever become aware oi their po^er and learnt to expect such heavy douceurs and subsidies that when they find the easy flow checked, as they assuredly soon will, they may perchance turn round and avenge themselves in unreasoning hostility. His Highness, however, is well aware of the position, and has more than once lamented to me how these subsidies were impoverishing him and his inability to curtail them, but with every wish and intention to make the best and most pro- ^itable use of his money, he has apparently found himself obliged to go with the stream. ' Syud Toorkee is, as regards himself, a very unselfish man, and has added little or nothing to his own establishment and comfort, nor is any increase of State perceptible. I have pleasure in stating, however, that he has repaired and extended the old Portuguese wharf and landing pier in front of the Custom House at an expenditure of about $ (6,000) six thousand. This is a great improvement and a boon to the merchants, as there were previously no facilities for landing goods here/' 244. Advance of six months' subsidy to Toorkee in February 1874. Further advance sanctioned in July 1874.— On the 17th Eebruary 1874 Colonel Ross telegraphed that Toorkee urgently solicited six months' subsidy in advance. This occurred just as Toorkee was recovering from one of Saleh bin Ali's periodical attacks. The advance was sanctioned by the Government of India, and the Financial Department were asked to make very early arrangements for forwarding the amount. On 25th July Colonel Uoss solicited sanction by telegraph to allow Syud Toorkee to draw on next six months' subsidy in advance if found necessary. This was sanctioned. [Poltl.

He recounted the alliance of his grandfather, Syud Saeed, with the British Government, and the aid his father, Thoweynee, tried to give against ' the Wahabee presump tion,' and stated that when his father died in 1866 he assumed the administra tion'of the country at the request of the people, and conducted it till the usurpation in October 1868 by Azan bin Ghias, who plundered the palace of some 20 lakhs of property. Since that time he confessed he had beeni a desti tute wanderer with his family, whom he sent to Zanzibar for aid, but unsuc cessfully. The application was said to have been made ' at the friendly desire of Colonel Pelly,' and Syud Salim asked for its consideration when the Resident and Sir B. Prere were at Simla. (Foil. A., June 1873, Nos. 478-486.; 247. Previous history of Salim bin Syud Thoweynee.— On the death of Sultan Syud Saeed on the 19th October 1856, after a reign of 52 years, his eldest surviving son, Thoweynee, succeeded to the Muscat throne. Thoweynee's reign was disturbed by the attempts of his younger brother, Toorkee, to form a coalition against him, and by the aggressions of the Wahabees and Azan bin Ghias, the Wullee at Bostak (a scion of the royal house of Muscat, though a distant cousin of the ruling branch.) On the 11th Eebruary 1866 Thoweynee was assassinated while asleep at the fort of Sohar by his son, Salim, who proceeded to Muscat, gave out that his father had died after three days' illness, and solicited the renewal of . „ A D ,. . 00 relations with the British Government. t Muscat Precis, paragraph 28. 0,1. , , p, 1 i Salim was recognized t after he had been Sultan only a few months, although Gov ernment knew X of the horrible suspicion under which he lay, and withdrew in consequence from a position of personal friendship with the ruler to one of mere diplomatic courtesy towards the State. A weak, cowardly, unpopular man personally, his government never acquired strength; and it was only by the intervention of the British Govern ment that he was relieved from the attacks of his uncle, Toorkee, who retired to Bombay in September 1867 on the agreement that he should receive from Salim $ 600 per mensem and reside in future within the territories of the British Government. In October 1868 Muscat was attacked by Azan bin Ghias and Salim lorced to fly to Bunder Abbass, his valuables, with many heir-looms of the dynasty being plundered or destroyed. From the time of his deposition 26 J To Bombay, No. 346, dated 11th April 1866.27 mmm by Azan bin Ghias Salim took measures to recover Ms position; he endea voured to rally men round him on the Arab coast, and tampered with the * Muscat Precis, paragraph 29. truciai Chiefs toi that ooject, but to no effect; he entered * also into communica tions with the Wahabee Ameer ; he collected a force at El-Kishen and Bunder Abbass, and actually made several attempts to regain his lost dominions, but the Government of India warned him against any act that might tend to a breach of the maritime peace, an interdict which greatly crippled his enterprize. t Prfds, paragraph 77. J* ou r despatch t No. 31, dated 27th May 1870, to the Secretary of State, paragraph 4, he was described as a wanderer from place to place along the littoral without a party, and without the means of raising one.

Against Toorkee then Salim's intrigues were directed, and resulted in several ineffectual descents on towns subject to the Sultan. Eor a short time Salim appears to have been comparatively quiet at Kishm till early in 1872, supported by the Henavees : he coalesced with Ibrahim bin Ghias (brother of Azan) and Sheik Saleh-bin-Ali, a powerful Chief, against H ^ -rj i. xr xkik ^ o! * t i iq*o Toorkee; but in a few months his followers From Bombay, No. 4a 15, dated 31st July 1873. , . , , . , , . , deserted jl him, and he was reported to be powerless. Later attempts at activity proved equally futile, notwithstanding the endeavours made by himself and by Sheikh Saleh m the south on his behalf; he also failed in his attempts to procure funds from Zanzibar. In June 1872 Colonel Pelly asked if Government would approve of his mediating between Toorkee and Salim (at the former's suggestion), in view to relieving Toorkee of the cost entailed on him by Salim's presence; the basis of such mediation to be the integrity of the Sultanat and pension to Salim, on condition of not molesting Muscat territory. Colonel Pelly doubted the Sultan's finances being capable of paying adequate pension, though he thought that if the Sultan received the Zanzibar subsidy he might perhaps expel Salim. The suggestion was allowed to stand over pending settlement of the Zanzibar subsidy reference to the Secretary of State. Towards the end of December 1872 Salim left Oman and arrived in Bombay, proposing to stay there a short time, but till the present application he had not disclosed the object of his visit. 248. Decision of the Government of India regarding Syud Salim's allowance. —Sir L. Pelly, who happened to be in Calcutta, was consulted regarding the arrangements to be made. He wrote:— ' Syud Toorkee has authorized me to say that he is willing to allow Syud Salim 200 dollars per mensem at once, and to double this allowance in the event of the Muscat State receiving the subsidy from Zanzibar. 'I am aware that Syud Salim is in extreme pecuniary difficulties, and i think Mr. Aitchison's suggestion in regard to his receiving a moderate allowance from the Government of Bombay is convenient; but I would only maintain this arrangement until the Political authorities in the Gulf shall arrange with Toorkee for the payment ot his promised pension. ' I do not think that Syud Salim is dangerous to the rule of Foorkee, but if his pecuniary- wants are not relieved he must either go to jail in Bombay or fly that [port. In the latter event he would return to Kishm, where his presence would create suspicion. &lt;c If Toorkee gets the subsidy, a provision for Salim might verv well be stipulated for, and meantime the Bombay Government might receive the discretionary power to give Salim such moderate allowance as will supply his necessary wants, conditionally on his remaining quietly in British territory.' [iT.-r. Poltl. A., June 1873, Nos. 476-489.]v. . ; S;l;t '• ••. * ' H*r ' -,' In writing to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf regarding the payment of the subsidy to Toorkee, the opportunity was taken to request that Toorkee might be asked what amount he was prepared to allow Syed Salim and Abdool Azeez on condition of their residing in British territory and abstain ing from all interference in the affairs of Muscat. It was at the same time suggested that it would be most convenient to deduct the amount of these stipends from the annual subsidy to be paid to Toorkee. Pending His Highness' decision the Bombay Government were authorized to make such reasonable arrangements for Syed Salim's support as they might consider fit, the sums thus advanced being adjusted at a future time in the payment of the subsidy to Toorkee.

Political Ilesident telegraphed from Gwadur that the Sultan was willing to allow Abdool Azeez and Syud Salim $300 each monthly under the conditions suggested by the Government of India. At this time Abdool Azeez was meditating an attack upon Gwadur (see paragraphs 250 etseq. post) and the telegram continued :— 'I think present time unsuitable for making- offer to Abdool Azeez. taking Gwadur fail, as seem probable, he might perhaps accept terms.' Should his hopes of To which on the Mth of July the following reply was sent by telegram :— ' Sultan 's offer may be made known to Abdool Azeez when you consider expedient.' On the 8th July 1873 the Commissioner in Sind telegraphed that Syud Salim had returned from Bombay to Kurrachee with the intention of going by land to Bushire. The Commissioner asked for orders as to whether Salim should be dissuaded from taking this step. On the 14th of July the following reply was sent by the Government of India:— ' Muscat Sultan offers to give Syed Salim and Abdool Azeez each 300 dollars monthly on condition o£ their residing in British territory and abstaining from interference in Muscat affairs. If 8ahm accepts offer he may remain in British territory where he likes, but if he goes to Bushire nothing can be done for him.' On the 3rd f of July the Political Besident wrote that he had conferred t Political a.. August 1873. N m . 275-281. personally with Toorkee on the subject of these allowances. He continued:— Tlis Highness expressed his readiness to allow each of these Princes a monthly sum of (300) three hundred dollars, on condition of their residing in British territory and abstaining from all mterfeience in the affairs of Muscat. Hig Highness is quite willing, should these arrangements be effected, that the stipends of his relatives should be deducted from the Zanzi bar subsidy. * » * * ' Syud Toorkee is of opinion that Salim has lost all influence and prestige in Oman, and has, therefore, little anxiety about his proceedings. Abdool Azeez, he thinks, more dangerous, and this is also the opinion of both Major Miles and myself. Abdool Azeez has undoubtedly courage and energy. A former Political Agent at Zanzibar considered he had more energy than any of the sons of Syed Saeed. He has also sought to gain the good-will of the religious party of Oman a party which will always be of importance in Oman. It is likely, lerefoie, that if Abdool Azeez lands in Oman he will give even more trouble than Salim did. fflfTv.

Proceedings of Abdool Azeez. Attack by Abdool Azeez upon »wadur and part taken by Aga Khan in providinsr ^ for Abdool Azeez, On the 25tli April 1873, Captain Mockler wrote from Gwadur that he had received news of Abdool Azeez havino* been supplied with Eupoes 20,000 by Aga Khan of Bombay and of his having received some funds from Zanzibar. Aga Khan's motive in thus assisting Abdool Azeez was said to be that he had previously assisted Toorkee with Rupees 12,000 on condition that, if successful in taking Muscat, he would confirm his right and title to the musjid built by the Khojas in Muttra, who had thrown off the allegi ance to Aga Khan. Toorkee, however, after taking Muscat did not fulfil the engagement, finding that the Khoja party was too strong to enable him to do so. On receipt of this information, the Bombay Government were asked to cause enquiries as to the truth of the report regarding Aga Khan's proceedings, and if there should prove to be any foundation for it, to warn Aga Khan distinctly of the penalties to which he rendered himself liable by in any way abetting * Political a ., September 1873, No. 370. such proceedings. The Bombay Govern- ment, * however, reported that Aga Khan wholly denied having aided Abdool Azeez with money, asserting that having already helped Toorkee with Rupees 5,000 it was hardly probable that he would afford assistance to hia rival. Here the matter was allowed by the Government of India to drop. On the 4th June 1873, the Commissioner in Sind telegraphed to the Gov ernment of India that Abdool Azeez had left Bombay with the intention, it was supposed, of attempting to establish himself at Gwadur, and that he had instructed Captain Mockler not to interfere beyond warning all parties against injury to British subjects or property. These instructions were approved by the Government of India, and the Bombay Government were asked to send the first gun-boat which might be available to Gwadur for the purpose of protecting British subjects and interests should the necessity arise. On the 13th June the Government of Bombay were requested— u that if Abdool Azeez should ever return to British territory he may be distinctly warned that he can receive an asylum only on condition of abstaining from intrig-ue and interference in Muscat affairs, and that if, while in British territory, he attempts to wag-e or abets the waging of war with Muscat, or commits or prepares to commit depredations on Muscat territory, he commits an offence against British laws, for which he is liable to punishment under Sections 125-126 of the Penal Code.' IPoltl. A., July 1873, Nos. 13-30.] On the 15th June Abdool Azeez arrived at Oormara with the intention of leaving on the 18th for Pusnee en route to Gwadur. Rumours were abroad that he would be joined by 50 armed men at Kulmat. Meanwhile news was received that Syed Salim had also left Bombay, but he was arrested at Kurrachee on a warrant from Bombay for cheating. Abdool Azeez arrived at Pusnee on the 25th June and wrote requesting the withdrawal of British subjects from Gwadur as he proposed to attack the town after an interval of four days. In reply the Commissioner of Sind directed that he should be informed that he would be held responsible for any injury that might happen to British subjects or property through his acts of aggression. These orders were approved by the Government of India. On the 1st July the Commissioner in Sind telegraphed that Abdool Azeez was reported to have gone to Kullong, in liolano, to one Mulla Rehout Tikree.f Meanwhile con- t Pohticai a ., July i8&lt;3, ao. 8/. siderable delay was caused in despatch ing a gun-boat to Gwadur owing to no boat being available for that purpose. + t ,,... 1A T1 1Q .

The Wali in spite of Abdool Azeez s endea vours remained staunch to the Sultan and Buktar Khan, the cmcf oi '■' H l iCe 1 5 also refused to desert his colours. On the night ot the 18th of July Abdool Azeez took up a position outside the telegraph compound, making it Ins object cut off the town from its water to supply. Meantime he was by order ot the tom- missioner informed that he would be held personally responsible for any injury that mMit occur to the persons or property of British subjects from his proceed ings at Gwadur, and the Assistant Political Agent told the British subjects that if they chose to remain in the fort they would do so at their own risk. Two or three days passed without any decisive attack being made: and on the 21st July there was a temporary cessation of hostilities. About this time the ' Rifleman' arrived off Gwadur, and on the 22nd July a systematic attempt was made by Abdool Azeez to attack the fort; and it was feared that the Wali would be forced owing to superiority of numbers to yield. On the 22nd of July the British subjects finding the position serious left the town. At the same time Nubbee Buksh, apparently hearing the results^ of some spoliation which had been committed on the property ot British subjects, dis severed all connection with Abdool Azeez and the attacking force appeared to devote themselves to looting the town on every available opportunity. On the 14th August the following telegraln was received from the Politi cal Resident of the Gulf. t( Syud Abdool Azeez having in spite of Commissioner in Sind's warning occasioned loss to British Indian subjects at Gwadur by his violent proceedings, I respectfully suggest that in event of his leaving Mekran without making reparation be should be arrested it found at sea, or in British territory, and compelled to accept pension offered by Sultan in v iev. ot amount of claims against him being gradually recovered if he reaches Oman: enforcement of claims will be impracticable, and he will cause much mischief. Commissioner considers this measure would be proper,' and on the same day the following telegram was despatched by the Government of India to the Commissioner in Sind, a copy being sent to Colonel Ross. ' As Abdool Azeez took advantage of his position in British territory to organize expedi tion, you may, if strong enough at Gwadur, instruct Political Agent to call upon him to with draw and disperse his men, and to make him a prisoner if he refuses. .Resident Bushire informed.' On the 16th August the Commissioner telegraphed that Abdool Azeez had left Gwadur on the 7th, saying that he would return in eight days. He added that he was making arrangements in communication with Colonel Ross to intercept and arrest Abdool Azeez, should he have put out to sea. He also added that Salim had threatened to attack Gwadur from Kolanch. On the 26th August the Commissioner was instructed — ' So long as Abdool Azeez and Syud Salim do not molest Gwadur they may be left alone. If either or both return to Gwadur and threaten it, proceed as authorized in mine of fourteenth. Inform Abdool Azeez and Syud Salim of the orders you have received.''31 Captain Mockler on the 15th August wrote that Abdool Azeez had not returned to Grwadur, but that a considerable amount of property had been carried off by his followers. Regarding the extent of the plunder of British subjects and the absence of any collision between British subjects and the belligerents, Captain Mockler wrote :— ' The value of property taken from British subjects amounts to about Rupees 5,000, that of the inhabitants to about the same or more, but of it I have got no list; the cost to Syud Toorkee is about Rupees 8,000. My notices numbered 139, and five shops only bearing them were touched; out of these two contained British subjects' goods only, the others property belonging to people of Gwadur besides, but were rented by British merchants, not a foot was placed inside British precincts with the exception of the mat boat-shed, and in that matter I did not consider it prudent or politic to interfere j it was open to the telegraph people to put their boat into it whenever they chose; it afforded no protection or assistance; one similar to it could have been put up close to it in fifteen minutes and offered a fair mark for the besieged to fire at, which they did but unsuccessfully; it says much for the conduct of all parties that not the slightest collision occurred between any of our people and the belligerents*.' and regarding the part taken by Khoda Nubbee Bux :— ' It perhaps deserves to be noted that Khoda Nubbee Bux fed himself and his immediate followers the whole time; he got supplies from his own home, refusing to eat of stolen pro perty, the others were not quite so particular, but I believe few except the Rinds personally engaged in looting, nevertheless were it practicable Khoda Nubbee Bux should be required to answer for all and make it good, perhaps this might be effected through the Khan if not a formal pardon from Government would, I believe, be a not unwise measure; the losses of the merchants would, however, have to be considered, as indeed, I hope, they will be in any case' ■ The conduct of the men of the ' Bifleman' was most satisfactory through out the alfair. 251. Compensation to British subjects for losses at Gwa dur. —On the 23rd November 1873 the merchants, British subjects at Gwadur, presented a petition to Captain Mockler, urging that their losses during the siege of that place by Abdool Azeez amounted to Rupees 48,658, and trusting that compensation would be allowed. Sir W. Merewether, in forwarding this memorial to the Government of India on the 18th Eebruary, wrote that before submitting the question he had asked Colonel Ross for an expression of his opinion. Colonel Ross wrote in reply:— ' There seems no possibility of obtaining reimbursement of the traders through His High ness Syud Toorkee unless a demand were made on the Sultan; that this course, I think, you will agree with me would not be advisable. ' In a similar previous case of plunder by Syud Abdool Azeez of some traders at Charbar, Government decided that unless Syud Toorkee would voluntarily indemnify the traders for the acts of his brother, the matter should be allowed to drop. His Highness being sounded was by no means ready to pay. ' I am inclined to suggest in the present case that Abdool Azeez should continue to be held responsible, and that he should understand that whenever circumstances allowed of it the claims against him will be enforced/'' Sir W, Merewether thus expressed his opinion:— ' The case alluded to by Colonel Ross as having occurred at Charbar related to a small loss inflicted on merchants there by Sultan Abdool Azeez, and which was not pressed by them. The petitioners refer to an occasion when their losses at Charbar were made good; that was at the same time as the one mentioned by Colonel Ross, but the injuries were sus tained by the merchants at the hands of the Persian troops when they took Charbar, ousting Sultan Abdool Azeez therefrom; these losses were made good by order of the Persian Government. ' Sultan Abdool Azeez was fully warned at the time that he would be held responsible for any injury he might cause to British subjects by his proceedings at Gwadur, I tut under thd circumstances it might be thought best that the amount should be paid now out of the Govern ment of India Treasury under the understanding stated by Colonel Ross, and that Sultan Abdool Azeez should be made acquainted with the liability, I would request the favor of orders on this subject. 1 'The Foreign Secretary wrote ' I am afraid the sufferers must bear the losses inflicted on them during the local disturb ance. Toorkee clearlv is not responsible and cannot be expected to pay. Abdool Azeez is a prisoner receiving a pittance and cannot pay. It would be both unusual and an inconvenient precedent for Government to pay. ' Persons who settle in foreign parts must take a reasonable share of the attendant risks- Government of course protect them and get compensation for them as far as they possibly can; but when redress is beyond their power the sufferers must put up with the circumstances.' His Excellency the Viceroy concurred, and the Commissioner in Sind was therefore on the 24th March instructed that — ' Syud Toorkee clearly cannot be held responsible for the losses suffered by British subjects during the local disturbances, and Abdool Azeez being a prisoner in receipt of a small stipend, it is useless to expect that compensation will be forthcoming from him. ' His Excellency in Council is unable to accede to your recommendation that the sufferers should be compensated from the Imperial Treasury. They have no claim to such compensation from Government, and to grant it in this case would establish an embarrassing precedent.' 252. Further proceedings of Abdool Azeez after his retire ment from Gwadur —On the 29th August the Commissioner telegraphed that Abdool Azeez was in Bahu and Syud Salim at Kedj; and that their pre sence was disordering the country. Sir W. Merewether recommended that both Abdool Azeez and Salim should be called upon to come to Gwadur where Toorkee's terms could be offered to them. He added:— ' If they refuse (they) could be told will be arrested wherever and whenever caught I con clude if either attempt to cross to Oman they must be arrested.' To this telegram the following reply was sent on the 1st September:— ' Inform Abdool Azeez and Syed Salim of terms arranged with Toorkee, invite them to accept and come in within ten days, if now refused terms will not be renewed; if they forcibly threaten Gwadur or attempt to cross to Oman or Persian Gulf arrest them if possible. Warn them distinctly of this.' On the 16th* September 1873, the Political Resident telegraphed that the * Political a ., September 1873, No. 376. ' Rifleman' had captured Abdool Azeez . near boor with 11 armed men, and soli cited instructions whether he should endeavour to mediate between Toorkee and Abdooi Azeez. In reply the Political Resident was instructed to try and obtain Abdooi Azeez's formal acceptance of the terms offered by Toorkee, in the event of a refusal to despatch him to Kurrachee. On the 29th September the Government of India were informed by tele graph tha^ Abdool Azeez had absolutely refused the terms offered by Toorkee, and i nar he had also declined to entertain a proposal that the monthly allow ance to be paid by foorkee to him should be increased from 300 to 500 dollars. I he Commissioner in Sind was instructed to detain Abdool Azeez in honorable surveillance at Kurraehee, a warrant under Regulation III. of 1818 being for warded to him for that purpose. Sir W. Merewether was also asked to warn film that if lie intrigued or attempted to escape he would be placed in custody and was authorized to expend for his support a sum not exceeding 300 dollars, to be deducted from the subsidy payable to Toorkee. * Political A., December 1873, Nos. 44-52.

Sultan Ahdool Azeez, had been permitted to reside mthout molestation m Brihsh territory, but he had left it for the purpose of ereati, &lt;' disturbances in the terntoiy of His H.gbness the Sultan of Muscat, that such could not be permitted by the Government of India, and as he had attempted to cross the seas to land at Oman orders had been issued to apprehend him, and he had been accordingly arrested at sea near Soor by one of Her Majesty's erasers; that the orders of Government were that he should be given undisturbed residence in Kurrachee provided he abstained from interferinff in any way in the affairs of, Oman, and its dependencies, and would not leave Kurraehee without first receiving permission from the British authorities to do so. ' He raised objections to this saying- that the terms offered him by His Highness Sultan Toorkee were quite insufficient; that he did not care to remain in Kurrachee, with which be was quite unacquainted, and the Government might do what they liked with him. ' I then explained to him that having created disturbances in Mekrau, reiected Sultan Toorkee's offer as communicated to him by Captain Mockler, and having attempted to cross the sea to land m Oman with the view of acting against His Highness Sultan Toorkee, he had now lost the opportunity of making terms, and that all I could do was to communicate to him the orders of the Government of India, which were that he was to be kept here in honorable surveillance provided he abstaiped from intriguing in the affairs of Oman and would not attempt to escape. That for his greater convenience I was prepared to take his promise that he would act only as was desired, when he could reside here quite unmolested, but if he declined I should be compelled to apply for other orders as to his disposal, which would involve his confinement in such place as Government was pleased to direct. I then advised him*to return on board the Columbine and consider the matter well before he gave me a final answer. ' To-day he informed me through Captain Mockler that he was ready to give the promise I suggested, and supplied the document herewith forwarded in original. ^ This makes his remaining here much more easy than it would otherwise have been, and it cannot but be more satisfactory to the Sultan himself. The wise decision he has arrived at while partly coming from the good common sense he is certainly possessed of is also in a great measure due to the advice given him by Captain Mockler, and to the influence that officer has gained with him by considerate treatment. Quarters have been prepared for the Sultan in a suitable place here, and he will land to o'ccupy them tomorrow.' The document above referred to ran as follows:— ' By the Grace of God I, Abdool Azeez bin Syud bin Sultan, the son of the Imaum, promise that I will not meddle in anything appertaining to Oman, its dependencies, possessions, nobles, Sheiks, families, people, subjects, or towns, fill such time as the English Government shall give me permission to do so, and I will live in whatever place the English Goverrrment desires, and will not leave it till the English Government gives me permission to do so ; this I promise, and God is the best of witnesses.' In reply the following directions were given to the Commissioner:— ' Abdool Azeez should be allowed as complete liberty as you may think consistent with the enforcement of the conditions which he has accepted; but if he violates them by intriguing or attempting to escape, the warrant under Regulation III. of 1818, which was sent to you with my letter No. 2292P., dated 25th September last, should be enforced. 'The monthly allowance of $300 should be paid to Abdool Azeez with effect from the date of his capture, viz., the 12th September last, and the sums paid will be adjusted out of the Zanzibar subsidy paid by the British Government to Toorkee. Such steps as you may think advisable should be taken to prevent Abdool Azeez from incurring debt, and it should be made known to the public that no aid need be expected from Government by any one who lends him money or suffers him to contract liabilities.' 253. Toorkee complains of breach of asylum by Khan of Khelat. —On the 19th* September 1873, Political Resident forwarded two letters from Toorkee to His Excellency the * Political a., december 1873. Nos. 53-63. Viceroy. They were mostly general in their terms, but the following passage occurred in one of them:— ' What I intend to represent to Your Excellency is this, that when my brother, Abdool Azeez, after he had started from the port of Bombay arrived in Kedj, which is in the neighbour- . hood of Mekran, the people of that place followed him, waged a war in Jowazer, a city in my dominion, plundered the subjects of my country, and defaced my territory. All may be said to have been done by the Khan of Ivhelat, because Kedj is a dependency oi Khelat, and Fakeer Mahomed is the Governor of the place on the part of the Khan, and also 33 1CSSTMSM ' i '?' 1 's '-T ™ •* ^ ' Your Excellency takes notice of this affair. ' ^ 1.1 His Excellency the Viceroy replied on the 15th November as follows '&lt; I have recrived Your Highness' letter dated September last, in which yon oomphm that when Ahdool Azeez landed on theMekran Coast he wasjomed by certain of the .nhatatonts o£ fCMj who plnndcvcd Jowazer, a town in yonr territory, and that the people of Kedj were not restrained by the Governor of the place. « Mv friend, I have pleasure in informing you that Abdool Azeez is not likely again tu cause Your Highness any disquietude a^ he has been taken prisoner aud has entered mto an agreement not^to quit Kurrachee without the permission of the British Government, nor to agreement i H^hness'authority. In accordance with the arrangement entered into IrYoT ffiglrss fc C ZTvLted a monthly allowance of $300 payable from the Zanzibar subsidy which Your Highness receives from the British Government. Regarding this the Eoreign Secretary wrote ' Under present circumstances no reference need be made to Khelat about the alleged breach of asylum. The Khan has at present no real control in Kedj.' 254. Requests preferred by Abdool Azeez in connection with his detention at Kurrachee —On the 28th October 1873, Sir W Merewether forwarded a communication received from Aodool Azeez, in which he preferred three requests, 1st, that Government would ettect a reconciliation between him and Toorkee and get permis &gt;ion for him to reside at Muscat, apparently with the view of eventually succeeding to the throne Ox Muscat; 2nd, that failing the Government would allow him Rupees 2,000 a month and give him $ 10,000 to pay his debts- and for other purposes; and 3rd, that he might be permitted to live at Bombay. Abdool Azeez endea voured to show that he had received no warning against going to Oman. Sir W. Merewether wrote:— ' Sultan Abdool Azeez seems to base his argument on the fact that he had received no warning against his going to Oman; but that cannot be held to affect the main issue, which was that he had been residing in safety in British territory, and had taken advantage of the facilities so afforded him to proceed to the territories of our ally the Sultan of Muscat ana create disturbances therein. He was caught on the high seas having with him i 1 armed followers, and he acknowledged it was his intention to act against the Ruler of Muscat, ihe Government letter he quotes certainly does not forbid his leaving Bombay, but it clearly shows his going back to Gwadur would be disapproved, and all countenance would be withdrawn from him if he did so. ' Sultan Abdool Azeez makes two requests, one that his allowance may be largely increased, the other that the Government of India may interest itself to bring about a reconciliation between himself and his brother. Sultan Toorkee. ' With regard to the first. Sultan Abdool Azeez appears to have acquired grand ideas and very expensive habits while residing in Bombay. His proposals are most extravagant and very unnecessarily large. If his debts were paid and his allowance increased to $500 or Ru pees 1,000 per mensem, it would be quite as much as he could reasonably expect, and as much as His Highness Sultan Toorkee could probably afford. I should certainly not advise his being permitted to reside in Bombay, on account of its being such a very expensive place, and one where he would be tempted to indulge in all manner of dissipation and extravagance. He does not like Kurrachee he says, because he knows no one in it, and has no means of amusing himself or of passing his time. He might be given the choice of any other place in the Bombay Presidency, excepting Bombay itself, but I have advised him to become better satis fied with Kurrachee, it being an excellent climate, and after a while he would find there were many in it worth knowing and making his friends. 'The question of reconciliation depends upon His Highness Sultan Toorkee's views, whether he thinks it would be safe to have his younger brother settled down in Oman, bultan Abdool Azeez is certainly an ambitious man, and would not be satisfied with a little power. Me is very easily led, and would, I am afraid, be more likel v to join in any political move that was made to appear to his advantage than to throw his whole weight into the scale in behalf of his brother to help in consolidating his power and establishing permanent order in Oman. He 3454 is quite young, only 25, has good repute for courage, and having apparently open, hearty manner, with much bonhomie is a favorite generally. He would, therefore, prove a formidable rival if he ever entered into opposition.' Tlie Eoreign Secretary wrote :— ' I would enter into no discussion with him as to the justice of his arrest. He abused his asylum in British territory to foment an intrigue against Toorkee, who is our ally, to rebel against him, and to endeavour to wrest from him part of his possession. His sovereign Toorkee agrees to the manner in which he has been treated, and Abdool Azeez knows well enough the reason for it. ' His request for an increased allowance and for a grant of | 10,000 may be refused. He has been such a short time at Kurrachee that it is not desirable to move him at present, but the Commissioner may be told that if hereafter he thinks it advisable that Abdool Azeez should reside elsewhere in the Bombay Presidency on the same conditions His Excellency in Council will not object. ^ There is no chance of a reconciliation with Toorkee. Still to remove a]l ground of complaint the Political Agent at Muscat may consult Toorkee and report what he may consider it practicable to do.' {Political A., January 1874, Nob. 203-210.] The Commissioner in Sind was therefore told (1) that the Political Eesident would be asked to consult Toorkee on the subject of the possibility of effecting a reconcilation, but that it was feared that there was but little chance of its being brought about; (2) that His Excellency in Council was unable to accede to the request of Abdool Azeez that Government would allow him Rupees 2,000 per mensem and give him $10,000 ; and (3) that the Syud has been such a short time at Kurrachee that it was not desirable to remove him? at present, but if hereafter he considered it advisable that he should reside elsewhere in the Bombay Presidency, on the same conditions as he at present lives in Kurrachee, His Excellency in Council would not object. Regarding Abdool Azeez's complaint of the injustice of his arrest it was added:— ' In his letter Abdool Azeez complains of the injustice of his arrest, on the ground that he was not warned that Government viewed his proceedings in Oman with displeasure. His Excellency in Council can enter into no discussion on this subject. Abdool Azeez abused his asylum in British territory to foment an intrigue against His Highness Syud Toorkee, who is the ally of the British Government, to rebel against him and to endeavour to wrest from him part of his possessions, and the Sultan, his sovereign, agrees to the manner in which he has been treated.' On the 31st January * 1874, Colonel Ross reported that he had sounded Toorkee reffardin^ the possibility of a * Political A.. February 1874, No. 315. reconciliation with Abdool AZGCZ, but that he found Toorkee not at all disposed to make any reconciliation with his brother and unwilling to consent to Abdool Azeez's residing at Muscat or any place in his dominion. A copy of this letter was sent to the Commissioner in Sind. f 1874, Abdool Azeez addressed a letter to Colonel Ross, praying (1) that either he might t Political a ., Apni 1874, &gt; &gt;s. 233-235. allowed to return to Muscat, a recon ciliation being effected between him and Toorkee; or (2) that Government would give him a pension of Rupees 2,000 and allow him to live at Bombay. He still insisted on the insufficiency of his present allowance. Fo this lettei Colonel Ross on the 7th March replied :— ' I am happy to inform you that His Highness Syud Toorkee has now recovered from his recent illness, and is not in need of your presence to assist him in managing the affairs of his kingdom. ' The arrangements made for Your Highness by Government and the Commissioner are due to the friendship of Government for Your Highness family, and their desire tor the welfare and tranquillity of Oman, and I trust that recognizing this you will be satisfied with them and be sure that all due and reasonable consideration will be given to 1 our Highness affairs. Your Highness' letter will be transmitted for the information of Government, but I am unable to recommend either of your proposals at the present time. 35 On the 16tli Eebruary nThis reply was approved by tho Government of India, and a copy of the correspondence was for warded to the Commissionei in S ind. In ay jdool ™eez was at Toorkec's request allowed to return to Muscat For an account of the circumstances which led to his recall, see paragraphs, 275 efseq. of this precis. 955 Proceedings of Syud Salim. His refusal to accept thP tprins offered by Toorkee; his attack upon Gwadur; his escape to Kishm .-In September 1873 Salim, then at Bahoo m Persian territory, beyond Gwadur on the Mekran Coast, had been informed of the offer made by Toorkee for his maintenance, and he was told that he was at liberty to come into Gwadur to accept tbe offer, provided he made his appearance with- in two days after the receipt of the communication from tbe Assistant Political Agent at Gwadur. To this communication # Political a. j December 1873, No. 46. Syud Salim on the 10th September * re plied to Captain Mockler as follows ■ ' Your honoured letter has arrived, and all you have said we have understood;and indeed we for our part desire to come to terms with our brother Toorkee; but he does not desire that as you will certainly see by and bye, but we desire it, but we have three conditions, and if he will agree to them,'taking the great Government as his witness, we will agree :— Ixt « Let him give us the same amount monthly as we used to give him when lie stayed in Bombay; and the second condition, that he does not meddle with our property in Oman and Muscat and raises his hand from it, so that we may do what we like with it, either sell it or rent it. he must not hinder us, This we ask of the great Government that it will propose these terms; and certainly the Government fe a just one and does not desire our hurt, and I have oreat expenses'on account of my following, and we laid our condition befoie Colonel I elly when he came to Bombay from Zanzibar, but he went to Calcutta to the Governor-General and we hoped for an answer from Calcutta, and we waited some time for an answer; finally, we have came here from Bombay, and now we t Beloocliee far ' good. are waiting here in this desert, audits ' Sher f It is understood here that SyedSalira means he will speaking rulers, and as for him ffe tried by means accept the conditions he puts forward in this letter. 0 f every one to get us to accept a monthly stipend (Sd.) \v. L. M. an( j we would not agree, but now we will accept, the Government being our witness.' Major Miles consulted Toorkee regarding the requests preferred by Syed Salim and thus reported the result:— ' On my communicating these proposals to His Highness Syud Toorkee he expressed him self at once as disinclined to grant Syed Salim a higher pension than was received by Syed Abdool Azeez, who, he stated, had stronger claims on him, and he was further of opinion that it would be impolitic to do so. * ' His Highness was, however, willing to agree to Syud Salim receiving the rent and pro, fits of his property in Muscat and Oman inherited from his mother, though he objected to the property being sold or to an agent being appointed on the part of Syed Salim to look after it- as His Highness considered that such person would very probably be used as an instrument in intriguiug with the tribes by his nephew. ' I quite concur in the opinion that it would not be at all advisable to increase Syed Salim's allowance beyond that of Syed Abdool Azeez, and His Highness' objections with regard to the property also appear to me reasonable. T trust, however, that his concession in allowing his nephew the fruition of his property in addition to the amount of his pension wili lead to the acceptance by the latter of the terms offered him.' On receiving this report the Government of India determined that, as Salim was still at large, no further steps need be taken. Meanwhile Salim remained in Dustyari with the intention, it was supposed, of going to Jask and Kishm and watching events there. On the 5th November the Commissioner in Sind was asked to inform Syud Salim:— ' that His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council declines to negotiate any terms with him or with His Highness Syud Toorkee regarding him except those of which he has been already informed; that if he comes into Gwadur or Kurrachee and gives himself up unconditionally he will be granted the same provision as Abdool Azeez; but that if he does not 36comply within such time as you may direct, the terms will not be renewed, but he will be made a pnsouer wherever found, and w .ll then receive only such terms as may be thought fit which will not be so favorable as those now offered.' 53 J * Political A., December 1873, Nos. 53-63. ^ ^ ^ ' 1 ' - 5til xV OVGHllDGr ^ in reply to Q, t -p t, ,, ^ T7 . ietter received from Toorkee through Colo nel Eoss His Excellency the Viceroy wrote : i £ ^ LOl ii highness has also been troubled by the rebellious conduct of Syed ^alim actuated by a friendly desire towards lour Highness, and with a view to preserve peace, the' Commis- sioner m S uk I has been directed to mform Syed Salim that Government declines to negotiate any terms with him or with Your Highness regarding him except those of which he has been aheadj mfoimed, that if he comes into Gwadur or Kurxachee and gives himself up uncondi tionally he will be granted some provision as Abdool Azeez has received; but that if he does not comply within such time as the Commissioner may direct the terms will not be renewed but he will be made a prisoner wherever he may be found and then will receive only such terms as may be thought fit which will not be so favorable as those now offered/' On the 8th December f 1873, the Assistant Political Agent at Gwadur t Political a., December 1873, Nos. 156-168. telegraphed through the Bombay Govern- . ment that Syed Salim had been duly warned that he would be seized if he refused the offer of Government, and had suddenly taken G^adur by surprise during the absence of the Wullee at Muscat having previously altogether declined to accept the terms offered. The Bombay Government added that orders had been issued for the immediate despatch to Gwadur of an armed body of Police under the command of an European Officer. The following reply was sent on the same day by the Government of India:— ' Arrange for vessel of war to proceed at once to Gwadur to protect persons and interests of British subjects: no objection to vessel assisting Toorkee if he asks it.' Toorkee immediately on hearing of the capture proposed to send off a body of 200 men with one gun. On the 12th and 13th of December, the Assistant Political Agent at Gwadur telegraphed that he had called on Salim to surrender and had drawn a cordon across the Isthmus, but that Salim had managed to effect his escape and had probably gone to Jiustyaree. Sir W. Merewether instructed Captain Mockler not to pursue or follow Salim into Persian territory, and these instructions were approved by the X Political a ., January 1874, Nos. ii4-ii7. Government of India. On the 27th | of December, the Political Resident tele graphed that the Captain of the Nimble, which had proceeded to Gwadur, had asked for instructions whether he was at liberty to offer Abdool Kubbee arrears of subsidy on guarantee of procuring the arrest of Salim passing through his district. Abdool Nubbee is a petty Belooch Chief near Jask, who formerly received a subsidy from the Persian Gulf telegraph for protecting lives. This subsidy was stopped for misconduct. The Resident considered it unadvisabte to treat with Abdool Nubbee for the arrest of Salim, and this view was approved by the Government of India. From the details of Salim's attack, which were subsequently reported, it appeared that Salim was only accompanied by 17 followers, two Kolanch Beloochees and a few men of the Georgis clan, subjects of Din Mahomed of Dustyar, and Captain Mockler expressed his firm conviction that the fort had been treacherously surrendered by the acting Wullee. On the 6th December § Captain Mockler forwarded to the Commissioner ^ a letter addressed by him to Salim, and § Political A., January 1874 Nos. 258-259. Sa|im ' s reply thereto. Captain Mockler invited Salim to come to Gwadur or Kurrachee, in which case the terms therein tendered by him might still be accepted. Otherwise he distinctly told Salim that the offer would not again be made, and that he would be seized wherever found and dealt with according to the pleasure of the Government of India. Salim still refused to come to terms and referred to his previous letter represent- in^ the insufficiency of the allowance offered to him by Toorkee (|300 per 37 kmensem). He claimed Muscat throne as his by right and expressed a determi nation to get back his kingdom. On the 22nd of November Captain Mockler stated that Salim had left Dustyaree and was supposed to be making for Bunder Abbass and Kishm, although his exact movements were not known. Meanwhile Toorkee's troops having arrived at GwadUr a day after the fair, had returned to Muscat: and the country about Gwadur remained generally undisturbed. Salim made * his way to Bunder Abbass. * Political a., March 1874, ^'os. 225 -226. q n January Toorkee addressed the following letter to Colonel Ross:— ' Concerning the sons of my brother, Syud Thoweynee bin Saeed, who are at present in Bunder Abbass^it is now a long time since I have paid them a pension, and they always receive it from me, now their brother Harab has joined them, and I have promised to give him a pension on account of our relationship. I have heard that Salim has arrived at Bunder Abbass. If the Government think it advisable that I should give him an allowance it must include the pensions of all the rest, as I cannot pay them separate pensions. It is not unknown to you that I have got great expenses.' To which Colonel Ross wrote the following reply :— ' I have had the honor of receiving Your Highness' letter of 17th Zilkada, concerning the position of Your Highness' nephew, Syud Salim bin Thoweynee. ' Your Highness' former offer of an allowance to Syud Salim, provided he remained in India and refrained from interfering in the affairs of Oman, was made known formally to Syud Salim by order of Government, and he was told that if he did not accept this offer it would not be renewed, he was also warned that by persisting in acting contrary to the wishes of Government he would render himself liable to arrest. &lt;&lt; In spite of this caution Syud Salim immediately proceeded against Gwadur, whence he escaped along the Mekran Coast and was last heard of near Bunder Abbass. ' Under the existing circumstances, I have no hesitation in saying Government would not wish to require Your Highness at present to renew your offer of an allowance to Syud Salim/' This reply was approved by the Government of India, it being added :— ' It should, however, be understood that if the Sultan wishes to make any provision for Syud Salim, there is no objection to his so doing on the part of the Government of India, though Government will not in any way interest themselves on Salim's behalf.'' On the 7th March f 1874 Colonel Ross reported that Salim was then at . „ 1 . J , , . „ ^ _ Kishm. He addressed Toorkee to the t Political A., March 1874, No. 27. , i • , ... enect that his present position was in tolerable and that he committed himself to his uncle's clemency as he had relinquished all intention of opposition in future. Toorkee did not reply to this address of Salim, considering the whole matter to be in the hands of the British + t &gt; v.- , * ™ tvt o. Government. Colonel Ross, however, shortly J afterwards stated that he believed it to be Toorkee's intention to make a small allowance to Syud Salim.39 SECTION III. SUMMARY OF MISCELLANEOUS IN FORMATION UP TO CAPTURE OF SOHAR BY TOORKEE; EVENTS AT MUSCAT DURING TOORKEE'S ABSENCE AT SOHAR; RISING OF SHEIK SALEH BIN ALI; CAPTURE OF MUTTRA; PLUNDER OF BRITISH SUBJECTS; TERMS ARRANGED BETWEEN SALEH BIN ALT AND TOORKEE ; PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION BY TOOR KEE ON ACCOUNT OF PLUNDER OF BRITISH SUBJECTS. 256. Recovery of certain sums from the Sohar Chief as compensation to persons plundered by him.— In September 1871 (see paragraph 206 of previous precis) Ibrahim bin Ghais of Sohar plundered and imprisoned certain British subjects at Khabooreh, and the Government of India authorized the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, to demand satisfaction or 'bombard Sohar. The Political Resident arrived before Sohar and his demands ^ ^ tcihTi ' xt were complied with. In-May 1873* the * Political A., July 1873, Nos. 142-145. ,. . . x ,. tit»n o' r « i entire claims aggregating ^2,zoo were paid by the Chief into the Muscat treasury, and the Government of India directed that the money should be paid to the persons plundered. On the 28th Novem ber (Political A., January 1874, Nos. 16-17) Major Miles stated that the amounts had been paid to the persons plundered or their appointed agents, a list of whom he submitted. 257. Instructions t to the Political Agent, Gwadur, not to * t&gt; i a t -vf 91Q , 0A interfere in local quarrels.—On the Political A., June 1873, Nos. 218 -224. ^ Marclll873 Ca p tain M ockld', the Assistant Political Agent, Gwadur, reported to the Political Agent, Muscat that he had received news from the Wali of Gwadur to the effect that a Muscat subject of the Redame tribe, by name Tewail, had been plundered by some Rinds from Mund. This letter was accompanied by a request for the good offices and advice of the Political Agent with the view of effecting an amicable adjustment of the affair. The Assistant Political Agent added:— 'as a friend of His Highness {i.e., the Sultan of Muscat), I shall assist his representative here to the best of my ability with advice and such other aid as it is in my province to afford f but he at the same time expressed a wish that the Sultan of Muscat— « W ould issue instructions for his subjects to refer their grievances always to his representative here in the first instance and not take the law into their own hands.' The Political Agent at Muscat replied that he quite agreed— 'as to the advisability of His Highness' subjects at Gwadur representing their grievances in such cases to the Wali instead of taking the law into their own hands and expressed a belief that His Highness , wishes and orders on the subject, with which the inhabitants of Gwadur were well acquainted, were to the same effect. Colonel Ross reported these proceedings to the Government of India, and in replv a copy of a letter dated 6th May, addressed by the Government to the Commissioner in Sind, was sent for his information. In this letter the Govern ment of India had issued instructions to the Officer at Gwadur, enjoining him to interfere as little as possible in local quarrels. 258 Persian appropriation of Muscat possessions on the Mekran Coast.— Sir W . t Merewether in March 1873 forwarded to the Government of India the following two telegrams dated 25th and 26th March from Gwadur:— 'Reported that the Ibrahim Khan is on his way to Tiz to see new fort. Expected there in two or three days, arrived at Kassarkund four days ago, and report that two rersian40 officials arrived at Kassarkund on road to Charbar to open up trade; that if Banians will return will be exempted from taxes for one year. Mirza Said Husain previous to leaving Tiz for Muscat took away Husain Khan of Geh's subsidy guarantee, said none of these people have right to money from British Government, believe Din Mahomed and others are to be taken away also; under order, it is said, from Persia,' and in forwarding them he remarked— ' that if something is not arranged in regard to Persian appropriation of Muscat posses sions on Mekran Coast, difficulties will arise in regard to protection of telegraph line.' [Poltl. A., July 1873, Nos. 344-345.] Regarding this the Foreign Secretary wrote:— ' I do not anticipate much difficulty from the annexation of Muscat possessions in Mekran by Persia. So far as I know, Muscat had only two possessions there, Charbar and Gwadur. The former has been swallowed up; the latter is protected both by Goldsmid's boundary and by the express abandonment by Persia of all claim to it. The other parts of the coast up to Gwadur are already Persian, so there remains nothing more for her to annex. ' Under the Telegraph Convention with Persia we pay her Rupees 13,000 a year for leave to lay down the line through her territories and have the right to make our own arrangements with the local Chiefs for the protection of the line. The amount payable to the local Chiefs • A question might .rise about it with Muscat, hut for Charbar is Rupees 500 a year. With this pay- it has not yet arisen, and if it does, the best solution nient .Persia • has nothmg' to do any more than will be to pay it also to the Sultan. with the payments to the other Chiefs who were subject to Persia at the time the engagement was made. If the Persians take the payments away from the Chiefs after we have made them that is quite another question between the Persian Government and them. If disturbances result we can stop the payments altogether, and under the convention call upon Persia to do all she can to protect the line. T 1 • » • * I do not see the difficulties to be anticipated; but it would be as well to ask Sir W. Merewether for a special report.' His Excellency the Viceroy agreed and the Commissioner of Sind was therefore told:— ' As Gwadur is now protected both by Sir F. Goldsmid's boundary, and by the express abandonment by Persia of all claims to it, there are apparently no further possessions on the Mekran Coast for Persia to annex. Under these circumstances. His Excellency in Council does not at present anticipate any serious difficulties with regard to the protection of the telegraph line. Should you, however, still be of opinion that difficulties are likely to arise, 1 am to request that you will submit, for the information of His Excellency in Council, a special report on the subject, and suggest the measures you would propose to meet them.' ♦ • ■ Ji 259. Supply of cannont shot to Toorkee.— On the 26th April t Political a ., juue 1873, Nos. 244-250. tH j 3 Toojkct applied to the Political Agent at Muscat for assistance from Gov ernment in obtaining shot for his field pieces. The Military Department were consulted, and no objection being raised, orders were issued to the Government of Bombay, sanctioning the supply of 2,000 cannon shot if avail able to Toorkee on payment of their value.

Toorkee's successful proceedings t against Ibrahim t Political a ., July 1873, Nog. 457 460. ^in Gliais at Sohar in July 1873.— Early in June 1873 Ibrahim bin Ghais left Sohar, where he had long asserted his independence of, and hostility to, Toorkee, and proceeded to Khabooreh en route to assume possession of the town of El Hazan which he had accepted from its owner, Eeysul bin Hamood, of Rostak, who could not afford to retain it. Ibrahim, however, very shortly afterwards returned from El Haza^ to Sohar. Toorkee had for some time previous medi tated the recovery of Sohar and other places on the Batinah Coast in the hands of Ibrahim, and on the 10th of June he sent 250 Wahabee soldiers in that direction, delaying to join them himself in order that he might first see Colonel Ross at Muscat. However, on the 3rd July he was said to have embarked deter mined to make an effort to take Sohar, though diffident of success. The Politi cal Resident, Persian Gulf, at the same time reported that the Chiefs of Debaye and Amulgavin would probably co-operate with Toorkee against Sohar, and that Bedr bin Syef, Toorkee's Commander at Lawa, was also raising men from the tribes of the Batinah. The Sultan left Mahomed bin Azan Al-lu-Saeed in charge of Muscat with 100 men of the Pembo Hanan clan, but things were not altogether satisfactory there as Saleh-bin-Ali, the Harithree Chief, although Toorkee considered him unable to carry out his menace, threatened to make an attempt on Muscat as soon as Toorkee should move in the direction of Sohar. At the same time the presence of Abdool Azeez on the Mekran Coast was a considerable source of uneasiness to Toorkee, and a body of 20 men was despatched by him to strengthen the garrison at Gwa- dur. The Political Resident of the Gulf was at the time these events § Political a .. Aug„ st 1873. No». 11-12. 1 were happening at Mus^t Toorkee ao- cordingly § proceeded to Sohar and com menced operations after being joined by some of the El Nairn tribe of El Dhabueh and probably by other tribes. The El Naim party, while on their way to join Toorkee at Sohar, took the opportunity of plundering the town of Soham, which was then in the hands of Ibrahim bin Ghais. In a letter |j which ,, „ . A . , -.0^0 ^ oa was received at Muscat on the 20th July Political A., August 1873, No. 28. ,, u in -i S, the Sultan announced the surrender of Sohar. After having invested the fort for some days Toorkee * entered into t o v.- w 0 . u xr ^ negotiations with Ibrahim through the IF Political A., September 1873, No. 76. i. j • „ , - , , , . . ,. 0 , mediation or Mahomed bin All wuld el Saef el Naimi, which resulted in Ibrahim giving up Sohar and other places on the Coast in consideration of recovering $ 5,000 and receiving a monthly allowance of $ 100 to be paid on condition of his residing in or near Heebee, and not approaching further east. The results of this little expedition were satisfac tory and brought under the authority of Toorkee the whole of El Batinah, with the exception of one or two refractory tribes. As far as Ibrahim was con cerned the lesson was thought to be sufficient to prevent him from taking the 41 L42 field a'ain for a considerable time. The political disposition of tlie Batinali Co st was at this time (August 1873) reported by Major Miles to be as follows. From Lawa northwards to Khor Fakan the coast was under Arabeh -hm-Kattan El Bu Saidi. From Lawah to Khabooreh, including Sohar, the coast was entrusted to Bedr-bin-Seif. and from Khabooreh to El Mesnaah it was under the charge of Hamid-bin -Hamad al Bu Saidi. Toorkee returned to Muscat on the 3rd August. 262. Events at Muscat during Toorkee s absence and after Ms return.— During Toorkee's absence a party of the hostile Bern Raweyeh tribe came down and attacked Semail, carrying oif the ripe fiuit of the Sultan's date plantations tliere, although opposed by ^ the ah of Semail. Toorkee proposed to proceed in person from Burka to punish this tribe but was prevented by illness from so doing. The Beni Raweyeh, however, returned quietlv to their districts having a promise ot support from Saleh bm Ah in the event of their being attacked by Toorkee. Saleh hm Ah, the Chief of the Harithee, too had threatened that he would attack Muscat during Toorkee's absence. He was, however, unsuccessful in his attempt to organize a rising at El Sherkeyeh, and was therefore forced to put oil lor tuture occasion his intended demonstration against the Sultan. Shortly after Toorkee's return a party of Al Wahibeh Bedouins, numbering about 400, arrived at Muscat and encamped outside Muttra on the usual pre text of obtaining presents from the Sultan. No suspicion was at first aroused by their presence, but it was soon evident that Saleh bin Ali, who had been en deavouring to raise the Henavee tribes, had despatched the ahibeh Bedouins as an advanced force to await him at Muscat, his intention being to follow them as soon as possible, attacking Muttra with such force as he could collect. The Al Wahibeh reached Muttra without opposition, but here Saleh's scheme was discovered and the Ghafiree tribe. El Nedabaeen, immediately occupied the pass of Akk, thus checking the further progress of the advancing force. Major Miles thus described what followed :— ' There are three roads from El Sherkeyah to Semail and Muscat, two of which, the Wadies Dheykah and Akk, are in the hands of the Ghafiree tribes, El Nedabaeen and Rahveem respectively, the third road being the Wady Beni Raweyheh. The W ady Akk is the principal and most traversed road, and is described as having a narrow precipitous defile capable of being held by a few resolute men against any number. Saleh bin Ali hearing that the Al W ahibeh had passed endeavoured to get through at night, but the Ghafirees were on the alert and he was compelled to retire. • ' On the 16th instant news arrived by a kafilah that the sound of guns and musketry had been heard at Semail, and it was feared that Saieh bin Ali had reached Semail and was on his way with two thousand or three thousand men to attack Muttra and Muscat. His High ness had no doubt, I believe, at the moment that such was the case, and began preparations for opposing them. ' JS T o confirmation of the rumour, however, was received during the day by letters from the Wali of Semail and.others, who would certainly have written to His Highness had it been true, and it was soon preceived that there was no foundation whatever for it. ' It turned out subsequently that Saleh bin Ali after his repulse by the Ghafirees at the Akk Pass had been deserted by nearly the whole of his following of Henavees, who had returned to their districts, aad that he had proceeded to the Beni Raweyeh with only a tew men. Here also he was able to effect nothing and soon returned disappointed to Ibra. The Al Wahibeh finding the state of affairs with Saleh returned to their country after having received a small present of $400 from Syud Toorkee. ' Saleh bin Ali has thus again signally failed in an attempt to attack and dispossess His Highness Syud Toorkee by a coalition of the Hinawee tribes against him, and as Saleh's ex penses in this effort are said to have amounted to about (| 1,500) one thousand and five hundred, he has merely weakened his own resources without gaining any result whatever. It is probable nevertheless that .Saleh is by no means discouraged at his ill success, and will continue to watch a fitting opportunity to rise again; his failure this time is chiefly attributed to his want of money or rather to his want of liberality in spending it.a Another probable cause of Saleh's ill success is the fact of his having-no one of the ruling family with him to put forward. He cannot claim the throne himself, and could only act m the name of one of the late Syud Saeed's children; Syud Toorkee's two rivals, Salim bin Ihoweynee and Abdool Azeez, are not in the country, and the only one whom Saleh has to his hand is Hanb, Salim's younger brother, who is at present in Jaalan. Harib is said to be a dull youth with an impediment in the speech and is incapable probably of ever coming forward as a claimant in person, but he might be used as a convenient tool by Saleh.' {Political A., October 1873.] About the same time Toorkee despatched Hamad bin Ahmed to negotiate on his behalf with the Beni Raweyeh and endeavour to bring them over to his allegiance. For some short time after this Oman was comparatively quiet and Major Miles, on the 5th September, thus reported the favorable termination of these negotiations :— ' Syud Hamid bin Ahmed returned to Muscat on the 1st instant, bringing with him Sheik Seif bin Hamad, Sheik Saleh Theneysh, Sheik Mahomed Nasir, Moolla Salim Odeyim, and Moolla Suliman Omeer, with about four hundred of the tribe. Since their arrival several conferences have taken place between them and His Highness, which have now terminated satisfactorily, the tribe, I understand, having declared their readiness to yield submission to Syud Toorkee and to refrain in future from hostile acts and coalition with his enemies on certain conditions being granted to them, the principal of which are (1) that they shall be forgiven the blood on their hands, particularly that of Syud Mahomed bin Saeed, Wullee of Burka, whom they murdered last year; (2) that part of the landed property, date, palms, &amp;c., of the late Khaleelee, shall be restored to his family; (3) that they shall receive the customary subsidies every year from His Highness; and (4) that the two Moollas, Salim bin Odeyim and Suliman Omeer, shall receive a regulai^stipulated allowance, all of which conditions have been acceded to by His Highness. ' Although this amicable arrangement with the powerful Beni Raweyeh will doubtless strengthen His Highness and serve as a considerable check upon Saleh bin Ali El Harithee, it remains to be seen how long it is likely to last, and whether the Ghafiree tribes will not be affronted at the understanding thus come to by His Highness with their natural enemies, the Henavees.' • Writing on the same date Major Miles reported that no further movements had taken place on the part of Saleh bin Ali, but that news had been received of Ibrahim bin Ghais having left El-Hazan and proceeded to the Batinah, which report caused Toorkee some disquietude. 263. Miscellaneous occurrences. —Major Miles also reported the following miscellaneous items of intelligence :— ' A short short time back a tribal dispute occurred between the tribes, Beni Rasib and Beni-bu-Hassan El Sharkujeh, which resulted in bloodshed. His Highness Syud Toorkee, however^ on hearing of the affair, and at the request of the parties sent an order for a truce for one year, which both parties have accepted and promised to observe. 'During his late expedition to the Batinah, His Highness Syud Toorkee became displeased with one of the Al-bu-Saide, Syud Hamid bin Hamed bin El Imam, at Burka, whom he discovered to have been carrying on a treasonable correspondence. Hamid was put into confinement and brought down here, where he has since been imprisoned in the Meranee Fort. A party of the El Maavali tribe have to-day arrived at Muscat with the object of in terceding with His Highness on Hamid's behalf. ' His Highness Syud Toorkee informed me, during a recent visit I paid him, of his approaching marriage with the daughter of Syud Hamed bin Salim, his cousin, and mentioned that it would probably take place shortly. His Highness is at present unmarried.' Toorkee's marriage with the daughter Political A-, November 1873, No. 19. of Hamed ^ ^ quently reported as having taken place. 264. Murder of Syud Thoweynee bin Mahomed.— On the 13th August Syud Thow6ynee bin Maho- * Political A., October 1873, Nos. 99-100. ^ Ex . Wuzeer of Toorkee, Was shot dead in Muscat and the murderer, who was a slave of the late Nasir bin Ali, escaped. 43This murder was regarded as a just retribution for the murder of Syud Nasir hm Ali Toorkee's former Wuzeer in April 1873 (see paragraph 232 of previous nrJcis), which the deceased was supposed to have instigated. Syud Thoweynee had the reputation of being Toorkee's evil genius. 265. Proceedings of Saleh bin Ali,* Chief of the Harithee, a.ft,pr Toorkee's return to Muscat from Sohar m August 1873.

Q n the 19tli September t Major Miles t Political A., November 1873, Xos. 16-20. wrote I— ' Sheikh Saleh-bin-Ali, El Harithee, has been endeavouring to strengthen himself by seek- inff a marriage with the daughter of Munsoor -bin-Nasir, Sheikh of the Al-Wahibi Bedouins. Sheikh Munsoor, however, before consenting referred to Syud Toorkee on the subject, who requested him to endeavour first to induce Sheikh Saleh bin Ali to visit His Highness at Muscat with a view to an amicable arrangement, or failing that to obtain in concert with the other Sheikhs of the tribe a solemn assurance from Saleh that he will remain quiet in future in his own country, and refrain from hostile demonstrations against His Highness' authority. « Sheikh Munsoor's answer was received this morning, and the letter which I have seen informs His Highness that Saleh bin Ali has agreed to an interview with him at Muscat, and that he will shortly proceed thither. Sheikh Munsoor in his letter also acknowledges the allegiance of his own tribe and that of the Beni Habaas to His Highness and expresses his ready obedience to his wishes. a rpjje Al Wahibi are Henavees and a very powerful tribe, and their conduct in this afPair seems significant of a change of feeling among the Henavee tribes of El-Sharkujah and of an intention on their part to join His Highness Syud Toorkee and yield submission to his authority/' „ Tranquillity prevailed for the next three months, but on the 19th January 1874 Major Miles telegraphed ^ that Saleh X Political A., March 1874, No. 20... ^ unex p ec tedly arrived with a force at Rui. He defeated Budr bin Seif and occupied Muttra. The crisis was a serious one. Major Miles telegraphed to the Political Hesident:— ' Saleh bin Ali's force arrived at Rui yesterday morning quite unexpectedly. Toorkee taken completely by surprise and unprepared to receive them. Budr bin Seif attacked Saleh's force near Rui yesterday but was defeated with 13 killed and had to retire to Muttra, whence he returned to Muscat in the evening. Saleh occupied Muttra during night. Saleh has Azzan's son with him, Ibrahim besieging Burka; have taken all available precautions for protection of British subjects; but they have been beaten and their shops plundered at Muttra. Toorkee weak and unable to rise from bed but able to direct operations. Saleh's advent caused by report reaching him of Toorkee's death. If Muscat can hold out two or three days aid will arrive from Soor. Syud Toorkee requests interference of Government. Respectfully submit Toorkee's claims to support, and solicit instructions as to what aid I may give him. Please despatch men of war at once. Your presence very desirable/' The Government of India on the 20th January directed Colonel Ross to proceed to Muscat and approved of his orders that the Nimhle should proceed at once from Ilenjam. It was added :— ' If another vessel available send it also to coast to cruise. You should demand satisfaction from rebel holders of Muttra for injury to British subjects after enquiry into facts. If refused bombard fort after 48 hours' notice. You have full powers to help Toorkee actively ro far as guns of vessels of war will reach and to protect British interests. Undertake no operations on shore.' The Political Resident arrived at Muscat on the 26th January and on the 1st of Pebruary telegraphed:— (C Rebels had already retired on receipt of a sum of money from Toorkee, whose position is not altered in anyway. All particulars will be submitted by post. There is no danger now and everywhere quiet. Sultan's health improving. One vessel of war will be required to remain here for present.' 4i4iOn the 2nd of February Colonel Ross telegraphed that his presence being no longer required at Muscat he was about to return to Bushire. He added that loorkee solicited 100 barrels of gunpowder from Governinent on payment This application was transferred to the Military Department by whom the necessary instructions for compliance were issued to the Bombay Marine Department. On the 9th February Colonel Hoss telegraphed that rumours existed at Muscat that Saleh bin Ali was again organizing an extensive rising in Sharkeyeh. Meanwhile the Philomel and Nimble were both at Muscat and the Rifleman at Jask. These rumours were reported on the 17th of February to be untrue. Everything was then quiet, the Nimble had gone to Bombay and the Philomel was leaving for the Gulf. On the 31st January 1874 Colonel Eoss reported in full detail the circumstances of the recent disturbances. Briefly they were as follows : False news of the death of Toorkee reached Sheikh Saleh bin Ali, and there is reason to believe that this was purposely communicated to him by a man named Shamin bin Hassan, one of Toorkee's retainers, but a known enemy of his. On receiving the news Sheikh Saleh bin Ali bringing with him Syud Hamood, the eldest son of Azan bin Ghais, a youth of 12 years of age. whom he intended to put forward as a puppet, started at once with a force 'of about 300 men for Muscat. On 17th January news was received that he had arrived at the village of Rui. Toorkee sent out a force to oppose him of 125 Wahabees. Toorkee's troops were overcome after an obstinate fight. On the night of the 17th January or the morning of the 18th Sheikh Saleh (who by that time must have known that the news of Toorkee's death was false) took possession of Muttra. A general plunder ensued and considerable loss was inflicted on the property of British subjects. Toorkee, whom the Political Agent found in a weak and despondent condition, asked for the support of Government, and the Political Agent assured him that his request should be made known. Toorkee also asked the Political Agent to write to Sheikh Saleh and require him to evacuate Muttra; but Major Miles did not feel himself authorized to take this step in the absence of a sufficient force to coerce Sheikh Saleh in the event of a refusal on his part to comply. On the 19th January a message was received by Toorkee from some of the rebels at Muttra, saying that they wished to come to terms and to apologize for - their conduct. After some negotiation an amicable arrangement was made by which Toorkee agreed to pardon the rebels and the rebels agreed that Muttra should be evacuated by them on receipt of 6,000 dollars and 100 bags of rice. The Political Agent endeavoured to induce Toorkee to prolong the negotiations pending the arrival of a British man-of-war feeling that the arrangement was an unwise one. In this he was unsuccessful and the terms' of the agreement were carried out on the 22nd January and Muttra was evacuated. The full conditions of the agreement between Saleh bin Ali and Toorkee were— ' 1^.—The confiscation and sales of property by Syud Azan bin Ghais, and now in the hands of the Harithee and Beni Raweyeh tribes, to be confirmed, ' %nd. —That all Khulelee's property shall be restored to his sons and families. ' Srd. —That the property of Hamad bin Suliman shall be restored in like manner. ' 4M.—Saleh'bin Ali is to undertake that Ibrahim bin Ghais shall not oppose Syud Toorkee in any way. . ' §t/i. —That Syud Toorkee shall not undertake hostile operations against Ibrahim bin Ghais. ' Qth. —The'followers of Saleh bin Ali in the present affair to be forgiven and not punished. ' 1th. —That Syud Toorkee shall not listen to evil and unfounded reports against Saleh bin Ali.' Thus ended Saleh's rising. Toorkee's behaviour was said to have been admirable, and although suffering from illness he continued throughout 45 m46 # to issue the necessary orders and direct tlie operations. The pioceedings of Colonel Ross and Major Miles during the disturbances were entirely approved by the Government of India. 266 Loss suffered by British subjects at Muttra. Imme- diatelv on hearin^ of the threatened attack on Muttra the Political Agent proceeded thither (on the 17th January), but found that there was not sufficient time to make special arrangements for the removal of the property of the Banians. He wrote to Sheikh Saleh, requesting him to respect British subjects and their property and holding him responsible for any loss. In the general plunder which 'ensued on the entry of the rebels into the town no icspect was shown to British subjects, Banians' and Khojas' shops being broken into and sacked. The Political Agent subsequently again proceeded to Muttra before its evacuation and personally requested an explanation from Sheikh Saleh. He at first denied that the traders had been plundered, but afterwards said that as he had now made peace with Toorkee and had been pardoned he could only hold himself accountable to him. He declined to make any reparation unless required to do so by the Sultan. Colonel Ross pointed out that there were three courses open to the Government of India— (1.) To hold Saleh still personally responsible, and take all practicable means to enforce redress from him or ..punish him. (2.) To hold Toorkee responsible and require him to make good the losses. (3.) To let the matter drop. The difficulty arose from the fact of Toorkee having pardoned Sheikh Saleh. Toorkee in a conversation with Colonel Ross said:— (1) 'that it would be unfair to make him (Toorkee) responsible; (2) ' that Saleh was the culprit and should be called upon for redress; (3) ' that he (Toorkee) was unable to enforce redress from Saleh; (4) ' that Government were at liberty to deal direct with Saleh so far as he (Toorkee) was concerned.' Regarding this the Foreign Secretary wrote :r- ' As regards compensation to our subjects, if Saleh were still in rebellion and in posses sion of Muttra, we might deal direct with him and force him to pay under threat of bom bardment, as we did the other day with Ibrahim at Sohar. But peace having been restored and the rebel pardoned we can only deal with i See 2i C t 0 o 0 23 d R0SS ' VieW t0 the C0Utrary m Toorkee whom we ought to hold responsible* and who cught to be required to pay out of the ad vance of half a yearns subsidy (20,000 crowns) just paid to him. Accompanied as the demand will be with the conferment of substantial favours Toorkee will see there is nothing hostile or unfriendly in it, but that it is merely what justice to our subjects requires/' His Excellency the Viceroy agreed, and the following instructions were issued accordiiigly;— ' Regarding the losses sustained by British subjects at Muttra, His Excellency in Council considers that peace having' been restored and Sheikh Saleh bin Ali pardoned, Syud Toorkee alone can be held responsible for the payment of compensation. On the conclusion of the investigations which are being made as to the exact extent of the losses, Syud Toorkee should be requested to pay the necessary compensation from the advance of half a year's subsidy which was sanctioned in the telegram from this Office, No. 463P. of 18th ultimo. ' Accompanied as the demand will be with the conferment of substantial favors. His Excellency in Council feels assured that Syud Toorkee will see that the property of British subjects having been plundered by rebels whom he has pardoned it is his duty to comply with it/' The total loss amounted t to $4,739, and on the 25th | June Colonel t Political A,.

Question of succession to the throne of Muscat in the event Of Toorkee's death.— On the 7th February Colonel Koss wrote:— It ma\ be perhaps proper for me to attract the attention of Government to the fact of there being no one person in Oman at present who, in the event of the Sultan's demise, would have a pre-eminent chance of succeeding to the Sultanate of Muscat. ' Many of the Henavee tribes, as represented by Saleh bin Ali, seem to be well disposed towards the branch of the. reigning family to which Azan bin Ghais belonged; and it is not improbable a vigorous effort would be made to bring in one of the members of that branch. ' Of the descendants of the Syud Saeed bin Sultan, I am of opinion that next to the present Sultan his brother Abdool Azeez would at present command most support in Oman. ' His Highness Syud Toorkee has not himself expressed any wish or opinion regarding the question of succession, and of course the subject has not been discussed.' [Political A.y May 1871, Nos. 19-31.] In reply Colonel Ross was informed that in the event of the death of Syud Toorkee, His Excellency in Council considered it undesirable that there should be any interference of any kind on the part of British officers in the choice of a successor. Before giving an account of the proceedings of Ibrahim bin Ghais I append one or two items of miscellaneous information. 268. Apprehended disturbances at Bunder Abbass.— In February accounts reached the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf that .the town of Bunder Abbass was in danger of being looted by Baharloo Arabs, the Governor, Ahmed Shah, having stated his inability to protect the town. Colonel Ross telegraphed the news to Mr. Thomson at Teheran, and requested the Captain of Her Majesty's Ship 'Philomel, which was then at Jask, to visit Bunder Abbass. • \FoUl. A, March 1874, Nos. 246-247.] 269. Complications between the Chiefs of Shargah and Ras-el-Khymah. —In September 1873 Major Grant, 1st Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf, visited the Oman Coast. Arriving at Aboothabee he found that the Chief of that place had marched to attack Shargah, the alleged cause of quarrel being an attack made by some Bedoos in alliance with Shargah on the Bedoos in alliance with Aboothabee. The quarrel was a trivial one and did not apparently result in loss of life. The Chief eff Ras-el-Khymah was also attack ed by Aboothabee, and both Shargah and Ras-el-Khymah moved reinforcements in boats along the coast. Major Grant, however, warned the Chief of Shargah that in sending armed men to sea both he and the Chief of Ras-el-Khymah had broken the maritime truce and that their conduct would be reported to Government. Colonel Ross wrote :— ' Such movements by sea have always been discountenanced by the Resident as likely to lead to warfare on the seas, and it was therefore proper on the part of Major Grant to warn the Chiefs as he did.' [Political A., December^ 1873, Nos. 3-3.] 270. Proceedings of the Beni Rujam tribe of Jabel Akh- dar. —On the 19th September 1873 Major Miles wrote :— ' His Highness the Sultan informs me that the Beni Rujam tribe of Jebel Akhdar have begun to show a somewhat turbulent and aggressive spirit of late. This tribe is ruled by two Sheiksh, brothers, Nasir and Suliman bin Seif bin Suliman, who are desirous of obtaining possession of certain property belonging, or said to belong, to them in Nezwa and Birket-el- Mong. They expect to gain both wealth and influence by a rising, and will probably create a disturbance before long. This tribe is Ghafiree, and does not receive any subsidy from His Highness.'

On the 18th* September 1873 Major Miles reported that Ibrahim had made an arrangement with Syud Eeysul ♦ Political a., november 1873, nos. 16 -20. Hamood by which the latter delivered up possession of the fort of El-Rostak on receiving from Ibrahim the sum of $2,200 and certain date groves. Major Miles added :— ' Ibrahim bin Ghais has now possession of the two principal forts in that part of the country, El -Rostak and El-Hazan, and he is constantly engaged, I understand, in gaming friends and influence. It is, however, not considered probable that he has any actively hostile intentions at present. I learn that on his recent visit to the Batinah Coast, he succeeded in coming to some understanding with the Sheikhs. ' Syud Feysul bin Hamood appears to have now retired altogether from public affairs, and it is said he intends to perform a pilgrimage to Mecca next year.' • On the 7th March 1874 Major Miles telegraphed that Ibrahim was raising the Batinalr Coast and actively besieging Mesnaah, and also that his oper ations were likely to prove extensive. Major Miles suggested that he should inform Ibrahim that he would be considered as acting hostilely against the British Government if he did not withdraw his force. Colonel Ross however proposed to instruct the Political Agent not to address Ibrahim in the above sense, but in case of Muscat being attacked to be guided by the general tenor of the recent orders of Government, in the case of Saleh bin Ali's attack (see paragraph 265), Colonel Ross considered it inexpedient to aid Toorkee actively on the Batinah Coast. In reply, the following telegram was on the 13th instant despatched to Colonel Ross:— ' Viceroy concurs that active assistance on Batinah Coast cannot be given to Toorkee, but Ibrahim may be told that as Toorkee is our ally his rebellious proceedings are viewed with displeasure •, and that he will be held responsible for injury caused to British subjects and will be required, if necessary, to make reparation. If Muscat is attacked, former instruction in Salens case will apply. If possible, third vessel will be sent to Gulf.' [Political A., March 1874, Nos. 307-316.] The Marine Department was also asked to make early arrangements for sending a third vessel to the Gulf in addition to the 'Philomel and Rifleman. On the 13th March Major Miles telegraphed that he had proceeded to Mesnaah in the Philomel accompanied by an officer of Toorkee's and two banians who had been plundered there. He found Ibrahim besieging the Eort with a large force, but a vigorous defpnee was opposed to him. He continued:— ' Informed Ibrahim and rebels that Government viewed rebellious hostility with dis pleasure, and requested explanation as to plunder of British subjects. Ibrahim replies evasively denying plunder by his men. Considerable property belonging to banians remained in fort, the necessity for prompt removal of which before fort succumbed to rebels was a principal reason for my not waiting for further orders; before starting on Tuesday, therefore valuables to extent of eleven thousand Rupees were removed from fort to Philomel. Being fully satisfied from banians^ depositions of justness of claims, I demanded satisfaction for losses amounting to dollars seven thousand five hundred, giving forty-eight hours for Ibrahim to come to arrangement. On Wednesday morning fort very unexpectedly gave out and rebels appeared taking possession. I considered it would not be politic, or in accordance with expressed views of Government, to allow it to be occupied by rebels until orders of Government were received and until satisfaction for losses had been made; therefore requested rebels to withdraw and not occupy. This was refused by Ibrahim, and after another warning, that if fort not evacuated, they would be dislodged by force, had been disregarded, they were shelled out of it. Ibrahim subsequently consented to pay damages if proved to be due by him, but he still 48denied his liability for them. He declared wish to depute some one on hoard to consult with me yesterday evening and a boat was sent but owing to heavy surf was unable to communi cate witli sboie. I considered it advisable to wait no longer without reporting proceeding and obtaining orders and left last night. Other claims by British subjects have now been received bringing up total losses to fourteen thousand two hundred and fifty dollars. One banian was killed by a shot during attack on town by rebels, though' apparently accidental. Ibrahim has declared intention of attacking Burkah and Soweik and of prosecuting hostilities against bul tan. On the 14th March the following telegram was despatched to Colonel Boss by the Government of India :— ' Miles' proceedings approved. Ibrahim should be warned that unless he gives full compensation to British subjects to such extent as Major Miles mav determine to be just he will be treated wherever found as enemy of British Government. As regards matters in which Toorkee only is concerned and interests of British subjects-are not immediately con cerned, Major Miles will be careful to get Toorkee's assent to his action. With this proviso and subject to the condition that no operations are to be undertaken on shore Major Miles should support Toorkee as far as giins from sea can reach as already directed/' On the 14th March Colonel Ross telegraphed :— ' I have instructed Major Miles on return to Muscat to take all possible precautions for safety of British subjects and property, and to detach, if requisite, one vessel to Batinah on this service, also to avoid actual hostilities, unless under circumstances clearly authorized by Viceroy's orders. In event of Ibrahim's failing to give redress it may be considered necessary to treat him as an enemy and to dislodge him from any positions he may occupy within reach of our vessels' guns. In case Government consider it necessary I shall be prepared to proceed to Muscat.' On the same date Colonel Ross forwarded by telegraph certain telegrams received from Major Miles. In these telegrams Major Miles asked for instruc tions as to whether he was to proceed personally to obtain reparation from Ibrahim for British losses, as he considered it impracticable to do so by corre spondence. Major Miles continued— ' In event of his not complying, what course is to be pursued, are Ibrahim's operations on Batinah Coast to continue and Mesnaah to be occupied by him until satisfaction given ? Have already warned British subjects at Soweik to remove property. Some property of banians still remains at Mesnaah and protection of vessel will be required in removing it.' Colonel Ross replied :— ' Use your discretion about returning straight to Muscat. Arrived there urge on Toorkee necessity for exertion on his part to repress rebellion. Pending further orders from Govern ment of India content yourself with making formal written demand for reparation on behalf of British subjects with intimation that if not complied with, Ibrahim will be liable to coercive measures, and sending ship of war to watch proceedings and aid British subjects as far as possible,' On the 16th March the Government of India telegraphed in reply to Colonel Ross:— ' Proceed yourself to Muscat. Instructions contained in my telegrams of 13th and 14th maintained.' On the 15th March Major Miles telegraphed that he had arrived at Muscat from ^Mesnaah, that Toorkee had not yet succeeded in organizing effective opposition to Ibrahim, and that if, as was not improbable, Burkah fell into Ibrahim's hands, Toorkee's position would be highly critical. Colonel Ross in forwarding this telegram on the 17th March added that he was on the point of proceeding to Muscat and proposed visiting the Batinah Coast en route. Colonel Ross arrived at Muscat on the 23rd after ascertaining on his way there that Ibrahim's followers still held Mesnaah. After consulting Toorkee he proceeded to Mesnaah accompanied by Major Miles, and assembled the Uifle- man, Philomel, and Hugh Rose. On the 31st March he telegraphed:— 'I ordered Ibrahim to evacuate the fort on twenty-seventh, and then requested the Senior Naval Officer to destroy the fort fortifications as far as practicable by fire of the guns of the squadron, and this was carried out. This measure, besides being necessary in support of pro ceedings already approved by Government, was expressly desired by Toorkee. Ihe operations 49 - N50 entailed no loss of life. In addition to this chastisement I havfe held Ibrahim and allies, the lal Sa id fully responsible for the claims of British subjects, giving the full warning authorized by Government The Sultan is undertaking negotiations, but I have enjoined him not to pardon the offenders until British claims are satisfied. At present the rebellion has collapsed, and Toorke' has no apprehension and requires no present active assistance; he fully appreciates the support so opportunely accorded. Major Miles will watch proceedings m reference to claims for compensation andreport, but at present no further active measures are contemplated. ' If possible I beg May Frere or another Bombay Marine vessel may be temporarily placed at Muscat. I shall leave one man-of-war with Major Miles, and purpose proceeding back to Gulf returning later if necessary.' On the 2nd April the Government of India telegraphed approval of Colonel Ross' proceedings, and the Marine Department were asked to make im mediate arrangements to place the May Frere ov another vessel of the Bombay Marine at the temporary disposal of the Political Resideflt in the lersian Gulf • at Muscat. On the 5th ^Ipril Colonel Ross telegraphed ' Mesnaah, M.—Communicated with Ibrahim bin Ghais to-day. He requested ten days' time to consult with Chiefs of Yal Saad about payment of compensation. I have allowed this and required him to refrain from any operations against Sultan's ports.' His action was approved by the Government of India. 272. Detailed* reports of the rising in the Batinah — On the morning of the 6th March news • Political a .. June 1874. Nos. 252 -277. cached Toorkee that Ibrahim had ap peared the previous day before the town of Mesnaah with a small force. He immediately attacked the town, but was repulsed. The Wullee of Burkah, on hearing of the event, immediately despatched 50 men to succour the fort, and the Wullee of Mesnaah Ham id bin Hamad, who was then in Muscat, set olf at once to return to his post. On the night following his repulse again attacked the fort and succeeded in taking the towii or bazaar which is surrounded by a wall conti guous to one side of the fort. Having been joined by fresh numbers he was enabled to hem in the fort on all sides and entirely cut off its communication. The Wullee Hamid bin Hamad therefore on reaching Burkah found himself unable to enter Mesnaah or to succour'it in any way. Major Miles Was on the night of the 7th of March informed by two principal banian traders of Mesnaah, who had arrived in Muscat, that during the day between Ibrahim's first and second attack they had managed to remove the bulk of tlieir property to the inside of the fort and deposit it with the Wullce for security, but that all their goods remaining in their houses in the bazaar taken by Ibrahim had been plundered. These men also represented Ibrahim's force as amounting to at least 1,000 men of the Yal Saad, by the most nuiherous Hinavee tribe in the Batinah, and it was stated that Ibrahim's force were increasing. Hearing of the danger to British subjects. Major Miles left Muscat at once for Mesnaah. The position was a critical one as Burkah is the key of Muscat. Ibrahim bin Ghais too was something more than a mere adventurer; being an ambitious and formidable rival, and a man who, if he once found the tide turningjn his favor, would neglect no means of pushing his fortune to the utmost. Before leaving Muscat Major Miles visited Toorkee and procured his full approval and consent to his visiting Mesnaah. Toorkee moreover deputed his Wahabee Jemadar, Ibrahim El-Awere, to accompany Major Miles. On arriving at Mes naah on the 9th March in Her Majesty's Philomel, Major Miles found the fort surrounded and briskly besieged by the rebels. He at once wrote the following letter to Ibrahim :— become known to me that you have advanced on Mesnaah in rebellious hosti- ity to His Highness the Sultan Syud Toorkee, who is the friend of the British Government, and moieo\er that you have plundered the houses and property of banians and other British »u jects. I therefore inform you that you are held responsible for all losses and injuries sustained by them through your proceedings, and that I require an explanation and satisfaction51 h% To which Ibrahim replied :— £f I have received your letter, and its contents understood. We have not made aggression on our brother, Syud Toorkee, by hostilities. Our advance on Mesnaah is merely through what has happened between us from old. We have not commenced any new quarrel. And abo'ut the plundering of the banians' houses and property, know that we have not damaged or caused the least injury to your subjects or their property; the loss has been caused by those in the fort. You can ask your subjects whether I have not myself protected their property, and this is because they are your dependants and on account of the greatness of the British Gov ernment, and you and we are one.' Major Miles again addressed the following letter to Ibrahim on the 10th March:— ' Your letter has been received, and with regard to your remarks as to the rebellious attitude assumed by you against His Highness the Sultan Syud Toorkee, I have to inform you that your hostile proceedings cannot be countenanced, but that they are viewed with displeasure by the British Government. • 'Secondly. —Your explanations with regard to the plunder of banian's houses are unsatis factory and cannot be accepted, as these banians have undoubtedly been plundered by your men and not by those in the fort, I therefore hereby require that some arrangement be come to con cerning the losses sustained by them and amounting to about Dollars seven thousand and five hundred within two days from this time, failing which you will be considered as an enemy of the British Government and treated accordingly. 'Thirdly. —I inform you that there is property within the fort belonging to British subjects, and I intend to remove this to the ship at 3 p.m . to-day, I therefore require you to withdraw your men one mile from the shore for the purpose of allowing this to be done peaceably, and I request an immediate answer from you as to whether you intend to withdraw your men or not, as in the event of ydur declining to do so the shore will be cleared by the guns of the ship. The boat taking this will wait one hour for your answer. ' Fourthly. —I inform you that yesterday the boats conveying my letter to you were fired upon by your men, and I require an explanation and apology from you for this outrage on the British flag*.' To which he received the following reply on the same day :— ' Your letter has been received, and I have understood what is in it about the banians' houses and about their property; we have not interfered with them in any way, because they are the subjects of the great Government. Ask themselves if they say we took their property, they shall have satisfaction out of respect to the Government, and nothing shall remain due to them, and if it becomes plain that others did this, then you are the judges. ' Our intention never is to plunder your subjects, and concerning ourselves and our brother Toorkee bin Saeed, this is an old matter between us and was also between our ancestors; and with regard to your landing at the fort and removing thence the banians' property there is no objection. You are not forbidden the country. Whatever yoti wish to take out belong ing to the banyans it is in your hands to do as you wish, and no one among us will offer any resistance to you in this, and we will place some one on our behalf that no one shall interfere with; you and we are One. And for all of your subjects there is respect and honor. And about the firing on your boats yesterday, this was done by ignorant and stupid men, and no account should be taken of them, because they did not know that you were lauding, but thought that it was some of Syud Tooi-kee's men in the ship, and when it was known that it was your ship we ordered our men not to interfere with you. You can land whenever you. please and no one shall offer any hindrance to you whatever.' The property in the fort was, with the exception of a few bales of cotton, safely removed on board the ^Philomel. On the morning of the 12th Major Miles perceived signs of the garrison being about to surrender, and he accordingly addressed the following letter to Ibrahim:— ' I observe this morning that there are indications of your taking possession of the fort, and it is therefore my duty to inform you that as Government do not countenance your pro ceedings you cannot be allowed to hold the fort until the orders of Government Lave been received. I therefore require you to desist ani withdraw from the fort at once if in youi possession, otherwise it will be necessary for me, to dislodge you by force. And some of the property of the banians is still in the fort, for which 1 must hold you responsible.'Ibrahim replied that the fort had surrendered to him spontaneously. Matters were getting serious and on the 1,2th March Major Miles ordered Ibra him to withdraw in 'the following decided letter:— ' I am unable to consent that you should retain possession of the fort until orders are received, and 1 therefore require you to evacuate it by 2 p.m . to-day. Half an hour before that time a signal gun will be fired, and if in the meantime you do not intimate to me your intention of leaving, you will be dislodged by the g-uns. Should you desire, however, a personal interview on this matter there is safety and protection for you to come and return. ' And with regard to the plunder of the British subjects, the banians are present on board, and I am fully satisfied that their losses have been occasioned by your men, and the time given you for making restitution will expire to-morrow at noon. It has also at this time come to my knowledge that a banian was killed during your attack on the bazaar. This is a most serious matter and will have to be submitted for the consideration and orders of Government. • ' I trust you will be wise in both these matters and comply with my requests, and not compel me to act with hostility towards you; and as regards the evacuation of the fort, this letter must be. considered as final.' No answer was returned to this letter within the time allowed, hut a flag was hoisted in the fort as if in defiance. After a certain amount of law had been allowed, Major Miles requested Captain Garforth to dislodge the rebels, and five or six shots were fired which had the desired effect, and the fort was at once cleared. About two hours a letter was received from Ibrahim offering to make reparation for losses to Brtish subjects, provided he was allowed to make enquiries and satisfy himself as to the justness of the claims. To this Major Miles agreed, adding that he would afford him every facility. On the 12th of March Major Miles left Mesnaah arriving at Muscat on the 15th. He found that Toorkee had summoned some of the tribes to his assist ance, intending, when he had gathered together a sufficient force, to proceed in person to Burkah against Ibrahim. The tribes began to collect rapidly at Muscat, but as they were mostly Hinavees it was very doubtful if much depen dence could be placed upon them in operating against Ibrahim. Meanwhile, while Toorkee was hesitating at Muscat, Ibrahim turned his attention.to Soweik. Preparations were made by the inhabitants for resistance, and the British subjects having been warned by Major Miles to withdraw removed their property. On the 17th March Colonel Boss, in accordance with telegraphic instructions received from the Government j^f India, proceeded to Muscat in the Hugh Rose. He called at Burkah, which fort he found still held by Toorkee's adherents, but Mesnaah was in the hands of Ibrahim, who had left a garrison of his own men there. Colonel Ross arrived at Muscat on the 23rd March and found H. M. S. Rifleman and Vhilomel there. He had an interview with Toorkee which he thus described :— '' I found His Highness reassured to a considerable extent by the assurance of the support of Government, which Major Miles had been empowered to convey. His Highness was, however, by no means free from anxiety, chiefly caused by his dread of treachery amongst his otc n declared adherents. Under the circumstances. His Highness did not feel it expedient to attack the enemy on the Batinah, and believing there was much cause for his distrust of the Hinavees, I refrained from urging His Highness to proceed against the rebels. It was His Highness opinion that immediate danger from the late rebellion had passed, and that dis sensions had occurred between Ibrahim bin Ghais and his allies, the Yal Saad. Major Miles' operations at Mesnaah probably conduced to this. His Highness' plan was now to depute the Chief ot the At Wahibeh tribe, Hameyd bin Khalefeen, to the Batinah to effect an arrange ment with the rebels by negotiation. ti ■. • p ro peeded to consult with His Highness regarding the exaction ot reparation from jralum ami his followers on account of the plunder of British subjects at Mesnaah. His i ^ T+i cc J nsi ^ er ^ ^t the \ al Saad tribe should be held responsible equally with Ibrahim, n ae ie a t ier bad risen solely at their invitation, and they were the persons amongst whom ic spoi la &gt;een shared. I then asked His Highness if he would take active steps by land to obtain the redress we demanded, offering to co-operate with the ships. His Highness was 0 ^ c effect of negotiation as before stated, and informed me that he would ma -. ie pay men o the required compensation the first and essential condition of peace with 52the offenders. I earnestly desired His Hig-hness not to come to terms to the exclusion of our demands, and to instruct his agents on the Batinah Coast to that effect. His Highness was himself well aware of the necessity for this caution. ' I then explained to His Highness the position of affairs as regarded the proceedings of Ibrahim at Mesnaah, to which place I was about to proceed with a naval force. I ascertained that His Highness was highly desirous of the destruction of that fort, and considered that measure would strengthen his policy and add to his influence. His Highness' view is that the existence of such forts on the Batinah, where disaffection always lurks, is one chief cause of the frequent rebellions and risings in that part of his dominions. As the sea-port of Rostak, also, it would always be coveted and.probably held against His Highness by Ibrahim or others of the rival branch of His Highness' family.' . On. the same day (March 23rd) Colonel Ross wrote to Ibrahim renewing the demands for compensation, and informing him that he was about to proceed to Mesnaah. Colonel Ross accompanied by Major Miles arrived at Mesnaah on the 26th March in the Hugh Hose, and on arrival found that H. M. S. Rifleman and Philomel had arrived there on the previous day. Negotiations were commenced with Ibrahim, but without effect, and on the 27th Colonel Ross considered it advisable to address Ibrahim requesting him to withdraw his men. from Mesnaah by one o'clock of that day, informing him of his resolve to destroy the fort, irrespective of the pecuniary demands on account of the plunder of British subjects. This course of action Colonel Ross considered absolutely necessary, to prevent a recurrence of the defiant proceedings of the rebels in re-occupying the fort after Major Miles' departure on the 12th March; secondly, because the opportunity was an excellent one for furthering the policy of Sultan and strengthening his position; and thirdly, because a practical exhibition of power and force was indispensably requisite on account of the repeated instance of outrages com mitted on British subjects. At noon on the 27th of March the fort was completely evacuated and a bombardment followed, which after a couple of hours resulted in so far dismant ling the fort as to render it untenable. After an interval of 24 hours Colonel Ross returned to Muscat accompanied by Major Miles leaving II. M. S. JPhilomel before Mesnaah. On the 29th Colonel Ross had an interview with Toorkee, who naturally expressed himself extremely pleased with what had been done. Meantime Toorkee, in order to bring about a reconciliation, accepted the offer made by Mahomed bin Seleyim, the Chief Metowa or religious leader in the Batinah, to mediate between His Highn ss and Ibrahim. These negoti ations were entirely fruitless, as IbraMm's party insisted (1) that Toorkee should pay the compensation for the plunder of the British subjects; (2) that he should fix a pension for Ibrahim; (3) that he should allow Ibrahim to return and reside at Rostak; and (4) that Mesnaah should not be occupied by either of the opposite factions. On the 4th of April Toorkee received a letter from the Wullee of Burkah stating that Ibrahim had left Mesnaah and was on his way to attack Burkah. Toorkee immediately proceeded thither ivith 100 ^ Wahabees on his corvette the Rahmanee, having previously directed Hamed bin Khalifeen to co-operate by land. Toorkee, however, on arriving at Burkah found that the report was untrue, and that Ibrahim was still at Mesnaah. ith the view of recommencing negotiations with him, he despatched llamed bin Khalifeen to Mesnaah/ The results of these negotiations were not satisfactory. Ibrahim adhered generally to the conditions previously proposed by him with the exception that he offered to pay halt the indemnity ot $15,000 on account of compensation to British subjects instead of requiring Toorkee to pay the whole of it. Toorkee returned to Muscat on the 18th April, having left affairs in the Batinah in statu quo. On the 16th May Major Miles reported that Ibiahim had returned to El-Rostak and did not appear to contemplate any new move ment for the present. The Yal Saad tribe, who were the supporters of Ibrahim, had made a raid in Soweik, but met with a repulse. A fresh attack was expected and Toorkee despatched on the 14th of May a reinforcement of Wahabees to the Wullee's assistance. Meanwhile negotiations by Toorkee were attempted with the Yal Saad, but without success, as the terms offered were not such as Toorkee considered that he could with honor accept.273 Attack made by the Yal Saad on Soweik. The Yal Saad ^ . • • 1 t &gt; •-! i. p ora : an finif dated continued * their attacks on Soweik, and at * From Political Resident, Persian Crult, datea y • at - i / j xi 12th June 187-4, No. 761155. the end of May Major Miles reported that the place was closely infested by two clans of that tribe. Endeavours were made by Toorkee to effect a reconciliation with the Yal Saad, but without success. Major Miles wrote on the 24th May: ' He (i e Toorkee) is no doubt anxious to conclude negotiations with the Yal Saad, and would, I believe,'be glad if our operations against that tribe to compel payment of the indemnity were commenced without much delay/' The two conditions in which Toorkee professed to insist as absolutely necessary to any negotiation were (1) that the demands of the British Government should be complied with, and (2) that the fort at Mesnaah should be restored. On the 6th June Major Miles telegraphed to Colonel Ross that the Yal From Political Resident, Persian Gulf, dated 12th Saad had captured and plundered with June 1874, No. 765-159. bazar at Soweik, also that Toorkee had solicited the support of Government, and requested him to require the rebels to withdraw. Major Miles therefore left Muscat for Soweik in the Magpie, accompanied by one of Toorkee's officers deputed by His ^ Highness for that purpose, and on arrival there found the position of affairs despepate. He called upon the rebels to desist from hostilities at once and withdraw from the vicinity. At first they demurred, but afterwards marched off. The Magie remained at Soweik until the 10th of June leaving the town and bazar in the posses sion of the Commandant of the Tort and without any apparent sign of the rebels. No loss or injury occurred to British interests from the temporary possession of the bazar by the insurgents, as all the banians and other Indian subjects had been, by the orders of Major Miles, removed from Soweik some time previously. Mean time Toorkee (so Major Miles telegraphed to Colonel Boss) made no special pre parations for co-operation by land, the probable reason being the want of funds. On the 9th June Major Miles, then at Jask, telegraphed to Colonel Boss that Toorkee was much more inclined to temporize and negotiate with the rebels than to use force. He said :— 'Yours of to-day. Syud Toorkee was very anxious that we should act against Yal Saad as stated in my telegram of 5th, and he doubtless has reasons. He is much more inclined to temporize and negotiate with rebels about his own affairs than to use force, and he will require to be urged to co-operate with us at all by land whether we act sooner or later. He is as much prepared now as he is likely to be without pressing. I have no reasons of my own for hasten ing or delaying operations as originally planned, A&gt;ut it might be advisable to meet Toorkee's desire on the subject. I am anxious to return Muscat to catch Mail Steamer, but will wait at Jask till to-morrow morning to receive your instructions.' Meanwhile, on the 6th June, Colonel Boss reported by telegraph to the Government of India Major Miles' proceedings at Soweik. On the 10th of J une the Government of India enquired by telegram what prospect Toorkee had of maintaining his rule, to which on the 11th of June Colonel Boss replied:— 'There is no special danger at present to the Sultanas rule. With continuous support of Government, he may remain as now for an indefinite period. But he is relying chiefly on that support and on the effect thereof upon Arabs. His hold of power is generally insecure, and would not be lasting long if British aid withdrew.' [Poltl. A., June 187^, Nos. 269-270.] Colonel Ross was on the 13th June directed by telegram to continue to act ' You have full powers to lielp Toorkee actively so ! U re S a . rd t0 Support of Toorkee, aCCOrd- far as guns of vessels of war will reach and to pro- lUg tO instructions in telegram dated 20th (shore.' ltlh ^ interes ' t5 L ' di 'ak e no operations on January last which were given in the case of Saleh bin Ali (see paragraph 265 ante). [PoUL A., March 1874, No. 207.] Compensation on account of plunder of British ' S Mesnaah. —Colonel Boss writing on the 1st of April, after the om aidment of Mesnaah, expressed his opinion that it would be advisable to 5455 awaxt the result of ioorkee s negotiations, which were to include a demand for satisfaction of British claims before taking measures to demand bequest of com pensation the amount oi which had been fixed at $15,000. Previous enquiries haying established beyond a doubt that theYal Saadwho formed the main body of the insurgents were the chief culprits and support of Ibrahim, Colonel Ross lound it necessary to hold that tribe responsible conjointlv with Ibrahim for the payment of this amount, and he addressed the tribe accordingly. On the 1st of April Colonel Ross accompanied by Major Miles proceeded from Muscat to Mesnaah m the Hugh Hose in view ot affording Ibrahim and his adherents an opportunity of communicating with him regarding the payment of the claims for compensation. The result of these communications was that Colonel Ross on the 2nd of April agreed to allow Ibrahim and the Yal Saad ten days to arrange tor payment. Colonel Ross added in communicating this decision to Ibrahim :~ ' If at the end of 10 days you have not arranged to satisfy our demands, further active steps must be taken by us, so I trust you and all concerned will have wisdom to see it is vour interest to comply.' •' Colonel Koss also required him to refrain from any operations against Toorkee. ^ On the 15th of April Ibrahim wrote to Major Miles declaring on behalf ot himself and the \ al Saad that it was not possible to arrange for payment of the full compensation, but that he would endeavour to pay part of the amount but this request was refused by Major Miles. [ Political A., June 1874, No*. 252-9 77.] In lepoiting these proceedings Major Miles forwarded the followin 0 ' memo randum on the subject • The time granted to Syud Ibrahim and the rebel tribes allied with him in which to make reparation for injuries sustained by. British subjects at their hands during the attack on Mesnaah having expired, it is desirable to sketch the position of affairs with reference to the practicability of coercing the rebel Arabs and exacting the reparation which they have refused to give. ' The principal tribe which co-operated with Syud Ibrahim in his attack on the fort of Mesnaah and was actually engaged in the plunder of British subjects was the Yal Saad, which is probably the most numerous tribe in the whole principality of Oman and by far the'largest in the Batinah, approximating ten thousand men. There were also a few of the El Hidadebeh. Yal Khamis, and El Ghawarib concerned in the movement. It is believed that Syud Ibrahim bin Ghais endeavoured to protect the banians from plunder by his men as much as possible, but his efforts were unavailing. As the leader of the enterprise however he is of course responsible with the \ al Saad in the matter. The \ al Saad in spite of their numbers have no great reputation in warfare and consequently have not so much influence politically as they otherwise naturally would have. They are, however, not averse to a little plunder when it can be easily obtained. They are held to be a very wealthy tribe, being chiefly engaged in the cultivation of their extensive date groves, the produce of which is largely exported, mostly in their own vessels, to the ports of the Persian Gulf, Mekran, and Yemen. The largest town belonging to them, and indeed in the Batinah, is Muhidda, which is situate about miles from the sea behind Shirs. It is strongly walled, but without bastions, and has a few small guns mounted on it. These fortifi cations were erected in 1861 after the severe punishment inflicted on this tribe by the Sultan Syud Thoweynee. Other towns possessed by the Yal Saad inland are Tureef, Soor Thurmud. and Soor Girat, and on the shore Wadam, El Khadhra, and Soor Wilad, El Heyiz. Their prin cipal port is Wadam (including a nearly contiguous walled bazar called Soor El Makanceat), where they carry on cheir trade and in which are their godowns containing valuable property. ' ' The habitable part of the Batinah is along the whole shore of it from Heyl to Khor Fakan, and does not extend more than from two to five miles from the sea. ' The Batinah thus presents a thickly peopled and continuous belt of palm trees, forts, villages, gardens, and cultivation for upwards of one hundred and fifty miles, the interior being barren and hilly and covered with their acacia jungle. The tribe Yal Saad extend about twenty-five miles along this coast. ' It will thus be seen that there is no part of Arabia more vulnerable from the sea than the Batinah Coast, and that the offending tribes in this instance are peculiarly accessible to us. Should, therefore, they continue to refuse compliance with just demands, and should it conse quently be deemed necessary to undertake operations against them, I would respectfully sug gest that in the first place, after due warning, the fort and bazars of Wadam and Khadhra''should be bombarded and destroyed, and all craft found within ih* limits of the Yal Saad should be confiscated or burnt. Should these measures prove ineffective it would be necessary to blockade that part of the coast until the tribe submitted. a j I1 or (Jer to carry out these operations effectually I consider that two men of war would be necessary. It would be very advisable, I submit, to commence active measures against these tribes at oiice and bring them to compliance if possible before the hot weather sets in, as the maintenance of a blockade during that. season would probably be extremely irksome to Royal Navy vessels/' Colonel Ross in forwarding this on the 2nd May wrote:— k Q ne reaS o]i for holding the Yal Saad tribe responsible conjointly with their leader Ibra him was that, whilst Ibrahim's position is such that he can at pleasure withdraw to Rostak, where he is inaccessible as far as naval force is concerned, he has no property on the sea-coast, and consequently we have no means without co-operation of a land force of coercing him. The Yal Saad tribe, as will be seen from a perusal of Major Miles' able report, are to a great extent open to coercion from the seaward. There is no injustice in suiting own convenience by acting against them rather than Ibrahim, because they were in reality the culprits far more to blame'I believe than their leader Ibrahim. They were made fully to understand that we reserved the option of enforcing the whole demand either, from Ibrahim or from the tribe. ' Payment not having been made in the required time, both Ibrahim bin Ghais and the Yal Saad tribe are, in accordance with the declarations 1 have issued to them, in the position of enemies of the British Government and liable to treatment as such without further warning. ' I respectfully submit to Government that further active measures will (unless speedy satisfaction is given) be highly necessary. This granted it remains only to consider the nature and extent of the operations to be undertaken, the time w^hich shoul'd be fixed for carrying them into execution, and the force to be employed. &lt;f As to the first question, I am of opinion that it should be decided to act against the Yal Saad with a naval force with or without co-operation by land on the part of His Highness the Sultan as circumstances may determine. The suggestions made by Major Miles are, I think, good, viz., that the forts of Wadam and Khadhra should in the first place suffer .bombardment and be destroyed, and all vessels of the Yal Saad confiscated or burnt, and their coast blockaded, ' As to the time for these proposed operations there does not seem any urgent reason for immediate action, whilst I see reasons in favor of some delay. Such serious steps should, when possible, be well considered beforehand and be well concerted in order to ensure success. At the present time hostilities w r ould be less grievously felt by the Yal Saad tribe than they would be, say, two months later, both because of their harvest time, and because their boats are away now. For these reasons His Highness Syud Toorkee has recommended delay. Another con sideration is that just now His Highness is utterly unable to co-operate by land if required to do so; whilst there is at least a possibility that measures now contemplated may give a favour able turn to His Highness' affairs, and that a few months hence His Highness might be able to take advantage of the opportunity to strike a blow. Further, I am induced to think that this matter impending over, the hostile faction will give time for Syud Toorkee to seek means of strengthening his Government. It is only the late operations at Mesnaah and the dread of what is still to come that prevented Ibrahim and his adherents taking advantage of Syud Toorkee's present weak and isolated position. For all these reasons, and most especially in order that full time may be ensured for the consideration of the subject and for the issue of such orders as may be deemed necessary for His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor- General in Council, it seems to be desirable to reserve action a little. ' I concur with Major Miles in thinking that at least two vessels of the Royal Navy would be required. The Philomel and Rifleman are now on the Gulf Station, but I under stand the latter vessel is anxious to refit and obtain change for the crew. For operations to be complete a force of His Highness the Sultan should decidedly co-operate on shore in the opera tions sketched, but at present it is quite doubtful if His Highness will be able to assist in this way. ' I have deemed this matter of such importance that it is highly desirable Government should have the full report before them before any further steps are taken, and unless on emer gency I shall await such orders as His Excellency the Viceroy may be pleased to give me. 'In conclusion, I must state that whilst thinking it necessary to forward this report without delay, 1 have a strong impression that Ibrahim bin Ghais and bis friends will collect and pay the amount demanded before we commence to act against them. If they really mean to strike \ igorously for possession of Muscat, such payment will be the first step towards it.' On the 11th May Major Miles reported that Ibrahim had asked for a i art her delay oi some months in order to collect and pay in the amount of com pensation. Major Miles replied to he had no authority to grant any extension of time, and suggested that he should communicate w T ith Colonel Ross. 56On the 1st June Colonel Eoss telegraphed that he considered the time had come for coercive measures against the Yal Saad, and again on the 9th June telegi apnea that Ibraliim liad proposed to pay the indemnity by yearly instalments, and that the Tal Saad had declared Ibrahim to he responsible Colonel iloss added— ' I consider neither the offer of Ibrahim nor the excuse of the Yal Saad should be accepted/' TV ith reference to these telegrams, the following instructions were issued to the Resident on the 10th June :— ' Report reasons for refusing to accept indemnity from Ibrahim bin Ghais by yearly instalments or in reasonable periods. Do not bombard or make armed reprisals on account of indemnity until further orders.' To which the Resident replied on the 11th :— 'If Ibrahim's proposals for settlement of claims were accepted, it would relieve the Yal Saad rebels of further responsibility, and they would escape necessity of making reparation. 1 his tribe were the actual plunderers and should, I consider, be made to disgorge or to suffer some severity of procedure as I think necessary, otherwise similar losses to British subjects may frequently occurIf such delay as Ibrahim suggests were granted, it is improbable the claims would ever be paid, as unless with contribution from Yal Saad, Ibrahim have no means to pay, and unless pressed by us \ al Saad will not contribute. I shall be most careful to take no active steps until further orders, and shall defer proceeding to Muscat, but I am convinced strong measures would be most appropriate in this case.' On the 13th, the Government of India replied :— ' As you are convinced that strong measures are needed, they may be carried out to the extent of enforcing any terms that you judge reasonable and necessary. Viceroy would be glad if fair indemnity could be arranged without resort to extreme reprisals.' Thus the matter stands at present. Major Miles has warned Ibrahim and the Sheikhs of the Yal Saad that Political Resident's No. 760-154, dated 12th June they are liable to be attacked by us without 1874 ' further warning. Meanwhile the Govern ment of India are awaiting a report which Colonel Ross has promised to furnish after personal consultation with Syud Toorkee :— ' With regard to the indemnity to be recovered from Ibrahim bin Ghais and his adherents, I am proceeding to Muscat to confer with His Highness the Sultan and Major Miles on that and other subjects, and I shall endeavour to procure a satisfactory arrangement of that matter in accordance with the instructions and wishes of His Excellency the Viceroy conveyed in your telegram of the 13th June.'

ABDOOL AZEEZ'S EETUEN TO MUSCAT IN MAY 1874. 275 Toorkee's desire for the return of Abdool Azeez. Views of Colonel Ross and Major Miles on the subject Gov ernment of India sanction his return .—On the 6th March Major Miles wrote:— , ^ ' His Hio-hness the Sultan Syud Toorkee did me the honor to pay me a visit on the 3rd instant He said he had come to speak with me about abdicating the Sultanate of Oman and retiring to G wadur, where he could reside in peace, as he felt unable to cope with his enemies any longer. His Highness said that it was not a year yet since Sir B Irere had visited him, and he had since disbursed 1,50,000 Dollars in subsidizing his people, but that instead of being prateful they had only become more insubordinate and rapacious than ever, and he was greatly mortified and discouraged at their conduct towards him. He would show me the list given to hi. brother, Svud Thoweynee, by his father, Syud Saeed, when he went to Zanzibar, and I should see how enormously the subsidies to be paid to the various tribes had been increased by himself. His Highness added that even the Ghafirees were now setting themselves m opposi tion to him, and were talking now of setting up the sons of Jubber. Saleh bin Ah too, not withstanding his protestations to the contrary, was meditating another rising. 'In reply, I endeavoured to reassure and encourage His Highness by saying that as he was aware Government had decided to give him active support against rebels, that he had their fullest sympathy; and I was sure they would be greatly concerned to hear the view he took of his position. I also pointed out that the two rivals of his own family, Syud Abdool Azeez and Syud Salim, were now out of the way and disposed of, and that I was not aware there were any fresh grounds for serious apprehension at present. His Highness said he would wait and see what course events took, and that he would recur to the subject on another occasion. ' The following day I paid a visit to His Highness, and recurring to the subject of his political position with reference to internal dissensions, I mentioned how extremely advantageous it would be for him to appoint some trustworthy and responsible person as \ izier under present circumstances, as in bearing the whole weight of the administration he was undertaking a task beyond his powers, especially in his present weak state oi health. I pointed out too, with regard to the exorbitant subsidies demanded by the tribes, how much more easily and effectually a skilful Minister could check and diminish these expenses than His Highness, who was too ready to yield to the Arab's exactions. I further took the occasion to remind His Highness of the advice tendered by you to him on the same subject during your recent visit here. His Highness informed me that he depended a good deal on the advice and counsel of one Ibrahim el Aiwese, the Wahabee Jemadar, and that he considered him an able man. He added also that he felt the weight of what I bad said, as he was sure I was advising him for his good, and that he would consider seriously of it. ' My reasons for tendering this advice to His Highness were the knowledge that he is surrounded by men who are incapable of giving him sound and judicious advice with the^ excep tion perhaps of this man Ibrahim, and the opinion also'that His Highness does not sufliciently take into counsel the leading and most influential men in Muscat, viz., his own relatives. These personages are not, I believe, very well inclined to His Highness, but still there is no doubt that a more intimate communication with them would go far to reconcile them and their party, and His Highness^ influence would certainly not be decreased thereby. I feel convinced moreover that an able and influential Minister would at the present time without difficulty be able so to conciliate and pacify rival factions as to turn the tide in Syud Toorkee's favour, and that these internal dissensions and harassing demonstrations would be at an end. For it is cer tain that the country has never had a more considerate and openhanded ruler than the present Sultan, and there are no real grievances whatever to complain of.' On the 16th April Toorkee thus wrote in the following terms to Major Miles:— ' ' It is not kept from you that as before Informed, my friend, Colonel Ross, has been always advising and urging.me to allow the presence of Syud Abdool Azeez, and saying that you would reconcile us to each other, and that he should be under my orders and be my General, and I have always been thinking of this, and I now see that your views are correct in this matter, especially in these days when I am not in good health, and am powerless against the opposite party, and our (rovernment is now in want of his presence it' you will stand security for him in his doings, and that he should listen to the advice of both of us (British Government and Toorkee) and not to the ill-disposed. And my request is that you should write for his presence, and I shall be to him as is my custom.'59 On the 17th April Major Miles wrote regarding this letter:— ' The Sultan's last letter to me was received this morning'. In it His Highness states that he has come to, the conclusion that it would be best to recall his brother, Syud Abdool Azeez, from Kurraohee, and associate him with himself in the government of the country, as he feels powerless to stand alone any longer. His Highness appears to be under some misapprehension with regard to the advice he has received oa this subject, as I am not aware that I ever even spoke favorably of the project before him, and it is one moreover the expedi ency of which at the present moment seems very doubtful. ' His Highness, though I am sure, would never have resolved on sending for his brother, Abdool Azeez, whom he greatly mistrusts, had he not become convinced that he was in a very serious and critical position. What His Highness' plans are now I am not aware, and in truth I doubt if he has any; he has given up negotiating, and is not preparing a force to attack Ibrahim at present. The fact is, I believe, that in courting the Hinavees, as he has done lately, he has estranged most of his old friends the Ghafirees, and he now finds that the Hinavees will not really fight, but have merely flocked round him to secure his money and presents. In the meantime His Highness has been spending his resources and now feels himself embarrassed how to act.' Colonel Iloss writing on the 2nd May added:— ' The proposal of His Highness to send for his brother, Abdool Azeez, was unexpected, and I deemed it advisable to proceed to Muscat to see His Highness on the subject. 'It will be observed that His Highness states in his letter to Major Miles on this subject that I have advised and urged this measure. This, however, is a misapprehension on His Highness' part, which has probably arisen from my putting the question to him, in accordance with the instructions contained in Mr. Aitchison's . * With regard to the first request His Excellency letter No. 99?., paragraph 3* On that occasion in Council fears that there is not much chance of a t r i , j f ji , . . . . 1r reconciliation with Toorkee, hut to remove all ground ^ (ilu not advocate the step which indeed J was of complaint on the part of Ahdool Azeez the Poll- averse from at that time. Once also, when tical Resident in the Persian Gulf will he asked to urging His Highness to appoint a suitable and consult His Highness on the sumect and report the -i i -i r- • , tit t ,• -i , • resu l t responsible Minister, 1 believe J mentioned his [Political A., January 1874, No. 210.] , brother's name amongst several others, but merely as a query. ' The proposal must be considered as entirely emanating from His Highness. On this account, and also from what I saw of the way His Highness' affairs were drifting of late, I considered that if it turned out to be a fixed idea and not a mere passing whim the proposal should be carried into effect if possible. ' Having reached Muscat on the 29th April I waited on His Highness and found him still desirous of having his brother on certain conditions. ' The following day having received your telegram of 27th April, approving the proposal with the proviso that no guarantee should be given regarding Abdool Azecz's conduct towards His Highness or vice versa, I had another interview with the Sultan, when I informed His Highness that agreeably to his expressed desire I was ready to mediate between himself and his brother, Abdool Azeez, in view to a reconcilation. That if Abdool Azeez agreed on his side, I would take his assent in writing to such proposals as were agreed on. But I gave His Highness distinctly to understand that Government cannot give any guarantee for Abdool Azeez's conduct towards His Highness after he had landed at Muscat, and could not be res ponsible in that matter. If His Highness desired my good offices on this understanding, I informed him I proposed to proceed to Kurrachee, and if Abdool Azeez gave the necessary promises, I would bring him to Muscat. His Highness at first said that the guarantee of Government was indispensable, but on it being explained to him that it was impossible for Government to give such a guarantee. His Highness eventually desired me to take the matter up and proceed with it, I accordingly requested His Highness to prepare a letter to his brother which should be entursted to me, and which I would deliver or not as circumstances might determine, and also to inform me of the terms on which he would receive Abdool Azeez. I ascertained that His Highness meant to associate Abdool Azeez with him as his Minister or on occasion his Naib or deputy, and not to admit him to any higher share in the Gvernment. ' I came to Muscat imbued with the idea that Syud Toorkee's position absolutely demanded the presence of some competent assistant in the Government, partly because of his physical incapacity to carry out necessary measures. On arrival I found matters in a far worse state than I had anticipated, and so very precarious that the time was passed for any hesitation in sending for Abdool Azeez. ' His Highness has estranged almost every person in the country capable of advising and assisting him, and is guided almost solely by the advice of one or two worthless favorites who have gained his ear. Worse than this he has lately with incredible weakness lavished his funds on persons like Hamed bin Khalifeen, of the A1 Wahibeh, whom His Highness knows60 to be at heart traitor to his cause. By this fatal trimming policy he has managed to estrange the whole Ghafiree side, and as the Hinavees will not really fire a shot for him at a push he has actually no one to look to for help. In this worse than useless manner all his funds have been squandered. Under these painful circumstances it is not surprising that it is the universal opinion of every intelligent person in the country that Syud Toorkee must succumb to the first serious attack. Furthermore, this is His Highness' own opinion. He repeatedly informed me that the dynasty of his family was worn out, had come to the end of their power, and must give way to another. His Highness also said that he is no longer the Rule- but only the Vakeel or Agent of the Arabs. Major Miles has at my request favored me with a memorandum on the subject of His Highness^ present position, of which I attach a copy. I concur on the whole with the opinions of the Political Agent. Under these circumstances, the only remedy ^hich presents itself is that proposed by His Highness himself, namely, obtaining the assistance of Abdool Azeez. The immediate effect of this measure will doubtless be favorable. It will give satisfaction to many of the Arabs, and Abdool Azeeez's personal energy will be of great use to His Highness. Major Miles is much averse from this measure except as a pis aller , 4 hut agrees with me in thinking that in absence of any better plan it is now a necessity. 'Yesterday, the 1st of May, having obtained the required document, I took leave of His Highness Syud Toorkee and embarked in the May Frere and weighed for Kurrachee. After arrival there^ and communication with the Commissioner in Sind and Abdool Azeez, I shall report further.' On. IstiMay Major Miles wrote :— ' His Highness then recurred to the subject on which he had written to me, viz., the asso ciation with himself in the government of his brother, Abdool Azeez, observing that the time had arrived for a reconciliation between them, as His Highness felt unable any longer to bear the burden of rule alone and unsupported, and that the presence of his brother appeared to him to be essential to the maintenance and stability of his own position and for the insurance of the Sultanate to the family of the late Syud' Saeed. His Highness trusted, however, that the British Government would extend their favours so far as to take a guarantee from Syud Abdool Azeez that he would conduct himself subordinately to His Highess, and refrain from intriguing or acting against him in the event of his being allowed to return. His Highness Syud Toorkee said he considered the taking of security from Abdool Azeez by Government as an indispensable condition, as knowing the character of his brother he could repose no trust or confidence in him without some guarantee for his good faith and behaviour. ' Having had some experience myself of Syud Azeez's character, I did not approve or # encourage His Highness' scheme in any way, and I took occasion to point out that His High ness had appeared to have misapprehended the tenor of your communication to him during your last visit relative to the return of Syud Abdool Azeez.' {Voltl. A., June 1874, Nos. 259-260.] Meanwhile, on the 21st April 1874, Colonel Ross had telegraphed to the Government of India regarding Toorkee's wish for the return of Abdool Azeez. [PoltL A,, April 1874, No. 246.] On the 27th April the Government of India had telegraphed in reply conveying general approval, but adding :— Necessary to be cautious not to commit Government to any guarantee either of conduct of Abdool Azeez towards Toorkee, or vice versa.' [Poltl. A., April 1874, No. 247.] On the 4th May Colonel Ross telegraphed:— Abdool Azeez having agreed to all conditions for reconciliation imposed by Syud loorkee, 1 propose to take him back with me in May Frere to Muscat on 6th. No guarantee given on part of Government either way. Solicit necessary sanction for Abdool Azeez's release being telegraphed to Commissioner.' • {Poltl. A., May 1874, No. 16.] Accordingly the Government of India on the 6th May telegraphed to the Commissioner in Sind:— Arrangements with Abdool Azeez judiciously made by Ross and completed to-day. Ross leaves with Abdool Azeez to-day.' [Poltl. A., May 1874, No. 17.]On the 12th May Colonel Ross telegraphed:— I landed Abdool Azeez at Muscat on 10th. His reception by Sultan was very cordial and the reconciliation has somewhat restored confidence. Mesnaah claims seem likelv to be paid. Am proceeding round Arab Coast to Bushire.' [Poltl. A., June 1874, No. 263.] 276. Memorandum by Major Miles on Toorkee's position generally in JVtay 18 74-. On the same date, May 1st, as showing the precarious position in which Toorkee then was. Major'Miles forwarded' the following memorandum:— ' From the time of His Highness Syud Toorkee's illness in January the weakness of his rule and extreme precariousness of his position have become painfully apparent and have ever since continued to increase. ' The successful raid of Sheikh Saleh bin Ali and more particularly the recent operations of Ibrahim bin Ghais in the Batinah have demonstrated this most conclusively, and there can be no question that His Highness' position is new highly critical, and that without a vigorous effort on his part in some direction the tenure of power cannot long remain in his hands. ' I believe that had- it not been for our demonstration against Mesnaah in March last, Syud Ibrahim would have been at this moment in Muscat and Syud Toorkee a fugitive, unless of course he had been forcibly sustained by us. ' There may be many reasons to account'for Syud Toorkee's present position, but in my opinion the chief are His Highness' small capacity for administration, the entire absence of sincere friends and good advisers to whom he could look, and the reckless waste of his pecuni ary resources. ' During the last eighteen months His Highness has not had a single able and influential adviser near him on whom he could depend, and most of his friends have become gradually estranged. 'In addition to his usual revenues His Highness has received since April 1873 from this Treasury $100,000, nearly the whole of which has been expended in endeavours to pacify the tribes, but the beneficial results of this expenditure may be considered as nil. He has also received an advance up to July 1874 and has had to borrow money Crom Bombay. He has thus no funds in reserve whatever to meet an emergency. ' His Highness has lately adopted a conciliatory policy towards the Hinavees, and it was very successful so long as he subsidized them largely, but both the Ghafirees and Hinavees appear to be standing aloof from him at the present moment, and are wavering and quite ready to join any party that will pay them. Notwithstanding all this, however, the return of Syud Abdool Azeez to Muscat and his association with Syud Toorkee in the government is a measure the expediency of which I consider is extremely doubtful, and one which I should be sorry to advocate were it in any way avoidable. Syud Toorkee's cause though may be looked upon as hopeless, the power has fallen from his grasp, and if we would still endeavour to sustain him, it must be by some strong measure. The installation of Abdool Azeez is of this nature, and desperate remedy though I deem it to be, I look upon it as a necessity.' {Poltl. A., June 1874, No. 260.] 277. Conditions under which Abdool Azeez was allowed to return to Muscat. His conduct at Muscat reported to be satisfactory.— The conditions accepted by Abdool Azeez were set forth in the following agreement, to which Abdool Azeez's signature was attached before he left Kurrachee :— ' His Highness, my brother, Syud Toorkee bin Saeed bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat, having intimated his wish for my return to Muscat on terms of reconciliation and sincere brotherly friendship honorable to us both on condition of my agreeing to observe the following terms:— « 1^.—It is necessary that your heart and friendship be sincere, and that you will be in unity with me and your conduct towards me be good. « ^nd.—Put away all evil from your heart and neither listen to the evil disposed nor regard anything detrimental towards our Government. _ « 3^.—Pay no attention to tale-bearers or strife-makers because from them conies enmity and estrangement between us. 61 Qyou consider anything advisable and I disapprove of it, yon mnst give it np without being offended. / 'Uh—lttale-bearers teU you anything that makes yon unhappy for the purpose of causing separation between us, it is necessary that yon mform me and not conceal .t so that we may consult about it together. , j f 11 , « | Svud Abdool Azeez bin Saced bin Sultan, hereby give my free and full promise to observe these terms, which I accept without reservation or exception in any respect. 'On receiving permission from Her Majesty's Government of India to return to Muscat vjui^ci sr T fmtln'r hereby solemnly declare and promise on my honor and faith Toorkcc, and his 1 reign as SiUtan of Muscat, I will be faithful to him as Biler, will never attempt to nsnrp his position, nor in any way sanction intrigues against his authority, but will do my best to uphold his Government and 'I also promise that, under all circumstances, I will do all in my power to carry out and maintain all treaties and arrangements now existing between the British Government and the Sultan of Muscat, and will on no consideration act contrary to the advise of the British Government and its representatives. 'The above promises I now make freely and sincerely in presence of Sir William Merewether, K.C.S.I. and C.B., Commissioner m Smd, and of Colonel Ross, Political Resident, and hereunto set my hand and seal this 5th day ot May i From Colonel Ross' letter dated 13th May, it appears that Toorkee's reception of his brother was most cordial. On the 10th May Major Miles reported that Abdool Azeez had been allotted a suitable residence apart from the palace and appeared to remain in frequent communication with Toorkee. Finally in his letter dated 29th May 1874, Major Miles wrote 'A few days ago Syud Abdool Azeez received letters from the Sheikhs of the A1 Wahibeh, Mahomed bin Saeed, Hamood bin Saeed, and Munsoor, saying they had rejoiced to hear of his arrival in Oman and offering him their support in dispossessing Syud i oorkee and becoming Sultan himself, but requesting him not to show their letters to Syud Foorkee. Under the ad\ice of Mahomed Azan, Syud Abdool Azeez at once handed over these letters to his brother, and replied to the A1 Wahibeh Sheikhs in the spirit of the engagement he had entered into before you/' [Political A.-, June 1874, No. 266.] [ „ „ „ „ 277.] 278.

The whole of the papers have been reported ' Poiti. a ., July 1874, Nos. 307-8. to the Secretary of State,* and in the last paragraph of the despatch the present position of affairs was thus summarized: ' The insurrection has for the present collapsed, and Syud Abdool Azeez is associated with his brother. His Highness Syud Toorkee, in the government of Muscat. Regarding the payment of compensation, on account of the plunder of British subjects at Mesnaah, we are awaiting a further report from the Political Resident, who has proceeded to Muscat for the purpose of consulting with His Highness Syud Toorkee. We have authorized Colonel Ross to carry out such strong measures as may be needed to the extent of enforcing any terms that he may judge to be reasonable and necessary, but we have expressed a hope that Colonel Ross may find himself able to arrange for a fair indemnity without resort to extreme reprisals. Throughout these proceedings Colonel Ross and Major Miles have acted under instructions from us. Considering the serious losses British subjects and traders in Oman have suffered by the repeated rebellious and dynastic changes that have distracted the country of late years; considering also how firmly the present Ruler of Muscat has been attached to our interests, the readiness with which he met our views in regard to the slave-trade, and the uncertainty how far similar co-operation could be expected from -Ibrahim bin Ghais, who is greatly under the influence of the priestly and fanatical party of Oman, we thought it right, while forbidding our officers to engage in any operations ashore, to comply with Toorkee's request for support, and actively to assist His Highness so far as the guns of our vessels of war can reach.' 13-8-74.

Position of affairs in Oman in July 1874.— The general position of affairs in Oman in July 1874 may be thus summarized :—The insur rection of Ibrahim bin.Ghais was at an end, although the indemnity due by the Yal Saad had not yet been paid, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had been authorized by the Government of India to enforce any terms which he might judge reasonable and necessary; Syud Abdool Azeez had, under certain conditions, been allowed to return to Muscat, and had been associated in the Government by his brother, Syud Toorkee; and the only apprehended diffi culties were from the conduct of the Beni Riyam, a Ghafiree tribe residing in the Jebel 4-khdar, who had lately shown a somewhat turbulent and aggressive spirit. Syud Salim bin Thoweynee, the dispossessed Ruler of^iuscat, was still at Kishm, and it was believed that it was the intention of Syud Toorkee to make him a small allowance. The only question therefore in which the British Government was interested was the payment of the compensation by the Yal Saad tribe qn account of the losses inflicted upon British subjects at Mesnaah, and this narrative will therefore commence with the measures taken to effect the recovery of the amount, which had been fixed at $15,000. 279. Measures taken to effect recovery of the indemnity due by tlie Yal Saad. —On the 25th July Colonel Ross telegraphed that Proceedings, Political a ., August an arrangement had been effected for the payment 1874, No. 257. of the indemnity within three months, and that the Yal Saad tribe had submitted to Syud Toorkee and the Batinah Coast generally pacificated, without the necessity for recourse to severe measures of reprisal. This satisfactory settlement had been effected in the following manner :— On the 10th July Colonel Ross, having previously arranged with the Proceedings, Political a ., August Senior Naval Officer for Her Majesty's Ships 1874, No. 258. Philomel and Magpie to join him at Muscat, pid- ceeded to Burka with Major Miles in the May Frere. He had already addressed letters to Ibrahim bin Ghais and the Yal Saad tribe, warning them that he was about to proceed in force to the Batinah Coast, and had requested the Sultan to despatch a body of troops under command of his brother, Abdool A.zeez, in the corvette Rahinanee. On arrival at Burka (which was held by Syud Toorkee) Abdool Azeez, to whom had been entrusted full powers to negotiate or conclude arrangements in the Sultan's name, landed, and completed his force to about three hundred and fifty men, and Colonel Ross received replies from Ibrahim bin Ghais and the Yal Saad to the letters he had addressed to them. The former made no reasonable offer, and the latter simply repudiated their responsibility. 280. When, however, the Yal Saad Chiefs became aware of the presence of a force in their neighbourhood, they changed their tone, and sent two Sheikhs to say that they would pay the indemnity and make over Mesnaah to Syud Toorkee. On the 13th the force moved to before Mesnaah, which had been partially repaired and garrisoned by Ibrahim bin Ghais, and several days were occupied in discussions between Syud Abdool Azeez and the Yal feaad Sheikhs. The latter pleaded that owing to the divisions existing in the tribe and the want of one acknowledged head, they were unable to combine together to raise the required sum, while, as regarded the fort and town of Mesnaah, they expressed themselves willing that it should be made over to Abdool Azeez', but said that as it was held by a garrison of Ibrahim's men, they would lend to him requesting its peaceable surrender. 281. On the 18th it was arranged that Abdool Azeez should land his men, as it was considered advisable that he should be put in possession of Mesnaah without delay. Owing to a storm arising, the actual landing was not effected till the following day, when, under cover of the men-of-wars boats, the fort was occupied by the troops of Abdool Azeez without any opposition 63 R64 on the oart of the Yal Saad or of the inhabitants. The garrison had blown up a portion of the wall and decamped as soon as the boats began to move towards tiie A S ^ e ^ negotiation with the Yal Saad Chiefs, Abdool Azeez recommended that the 1bllowing terms should be allowed them, viz.^ That these Chiefs should bind themselves and find security to pay the sum of ten thousand dollars within three months. 2 n d _That His Highness the Sultan should take upon himself the remain- mo- five thousand dollars of indemnity in consideration of the entire submission of 5 the Yal Saad tribe and their engaging to refrain in future from joining Ibrahim bin Ghais. . . ;\{ B i a tter condition was based on considerations attectmg the interests )f the Sultan only. Abdool Azeez was of opinion that by acting in this way an obligation would be conferred upon the Yal Saad, which would materially contribute towards a reconciliation with the Batinah tribes and the establish ment of o-ood feelincr with them in future. It would, m fact, make the difference between peace and warfare. Colonel Ross did not therefore deem it advisable to oppose the proposal. He further consented to allow the tribe three months in which to pay the amount to be exacted from them, whilst Abdool Azeez obtained a formal document from the Chiefs binding themselves to pay the amount'to him in seventy days. ^ 284 These terms met with the full concurrence of Syud Toorkee, who expressed himself much gratified with the result so far as his own interests were concerned. Ibrahim bin Ghais was not included in the arrangements, as Colonel Boss thought it best to abstain from entering into any communications with him, audit was hoped that his influence with the Yal Saad would be much impaired.' The policy by which Colonel Ross was guided throughout these proceedings was thus explained by him :— ' In dealing with this troublesome affair, I have throughout endeavoured to combine the promotion of His Highness Syud Toorkee's interest with the attainment? o£ our own object- redress for the plunder of British subjects. This course, though rendering my task somewhat more complicated and delicate, I have thought to be most in accordance with the policy of Government and most conducive to the general good. By acting independently of the Sultan it would no doubt have been possible to bring the offending tribe to terms, but the opportunity would have been lost of enabling Syud Toorkee to recover ground, and the hostility towards him would have continued and perhaps increased, *' By'spirited co-operation with us, and particularly by employing his brother Abdool Azeez a$ his General and representative, Syud Toorkee's position is undoubtedly improved. It is no little advantage that the Arabs should perceive that His Highness has, in his brother, an energetic and bold leader oi his troops. It was furthermore consistent with the digtiit\ of the Sultan that his representative should conduct the negotiations. ' Considered as a whole, the arrangement concluded with the Yal Saad with my assent, and approved by His Highness Syud Toorkee, stands as follows : — The Yal Saad having agreed to return to allegiance to the Sultan and to pay a certain sum in indemnity to British subjects* and also to refrain from joining Ibrahim bin Ghais m future are received back as subjects of the Sultan, 'In consideration of their submission the Sultan relieves the Yal Saad from a portion of the indemnity payment by taking it on himself. 'The Yal Saad Chiefs have executed a bond which is guaranteed by the Chiefs of certain other tribes, engaging to pay to Syud Abdool Azeez the sum of ten thousand dollars in seventy days from 22nd July 1874. ' Syud Abdool Azeez, as the Sultan's representative in the matter, undertakes to recover the above amount in accordance with the bond within three months. The full amount of British claims, that is the sum of 15.,000 dollars, to be then paid by the Sultan. ' Other minor terms were arranged between Abdool Azeez and the Y al Saad, but they are matters purely between the Sultan and his subjects^ 'It would of course have been more satisfactory to have obtained immediate payment of these claims, but after careful consideration I was convinced that this could only be effected bv resort to actual hostilities, which would under the circumstances have been scarcely warrant ed by my instructions, and would also in my own judgment have b&lt; en impolitic. 1 trust, therefore, that the arrangement effected may on the whole meet with the approval of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General ia Council. '65 285. The Oovernment ot India approved of the proceedings of Colonel Ross Proceedings, Political a ., August and Major Miles, and requested that their acknow- 1874, No. 265. ledgmeiits might be conveyed to the Senior Naval Officer, Captain Garforth, of Her Majesty's Ship Philomel, to the Commanders of Her Majesty's Steam-ships Nimble and Magpie, and to Captain Guthrie. Com manding the May Frere, for their co-operation in the settlement of these affairs The whole of the proceedings were reported for the information of the Secre tary of State. 286. The people of Mesnaah and Soweik soon returned to their former peaceful occupations. The Walee of the latter place, Ali bin Salim, was deposed, and Seif bin Hainood, Sheikh of the Hinawee tribe of Beni Ruweyeh, was ap pointed to succeed him, and the Sultan made arrangements for garrisonino- Mesnaah with some of the Heddadebeh tribe (also Hinawees) frJhi Fanjah. ' 287. Movements of Ibrahim bin Ghais. Reconciliation Major Miles' No. 348-143, dated 5th With SyndL Toorkee. —Syud Ibrahim bin Ghais August 1874. was at El Hazam at the time of the departure of Major Miles from Mesnaah after the settlement of affairs there. He shortly afterwards proceeded to Rostak, and succeeded with the aid of the El-Ibrahim (? El-lbri-im) in possessing himself of the districts of Awabi and of the Wadi Political a ., November 1874, No. 34. l- &gt;en i Khuroos, and it was said that he was build- ing a tort at -Awabi with the object of strengthening himself and ensuring his retention of the country. The Sheikh of the Yal-bu^ Rasheyd tribe (Hinawees) arrived at Muscat on the 11th August with the view of arranging with the Sultan several matters connected with the Batinah, and he informed Major Miles that he was willing to offer himself as a mediator between His Highness and Ibrahim bin Ghais. He also stated that the Metowwa Moham med bin Sulleym el-Gharibee (who had himself drawn up the agreement) was making great efforts to collect the amount of the indemnity due by the Yal Saad to the British, and that there was every probability of the money being paid by the appointed time. Major Miles also reported that a disposition was shown by Ibrahim bin Ghais to withdraw from further opposition to Syud Toorkee, and to come to an amicable arrangement. Seif bin Hamood, the newly appointed Wullee of Soweik, at the wish of Ibrahim bin Ghais, proceeded to Kostak, and had a meet ing with Ibrahim on the subject, with satisfactory results. It was understood by Major Miles that Ibrahim had unconditionally submitted to the Sultan, and was ready to accept whatever allowance His Highness might be pleased to settle on him. This allowance was fixed at one hundred dollars monthly, and it was also agreed that the sum of two thousand dollars, due to Syud Toorkee from Syud Hamid bin * ^ n n . El-Imam, beinsf the unpaid balance of a fine of seven Paragraph 263 of Precis. ., i i n 0 • r j . l , i thousand dollars, imposed some ten months pre viously on Syud Hanaid for engaging in a treasonable correspondence, should be d i *- , * Ar u remitted. A written engagement to this effect was Political A., March 1875, No. 507. . , • ip tt i • i • /-ii • shortly atterwards received from I brahim bin Ghais, and the allowance payable to him commenced to run. 288. Payment of the indemnity by the Yal Saad .—To return to the question of the indemnity payable by the Yal Saad. On the 3rd October Major Miles reported that Syud Abdool Azeez had informed him that the Yal Saad had succeeded in collecting the amount due by them, and that some of the tribe were shortly expected in Muscat with the money» The Envoy, D ... .r Seif bin Hamad, arrived on the 4 th October, but ' irC) 0 ' 0 ' L only brought with him the sum of $3,133, and a message from the tribe that they had only been able to collect so much, and that they requested time in which to pay the balance. Both Syud Toorkee and Syud Abdool Azeez considered this as merely a ruse to gain time, and expressed their confidence that the tribe had collected more than the full amount of the indemnity. As Major Miles felt that it would be extremely inexpedient to enter-66 tain the request for an extension of the time allowed for payment, he deemed it best after conferring with Syud Abdool Azeez, to request the Sultan to despatch that prince to the Batinah in order to use -his influence with the sureties to induce the Yal Saad to fulfil their obligations. Syud Abdool Azeez accordingly left Muscat for Burka upon this mission on the 8th October. 289° Abdool Azeez was successful in effecting an arrangement with the Yal Saad. by which they engaged to pay up the balance of the amount due by them by the 15th Ramzan, corresponding with the 26th October 1874, and surrendered six hostages as security for the due performance of their promise. In the meantime Abdool Azeez was to remain at Burka with the hostages until the full amount should be paid in. 290. On the 2nd November, however, Abdool Azeez returned to Muscat with about one hundred of the Yal Saad tribe, and Political a., March 1875, No. 516. ^ ^ 7^000, which had been paid by them, leaving the sum of $ 3,000 to be still recovered. The Yal Saad endeavoured to induce the Sultan to relieve them of this payment, either by taking it upon himself or by soliciting Government to forego the rest ol their claim, but this His Highness positively refused to do, and he insisted, moreover, on the balance being produced without further delay. , 291. On the 20th November Major Miles reported that only $1,400 remained unpaid. T he Sultan had however in- Poiiticai a., March 1875, Nos. 519-520. carcerate( j some 0 f the Sheiks in Fort Merani for not having fulfilled their promise, and he informed the Political Agent that he intended to keep them there until the full amount was paid up. The Government of India, in reporting these proceedings to the Secretary of State, were of opinion that the affair had been managed successfully by the Sultan under the advice of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent at Muscat. The Secretary of Political a.. May 1875, No. concurred with the Government of India in this opinion. 292. The affair was finally settled by the Yal Saad paying the whole of Political a.., March 1875, Nos. 522- the indemnity of ten thousand dollars with the 525 « 530 - exception of $400. Syud Toorkee represented that they were really unable to make up this small sum, and on the 28th January 1875, the Government of India authorized the Resident in the Persian Gull to instruct Major Miles to terminate the matter by accepting the amount already paid in quittance of British demands upon the Yal Saad, and dividing it amongst the traders who had suffered at Mesnaah. On the 27th November the Political Agent reported that in communication with Syud Toorkee, who considered that the Batinah had reverted to his authority, he had permitted British Indian traders to return and resume their usual occupations at Mesnaah. On the 2nd April 1875 Major Miles reported that the indemnity of $9,600 pi *, tat xr received from the Yal Saad had been duly and Political A., June 1875, Nos. 68-71. . ii t , -i , i , ,1 /y» • xi. i? ii * rateably distributed to the sufferers m the following manner :— No Names of traders.

In consideration, however, of the cordial co operation and assistance rendered l.y the Sultan's brother, Abdool Azeez in negotiating and dealing with the Yal Saad tribe, and the great expense incurred by His Highness throughout the affair, the Political A ^nt su Jested that the demand for this portion of the indemnity should be waived altogether ihis proposal was supported by the Resident at Bushire. In reply the Political Agent was informed that His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council was of opinion that His Highness •i 1 ^ oor ^ ee s ^ ou ^ J 36 requested to fulfil his engagement to such extent as might be necessary to give lair compensation for the losses actually sustained. As the registered claims of the traders amounted to $12,717, of which they had received only $9,5/2, Ljeutenant-Colonel Miles was informed that the balance of $5,000 due from His Highness should be reduced to the amount which would suffice for payment after careful investigation into the claims which had been registered and still remained unsatisfied,' SECTION II. 293. Expedition of Syud Toorkee against the Beni Riyam.— Proceedings, Political a., July 1874, Towards the end of July the Political Resident Nos. 312-313. in the Gulf obtained the sanction of the Government of India to the advance of six months' subsidy to the Sultan of Muscat, on the ground that he had assisted our operations on the Batinah, by fitting out an expedition at some expense. The object of this advance was soon apparent, for on the 24th August the Resident telegraphed that Syud Toorkee was about to Proceeding Political a ., August p ro ceed on the following day against the Beni w-i. No. 272. Riyam, and that he would be joined by the Precis, paragraph 270. TT • , r , ., ,, . , T ., , J , J J: , llinawees at Semail. Major Miles had, on the 19th September 1873, reported that the Beni Riyam were desirous of obtaining possession of certain property belonging, or said to belong to them, in Nezwa and Birket-el Mowz ; that they expected to gain both wealth and influence by a Colonel Ross' memorandum on t]ie rising, and would probably create a disturbance | rib( jy;f S 1 '*! 1 ' Polltical A -' Se P tem - before long. The Beni Riyam, according to Colonel V 0 ' Ross, inhabit the district of Jebel-el-Akhdar, and are one of the most important of the Ghafiree tribes, numbering 2,000 fighting men. Jebel-el-Akhdar, or the Green Mountain, is a range of hills situated between Rostak and Nezwa, in the heart of Oman, and is evidently well adapted to be the stronghold of a race of hardy mountaineers. 294. Previously to the departure of Syud Toorkee on the expedition, the province of Oman had been in a very disturbed state. Dissensions and hostilities had broken out between the Hinawee tribes of Nezwa and Ziki and the Ghafiree Beni Riyam regarding the fort of Birket-el-Mowz; one serious collision Major Miles' No. 348-143, dated 5th had occurred in which about thirty of the Beni August 1874. Riyam had been killed, and that tribe had been dispossessed of the Birket-el-Mowz. The Sultan of Muscat had espoused the cause of the Hinawees in the quarrel and had not only substantially aided them with men and money, but had despatched a brass field gun with ten gunners to Ziki (where the Hinawees were masters of the situation) to assist them in reducing the fortresses held by their opponents. 295. Various attempts were made to reconcile the two contending parties, Proceedings, Political a ., Kovember both by independent persons, and by the Sultan's 1874, Xo. 34. representative, but all without effect j the reason of the failure being that the Ghafiree tribe of Beni Riyam insisted on the 67 s68 restoration of the forts that had been wrested from them, while the Hinawees stoutly refused to render up wfiat they had succeeded m gaming possession of by force of arms. 296 Such beinc the position of affairs, His Highness Syud loorkee deemed it expedient to proceed to the scene of hostilities m person and bring the war to a conclusion before it reached more serious dimensions. But as he had become seriously embarrassed in his pecuniary affairs, he solicited an advance of S10 000 from Government for his expenses before uncertaking his contem plated enterprise, and his request was granted by Major Miles, on the following grounds;— 'The urgency of the matter appeared to me to warrant a compliance with His Ilighness' request as 1 considered that the unusual energy displayed by His Highness would, with a successful issue of the campaign, tend very greatly to strengthen his position, tranquillize the countrv and prevent the constant recurrence of the insurrections and disturbances to which it has been subiect so long. I therefore informed Syud Abdool Azeez that Government having been pleased to sanction an advance to Syud Toorkee if found necessary, I was ready to meet His Highness' wishes. His Highness has accordingly since drawn upon me for itupees 21,600, which 1 have honored and paid. 297. Syud Toorkee left Muscat on the morning of the 28th August, accompanied bv a force of about 400 men. He left his biother, Syud Abdool Azeez, in charge of Muscat during his absence. Major Miles reported that the Sultan was becoming on much better terms with Abdool Azeez, and that a very cordial understanding existed between them. The conduct of Abdool Azeez since he had been at Muscat had been very straightforward and sincere and the Sultan felt that he could place much confidence in him. The garrison left at Muscat consisted of about two hundred Wahabees and some of the Beni Bu Hassan tribe of Jaalan. 298. The expedition was of short duration, for on the Sultan proceeding beyond Semail, the Ghafiree tribes gave in their sub- Political A., November 1874. No. 40. mission and Syud Tool .kee returned to Semail to make the final arrangements and to dismiss the Hinawee tribes collected for the campaign. 4 299. The terms on which peace was concluded were as follows ;— 1. That the old bazar under the fort at Ziki, formerly occupied by the Beni Riyam, and lately abandoned by them for a new bazar at some distance, should be re-occupied and the new one destroyed. 2. That the annual date-tax due by the Ghafirees should be paid as usual. 3. That Salim bin Nasir, Chief of Harat-el-Raha, who was ihiprisoned by the sons of Seif-bin-Suleiman, the Sheikh of the Beni Riyam, should be released and his property restored. 4. That Beit-el-Jameh in Nezwa captured by the Hinawees should not be ■ restored, but should remain in possession of the Sultan. 5. That Beit-el-Salut should continue to remain with the Ghafirees. 300. The last condition was the only one in favour of the Ghafirees, and they were compelled to yield the chief point stipulated for by them when endeavours were made to mediate between the belligerent parties, namely, the restitution of the forts captured from them by the Hinawees. Few well-informed persons, however, believed that they would continue to observe and act up to the terms of the engagement longer than it suited their convenience to do so, and it was anticipated that they would watch for an early opportunity to recommence, hostilities. 301. A salute of 21 guns was fired at Muscat on the 10th September by Syud Abdool Azeez in honor of the successful peace concluded by the Sultan, who returned to Muscat on the 12th of that month. 302. Syua Toorkee expressed himself as satisfied with the result of the Political a., March 1875, No. soy. expedition, and said that the Sheikhs of the Al- Wahibeh and other tribes had mediated in tne69 affair and brought the Bern Biyam to terms. The latter were tired of the struggle, having expended most of their resources, and His Hio-hness did not think they would attempt to renew the conflict for a considerable time. 303. Further dissensions between the Hinawee and Gha- firee tribes, Ihe truce that had been arranged between the contending Political a., Marcb 1875, No. 516. pities, the Nizar or Ghafiree Arabs, and the Y emen or Hinawees, was wantonly violated by a treacherous act on the part of one of the latter at the beginning of November. The brother of one of the Beni Ruweyeh tribe (Hinaweesy who was slain at Ziki during the recent disturbances there, murdered a Ghafiree of the town, named Salim bin Nasir, in revenge for his brother's death; the murderer Khalid being himself severely wounded by his victim during the commission of the deed. This according to Arab ideas constituted an unpardonable breach of honor, and the matter soon became further complicated by the Ghafirees murdering, one of the Beni Ruweyeh. Major Miles stated that although he was not exactly informed as to what course the Sultan intended to adopt in this affair, it was probable he would endeavour to hold himself aloof, and the Political a., March 1875, No. 517. Political Agent was directed by the Government of Inaia to encourage His Highness in this intention. 304. On the 25th December Major Miles reported that a serious conflict Political a ., February 1875, No. 50. ^ iac } 0 ^ c , ui * e&lt; ^ * n El-Dhahireh between the Hinawees and (jrhanrees, m which the latter were worsted. The aggressors were the Beni Ghafir, united with several smaller tribes and numbering, it was said, about two thousand. They attacked the Hinawee tribe of Beni Ali at \ enkul, but were ignominiously defeated and were compelled to retreat with a loss of about ninety men; the Beni Ali, wjio were numerically very inferior, losing only thirteen. Syud Bedr bin Seif, the Governor of Sohar, had been solicited to proceed to El-Dhahireh for the purpose of mediating between the belligerents, and the Sultan had instructed him to endeavour to arrange peace if possible. 305. On the 29th January 1875 it was further reported that open hosti- Poiiticai a ., March 1875, Nos. lities had broken out between the various Hinawee 527-529 * and Ghafiree tribes; who divide the Semail valley between them. A few days previously a party of Hinawees, urged on by the Beni Ruweyeh, fired into the house of the Walee of Semail, Syud Hamad bin Saeed, killing three persons, one of whom was a Hinawee woman. The Gha firees retaliated by cutting down the Hinawees' date trees, and as this only served to embitter the quarrel, both parties began to collect their forces, and it was said that about a thousand of the Beni Ruweyeh, were on the move to attack the Ghafirees. The Beni Ruweyeh according to Colonel Ross, are one of the largest of the Hinawee tribes, numbering 2,500 fighting men. 306. The Walee of Semail, not being able to take action himself, repaired at once to Muscat, and reported the affair personally to Syud Toorkee, who directed him, in conjunction with Syud Hamad bin Hamad, Walee of Burka, and Syud Nasir, Walee of Soor, to proceed to Semail to mediate between the belligerents and endeavour to effect an amicable arrangement of the quarrel. Major Miles stated, however, that though it was possible they might succeed in securing a short truce, it was considered very improbable by well-informed persons that either party would consent to settle the feud without recourse to 1. jl #/ iii mi arms, and a serious conflict might therefore be expected between them, ine Ghafirees of El-Dhahireh (paragraph 304) were also collecting their forces to renew the conflict and were said to be meditating an attack on Dhunk, a large town on the road between Bereymi and Ibri. 307. In this unsettled state of things the following telegram was received from Colonel Ross, under date the 23rd February 1875 &lt;f Political Agent, Muscat, telegraphs from Jask, 22nd, as follows:—' Have come across to communicate. Toorkee solicits three months' advance subsidy arrange Semail difficultywhich he greatly dreads. Ha3 unsuccessfully endeavoured raise loan. Consider position lowing weaker and more preearions; he is now entirely in Mesh s hands and advance i{ made would probably be muddled away by him unless some assuraiiw tafen of its devotion to intended obi oct It is important though to avert hostilities, and as thie cannot be done without funds, 1 bco- te smiport it. I have suggested to Toorkee to employ Azeez in settlement of this affair. Toorkee has offered to Azeez to abdicate in his favor; but Azeez declined. Azeez now interferes and g'ives counsel as seldom as possible as also Mahomed Azzan. 1 think time has- come to' advice Toorkee to raise Azeez's position and associate him more equally m (Govern ment as his influence 'is rapidly extending and he is now Toorkee's best supporter. He has behaved hitherto with prudence and loyalty, and his co-administration with loorkee is not only almost necessary to latter, but would probably ensure his own accession on looi-Ws death. 1 submit this proposal for consideration, but am not sure how it would be received by Toorkee and Azeez/ Message ends. Following is second message from Major Miles, dated 23rd ' I understand Toorkee purposes arrange matter amicably, mediation if possible, this of course would be expensive, as it would involve payments both parties. Toorkee dreads lest war between Hinawees and Ghafirees become general. If Semail affair not settled, rival factions might then take advantage of opportunity/ Second message ends. I respectfully suggest Major Miles being authorized to advance the money to Sultan provided satisfactory assurances are given as toUs proper disposal. I think it would be well to take the opportunity to make a strong representation to His Highness on the subject of his advisers. I solicit hs early a replv as possible by telegraph, as detention of Nimble at Telegraph Station would interfere with reliefs.' 308. The Government of India communicated the following instructions by telegraph :— Your telegram of twenty-third. You are authorized to give Toorkee advance of three months' subsidy without conditions and with expression of our best wishes. Advice and help may be given if requested on any particular matter, but Government of India is averse from interference in internal affairs of Oman, and advice should not be volunteered/' 309. Osi the 6th February Major Miles reported the return of the three Major Miles' No. 62-32, dated etii officers to Muscat, and stated that they had failed February 1875. to effect any satisfactory settlement of the dispute, and had with difficulty succeeded in inducing the parties to accede to a two months suspension of hostilities to give time for further negotiations. Major Miles distrusted any peaceable termination of the contest for the following reasons:—Is^, because it arose in a breach of Arab faith and honor on the part of the Beni Ruweyeh, and 2nd, because the loss sustained by the Hinawees in their date trees cut down by the Ghafirees in Wady Semail amounted to at least fifty or sixty thousand dollars,—a most serious injury, and one through which the seeds had been sown of a prolonged and bitter feud. Major Miles proceeds :— ' Were the damage less considerable, it is possible the breach might have been healed by the Sultan simply ordering the Hinawees to pay blood-money for those slain by them, and the Ghafirees to indemnify the sufferers for the loss of their property, but the injury inflicted by the Ghafirees is so much beyond what they will ever be able or willing to repay that a recourse to arms seems inevitable. ' It must be obvious that the causes of these quarrels ,must be attributable in a great measure to the weak policy and want of foresight of His Highness Syud Toorkee in dealing with his people. On the conclusion of His Highness' expedition against the Beni Iliyam in September 1874, the conditions imposed on that tribe were not wholly carried out as reported by me at the time, and no attempt has since been made by His Highness to enforce them. Again, when the outrage was first committed by the Beni Ruweyeh the feud might have been checked and the affair probably arranged by judicious mediation, but His Highness di i not interpose. The tribes were left to settle their own differences and the power to control them has now left his hands. Hie Metowwa party are still striving to foment discord, and it is rumoured that the limawees of El Sharkeyeh are preparing to join the Beni Ruweyeh and other Hinawees of Oman against the Ghafirees. Nearly the whole principality indeed is now astir, and from the nickering light my imperfect information gives me, a contest seems likely to ensue that will distract the country from one end to the other.' 310. Colonel Ross, in acknowledging the receipt of this information, referred the Political Agent to the orders of the Government (paragraph 304) t encourage His Highness the Sultan to avoid taking part in the feud. 311. On the 19th February Major Miles reported that the truce between ioiTruaT ^875 No ' 8 ^' 42 ' dated 19th the hostile Hinawees and Ghafirees in the Semail ' ' district was still valid, that no hostilities had ot cunec, and that when an attempt had been made bv some of the Hinawees 70to break the truce by firing into the Ghafirees' territory, the leaders of both parties inteifered and came to an understanding that the truce should Vm respected for the full period. Major Miles added ' ' His Highness Syud Toorkee is in considerable anxiety at the pros nee t of f}^ approaching contest, and would be willing to avert the chance of it hy iny mctns in his power He is apprehensive lest the Hmawecs, should they prove triumphant ovc. the Ghafirces iTs-'hts:,^ 8 the,uiclvca of ^ ^ ^ Major Mi'es also forwarded a copy of a letter from Syud Toorkee, solicitina payment o: the next half-yearly subsidy in advance. This was sanctioned by the Government of India. J 312. Major Miles reported on the 6th March that the Ghafirees had Ma j o r Miles' No. iu-54. dated 6th responded favourably to the Sultan's offer of media- i i ' i i i . ^ on Semail affair, and that some of the readers had already arrived at Muscat for the purpose of conferring with His Holiness. I he arrival of the Hinawees was expected shortly. The great difficimy lay in satisfying the demands of the Hinawees for compensation for ^ . ? S i i , 5 te trees » b ufc ^ Sultan stated that if he were to overcome tns dimcnlty, he would endeavour to extend the truce for one year. 313. A week later, however, no progress had been made in the arbitration Major Miles' No. 121-58, dated 13th of this affair, thouofh the leaders of both the March ' . parties were present m Muscat, and the Hinawee tribes supporting the Sultan, such as the Al-Wahibeh, Bu Hassan, &amp;c., had intimated to him that they would be compelled to join the other Hinawees in the conflict if some amicable settlement were not arrived at. it was then proposed to refer the matter to the decision of the Kazees, and a few of each party were deputed to the Batinah to request Mohammed bin Suleyyim el Gharibee to undertake the duty of an arbitrator. 314. On the 3rd April, however, the Political Agent reported that this Political a., May 1875, Nos. 333-338, tempt to adjust the difficulty had -failed, as El- Gharibee had declined to proceed to Semail and undertake the matter, on the ground, it was believed, that he had no guarantee or assurance from the parties that his decision would be respected or acted on. He offered to come into Muscat and give his decision if specially requested to do so by the Sultan, and provided His Highness would assemble the leaders of the parties there, but this proposal apparently failed to meet with Syud Toorkee's approval. ^ Major Miles stated that, although the two months' truce had expired, and no hostilities had yet occurred, the general impression was that a recourse to arms was inevitable, unless the Sultan proceeded in person to Semail. 315. The Hinawee tribes, El-Hijrieen and Boo Hassan of Jaalan, who had been retained by Syud Toorkee for the protection of Muscat since the dis missal of the Wahabees (see paragraph 380), intimated their intention not to take part in the coming struggle, as they had been threatened by the Beni boo Ali that if they joined their fellow tribesmen in Oman, the Beni boo Ali would regard it as a casus belli and attack them in Jaalan. The only reason for hoping that hostilities would be postponed lay in the fact that if the Hinawees cut off the water-supply, the Ghafirees who occupied the lower part of the valley of Semail would be irretrievably ruined, as their date-crops would be destroyed. They would therefore do all in their power to avert an immediate rupture. 316. In the beginning of April some of the El-Hijrieen and Boo Hassan went to Semail from Muscat to make a final endeavour to close the breach between the parties, with the result that a further suspension of hostilities was agreed on for two months. No final adjustment of the quarrel was made, but hopes were entertained that through the intervention of Syud Hillal, who was the owner of extensive date-groves in the district, and whose interests would materially suffer in the event of a conflict between the tribes, an amicable ter mination of the affair might be brought about. As the basis of a settlement, the Hinawees had offered to make peace and forego all other claims if some property, 71 ». ^ 1 u ifn flip Metowwa El-Khalilee, and which had been injured r thl Ghafiree^ to the'value of about $8,000, were made good, and in view of HiM had proposed to purchase the property under certain conditions, this byud xlillai i I i ^ t | ie 28th May Lieutenant -Colonel Miles re- ported* that the negotiations for an amicable adjust- letter from Poiitici Ke«ideut, iv.mn t ot ' gemail difficulty had totally faded, and No. 486-150, o&gt;» t i mt hostilities had broken out throughout the district. Tnthe first conflict the Hinawees suffered a severe defeat, twenty-two being killed and a large number wounded, but thetr forces were gathering and they P. n wpvpre struo-ale with the Ghaffirees. In the following were piepau „ . ^ • mont h''' (June 10th) Lieutenant-Colonel Miles was cl/To S^th'jt.e enabled to submitt a more favorable report to the 1875'. ' effect that actual hostilities had not been renewed in the Semail District and that no further bloodshed had occurred there. A short truce of ten days had again been agreed to by both parties during which it was hoped some efforts for promoting a reconciliation would be made On . p . the 24th of the month ^June) Lieutenant-Colonel GniSe^nJaatedirjuiy™ Miles communicated} the satisfactory intelligence that the Semail difficulty had at length been satisfactorily, and it was hoped, finally adjusted, and that no further disturbances m that quarter were to be apprehended for the present at all evnts. In addition to the actual injuries inflicted on each other both parties were suffering greatly by remaining so lon&lt;| in an offensive attitude which prevented them from attending to their crops and date trees. Both sides had recently been reinforced by ^arge numbers, and a serious conflict being imminent between them, they both became anxious to make peace at any sacrifice. Therefore on the mediation ot the El Yaakib, a Ghaffiree tribe of Ibria, peace was concluded on the understanding that all matters in dispute should rest as they were, each side withdiawmg all claups ao-ainst the other. The Hinawees declared to having lost forty men slam m the various encounters, and the Ghaffirees said they had lost three » 110 blood- money, however, was to be paid by either side. ' It will be seen wrote Lieu tenant-Colonel Miles:— 'That the Hinawees have had decidedly the worst of the affair all throa^h and have suffered most, both in men and property. The terms of peace therefore cannot be equally acceptable to both sides, and it will probably be observed only so long as suits the convenience of the Hinawees.' SECTION III. 317. Allowance to Syud Abdool Azeez during his resi- poiitimi a .. September 1874, ne.. dence at Muscat.—The circumstances attend- 36i-37i. i n g the return of Syud Abdool Azeez to Muscat and his reconciliation with his brother, Syud Toorkee, will be found related in paragraph 277 of this Precis. 318. It appeared that no arrangement was then made with respect to the allowance Syud Abdool Azeez was to receive at Muscat, and on the 26th June 1874 the Political Agent reported that it had come to his knowledge that the Syud was in embarrassed circumstances, and that he was unable to provide for his own expenses. Acting on the advice of Major Miles, Syud Abdool Azeez represented his circumstances to the Sultan, who referred the matter to the Political Agent. Major Miles informed him that he regarded the question as one solely for His Highness' consideration. 319. Syud Toorkee subsequently proposed that the allowance should he paid through the British Government, but under 'mstructions from the Resident in the Gulf, Major Miles informed him that the matter was not one in which the Government could intervene. 320. His Highness then arranged to pay Syud Abdool Azeez the sum of five hundred dollars monthly, commencing from the IGth May 1874, altera 7273 refund of six hundred dollar, which was in deposit in the Muscat Treasury on account of the allowance of Abdool Azeez while he was residing in British territory^ had been itiade to him. These arrangements met with the approval of the Government of India. 321. Disagreements between Syud Toorkee and his nephews, Syuds Mohammed and Hamad .-^-Major Miles reported, on the 27th August 1874, that a difference had arisen between Syud Tborkee and. Political a., september 1874, nos. his nephews, Syud Mohammed and Hamad, the 34 7 -34». sons of the late Sultan of Muscat, Syud Thoweynee bin Saeed. The cause of this was attributed to family matters connected with Syud Toorkee's daughter, who was married to her cousin, Hamad, in November 1873, but had subsequently been divorced. Since then the two Syuds have received the Sultan's permission to proceed to Bombay, but had not availed themselves of it. 322. On the evening of the 21st August Major Miles was surprised by a visit from the Syuds and their two sisters (one of whom was the widow of the late Minister, Thoweynee bin Mohammed), who said they had come to claim refuge and protection, as they had just been sent for by the Sultan, and had learnt privately that it was His Highness intention to imprison them in fetters in the fort to prevent them from leaving Muscat. Major Miles found it impossible to refuse them an asylum, but immediately communicated with Syud Toorkee, and requested him to send down influential persons to reassure his nephews. 323. Syud Toorkee sent over Syud Mohammed Azzan, the Governor of Muscat, without delay, who gave them repeated assurances that they had nothing to fear; but as they were still unwilling to go, Major Miles promised them his protection and a guarantee of safety, and they then returned home with their sisters. 324. Syud Toorkee was averse to their leaving Muscat, as he feared they might be induced by evil-disposed persons to intrigue and form a coalition against him, and His Highness endeavoured to secure the mediation of the British Agent with the view of their remaining at Muscat. The difficulty lay in Syud Toorkee having already given them permission to depart, but it was stated that this had been granted hastily and without due consideration. 325. Major Miles therefore took an opportunity of advising the youths strongly against quitting their uncle's protection, and made them understand that they must not expect any support from Government while in India, and that should they return to Oman from Bombay to foster rebellion against Syud Toorkee they would incur the displeasure of Government. 326. The two Syuds adopted the advice of Major Miles, and at the request of Syud Toorkee they gave up their intention of proceeding to India. The . proceedings of Major Miles in adjusting these family differences were approved by the Government of India. 327. Proceedings of Syud Salim bin Thoweynee.—On the 17th September 1874 Major Miles reported that Syud Abdool Azeez bin ^ „ Thowevnee, the brother of Syud Salim, and a man named Dahoo bin Mohammed had arrived at Muscat from Gwadur in company with Deen Mohammed, the Chief of Dashtyar, who had been induced to bring them in, Major Miles believed, on a promise of recompense. Syud Abdool Azeez had been immured in the palace, and it was not expected he would be furth^ harmed, but there was good reason to believe that Dahoo had been executed by the Sultan. 328. Major Miles further reported on the 3rd October that the mother ^ of Syud Salim had arrived at Muscat on her way Political a ., Marcii 18/5, No. 509. to Kishm from Zanzibar. She had embarked onboard a bugla belonging Burghash, which had foundered at sea near Socotra and gone down with seventy -five so ^fs on board. About thirty persons, including the lady mentioned above, had crowded into a boat and reached the island, whence they were brought on by a coasting vessel, r- w - nt ™ koq 329. On the 18th January 1875 the Kesident Political A., Maa-ch 18/5, Nos. od l J- , i i j. i.v i* n • xi' i. 548. at Bushire telegraphed to the tollowmg ettect:— ' Political Agent, Muscat, telegmplis that Syud Toorkee fears his nephew, Salim, will try to cross either to Pirate Coast or Soor, having been invited by Ghafiree tribes of Jaalan. Salim is residing- on Kishm island ki Persian territory. Would Government wish any endeavours made to prevent Salim crossing- to Oman or to arrest him if found at sea.' In reply, Colonel Ross was referred to the previous correspondence which had passed on the subject of Syud Salim,* and * Paragraph Zoo of Precis. especially to the orders of the Government of India, dated the 5th November 1873, that if Syud Salim ' comes into Gwadur or Kurrachee and gives himself up unconditionally he will be granted the same provision as Abdool Azeez; but that if he does not comply within such time as you [the Commissioner in Sind] may direct, the terms will not be renewed, but he will be made a pri soner wherever found and it was stated that these orders were still in force, and that Syud Salim might be made a prisoner whenever it was in the power of the E-esident to arrest him. 330. The apprehensions felt by Syud Toorkee in reference to his nephew will be understood from the following letter, which was addressed to the Political Agent, under date the 23rd December 1874 :— ' I inform you that by the blessing of the Almighty Oman is at peace and its inhabi tants in security, there being no disturbance of any kind at present. AVhat I have now to represent concerns my nephew, Salim bin Thoweynee. I took pity and compassion on him and his circumstances because he had suffered much, and seeing he had no hope except in«me I settled a monthly allowance on him sufficient for his support on the understanding that he would give up all his designs and evil intentions and take up his residence at Kishm. Now in these days I am constantly receiving intelligence that he is intriguing and endeavouring to cause a rising in Oman, and some of the discontented give him encouragement and hope, but they are false, and they do not cease to maintain a correspondence. I cannot, however, remain silent while he is fomenting disturbances in my dominions, as I fear lest his intrigues should result in loss and injury to my subjects, and I therefore beg you will do me the favor to write or send a messenger to Sheikh Suggur giving Salim over to his charge and letting him understand that in the event of any thing being done by Salim you would hold him (Sheikh Suggur) responsible. My reliance for peace and security will then be on the British Govern ment on whom I depend, and the allowance to Syud Salim will be continued to him. If my request be more than you can accede to, I beg you will grant me permission to send and bring Salim to Muscat, whereby the anxiety he is causing will be removed and peace of mind secured to me. The information I have is from a trustworthy source, and I am willing to abide by your decision.' 331. Colonel Ross informed the Sultan in reply that he was unable to accede to his request to hold Sheikh Suggur of Kishm responsible fur Syud Salim's intrigues, and he trusted that His Highness would also see that it would be contrary to the established custom of the British Government to sanction the forcible seizure of Syud .Salim when residing in foreign territory. He requested His Highness to acquaint Major Miles as soon as he had -reason to apprehend that any hostile movement from .Kishm was' being undertaken by Syud Salim, or that he meditated crossing to Oman. 332. On the 16th January Major Miles telegraphed that Syud Toorkee's anxiety was increasing, and that he believed Syud Salim would either try to cross to the Pirate Coast, or would come down to Soor, whither he had been invited by the Ghafiree tribes of Jaalan. In a letter of the same date he transmitted a further letter he had received from Syud Toorkoe on the subject, which is given below :—• w ^ ith reference to my letter to your address touching the designs and evil intentions of my brother, Syud Salim, 1 have now to inform you that this is chiefly owing to the visits he ifceives from the people of Oman whose desire it is to see disturbances afoot by which the peop e may be disquieted. Your reply to my, communication I have received stating you have 747^ referred tlie matter to Colonel Ross whose decision I shall be bound to accept since the in terests of the British and Arab Governments are one, and Colonel Ross has always interested himself in all that concerns me and will enquire into the matter. I have been expecting- a reply for some time. Now we have come to know from a reliable source that the abovementioned people of Oman are visiting Mm and I fear will gain the mastery over his understanding, and that he will consent to carry out their wishes and enter Oman in the hope of usurping' authority which will provoke disturbances.' ' N ow it is for you to order. 'I trust you may see fit to interfere in this matter and prevent his (Syud Salim's) leaving the island he is residing on until such time as Colonel Ross^ reply is received, or let us proceed thither for this purpose since I fear delay in this matter will end in disaster, as I am cognizant of the duplicity of the people of Oman/' Major Miles added the following remarks :— ' On receipt of His Highness' letter I personally communicated with him, and he informed me that the intrigue to bring Salim again into Oman was commenced by the Benj Boo Ali, El Jerebeh, and other Ghafiree tribes in the south-east, who had invited him thither and promised him support. Salim had at first declined to come, but ultimately he agreed that if his pension were stopped or paid irregularly he would accept the invitation. ' His Highness added that Sheikh Abdoolla bin Salim of the Beni Boo Ali who* had recently visited Muscat, had intended to have proceeded to Kishm with the object of bringing Salim thence with him, but had been dissuaded from his purpose in this by Sheikh Majid bin Hamad. ' Sheikh Ali bin Khalfan El Jeneybi has also engaged in this intrigue and went to Sohar with the intention of returning to Jaalan overland through Dhahireh and Oman and inciting the Ghafiree tribes en route to join the coalition. Syud Toorkee, however, having learnt his intentions despatched orders to Sohar to have him sent back. This All bin Khalfan a short time previous had offered his services to His Highness to mediate and effect a reconciliation with the Beni Riyam tribe, but Toorkee had declined the offer, and hence it is supposed his resentment and determination to intrigue against him. ' His Highness said that Syud Salim would probably first try and get across to the Sternal Coast, Shargah, or Debaye, and eventually come down to Soor to join his friends in Jaalan. ' There is little fear, I think, of Salim being able to oust his uncle, Toorkee, even if he should land in Oman, as he is too well known in the country, but his presence would indubi tably cause unceasing disturbances and uneasiness, and tend greatly to unsettle the country besides causing His Highness increased expenditure in counteracting his operations.' 333. Colonel Ross telegraphed to know whether ' Government would wish any endeavours made to prevent Salim crossing to Oman or to arrest him if found at sea,' and was referred to the previous orders, in which he was informed that Syud. Salim might be apprehended wherever it might be in his power to arrest him. He was also informed that ^as regards the Sheikh of Kishm, there was no evidence of the Chiefs complicity in Syud Salim's intrigues, and moreover it would not be in the power of this Government to interpose even if such complicity were established.' 334. On the 5th February 1875 Syud Toorkee addressed a further letter to the Political Asrent, in which he stated that it Political a.. may 1875, ^ 303-304. become known to him for certain that the Omanees were still in correspondence with Syud Salim, and w-ere 'inviting him to the country for the purpose of stirring up rebellion.' No action seems to have been taken on this letter, nor have any overt designs of Syud Salim yet been reported. 335. Proposed release of Syud Khaleefa bin Saeed from confinement at Zanzibar. —On the 12th June 1874 the Resident in the Persian Gulf forwarded a khureeta from the Sultan Political A.. July 1874. Nos. 324-326. of ^ ^ of His Excel l ency the Viceroy, in which His Highness solicited the aid of the Government of India in obtaining the release from confinement at Zanzibar of his brother, Khaleeta bin Saeed, and intimated that if Syud Burgash did not wish him to remain at Zanzibar, he had no objection to his removal to, and residence at, Muscat. 75 u336. The facts connected with Khaleefa's imprisonment are briefly as At the beginning of 1872 during the absence of SyndBurgash Sultan of Zanzibar, on a pilgrimage to Mecca, byud Khaleefa Political A., May 1872, No. 105. formed the design of seizing on the Government with the assistance of some of the Chiefs of the native soldiery and the Omanee Arabs This plot was, however, frustrated by the Regent, who intercepted a note in Syud Khaleefa s handwriting and under his seal, in which he promised the heads' of the Oman mercenaries higher pay and more lucrative posts if they would loin him in overthrowing the Government of Syud Burgash For this act Syud Khaleefa was arrested and placed m irons by the Regent. On the return of Syud Burgash, His Highness declined to release his brother m con- finement and he had remained a prisoner until the date of byud loorkees khureeta which was forwarded to the Acting Political Agent at Zanzibar m view of his ascertaining from the Sultan whether he was willing to comply with Syud Toorkee's wish to procure the release of his brother. , 337 Captain Prideaux reported on the 23rd September 1874 that on PoWici 4., Number 1874. No*, bringing the matter to the notice of Syud Burgash, 283-285. His Highness told him that some months previ ously he had offered permission to'his brother to retire to Muscat, but that the latter had refused to do so, and insisted on either remaining at Zanzibar, or at one of the coast towns, such as Lamu or Mombasa. His Highness then asked if the Political Ag®nt would like to see his brother, Khaleefa, and on Captain Prideaux assenting, he ordered the young Syud to be summoned to the palace. 338. The appearance of the young Prince, who was brought in irons to the palace, is described as squalid and miserable to the last degree. Captain Pri deaux found it exceedingly difficult to ascertain what his wishes were. He said that if he went to Muscat, he feared he would be subjected to the same treat ment at the hands of his brothers, Toorkee and Abdool Azeez, as he was then undergoing at Zanzibar; and when he was assured that there was no fear of this, so long as he behaved himself with propriety, he said he wished to place himself under British protection. The Political Acjent assured him that this was impossible, as the British Government only intervened in the matter out of friendship lor the children of Syud Saeed; and the interview then came to an end. 339. A copy of Captain Prideaux's despatch Avas forwarded to the Res'dent in the Gulf for communication to Syud Toorkee, whose khureeta was acknowledged by His Excellency the Viceroy. , 340. On receipt of this khureeta, Syud Toorkee expressed his thanks and Political a ., January 1875, Nos. acknowledgment for the kind mediation of Govern- 124-125. ment in the matter, and observed that he had merely wished to do his brother Khaleefa, whom he had never seen, a kindness in offering him an asylum at Muscat, but that his motives and good intentions had been misunderstood by his brother, and as the latter was unwilling- to leave Zanzibar, he had nothing further to say on the subject. 341. On the question being referred by the Secretary of State for o ivr i no*- xt onoo Foreign Affairs for the opinion of Dr. Kirk, that Secret, March 187o, I^os. 30-33. nr&gt; , , i orhcer stated :— ' I am quite sure that we will be more glad than the Sultan of Zanzibar to get rid of Syud Khaleefa, but I think that, under the circumstances, Syud Toorkee of Muscat should be made in some way responsible for the good conduct of his brother if he takes him under his protection,. ' There is one thing, however, to be kept in mind, that Syud Khaleefa is without means of support, having- squandered his small patrimony in the attempt against his brother; and that if he retires to Muscat, we shall in all probability have the Sultan of Muscat urging all manner of claims for money said to be owing to this youth by the Sultan of Zanzibar. u 1 think Captain Prideaux has acted judiciously, as reported in his letters, in confining his action to a simple presentation of the request of the Sultan of Muscat, but unless Syudrfii 77 wOil ^1, life orat asW ftaiii ace, totiie Pri- esaij tat- tea ot bffl !fl?eni- 16 ^ ii0 M iW y- Khaleefa is now willing to leave the country, and give some pledge that he will not renew his attempt against the Government of Zanzibar, it will be difficult 'for the Sultan to leave behind him an open enemy and rival at the very time he again proposes quitting his dominions on a visit to Europe. ' It is well known that the Ruler of Muscat is ever ready to intrigue against Zanzibar just as the Sultan of Zanzibar has too often taken advantage of political difficulties at Muscat but if there is any one point clear in the line of policy we ought to pursue in dealing with these States, it is this, that the further separated in every way these two kingdoms are, the better it will be for our endeavours in suppressing the slave-trade. ' I am of opinion that if the Indian Government take any active measures in gfettino- Syud Khaleefa liberated and removed to Muscat, they will be to some extent also responsible for the consequences, but I think that Syud Burgash will liberate his younger brother and allow him to go out of the country if he should so desire. I believe also he would even now allow him to live in Zanzibar on a solemn assurance of his not renewing any attempt to usurp the Government. But if this should be during the Sultan's absence in Europe, I would, as the British Agent practically responsible for the peace, ask- that he be placed directly under my authority and liable to arrest, if he made»any attempt similar to that which now causes the Sultan to keep him prisoner. ' I may remark that the condition of Syud Khaleefa derives its only importance from the possibility of his succeeding to the throne in event of the death of the present Sultan.' 342. The Political Agent at Zanzibar, on being made acquainted with the decision of Syud Toorkee in the matter, stated that Syud Burgash assured him that it was not his wish to confine his brother, but that as he declined to go to Muscat and would give no assurance for his peaceable conduct if allowed his freedom in Zanzibar, he was under the painful necessity of keeping him a prisoner ; and Dr. Kirk con., curred in thinking that although Syud Khaleefa is wanting in decision of char acter, it would be extremely dangerous to allow him his freedom on the eve of the Sultan's departure for Europe. As to the treatment of Syud Khaleefa during the absence of Syud Burgash, much must depend upon who the Regent Political A., May 1875, No. 297. left in charge might be. 343, SECTION IV. Political A., June 1874, Nos. 58-62. Outrages upon Brtish subjects at Hellaneea in the Kooria Mooria Islands.-— On the 23rd Feb ruary 1874 the Political Resident at Aden reported to the Political Agent at Muscat the circumstances connected with an outrage said to have been committed by some Soorees on Hellaneea, one of the Kooria Mooria Islands, which were ceded to Her Majesty Queen Victoria by the Imam of Muscat on the 14th July 1854. The facts as gathered from a letter addressed by one Ahmed Abdoollah at Macullah to Issac Hossein, an inhabitant of Aden, are as follows :— ' Two buggalows commanded by Nakodas Nathoo Sirjee and Noor Mahomed, supposed to be subjects of the Gaekwar and the Rao of Cutch, left Aden about December last, and touched at Hellaneea. When they were at the latter place a boat belonging to one of the buggalows was lowered, into which both the Nakodas entered, and with some of the men made for the purpose of searching for water. ' Immediately on landing they are said to have been attacked by a body of Soorees, who made five of them prisoners, the remaining men having managed to make their escape with the boat and to rejoin the buggalows. ' After a detention of couple of hours the Soorees offered to restore the prisoners to liberty on receiving a ransom of $ 300. One of the Nakodas, Noor Mahomed, stated that he had the amount on board, whereupon permission was given him to go with one man to fetch the money, whilst the remaining three were still kept in custody. On reaching his vessel in safety, Noor Mahomed feared to return to shore lest all should be killed, and he therefore set sail from that place, taking with him in company the 2nd buggalow and leaving the three prisoners to their fate. General Schneider added that he had communicated with Admiral Oum- minof. desiring him to call at the Kooria Mooria Islands, to see if any of the • 1 TT 11 Indians referred to were known to be at Hellaneea. 77 u 1 iy Hii lli '* On receiving the a,bove report, the Political Agent at Muscat addressed Syud Toorkee on the subject, requesting him to make a strict enquiry into the matter at Soor, and asking for the production of the captives if they had been taken there. His Highness accordingly despatched one Saeed bin Mussalim El- Mawallee to Soor, who confirmed the report regarding the outrage and the cir cumstances connected therewith, as had previously been reported. The attack, it was ascertained, was made by the Jaaferah of El-Askharah, a sub-tribe of the Beni Boo Ali, and it was feared that the men had been murdered or made away with, as there was no trace of them to be discovered at Soor. 344. On the 30th April, Major Miles reported that he had received fur ther information respecting the outrage at Hellaneea, from which it appeared that the three Cutchees were not killed by the El-Jaaferah, but that shortly after the departure of the two Kotias, another Kotia arrived there from Aden, and that the El-Jaaferah having obtained $250 from this vessel, sent the three men on board her. Major Miles added the following particulars 'There were seven boats of the EI- Jaaferah engaged in the affair•! understand, and the . . names of the Nakodas of six of these are given .in the siSln K U huTfan b a in Mussalim, margin. His Highness Synd Toorkee informs me that on Nairn Wh Mnftar. the return of the boats to El-Askharah and the affair becom- Khamis bin Joomn. i n g. known, the two Chief Sheikhs of the Beni Boo Ali, viz., Mussalim Okb wnllnd Khamas. Abdoollah bin Salim and Majid bin Hamad, seized the men implicated in the manner and mulcted them in a small sum by way of punishment. ' The El-Jaaferah are one of the principal sub-tribes of the Beni Boo Ali, and are said to number about one thousand five hundred men. Their head-quarters are at El-Askharah, a town with a small fort about 50 miles south of Ras-el-Had, but they also extend a consider able distance along the coast. Their employment is fishing for sharks, seer-fish, &amp;c., which they salt and export in great quantity to Soor, Maculla, and other ports, and they were actually engaged in fishing at Hellaneea when the occurrence took place. The Kooria Mooria Islands are said to be much frequented for this purpose by the coast tribes almost throughout the year. The El-Jaaferah have no trading buggalows, but a number of large fishing boats. El-Askharah alone owns about 40 of these. ' I have communicated with His Highness the Sultan on the subject of punishing the perpetrators of the outrage, but His Highness does not appear to consider himself in a posi tion to coerce the tribe. Any attempt on his part to do so would probably not only be unavailing, but also result in irritating the Beni-Boo Ali and estranging them from him. ' The coast tribes appear in general to be peaceful and well conducted on the sea; at least I am unable after enquiry to hear of a similar outrage having occurred before. It is however, I respectfully submit, very important that serious notice should be taken of this affair in order to prevent a recurrence, as, if the tribes find they can attack trading buggalows with impunity, they may be encouraged to continue and increase their depredations/' The Government of India, in acknowledging receipt of the correspondence, considered that it was important to make the ofifending tribe understand that such offences on British subjects would not be allowed to pass unnoticed. 345. In a further letter, dated the 11th June, Major Miles stated that he Politic! a ., August 1871. Nos. 12.18. c o nsidere i d t he evidence in the ease sufficiently com- plete, and that it proved that a piratical outrage had been committed by a party of Arabs on British subjects, within British territory, involving personal injury and a loss of property to the amount of about $350, He added :— ''The guilty parties are well known, and the names of the chief men concerned have been obtained. They are easily accessible to us, and I would respectfully urge the extreme expedi ency of bringing them to account and punishing them for the offence without much delay. Six months have already elapsed since the affair occurred, and if the S. A. Coast Arabs once get possession of the idea that they can commit such attacks with impunity, they may give cousiaerabie trouble before they are checked, and the confidence of the owners of country craft in the secuuty of these seas would be for a time destroyed/' 346. The matter was also brought to the notice of the Government of Bombay by the Kao oi CuU-h, who asked for compensation for the traders and the removal of the pirates. o 17. Coionel Ross was informed by the Government of India that it would a\\ait the result of an interview he proposed to hold with the Sultan on 78* # the subject, and that in the event of Syud -Toorkee deciding to adopt coercive measuies against the tribe His Excellency in Council authorized him to offer by tiie Guff &amp;Vmad ron' 0 Brifclsh Government so far as it could be afforded 348. On the 30th July the Eesident in the Gulf reported that he had Political a., August 1874, Nos. 269-271. requested the Political Agent at Muscat to address Chiefs 0 f the Beni Boo All tribe to ascertain if they would undertake to obtain redress from the perpetrators of the outrage In 11 ^ een Q d ?. ne ' and an answ^ had been received from Majid bin Hamad and Abdoolla bin Salim, two of the Sheikhs, to the eftect that they would endeavour to pums i the peipetrators of the outrage and recover the plundered property, but both Major Miles and Colonel Ross we're of opinion that, notwithstanding these professions no reparation cDuld be exacted from the tribe without actual compul sion, or at least a threat of coercion. Colonel Ross recommended therefore that as soon as the season allowed the Political Agent should proceed with one of Her Majesty's vessels and demand from the El-Jaaferah tribe payment of the amount stolen from the lndians, or the surrender of the culprits and their boats; and that if they failed to comply, the fishing boats of the tribe should be seized. 1 he (government of India approved of these measures, and enquired what His Highness the Sultan proposed to do in the matter. 349. The Resident telegraphed on the 12th September that the Political Political a., SeptemBer 1874, Xos. Agent had proceeded to Askharah in Her Majesty's ^ &gt;1 ''f' . Philomel and had demanded reparation from the J aaferan tribe tlnougli tho Sl101k.l1 of tliG Boni Boo All for the outrage XI ib Arabs being unwilling to yield the offenders to punishment, had submitted to pay a fine of $600, and had promised future good behaviour. These proceed ings were approved of by the Government of India. 350. The details were as follows ;—^-Colonel Ross found on conferring' with Political a., November 1874, No. 208. tl:ie Slll . tan ^at His Highness was not in a position to obtain redress tor the misconduct of the Jaaferah tribe, his relations with the south-east Ghafiree tribes not being satisfactorv. Thinking it therefore unadvisable to press the Sultan on the subject. Colonel Ross instructed Major Miles to take whatever steps were practicable and expe dient in the matter, and the Political Agent after communicating with Syud Abdool 4-zeez, and ascertaining thet there were no apprehensions of disturbance or other difficulty, determined to proceed in H. M. S. Philomel without delay in order to reach Askharah before the season opened. Major Miles proceeds :— Saeed bin Mussalim, the person who had been despatched to Soor by His Highness Syud Toorkee in the first instance to investigate the case, was appointed by Syud Abdool Azeez to accompany me and assist in communicating with the tribe. '' I arrived at Soor on the 1st instant, and was glad .to bear that the Jaaferah boats had not yet put to sea, but were expected to do so in a few days. I was informed that when they depart the rest of the inhabitants of El-Askherah betake themselves to the interior, so that had I arrived too late it would have been necessary to postpone operations for another twelve months. After communicating with the Governor of Soor, Syud Nasir bin Mohamed A1 Bu Saeedee, whom Syud Abdool Azeez bad directed to afford me every assistance in his power, I wrote to the Sheikhs of the Beni Boo Ali, Majid and Abdoolla, requesting them, if they were sincere in their protestations of good-will towards the British Government, to meet me at El-Askherah and use their influence in inducing the Jaaferah to comply with our just demands. ' On reaching El-Askherah the Sheikhs, Abdoolla bin Salim and Eusof bin Ali, came on board, the other Sheikh Majid having been unable to leave home through illness. None of the El Jaaferah accompanied them, but the Sheikhs said the Jaaferah had left everything in their hands. ' I then informed the Sheikiis of the complaint made by the crews of the two vessels attacked at Hellaneea an .i of my instructions to obtain reparation for the outrage. The Sheikhs in reply said the explanation offered by the Jaaferah was to the effect that when the crews of the two Kotias landed at Hellaneea to get water a disturbance arose among them, and the Arabs seeing this went to interfere and stop the quarrel, but the Kotia men misunder standing their object became frightened, fled to their boats and tried to get away. 79 v80 « ' T told the Sheikhs that the Jaaferah's story was neither plausihle nor erediMe that the Taaferah had broke, the peace of the seas and wantonly attacked two trad.ng vessels belonging Jaateran naa nro i , ire4 th(J restitution of the plundered property and the to Indian prote. ^ v ^ u . Us who had been concerned in the outrage. The Sheikhs admit- rfthft tW Jaaferah had obtained a considerable pluhder at Hellaneea, and said that the tribe could offer no ^pposltion, but submitted to the demands of Government whatever they might be They requested until the next day, however, to consult with the tribe, which was of course ' On the Sheikhs returning on board the following day, they said that the offenders, six in number had at first consented to surrender tbemselves and produce the plunder, but that durin' tbe'nigbt they bad tied from the town and escaped into the interior Sojne of the tribe had however, gone after them and would, it was expected. Wing them back Ihe Sheikhs added that the Jaaferah had never committed themselves before and that the rest of the tnbe greatly regretted the affair, and that they had promised either to deliver up the offenders or the vessels belonging' to tbem for confiscation. •- &gt; | It is one of the good traits of the Arab that men of the same tribe generally stand by •md shield each other in misfortune, and it was evident to me that the escape ol the offenders was a concerted affair. Captain Garforth was of opinion that it would be impracticable to tow the boats as they were unseaworthy at the time from being so long on shore, and that an attempt to do so would cause their destruction. These boats vary from ten to thirty tons and are worth from two hundred to five hundred dollars each, and I resolved not to interfere with them except as a last resource. I therefore informed the Sheikhs that as the offenders were not forthcoming, 1 imposed a fine on them for the outrage of dollars six hundred, which the Sheikhs at once expressed their readiness to pay. ' I waited another day at El-Askherah, but the Sheikhs were unable to raise the money, as it was found the town could only produce about two hundred or three hundred dollars in cash and jewels, and it was therefore arranged that the Sheikhs and the headmen of the Jaaferah should come in the Philomel to Soor to borrow the money on their own security. The Jaaferah people in return engaging themselves not to proceed to sea this season, or to water their date trees and gardens until the money was repaid. The date groves were also to remain mortgaged to the Sheikhs as a further security. ' I accordingly returned to Soor, where the fine was produced by the Sheikhs, and I then informed them that the matter was at an end, but I pointed out the serious notice Government had taken of the offence, and warned them that a repetition of it would lead to very severe measures being taken. The Jaaferah men said that they were fully convinced of the folly and error of their tribesmen in the matter, and solemnly promised that nothing of the kind should occur again, as they had no desire to get into trouble with the British Government, and the punishment they had received would be remembered by them for a long time. I impressed on the Sheikhs the advisability of recovering the fine from the offenders themselves instead of distributing it over the tribe, as is usually done; the Sheikhs and headmen assui^i me they fully intended to do so, and would not assist in the least/' 351. The Government of India, after acknowledging the service of Major Political A., November 1874, No. IVIlleS and of Captain Cxill toi'th, of H. iVI. 207, and January 1875, No. 92A. Philomel, directed that after making a rateable pay ment out of the fine in satisfaction of a claim for compensation advanced by the Joonaghur State on behalf of certain of its subjects who had sustained losses by the outrage, the balance should be handed over to Syud Toorkee. 352. On the 13th November 1874 Major Miles reported that he had tj v.- i * at terr- xt ^ addressed the Political Agent in Kattiawar on the subject of the claims for compensation submitted by the subjects of the Joonaghur State, and had remitted the sum of Rupees 630-12-9 in satisfaction of the claim; and on the 6th March 1875 he stated that having received a letter from the Political Agent in Kattiawar to the effect that there were no further outstanding claims, the balance of the fine, amounting to $309-97 cents., had been paid over to His Highness the Sultan in accordance with the instructions of Government. 353. The Secretary of State was of opinion that the Government ot Political A., January 1875, No. 126. India ' rightly decided not to add to the embarrassments of the Sultan of Muscat by insisting on his active co-operation with the Political Agent in the measures which were adopted against the offending tribe/' and he concurred with the Government of India in thinking the enforcement of a fine of $600, and the promise of future good behaviour which was obtained from the Arabs, to be a satisfactory settlement of the affair.81 354. Levy of Customs and Transhipment duties at Mus cat.— In July 1871 an applicatioa was made by Messrs. Gray, Paul and Co. of Bushire, through the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, that the tran- Revenue, jane 1873, No. 3. shipment duties then in force at Muscat should be removed, inese duties were levied m con formity with an arrangement concluded between Colonel Pelly and the Sultan of Muscat in September 1867, to the effect that all cargo by the British India Steam Navigation Steamers transhipped or landed for transhipment should be subject to &amp;xiad valorem duty of 10 annas per cent., or that seven-eighths of the duty (5 per cent.) should be returned in the event of any shipment being made after the cargo had been landed. 355. The increase of competition having reduced freights to the lowest profitable point, the London correspondents of Messrs. Gray, Paul and Co. wrote that unless the duty was entirely dispensed with, the idea of making Muscat a transhipment port must be abandoned. 356. The Political Agent, on sounding the Sultan on the subject, found the feeling of the Government of Muscat was not in favour of altering the existing agreements regarding customs duties, and he did not therefore think it advisable to press for a formal answer. The Government of Bombay approved of Major Boss' proceedings, but directed him not to lose sight of the question, should a fitting opportunity for bringing it to the notice of the Muscat Government again occur, as it was of considerable importance that all restric tions which might tend to check the development of our trade in the Gulf should be removed. 357. On the 7th December 1872 Colonel Ross reported that the Sultan had consented to exempt vessels belonging to the British India Steam Naviga tion Company from the payment of any duty on cargo arriving from the Gulf and transhipped into their steamers proceeding to Aden and Zanzibar, the Muscat authorities reserving their right to claim transhipment dues in all other cases. This promise, as regards transhipment by sea, was confirmed by the following letter from the Sultan, dated the 18th February 1873 :— ' In regard to exemption of duty on cargo transhipped at sea to the Zanzibar line of steamers from other mail steamers, according to the arrangement between me and Colonel Ross, I have exempted the duty, and have forbidden the Agent of the Customs to interfere in the saiie, and I will not go back from my word in a thing I have agreed to.' The cordial acknowledgments of the Govern- Revenue, June 18/3, |fo. 19. ment of India were conveyed to Syud Toorkee for this concession. 358. In May 1874 the Resident in the Persian Gulf forwarded copies of Political b .. August 1874. Nos. correspondence relating to the levy of duty upon 84-85. certain goods transhipped from the British India Steam Navigation Company's Steam Ship Gunga. 359. In this case, it appeared the goods were not transhipped hy sea, but were landed and stored for some days. The Sultan expressed his opinion, on the matter being referred to his decision, that duty was leviable, but he consented to remit the sum of Rupees 1,800, leaving a balance of Rupees 3,056 still payable. This was handed by the Agent of the Company to the Political Agent under protest, and the orders of Government were solicited in the matter. The view taken by the Sultan was upheld by the Government of India on the ground that the concession only applied to Political B., August 1875. No. 86. trans}lipped by sea&gt; 360. The next question that arose upon this subject was whether duty was leviable on goods landed from a vessel putting Political a.. may 1875. nos. 3 h 3^3, Muscat through stress of weather, and reshipped in a different vessel, in consequence of the original vessel having sunk or become unseaworthy.82 361. After some discussion with the Sultan, who at first was not disposed to admit that the rules made by his father, Syud Saeed, in 1846, were in force in Muscat, His Highness consented to forego all claim to duty even in the case of a vessel putting into Muscat for repairs, and reshipping her cargo in a different bottom. The translated purport of tlie instrument passed by Syud Toorkee is as follows :— cc j j iave received your letter of the 2nd instant, and have understood its contents, j abide by the agreement made by my father with the British Government regarding 1 the customs duties leviable^on goods landed from distressed vessels. For example if a vessel that puts into Muscat for repairs lands her cargo in order to undergo such repairs, and reships her cargo or puts it into another vessel, I forego all claim to duty for the sake of the unity between us and the British Government, and will raise no question concerning such goods, even though such were liable to duty in the time of our ancestors. The acknowledgments of the Government of India were conveyed to the Sultan for his friendly conduct on this occasion, and a report made to the Secretary of State. 362. Suppression of the Slave-Trade at Muscat— The Poli tical Agent reported, on the 2nd October 1874, that the Treaties concluded in 1873 with the Sultans of Muscat and Zanzibar for the lohticai B.,Novcmb« 18/4, No. i. more e ff eC tual suppression of the slave-trade had resulted satisfactorily, as no importations had taken place that season to Oman and the Persian Gulf. Her Majesty's. Ships Hifieman and JPhilomel had watched for sometime the entrance to the Gulf near Ras-el-Hadd, and had boarded a number of dhows, but had made no captures; nor was there any reason to suspect that slaves had been landed on the coast. Her Majesty's Ship Daphne had also cruized along the southern coast of Arabia, and had searched a large number of vessels, but had not met with any slaves. Major Miles added that he had opportunities of extending his own personal enquiries along the coast of Oman, and he was confident that importation for the present had wholly ceased. 363. Muscat claim to Charbar .—On the 17th October 1874 the political a., December 1874, nos. Resident in the Gulf forwarded two khureetas from 140 ' 144 - Syud Toorkee, addressed respectively to the Secretary of State and to the Viceroy and Governor-General, upon the subject of the claims of Muscat upon Charbar, which His Highness was under the impression had come within the purview of the Commissioner appointed for the settlement of the Mekran boundary. The following is the purport of the khureetas :— To Marquis of Salisbury, Principal Secretary of State for India, dated 27th Shaban 1291= 9th October 1874. ' 1 beg to acquaint Your Lordship that when the Commissioner appointed by the British Government for the settlement of the Mekran boundary arrived, and entered upon the duties, no one was present at that time who could advise on our behalf with him, and who could point out the places whicb belonged to us, and hence the country known as Chaibar and belonging to lis was apportioned to Persia. It is possible the Commissioner acted inadvertently in this, or that he was ignorant of the' fact that the abovenamed country descended to us from our ancestors. Out of respect to your Government we have hitherto refrained from asserting our rights to this tract (Charbar), but we are certain you would never consent to this [viz., that Persia should deprive us of our rights]. ' Certainly the British Government and the Oman Government are one, and our trust in all matters is centered in you. Now our hope from the great Government is that the above- named tract [Charbarj will be restored to us, and incorporated in our dominions as it has been of old. I o remain silent regarding loss of territory and to be indifferent about it is improper. e place unbounded trust in the British Government, and it was necessary for us to represent this matter to you' io Lord Northbrook, Viceroy and Governor-General of India, dated 27th Shaban 1291= 9th October 1874.' I beg to acquaint Your Lordship that when the Commissioner appointed by the British Government for the settlement of the Mekrari boundary arrived, and entered upon his duties, no one was present at that time who could advise on our behalf with him, and who could point out the places which belonged to us, and hence the country known as Charbar and belonging- to us was apportioned to Persia. It is possible that the Commissioner acted independently in this, or that he was ignorant oi the 'iact that the abovenamed country descended to us from our ances tors. Out of respect to your Government we have hitherto refrained from asserting our rights to this tract (Charbar), but we are certain you would never consent to this {viz., that Persia should deprive us our rights). ' Certainly the British Government and the Oman Government are one, and our trust in all matters is centered in you. Now our hope from the great Government is that the abovenamed tract [CharbarJ will be restored to us, and incorporated in our dominions as it has been from of old. To remain silent regarding loss of territory and to be indifferent about it is improper. We place unbounded trust in the British Government, and it was necessary for to represent this matter to yon.' 364. In reply, the Political Agent was instructed to acquaint Syud Toor- kee that there was ' no foundation for the idea that the port of Charbar was apportioned to Persia on the settlement of the Mekran boundary, Charbar was excluded altogether from General Gold- smid's consideration by definite instruction, on the express ground that Muscat was not repre sented on the Commission. The proceedings of the Commission in no way affected any matter in dispute between Persia and Muscat. ' The Political Agent should remind His Highness that on a former occasion the British Government declined to interfere in respect to Charbar, and should inform him that it cannot interfere now. At the same time the Political Agent should use his endeavours to dissuade the Sultan from coming to a collision with Persia, w t -.o** xt Those explanations were ' personally and care- Pohfcl A, M. r 1875, Nos.

Colonel Ross reported General B., April 1874, No. 48. , -i , i i i i i r i . that a couple oi horses had been presented to Major Miles, and a horse and other articles to himself, an4 stated that he haa ordered the horses to be sent to Bombay for disposal. In reply, he was requested to state what return presents would be acceptable to His Highness. 366. The Political Agent on the 21st March reported that he had sold one horse to Admiral Gumming for Rupees 400, and that the Sultan had con sented to receive back the one presented to Colonel Ross. Shortly afterwards the Political Agent reported that the Sultan had presented him with a double- barrelled fowling piece, which he was instructed to forward to the Toshakhana. 367. In return for the presents, the value of which he estimated at Rupees 3,000, Colonel Ross recommends that General B., Feb. 1875, Nos. 35-42. . , i n i i j 1 x x u either two brass field guns and a rocket-tube, or a first class steam-launch, should be given to Syud Toorkee. 368. It was ultimately decided to present the Sultan with two 6-pounder bronze guns with carriages and limbers complete, and two rocket-tubes for sea and land service respectively, at a total cost of about Rupees 3,375, and request was accordingly made to the Government of Bombay to supply the necessary articles. SECTION V. 869. Position and future prospects of Syud Toorkee at the end Of 1874 —On the 16th October Major Miles submitted an interesting Political A,, December 1874, Nos. report UpOIl the position aild prospects of CJj ud, 116 - 119 - Toorkee at Muscat. As this paper gives a remmt of events at Muscat since the accession of Syud Toorkee in January 1871, and 83 Waffords an insight into the personal character of His Highness, it may be useful to quote it in extenso : * 'For the first three years of Syud Toorkee's rule since his succession in January 1871 to tbe commencement of the present year, the only serious rivalry and opposition His Hig-lmess had to contend with was his nephew Syud Salim bin Thoweynee, who endeavoured to oust his uncle and recover possession of the throne from which he had been driven by Azan bin Ghais. In December 1873, however, Salim, tired of the struggle, retired to India, Syud Toorkee was left in undisputed possession, and the country enjoyed comparative tranquillity. Up to this time Syud Toorkee had suffered great pecuniary embarrassment owing to the insufficiency of his revenue to cover expenditure. Being an open-handed man, unaccustomed to control his monetary affairs, and having a Minister who was as unscrupulous as he was rapacious, his diffi culties only increased. The Minister, Thoweynee bin Mahomed, however seems to have been an able man and contrived to keep the tribes quiet and the country in fair order notwithstanding. Thoweynee was dismissed in December 1872 and was not replaced. Shortly after, early in 1873, His Highness, through Sir B. Frere's mission, received the guarantee of the Zanzibar subsidy and payment of th- arrears that had accrued. Here was Toorkee's great opportunity had he but availed himself of it to consolidate his power, and establish himself firmly in his position. He was however, too shortsighted apparently to see the value of his husbanding his resources and forming a reserve, or too Weak to control himself, and so long as the money lasted there was an unceasing flow to the interior. The tribes came in in shoals for presents, and their demands being complied with they remained quiet and contented. The subsidies paid half-yearly to the tribes were raised to nearly double what they had been in the days of Syud Saeed. This was the palmy time of Syud Toorkee's rule, but it could not last. A bad feature was .that having no Minister or influential adviser to guide him he had to depend on menials and low favorities for advice and counsel and thus estranged his chief friends and supporters. Matters were in this state when in January 1874 Syud Toorkee was prostrated by a painful and dangerous illness, and rumours having been spread of his death. Sheikh Saleh bin Ali Et-Haritliee, who had been Wazeer at Muscat during the reign of Azan bin Ghais, and Syud Toorkee^s most bigoted enemy, made a sudden descent on Muscat in the hope of taking it by surprise and with a view of regaining the sovereignty for the Azan branch of the family, a young scion of which he brought with him for the purpose. After a bloody conflict outside Muttra with His Highness' troops, in which Saleh bin Ali was victorious, he occupied that town for several days, and was thence enabled to dictate most humiliating terms to which Syud Toorkee was compelled to accede. Sheikh Saleh's bold stroke at Muscat was thus eminently successful, and though its final aspect was that of a mere plundering raid, it had a strange influence on the political situation of Oman, and has affected Syud Toorkee's position and policy in a marked degree. From this time the real weakness and precariousnese of Syud Toorkee^s grasp of power became at once apparent to the whole country, and his resources having now dwindled very low, disturbances and internal commotions arose everywhere, and for a considerable time His Highness' position was undoub tedly highly Critical. A direct result of Saleh's raid has been singularly enough to separate Syud Toorkee from his old friends and allies, the Ghafirees, and to cause him to ally himself with the Hinawee division. It was the Beni Boo Ali and other Ghafiree tribes who put His Highness on the Sultanate by a successful attack on Azan bin Ghais, and the connection had hitherto been firmly maintained. During Salens occupation of Muttra however not a single Ghafiree came to His Highness' assistance, though, if they had been so inclined, a large body of them could have marched to Muttra within a few hours. Since this affair Saleh's influence appears to have been predominant with Syud Toorkee, and the Hinawee alliance is an accepted fact. All the Ghafiree guards and garrisons have been dismissed, and Hinawees everywhere substituted. Whether this has been a politic step on His Highness' part remains to be seen; to many well informed persons it seems that he has simply lost old friends without gaining new ones, as now both distrust him. Another important result affecting Syud Toorkee's position and the state of parties generally has been the armed support by sea accorded to His Highness by the British'Government and the effect of the aid so given in tranquillizing the country and putting down rebellion. Unfortunately no vessel of war had been present in time to avert the loss and humiliation suffered through Saleh's raid, but it was promised to him for the future against rebels, and it is probably chiefly through the assistance he has received ' l The decision of Government of that he has been able to maintain his position 1 at all. Muscat had hardly recovered its equilibrium after the shock of Sheikh Saleh's raid when Syud Ibrahim bin Ghais, who fortunately had not acted entirely in concert with Saleh in January, deemed it an excellent opportunity to emulate the example of his late brother Azan and endeavour to wrest the power from Toorkee's hand. With this object, and seconded by Syud Hamad bin El Imam, lately become a rancorous enemy of Syud Toorkee, he placed himself at the head of the Bati- nah tribes, who have always shown themselves more favorable to that branch of the reigning family, and soon succeeded in gaining possession of the town and fort of Mesnaah, the India to help Toorkee actively so far as guns of ships-of-war would reach was of course made known to His Highness, and undoubtedly by encour aging His Highness and his friends and damping the hopes of his enemies mainly conduced to the continuance of His Highness' rule. The decision, though not in the form of a promise, would be looked on by the Sultan as the settled policy adopted in his behalf, and he will look for similar support in future emergencies.— (Sd.) E. C. Ross.'85 seaport of El-Rostak, and consequently a place of much importance to him. Here liowever his career was stayed. In capturing- Mesnaah the British traders there were plundered and maltreated by his men and one killed, which occasioned the active interference of Govern ment. Syud Ibrahim was dislodged from Mesnaah, the fort was bombarded and destroyed by the Political Resident with three ships-of-war, and subsequently, on proceeding- to enforce the demand for reparation for British losses, the Political Resident succeeded at the same time in breaking up the coalition of the rebel tribes in the Batinah, in effecting a reconciliation between Syud Toorkee and the rebel Yal Saad, and in entirely dissevering the connection between those tribes and Syud Ibrahim, whereby the latter has been so much discouraged that he has since made peace with His Highness, and has been granted an allowance on promise of future ' l His Highness had up to this s ^ mission - At one time, in April last, Syud Toorkee's tenure period thought of abdicating in despair power was so insecure that he resolved on recalling his of being able to carry on the Govern- brother Abdool Azeez from India and associating- him with ment.

On the other hand, there is no doubt Abdool Azeez's presence has been a source of strength to Toorkee, and Abdool Azeez has created a good impression in his favor in the - Family jealousies form a charac- country so far as the Arabs have come in contact with teristic feature in the history of the mm. otill oyud loorkee is certainly jealous ot him, and I Alboo Syud dynasty.--(Sd.) E.G. Ross/' fancy that something like mutual distrust still exists between them. 2 ' It thus will have been seen that Sheikh Saleh's raid, though an insignificant affair per haps in itself, has had most striking and important effects on Syud Toorkee^s position and policy ever since and in discovering the real flimsiness of Toorkee^s tenure of rule, has been the prime cause of all rebellions and internal commotions that have since agitated the country. All his rivals having been disposed of, and the country again in enjoyment of peace and pros perity, there is no reason why His Highness Syud Toorkee should nofconsolidate his power such as it is, and establish himself more iirmly than he ever has been yet. His rule has never been more general, and extends over the whole of Oman, and there is no part that ev&amp;i claims to be independent of him, though practically of course his power does not extend much beyond Muscat. The chief drawback to his maintaining a firm position consists, in my opinion, in the weakness of his policy and his method of transacting his own business. It was his high reputation for personal daring and courage that made him so great a favorite in former days with the Arabs and led to his successful contest with Syud Azan for the Sultanate, but his character seems to have softened somewhat of late years. His public and avowed policy now is that he gives money only to those he fears and whom he wishes to conciliate, and thus he does not care to waste money on those whom be knows to be his friends and adherents. And His High ness not only declares this but acts upon it consistently; it is not to be wondered at therefore that disturbances are rife when supplies fall short. It is this policy added to his habit of leaning upon low favorites instead of on his relations and influential friends that prevents him attaining the firm and secure position he otherwise would have. There can be little doubt that the aid His Highness has received from Government during these troublous times has had the chief share in tranquillizing the country, and, as it is, Syud Toorkee depends entirely on us for assistance and support in emergencies. Should, therefore, fresh disturbances and coalitions arise in the interior, and Muscat be again threatened, it would be to us that Svud Toorkee would first turn for help and counsel, and though the surface at present is fair \ v n d » and smooth, events follow so quickly in this country that it is ' 3 Vide my Note l .'(Sd.) • • oss. j m p 0SS i^ e to foretell what the morrow may bring forth.

The Government of India acknowledged the interest of this report but called upon Major Miles for an explanation of two passages (italicized) wherein the Political Agent referred to a promise of support accorded to the Sultan by the British Government and His Highness' dependence on that promise. ' The attention of the Marine Department was also invited to the su &lt;iro 'estion that Her Majesty's vessels should under the circumstances reported visit Muscat as frequently as possible, and the Secretary of State was informed accordingly. 371. In reply, Major Miles explained that in using the word promise, he had in mind rather the view that would be Political a ., March 1875. Nos. 531 -534. ^aken by Syud Toorkee himself of the decision ofGovernment regarding the support to be accorded to the Sultan under certain circumstances than the actual terms ot the order itself, inasmuch as assistance having been once lent to him he would naturally look for it again on tutuie occasions, the same time Mai or Miles assured Government that a distinct promise of general and unconditional support was certainly not given by him to Syud Toorkee. This explanation was considered satisfactory by the Government of India. 372. JVlGtowwa movement in Soutli-Eastern Districts of Oman.'On the 24th 'December the Resident in the Persian Gulf telegraphed that the Political Agept at Muscat reported that Political a ., Feb. 1875, Nos. 42-M. an 'extensive movement was in progress in south eastern districts of Oman among priestly faction, and that he considered the , presence of a man-of-war at Muscat desirable. Three days later he again telegraphed to the effect that the Metowwa movement was not progressing, and that there was 'no urgency for man-of-war.' The reasons for the feeling of uneasiness which prevailed with reference to the Metowwa faction are given by Major Miles, under date 12th December 1874. The Political Agent stated ' About five days since one of the Sheikhs o£ the Hijrieen tribe of El-Sharkiyeh, named Bedr bin Mahomed bin Amiri, arrived at Muscat with the object of communicating to His Highness Synd Toorkee that the Moollas or Metowwas of the Hijrieen had for some time past been engaged in endeavouring to stir up a rising of all the tribes on behalf of the priestly faction against Syud Toorkee, and that Sheikh Munsoor of the Wahabee Bedowins who had joined the coalition had actually been to Sheikh Saleh bin Ali El-Harithee with proposals on the subject, but that Saleh had refused to join them on the ground that he was satisfied with Toorkee and intended to keep to his engagements. ' This morning I had a visit from this man, Bedr bin Mahomed, who informed me that the movement was fostered, if not entirely originated, by the Hijrieen Metowwas at the head of whom was Rashid bin Khulfan, who had received $1,600 from Syud Ibrahim bin Ghais for this purpose. He could assign no particular cause for the disaffection beyond a general rest lessness, and the inability of the Arab spirit to remain long quiet under one regime. ' I have not the slightest doubt but that this man Bedr is simply a spy sent here ostensi bly to make professions of friendship, but in reality to observe the state of affairs and to probe the general feeling. I consider it unlikely that Syud Ibrahim has sent any money to Sharkiyfeh as his moves are generally too openly played to remain concealed, but it is highly probable that Feysul bin Hamood has done so, as Bodr bin Mahomed mentioned that a confidential messenger had passed between Rostak and the Hijrieen Mefowwas not long back, and it is becoming generally believed that Feysul bin Hamood in his retirement from political affairs and ostentatious adop tion of austere and sanctimonious life is playing a deep and designing game, with a view to his being chosen by the people for the Imamate in the event of the religious faction coming again into power. ' His Highness Syud Toorkee has despatched a kossid to Sharkiyeh in connection with this matter, and will-doubtless take such steps as he deems expedient.' \PolUical A., February 1875, No. 46.] 373. During the absence of Syud Toorkee the Political Agent had advanced $5,000 from the subsidy, at the request of Abdool Azeez, and on the 20th December Major Miles solicited by telegraph that a further advance of the balance of subsidy due in January might be paid to Syud Toorkee, who had already received fifteen thousand dollars. This payment was authorized under the previous sanction of Government (paragraph 293 of Precis). 374. The further progress of the Metowwa movement was thus described by Major Miles (19th December 1874):— ' The rumour of a coalition in El Sharkiyeh among the priestly faction with a view to the re-establishment of an Imamate is gaining ground in Muscat, and it is now reported that Sheikh Saleh bin Ali has gone to Rostak possibly with the object of concerting measures with Syud Ibrahim or Feysul. ■ • '1 here can no longer be any doubt that an extensive movement is in progress in tte districts of El Sharkiyeh and Oman among those inclined to the Metowwa party and those to whom change and disturbance are always welcome, but it appears as yet to be confined to those districts, as there are no signs of its influence in El Dhahireh, Jaalan, or the Batinah. 86 Political A 48-52. February 1875, Nos.' The aspect of the affair will become more serious if it be the case that Saleh bin Ali has consented to join the Metowwas and identify himself with the enterprise as he has undoubted energy, ability, and influence, and his powerful support will much invigorate and accelerate the organization of the rising. ' There are at present a large number of interior Arabs at Muscat of the Bu Hassan, Beni Boo Ali, A1 Wahibah, Hejrieen, and other tribes, and I believe His Highness Syud Toorkee contemplates retaining some of those men as a garrison or protection for Muscat in the event of the hostile movement assuming more threatening proportions.' And on the 25th of the same month :— ' There have been no fresh rumours of late regarding the movement of the Metowwa faction in El Sharkiyeh, and it appears to have been somewhat checked for a time owing pro bably to the want of support and encouragement from the tribes. The report that Saleh bin Ali had gone to El Rostak to concert measures was premature, as he is still at Kabil in El Sharkiyeh, and so far, outwardly'at least, has not connected himself with the undertaking. ' Syud Mahomed Azan, when calling on me this morning, informed me that Syud Ibrahim had received proposals from the faction to take the lead, but had declined to have any thing to do with it, and it had been consequently determined by the Metowwa to put up one of Syud Azan bin Ghais's sons and to act in his name. The only one now available to their hands is Hamood, the same lad that was brought to Muttra by Saleh bin Ali for a similar purpose last January.' 375. On the 27th December Major Miles reported by telegraph that the Metowwa movement in El-Sharkiyeh was not progressing, and on the 2nd January 1875 he stated that later accounts continued to strengthen this impression, and to show that the movement was not generally viewed with favour throughout the country; but he considered it improbable that it would alto gether subside, as the religious faction would no doubt continue to intrigue and test the feeling of the tribes until a more suitable opportunity presented itself. Nothing however could be expected to occur until after thei Bakaree Eed, which would fall on the 20th January, but after that it would probably become suffi- Political A., February i 8 75. s„. 55. cient, y . apparent whether the Metowwa party felt strong enough to make a serious movement, or considered it advisable to postpone their design for a more fitting season. 376. Notwithstanding these apprehensions, the outward appearance-of the country was tranquil at the close of 1874. The Beni Boo Ali tribe in Jaalan had at length amicably adjusted an intestine feud that had been going on among themselves for some time. The number of slain on each side being equal, each party forgave the other ; and as regarded the wounded (about seventy in number), the blood-money was to be determined by a reference to the Mahomedan law. The only important question that required adjustment was the conflict between the Hinawee and Ghafiree tribes in the provinces of Oman and El-Dhahireh. •v ^ 377. Position and prospects of Syud Toorkee at the com mencement Of 1875. —On the 26th February Major Miles submitted Major Miles' No. 97-45, dated 26th further observations on the position and prospects February 1875. 0 f Syud Toorkee. These remarks will be found of interest :— ' Since I last wrote on His Highness J position and prospects, I consider they have changed for the worse; the feebleness and incertitude of his Government have never been more apparent, and I suppose his tenure of power has never been more insecure than it is at present. ' I have remarked before on llis Highness' dependence on low favorites in preference to more sound advisers. His Highness^ affairs are now managed almost entirely by a man named Mesh, who has more authority in Muscat at present than any one else, and who has charge especially of all pecuniary transactions. This person is a man of the lowest origin and character, and has neither capacity, tact, nor knowledge to recommend him to bis present position. I need hardly add that he makes use of his position for his own advantage, ' f It is this man's advancement and proceedings that have, I think, more than anything else, estranged His Highness' best friends and are the chief cause of His Highness'' unpopalarity, Syud Abdool Azeez and Syud Mahomed Azan, the Walee, now refrain, as much as possible, from giving counsel even when asked, as they do not care about seeing their advice over-' ulcu by one so inferior in every respect to themselves.88 « i believe that the hopes of the people generally are now turned to Syud Abdool Azeez, who by his eireumspect and dignified behaviour during the past ten months, hag succeeded in creating a very favorable impression on all who hav6 come m contact with him. ^ It seems to me most important to separate His Highness from his unworthy advisers and to-iavi^orate his Government, and I consider this would be most effectually and permanently don^ bv advising His Highness to make Syud Abdool Azeez joint ruler with himself as his father 'and uncle were conjoint rulers half a centufy ago. Simply to throw off his favorites would not. I think, be sufficient now, as His Highness has not shown himself a very success ful or vigorous ruler, and the tide of public opinion seems to be setting in against him. ' His Highness is well aware of the present state of affairs and does not disguise it from himself. He informed me on the last interview with him that he had offered to his brother Abdool Azeez to resign the Government in his favor and retire to Gwadur, but that Abdool Azeez had declined to accept it. His Highness is greatly harassed by his pecuniary embarrass ments, and, I think, feels himself unequal to carrying on tiie business of Government alone much longer. He has not, however, requested ray advice on the subject, and what I have submitted is entirely my own; view of his position.' Colonel Bos.' No. 277-123, dated Colonel Ross instructed Major Miles as 6tli March 1875. follows-:—- ' In case His Highness should voluntarily confide in you on the subject of his affairs and ask your advice, it would be proper to state the opinion you have formed, and which I share, of the dissatisfaction caused by His Highness relying on one person of inferior standing to exclusion of all others of his relations and well-wishers, but should His Highness wish to effect a reform in this matter, it would be best that his choice of advisers should be spontaneous. ' As regards your suggestion of a joint rulership, I think that Government would not wish, even if the proposal came from Syud Toorkee, to be committed to an opinion in favor of the measure, although I have no reason to suppose it would be our duty to oppose it. In case your advice is sought on that, or any equally important matter, you should refer for instructions. At the same time you should, whenever occasion serves, endeavour to promote good-will aad mutual confidence between His Highness Syud Toorkee and his brother Abdool Azeez. 'You will, of course, use all your influence to cheer His Highness to meet and overcome his troubles and dissuade him from any premature relinquishment of his position of Sultan.' » 378. In the letter* cOmraunicatinor the appro- » No. 1200P.,&lt;iated 30th April 1875. i p /-&gt;. ,, . i i /S i val ot Uovernment to the views expressed by Colo nel Ross, the following emphatic passage occurs :— ' It is the decided opinion of the Governor-General in Council that the Political Agent at Muscat will do well to avoid interference in the dynastic and internal affairs of Oman,' No. 100, dated 13th May ie75. a ' d Jn reporting these proceedings to the Secretary of State, it was observed :— ' In the opinion of the Political Agent at Muscat, the state of affairs in Oman has of late grown critical owing chiefly to the weak character of the Sultan, but partly also to the progress of the ' Metowwa' or fanatical faction, and partly to the disputes between the Hinawee and Ghafiree tribes, which Syud Toorkee has hitherto failed to settle, and which may result in an outbreak of civil war. ' Under these circumstances the Political Agent suggested that Abdool Azeez, the brother of Syud Toorkee, should be associated with him in the Government as the best means of propping up the fabric of the State. We are, however, decidedly of opinion that the Sultan should be allowed to manage the internal affairs of his kingdom without inter ference, and that the action of our officers in such matters should be'confined to giving advice when solicited.' 379. Arrangements at Sohar. —Major Miles reported on the 13th Major Miies^ No. 121-58, dated March that Syud Toorkee had recently come to a uth M areh i8 75 fresh arrangement with Syud Bedr bin Saif at Sohar (paragraph. 261), by which His Highness would save about |400 a month, byud Bedr had consented to his monthly pay of $300 being discontinued and the Wahabee garrison of fifty men being reduced to twenty. The revenue of Sohar, about eight or nine thousand dollars yearly, would remain as formerly at byud Bedr s disposal for expenses.89 - SECTION VI. 380. Syud Toorkee's change of policy in substituting Hi- nawee guards for Wahabees. —On the 2nd January 1875 Major Miles ^Political a .. February 1875. Nos. reported that Sjud Toorkee hid for some time past v • , -myr j i b 1 een g™ dmi[] y reducing the strength of the Waha- ? e xP rriSOn f 0 ' and that now dismissed most of the remainder of these men from his service^ replacing them by parties drawn from the various Hmawee tribes, such as the Bern Bu Hassan, El-Hejrieen, &amp;c. The so -called JV aha bees were Arabs from ^ejd and El-Hasa, and at one time numbered about our hundied in Muscat and Muttra; they were good soldiers, and beinor inde pendent of the various factions and parties in Oman, were always considered the real strength of Muscat. 381. The Kesident in the Persian Gulf, in transmitting this report, con- cuiied with Major Miles in considering that, although this measure was one of T 'Vl 16 w 1 c ? m cou ^ on ly be judged of by results, it appeared to be of doubtiul expediency. The advantages of maintaining a standing guard of oreigners was obvious, and, although the change would undoubtedly be popular with the Hmawee tribes, and increase the Sultan's influence with these clans, it would have the eflect of placing him more completely in their power than tormerly. I he matter was, however, one of internal administration, and the Political Agent, in Colonel Koss' opinion, acted rightly in abstaining from advising Jdis Highness either for or against the measure. ^ 382. Disturbances at JVLuscat. — On the 14th May, however, Lieutenant-Colonel Miles reported that Muscat was in a somewhat dis' Lieutenant-Colonel Miles to Laeute- turbed state owing to misunderstandino-s that had Tuh CO MZ el ^L 20 itt^v arisen between Syud Toorkee and the Beni Bu Political Resident, Persian Gulf, No. Hassan tribe, who had made certain demands upon 553-145, dated 28tii May 1875. His Highness which the latter had not satisfied. A. number of this tribe had lately arrived from Jaalan, and although that por tion which was entertained at Muscat on regular pay at first sided with the Sultan against their tribesmen, yet when they found that His Highness had arranged to comply with the demands of the latter, some further difficulty aiose, and His Highness imprudently informed both parties that he considered them all alike, and desired to have nothing more to do w th any of them.' Both parties then made common cause, and declared that, if their demands were not satisfied, they would plunder the town, and leave His Highness to bear the consequences. An affray took place in the town on the night of the 13th May, and two or three men were wounded, hut no plundering^occurred. 383. Flight of Syud Toorkee on board a vessel in Muscat Harbour. —On the morning of the 14th May Syud Abdool Azeez came to Lieutenant-Colonel Miles and informed him that Syud Toorkee had quitted the palace secretly in the dead of night, and had gone no one knew whither, leaving him (Abdool Azeez) to bear the brunt alone. 384. One of Syud Toorkee's advisers, Ibrahim El-Awesi, was then sent tor. This man stated that Syud Toorkee had gone on board a merchant vessel 3 n ^ ie harbour, in a canoe in the night, and that he was then on board. Ibrahim also stated that the Bu Hassan had agreed to behave peaceably and remain quiet, if their present requests were complied with, and if Syud Abdool Azeez would guarantee that Syud Toorkee would fulfil his engagements with them for the future. 385. Acting upon the Political Agent's advice, Abdool Azeez went on board the vessel to induce Syud Toorkee to come on shore and make some arrangement with the tribe. He returned shortly afterwards with full powers from Syud Toorkee to make terms with the Arabs, and with a promise that Syud Toorkee would come on shore as soon as arrangements were concluded.ggaggggggroBHBWoamwwww 886 Lieutenant -Colonel Miles stated that as British interests would suffer most in the event of any disturbance occurring, he wou d insist on His Highness making some sacrifices to preserve peace and order m the town, should the effects of Ahdool Azeez to effect an arrangement prove unavailing. In the opinion of the Political Agent, matters had reached this cnsia solely through Syud Toorkee's vacillation and want of firmness in dealing with the Bu Hassan tribe, and it was to be feared that the rumour of what had occurred would have a disturbing effect on the country generally, as showing the increas ing weakness of Syud Toorkee's Government. Lieutenant -Colonel Ross concurred in this opinion. 387 The proceedings of Lieutenant-Colonel Miles were approved by the Government of India, but he was requested to g . o. No. 1957p., dated stii july i87o. su ^ m ^ a fuller report upon the nature of the quarrel between Syud Toorkee and the Bu Hassan tribe, the demands made by that tribe upon His Highness, and the conditions which had been arranged with them, in order that the Government of India might be enabled to understand the position of affairs. 388. Causes of the dispute between Syud Toorkee and the Bu Hassan Tribe.—In reply, Colonel Miles reported that the dis content arose first among a party of the Bu Hassan tribe that had arrived in Muscat from Soor with with his letter No. 331-3, dated 5th ^he usual object of obtaining presents from His August 1875. Highness. They desired that their tribesmen who then formed the garrison should be dismissed, and themselves entertained in their ste%(d, as they considered the others had enjoyed the emoluments of office long enough. They were also dissatisfied with the provisions furnished for their support and with the sum of money offered them. 389. His Highness did not accede to their wishes, or take any steps to allay their disaffection, which continued to increase until the garrison, who were themselves considerably in arrears of pay, joined them, and His Highness then found himself in the position described above. 390. The conditions His Highness was ultimately compelled to make with the tribe were that their demands as regarded food and subsidy should be complied with ; that the party forming the garrison should be relieved every three months by others of the tribe; and that the Sheikhs should visit Muscat every six months to receive the usual subsidies. His Highness also repeated a former promise to consult with the tribe on occasions of difficulty in the poli tical affairs of the country. 391. The settlement of these demands, and the payment of arrears due to the garrison, cost His Highness about $1,700. 392. Wish of Syud Toorkee to abdicate ,—These arrangements having been concluded, Syud Toorkee returned on shore, and the greater part T . . tP1 iTkjr*i 'xr oo/tok of the Bedaween left Muscat the following day, Lieutenant-Colonel Miles No. 230-85, , . , i t-» tt j a 1 dated 28th May 1875. Vide letter from leaving about 150 Ol the DU MaSSan and Al- 586-150 dated 4th JuuTis?? ulf ' No ' Wahibeh tribes to garrison the place. Although these men behaved quitely, a good deal of mistrust and coldness existed between them and Syud Toorkee, and on two occasions there was danger of a rupture occurring. 393. On the 25th May, Colonel Miles had a visit from Syud Toorkee, who informed him that he wished to leave Muscat by the Mail Steamer expected to arrive the next day and proceed to Kurrachee, where he could reside in peace, as he could no longer bear the burden of Government, on account of the insolence of the tribes, who were tired of him and no longer desired him as ruler. He therefore intended to abdieate in favor of his brother Abdool Azeoz, whom the people had come to prefer to himself, and he would trust to his brother's generosity to make 90 *some provision for his residence in India. His Highness hinted that his life was in danger from the Bedaweens, and said that if he could not go in the steamer, he would take his depar ture in a country boat.' 394. Colonel Miles told His -tlighness he was afraid he was not well that morning, or that he had been much annoyed by something to cause him tk speak in that way. The Political Agent s§id that it was impossible for him on the part of Government to countenance his leaving Muscat in such a precipitate manner, without any arrangements having been made for the security of the town and merchants, as the Bedaween would be certain to take advantage of the confusion consequent on his departure to plunder the place, and he added that if His Highness had firmly resolved on the step of resigning the Sultanate of Oman, he should at least give time for the Political Resident in ^he Gulf to be informed, as that officer could then communicate with His Highness, and make such arrangements as he might think proper in the matter. Colonel Miles endeavored at the same time to encourage His Highness in every way, and to dissuade him from his purpose. 395. His Highness said he had contemplated the step for the past two or three months, and had determined to have nothing more to do with the Gov ernment of the country. 396. Colonel Miles had another interview with Syud Toorkee a few hours afterwards at his own palace, and again pointed out to him the weakness and imprudence of the step he proposed to take. His Highness seemed very des pondent, and did not attempt to refute Colonel Miles' arguments, but said he would reconsider his decision in the matter. 397. The step was distasteful to all Syud Toorkee's best fri^pds and advisers, including his brother, Syud Abdool Azeez, Syud Hillal, and Syud Mohammed Azzan. These all strongly opposed His Highness' resolution to abandon the Government, and Colonel Miles believed they were greatly em barrassed at the announcement of his intention. As for Abdool Azeez, Colonel Miles had reason to believe that overtures had been made to him by some of the Bedaween to oust his brother foorkee, and that he had unhesitat ingly refused the offer, and had declared himself faithful to his brother's interests. 398. On the 26th May, Colonel Miles received an intimation from His Highness that he had abandoned for the present his intention of quitting the country, and that he would do his best to carry on the Government. 399. In the opinion of Colonel Miles, His Highness was serious in his intention to leave Muscat, and he believed he was chiefly induced thereto by his pecuniary embarrassments, by the vexatious annoyances of the Bedaween, • and by the advice of his favourite and counsellor, Mesh, who was anxious to exchange Muscat for a safer and more pleasant residence (paragraph 307 of Precis).. 400. Colonel Ross, in forwarding this report, was of opinion that the unfavourable condition of Syud Toorkee's affairs could not but give rise to apprehensions. It was impossible to look with confidence to a steady con tinuance of His Highness' rule. This unfortunate aspect of affairs was caused by defects of internal administration which could not be controlled or remedied by the Political Officers of the Government of India. Colonel Ross added that as it might be advisable for a vessel of war to remain for the present at Muscat, or within his reach, he would endeavor to make an arrangement with the Senior Naval Officer for that purpose. 401. Colonel Ross also forwarded a copy of the following letter which he had addressed to the Sultan of Muscat on the 4th June :— ' I have received information from Lieutenant-Colonel Miles of the nature of some im portant communications which Your Highness had made to that officer. 91 r ^'Whilst feeling extremely grieved that certain annoyances should have caused Your I%h- ness to entertain momentarily an idea of leaving Muscat, 1 beg to express my satisfaction that I am able to report to Government that Your Highness has abandoned such an idea. 'I concur entirely with Lieutenant-Colonel Miles in the views he expressed to Your Hiirhnoss and would beg to add my friendly and respectful request that Your Highness will be good enough to refrain from any premature step of the nature referred to. ' I can assure ...Your Highness that His Kxcellency the Viceroy of India in Council no-ards the Government of Your Highness with friendly interest, and, sympathising with the difficulties which as Ruler of Oman you necessarily have to encounter, would be glad to see you meet them successfully and continue to administer the Government of Muscat. a I be'- to thank Your Highness for accepting the advice of Lieutenant-Colonel Miles, and it is my earnest request that you will continue to do so in matters especially which, like what is here aljuded to, would affect the interests of British subjects. 'Trusting Your Highness is well and hoping to be honored by frequent news of Your Highness^ welfares' 402. On the 10th of June Colonel Miles reported* that His Highness D • Syud Toorkee had not atmin recurred to the subject * From Political Eesideut, Persian J . 1 . . 0 , i-i' Gulf, No. 660-168, dated jiSth June ot his leaving Muscat and seemed to be in sonie- 18751 what better spirits. His Highness' relations with the Bedaweens appeared to continue friendly and satisfactory. 403. Quarrel between His Highness Syud Toorkee and Syud AbdOOl A zeez. —In the concluding paragraph of his letter No. 248-94, x « • i i ^ ^ o r*- i dated the 24th of June 1875,f resrardinof the Semail f Received with letter from Political \ ^ i ? htm • • Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 681-174, dimculty, (paragraphs 303-16} (Joloiiel Miles lUtl- dated 1st J oh 18/ ». mated that a difference had occurred between His Highness Syud Toorkee and his brother Syud Abdool A zeez about the farm of the Custom House. Colonel Miles said that he had proffered his good officers in view to promoting a reconciliation, and he promised a further report on the matter. t From roiitici Rmdent. Pei™... 0n the 8th of Jul y Colonel Miles reported | that Gulf, No. 762-191, dated gist July the quarrel between the brothers was at an end, a reconciliation between them having been effected. Colonel Miles gave the following account of the disagreement. 404. On the morning of the 24th June he received a visit from Syud Abdool Azeez, who informed him that he had fallen out with his brother Syud l oorkee and was satisfied neither with his treatment of him nor with the state of affairs, and he requested Colonel Miles' mediation in the matter, as unless- some amelioration took place in these matters, he had no desire to remnin longer in Muscat. Abdool Azeez stated that his complaint was chiefly against his brother's favorite servant Mesh, who was plundering Syud Toorkee right and left, and who was placed in a position by Syud Toorkee that was an insult to him (Abdool Azeez). He said that a few days before, while taking over the. accounts oi the Customs House on its transfer to another farmer, he found that Mesh had been accustomed to take over all the receipts, for which he had rendered no^ proper account, and that he also held an order from Syud Toorkee for $10,000 tor money and articles said to have been supplied. He (Abdool Azeez) had called upon Mesh to produce his vouchers for this claim, but he had only been able to do so for $2,000 or $3,000 and could give no satisfactory account of the rest. Abdool Azeez added that he had only interfered in this matter with the best intentions and on behalf of his brother's interests, which were being entirely sacrificed by this man, who robbed him most unscrupulously, .ihiee years ago the man was selling sugar-cane in the streets, and though his piesent pay from ioorkee was only $15 a month, he had managed to amass a s, p n ? r ( ? ve ^ ^^AOOO. Abdool Azeez further said that his own counsel and that ot loorkees hest friends was entirely disregarded if it differed from Mesh s, as us advice always prevailed, and that the Sheikhs of the tribes and influential P eo P e 'd the country were disgusted with Syud Toorkee chiefly on account of ic pim eeaings of this man. He said his brother must choose between him- an . lesh, as lie (Abdool Azeez) did not wish to be longer concerned in the 92Government if matters were to continue thus. He was incurring the odium of the people as well as Toorkee, and his own character in thefr eyes and his future prospects were being injured thereby. . 405. Colonel Miles visited His Highness Syad Toorkee the same day, mtormed hnn ot the substance of what Syud Abdool Azeez had said, and expiessed his legiet at hearing of the difference between him and his brother Colonel Miles then offered his good offices in promoting a reconciliation. 406. His Highness Syud Toorkee replied that he had no quarrel with his brother Abdool Azeez whatever, and was not in the least angry or displeased with him. That Abdool Azeez had made some request about Mesh which he (Toorkee) had been unable to grant—but nothing more. Colonel Miles said that he was sure Abdool Azeeez was offended, and he pointed out that His Highness would best consult his own interests by seeking to be reconciled with him and regaining his friendship. His Highness said he accepted his advice and would go over that evening to Syud Abdool Azeez's house and make friends with him. 4:07. Accordingly Syud Toorkee went to the house of Abdool Azeez that evening accompanied by his brother Mahomed bin Azzan to whom he granted full poweis to settle the disj^ute and then returned to his palace. Nothing, however, came of Mahomed bin Azzan's mediation, for on the followino- day (25th June) His Highness wrote to Colonel Miles :— ' fi na l reply of Abdool Azeez to Mahomed was that a reconciliation could not be effected save by the dismissal of Mesh. On being- told my brother's reply, I could not help considering him foolish, since there is a wide difference between him and Mesh, and Mesh can not be in opposition to him. The doing-s of my servants for good or for evil reflect on me alone, and I cannot see that Abdool Azeez has any right to interfere. m ' As you are aware, his coming 1 to Muscat was on an agreement entered into, and if the vexatious intei lorence in matters of State such as he (Abdool Azeez) presumes on form a part of such agreement, I shall consider myself bound by the same and shall carry it out in the spirit in which it was drawn up in the presence of the representatives of your Government. Mesh has not committed himself to merit being degraded and dismissed, and he is our slavej ever ready to carry out our behests. Would it be well, therefore, to punish him without a fault, punishment being the reward and fruit of wron^-doings ? 'As it is known to you, only the other day our brother Majeed made a selection and put- in a position of responsibility and trust one from among his subjects, and in the present we have my brother Burgash raising from amongst strangers and placing above his nobles and brothers a man of humble circumstances. Neither met with any remonstrances in the carrying out of their wishes. How then can I do this? For, as it is, on the mere rumour of such a demand having been made, most of my friends have taken alarm, judging it just possible a similar demand may be preferred against them. ' We after this sent to our brother Abdool Azeez our brother Mahomed bin Azzan and with him Khamis bin Hassan^ that they may confer with him and persuade him to be reason able. This they endeavoured hard to effect. At first this appeared hopeless, but eventually he consented to fall into my wishes on condition he was allowed to keep to his house and not be required to give advice in any matters concerning State or otherwise. This was the final result of their endeavours. Under the above condition, how can it ever be possible for us to be intimate or in unity? If my brother is to stay in Muscat, I must meet him and get his assistance and advice on all matters and points on which I may require them. From his remaining in retirement difficulties and dangers will arise from the people of Oman, and opportunity will be given them by the difference between us to raise the standard of revolt. 'Now we refer to you and put ourselves in your hands. Whatever decision you arrive at we must abide by/' 408. Colonel Miles then called on His Highness and urged him not to let others place obstacles in the way of friendship, but to give some consider ation to his brother's requests; and he suggested to His Highness that he should allow Abdool Azeez to investigate Mesh's accounts, which would give the man an opportunity of clearing himself from the charges made against him,—or if Abdool Azeez's suspicions turned out correct, His Highness would be able to rid himself of a man who had abused his confidence so greatly. His Highness assented to this at the time, and said he would send Mesh over to Abdool Azeez, to be dealt with as the latter pleased. 93 1 |i mmaamm 409. Syud Toorkee nevertheless afterwards changed his mind, writing to Colonel Miles on the 29th of June ;— ' I bet' to inform you that I sent yesterday to you our brother Mahomed bin Azzan in order that°he mi-ht acquaint you with the nature of the accounts outetandmg against us m fa of Mesh. These are not entered in his books, and are cheques and orders drawn on h.m; the largest item of the amount due him being cash under this head, the balance bemg for rice and eoBce supplied. He presented all these orders and cheques to us and rendered an account, vouched the total shown by him I acknowledge to be correct because I have received the value of the same. Under these circumstances, I see no way of disputing any of these items after these have been proved against me and acknowledged, neither do 1 see a way open to me of going into these accounts again, since when the account was first presented the vouchers were examined and found correct: these latter were then destroyed. How then would it be becoming or just of me to refuse the debt against me.' And cannot perceive any way open for my brother Abdool Azeez to call him (Mesh) to account again for charges wliich I have acknowledged. 4 i i ' I trust in you, therefore, to dissuade and prohibit him (Abdool Azeez) from doing what there is no means of his completing satisfactorily, and which you so well understand. ' I beg for a written reply to this, as we place our trust and faith in such reply. 'On the 22nd* current we addressed you by letter, in which we communicated briefly the proceedings of our brother alluded to, but received no * a clerical error for 25th. reply by letter as we expected, hoping it would be favourable. This is a well-known rule and procedure in all correspondence and is essential/' 410. To this Colonel Miles replied on the same day :— ' X have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Highness' letter of this day's date on the subject of the difference between Your Highness and Syud Abdool Azeez, and inform ing me that Your Highness does not concur with me as to the expediency of meeting the views of Syud AMool Azeez regarding the accounts of Your Highness' servant Mesh. ' Having a conviction of the importance of Your Highness being in concord and unity with Syud Abdool Azeez, both as regards the stability of Your Highness' Government and generaHnterests, I considered it my duty to offer my good offices in promoting a reconciliation, and with this view I advised Your Highness to let no light matter stand 1 in the way of a reconcilement and renewal of intimacy with Your Higkness' brother. ' As, however, my advice and proposals do not appear altogether acceptable to Your High ness, it is only left for me to communicate the circumstances to Colonel Ross for the informa tion of Government, who I feel sure will learn with much regret of the estrangement between Your Highness' brother and of my unsuccessful endeavours to restore oonfidence and friend ship between you. ' With regard to' Your Highness'observation that I have not replied to Your Highness^ first letter, I respectfully remind Your Highness that I have since had the honor of a personal interview with Your Hig-hness, and I am not aware that I have left any point raised by Your Highness unconsidered.' 411. Tn the meantime Syud Toorkee had sent for his uncle, Syud Hilal, the chief person in Muscat next to himself and Abdool Azeez, and requested him to mediate in the matter. This resulted in Syud Hilal writing to Abdool Azeez and saying that Syud Toorkee would comply with his request and send Mesh to him for examination. This, however, was not done as His Highness again changed his mind on the subject, and Syud Hilal's intervention ceased. After again seeing Abdool Azeez, Colonel Miles called on His Highness and informed him that he could no longer interfere in the matter, and that it was his intention to telegraph at once to Colonel Ross the state of affairs for the information of Government. His Highness then said he had resolved on send ing Mesh away from Muscat for a time at least, and he hoped his brother Abdool Azeez would be satisfied with the arrangement, as he (Toorkee) was anxious to put an end to the estrangement and be on amicable terms again. Colonel Miles told His Highness he had adopted a wise course, as the estrange ment between him and his brother was undoubtedly being anxiously watched by his enemies, and dissensions and disturbances would certainly arise il it continued much longer. His Highness had an interview with his brother that nighfc, and a reconciliation took place then between them; Syud Abdool Azeez having agreed to the arrangement that Mesh should leave Muscat. 94412. Syud Toorkee again expresses a%vish to abdicate Orders of Government in regard to aid to be afforded to Syud Toorkee.— On the 13th of July 1875, Colonel Koss telegraphed 'Following message, dated Muscat ilth, received from Political AgentToorkee has again expressed wish to abdicate in favor of Abdool Azeez, and appears serious in his resolve. He is quite helpless and unable to control events. Hamood* * Hameyed bin Khalifeen, Chief of and five hundred A1 Wahibeh have occupied Muscat and «r'.ph27%'' ibe ' tribe (Prf0iS ' ^ Mattra some .lays ago; more expected.

To the above the Resident added ;— ' I have telegraphed for Daphne to proceed from Ilenjam to Muscat, and am prepared to proceed there myself, if Government approve. I presume Government would wish me to endeavour to dissuade Syud Toorkee from abdication. I respectfully solicit the earliest possible instructions, as communications with Muscat are now so limited.' 414. Two days afterwards, 15th July, Culonel Ross again telegraphed :— ' Referring to my message of 13th, I purpose leaving for Muscat to-morrow by mail steamer. Please let telegrams for me be addressed Bushire, as usual. In case of Sultan requiring active aid, I shall till further orders be guided by instructions in your telegrams dated 20th January and 13th March 1874. If Sultan should ask further advance of subsidy, would Government give me a discretionary power in that matter, or wish me to refer for orders ?' 415. The telegrams of the Government of India alluded to by Colonel Boss related to :— 1. The occupation ot Muttra by Syud Salim bin Thoweynee. t After the expulsion of the Bin , 2 -. The assault on Mesnaah by Ibrahim bin Gheis branch Ibrahim held Sohar iudo- Gheis, a brother of Azan bin Gheis, a former pendente of the Sultan. of Muscat+ 416. In th£ case of the occupation of Muttra by Salim, which resulted in. the plunder of British subjects living there, the Government of India, Toorkee having solicited interference, directed the Resident to demand satisfaction from the rebel holders of Muttra for injury done to British subjects, and, if this was refused, to bombard the fort after 48 hours' notice. The Resident was further given full power to help Syud Toorkee actively so far as the guns of the vessels of war would reach, and to protect British interests, but he was to undertake ^ L no operations on shore.t In the matter of the iccis, paia e rap attack on Batinah Ibrahim was to be told that as Syud Toorkee was an ally of the British Government his rebellious proceedings w r ere viewed with displeasure; and that he would be held responsible for injury caused to British subjects, and would be required, if necessary, to make reparation. In the event of Ibrahim attacking Muscat the instructions in Saleh's „ „ ,, , case were to apply.S But as neither of these cases rec^, para 0 iap 12/i. was similar to the one under reference. Colonel Ross was addressed by telegram No. 2043P., dated 16th July 1875, as follows :— 'Your telegrams of 13th and 15th July. 'Enough already said in your letter of 4th June to Toorkee dissuading him from resigna tion. If still resolved to resign in favor of Abdool Azeez, II 'It is the decided opinion of the d fc interfere.

(Precis, t | iat interference in internal affairs of Oman should be paragraph 378). avoided. You are not to resort to force without previous sanction, unless British subjects in danger.' 417. In his subsequent letters marginally noted, Colonel Ross reported No. 762-191, dated 2ist July 1875. fully on the matters brought to notice in his tele- „ 768-193, „ 24th „ „ grams of the 13th and 15th ot July. 418. Occupation of Muscat by the Al-Wahibeh.— This^ame aboujb in the following manner. 95 z96 419 Early in the month of July 1875 His Highness Syud Toorkee received a letter from one of the Sheikhs of the A1 Wahibeh, Hameyed bin Kbalifeen. informing him that another Sheikh of the same tribe named Hamood bin Syud with whom he was not on good terms, was collecting his men and intended mischief at Muscat and Muttra. He (Hameyed bin Khalifeen) there fore intended despatching his son with an equal force to Muscat, in order to support His Highness should they attempt to oppose him in any way. The plot was too transparent for His Highness not to see through it at once, so he sent to close the passes in front of these men. It was too late; however, and on the nio-ht of the 5th July the two parties, numbering it was said several hundred men. arrived at Muttra, which they occupied without opposition. In the morning they sent to His Highness to say that their intentions were friendly, and His Highness deeming it best apparently to make no opposition sent permission for them to enter Muscat. « From Political Kesidcnt, Persian 420. In his letter No. 286-108, dated 8th July, Gulf, No. 762-191. dated 21st July Colonel Miles re ported * that 'the cause of this rising' on the part of the A1 Wahibeh was, there is little doubt, the rupture between His Highness and Syud Abdool Azeez, which the tribe believed to be complete. Their object in coming was to depose Syud Toorkee in favor of Abdool Azeez, if the latter would accept it.' 421. However this may have been. His Highness having allowed his unwelcome visitors to enter his town did not know very well how to get them out again ; but judging it chiefly to be a question of dollars began to treat with them accordingly in the hope of getting rid of them the same day, and he requested from Colonel Miles an advance of $3,000 (Rupees 6,480). As by the end of the month a half yearly instalment of subsidy would be due to His Highness, and as a refusal would have seriously embefrrassed the Sultan and have perhaps led to disturbances which would have greatly complicated matters. Colonel 'Miles considered that he would be acting for the best if he made the advance, which he accordingly did. His proceedings w T ere approved in the letter of the Government of India, No. 2251P., dated 13th August 1875, it being added.—' !•; is presumed that the advance has already been recovered out of the t i .e., of subsidy. half-yearly payment f due at the end of July.' 422. The Sultan's next step was to treat with the tribe and discuss the various conditions required by them. At the time of Colonel Miles' letter (8th July) the negotiations had not been concluded, but the Political Agent believed that the Sheikhs had been promised a sum of $2,000 on their quitting the tow T n. 423. The leader of the party. Sheik Hamood bin Syud (who was Saleh + D ,. , bin Ali's Lieutenant in the attack on Muttra in • IW ' p ' r, ' g ' p ' 20 - January + 1874), visited Colonel Miles on 7th July and requested him to guarantee the fulfilment of any conditions that might be agreed upon between them and His Highness, because, as the Sheikh plainly said, they had no confidence in Syud Toorkee's good faith. ' The proposal/ said Colonel Miles,— ' of course was at once and effectually declined by me, but without, I believe, prejudicing' His Highness' position in any way. The Sheikh was made to understand at the same time that no actual violence towards His Highness or injury to British interests would be tolerated.' § From Political Resident, Persian 424. On the 20th of July, letter No. 303-112, Guif, No. 708-193, dated 24th July Colonel Miles reported § that the conditions required by the A1 Wahibeh Bedaweens, and to which the Sultan had agreed, were— I hat he should retain the following number of Hinawees as his paid guard or garrison in Muscat and Muttra, viz.— 50 A1 Wahibeh. 50 Beni bu Hassan. 50 El Hejrieeh.97 2Md—That Mahomed bin Senan, the Wallee of 'the Ghaffiree garrigon of roit^ Semail, should be dismissed and a Belooch garrison substituted. 3rd—That the remainder of the Wahibeh guard in Muscat should be dismissed—all but thirty camel sowars. kth. —That the Beni Hadther should no longer have charge of the crates of Muttra. ' ' ' bth.—That 100 men should be retained at Muscat as a following for Syud Abdool Azeez when he proceeds into the interior to settle internal disputes or punish the refractory. 425. His Highness Syud Toorkee resolves on leaving Muscat. —About three days after the above conditions had been agreed to by His Highness, the Bedaweens, seeing no signs of their fulfilment, again became troublesome; and His Highness being equally out of patience and annoyed with them, and being moreover apprehensive of consequences to himself, resolved to remain in Muscat no longer and commenced making preparations for departure. Subsequently, however. His Highness carried out the conditions he had agreed to, so far as he was able, by dismissing the Wahibehs, retaining Sheikh Hamood bin Syud with a number of his men to act as Syud Abdool Azeez's field force, and by despatching an order to Mahomed bin Senan and Ghathree garrison to evacuate the fort of Semail. But even then a difficulty occurred, the Ghaffirees refused to give up the fort to the officer sent bv Syud Toorkee, and so the second condition remained unfulfilled. « 426.

Abdool Azeez.— When reporting the measures From Political Resident, Persian Gulf, adopted by the feultan to quiet the rebellious No. 768-193, dated 24th July 1875. Bedaweens, Colonel Miles added*— ' I regret to say also that Syud Toorkee and his brother have again become estranged, and that they are now so mutually distrustful of each othei% that a sincere reconciliation between them appears somewhat difficult. ' Syud Ahdool Azecz is displeased and annoyed'with His Highness on account of the way in which he considers his brother has mismanaged affairs of late, and he is also piqued I believe at the fact of His Highness not having consulted him on the subject of his resigna tion of power and departure from Muscat^ and for not even informing him of his intention. ' His Highness Syud Toorkee, on the other hand, is imbued with the suspicion that Syud Abdool Azeez has been intriguing with the Bedaweens to subvert him (Syud Toorkee), and that he has instigated them in their proceedings. ' His Highness and Syud Abdool Azeez are both of a very jealous disposition and prone to evil suggestions from others. I am not aware that His Highness has any solid grounds for his suspicions of Abdool Azeez, and it i^ my opinion that he has behaved honestly and loyally towards his brother throughout.' t Vide his letter No. 762-191, 427. On the 20th of July Colonel Eoss arrived t dated Muscat, 20th July 1875. i n Muscat and found matters as reported by Colonel Miles. 428. On the following day the Resident | w T aited on His Highness Syud + From Colonel Ross, No. 768-193, Toorkee, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Miles, dated Bunder Abbass, 24th July 1875. anr l conversed with His HighneSS OU the Subject of the position of his affairs. His Highness seemed extremely depressed and despondent, and avowed that he was physically incapacitated from taking any part in active measures and had lost control over events. Colonel Ross asked His Highness whether he considered there was any danger of disturbances or disorders in Muscat at present; he replied—no, for the simple reason that all their demands had been conceded.98 xhe Eesident next sounded His Highness as to whether lie had formed any plans, 'or intended to adopt any special measures, in order to re establish his authority and regain a more dignified position. It, wrote Colonel Boss, 'became painfully apparent that late worry and anxiety have induced a frame of mind which renders His Highness unable to consider his affairs with the calmness necessary for coming to any firm decision. His Highness had however abandoned his intention of leaving Muscat, although he had actually had his personal effects packect for that purpose. As the Sultan made no allusion to his proposed abdication the Kesident refrained from making any remarks on the subject. 430 The Sultan whilst speaking with the Resident expressed a hope that the latter would intervene in the disputes between himself and the Omanee Bedaween Chiefs. Colonel Ross at once informed His Highness that it was im possible for him to interfere, as it would be contrary to his instructions. 431 Colonel Ross spoke to His Highness regarding the estrangement between the brothers, and offered, if such were the wish of His Highness, to afford his o-ood offices to smooth the way as far as possible to restore mutual confidence! 5 At the same time Colonel Ross clearly explained to His Highness that it was by no means his intention to press this suggestion on His Highness, and it was entirely for his own consideration and decision whether he would ao-ain seek the assistance of Syud Abdool Azeez in carrying on the Govern ment. The Resident further clearly informed the Sultan that he could not go beyond friendly mediation, and that he could not guarantee, or be a party to, any conditions that might be eventually settled upon. His Highness having accepted the Resident's offer. Colonel Ross saw Abdool Azeez, who expressed himself as being willing to assist His Highness, and s^d he was perfectly prepared to refute to His Highness the accusations which seemed to have been made against him. Syud Abdool Azeez's statements seemed to Lieutenant- Colonel Miles and to Colonel Ross to be straightforward and satisfactory. 432. Colonel Ross then arranged that Syud Abdool Azeez should call on His Highness Syud Toorkee with Lieutenant-Colonel Miles and himself, where the two brothers could discuss their affairs, and it so disposed, come to a mutual agreement. ' This,' said the Resident, ' was effected, and having so far paved the way to an understanding, I considered 1 had done as much as the occasion demanded and my orders warranted, and took leave of His Highness. My returning to Bushire would I thought best show His Highness that no more active inter vention in his affairs was intended. 'Captain Foot, Senior Naval Offrcer Commanding Her Majesty's Ship Daphne, having' informed me that he was anxious on account of the health of his crew to proceed to Kurrachee, 1 told that officer that I considered one vessel would suffice to watch British interests at present at Muscat. Captain Foot has arranged for one vessel to remain there/' 433. Muscat threatened by Wahibelis. Orders of Govern ment on Syud Toorkee's application for aid— On the 12th August the Resident telegraphed :— 'Referring to my No. 768-193, dated 24th July 1875, Political Agent, Muscat, reports on 5th August: Arrangement between Sultan and his brother continued to show beneficial results, and matters so far improved at Muscat. Fresh apprehensions, however, arise from movements of another faction of A1 Wahibeh tribe under llameyed bin Khalifeen in threaten ing march on Muscat. Colonel Miles considers if this force reaches Muttra, Toorkee's position will be again endangered, as Muscat force inadequate. Sultan enquired of Political Agent whether in event of attack he would receive active support, urging he relied greatly on British Crovernment, and trusted aid would not be withheld when he most needed it. Guided by my instructions based in your telegram of 16th July, Colonel Miles replied he had no discretion and could not resort to force without previous sanction. In referring for orders Political Agent solicits sanction to support Toorkee in case of emergency, pointing out rapidity of events in Oman and absence of facility for corresponding rapid reference to Government, a fortnight or three weeks being sometimes required to obtain replies to telegrams: under which circuoi-stances necessity for reference in each ease and under all circumstances would be almost tanta mount to refusal of support. I respectfully solicit telegraphic instructions on this reference as early as convenient.' ^ The Government of India replied by telegram No. 2270P dated 16th August 1875 :■— 'If Toorkee asks formally in writing for active support, give it to him as before as far as guns ot our vessels can reach. But armed assistance should not be volunteered nor given unless on occasion of any particular crisis it is formally asked for. If lives and property of British subjects are in dilnger, Colonel Miles may do what is necessary for their protection But he must bear in mind the general policy of not interfering in internal affairs of Oman if it can possibly be avoided, although good offices may freely -be used/' 434. Further estrangement between Syud Toorkee and Abdool Azeez. Bedaweens threaten to attack Muscat. Syud Toorkee finally resolves on retiring to Gwadur. Abdool Azeez assumes management of Muscat Administration —By telegram dated the 17th August, Colonel Ross reported ' Political Agent, Muscat, telegraphs as follows on 15th: Muscat, 15M.—Toorkee and Abdool Azeez again estranged and Azeez withdrawn himself from affairs. Toorkee does not desire reconciliation or further association with him, and affairs have reached crisis. Bedaweens have deserted Toorkee's cause. Toorkee has resolved to retire to Gwadur for present, leaving Azeez in charge.

I am replying that reply to Political Agent's message of 15th is approved by Viceroy of my instructions to confine action to protection of British interests; that I infer Government desire no interference with Toorkee's present plans, and consider no objection to passage being afforded to His Highness if asked for and provided vessel can be safely spared. As regards Colonel Miles' wishes for my presence at Muscat, I am prepared to proceed by next steamer, leaving 26th; but I should first wish to be informed if Government considers this advisable. If so, I trust I may be as fully as possible instructed as to the general objects towards which our influence should be directed. The Hugh Rose proceeded to Muscat on 17th, and I believe Daphne will leave Kurrachee to-day, so that protection of subjects and property is adequately provided for. Beyond close observation of affairs 1 could not at present suggest further measures.' 437. In replyt Government informed Colonel Ross that there was no t Telegram, So. 2327P.. dated 23rd necessity for him to go to Muscat, and approved August 1875. 0 f his instructions to Colonel Miles. 438.

Syud Toorkee's retirement reported to Secretary Of State.— By telegram No. 2382R, dated the 30th of August 1875, and by despatch No. 176P. of the 13th September, Her Majesty's Government were informed of the circumstances which had led to the retirement of His Highness Syud Toorkee, and to the assumption by his brother Abdool Azeez of the administraticn of Muscat affairs. 441. Conditions agreed to between SyiKo. Toorkee and Abdool Azeez for the Government of Muscat. Disaffection of the Ghafflree tribe. Hostile movement of Hameyed bin Kbalifeen, Chief of the A1 Wahibeh .—It is now necessary to go back to Lieutenant-Colonel Miles' letter the time of Colonel Ross' visit to Muscat (^para graphs 407-9). On the day prior to his departure letter No. 329-12^, dated 5th August 1875. GuirSo/ 1 855-209, dited'iSh August thence, Syud Toorkee authorized''' Abdool Azeez to 1875, settle the disputes with the Omanee Bedaween Chiefs: ' I authorize you,' His Highness wrote to his brother, ' to make terms with our parti- zans, the Hinawees, as follows :— 'That Mahomed bin Senan be relieved of the charge of the Semail fortress, and that it be entrusted to Beloochees. 'That the Beni Hazarmee be deprived of the charge of the Rawin fort, and that i£ be made over to the Beni Hwah. 'That the Wahabee garrison be dismissed from Muscat, all but 30 men; and that 50 men of the Al Wahibeh, 50 of the Beni Bu Hassan, and 50 of the Hejrieen be entertained to garrison Muscat. 'That 100 men be retained under your orders and superintendence. ' I request you to agree to the above terms on my behalf and to guarantee their fulfilment, in order that this matter may be quickly terminated. 442. The Sultan had also consented to the following agreement, giving Abdool Azeez a considerable voice in the management of affairs :— ' Ftom Syud Abdool Azeez bin Saeed. ' The two conditions I require from my brother Toorkee bin Saeed are— ' \st. —That I shall be consulted and my advice followed in the expenditure of the customs and the revenues of Muscat in that—' ' All payments, non-payments, increments and reductions of subsidies, salaries, &amp;c., be- in accordance with my advice. That I be allowed to exercise my discretion in regulating the allowances to be given to the Governors of Fortresses, soldiers, and other servants of the Government. fynd. —That in all matters relating to politics my advice be followed, i.e.— If I consider anything detrimental to the well-being of the Government and require its discontinuance or withdrawal, it shall be done, as also, should I consider anything essential to the prosperity of the State, it shall likewise be granted. « ■' Agreed to the arrangement required by my brother, Abdool Azeez bin Saeed, and conceded.

After this, the brothers for a time, as pre viously shown,f remained on good terms. 444. ()n the 5th August the difficulty experienced by His Highness in carrying out the second o! the conditions agreed upon between him and the Al Wahibeh Bedaweens, mz., the removal of the Ghaffiree garrison of Semail in favor ot a belooch garrison, was still unremoved, Mahomed bin Senan having declined to surrender the fort except- to His Highness in person. Abdool A-zec/^ wished the Sultan to proceed thither accordingly to fulfil the condition, but His Highness considered himself physically unfit for the journey, and did not appear to think his goings at all necessary. 100 Colonel Miles thouofht that thedifficulty might be got over ia some other way. It was the general opinion that m.tt, r a t ee fi wer ® dlsaffected at . the ascendency of the Hinawees, and were mnch dissatisfied at the lecent conditmns imposed by the latter on His High ness Synd Toorkee. It was also reported that the Beni Bn Ali El-Jenebeh and other Ghaffiree tribes of Jalaan, had in view a project for bringing Syud Sahm bin Ihoweynee back to the country, and that they were raising funds tor that purpose. 43 445. Colonel Miles, however, thought that the Sultan had more cause for a P i P w t'uT 'i tl ' raover ' i e nt3 of Sheikh Hameyed bin Khalifeen, of the A1 w ahibeh, whose rumoured intention to attack Muscat (paragraph 433) had been contnmed This Chief being at variance with Haniood bin Said of the same tribe [the man who had exacted favorable terms from the Sultan 1 (paragraphs 418-425), was much incensed at the success of his rival at Muscat' and at the advantageous position which he had secured. •fi. 4 qk' i Pxr 61 1 rep ? rted th + at Hameyed bin Khalifeen was leagued with She,khNasir bin babm bin el Habsi, and that if they succeeded in reach ing Muttra, the Su tan would hnd himself in an awkward position. Abdool Azeez and the bheikhs at the time in Muscat had promised to support His ig ness, but it was plain to all that the force in Muscat was much too small to cope with the number that Hameyed and k Nasir could bring with them. 447. The Sultan having enquired of the Political Agent whether he would receive the support of Government in case of an attack on him the telegraphic correspondence containing the orders of Government and comprised in paragraph 433 of this Precis then ensued, 448. In a subsequent letter, No. 346-126, dated 19th August* 1875; * From Political Resident, Persian Colonel Miles intimated that Hameyed had aban- Guif, No. 911-224, dated 25th August doned his intended attack on Muscat, though why he had done so was not known. 449. Measures taken by the Resident for the protection British interests at IVTuscat, When Syud Toorkee decided on retiring to Gwadur, the Resident, tearing that some confusion might arise at Muscat, on His Highness' departure, asked Captain Fort of the Daphne to move from Kurrachee to Muscat. Colonel Eoss also placed the Hugh Rose, the Residency Steamer, at the Political Agent's disposal, so that he might ^ f Prom Political Resident, Persian Gulf, not be without a VCSSel should the RlAemarS No. 873-217, dated 19th August 1875. faye l e f t ^ Syud Toorkee. f 450. Particulars of (1) the final estrangement between byud Toorkee and Abdool Azeez; (2) the retirement of the Sul tan to Gwadur; (3) the assumption by Abdool Azeez of the Government of Muscat. Question of the continuance of the Zanzibar subsidy.— In his letter No. 346-126, dated 19th August 1875,1 t Prom Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Colonel Miles reported that on the it)th of the *0.911-224, dated 25th August 1875. month a difference had arisen between the brothers a u?^ guards in Forts Merani and Jelali which overlook the Muscat Harbour. Abdool Azeez having visited the forts and mustered the men had found a deficiency in the strength of the garrisons, there being only about twelve men in each instead of thirty, the number for which the Commandants had been in the habit of drawing pay and rations. Abdool Azeez insisted on the Command- aiits being dismissed and the guards being replaced by some of the Beni Bu Hassan. He urged this on the ground that Syud Toorkee had, in the recently executed agreement between them, transferred to him (Abdool Azeez) the control of the forts, ihe Sultan declined to accede to his brother's demand saying that he was aware of the reduced strength of the guards, he however pro^ nused that the Commandants should be required to keep the garrisons up tc* 101, t „-r foil strength. This arrangement not pleasing Abdool Azeez, he declared t t if the conditions so recently agreed to by His Highness were not_ carried oat he would have nothing further to do with the Government and remain aloof. The Sultan then asked the Political Agent to mediate but as Abdool Azeez hP d to his resolve, Colonel Miles could do nothing. The principal Sheikhs then at Muscat, for their part begged His Highness to comply with his brother's wish The Sultan however refused to yield and nothing was done. Colonel Miles believed that Syud Toorkee was anxious to # a Beioocb. screen Eujab,'* the Comma ^bnt of the Merani Port from the wrath of the Metowwa party. It is universally believed in Oman that Rujab is the murderer of JBl-Khaleelee. The Metowwa party had threatened to kill him, hence His Highness wish to keep him from their hands. ' 451 After this the Sultan endeavoured to carry on the administration unaided and he entered into an arrangement with a party of El-Hijrieen who had just then arrived in Muscat to protect him, and to act as a check against the Bu Hassans, who, though ' professedly faithful, were undoubtedly disaffected.' 452 The Sultan soon found that he had Undertaken more than he could perform' He was unable to carry on the Government unaided, and a serious risino- of the Bedaweens having occurred he ordered the Commandants of Merani and Jelali to make over those forts to the insurgents. His Highness then betook himself on board the corvette Rahmanee and finally decided on retiring to Gwadur leaving Abdool Azeez in charge of affairs. The Bedaweens having gained possession of the forts dispersed quietly without any attempt to molest people or to plunder property. 453. ' It is apparent/' wrote Colonel Miles, 'that His Highness Syud Toorkee's rclinquishment of power for the present is the result of no sudden revolution, but events have been tending in this direction for a long time past. It only required a movement on the part of the Bedaweens, who for some time have had all the real power in their hands to bring on a crisis, and when this occurred His Highness had no resource but to yield to circumstances. In accordance with the wishes of Government, I have abstained as much as possible from interference and have not interrupted the course of events, but it is almost impossible in such position to stand aloof altogether, and T have confined myself to maintaining communication between His Highness and his brother and to smoothing difficulties between them. ' I have continued to assure His Highness Sjmd Toorkee that I felt bound to afford him personal protection for himself and family, and offered him the asylum of this Agency should he from apprehension of violence desire to avail of it. I have constantly visited and endeavoured to cheer him as much as possible since he has been on board the Rahamanee, but I have not visited Syud Abdool Azeez since he assumed charge of the Government.' 454. Colonel Miles thought it probable that A.bdool Azeez would make friends with the religious party and surround himself with Metowwas, many of whom had already shown themselves in the town. Abdool* Azeez was much embarrassed for want of funds as the Sultan had left an empty Treasury behind him. He (Abdool Azeez) had applied to the Political Agent for an advance of $5,000, the request was declined. Abdool Azeez'also wrote to Colonel Ross informing him of his having assumed the reins of Government at Muscat; the Resident simply replied that he had every confidence that Abdool Azeez would take care that order was maintained, and that Colonel Miles would receive from him every assistance in matters concerning British interests. 455. Subsidy question. Toorkee's allowance while at Gwadur, —Before leaving Muscat the Sultan was anxious to ascertain the view taken by the Govern ment ot India in regard to his position with reference principally to the'conti nuance ot the Zanzibar subsidy. Colonel Miles reported that he understood it to be His Highness' intention, provided Government granted the favor, to appro- * priate a certain portion for himself leaving the rest for his brother's Government. Syud Poorkee had already, when entrusting his financial arrangements to his brother, allotted to himself an allowance of $1,000 a month, and he had requested his brother to continue this payment to him for the present. 102t s o yud th a o «y bands and that thl Political Agenfs proceeL ^s! whiT ^L^ed Kesi I f ent truate d judicious throughout,' might meet with the approval of QoTernment. 1 '^ 61 ' ^ Syizd Abdool j A. zggz's a,din inif'!^ri-i o i Abdool Azeez first assumed the management of the State he wrote to most oVVii'r- mfluential people m Oman mvit ng them to Muscat.

Position of affairs at the beginning of August 1875 • Eetirp- ment of Sayyid Turki to Guadar .-In May 1874, Im .d Turki m fn health, devoid of suitable advisers and unable to control the turbulence or resist the rapacity of the Bedouin tribes, had invited bis brother, Savvid Abdul Aziz, then a political detenu at Karachi, to reside at Maskat. under certain conditions, and aid him in carrying on the Government. For a time the arrangement proved satisfactory and beneficial. Abdul Aziz loyally observ ed the conditions imposed upon him, and his more stable and energetic character gave strength to the Sultan s councils and actions. Gradually, however differences pf opinion m regard to policy, Sayyid Tnrki's addiction to low favourites, irritability on both sides, and jealousy and distrust on that of the Sultan, gave rise to a series of disputes, which ended early in August 1875 in s i y ? id A ' ldul ., A r* withdrawing from all participation in the 0 conduct of affairs. Sayyid lurki then tried to carry on the Government without aid or advice, but a threatened rising of the Bedouin garrison of Maskat. conse- quent on a promise made to them regarding custody of the forts not beins fulfilled, caused him to take refuge on board his corvette the RahmanL and to decide on retiring to Guadar. Having appointed Sayyid Abdul Aziz to act as regent during his absence, with jurisdiction over all the territories appertain- ing to Maskat, except Guadar, he proceeded thither on 21st August on board H. M. S. Rifleman, his family followed in his corvette the RahmanL When leaving Maskat he expressed to the Political Agent, Colonel Miles, his intention to return, should circumstances permit. Throughout these occurren ces Colonel Miles's attitude had been marked by great consideration and sym pathy for Sayyid Turki, while calculated to discourage ambitious views on From Government of India, to Resi* the part of Sayyid Abdul Aziz. The Political dent, Persian Gu f, No. 2705-?, dated Agent s proceedings during Sayyid Turki's with- ^pSri^ovember 1875. Nos. 61-87. drawal and Sayyid Abdul Aziz's assumption of authority, were approved by Government. 462. At this time Sayyid Salim bin Thowainee, ex-Sultan of Maskat, was living at Kishm, in the Persian Gulf, on an allowance of dollars 150 per men sem from Sayyid lurki. Ibrahim bin Kais, on outwardlv friendlv terms with Sayyid Turki, was residing at JEtostak. ^ 463.—Sayyid Abdul Aziz's administration.— Sayyid Abdul Aziz, on assuming charge of affairs, made efforts to restore order, and on 21st August the Political Agent reported that his authority appeared to be more widely acknowledged every day. In the want of ready money he had, however, an immediate and menacing difficulty, Sayyid Turki having left the treasury From Resident. Persian Gulf, to and the turbulent Bedouin garrison's pay in Government of India, No. yii-224, arrears. He applied to the Political Agent for a ^Foii.^l^vemberisTS, Nos 61-87. ^ oan dollars 5,000, but was informed that the request could not be entertained. On 2nd Septem ber, Colonel Miles reported that— ' Sayyid Abdul Aziz has continued to carry on the Government quietly, and no risings or From Resident. Persian Gulf, to Go. disturbances in the interior have been reported. The Shaikhs vemment of India, No. 950-231, dated au( ' leading men of most of the Hinawi and some of the Ghafiri 10th September 1875. tribes of 'Oman and El Sharkiveh have arrived in Maskat by oil. a.. March 1876. Nos. 97-156. invitation to pay their respects to Abdul Aziz. There has been a constant flow of these persons during the last ten days, and they are still coming- in.' 464. Sayyid Abdul Aziz's chief difficulty continued to be want of funds wherewith to satisfy the claims of the Bedouins garrisoning Maskat, who106 mmilipred 600 or 700, and were all powerful. He expressed to the Political T ^nt fears that the Bedouins, if not paid, might mutiny and create disturbance, ^ in'nted a hope that pecuniary aid might be given him. Colonel MUes replied that a loan was out of the question, and remarked that if any 1 . ,, ,, disturbance occurred he should take steps, in concert JSSrtrfiA,STSsMrt.*** with the commanders of H.M.'s vessels, to protect nob. 97.158. British -interests. 4.(55 On 1st September Shaikh Salih bin Ali El Harthi arrived at Maskat * A with 400 or 500 followers, and was received by From Resident.

March 1876, Nos. 97-156. the 0 f the Mutowwa party. If he adopted any other course, or declined to be guided by their views, Shaikh Salih was at libertv to depart from Maskat and act as he pleased. The influential position thus acquired by Salih bin Ali caused some jealousy among other partisans of Sayyid Abdul Aziz. 467. Shaikh Salih, shortly after his arrival, paid two visits to the Political Ao-ent, and, under pretext of asking advice, tried to sound him as to the pro bability of Savyid Turki's returning to Maskat. Colonel Miles declined to express any opinion on that point. Immediately after Shaikh Salih s second visit, Colonel Miles received a message from Sayyid Abdul Aziz that the dim- culties of his position were such that he did not desire to carry on the gov ernment any longer, and he asked for advice as to what he should do. In reply Colonel Miles reminded him of the responsibility he had incurred in un dertaking the regency, and declined io discuss the subject. 468. It now became apparent that Sayyid Abdul Aziz, urged by Shaikh Salih bin Ali, aimed 24th September 1875. at the assumption of independent power. On lotli Poll. 4., March 1876. Nos. 97-166.

The Beni Bu Ali repaired their forts and took measures to defend their quarter of Soor if attacked. In the west, Sayyid Badar bin Saif, Wali of Sohar, prepared to resist if interfered with, and gained the adherence of the Naeem of El Bereymi. Sayyid Abdul Aziz expressed an intention of proceeding to Soor to coerce the Beni Bu Ali, and asked the Political Agent if a passage thither in one of Her Majesty 's vessels might be afforded him. Colonel Miles replied that his request could not be complied without the special sanction of Government.14 From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gov ernment of India, No. 1018-241, dated 24th September 1875.

The Arab and Belooch guards of Mattrah et se *- submitted to him forthwith, and he occupied the citadel; but Sayyid Muhammed bin Azan and the Beni Bu Hassan garrison of Maskat refused to yield the place, or admit him without orders from Sayyid Abdul Aziz. Sayyid Turki thereupon declared Sayyid Abdul Aziz deposed, but the Governor and garrison, uninfluenced by this, maintained their atti tude. On hearing of Sayyid Turki's arrival and proceedings, bayyid Abdul Aziz* wrote from Semail to Sayyid Muhammad bin Azan that be was about to return to Maskat with as many men as he could collect, and had sent notice to Shaikh Salih bin Ali to join him. On the 19th December bayyid Turki, bavins been joined at Mattrah by 200 or 300 Arabs of neighbouring Ghafiri tribes, and some 50 Wahabi soldiers, sent by the Wall of Sohar, occupied the suburbs and heights outside the walls of Maskat. ^ A desultory and harmless fire was carried on between his forces and the garrison for two days, after which Sayyid Abdul Aziz not appearing, and the attacking partv threatening more active measures, the garrison agreed to capitulate. Sayyid Turki entered Maskat on the 21st December amid general and hearty demon strations of joy at his return. Sayyid Abdul Aziz's adherents, including Shaikh Salih bin Ali, at once abandoned him. His efforts to raise a force entirely failed, and he remained almost alone in the fort of Semail. 477. Arrest of Sayyid Salim bin Thowainee by H. M.

On measures being taken to arrest him, he escaped to Bandar Abbas and thence to Kishm, where he continued to reside. Sayyid Turki, after a time, allowed him and his brothers, who joined him, dollars 150 monthly. In Janu ary 1875, Sayyid Turki expressed to Colonel Miles fears that Savyid Salim would try to cross to the pirate coast or Soor, having been invited by the Ghafiri tribes of Oman. Colonel Ross inquired if Government would wish en deavours made to prevent Sayyid Salim crossing to Oman or to arrest him if found at sea. In reply he was referred to the orders of 5th November 1873. Telegram from Resident, Persian 4!78. On 29th September the .Assistant Sur- of lDdia ' dated geon, in charge at Bassidore, telegraphed to the Poll. A., April 1876, Nos. 38-93. Hesideni^ : — ' Sayyid Salim left in Shaikh Sakar's Bakarah, Nakhoda Saraki, for Arab coast, on 26th instant.' The Resident communicated this intelligence to Government, Sayyid Tur ki, and the Political Agent, Maskat, desiring the latter to inform the Senior Naval Officer and Sayyid Abdul Aziz. On 4th October Colonel Miles tele graphed to the Resident that information had reached Sayyid Abdul Aziz the day before that Sayyid Salim's destination was Soor, and that the matter not admitting of delay, he had requested the Commander of H.M.S. Daphne to proceed to Soor and intercept him. He added that Sayyid Abdul Aziz had not stopped Sayyid Salim's allowance, but had declined to increase it. The Daphne obtained no news of Sayyid Salim at Soor, and finding the Wali strong enough to arrest him if he arrived, returned to Maskat. On 12th Octo ber Colonel Miles telegraphed as follows :— Information received from Burka on 10th that Salim was moving down Batinah coast and had reached Sowadi. Daphne proceeded thither at once and arrested Salim with two vessels and forty men same night off Sowadi on his way attack Burka. Daphne returned yesterday. Have visited Salim and explained cause of capture He disclaims intention of opposing- present rule, and said he merely desired procure amicable arrangement with Abdul Aziz about pension, which had not been paid since Turki left. Salim will remain in Daphne until receipt of instructions. Boats and men released.' In his supplementary report, Colonel Miles wrote:— ' I visited His Highness Sayyid Salim on arrival and informed him that, as he had Prom Hesidcnt, Persian Gulf, to Oo. , h ''S ht Ht ^ re-visit 'Oman for the purpose of raising dissen- m 1140-270, vernment of India, Nos dated 22nd October 1875.

His Hi ghuess Sayyid Salim observed that his intentinii was not to excite dissension in the country, nor to oppose the rule of Savyid Abdul Aziz, but that, as Sayyid Turki had left Maskat, he was in doubt whether he should receive any pension now, and he merely wished to procure an arrangement as to this matter through the intervention of Zaid bin Khalifah and other friends in Maskat. He added that he had not received any pension since Sayyid Turki left, but then he admitted that the first instalment had not yet fallen due. 1 have learnt since his arrival that Sayyid Salim's intention was not to attack Burka, but to come straight on Maskat. He had received letters from many people in 'Oman, and had been invited to Maskat, I believe, by Shaikh Amir of the Beni Bu Hasan, who had promised he should find no resistance. This Shaikh Amir is the man who most strongly supported and encouraged Sayyid Abbul Aziz at the time jf Sayyid Turki's departure from Maskat. Sayyid Salim had arranged to land at Hail, 109 it ill 1 - ■ ■ : ip ■■ m ■where camels had been provided for him by the Moalik tribe the night on which he was can tared and it is considered by well-informed persons that he would have had a good chance if he had escaped arrest and appeared before the walls of Maskat. 479 Colonel Ross inquired of the Commissioner in Sind if he had any objections to Sayyid Salim being taken to Karachi, From Resident, Persian Gnlf, to Gov. an( j • ^ arrari gements COUld be made for Ms Safe ' custody. The Commissioner replied that there Poll, a., apdi 1876, No«. 38-93. were no objections, and that Salim could be placed either in tbe iail at Karachi or the port at Hyderabad. At Colonel Koss's re quest, Captain Foot, of H.M.S. Daphne, accordingly conveyed Sayyid Salim to Karachi and made him over to the Commissioner. He was confined in the fort at Hyderabad. In reporting the capture to Government. Colonel Ross stated that' he would communicate with Sayyid Turki regarding an allowance for Sayyid Salim's maintenance. The result of From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gov- the commumcation was that Sayyid Turki agreed e ^Toc\ 0 oUr d i875. 08 ' liW ' ' ' to allow dollars 100 a month, but suggested that Poiu a., april 1876, Nos. 38 93. parricide should rather be made over to him, to be dealt with for his father's murder. In reply Colonel Koss informed him that his views in regard to Say yid Salim's allowance should be communicated to Government. But that his proposal to receive Sayyid Salim could not be acceded to, as it would be quite opposed to the practice of the British Government in such cases. Sayyid Harib bin Thowainee, Salim's brother, who had been arrest ed with him, was released by order of the Resident. Government signified approval of the measures taken in connection with Sayvid Salim's arrest by the Resident and Political Agent, and His Excellency d ^^pg^^Q 1 79!. p.^ 0 dlted the Commander-in-Chief of Her Majesty's naval lo.h January 1876. forces in the East Indies was requested to convey Poll.

With regard to the nature of Sayyid Salim's confinement the orders of Government were:— „ „ . * * n 'It is not the intention of the Government of India that missiorn'r' hT Si IX no. 3186P., daUd Sayyid Salim should be subjected to an undue degree of 3rd December 1875. personal restraint, but that he should be so dealt with as to Poll.

Sayyid Turki's corvette, the Bahmani, had been sent to Bombay for sale, and he was accompanied by his slaves only. Notice of Sayyid Turki's departure for Maskat, sent by the Assistant Political Agent, Gwadar, by boat from Jask, and by the Resident by telegram to Karachi and thence by mail steamer, did not reach Colonel Miles until after Sayyid Turki's arrival at Mattrah. On 16th December Colonel Miles telegraphed to the Resident:— 'Turki unexpectedly arrived Mattrah night of 13th, and occupied town and forts without opposition. Arab and Belooch guards submitting at once. Governor has been imprisoned and fort walls being repaired. Mockler's telegram reached me twelve hours after Turki's arrival. Abdul Aziz had left for Semail three days before in ignorance of Turki's ap proach Maskat in charge of Muhammed Azan and about sixty Bu Hasan, who have refused to yield the place or admit Turki without orders from Abdul Aziz.

In a letter to Colonel Ross, dated 9th January 1876, Sayyid Turki, ^ J * after adverting to the large expenditure which was a necessity of his position, requested that the Zanzibar subsidy might be paid to him in quarter ly instead of half-yearly instalments.

Shaikh Salih bin Ali had accompanied him to Sernail and then returned to Kabil, whence he wrote to Sayyid Turki, proposing, on behalf of Sayyid Abdul Aziz, that he should receive from Sayyid Turki an allowance of dollars 500 monthly, retain posses sion of Semail JPort with some other on the Batinah coast, and be furnished with a supply of money for immediate expenses. Sayyid Turki declined this proposal, and intimated that an indispensable condition of any arrangement would be that Sayyid Abdul Aziz should quit the country. 489. Sayyid Turki contemplated renewing his old alliance with the Ghafiris and severing his recent intimate relations with the Hinawis, which had not proved advantageous to him ; but while the Hinawi garrison held Semail Fort for his brother, he did not venture to take overt steps in this direction. He sent the Chiefs of the Beni Bu Hasan contingent at Maskat to negociate with Shaikh Hasan of the Beni Ruweyeh for the surrender of the fort, but they returned unsuccessful. He then ordered the neighbouring Ghafiri tribes to gain possession of it by force, and sent them an 18-pounder brass gun to assist their operations. Some fighting ensued between the Ghafiri and Hinawi tribes in the vicinity of the fort, wherein the latter were worsted with considerable loss. An attempt to storm the fort was about to be made, w r hen the garrison received orders from Sayyid Abdul Aziz to surrender it, as the terms of a peaceful settlement between himself and his brother were being discussed. The Beni Ruweyeh thereupon evacuated the fort, and a Beluch garrison, sent by Sayyid Turki from Maskat, was placed in charge of it. 114.490. On 18th Eebruary Colonel Miles reported : 'I have to-day received a letter from His Hi-Imess Sayyid Abdul Aziz, expressino- . re for mediation m the estran-eraeut between himself and Sayyid Turki and hintinl fK.f ;he event of mv refraininor from interffii-fiimfl ho choii u;' ^ i^i J , ? tiat &gt; in the event of brother. my retVaiDiagr from mtorfereuco, he shall feci Sliriib^^o^sfhU Colonel Ross replied as follows :— ^ If request made for mediation between Sultan and brother, confine replies to of friendly wishes to see differences arranged by mutual agreement of principals who best know their feelings, relations, and interests.

Sayyid Badar bin Saif, who had been summoned from Sohar to conduct t0 the operations against Semail Fort was despatched by Sayyid Turki to Semed, to endeavour to nego- ciate an arrangement with Sayyid Abdul Aziz. His mission succeeded in so far that it was in consequence of it that Sayyid Abdul Aziz ordered the Beni Ruweyeh to sur render the fort ol Semail, but, as regards an agreement, Sayyid Abdul Aziz, although anxious to come to terms with his brother, would accept no mediation but that of Government. On 29th Eebruary Colonel Miles telegraphed :— 'Badar has returned after communicating with Aziz through Salih bin Ali. Aziz is willing to retire India on pension, but no definite terms arranged, Aziz desiring mediation only of British Government.

Colonel Ross replied :— u Instructions against interference must be hel l to, but you may afford good offices to facilitate amicable settlement at discretion, so far as consistent with those orders. For instance I see no objection to your being medium of communicating terms offered by either rarty, on distinct understanding that such terms are not dictated or officially uru:ed by you, and that no guarantee is given or implied on part of Government.

Aziz declared intention not leaving'Oman, but required residence in country. Wazir considered condition leaving 'Oman indispensable. This closed negociatiou, and Aziz has returned Semed. I returned yesteiday. The failnre of this attempt to come to an understanding with his brother was an unexpected and severe disappointment to Sayyid Turki.

Appeal of Sayyid Salim bin Thowainee to Sayyid Turki to obtain Ms release from detention in Hyderabad Fort. —On 31st March 1876, Colonel Miles forwarded for Resident's in formation copy of a letter which Sayyid Salih ad dressed to Sayyid Turki, characterizing his con dition as a State prisoner in Hyderabad Fort as From Residpnt, Persian Gulf, to Go- vernment of India, No. 341-64, dated 7th April 1876.

Arrest and iroprisonment by Sayyid Turk! of three IntrigTi- ing Bedouin Shaikhs—On 7tb April 1876, Colonel Miles reported that From Resident, p-r-.i™ Gnif, to Sa - V .T 1&lt;:1 ^ urk i ''ad taken the step of arresting and Government of India, Nos. 373.74, placing m confinement three of the Bedouin ^o V a^uw' S 'no. 1.50 Shaikhs who had caused bira most trouble and an- noyance by their sedition and intrigues. These were Amir bin Salim and Rashid bin Jumeea of the Bu Hasan, and Hamood bin ^ Saeed el Jahafi of the A1 Wahibeh, The two former were arrested at the instigation of certain influential members of their own tribe, who regarded their conduct as compromising the tribe generally. The third, Hamood el Jahafi. had been incessantly engaged in intrigue for some years, and had extorted con siderable sums of money from Sayyid Turki for allaying agitations which he had himself excited. On account of his extreme cunning, this man was deemed more dangerous than the others. 497. At the Sultan's request Colonel Miles recovered and handed over to him certain sums of money belonging to the prisoners, aggregating dollars 3,263, which were in the hands of British subjects at Maskat. 498. On 14th April Colonel Miles telegraphed :— 'Turki soliets sanction of Government to Hamood bin Saeed, Shaikh al Wahibeh, being confined in Karachi Jail, as Turki is apprehensive of intrigues and efforts release Hamood if latter remain Maskat. .Respectfully support Sultan's request, as tending to strengthen his position.'From Resident, Percinn Gulf, to Gov- t-rmnent of India, (telegram) dated 18tl) April 1876. deportation had been shown.

In submitting this application to Government, Captain Prideaux remarked that he did not con- sider that sufficient grounds for Shaikh Hamood's Colonel Miles reported that Shaikh Mansur and Humaidbin Khalifeen, of the A1 Wahibeh, had arrived at Maskat to intercede for Shaikh Hamood; they privately informed Sayyid Turki that had Hamood been put to death at once, it would have pleased them, but as this had not been done, it was now incumbent on them to intervene and protect the honour of the tribe. On 5th May Captain Prideaux instructed Colonel Miles as follows &lt;&lt; The orders of the Government of India do not warrant From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gov- an y interference in the case of Shaikh Haraood bin Said, A1 ment oi India, No. 4^7-90, dated ^^ibeh, and, with regard to this Chief and his fellow pri soners, Sayyid Turki should be left to pursue the course which he may consider most conducive to the interest of the state over which he rules/ These views are approved by Government. 501. On 8th and 22nd June Colonel Miles reported that the Sultan was experiencing some trouble and anxiety from the .k^fSTSSif!* efforts of the prisoners' tribes^ to obtain their dated uth Ausust 1876. _ release, but that, supported by his Minister, Sayyid foil, a ., August i87b, Nos. 3/-46. g aee( i ) he remained tirm in retaining them incarce rated. A few days later, however, he yielded to the pressure and threats of the tribes, backed by Shaikh Salih bin All, and, on 2nd July, the three Shaikhs were released and permitted to return to their country. Regarding their release. Colonel Miles wrote :— ' It is, of coui-se, impossible to foretell what may be the result of this step on His •Higbness's part, but it is not generally viewed with favour in Maskat. The Minister, Sayyid Saeed, however, is not,apprehensive of future trouUes arising from the machinations of these men, and informed me that, in his opinion, His Highness had, under the circumstances, no other course open to him to pursue.' 502. Kharita from Lord Northbrook to Sayyid Turki — Lord Korthbrook notified to Sayyid Turki by a kharita, dated 12th April 1876, his approaching departure from India, and Lord Lytton's appointment to suc ceed him. 503.—Application of Sayyid Salim bin Thowainee for an increase of allowance- —In May 1876 Sayyid Salim addressed to Colonel Beville, who had charge of him at Hyderabad, a request that Sayyid Turki might „ w 4. u • « ir ^ ^ be caused to increase his allowance of dollars 100 Irom Resident,:Persian Gulf,to G ot- .. . .. i -ij. j i n 1« ernment of India, No. 659-135, dated monthly.

The Sultan had been aware for some time that the 'Wali of Burka, Hamood bin Saif, and Sayyid Ibrahim were in correspondence, hut he had no suspicion that their From Resident, Persian Gulf, to communications were of a seditious character.

Had Savvid 1 urki not acted with promptitude and vigour on this occasion, it is probable that he would have lost both Burka and Suwaik. The Wali and garrison of Suwaik were left in charge until a more fitting season, although their disaffec tion was well known to the Sultan. 506. The Agency House at Maskat entailed by its owner on heirs From Resident, Persian Gulf, to perpetuity. —In June 1876 Colonel Miles re- Govemmentof India, No. 660—136, ported that Beebee Zainab, the owner of the house dR ^ni. fc B.f August^s?^ Nos. 2-13. rented by Government as the Political Agency and Consulate, Maskat, had recently executed a legal document, by which the ground and building were entailed on her heirs in perpetuity, thus preventing the future sale of the house. 507. Request of Sayyid Turki that Government would procure a From Resident,, Persian Gulf, to SteamOJT for him. On 22nd June Colonel Miles Government of India, No. 657—133, forwarded to the Acting Besident, for favourable d, p«ii 5 B, J A'4™ 8 u876.No,. 6 -6, consideration, copy of a letter addressed to him by Sayyid Turki, soliciting that Government would procure for him a steamer, and deduct her cost by instalments from the Zanzibar subsidy. In submitting this request to Government, Captain Prideaux remarked that, while concurring with Colonel Miles in his esti mate of the advantages which would accrue to the. Sultan from the posses sion of a steamer, he thought the proposed mode of payment open to objection, From Government of India, to Resi- and that . the C Ost of maintaining SUCh a VCSSel dert, Persian Gulf, No. 1829-p., dated would be inconvenient to His Higlmess.

Request of Sayyid Turki that the Political Agent would acknowledge bills drawn by him against instalments of the Zanzibar subsidy still undue. —In July, Colonel Miles reported that Sayyid Turki had requested Mm, through the Minis ter Sayyid Saeed, to— « acknowledge some accommodation bills issued by His Highness against the Zanzibar subsidy, bv giving verbal assurance to the holders that the amounts would be paid by Government, in the event of anything happening to His Highness, to the extent of such portion of the subsidy as might remain due/' Colonel Miles explained to the Minister that he could not comply with the request, because he had no authority to pay the subsidy to any one but Sayyid Turki personally, whereupon the Minister observed that, as the matter was one of much importance to the Sultan, he was instructed to beg that the sanction of Government might be obtained. Captain Prideaux, in addressing Government, remarked that— « he had no doubt that His Highness would be enabled to obtain advances from the banians on easier terms if it were known that the loans were made, not on his own personal security, but on that of the Government of India; but considering that the assumption of such a responsibility might, under certain circumstances, be embarrassing. Lieutenant-Colonel Miles had, he thought, acted with discretion in declining to lend an ear to the Minister's proposal.'

A., September 1876, Nos. 55-61. „ , .i i , . • t i i i Hamdan, Abdul Aziz and Muhammad, and con vinced that they were secretly intriguing with evilly disposed persons to subvert his authority. He had, therefore, determined to remove them from Maskat, and was about to despatch three of them to Kishm, where their brother Harib resided. The fourth, Sayyid Muhammad, was too unwell to be removed, and against a fifth, Sayyid Nasir, the Sultan did not entertain suspicions. Colonel Miles remarked:— ' So far as my own information extends, I have no reason to believe in the accusation against these young men, but Maskat is never free from intrigue, and His Highness has probably some ground for his proceedings.' 510.—Position of affairs in 'Oman on 1st September 1876. —Although at this date there was a lull of active opposition to Sayyid Turki's rule, the situation did not promise any great duration of tranquillity. The three turbu lent Bedouin Shaikhs, Hamood El Jahafi, Amir bin Salim, and Hashid bin Jumeea, whom the Sultan had taken courage to arrest and imprison in April, but had set at liberty in July, were striving to organize a coalition of Sharki- yah tribes to attack him. Shaikh Sali bin Ali was ostensibly endeavouring to counteract their efforts, but in him no trust could be placed. Sayyid Abdul Aziz had, since the failure of negotiations to effect an arrangement between him and the Sultan in May, been residing at Semed in straitened cir cumstance^. His co-operation in any enterprise to subvert his brother's au thority might be reckoned upon. Sayyid Salim bin Thowainee was a State 120121 prisoner at Hyderabad in Sind, and Sayyid Ibrahim bin Kais was livino' at, bk town of llostak. The Wazir, Sayyid Said bin Muhammad, whom 'Savvid Turki had appointed to that office on his return from Gwadar in May had proved a competent adviser, and Sayyid Turki himself had recently disolaved less puerility of character. 4 ^ ' 511—Eaid of Shaikh Hamood El Jahafi of the A1 Wahibah in El Batinah,—On lull September 1876, Colonel Miles reported that Shaikh Hamood El Jahafi and the rebel party in El Sharkiyah had at length suc ceeded in mustering a force, and had left for 'Oman, with the intentionof raid ing El Batinah. Sayyid Turki thought they would endeavour to plunder Seeb, and, as there was no fort there, the Political Agent, at the Sultan's re quest, directed the Hindu traders to remove themselves and their property to Burka or Maskat. H.M S. Arab proceeded to Seeb to afford the traders the protection of her presence, and any assistance they might require. 512.

The Hindu traders and their valuables had been removed from Seeb by H.M.S. Arab, but they had left some goods in the warehouses, which Shaikh Hamood plundered. The Sultan intimated to Colonel Miles that, as the banians had had full notice and time to remove their property, he did not consider himself responsible for their losses. 513. TV hile at Seeb, Shaikh Hamood wrote to the Political Agent, From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gov- ^minding him how certain moneys, which he 0 had erument of India, No. 227, dated 7th deposited with British subjects at Maskat had 0c poV A .? 7 j 6 anuary 1877, Nos. 8-59. w ' ien was imprisoned in April, 1875, been given U P to Sayyid Turki.

To this letter Voii. a V , j^uuaJy 1877, Nos. 8-5:&gt;. Colonel Miles did not reply—a course which Govern ment approved. £14. By summoning the Shaikhs of various tribes, chiefly Ghafiri, to his aid, Sayyid Purki got together a force of seven or eight hundred men to oppose Hamood. These he despatched under Sayyid Saif bin Hamad to Seeb, but by the time they arrived there, Hamood had gone northwards to Saham, where he plundered the Hindu traders of Rs. 5,000, and otherwise maltreated them. Sayyid Turki, warned by Shaikh Salih bin Ali, had ordered Sayyid Beder bin Saif, the Wali of Sohar, to take special measures for the protection of Saham, and Sayyid Beder had placed a guard there,' but, misled by rumour, had with drawn it.

A request for an advance of dollars 3,000 on account of the Zanzibar subsidy, made by the Sultan and supported by Colonel Miles, was granted by the Acting Resident, Government sub sequently intimating appioval. 517. The Ma'awal of Wadi Ma'awal having risen in opposition to the Sultan, in consequence of two of their tribesmen having been imprisoned by the Governor of Burka, Shaikh Hamood joined them. 518. On 27th October Colonel Miles reported that Snyyid Turki's position with regard to the rebels had not improved, that negotiations were being carried on through one November 1876. Shaikh Barghash, but that nothing had as yet Poll A , January 1877, Nos. 8-59. been arr . lT1 g e(L The s u itan had then with him at Burka not more than &lt;500 men, having dismissed the Jenebeh and Deros tribes, on whom he had previously much depended. Colonel Miles wrote ' These tribes would have been of great service, probably, had His Highness really intended to march out and punish Haraood and his followers, but, as Sayyid Turki has preferred negotia tions to hostilities, they became a useless burden and expense. The present state of affairs discloses very clearly the extreme feebleness of His Highness Sayyid Turki's hold on the country, and his inability to hold the reins with firrriness. His Highness never had a better opportunity of striking a blow at rebellion, but his conduct in the present juncture will not, 1 fear, tend to strengthen his position. The A1 Wahibeh, the tribe to which Shaikh Hamood belongs, is now. at feud with five or six powerful tribes, including the Jenebeh, Beni Bu Hasan, and El Hishm, and, had His Highness taken the field with the support of these tribes, he could have driven Hamood back to his country with ease, and would have done more for the pacification of the country than he could effect by any amount of expenditure.^ 519. A report that Sayyid Ibrahim bin Kais had risen, and was expected to move upon Burka and Mattrah, caused Colonel ernm 0 ent R of'ImhafNo.'Tss! datS mh Miles to request the Commander of H.M.S. Mifle- man to proceed to Burka, to protect the Indian traders there. Although his report proved in correct, it was afterwards ascertained that it had not been without founda tion. Sayyid Ibrahim tried to persuade the Yal Sa'ad to rise with him, but they, mindful of the punishment inflicted upon them at Mesna'ah two years before, declined to do so. 520. Sayyid Turki left Burka secretly on the night of the 26th October in a small boat, accompanied by two attendants only, and without communicat ing his intention to the Commandant, or any one in the place. He reached Maskat on the 28th. 521. On the 10th November Colonel Miles reported that a collision bad occurred between the revolted Maawal tribe, aided by Shaikh Hamood, and the people of Nakhl, in which the latter had been routed with a loss of 17 killed. A proposal, made by Shaikh Barghash, as mediator, that Sayyid Turki should pay Hamood dollars 2,000 to retire to his own country, was rejected by the Sultan, and negotia tions broken off. Some days later a party of 40 of the Maawal were waylaid by 200 of the Nakhl men, and cut to pieces. 522. This incident afforded Sayyid Turki an opportunity to intervene, and, From Resident* Persian duif, to Gov- ' n , 81,1 December Colonel Miles reported that the eminent of India, No. 227, dated loth Sultan had despatched Shaikh Muhammad bin 1877, Nos, 39.56 Abdullah of the Beni Bu Ali, Shaikh Alliyah bin Rashid of the Beni BuaHasan, Shaikh Said bm Sultan El Amiri, and some others, to Nakhl and Wadi Maawal, to arrange a 122 November 1876.

' 527. Sayyid Abdul Aziz.— After the rejection by Sayyid Abdul Aziz, Precis, paragraph 493. ^ 1S76 ' of Sayyid Turki's olier of an allowance of dollars 500 monthly, on the condition that he retired from 'Oman and resided in India, negotiations to that precise From Resident,* Persian Gulf, to ^ Wer ® ^ ^newed : but, in the following Government of India, No. 207, dated August, Shaikh Salih bin Ali submitted to the iet' septembeMS^ ^ ^ ^Sulten certain proposals, regarding which Colonel Miles wrote:— ' I understand from the Minister, Sayyid Said, that the proposal is to locate Sayyid Abdul Aziz at Seeb, or some other place where there is no fort, and where he w T ill have no facilities for intrigue. Sayyid ^bdul Aziz still persistently refuses to leave •'Oman, but he is greatly pressed for expenses, and, should a sufficient allowance be granted him, it seems not improb able that he might accept this arrangement.' 528.

The Minister, Sayyid Said, informed Colonel Miles that the El Haboos had already been paid dollars 500 for the anticipated service, and were to receive dollars 1,000 more on its completion.

On 30th March Colonel Miles reported:— ' His Highnes Sayyid Turki _ha^ of late been again advised by several influential persons to giant his brother Abdul Aziz a small pension, and Sayyid Hilal bin Ahmed, whom His Highness consulted on the subject, strongly counselled him to do so. Sayyid Turki is much inclined to this course himself, as he told me that his brother was living in a pitiable state of poverty at Semed, but he has not yet decided upon granting anything. 'This is owing, I have reason to believe, to the counsel of the Minister Sayyid Said, who is averse to any arrangement beino- made with Sayyid Abdul Aziz, short of his leaving the country. I am somewhat afraid this advice is dictated more by feelings of private animosity than by consideration for His Highnesses interests on the part of the Minister, as there can be little doubt that the grant of a small sum, sufficient for his subsistence, but not enough for purposes of intrigue, would go far to remove the temptation to revolt on the part of Abdul Aziz.

He has since then been repeatedly reminded of the matter, and has, as o ten piomised, a settlement, but, owing to his constant pecuniary embarrassments, he has not yet done anything towards clearing them off. About two months ago, I again personally brought the matter to His Highness's recollection, and requested his serious attention to it. icar ot no steps being taken in the matter however, until I received the accompanying e ei, in w ic is iighness proposes to liquidate the claims, amounting to dollars 4,739, y ins a men s o dollars 1,000, deducted quarterly from the subsidy, which would thus require a ou one veai and a quarter.

' 0n tlle occurrences at Mesna'ah in March 1874, being reported to Government I re ceived instructions from the Political Resident, Colonel Koss, to investigate and report'on the losses sustained by British subjects at the hands of Sayyid Ibrahim and the rebels. A punch- ayat of merchants was accordingly assembled at Maskat to assist in the inquiry and all the evidence that could be produced by the Mesna'ah traders on behalf of their claims was taken The claims then submitted amounted to a total of dollars 11,067, and one other claim subsequently admitted of dollars 1,650, making the whole dollars 13,717. ' The amount recovered from the Yal Sa^ad, dollars 9,600, was distributed rateably amongst the traders, giving to each of them a share equal to about fths of his claim The balance still due on these claims amounts therefore to dollars 3,117. As most of the trade books have been destroyed, and no fresh evidence regarding the state of the property possessed by the claimants and plundered during the outrage is likely to be forthcoming, I fear it would not be possible, by re-investigating the claims, to arrive at a more correct estimale of the actual extent of the losses sustained, and I would, most respectfully, submit that the amount already given of dollars 12,717 be adopted, as representing the total loss of the Mesna'ah traders.' 538. Colonel Prideaux, after pointing out a tri fling mistake in Colonel Miles' calculation, and show ing that the balance was properly dollars 3,144- 50, added :— &lt;f It remains for His Excellency in Council to decide whether, as an act of grace towards the Sultan, the sum should be remitted.

Compensation to Indian traders plnndered at Sahara, by Shaikh Hamood El Jahafi in October 1876.-- On 22nd December 1876,_ Colonel Miles, in sub- January 1877 ^ mitting a statement of claims made by the Indian Poii. a., july is/7, n. a. 126-140. traders, plundered at Saham by Shaikh Hamood El Jahafi. in the previous October, wrote:— ' The accounts and vouchers of these traders have been investigated by myself and as committee of merchants, and the claims, as now set down, are believed to be fair and just. The statements of all the other traders corroborate those of the two men whose depositions are, attached in essential points. They all aver that the inhabitants of Saham assisted in plund ering their property, when the example had been set by Hamood and his people. This is con firmed by other evidence I have obtained, and there is, I believe, no room for doubt in the matter. The traders are unanimous in declaring that they have no wish or intention to return to Saham, and, considering that the Arabs of that town, not only did not protect them from Hamood, which undoubtedly they were well able to do, but even assisted to despoil them, 1 think it as well they should not resettle there under the circumstances. «It will be observed that of the claims submitted, part is for property actually plundered and part, tns., dollars 2,517, is for outstandings against the inhabitants of Saham and it vicinity. These outstanding debts have been included, as there is little or no chance of their being recovered unless the traders return thither, and it may be a question for consideration whether the Saham people should not be made to pay compensation for at least this part of the claim.' From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gov- 5^ Colonel Prideaux addressed Government as ernment of India, No 6, dated 6tb » January 1877. lOllOWS Poll. A., July 1877, Nos. 126-140. ' It appears from the statements that the actual value of the property plundered from the Indian traders amounted to dollars 3,514 : but an additional sum of dollars 2,5 17 is claimed on account of outstanding debts at Saham, of which, it is stated, there is no chance of recovery unless the traders return to that place—a measure to which the Political Agent is opposed. ' The plunder of these traders was chiefly owing to the neglect and inaction of the Governor of Sohar, Sayyid Bedar bin Saif. Although this Chief had received timely warning that Shaikh Hamood was expected to attack Saham, he failed to take any effectual precautions for the protec tion of the town. The local authorities, moreover, appear to have deserted the place on the ap proach of Shaikh Hamood, and to have left it in the hands of some subsidized Bedouins, who assisted the insurgents in plundering the bazaar. ' The insurrection in the Batinah is reported to be at an end, and it would be useless to look for the recovery of the plundered property from those who were lately in rebellion. The responsibility for an event which might have been averted, if the officers of Sayyid Turki had displayed a little more activity and vigour, must, in my opinion, fall upon His Highness. The case is one of some hardship, for it is tolerably clear that if his orders had been obeyed, the place would not have suffered. It is, therefore, with some regret that I feel compelled to record the opinion that His Highness should be called upon to indemnify the traders for the losses actually incurred by them in the plunder of the town. I am not yet prepared to say that the accident of the town having been once plundered by Bedouins is an insuperable obstacle to the return of the traders ; or that, if the town were occupied by an efficient garrison, it would not be possible to secure payment of its outstanding debts by the ordinary means employed in such cases- On this point 1 shall request a further expression of opinion from the Political Agent before submitting my views finally to Government.' 542. To Colonel Miles the Resident wrote :— ' To compensate the traders for losses, which might be classed as ordinary mercantileI&amp;/!- isks in semi-civilized countries, might, I think, in certain cases, be inconveuieut as a precedent.' Colonel Miles replied :— ' With regard to the question of payment of compensation for the outstanding debts of the From Eesident, Persian Gulf, to Saham trader, I am quite of opinion that, so far as the Government of India. No. 37, dated traders are concerned, and apart from the policy of the step, 17th February 1877 the debts might be considered as ordinary mercantile risks • Poll. A., July 18/7, Nos. 126-140. and if it be decided that the burden is to fall upon His Highness the Sultan, I see no reason why they should not be allowed to stand over. But I would point out th^t the disaster which occurred at Saham, though partly the result of Sayyid Hedar's mistake, was also due to the treachery and misconduct of the people of the town, the Yal Bu Kareyn, wiio were certainly bound to protect peaceable strangers residing in their midst, but who not only did not do so, but even raised their bands against them. ' It is on account of the action of this tribe that I coincide in the objection of the Saham banians' return to that place. The \ al Bu Kareyn so far have profited more by the transac tion than Shaikh Hamood and the rebels, as they not only secured their share of the booty, but have also relieved themselves of a load of debt. 1 do not look on the mere fact of the town having been plundered by the Bedouins as a matter of any great significance in an unsettled country lilie 'Oman. It may be useless to look to Shaikh Hamood and his followers for reparation, but it would be, I believe, by no means difficult to punish the Yal Bu Kareyn, and to obtain some redress from them. Such a course would, I consider, be highly advan tageous to British and commercial interests on this coast, and also t'&gt; His Highness Sayyid 'lurid, but I doubt whether His Highness could coerce the tribe without support and assistance from the British Government.' 543. Regarding these views Colonel Prideaux remarked :— ' The drift of Colonel Miles' letter is that the British Government should take upon From Resident, Persian Gulf, to ltself the task of coercing the Yal Bu Kareyn, with a view Government of India, No. 37, dated to obtaining redress from that tribe for their conduct towards 17th February 1877. the Britif-h traders. I have before observed that the plunder Poll, a ., July 1877, os. ^ . 0 £ traders was due to the fact that the Governor of Sohar, Sayyid Beder bin Saif, neglected to obey the instructions which he had received from his master, Sayyid Turki. Lieutenant-Colonel Miles admits that the disaster was partly the result of Sayyid Bedar's mistake, but adds that it was also due to the treachery and misconduct of the people of the town. But it is plain that the people of the town would not have had an opportunity of behaving treacherously if Sayyid Bedar had obeyed his instructions and taken proper measures for the protection of the place. The losses of the traders resulted partly from the attack made by Shaikh Hamood's Bedouins, and partly from the people of the town taking advantage of that attack to do some plundering on their own account. But the primary responsibility must still rest on the Sultan's officers, who failed to do their duty, and I see no grounds for changing my opinion that we must look to His Highness for any reparation which it may be decided to enforce. ' With regard to compensating the traders for their outstanding debts, the policy of such a measure appears to me very questionable. If the inhabitants of a town find that they can wipe off their scores with the local Indian traders by the additional process of plundering and frightening them out of the place, they will not be slow to take advantage of this ' new way to pay old debts.' It also appears very unlikely that the Bedouins and rabble of the town, who joined in the plunder, were the persons with whom the Indians had mercantile transactions. I would, therefore, respectfully suggest that, while His Highness Sayyid Turki should be held accountable for the actual losses incurred in the plunder of the town, the Indian traders should be informed that they should hand in their accounts to the Political Agent, and should request him to employ his good offices with the Maskat Government in a settlement of their outstanding claims against Maskat subjects residing in 644.

From Resident, Persian Gulf, to 5^3 J q reply to a request of Colonel Ml 'leS for N °' 87, ^ instructions, Colonel Prideaux wrote ' I have to observe that under Article I of the Commercial Treaty with Maskat, the subjects of Her Britannic Majesty have full liberty to enter, reside in, trade with, and pass with their merchandize through all parts of the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, and that, under Article VIII of the same instrument, if a subject of His Highness, the Sultan of Maskat. should resist or evade payment of his just debts to a British subject, the authority of His Highness snail afford to the British subject every aid and facility in recovering the amount due. Under the strict constructio' of the treaty, therefore, 1 am of opinion that His Highness is not at liberty to prevent the banians in question from residing and carrying on trade within the towns of Dil and Sahara, should they think fit to do so; and I further consider that Sayyid Bedar bin Saif, who is stated in your letter under reply to be the local authority in those towns, should afford thera every aid and facility in his power in recovering the outstanding debts, which one of the banians alleges he is desirous of collecting at Sahara. £&lt; It only remains to consider whether there are such exceptional circumstances in^the present case as would justify temporary relaxation of the treaty obligations of Sayyid Turki. The town of Sahara was lately exposed to the attack of a party of Bedouin Arabs, and some of the resident banians suffered mal-treatment and losses at their hands, but there seems to be no reason to suppose that this attack will be repeated, and the banians themselves assert that they are not apprehensive of ill-usage from the inhabitants of the district. We cannot be too cautious in permitting any departure from the engagements of a treaty, on which we principally rely for the privileges and the advantages enjoyed by British subjects in Maskat territory. ' I am, therefore, of opinion that, pending the receipt of instructions from the Govern ment of India, to whom the question will be referred for final decision, the banians should be permitted, if they wishit, to reside in Dil and Sahara, and that His Highness the Sultan should be requested to convey to Sayyid Bedar bin Saif his orders to afford thera every aid and facility in his power, in effecting the recovery of their outstanding claims.' 549. On the 26th April Colonel Miles reported :y~ ' I have communicated to His Highness Sayyid Turki your opinion that the banians should be permitted, if they wish it, to reside in Dil and Saham, and I have requested his Highness to desire Sayyid Bedar bin Saif to aid thera in effecting the recovery of their out standing claims.' 550. Allowance granted by Sayyid Turki to his nephews, Muham- 128mad, Abdul Aziz, and Hamdan, sons of the late Sayyid Thowalnee— In Prom Eendent, Persian Gulf, to Got . J ''y&gt; 18b7, Colonel Miles received from Sayyids erament of India, No. 16, dated 20th JViuDaminad, Abdul Aziz, and Hamdan sons of the ^PoiY^March 1877, Nos. 32-38. late Sayyid Thowainee, whom Sayyid Turki had, _ . ln Jul y 1^76, deported from Maskat, and who were residing at Lmgah, a letter, praying him to move the Sultan to grant them Precis, paragraph 509. an a ^ ovvan ce sufficient for their wants. The letter concluded with the remark :— From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 31, dated 9th February 1877. Poll. A., March 1877, Nos. 32-38. ' Should we not obtain our desires ? Be not offended if we resort to other means to obtain them. Let each look to himself.' 551. The threat caused Sayyid Turki to refuse compliance with the request, when first brought to his notice, but on 2nd February Colonel Miles reported In a further conversation I had, a few days since, with His Highness, relative to the sons of the late Sayyid Thowai nee, His Highness informed me that he had resolved to grant an allowance 10 them, to commence from the first of the pre sent Muhammadan month. ' By this mail, however, His Highness received another letter from them, of the same objectionable tone as the former one, and His Highness was at first disposed to alter his inten- tion about the allowance, but on his sending the letter over for my perusal, 1 suggested the advisability of his taking no notice of it,- and to this Sayyid Turki has been good enough to accede. The amount he lias arranged to give them is dollars 120 a month. The mail nas aiso brought me a letter from these young men of the same purport as the former one, and I have, at His Highnesses request, taken the opportunity, in my reply, to express disapproval of the tone they have chosen to adopt in their applications to the Sultan in this matter.'

Request of Sayyid Turki for aid to recover possession of SoWaik Port. —In February 1877 Sayyid Turki addressed to Colonel Miles a request that Government would grant him the aid of a man of-war to recover possession of Sowaik Fort from the Governor, Shaik Saif bin Hamad, whom he believed to be intriguing against him, 554. Colonel Prideaux in forwarding to Gov ernment the application and Colonel Miles's obser vations thereon, epitomized them and submitted his own views as follows :— 'The Commandant of the fort, Shaikh Saif bin Hamad of the Beni Ruweyeh tribe, has, for some time past, been suspected by His Highness of intriguing against his authority. His Highness states he has no desire to deprive the Commandant of his charge, provided he comes and gives in his submission, and sues for forgiveness for his past misdeeds. His Highness, however, virtually admits that nothing overt i*an be proved against the Commandant, and it is not likely, therefore, that the latter will trust himself in His Highnesses power, merely for the purpose of clearing up a vague suspicion. If Sayyid Turki distrusts his chiefs, his chiefs will naturally distrust him, and His Highness would, in my opinion, display a wiser policy if be would drop this constant attitude of suspicion, and adopt a more frank and cordial demeanour in dealing with his subordinate officers. I venture to think that there is nothing to call for a despatch of a vessel-of-war to Sowaik, even if one could be conveniently spared at the present juncture. A few words of advice, dissuasive of any attempt to coerce the garrison of Sowaik would probably be more opportune than any assistance which a vessel of-war could afford.' do^PeSgui^n' 555 &gt; In rep'y the Resident was instructed : - 30th April 1877. u The Government of India concurs in your opinion that o . a., Apnl 1877, Nos. 309-312. there is no necessity to despatch a British vessel-of-war to 129130 Sowaik, and that a few words of advice to Sayyid Turki, dissuasive of any attempt on hi* part to coerce the garrisoi^ of tbat place, would be more opportune than any assistance which a mau -of&lt;war could afford. 1 am to request that a reply in this sense may be sent to His Highness through the Political Agent ; Maskat.' 556. Sayyid Harib bin Tbowainee removes from Kishm to Bassi- dore.—On 28tli March 1877, Sayyid Harib bin Thowainee, tlien at Kishm, addressed to the Resident a request that Government would mediate between him and Sayyid Turki, and induce the Sultan to' allow him to reside at Maskat, as he had reason to complain of the conduct of the Shaikh of Kishm towards him. He begged that, in the event of Sayyid Turki refusing to have him at Maskat, he might be allowed to live at Basidore. 557. In reply, Colonel Prideaux informed him, through Assistant Surgeon Hakeem, in charge of Bassidoie Station, that he saw no objection to his re siding there— ' provided he is content to live in a quite &gt; unobtrusive manner^ and abstain from any intrigues or behaviour calculated to disturb the, tranquillity of Maskat. ' 558. To the Political Agent, Ma&amp;kat, the Eesident wrote ' If you could find an opportunity of bringing to the notice of Sayvid Turki, in an unofficial way, the desire of Sayyid Harib to be reconciled to His Highhess, I can see no objec tion to your doing so/^ Colonel Miles replied :— ' I have mentioned the desire of Sayyid Harib bin Thowainee to be reconciled to his uncle in conversation with His Highness Sayyid Turki, and was informed by His Highness that he had no ill-feeling towards his nephew, but that he objected to Sayyid Harib residing in Maskat, on account of the opportunity it would give to ill-disposed persons to intrigue. His Highness thought it better Sayyid Hai-ib should not come to 'Oman. I did not consider it advisable to press the subject on His Highness.^ On 25th May, the Assistant Surgeon at Bassidore, reported that Sayyid Harib had taken up his residence there. 559. Rising of El Sharkiyeh tribes under Shaikh Salih bin Ali and Sayyid Ibrahim bin Kais: Siege of Maskat r Repulse of the rebels by H.M.S. Teazer, —Rumours of the seditious activity of Sayyid Turki*® enemies in El Sharkiyeh, the most considerable of whom were Shaikh Hamood El Jahafi of the A1 Wahibah, and Shaikh Amir and Bashid of the Beni Bu Hasan, reached Maskat from time to time during the early part of 1877. On 26th April Colonel Miles reported;— ' The movement in El Sharkiyeh has again shown signs of becoming serious, as the „ disaffected tribes have since gained the adhesion of the Government o/India, No^iiJ,' dated *eligiou8 faction, who are now engaged in encouraging other 4th May. tribes to rise, and in urging the need for rebellion agamst Poll. a., Koveiwber 1878, No. 105 His Highness Sayyid Turki, on the ground of His High- to ness's irreligiousness and laxity of morals.'' ' It appears also that Shaikh Salih bin Ali has found it to his interest to join them, op at least to sever his connection with the Sultan outwardly, as he has written to His Higlw ness to request him to discontinue his allowance. 44 The threatened rising was for the time being averted by the action of Shaikh From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Salih bin Ali, to whom Sayyid Turki despatched SETm ^ isw . ^ lUt ^ a confidential a^nt with a considerable sum of Poii. a., Kovember ma, No. los, money. Shaikh Salih, while accepting the bribe, (A t01 ** intimated that the allowance of dollars 100 monthly, which the Sultan had hitherto paid him, would, in future, be insuf ficient. -560. Early in May a collision occurred between tlie Ghafiris and TUnn wees in the Semail Valley, which Sayyid Turki deemed to be of such serious import that he deputed the Minister Sayyid Said to the spot, to endeavour to effect an amicable arrangement between the parties. In this he only nartiallv rStd kisfatkfied! ^ ^ ^ aSreed Up0n ' but the Hiaawees 561.

To this communication the Acting Political Agent replied:—&gt; 'I have .to inform you that any attempt on your part to attack Mattrah or Maskat will From Resident, Persian Gulf, to ^ &gt;e re £? ar ded as a rebellion against an esteemed ally of the Government of India, No. 161, dated British Government, and VOU will be held responsible for all ^kllTSember 1878, No. 105 suiting to.yourself and others from your (A to I). rebellious actions. 663. On the 14th June the rebels, under the leadership of Shaikh Salih bin Ali, reached Mattrah and occupied it unopposed, and on the 15th H.M.S. Teaztr opportunely arrived at Maskat. 564. Mr. Kobertson reported on 21st June :— ' Soon after the news of Shaikh Salih's advance from El Sharkiyeh got abroad, it was rumomed that Sayyid Abdul Aziz accompanied him. It turned out, however, that they had met at Mansah, a place in the Semial V alley, but failed to come to an understanding, and Abdul Aziz returned to Seemed, where he usually resides. Shaikh Salih bin Ali then made overtures to Sayyid Ibrahim bin Kais, who joined him at Mattrah on the 17th. 14th instant, before the occupation of Mattrah, Colonel Miles and I proceeded thither, and took the steps which his experience suggested as being necessary for the preser vation of the lives and property of the Hindu traders. These consisted in causing them to remove with their valuables on board the vessels in the harbour. The Khojahs, consider ing themselves safe within their walled enclosure, elected to remain there. a After the occupation of Mattrah, it became evident that the rebel movement was not a mere raid, with the object of plunder and extortion, but that it resulted from a well- organized coalition of the Muttowwas, or fanatical faction, to overthrow Sayyid Turki's government; and, so well had the enterprise-been planned, that Sayyid Turki's usual supporters were prevented by local dissensions and other indirect means from coming to his aid. On the 15th I received from His Highness, with whom I had been in constant verbal Communication, a formal request in writing for an advance on account of the Zanzibar subsidy, and for armed assistance against the rebels, who, by this time, blockaded Maskat on the land side, and deprived the inhabitants of sweet water. I called on His Highness and told him, in reply to his letter, that, as regarded an advance of money, I could not make it on my own authority, but would request your instructions on the subject. With reference to the armed assistance, I was prepared, when Maskat was seriously threatened, to afford it to him, as far as the guns of H.M.S. Teazer could reach. This I considered right, because the situation appeared to be precisely that contemplated by Government, when the instructions, dated 16th August 1875, were given. The conduct of the rebels, in plundering and setting fire to the bazaar at Mattrah, also caused me to regard with great apprehension their entry into Maskat, where British property to the value of many lacs of dollars would be at their mercy. 131 i p fill Jii ! ■ ill „ #11 ll'i | ' U ^ r'The rebel force was variously estimated at from 1.000 to 1,500, and the defenders of the town did not exceed 200. Such being the odds, it seemed possible that, despite anything he Team mio-ht do, the rebels were capable of effecting an euiranee, and it was highly necessary to ptace the lives of British subjects beyond their reach, brfore exasperating them bv oneuine fire. I, therefore, issued an order to all the banians in Maskat to go on board the shin-'in the harbour, and then wrote a letter to Sayyid Ibrahim, copy of winch is annexed warning bun that, if his force attempted to enter the town the W would open fire upon them. To this letter I received no answer but at sunset on the 17th the rebels appeared to be preparing for the assanlf, and Captain Wodehouse at the requisition ot Say vid TurUi, fired some shots into the valley behind the town. A few more sho s were fired at midnight and they seemed to have had the desired effect, as the enemy, although frequently seen in the course ot the night, did not attack. ''On the 18th, Sayyid Turki requested that H.M.S. TWr might proceed to Mattrah. and dislodue from certain houses adjoining the citadel some rebels ot the Haboos and other tribes, whose fire was galling the garrison. His wishes were earned out, and 1 took the onmrtunity to remove under cover of the guns all British subjects from the Khoiah Fort, and to place them in safety on board the ships in the harbour, that done, the Tedz^r returned to Maskat, and pursued the same course as on the previous night. The rebels appeared at various points during the night, but did not attack. a Sha i k h Salih had obtained the adhesion of the predatory tribes who accompanied him bv the promise of plunder, as well as specific pecuniary rewards, and tbey had been led to believe that little or no resistance would be oftered to their entry into Maskat. 'On the 19th they began to show signs of dissension, and some of them sent messages to Sawid Turki, tendering excuses for their presence, and stating that they had been deceived, and were about to retire. Sham is bin Hasan, a Shaikh of the Awamir arrived from Shaikh Salih, offering to come to terms, and it became evident that the coalition was break in 0- up Sayyid Turki replied by Shamis that he would hold no communication with Shaikh Sa4 until he and his followers retired to Rui, which they did m the course of he nio-ht On the following day I took Sayyid Said at His Highness s request to Matt rah in the Ttazer. He proceeded thence to Falaj and had an interview with Shaikh Sahh, who demanded dollars 20,000 and the continuation of his own and Sayyid Ibrahim s allowances, as conditions of their retiring. When consulted regarding these demands I expressed an opinion that they were absurd, and that any demmd tor money on Shaikh Sahh s part should, for the present, be firmly resisted, especially as His Highness's supporters were now beginning to arrive from various directions, and Maskat was no longer in much danger. This morning His Hio-hness sent word to Shaikh Salih that he would pay him nothing, and that he might stay or 0 go as he pleased. It is reported that the rebel force is breaking up rapidly. 'To iudo-e by the conduct of the Bedouins at Mattrah and Sadab, where they plundered everything within their reach, and wantonly massacred several children and unarmed negroes, it is obvious that the consequence of their entry into Maskat must have been most depiorable. I trust, therefore, that my action, wherein I was guided by the advice of Colonel Miles, w 1 be approved, and I beg to bring prominently to the notice of Government the very ready and able manner in which Commander Capel Wodehouse of H.M.S. Itazer co-operate with me, and the extreme courtesy and cordiality with which he carried out al my suggestions.^ 565. la addressing Government, Colonel Prideaux remarked: ' It mav be useful if I recapitulate the orders which have, from time to time been issued by the Government of India, when a crisis of a similar nature to that which has just occurred has threatened the safety of Maskat, and imperilled the numerous British interests which are dependent on, the tranquillity of that place. In January 18 ? 4, when balih bin i occupied Mattrah and was preparing to attack Maskat, much in the same manner as e i^ now reported to have done, the Government of India telegraphed to Lieutenant-Colonel rtoss- f You have full' power to help Turki actively so far as guns of vessels -of-war wi reach, and to protect British interest. Undertake no operation on shored Shortly atter- wards, when Maskat was threatened by Ibrahim bin Kais, the Government I^ ,a , f yraphed: 1 Active assistance on Batinah coast cannot be given to Turki; if Maska W attacked, former instructions in Salih's case will apply/ Some explanatory remarks weie added in a further telegraph: 'As regards matters in which Turki only is concerned, an interests of British subjects are not immediately concerned, Major Miles will be careful to ge Turki's assent to his action. With this proviso, and subject to the condition that no oper ations are to be undertaken on shore, Major Miles should support Turki as far as guns iota sea can reach, as already directed.' These instructions were confirmed in a later telegiam from the Government of India. ' It is to be gathered from Mr. Aitchison's despatch, No^, dated 12th December, 132 if.Itlw 1^''' Silii*' X0 M- ofl^^ .0* !&gt;' COlK^®'' h^. ¥'■: nc P ■ 3874, that these instructions were merely applicable to the particular emergencies which called No. 758-P., dated 20tli February 1875. t ^ tin ^ 01 /''j and that they did not amount to a general and unconditional promise of support to Sayud Turki.

The Political Agent was informed thatj if the Sultan asked formally in writing for active support, he was to give it him as far as the guns of oitr vessels could reach, but that armed assistance should not he volunteered, nor should it be given unless, on the occasion of any particular crisis, it was formally asked tbr. If the lives and pr peity ol Butish subjects were in danger, the Political Agent was authorized to do whatever might be necessary for their protection. But he was enjoined to bear in mind the general policy of non-interference in the internal offairs of 'Oman, if it could possibly be avoided ' In the emergency which the Political Agent was recently called upon to meet, there was no question ot interference in the dynastic or internal affairs of'Oman. If the attempt had succeeded, there would doubtless have been a change of dynasty ; but such a contingency was beyond the bounds of the Political Agent s province. He had been apprised by the insurgent chief that the property of the British subjects who had settled in Masifat, under the shelter of the British flag was in danger, and he had received a formal requisition from the Sultan for assistance. If the Bedouins, whose bait was plunder, had entered Maskat, the loss of property, and probably of life, would have been most serious. Under the circumsta ces I do not think Mr. Robertson could have followed any other course than that which he adopted ; and it is a subject of congratulation that the immediate success of the steps which he felt compelled to take will be followed in all likelihood by permanent results of the most beneficial kind to British interests. « During the crisis which Mr. Robertson was called upon to face, within a day or two after his arrival at Maskat, he possessed the advantage of the experience and advice of Lieuten ant-Colonel Miles, who had given over charge of his office, but had not yet left the pi tee; and I have much pleasure in transmitting to the Government of India a copy of a letter from thit officer to my address, in which he records his full concurrence in the advisability of the measures taken by Mr. Robertson for the protection of British interests. But the responsibility of these measures rested upon Mr. Robertson alone; and I trust that I shall be authorized to con vey to that officer the approval of His Excellency in Council of the firm and judicious conduct he displayed in dealing with the very difficult circumstances under which he was placed/'' 566. Government signified approval of the Acticg Political Agent's proceedings and the services rendered by Captain Wodehouse of H.M.S.

JMsre'* in the interests of British subjects, throughout the disturbances at Maskat, also merits commendation, and the Marine Department has been requested to convey, through His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief of Her Majesty's Naval Forces in the East Indies, the acknowledgments of the Government of India for the valuable services rendered by Captain VVodehouse upon this occasion ' 567. Break-up of the rebel force under Shaikh Salih bin Ali and Sayyid Ibpahim bin Kais •• Proceedings of Shaikh Hamooi El Jahafi and the A1 Wahibah: Advance of dollars 2,000 to Sayyid Turki on account of the Zanzibar subsidy.— On 5tli July Mr. Robertson reported 'The Muttowwa Force at Falaj broke up and dispersed on the 'Jlst ultimo.

'He also wrote to the leading Khqjahs at Mattrah, who own lionses and date-groves at Bosber, threateuing- their property with destruction if a sum of dollars 1,500, which he had deposited with one of them in 1875, were not produced. The deposit in question having been claimed by, and delivered to, Sayyid Turki, when he seized and imprisoned Hamood in April 1876, I instructed the Khojahs to refer Hamood to His Highness/' 568. Sayyid Turki consulted the Acting Political Agent to 'wliat course he sliould take with regard to Shaikh Hamocd. As the Sultan could only muster a mixed force of 850 men against 500 or 6C0 of the A1 'Wahihah, and as the consequence of a reverse would probably have been the re-investment and plunder of Maskat, Mr. Robertson thought it better that Sayyid Turki should comply with Hamood's demand than risk a battle. 569. The Saltan addressed to the Acting Political Agent an urgent request for dollars 2,000 on account of the instalment of the Zanzibar subsidy due at the end of the month, with which Mr. Bobertson complied, writing to the Kesident;— a Under the circumstances, which admitted of no delay, and understanding that the Resident had invariably sanctioned compliance with a similar request, I venture to anticipate your instructions on this point, and advanced to His Highnets the sum asked for.' Colonel Prideaux replied :— u With reference to the remark contained in your letter under acknowledgment, to the effect that it was understood the Resident had invariably sanctioned compliance with His Highnesses request for an advance of the Mashat-Zanzibar subsidy, 1 have to observe that each application has been considered with careful reference to the circumstances under which it was made, and that the general rule has been to refrain from compliance until the pleasure of the Government of India has been ascertained.' 570. On 26th June, terms having been arranged, the sum of dollars 2,500 w 7 as paid by Sayyid Turki's Eepresentative to the A1 Wahiban Shaikhs, who then retired to El Sharkiyah. 571- Compensation to Indian traders plundered at Mattrah by the rebels under Shaikh Salih bin Ali and Sayyid Ibrahim bin Kais in June 1877 .—On 29th August 1877, Mr. Kobertson, in submitting a list of claims of Indian traders at Mattrah, for losses suffered at the hands of the rebels, under Shaikh Salih bin Ali and Syyid Ibrahim bin Kais, and through the operations of H M.S. Teaze?', wrote :— ' The operations of H.M.S. Teazer consisted in dislodging the rebels from some Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- Mdjugs in close proximity to Mattrah Fort, and in knock, ment of India, No. 224, dated 8th Sep- ln g down one building at the request of the minister, Sayyid tember 1877. Said, and the Governor of Mattrah, who were on board, 245 o11 ' A '' November :l8 ' 9 ' X:,S ' 191 ' and explained precisely what they wanted done. The build ing knocked down, whose contents were set on fire by a shell and entirely destroyed, turned out to be a warehouse in which some British subjects had placed merchandise, in the supposition that the fort's proximity would protect tlieir goods from plunder. \ have taken much pains with the assistance of four assessors to verify these claims but without any very satisfactory result. A few of the claimants are merchants, whose books show the extent of their losses, but the great majority are petty shopkeepers, who keep no accounts and whose claims rest on their assertions alone, u As regards the manner in which the claims should be dealt with, I would suggest that His Highness ^ayyid Turki, be called upon to pay one-fourth of the sum total, including the damage done by H.M S. and that three-fourths be levied from the plunderers. Were His Highness entirely absolved from contribution to the settlement, he would infer, despite anyt nag he might be told to the contrary, that the obligation to assure the safety of British S A w1 ^ kis dominions had in some measure been taken off his hands. To permit the Arabs, on the other hand, to retain their booty, and to oblige His Highness to pay for it, would e o encourage them in the strongest manner to repeat their offence. I think that the divi- reo-ard to botl^ W ^ have suggested will, if approved of, have a satisfactory effect inth, «' ^ imposition of an additional fine on the plunderers, became M.ff l fixiT • ^^ leazer ^ already represents one. The tribes who plundered attiah were the^ Haboo j Harth^ and Hijrieen. They all export produce via Maskat or Soor to a eonsiaerable extent, and its seizure at either port would be easy/-' 6/2. With reference to these proposals the Acting Resident, Maior Grant while concumag as to the advisability of maldng the tribes my for what thev had plundered, doubted whether Sayyid Turki's authority was sufficient to enable him to seize their produce as suggested, and inquired ; Wh , 0 . a r the P ^eliasers of the goods sent to Masbat and Soor for shipment, are they British subjects or subjects of 'Oman ? Under what colours are the goods shipped ? And supposing that some goods were seized for payment of part of the compensation, wonld you not be apprehensiye of fresh trouble being- caused by the disaffected tribes or that the trade of Masbat would suffer owing to the inland tribes tabing alarm and sending their produce to other ports tor shipment. Mr. Kohertson replied- Kesident, rorsian Gulf, to Govern ment of India, No. 237, dated 4th Oc tober 1877. Poll. A., November 1879, N ob . 191- 245. u T he produce broug-ht to Soor by the inland tribes for exportation does not, as a rule, change hands there, but is usually conveyed by the same persons who bring it in to the coast in bag-hlahs, hired from the Jenebeh and Beni Bu AH tribes, to Bombay, Aden, and Zanzibar for sale. do not anticipate that any evil consequences, political or commercial, would result from a seizure of merchandise belonging to the offending tribes. I rather think that nothing would tend so much to give to 'Oman the repose and feeling of security, from whose absence the country and its trade are suffering. The immunity which marauders from El Shark!yeh have invariably enjoyed of late years renders it easy for Shaikh Salih bin Ali and othei disturbers of the peace to get together a rabble to threaten Maskat whenever it suits their purpose. But were the tribes made to feel that they, and not the Sultan, would be held responsible for in jury to British subjects, who alone are worth plundering^ the part now flayed by Saliah bin Ali would become impossible. ' The action taken with the Yal Sa'ad, after the plundering of Mesna'ah in 1874, has given tianquillity to El Batinah, and 1 have no doubt that if a similar course be now taken with the Sharkiyeh tribes, the effect on that province will be the same. ' Soor is the only harbour on the coast of 'Oman to the south of Maskat, and the Rafsah pass leading to Soor, the only practicable route for laden animals from the interior of El Sharkiyeh to the coast. The Hijrieen and Harth tribes, whose position in El Sharkiyeh are southerly, have therefore no option but to prosecute their trade by way of Soor, while the Haboos!, whose district lies more to the north, frequent Mattrah for the same purpose. It is probable that at any time during the next four months, merchandise belonging to the Hajrieen and Harth of more than sufficient value to meet the entire claim for indemnity will be found at Soor, and an order from His Highness Sayyid Turki, to the Beni Bu AH and Jenebeh tribes, backed by the presence of one of H.M. ships, would, I have little doubt, cause it to be seized and delivered up by them, without direct action on our part. The presence of one of H.M. ships would, however, be necessary to- strengthen His Highnesses authority for the time being, and to show the tribes that he was acting with the approval and support of the British Government, ' I have had no conversation with His Highness Sayyid Turki regarding the Mattrah claims, but I understand that His Highness is most anxious that this opportunity of breaking the influence of Shaikh Salih bin Ali and the Muttowwa faction by showing the tribes that their guidance may lead to trouble, should not be lost.''

' The measures proposed by Mr. Robertson with regard to the seizure of the produce of the Hijrieen and Harth tribes, when brought to the sea-coast for exportation, would have been expedient under circumstances in which His Highness Sayyid Turki could have enforced them without the aid of Government, but as such aid or interference in the internal affairs of 'Oman has been repeatedly forbidden by Government, 1 would respectfully suggest that, as hitherto. His Highness must be held responsible for the indemnity for loss incurred by British subjects during the late attack on Mattrah. c&lt; In coming to this conclusion I have been guided by the results of past events, in which such interference has always led to continual disturbances on the mainland and reprisals on the property of British subjects/' ' 135136 574 On returning from furlough in December 1877, Colonel lloss reviewed the correspondence which had passed with reference to this subject, and sub- mitted his views to Government in the following . Memorandum. ' In June last an attack was made on Maskat by the El Harth, El Hijrieen and El Haboos tribes or Sharkiyeh under the leadership of Shaikh Sahh bin Ah and Ibrahim bin Kais. ' 2 The leaders wpre warned by Mr. Robertson by letter that they would be held re sponsible for all consequences ' 3 The attack was repelled by aid of the ^uns of II M.S. Icazer, but, as usual, con siderable loss of property occurred. The loss of British Indian traders is estimated at from about dollars 8,000 to'dollars 15,000, the latter estimate being recommended for adoption by the Officiating Political Agent and the Officiating Resident, Persian Gulf. ' 4. In forwarding the estimate of losses, Mr. Robertson recommends that His Highness the Sultan should be called on to pay one-fourth, and that three-fourths should be levied from the plunderers. Mr. Robertson does not state in this letter whether he means to advise the levy of the indemnity being effected directly by the British Government, or by His Highness the Sultan, but, from subsequent letters, I infer he would propose the seizure to be made by the Sultan, with the assistance of British naval force. ' 5. In his letter No. 284 of 18th July, Mr. Robertson reported that the Hinawi tribes expected the seizure of their goods by the British Government: and, on 13th September, he reports a deputation of the Hijrieen tribes coming to the Sultan about the exportation of their dates and other produce, which they feared might be seized on reaching the coast, in retaliation for the plunder of British subjects. Mr. Robertson advised His Highness to promise nothing, but inform them they must take the risk their conduct exposed them to, unless they, a-^eed to pay one-half the indemnity claimed by inhabitants of Mattrah. Mr. Robertson under stood Sayyid Turki had acted on this advice. ' 6. In transmitting Mr. Robertson's proposals to Government, the Officiating Resident expressed his doubts as to the Sultan's ability to seize the produce of tbe rebellious tribes, and suggested apprehensions of such a course causing fresh trouble and injuriously affecting the trade of Maskat, by the tribes sending their goods to other forts for shipment; and in a fur ther report Major Grant fears that Sayyid Turki is not strong enough to carry out so high handed a measure, and that its adoption might lead to a fresh coalition of the discontented tribes and renewed disturbances in 'Oman. i( 7. Mr. Robertson replied on 27th September, No. 367, that he anticipated no evil consequences, political or commercial, from the proposed seizures. He considered, on the contrary, nothing would so much t^nd to give a feeling of repose and security. Instancing the beneficial results of the action taken with the Yal Sa'ad tribe in 1874, Mr. Robertson recom mends a similar course being taken with the Sharkiyeh tribes. He considered that Sayyid Turki's order would suffice without direct action of the British Government, but the presence of a man-of-war would be necessary to show the tribes that His Highness was acting with the approval and support of the British Government. The Officiating Political Agent urges, as an additional argument, that he had warned Shaikh Salih that he would be held responsible. . • ,--3 j ' 8. Major Grant reported to Government his opinion that the measures proposed by Mr. Robertson would be expedient, if Sayyid Turki could enforce them without the aid of Gov ernment, but as such aid and interference in the internal affairs of 'Oman had been repeatedly forbidden by Government, suggested that, as hitherto, Sayyid Turki must be held respon sible for the indemnity. ' 9. Major Grant adds that, in coming to this conclusion he has been guided by the results of past events, in which such interference has always led to continual disturbances on the mainland and reprisals on the properly of British subjects. ' 10. Subsequently, Major Grant reports that it would appear that trade has already suffered and serious pulitical disturbances were likely to occur, owing to the tribes taking alarm at the prospect of interference of Government, which is not at all contemplated. '11. Reporting on 2ind November, Mr. Robertson states his belief of the future tran quillity or the reverse of 'Oman will depend on the decision of Government, as to whether the Sultan or the tribes who plundered Mattrah shall indemnify the Indian traders. Mr. Robert son thinks that if the Sultan has to pay, the tribes will consider the plunder of British traders an easy way of mulcting Sayyid Turki, but if they are forced to pay themselves, it will dis courage future expeditions against the coast towns. '12. With regard to Sayyid Turki's relations with Shaikh Salih bin Ali, I note the following points. In his letter. No. 323 of 16th August, Mr. Robertson reports having advis-ed Sayyid Turki steadily to refuse to hold any communieation with Shaikh Salih, until the atter had tendered his submission and ^iven guarantees for future good behaviour, and that Sayyid Turki concurred. This action of the Officiating- Political Agent was approved bv Government in letter No. 2311 P of 10th October. '13. In his letter No. 338 of 29th August, Mr. Robertson reports that Sayyid Turki had expressed his readiness to renew friendly relations with Salih, but refused to renew his subsidy or to employ him again as his agent. ' 14. Mr. Robertson forwarded translation of a letter from Shaikh Salih to a Shaikh of the Mesakerah, affirming that the British Government had forbidden Sayyid Turki to make .peace with him, Salih. 15. The proposals submitted for consideration of Government are then as follows : &lt;f Mr. Robertson recommends that a proportion of the amount of British traders' losses being fixed on the Sultan, the remainder should be exacted from the tribes by the Sultan, with support and, if necessary, aid of the British Government. Major Grant, dissenting from this view, holds that Sayyid Turki should be held responsible ; in other wonls, should pay the amount of the alleged losses himself. On considering the reasons given by Major Grant for rejection of Mr. Robertson's proposal, I so far agree that Sayyid Turki is incapable of enforc ing demands for indemnity without British support, but I do not see that in this case such support would be contrary to the declared policy of Government. The other arguments adduced by Major Grant against Mr. Robertsou's proposals do not appear to me appropriate, and 1 should anticipate very ill results from a policy based ou such considerations as appre hension of renewed coalitions and reprisals on British subjects. ' 16. The strong measures adopted already would have been as likely as anything else to exasperate the rebels, but it is precisely their fear of further strong measures that would restrain them from reprisals. If they once conceived the idea that our measures were framed from any fear of their proceedings, there would be little safety for our subjects and their property. My conclusions, too, from past experience are different from those arrived at by Major Grant. a 17. I do not think that any of the former occasions on which the Sultan was called on to pay indemnity to British traders plundered in his territories were precisely similar to this instance. In the Mattrah case, in 1874, His Highness, having pardoned the rebels, had taken the responsibility on himself. The other cases there was evidence of neglect on the part of His Highnesses officers. But allowing that His Highness is amenable for the whole losses, it seems doubtful whether it is advisable to cripple his resources heavily at present, and thus furnish additional inducement to his enemies, besides impunity and hope of gain, to renew their attack. '18. I am inclined to think that the reasons of a general nature adduced by Mr. Robert son for recommending that the tribes should be made to pay indemnity on this occasion are good and that the results would be as he anticipates. But there seems to me to be special grounds in favour of such a course. The Political Agent formally intimated to the leaders that they would be held responsible and a general expectation has been raised that such will be the case. A vigorous course, having been adopted so far, should, I think, be consistently pursued: else the tribes finding their fears of retribution groundless would be emboldened and would cease to attach weight to the warnings of Political Officers in future. ' 19. From the above considerations, and bearing in mind the advice already tendered to His Highness, Sayyid Turki, I am most respectfully of opinion that the most consistent and effectual policy would be to insist on the offending tribes making restitution and offering our naval assistance to the Sultan, should he require it, to enforce the measures. It would, however, in my opinion, be necessary to address the leaders of the tribes in question direct, reminding them of the warning already conveyed to them and making them aware of our demands and the intentions of Government regarding them. ' 20. Of course, if Sayyid Turki should decide to come to terms with his late assailants.

Government, before deciding whether coercive measures against the tribe should be resorted to or not, called for a full report of the case which Colonel Miles submitted as follows:— &lt;f In the month of June 1875 a godown belonging to the principal Indian trader at From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Soor, a banian named Jethanund Motamull, was broken into, Government of India, No. 214, dated during his absence on business at Maskat by a partv of the 22 pil S A P SX 6 i876 &gt;lf o,.U.27. f*' who offered violence to the watehman in charge and earned off plunder to the value of about dollars 1,600. Ihe spoil was openly sold in the town, and the robbers made no attempt at conceal ment of themselves, but no steps were taken by the Shaikhs of the tribe to cause restitution, and it does not appear that they even offered to remonstrate with, or repress, their tribesmen.' 'There was no Wali or other authority on behalf of the Sultan at Soor at the time, who could have taken action in the matter, and the banian, therefore, on returning to Soor shortly after the outrage and discovering his loss, reported the matter to me, and the case was re ferred to His Highness, who promised redress. 'Soon after this H.M.S. Rifleman happened to arrive at Soor, and the Shaikhs of the Jenebeh, apprehensive that her arrival was connected with the outrage committed by their tribesmen, and fearing the results, seized the offenders and would have, doubtless, caused restitution to be made to the trader, but H.M.S. Rifleman, which only dropped anchor for a few hours incidentally in passing, having in the meantime weighed and proceeded on her voyage, the Shaikhs perceived how matters stood and released their tribesmen without further question.n His Hi ^ I iugss Sayyid 1 urlvi s al^ssncG at ( 'iindtir last J6arj tH6 C&amp;S6 w&amp;s represented to Flis Highness Sayyid Abdul Aziz, but without auy beneficial result. About this time, however, the Shaikhs o£ the tribe went to the banian and offered an arrangement, promising to make good the loss in eight months. This arrangement they have since repudiated. ' His Highness Sayyid Turki has on different occasions been reminded of the matter since his return, but he has not been able to put sufficient pressure on the offending tribe to cause them to make good the lo.-s sustained at their hands, or to bring them to account for their misconduct, and they have since succeeded in procrastinating and delaying to reply to His Highness until the season opened, and they could get away in their bughlahs. 'It is evident that His Highness has no means of coercing tins tribe and enforcing his authority upon them : indeed, his power over the coast of his dominions is at present ex- tremelv slight, as he has lost the only vessel that once gave a semblance of it. His Highness has informed me that he now leaves the matter in the hands of Govern- ment. and, as 1 consider that the continued failure of the Jenebeh tribe to cause restitution to a British subject plundered by them is likely to be injurious to our interests, I trust you will support His llighness's request that the enforcement of reparation may be undertaken by Government. 'To hold His Highness personally responsible for the loss sustained at the Jenebeh's hands would, 1 respectfully submit, tend still further to weaken His Highnesses authority, and would encourage the predatory Arabs to continue their depredations on British subjects at His Highnesses expense; wdiile the exaction of reparation from this tribe would, on the other hand, be a salutary caution to all.'' 586. In forwarding this report to Government, Colonel Prideaux re marked :— ' Since the time when it was possible for Sayyid Turki to redeem his promise of exacting reparation, his difficulties have increased, and 1 am not now prepared to say that he could take effectual measures without our co-operation. There is also some force in Lieute nant-Colonel Miles' argument that, if the refractory tribes find they can plunder with impunity at the Sultan's expense, they will lose no opportunity of doing so. But. before moving actively in the matter, 1 would recommend that His Highness should be called upon to address the Jenebeh again, and to clearly intimate that, in the event of speedy satisfaction not being obtained, lie will be compelled to apply to the British Government for assistance in enforcing his demands. 1 would further recommend that if the Jenebeh do not, within a specified time, which I would fix at three months, accede to the demands of His Highness Sayyid Turki, effective steps should be taken to obtain redress; and that, in addition to the sum of dollars 3,600, which was plundered from the banian, a further sum of dollars 2,000 should be levied, partly as compensation for the delay which has occurred, and partly as a penalty for the offence committed against a British subject/' From GoveriiTnentof India, to Resi- i • ± t&gt; dent, Persian Gulf, No. 2568-1*, dated 587.

A., October 1877, Nos. 219-239. f&lt; I wrote to His Highness Sayyid Turki inforraino. him of the instructions I had received and requesting him to furnish me with a written order to the Jenebeh to pay me the suras I had been directed to recover from them. ' When I called on the Sultan before leaving-, it was proposed that the Minister, Savvid Said, should accompany me, as His Highnesses llepesentative and to act as a go -between,' to which I readily assented. ' On arriving at Soor on the 24th, I wrote to the Jenebeh enclosing His Highnesses order, and warning them that if they failed to comply with it within twenty-four hours, measures of a coercive nature would follow. ' The Jenebeh have no recognized head, their nominal Shaikh being a boy who is as yet without authority, Several of the leading men came on board the 2'eazer in reply to my letter. They expressed their readiness to comply with His Highnesses order, but explained that the absence of a recognized authority among them rendered it necessary for each member of the tribe to pay his share at once, as, were some to pay on behalf of the rest, their chance of re-imbursement after our departure would be small. On this ground, and on the ground that several of their principal men were inland fighting with the Beui Bu Hasan, they asked for an extension of time, and I allowed them until sunset on the 25th. ' Early next morning Sayyid Said went on shore. He returned at mid- day and reported that Jethanund's claim, amounting to dollars 1,600, had been satisfied, partly by a money pay ment, and partly by a bughlah, of which he had received possession. 'At sunset the Governor of Soor and Jethanund came on board. The former delivered to me dollars 2,000 and the latter stated that his claim against the Jenebeh had been fully satisfied.

Secretary of State for foreign affairs, reported ff A French schooner, the Clemence, Captain Mahe, recently arrived at this port from Reunion, with the supposed intention of taking in a cargo of produce and^Negroes for sale in that colony. &lt;f Mr. Consul Perry, of Reunion, to whom I am indebted for having given me early intimation regarding Captain Mahe's intentions, informed me that if the Negroes were ob tained, they would probably be shipped as passengers or entered in such a way that their po sition would be apparently regular. £f On receipt of Mr. Perry^s note I communicated the suspicious character of this vessel confidentially to His Highness Sayyid Turki, who took steps to prevent Negroes being taken on board of her under any pretence, and also sent injunctions to this effect to the chiefs, along the ^Oman coast. The Clemence sailed from this on the 18th instant, without having succeeded, as far as I know, in shipping any seedies. It is not the first time that the French have endeavoured to obtain Negroes here. Some 13 months ago Captain Finet, of the French barque Decidee, engaged eight men as coolies to work, under an engagement for five years at Reunion, by promises of liberal wages and treatment and he had already shipped them previous to sailing, when His Highness the Sultan, on hearing my suggestion as to the real nature of the treatment they would probably experience, refused his permission to their departure and caused them to be relanded.' 598.

The reasons for His Highness s suspicions about the fidelity of Sayyid Beder are unknown to me. ' I think His Highness Sayyid Turki will find some day that he has been somewhat hasty ^ gating rid ot one who has proved himself to be among his staunchest and most valuable adherents. _ I believe Sayyid Beder's disgrace is due solely to the, in this instance, pernicious advice and influence of the Minister, Sayyid Said, who has sought to gratify his own feelings ot enmity rather than advance His Highness Sayyid Turki's interests.' 604. Landing of a cargo of Abyssinian slaves near Maseerah; 143Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern ment of India, No. 90, dated 6th April 1877. the Political Agent's visit to the island.—On 2nd September 1876 Colonel Resident, Persian Gnif, to Govern- Miles reported the receipt of information that a ment of India, No. 203, dated 16th bughlah, having on board 80 Abyssinian slaves, had Se pdi.

At the Political Agent's request, H.M.S. Arab cruised for some days to intercept the slaver, but failed to do so. On 18th November Colonel Miles telegraphed «Cargo of Abyssinian slaves has been landed at Maseerah Island and about two-thirds . o have been sold.

An officer de puted by Sultan could accompany vessel, and a refusal on part of Shaikh to give up slaves or pay fine could be met by seizure and retention of his boats until submission. I believe this measure would have a more deterrent effect on the trade than the capture at sea of several slave dhows.' 605. Colonel Prideaux, in submitting to Government these views and sug gestions, wrote: — u As regards the chief of Maseerah Island, who permitted the slaves to be landed, I am of opinion that, if His Excellency in Council thinks it right to impose any punishment upon him he must be dealt with by us independently of the Sultan of Maskat. His Highness has no vessel at his disposal and cannot consequently enforce his authority on the island. If a man- of-war visited Maseerah and inflicted a heavy fine upon the chief it would, I believe, have an excellent effect/' On 30th March 1877, Colonel Miles further reported :— ' 'With the exception of a small portion of the cargo that belonged to a Persian, and was carried by him for sale to the Persian coast, the whole of the remainder has been distri buted and disposed of in 'Oman.' 607. The instructions issued to the Resident were as follows The Govenitent ^f India approves your suggestion that the island of Maseerah should be visited by a British ship-of-war and a fine be inflicted on the chief.

On arriving at the village of Um-Errasas, I landed with Captain Dicken, and found .j , » , m1 .^ hat the P overt y the place and its inhabitants had not been exaggerated at Maskat. The village consists of about sixty huts built of date branches but several of them are deserted The people live entirely by fishing, having neither cattle nor cultivation. Ihere is a small clump of date trees at the upper end of the Bay, but it belongs to the bhaikh of the Jenebeh, who lives on the mainland and rarely visits the island With this exception the island is entirely barren, as I saw from the top of a hill, which stands behind the village. ' ^ lie villagers spread a mat for us and I told them why we had come. They said that the bughiah had anchored at the entrance of the bay, but had landed no slaves on the island although slaves might have been sent in her boats to the mainland opposite. They swore that they had bought none of them, and pointed out, what indeed seemed obvious enough, that their collective wealth was insufficient to purchase a single Abyssinian. I questioned them at some lenyth to ascertain if their boats hud assisted in conveying the slaves to places on the coast, but it did not appear that they had done so. f&lt;r Judging by the destitute appearance of the people, it seemed to me that the smallest pecuniary penalty would prove irrecoverable, and neither the strength of the case against them nor my instructions, appeared to justify the infliction of punishment by destroyin 0 g boats or huts. I warned the islanders that if slaves were again landed in their neighbourhood, and they failed to give notice ot it, they should be held responsible and punished for the old and the new offence at the same time. They appeared to be impressed, and I trust that you will consider that 1 did what was best and all that was advisable under the circumstances/' 611.

Efforts were made by the principal Shaikhs of the Beni Bu Ali, and by Shaikh Hamid bin Said of the El Harth, to bring about an arrangement between the Sultan and Sayyid A bdul Aziz, through the Political Agent's mediation, and, on 20th December, Mr. Robertson wrote :— ' It would appear that Sayyid Abdul Aziz is quite ready to entertain proposals for an arrangement with his brother, and thankful for the efforts to From Resident, Persian Gulf, to w bicli are being made.

The negotiations on this, as on former occasions, failed owing to Sayyid Abdul Aziz's determination not to leave 'Oman, and on 3rd January 1878 the Acting Political Agent reported:— ' Sayyid Abdul Aziz, in a letter to Shaikh Hamid, states that he does not desire to reside in India, but will live and die in 'Oman, and he recom- iTited ™. end8 Shaikh Hamid to take no farther trouble in regard to 12th January 1878. him as ' Turkrs affair is easy and simple. J he meaning ot this last clause is not very clear, but it is probably meant to be a threat. His Highness informs me that he is not inclined to make an allowance to Sayyid Abdul Aziz on any condition other than his retirement from 'Oman, and means to let the matter drop for the present. 619. In the course of January Sayyid Abdul Aziz visited Shaikh Salih bin Ali at Kabil, but, their views differing, nothing came of the meeting, and Sayyid Abdul Aziz returned to the Beni Bu Hasan. 620.

' There seems little doubt that Abdul Aziz had reached Semed and is on his way down, but no mention is made of Salih being with him, and it is believed that he has not yet decided to join the enterprise in person, though its organization is of course due chiefly to him. 'His Highness Sayyid Turki was informed at once by Kossid of the change in the aspect of affairs and returned to Maskat on the 8th instant. On the morning of that day Sayyid Said visited me and requested, on behalf His Highness, that I would write at once to Sayyid Abdul Aziz and desire him to desist from hostilities, representing that it was the general belief that Sayyid Abdul Aziz was under the impression that he would not meet with the opposition of the British Government in his designs against his brother, and stating his conviction that my letter would have the effect of discouraging Abdul Aziz from further operations!, ' In view of the interests at stake, and in the absence of a man-of-war, I believed I should be acting in the spirit of the instructions of Government in supporting Sayyid Turki, and that it was advisable, under the circumstances, to comply with the requests, and I therefore wrote to Sayyid Abdul Aziz accordingly.' U7626. follows The Political Agent's letter to Sayyid Abdul Aziz was as ' I have been informed that Your Highness in El Sharkiyeh, who have risen in rebellion ag; ss has leagued with certain disaffected persons jainst His Highness ISayyid Turki, and that you are coming to Maskat with hostile intentions. ' I have heard this with regret, for I did not expect such things from Your Highness. 'It is not concealed from you how much the British (»overnment desire the peace, happiness, and prosperity of the people of Oman, and are displeased with those who shed blood wantonly and delight in plunder. ' I have therefore to inform Your Highness that your proceedings are viewed with dis pleasure, and I trust you will not risk the loss of our friendship and incur the anger of the British Government by persisting in the course. And if Your Highness reject my advice, on you rests the responsibility. Salaam, Sayyid Abdul Aziz replied :— ' In an auspicious hour your letter reached me, and what was expressed in it I have un derstood particularly your remark that I have risen against From Resident, Persian Gulf, to brother Turki with the intention of attacking Maskat 25tr™uTy e i878. ^ 152 ' an ^ ^at you have heard this with much regret j also your observations that the British Government desire that the people of 'Oman should have peace and dwell in prosperity, and that they are displeased with those who shed blood wantonly and delight in plunder. ' Be just, and please to inform me in what way my brother Turki has given prosperity, peace, justice, or tranquillity to the people of 'Oman during the time he has reigned. Surely they have not enjoyed them. He has even lost the power of ruling them, and has become neglectful of his subjects until the whole of 'Oman is full of rebellion, sedition, oppression, and disturbance, and the country is now without a ruling hand at all, and without justice and without tranquillity. The people are sheep without a shepherd. The great have no mercy on the small, and the strong show no justice to the weak. This is not according to law and right. It is not concealed from you what has happened between my brother Turki and myself from the beginning to the end, and you are aware that at one time I endeavoured to the best of my ability to improve the state of affairs, and remove troubles, and give security to the persons and prosperity to the people; but it was not possible for us to continue to act together, and he chose to associate with the seditious and misguided men. What happened happened, and I said nothing about it, and remained quiet in my house, and had patience for two years and a half, that perhaps he might change and behave better, and do justice between the people, and give tranquillity to the land and people, and remove discontents. I saw no efforts of his, however, in this direction, and no improvement, and you know what occurred, and your discrimination is sufficient. Then I saw that the whole country of 'Oman was collected to oppose my brother Turki and to advance upon Maskat, and they were not to be turned from it. They desired that I should join them, and if I had declined they would have applied to another to lead them. It would have been disadvantageous to my interests to have allowed this, and what happened last year was sufficient in this way. I therefore considered it advis able to join them, not seeing any other way to gain my ends. And regarding the subjects of the British Government there is no fear for them, and I request you will be good enough to cause them to ship themselves and all their property, and remain on the sea until everything is settled and quiet, and God is the best disposer of events. I trust the Government will observe neutrality between us, as it is their custom to be just, and my faith in you is complete. Salaam.'

His Highness has also endeavoured to intercept the trade with Rostak, and has prohibited the dates and other produce of that district being brought down to the coast. ' These aggressive measures are contrary to the useful policy of Sayyid Turki, and do not appear to me to be at all judicious or well-timed. Sayyid Ibrahim's rebellion last year would certainly justify any retaliatory operations against him on Sayyid Turki's part. But His Highnesses feeble tenure of power and inability to take the field in person do not make it prudent for him to initiate hostilities against his most powerful rival.' 632. On the 21st August, Colonel Miles further reported :— ' Sayyid Turki has returned to Maskat from Barkhan, having abandoned his expedition to El Hazm and dismissed the force he had collected for that From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government of India, No. 176, dated 29th August 1878. purpose.

He therefore paid up and dismissed the Beni Kasib and other Arabs to their homes.' 633. Position of affairs on 1st November 1878 .— 'No event or change of much political importance had occurred during the year anterior to this date. The collapse of Sayyid Abdul Aziz's emeute in July had shown that he was without influential adherents, and disposed of him as an aspirant to the Sultanate for a time. Shaikh Salih bin Ali had not regained the influence lost in 1877. Sayyid Ibrahim bin Kais was holding aloof from faction and intrigue in retire ment at Rostak.

On 30th January 1878 Colonel Miles reported :— Prom Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gov- . ' The Wa ? ir Sai ^ durin ^ a recent . conversation ernment of India, No. 82, dated 23rd W1 th me, mentioned that His Highness Sayyid Turki was February 1873. anxious to have an agent residing at Bandar Abbass, and Poli. a , June 18/9, Nos. 31-36. solicited my views and opinion on the subject.' ' Sayyid said that the position of His Highnesses subjects at Bandar Abbass, of whom there was a considerable number, engaged in trade and other occupations, was not altogether satisfactory, as the treatment received by them at the hands of the Persian authorities and the protection afforded them in their dealings with others were not such as His Highness con sidered tliey ought to be, and it was thought the establishing an agent at that port would be beneficial to the interests of all 'Oman subjects in Southern Persia.'' { ' I said that, i£ the Sultan desired it, I should be happy to communicate his wishes in the matter to you for the favour of your advice, and the Minister replied that His Highness would be much obliged by my doing so.' 638. Colonel Ross addressed Government on the subject as follows:— ' I understand that His Highness contemplates his proposed agent should have a recognized official status, as regards the Persian and other Governments, and it appears to me this is not without difficulties and objections. There is nothing in Sayyid Turki ; s relations with the British or any other Government to actually debar from direct diplomatic dealings with I ersia, but, as a matter of fact, the rulers of Maskat have of late chosen to entrust their interests in Persia to the British Government. As a State in intimate friendly relations with our Government, and unrepresented in Persia, it has been the practice for the Resident in the Persian Gulf to give good offices to Maskat subjects on the Persian Coast. It appears to me that, as the bultan would not be represented at the Court of Persia, his proposed 150151 agent at Bandar Abbas would necessarily have to rely on the support of the British local re- presen ative, an.i H.s Highness would not be iu a„y better position to protect the interests of bis subjects than now, I am of opinion that any subjects of Maskat, who mav reside or call a Bandar Ahbass, arc not exposed to any remarkable inconveniences, and are in fact as favourably treated as British subjects.

(2) His Highnesses desire to obtain a renewal of the lease by Persia to Maskat of the port of Bandar Abbass and its dependencies. ' With reference to the first point I am to say that Sayyid Turki may be informed that there is no objection on the part of the British Government to his sending an agent to Bandar Abbass in view to the protection of the interests of Maskat subjects at that port. The Governor General in Council observes, however, that when H.M's legation in Persia was endeavouring in December 1871 to arrange for the lease of Bandar Abbass to Maskat the Sadr Azim stated that if the ruler of Maskat chose to send an agent to that port,' he * Letter from W. T, Dickson, Esq., would not be officially recognized*. This declaration neces- to Her Majesty's Minister, Teheran, sarily precludes the Government of India from encoura^ino- dated ISth December 1871. His Highuess's project of deputing an agent, and, ind'eed', makes it dithcult to offer any advice upon the subject; and I am to desire that His HiMi ness Sayyid Turki may be informed accordingly, and that it maybe explained to him that the admission of a Maskat agent at Bandar Abbass must rest with the Persian Government. ' The matter of the Sultan's wish to obtain a renewal of the lease of Bandar Abbass does not call for any remarks at present from the Government of India/' 641. Sayyid Turki appears to have let both matters drop. 642. Payments of Zanzibar subsidy made monthly instead of quarterly.— In June 1879 Sayyid Turki addres- Go—^ t0 P olitical Agent a request that the Zan- 28th June 1879. zibar subsidy might be paid to him by monthlv r™m^?inmeUrf 9 £to 7 £?- 2 ' instead of quarterly instalments.

On 3rd June 1879, Colonel Miles wrote :— ' Sayyid Abdul Aziz bin Thowainee, who is said to have been causing trouble andmischief at Henjnm and otlier places in the Gulf lately, has From Pesident, Persian Gnlf, to Gov- been brought to Mask at from Burka, and has been confined eminent of India, No..205, dated Uth ^ t j ie g u jtan in Fort Merani.

Sayyid Abdul Aziz refused to go to Zanzibar, and on 17th October , . n r Maior Smith reported that the Sultan had sent him erilnK'nt^i ; iw\L,dated30th to Lingah, whence he proceeded to Bushire, and October 1879. petitioned the Resident to intercede with Sayyid Turki to grant him an increase of allowance or permission to reside at Maskat. 646. Savvid Turki, while expressing readiness to do whatever the Resident considered right, was obviously disinclined to comply with either request, and Colonel Ross did not think there was reason to press him. 647- Ill-feeling between Sayyid Turki's El Hasa and El Nejd „ p „ Troops : murder of the Hassawi Chief by a eminent of India, No. 3C3, dated 16th Nejdi-— On 9th October 1879 Major Smith reported October 1879. that an unfriendly feeling of some months' standing poii. a ., No\. 18/9, Nos. 2o5-26i. between the bodies of El Hasa and El Nejd men whom Sayyid Turki entertained for the defence of Maskat and Mattrah, had culminated' in the murder of the chief of the former, Abdurrahman El Ashkar, by one of the latter, under the following circumstances :— ' On Sunday morning the parties paraded at an early hour at the Sultan's palace for the purpose of being mustered. While this was in progress, it seems that the old recriminations between them recommenced. The body of the Hasawis, however, quitted the palace without any outbreak occurring, leaving behind them their chief with a small number of followers, as well as Mubarak Wallad Shubaika, a Nejdi leader with a much larger following. As Abdur rahman El Ashkar was on the point of leaving the palace, one of his attendants preceded him, and, on emerging into the street outside the gate, was at once cut down by the sword of a Nejdi, who had waited outside for that purpose. Abdurrahman, on heating the noise outside, hurried forward to see what was the matter, and while bending over the body of his wounded adherent he was fired at from behind and received several mortal wounds, from which he almost immediately expired.' 648. Major Smith thought it probable that a conflict between the Hasawis and Nejdis might occur at any moment in the streets of Maskat, and tele graphed to the Resident to request that a man of war might be directed to remain at Maskat until further advice. Colonel Rose requested the commander of Her Majesty's Ship ' Beacon ' to comply with Major Smith's requisitions, although himself of opinion that the Sultan would 44 be able to control his guards and deal with the difficulty.'

' (2) To exact the indemnity from the Sultan. (i5) To await a favourable and convenient opportunity for exacting retribution from the offending tribes or leaders/' 662. Major Smith recommended the first of these courses, urging, among other reasons, that— • . j • * * • ji i t „ „ 'the Sultan has never re-entered into friendly relations From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gov- ^ The pensions of the ringleaders formerly paid by Oecembor 1879 ,a * No ' 423 ' d ''* d 12lb His Highness have since the occurrence been withheld, and Poll.

On 21st December 1879 Colonel Ross telegaphed to the Acting Poli tical Agent to carry out the measures authorized, imposing dollars 7,500'on the tribes and dollars 1,500 on Shaikh Salih bin Ali, but at this juncture, and before any effect had been given to these instructions, Major Smith was trans ferred to Kandahar.

If the offenders do not pay up within the month, I would propose to increase the demands at the rate of, say, one per cent, for every mouth of further delay.' Notification. ' Under orders of the Government of India I have to notify to you as follows : ' You are aware that when you took part in the insurrection ag-ainst His Highness Sayyid Turki in June 1877, the Political Agent of the Government of India warned you, before your arival at Mattra and Maskat, of ill consequences which would follow if you persisted in your intention of attacking those places. He gave you distinct warning that you would be held responsible by the Government for losses or injuries to British subjects in consequence of your proceedings. ' Disregarding the warning, you persisted in attacking Mattrah and Maskat, and caused unjust and needless loss to British subjects. 'The Government of India, having had under consideration the circumstances.attending these losses, and the extent of them, have decided that the insurgent chiefs and tribes shall be held liable for the following shares :— ' Shaikh Sali bin Ali ' Hizrieen Tribe ' El Harth Tribe f&lt; El Harboos Tribe Dollars. 1,500 3,750 2,750 1,000 ' Accordinirly, His Highness Sayyid Turki has now been authorized to demand and receive these sums as reparation for the losses of British subjects, and you are hereby informed that His Highness in doing so acts with the full consent anxl support of the British Govern ment. You will, therefore, act wisely by immediately arranging 1 for payment of the sura for which you are hebi responsible, and arrangements will be made for the safe conduct of your messengers coming to the coast to make the payment. ' If paid within one month from receipt of this notice, the sum indicated will be accepted as full reparation, and a paper will be given acquitting you from further liability. But if not paid within one month, you will be held liable in such further increased amount as may be decided by Government.' ' (Sd.) E. C. ROSS, Lt. Colonel, Political Resident, Sfc.' In reply Government telegraphed— ' Issue of notification approved. It is understood that reasonable excuse for delay in payment will be admitted, and that no active measures to enforce payment are now contem plated until September.' 155 From Government of India to Resi- dent, Persian Gulf, Nos. 355-E. P., dated 23rd January 1880. Poll. A., February 1880, Nos. 212- 233.From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Go- 66G. Colonel Ross instructed Dr. Brereton, the Sfa^ris's'I Iudia ' No 6{ ' dafced 12tb Acting Political Agent, to issue the notification, poll. a.. may 1880, Nos, 168-185. arranging with the Sultan for the despatch of letters of similar purport by him. 667. The replies of Shaikh Salih bin Ali and the tribes to the Sultan and Political Agent were inefficiently translated by the Maskat office, and their purport misunderstood by Dr. Brereton. Colonel Ross, in sending amended translations of them to Major Grant, who succeeded Dr. Brereton, summed them up as follows :— ' Shaikh Salih requests His Highness to appoint a person to confer with him, and, I observe, states that he had personally paid sums to indemnify losers. Hoosain bin Muhammad of the el Harth states that the el Burwani Section of that tribe were not implicated in the insurrection of 1877. Hilal bin Sayd and Beder bin Muhammad qf the el Hijrieen assert that their proceeding ' s were condoned , and a friendly settlement eflected with the Sultan . The Haboos is the only tribe which has replied direct to the Officiating Political Agent, to whom they state their readiness to comply with the demands of the Sultan . ' It was understood that no reconciliation had taken place since the insurrection between His h ighness and any of the chiefs and tribes concerned in it.' Major Grant replied— ' With regard to the statements of Hilal bin Sayd Hijree and DeVer bin Muhammed Hijree, • r, m n ■ that their conduct had been condoned by His Highness From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Go- -j m i • j r • ji i. t i i. • i i i verument of India, No. 88, dated 8th Sayyid Turki , and a friendly settlement arrived at between April 1880. them and him, His Highness admitted that these two Shaikhs Poll.

' In my opinion the simple fact that Sayyid Turki has had friendly intercourse with, From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Go- aild has .reived friendly visits from, the two Hijree Shaikhs, vernment of India, No. 100, dated 6th is sufficient to justify these Shaikhs in considering that their May 1880. former rebellious acts have been condoned by His Highness, Poll. A., July 18S0, Nos. 104-108. an( j j am certain that such is the general opinion of the place.' 668. Colonel Ross concurred in the view expressed by Major Grant. The decision of Government was as follows :— From Government of India, to Resi- ' As notification has been issued and acknowledged dent, Persian Gulf, No. 2208 -E. P., by the tribes , His Excellency in Council is of opinion that it dated 6th July 1880. must now be followed up by the proceeding necessary to give Poll. A., July 1880, Nos. 104-108. effect to it . ' It will therefore be necessary to signify to His Highness the Sultan that, for the reasons above stated , the alternative lies between His Highness taking such steps, with our support, as may be necessary and expedient for obtaining payment , or undertaking the payment himself. It is understood that , in the event of the first course being adopted, the active support which will be required from Government will not be more than that of the presence of a vessel of war at Soor at the time of making the demand ; and it appears to His Excellency in Council thit with this aid and with the advice of the Political Agency , His Highness should without difficulty be able to arrange for the recovery of the money , by instalments if necessary, from the tribes. Should the Sultan, however , elect for the second course , it will probably be the arrangement to recover the money from him by instalments from the Zanzibar subsidy.' 669. Major Grant, having been directed to ascertain the Sultan's intentions, thus described them :— ' Everything is to be kept quiet until about the first week in September, then, as soon as From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Go- His Highnesses emissaries report that the produce of the tribes vernment of India, No. 182, dated has arrived in considerable Quantities at Soor and Mattrah, 2 'p h «u se r:S™i? 1 0 Bs 1 , N „, 1 o5.n 9 . ^ s ir' e —, by - one will proceed to the former place, and seize a sufficient quantity or produce to cover the amount of the indemnity to be paid by the Hijrieen, whilst His Highness will attach the produce of the other tribes lying at Mattrah. Highness could suggest no plan by which the amount of the fine to be exacted trom Sa 11 )m Aii coui l be recovered, as he does not export produce from any port in ^Oman, and has no property near the coast which could be attached.' 156157 , . pursuance of the above plan the Sultan despatched Sayvid Beder bm qaii on the 16th September, in his yacht the Dar Es Scdaam, to Soor, to seize produce of the Hijrieen tribe which it was reported had arrived at that place Major Grant also proceeded thither in H.M.S. Woodlarh. r lhe information on which the Sultan had acted proved to have been incorrect. They found no produce belonging to the Hijrieen at Soor, and learned that trade communica tion with the interior had been interrupted for some time by intertribal hostili ties. 671. Subsequent negotiations between the Sultan and the tribes resulted in an arrangement that all El Sharkiyeh dates brought to Mattrah and Soor for exportation should pay a special tax of one dollar per bahar until such time as the sum so raised liquidated the indemnity claim. 672. Government consented to the gradual recovery of the indemnitv from ^he tribes in the manner proposed. 673. Position of affairs on 1st January 1880.— The year 1879 was uneventful in 'Oman. The general position of affairs underwent no change. 674. Sayyid Tarki's project of purchasing Thumb Island from Prom Resident, Per.um Gulf, to tlle Deputy Governor of Lingah-—On 21st Ja- Government of India, No. 23, dated nuary lb80 Dr. Brercton, Acting Political A'^ent 9 poii J A.^Feby ^isso, Nos. 340-342. ^ported that Sayyid Turki had opened negotia tions with Shaikh Yusuf, Deputy Governor of Lin gah, for the purchase of Thumb Island, near that place, and desired to know whether the Deputy Governor had power to dispose of the island without the Shah's sanction. Colonel Ross replied that Shaikh Yusuf would have no power or right to dispose of the island without the sanction of the Government of Persia, which it was wholly improbable would be granted. 675. Eemittance of $3,0341 by the Sultan of Zanzibar to the From Resident, Persian Gulf, to Go- Political AgGllt, Maskat, for Sajjid Abdul vernment of India, No. 128, dated isth xi.Z1Z .—In iVLay 18bO, the Sultan of Zanzibar re- 'pon. 8 ^'July 1880, Nos. 86-87. uiitted, through the Political Agent there, $3,064^ to the i olitical Agent, Maskat, for delivery to Sayyid Abdul Aziz, as his share of estates of deceased brothers. Sayyid Turki requested Major Grant not to pay the entire sum to Sayyid Abdul Aziz at once, but to allow him $100 monthly until the date season/ when the balance remaining might be handed to him. Government authorized the adoption of this course, June 1880. considering that—• money should not be paid to Abdul Aziz in 'Oman by Political Agent without concurrence of Turki.' 676. Sayyid Abdul Aziz declined to receive the money by instalatsnts. From Government ofindia, to Resi.

In October, Sayyid Turki still objecting to the money being paid to his brother in one sum, Sayyid Abdul Aziz addressed to Colonel Ross a re quest that he might receive instalments of $200 instead of $100 monthly, Sayyid Turki consenting, arrears for five months at this rate when paid by the Political Agent to Sayyid Abdul Aziz, and the balance by monthly instalments of $200.678. Payment for gunpowder supplied to Sayyid Turki from „ . f fTn(1 . fr Ppa!- the Bombay Arsenal in 18/4.—On 2adFebiu, dent, 0 ™ersian ^uif^No. 960, 1 dated 24th ary 1874.', Colonel Boss telegraphed to Government- April 1874. f or favourable consideration, a request of Sayyid Turki that 100 barrels of gunpowder might be supplied to him, on payment. On 2nd March the Bombay Government reported to the Government of India that orders had been issued to the grand arsenal for the supply, on payment, of the gunpowder in question. No demand for payment appears to have been made until March 1880, when the Comptroller General wrote to the Political Agent, Maskat, intimating that a sum of Ks. 10,098-10-0 was still due for gun powder supplied by the Commissary of Ordrance, 13ombay, to the feultan of Maskat in 1874.

In reply to a request for instructions, Colonel Ross wrote to Major Grant:— ' The matter referred for my advice seems to rne a delicate one, and I think any reply to Prom Resident, Persian Gulf, to Sayyid Said's question should be very guarded. Any promise Govemmeut of India, No. 127, dated ot protection made to the Wazir might bring' about an 14th June 1880. estrangement, besides being otherwise objectionable. I think Poll, A., July 1880, ISos. 161-164. the best course would be to inform the Wazir that, whilst entertaining friendly feelings towards him and being sensible of the satisfactory manner m which he has hitherto conducted business relating to the Agency, it is impossible to reply to hi8 question or to solicit orders of Government on a problematical contingency, which it may be hoped will never arise. I do not consider you could say more without appearing to withdraw confidence from the Sultan.' From Government of India, to Resi- i • xi • • dent, Persian Gnif, No. 2368-E. p., 682.

Renewal of differences between the Arabs of Eas-ul -Had and Soor regarding the use of Khor Jeramah and Khor Hijarah inlets —In December 1880, Colonel Miles reported that fresh* difficulties had arisen regarding the free use of Klior Jeramah and Khor Hijarah by native trading vessels, the Shaikh of the Malikh tribe of Eas-ul-Had having exacted a toll of $10 from each of three Bughlahs which had taken refuge in one of them. Sayyid Turki despatched his Wazir Sayyid said in the yacht Dar-es-Salaam to Soor and Ras-ul-Had to effect an arrangement which should put a stop to similar molestations of trading craft by the Malikhi. HM.S. ' Woodiark' also, at the Sultan's request, proceeded thither to afford the Wazir the support of her presence. Colonel Miles reported the result as follows:— ' His Highness informs me that the efforts of Sayyid Said have definitely put an end to the dispute, the basis of his avran&lt;^emenc being that all tolls on trading vessels entering Khor Jeramah and Hijarah shall be abolished and considered illegal in future ; the Nakhodas of native craft using them, however, being bound to pay the Arabs (or any assistance rendered, and bein^ recommended to g^ive the Shaikh a small present of rice or dates occa sionally for his good-will and protection.'

Position of affairs on Isfc January 1881 —At this date Oman had enjoyed two years of unusual quiet. Since Sayyid Abdul Azeez's rising in July 1878, there had been no attempt to dispossess Sayyid Turki of the Sultanate. He had, in the meanwhile, strengthened his position by. appointing his sons Faisal and Tahad, Governors of Nezwa and Barkah respectively, and the gift of a small steam yacht, the Dar-Es* Salaam, by his brother Sayyid Barghash of Zanzibar, enabled him to exercise some authority over the coast towns. The following is a sketch of the Sultan's position written by Colonel Miles in March 1881:— His Highness Sayyid Turki's power is as much consolidated now as it is ever likely , * o ii. i. /•. no ^ now i n exclusive alliance either with the ment 0/1^^0.55, dated SthTpTil ^hafirees or with the Hinawis, but endeavours to maintain 1881. terms with both. His sons are growing up to support him, and, though still young, are entrusted with the Governorship of the three most important towns in Oman—Sohar, Nezwa, and Barkah. His supremacy is everywhere unquestioned, for the only two rivals likely to raise their heads against him, viz., his brother Sayyid Abdul Azeez and his cousin Sayid Ibrahim-bin-kais are, though practically independent in their own districts, both entirely without resources, and are not at present regarded as the leaders of any recognized party. On the other hand, it must be said that his Highnesses rule continues to be, as it ever has been, merely nominal over the interior parts of Oman ; that he exercises little or no control over the people, and receives from them no taxes beyond what they choose to pay him.' 688. Maskat and Dhofar: disturbance at Dhofar and despatch of an expedition Irom Maskat to restore order.— In June 1876, Colonel Miles Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- ^ported the assumption _ by Sayyid Eadhl bin- ment of India, No. 661-137, dated Allowie, the Moplah Priest implicated in the murder IwretfiLptember 1876, Noa. 1 to 5. ? f , t . he . „ of 4! Ca ' CUt and ^Patnated f rom India m 1858, of the Government of Dhofar, on the south coast of Arabia, in the name of the Porte. At that time Sayyid Turki, claiming Dhofar as a dependency of Maskat, solicited, through the Political Agent, the intervention of Government to enable him to recover possession of it. The Maskat claim to sovereignty over Dhofar was thus stated by Colonel Miles:— ' In 1829, after the murder of the old pirate Sayyid Muhammad Akil-El-Ajeibi, Dhofar was occupied by a foi'ce despatched from Maskat by His Highness Sayyid Said, and the Govern- norship was offered by His Highness to Sayyid Muhammad's brother Abdur Rahman, a mer chant in Bombay, who, however, declined the post. The Sultan's troops were shortly after withdrawn for service in East Africa, and the district has since been uninterfered with, I believe, by Maskat, though the Chief Shaikhs are said to have visited Maskat on each accession of a new ruler to tender their submission, and they have, in fact, appeared here within the last five years to offer allegiance to His Highness Sayyid Turki.' 689.

The position of the Maskat Governors of Dhofar was from the first Resident Persian Gulf to Govern precarious, a majority of the factions into which the ment of India, No. 260,'dated 3ist inhabitants'were divided being generally against December 1880 them. In December 1880, Shaikh Awadh-bin- ecret, arc 1881, os. 353 to 364. Abdullah, who had led the revolt against SayyidPadlii and headed the deputation which invited Sayyid Turki to extend his rule over Dhofar, seized and imprisoned the Acting Governor, after a fio^t in which three of the Maskat garrison were killed. On news of this event reach ing Maskat y Sayyid Turki sent to Dhofar by sea a force of 180 men under four of his most trusted officers, with instructions thus reported by Colonel Miles « They are to act in accordance with the general will of the inhabitants. Should the Resident, Pmian Gulf, to Govern- people desire to have their former Governor, Salaiman-bin- metit of India, No. 5,dated 14th Janu- Sowailim, he is to be reinstated. Otherwise Sayyid Kbamis- ary l«81. bin-Sulaiman is to be the new Wali. The use of force exppnf Secret, March 1881, Nos. 353 to 364. against Shaikh Awadth and his adherents, has been prohibited as, should it appear that the general voice of the people is against the continuance of Sayyid Turki 's rule, the expedition is to return at once bringing back the old garrison, and Dliofar is to be abandoned/' . . t &gt; • Before this expedition reached Dhofar thp Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- ^ j x oi i i ^ me xnent of India, No. 24, dated 19th IRCtlOnS OppOSfiu. tO oilcllKll AWtl(lt]l had UDitGd witl} February 1881. the Maskat garrison, recaptured the fort and Secret, March, 1881, Nos. 3o to. 64. i ns t a t e {l the Acting Governor.

Disturbed condition of interior of Oman.-—In July 1881, the Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- ^'jtif^Agent telegraphed that Oman was general- ment of India, No. 153, dated 2ist ly disturbed, by intertribal wars, and that a battle i u lrl 88 l* xr oo« + qqq had occurred between the Beni-Bu-Ali and Beni- o j.. ., ugus , os. o .. Bu-Hassan tribes of Jaalan. resulting in 157 killed on both sides. The disturbances were occasioned by local feuds, and did not affect the Sultan's position or his relations with the tribes. 694. Reported Negociation between Sayyid Turki and Sayyid Barghash of Zanzibar for the former's abdication in favour of the latter- —Dr. Kirk, Agent and Consul General at Zanzibar, reported, in a Government of India, to Resident, despatch to the Goremment of India, Persian Gulf, No. 1348 E., dated 12th dated 8th March 1880, that he had learned that Apni 1880. Sayyid Turki, conscious of his inability to govern Secret, June 1880, Nos. ISO to 190. x i i j _ i n j 0 so turbulent a people as that of Oman, was anxious to abdicate, and had been in communication with his brother Sayyid Barghash of Zanzibar on the subject. Dr. Kirk had seen an autograph letter of Sayyid Turki, wherein he stated that he was willing to make Maskat over to any one who would secure him the means to retire to a foreign country; and he understood that the brothers contemplated a meeting to discuss the matter either at Maskat or Zanzibar. 695.

Orders of Government as to the Political Agent's course, should Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- the Sultan die suddenly and the succession be A e rii il8i India ' Na 66, dated 8tb In a report on the situation at Maskat, Poll! A., June 1881, Nos. 450 to 452. ^ ate d the 26tli March 1881, Colonel Miles requested, v i ew Sayyid Turki's precarious health, in structions as to his proper course, should the Sultan die suddenly, and the suc cession be disputed. The instructions then issued to the Resident were as fol lows :— ' It appears from the report enclosed in your letter that Sayyid Turkic power may Government of India, to Resident, for the present be regarded as firmly established, and that Persian Gulf, No. 1354 E.P., dated25th during his lifetime there is little likelihood of anv serious Poll 6 A^June 1881, Nos. 450 to 452. disturbance in Oman. But, on the other hand, his health 19 in a preeanous state; and the Political Agent anticipates that his death will certainly throw the whole country into anarchy and disorder. Under these circumstances, Colonel Miles asks for instructions as to the line of policy to be adopted with regard to the question of succession, and he inquires whether an asylum is to be afforded to Sayyid Turki's sons, if they should determine to avoid a contest and seek the protection of British Government. In forwarding the Political Agent's letter you assume that the Govern ment of India would, in the event of a disputed succession, adopt a policy of non-interference, so far as might be compatible with the protection of British interests; but you express an opinion that Sayyid Abdul Azeez would be the most desirable successor. With regard to Sayyid Turki's sons you remark that it would be most in accordance with custom and humanity to give all reasonable attention to such an appeal as Colonel Miles contemplates. ' In regard to this last point your views are accepted by the Government of India. If under the eventualities stated, Sayyid Turki's sons should ask for British protection, it may be afforded them, so far as may be necessary for their shelter from immediate personal danger: though upon questions such as in what manner or for what period protection can be given, the British representative must of course be guided by the circumstances of the time. ' With reference to the main question at issue, I am to say that it is not the intention of Government to interfere actively with the course of a possible dynastic struggle in Oman, unless interference should become necessary to prevent the reunion of M askat and Zanzibar. Putting aside Sayyid Barghash or whoever might then be the ruler of Zanzibar, the (Government of India would view with satisfaction the succession in Oman of one of the descendants of Sayyid Said, provided that he were capable of preserving internal order, conducting the government of the State^ and upholding existing relations between Maskat and the British Government, tf It is impossible to anticipate all contingencies, but your general instructions are that the succession must be settled by the chiefs and people of the country; and that the first, if not the only duty of the Political Officer in the event of a contest, would be to secure for British subjects at Maskat and elsewhere on the Oman coast adequate protection agaiust injuries to person or property/' 697. Proceedings in the Maskat Slave Court.— During the year 1881, Resident, Persian Gulf, to Gov- three native vessels suspected of slave-trading were emment of India, No. 120, dated brought before the Maskat Consular Court, all by H. M. S. Dryad. Of these, one, the Samhah, bound from Zanzibar to Oman, was condemned, five slaves obviously intended for sale being found on board her. The others were ac quitted. 163 2l8t June 1881.

Jurisdiction of the Maskat Consnlar Court as a Court of Ad- wiiraltv —With reference to the condemnation by the Maskat Consular Court ^ ^ , p f of certain slaves seized by H. M. Rifleman on PeSir^No i475-Ip?daTed board the British Steamer Bokeby at Bushire in 12th July 1881. 1877, the following opinion as to the jurisdiction Poll. A., July J881, Nos. 7o to 7 . p 0ssesse ^ that Court, as a Court of Admiralty, was given by the law officers of the Crown in a letter to Earl Granville, dated 15th January 1881:— 'The question raised by the Indian Government whether the Consular Court at Maskat has jurisdiction as a Court of Admiralty to condemn vessels of slaves when brought within its jurisdiction, without regard to the place where they are captured, or whether the jurisdiction of the Court is limited to vessels and slaves suspected of being used and detained for the pur- pose of the slave trade within the dominions of Maskat is one of considerable «iifficulty. It it rested only on the construction of the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act, 1873, we think it would be held that the Consul at Maskat was entitled to exercise only the more limited juris diction. We think the definition of East African Courts contained in that Act, when read with section S. limited the jurisdiction of the Consul to cases when he was acting within the powers conferred upon him by Order in Council# ' But an Act has since been passed, the Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act, 1879, to which the attention of the Government of India does not appear to have been called, which materially alters the Act of 1873. By the late Act a new definition is substituted for the term 'East African Court/ And when this new definition is read with section 3 of the Act of 1873, we think, though the point is not free from doubt, that the jurisdiction of the Consul is no longer limited as it was before.' 699. Murder of a British Indian Trader at Mattrah.—On 29th n , November 1881, Major Grant reported that a Resident, Persian Gull, to txov- , i m • nr n i i i i j eminent of India, No. 240, dated 9t.h baman trader, named lejoo Walloo, had been shot December 1881. j n the bazaar at Mattrah on the 25tb, at about 7 Poll. A., Jan. 1882, Nos. 410 to 421. mi m the evening, by some person unknown. The Political Agent's opinion and the general impression at Maskat were that the crime had been committed by one of Sayyid Turki's Wahhabi mercenaries, but no evidence to inculpate any of them was obtained. Suspicion pointed Resident, Persiau Gulf, to Gor- to a Wahhabi soldier named Sa'ad Daiyinee who ernmeut of India, No. 247, dated left Mattrah for Bahrain m a native boat some 23 ™ iP e A Cen i ber Siv ,&lt;01 davs after the murder,♦ but the evidence of the Poll. A., Jan. 1882, Wos. 410 to 421. X t % i j r. , i. x i i t &gt; A Nakhoda of the boat, taken by the Residency Agent at Bahrain, showed that Sa'ad could not well have been the culprit. The Wahhabi garrison of Mattrah assumed a defiant attitude towards the Sultan, and caused Sa'ad's brother, who had been arrested on suspicion, to be released. At Major Grant's instance Colonel Ross requested H. M. S. Dryad to proceed to Maskat to allay the alarm felt by the British Indian commu nity. 700. A petition signed by most of the Hindoo and Khojah residents at Rerident, Persian Golf, to Gov- Maskat and Mattrah, praying that Sayyid Turki emment of India, No. 24, dated might be advised to dismiss bis Wahhabi merce- 20 ?on.T, a Maj 8 ?L,No».40to47. naries was addressed to the Political Agent, and forwarded by him to the Resident for favourable consideratipn. Colonel Ross replied that it had not been shown that the dis missal of the guard was necessary for the security of British subjects, and that— ' even if firmly convinced that the measure would be for His Highness's best interests, I would not consider it expedient to advise the Sultan on a matter of administration of this sort, as it would incur for Government a responsibilitv which is not in accordance with the policy towards the Maskat State. Some years back His Highness of his own accord got ri'l c£ Ins ahhabis, and made other arrangements, and, althong-h, the Political Agent Ihought it dan gerous, it was considered right to avoid offering advice. Subsequently His Highness became convinced that Maskat was insecure without a mercenary guard and re-enlisted the I^ejdians.165 701.

Colonel Hoss, m submitting the question to Gov ernment, observed that he was not prepared to recommend that Sayyid Turki should be required to make the amount good, and saw no other way of recover ing it. 702.

Intertribal disputes and occurrences in the interior of Oman in 1881 .—Intertribal disputes and occurrences in the interior during 1881 are thus noted in the administration reports of the Maskat Agency:— ' In January the Beni Kelban and other Ghafiree tribes who, at the instigation of Shaikh Barghash, were still besieging the fort of Bu Eineni, made an attack on the Baluch garrison and retired with seven killed. The date groves and aqueducts of Eineni have all been de stroyed by the besiegers. ' In the following month a collision occurred between the Beni Bu AH and the Beni Bu Hasan, in which the former were defeated with a loss of 22 killed, the latter losing about 20. On the news reaching Maskat H. H. Sayyid Turki despatched an officer to mediate between them. ' In April there was a struggle in Jaalan between the two powerful tribes Beni Ba Ali and Beni Bu Hasan, in which the former were defeated, owing to their being greatly out numbered and taken by surprise. They lost 20 men and the Beni Bu Hasan 17. ' In May the Baluch garrison of El Eineen, finding that they could not hold the fort against the Beni Ghafir who had besieged it, offered to fjive it up to the Beni Ali of Yinkal belonging to the Hinawi faction, and the offer was gladly accepted. The Beni Ghafir upon this formed an alliance with various Ghafiree tribes in order to oppose the Beni Ali and pre vent the retention of the fort by the Hinawis. The struggle for possession of the fort at last terminated about the end of June by the garrison making a vigorous and successful sortie against the besiegers, who, being beaten and dispersed, finally abandoned the siege and re turned to their homes. Fifty-two men were killed in this action. 'About this time (June) the Ibryieen and Beni Ryam disputed for the possession of the fort El Awabi. The matter was finally settled by the fort being handed over to H. H. Sayyid Turki, who assumed nominal possession of it, though it is still garrisoned by the Ibriyeen. ' A two months , truce between the Beni Bu Ali and Beni Bu Hasan having expired, the former, having given the stipulated five days' notice, attacked the latter at Jawabi El Knoweyseh. The loss of life in this action was heavy, the Beni Bu Ali losing 60 men and the Beui Bu Hasan 75. It appears that the Beni Bu Ali were aided by the Jenebeh, Beni Kasid, and Hishm tribes, whilst the Beni Bu Hasum fought alone. 'At the commencement of July an increased tax or octroi of five per cent, was established by H. H. Sayyid Turki on all produce arriving from the interior. The former tax on the various articles of produce varied from about 1J to 2J per cent, and was included in the general lease granted to the farmer of customs. The increased tax was purchased for the year for |15,000. 'In July Shaikh Sulaiman Bin Said was murdered at Seheleh by the Beni Said, and a few days after a servant of His Highness was killed by a party of the Beni Naeem; the object of both these murders was political, as both the tribes were on bad terms with His Highness and were threatening to attack Sohar: but on the arrival of His Highness' yacht Dar-Es-Salaam at that fort with stores and ammunitions for the garrison they abandoned their design. ' From July to September disquieting rumours prevailed regarding a coalition of the tribes under Shaikh Saleh Bin Ali against Maskat, but owing to disagreements amongst the leaders it all fell through.166 ' On 24th October news arrived that the fort of Nakhl had been taken by the El Zarib li H. H. Savyid Turki left for Barkah immediately with the intention of collecting- a force t* recapture it; but ou his arrival he found that through the mediation of MuhammadV 0 Zanani, Shaikh of the Beni Had ram tribe, the enemy had withdrawn on receiving His Highness paid this sum, and after making presents to the head-men of Nakhl returned t' Maskat un 1st November.' 704 —Position of affairs on 1st January 1882.— No event affecting the general situation in Oman occurred in 1881. At the beginnino 1 of 188^ Sayyid Turki exercised authority, directly or through Walis nominated bv him., over the following towns and fortresses : Maskat, Mattrah, Shinas, Sohar Sowaik, Masnaah, Barkah, Seeb, Kuryat, Soor, Dhofar, Semail, Nakhl, and the dependency of Gwadur on the Mekran coast. Elsewhere throughout Oman except in the districts of El Rostak and El Semed, which were held by Savyid Ibrahim Bin Kais and Sayyid Abdul Azeez, respectively, his suzerainty was generally acknowledged and his mediation to arrange intertribal disputes aceept- ed; but he obtained revenue from Maskat and Mattrah only, and was obliged to pay subsidies to various Shaikhs of tribes for their support or quiescence The Walis of his Inland forts not infrequently refused to give up possession when called upon by him to do so, and had to be ejected by intrigue or bribed to resign. c , of S ayi id Abdul Azeez, Sayyid Ibrahim Bin Kais.

It was stated that the Ilijriyeen tribe were willing to join the movement, and that the Beni Bu Ali and El Mesakireh, usually staunch supporters of Savyid Turki had determined to remain neutral, being offended at the manner in which the Sultan had recently treated a Shaikh of the former tribe. Among the tribes, generally, much discontent had been caused by the recent imposition Precis, paragraph 703. b ' V Sa JT id Turki of an octroi duty of five per cent. , / on all produce entering Maskat and Mattrah from the interior, whether for local consumption or for shipment, and no inclination to support the Sultan, or oppose the coalition was manifested. 706.

On occupying the fort Sayyid Ibrahim Bin Kais assembled the Turlkn tradeis in the town, and told them they were under his protection and had nothing to fear. No plundering occurred, and next day business proceeded in the bazaar as usual. Sayyid Ibrahim wrote to the Political Agent, informing him of the capture of El Masnaah, and of his intention to protect British sub- jeets and property. 712.

Major Grant's written reports, dated 26th June and 3rd July, con- Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- tained the following details : On 21st June rumours ment of India, No. 144, dated 4th were current at Maskat that Sayvid Abdul Azeez Poll ring. 1882, Nos, 254-275. ^ ^ ^f? 0 ^ H ^Ood El Jahafi had, with a torce ot Bedouin robbers, got through the pass of El Akk, leading from El Sharkiyeh to Maskat, to hold which the Nadabiyeen and Rahbiyeen tribes were subsidised by Sayyid Tarki. On the 22nd the Minister, Sayyid Saeed, informed Major Grant that Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Hamood had arrived at El Wuteyyah, three miles from Mattrah, and requested him to write to Sayyid Abdul Azeez, and remind him that an attack upon Mattrah would be contrary to the already expressed wishes of the British Government. Major Grant did so, and Sayyid Abdul Azeez at once replied that his intention was to attack Mattrah and Maskat, and he requested that British subjects mightbe warned to place themselves and their property in safety. Major Grant issued a notice to British subjects accordingly. Sayyid Turki despatched the Dar-ul-Salaam to Barkah and Sohar for aid, and having armed a number of Seedees and Balnchis at Maskat, sent tiiem to Mattrah. The rebel force consisting almost entirely of Hamood's freebooters, did not exceed 200 men, and was much inferior in number to the Garrison of Mattrah, but Sayyid Turki had not courage to assume the offensive. 716. On the 24th IT. M. S. Arab arrived opportunely, and anchored off Mat trah. Later in the day the Sultan received a message from Hamood that he was willing to come in to Maskat, under the safe conduct of certain Shaikhs, then with Sayyid Turki, whom he named, to treat for peace. The Shaikhs in (juestion were sent to El Wuteyyah the next morning, and returned with Hamood, who having received presents of food and money from the Sultan, went back to Ei Wuteyyah that evening. Negotiations between the Sultan and the rebels con tinued during the 27th and 28th, when it was arranged that the Sultan should in future pay to Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Salih Bin Ali monthly pen sions of dollars 200 and dollars 50, respectively. Hamood was satisfied with a present of money and food, and permission to visit Maskat with 4u followers once a year to receive gifts. 717. Major Grant concluded his final report with the following remarks ' The events of the last ten days must have shown the whole of Oman how easily a bold leader like Hamood with a handful of men can dictate terms and extort money at the o-ates of the capital. Jt is said that Abdool Azecz has damaged his reputation very much by joining an expedition led by si ch a notorious freebooter as Hamood-El-Jahafi.' 718. Intertribal disputes and occurrences in the interior of Oman in 1883.— Intertribal disputes and occurrences in the interior during 1882 are thus noted in the Administration Reports of the Maskat Agency :— ' In the month of Mav a collision was expected to occur between the Beni Jabir, Ghafiri, and the Beni Loaha, Hinawi, in Wadi Semail, in consequence of the former having destroyed some date trees belonging to the latter. These two tribes are always at feud. On^-SUth May bayyid I i aisal proceeded to bemail to mediate between them, and having succeeded in patching 1 up a peace, returned on i 2th June.

Sayyid Turki sent word to the Nadabiyeen and Hahbiyeen that the allowances previously paid them would be renewed if they held the passes for him as formerly, and they promised to do so. The dispute between the Beni Jabir and the Nadabiyeen regarding Suroor, however, continued, and the former, reinforced by the people of Naklil, attacked the Nadabiyeen, expelled them from Suroor, and cut down some of their date-trees.

The Beni Jabir, at the same time, intimated to Sayyid Turki that unless he or one of his sons led them they could not withstand the Nadabiyeen, if aided from El Sharkiyeh. The Sultan thought of proceeding to Semail in person but was dissuaded. He wrote to the Shaikh of the Nadabiyeen, inviting him to come and bring the Shaikh of the Rahbiyeen, when the latter returned from El Sharkiyeh, to Beerani, where the Minister, Sayyid Said, would meet them and discuss matters.

A few went afloat, but the maioritv elected to remain m their fort, where they deemed themselves safe from molestation. His Hio-hness Savvid lurki was good enough to offer Fort Jelali as an asylum for any British subiects who milhf desire to avail of it, but, happily, the need tor its shelter has not arisen 3 ' 8 ' On the morning of the 21st, Sunday, it was reported that the vangnard of the rebel foice had arrived at Rui, about 2 miles beyond Mattrah. While Sayyid Abdul Azeez was supposed to be resting comfortably there, he, having adopted a novel and skilfully conceived fekatT'nrpL™ lng ^ ^ ^ el » valley', to capture -J, u' ab0Ut h t ! lf 'i past T the a t tackin ?r r art y wared in front of the walls and made a simnltaneons attack in three places, where tne walls seemed to offer a better chance of beiiw sealed they were dressed in black clothes in order to allow of their appoaching as near as TaSny pT^^Sdet ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ™ ^ with •' T^f a . tt f ek , was entirely unexpected, but the garrison was fortunately on the alert and received the intruders with so effective and continuous a fire that the latter were sharply checked and thrown mto disorder. Sayyid Abdul Azeez behaved, it is said, with great gallantry and made determined efforts to bring np his men and place the ladders, but the fire was too heavy and he was compelled to retreat, leaving a number of dead in front of the walls ^ 1 ' Sayyid Turki, on hearing of the attack, sent the message on to me, and went immediate!v to the ramparts to encourage his men; by the time I arrived the attack was over and the firino- had ceased. No further attempt was made that night, and when day dawned not one of the enemy was in sight. It was soon ascertained however from spies that the invaders had returned to the upper part of the valley and to llui, that Sayyid Abdul Azeez, with a small following, had retired first to Sedab, from whence he shortly after proceeded to llui to -join Shaikh Salih who had not personally appeared on the scene of action. ' The attack it was generally expected would be renewed on the followino- nio-ht and as if was currently reported that Sayyid Abdul Azeez had a very large force with hfm, ft was antici pated that a still more determined assault than the first would be made. Apprehensive of the inadequacy of his garrison to offer an effectual resistance to heavy odds, His Highness Sayvid lurki addressed to me a formal request in writing for the active support of H. M. S. thilcmel. For the reasons I shall presently adduce, and after full consideration of tlie policv ot government, as laid down in the instructions received from time to time, it seemed to me t at 1 should be acting for the best, in the interests of this country, and for the protection of tfutish life and property, by acceding to His Highness' request, and 1 accordingly promised to do so. .oerore proceeding to act. however, I took the precaution of ordering ail British subiects remaining in Maskat out of the town and sent them on board vessels in the harbour except those attached to this Agency. ' ' During the day the Bar-nl-Salaam,, which had been despatched to Soor with letters for the tribes in Jaalan, returned with about 70 men of the Jeiieb-h: this small reinforcement, together with the promise of support from the man of-war, gave heart and courage to the defence. In the afternoon His Highness had reason to believe that Sayyid Abdul Azeez had changed the direction of his operations and would lead his force during the night against Mattrah, and, at His Highness' request, 1 proceeded there in the PkiUmelia watcirevents and to aid, if necessary, in preserving that town. On landing at Mattrah, with Captain Lang, I found the town almost deserted, the Arab population having retired to boats in the harbour. I communicated personally with the Governor of the town, who stated that the rebels were in the plain outside, and that a small attack had been made that night and repu'sed. He added that he had been led to believe that a vigorous assault would be made on the walls, and that with his little garrison he was hardly in a position to meet it successfully. I therefore desired Captain Lang to throw a -couple of shells over the rebels' position to deter them from advancing.' This appeared to have the desired effect, and we returned to Maskat/' 173 •' On Tuesday, the ^3rd, His Highness Sayyid Turki requested that a few shots might be thrown by H. M. S. Philomel, to deter the enemy, which was done at intervals during the night and the effect intended appaared to be produced. On the following morning, the SHtlr the rebels appeared in.force at the upper end of the valley, and on the heights above Kalbuh, from whence they kept up a fire on the towers guarding the sweet water-supply of the town, which it appeared to be their object to capture. It was fully expected that an attack would be made after dark and the usual preparations were made by the garrison to meet it. At the Sultan's request Captain Lang maintained an irregular fire at intervals throughout the night to dis concert the enemy and prevent their forming attacking parties. The intended effect was pro duced, for though the Arabs were seen moving about no attack was made, ' The Shaikhs of the Mesakereh and Harth Tribes, inimical to Shaikhs Salih bin Ali and Jumah bin Said, arrived on the 25th with reinforcements to the number of over 800 in obedience to His Highness Sayyid Turki's summons, and confidence was now to a great extent restored, as it was believed that Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Salih, seeing the futility of further hostilities, would now retire. The Arabs maintained a threatening attitude all day but as it now seemed improbable to me that they meditated any further attack on the town I took the wishes of the Sultan as regards continuing the fire of H. M. S. Philomel His Highness said he believed his brother's efforts would now cease, and he, moreover, considered his own strength to be sufficient to cope with him, even in the event of hostilities being re newed. With His Highness' full concurrence therefore I requested Captain Lang in the even^ ing to suspend further action, and the Philomel 's fire has not since been resumed? ' The next day, 26th, a small fleet of boats sailed into the harbour, bringing reinforce ments from various parts to the number of 700 or 800, and the relative position of the parties began to change. The gates were thrown open, and the garrison left their defences In the afternoon His Highness received news that Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Salih had broken camp at Rui and retreated homewards, leaving a small party only to bring on the wounded The loss sustained by the attacking force on the first night and in the subsequent skirmishing was very severe, and Sayyid Turki remarked to me that so decisive a conflict had not occurred in 'Oman since the battle of Dhank in 1869. The number of killed is now reckoned at about 70, including three or four Shaikhs. ' I ? 1 dec , i&lt; ? in ^ to accord to His Highness Sayyid Turki the active support formally requested by him, 1 have acted under a due sense of responsibility. Looking back to the in- structions that have been received from the Government of India during the past ten vears as to the policy to be pursued by this Agency m regard to Sayyid Turki, it appears that the first omers were received in January 1874, on the occasion of an attack of Shaikh Salih bin Ah, when the Resident was empowered to support His Highness Sayyid Turki as far as the guns of a vessel of war could reach. And during that year His Highness received substan- lal aid from us. The orders contained in your telegram on the 16th August 1875, while connrming this policy, explained the views of Government more clearly and fully, ti i' In v Jun ® l ? 77 ^ unexpected incursion was made on Maskatby Shaikh Salih and Sayyid bra im bin Kais, and the Acting Political Agent, on the authority of the instructions last quoted, gave the Sultan the aid of the guns of H. M. S. Teazer in repelling the attack. These proceedings were approved of by Government, and the effect of our action then has been so satisfactory in cnpplm- the power of Shaikh Salih for mischief, that Maskat has from that time enjoyed peace and immunity from threatened violence until now. •In my letter, dated 26th March 1S81, I took the view that His Highness Sayyid Turki was s rong enough to stand alone, but that, as his health was vCry precarious, instructions were advisable in anticipation of his death. I expressed the opinion that the death of Sayyid Lur,&lt;i would result m a general confusion and anarchy, and, I might venture to add, that the same results would ensue should Sayyid Turki be ousted from power, with the additional complication that His Highness would have to be provided for in some way. ' The claims of His Highness Sayyid Turki for favourable consideration are well known to Government, and it is hardly necessary for me to refer to them. He has faithfully adhered to the B^it^sir Clover n ^t ^ ' 011 ^ occas * oris » s ^ 10vvn proofs of his loyalty and friendship to nlaar ^as; gp net ally understood that His Highness expected support from us, and it was in i K77 me n i 0 laV i e w from him now the aid he had received on a similar occasion m IS// would have been considered by both parties as equivalent to a negative support to f rl n 1 eez ' f( ! r they would have inferred that Sayyid Turki had for some reason forfeited the favour of the British Government.

The command of the exped^ion was given to Sayyid Faisal, the Sultan's second son, who, with 1,800 men, left Jala.] on 3rd November for Semail. The instructions given Jum were of a moderate character. To meet the expense of the expedition Colo nel Miles advanced one monthly instalment of the Zanzibar subsidv, which Government approved. ^ 733.

The principal Shaikhs of the Beni Iluahah waited upon mm and were pardoned in consideration of a payment of $5,000. The Nidabiyeen a uj retired defile, where they were joined by Sayyid Abdul Azeez, with some of the Haboos from El Sharkiyeh. Shaikh Salah bin All came to the Jerdeh \ alley to collect a force to help them, but failed to do so. By the 16th the Nidabiyeen and Rahbiyeen tired of their position in El Akk and ^ tendered submission, which was accepted through the mediation of the Bern Bu Ali and Hishm, and they signed a document repudiating their recent alliance with the Hinawis, and promising loyalty to Sayyid Turki. They then gave notice to Sayyid Abdul Azeez to leave El Akk, which he did on the 19th. 734. The expedition having been thus far highly successful, Sayyid Turki determined to utilize it to reduce to subjection the Mawal of Wadi 175 H iMawaL who had been chronically hostile to him since his accession. SayykJ Faisal left Somnil for Wadi Mawal on 24th November. On his arrival at El Mai), the Harth and other Hinawi Shaikhs,, who accompanied him, proceeded in advance, at their own desire, to induce Nasir bin Muhammad, Shaikh of the Mawal, to submit. They were successful, and were returning with Shaikh Nasir to meet Sayyid Faisal, who had reached the village of Afi, when an acci dental altercation occurred there between some of the expeditionary force and the Mawal, in which 5 of the former and 14 of the latter were killed. Shaikh Nasir and his tribe, exasperated at this incident, broke olf the negocia- tions for their submission, but, after some discussion. Shaikh Nasir agreed to accompany Sayyid Faisal to Maskat and submit himself to Sayyid Turki's pleasure; the Shaikhs of the Beni Bu Ali guaranteeing that his life should not, be taken. The expedition then returned to Maskat, where Shaikh Nasir was imprisoned pending payment of a fine of $12,0 )0 by the Mawal. The Sultan, having no further need of their services, then dismissed the contingents of tribes which had composed the expedition with presents to their homes. 735. Intertribal disputes and occurrences in the interior of Oman in 1883: Wrecks of British ships on the coast— Intertribal disputes and occurrences in the interior, and the wrecks of two British ships on the coast are thus noted in the Administration Beports of the Maskat Agency:— 'In January a figlit took place near Ibra between El Harth and El Musakemh, in which 15 men were killed on both sides. f ' Towitrds the end of that month a letter arrived from Suleiman bin Suweilim, Wali of Dhofar, saying that the people of Dhofar had besieged the fort and asking for reinforeeraentsy and on the 1/th Februa y His Highness sent 70 men and a ten-pounder gun to Dhofar; but, in the meantime the fort having proved impregnable, the siege hud been raised and the rein forcements were therefore sent back. » , 'In May the Sultan attempted to renew negociations with Shaikh Hilal bin Zahir, of the Beni Hina, through the mediation of Hamood-El-Jahafi, for the surrender of the fort of Nezwa, which Hilal bad promised before to delivei up for a certain sum, but nothing eame of it and the fort still remains in the possession of Hilal. u In July a collision occurred at Karkah between the Wuhhabee garrison and the towns people resulting in two men being killed and six wounded. The townspeople, having been worsted, called in the aid of Mawalees, who came down and besieged the fort. The Wazit Sayyid Said however was despatched to Barkah in the Dar-ul-Salaam and effected a fat^sfac* tory adjustment of the affair. ^ 'In November Shaikh Bar gash Temeemeh, of the Beni Ghafir tribe, and a man of some importance, was murdered at Bahila by his two brothers, who stabbed him while he was asleep, and then seized the fort. ' . ■ *THF ' Notwithstanding his late reverse Shaikh Salih did not desist from intriguing among the tribes and endeavouring to organize another rising against the Sultan. He tried first wifb the Hejriyeen and then with the Beni Bu Hasan, but failed to induce them to engage in hosti lities, and he has since remained tolerably quiet. 'Two vessels were wrecked on the southern Coast of Arabia during 1883. In the month of August Major Mockler received information of .he crew of the $&gt;. S. Knight of the Bath, which had been wrecked at the Kooria Mooria Islands being at an Arab village near Has, Sankirah, and, on the report reaching India,, the Amherwitch was despatched to their rescue and they were taken to Bombay. In September the crew of the S. S. Avy arrived at Maskat in an Arab baghlah and were taken to Bombay. The Airy had struck near Rus Fartak and been stranded, but the whole of the crew were saved/' 736. Position of affairs on 1st January 1884. —At this date Sayyid Turki's position was probably more secure, and his authority greater than they had been at any time since his accession. The unexpected vigour which he displayed in expelling the attack on Maskat by the rebels under Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh bin Ali in the previous October, and the energy with which, under his direction, that success was followed up had condoned in public estimation the feebleness and apathy of his rule in recent years, and very much surprised his antagonists. Shaikh Salih bin Ali, it is true, defeated but not 176177 3o A V disheartened, at once resumed his habitual course of j ed to organize another expedition of El Sharkiveh an ^ e y en attempt- against Maskat. But his efforts met with no re?n on so « CS Kais had, before the rebellion in October avowArl ? - i ' , k K \ Jbraluoi bin in no further enterprises against Sayyid Turki and to eil ? n &amp;' e rupt in means and reputation, had ceased, for'the time' beini' tl! hT*' There was peace throughout the country and some uro'uecV'nf if/ da '? et ? us - for a moderate display of firmness in the Snltm i.J, T 1 ' ts co iitinuing, ■Omani sedition and turbulence 38 alwa y s ^'Bced to repress ' ' xcji^ULCU Lliai tnent of India, No/ie'; Vated' isth ^'piiance^ with a request of Sayyid Turki for January i88i. pecuniary aid m connection with the'htp rpholi;^ A.

Revival of the Slave Trade from Zanzibar—On 12th May 1884, Colonel Miles reported the prevalence of „,rar«f indivNo! mdatedTist rumours of the revival of the East African slave May 1884. _ trade, consequent on a belief, which had got abroad, A. Poll. E., Aug. 1884, Nos. Uo-i the British Government no longer regarded slave-trading with the same rigid antagonism as hitherto. This belief Colonel Miles attributed, in some measure, to the break-up of H. M. S. London at Zanzibar, and the removal of the naval establishment there for the suppression of the trade, and to General Gordon's proclamation, permitting domestic slavery at Khartoum, whose tenor had been widely and inaccurately circulated among Arabs. 744. On 9th June the Political Agent reported that certain information bad reached him of the landing of several cargoes mC arof m'h of slaves at Soor, El Khadrah, and Sowaik on the June 1884, coast of 'Oman. At the Political Agent's instance a . Poll.

The Nakhoda had escaped to the shore before the capture was made, but six Arab passengers, owners of most of the slaves, were made over to the Sultan, who imprisoned them pending reference regarding their disposal to Government. Among the Nakhoda's effects was found a packet of letters, regarding which Colonel Miles wrote :— 'The information obtained from this correspondence confirms the reports that had before reached me, to the effect that a large importation of slaves has taken place this year from Zanzibar coast to Arabia. For the past ten years this slave transport by sea has been, without duubt, practically in abeyance, owing: chiefly, 1 believe, to the vigilance and energy of the naval force engaged in patrolling the East African coast. But this check has lately been in a great measure removed, and a widespread belief has arisen among the Arabs that the former restrictions placed by the British Government on the slave trade have been withdrawn. The preventive measures adopted in his territories by the Sultan of Zanzibar are, in my humble opinion, neither sincere nor effective/' 746. On 18th October H. M. S. Philomel, while proceeding from Maskat t, j A t» • r. i&lt;. x o to Aden, captured off Maseerah Islands another Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- ,, -T, , i i mi n • ment of India, No. 215, dated 28th dhow with 51 slaves on board.

If a third vessel were available, one would be best stationed near the entrance of the Persian Gulf, patrolling occasionally along the Batinah coast.

Some account of the Khojahs settled in 'Oman.—Colonel Miles Government of India, to Resident, having been directed to obtain the opinion of the Khojah community of Maskat on the provisions of a proposed ' Bill to amend and define the law relat ing to testamentary and intestate succession to Khojahs, with statement of objects and reasons,' reported as follows:— A , The Khojahs came to this country originally from Sind, and are known locally to the ra s as Hyderabadees, J and ' Looteeas,' such of them as left Sind prior to the British rr s -r n are r ® c f8' ni zed as Arab subjects. The remainder, who number about ,, j ^ 1111 are un ^ er British protection. Although many reside in the seaport towns on e Uman coast for purposes of trade, the great majority inhabit the town of Mattrah, where ey number about 400 families, and dwell together in a separate quarter, divided from the rest ot the town by a wall. Within this enclosure they admit no strange residents, and inter marry only among themselves. ' Originally the Khojahs appear to have sprung from various Hindoo castes, and become amalgamated into one sect by the bond of religion, in which the old Hindoo domestic laws were ^ HiIsmaili Shiah? Orthodox Sliiahs. Sunnia preserved intact with an outer garb of Muhammadanism. Schism has been at work, however aad they have now split up into three divisions, viz.— 1. Ismaili Shiah Khojahs, acknowledging Agha Ali Shah as their Imam, 2. Orthodox Shiah Khojahs, seceders from Agha Khan, . 3. Sunni Khojahs also seceders from Agha Khan. . . , Of these divisions the least numerous in Maskat are the Sunni Khojahs, the other two being' about equal. The peculiarity of the distribution is, however, that while most of the men have as they consider, progressed and adopted new tenets, the women have remained staunch to the Imam', and have rejected the lead of their husbands and fathers in spite of much petty perse cution. At Mattrah they have their own religious meeting house, and collect contributions among themselves for despatch to H. H. Ali Shah. The religious distribution of the Khojahs is roughly as follows :— Males and Females. 30 560 517 40 3 T otai 650 600 ' The schism commenced among the Khojahs in Maskat about 4S or 50 years ago, when a small number, having probably visited Bombay, turned Sunnis and renounced their allegiance to the Imam. Subsequently a change took place. Khojahs, arriving from Bandar Abbas, who had imbibed orthodox Shiah doctrines in Persia, took the lead among the seceders, and this section increased rapidly until the year 1^72, when many Agha Khanis joined the orthodox Shiah party, and the latter held a meeting at which they drew up and signed a document stating their resolution to be guided by the Muhammadan law henceforth in all matters. The Khojah community here has been thus, since the beginning of the schism in about the year 1835, in a state of transition, of which the result has been, so far, that the great majority of the men have turned orthodox Muhammadans. ' Among the causes wlrch have operated in impelling so many Khojahs to secede from the Ismaili religion of late years must be included the vagueness and uncertainty of its laws, more particularly those of succession. These laws, originally purely Hindoo, have become complicated through the interfering action of the Mookhees and Jammats with the natural consequence of uneasiness and dissatisfaction among the community. In Maskat and Zanzibar at all events the decisions of the Mookhees and Jammats have varied as it suited their purposes at the time and a door has been opetied to serious abuses, which the present Bill, if passed, may be expected to remove. ' • 'In taking the opinion of the followers of Agha Khan on the provisions of the Bill, I found a difficulty in eliciting any independent views from them. They were desirous only to know whether their Imam had approved of it, and, when they were assured that H. H. Agha Khan had been duly consulted by the Bombay Government when the Khojah Commission was appointed, they expressed themselves satisfied, and exhibited no further inclination to discuss the details of the Bill. ' The Mookhiani and elders of the women were interviewed by me separately from the men, with a similar result. ihe nevv Khojahs or orthodox Shiah party, on the other hand, were decidedly opposed to the Bill. 1 hey stated that they had for some years accept(d and been guided by the pure Muhammadan law, and that they had no intention now to revert to the old Khojah customs. They listened when the principal points of the Bill were explained to them in silence, but with indifference, and no discussion took place on it. It was, however, pointedly remarked by some of them, that in the Khojah Commission which sat in Bombay no member of their sect-had been included. The Agha Khanis and unm Khojahs had been fully represented, but no orthodox Shiah, they said, had been allowed a v o | c e ln the matter. r i ne cause of this probably was that, at that time, no orthodox Shiah Khojah existed in Bombay.' 751.

Defeat of the Wali of Zikkiby Shaikh Hilal-bm-Zahar El Hinawi near Fark.— Early in May the Sultan received news of a reverse suffered by the Wali of Zikki at the hands of Shaikh Hilal-bin-Zahar near Fark. It appeared that the people of Fark had made overtures to Suliman-bin- Suweylim, the Wali of Zikki, to hand over their fort which was in possession of Shaikh Hilal, to Sa^yid Turki. The Wali sent envoys, and the fort was delivered to them, but on the approach of Shaikh Hilal from Nezwa the envoys abandoned their position. The Wali meanwhile had advanced and met Shaikh Hilal's force, by which he was defeated with a loss of three or four men. 768. Sayyid Turki considered that the Wali had behaved injudiciously.

Attack on Behla by the Yaarebeh and Ibriyeen tribes.—Oa 24th May Colonel Miles reported that a political movement of some importance was taking place in Oman at Behla, where the heirs of the Yaarebeh dynasty, in conjunction with the Ibriyeen tribes, were engaged in besieging that fortress. He considered that the movement had been initiated by Shaikh Salim-bin- Badr El Ibri, who under pretence of attempting to take the fort in behalf of the Sultan was really actuated by a spirit of revenge for the murder of his father and grandfather by Shaikh Bargash and Hamad-bin-Mohsin in 1881, and by a desire to wrest the place from the power of the Ghafiris. On 26th May the Sultan received news of the collapse of the siege and the successful defence of the fort by its holder Shaikh Nasir-bin-Hameyd. 770. Rumours of rising by Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Saleh against Maskat. and adoption of a definite policy by the Government of India towards His Highness Sayyid Turki.—In August the rumours that Sayyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali were about to attack Maskat, which had been rife for some months, became so strong that Sayyid -Turki took the precaution to close the passes, and Colonel Miles addressed His Highness to take measures to protect the life and property of British subjects on the coast. 771. The Resident in the Persian Gulf, Colonel Ross, on hearing of these rumours, addressed the Government of India as follows :— ' In view to the large commercial interests at stake, the general friendly relations existing between the British Government and Sayyid Turki, and the active support which hns already on some occasions been accorded him by Government, I would now suggest that a definite line of policy should be adopted as regards attacks on Matrah and Maskat, and that Sayyid Abdul Azeez and the other insurrectionary leaders should be informed that even in the event of their gaining possession of those towns temporarily they would be driven out by the British Govern ment and Sayyid Turki replaced in possession.' Colonel Eoss was of opinion that such an intimation would put a stop to the frequent risings and scares to which Oman was liable. 772. The Government of India in reply described the above suggestion as Govej-nment of India, to Resident, a clianse of policy and feared that it might commit September'!885. 0 1K ' ^ 1,1 i ' th them to the necessity of 44 propping up by force of (Exti. a , Mar. 1886, Nos. 142 -152.) arms ' a ruler who had already proved his failure, and f&lt;: involve the support of a Sultan rie jure who could not hold his own without that support/' They said that the policy of the Government of India had always been ' to abstain from mixing with dynastic disputes, to support the rie facto ruler, and to assist him in quelling tribal disturbances; ' they accordingly invited a further consideration of the question. 773. Colonel Ross expressed his viiews more fully in answer. He ex- Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- plained that .the susrsestion was not so much a * ment of India, No. lo7, dated 7th i , • c xi • i • _ October 1885. change as a strengthening of the existing policy, ^ (Exti, a , Mar. 1886, Nos. 142-152.) and that it would apply only in the case of Sayjid Turki and not in regard to future Sultans or Sayyid Turki's children. He laid stress on the fact that we were bound in honour to support Sayyid Turki by orce of arms it necessary, and on the necessity for such support, if given at all, being thorough. He added that the mere fact of an intimation such as he lad suggested, would in itself,'as far as could be foreseen, deter the leaders of re oellion from further attempts against Sayyid Turki's power. 184g 135 : 'if . 774.

Colonel Miles pointed out to His Highness the difficulties and OuuSfs^d ?, an f yf 0f . th ! I^' 1 atld re P orted hi9 arguments in (Extl.

I also pointea out to His Highness that, considering our friendly relations and the circumstances or his position, it would hardly be in accordance with the courtesy and respect due to the British Government for him to leave Maskat on a distant journey without first communicatino- his intentions to His Excellency the Viceroy of India.' 779. bayyid Turki after some consideration acknowledged the cogency Government of India, to Resident, of Colonel Miles' objections and abandoned his journey. The Government of India considered the advice tendered by Colonel Miles to His Highness Persian Unit', No. 1382-E., dated 3rd September 1885. (Extl. A, Sept. 1885, Nos. 85-87.) the Sultan was judicious. 780.—Increase of tax on produce brought from interior to the coast for exportation— On 16th August the Political Agent reported that His Highn&amp;ss desired to raise the tax on produce brought to the coast from the interior for exportation to one of 5 per cent, ad valorem^ on the ground of the rise in price of dates in recent years. Colonel Miles said— ' This tax is, properly speaking, recoverable from the Arab producer?, but as a matter of fact it is only in rare cases that His Highness is able to collect it from the tribes, and he therefore prefers to recover it through his customs farmer from the Indian traders settled in the various ports along the coast who purchase the fruit from the Arabs.' 781. Colonel Ross in referring the matter to Government wrote— ' It appears to me that if the British Government considered it expedient it could under Kesident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- the terms of the treaty claim exemption for British subjects from any tax of the sort discussed; but it was decided by the Government of India that the treaty should not be considered applicable^ and that tlj.e former moderate tax should not be 185 Political Asrent, to Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 224, dated 16th August 1885.

The proposed levy of 5 per cent, ad valorem, it seems to me, would constitute a serious innovation, and I think may justly be objected toby Government if it is considered expedient to do so.' 782. The Government of India beld that the tax was in reality an export Ooveriment of wh. to Re-Mct. and that it mi-ht certainly be argued that the Persian Gulf, No. 1759-E., dated 5th Saltan was precluaed trom imposing such a duty November 1885. ^0 terms of the Commercial Treaty with the (Exti. a, ncc. 1885, Nos. 129-181.) British Government. But they added that— ' Fven if this view of our rights were capable of being upheld upon the strict interpreta tion of the treaties, ypt it would be more reasonable with regard to the equity of tho case to look upon the treaties as making no stipulations as to export duties. Provideu that British subjects are not treated worse in this respect than Muscat subjects, or than tl»e subjects of the most favoured nation, nothing more appears to be necessary. It would hardly be fair to the Sultan to insist upou his imposing no duty at all in the case of the goods exported by British subjects.' 783. The Government of India considered it inexpedient accordingly to interfere with the 5 per cent ad valorem tax, but directed that the Political A^ent should point out to the Sultan that it was obviously against his interests to^tax exports at such rates as to divert trade to other ports, and to further inform him that the Government of India had no wish to press their treaty claims to freedom from all export duty, so long as the rate imposed was reason ably low. 784. Sayyid Turki on being informed of the orders of Government remit ted all other taxes in favour of the new one of 5 per cent, ad valorem, and noti fications to the British Indian traders at the various ports were issued by the Political Agent. 785. Affray between Beni Ghafir and Ibriyeen tribes in the Wady Sahtani near Eostak.— A serious fight occurred in September be tween the Beni Ghafir and the Ibriyeen tribes in the Wady Sahtani. The Wady had been for some time in the joint occupation of both tribes, but a feud existed between them, and the result of this contest was to give the Beni Ghafir the supremacy of the valley. The political effect of the affair was to increase Sayyid Ibrahim-bin-Keis authority in the Hostak district, as the Beni Ghafir were his strongest supporters, and indeed the defeat of the Ibri yeen was looked on as a reverse for Sayyid 'i urki, with whom the latter tribe was in alliance. 786. Complaints of British Indian traders at Matrah regarding the weighment of dates-—In September complaints were made to the Poli tical Agent by the British Indian traders at Matrah that attempts were being made by the customs farmer and agents of the Sultan to compel them to take all dates purchased by them to Maskat for weighment, a procedure which entailed much unnecessary expense on them. 787. Colonel Miles addressed His Highness on the subject and pointed out that such interference with free trade was contrary to treaty stipula tions. 788. His Highness promised to remove the cause of complaint, but some days having elapsed without a withdrawal of the objectionable prohibition. Colonel Miles addressed a further remonstrance to His Highness which had the desired effect. 789. Slave Trade. •—Her Majesty's Ship Osprey arrived at Maskat on 19th September with a cargo of 72 slaves taken in a dhow off Ras-el -Had. * The case was tried in the Vice-Admiralty Court and the whole batch con demned. In October another dhow and seven slaves captured by Her Majesty's ship 'Ranger at Soor were condemned. . 780. Colonel Miles made the following remarks 188 5- in a report to the Resident in the Persian Gult re- (Exti. a, Apni 1886, Nos. 103.124A.) garding the working of the slave trade opera tions :— besides rescuing and restoring to freedom a number of wretched creatures, the opera tions have been of value in determining two points. One of these is that the East African 186187 \U slave trade has revived and is now ao-ain in fnll • it from information gleaneJ from Arabic corresnondpnrr'fn 0 P mion I ^ad formed observing' the falHn the price of slaves, a^d from local reThe oth''^ ^ now satisfied is that the bulk of the slaves are ^ the year, when the dhows run up during the firsT3soon WeTzJ' the of i ai wok and subsequent suicide of Senov Husein Bn-jr of the Political Agency Guard— In September Husein b L a sepov Of t it&gt; Guard of the Marine Battalion stationed at Maskat for the WeS of the Ireasmy, &amp;c., ran amok Possessing himself of a lifle and several rounds of ammunition he paraded the narrow streets of the town. After firing at a woman m one of the houses without effect, he met a Negro slave beWiW v fi Highness the Sultan, whom he shot, killing him on the spot. By^this time the Havaldar of the guard, without attempting the man's capture 'him- self, reported the matter to Colonel Miles, who at once proceeded in person to ^ttect his arrest. Husein Bux however, on seeing Colonel Miles, threw him- se f into the sea under iort Zeram, and weighted as he was with his rifle and S f ^T ^u 17 ' . When his bod y was ^covered life was extinct. The evidence showed that the unfortunate man was suffering from the effects of ganja.

Heavy ram fell simultaneously all over Oman, causing immense damae-e to houses, crops and trees. In June, news was received that an insurrection had taken place at o . r . Which was confirmed in October by the Wali, Ali-bin Suliman, together with the Arab gamson, coming to Maskat; they having been expelled by the inhabitants of Dofar from whom, however, letters Were received in which their friendship for, and allegiance to.

On the news reaching Maskat His Highness Sayyid Turki sent his son Sayyid Feysai to Seeb, to enquire into the matter; but before his arrival, a truce for one year had been arranged by the Shaikhs of Semail. In August Sayyid Feysal and Fabd proceeded in the S, S. Dar-as-Salam to Sur to endeavour to obtain payment ot certain customs duty from the Jenibeh, but were unsuccessful. In the same month a party of Mokabil raided the district of Majaz. near Sohad and lifted some camels, but were promptly followed and reduced to submission by the Wali of Sohar, Hamad- bin- N asir. ' I n November a serious collision occurred in the Sharkey eh between the Mesakereh on the one side and the Harth, Hijriyeen, Rejeybi, and El Wahibah on the other, in which 60 or 7 0 men were killed. Ali-bin-Salim El Amiri was despatched by His Highness the Sultan to mediate between the parties, in which mission he was successful. In December the Political Agent, Colonel Miles, made an interesting tour of 20 days through Oman and the Dahireh country and was received everywhere with great courtesv and cordiality.' 793' Position of affairs on 1st January 1886- —The country was at this time more peaceful than usual, and Sayyid Turki's position was shortly to be considerably strengthened by the decision of the Government of India to give him active support when necessary. His Highness was also informed in Janu ary that Her Majesty the Queen had been graciously pleased to confer upon him the Insignia of a G.O.S.I. 794. Attempt to assassinate the Prime Minister.—On the evening of ^th January Sayyid Saeed was fired at while returning to his house by an African slave. The bullet struck him in the shoulder, inflicting happily a slight,,, i, woun d only. The would-be assassin, after firing the shot, threw the pistol flesh wouM / d his tlle single attendant failing to him. The pistol found to he one belonging to Sayyid Saeed himself. and the affair was believed to be due to harem intrigues. 795. Complaints of oppression bjr the Khoja traders ofEhabureh •ZVu, nf foliar —'['be Khoia merchants of Khabureh complained fn g jfnna v e to W £ Fob tical Agent of ilVti -eatment at the hands of kyyid Hamad 'hiu.Nasir, Wali of Sobar. The Wall, -bey sold, had attempted to exact f fnXd loan of $10a from them, and had hindered tlieir trading operations on tW refusal to nav. He had also imposed an extra tax of 2 per cent, on their purchases 'and had imprisoned without cause one of their community. Sayyid Turki promised to enquire into these complaints, and wrote shortly after to Colonel Miles in extenuation of the Wall's conduct. Colonel Miles however, nf rvninion that Savvid Hamad -bin-Nasir was in reality guilty of the offences charged ^gab?st Min, and advised Bis Highness that he was hardly a fit man for the position of Wali. His Highness on further enquiry, agreed to pay $ 100 as compensation to the traders for their losses and the imprisonment of one of their number, and ordered the appointment of another W ah for Khabureh.

Attempt to seduce the Wazeer from his allegiance to the Sllitan —On 4ith March Sayyid Saeed, the Prime Minister, received a letter from Savyid Abdul Azeez, inviting him to join Lis cause and piomising him ample rewards. This letter was at once shown to His Highness, whose first impulse was to send his brother a rough answer. It is probable, however, that on Sayyid Saeed's recommendation an answer was sent containing no reference to the proposal. 798. Visit of Resident in the Persian Gulf— On 2nd April Colonel Ross visited Ma skat, and alter an interview with His Highness Sayyid lurki left for India to take up the appointment of Resident at Hyderabad. Colonel Miles took charge of the office of Resident in the Persian Gulf and Colonel Mockler of that of Political Agent and Consul at Maskat. 799- Present of a Steamer to His Highness the Sultan from his brother the Sultan of Zanzibar—On 27th April the S. S. Sulianee arrived in Maskat, having been sent as a present to his brother by bayyid Bargash, Sultan of Zanzibar. 800. Execution of the Shaikh of the Beni Eattash.—On the 8th May Muhammad-bin-Shinas, Shaikh of the Beni Battash, visited Maskat. On arrival he w 7 as seized and imprisoned by order of His Highness, and the fohow- ing day was put to death. No reason could be assigned for this deed, except that he was a turbulent character and had recently been giving much trouble. 801- Slave Trade. —A dhow was brought into Maskat for adjudication by Her Majesty's Ship Hcindeer oxi 29th May. She had been captured off Ras Madraka and had two suspected slaves on board. After enquiry the \ ice- Admiralty Consular Court released the dhow. The suspected slaves were proved to be khalasies kidnapped at the vessel's port of departure. 802. On 16th June Her Majesty's Ship TVoodlarlt captured a dhow with 21 slaves on board off Ras el Had. The Consular Court condemned this vessel and released all the slaves. 803. Proposal to annex to Maskat, Khor Fakan and certain other ports. —In June Hamad-bin-Nasir, Wali of Sohar, reported to His Highness 188189 ihat the people of Khor Fakan Dibba and Wadi-al-Hilloo, wished to be taken under the protection of the Maskat Government. 804. Sayyid Turki requested the Political Agent to obtain the advice of the Resident, Colonel Miles, as to the annexation of these ports. 805. Colonel Miles wrote :— Eesident, Persian Gulf, to Political Agent, No. ill, dated 6tli July 1886. (Extl.

Alleged imprisonment of a Khoja woman at Muttrah by the Political Agent and subsequent release by the Sultan.— In January of this year a petition was addressed by certain Khojas to the Government of Bombay. The petitioners stated that about 400 Khojas, who formerly belonged to the Shia Ismaeli sect, had recently seceded from their faith and were now resorting to cruelty and oppression to induce their wives to follow them, in which course they were being strongly supported by the Sultan of Maskat; that a case of torture had come before the Political Agent, who had sentenced the husband to one year's imprisonment, and that the man had then been released by the Sultan. 809. The Political Agent was requested to report the facts of this case after inquiry. Colonel Mockler's investigation discredited the petitioner's story in toto, and shewed that the case of torture was mythical. The Resident in report ing to Government said— ' The statement that a Khoja, sentenced to a year's imprisonment by the British Consul, had been released by the Sultan, has been explained by one of the petitioners to Colonel Mockler to have been written under a misapprehenpion by the English writer of the petition. I need hardly observe that it lias never occurred, within my experience at Maskat, that the Local Government has attempted to interfere directly cr indirectly with any punishment inflicted at the Consulate on a British subject. His Highness Sayyid Turki is not at all likely to make such a mistake/' 13? 810. Presentation of Insignia of Gr. C. S. I. to His Highness Sayyid Turki. —On the 11th July Colonel Miles, the Resident, arrived at Maskat to present the Insignia of the G.C.S. I. to His Highness Sayyid Turki. A Dar- bar was held for the purpose on the 13th idem, at which the Naval officers on the station, the American Consul, and most of the principal chiefs of Oman were present. Advantage was taken of the opportunity offered by this Darbar to again inform His Highness, in a more formal and public fashion, that the Government were prepared to actively support him against his enemies. Sayyid Turki had invited his brother Sayyid Abdul Azeez to be present on the auspi cious occasion, and guaranteed his safety while in Maskat. Abdul Azeez, how ever, required a guarantee of protection by the British Government, and ad dressed the Political Agent accordingly. The Political Agent and Resident con curred in thinking it unadvisable to involve the Government in the guarantee without distinct orders. The Government of India wrote as follows on. this point:— :t The Government of India regret that Abdul Azeez was not induced to come in on the Government of India, to Resident, occasion ot the recent Darbar, and they aie inclined to think Persian Gulf, No. 2044 -E., dated 2nd that, having regard to the proved loyalty of Sayyid Turki, September 1886. might not have been undesirable for the Political Agent to (Extl, a , Sept. 1886, Nos. 133-143.) give the required guarantee, first obtaining Sayyid Turki's consent. They fully understand your reasons for taking a contrary view, and have no wish whatever to convey disapproval of your action j but if a similar opportunity should again occur, the Governor-General in Council would desire you to reconsider the possibility of meeting the wishes of Abdul Azeez without risk of embarrassing consequences. If you are still ot opinion that it would be imprudent to give a guarantee, you should act upon your own judgment in the matter/'811. Humours of attack on Maskat— The following telegram was sent on 1st October from the Political Agent to the Resident:— &lt;&lt; Letters received 27th September from Sliaikh of Rahabeen that Saleh-bin-Ali and all Hinawees had sent a messenger to him demanding passage through Kahza Pass, intending to attack Maskat, seeing it had few defenders. On 28th letter received that Abdul Azeez had gone with Haboos to Beni Battash. I detained Woodlark here. Letters received to-day that rising has collapsed from want of unanimity among the leaders/' 812. United states Consul.—Mr. A. Mackirdy, of Messrs. Towell and Co., relieved Mr. L. Maguire of the same firm in the post of United States Consul on 1st October. 813- Sayyid Abdul Azeez writes demanding an interview with tlie Prime Minister.— 'On 13th October letters were received by the Wazeer Sayyid Hilal-bin-Ahmad and Sayyid Mahomed-bin.Azzan from Sayyid Abdul Azeez at Hajir, where he had arrived with 200 men. Abdul Azeez demanded an interview with the above-named persons, and threatened to destroy their pro perty in the vicinity of Hajir should they refuse to meet him. A force was sent against Abdul Azeez by the Sultan, which met with some resistance on the way, but found Hajir evacuated on arrival. 815. Eesident in Persian G-ulf and Political Agent.— Colonel Ross passed through Maskat on 24th October on his way to Bushire to take up the appointment of Resident in the Persian Gulf, and Colonel Mockler was relieved at Maskat by Colonel Miles, who took charge of the Political Agency on 6th November. 816. Inter-tribal disturbances and minor events in 1886.— Inter tribal disputes, &amp;c., are thus narrated in the Administration Reports of the Maskat Agency :— t( In April Muhammad and Murash, sons of Nasir-bin-Seif, former Shaikh of the Beni Riam, were put to death by their uncle, Suleiman-bin-Seif, at Nezwa, he fearing that they would wrest from him the Shaikhdom ; the other two sons made their escape. 'On 28th July His Highness SayyidTurki, accompanied by his son, Sayyid Muhammad, started for a trip into the interior and was absent for a week. His Highness had not visited the interior for many years. ' Tn September it was reported that the Hinawees had determined to rise, with the object of establishing the Sultan's brother, Sayyid Abdul Azeez, at Soor, or making war on the Ghafri tribe of Jaalan. It was also reported that Sayyid Abdul Azeez had gone with a party of the Haboos to the Beni Battash country. The Beni Battash attacked the fort of Kurryat, but were repulsed with loss. They looted the store rooms of a Bannia of about $250 worth of goods. Reinforcements were sent to Kurryat under command of Sayyid Badr-bin Seif. ' In October the Beni Battash having become divided in their councils, Sayyid Abdul Azeez, who had gone to their assistance with some of the Haboos, left their country. * ' a force of some 1,200 men which was subsequently augmented by 25 horse and one gun, was sent by sea to Kurryat, under command of Sayyid Badr-bin-Seif and the Sultan's sons to coerce the Beni Battash. On 23rd instant news was received that the force had been opposed by the Beni Battash at Mizfah, who had been routed with a loss of seven men. The force subsequently destroyed the town of Mizfah and razed Mazara, the principal fort of the Beni Battash, who tendered their submission and offered to pay a fine of ^10,000. tf His Highness Sayyid Turki sent a present of six horses to Her Majesty the Queen Empress. •^ i ov ® m ^ er against the Beni Battash returned bringing with them the ika Adi-bin-Nasir and six others, who were immediately on arrival imprisoned until the nne should be paid. They were subsequently released on payment of $4,000.' bi&lt;. Position of affairs on 1st January 1887-— The year 1886 had been a comparatively peaceful one for Oman, though, as already shewn, it was by no means uneventful as far as His Highness Sayyid Turki was personally concerned. Matters were indeed unusually quiet, and the Sultan's feeling of security considerably augmented. Signs were, however, unfortunately not want- mg that bayyid Turki's health was failing, and the occasional restlessness of his c aracter was beginning to be more marked. 190'5? 818. Raids by Bedomns on Batineh Coast.— About the middle of January disturbances began to occur on the Batineh Coast, where the Beni Kattah, El Awamir and other predatory tribes committed some depreda tions m the vicinity of Shmas and Sohar. The Banian traders of the former place complained to the Political Agent that they had suffered losses to the extent of $400 in paying blackmail, and were apprehensive of danger to life and property. Her Majesty's Ship Onprey was requested to call at IShinas on her way to Jask and afford protection to British subjects if necessarv. His Highness the bultan took the needful steps to subdue the marauders and com pensated the Banians for their losses. Colonel Miles, the Political Agent, attri buted the raids to the absence from his post of the Wali of Sohar, Savyid Hamad-bin-Nasir, who was subsequently dismissed by the Sultan' Sayyid Hamad Wad Samar being appointed in his stead. 8m Colonel Miles remarked in his report of the Persian Gulf. occurrence that— (Extl. A, April 1887, Nos. 120-129.) ' The warlike and predatory Bedouins can be kept quiet by two agents only—fear or money ; and when they are not kept in cheek by one or pacified by the other, they are sure to become restless and look out for plunder. ' 820- Jubilee of Her Majesty the Queen. —The 16th February was observed m Mask at as a day of celebration in. honor of the Jubilee of Her Majesty the Queen-Empress of India. His Highness the Sultan caused an Imperial salute of 101 guns to be fired, which was returned by a salute of 21 guns from Her Majesty's Ship Osprey, During the course of the day His High ness held a grand Darbar at his palace, at which the Political Agent, the Agency Surgeon, and the captain and officers of the Osprey were present. A kharita was handed to His Highness from the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, and Sayyid Turki in reply took occasion to express his sincere gratifi cation in being able to take part in celebrating the 50th year of Her Majesty's reign and his gratitude for the many favours he had received from the British Government during his own. He also stated that he had despatched a tele gram of congratulation direct to Her Majesty. 821. Throughout the day the flagstaffs at the palace, on the forts, at the British and American Consulates were dressed with flags, as were also Her Majesty's Ship Osprey and all the ships in the harbour. In the evening the palace, the Political Agency, the hospital, the houses of the Indian merchants and the whole front of the town, as well as Her Majesty's Ship Osprey were brilliantly illuminated, and a display of fireworks took place from the palace. 822. On the following day His Highness Sayyid Turki paid the Political Agent the honour of a visit, and repeated his congratulations on the occasion, and in the evening there were further illuminations and displays of fireworks. All classes concurred spontaneously in observing the occasion as a general holiday, the customs house being closed and no business transacted for two days, while large numbers of poor were fed by the Sultan and the Indian merchants. The latter community also despatched a telegram to Her Majesty conveying their respectful felicitations. 823- Complaints of the Padthli Sultan against Maskat subjects pearl-fishing in his waters- —In March the Political Resident at Aden addressed the Political Agent regarding a complaint made by the Fadthli Sultan against subjects of Maskat for fishing for pearls in the waters of that Chief without permission or payment of fees. General Hogg suggested that steps should be taken to prohibit the practice. 824. Colonel Mockler, the Political Agent, in reply, pointed out that a similar complaint had been made in 1882, when it had been explained that from time immemorial the Arabs of these parts had fished in the waters re ferred to, and that since then no further objections had been made. 825. Colonel Mockler further said that the greater portion of the pearl- divers, who visited the South Arabian coast, were stated to be natives, not of Maskat, but of places in the Persian Gulf, and suggested reference being made, if necessary, to the Resident at Bushire.826. Political Agent—On 16th April Colonel Mockler relieved Colonel Miles as Political Agent and Consul, on the appointment of the latter to be 'Resident at Oudeypore. 827. Boats of Her Majesty's Ship 'Kingfisher' fired at —Two boats of Her Majesty's Ship Kingfisher, wbich were lying at anchor at Soor, were fired at during the night of 15th April. On the first shot being fired the lights were put out, but a second shot falling close to the boats, they were obliged to put to sea for safety. A third shot was fired but fell short. Fortunately no damage was done. 828. The matter on being represented to the Sultan was duly enquired into, but no information as to the oifenders was elicited. 829. Slave Trade.- On 22nd May a dhow was seized by the boats of Her Majesty's Ship Kingfisher. Tour slaves who were on board had been landed at Karryat previous to the seizure. The dhow was condemned by the Consular Court. 830. Capture of the Fort of Birket El Moze by Shaikh Suleiman- bin-Seif. —Early in June news was received in Maskat that, through the treachery of some' of the garrison, the Fort of Birket El Moze had been captured by Shaikh Suleiman-bin-Seif El Riyamee assisted by the Nizari Arabs of Zikki. The Wali of the Fort, Shaikh Saeed -bin-Sultan El Ameyree, was expelled, and Suleiman-bin-Seif being unopposed advanced on Zikki, taking possession of the principal roads leading to that place. Sayyid Turki on hearing of these events at once despatched Sayyid Hamood -bin-Nasir to reinforce the garrison at Zikki. Sayyid Hamood, however, was too late and was obliged to retire to Semail, leav- ing Shaikh Suleiman in possession of the town of Zikki and in preparation to attack the fort. 831. More effective, however, was the apprehension of three Nizar Shaikhs who happened to be at Maskat at the time, an act which Suleiman-bin-Seif cleverly tried to turn to his own account by imputing to it the cause for his advance on Zikki. On the release of one of the Shaikhs, Sayyid Nasir-bin-Mu- hammad, Shaikh Suleiman retired from Zikki. 832. Notwithstanding the disloyal and rebellious nature of Shaikh Sulei man's conduct, he was pardoned by the Sultan on pleading the oppression exer cised by the Wali of Birket El Moze upon the widow and sons of Sayyid Muhammad-bin-Hillal as his excuse for .the aggression. The incident forms a good example of the leniency of Sayyid Turki's rule. 833. Supply of garrison guns to His Highness the Sultan —The guns in Forts Merani and Jellali being useless for defensive purposes, Sayyid Turki requested to be supplied hy the British Government with twelve 12- pounder guns on payment. Resident, Persian Gulf, to Government ^.3^ The Government of India, at the suggestion 1887. ^ V 139 ' dat d 1 Iu of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, sanctioned the Government of India to Resident, SU pply of the ^UllS frOIU India with the neCCSSarV Persian Gulf, No. 1644,-E., dated 11 th 1 K ^ , 0 ... ,. August 1887. carnages and ammunition gratis. (Exti. A, Nov. 1887, Nos. 17-24.) 835. Capture of Suweikby Sayyid Ibrahim-bin-Keis.—Eollowing closely on the capture of Birket Jil Moze, and while matters were in the un satisfactory condition brought about by that event, news arrived that Suweik had been surprised and taken by Sayyid Ibrahim-bin-Keis. This was an affair of much greater importance than the former, inasmuch as it formed the prelude to a general and concerted plan of coalition and rebellion against the ruling power, among the Hinawi tribes under the leadership of Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali. This rebel, encouraged by Shaikh Suleiman's success, opened a correspondence with that Chief and endeavoured to win him over to the Hinawi cause, while it was hoped that blows could be struck at several places along the line simultaneously. 836. Sayyid Turki, on hearing of the fall of Suweik, at once requested the assistance of a British man-of-war and asked that fire might be opened against Sayyid Ibrahim's force. 192ft % 837. Dr. Jayakar, Agency Surgeon, who then happened to be in tern- porary charge of the Agency, did not feel justified in acceding to this demand and telegraphed to the Resident at Bushire. He further requested Her Majesty's Ship Banger to proceed to Suweik to remove British subjects, a course in which Sayyid Ibrahim himself afforded great assistance. 838. Colonel Ross telegraphed to the Government of India for permission to render armed assistance if found necessary. The Government of India replied that they were reluctant to engage in active operations on the Batineh Coast, but authorised the Resident to adopt such measures as appeared to him desirable. 839. Colonel Ross accordingly, accompanied by Colonel Mockler, Political Agent, went to Maskat in Her Majesty's I. M. Ship Lawrence and interviewed the Sultan, who had made but feeble preparations to eject Sayyid Ibrahim himself, though he was extremely anxious that the British Government should employ active force to that end. He was, however, persuaded that mediation would, if successful, be better than force, and deputed his Wazeer Sayyid Saeed to accompany Colonel Ross to Suweik. His Highness also agreed to restore to Ibrahim the allowance of $100 per mensem if he retired peaceably, on condition of holding aloof in the future from dissension and rebellion. At Suweik Colonels Ross and Mockler had an interview with Sayyid Ibrahim, who explained that his motive in seizing Suweik had been to relieve the inhabitants at their own request of the tyranny of Sayyid Turki's people Colonel Ross replied that he did not consider Sayyid Ibrahim responsible for Sayyid Turki's administration, and in view' of the friendly relations between the Sultan and the British Government, the latter could not see with indifference any re bellious attempts against the authority of the former. He added, that if Sayyid Ibrahim would not withdraw peacefully, active interference from the British Government would become necessary. ■ Sayyid Ibrahim finding his position awkward replied that he was unaware that such strong support would be given to Sayyid Turki, and promised to withdraw from the situation. 111 ■ 840. The force with Sayyid Ibrahim on this occasion was seen to be very small, consisting of 200 or 300 men at most and his own following from Rostak. The Yal Sad tribe of the Batineh had invited him to come, but their principal Shaikhs had afterwards drawn off. Sayyid Ibrahim washed to make conditions with the Resident before evacuating Suweik, but he was informed that he should treat with the Sultan's Wazir; he was eventually permitted to leave the place on the evening of 12th July, and Suweik was again garrisoned by the Sultan's troops, which had in the meanwhile arrived from Maskat. 841. The Government of India approved of Colonel Ross' proceedings in „ T ^ this matter, and there is no doubt that the prompt Government or India, to Resiaent, , 1 j- n t i i i n • i ix&gt; , •Persian Gulf, No. 1835-E., dated 8th demonstration or our policy had a beneticial eliect, September 1887. , for news of the collapse of the Hinawi coalition (Extl. A, Nov. 1887, Nos. 25-31.) i ^ i . i 0.1 m i o i i was shortly arterwards received, and Shaikh Saleh, its chief promoter, with his usual fickleness, wrote to the Sultan with offers of co-operation against his enemies. 842. Assault on Banians at Soor .--On 25th July Her Majesty's Ship Banger arrived at Maskat with two Banians on board. These persons com plained that the Awlad Kassib had carried off one of their community at Soor and severely beaten another, and could assign no reason for the outrage. Sayyid Turki, on the matter being represented to him, at once wrote to the Wali of Soor to enquire into the case and punish the offenders. Shaikhs Abdulla- bin-Salim and Muhammad-bin-Majid of the Beni-bu-Ali had however already of their own accord restored the kidnapped Banian and imprisoned five of the Awlad Kassib. 843. Intertribal disturbances and minor occurrences in 1887 — Minor matters are thus alluded to in the Maskat Administration Reports : — 'In February the S. S. Sultanee was sent to Sohar with gunpowder and money, a raid by the Bedouins being- reported by the Wali as impending. ' Rear-Admiral Sir F. Richards, Commander-in-Chief, Indian Station, visited Maskatiu April in Her Majesty's Ship Sphinx on his way up to the Persian Gulf, and called again in 193May when returning. His Excellency also visited Maskat in Her Majesty's Ship Bacchante in November on his way from Aden to Bombay. ' In April an attack was made by Zaeed-bin-Khalifa on a section of the Dhowahir tribe at Berevmi for attempting: to throw off their allegiance to him. The Sultan to prevent the Beni Ya* from beino- established in power at Bereymi sent the Dhowahir assistance in the shape of monev and ammunition, but unfortunately the Dar-as-Salam, which earned it, arrived too late at Sohar to thwart Zaeed in his object, and he succeeded in carrying off two of the Dhowahir Shaikhs as prisoners to Abj. Dhabbi. ' His Highess Sayyid Turki, who had lately suffered a good deal from one of his old complaints, left on 13th November for Gwadur and returned on 2nd December having some what benefited by the change.' 844. Position of affairs on 1st January 1888 —The commencement of the year*was marked by trouble at Dhofar, which distant possession bad been a constant source of anxiety and expense to the Sultan. On this occasion the Akeed of the fort, on attempting to arrest a murderer, had been attacked by the inhabitants of the town and obliged to retire within the citadel. 845. Sayyid Turki at once despatched a force of 200 men in his steamer the Sultanee, under the command of his sons Sayyids Eeysal and Fahd to the Akeed's rescue. On arrival, however, it was found that matteis had already settled themselves and assumed a peaceful aspect. Five Shaikhs, ringleaders of the disloyal party, were seized and brought eventually to Maskat for punish ment. 846. Continued absence of the ' Sultanee ' and despatch of Her Maiesty's Ship ' Turquoise' in Search— The Sultanee remained absent so long on the expedition mentioned in the previous paragnph that His Highness Sayyid Turki became exceedingly anxious regarding her fate and that of his two sons who were on board. He accordingly requested the Political Agent to be good enough to arrange that Her Majesty's Ship Turquoise, which was then in the harbour, might go in search of her. 847. Captain Brackenbury, in command of the Turquoise, kindly complied with this request. The Sultanee was found lying off Has Madraka without coals and without provisions. After affording the necessary assistance, Sayyids Feysal and Fahd were taken on board the Turquoise and brought back to Maskat, where great rejoicings were held in honour of their safe return. Sayyid Turki also wrote a very cordial letter of thanks for the timely help afforded him. 848. Political Agent —On 26th February Colonel Mockler proceeded to Bagdad on special duty, and Dr. Jayakar assumed charge of the Political Agency and Consulate. 849. Visit of His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar.—On the 4th March His Highness Sayyid Bargash-bin-Saeed, Sultan of Zanzibar, arrived at Maskat in his steamer the Nyanza with the intention of visiting the hot springs at Bosher, a town about 16 miles from Maskat, for the sake of his health. His Highness Sayyid Turki accompanied by his sons proceeded on board as soon as the Nyanza had anchored. Sayyid Bargash could not be induced to land at Maskat, but a salute of 21 guns was nevertheless fired in his honour by Sayyid Turki. The following day the Nyanza sailed for Gobra, a small town a few miles north of Maskat, where Sayyid Bargash disembarked. Sayyid Turki paid his brother a second visit at Bosher, and appears in every way to have treated him with great respect and kindness, in return for which Sayyid Bargash made him a present of ^50,000. After spending a week at Bosher, Sayyid Bargash returned to his vessel, when a salute of 101 guns was fired in his honour, and on 17th March left for Zanzibar. His trip so far from doing him good probably shortened his life, for he only survived his return to Zanzibar a few hours. 850. Removal of Sayyid Saeed-bin-Muhammad from the post of Wazser. —On 5th May Sayyid Turki informed Dr. Jayakar by letter that he had dismissed Sayyid Saeed from the post of Wazeer, saying that Maskat was 194195 14° so« fkilil r. too small a town to be in need of one. The Resident in the Persian Gulf, on Resident, Persian Gulf, to the Politic- hearing of this, directed Dr. Javakar to submit a cal Agent, No. 33, dated 15th May 1888. fiill ™ +1,^ V.' ^ tsUUmit d- Not traceable, but see External a , ^ 1 report on the subject, and desired to be m- Jnne 1888, Nos. 83-86. lOrmed What arrangements have been made or are contemplated, providing for the interchange of verbal confidential communications hitherto so frequently passing through Sayyld Saeed.' 851. Dr. Jayakar reported that His Highness Sayyid Turki attributed his long continued ill-health to sorcery or magic, and suspected his Wazeer of exert ing some evil influence oyer him. The Wazeer, on the other hand, went in fear of his life, though bayyid Turki declared he had no intention of harming him. The loss of Nezwa and the ill-feeling existing between the Sultan's three sons were also attributed by Sayyid Turki to the intrigues of his Wazeer, and the feeling of bitterness and hatred had been growing in the Sultan's mind for some time past. The report goes on to say that the relations became so strained that Sayyid Saeed was compelled to retire from Maskat. He left for the island of Kishm in a native boat. Sayyid Turki promised to appoint some confiden tial person to replace Sayyid Saeed. The following is the text of a message sent by Dr. Jayakar to the Sultan regarding Sayyid Saeed : — ' Sayyid Saeed informs me that Your Highness has taken a great dislike to him lately, and that he fears his life is in danger in consequence. Although I have assured Sayyid Saeed that his fear is groundless, and although I tully believe that Your Highness will not commit any rash act such as is apprehended by Sayyid Saeed, still I think it only right as a friend and a servant of Government to inform Your Highness, that should such an act be committed. Your Highnesses conduct will be looked upon with great displeasure both by Colonel Ross and the Government/^ 862. Dr. Jayakar also offered to mediate in the matter, but without success. # 853. Bad health Of the Sultan —Sayyid Turki's condition, which had for some time been feeble, became critical in May, and on 16th of that month the following telegram was sent by Dr. Jayakar to the Resident— ' Sultan is dangerously ill, not expected to recover. If he dies, it is expected that there will be an immediate struggle for power between sons and other complications afterwards. 'What am I to do in regard to sons until further orders can be received from you. w 864. Colonel Ross replied by telegram :— ' In event of fatal termination confine action to arranging safety British subjects and property. You should avoid interference on behalf of any aspirant/' 855. Colonel Ross himself arrived at Maskat shortly afterwards in Her Resident, Persian Gulf, to Govern- Majesty's Ship Kingfisher, and had an interview May t i 0 8 f 88 India ' No 166 ' dated 29th the Sultan. In the course of a report to (Exti. a, june 1888, Nos. 445-450.) Government regarding his visit, he remarked-— ' His Highness expressed himself chiefly anxious for the safety and welfare of his eldest son Sayyid Muhammad in case of his own death occurring. His Highness said that the two younger sons would in that event combine against the eldest, and he was desirous of providing beforehand for the latter by sending him as Governor to Gwadur, and His Highness requested that Sayyid Muhammad might continue after His Highnesses death to hold Gwadur indepen dently, supporting himself from its revenues. He remarked that Sayyid Muhammad would be content with this provision, and that Maskat (meaning Oman) would suffice for the younger sons. I might have told Sayyid Turki at once that the scheme was impracticable and one that I could not recommend the Government of India to entertain, but I perceived that His Highnesses mind was very much bent on this project, and I apprehended that an unfavourable reply might affect his health.' 856. After a stay of two days Colonel Ross returned to Bushire, the Sultan's health being no worse. 857. Death of Sayyid Turki and assumption of power by Sayyid FeysaL —The Sultan did not last long after Colonel Ross' visit. He died on the 3rd June, his condition having slowly but surely gone from bad to worse. Dr. Jayakar reported as follows :— ' The late Sultan had been suffering from chyluria for many years, and although for a long Political Agent, to Resident, Persian time the disease was in abeyance, the last i elapse, which Gulf, No. 177, dated 10th June 1888. proved to be a continuous and serious one, came on about a (Extl. A, July 1888, Nos. 387-403.) year ago. He never recovered from this attack, and about the end of April, owing to the great weakness caused by the disease, he had to take to his bed/' ■858. Sayyid Feysal, the second son, at once assumed power and wrote to Dr. Jayakar, hoping that the friendship which existed between the British Government and his father might be maintained in regard to him. 869. Sayyid Turki's funeral was attended a short distance by Dr. Jayakar and the Agency Office establishment. Her Majesty's Ship Turquoise also fired a salute from 4-30 p.m . to sunset. The flags of the British and American Consulates and of Her Majesty's Ship Turquoue were hoisted half-mast for four days. 860. On the Sultan's death British Indian subjects were ordered to remove their valuables to vessels in harbour, and the marine Battalion Guard was posted in the Agency compound. Ail, however, passed off quietly and there was no disturbance whatever. Sayyid Eeysal's first act was to write to all the import ant Shaikhs, announcing his assumption of power, and to strengthen the garri sons of the passes leading into Maskat. Most of the Shaikhs replied in a spirit of loyalty, and even the treacherous Shaikh Saleh wrote in friendly terms. 861. Character Of Sayyid Turki.— Colonel Ross in his Annual Admin istration Report for 1888-89 thus describes Sayyid Turki's character :— a The death of Sayyid Turki is felt to be a misfortune to Oman; for although his rule was by no means vigorous, he was well skilled in managing Arabs, and usually mild and liberal. His loyalty to the British Government was sincere and unswerving. Whatever his vacillations in other matters, from this policy he never departed, viz., full trust in and devotion to the British power. This well-known loyalty was recognised by Her Majesty conferring on His Highness in 1886 the Grand Cross of the Star of India, and at the same time the British Gov ernment undertook to afford him active support during his lifetime in case of insurrections and attacks on Maskat. This announcement ensured the maintenance of peace at Maskat so long as Sayyid Turki should continue to reign, and makes his loss the more felt. During his later years Sayyid Turki suffered much from ill-health, and his sufferings, impairing his mind and judgment, rendered him prone to superstition, and the painful suspicions arising therefrom embittered his last days.' 862. Visit of Resident in the Persian Gulf,— On hearing of Sayyid Turki's death, Colonel Ross again visited Maskat and conveyed the condolences of Her Majesty and His Excellency the Viceroy to his family. 863. Zanzibar Subsidy. —In his report of this visit to Government Colo nel Ross said :— ' The question of the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy being of immediate importance, I No. 199, dated 20th June 1888. have submitted it by telegram. Dr. Jayakar was much of (Extl. A, July 1888, Nog. 387-403.) opinion that Sayyid Feysal could not well carry on the ad ministration of Maskat without this pecuniary aid, and it 8eems necessary (or British interests that the de facto Government should be strong enough to maintain good order in Maskat and Mattrah; I have therefore recommended payment of the monthly instalments to Sayyid Feysal.' 864. Eeturn of Sayyid Saeed, ex-Wazeer, to Maskat.— Sayyid Saeed, who had been living at Bander Abbas, on hearing of Sayyid Turki's death, at once returned to Maskat. On landing he was met by Sayyid Fahad, who demanded in Sayyid Eeysal's name his reasons for returning without permission and ordered him to remain a prisoner in his own house till Sayyid Eeysal's pleasure were known His Highness decided that Sayyid Saeed's presence in Maskat was inimical to the general peace and to the chances of friendly rela tions between himself and his brothers.- He was accordingly banished once more from Maskat and retired to Bander Abbass, from which place he shortly afterwards wrote to the Resident, requesting that steps might be taken to pre vent the confiscation of his property in Maskat. 865. Colonel Ross in forwarding copy of Sayvid Saeed's letter to the Poli tical Agent, said 1 think that the writer has claims to our good offices in the way of preventing any conhscation of his property in Oman.' Feysal subsequently promised the Political Agent that no naim should befall Sayyid Saeed's property as far as he was concerned. ^GsitiGii of affairs a month after Sayyid Turki's death—Dr • ^reported as follows to the Resident iust a month after the death of Sayyid Turki:— J 19615 ^ 197 % HL &lt; ' ^ iidil, H.

Sayyids Abdul Azeez and Ibrahim-bin-Keis write requesting to be informed of the policy of Government towards Sayyid reysal.— feayyias Abdul Azeez and Ibrahim-bin-Keis wished to put an end to this un certainty, and wrote asking whether the British Government would support S a yyid Feysal in the same manner as his father. Colonel Ross, in a letter to Sayyid Abdul Azeez, wrote in the following guarded terms :— i The interests of Government are chiefly concerned with the maintenance of tranquillity and prosperity of the people under rulers of their own choice, and it would be in accordance with my instructions toco-operate in any manner in my power to promote these objects.' 870. Political Agent , —Colonel Mockler resumed charge of the Political Agency and Consulate on 6th July. 871. Proposal to levy ' Zekat on produce from interior. — About the middle of July Sayyid Feysal proposed to levy 'Zekat' or a tax on pro duce arriving at the coast from the interior. The proposal however was vetoed by the Political Agent as being contrary to treaty stipulations. Ros- give Sayyid Ibrahim's first act of hostility since the late Sultan's death and of the retaliatory expedition undertaken by His Highness Sayyid Eeysal in person against Rostak, Sayyid Ibrahim's strong hold, which, as will be seen, turned out a complete fiasco:— ts News had been received that Sayyid Ibrahim-bin-Keis was on the point of starting to seize Awabee. Sayyid Peysal wrote to the Ibriyeen to defend Awabee and to the Wali of Nakhl to give any assistance in his power. 873. 'The Ibriyeen, however, had been gained over by Ibrahim-bin-Keis and remained aloof from the struggle. Awabee fell on 2ud September after a stout resistance, in which the son of the Akeed, Ali-bin-Seif El Ibree, was killed. 874. 'On hearing of this, Sayyid Feysal determined on an expedition against Rostak, the .stronghold of Sayyid Ibrahim, and wrote to the tribes to assemble at Burkah. War material was despatched in the Dar-as-Salam ander Sayyid Hamad bin Nasir and an escort of Arabs to reinforce the garrison at Burkah. Sayyid Ibrahim had written by this time to explain his seizure of Awabee. He stated that the inhabitants had asked him to expel the Governor for his oppression towards them, and as he considered Awabee to be one of his own forts, he had acceded. It seems that Awabee had originally been held in his interests by the Ibriyeen, who had afterwards delivered it over to the late Sultan. 875. 'On the 18th September, accordingly, His Highness started for Burkah in his steamer the Sultame, accompanied' by his brother Sayyid Muhammad, Shaikh Tahnoon-bin- Za'eed-bin-Khalifah of Abu-Dhabbi and all the principal Al-bu-Sa'eedees of Maskat, except Sayyids Hilal and Muhammad-bin-Azan. 876. The expedition, however, proved a failure. Almost from the first there was defec tion in Sayyid Feysal's army, the Chiefs with him preferring to try and arrange a peace between him and Sayyid Ibrahim to fighting. Want of money to pay the troops further operated to this end. It appears that on landing at Burkah, His Highness proceeded to Waseyl near Rostak, where the people of the surrounding country tendered their submission tp him. A fight took place between the two forces, which resulted in Sayyid Feysal establishing himself in the Mizarse bastion, after which he proceeded to shell the fort of kostak. The Yal Sad tribe had in the meantime risen and were attacking Sayyid FeysaFs line of communications with the sea. This led to a request that Her Majesty's Ship Turquoise might be sent to the Batineh Coast to make a counter-demonstration, which, however, was not acceded to. 877. ' The Sultan's army now became completely disaffected, refusing to fight any longer, and Sayyid Peysal was compelled to make peace. His Highness returned to Maskat on 17th October, after a fruitless absence of a month, and Awabee remained in the hands of Sayyid Ibrahim, to whom also hopes appear to have been held out for the renewal of the subsidyem'oyed by him during Sayyid Turki's lifetime. In December the Yal Sad, who rose against Sayyid Feysal during the Rostak expedition, sent messengers to Maskat to ask pardon for their action. His Highness accepted the apology and pardoned the tribe. 878. Character of His Highness Sayyid Feysal— The following was Colonel Mockler's opinion of Sayyid Peysal's character at this early period of his rule- ' I regret to say that little reliance can be placed on anything Sayyid Feysal says. He is at present entirely in the hands of his writers and one or two Banians connected with the Political Agent, to Resident, Persian customs, who play upon his vanity and youth. He rarely Gulf, No. 600- A. —1, dated 4tli Nov- moves outside the palace precincts himself, and his staff ember 1888. of writers and other intimates care for nothing except what (Extl. A, Jan. 1889, Nos. 31-32.) they can get out of him/' 879. Inter-tribal disturbances and minor events in 1888.—Minor events are noted as follows in the Administration Reports of the Maskat Agency : - ' In April an affray took place between the Hikman and Yal Bede tribes near Barkah. regarding an old boundary dispute, in which six lives were lost. Peace was speedily restored between the two tribes by a deputation sent from Maskat by His Highness the Sultan. ' A demonstration was also made by Shaikh Hilal-bin-Zahir at the head of 500 men against Manh, but the fort being well guarded, the expedition failed, and Shaikh Hilal returned to Nezwa without having attained any political object. ' Reports from Sohar stated that the Shahook and Nakbieen tribes, whilst on their way to attack the forts of Dibba and Kore Fakhan, were opposed by the Sharkieen and Sultan-bin- Muhammad ; the encounter resulting in the death of 13 men of the Sharkieen. ' In July four Banians arrived from Barkah with a complaint that they had been assaulted by a party of the Beni Jabir whilst drawing water at Barkah. The case was represented to His Highness, and an enquiry resulted in the imprisonment at Maskat of the ringleaders of the offending party. ' Fighting again occurred at Barkah between the Yal Bede and Hikman tribes in which 6 men on each side were killed. A fight also took place in the Wades Ghafir and Sahtan between the Ghafiri tribes, Meyayihah and Ibriyeen, in which some 50 men were killed and an equal number taken prisoners. . Peace was restored by the mediation of Sayyid Ibrahim-bin- Keis of Rostak. ' Reports were received in Maskat during the month (December) of a contemplated rising of the Nejdean tribes against Oman, The expedition was to be conducted by Ibn Rasheed in conjunction with Sheikh Jasim -bin -Thani of El Bidaa and to be on a larger scale than any thing hitherto attempted. Nothing however occurred to disturb the general tranquillity of the province.' Buseire, The 15th December (Sd.) W. S tratton, Lieut., First Assistant Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Exd.— \v. G.

Sultan Sayyid Feysal, the second son of His Highness Ravvid Turki, had maintained firm hold over Maskat, and the Political Agent reported that there were no rumours afloat of any contemplated movements. Extl. B, Feb. 1889, 881. Settlement of the question of the alienation of real property 2 ' J ' 33 ' in the Khojah Tort at Mattrah.- A question had arisen at the end of the previous year regarding the sale of a small plot of land by His Highness the ^ bultan in the Khojah iort at Mattrah. The case was looked upon as an important one because it involved a principle in which the whole Khoiah community were directly interested. As regards the claim of the Khojahs to the plot in question the Political Agent wrote as follows :— Extl. B, Feb. 1889, ' From an enquiry I have made with the oldest residents of the Khojah Fort, it appears NOS 'No'27 Vide t0 me that a wal1 was briilt round the Kll0 i ah quarter so as to give it the necessary defensive protection and appearance of a fort in the reign of the Imam Sayyid Ahmad-bin-Saud, the founder of the Ahbu-Sandee dynasty, who ruled between 1744 and 1783 A.D. with the consent and permission of that ruler; that before that' period it contained in addition to Khojah houses several others belonging to members of other Indian communities, which were evidently purchased at the time of the erection of the wall from their owners by the Khojah Jamah or individual members, so as to make it exclusively a Khojah fort, or quarter; that the conditions requiring the necessity of a protective or defensive wall, namely, the danger of an attack from the interior in the absence of a wall to the town of Mattrah itself and the piratical tendency of the Jowasim having passed away, the fort wall has been gradually, since the days of Sayyid Saud-bin-Sultan, built upon, so that it has now entirely lost its fortified appearance although the quarter still remains exclusively a Khojah one; and that since its conversion into a purely Khojah quarter no ruler of Maskat has alleged a claim to any vacant pieee of ground within the enclosure or disputed the right of ownership of the Khojah Jamah to any such piece,' ' His Highness Sayyid Feysal based his claim to the piece of ground on the fact that his father, the late Sayyid Turki, had attempted to sell it about a year before his death. It appears, however, that the late Sultan relinquished his idea of selling it, on its being represented that he had no right to the land in question.' 882. His Highness Sayyid Eeysal after some correspondence wrote to the Political Agent as follows :— ' We have to inform you that we have given up all contention in the matter of the piece of ground in the Khojah Fort out of respect and regard for the British Government.' 883. Navigation of the Sur creek.— Sayyid Badr-bin-Saif reported that the Beni-bu-Ali of Aikeh had agreed to allow the passage of the creek at Sur to remain entirely in the hands of His Highness's officers and to abide by the decision of the Sultan in all local matters. Ex L A si F 9 t-.L 8 f' 884. Rumoured movement of Sayyid Abdul Aziz against the Ger- ao.gi w e mans in East Africa and suggested reconciliation with the Sultan of Maskat. —On the 7th January the Political Eesi- ary 1889.^ dated 1Bush]^e, 7th Jaim ' dent submitted to the Government of India copies of correspondence that had passed between Shaikh Salih-bin-Ali and Jumah-bin-Saeed on the one hand and the Sultan, Sayyid Feysal, on the other. The Shaikhs in their letters put forward two propositions: Firstly, that the Sultan .should despatch his uncle, Sayyid Abdul Aziz, to the East Coast of Africa against the Germans. Secondly, that the Sultan should make a peaceful settlement with his uncle. The Shaikhs suggested that ' the officers of the British Government' might be consulted in the matter. (Cf. also paras, 888-891.) 885, Refusal of His Highness to move against German East Wo. 94. Africa» —The Sultan gave explicit replies on both points. As regards the expedition to East Africa, he wrote:— ' We do not see any way to entertain that proposal at all.' 1exti a^feb.j889, ggg. Conditions of reconciliation with Sayyid Abdul Aziz pro- ''' posed by His Highness the Sultan— With reference to the proposed recou- ciiiation His Highness wrote « As to the proposals regarding making peace between ourselves and our uncle Abdul Aziz wbat you advise we accept and do not dislike it, but we are of opinion that the peace between us will not remain permanent and continuous while he lives in Oman * * * * &lt; But if he accepts the condition oE removing from Oman to India under the supervision of the Great Government, he will get a subsidy from us, on this condition only through the medium of the (English) Government, and without that condition he will never get it from us/' The attempt at reconciliation ended in failure. (Cf. also para, 892.) G 1ios a 78 j 98 ) e Jr 9, 887. Political Agent.— On 31st March Lieutenant Stratton took over ko. ss a . charge of the Maskat Political Agency and Consulate. li!!' 888. Eeported intention of Sayyid Abdul Aziz to seize the Is- - No. 547. j an( j 0 f Pemba-—'Towards the end of January 1889 the Sultan of Zanzibar Foreign Depart.ent, si.nia, No. had be f m to ^ ^nously alarmed at a consistently 841-k., dated 27th April 1889, to current report that his brother Sayyid Abdul Aziz Resident, Persian Guif. wag preparing to seize Pemba and had been invited by the Maskari Arabs of that island to come there for that purpose. At the request of the Sultan of Zanzibar Her Majesty's Agent and Consul-General Zanzibar, made enquiries regarding the matter from the Government of India' and was informed that it was not true. lide* 889. Colonel Euan Smith in his letter to Lord Salisbury, dated Zanzibar, No. 546. 26th January, wrote as follows ;—• ' At His Highness's request I made enquiries regarding this from the Government of India and received a reply that the report was not true. The Sultan has also summoned thirty-one of the principal Maskari Arabs and they have denied any knowledge of the matter. To-day however, the Prime Minister of the Sultan of Maskat, who has been here for some months on a mission from his master, called upon me to take leave before hi&amp; return to Maskat. He in formed me that the report was certainly true, that the matter had been talked of before he left Maskat some months ago, and that the Maskari Arabs had sent some sort of invitation to. Sayyid Abdul Aziz who had promised to remit the whole of the clove tax should he be' successful/' ^ . 89() ' In his report to the Government of India on the subject the Political No. 176. Resident discredits the story :— ' 1 hese rumours seem to have been circulated by interested persons with an object.

It is a priori improv able that a man of Sayyid Abdul Aziz^s experience would risk almost certain capture and imprisonment on such a^ venture. Sayyid Feysal, the de facto Sultan of Maskat, has not hitherto appointed any W azir or Minister, and I would suggest a reference to Her Majesty's Agent at Zanzibar to ascertain who the person alluded to is.'' E nos . in-m, S' Later on Colonel Ross reported to the Government of India that the No. 177.' No ' ^ dated Bushire, the 7th person referred to by Colonel Euan Smith as the iTTi t,- t Prime Minister of the Sultan of Maskat was pro bably Ali-bm-Jumah who had been sent in November 1888 with presents for the Sultan of Zanzibar.

TT . ^ ^ilure of attempts to effect a reconciliation between His No. 43. xlighness the Sultan and Sayyid Abdul Aziz. —On 16th May Shaikh fealih-bin-Ali al Harthi informed the Sultan that he had made several endea- \oinfe to induce Sayyid Abdul Aziz to come to an understanding with His Highness but Lad failed, (cy. also paras. 886 and 899-901.) , 8 ® 3 Appointment of a Wazir by His Highness the Snltan -On *0.173. i7th A ay the Political Agent reported that His Highness Sayyid Peysal had hdential Ministe ■ a ^ )0 ^ ment -Muhammad -bin- Azan as Wazir and Con- 200Serious fire at IVtattrah.— On 24th May a serious fire broke iso. 4o. out at Mattrah among the date leaf huts owing to carelessness with regard to cooking arrangements made m one of them. Seven women and two children were reported to have lost their lives in the fire. T ^11 I Persian Governor of Kishm to Maskat —On 17th June Shaikh Hassan-am-Abdullah, the Persian Governor of Kishm, visited Maskat with the object of establishing an agency there for the reception of all salt, etc., exported irom his district. He wanted to compel all persons trading thence to convey their salt to a particular banian of Maskat, the latter ot course paying for the privilege of being sole consignee. He failed however in his negotiations. T , 8 T ? 6 ' I)e , atil ? f His Highness Sayyid Peysal's eldest son .-On 12th No.438. July His Highness s eldest son, a boy of three years old, died. He had long been weak and sickly. Suitable messages of condolence were sent to the Sultan. ^No ^ia &amp;i 889 ' designs of Sayyid Abdul [Aziz against Maskat.— On 17th vide No. 439. July a messenger from Sayyid Abdul Aziz arrived at Maskat with letters for the Resident and the Political Agent. In these he stated that he was about to march against M.askat, and that he had been joined by Peysal-bin-Mahmud and Ibrahim-bin-Kais, and asked for the support of the Government. He in formed the Political Agent he would duly warn him when ready for the attack. The Resident did not reply to his letter. E Nos u S; S 9 ' ^ arm Mattrah.— On the 2nd August a deputation of Khojahs No. 143. from Mattrah waited on the Political Agent with a request that arrangements might be made for their safety. On receipt of a telegram from Maskat, Colonel Ross requested Commander Baldero, R.N., to proceed there with H. M. S. Sphinx for the protection of British interests and the support of the Political Agent. E Koimai6,S 9 ' 899 * Advance of Sayyid Abdul Aziz on Maskat and bis repulse No. 146. at the Kahza Pass.— Prequent rumours had been current from time to time of Sayyid Abdul Aziz's designs against Maskat, but he had been as yet unable No. ivs, Political Agent to Resident, to efTcct any serious coalition of the tribes against Maskat, dated 8th August 1889. ^ The close Of July, hoWCVCr, Saw SOme development of Sayyid Abdul Aziz's plots. Following closely in his letters to the Resident and the Political Agent he commenced his advance on the capital. 900. The Political Agent wrote tbe following report ce Sayyid Abdul Aziz left Semail with his force on or about the 29th ultimo (July), with the intention of advancing: against Maskat. On the 30th July the Kahza Pass was attacked by tbe enemy j but the defenders, 600 in number, beat them off. No regular attempt seems to have been made via the Ak Pass. After his reverse at the Kahza, Sayyid Abdul Aziz fell back on Samad ***** It is stated that his force is broken up * * * * . There was some excitement at the near approach of Sayjid Abdul Aziz at Mattrah, but no feeling of alarm was expressed in Maskat/' 901. His Highness sent an intimation of his victory to the Political Resident. In replying Colonel Ross wrote:— a The success will, I have no doubt, strengthen Your Highnesses Government, and, I hope, tend to a permanent state of tranquillity in Oman/' (C/« also^&gt;«r«g. 892 and 909-913.) ^.octm 902. Correspondence with the Sultan regarding deserters from -J Maskat vessels at Calcutta'— On 3rd September a letter was forwarded from 201His Higlmess Sayyid Teysal saying that the masters of Maskat vessels, which proceeded every year to Calcutta, had been laying complaints before him that their Khallassis were used to desert them at Calcutta and that these desertions caused great difficulties. 903. The Political Agent was instructed to inform His Highness that , masters of Maskat vessels should, on des- No. 194, dated Businre, ion) beptem er 1 . er ti ons occurring, apply to the Magistrates of Calcutta and in such cases as the laws of British India provide for, they would get redress. Exti. a , Feb. iggo, 904. Sale of the Customs Farm at Maskat.— The old contract having Nos. eX pi r ed on the 2nd December, His Highness Sayyid Peysal resold the Customs Farm at Maskat for the ensuing year for $111,000, being an advUnce of $1,000 on the previous year.

In September information was received that seven fresh African slaves had been imported to Lingah from Soor * * * The Maskat Agency Report says— ' There were no seizures of slave dhows during the year. The number of fugitive slaves that sought freedom at the Consulate during the year was 51, of whom 35 have been liberated under treaty stipulations of 1873 and 16 were dismissed.' 907. Intertribal disturbances and minor occurrences in 1889.— Tribal differences are thus noted in the Administration Report and Political Diaries:— ' 16th March. —A letter has been received from Rashid bin Aziz giving the news that Sulaiman bin Saifar Riyamee having attacked the Awamir at Hadeirah had to retreat with a loss of 6 killed and 18 wounded. The loss on the part of the Awamir is reported to be only 4 killed and 6 wounded. 18th May. —News was received of a fight at Soor between the Beni bu Ali and the Jenibeh. Cause of quarrel unknown. Three of the Beni bu Ali reported killed and 6 wounded, u 12th September.—News has been received of a raid having been committed on the A1 Saad tribe probably by the Beni Grhafir who are reported to have carried away 30 camels and wounded one of the men of the former tribe. ' 24th December. —* * . The Political Agent reported an affray having taken place in the Dahireh between the Beni Kalban and the Nairn on the one side and the Beni Ali on the^ other, in consequence of the latter having some time back waylaid a party of the Beni Kalban and killed 8 of them.

On -Oth January, the Sultan received information that Sayyid Ahdul Aziz had got through the Wadi Sakhan in the Beni Buaheh country, and had arrived at Fanjah, and that next day he had been joined by Shaikh Mamud-bin-Said and the sons of the late Imam Azan, and that the day follow- mg they had arrived at Sib. r an 11 ' His Highness Sayyid Feysal and Sayyid Fahad sailed lor oib on board the Sultanee with the idea of advancing on it hv land and sea, Sayyid Fahad being dropped en route at Al Wateyah. But Sayyid Abdul Aziz did not await their arrival and the Sultan returned to Maskat. On the 31st Sayyid Fahad reported his arrival at Falaj and that Savvid Abdul Aziz had moved further west. , Early next month Sayyid Fahad sent word that all was quiet on the Batinah Coast and that Abdul Aziz and Shaikh Hamud were at Rostak. News was brought the same day that Sayyid Abdul Aziz was sick with fever. 913. By March Sayyid Abdul Aziz had apparently abandoned all designs against the Sultan. For on the 7th of that month His Highness received a report that he intended going to Abu Dthabi, and on the 31st Sayyid Abdul A ziz wrote to Shaikh Saleh bin Ali to say he was about to pay a visit to Zaid bin Khalifah of that place. A week later the Minister called on the Political A gent to say that all was now quiet in Oman. (Of. also paras. 892 and 956-960.) Extl. A, Ang. 1890, Nos. 84-88, vide No. 85, Extl.

And he asked for information whether there were any agreements with the Portuguese Government to the effect and by what rule the subjects of the latter power were given the advantages of British protection in foreign ports. He further requested information regarding the entertainment of Goanese subjects in Government offices. 915. The Political Eesident replied :— ' I know of no regulations under which Natives of Goa are entitled to reg-istratioo as subjects of a protected State. I thiuk the protection extended to them in foreign territory is from usage and from the fact that they are Christians and subjects of a power which has no consular or other representatives in these parts, and in abseuce of special arrangements they naturally look to us for protection, and their claim to this and our right to extend pro tection when considered desirable has never that I know been questioned.'

But I am to observe that such Goanese as are subjects of Portugal do not come within the scope of the agreement with the Sultan of Maskat in regard to jurisdiction over the subjects of Native Indian States, and that if in the absence of any representatives of Portu guese authority protection is claimed by subjects of that power it can only be extended as a matter of comity and cannot be insisted on as a matter of right if called in question by a competent authority. Regarding the employment of aliens in the service of the Government of India no disqualification attaches to their appointment provided no rule of the service res tricting the tenure of the particular office in which it is proposed to employ a subject of a Foreign State to British subjects, is violated.Intl.

At about 10-30 a.m . on the 5th the breeze freshened up again and a very disastrous storm, which lasted till about midnight, swept over the place. The quantity of rain which was registered at the Civil Hospital from the commencement of the storm to the end, a period of about 24 hours, was 11 inches and 2+cents, Mattrah being open to the north-east wind the fury of the storm was principally expended there, and several buglows, badans and zaeemas were washed ashore and wrecked.' * * 921.

A, Sept. 1886, Feysal, the second son of the late Sultan, had been unmarked by any of the dis- kt ~. 9,R 2 2 turbances which it was anticipated might arise from the aspirations of rival claimants to the Sultanate. This extraordinary tranquillity was attributed by the Political Agent to the declared policy of the Government of India to the late Sultan and the ignorance of possible pretenders to the throne as to how far this policy would be continued with regard to the present Ruler. Shortly after the death of Sayyid Turki, Sayyids Abdul Aziz and Ibrahim-bin-Keis wrote to the Resident to enquire whether Sayyid Feysal would enjoy the same support from the British Government as Sayyid Turki had done. And Colonel Ross replied that it would be in accordance w ith his instructions to co-operate in any manner in his power for the mainten- ance of tranquillity and the prosperity of the people. 940. The only serious movement against Sultan Sayyid Feysal made during 1888 was Sayyid Ibrahim's seizure of Aw^abee. But feayyid Feysal's position at Maskat was not seriously shaken by the loss, and in December one of the tribes, the Yal Saad, that had risen against him 5 came in and asked for pardon for their share in the transaction, Exti. a , Feb. 1889, • 941. On the 25th December 1888 the Resident received a telegram from Calcutta enquiring whether he considered the chance of a dynastic struggle had ended. To this Colonel Ross replied that it did not appear to him that Sayyid Feysal's position had been affected by the Rostak affairs, and he was of opinion that the chances of a dynastic struggle w T ere too indefinite to make further delay expedient. 942. On the 15th April 1889 Colonel Ross received the following mes sage :— ' Secretary of State agrees to formal recognition of Sayyid Feysal. Do you still think this desirable, and, if so, ^ould you attach any warning or conditions ? 943. The Resident replied that the recognition was desirable but without conditions, and that, if authorised, he w r ould proceed to Maskat, where, should the situation be still unchanged, he would convey the Viceroy's message with the usual ceremonies, 944. This proposal was sanctioned, but on proceeding to Maskat Colonel Confidential telegram from Foreign, ^ 0 S S found that circumstances had arisen which dated Simla, 20th April isss). rendered it expedient to defer the formal recogni- Letter No. 103, from Resident, to tion of His Highness Sayyid Feysal as Sultan.

Major Yate gave his impression of the prevailing popular opinion upon the question of the choice of a Ruler : — . The main aim and object of the Chiefs and people is to m aintain a division of power so as to prevent any one man becoming- strong enough to tax them all with impunity, and vet at the same time to retain in their hands a lever sufficiently powerful to force outmonev for them selves when opportunity offers.'

Taking the whole of the circumstances into consideration, he arrived at the following determination :— ' 1 think^ we may reasonably conclude that the majority have no wish to disturb the present regime, and therefore that in recognising Sayyid Feysal we shall be o-ivino- effect to the wishes of the chiefs and people of the country/' 948. Another reason adduced for the advisability of recognising Sayyid Feysal was the large vested interests of British subjects, Hindoo and Kho jah, m the coast towns, where they had property at stake to the value of many lakhs of rupees. ' f Sayyid Feysal has now been in power for the last year and nine months * * * * &gt; an d so far as I am aware he has throughout done his best to meet the wishes of the British Government and he appears to promise to'be able and willing to fulfil all the conditions we require * * Kos 1 ; 94)9 - Colone l fross concurred in the opinion that the time had arrived for the No. 128.

This was found to be impracticable as His Excellency was just leaving Simla on a tour through the Native States. 958. In his letter of 15th September 1890 to the address of H.

McKenzie on the subject closed the correspondence for 1890. ( Cf. also paras. 1009-1010.) 967. Sale of the Customs Farm at Maskat-—The old contract having expired, the Sultan resold the Customs farm at Maskat for the ensuing year, commencing from the 23rd November, to Rattansee Purshotam, a Batha mer chant, for $115,000, which gave an advance of $4,000 over the past year. 968, Political Agent .—Surgeon-Major Jayakar handed over charge of Genl.

His Highness Sayyid Feysal gave the owner's agent, at the request of the Consulate, a written order to the Waliof Ras-ull-Hadd to render all possible assistance in the protection of the cargo. 970. On the 21st September His Highness Sayyid Feysal complained to the Political Resident that a buglow belonging to His Highness's subjects of Sur had been run down and sunk off Maskat by the British India Steam Navigation Company's Steamer Simla, and that, with the exception of crew and passengers, all on board had been lost.971. The suit for compensation filed in the case by the Nakhuda of the Jeneibee, the Arab Aweissee sunk by the Simla, was heard by the Acting Poli tical Agent. He found that the collision was entirely due to the carelessness of the Nakhuda in not carrying a light on a dark night and also in allowing passengers to take charge of the helm, while he was himself asleep. 972. The case was dismissed. But Surgeon-Major Jayakar represented the now destitute condition of the passengers of the Jeneibee, their Nakhuda, and crew to the compassionate consideration of the British India Steam Navi gation Company, and recommended that Es. 1,000 be granted by the Company to the sufferers. Exti. b , June 1891, 973.

Slave Trade .—The Administration Reports of the Persian Guli Political Eesidency and Maskat Political Agency contain the following entries on the subject: — ' The traffic in raw slaves meotioued in last year's report continue in unabated vigour and numerous importations into the Persian and Arabian ports are believed to have taken place. ' A circular letter was addressed to the Trucial Chiefs reraindino' them of their engage ment in this respect; as usual, the Beni Jabar and other Bedouin tribes on the Batineh Coast were the principal offenders. (i In May Her Majesty's Ship Cossack brought for adjudication the case of a dhow captured by her near Ras-Gameilah and destroyed after her crew had fired on the ship's boats; the dhow was condemned. ' In September, twenty-five African slaves arrived at Maskat in the British India Steamer Kistna from Karachi in charge of some Arabs. They were, after enquiry by the Acting Political Agent, liberated with the assent of the Sultan and sent to Bombay; their release, however, called forth strong remonstrance from Shaikh Saleh.bin-AU to His Highness Sayyid Fey sal. u During this month the Resident at Bushire made a representation to the Political Agent regarding the wholesale importation of slaves into the Persian Gulf from Soor and the British Coast, ' During the year thirty-two fugitive slaves taking refuge at this Consulate were Ereed under the Treaty of 1878/' 975. The following entries in the Maskat Political Diary are illustrative of the difficulties which have to be encountered in dealing with the question of the slave trade:— ' 28tk Ociober. —I paid an official visit to His Highness the Sultan and took the oppor tunity of communicating to him the purport of the reports from the Residency Agents at Lingah and Shargah regarding the wholesale importation of slaves into the Persian Gulf Ports from Soor and the Batineh. ' f 2nd December.-— I l W s Highness Seyyid Feysal, accompanied by his brothers Seyyid Muhammad and Seyyid Fehd, visited the Political Agent. Among other subjects touched on, His Highness enquired whether it were true that the Germans had proclaimed that slaves might be bought and. sold in their territory on the East African coast, remarking that if it were true, their doing so would, draw to them the hearts of all the Arabs.''' 976. Intertribal disturbances and minor events in 1890 —Minor events are noted as follows in the Administration Report and the Political Diaries of the Maskat Agency:— ' 12tli January. —It is reported that Hamud has raided 400 slieep, the,property of Salim- bm-Hasan, Rahbiyeh, from near Kahza.' w ^ e ^ ruar y-—N ews received that a kafilah of 40 camels, in charge of some of the Al ahibah, el Habus, and el Duhaha on its way to Akk Pass had been attacked in the Wadi email by the Rahabieen in retaliation for the loss of the 400 sheep carried off by Shaikh amud-al-Jahafi.

His Highness is despatching Sayjid Nasir-bin-Muhammad to Semail to endeavour to recover the plundered property.' 977. v Position of Affairs on 1st January 1891. —The withdrawal of Sayyid Abdul Aziz to India removed the chief disturbing factor in Oman politics. It had freed Maskat from the former interminable rumours of attack, and exercised a beneficent effect upon trade by strengthening the feeling of security to life and property. But the close of 1890 had brought fresh troubles. A caravan of the Sharkiyeh had been plundered by tribes of the Semail valley. And inattention to the consequent quarrels at their outset gave rise to con siderable complications before the matter was ultimately settled. 978. The state of the Sharkiyeh and the stagnation of trade in Mattrah and Maskat.—His Highness the Sultan had unfortunately not exerted himself to effect a settlement in the case of the plunder of Shaikh Salih-bin-Ali's kafilah in the Semail valley by the Yaarabeh, and Eeni Jabir. (C/*. last entry iu para. 976.) In December 1890 and January 1891 the disturbances caused by the contending parlies reacted seriously on the mer cantile communities of Oman. In a memorandum on the subject, dated 22nd February, the Political Agent reviews the situation:— Extl. A, July 1891, 'The unsettled condition of the country and the consequent insecurity of the roads has Nos. 298-328, ' had a corresponding effect on the trade of Maskat and Mattrah, for whilst, on the one hand, mde No. 302. a ll trade communications with the interior have for the present closed, on the other hand, the difiiculties in recovering outstandings and dues have in a proportionate ratio considerably in creased, * * * the trade with the Sharkiyeh has entirely ceased. The same thing has now * * * occurred to the trade with the Semail valley, while the trade with the Batineh, always fitful at this time of the year, has now become more so owing to the disturbed condition of the country.' It was pointed out that the British traders were the principal losers, and that if the situation did not improve, many would have to close business. The memorandum continues: — 'His Highness the Sultan, whose friendly influence at the time might have prevented the intertribal rupture, has from the beginning taken little or no interest in such matters and has quietly allowed the authority of dictating terms of peace which rightly belonged to him to pass away from his hands * * , In acting as he has done, he has not only shewn his incapacity to grapple with the question of intertribal quarrels, but also a great disregard for the interests of trade which depends mainly on the welfare of the country.' bxti a, july 1891 979. As late as the 19th April things had improved but little. The Nos.' 298-328, Political Agent received on that date a long confidential letter from Messrs. Hide No. 315. 211Towelle &amp; Co., of Maskat, complaining of the commercial deadlock and request- ing that the matter might be duly represented to the Government of India. 980. The Resident in forwarding the correspondence pointed out that although political causes had no doubt contributed largely to the decline in the prosperity of Maskat, yet the merchants seemed to owe some of their existing difficulties to miscalculation of the situation by ordering goods as usual when there was little or no sale for them. He added Extl. A, July 1891, ' At the same time it is probable that there will be a revival of trade when the near Nos. 298-328, vide approach of the date season induces the tribes to patch up their quarrels ior the time, and the No. 313. Political Agent has been requested to lose no opportunity of impressing upon His Highness the Sultan the wisdom of using his best endeavours to promote this/' 981. Settlement of the feud between the Sharkiyeh and Semail Valley tribes—On i5rd May the Political Agent wrote— Extl A July 1891, ' I am glad to report that the mission of Rasltid-bin-Aziz and jNTuhammad-bin-Masud to Nos.' 298-328, wie Shaikh Salih-bin-Ali lias been successfully carried out bv them and terms of peace arranged No. 318. * * * the Beni Jabir are to pay to Shaikh Salih-bin-Ali $1,800 in full settlement of all claims on account of the plundered kafilah, blood-money and everything else. It is a pity His Highness Sayyid Feysal did not move in the matter before. However, all merchants will be thankful that the roads are once more open and that they will be able to sell some of their goods.' Extl. a , July 1891, 982. On 16th May Oman was reported quiet.

The Political Agent wrote:— His Highness remarked that if they and their boats can be covered by the French flag in his territorial waters, the French flag may some day be held to cover their houses and pro perty on land/' In a letter of the same date the Political Agent reported that eight of the principal Shaikhs of the Jenebah of Sur had stated to him that they had got their French papers from the French Consul at Aden and not from Obokh, and that they had paid a fee of E4)0 for each paper.

Eighteen dhows of Sur under French colours had put in to Lingah and several native boats flying the same flag deposited their papers with the French Consular Agent at Basrah.

The burning and pillage of the Bazaar at Khaburah.—On No. 301 the 7th March 1891 the Political Agent reported that the bazaars of Khaburah had been destroyed by fire on the 24th February, in which, it was said, property had been lost by the fire and pillage amounting to $ 50,000, though this amount was probably exaggerated. 298-3281001. In his letter of the 21st March the Political Agent continues the ' No. 807. subject:— On the 18th instant the British subjects burnt out of Khaburah arrived from Soweyk whither they had transported their families and any property they had saved. The iire, I believe, (was) certainly the handiwork of the Howamid section of the Howasinah in enmity to the head Shaikh of the Howasinah (Muhammad bin Nasir) who belonfjs to another section (Sowalim), and that they were incited to do the deed by Sayyid Hamad bin Nasir, T\ali of Sohar, within whose jurisdiction Khaburah until lately has been j also that the Shaikh of the Howamid personally told His Highness Sayyid Feysal that they would burn the Bazaar of Khaburah unless he adjudged to them half the rent of the shops which had hitherto been received by Shaikh Muhammad bin Nasir, that Shaikh Muhammad bin Nasir on hearing this doubled the guard of the bazaar, but was told by His Highness Sayyid Feysal that there was no fear as he would arrange matters between the Howasinah sections. &lt;£ At present I am inclined to believe that His Highness Sayyid Feysal is not only dis tinctly responsible for the loss of property belonging to the British merchants of Khaburab but did greatly himself contribute to bring about the burning of the bazaar. 214Estl.

In another letter of the same date, the Wali of Khaburah wrote to His Highness, stating that on his return to the town he set to work to collect the goods plundered from the British subjects, and that finally every thing they could gather together had been put into a house.

The views of the Government of India were explained to His Highness the Sultan, and a Panchayat was appointed to investigate the actual losses of the British Indian traders from the fire. A representative of the Local Government was present at the Panchayat. The award of this Panchayat, which placed the losses of the sufferers by the fire at $12,739, was communicated to His Highness the Sultan. exti. a, march 1892, 1004.

'Although we have grounds for discussing the matter, we give it up in agreeing with the wishes of the Great Government who have in view nothing but what is good.' In view of the low state of the Exchequer, His Highness urged that the utmost he could afford towards discharging the amount was the payment of $1,000 per mensem out of the Zanzibar subsidy commencing from the year 1892. 1005.
