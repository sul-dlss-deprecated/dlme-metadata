As it was never published, I give it here. te The entire population of Seistan has been esti mated at 20,000 houses, and they can muster on an average one matchlock per family. _ They are all infantry and very hardy. The heat is very in tense, and there is a fly whose sting is so noxious and severe as to destroy horses, which are conse quently rarely met with in this Province. The soil is for the most part sand mixed with clay, and yields pasture for cattle, which thrive well there. The Helmund overflows its banks annually, and the deposit left by these inundations enables the people to cultivate large quantities of wheat and barley, which are sold very cheap (600 lbs. for 5^.), and to supply Furrah, Ghayn, Beerjund, and sometimesTIeratahdr^antt4«kla^jc_—Tha_jmhabitants are not industrious, but generally prefer living by plunder to earning a more honest livelihood by their own exertions. They have a very fine breed of camels, large oxen, and numerous goats.

History of the Province up to the Persian War of 1856-57. Mr. Watson, in the Memorandum on the boundaries of Persia, which was sub mitted to Mr. Alison on the 15th Decem ber 1864, gave a succinct history of the Province of Seistan and Lash-Jowain, which may conveniently he extracted and quoted at starting :—■ “ In the time of the Sefaveean Kings, the Pro vince of Seistan, as well as the whole* of Afghan istan, formed part of the Persian dominions. Bnt Seistan was added to the new kingdom of Afghan istan in the year 1749 by Ahmed Shah, the founder of the Sudozye dynasty, and therefore it can no more he argued that that Province forms an integral portion of Persia than that the whole of Afghanistan forms an integral portion of Persia. c&lt; Sixty years is the period laid down as that after which any dormant claim for territory may not be legally revived ;f and therefore, even supposing that the Shahs of the Kajar dynasty had the right to claim all the possessions of the Sefaveeans, they have at this date, according to the above-mentioned principle, forfeited that right in the case of Seistan. a Seistan, from the year 1749, remained under the sway of Ahmed Shah during the whole of that monarches long reign, and it was only towards the close of the life of his successor, Tymoor Shah, that Seistan came to be only no minally dependent upon Afghanistan. Since then it has continued to be independent both of Persia and of Afghanistan. From 1749 till 1796 the whole Province of Khorassan was independent of Persia, but in the latter year Agha Mahomed Khan added it to his dominions. He did not, however, pro secute his conquests further in that direction, and Seistan continued to be separate from Persia during the whole of his reign. “It was during the reign of his successor, Futteh Ali Shah, that, in the year 1810, Captain Christie travelled through Seistan, which was then under independent Chiefs. “ Long after that period about the time of the English expedition into Afghanistan, the Persian Government seems to have thought of setting up pretensions to dominion over Seistan. For this purpose it has ever since continued to endeavour to win over to its views some of the leading Chiefs of the District, and in 1858 one of them obtained the assistance of two Persian regiments, by whose aid he was to rule in the Shah's name. In the same year this Chief was put to death, but since then the Persian Government has never allowed any long interval to elapse without re-asserting its claim to Seistan. It has recently said that it would view an invasion of that Province by the Afghans in the same light in which it would regard an invasion of Khorassan, and it has de clared its intention to vindicate the Shahs title to Seistan by an appeal to arms. “ Last year a Persian force was told off for service in that Province in aid of one of the * Not further than Candahar ; and it finally revolted in 1713, Herat a few years later on. After a short period of anarchy, a Seistan Chief took possession of Herat. This was in the time of Shah Tahmasp, the last but one of the Sefaveean dynasty.— (Ferrier’s History of the Afghans, p. 37.) H. LeP. W.i i ( ^ ) Chiefs, but this does not seem to have affected in any way the actual independence of Seistan. “ The small Province of Lash-Jowain lies to the Lash-Jowain. north of Seistan, and has generally followed the fortunes of the larger principality. When Seistan belonged to Persia, Lash-Jowain was Persian, and it appears to have been added, with it, by Ahmed Shah to the new kingdom of Afghanistan. In 1810 the people of Jowain were under Maho med Khan, Chief of a tribe of the Ghilzyees, who resided at Durg—a fort within two miles of Jowain—and who maintained four hundred horse. The claims of Persia extend over Lash- Jowain on the same foundation as those over Seistan, namely, that both Provinces formed part of the kingdom of the Sefaveeans. Lash-Jowain, however, may more reasonably be laid claim to by the Afghans than by the Persians, as at one time, within the last thirty years, it paid tribute to Herat. At present it is an independent State. Its Chief, Ahmed Khan, wrote a letter last year, in which he styled himself the hereditary ruler of Lash-Jowain, but stated his readiness to join the army of the Ameer of Cabul if your Excellency should wish him to do so. “ I enclose a Map of Persia and the adjacent countries, which is the only one I can find for sale at Teheran. It is copied from the Map published by the late Sir Alexander Burnes, and from the fact of its being recognized as correct by educated Persians, I would infer that thirty years ago, when it was published, Persia had no pretensions to sovereignty over Seistan or Lash-Jowain, since neither of these Provinces is included within the limits of that country in this Map/'’ 2. Tlie details which I have collected from other authorities will, I think, shew that, while the above summary is in the main correct, Mr. Watson’s statement that the Province of Seistan has been indepen dent of Afghanistan from the time of Tymoor Shah, needs some qualification. 3. Of the independent Chiefs whom Christie found in possession of Seistan, the two most important were (1) Khan Jehan Khan, the Belooch, who was even a greater robber than his neighbours, hut who kept his country in a far better state of culti vation : his capital is sometimes called Ilumdar,* sometimes Jehanabad in Ilum- dar; (2)Behram Khan, of the ancient family of Kaianees, descendants of Kai Khosroo.f’ His revenues were not more than 30,000 Rupees, and he was quite unable to resist the depredations of Khan Jehan Khan. His capital was Doshuk, alias Jelalabad. “ He assumes/-’ Pottinger says, “ the royal title of Badsha, or King of Seistan, and lives in as magni ficent a style as his trifling revenues will admit of; his territories are divided into petty Districts, to each of which he formerly appointed a Governor, whose authority was nearly equal to his own; and I am informed that many of them have of late years declined paying tribute.’-’ * Christie in Pottinger’s Travels, p. 408.

Accounts differ as to what was his tribe, and whether it was Belooch or Persian. Ferrier (Caravan Journeys, 415 and 427) says, it was the Shahrekhee Belooch tribe. Conolly, too, mentions the Shahrekhees as the chief rivals of the Kaianees. Taj Mahomed, on the other hand, says his ancestor belonged to the Surbundee tribe. Leech’s account, too, confirms this statement. But, according to Ferrier, this, the Surbundee tribe, was that of the Belooch Khan Jehan’s son whom he found in possession of Sheikhuassoor. Then, as to the nationality of the tribes, both Shahrekhees and Surbundees, according to Ferrier, were Belooches. Elphinstone (Cabul, II., 221), on the contrary, divides the Seistanees into four septs,—(1) the Tajiks [undoubted Persians] i. e., the Kaianees ; (2) Shahrekhees and (3) Surbundees, immi grants from Irak (Central Persia) ; (4) more recent immigrants from Beloochistan headed by Khan Jehan Khan^nd Leech’s account is in accordance with this. || Conolly. H Colonel Taylor’s memorandum. ** Conolly’s MS. Journal. +f Conolly and Colonel Taylor. 4. Conolly, in 1839, gave the following accopint of the previous history of the Kaianee family. In the first quarter of the 18th century the whole of Scistan was possessed by Mullick Mahomed, Kaianee. Nadir Shah, while still no more than the General of Shah Tahmasp, conquered and put him to death, hut allowed his younger brother, Mullick Hussein, to retain the nominal government. He soon revolted. By this time* Nadir had received the Pro vince as a grant from Shah Tahmasp, and sent his nephew, Ali, to govern and keep it quiet. He was perseveringly resisted by the Seistanees under the brothers, Putteh Ali and Lootf Ali (Kaianees). Ali at last made friends with them, and with them in his train marched against his uncle, the great Nadir. Just at this time, 1717, Nadir was assassinated by his Chiefs, and Ali was acknowledged! as his successor. 5. The Kaianee brothers, Putteh Ali and Lootf Ali, were succeeded in Seistan by their brother, Suleman. Pie gave his allegiance and his daughter in marriage to Ahmed Shah Abdallee, who had, im mediately after Nadir Shah’s death, left the Persian Court, and achieved the inde pendence of Afghanistan. t£ Since then,” says Elphinstone, writing in 1810—14, &lt;c the Kaianees have paid a light tribute and furnished a contingent to the King of Cabul, but it has sometimes been neces sary to enforce the performance of these acts of submission. 6. In the brief struggle for the succes sion on Ahmed Shah’s death in 1773, the Seistanees J unluckily took the side of the unsuccessful candidate, Suleman, the eldest son. One Chief, Meer Beg,§ the head of the tribe of Shahrekhees, held by Tymoor, and, in reward for this, received the governorship of the Province when Tymoor triumphed. Pour years after wards he was killed in some petty skir mish near Koodbar. The Kaianees then propitiated Tymoor, who placed the Pro vince under the Governor of Lash, Maho med Zeman Khan, Populzye, but under him allowed Behram Khan, || a son of Suleman Kaianee, to retain the manage ment. 7. Tymoor was soon called upon to take fresh action both in Lash and in Seistan. Mahomed Zeman Khan, the Governor of the former, shewed symptoms of intend ed rebellion,^ and the Shahrekhees** were in arms against Behram Khan in Seistan. Sirdar Berkhoodar Khan,ft Achekzye, was sent to restore order, He brought MahomedZeman to his senses and reduced the Shahrekhees with great slaughter, but not without obstinate resistance on their part. The next Governor was Sirdar Mudud Khan,* who collected the revenue and re turned. “ The Seistanees continued their submission during the life-time of Tymoor Shah, and, at his death, to his sen, Shah Mahmood.” 8. During this time the power of Beh- ram Khan gradually diminished. Colonel Taylor’s memorandum. _ “ He lived,” says Conolly,t “ in as much state as + ms. Journal, his limited means would allow, and always affected the style and pageantry of a king; hut his nobles, who accepted offices in his household and stood like menials before his throne, were every day encroach ing on his lands and power. His son and successor, Jelaloodeen, was for some time served in a similar manner. All his possessions have at length been seized, and he himself, a beggar and an exile, lives on the precarious bounty of the Herat Governor.” 9. How this came about can he gather ed from the account of Taj Mahomed, son of the principal Chief who rose into power on the fall of the Kaianees. Jalaloodeen had rebelled against his father and built the fort Jalalabad, where he held out for some time ; but he was at length seized by his father and confined in chains. On Behram’s death shortly after, Jalaloodeen made good his claim to succeed, and for a period held his own. During the disturbances in Afghanistan, which occurred about this time, and which resulted in the Barwkzye brothers despoil ing the Sudozyes of all their territory except Herat, the Seistanees seized the occasion to revolt. | Bor a time no effort was made to reduce them. MaheimSd Shah was too much stupefied by habitual drunkenness, and his son, Kamran, too much occupied by thoughts how to get his father out of his way. In this he succeed ed in the year 1829. Bive§ years later Jdaloodeen, Kaianee, was expelled by Hasham Khan, of the Shahrekhee|| tribe, whose fort was at Deshtuk, and who figures no more in the narrative: Mahomed Beza Khan, Surbundee, who had fixed his seat at Sekkoodah^and Khan Jehan Khan, Belooch, who had received a grant of Sheikknassoor**' from Eutteh Khan,ft the great Mazeer and head of the Barukzye brothers. Jalaloodeen fled to Kamran, who had married his cousin, and who, with his mi nister, Yar Mahomed, invaded the Province with a large force. Mahomed Iteza sub mitted without resistance, and was left in possession of his territory. Khan Jehan Khan resisted obstinately, but was at length defeated and (apparently also) killed.

Both he and Sirdar Gholam, however, com mitted such oppressions, that two years later, i. &lt;?., in 1836, the people rose and expelled them. Jelaloodeen’s possessions fell into the hands of Mahomed Beza Khan, of Sehkoodah, and Sheikhnassoor w T as re-occupied by the two sons of Khan Jehan Khan,—Ali and Ibrahim Khan. * Sir H. Ellis, quoted by Mr. Ronald Thomson in the above-mentioned account. + Mr. Ellis, writing to Lord Palmerston, Janu- ary 15th, 1836, said, “ unfortunately the conduct of Kamran Meerza in violating the engagements entered into with the late Abbas Meerza, and in per mitting his Vizier, Yar Mahomed, to occupy port of Seistan, has given the Shah a full justification for commencing hostilities.—[Blue Book of Afghan War, page 6.] Yar Mahomed marched* down with the intention of again reducing the Province ; but he was interrupted by the advance of Mahmood Shah, of Persia, to besiege Herat,f and for a while Seistan continued independent. 10. When Conolly arrived in the au tumn of 1839, he found Lash in possession of Mahomed Saleh Khan, commonly call ed by the title of Shah Pusund Khan; Jowain held by Goolzar Khan under the Governorship of the same Shah Pusund Khan, Goolzar Khan’s uncle; and Seistan divided between Mahomed Beza Khan, of Sehkoodah, and Ibrahim Khan, of Sheikh nassoor (he makes no mention of Ali, Ibrahim’s brother). 11. In the struggles between the sons * ooo 10 ]!^ in Asiatic Society’s Journal, Voi. x., of Tymoor Shah, Saleh Khan | had at first s ° ° 3 ’ u attached himself to the cause of Mahmood. Disgusted with him, he at first joined Shah Sooja, but then retired to his fort at Lash and remained neutral for a time. Haji Perozuddin, another of Tymoor’s sons, was now ruler of Herat, and, desiring to add Lash-Jowain to his possessions, sent a par- tizan, Dost Mahomed Khan, Populzye, to occupy the Province. Saleh Khan surren dered Jowain on condition of being allow ed to retain Lash. But when the time came for Dost Mahomed Khan, Populzye, to return to Herat, Saleh Khan was told plainly that he could not be suffered to remain in the Province, and accordingly took refuge with Kamran, at this time Governor of Candahar. Kamran made him soon his chief manager, and in that situa tion he remained nine or ten years. In this period Kamran became ruler of Herat, and Saleh Mahomed, now called Shah Pusund Khan (He-with-whom-the-King- is-delighted), recovered his old territory, from whence the adherents of Perozuddin had been ejected. His favor with Kamran w T as by no means unbroken. On the( 8 ) contrary he was, on one occasion while at Herat, seized and tortured. He fled into Persian territory, and from thence made expeditions into his old territory, more than once gaining and again losing posses sion of Jowain, Purrah, and other places. Hut he never succeeded in possessing him self of Lash. Kamran then took him hack into favour, made him his minister, and gave him Hurrah and Jowain, reserv ing Lash with jealous care for himself. In the end, however, Shah Pusund Khan was too much for him. He got the Prince to sign a paper to the effect that the fort was his, alleging that his only reason for demanding such a document was to save his honor with his tribe. Conolly continues^— “A year had elapsed, Kamran had forgotten the paper, when all ot a sudden a messenger of Shah Pusund's arrived at Lash with a letter to the Governor from the Khan, enclosing the docu ment, sealed and attested by the Shazadah, and requesting the delivery of the fort, according to the tenor of the enclosure, to a person of his ap pointing. The Governor was completely taken in; the fort was given up, and Shah Pusund immediately fled to it turned yaghee (rebel), and has since successfully resisted every effort to reduce him seven or eight times; and twice in person Kamran has blockaded Jowain and Lash. These repeated attacks have impoverished the rich valley; but a fevy years of quiet under Shah Pusund's rule, which is very popular, will render the District more fertile and populous than it has been since the days of ISfowsherwan . &gt;y It was an understood thing that, on Goolzar Khan’s death, his son should succeed him as Governor of the fort of Jowain and the small patch round it, still paying three-fifths of the produce to Shah Pusund Khan. 12. Proceeding to the south of the Helmund, Conolly found the territory occupied by Mahomed Heza Khan, who “ declared himself the enemy of the Persians, and still more so of the Heratees £ who ruined him and his country.’ He boasted much of his ability to form an ad vantageous connection with the Persians,” and would, Conolly held, he glad of the friendship of a powerful government (Persian or English), which would much strengthen his position among his own subjects, of whom many were ill-disposed toward him, and would also secure him # foi ei D n enemies. &lt;£ His chief jealousy, if not fear, seemed to be, of Shah Pusund Khan and Ibrahim Khan \ of the former he spoke guardedly, of the latter in terms of unmitigated hatred.” Shah Pusund Khan had married Ibrahim’s sister. * Conolly in Asiatic Society’s Journal pp. 334-35.mmm ( 8a ) \ : vr* | V j t A 4* f I.V-- &gt; r' ijm Lieutenant Leech’s account of the Chiefs who were in possession of the Pro vince when he wrote (about 1839 as far as I can make out) somewhat differs from Conolly’s. According to him they were as follows :— (1.)—Jelaloodeen, restored by Kamran, and not yet re-expelled ; had lately become a Soonee: He had been at enmity with his brother Hamza Khan, but Kamran had reconciled them, and Hamza had married the sister of Mahomed Rezas, who was, however, at variance with the Kainee brothers, and was more popular than they in Seistan. (2.)—Mahomed Reza, Surbundee. Kamran had given one of this Chiefs daughters in mar riage to a son of his Yuzier Yar Mahomed. He had been on good terms with the Sir dars of Candahar, before Kamran invaded Seistan, and was neutral in the war going on, when Lieutenant Leech wrote, between Kamran and the Persians. (3.)—Hasham Khan, Shahrekhee, on good terms with the Belooch occupants of parts of Seistan, had a superficial friendly in tercourse with the Sirdars of Canda har. A (4.)—Ali Khan, son of Khan Jehan Khan of the Sunjuranee Belooch tribe, had received Sheikhnassoor as a gift from Futteh Khan (as above-mentioned), and had. - c £J2^r after his temporary dispossession, re- -eeived h when the Persians besieged Herat. The place had, with Khash and Kudda, been under the brother- -in-law of ^Yuzier Totah Khan, Meer Alum Khan Noorzai, who was killed in Eastern Afghanistan. Ali Khan was on good terms with the Sirdars of Can dahar, but did not pay tribute or de ference to them ; was largely connected by marriage with the neighbouring potentates^ one sister having married Kamran, another Shah Pusund Khan, another a son of Meer Alum Khan of Kain.13. When, on the English occupation of Candahar, Kohendil Khan,* Barukzye, passed through Seistan on his way to Persia, he was received with honor ; and, on his way back three years afterwards, he entered into engagements with the Seistanees, and was accompanied by several of the leading men back to Candahar, “ where he enter tained them sumptuously and dismissed them with many favours.” Taj Mahomed even says that Kohendil Khan was aided in recovering Candahar by Mahomed Keza. The Ameer Shere Ali (Cabul Agent’s letter of 23rd January 1870) confirms this and says that, in gratitude for this service, Kohendil Khan relieved Seistan of its obligation to pay tribute to Afghanistan— the obligation to render military aid when needed being continued. Here may most conveniently be mentioned another proof of Seistan’s dependence on Afghanistan, mentioned by the Ameer Shere Ali (see above-mentioned letter). “ Fifteen years ago,” he said, “ the Persian Go vernment, in friendship, wrote to Sirdar Kohendil Khan to the effect that as some of the Seistan robbers had carried off some property belonging to Persian merchants on the Huftahdrah Koad, it would be well if he (the Sirdar) could recover the same and make it over to its owners. The Sirdar accordingly sent his son, Sirdar Sultan Ali Khan, towards Seis tan ; and he, after recovering the plundered property, forwarded it to Killah Koh to Syud Noor Maho med Shah, who was acting at that time as Agent in Persia on behalf of Sirdar Kohendil Khan, and the Syud made over the same to Khan Baba Khan, Governor of Kerman.” 14. Taj Mahomed says that bis father, Mahomed Keza, about this time shewed his independence of Persia by lending his aid to the Ameer of Kain when the latter was attacked by Persian troops. 15. By this time Yar Mahomed had formally, as he had long ago virtually, put aside Kamran, and he took early measures to restore Seistan to its former position as a dependency of Herat. His emissaries were well received : several Khans ten dered their allegiance ; and Mahomed Keza’s son was married to his daughter.! 16. This was the state of things when General Perrier visited the Province in 1845. He founds that Kohendil Khan had brought under the rule of Candahar part of Seistan as far as Koodbar, on the Hel- mund. The portion that lies between this and Ilamdar he found to be the object of perpetual discord between Kohendil Khan( 10 ) and the nomadic Belooches. The rest of Seistan he found to be divided between Mahomed Beza Khan, of Sehkoodab, and Ali Khan, of Sheikhnassoor. He remarks as follows regarding the territorial division between these two Chiefs:— The territory of^ Mahomed Reza Khan IS Ferrier’s Caravan Journeys, p. 417. comprised in the triangle marked out by the Lake of Seistan to the north and west, and the Helmund River in the elbow, which it makes from Trakoo, as far as the junction with its first canal to the north, and at the southern point of the lake. “ Ali Khan is, after Mahomed Reza Khan, the most powerful Belooch Chief in Seistan ; the ter ritory which he governs is bordered on the north by the rapid stream of the Khoospas, which flows from the north-east of the lake almost as far as the Helmund in a southerly direction ; to the west it is bounded by the first canal which, leaving that river, falls into the lake. Sheikhnassoor, the capital of this small State, is an old fortress sur rounded by mud walls, and containing between fifteen and eighteen hundred houses, a bazaar, five public baths, two caravanserais, and a mosque/'’ This Ali Khan had, a few years before, murdered Dr. Forbes, who had, despising all warning, ventured within his clutches. He was at the time of Ferrier’s visit at Ferrier’s Caravan Journeys, p. 415. war with Shah Pusund Khan, of Lash- Jowain, “ whose people were plundering the country.” Ferrier makes no mention of Ibrahim Khan, All’s brother. On the other hand, his predecessor, Conolly, omits all notice of Ali, and, in the accounts of subsequent authorities, Ali Khan disappears altogether, and Ibrahim is alone mentioned as ruler of Sheikhnassoor. 17. As regards Lash-Jowain, Ferrier writes— “ We arrived very early at Lash-Jowain, a for- Caravan Journeys, pp. 421-22. tress situated on the right bank of the Furrah-rood, and about seven or eight parasarys above the place at which it falls into the lake. We were received at the house of Saloo (Saleh) Khan, an Afghan of the tribe of Ishakzye, and chief of this District. The Khan is more generally known by the name of Shah Pmu id Khan—He-with-whom-the-King-is- pleased—a title which he received from ShahKam- ran. This Sirdar, as I have already said, was at war with the Belooch Chief, Ali Khan, of Sheikh nassoor ; but he had other difficulties to surmount. Lash had always been a dependence of the prin cipality of Herat ; nevertheless, Shah Pusund Khan refused to acknowledge the complete sovereignty of Yar Mahomed, and he was secretly encouraged in this rebellious spirit by the Persian Court and Kohendil Khan, who, both one and the other, allied against the Chief of Herat, had the greatest / * ■ S XI . A I* ± J' s ^ '* 3 ' * “ Shah Pusund Khan, from his position between Persia and Afghanistan, has always been possessed of much political influence. He was equally courted by the Court of Persia on one side, and the Chiefs of Cabul and Candahar on the other. Nominally dependant on Herat, he was seldom trusted either by Shah Kamran or Yar Mahomed ; but from the moment the English came into the country, he stu diously attached himself to their cause, doing good service on several occasions. One of his sons Russool Khan, always resided in Candahar, in attendance on the Prince Governor during our occu pation ; and ^ this Chief was most useful as a medium of communication between the British authorities and^ the heads of the different Dooranee tribes.” [Editor of Perrier’s Caravan Journeys—H D Seymour, M.

Besides this, the fort of Lash is the key to the position, and the road from Persia to Candahar by the rivers; and Kohendil Khan, as well as Mahmood Shah, with that duplicity so common in eastern nations, each thought to deceive the other and obtain the support of Saloo Khan for his own particular interest; but Saloo had married his daughter to Mir dil Khan, the brother of the Candahar Chief, and seemed therefore to be devoted to that personage: his eldest son, Basool Khan, had also married a niece of Kohendil Khan.* These circumstances, and the somewhat rebellious spirit shown by Saloo Khan, were not agreeable to Yar Mahomed, who frequently menaced his disobedient and crafty vassal; but He-with- whom-the-King-is-pleased, while protesting his gieat devotion for the Chief of Herat, always tinned a deaf ear to his demands for tribute, and declined to pay, alleging as an excuse either that the crops were bad, the harvest was bad, or he was at war with a neighbour, or had some fort to build, &amp;c/ ; 18. Shortly after Eerrier’s visit, i. e., in 1848, Mahomed Reza Khan, died, leav ing six ^ sons,—Lootf. Ali, Taj Mahomed, Kohendil, and three others, and a brother, Ali Khan. Lootf Ali,f succeeded “ as Chief of Seistan on his father's death, but his authority was disputed by his uncle, who, after unsuccessfully attempting to gain over the other Chiefs, retired to Candahar and obtained assistance from Kohendil Khan. The latter sent between six and seven thousand men with Ali Khan to Seistan under Mehr dil Khan, who succeeded in defeating and capturing Lootf Ali Khan. He was at once deprived of his right, and Seistan was handed over to Ali Khan, while Sheikhnassoor was given to Ibrahim Khan. The Afghan troops then withdrew. Yar Mahomed Khan, of Herat, hearing what had occurred, maiched with nearly 10,000 men to Seistan to protect the sons of Mahomed Reza Khan, with whom his family was connected by marriage. He leached Lash and Jowain and took possession of these Districts; but having there become danger ously ill, he returned to Afghanistan, and died &amp; on the way, two stages from Herat, in 1851. Ali Khan now remained for some years in possession of Seistan, and quite independent.' 19. The account in Colonel Taylor's Memorandum corresponds with the above in the main, with this addition that when Yar Mahomed’s force reached Lash, Ahmed Khan, the Governor, son of Shah Pusund Khan, surrenderd it at once and did homage. “ A hundred Candahar horse, who had been in the fort of Lash for about six months, fled at the approach of Yar Mahomed Khan. Here the Chief became so ill that his friends put him into a tukhtek rowanl to bring him to Herat. He died on the( 12 ) road. When Kohendil Khan heard of his death he advanced against Furrah and took it. Here, being joined by the Seistanees and other lawless people, he proceeded to attack Herat. The people of Herat gave him battle at the Pool-i-Malan (on the Herirood) and defeated him, on which he returned to Furrah and began to strengthen it. He was followed by an army from Herat, 4,000 strong, under the late Esa Khan. Succours were despatched from Candahar to the assistance of Furrah. They fought for eight months, when Esa Khan, unable to reduce the place, returned to Herat. The Seistanees then again rebelled.”( 13 ) Section II. ^ ' I - U Ji 0 , ^ * Persian Blae Book of 1857, p. 1, et. scqu. Events and correspondence regarding the Province from the period immediately preceding the Persian War of 1856—57 down to 1861. 20. Commencing from 1851, Persia, under the guidance of her ambitious mi nister, Meerza Agha Khan, the Sudr Azim, manifested a continually-increasing ten dency* to revive her pretensions to the recovery of the ground lost to the eastward (including Herat and Seistan) at the time of the decay of the Sefaveean dynastv, 1715—1720. 21. The view which the English Go vernment took of these pretensions, which concerned primarily Herat, secondarily “other independent States of Afghanistan,” will best be gathered from the following extracts from an important despatch sent by Lord Malmesbury, to Colonel Shell, dated October 27th, 1852 :— “ The course which has been pursued by the Persian Government in regard to the affairs of Herat, is such as to inspire Her Majesty’s Govern ment with well-grounded distrust in any professions which the Shah or his ministers made, or may hereafter make, in regard to that Province. The promises and assurances hitherto given by that Government in reference to the disinterestedness of the measures taken by Persia, have ended in a formal and official declaration that Herat is hence forward to be an appendage to the Persian monar chy, and that the forces of Persia will be directed against any Afghan power which may seek to interfere with her newly-acquired possession. “ Practically, therefore, it matters not whether a Persian garrison be retained or not in the fortress or city of Herat: the whole Province is claimed as a Persian possession, and it now re mains for the British Government to decide whether they will allow this flagrant disregard of assurances so repeatedly given to them by Persia to pass unnoticed, or whether they will openly evince their deep displeasure, and take measures to resist any further encroachments of Persia on other independent States of Afghanistan. “ The result has proved that the assurances so frequently given by the Persian Government have been utterly disregarded, and that the territory of Herat, upon the maintenance of which in a state of independence Her Majesty’s Government have strongly insisted, is henceforth to be con sidered an integral portion of the Persian monar chy, and possibly to form an advanced post for further encroachments on Afghanistan. “ Her Majesty’s Government cannot submit in silence to such acts on the part of the Government of Persia; and, although they will not, without a further attempt to bring the Persian Government to a just view of its duties and engagements, adopt the extreme measure of breaking off all( 14 ) \ diplomatic intercourse with that Government, and of withdrawing Her Majesty's mission from Teheran, they nevertheless feel it incumbent upon them to evince their displeasure in a manner not to be mistaken. a Her Majesty's Government trust that the evi dence which the Persian Government will receive from this communication of the serious light in which its late proceedings are viewed, will cause it immediately to renounce any projects which it may have entertained of further encroachments on the Afghan territory. The Persian Govern ment must be aware, from what took place some years back, that the ^ British Government can easily cause its displeasure to be felt by Persia in a manner which may sensibly affect the material in terests of that country. It is far from the wish of Her Majesty's Government to enter upon a course which would be as painful to their own feelings as it would be prejudicial to Persia. But Her Majesty's Government most distinctly declare that they will not allow any systematic attempt on the part of Persia to effect a change in the state of possession in the countries lying between the Persian frontier and the British territories in IndiaP 22. As Persia would not yield, the result was the war, which was concluded by the treaty of Paris, March 1857- 23. During the negociations which led to that treaty, Lord Cowley held with the Persian ambassador a conversation,* which shews (1) what the Persians under stood to he the nature of the obligation undertaken by England when she promised her good offices in case of dispute between Persia and Afghanistan; (2) that Her Majesty’s Government had not departed from the policy so clearly announced five and a half years before, in Lord Malmesbury’s despatch. Ferokh Khan said that the Persian Govern ment were ready to refer matters of dispute that might arise with the Afghans to the considera tion of Her Majesty's Government, provided the latter promised their good offices to prevent the Afghans from attacking Persiaf Subsequently, when I summed up the conversation which had passed between us, Ferokh Khan was less explicit on this latter point. He said that Persia never could forego the right of repelling and punishing any tribes which might violate or disturb the Per sian frontier. However, I explained to him that Her Majesty's Government, in desiring to be taken as mediators in all matters of dispute be tween Persia and Afghanistan, had no other object in view than the prevention of the renewal of the present state of things ; that Her Majesty's Government had too great an interest in the wel fare of Persia to encourage or countenance any attack on Persia, but that they were equally de termined that Persia should not disturb the existing state of the tribes on her eastern frontierP 24. The immediate cause of the war had been the siege and capture of Herat * Persian Blue Book, 1857. f N.

Among other causes assigned by them in justification of their advance on Herat was the occupa tion of Candahar by Host Mahomed on the death of his brother, Kohendil Khan ; the consequent danger to the independence of Herat; and the alleged mission of one of Host Mahomed’s sons to plunder Seistan, reported by Ali Khan from Sehkoodah “ which is Persian territory.” [Persian Blue Book, 1857, pp. 123, 170.] 25. When the Persians advanced on Herat, Ahmed Khan threw in his lot with them. He allowed them to store Lash with grain (Meshed correspondent, 28th October 1865), and even to occupy it and Jowain with a force. 26. Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor was sent as British Commissioner to Herat to see that the stipulations of the Treaty were duly executed. He reported that they were not: that among other instances of evasion, the khootbah was still read and money coined at Herat in the name of the Shah; that as Ahmed Khan, the new ruler, was in the receipt of large subsidies from the Shah, while he, Colonel Taylor (unlike Major Todd in 1838—41), had nothing to offer, his presence at Herat was of little use; and finally, that the Province of Lash- Jowain, which had been occupied by Per sian troops when hostilities began, had not been evacuated. The Cabul Vakeel on the /v 30th March^ reported a speech of Host Mahomed on the same subject. He had said that Lash and Jowain, in the Histrict of Purrah, in former times belonged to Herat: that “ on the death of the late Wuzeer, Yar Maho med Khan, the late Kohendil Khan, of Candahar, seized upon Furrah, Lash and Jowain, and they remained dependent on Candahar till the late inva sion of the Persians into the Province of Herat, when they availed themselves of the confusion into which the death of Kohendil Khan had thrown affairs at Candahar, to appropriate Lash and Jowain, which up to this moment they hold, having put a Governor of the Kaianee tribe into the charge of them. The Ameer considers that Lash and Jowain belong to him, but the British Govern ment ought either to cause them to be made over to Cabul, or else to Herat/'’ * See Mr. Murray, to Lord clarendon, dated 27. An animated correspondence* on 13th, 15th, and 29th March is58. ^hese points arose between Mr. Murray, the British Minister, and the Sudr Azim. The latter said that Lash-Jo wain was, and had always been, a part of Persia not Afghanistan. The former said that the Sudr Azim must suppose the British Gov ernment to be very ignorant of the real( 16 ) facts when he made such an assertion; hut that from the numerous travellers and British Officers who had visited the tract, it was well known to^the Afghan not Persian. Eventually he succeeded in dis pelling the idea of continued disasters having befallen British interests in India, to which idea much of t^he resistance of the Persian ministry was due. And on the 28th March the Sudr Azim promised that he would write a letter declaring, in the most formal terms, that the Persian Court disavowed entirely the reading of the khootbah and the coinage at Herat in the Shah’s name; and that if the ruler of that Province persisted in doing so, he did it altogether from his own perverse obstinacy, and contrary to the desire of the Persian Government. “His Highness promised also that Lash and Jowain should he forthwith evacuated by the Persian troops, and those two posts be restored to Ahmed Khan, from whom they were taken during the late hostilities. In making this last concession, His Highness pretended that he was sacrificing an undoubted right solely to evince his friendship for the British Government. “ Mr. Murray told His Highness in reply that he knew very well that he was only conceding a point which he could not maintain by any shadow of right or proof; but that he (Mr. Murray) would not quarrel with His Highness about mere words, or deprive him of the pleasure of conferring an imaginary favor, if he would only carry the measure into effect without further evasion or delay.” t frtt- /fa AasG u-*/ if t Ms-lstsu j-yyfa Cs-/' fait, Mj AjuZjy /2L /&lt;%/, ^ Ar*s*/tr 28. In fulfilment of the promise thus given, the Sudr Azim wrote* the next * Mr. Murray, to Lord Clarendon, dated April 1st, day a letter, of which the following ex- 1868 ' tract related to Lash-Jowain:— “By the artfulness and the misrepresentation of interested parties, certain points have been ren dered the subject of discussion on your side. * * * * * “ The most important question is that of Lash and Jowain, and the khootbah and coinage of Herat. With regard to Lash and Jowain, the Persian ministers always considered, and do now consider, these places as belonging to Kaianat and Seistan, the territory and property of the Persian Government; and no clearer evidence could be desired on this head than the fact of Shah Pusund Khan having been Governor there on the part of the Shah; of Ressool Khan, his son, having been sent to Teheran as a hostage; and also of the gov ernment of that place having been afterwards be stowed upon Sirdar Ahmed Khan in virtue of a royal firman. Had the Persian ministers con sidered that Lash and Jowain belonged to Afghan istan, they would before now have evacuated them in the same manner that they evacuated Herat andits Dependencies, in accordance with the stipulations of the treaty, with the greatest promptitude and willingness. Besides the above arguments adduced in these letters, there are other proofs which, if examined with the eyes of justice, can leave no doubt whatever on the matter. “ But as your Excellency is so urgent on this subject, and a continued persistence in (requiring) an investigation and enquiry would doubtless be attributed to other motives and views on the part of the Persian ministers, whose object being purely and sincerely (to possess) the friend ship of the British Government, they are perfectly free merely to gratify the British ministers and to cooperate with your Excellency that not the least point in amity and union may be omitted, they will make over Lash and Jowain, the un questionable territory of Persia, to Sirdar Ahmed Khan (son of Shah Pusund Khan) in whose hands they formerly were, and the Persian authorities will be withdrawn from these places.” * 3 ist March 1858. 29. Mr. Murray replied*— ^ /fa ^ •/-fa t Colonel Taylor’s memo. J Mr. Thomson’s account in Mr. Alison’s letter to Government of India, dated 21 rd December 1867. i I am at a loss to understand how your High ness can designate the evacuation of Lash and Jowain, and the cessation of the khootbah and coinage in the ShalPs name at Herat, as points ot discussion raised by the artfulness and misrepre sentation of interested parties, whereas they are plain and manifest stipulations of the treaty ot peace which the Persian Government had hitherto omitted to fulfil; indeed, there would have been no discussion at all on these subjects, if the acts of the Persian Government had been consistent with their words; it has chiefly arisen from their persisting in claiming, as Persian territory, two well known Districts imthe interior of Afghanistan.” ' . . , ,, , 30. Mcamidnlc, during the period that immediately preceded the Avar, Persian influence was rendered predominant m^ers- trrm in a much more quiet manner. The I^ovtocc, more especially that part of it which was possessed by Ali Khan, of Seh- koodah, was wearied of being made the bone of contention between Herat and Candahar. It had passed repeatedly, of late years, from the rule of one to that of the other, and “now desiredf to throw off the yoke of both neighbours, and to profess allegiance to a power which was so far off as to be incapable of enforcing obedience.” Ali Khan thought he might secure this by allyingt himself with the royal family of Persia. His first communications with the Persian Govern ment were carried on through the Governor of Kerman. The Prince Go vernor of Khorassan took umbrage at this, and persuaded Ali Khan to con duct the negociations through him, and for this purpose to send his son to Meshed. When the Sudr Azim heard of Ali Khan’s desire, he said that it might be arranged( 18 ) come to if Ali Klian were himself to Teheran. “ He did so, and, on Lis arrival, he and his suite were treated with great favor and consideration. They received presents from the Shah, and hand some allowances during their sojourn in Teheran. The Chiefs pay was fixed at 4,000 Tomans a year, and 3,000 Tomans more was paid him annually for Ibrahim Khan and other Chiefs. The title of Hissam-el-Mulk was conferred upon him, and shortly afterwards he was married to the daughter of one of the Kajar Princes. - ” 31. This was in 1857-58, and Colonel Taylor (British Commissioner in Herat), on the 2nd February of the latter year, sent to Lord Canning a Memorandum on the past history of the Province, which he accompanied with the following observa tions :— “ It appears that for the last few years the Go vernor has voluntarily tendered his allegiance to the Persian Government, but the rulers of Canda- har and Herat both claim that Province as a part of their dominions—the former as having been the last proprietor, the latter because Seistan has ever been allotted to Herat, and its temporary separa tion has been caused merely by the insubordination of a refractory Chief. “Upon the principle of the status quo ante helium, Seistan has by an accident become indepen dent ; but if it is thought that the increase of the number of independent petty Chiefs tends rather to promote insecurity and embarrassment, then the claim of the ruler of Candahar would seem to outweigh that of the ruler of Herat. “ It must be observed that the allegiance previ ously mentioned was paid to Persia before the recent war, and it may therefore be considered as unaffected by the treaty. But if the spirit of that treaty is to deprive Persia of all authority in Afghanistan, then clearly she must relinquish all claims to Seistan. Supposing that Persia is made to withdraw her protection, any decision arrived at by the Government will be attended to by the rival claimants. If pronounced inde pendent, both parties will respect their independ ence ; but if no such opinion is expressed, then must she fall to the lot of Candahar, as Herat is not prepared to enter upon so serious an under taking as coercing external enemies. “ Should Persia be permitted to continue the ex ercise of her influence in Seistan, she may have it in her power to propagate falsehoods to the pre judice of India, and, being so near the frontier of the latter, they could be freely circulated. On the other hand, if Seistan were the instrument of a friendly power, she might, when the occasion re quired, be made to inflict very serious injury to the commerce of Persia by disturbing her south eastern frontier and plundering all her caravans.” 32. The preparations made in the spring of 1858 to despatch a military force with Ali Khan on his return alarmed Mr.( 19 ) t &gt;- A Murray, the British Minister at Teheran, who, in the month of April, wrote to Lord Malmesbury as follows :—- “ Fov some reason or other the intention was relinquished, or at all events postponed ; but I think I can now state, with some degree of certainty, that the expedition will leave Teheran about the middle of next month, cons-isting of two regiments of regular infantry and a few field pieces under the command of the Serteep (Brigadier) Hussan Aly Khan, Avho is to be furnished, besides, with arms and accoutrements for the equipment of two thousand men whom he is to raise and drill in that Province, and a sum of money to be recoined in the name of the Shah, thus virtually annexing Seistan to the Persian kingdom. Seistan, hitherto con sidered, mapped and described, as an integral part of Afghanistan, occasionally independent, at other times a dependency of Candahar, is nearer to Candahar than Herat by 200 miles, and is also very considerably nearer the British Indian frontier of Sinde; in fact, it Persia be allowed to obtain a permanent footing there, our respective frontiers will be separated from each other by only a dis tance of 400 miles. u I propose, when the force is actually moving from Teheran, to call upon the Persian Government to explain the object of this expedition for the information of Her Majesty’s Government, leaving it afterwards to your Lordship to follow up the matter in any way you may think proper.” 33. On the 3rd. May he wrote again that the Government of India had “ turned their attention to the reported intention of the Persian Court to send a body of troops into Seistan, which would he a direct viola tion of treaty, the said District being a part of Afghanistan, and, in fact, much nearer to Candahar and the British frontier than Herat itself.” “ This,” he said, will give me an opportunity of asking an explanation of the Persian ministers on the subject. That their reply will be a direct untruth there is no doubt, as your Lordship will see when it reaches you, but which of the two they will elect I cannot forsee,—either they will deny that they have entertained any such intention, although the regiments are designal ed and under orders for marching, or they will boldly assert that Seistan is, and always has been, a recognized ap pendage to the territory of the king of kings, and that we have no right to interfere in any thing that His Majesty may be pleased to do there. Nevertheless, whatever be their line of argument, I expect that the multiplied disasters reported in my despatch No. 72 of yesterday’s date will compel them to abandon the project, at least for the present, and to employ in Khorassan, or near Asterabad, the regiments designed for Seistan.” The Government of India had sent their letter on the subject in the steam frigate Assaye. This had caused a great sensa tion, and Mr. Murray expected that the best results would follow.( 20 ) On^ the 5th May he addressed the Sudi\ * Mr - Murray, to Lord Malmesbury, dated Azim on the subject of the intended May ‘ expedition, and said he hoped the rumour of that intention was incorrect “ as the occupation of Seistan, which is a part of Afghanistan, by Persian troops would be a direct violation of the treaty of Paris.” The Sudr Azim replied on the 13th,— tc The Persian ministers have always consider ed, and do now consider, that Seistan, ah avtiqua, has formed an integral part of the Persian territory, and it is at the present time in the possession of the Persian Government, on whose part it is therefore not necessary that troops or soldiers should be sent, or a new occupation of the place effected.” Mr. Murray, May 15th, rejoined,— “The British Government cannot admit the correctness of this view, which is indeed contra dicted, not only by the political history of Seistan, but also by its geographical position, which is represented in every existing map, possessing any claim to authority, as forming part of Afghanistan. I am well aware of the nature of the evidence which the Persian ministers propose to advance in support of their claims to include Seistan in Persian territory; but it is evidence which is no more admissible than that by which Lash and Jowain were claimed, and by which probably Candahar itself might also be claimed. It is well known that Sirdar Ali Khan, the hereditary ruler of Seistan, when driven by his necessities to seek the aid of the Persian Government, was obliged, in return for the money and assistance afforded him, to hoist the Persian flag and to own himself the obedient servant of His Majesty the Shah. This took place several years ago, and now that Sirdar Ali Khan has been invited to Teheran, and has received the honor of a marriage with a Princess, he is entirely in the power of the Persian Government, from whom he obtained the promise not only of pay, but supplies of arms, and also Persian troops to assist him in maintaining him-&gt; self in Seistan. There is therefore no doubt what ever that he is ready to sign a paper declaring himself a subject and vassal, and his country a part of the territory of His Majesty the Shah. If such a paper is required of him he must sign it, for he has no power to refuse; but such a paper would obviously have no weight whatever with the British Govern ment, which well knows that Seistan, from the time of Shah Ahmed and his successors, formed part of the territory of the Afghan sovereign. In the time of Shah Kamran its ruler became indepen dent, and, although one of his successors may, in order to obtain assistance from Persia in the hour of need, have declared himself a subject or servant of the Shah, the Persian ministers well know that they have never levied the taxes or custom duties, or appointed and displaced Governors in Seistan, as they have done in all those Provinces which really form a part of Persian territory. r lhe British Government entertains no hostility what ever towards Sirdar Ali Khan, and, so far as I am informed, they have no objection to his being allied( 21 ) v .. * Mr. Thomson’s account enclosed in Mr. Alison’s letter dated 27th December, to the Government of India. t Mr. Murray, to Lord Malmesbury, 1st June 1868, and Taj Mahomed’s account in Mr. Alison’s letter dated 27th December, to the Government of India. by marriage with the Persian Court, or to his being on terms of the closest friendship with the Persian Government; but, on the other hand, it is my duty to inform your Highness that, if the Persian Government were to send troops into ; Seistan, a Province which is much nearer to Candahar, the centre of Afghanistan, and to the British frontier, than Herat itself, Her Majesty^s Government would consider such a step as being a direct violation of the treaty of Paris.” 34. About the same time* the French. Goyernment communicated to Lord Malmesbury a despatch from the French Minister at Teheran mentioning that, however strenuously the Persian Govern ment might insist on its right to Seistan, they would not at present send troops thither, or make any demonstration of rule or sovereignty there. Lord Malmes bury replied, describing the Persian inter ference with Seistan as an aggression. 35. Mr. Murray’s remonstrances were effectual. The Persian Governmentf con tented itself with sending a small force of 300 sowars and two light field guns ostensi bly as an escort for the Kajar Princess, whom Ali Khan took back with him to Seistan as his wife. ^ 36. During the next few months. Court of Directors, No. 1974 , dated 20 th the Sudr Azim had to contend J against a strong attempt to oust him from power. He triumphed; but, almost immediately afterwards, died. 37. His policy, however, as regards Seistan, survived him. Mr. Doria, who had now succeeded Mr. Murray, sent on 27th October to Lord Malmesbury the fqllow- ing translation of the instructions, which he found had been given to Mahomed Saleh Khan, Koord Bachah, Commander of the escort sent with Ali Khan: — “ From what has lately been reported to us, it appears that Shureef Khan and Ibrahim Khan (Seistan Chiefs hostile to Sirdar Ali Khan) had recently sent an Agent, named Sheer Khan, to Teheran to communicate confidentially with the English mission and minister, and that he had been furnished with a letter of recommendation to the authorities at Candahar, desiring them to afford any assistance or support that might be demanded. Now you will, on receipt of this firman, lose no time in carrying out the instructions sup plied to you by the late Sudr Azim, Meerza Agha Khan. You will send for horsemen and match- lockmen from Kain and the frontiers of Toon and Tabass, and give all the assistance that may be necessary to Sirdar Ali Khan; and you null be firm, and prevent any opposition being made by Ibrahim and Shureef Khan. If the troops and. horsemen and matchlockmen from these places should be insufficient for the purpose, you will at once send )( 22 ) information that such is the case, in order that instructions may be issued for reinforcements to be despatched from Khoi'assan.” 38. Taj Mahomed, ex-Chief of Seis- tan, has described what followed :— Mahomed Saleh Khan, Koord Bachah, was also accompanied by a Persian instructor, and had with him clothing- for soldiers and the tools re quired for coining money. On reaching Seistan money was struck in the Shah’s name, and a regi ment raised and drilled by the Persian instructor. Meanwhile, the other Chiefs and the Seistan peo ple were greatly dissatisfied with the cruelty and injustice practised by Ali Khan, and they engaged Taj Mahomed Khan* to put an end to this state of things, and to avenge himself for the inhuman treatment to which his two elder brothers had been exposed, by being both deprived of sight by order of Ali Khan. Taj Mahomed Khan accepted this task, and, having introduced himself at night into Ali Khan’s room, where he was in bed with his wife, he attacked him with his sword. His uncle was awake, and attempted to make his escape, but he was cut down, and the Princess was slightly wounded in the arm.” 39. Mr. Doria askedf what the Persian ministry proposed to do. He was told that the Shah— “ intended to issue orders to the Governors of Kain and Kerman to hold in readiness a number of troops to march on Seistan for the punishment of Taj Mahomed Khan and all concerned in the assassination of Sirdar Ali Khan, in the event of the people of Seistan refusing to deliver over to the Persian Government the perpetrator of the murder.” 40. Mr. Doria’s reply was as follows :— “ After this unreserved declaration, I recalled to His Excellency’s recollection that Her Majesty’s Government considered Seistan as forming part of Afghanistan; that sending troops therefore into that Province would be considered a direct and open infringement of the treaty of Paris; that, although the late Sudr Azim had endeavoured to assert that Seistan was a Province of Persia, his attempt had not altered the views of Her Majesty’s Government on this subject; 'that the entire blame connected with the unfortunate connection of a Persian Princess with Sirdar Ali Khan rested with the late Sudr Azim; that evidently there was no intention of inflicting injury on Her Royal High ness, as she would otherwise have been killed when trying to save her husband’s life. I urged His Excellency to weigh well the consequences which might ensue from such an imprudent step as send ing troops to Seistan, which could not fail to be viewed with deep dissatisfaction by Her Majesty’s Government. I repeated again and again to His Excellency whether it was not better to waive a pretended right to Seistan than to risk forfeiting the friendship of England; and having used every argument I could to induce His Excellency to prevent such a course, I finally begged of him to be the bearer of my representations to the Shah, and, with all respect and deference, to entreat His Majesty at least to postpone so decided a proceeding in a matter which might involve such serious * Mr. Doria, writing to Lord Malmesbury, 1st November 1858, said, Taj Mahomed was leagued with the Governor of Kain. The Ameer Shere Ali, on the other hand, remarked, in January 1870, that “the Cabul authorities caused the death of Ali Khan in consequence of his being proved a well-wisher or partizan of the Persian Govern ment.”—[ Cabul Agent, to Commissioner of Peshawur, 23rd January 1870. J + Mr. Doria, to Lord Malmesbury, 10th November 1858. .( 23 ) &gt; 1 results, until I could learn from your Lordship the views of Her Majesty^s Government/^ 41. The Persian Minister for Poreign Affairs replied— “ That the Persian Government had determined on sending- a person to bring back the Princess, widow of Sirdar Ali Khan, and Mahomed Saleh Khan who accompanied her to Seistan; that should Taj Mahomed Khan allow these two persons to return, and should he treat them with respect on their departure; should Taj Mahomed submit, as Sirdar Ali Khan had done, to acknowledge himself a servant of the Shah, the Persian Government would then overlook his present culpability; but if, on the contrary, he should forcibly retain the Princess and Mahomed Saleh Khan, and behave disrespectfully to them, and should he refuse to obey the orders of Persia, then the Persian Government will certainly take steps to punish Taj Mahomed.” 42. Mr. Horia rejoined as follows :— “ I must now repeat to your Excellency the opinion I have already stated in conversation, that sending any sort of troops into Seistan would cause Her Majesty^s Government much displeasure. Mr. Murray long since urged upon the Persian Government the absence of all right on their part to send troops into that Province, and stated that such interference was in direct contravention of the treaty of Paris. The late Sudr Azim also, after the reiterated representations of Mr. Murray, diminished the number of troops which he finally ordered to Seistan, and it is the very reprehensible policy of Meerza Agha Khan which has alone caused the present catastrophe and position of affairs in Seistan.” ’* Mr. Thomson’s account in Mr. Alison’s letter to Government of India, 27th December 1867. Mr. Eastwick, to Mr. Alison, ISth December 1862. 43. He wound up Ids despatch by saying- “ I am glad to find that my arguments have had such weight as to induce the Persian Govern ment to postpone their intention of sending troops from Kerman to Seistan. I had little doubt that, should the Governor of Kain be called upon by the Shah to send troops to Seistan, he would not hesitate to leave the order unobeyed.” 44. When* the papers were communicat ed to the India Office, Mr. Eastwickf drew up a precis showing that Persia was not so undoubtedly in the wrong, as had been hitherto held, in the assertion of her claim on Seistan. 45. Lord Stanley endorsed this memo randum with the following remarks :— “ The general conclusions from the facts noted on the preceding Memorandum appear to be that Seistan has been for ages, and from a period even antecedent to the dawn of history down to the death of Nadir Shah in 1747, an integral portion of the Persian Empire ; that it was colonized by Persians ; and that, while at least a moiety of the population is still Persian by descent, the whole of the inhabitants are allied to that country by various ties, such as similarity of manners, dress, &amp;c. »( 24 ) ■ \! / “ It further appears that Seistan can in no sense be included in Afghanistan, being inhabited by a different people, who are, for the most part, Sheahs like the Persians, and not Sunnis like the Afghans, who speak a different language from the Afghans, and who have never yielded more than a nominal obedience to the Afghan rulers, except to Ahmed Shah, and that only for a period so short as would not invalidate the claim of sovereignty on the part of Persia—a claim based on the two titles recog nized by international law, viz., first occupancy and uninterrupted possession.^ 46. To the view thus formed, Lord Stanley gave practical expression by writing* to the British Minister in Persia that— “ there was reason to regret, with reference to the asserted claims of Persia to sovereignty over Seistan, that so much had already been advanced in opposition to those claims, and that he was of opinion therefore that, if the discussion of the subject should be forced upon the mission pending further instructions from England, it would be equally just and politic to adopt a less decided tone than that used by Mr. Murray in his recent con troversy with the Persian Government.' * See Mr. Eastwick, to Mr. Alison, 18th Decem ber 1862. * £•* ■&gt;\ ' Q 1861 - 2 . ] ( 25 ) Section III. IX v. * The Cabul Diary of 28th April 1861 shows that Shureef Khan was contemplating this step. A servant of Taj Mahomed brought the news to Meshed, and said that Shureef Khan had first of all taken Koodbar which belonged to the Belooch, and had then come on to Jehanabad, in Seistan, and taken it also. “ The Province,” it was said, “was under three Governors,—Mahomed Keza Khan at Sekooha ; (2) Ibrahim Khan at Khanjor (Sheikhnassoor); (3) Maho med Shureef Khan who resides in the fort of Alum Khan. The Governor of Meshed wrote to all three telling them to be firm in maintaining their position till news came from Teheran. This Shureef Khan of Boorj Alum Khan is on a few other occasions mentioned. I have not been able to gather any particulars regarding him, except that he is a Belooch. t No reply was sent by the Government of India to Mr. Alison. The alarm which Dost MahomecVs advance on Furrah and Herat caused the Persian Government, and the correspondence which followed, 1861—1863. 47. Mr. Alison (May 20th, 1861) wrote to Lord Clarendon to say that the Persian Court were disturbed by news 5 ** that Mahomed Shureef Khan, Governor of Eurrah (Dost Mahomed’s son) was, under the pretext of punishing certain Beloo- ches who had plundered Candaharee territory, contemplating an attack on Seistan; that Persia had no doubt hut that Seistan belonged to her;— cc Yet with the sole view of being agreeable to the British Government, Persia had desisted from formally occupying that Province, and had contented herself with its nominal dependence, lor which, indeed, she had hostages from among the principal families there. _ But the Persian Minister proceeded to say, the British Government cannot, injustice, expect Persia to submit quietly to the invasion of Seistan by a foreign power ; and should she be reduced to the necessity of sending a force to Seistan in order to repel it, the British Govern ment must not expect that she will afterwards willingly listen to any demand for its evacuation. The king, he concluded, would take it as a strong proof of the friendly feeling of the English Minister and his Government if, without its appearing to be a suggestion from another quarter, Mr. Alison would write to the Viceroy of India respecting the expected aggression by Dost Maho med Khan's son, and would also address a letter to that Chief calling upon him to abstain from pass ing the Seistan frontier. * * * * “ The king and his ministers attach the great est importance to the views and opinions of Her Majesty's Government on this subject, and there is no doubt that a friendly understanding between, the parties concerned in it would be a relief to all and a benefit to the Province itself.' 48. Mr. Alison feared that, if Khoras- san was denuded of troops, the Turcomans would plunder it. He therefore urged that there might he no such movement of troops, and said— “ the Persian Government may afford to wait for^ a more propitious period in carrying out her policy with regard to Seistan.' 49. He sent a copy of this despatch to the Governor General,! and intended to convey to Shureef Khan his opinion of the course he was meditating. 50. On the 14th June 1862, Mr. Alison wrote to say that Persia was alarm ed by the dispute between Dost Mahomed and his nephew, Ahmed Khan, of Herat; that the Host’s growing power menaced( 26 ) danger to Persia. He had gained posses sion, first of Cabul, then of Candahar, then of great part of Turkestan and Maimena. He would now take Herat and would then wrest Khorassan from Persia. That Court then being interested in the maintenance of the status quo, called on the British Government, according to the spirit of the treaty, to mediate between the parties, and thus maintain that status. Mr. Alison replied that he would lay this request for mediation before Her Majesty’s Govern ment, and the Persian Minister appeared satisfied. 51. Here it seems proper to mention that shortly after the conclusion of the treaty, the possibility of some such question arising had been anticipated in India. Lord Canning’s Government, on the one hand, wrote to Dost Mahomed urging him “ to observe a policy corresponding to that which the Government of Persia is bound to follow ; to respect the independence of Herat under its established ruler, Ahmed Khan, and to abstain from all interference with its internal affairs but at the same time concurred with Sir J. Lawrence, Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, in thinking that, if the Ameer should at any time disregard this advice, and if, in conse quence, differences were to arise between him and the ruler of Herat then it would not consist with the policy of the Government of India, or with what were believed to be the intentions of the Home authorities,” to exercise any interference whatever. [ Paragraph 8 of No. 1558A., dated 6th June 1868, to Government of Punjab, enclosing a letter to the Ameer Dost Mahomed. ] 52. Later on, in 1862, while Mr. Alison was away from Teheran, in his summer re treat, Mr. Eastwick, Secretary of Legation, wrote to him (20th June 1862) saying that the Persians again expressed their fear of an attack on Herat by Dost Mahomed, and that they begged that, in the spirit of the treaty of Paris, the English Government would mediate between the rulers of Herat and Cabul, and would send a Commissioner, accompanied by a Persian Commissioner, to arrange matters between the two Chiefs. Mr. Eastwick said, in reply, that— “ according to the 6th Article of the Treaty, the English Government was not bound to mediate, except in cases when the Persian territory was infringed, and that the present contest was an internal one between Afghans themselves. [ 1862.A v y ( 27 ) 1862.] “ The Persian Minister said^ that it was under pressure from England that Persia bound herself to leave the Afghans independent ; hut that he was assured by the English Ministers that in case of need England would befriend Persia by restraining the Afghans from disturbing the Persian frontier. The present war would be carried on on the frontiers of Persia, and the Afghan forces would be so numerous that there was not only a probability, but an absolute certainty, that they would make an aggres sive movement against Persia, more especially when they find Persian cannon and Persian coins in Herat. “ Persia knew the Afghans too well, and could not forget that they had once conquered Persia, and, having begun in a way like the present, ended by occupying Isfahan. “ In a word, if England declined to act the part of an ally, the Persian Government must send 20,000 men to the frontier towards Herat.'’' , 53. On tlie 28tli June, the Shah him- * See his despatch of soth June. self sent for Mr. Alison* and made a renewed statement of the apprehension with which Dost Mahomed’s advance filled him, and of the evil which would hefal Persia if all Afghanistan were to he united under one ruler. f Lord Russell, in his interview with the Persian envoy, shewed that this position was untenable. 54. On the 10th July, he again wrote to report the increasing alarm of the Per sians. This time they had an argument to shew that, under the treaty of Paris, the time had come in which England was hound to intervene. By the 6th Article of the Treaty, England had hound herself to removef all just cause of umbrage on account of the Afghans. Such cause of umbrage was now given by the advance of Dost Mahomed, which the Persian Gov ernment could not believe would stop at Herat. 55. There was, Mr. Alison thought, some reason for this apprehension ; for he had— “ no doubt that the connection between the Persian Government and the ruler of Herat, so contrary to the spirit of the treaty, is known to Dost Mahomed, who may ascribe the capture of Furrah by the Heratees to the influence of Persian counsels : and hence the natural disquietude of the king.” 56. In No. 139, dated 24th August, Mr. Alison reported that Bakir Khan, who had been sent— “ by the Prince Governor of Khorassan to the camp of Dost Mahomed Khan to demand, on the part of the Persian Government, the object of the( 28 ) Dost*s advance into the Herat territory^ has been f 1862. told by the Dost that Sultan Ahmed Khan hav ing- been the real aggressor in attacking Furrah, he had marched upon Herat for the purpose of punishing this aggression by capturing and annex ing that country to the Cabul dominions. This was the sole object he had in view in the expedition he had undertaken/-’ £)7. In No. 140 of the same date, he said that the Shah had been much disap pointed by the British Goyernment’s reply to his representations, and had ordered his representative to discuss the subject in London. 58. A small body of horsemen had been sent by the Persians to guard the Pass of Kohsevia, within Herat territory, as a slight protection to the Province of Khoras- san. They were now, with considerable reluctance, withdrawn by the Persians. 59. In No. 151, dated September 9th, Mr. Alison wrote that information had been received from Khorassan that— “ Dost Mabomed had sent troops into Seistan in order to demand forced contributions for his army, and otherwise to interfere in the internal affairs of that place; that as Seistan was one of the Provinces belonging to Persia, the King's Go vernment could not submit to such a proceeding on the part of the Dost; that, before this step was taken, the question bore reference to the 6th Arti cle of the Treaty of Paris, but now its bearing turned upon the 7th Article, and therefore the Persian Government had determined to demand reparation from Dost Mahomed for this act of aggression, and instructions would be sent to the Prince Governor of Khorassan that in the event of full satisfaction not being afforded, he was to com mence hostilities at once against the Afghan force/' 60. Mr. Alison urged that hostilities should not be commenced without consi deration of any explanation that might be offered regarding Afghan designs on Seis tan, the rather that Host Mahomed had disavowed all intention of provoking a quarrel with Persia. 61. Whatever may have been Host Mahomed’s schemes as regards Seistan, there was about this time a counterplot on the part of the Persians. It is narrated in a letter dated 23rd August, from Colonel Holmage, at Meshed, to Mr. Alison. He says,— “ Some time since I informed you that Sirdar Ahmed Khan, the Governor of Lash-Jowain, had fled from thence and arrived here. Since then the Prince has been hatching a pretty little plot with him, which, after some trouble, I have found out. The Prince proposes to give him cannon, guns, &amp;c.,1862 .] ( 29 ) provided lie holds Lash-Jowain under allegiance to the Shahj and also undertakes to bring over Seistan, where he has great influence. In further ance of this plan the nephew and son-in-law of the Sirdar, by name Sultan Mahomed Khan, left this yesterday, en courrier, to have an interview with the Shah on the subject. 62. On the 13th September, Mr. East- wick, who had been sent to Meshed to watch the movements of Dost Mahomed, wrote to ask (with reference to Mr. Alison’s instructions that if Dost Mahomed invaded Persian territory he was to communicate with him) whether— “ the two Provinces,—Lash-Jowain and Seistan,— are to be considered as Persian territory ? “ In a letter from the Sudr Azim, which forms an enclosure to Mr. Murray’s despatch No. 51 of April 12th, 1858, to Lord Clarendon, Lash and Jowain are spoken of as belonging to Seistan—the territory and property of the Persian Government. Lash and Jowain have, however, been virtually indepen dent ever since the time of Shah Pusund Khan, the grandfather of the present ruler. Shah Pusund Khan assisted at the murder of Putteh Khan, Dost Mahomed^s eldest brother, and probably on account of this blood feud, Ahmed Khan, the present Chief of Lash and Jowain, is now a fugitive at Meshed. He has sent his nephew to the Shah to ask support, which, I hear, will probably be granted. “ The Persian claims to Seistan are founded on the fact that this Province, from the most remote ages down to the death of Nadir Shah, was almost uninterruptedly a Province of Persia. Since then it has been at times a dependency of Cabul and Candahar, at other times of Herat and Persia, hi 1834 Kamran conquered Heist an, but he himself acknowledged fealty to Persia. From 1853 Seis tan has owned allegiance to Persia, and in 1858 Ali Khan went there as Governor on the part of the Shah and coined money in his name. Specimens of these coins are in the possession of Her Majesty's Government. The Seistanee Chiefs received 4,000 piastres yearly from the Persian Government as pay, and a certain Gul Mahomed Beg, and another person, whose name I have not learned, are now in Meshed to receive arrears of pay, and to ask whe ther the Shah will assist them against Dost Ma homed. It may be added that the two principal tribes of Seistanees are Persians by descent, the Belooches, who are utter barbarians, being modern immigrants. The true Seistanees are Sheeas, and naturally cling to Persia rather than to the Af ghans. Under these circumstances I request to be informed what steps I should take if Dost Mahomed invades Seistan. The question is urgent as the Ameer has intimated his intention of occu pying the Province as soon as Herat is taken.' \ 63. Mr. Alison (September 19th) re plied,— f&lt; With regard to Lash and Jowain, Her Majesty's Government are clearly of opinion that they are not Persian territory, and you will remember that in fulfilment of the treaty of Paris, Persia was H X k «( 30 ) \ r obliged to evacuate these Districts^ and hand them over to Ahmed Khan, in whose hands they formerly were. “ Persia certainly claims Seistan as forming a part of her territory, but, according to all accounts, she does not exercise any authority over it.” 64. He sent a copy of this reply to Lord Kussell. 65. On the 29th September, he wrote again to Mr. Eastwick,— “ I have received no reply from England on the subject of Seistan. My own view of the question is that, although Seistan may not be bond fide a Persian Province, Persia persists in claiming it as such, and any interference with it, or attack upon it, on the part of the Dost, might be reasonably viewed as a gratuitous attempt to pick a quarrel with Persia and force her into hostilities.” 66. Mr. Alison (October 20th) in formed Lord Itussell that he had received a reply to a letter which he had written to Host Mahomed, expressing a hope that no complications would arise calculated to give consistency to the apprehensions en tertained by the Persians. Host Mahomed’s reply was, that he would undertake no movement of any kind which could be come the cause of apprehension in men’s minds. Mr. Alison showed the letter to the Persian Ministers, who merely remarked on the royal style adopted by the Ameer. 67. Eight through the autumn, ru mours reached the Persian Court which made them believe that the English Gov ernment would stop Host Mahomed’s con quest of Herat. And simultaneous rumours reached the embassay that Russian inter vention would he sought by Persia, if the English Government failed to accept the Persian view of the treaty obligations, and put pressure on Host Mahomed to induce him to abandon the siege of Herat. 68. On the 10th October, Mr. Eastwick sent Mr. Alison the following statement of the sums annually paid by the Persian Government to the Chiefs of Seistan, in return* for which they undertook “ to 'prevent the JBelooches from entering Persia on plundering expeditions by the route called the Haftad Koh” :—• [1862. f A ( / ►- A * Mr. Eastwick’s statement confirms the account given by the Vakeel of Ibrahim Khan, of heikhnassoor, to Colonel Phayre, in January 1869, that, till within the last four or five years, the Shah of Persia, in order to protect his trade and the eastern border of his kingdom from Belooch raids, used to pay a small annual subsidy to the following principal Belooch Chiefs :—Ibrahim Khan, Shureef, Shere Dil Kummul, and Emam Khan. £( 31 ) 1862,] Statement of Annual Disbursements to the Chiefs of Seistan by the Persian Government.

Some horsemen had also come to the frontier of Kahrez from the Dost’s camp, and had carried off 150 camels and 10 or 15 prisoners.” Mr. Eastwick added— “ Uadi Khan, Ghias Khan’s nephew, on his way here saw the Persian flag flying on the chief fortress of Seistan, and informs me that he believes it is still hoisted there and in token of dependence on Persia.” 69. On tlie 18th December, Mr Alison sent an account of a long interview with the Shah, for which he had asked, because the danger of hostilities between Persia and Afghanistan seemed imminent. The Meshed Agent had reported that there had been already mutual infringement of terri tory,^ and the Ameen ood dowla had said that— “his Government would never remain passive while that f stinging hornet’ was so near,—assailing now their lips and now their eyes. Short of war with England, whose friendship Persia highly prized, every effort would be made to remove Dost Mahomed from the Persian frontier.” 70. The Shah himself said similarly— “He prized the friendship of the English Government highly ; but, so long as Persia had a soldier or a toman left, she would struggle to free herself from the Afghan incubus on the frontier of Khorassan.” 71. He then turned to the question of Seistan and asked— “ whether Mr. Eastwick had written to his Go vernment on the subject, and whether the Govern ment had expressed an opinion. He said that it was stated in a late despatch that Her Majesty’s Government did not recognise the claims of Persia to beistan. The Shah said that Seistan formed part of his dominions ; that at all events it could not be said to be part of Afghanistan ; that he had been told that it had been laid down in someEuropean maps as a portion of the Afghan terri- tory, but that he could not accept those maps as any proof whatever; and that, in a word, he should consider the invasion of Seistan by Dost Mahomed as a casus belli and opposed by force” 72. Mr. Eastwick expressed his “ opinion that, as regards Seistan, the pretensions of Persia are not altogether without founda tion,” and, in support of that opinion, refer red to his own memorandum in 1858—59. Eor the expression of Lord Stanley’s views thereon see supra paras. 45, 46, 73. On the 19th December, the Meshed Agent wrote,— “ On the 10th December, the Prince Governor of Khorassan returned to Meshed, and two days afterwards he held a public salaam. I was present and heard one of the officers of Kohendil Khan, of Seistan, the brother of Taj Mahomed Khan, who had arrived a few days before, state to the Prince that if His Royal Highness required Seistan he^ should send soldiers and ammunition. The Prince ordered one regiment and several camel loads of ammunition to be given to them to take to Seistan. Abbas Khan, Colonel of Herat, was to proceed with the Toorsheez Regiment to £&amp;ses. /Cct-c 7 X- These two regiments were ordered on this service in my presence.” 74. During the spring of the next year, 1803, the aim of the Shah’s Government was to keep up resistance in Herat by giving out that England was about to unmuzzle Persia, and allow her to inter fere in Herat matters. (This is especially shewn in Mr. Thomson’s despatch of May 19th). After Herat had fallen, the aim was to foment discontent and or ganize a rising against the Afghan garri son in the city. These attempts were met by a strong remonstrance from Lord Bussell.—(See especially Mr. Alison’s des patch of 5th December 1863.) 75. As regards Seistan, Mr. Thomson reported (June 19th) that— “Kohendil Khan, a brother of Taj Mahomed* Khan, who is the present ruler of Seistan, arrived in Teheran a short time ago. It appears, Mr. Thomson said, that his visit is in connection with the operations of Dost Mahomed Khan in Afghanistan, and it is probable that the line of conduct which the Chiefs of Seistan will shortly have to decide upon with respect to these proceed ings, will be very much influenced by the result of the communications which they are now holding with the Shah’s Government. “Since the murder of Ali Khan, the former Chief several years ago, the Government of Seistan has been held by Taj Mahomed Khan, and during this period the Persian Government have continued by affording him, from time to time, pecuniary aid, and by occasionally conferring dresses of honor upon the Chiefs, to exert a certain amount of * Taj Mahomed’s own accounts of this mission and of the Persian authorities attempts to get him to impede the siege of Herat, is as follows:— “ When Dost Mahomed Khan was besieging Herat the Hissam-es-Sultaneh (Prince Governor of Khorassan) wrote repeatedly to Taj Maho med Khan to harass, as much as possible, the Cabul force, to cut off their supplies, and to allow them no repose. He declined to carry out the Prince’s wishes and even received an agent sent to him by Dost Mahomed Khan; but when this was reported to the Persian Government, they despatched an agent selected by Ferrookh Khan to prevent the Seistan C. hief from coming to an understanding with the Afghan ruler. This agent brought presents and dresses of honor to Taj Mahomed Khan and the other Chiefs, and returned with assurances of his fidelity and devotion to the Shah. One of Taj Mahomed Khan’s relatives having also been sent to Teheran, undertook to return to feeistan with Persian troops, and the Shah issued orders that the Keraee regiment should be des patched at once to that place; but Taj Mahomed Khan heard of the above arrangement in time to prevent its being carried out, and the Persian regi- ment was not allowed to move from Beerjend, the Chief having explained that the arrival of Persian troops in Seistan would cause general alarm to spread amongst the population.”i 1 \ u \ , s &gt; * \ ( 33 ) 1863.] influence indirectly over the principality. In return for these favors the Seistan Chief had, I am informed, hoisted the Persian flag 1 at the capital of Seistan; but the Persian Government have never taken upon themselves any direct interference in the Local Government, nor have they exercised any real authority over that country. The proximity of the Cabul troops to the frontier of Seistan and certain threats which have already been used by the Ameer have given rise to the belief that the place will shortly be annexed to Dost Mahomed Khan’s possessions; and Taj Mahomed Khan has now sent his brother to Teheran in order that the nature of the connection now existing between Persia and the Seistan Chiefs may be more clearly defined, and that the material support, if any, which they may expect to receive from the Shah in case of an attack by the Dost may be precisely ascertained. The Persian Ministers, who have treated Kohendil Khan with great kindness during his stay in this place, have given to him and his followers dresses of honor, and have grant ed a salary of 3,500 tomans to the Chief of Seistan, whom they have invited to visit Teheran. But, as far as I can learn, though they have been liberal in their promises of support to the Seista- nees in the event of the Dost attempting to occupy their country, these promises have been of so vague and uncertain a character that it may be assumed that the object which they have in view at present, in their negociations with the people of Seistan is to encourage them to offer resistance to the Dost, without committing them selves to any formal engagement to support their cause by force of arms.” 76. On the 8th July, the notedly-un- reliahle Meshed correspondent wrote that Mahomed Ameen Khan (the brother of Shere Ali, who was killed at the battle of Kujbaz) had been despatched at the head of an Afghan force against Seistan. Meerza Saeed Khan, the Persian Minister for Poreign Affairs, told Mr. Thomson that— tl this expedition had been ordered by Dost Mahomed Khan, but that it had been subsequently relinquished in consequence of that Chiefs death. Meerza Saeed Khan added, that the Afghans were certain, sooner or later, to renew this project and to attempt the occupation of Seistan; but that the Persian Government considered that country to belong to the Persian dominions, of which it formed an integral part, and that they would not hesitate for a moment, should Afghan troops enter Seistan, but would at once despatch a force to resist any such aggressive movement. In answer to my remark that the sovereignty of Persia over Seistan had never been recognized by the British Government, His Excellency stated that this was because there being no mention of Seistan in the treaty with England. Persia would not forego her claims in the matter, but would maintain her right to that Province even should hostilities with the Afghans ensue.” 77. Oi^the 26th August, Mr. Thomson reported (on the strength of the Meshedcorrespondent’s letter) that the Seistan [1863. Agent, who had lately visited Teheran, had, on his return journey to his own coun try, applied to the Prince Governor of Khorassan for a military force and a supply of ammunition to he despatched from Meshed to Seistan. Mr. Thomson un derstood— “ that the Persian Government would not decline to comply with this request, should it be repeated by the Chief of Seistan himself, as far as regards a supply of ammunition.^ 78. This was (the Meshed corre spondent said) the answer of the Prince Governor of Khorassan : he said, too, that quite lately Taj Mahomed had asked Ahhas Khan, the Persian Governor on the frontier of Herat, to march into Seistan for the purpose of resisting the anticipated attack of the Afghans: “but the rest of the Seistan Chiefs, and the prin cipal people of the country, would not hear of such an arrangement, and refused to allow the Persian regiment to enter the country.^( 35 ) y. k &gt; i &gt; &gt; l * l \ 1861 .] \J/p' ft t&lt; /UjZatlL Stv 7%Ae Je £i-+x— a ?/i£r/y- — dt ^ /&lt;f i/^, &lt;?* Si 14 AL /Ztt. ^ OZ&amp; , sAL /tffi */Si - ^ S' Cy/*.* jfczAL yij Si///^ /ifca f /Lcc+~ /Pl St f'/l * t &lt;£ S y£/?Zc /*^C- /?su-£) st r T &gt;+~/’ &lt; - —// /2^&lt; /Ar/i^ *2/^vAtL-7 ,1^ o/t^ &gt; P ^ e * r ^ c *SAZr A tV S^^yfyAsye^p^ ^ c^-'//A?**rr 4~i/?r3 sAZs'i /9&amp;*e^ _ -/&lt;ev p/Xr/f-r// Section IV. The views expressed by Tier Majesty’s Government during the period from 1861—1863. 79. By No. 1 (Secret), dated January 2nd, 1861, Sir C. Wood sent to the Indian Government correspondence between the Persian ambassador at St. James’s and the Poreign Office, called attention to the threatening aspect generally of the poli tics of Central Asia, and asked for an expression of the views of the Indian Government thereon. 80. The Persian ambassador had, among other requests and proposals, beg ged that— the British Government should establish it as a principle that Cabuh. Ca ndahar, and Herat, should each become a 'single and independent State, and that at no time should any one of them be allowed to increase its power to the detriment of the others.” 81. Lord Bussell had answered— iC Her Majesty’s Government have already de clared that their only wish is to see Afghanistan independent of all foreign influence, whether that country be divided among several Chiefs, or be united under a single ruler; and Her Majesty’s Government have stated it to be their policy to remain at perfect liberty to take, on any emergency which may arise, the course they may think best, and in the meanwhile to avoid interference in the internal arrangements of Afghanistan. They have assured His Majesty the Shah that they would exert their influence to prevent any aggression, against Persia from that quarter.” 82. In No. 5, dated 26th September 1861 (Secret), Sir C. Wood again requested Lord Canning, before retiring from the Government of India, to put him in pos session of his views on the pending state of affairs in Afghanistan and other parts of Central Asia, and said— &lt;C I learn from the reports of Her Majesty’s Ministers at Teheran that the Government of the Shah have frequently complained of threatened aggressions on the part of the Ameer Host Maho med Khan, through his sons, upon territory alleged to be subject to Herat. Your Lordship is aware that the treaty of Paris binds the British Govern ment, c at all times to exert their influence with the States of Afghanistan, to prevent any cause of umbrage being given by them, or by any of them, to the Persian Government.’ Your Excellency will therefore, whenever fitting occasion may arise for the exercise of your friendly offices, en deavour to dissuade the Ameer Dost Mahomed and the other Sirdars of Afghanistan from undertaking or encouraging any hostile demonstrations against the territory of the Heratee ruler. But, from such information as I have now before me, I am( 36 ) led to infer that there is at least as much to he [1862. apprehended from aggressions upon Afghan terri tory by the more Eastern States, as from encroach ments in an opposite direction by the sons of the Ameer of Cabul. t( It is the desire of Her Majesty’s Government to abstain from all interference in the affairs of Afghanistan; nor do I contemplate any step being taken beyond friendly advice if an opportunity should occur when it may be given without the risk of giving offence to the ruler of that country.” I have not been able to find that any sncb exposition of bis views was sent by Lord Canning in answer to tbis call. 83. Again, by No. 2 (Secret), 3rd June 1862, SirC. Wood forwarded a letter dated 22nd April, from Mr. Alison, to Lord Russell, saying—• “ The re-capture of Furrah by the ruler of Herat would most certainly be made a pretext by Dost Mahomed Khan for an attack on Herat directly the roads became practicable. In such a case Persia could not remain a passive spec tator; and the Shah was therefore very anxious that I should lose no time in bringing this subject to the notice of Her Majesty’s Govern ment in hopes that they would take immediate steps for preventing any movement on the part of the Dost towards the Herat territory. Persia con siders Furrah to belong to Herat; and indeed, in a report which he drew up on Seistan in 1858, Colonel Taylor alludes to Furrah as having been taken from Herat by the ruler of Candahar on the death of Yar Mahomed Khan.” 84. Sir C. Wood therefore requested that, with advertence to the terms of the treaty of Paris, Lord Canning would take— “any steps to dissuade the Cabul Sirdars from undertaking or encouraging any hostile demonstra tion against the territories of the ruler of Herat that may be called for by the circumstances of the case and the position of affairs upon the receipt of this despatch.” 85. Hy No. 5 (Secret), dated 10th September 1862, Sir C. Wood sent copy of further correspondence between Mr. Alison, the Poreign, and India Office. The gist is contained in the following words of the India Office letter to the Poreign Office, dated 11th August 1862 :— “ It appears from the latest intelligence furnish ed by Mr. Alison that the forces of the Ameer Dost Mahomed Khan had taken Furrah on the 6th ultimo; that subsequently they were reported to be marching upon Herat; that the Government of the Shah anticipated their invasion of the Per sian frontier; and that Mr. Alison had been solicit ed to obtain the good offices of Her Majesty’s Government to arrest the surmised aggressive movements of the Cabul force across the Persian frontier. With reference to this information, I am directed by Sir Charles Wood to observe( 37 ) 1862.j ^ ia l h e can see 110 reason for believing that v Dost Mahomed contemplates any aggressive operations against Persia. The strife, so far as events have hitherto unfolded themselves, is be- , ( tween two Afghan principalities, and neither the British nor the Persian Government is justified in interfering so lon&lt;r as the war is confined to Afghan territory. If, however, there should appear to be any probability of the Ameer of Cabul intending to cross the Persian frontier, and to carry the war into the Persian dominions, Mr. Alison might, in the opinion of Sir Charles Wood, very properly remonstrate against such pro ceedings and express to Dost Mahomed the strong disapprobation with which his aggressive move- ments against Persia are regarded by the British Government/^ 86. By No. 6 (Secret), dated 26th September, Sir C. Wood sent a fresh in stalment of similar correspondence. Mr. i Alison had mentioned the Shah’s uneasi ness at Dost Mahomed’s moyements. lie was before Herat, and was said to he tam pering with Seistan. The Persian Govern ment had sent to Dost Mahomed to de mand reparation for these proceedings in Scistan and to threaten war. Docs (Mr. Alison ashed by telegram) Government consider Seistan a Persian Province ? Thereupon the India Office replied to the Poreign Office, that Sir G. Wood did not— “ see in the apprehensions of the Shah of Per sia that Herat may fall to the besieging force of the Ameer Dost Mahomed, any reason for modifying the ^ opinions, which he was already expressed, as to the inexpediency of interfering in the internal affairs of the Afghan States. With respect to the other statements in the telegram, I am to observe that, in the opinion of Sir Charles Wood, they are too vague to call for any action on the part of the ■ ' British Government, under the terms of the 6th Article of the Treaty of Paris ; and, indeed, as re gards Seistan, it does not appear from the records of this Office that the sovereignty of Persia over . that disputed territory has ever been acknowledged by the British Government.^ 87. With the above despatch was sent copy of Lord Bussell’s despatch to Mr. Alison, dated 25th September 1862, giving an account of His Lordship’s interview with the Persian envoy to the Porte. The n*&lt; envoy contended that, under the treaty of 1857, Great Britain was bound to re move all causes of outrage and dispute between Persia and Afghanistan. No, said Lord Bussell, not to remove them, but to endeavour to compose such differences, and Mr. Alison had already been requested to use his good offices for this purpose. * 88. The envoy then said that— ff if we did not choose to interdict to Dost Maho med Khan the siege of Herat, the Persian K( 38 ) Government hoped we would allow them to use their [1862-3. own forces to prevent the capture of Herat. “ Lord Bussell replied, it would not he just to say the ruler of Herat may attack Dost Mahomed as much as he pleases, but Dost Mahomed shall not be at liberty to attack Herat in his turn. If Dost Mahomed should get possession of Herat and assume an attitude threatening to Persia, then certainly Persia, subject to the provisions of the treaty, might take up arms to defend herself against aggression on the part of Dost Mahomed.'’'’ 89. The next despatch of Sir C. Wood is No. 7, dated 10th October 1862 ; but this contains nothing additional. 90. On the 30th October 1862, Lord Bussell wrote to Mr. Alison that the Per sian Minister at Constantinople, then in London, had— addressed to him an official note stating that as Dost Mahomed, not content with attacking Herat, required also the submission of Seistan, which is* an integral part of Persia, the Shah now claims of Her Majesty’s Government the execution of the 7th Article of the Treaty of 1857, which stipulates that ‘ in case of any violation of the Persian fron tier by any of the States referred to above {i.e., of Afghanistan), the Persian Government shall have the right, if due satisfaction is not given, to undertake military operations for the repression and punishment of the aggressors/ “ Lord Bussell thereupon observed that as Her Majesty’s Government do not recognize the sovereignty of Persia over Seistan, they cannot ad mit that the demand said to have been made by Dost Mahomed for the submission of Seistan, constituted a case in which, under the 7th Article of the Treaty, they can be called upon to acquiesce in any military operations being undertaken by Persia against Afghanistan.” 91. With No. 1 (Secret) of 18th March 1863, Sir C. Wood sent out fresh correspondence. The Persian Govern ment had put certain fresh propositions before Mr. Eastwick at Teheran. Their tenor is summarized in the following re ply dated 11th March 1863, of the India Office, which had been consulted in the matter:— “ These propositions are three in number: the first request is, that the British Government should require Dost Mahomed to turn back from Herat f leaving it to any one else, Persia cares not to whom, even to an imbecile and ill-disposed per son like Saujid Mahomed, the son of Yar Maho med/ With respect to this, I am directed to state that Sir Charles Wood is of opinion that so long as the operations of the Ameer Dost Maho med are confined to Afghan territory, the British Government is not called upon in any way to interfere. By the withdrawal of their agent from the Ameer’s camp, the Government of India have already indicated that they do not countenance the * The Persian Clmrgi d’Affaires now says, it hag been so for the last five years, i.e., was not so in 1862 .1863.] movement towards the Persian frontier * but, be yond this. Sir Charles Wood is not of opinion that it is incumbent on the British Government to take any steps of the kind indicated by the Persian Government. “ With respect to the second proposition, I am instructed to state that Sir Charles Wood is of opinion that it would not be expedient to add another Article to the Treaty of Paris ‘ guaran teeing to Persia the integrity of the frontier towards Afghanistan, as it at present stands/ “ The third proposition is, c that Persia will be allowed now to make her preparations for war by levying troops and other suitable measures/ Upon this subject Sir Charles Wood can only observe that if Persia considers that her frontier is in danger, it does not appear to him that the British Government can properly object to her making internal preparations for its defence; but he thinks it might be as well to warn the Govern ment of Persia that she must be careful not to suffer any aggressive movements into Afghan territory, or otherwise to provoke hostilities between the two countries. This would be beyond the case contemplated in Article VII. of the Treaty of Paris/' 92. A despatch in this sense was sent by Lord Enssell to Mr. Alison, dated 20th March 1863, and copy was sent to the Government of India in Sir C. Wood’s No. 2 (Secret), dated 2nd April. 93. Luring the remainder of this year, and the beginning of the next, there was more correspondence between the English Minister at Teheran and the Foreign Office regarding the strained relations between Afghanistan and Persia, but the cause was not any territorial claims of either party, but the facilities which the Turcomans enjoyed of making raids on Persian terri tory through the lands of Herat. 94. On the 5th November 1863, Lord Kussell wrote the important despatch giv ing permission to the Persians to assert their right to Seistan by force of arms. It was as follows :— “ I have tbe honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter on the 20th ultimo, in which you call the attention of Her Majesty's Government to the apprehended invasion of the territory of Seistan by the Afghans, and requesf ing that an assurance might be given to you that Her Majesty's Govern ment would not permit any such invasion of Persian territory. “ I have the honor to acquaint your Excellency, in reply, that Her Majesty's Government, being informed that the title to the territory of Seistan is disputed between Persia and Afghanistan, must decline to interfere in the matter, and must leave it to both parties to make good their possession by force of arms.'95. I have not yet diseoyered any thing to shew that this despatch was com municated at the time to the Goyernment of India, which apparently first received a copy as an enclosure in Mr. Kaye’s letter dated 22nd April last; nor have I been able to find out what caused Lord Kussell to make an announcement differing so radically from the decision communicated in his despatch of 30th October 1862, and from the counsel given by Sir C. Word in the letter of 11th March 1863, which counsel was accepted by Lord Kussell, and embodied in his despatch to Teheran, dated 20th March 1863. Pos sibly the cause was the receipt of Mr. Eastwick’s views as to the claims of Persia on Seistan [see paragraph 72]. Mr. Eastwick had before this been recalled, and was now able to support his views by representations at head quarters. [1863.( 41 ) 1864.] &gt; t Section Y. The quiet occupation of Seistan by Persia from 1864 to the end of 1867. 96. On the 28th January 1864, he wrote as follows :—• “ I am informed by tbe Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Persian Government have decided uj)on sending Mahomed Saleh Khan, Koord Bacheh, to Seistan, where he had formerly been employed, but that the Persian troops would not enter that Province unless an aggressive movement were directed against it by the Afghans. “ The Persian Government was determined, His Excellency said, to resist any such movement, and it was therefore to be hoped that Shore Ali Khan, if he desired a further extension of his power and territory, would turn his attention to Bokhara and Turkistan in the north, instead of making any attempt to acquire possession of Seistan, which would only result in disastrous consequences to himself and his Government. “ The Minister evinced some surprise that the ShalPs Minister in London should have accepted in silence the communication respecting Seistan, enclosed in copy in your Lordship's despatch to me, No. 25 of the 5th of November. Instructions had been forwarded to Mahmood Khan to re-open this question at the Foreign Office.' 97. Among the items of information regarding Persian proceedings in Seistan collected by Sir H. Green, Superintendent,^ Sind Frontier, is the following :—• (( During the year 1864 the Persian officer in charge of Meshed wrote to Mahomed Ameen Khan, then ruler of Candahar, informing him that a Persian force would be stationed in Seistan merely for the purpose of maintaining the safety of the roads for the passage of merchants. Mahomed Ameen Khan agreed to this arrangement, but no force was despatched.' 4 Mr. Alison, to Lord Russell, dated 22nd March 98. In February 1864, the jMeshedf 1864 ‘ A gent wrote— “ Of the three regiments ordered to Seistan, the Khelij Regiment, under Jehan Mahomed Khan, has already left, and it is said that the Toorbet Regiment is also under orders to march. They ai’e also sending four guns to that place.' 99. On November 28th, | he wrote again that the Belooches (subjects of Ibra him Khan of Sheikhnassoor) had been grazing their flocks “as usual” on the plains of Kain. There was a fight, attended with some loss of life, between them and the Kainees, whereupon Meer Alum Khan, the Governor of Kain, marched into Seistan and attacked the Belooches. 100. On§ the 28th August 1865 the Shah personally handed to Mr. Alison a L * Sir W. Green, to Government of India, dated I6tli October 1867. 1 Mr. Alison, to Lord Russell, dated 13tu December 1864. § Mr. Alison, to Lord Russc 1, dated 20tk August 1865. U( 42 ) memorandum, on the subject of Seistan [1865. containing the following remarks:— , cc Although the British Government consider Seistan as a disputed territory between Persia and Afghanistan, the Persian Government great ly regret that the British Government should have come to such a conclusion. Arguments in support of Persians ownership of that country have lately been laid before the British Gov ernment, besides which, in order to remove any further doubt, Persia lost no time in notifying to that Province that it belonged to her, and it is in fact clearly proved to be in her possession. “But should the Afghans, now that they have got over the affair of Candahar, attempt to meddle with Seistan, Persia will feel it her duty to con- ^ sider such a proceeding just as if it were directed against Khorassan, or any other portion of her dominions, and will therefore be entitled to deal with it accordingly. ***** “ A long time has not yet elapsed since Persia perceives, to her extreme joy, that the tissues of dispute have been cut asunder. “ If the British Government should state that their advice in endeavouring to restrain the ambi tious aggressions of the Afghans would be fruit less, the faith which Persia has in the effect which such advice, firmly given, would produce on the minds of the Afghans, will still induce her to hope, nay to feel certain, that such advice will be attended to. “ Should the British Government therefore also appreciate the present agreeable condition of things as regards that frontier, and the satisfac tory state of their relations with Persia, and reci procate the aversion felt by Persia to an opposite course, it would be highly desirable that they should not object to use their good offices with respect to the Afghans, so that through their friendly advice Persia's hopes of maintaining Seistan in its present state may not be thwarted. The British Government would thus prevent a useless difficulty and endless complications. “ If England Ms really no interest in these suspicious and dangerous occurrences (in Afghanis tan), and they will not affect her present or future policy, Persia will be at once relieved of all doubt and will know what course to adopt.' 101. It is clear then that up to this time Persia had not thought of acting on the permission conveyed in Lord llussell’s despatch of 5th November 1863, to assert her claim to Seistan by force of arms, and was indeed rather disposed to feel dis appointment at the tenor of that des patch. 102. On the 21st August, Mr. Alison telegraphed* as follows to the Viceroy : * From Mr. Alison, to the Viceroy, dated 21st August 1865. “ The success of the Afgans at Candahar has alarmed the king about Seistan. An early assur ance, therefore, that you will dissuade Afghanistan( 43 )• 4' i b * } b - 1865. ] * From Foreign Secretary, India, to Mr, Alison, dated 23rd August 1865. from any aggression on that disputed territory, is desirable in every respect/-’ 103. Sir John Lawrence replied*— “So far as the Viceroy can judge, the Shah need he under no apprehension about Seistan. The Ameer of Cabul has fully as much on his hands as he can manage in his own country/^ 104. The Secretary of State was in formed of the message and the reply, in . No. 116, dated 31st August 1865. 105. And in No. 160, dated 8th No vember, the Government of India thus wrote regarding the Shah’s memorandum of 20th August, copy of which had been sent by Air. Alison :— “ So far as the Government of India can judge, the Afghans have no designs on Seistan, and, at any rate, have no power at present of prosecuting any such measures with the view of acquiring possession of that Province/'’ 106. On 28th October 1865, the Meshed Agent wrote that Ahmed Khan, Governor of Lash-Jowain, who had been for several years in receipt of a salary from Persia, had now “ arranged matters” with Shere Ali, and that he had married the daughter of Ibrahim Khan, who had also taken over his half of Seistan to Shere Ali. 107. It is to be observed that this stii June. rapproachment of the Chiefs in Seistan and Lash-Jowain followed the battle of Kujbaz, in which Shere Ali was victorious, though with the loss of his eldest son: and his consequent re-occupation of Candahar. 108. Then followed the time when his mind was affected, when his enemies recovered ground, and when his capital was taken from him. f Mr. Alison, to Lord Clarendon, dated 10th. January 1866. 103. Persia took the occasion to make an armed advance into Seistan. On the 26th October 1865,f the Aleshed correspon dent wrote that, three days before, a regi ment of cavalry, another of infantry and two guns had started for Seistan by Kain, where they were to pick up four more regi ments and four guns. These they were to take into the Province, where they were to build a fortress. The cause of this move ment was (the Meshed correspondent said) an indicated intention on the part of some Afghan Chiefs to seize the occasion of their master’s temporary insanity to make a move in the direction of Seistan. Most improbable. At no time would Shere All’s adherents be less disposed to assert Afghan claim in Seistan, than when rivals for %( 44 ) power were gathering strength, and their [1866. master was losing his hold over events. L In the Cabul diaries there is no allusion to any such intended move. 110. Mr. Thomson, in his summary of events in Seistan (dated 11th December 1867), gives, in words open to misconcep tion, another account of the cause which led Persia to make this advance into Seis tan. lie says it was— cc with the avowed object of retaliating* upon Azad Khan, JBelooch, who had plundered the Per sian District of Kain/ J 111. This is, I suppose, the Azad Khan of Kharn, father-in-law of the Khan of Khelat, who figures so largely in the troubles of that country. But why should Persia retaliate upon him by seizing Seis tan—a Province over which no Khelat or Kharan Belooch had ever any claim ? The account of Mr. Thomson’s informant [Taj Mahomed, the ex-Chief of Seistan] is as follows. According to it the Persian occu pation of Seistan was not exactly a mea sure of retaliation on the Belooches, but was explained and justified to the Seistan Chief as intended to enable him to keep the Belooch raiders in check :—• “ A quarrel took place between Ibrahim Khan, Belooch, and Taj Mahomed Khan, respect ing some territory claimed by both, and shortly afterwards the people of Seistan made an incursion into the territory of Azad Khan, Belooch, whence they brought away a large amount of property. This was followed by an attack made upon Kain in Persia by Azad Khan, who passed through a portion of Seistan to that place. Taj Mahomed Khan heard of this expedition, and had prepared his troops to intercept Azad Khan on his way back with his booty, but the latter was informed ol this, and took another road. Intelligence of this reached the Sepah Salar, then Prime Minister of Persia, at the same time that the Persian Agent, Mahomed Saleh Khan,* arrived in Teheran from Seistan somewhat dissatisfied with Taj Mahomed Khan's proceedings, and he, having been consulted in the matter, it was decided to despatch troops to Seistan,and eight regiments were designated for this service. Taj Mahomed Khan's confidential agent, however, succeeded in explaining satisfactorily how the attack by Azad Khan had been made, and the part which the Seistan Chiefs had taken in the matter ; and the Sepah Salar was persuaded to defer sending troops into Seistan, lest it should alarm the inhabitants and cause them to ally themselves with the Afghans. The Persian Minister was recommended, if he wished to occupy Seistan with Persian troops, to despatch some of his agents to the place to force the way by ex plaining to the Chiefs and people the reasons for their entering the Seistan territory, and this advice was followed. Mahomed Salah Khan, Koord Bachah, had this duty entrusted to him. He See enclosure of letter from Her Majesty’s Minis ter in Persia, dated 23rd December 1867.

X In the Cabul diary dated 20th—30th July 1S67, it is mentioned that on arriving at Meshed the Shah told off a force of 16,000 men for Seistan. ( 45 ) proceeded to Meshed with letters from the Sepah Salar to Taj Mahomed Khan, stating- that the Persian Government proposed to despatch two regiments to Seistan; but that they had no other object in view than to support him against the Belooches; that they had full confidence in him ; and that the troops would be placed under his orders to act against Azad Khan and his people as he himself directed. Taj Mahomed Khan^s brother, Kohendil Khan, was detained as a hostage in Teheran, though he was ostensibly treated as a guest; and Mahpmed Salah Khan, Koord Bachah, meanwhile advanced to the frontier of Seistan with the Keraee regiment from Meshed and the Kaianee regiment from Beerjund. Thence he sent on a firman from the Shah and letters from the Sepah Salar explaining, as above, the object he had in view. Taj Mahomed Khan assented to his entering Seistan with the troops, but Ibrahim Khan de clined to have anything to say to the Persians, and even withdrew from some forts which he occupied on the left bank of the Helmund to his own District on the left bank. The Persian offi cers did not interfere in any way with the Seistan people on their affairs at first, and whatever they required they paid for. “ Five regiments in all were marched into Seistan.'” 112. Sir H. Green’s account* is that the Persian force (numbering 6,000 men with 12 guns) arrived under Salah Maho med Khan, Koord Bachah (who has been already mentioned) in June 1866. In July 1867, it was replaced by a force of 4,000 men with 12 guns under Meer Alum Khan, of Kain. 113. In April 1866, the Governor of Kerman was also sentf into Seistan, in order (the Minister for Foreign Affairs told Mr. Alison) to settle some differences be tween the Chief of that country (Ibrahim Khan?) and the Ameer of Kain. But the Meshed correspondent (6th May) said that he had come with six guns, four regi ments, and 10,000 Kainees, whom ho settled in the frontier, exacting revenue from the Afghan ryots. ’ he added, “ was of Imam Khan, Afghan, but it has now come into the possession of the Kainees, and they have erected four large and strong forts in Seistan 114. Prom Taj Mahomed’s account, given to Mr. Thomson in December 1867, it would appear that his brother, Kohendil Khan, was, during this period, detained as a hostage at Teheran. 115. In the spring of that year he him self fell into tea toils. On the occasion of the Shah’s visits to Khorassan he was invited to Meshed. His own account is M “ This Afghan frontier, formerly under the power ^ rtyyu( 46 ) that his people refused to let him go, hut [1867. he at last got away without their know ledge ; was for a time deluded by promises, but was at length seized and, with his brother and uncle, sent off as prisoners to Teheran. Sir H. Green says that Ahmed Khan, of Lash-Jowain, with others of less note, was deported to Teheran at the same time. (Sir H. Green, to Government of India, dated 13th November 1867.) 116. On the 1st October 1867, Mr. Thomson ' wrote that these detenus (the * Mr, Alison, to Lord Stanley, dated 22nd October Chief of Seistan and his brother) had been 1867 - told that they would not be permitted to return to their own country, but would receive for the present an allowance of 700 tomans a year. 117. The news from Seistan was that the Ameer of Kain had attacked Ibrahim Khan,— “ who had been forced to evacuate the forts which he held on the left bank of the Helmund Kiver, and had retired with his people to the right bank. The Persians had likewise crossed the Helmund, and had captured the fort of Nad Ali, and they now intended to attack Sheikhnassoor and other strongholds in Ibrahim Khan's pos session.' 118. Mr. Alison spoke on the subject to the Persian Minister for Poreign Affairs, who said— “that the Persian Ministers did not consider From Sir C. Alison, to Lord Stanley, No. 107, the Helmund to be their line of frontier in that &lt;iate(i 2 ‘ jU(i October ib67. direction. Seistan, he said, was divided into two districts,—one, until lately, had been held by Taj Mahomed Khan, and the other by Ibrahim Khan, Belooch. Both of these belonged to Persia, and were in no way connected with Afghanistan. And, as he was aware that Ibrahim Khan had for some time been refractory, it was not at all im probable, in the opinion of the Minister for Poreign Affairs, that the Ameer of Kain might have advanced beyond the Helmund to restore order into that country. “ It is now reported in Teheran that the Ameer of Kain had renounced his intention of advancing upon Sheikhnassoor, and that he had re-crossed the Helmund, leaving only a few men in the fort of Nad Ali. He is said to have adopted this course in consequence of remonstrances addressed to him by the Afghan Governor of Purrah, Sirdar Afzul Khan.' 119. Sir H. Green (9th December 1867) wrote that Ibrahim Khan had as yet re fused to pay allegiance to the Persians, and had applied to the pro tern Ameer of Cabul, Azim Khan, for assistance, but that this had been refused.! + Azim Khan’s reply was, that he was not suffi ciently powerful to oppose the forces of Persia. He advised Ibrahim Khan to apply to some other power more able to afford him assistance.—(Sir H. Green, to Government of India, 9th January 1868.)( 47 ) 1867.] The Persians had destroyed the fort of Sekooha, the capital in the time of Taj Mahomed, and many other small forts which might form centres of resis tance, and were building a large fort themselves a little north of Sekooha. The only tax levied by the Persians was said to he one head of cattle in every forty. v * &gt; . ✓( 48 ) Section VI. Persia’s further advance, and raids into the terri tory of Sheilchnassoor, Pur rah, and Candahar, from end of 1868 to present date. 120. On the 14th January 1869, Colonel Phayre reported that Ibrahim Khan had written to him, imploring British assistance against the Persians, who had already taken half his territory and were advancing day by day. Colonel Phayre learned from the Vakeel that bore the let ter that, within the last three or four years, Ibrahim Khan had been deprived by the Persians of the southern portion of his terri tory on the right bank of the Helmund, including the forts of Jellalabad, Jehana- bad, and Nadali, the latter captured only a few months ago. 121. They then advanced along the Helmund to Hosseinabad,* which was, Colonel Phayre showed, “ well selected, both for defence against the Seistan Belooch on the opposite bank, and for commanding the several lines of route that radiate from Seistan eastward, viz., thqt by Shorawak and the valley of the Lora, to the Pesheen Valley and Quetta, and the kafila route to Nooshky. “ The former of these two routes is well watered and supplied; the latter is desert, as described by Captain Christie in Pottinger’s Travels in Beloochistan; but the difficulties are not insur mountable by a body of horse, if led with the de termination of reaching the plains of Kutchee by Khelat and the Moolla Pass, thereby turning the Bolan altogether. i( Kafdas with wool and wheat frequently travel from Seistan to Nooshky and Kharan at the present time. “ All the forts on or near the Helmund, between Hosseinabad and Deshtuk, have been captured, and either dismantled or occupied by detachments of Persian troops, according to their utility as links in the chain of rear communication. ff Tn short, the Persian is faithfully imitat ing the Kussian mode of advance to the Oxus, as well as the measures now under adoption by that power to establish its river communication between Charjoee and the Sea of Aral. “ Troops and materiel are transported from the north-western extremity of the Lake from Persian territory into the Helmund, near Heshtuk, and thence up river to Hosseinabad. The boats used are at present of the rudest description, made of skins and mats. The Helmund is very deep throughout, and at Deshtuk 300 yards broad. It is usually crossed in rough rafts, or inflated skins. It will not take Persia Ion 0, to remedy all this. ° 1868-9.] Political Proceedings for March 1869, No. 196. * The accounts brought hack by Captain Grey’s emissaries (who travelled in the country last autumn and winter) throw doubt on this statement. Persia had not, according to them, yet advanced as far as Hosseinabad, though even in the immediate neigh bourhood it was generally and strongly believed that they had. “The chief of the place was one Naib Ali Azim Khan, a man of considerable position and influence, who, ‘ from his proximity to the Persian border,’ had constant relations with them, but by no means carried them to the extent of submission or of admission to their troops. He merely kept on good terms with them and strengthened himself. His fort was well provided, and he well able to maintain himself.” They heard that the District of Sekooha, three marches to the west, was certainly under Persian rule, and that there was a Persian police post there, but no military force or garrison, nor had their informant “ even heard of any such having been there.” e. * &gt; \ ~ i v 1( 49 ) 1869.] “The Belooch, on the other hand, having no means of navigating the Lake, cannot interrupt the rear communication of their enemy. They are, in fact, driven into a desert tract away from the Helmund. Ibrahim Khan's fort, however, of Sheikhnassoor is 120 miles north-north-west from Hosseinabad; and, being watered by the River Khash, he is better situated than some of his neighbours. “ The Vakeel further states that only a few months ago the Persians commenced intriguing, with a view to possessing themselves of Lash and Jowain, the important strongholds on the Furrah at the head of the Lake; but that, on a representation made by Meer Shore Ali Khan to the Shah of Persia, to the effect that Sirdar Ahmed Khan, the Chief of Lash, was a feuda tory of Cabul, and his territory a dependency of Herat, further attempts to gain possession of that strong position were abandoned.' ***** Colonel Phayre farther submitted— cc That, in a strategical sense, and with reference to the well known ambition of Persia towards Afghanistan, her occupation of Hosseinabad is a flank movement of incalculable importance. “By it she completely turns Herat, Furrah, and Lash-Jowain, neutralizes them, in short, without endangering her rear communications. “ Politically speaking, she lays the axe at the root of Afghan neutrality and independence, be cause in Seistan she holds a more dominating position than her possession of Herat and Furrah would have afforded her. “ The occupation of Kheirabad, about 40 or 50 miles higher up the Helmund, during the present year, will greatly consolidate these well-laid and ably-executed plans; and there can be no doubt that such will take place, unless some powerful preventive be immediately interposed. * * * * * “ The present information dispels at once the idea, so long prevalent, that impassable deserts in terpose an insuperable barrier between Persia and Khelat. On the contrary, the facts under report show that from a base in Persian Khorassan, which is a highly-productive country, a large army can advance by water for nearly 200 miles to Kheira bad, whence to Candahar is only 150 miles, or the Bolan, 230: both routes being well-watered and supplied.' 122. On the 19th and 20th April, Sir W. Merewether telegraphed that the ex-Ameer of Cabul, Azim Khan, and his nephew, Ahdool Rahman, had arrived at Roodbar, on the Helmund, and then joined a large force of Seistanee Belooches assembled in Persian interests with 80 of the Shah’s horsemen; that detachments of the force had come as far as Jummoo, causing great excitement at Nooshky and on Beloochistan border; that Persian power was supreme in Seistan, and its in* tentions towards Khelat were aggressive.r ( BO ) 123. On the 23rd he telegraphed that, [1869* from later news, it appeared that the Afghan refugees had dissuaded the Seistan force from entering Khelat territory. 124. The contents of these telegrams were communicated to Mr. Alison, who (28th April) replied that the Shah dis avowed all knowledge of, or participation in, the movement in Seistan, to which they referred. 125. The Cahul diary of 24th Feb ruary mentioned that Shere Ali Khan, Governor of Candahar, had written to say that some Seistanees had committed a raid in Candahar lands, and had carried off 1,000 cattle, and 14 or 15 households. The Ameer represented the matter to the Gov ernment of India with, it was observed, the following object:— “ Seistan was formerly included in Afghanistan, From Commissioner and Superintendent, Pesha* and for some time, owing to the rulers of Afghan- mu DiT i sion &gt; dated 27th February 1869. istan having been unable to pay attention to that Province, the hakim of Seistan has acted indepen dently. Now, in consequence of Seistanee aggres sions, the Ameer desires, in event of Seistan being held to be separate from Persia in the treaty exe cuted between England and Persia, to recover that Province and bring it under Afghanistan. The Ameer will certainly introduce the subject on the occasion of his approaching interview with His Excellency the Viceroy.” 126. In the Cahul diary of 29th April 1869, there is again mention of this raid. Shere Ali Khan, Governor of Can dahar, had written saying that 3,000 of the Persian horse occupying Seistan had carried off 1,000 cattle from Candahar territory. He then— “ addressed their commandant, and stated that, if Cabul diary for half week ending 29th April 1869. the plundered property was not given up to its owners, a disturbance would ensue. On this his request was partially complied with and carried into effect; but before it could be fully carried out, Sirdar Mahomed Azim Khan and Abdool Rahman Khan (the refugees who were just then passing through Seistan) went to the commandant and induced him to return the remaining cattle and sheep, because Ameer Shere Ali Khan had become sub servient to the British Government, and gone to make his bond to the Governor General in Hin- doostan. This being so, Afghanistan had become a land of infidels, or out of the faith.” 127. He confirmed this news in all particulars by a still later letter. 128. In the end of March, Afzul Khan, Governor of Purr ah, wrote to Ibra him Khan, Governor of Herat, narrating the hostile encroachments of Alum Khan, Ameer of Kain and Persian Governor of * \1 1 1869.] Political, A., Proceedings, June 1869, Nos. 368—69, page 4. * &lt; k . &gt; Section 3 of despatch, ✓ ( 51 ) Seistan; his attacks on Sheikhnassoor, which were clearly within Afghan terri tory ; the remonstrances which he (Afzul Khan) made; his raid of 1868 when he lifted 200 camels belonging to Candaharees; his two recent raids when he lifted 800 and 400 camels more; and the probable loss of Ahmed Khan’s forts (in the Lash-Jowain country). 129. The Persian Government’s atten tion was by telegram drawn to this. Mr. Alison (17th May) telegraphed in reply that no authority had been given for any raid of the kind, and that all knowledge of any such movement was denied. 130. The Ameer’s instructions in the matter to Afzul Khan, of Eurrah, were as follows:— cc Your views about the fort of Sheikhnassoor are quite correct, but Sheikhnassoor is a place only in a country, and the real question relates to all Seistan, which from of old belonged, and belongs, to the Afghans. You have to consider this. This garri son which holds Sheikhnassoor under orders of Alum Khan, holds a post inside Afghanistan. Seistan was and is ours, and we do not and will not give it up. You should discuss this with Ameer Alum Khan, so that ostensibly terms should remain between you, but in such a manner as to prevent further aggression, and to guard against their getting any pretext out of what you say for announcing — c very good, Sheikhnassoor is yours, but Seistan ours/ I am interesting myself in this question of territory, and am writing to the English Government. As you are not in such strength as you should be, temporise with Ameer Alum Khan and preserve your f purdah/ When my army is in order, we can then talk of this matter to the Governor of Meshed and Shah of Persia; for the Shah’s family has of old behaved kindly to my family, and, by God's blessing, no one shall interfere with Afghan borders, and they (Persians) will relinquish the tract under dispute/' 131. The Government of India included mention of these aggressive movements in their despatch No. 178, dated 10th June 1869, on the general subject of Persia’s encroachments to the eastward, and said—• “ The Ameer gives utterance to a very decided opinion that Seistan belongs to Afghanistan, and it appears to us possible that the Ameer may attempt to put forward his claims to that tract of country whenever he may find a fitting oppor tunity/' 132. On the 12th June Mr. Thomson wrote to the Viceroy, saying— (1), that in the matter of the raid which, it was said, had lately been committed on Candahar from &gt; I 4( 52 ) ? V, Persian territory, the Shah’s Govern- [1869. ment had written to the Ameer of Kain, now Governor of Seistan,— “ warning him to beware of doing any thing which could give umbrage to the Afghans, or compromise the Persian Go vernment in their relations with the Chief of that country (2), that the Shah was made very un easy by the news of the Viceroy’s reception of Shere Ali at TJmballa; that though— “ Shere Ali Khan had hitherto been a very good neighbour to Persia, and had on various occasions acted a friendly part in stopping the incursions of the Turkomans from the Herat line of frontier, it was almost certain that the reception given to him by the Viceroy and the assistance in money and arms which he had lately ob tained from the Government of India would enable him, in a short time, to bring the whole of Afghanistan under his sway; and knowing the character of the Afghan people, it was impossible for the Persian Government to overlook the probability that such an event might produce a marked change in his dealings with this country. The Shah would, therefore, feel greatly relieved if the Viceroy or Her Majesty’s Government could give some assurance to the Persian Government, after the recent visit of Shere Ali Khan to Umballa, that he did not entertain any aggressive designs with regard to the Persian territory either in the Province of Khorassan or in Seistan.” 133. Mr. Thomson added that—• ,f The anxiety felt by the Persian Ministers was on account, not of the Province of Khorassan, but of Seistan, where, of late years, they have obtained a position which, they fear, the Chief of Afghanistan may now be disposed to dispute.” 134. At the beginning of September* there arrived at Cabul one Syud Abool Hussunf with letters (merely complimen tary) and trifling presents for the Ameer and his son, Yakoob Khan, from the Prince Governor of Meshed. He had pre pared his way by a letter to the Meer Moon- shee of the Cabul Government, saying—■ that he was on his way to Cabul wneTely with a view to see his friends and relations ; that he had nothing to do with the affairs of Persia, or the Cabul Government.” 135. Some of the Sheeah Cabulees be gan to visit him frequently. The Ameer’s suspicions were aroused, and he prohibited their visits. Moreover, Abool Hussun ob jected J to the smallness of the allowance given him, and thus offended the Ameer, who cut his stay in Cabul very short. * Diaries of 7tli, 9tli, 10th, 13th, 14th, and 16th September. + He was a Candaharee who had gone to Meshed, and ha,d there become a Sheeah.

It was probably a mere letter of compliment. 136. In September, Huhoolla Khan, Noorzai, wrote from the lower yalley of the Helmund to the Ameer as follows :— Cabul Diary of SOfch September 1869. “ The orders of the son of the Meer of Kainee for the release of 1,800 camels belonging to the Noorzais, that were seized by the Belooches, have not been complied with by the aggressors. Six hundred of the best camels have been kept by the Meer of Kain, and the remaining have been granted to his servants. I cannot, therefore, let my herds go out. Should you consider it advisable, kindly write to Sirdar Shere Ali Khan, Governor of Candahar, to collect his troops; also permit me to do the same. I hope that, by the help of God, and your prosperity, we shall be able to turn the Belooehes and the Meer of Kain out of Seistan. Also write a recom mendatory letter to Sirdar Meer Afzul Khan, directing him at the same time to join me and my levies at hurrah after my arrival in Gurrum- * The rich tract, averaging two miles in breadth, Seyl/'’* along the lower course of the Helmund.—[Conolly in Asiatic Society’s Journal, 1840, page 713.] 137&gt; The Ameer gent ^ letter to Syud Abdool Hussun, the envoy from Meshed, who said he would inform the Persian Government of its contents. t Cabul Diary, 1st to 4th October 1869. Cabul Diary, 5th to 7th October 1869. 138. At some time previous to this, it is clear that the Ameer had forbidden the injured parties from making retaliatory raids, for, in the end of September, Shere Ali Klian,+ Governor of Candahar, wrote as follows to the Ameer:— “ In compliance with your orders prohibiting the people of Gurrum-Seyl, Mul Khan, and the Noorzai levies of Ruhoolla Khan from proceeding to Seistan and Kain aggressively, I beg to state that I immediately issued the purport of the above orders to the influential men of the tribes con cerned. Meer Alum Khan is doing much mischief, and the Afghans and Belooches are much oppressed. 'Meer Alum Khan, as you know, last year seized 1,000 camels of the Noorzais. Recently there was a difference between the Belooches and the people of Seistan, and, although the former are opposed to us, yet, ou account of the tyranny of Meer Alum Khan, they take shelter in our country/'’ 139. Shere Ali’s son, Governor of Girishk, wrote about the same time that though the Seistan ees committed aggres sion, his people remained passive, only adopting measures of self-protection, and that he had advised the Seistanees to do the same. &gt; \r ( 5 ^ ) 140. A little later tlie Ameer received [18G9. the following letter from the above Kuhoolla:— “ You were kind enough to direct that we should Cabul Diary for half week ending 27th December get back our cattle, and we should not act 1869, aggressively. You have probably been informed that the Belooches have recently plundered eight herds of camels, and have again, last Wednesday, carried off the remaining camels. What could the sufferers do ? We went after the aggressors last Thursday, hut could not trace them, as they have taken off the camel men also. One man has, however, obtained his release. The aggressors have taken off all the camels from Tungee, and we await your orders. You can send this to His Highness the Ameer, in order that he may issue proper instruc tions on the subject.” 141. The Ameer, after perusal of this letter, remarked as follows :— &lt;{ The subjects of the Persian Government, Cabul Diary for half week ending 27th December through short-sightedness, have made raids upon 1869. the cattle and property of the Cabul Government, and I have informed the officials of the British Government of these matters in full detail; but without their cooperation, I can do nothing. These short-sighted people, without seeing some such action, will not desist from their wicked acts, otherwise, on my side, my subjects of the Gurrum- Seyl, if not restrained, are quite able to avenge themselves upon these people.” “ In short,” observes the British Agent, “ the drift of the Ameer's remarks appears to indicate that the British Government should enter into some arrange ment with the Persian authorities regarding this matter, or else intimate to the Cabul Government that its subjects are at liberty to take their own revenge.” 142. The envoy from Meshed about this time drew up a draft Convention for the restitution of plundered property and prevention of raids. The Ameer detected in its wording an attempt to make him admit that Seistan was not Afghan terri tory, and requested its alteration. The draft ran thus— “ The cattle and other property belonging to Cabul Diary, 22nd to 25th October 1869. the people of Furrah, &amp;c., which have been plun dered by the Eeistan and Kain levies, should be recovered from them by the Persian authorities, and they should prohibit them from doing any aggression in future in the Cabul border.” And the corrected words as follows :— “ At the instigation of Meer Alum Khan, Gov- Ditto ditto ditto, ernor of Kain, some short-sighted levies have been guilty of aggression in the Cabul border, and the said Meer receives his share of property plundered by the aggressors. The Persian authorities are also well aware of this fact. The Furrah and other levies have been hitherto prohibited from proceeding aggressively against Kain and Beerjeend, but if the Meer does not abstain from his mis doings, they will no longer wait to avenge.( 55 ) 1869.] “ Th® Ameer considers that it is riot advisable that he should ask the Persian authorities to prohibit the Seistan levies from aggression in his dominions, as by doing so it might be taken as a recognition that Seistan belongs to the Persians, and quoted as an admission, while, in reality, Seistan is a dependency of Afghanistan. He has, therefore, declined mentioning Seistan, and has only noted the intemperance of Meer Alum Khan.'” The draft, as corrected, was, it is saidj accepted by the envoy. 143. At the close of the year, Afzul Khan, of Hurrah, forwarded to the Ameer (1) a letter from Ibrahim Khan, of Sheikh- nassoor, addressed to himself saying—• “ As I have been your well-wisher from my childhood, I shall continue to be so till the last moment of my life. I maintain possession of only one-fourth now out of my many ancestral and hereditary forts, and I leave you at liberty to grant it to me, or to retain possession of it/” (2) the following letter, also addressed to himself from the Prince Governor of Meshed:—- “ Since my arrival in Kain, Allahdad Khan, a servant of yours, has been in attendance on me for the purpose of recovering the plundered property of the Afghan and Belooch Mullukh tribes from the Seistan robbers, who have perpe trated this offence owing to the former tribes having carried off some property belonging to the people of Seistan from Kain. It being decided that the property of the people of Kain should be recovered from the Afghan robbers, and the pro perty belonging to the Afghans from the people of Seistan, I beg to send a person specially for this purpose, and beg to state that, as soon as you forward the plundered property of the Kainees to me after recovering the same from the Afghan and Belooch Mullukh robbers, according to the agreements with your agent Allahdad Khan, I will also despatch the property of the Afghans, recovering it from the people of Seistan. Should you not concur in this decision after the arrival of Allahdad Khan, I beg to request the favor of your informing me of the same.” 144. Afzul Khan accompanied these letters by a narrative of the late history of Sheikhnassoor and of Seistan generally, which history, in the main, corresponds with the account sent by the British Minister at Tellerdn. Use has been made of it in the earlier portion of this Kote. 145. The Ameer replied— &lt;c I acknowledge the receipt of your letter and of its enclosures. With reference to Seistan matters, I have to remark that this territory belongs to Afghanistan, and it remains to be seen how long it will be retained by a foreign Government. As regards the Sheikhnassoor territory, which was Noorzai. originally called the *Moorzai territory, I have to state that this also is a dependency of our( 56 ) kingdom ; but as Ibrahim Khan is not a reliable per son, I direct you to ascertain if he is really and sin cerely our ally, or whether, as was the case formerly, his friendship extends in all directions (meaning that no one can rely on him). Should his friendship and submission be genuine, you can write to him that he may hold his territory, but must desist from theft and other violence (or ill doing). “ After this enquiry, you should ascertain whe ther he desires to come to Cabul or proceed towards Candahar: you should also ascertain whether his words and his actions agree/'’ 146. Cabul Diary, 11th to 11th Feb- ruary.—Rwpovt of a raid by Seistan robbers into Purrah territory. The Afghan authorities resisted and took ten of them prisoners, with some bloodshed on both sides. The diary continues :— u The Ameer wrote to Sirdar Meer Afzul Khan to the effect that, in the event of any interference occurring on the part of the Seistanees within the Cabul borders, he should always oppose their attacks, but should not interfere with the borders beyond his territory; also, that he should keep only the head men of the above robbers in confine ment and release their followers. Briefly, the Cabul authorities allege, as reported in former diaries, that as, in reality, Seistan is tributary of Afghanistan, the people of Afghanistan cannot prevent injury and violence from that quarter, unless it (Seistan) is thoroughly re-annexed to it (Afghanistan), and the interference of the Cabul officials for the prevention of the evil doing of the people of Seistan depends on the permission of the British Government.'’' , 147. Cabul Diary, l%th to 21st Feb ruary.—Fews of seven other raids into Purrah territory by Meer Alum Khan. And one of his officers had arrived in Ibrahim Khan’s territory in order to be siege a fort, called Dour Killa. Afzul Khan of Purrah, however, sent down some 800 soldiers to Ibrahim Khan’s assistance. Hearing this “ the Seistanees retired.” Dy Afzul Khan’s orders, 250 soldiers 'were kept on in Jowain, and 550 were sent to defend Sheikhnassoor, and an Afghan par- tizan was summoned to protect the boun dary of the Khash-rood territory. 148. Altogether the list of raids from the close of last year was as follows “ 1. On I0th December 1869, 550 camels belonging to the people of Tunjee, in Candahar. “ 2. On 3rd January, eight herds of sheep be- longmg to the border tribes of Khash, as detailed “ I.—Khash “ II.—Noorzai (( HI.—Belooches [1870.

Eifty thousand sheep and 4 or 5,000 camels of Sheikhnassoor territory. “ (23rd January 1870.) A person from Sheikh nassoor reports that 106 sowars, accompanied by Koostum Khan, Seistanee, and the two sons of Shureef Khan, Belooch, after attacking Gudh, conveyed away seven flocks of sheep, but the villagers, having pursued them, have brought their animals back.” 149. The Ameer Shere Ali displayed a marvellous forbearance in the matter of these raids. Meer Afznl Khan very naturally asked for reinforcements from Herat. The Ameer— directed Sirdar Futteh Mahomed Khan, the Governor, to defer the despatch of the above troops, if not already sent, to Furrah ; and in the event of their having been sent off, to recall them to Herat. A letter has also been sent to Sirdar Meer Afzul Khan, directing him to send back all the above troops to Sirdar Futteh Mahomed Khan, in Herat, whether they have reached Furrah, or be on their way to Furrah as yet ; that if the robbers are mere levies, he should arrange for their expulsion by the aid of the levies of his territory ; and that he should not interfere with the foreign border tribes further than to protect his frontier strictly from their attacks, until suitable arrangements are made in consultation with the British Government. Briefly, the Ameer intends not to proceed against the above marauders without the receipt of an expression of opinion from the English Authorities.” 150. Cabul Diary, Voth to VUh March. — Eutteh Mahomed, Governor of Herat, wrote to the Ameer, reminding him of former letters on the subject of Meer Alum Khan’s depredations, and saying— Cabul Diary, 15th to 17th March 1870. “1 had been informed by Sirdar Meer Afzul Khan that Seistan troops had arrived in Seistan with a view to attack Sheikhnassoor; but as Sheikhnassoor is situated on this side of the Helmund, and is within our frontier, we could not allow them to attack it.” 151. He had written to Syud Abool Hussun, late envoy from Meshed, saying( 58 ) that the Prince Governor had (1) told [1870. him that the deeds of violence of Meer Alum Khan had been reported to the Shah of Persia, and (2) had promised to restore the property lately plundered; that, nevertheless, Alum Khan had made a fresh inroad into Purrah, Khash and Zumeendawur, had killed some Afghan subjects, and carried off a large number of sheep and cattle and two prisoners. He begged that the Prince Governor might he moved to restrain Alum Khan. 152. Syud Abool Plussun answered that he had communicated the contents of the letter to the Prince Governor, who had expressed much surprise that Meer Alum Khan should have committed such violence, notwithstanding his knowledge of the Shah’s views and the Prince Gover nor’s own wishes for the security of the Afghan borders. Two emissaries were, therefore, sent to make enquiry, and— “ in* the event of the alleged violence of Meer Alum Khan being proved, to give him such punish ment as would prevent him from further miscon duct, and to recover all plundered property from him.” * In confirmation of this news, Futteh Mahomed (see Diary 1st to 4th April) reported that a Meshed official, in company with Sultan Mahomed Khan, had arrived at Herat on his mission to recover the pro«i perty plundered by Meer Alum Khan. 153. The Prince Governor also sug gested that Sultan Mahomed Khanf with an Afghan should be sent to recover the plundered property, and to warn Meer Alum Khan that, if he again interfered, he ^ would be held answerable. But the Prince Governor firmly asserted the Per sian authority over Ibrahim Khan, of Sheikhnassoor, who had accepted Persian service, was in receipt of 2,000 tomans a year, and had a few years ago sent his son to Teheran, where he still was. He added—« “ Whatever violence lias been occasioned in Afghanistan, Candahar territory, and Khashrood, will he compensated for in the event of its being proved; but as this Government views Ibrahim Khan with kindness, they will not abandon him, or his services, or his country. ****** “ No inconvenience will be caused to the officials of the Ameer by the support given to Ibrahim Khan, Belooch, by this Government, as far as I can think.” 154. The Ameer replied to Putteh Mahomed, of Herat:— ff With reference to the allusion of said Abool Hussun Shah to Sheikhnassoor and Ibrahim Khan, iielooch, I have to remark that from the earliest to the present time there has been great friendship between the Cabul and Persian Governments; hut it is a matter of astonishment that Meer Alur^ f Evidently the Afghan Agent at Meshed, Cabul Diary, 15th to 17th March 1870, Cabul Diary, 16th to 17th March 1870,t ( 59 ) 1870.] Khan, having adopted a hold and reckless line of conduct, has so disgracefully oppressed the border tribes of Afghanistan, and has been committing several other misdeeds; and the people of Seistan, at his instigation having crossed the Helmund, intend to attack Sheikhnassoor and the country of Mullick Ibrahim Khan. Seistan has always been a tributary of Afghanistan, and its Gover nors have been paying tribute to Afghan rule; the Persians have only taken possession of it three or four years ago during the recent disturbances in Afghanistan. Sheikhnassoor also, which lies on this side of the Helmund, is included in Afghanis tan, how do the Persians include Seistan and Sheikhnassoor in tbeir kingdom ? It is well known to all the authorities of both Governments that Seistan belongs originally to Afghanistan. The Persian authorities should therefore adopt suitable measures with this object, and their decision will certainly be ’accepted. “ With reference to the son of Sirdar Ibrahim Khan, I beg to state that when a person takes employment in any kingdom, the said kingdom does not become his birth-place. If hereafter foreign rulers interfere with the Afghanistan border, the Governors of this kingdom will cer tainly arrange for the strict protection of their frontier in order to save their people from the oppression of their adversaries. You should as certain everything fully and submit a detailed report as soon as possible.^ * Cabul Diary, 15th to 17th March 1870. He added*'— “You should send copy of my letter to Sultan Mahomed Khan with a letter from yourself for his information, and if he has left Meshed, to Ab^fool Hussun Khan in Meshed, in order that your views may be known there.” 155. The ce Jumsheedeef Chief” about the same time toldj; the Ameer that he had written to remonstrate with Meer Alum Khan, who had answered— “that he had not adopted this line of conduct by his own wish, but was constrained to do so at the instance of the Persian authorities. After hearing this the Ameer remarked as follows “ f Certainly, if Seistan remains in possession of the Persian Government, it will one day tend to great disturbances in Afghanistan. “ ‘ Troops from Seistan, via the Helmund, can come to Candahar without any hill or other impedi ments. This fact is well ascertainable by the British authorities if they refer to (Afghanistan) maps. Any interference within Afghanistan borders is assuredly an infringement of the authori ty of the British Government. I have laid Seis tan matters before them, and they will arrange for them according as they may consider advisable for Afghanistan and India, as the loss or gain of one Government is as the loss or gain of the other Government also/ ” 156. The Ameer's closing remarks were as follows:— Cabal Diary, 15th to 17th March 1870. “ f I view the English Government with res pect, otherwise the people of Afghanistan are able t Chief of the Jumsheedee tribe in the neigh, jbourhood of Herat.

I have strictly prohibited my subjects from doing so, though the Belooch robbers have been carrying off their pro perty for a long time. This has been repeatedly reported to the British Government, yet no in structions or reply hav§ been received. As I am an ally to the British, I cannot take any steps in the matter without an expression of their opinion, though, during this delay, much property of the people of Afghanistan is being destroyed/ Briefly, the Ameer is awaiting directions from the British Government/^ [1870. 157. Diary of ls£ to 4dh April .—The Ameer received news that Kuntal Baha- door and others of his subjects had made a counter-raid into Kain territory. He wrote, therefore, as follows to Putteh Mahomed Khan, of Herat “ I have heard that Kuntal Bahadoor, Ussee and Gholam Ally, having gone with their levies towards Kain one after the other, without your information, and, having attacked it, have plunder ed some cattle and property of its inhabitants. I have repeatedly warned you that this line of con duct is very disgraceful and likely to lead to dis turbances, and I now again direct you to capture and imprison Kuntal Bahadoor and other marau ders as soon as this order reaches you, and after recovering the above plundered property from them, to make it over to the Kaianees. The pro perty of Khafees* should also be recovered and • People of made over to them, after receiving the property belonging to your subjects from them. “ You should then issue emphatic orders to the effect that no inroad should be made in the Persian territory, and be careful that, owing to our friendship with the Persians, we should not invade their borders. I have also heard that the above marau ders have committed an outrage in Khaf, and the people thereof have waited on you with a view to their property being returned to them, conditional on the recovery of the property belonging to your people by them, and I direct you to comply with their request.” 158. A little later there camef f Cabul Diary, 1st to 4th April, 29th April, and letters from Tutteh Mahomed explaining 2nd May 187a the matter. Certain raiders from Kain had carried off property belonging to the Asfurzai tribe of Herat. On hearing this, Putteh Mahomed despatched Kuntal Bahadoor with a force of 300 sowars who, after a fight (attended with a little bloodshed on both sides), recovered some of the plundered cattle inside Kain terri tory. Putteh Mahomed took these into his own charge. 159. There had also [been raids by the Turcomans, through Herat, into Persian territory.

The Ameer* directed Eutteh Ma homed to make oyer all the recovered pro perty to a certain Persian official, Iman Wurdy Khan, who happened to be then in Herat, and of whose presence, distrusting his objects, the Ameer wished to be rid. Eutteh Mahomed's execution of this order is mentioned in the Diary 29th April to 2nd May. 161. More letters were presently re ceived from Syud Abool Hussun and the Prince Governor of Khorassan, reiterating the Persian claims to sovereignty over Sheikhnassoor. The latter said— I remark that Sirdar Ibrahim Khan, being intimidated by Meer Alum Khan, has sought the skelter of the Cabul authorities, and they have also afforded this. You can rest satisfied as to his having submitted himself to the Persian. Gov ernment for several years, and having forwarded his son to Persia to wait on His Majesty the King, who has most graciously given him employment, and assigned a suitable allowance for him. His (Sirdar Ibrahim Khan's) territory, which is a portion of Seistan and a dependency of Persia, will not be allowed to be ruined or taken possession of by any person ; nor will Meer Alum Khan be permitted to interfere with it, or adopt any evil measures for its destruction. We consider it necessary to guard him and his country ourselves, and not to trouble Afghan officials to afford him any shelter. If, with reference to the juxta-posi- tion of his country with Afghanistan, he has sought the protection of the Governor of Fur rah, the Cabul authorities should re-assure him as to the kindness of the King of Persia, and by friend ly exhortations should induce him to abandon the idea of non-submission to the Persian Government, desisting at the same time from giving him any assistance, &amp;c., as his strength, protection, honor, &amp;c., are being daily promoted by this Govern ment.' The Ameer thereupon remarked— “ c It is a matter of great astonishment that the Persian authorities in their avarice consider Sheikhnassoor as a portion of their kingdom merely on account of the son of Sirdar Ibrahim Khan having accepted their service, notwithstanding that it is as clear as daylight that the territory of Seistan has been a territory of Afghanistan since the commencement of the Afghan rule, and only three or four years ago the Persians took possession of it during the late disturbances. As I have laid this matter in friendship before the -British Government, I hope that it will be adjusted m a short time satisfactorily by their kindness. ' ' 162. In the first week of April a letter was received from Afzul Khan, of Eurrah, protesting his own adherence to the Ameer’s instructions to refrain from hostile nets. As regards Meer Alum Khan, he wrote— He wanders here and there with his dissolute sowars, but has never seen a sword in my hand; Q* ( 62 ) had he seen it, he would not have adopted this line of behaviour. He aims at nothing but offensive actions, as he has by this conduct gained favorable consideration of the King of Persia. It is not possible that in the event of Meer Alum KhaiPs remaining close to our borders our people will be quiet. What does it mean that (i. e., what is to be inferred from the fact that) Meer Alum Khan has attacked Candahar borders ? [1870. “ If my other representations are untrue, the above invasion is doubtless well known to you. The untrue stories of Meer Alum Khan would never have been considered true by the king (of Persia), but that he is in the habit of bribing officials, and consequently the reports of his op pression are toned down. “ At present Meer Masoon Khan, Eshuk Akasi, has been deputed from Meshed towards Seistan; but Meer Alum Khan having waited on him has much gratified him, and the Akasi has therefore cancelled his (Meer AlunPs) misdoings. Meer Alum Khan has so extensively given out the arrival of the troops of Meer Nusseer Khan, Durhoo Khan, and other Belooches in Seistan, that he is busy in the matter day and night. He has collected all the Seistan troops, and has sent most of them to Booij Alum Khan—the most noted place in Seistan. He has destroyed old forts, and, instead of three or four forts, has con structed one strong fort* and located some troops * The one described in the letters from Sind : in it. He has built bridges over all streams for “Boorj Alum Khan” north of Deshtuk. crossing his guns. A sketch map of Boorj Alum Khan has been sent to you/ J 163. On the 12th May an emissary, despatched by Meer Alum Khan to justify himself from the charge of oppression and plunder, arrived in Cahul and said that— if any of the subjects of Cabul, who have stated Cabul Diary for the half week ending 26th May that they have been plundered, will present them- selves at Kain before Meer Alum Khan, and will swear to and identify their property, the same will be restored to them.” 164. The Ameer refused to receive him in durbar, hut would not dismiss him till he got an answer from the British Government to his representations about Seistan. 165. Mr. Thomson has (8th June) been asked by telegram to find out what he can about this emissary in a quiet way. 1( 63 ) Section VII. 1870 ] ^ Le ^ es P a ^ ies °f ^ ie British Minister at Teheran regarding (1) Persia’s apprehensions of Shere Alt’s designs, (2) the late raids into Afghan terri tory. 166. On tlie 7th January last, Mr. Thomson wrote to Lord Clarendon, saying that the Persian Government apprehended an attack on Seistan by the Afghans. These apprehensions were derived from * two sources—(1) rumours in Khorassan that Shere Ali was assembling troops for the purpose; (2) letters sent by Abool Hassan Shah, the Persian envoy to Cabul, now on his return, who said— “ that Shere Ali Khan's troops would march upon Seistan at an early date, and that it was generally believed amongst the Afghans that this movement had been decided upon by the Ameer immediately after his conference with the Viceroy at Umbalia last summer/'’ 167. Persia announced to Mr. Thom son her firm resolve to resist all encroach ment on her territory. Seistan was con sidered to form as much an integral part of that territory as Khorassan or Kerman, and any attempt at aggression by the Afghans in that quarter would lead to open hostilities. 168. Afghanistan might seize Seistan by a coup de main, as there was hut a small Persian force in the Province; but then this would be an act of open warfare, which would be resented either by opposi tion in Seistan, or by an attack on Herat, where the Afghans could be met on more advantageous terms. “The claims (Mr. Thomson remarked) of the Persians and Afghans to the disputed territory of Seistan have been frequently brought forward and considered during the last ten years, and, in 1862, the question presented itself under circumstances very similar to those now anticipated by the Persian Minister. Dost Mahomed Khan then threatened to attack Seistan, and the Persian Government claimed of Her Majesty's Government the execu tion of the 7th Article of the Treaty of 1857, which stipulates that f in case of any violation of the Persian frontier by any of the States referred to above {i. e., of Afghanistan), the Persian Gov ernment shall have the right, if due satisfaction is not given, to undertake military operations for the repression and punishment of the aggression/ The decision of Her Majesty's Government, com municated to Mr. Alison in Lord Russell's des patch No. 80 of the 30th of October, was to the effect that, as they did not recognize the sove reignty of Persia over Seistan, they could not admit that the demand said to have been made by Dost Mahomed Khan for the submission of Seistan( 64 ) constituted a case in which, under the 7th Article 1870.1 of the Treaty, they could he called upon to acquiesce in any military operations being under taken by Persia against Afghanistan. “ During the following year, in consequence of an apprehended invasion of the Seistan territory by the Afghans, the Persian Government again claim ed that an assurance might be given that Her Majesty's Government would prevent any such invasion of Persian territory, and the Shah's Minister in London was informed by Lord Russell, in a despatch dated November 5th 1863, that Her Majesty's Government being advised that the title to the territory of Seistan was disputed be tween Persia and Afghanistan, must decline to interfere in the matter, and must leave it to both parties to make good their possession by force of arms.' 169. Knowing, therefore, that the Persian Minister was fully acquainted with the views of the English Government, as given in the two despatches above men tioned, Mr. Thomson thought that it was a sufficient reply to tell the Persian Minister what had been really said to Shere Ali at Umballa. The Minister replied— “ That so many alarming reports were spread with regard to the alliance which the Afghans were supposed to have formed with England, that it was re-assuring to learn what the real attitude of Her Majesty's Government in India was to wards that country ; but he hoped that the British Government would recommend Shere Ali Khan to abstain from any hostile movement upon Seistan, as their advice would not, he believed, be disre garded by him, and it might obviate future com plications with reference to Herat, and tend to promote a friendly understanding between Persia and the Court of Cabul.' 170. On the 8th March, Mr. Thomson « Thu, ail Mr. Tho mK , n &gt; s .utaquent letter, wrote,* on the strength of news from referred to, were addressed to Lord Clarendon, Meshed, that the Ameer of Kain (Persian copy ’ &gt;ei ' s 8ent to the Gov&lt;ir ““ 1 “ t ° f Governor of Seistan) had made two forays into Eurrah territory; that the Afghan Government had tried to resist, but had been defeated, and that a considerable amount of booty had been carried off; that Shere Ali had sent an envoy thither to demand satisfaction; that the Khorassan authorities had disavowed the proceedings of the Ameer of Kain, and had been given partial redress by the restitution of the plundered property, and by the surrender of some of the persons who headed the expedition into Afghan territory. 171. The substance of the Afghan en voy’s letters w r as supposed to he— (1) a request for the restoration of Seistan as being Afghan terri tory ; r( 65 ) 1870.] (2) a question whether the relations between Persia and Afghanistan were to he viewed as friendly or unfriendly : if the former, then the Ameer of Kain ought to be punished for his forays. 172. On the 1st March, the Meshed Agent wrote that there had been a fresh affray between Meer Alum Khan’s troopers and those of Purrah. Some 200 families of Seistanees, trying to migrate into Can- dahar territory, had been seized by Persian troopers sent out by the Governor, but had been rescued by a body of horse from Purrah, who routed the Persians.—-(Enclo sure in Mr. Thomson’s letter of 30th March 1870.) 173. About this time Ibrahim Khan, of Sheikhnassoor, made a successful inroad into Southern Seistan and routed a body of Persian troops. The Governor, Meer Alum Khan, reported that the attack was made by Belooch troops sent by Khodadad Khan, of Kelat, at the instigation of Shore Ali. But the true account came out from Mr. Thomson’s interview with the Shah himself on the 22nd March, and from the Meshed correspondent’s letter of 1st March. Meer Alum Khan professed much alarm, and seems to have admitted that many of the Seistanees, being disaffected to Persia, desired that the Province should be occupied by the Afghans. He urgently called for reinforcements. 174. In consequence of this, a rein forcement of two regiments was to be sent from Teheran into Khorassan. The order to do this was subsequently countermand ed.—(Mr. Thomson’s despatch No. 32, dated 30th March 1870.) 175. On the 24th March, Mr. Thomson wrote that, two days before, the Shah had personally made a fresh representation of the apprehensions which he entertained as to Afghan designs on Herat,— “he declared that Persia sincerely desired to maintain friendly relations with the Ameer of Afghanistan, but that she was resolved to resist any aggression upon Seistan, which was as much Persian territory as Khorassan or Kerman. Any attempt made by the Afghans to occupy that Province would lead to open hostilities, and the Persian Government would consider themselves fully justified in opposing such a movement by despatching troops to attack the Ameer within the Herat territory. His Majesty argued that in adopting this course the Persian Government would only be acting in conformity with the deci sion communicated by Earl Russell to the Persian R( 66 ) Minister in London in November 1863, when the [1870» latter was informed that the title to Seistan being disputed between the Afghans and Persians, Her Majesty's Government would leave it to both parties to make good their possession by force of arms. His Majesty seems very desirous to know how the proposal to act in this manner would be viewed by Her Majesty's Government. ****** “ I endeavoured to ascertain what had actually taken place in Seistan, and whether any collision had occurred between the Afghans and the Persian troops; but His Majesty had either not been fully informed by the Ameer of Kain, the Persian Governor of Seistan, as to recent events in that quarter, or he did not feel disposed to enter further on the subject. He merely said that the last reports which had reached him from Seistan showed that the Ameer of Kain had been attacked by Ibrahim Khan, the Belooch Chief, and that it was supposed this aggression had been instigated and abetted by the Afghan authorities at Furrah. “ I remarked that letters recently received from Meshed alluded to a raid having been successfully carried out by the Ameer of Kain in the neighbourhood of Furrah and within the Afghan territory, by which a considerable quantity of booty had been secured; that application had been made for redress to the Prince Governor of Khoras- san, who had taken measures to have a portion of the property restored, and some of the plunderers given up; and that in consequence of that expedi tion, further hostilities had very recently taken place between the people of Furrah and the Persian troops in Seistan. Considering the moment favor able for calling His Majesty's attention to the late proceedings of the Persian authorities in Kerman, and the threatening attitude assumed by them along the Mekran line of frontier, I said that all military movements either for hostile purposes or for intimidation, such as those attributed to the Ameer of Kain in Seistan, and to Ibrahim Khan, of Bunpore, in connection with the Khan of Khelat's territory, could not be too strictly inter dicted, as the assurances given by the Persian Ministers showed that they were not authorized by the Shah, and they might at any moment lead to complications of a very serious nature. “ His Majesty replied that orders had already been sent to Seistan to prevent any such move ments taking place in future without express authority given from Teheran, and that fresh in structions would be again forwarded to the same effect. “ Matters, however, looked so threatening now on the Afghan frontier, that he feared an attack might be mad&lt;* on Seistan at any moment by Shere Ali Khan, and he desired therefore that I would at once forward a telegram to your Lord- ship stating what his apprehensions were, and appealing to Her Majesty's Government to inter pose and use their influence to restrain the Afghan Chief from invading or interfering with that terri tory. His Majesty hoped that Her Majesty's Government would accede to this request, and he felt convinced that any advice tendered to the Ameer by them would not be disregarded by the ruler of Afghanistan.'( 67 ) 1870.] 176. On the 29th March, Mr. Thomson reported a meeting of the Shah’s Ministers for the purpose of putting the relations of Persia with Afghanistan on a more satisfactory footing, and to prevent, if pos sible, any Afghan interference in Seistan. The Ministers almost unanimously con demned the recent proceedings of the Government of Seistan, and, doubting the accuracy of the accounts received from him, were about to send Gholam Hussein Khan, “ formerly employed on similar service in Seistan,” to report on the conduct of Meer Alum Khan throughout the period of his Governorship of the Province, and the present state of affairs in the Province. The Ministers also recommended the deputation of an agent of suitable rank to Cabul, to establish and maintain a friend ly intercourse between the Persian Gov ernment and that of Afghanistan.( 68 ) , Section VIII. Correspondence regarding the proposal to submit the matter to British arbitration. 177. On the 19th March last, Mohsin Khan, the Persian representative in London, addressed Lord Clarendon re garding the designs of the Afghans on Seistan: said that after Lord Kussell’s letter of 5th November 1868, Persia had re-taken possession of that territory, and had not ceased from that moment to con sider it as forming an integral part of the interior of Khorassan; announced the Shah’s firm determination to oppose any Afghan attempts on the Province, and begged that Her Majesty’s Government would therefore let the Afghans see what .disastrous consequences would follow such attempts. 178. Lord Clarendon (25th March), in reply, said that Mr. Thomson had been told to offer British arbitration on^ the question of the sovereignty of Seistan under Article VI. of Treaty of 1857, and that, if Persia consented, the Viceroy of India would be asked to obtain Shere Ali’s acquiescence. 179. On the 5th April, Mohsin Khan renewed his request that the British Government should intervene to restrain Shere Ali from acts of aggression on Seistan. This time he said, that after Lord Bussell’s announcement that England would allow the question of sovereignty in the Province to be decided by force of arms— , t?r (C les armes ont decide a notre favour, to- depjsjs cinq ans le Seistan fait partie integrante de notre Province du Khorassan, par consequent, il^ ne saurait relever de ^article six de notre traite de Paris.” Lord Clarendon replied that, till it was known what Persia would reply to the offer of British arbitration, Her Ma jesty’s Government could not determine what course to pursue. 180. On the 20th April a telegram was received from Mr. Thomson saying that— (C the Persian Government, although they con- ggg enclosure of letter from Secretary, Secret sider that the question of Seistan was settled and Political Department, Lond&lt; a, dated 22ud April according to purport of Lord John Russell's des- 1870, No. 2 G (Secret), patch, yet, having full reliance on the justice of the British Government, they are willing to make Her Majesty’s Ministers arbiters in the matter of the sovereignty and boundaries of Seistan, in order that nothing may occur to disturb tranquil lity on the frontiers of Persia and Afghanistan, provided that Lord John Russelhs despatch remainsFrom Viceroy, to Secretary of State, dated 14th May 1870, No. 784 P. * He had (on 9th May) desired a letter to be ■written to the Foreign Office, expressing his opinion that no time should be lost in making the necessary arrangements for the proposed Seistan arbitration, the more so that, from Mr. Thomson’s letter of 24th March, it appeared that incursions across the Perso- Afghan border had been made from both sides, and further hostilities seemed threatening. The Secretary of State proposed to appoint Colonel Goldsmid an arbitrator, to proceed, accompanied by the Persian Commissioner, to the frontier, there to meet the officer appointed by the Ameer of Cabul for the same pur pose of arbitration. From Viceroy, to Secretary of State, dated 26th May 1870, No. 859P. ( 69 ) in full force. The despatch referred to is that of 5th November 1863, from Lord John Russell, to the Persian Minister in London/'’ 181. The papers were sent out by Mr. Kaye (22nd. April), who said that the views of Her Majesty’s Government would be communicated in a future despatch. 182. On the 27th April, the Secretary of State telegraphed to the Viceroy— “ The Persian Government are willing to submit the question of Seistan sovereignty and boundary to British arbitration. Ascertain whether Cabul Ameer agrees to this. It is desirable that he should do so/'’ After the proposition had been con sidered in Council, the Viceroy telegraph ed [14th May]—• “Ameer will naturally expect that arbitrator of Seistan boundary be appointed by Indian Government, or, if there be two, that one at least should be an Indian officer of our selection. It is necessary that this be decided before we commu nicate with Ameer. - ” And the Secretary of State replied* (telegram of 19th May) that he proposed to appoint Colonel Goldsmid as Chief Com missioner for Seistan arbitration. He would proceed with the Shah’s commission to Herat, where the Assistant Commissioner, whom the Government of India was asked to name, should, in September, meet him, accompanied by the Afghan Commissioner. 183. But the papers in Mr. Kaye’s letter of 22nd April had now arrived, and shewed that Persia really intended to take her stand, not on the treaty of 1857, but on Lord Bussell’s despatch of 5th November 1863, which was quite irreconcileable with the terms of the treaty. Thereupon the following telegram was sent (26th May):— “ Your despatch No. 26 of 22nd April. It appears to us, from Mr. Thomson's telegram to Lord Clarendon of 19th April, that Persian Go vernment do not accept the arbitration of Her Majesty's Government in the sense and on the basis suggested by you, and offered by Lord Clarendon in his letter to Mr. Thomson of February 24&lt;th. “ You offer the treaty of 1857 as basis. Persia appears to take as basis Lord Russell's despatch of November 5th, 1863. This view con firmed by letter of Persian Minister in London of April 5 th. “ We think we cannot invite Ameer to accept arbitration on any other basis, except that laid down by you, and offered by Lord Clarendon in Foreign Office letter of 24th February, i. e.. Treaty of Paris.' SFrom Viceroy, to Secretary of State, dated 27th May 1870, No. 860P. ( 70 ) And the following, next day:—■ “ A reference to Mr. Thomson's letter of 24th March, to Lord Clarendon, confirms our telegram of yesterday as to view taken by Persia of effect of Lord John Russell's letter.' The Secretary of State has replied— (C It appears to Her Maiesty's Government From Secretary of state, to Viceroy, dated Slsfc that the acceptance by Persia of British arbitra- a y tion in matter of Seistan is according to Mr. Thomson's telegram of 19th April, and that the reservation made is practically in conformity with provision of 6th Article of Treaty of 1857, which admits of Persia taking up arms in the event of friendly offices failing to have effect.' 184. There has been the following telegraphic correspondence between' the Viceroy and Mr. Alison on the subject:— The Viceroy, to Mr. Thomson, dated 8th June 1870— “ Is there any essential difference between pro-!' posal made in Lord Clarendon's letter of 21st February 1870, as regards Seistan arbitration, and the suggestion of Persian Government made in your telegram of 19th April, to Foreign Office, which adds as proviso that Lord John Russell's letter of 1863 is to remain in full force ? “ If you consider there is, please describe it.' Mr. Alison, to the Viceroy, dated 9th June 1870— “ Lord Clarendon proposed to submit question of Seistan to British arbitration under Article YI. of Treaty, which provides for differences arising be tween the two States being referred to friendly offices of England, and authorizes a resort to arms should these fail. The Persian Government sub mit question both of sovereignty and boundaries of Seistan to our arbitration, provided that Lord Russell's despatch suggesting that both parties should settle their differences by force of arms remains in force. The substance of that despatch is explained fully in Mr. Thomson's No. 2 of January 7th, to Foreign Office.' The Viceroy, to Mr. Alison, dated 10th June 1870— “ Your telegram of 9th. Mr. Thomson's despatch No. 2 of 7th January states circumstances which led to Lord John Russell's despatch of November 1863. But it is not understood what Persia means by the proviso that Lord Russell's despatch remains in force while question of sovereignty and boundary is referred to arbitration. Please explain fully by Telegraph what is the effect of that proviso on Lord Clarendon's proposal to arbitrate, and what Persia really means by it.' The following reply has just been received from Mr. Alison:— a Persia really means by the proviso that she possesses half of Seistan, and does not intend to submit that to arbitration, but that she will sub mit to arbitrate the other half which she claims but does not possess.'</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000a0_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/C65</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000a0</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/C65</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'The History of Seistan and Lash-Jowain'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1870/1870</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-03-09T18:02:53</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>38 folios</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This document was compiled and signed by H Le Poer Wynne (Foreign Department) and covers the history of Seistan and Lash-Jowain [Lāsh-e Juwayn], including the dispute over sovereignty which led to the Anglo-Persian War (1856-7).The document is divided into the following sections:1.
