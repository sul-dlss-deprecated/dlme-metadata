It should, however, be remembered tha t there is a very steady coastal traffic in passengers who take out pass es for Qatar, by launch and thence proceed on by native craft to and fr om D'baij and since these people only declare for Qatar, one cannot ascer tain how many of them go on to D'bai. 6 I hope very shortly to institute a Po which will record the departures of craft froa all my statistical work is greatly handicapped Government has refused me a statistical clerk. rt Clearance Register, Bahrain; but, as you know, by lack of staff, and the Your second paragraph is not quite cl covering all imports by native craft, which h&amp;v imports and the ports of origin.

I am sorry I have been so long in answering but it has been difficult to collect the figures you want as the statistics are not very accurate. As regards imports by country craft. Dinting the year 1348 goods valued Rs.1,11,Oil were imported and in the year 1347 valued Rs. 1,00,091. The figures for the year 1349,which has just concluded,are not out yet but deG-renier assures me that they compare very favourably with the figures for the two pro ceeding years,as this form of transport Ras maintained its average better than steamers f b»4 it seems fairly clear that the two big launches that used to be on this run used to make some seven trips every 2 months. As regards passengers,it is impossible to give Cut accurate figures. I issued 130 visas^and the Bahrain Government30 but many more than this must have gone for a large number of people apply for passes for Qatar and go on to the Trucial Coast as opportunity offers also many people undoubtedly go direct from Qatif and Darin and other places on the mainland without taking passes from Bahrain but if there is a steamer connection established I am sure they will use it.

The Customs at this port have complained to me on several occasions regarding three Arabs who travel on B.I.S.N.Co., steamers between Dubai and Kuwait. They state that these three people persist in selling goods to coolies and others on board the steamer here. The men have been warned several times by the Customs representative visiting the steamer and myself but they do not take any notice of what is said to them. T fear that one day these Arabs may be arrested and brought ashore which will result in complications. I do not know whether their arrest by Iranian authorities is possible but they are certainly a nuisance to Customs and ourselves. I wonder if it is possi' le ^or them to be warned by the Political authorities at Kuwait or Dubai or even Bahrain against carrying on trading whilst the steamer is anchored in Iranian ports.

No. PZ.7938/39, regarding increases in the freight and passage rates in the Indian Coastal and Persian Gulf trades. The Minister is informed hy the British India Steam Navigation Company that although the revised Schedule of Rates has not yet 'been received from India, it is understood that the increases amount to from 40/ to 50/ of the pre-war rates. The Company state that the wages of Indian crews have increased hy 40/ and 50/, that hunker coal prices, particularly at outports, and oil prices have risen very considerably, and that special route instructions entailing longer steaming distances were introduced in Indian and adjacent waters on the outhree/: of hostilities. war risk money is also paid in the case of personnel on the same scale as personnel from the United Kingdom. As a measure of prudence it was necessary for the Company / to insure the vessels against war risks at rates which were not very much less than those applicable to ships trading to the United Kingdom - in fact, it is not possible to cover insurance against war risks under the Government Scheme at a lower rate than for vessels trading to and from this country. It is further understood that the extra cost of repairs arising from war conditions, and of material, deck and engine stores and provisions shipped from this country, is also a contributory factor to the large increase in the operating costs of vessels which are based on India.

Mandvi and shipments from bond or under claim for drawback to cutch Mandvi are prohibited at British Indian customs ports. If, therefore, the goods in question were originally shipped from Bombay to your port either 1 from bond or under claim for draw back or if they were transhipped at Bombay without payment of duty, their diversion to Cutch Mandvi Via . Bahrain would have the effect of circumventing the prohibition referred to above which is specially designed for the protection of revenue. It would therefore be advisable in such cases to insist on the landing of such goods at Bahrain before they are shipped to cutch Mandvi as the observance ofthe formalities and expense involved in landing of the goods and their shipment thereafter will probably act as a whole some restriction. I would also request you to let me know the name and date of departure of the vessel by which the goods were originally shipped from this port and the marks thereon to enable me to ascertain whether they were shipped to your port after payment of Customs duty at this port.

Yours faitnfully,c/o Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. Ltd., Bahrein. Ixth. October, x942. j.u uux- letter to the Political ^gent, No.L/764 of 8th. instant, v;e requestea that the passports of i^ssrs. Mulberry, McPhie, Miller and button be vaxiaated for travel to Canada via Iraq, Palestine, Lgypt, ihe countries of ^frica, Brazil and the U.S.*.. These passengers are aue to xeave by the first plane, and there may be root, for them on the plane due to-morrow. These passports 7/Ere received by me at my huuse at about 5.Go pm yesueraay, too ude to do anything before the 'Id. On examination, I find that none of the passports bears endorsement for the countries mentioned above, excejjt Iraq, Egypt and Palestine, and Mr. Mulberry's pass port does not even bear the endorsements for these three countries. It may be tnat you are not able to grant endorsements for all the countires required, but if not, I shall be pleased if you will advise me in order that I shall know for another time, and not write you letters'. It would appear } however, that there has been a definite omission in mr. Mulberry s passport. In our letter we asxed for the passports to be returned on Saturday, and sent our peon at about 11.00 am for them; he was told to return at 1.00 pm, and on doing so was told that tne passports were still not ready and would be sent to me later. There is always a considerable amount -of difficulty is getting hold of passports from your clerk, and they are usually kept much longer than necessary, only being returned at the last moment. It may happen one day that a passport is returned incorrectly completed too late for correction before departure of a plane and then where would we be? as it happens ivir. Mulberry 3 'is not lih-ely to leave before to-mctfrow, so if you will be good enoough to complete the four passports enclosed and Return them to me to-day, I shall be able to send them to B.O.a.C. in good time. I'm sorry to have to bother you on a holiday, but feel sure you will realise that it is due entirely to the aate arrival and in complete endorsements on the p^sports - no fault of mine It m &lt;d. / ■ &amp; D.O.No. 1832-16/4. Political Agency, Bahrain, Dated the 17th October, 1942 • Please refer to your letter of the 11th about the passports of Messrs. Mulberry,Mephie, Miller and Sutton . 2 * I am sorry thatrowing to the rush, the passports should have been insufficiently endorsed and have taken steps whereby a recurrence of such a thing is unlikely. If for any reason an endorsement or visa applied for cannot be granted, you will certainly be informed why. It is very difficult, however, to comply with such a request as one for endorsement of a passport for ' the countries of Africa w . In war time passport facilities are only granted for those particular countries which the holders are likely to visit and have legitimate reason for visiting, and general endorsements for * the countries of ifiurope n or n the countries of Africa cannot be given ^ ( an endorsement for the British Empire is the only form of general endorsement allowed ). In the absence of information to which African countries you referred in this case, I gave an endorsement for the British Empire• 3 * As regards your complaint of delay^ri^dgling with these passports, I would remind you of this Agency^Notice No. 783-16/43, dated the 30th April 1942, which stated clearly that passport work would be attended to only between ll.A.M. and l.P.M. ( The hours are from 12 noon to 2.P.M in the winter ). therefore, your peon arrives at 11. A.M., he must expect to wait. Both the passport clerk and I have a good many other things to do besides dealing with passports, particularly on the day before Id y and when we received on the morning of the 10th October ( the 9th being a holiday,) a letter - not marked H urgent', - stating that ' ;&gt;• the holders of the passports enclosed with it are due to leave Bahrain on the 9th, it is difficult to know precisely what degree of urgency should be accorded to it. After discovering from British Overseas Airways Corporation that there was no possibility of the* gentl«m«n in question leaving Bahrain before October 13tn, might well have left these passports until after the Id holidays, but in view of your particular request that they should be returned that day the passport clerk was kept working on them well after office hours* 4* The safest way of avoiding these difficulties is for intending travellers to send their passports here in good time, instead of at the last moment, and any assistance which you can give in persuading them to do so v/ould be much appreciated. 5* The delay in answering your letter is due to the fact that I have been making enquiries from British Overseas Airways Corporation, for your information, as to the countries for which passports should be validated when the holders propose to go to the United States of America by air from Cairo. I am told that, in addition to the British Empire and Brazil they require endorsement for the Belgian Cango and French Equatorial Africa. I gather-that triyoc out-of the feur men Li queflt4on have not-yct left Bahrain, and if you-will return their passports Ur-uie-5 will get them To Yours sincerely, S&lt;//. .
