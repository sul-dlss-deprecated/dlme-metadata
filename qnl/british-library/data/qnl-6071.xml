Sir The representative in Jedda of the Standard Arabian Oil Company of California, Mr. W.J.Lenahan, informed me on the 1st December that he had received, by that day’s mail, satisfactory news of the grogress made by his Company on the Hasa Coast. He said that they had now decided to commence drilling operations, probably early in January, at Dhahran, a point on the mainland opposite to Bahrain. Whilst this was the only place at which they proposed to drill at present, their geologists were busy pursuing their examina tion of the area of the concession. they were working in four parties and were now, he understood, in northern Hasa in the heighbourhood of As-Saffa. They were making good use of their aeroplane, which they had found invaluable. 2. Mr.Lenahan proceeded to say that they had also come to a satisfactory arrangement with the Saudi authorities over the use of wireless telegraphy. He quoted that part oi Article 19 of their concession which confers on the Company the right to use ’’all means of communication', and asked that he had experienced considerable difficulty in persuading the Saudi Arab Government to see eye to eye in the inter pretation of this. Now that this difficulty had been overcome, they proposed to make full use of wireless telegraphy in their operations. Jubail would be their centre in Hasa, and I understood him to say that other p.oints in the field of their concession, where their The Right Honourable Sir John Simon,G.C.3.1.,etc., etc.. etc. representatives /M representatives were at work would tee suitably equipped. Ke appeared to consider it possible that his office in Jedda would, in time if not in the near future, be similarly furnished. I alluded to the expert staff he would require if he.were to have a transmitting set here, to which he replied that he thought the apparatus would be of a compara tively simple type. These wireless sets were now be, n 0 made, especially for his Company, in the United States. 3.

British Consulate-General, BUSHIRE. 31st December 1934—India Office Confidential. P.Z.7294/34. OIL IN KUWAIT NEUTR A L ZOHK . Note of a conversation with Mr.Rex Janson of the nrabian Development Syndicate, on 27th November,1934. Mr. Rex Janson (son of Mr.Janson Ox the Arabian Development Syndicate), with whom I have a slight personal acquaintaiice, had asked if he could come to see me, without indicating on what subject. On arrival he saia that he had now become a director ox the Arabian Development Syndicate and wished, apart from establishing cont/act in that capacity, to explain the present position oi the Syndicate in regard to the Neutral Zone oil concession. 2. Mr.Janson said that he understood that the position of the Neutral Zone had been discussed with Fuad Hamza. The Syndicate were now in the first place endeavourin 0 to secure a letter from Ibn Saud in respect oi the Neutral Zone area of the type which they gathered would be acceptable to H.L.G. Secondly, he was authorised to inform me that in the event oi their securing the Neutral Zone concession they would part with at only to a genuine British company - not a company similar to that which was operating in Bahrain, but a genuine British company with British capital behind it. Not to put too fine a point on it, they would be prepared to transfer their interest to the A.P.O.C. if the A.P.Q.C. were prepared to take it. 3. I thanked Mr.Janson for this information, and without referring to the fact that the A.P.C.C. couln not themselves operate a concession in the Neutral Zone, but would hexve to transfer it to the I.P.C., saia that presumably transfer would n&amp;i be on tne Syndicate’s own financial terms. Mr. Janson /- 2 - Janson said tliat he could go so far as to say that those terms v/oulci not be in any way exorbitaxit or unreasonable. The Syhdicate would, he thought, probably be content to get their money back together with some understanding in regard to royalty. A reference was made to the arrangement between the Eastern and General Syndicate and the Bahrain Petroleum Company, under which the Eastern and General Syndicate are entitled to an overriding royalty in respect of production above a certain figure, but Mr.Janson did not mention any specific basis for a royalty understanding. 4. T said that our position had been made clear in my letter to Mr .Jans on, Senior, of 24 th September,?.2.6025/34. The enquiries v/e had made had gone to shew in the first place that there was no definite commitment on the j,art of the Saudi Government to the Syndicate. (The Arabic letter from the King, which Ir.Ydlibi had given me at the interview on 24th May, inci&amp;entally seemed so worded as fully to safe guard the position of Ibn 3aud). Secondly, our information, such as it was, was definitely to the effect that tae state ment made to me by Kr.Ydlibi in lay last (and also x'eierreo. to in Mr.Awayni’s Note of 10th May (P .2.3487/34) that the American interests which had been concerned in this area were out of the field was incorrect. I did not think that we had asked specifically for a letter from Ibn Saud himself. But if Ibn Saua was in fact free definitely to commit himsell to the Syndicate in respect of his interest in the Neutral ^one there seemed no reason why he should not do so if he vaunted to. If, on the other hand, his hands were not iree, either because of any overriding option he had granted to the American interests or for any other reason, tnen u^e gi©posi tion was not a business one so far as we were concerned. We could nut facilit ate approaches to the Shaikh of Kuwait or recommend the Shaikh of Kuwait seriously to consiuer any offer put forward, save by interests which were in a position /-gpositicn ‘to make a really t irm of'f’er. Tkal lie- i'-ec appear* to be the position of the Syndicate at the present time. 5. Mr.Janson intimated that he appreciated the position and realised that the American interests appeared to have some stranglehold on Ibn Saud. He said that he thought the position was probably that on the one hand the eahiiohnia Oil were in no hurry to see that this r&amp;as: area developed unless and until it suited them, and that probably t-e same was true of the A.r.O.C. The Syndicate would, however, proceed with the steps which it was taking uo en eavoin to clear the position with the Saudi Government. (sd.) J.G.Laithwaite. India Office. 27th November 1934.P.Z.7339/34 HI3C0BD OF A MSETIHG A? TILJ FO;tEIGH OFFICE Oli THE 7TH KOT3MBSB TO COSTS ID ;H 0?^ FUTUHB OF THE KOViEI^ HI-jUTRAL 30KS &gt; Tii© following vsere present: ~ Mr. Benciel, Foreign Office; Sir Andrew Kyon, His Majesty*e Minister at Jedda; Mr* Laithwaite, India Office. Mr. Joimstone) Fuad Bey Hamza, the SaudiMheputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, had made a n^rsonal and unofficial suggestion during the conversation which took place at the Foreign Office on thjr£5th September (see page 5 of the record in E 6018/4/M5) that ?, the Neutral Sons should be !1 bisected, either for purposes of the /pil/ concession ' only, in wi-ich case the concession in the northern half ’would be within the gift of the Sheikh of K owe it only, f, and that for the southern half within the gift of the w Saudi Government only, or by a definitive political 'partition, a new frontier being drawn across the 'mi die of the Zona, the northern half being c.ay lately 'incorporated in Koweit, and the southern half “completely incorporated in Saudi Arabia'. After so ic discussion, Fuad Bey had been informed that, while this suggestion seemed at first sight to offer a possible solution of the difficult problems connected with the Foreign Office. x 1 ce. \ ■wo r v Ur. &gt; alctita ) ; h. Vv ;til)i;h recalled, by way bf introduction, that grant of an oil concession in the Neutral Zone, His Majesty 1 ©/2 Majesty’s Govornmort would have to give careful consideration to the various aspects of the matter before they could say whether they would be ready to follow up the suggestion which Fuad Bay had made. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent at Koweit v/ouid however be consulted without delay, and if His Majesty’s Government considered it desirable to pursue the idea, the Saudi Minister in London would be informed. * ^ vV &amp; \ Pf ^ )n* A B, The purpose of th^ present meeting was to consider the matter i^ the light of Colonel Dickson’s views, which had ntfJw been received, (see Mr. Laith aite’s letter 1.6.6160/34 of the 4th October to Mr. Rendel). These views were strongly adverse to Fuad Bey’s proposal, and were supported by a number of arguments which at first sight seemed extremely strong. 3. Mr. Eendel was how?ever doubtful whether all the premises of Colonel Dickson’s arguments were in fact sound. They seemed to be based on the assum tion that the Sheikh of Koweit already possessed effective rights over the Heutral Zone and th: t by the proposed partition the Sheikh would be virtually giving up these rights. But this premise was faulty. The Sheikh’s rights, though equal with I bn baud’s, were no greater and could only be er.ereised with Ibn baud’s concurrence and co-op ration. Should we therefor© really be asking the Sheikh to give up any righto by asking him to agree to the partition of the Zone? Other considerations apart, it was difficult to see how the Sheikh could be represented as the loser if by giving up half-rights over half the ssone he -was to acquire full rights over th©/the other half. 4. Colonel Dickson hrd laid i uch stress on the imx&gt;e .nanence of Ibn Saud*s rule, and seemed to belike that the area had been made a neutral zone partly at least in order to giYe the Sheikh a pretext for eventually reclaiming or regaining it if conditions were advantageous - for example, if the Saudi regime should collapse. Such an assumption however could not be justified. The Saudi rights in the sons were legally established by treaty, and could not bo regarded as temporary or liable to lapse. 5. Hi. rALCQL; mentioned that he had now ascertained that Sir Percy Cox had stated, when reporting the signature of the Uqair rotocol {Bagdad despatch to Colonial Office Ho.877 of the 20th December, 1922,) that n the reason for ! the creation of this neutral enclave vms that a rumour 'had been started that signs of oil had been noticed in 'the vicinity of the Khor Maqta. In viev^ of this I did 'not foel able to agree to its allocation to either party u until the rumour had boon set at rest . It seemed moreover evident from the use of the words n to either party 5 that Sir Percy Cox at least did not consider the Neutral 2on... to be the Sheikh*e by right. J,IR. RSNDEL added th t the fears expressed by Colonel Dickson, lest the acquisition by Ibn Baud of half the Neutral Son© in full sovereignty should lead to the establishment of fortifications etc,, could easily be met by subjecting the partition to special conditions. 6. HuIwliDSL felt however that there «ae ranch force in some of Colonel Dickson’s other arguments. There was no doubt, for example, that the oil which had been observed in 1922 lay in the south, rn half of the %one, andit mig&amp;t well be that if the Zone were divided the tribal factors in the case would also operate to the detriment of Kowfeit, 7* S1K AHDBif KYAB said that he was impressed by Colonel Dickson*© conclusions, although he considered that they were to some extent founded on false p ©raises, oir Andrew Ryan thought that in the event ofthe disintegration of Saudi Arabia, the Sheikh 1 s position would not have been altered much, if at all, by the partitioning of the Zone, since in such conditions the Sheikh would merely acquire whatever he could hold, fhe maintenanceof the Heutral Zone unpartitioned would give the Sheikh of Ko.veit no more right to acquire the southern part of it in full sovereignty than if the southern part were nov* made over in full sovereignty to Ibn Saud, T7e should in either case be faced by a further fait accompli , 8* On the question of the tribal grazing rights in the Heutral Zone, Sir Andrew Ryan found Colonel Dickson’s arguments impressive, and he recalled that Mr. Rendel had warned Fuad Bey that there might be serious difficulty on that score. MR.RBHDBh nevertheless did not think the difficulties insuperable. He pointed out that certain tribes, notably the Huwalla, roamed and grazed freely through the deserts of Syria, Transjordan and northern Hejd. The same freedom miiht be obtained by com© special agreement for the tribes which now grazed in the Heutral Zona. 10. Similarly there were no fortifications in the Heutral Zone at present - a fact which as pointed out by Colonel Dickson was doubtless very convenient for the/5* the Sheikh - but this state of affairs might equally be perpetuated by agreement, in he event of the Zone being partitioned. 11. SIH A KPS S HTAIf . reverting to the question of grazing rights, said that he understood Colonel richaon*8 view to be that the existence of these grazing rights w s a consequence of the neutral charact r of the zone. The true position might well he, in tic absence of any treaty provisions, th t they could only be exercised with the sanction of both rulers. However that might be it was evidently possible that the existing practical position might be seriously disturbed by a partition of the zone. IE, As regards th question of oil. Sir Andrew Ryan believed it was still very uncertain where the deposits would actually be found. then 13* SIR ATOIfiiW YAH/ observed that on both occasions when Fuad Hamza had spoken of the possible partition of the heutral Zone, he (Sir Andrew Ryan) had beenstruck by Fuad Boy*o appearance of throw!ig out the suggestion, not as one which he or his Gover meat advocated but as a solution which might be r.sorted to if all els© failed, MB* B. RSiih said he had formed the same impression. SIR AKDIIB: RYAh thought therefore that it might be possible to shelve the proposal and only take the matter up again if and when the Saudi Government reverted to it, aft r all other possible solutions had been discarded, 14. Our best policy might, he suggested, be to keep the idea in mind with all the necessary safeguards for grazing rights, non-fortification etc., and for the equitable division of/6. 17/. of the oil rights* but to treat it as a Sis alley , and,if an opportunity occurred, to discourage Fuad Haiusa froia pursuing it any further. .ItdXfHvvAliSb said that he had two points to ifliaice. The first was the psychological reaction on the Sheikh of broaching a subject such as the present with him. This had already been touched on by Sir Andrew Byan. Mr.Laithwaite, while prepared to agree that some of Colonel Dickson*s premises might be open to question, said that the India Office were nevertheless convinced that it would be a psychological error, in the light of Colonel Dickson* s remarks, to raise the question with the Sheikh, particularly at the present time. He pointed out at the same time that, however imperfect the Sheikh*s rights in the Neutral 2one might be, Xbn Saud*s were of course 210 better, and he thought the Sheikh would probably prefer not to exchange his present half-rights over th# whole zone for full rights over half of it* 16. Touching the question of tribal rights in the Neutral 2one, Mr.Laithwaite recalled the unlucky history of the relations between the Koweiti tribes and Ibn Saud. The Sheikh, by the Convention of 19E2, had lost the Mutair and the a jm&amp;n, and of the great tribes which had been Koweiti before the War now retained any standing of importance only in regard to the Awazim. The tribe whose rights would be most affected if the fone were divided would be the Koweiti Awazim, who would have to spend most of their time in the Saudi sector arid would become liable for Saudi zakat. The fact that partition would involve a still further reduction even of the small influence which he still exerted over this tribe was likely by itself to render the proposal unpalatable to the Sheikh.17* Mr.Laithwaite’ s second point was, he said, of a yery different order, and concerned the negotiations between the Iraq Petroleum Company and the Standard Oil Company of California which had been progressing in secret during the summer, and which were now on the point of being formally opened in London# 2?he Standard Oil Company were of course the concessionaries for the Hasa coast and held the Saudi option for the Neutral done, but the present negotiations had arisen primarily out of the difficulty which their offshoot, the Bahrein Petroleum Company, had met with in their search for a market, for example in the Par East, for their oil. IS# fhe object of the Iraq Petroleum Company was, according to Mr• Fraser (who was acting for the Iraq Petroleum Company), the double one of eliminating independent American interests from the area in question, and of meeting the threat which a very large new production by those interests would constitute in the market# The Standard Oil Company had now intimated their readiness to negotiate and their Chairman himself was expected in London at the beginning of November for that purpose. 19# Mr.Praser had emphasised that it was too early to say what sort of arrangement, if any, might be reached: but he had Indicated that no transaction was likely to be entirely satisfactory to the Iraq Petroleum Company which did not result in the exclusion of the Standard Oil Company from independent operations in the Gulf Sheikhdoms and from Ibn Baud’s territoryj and that the Iraq Petroleum Company were anxious to secure as a minimum a 50^ interest in the operations of the Standard Oil and subsidiary com allies in this area. Other possibilities, according to Mr#Fraser, were a deal about marketing, the effect of which would be to give the Bahrein Petroleum Comp&amp;v some8« share in markets at present closed to them* in return for some understanding as to volume of production; the buying out of the Bahrein Petroleum Company altogether; joint operation; or an arrangement under which the position in Bahrain remained unchanged* but the Ira^ Petroleum Company in return for marketing concessions to the Bahrein Petroleum Company secured counter-concessions from the Standard Oil Company in respect of the riusa area* 20* Mr.Laithwaite added that any agreement which might result from the present-far-reaching negotiations would of course have to be squared with the rights of the local rulers, and be pointed out that no such agreement could fail to affect the future of the Neutral Zone. The possibility that the Ira*i Petroleum Company might secure a share or even a control of the Bahrain and Hasa concessions was one of the highest importance to the interests of His Majesty^ Government. It was therefore necessary to proceed with the greatest circumspection in dealing with the proposed concession in the Neutral Zone, and the existence of these negotiations seemed to him a stx*ong argument against pursuing the question of partition. 21. In reply to Sir Andrew Ryan* who said he had heard of recent meetings being held at Bahrain between three different oil interests* Mr.Laithwaite explained that in response to an invitation from the Bahrein Petroleum Company three experts representing the constituent elements in the Ira^ Petroleum Company (with the exception of the French* who were not directly associated with the present discussions) had gone to Bahrain in order to test at first hand the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s estimate of the quality of their oil. The French group were however known to be very suspicious of these manoeuvres* and it was/was significant that an enterprising frenchman, M. de Montaigu, had chartered an aeroplane at Baara and had flown direct to Bahrain in order to investigate on their behalf. .^lil &gt;UluK h'd RYah added that he had heard something of theae discussions a few days earlier from Mr.Hamilton of the btandard Oil Company of California who, though apparently anxious to be communicative, had spoken too casually to be very lucid. Sir Andrew Ryan had gained the impression that all the local oil interests were engaged in the present discussions. bb. M,L«_I«AITH^AXTE replied that he understood that all the groups of the Ira^ Petroleum Company (viz: the Anglo-Persian jil Company, Royal Dutch Shell, the American and the French groups ) could claim to be consulted and to be given an opportunity of taking up any concession in which the Iraq Petroleum Company, as such, was interested, but that in practice any two groups could work such a concession. Mr.Hamilton no doubt had had this in mind. 24. MR. RRRDKL then summarised the views which had been t considered at the meeting and suggested that agreement h ad been reached on the following points:- (1) that in view of the hoped-for outcome of the oil negotiations now beginning, it would be preferable for His Majesty f s Government to keep fluid the situation in the Koweit Heutral Zone, anct thus preserve intact the Sheikh’s right of veto for use if nece oary, (2) that nothing would be lost by thus delaying progrss, (3) that it would be better not to risk antagonising the Sheikh at this A v juncture by broaching the idea of a division of the Koweit Neutral Zone. 35. Mr.Rendel, though unable to regard Colonel Dickson’s arguments/28./ lOo arguaents aa ©ntirely sound 9 said hts h’id nevertheless reached the same conclusion, viz: that nothing should be donefor the time being* AH1)Klij^ YAff agreed that he would rather pursue some other line for as long as possible. MR* RK14DKL. continuing, said that if the Saudi Government should return to the charge by asking whether His Majesty’s Government had formed any views regarding Fuad Bey's proposal, it was of course open to ua to reply ”You must first clear up the contusion which has been ’♦created by your promising the concession to both candidates ♦♦at once’** Mr*Rendel thought however that such a reply would be liable to expose His Majesty’s Government to ^charge of cbstructiveness* 26* ME. JOHNSTOMB asked whether the Saudi proposal could nt be communicated privately to the Sheikh. The Sheikh would certainly turn it down at once,and we should then be able to tell the baud! Government that His Majesty’s Government^ in consequence, thought it useless to go on with the idea* Mi-l» BEaDKL doubted whether sub a reply would find much credence with the Saudi Government, and Sir ndrew Ryan pointed out that the whole proposal might only be an idea of Fuad Bey’s, and not i one which could be represented to the Sheikh as emanating officially from the Saudi Government* 27* MR. LAITH1AITE reminded the meeting that the Koweit oil negotiations must not be overlooked. He suggested that we might inform the Saudi Government that after examining the past history of the Jtfeutral Zone and the reasons for its creation, His Majesty’s Government greatly doubted whether, in view of the obvious and serious difficulties which a division of the Neutral Zone would raise, the Sheikh would he willing to entertain the Saudi Government’s proposal#€&gt; 11. a8 ' SIR,.AMEH^w &amp;YAB saia that he would prefer to wait until hxa return to Jedda and see whether Fuad Bey revived the matter. m, k&amp;iWEL then suggested that in that case the best line might be to do nothing at all, but Sir Andrew Ry»n was doubtful whether His Majesty’s Government could coniine themselves to a purely negative attitude and insist indefinitely on the Saudi Government clearing up their difficulties with the two Companies lirst of all. He enquired further what attitude His Majesty’s Government would adopt in that event towards ,tr.Ydlibi and hia Syndicate, if either the Saudi Government or Mr.Jansen were to seek a definition of that attitude. a9 * Mt.„,LAlTH!iAlTK explained that as ar.Jansen had gone to Africa io: some months, it was not to be expected that Mr.Ydlioi would be very active in the near future. 30. After some further discussion, it was agreed that, in view of the following considerations (l) the improbability, on the information available, that the Sheikh would consider favourably a proposal for the division of the heutral Zone, (2) the x'ortheoming oil negotiations, (3) a possible settlement radically altering in favour of His Majesty’s Government the whole state of oil politics in the Persian Gulf, (4) the unsuitability, in view of the Koweit oil negotiations, of the present time for approaching the Sheikh with such a proposal as Fuau Bey had ...uUc, \b, .he iact that His Majesty's Government were under no obligation to pursue the matter with the Saudi Government, \ i j Piififi Bfcy biiould “to i* ©viv© 'tti© nuat»'t&lt;sr &gt; iiT ii© wished to, and (ii) if he aid so.

My dear Fowle, Just a line to let you know that Holmes in conver sation with me, yesterday, mentioned that he had it on very good authority that 'Miller' of the Standard Oil Company in Hassa, was making all preparations to have a go at Qatar as soon as the I.P.C. time limit (May 10th) expired* 2. If Holmes is not inventing, this means that he will carry out his threat (made to you personally here if you remember) of following on the heels of the Standard Oil, if and when they show their hand. 3. Who, Holmes will represent^ then, I have not been able to discover yet, but from hints which he occasionally lets drop, it would seem to be a British concern. 4. I wired you of the mysterious telegram which I got from Philby saying that he was due in Kuwait about 7th April - Today (8th April) he has not yet put in an appearance - The Shaikh naturally thinks he is coming to give support to the Saudi Commissioners and am inclined to think so too. There is just the possioility however, that he may be coming in connection with a Neutral Zone Oil concession: There are strange rumours that he has lately mixed himself up with the standard The Hon’ble Lieut-Colonel T.O. i’owle, C.B.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R S.Oil Company of California and is now one of their men. This is in the nature of a confidential tip' only, so far. 5. You may rely on me to watch Philby if he turns up.

NOTE OF DI3CU33IQN WITH ME* REX JANSON AND AoR. YDLIBI OF THE. ANABIAN D EVELOPMENT SYNDICATE AT THE INDIA OFFICE ON 2nd APFIL 1935 . Mr. Hex Janson ana Mr. Yalidi called dy appointment to-day. On arrival Mr. Yalidi handed me the translation, copy of which is attached, of a letter dated 20th Fedruary from the Saudi Ministry of Finance, together witn the Arabic original. The second reservation in that letter made it clear that Saudi approval of the grant of a concession to the Arabian Development Syndicate was subject to the overriding option of the o^anaara Oil. I pointed this out to Mr. Yfilibi ana said that this was precisely what we had thought last year was probably the case. He replied that he also agreed that it made tire position exceedingly difficult and that since the date of receipt of the letter he had had considerable telegraphic correspondence with jedda. He had now received the cablegram dated 24th terch, copy of wnich is attached, which made it clear that the Sauai Government were not prepared to modify this reservation before the agreement of the sheikh of Koweit haa been obtained. I said that I was afraid that so far as Government was concerned no progress was possible in these circumstances. We could not reconmend the sheikh Of/of Koweit to consider anyt ling which was not a firm offer chid it was quite clear that the sauai undertaking to Mr. Yulihi was subject to the overriding rights of the Standard Oil, whatever these might. It would he impossible for us to allow the sheikh to be manoeuvred into the position of a bargaining counter. 4. Mr. YQiibi saia tnat he felt that he hau been very badly treated; that the Saudi Government had given him no intimation when he first entered into discussions with them ana secured an undertaking from them that there was any such overriding option. The option appeared to put the standard in a position to block all development of the Neutral zone. He uuite agreed that no progress was possible in present circumstances and he proposed therefore to proceed at once to Jedda and discuss the matter with people on the spot. What advice would H;M,G. give him? 5. I said we could give him no advice; this was a matter entirely for him to decide. But prima facie it looked as though discussions on the spot might be preferable to a lengthy correspondence, Mr. Ydlibi added that he would be quite candid and would admit that he had received overtures from Mr. Hamilton of the Standard Oil, wno had intimated to him that the Standard Oil would be very glad to discuss matters with the Arabian Development .syndicate. His reply had been that the Syndicate would have nothing to ao with Americans and he had not followed up any of the subsequent suggestions by parties connected with the Standard for meetings or discussions.3 6. Mr. Ydlibi adaed in conclusion that he would let us know the result of his discussion with the Saudi Government. J.G.

The misunderstanding which ocoured in the case of Traders Limited (one unfortunate result of which has been to involve your Excellency in the displeasure of His Majesty’s Government) has emphasised the importance of a clearer understanding as to the position in regard to concessions in Your Excellency’s territory. His Majesty’s Government consider that in order that the position should beexpressed in a clear and unambiguous form it is most desirable that Your Excellency should undertake not to grant concessions of any kind nor to enter into discussion with any party in regard to any concession whatssoever save with the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government, who should be kept fully informed confidentially of all details in regard to any such negotiations, and I am to request that Your Excellency will give an assurance accordingly.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to our interview of 3rd April last, when I advised you of the position of negotiations in regard to the Neutral Zone Oil Concession. I referred during the course of this interviev; to developments 'between the Government of His Majesty King Ihn Saud and His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait and advised you of my intention t o proceed to the Hedjaz and to follow up the matter there. I duly arrived in the Hedjaz on the 19th April and proceeded the following day to Mecca, where I had the honour of being received in audience by His Majesty the King. I was also received by members of His Majesty's Government with whom I was able to have a full and frank discussion in regard to my Company's application for a Concession covering the Neutral Zone. The result of these conversations was that I received confirmation that His Majesty's Government now find themselves tied up by a previous promise to the Standard Oil Company of California in respect of the Government's share in the above-mentioned area; and I was informed that it was because of this promise that the Government found it necessary to insert Section II in their letter to me which is still in your possession. As/1 / 2 - r v__ As a result of our discussions it is considered that the practical way for solving this matter would he for His Britannic Majesty’s Government and/or His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait, to agree, as the Saudi Arab Government have already agreed, to accept the draft Concession submitted by us to the Saudi Arab Government and accepted in principle by the latter; but that His Britannic Majesty’s Government and/or His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait should add a stipulation that the Concession must be in the name of a British Company, be exploited by British Capital and be non-transfenable to any but a British Company. If and when we obtain such a letter containing a definite stixDulation and a clear condition of the terms upon which our application for a Concession covering His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait’s share of the Neutral Zone would be entertained, I shall present it to His Majesty’s Government who feel that they will then have good reasons for requesting the Standard Oil Company of California to define its attitude regarding this point, and who then hope to succeed in persuading the Standard Oil Company to forego their right of priority- During the course of an interview with Sir Andrew Ryan, His Britannic Majesty’s Minister in Djeddah, I communicated the substance of my conversations with the Saudi Arab Government to him, and he informed me that it would be preferable for me to get in touch with the Foreign Office or the India Office in London, within whose jurisdiction such matters fell, as either the one or both of these Departments were empov^ered to take decisive action on a project like the above.3* I would aad that I am sure that if' my Company could secure a letter from His Britannic Majesty's G-overnment and/or His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait on the lines indicated, or if His Britannic Majesty's Government would agree to our procuring such a letter, it would be of considerable assistance to my Company and our application lor this Concession because this would, as it were, open the door for the Saudi Arab Government to enter into negotiations with the Standard Oil Company of California with a view to persuading them to cede what they at present believe to be their right in the Neutral Zone. Once this could be arranged it would be possible to exploit the area with British Capital and in British interests only. I shall not be revealing any secret if I add that the Saudi Arao Government Officials are strongly desirous of dealing with Britishers in preference to other Nationals provided such British interests are willing to proceed with the development of the country. I am of the ojoinion that some effort should be made to meet the Saudi Arab Government’s request in this instance, as by taking the fullest advantage of this opportunity we shall certainly be instrumental in establishing British interests in Saudi Arabia. I shall be grateful if you will kindly let me have your reply to this letter by air mail at your earliest convenience, at the address given below, to enable me to proceed with my negotiations in regard to the Neutral Zone Concession. I have, &amp;c., (Sgd.) A. YDLIBI. Address me:- C/o. H.C. Hammond, Apartment 43, Block 'C', 140, Sharia Emad-el-Din, Cairo (Egypt).. ■% t Reference VDQ/10/31 .

My dear t CONFIDENTIAL Kuwait Peceif t j Dated ^ I i^as very interested in para. 60 (c) of your Intelligence Summary No. 1935 in which you say that the Standard Oil Company of California is trying to exchange the southern half of their HASA concession for a new area of equal size lying to the northwest of their present concession. We have, up to the present, heen able to obtain no information as to the terms of the concession granted by Ibn Sa’ud to the Standard Oil Company; you apparently have a good deal of information on the subject, and I shall be very glad if you can let me have any details of this concession. .eutenant Colonel H.R.P. Dickson, CIE. Political Agent, KUWIAT. tTSECRET. D.O. No. C-153. Political Agency, Kuwait. The ESrd liay 1935. My dear Vachell, I % # ' &gt; .f ^ i Thanks very much for your Secret D.O. No.VDG/lO/31 dated the 3rd May 1935 regarding the exact limits of the Standard Oil of California’s Hassa Concession. £. (a) Firstly, let me tell you that I have been very fortunate lately and have been able to get 'right from the fountain head' of the Saudi Government (though X am not at liberty to say actually how I got it, or by what means) an exact copy of the English version of the Standard Oil Corapany’s concession as granted to Ur. L.N. Hamilton of that Company by Bin Baud in May 1933. This X am now sending to you, and you will see that it defines the boundaries of the concession, and quotes money figures etc. where these were withheld from the public before. (b) The only copy of the concession previously known to ipe, and as far as I am aware also to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, was the 'abridged' edition as published in the Mecca Newspaper 'Um al ^ura' No. 4r4B of Blst iiabi’ al Awal 1352 (14th July 1933), translation of which was sent to the Foreign Office London under British Legation Jedda’s No.235 dated 25th July 1933, with revised translation under Legation’s No.3256 dated 28th November 1933 (copies of both of which were passed to me by .ng Commander J.L. Tachell, M.C. , Air Head-quarters British Forces in IRAQ, HINA 1 P 1 (IRAQ)me by the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf under his Printed Letters Ho. 1100«£i of £5th august 193b and Ho. 1998-S of 30th December 1933 respectively. (o) If you will compare the text of the 'unabridged' concession which X am now sending, with the translation of the 'Um al i^ura' version sent to London, you will find that almost every single article has been doctored, items omitted, and more important still, boundaries not defined. Secondly (a) Regarding para 60(c) of my Intelligence Summary No. 6 of 1935, which has interested you - I have now learnt from the same umimpeaohable source, as before, that the iunericans do not so much want to exchange the southern portion of their Hassa concession for a new area of equal size lying to the north west of their present concession, as to aooulre the new area in addition to their old one. Should they fail to get this 2nd area on easy terms from Bin Saud, then and only then they propose an exchange, or rather a reorientation of their Hassa concession making its greater length from Bast to West in stead of North to South as at present existing. It is Just as if you placed a long rectangular piece of paper exactly covering the Hassa concession and then keeping the northern portion as the fixed axis mpved the southern portion of the paper upwards and to the left so as to the practically east and west. (b) I further understand that Bin Baud gave the iunerioen geologists a pretty useful 'telling off' for having entered the passim zone, without his permission, but later, when their plan was explained to him, and he saw a prospect of getting another large sum of money out of them, for the new area, he relented and gave them a prospecting license only , for the new * area. (c) Holmes here has, I think, already got hold of the story of the above new and to ray mind most important move, for when Lhilby was here, he, in my presence, plied Philby with some very3 :- soma very pertinent questions, which all bore on what I now know. But then Holmes usually gets hold of things weeks ahead of anyone else. (d) The part that is attracting the -Americans to the ^ssim and Jebel Shaunaar areas, is, I understand, the fact that they have discovered there some extremely old rock formations (similar in fact to the Bahrain formations). This they consider of vital importance and likely to lead to the location of an oil field in passim, as well as give them the information they have long been trying to get (but have hitherto failed) in Borth Hassa, with a view to selecting the right site for an oil well there 3(d) 4. My authority for para $ is the American geologists here, who seam to have a mysterious inkling of what their brother geologists in the rival company are doing (but keep this to yourself). 5. I am passing a copy of your letter VDG/10/31 &lt;bf Srd May on to Colonel J’owle at Bushire, as well as a copy of this letter and enclosure (unabridged and original Hassa concession) as I consider they should be forwarded with all speed to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. Yours sincerely,3SCRBT. Copy of Text of the ^011^ Agreement between the 'Standard Oil of California” and H.M. King Abdul- Aziz Al Baud. Received E5.4. 1935. 0 Q 0 This agreement made between Shaikh Abdulla Suleiman Al Hamdan Minister of Finance of Saudi Arabia, acting on behalf of Saudi Arab Government (hereinafter referred to as the 'Government”), of the one part and L.N.

Article S . If this contract has not been terminated within eighteen months from the effective date hereof, the Company shall make a second payment to the Government, amounting to twenty thousand pounds gold, or its equivalent. The due date of such payment shall be eighteen months from the effective date hereof bu the Company shall have fifteen days from the due date within which to make the payment. Article 6. Upon the effective date of this agreement the Company shall commence plans and preparations for geological work, so planning the work as to take advantage of the cooler season for more efficient work in the field, and of the hotter season for the necessary office work of compiling data and reports. In the event, the actual field work shall commence not later than the end of September,1953, and it shall be continued diligently until operations connected with drilling are commenced, or until the contract is terminated. Article 7. Within ninety days after the commencement of drilling, the Company shall relinquish to the Government such portions or the exclusive area as the Company at that time may decide not to explore further, or to use otherwise in connection with the enterprise. Si llarly, from time to time, during the life of this contract, the Company shall relinquish to the Government such further portions of the exclusive area as the Company may then decide not to explore or prospect further, or to use other wise in connection with the enterprise. The portions so relin quished shall thereupon be released from the terms and conditions of this contract, excepting only that during the life of this contract the Company shall continue to enjoy the right to use the portions so relinquished for transportation and communication facilities which however shall interfere as little as practi cable with any other use to which the relinquished portions may be put. Article 8 . The Company shall commence operations connected with drilling as soon as a suitable structure has been found, and ia anv «vent if the Company does not commence such operations within ttoefyears from the end of September 1933 (subject to the tnre&lt; f A-n-MniP 25 hereof), the Government may terminate thiI4 contract.

Upon the discovery of oil in commercial quantities the Company shall advance to the Grovermaent the sum of fifty thousand pounds gold, or its equivalent, and one year later the further sum of fifty thousand pounds gold, or its equivalent. The due date of the first advance shall he the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities, as provided in Article 8 hereof, and the due date of the second advance shall he one year later. In each case the Company shall iiave sixty days following the due date within which to make the advance. Both ,of these advances are in account of royalties which may be due/the Government and consequently the Company shall have the right to recover the amount of these advances by way of deductions from one half of the royalties due the Government. Article 10. Since it has been agreed that the annual rental of five thousand pounds gold, or its equivalent is payable to the date of the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, and since it has been agreed also that the annual rental is to be payable in advance, it may happen that the last annual rental paid prior to the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities will cover a period beyond the date of such discovery. In case that this period should be equal to or greater than one-fifth of a year, the proportionate amount of the five thousand pounds gold, or its equivalent corresponding to such period shall be treated as an advance on account of royalties due the Government, and consequently it should be ^ recoverable by the Company by way of deductions from one-half of the royalties due the Go*vernment.

We note your statement of the position in regard to the undertaking which the Saudi Government have given to the Standard Oil of California and recognise your difficulties; but we fear that in the circumstances you describe no progress is possible on the lines you propose.- As I explained to you at our meeting on 2nd April, His Majesty's Government would not be prepared to advise the Sheikh of Koweit to consider any proposal in regard to the Neutral Zone which is not in their view a firm offer, and it is, in their view, clearly impossible for a firm offer to be made on behalf of your Syndicate so long as that offer is subject to the overriding rights of the Standard Oil Company of California under their agreement fdlibi Esq_. , with/ Vo.

I said that I was not yet in a position to say definitely what the attitude of would oe, as consultation with the other interested Departments was proceeding. But speaking for myself I thought that the situation had not changed since our interview on 2nd April. I thought it most unlikely that would be prepared to accept a proposal such as that put forward by ^.r.-dlibi. Their consistent attitude had been that they could not ad\-se the Sheikh of Koweit to consider propositions put forward m respect of the Koweit Neutral Zone oil unless those propositions not only were satisfactory in themselves, but also represented a firm offer. It could now Do ^o*,tended that the Company was really making a firm offer so long as the Standard Gil option persisted. 3.

Mr.Jans on said that in effect if the option could not he got rid of the Heutral Zone would remain unexploited, with consequent loss to the Sheikh of Koweit.

He is now in Damascus, on his way back to England by car, having motored from Riadh via Koweit and Baghdad. He says that in Koweit, although the guest of the Resident, he was under obvious suspicion because it was thought that he had gone there to negotiate for an oil concession* He said that Dickson told him that he had received c*&amp;&gt;led instructions from Powle telling him to instruct the Shaikh of Koweit not to enter into any discussions about oil with philby. Nevertheless, when philby called on the Shaikh the latter, although Philby had been at pains to point out that he had no connection with oil interests, told him that he would have welcomed him jjust as warmly as a negoiator in oil as a friend.

This question, although not at present urgent, is bound sooner or later to arise if oil is discovered. We note that Mr. Skliros stated in his letter of the 24th October that the provisions of the C^atar Government Agreement would be generally acceptable to the new Comprny. As you know, this agreement (like that for Kuwait) deals \ with the question of a refinery in a somewhat unsatisfactory manner by a mere declrration of intention on the part of the Company to erect a refinery if commercial conditions justify it, and to examine the matter with K.M. Government when commercial production is assured. Every new concession granted in countries bordering the Persian Gulf accentuates the importance of the refinery question and it would be most unfortunate if the greater p?rt of the territory were developed without any binding obligation on the part of the Company to build at least one refinery. We do not think that the relaxation of our requirements in this respect in the Qatar and Kuwait concessions, in each / case after long discussion with the companies , is a good reason for accepting the same position without further dis cussion in p py future concessions. We feel, therefore, that ne w / 3. Walton,Esq., C.B. ,M.C., India Office, 8. W.l.new dreft concessions should contPin the approved standard refinery clause and that any relaxation should be agreed to only when good reasons are forthcoming. He do not suggest that there is any necessity to raise the matter in this form with the Company at the present stag but in view of Mr. Skliros* reference to the qatar agreement we think it desirable that the Company should be reminded that the erection of a refinery or refineries in territory under British influence in the Persian Gulf is one of the prime desiderata of H.M.Covernment. Perhaps, therefore, you would be good enough to include such a reference in your reply. Apart from the foregoing we have no comments to offer on your proposed action. Copies of this letter are being sent to Air Vice Marshal Courtney, Rendal and Starling. Yours sincerely, sd. E.A.SEALCONFIDENTIAL. S' ^o. 1054-8 of 1935. cov rr) : 03 tit * 93 % ?

The questions raised have been under consideration in consultation with the other Departments of His Majesty’s Government concerned and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and I am now to inform you that the proposals are approved on the following conditions and understandings. Bahrain . There is no objection to your Company applying to the Shaikh of Bahrain for a cone ees ion, on the understanding that any concession granted would be subject to the conditions consideed necessary to safeguard Government interests; these conditions would be embodied in e separate agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government. 3* Muscat .

S’f sought before the Comprny entered into negotiations with those rulers, and that any actual concession eventually granted would be subject to such conditions,embodied in en agreement with His Majesty’s Government (which might be of a special character, in view of the peculiar juridical position of the aone), as were considered necessary to safeguard British political interests. 5. Shaikhdoms of tne Truci^l Coast . The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are being informed that His Majesty’s Government approve the options already granted to them by the Shaikhs of Has al Kbaimah, Sharjah and Bebai on the following conditions, and on the same conditions there is no objection to the transfer of those options, and of any others that may be obtained on the Trucial Coast and approved by His Majesty’s Government to your Company i- (a) that any geologist or employee who visits any of the Truoial Shaikhdoms for the purpose of exploring or surveying the area of the option should be of British nationality. If, however, your Company should make the application of which the possibility is foreseen in the penultimate paragraph of your letter for special permis sion for Mr. N.K.Baker, an American citizen, to visit are* s on the Trucial Coast, the question of making an exception in his particular cese would be considered in consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf} (c) that the Shaikh concerned should give a definite guarantee in writing (as to which he would be approached by the British political authorities) that he would be responsible for the safety of the exploring or surveying party; (d) that if it is desired during the currency of an option to enter into negotiations with the Shaikh concerned for a concessioi , the prior rpproval of His Majesty’s Govern ment to the opening of negotiations would be sought and in the event of its being given, the conditions to be attached to any concession obtained, in orderto safeguard Government interests, would be considered end the approval of any actual concession would be subject to acceptance by the Company of these conditions. 6. The conditions to be embodied in any agreements relative (b) that any exploring or surveying party in their travels would be definitely guided by the views of the Resident as to where they should go; to /to concessions would be considered in consultation with your Company when the time came, and might vary somewhat according to the locality in which thdconcession was sought, I am to add that as you are aware, the erection of a refinery or refineries in territory under British influence in the Persian Gulf is one of the prime desiderata of His Majesty 1 ?

You refer in the third paragraph of your letter to the 3. Walton Esq.

But recent efforts to cone? to an arrergenen 4 - have broken dovm. ''his, I think, may have th^ result of stimulating the action of the new Company in these Persian (Vulf Arenas. I am interested to see t at Mr. fkli^os is inclined to take up an option for the remainder of Bahrein, ' here may not be much left that is v^ry valuable on the main inland/ but per haps the shallow waters and other islands may be worth investigating. Subject to necessary safeguards such as you refer to in paragraph 7 of your letter, I think we should encourage the Company to go ahead with their plans. As regards paragraph f*, I was not present at the meeting of the Middle Bast Cub-Committee when the policy in regard to the Truoial Coafc* *;as discussed but I have since seen the record of the meeting and I think that here again, provided proper arrangements such as you suggest are made, we ought not to bar this territory from investigations. I have already dealt above with the point you raise in paragraph °. I agree wi + h paragraphs 10 and if? of your letter. In regard to paragraph 11, we do not much like the selection of Major Holmes as the Company’s Representative the t'or/negotiat ion of concessions.

He is well aware that he may not make commercial advances to the Rulers without consulting with you, and asks if you could find it convenient to let him see you, in particular with regard to approaching the chiefs of the Trucial Coast. If you are, for example, going to Bahrain- 2 . / to Bahrain in the next few weeks he could meet you there, or anywhere else you wish, but he fears that he my not be allowed into Iran. 7.

I hear that Holmes has reached Kuwait and should be so grateful if you would inform me by telegram of any indication that he is coming to Bahrain or wanting to go up the Trucial Coast. 2. It would also interest me to know whether he has got on his passport visas for (a) Bahrain, and/or (b) Qatar or any of the Trucial Coast places. Would it be possible for you to check this off his passport, when it is presented for registration. 3. Another point very interesting to me is who his f jackals 1 are to be now*. I gather that Husain Yatim (nephew of Muhammad Yatim) is scared of Holmes’ return to Bahrain and Muhammad Yatim was said some time ago to have had a quarrel with Holmes. 4.

With rer^r&gt;ence to my letter of 31st January, P. Z• 677/d&amp;-f Q^rd previous correspondence regarding the p^ oposalo oi pe croleum Concessions Limited, I enclose conv ted'30th ^ nuary. with six enclosures, of the Company's reply to our official letter of 12th December. Copy is also enclosed of a demi-official letter which I sent to Skliros on 4th February, and his reply dated 6 th February. 2. We shall of course be consulting you further, after obtaining the preliminary views of the other Departments of His Majesty's Government, regarding the various draft concessions enclosed with the letter of 30th January from Petroleum Concessions Limited. 3. The point on which I want to consult you at the moment is the procedure in regard to the approval of the options already obtained by the Anglo Iranian Oil Company xrom the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast. The original proposal/ he Hon'ble Lieutenant Colonel T.C.W.Fowls, C.B.E., BUSHIRE.proposal of Petroleum Concessions Limited in their letter of 24th October was that they should take transfer of these options from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and we have signified that we would approve the grant of the options and their transfer on the conditions set out in paragraph 5 of our letter to Petroleum Concessions Limited of 12th December. The two Companies now propose a somewhat different procedure - viz ., that the options should not be transferred, because for technical reasons (presumably the wording of the option agreements) they are not transferable, and suggest that the approval of the opening of negotiations for actual concessions might be given at the same time as approval of the options. Skliros and Lefroy called here on 6 th February, and I explained to them that it may be some little time before approval can be given to the opening of negotiations for actual concessions on the lines of the draft concessions which they have sent us. In accordance with paragraph 5(d) of our letter of 12th December approval has yet to be given to the commencement of negotiations for actual concessions, and though it is probable that we shall be able to give it, the question has yet to be decided in consultation with/with the other Departments and yours elf &gt; and might take a liu tie time to consider from the point of view of the possible commitments which would be involved in the eventual grant of concessions. (Two points which might have to be considered are ? for example, the southern boundary of the Abu Dhabi concession, and the general principles which we might have to get clear in our ov/n minds in advance in regard to the sort of provisions that should be made for the protection of the concessionaire. I dare say there will be no great difficulty on either point. Skliros suggested at our talk on 6 th February that the southern boundary of the concessions might be &amp;^t indeterminate and said that he saw no reason why the Company should not agree that any operations to work a concession would be confined within whatever distance of the coast we pleased. But these points have to be considered.) I informed Skliros and Lefroy that we would let them have an official reply to the Company's letter as soon as possible, but that there must be some little delay on account of the necessity of consulting 1 the other authorities concerned. Meanwhile it is probable that Holmes may be able to fillin time by starting work in regard to the Bahrein concession and pernaps visiting Muscat, though he will not make any start at all until we inform Petroleum Concessions Limited that he may do so. 4, No, vith i 01 eionce oo one procedure in regard to the existing options;; there seem to be two alternatives - (1) oo approve the grant of the options to the Anglo-lranian Oil Company at once, on that Company agreeing to conditions (a), (b) and (d) and the Sheikhs concerned agreeing to condition (c); ( 2 ) go postpone approval of the options (a course to which the Anglo-lranian Oil Company have no objection) until we are in a position to approve the opening of negotiations for actual concessions, then to approach the Sheikhs in regard to condition (c), to explain to them the proposal that negotiations should be opened by Petroleum Concessions Limited, and then approve at the same time both the options and the opening of these further negotiations. The second alternative seems to have the merit of making one bite at the cherry with regard to the Sheikhs. It will in any case presumably be necessary for someone to/t&gt;. to explain to the Sheikhs how it comes about that, though it was the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company which obtained the options, it is Petroleum Concessions Limited which is negotiating xor concessions* It wi11^ of course^ primarily be for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company representatives in the Gulf to do this, and we understand that they will be instructed to introduce Holmes and give the necessary (explanation, but it will perhaps also be desirable that you, when the time comes, should inform the Sheikhs that His Majesty's Government approve the opening of negotiations under the options by Petroleum Concessions Limited through Holmes, and that it will be understood that any concession concluded can only be granted subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government. As, therefore, it will probably be desirable to approach the Sheikhs at the time when Holmes opens his negotiations, you may think it the simplest and least troublesome course to postpone till then the approach to them in regard to the approval of the options and condition (c). Could you kindly let us know by telegraph which course you think preferable from your point of view? 5*/5. We are assuming, in view of your telegram of 4th December, Do.996, that you have no objection to the employment of Holmes as the individual to be entrusted by the C am pan 3 ; w ith t he n e g 0 1 i a t i on s . 6 . Since this was written, Lefroy telephones that his Company are advised by Elkington that they should explain to the Sheikhs forthwith the present position in regard to the options and the proposal which is being made to His Majesty’s Government that their affiliated company, Petroleum Concessions Ltd., should negotiate concessions. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are instructing Elkington to act accordingly, subject to your prior approval of the messages to be sent to the Sheikhs. I do not think that this development greatly affects the choice between the two alternatives suggested above in regard to our own procedure, since when the proposal that P.C.L. should open negotiations for concessions has been approved by His Majesty’s Government, it will still no doubt be necessary or desirable that you should inform the Sheikhs that this is the case.IN THE NAME OF GOD THE MERCIFUL This is an Agreement made at Kuwait on the day of 1936, corresponding to the day of between His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmed Al-Jabir as-Subar, Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire and Companion of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India, the Shaikh of Kuwait, in the exercise of his powers as joint Ruler with His Majesty King Abdul Aziz al-Saud, King of Saudi Arabia, of the territory known as the Neutral Zone, which is more particularly defined below, on his own behalf and on behalf of and in the name of his heirs and successors in whom is or shall be vested for the time being the joint control of the Neutral Zone of the first part (hereinafter called 'The Shaikh') and Petroleum Concessions Limited, a Company registered in Great Britain under the Companies Act, 1929, its successors and assigns (hereinafter called 'The Company') of the second part.

Air Jt lail » LONDON, S.W.l 7th February, 1936. With reference to my letter of 31st January, P.Z.677/36, and previous correspondence regarding the proposals of Petroleum Concessions Limited, I enclose copy, with six enclosures, of the Company’s reply to our official letter of 12th December. Copy is also enclosed of a demi-official letter which 1 sent to Skliros on 4th February, and his reply dated 6 th February. 2 . he shall of course be consulting you further, after obtaining the preliminary views of the other Departments of His Majesty’s Government, regarding the various draft concessions enclosed with the letter of 30th January from Petroleum Concessions Limited. 3. The point on which I want to consult you at the moment is the procedure in regard to the approval of the options already obtained by the Anglo Iranian Oil Company from the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast. The original BHSHIRE.vf *&gt; 2 . proposal of Petroleum Concessions Limited in their letter of 24th October was that they should take transfer of these options from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and we have signified that we would approve the grant of the options and their transfer on the conditions set out in paragraph 5 of our letter to Petroleum Concessions Limited of 12th December. The two Companies now propose a somewhat different procedure - vi_z• ; that the options should not be transferred, because for technical reasons (presumably the wording of the option agreements) they are not transferable, and suggest that the approval of the opening of negotiations for actual concessions might be given at the same time as approval of the options. Skliros and Lefroy called here on 6 th February, and 1 explained to them that it may be some little time before approval can be given to the opening of negotiations for actual concessions on the lines of the draft concessions which they have sent us. In accordance with paragraph 5(d) o_l our letter of 12th December approval has yet to be given to the commencement of negotiations for actual concessions, and though it is probable that we shall be able to give it, the question has yet to be decided in consultation with/'V /! 3. with the other Departments and yourself, and might take a little time to consider from the point of view of the possible commitments which would be involved in the eventual grant of concessions. (Two points which might have to be considered are, for example, the southern boundary of the Abu Dhabi concession, and the general principles which we might have to get clear in our own minds in advance in regard to the sort of provisions that should be made for the protection of the concessionaire. I dare say there will be no great difficulty on either point. Skliros suggested at our talk on 6 th February that the southern boundary of the concessions might be kept indeterminate and said that he saw no reason why the Company should not agree that any operations to work a concession would be confined within whatever distance of the coast we pleased. But these points have to be considered.) I informed Skliros and Lefroy that we would let them have an official reply to the Company's letter as soon as possible, but that there must be some little delay on account of the necessity of consulting the other authorities concerned. Meanwhile it is probable that Holmes may be able to fillrapffem in time by starting work: in regard to the Bahrein concession and perhaps visiting Muscat, though he will not make any start at all until we iniorm Petroleum Concessions Limited that he may do so. 4. Now with reierence to the procedure in regard to the existing options;; there seem to be tv/o alternatives ~ ( 1 ) to approve the grant of the options to the Anglo-lranian Oil Company at once, on that Company agreeing to conditions (a), (b) and (d) and the Sheikhs concerned agreeing to condition (c); (2) to postpone approval of the options (a course to which the Anglo-lranian Oil Company have no objection) until we are in a position to approve the opening of negotiations for actual concessions; then to approach the Sheikhs in regard to condition (c), to explain to them the proposal that negotiations should be opened by Petroleum Concessions Limited, and then approve at the same time both the options and the opening of these further negotiations. The second alternative seems to have the merit of making one bite at the cherry with regard to the Sheikhs. It will in any case presumably bo necessary ror someone to/5 . 'I to explain it was the . options* it to die Sheikhs how it conies about that* though AnglO'-lranian Oil Company which obtained the is Petroleum Concessions Limited which is negotiating lor concessions. It will* of course* primarily he for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company representatives in the Gulf to do this* and we understand that they will be instructed to introduce Holmes and give the necessary (explanation* but it will perhaps also he desirable that you* when the time comes* should inform the Sheikhs that His Majesty’s Government approve the opening of negotiations under the options by Petroleum Concessions Limited through Holmes* and that it will he understood that any concession concluded can only he granted subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government. As* therefore* it will probably he desirable to approach the Sheikhs at the time when Holmes opens his negotiations* you may think it the simplest and least troublesome course to postpone till then the approach to them in regard to the approval of the options and condition (c). Could you kindly let us know by telegraph which course you think preferable from your point of view? 5./i 5. VJe are assuring, in view of your telegram of 4th December, Ho. 995, that you have no objection to the employment of Holmes am the individual to be entrusted by the Company with the negotiations. 6. Since this was written, Lefroy telephones that his Company are advised by Elkington that they should explain to the Sheikhs forthwith the present position in regard to the options and the proposal which is being made to His Majesty’s Government that their affiliated company, Petroleum Concessions Ltd., should negotiate concessions. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are instructing Elkington to act accordingly, subject to your prior approval of the messages to be sent to the Sheikhs. 3. do not thinx that this development greatly affects the choice between the two alternatives suggested above in regard to our own procedure, since when the proposal that P.C.L. should open negotiations for concessions has been approved by His Majesty’s Government, it will still no doubt be necessary or desirable that you should inform the Sheikhs that this is the case.p. 2. 759/36 IrlDIA OFFICE, f * WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 4th Fehmary, 1936 . Dear Mr. Shliros, We have received your official letter of 30th January, enclosing a copy of draft concessions for the Koweit Neutral Zone, Bahrein, Has al Khaimah, Ahu Dhabi, Dehai and Sharjah. 2. We shall he sending an official reply to your letter after the necessary consultation with the other Departments concerned and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am sending you this demi-official letter because there is a point of procedure in regard to the Trucial Coast negotiations which it seems desirable to get settled. 3« The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (or the D’Arcy Exploration Company) have obtained options from the Sheikhs of Has al Khaimah, Sharjah, Debai and (as we learn from a telegram from the Political Resident of 1st February) Abu Dhabi and Ajman. The first step is to give approval to these options on the conditions set out t Skliros, Esq. , in/ Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. , City Gate House, E.C.2.2 . in paragraph 5 of my letter of 12th December. One of -chese conditions, viz . , (c), has to he agreed to by the Sheikhs concerned, and it will be desirable that the position in regard to the options should be clear to them who-n Jo lone 1 Fowle approaches them in regard to condition (c). For this reason would it not be convenient that as a first step - before Colonel Fowle ax)proaches the Sheikhs - your Company should take over the options from the Anglo-I rani an Oil Company and that the position should be explained to the Sheikhs by that Company’s representative in the Gulf or perhaps by Colonel Fowle, when he approaches the Sheikhs about condition (c) ? We have not got a copy of all these option agreements, but we have one of that concluded between the Sheikh of Ras al Khaimah and the D'Arcy Exploration Company, in which I see that it is provided that the Sheikh will not negotiate with any other than that Company with regard to exploring for oil during the two years period of the option. If your Company now takes over the existing options at once and it is explained to the Sheikhs that this being done, the position would appear to be simplified. Colonel Fowle would/V * would, not have to approach th© Shsikh twite© in regard, to condition (c) - once as affecting the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and. again as afiecting your Company. Moreover the Q-PP-^oval of the options obtained by the Anglo—Iranian Oil Company and of their transfer to your Company could be given at the same time. 4. When the options have been approved, we shall then have to consider the question of the approval of the opening of negotiations for actual concessions from the Sheikhs concerned, as foreseen in (d) of paragraph 5 of my letter of 12th December. This question (in connection with which the draft concessions you have forwarded would be taken into consideration) must, I fear, necessarily occupy some little time, though we shall expedite it as much as possible. I am therefore wondering whether it would not be better to postpone for the present Major Holmes’s departure for the Gulf until the question of entering into negotiations: for actual concessions from the Trucial Coast Sheikhs is further advanced. 5./5. I see that the Eoweit Neutral Zone draft is for a five-year option, hut also for a concession if the Company declares its intention of taking one up. There are, as you know, very special considerations in regard to the question of the Xoweit Neutral Zone and the position is further complicated hy the fact that the Saudi Government is believed to be committed to another company, and it was for these reasons that we contemplated in paragraph 4 of my letter of 12th December that the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government would be sought for entering into negotiations with the Sheikh and Xing Abdul Azis, if it should later become possible for your Company to seek a concession from those tw r o rulers jointly. It is a difficult question whether the teims of an actual concession should be embodied in the option agreement to be offered to the Sheikh of Koweit , since the concession itself, if granted, would have to be obtained and held from Ibn Saud also, a.nd it might perhaps be a more convenient course to wait until it is possible to seek approval for negotiations with him as well as the Sheikh of Koweit before drawing up the terms of an actual concession. This would not preventtlie Company seeking an option from the Sheikh of Koweit in the meantime. I merely refer to this point, however, at this stage, as it is a difficult one on which we shall have to let you have our considered views when we reply officially to your letter. 6. We are glad to avail ourselves of your offer to let us have additional copies of the drafts. We shall have to consult the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and also the Poreign Office, Admiralty and Petroleum Department. Is it possible for you to let us have four additional copies of the drafts for this purpose ? I hesitate to ask you for so many, unless you happen to have them already available. But could you in any case let me have one additional copy of each to send immediately to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf by this weeks mail 9 Yours sincerely, («d/) J.

I have discussed with Mr, Lefroy the formal transfer of the frucial Goast options, but although the two companies concerned are in entire agreement over P.CfL* negotiating and obtaining the Concessions in its own name, I gather chat technically the options themselves are not transferable; Mr, Lefroy has offered to clear up this matter with you. 3, She operation of para.5(c) of your letter of the 12th December will not arise for some time; the D’Arcy will not be sending out anyone, and P-C.L. does not propose to launch an exploratory party of two or three geologista unti 1 0 ct ob e r next. Mr, Holmes has already left, but he does not propose to wander along the frucial Coast; his proposal was to take up residence in Bahrein, where the company will be in funds at the Eastern Bank, and with tne ap pi oval of the Political Resident to request the Eulers of the frucial Coast to call one at a time, discuss terms, sign, and lake away their bags of Rupees* 4„ it will be necessary, of course, for the D’Arcy to notify each Ruler that Mr* Holmes is negotiating uith its full approval on behalf of P.C.L., and I hope that you can instruct the Political resident to conj-irm to60*0/1 RiiX. 6 i i/licib olio CcLiiaiaature ox IP ,Ci»L • ^ vioo 'bii© D’Arcy ? io 0*0ospfceioXo go His Mr.jg sty’s Guvermncn't* It would be most unfortunate if the Rulers, having granted, these options to the B’Arcy, should maintain that Concessions can be granted only to the D 1 Arcy, and not to P ,e .L • j as you are aware the D’Arcy is unable to hold these Concessions* 5* I agree that the Koweit Heutral Zone presents a distinct problem; recognising that it is impossible to negotiate simultaneously with the Sheikh and with King Abdul Asia, I endeavoured to lay down in the draft the terms which would be binding on the Sheikh; similar terms would then be offered to King Abdul Aziz * If they do not reach his minimum, the terms must either be increased until he is satisfied - in which case the Sheikh would receive corresponding benefit ~ or the idea of obtaining a comprehensive Concession over the Neutral Zone would have to be dropped* In the latter alternative P.C*L* must pay to the Sheikh the whole of the option money that it will have contracted to pay during the five-year option period; it can then either retire from the scene, or it can elect to pay the increased yearly payments that will become applicable after the initial five-year option period, and persevere with King Abdul Axis* I have accepted it as an essential preliminary to a successful negotiation of this Concession, having regard to the oil rights being • under co-interested ownership, to bind one of the parties to certain definite terms, otherwise a negotiator appealing in turn to the Sheikh and then to King Abdul Aziz would be consigned from pillar to post. I am aware that King Abdul Aziz has. bespoken his share of the oil rights in the Neutral Zone to the Soandara Oil Company of California; he is reported to have hedged• ',•* 8.-X u on .lit g.c| .

The Under Secretary of State India Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1 . Sir, I must apologise for the delay in a your letter of the 12th December, 1935 (Z.8856/35), a delay occasioned by the desire to send with this reply copies of the terms which it is proposed to offer to the various Rulers for concessions on their respective territ ories. (2) I assume that the conditions which His Majesty’s Government would attach to their recognition of the concessions in which my Company is interested are conditions similar to those embodied in the separate Agreements concluded between the India Office and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in respect of the Qatar Concession, and such - or similar - conditions my Company will accept, subject only to the observation that the refinery obligation if apiflied separately to each one of the concessions may introduce an altogether uneconomical burden. (3) Refineries. Nine concessions are involved, i.e. Neutral Zone, Bahrein, six on the Trucial Coast and Qatar; some of these must be barren, but assuming that oil were found on two, or even three, of them, it by no means follows that the amount of oil found on each concessionary area could support a refinery.(6)/ I would, therefore, propose tluat in accepting as applicable 'to all 'tl'iese concessions 'ttie provisions of Clause 9 of the Agreement of 5th June, 1935, between His Majesty 1 s Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Canpany Ltd. , relative to O.atar, there should be an understanding that not more than one refinery is in question for the Persian Gulf area. (4) I enclose, in duplicate, copies of draft concessions for the Koweit heutral Zone, Bahrein and the Trucial Coast. The Neutral Zone and Bahrein drafts differ somewhat from the Trucial Coast drafts. The drafts for Al-Ajman and Umm-al-Quaim will be similar to the drafts for the other areas in the Trucial Coast; the amounts payable will differ, but the other conditions are precisely the same in all the Trucial Coast drafts. It is my Company’s intention eventually to form separate companies for holding and working each one of these concessions, and provision is made in the drafts for the automatic transfer to such a d hoc British companies. I can agree to accept in the separate agreements, which my Company will be required to execute with the India Office, that the transfer can be effected only to such companies as are approved by the India Office, each Company in turn being required to enter into similar agreements, or you may hold the parent Petroleum Concessions company responsible for the due observance by these companies of all the terms of the said separate agreements. (5) The special conditions attached to the Trucial Coast (para.5 of your letter under reply) are accepted.( 6 ) Major .Frank Holmes, whose employment as negotiator has already been proposed, will arrive at Koweit towards the middle of February; he has been instructed to report to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and not to enter into any negotiations before he has obtained the Resident’s approval; he is to acquaint the Resident with the terms of the concessions, to keep him informed of progress, and of the final terms as agreed between him and the Rulers concerned, before he signs. I am ab your disposal to review any of the conditions in the enclosed drafts, and to discuss such alterations as you may wish to propose. t 7 ) MUSCAT• Major Holmes has been instructed to notify the Sheikh that he will be calling on behalf of my Company to discuss an oil concession during the course of the next two or three months; the terms will follow the lines of the Trucial Coast concessions. ( 8 ) YEMSU. I have requested from the Foreign Office permission for my Company to interest itself in a concession over the coastal area of the Immam’s territories, but I understand that this requires the concurrence of the Colonial Office, for which I shall be applying. The approval of the Resident at Aden will be sought before any negotiations are set afoot in that direction. ( 9 ) I shall be glad to have your approval to proceed on the above lines, and if it is not asking too much would yoJ be so good as to notify accordingly the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, with copies of the various draft concessions, that it is proposed to offer to the several Rulers/Rulers; I can let you have further copies if you require them. Yours faithfully, (Sgd. ) J.Skliros, Director.fcrJ CO Z. 8856 / 35 . 12th December* 1935. A - ^ Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India / A to refer to your call at the India office on 23rd Octoher / &lt;una your letter oi 24th October, 1935? regarding the proposals of Petroleum Concessions Ltd., subject to the approval of xiis Majesty , s Government, to seek for oil concessions in the Koweit neutral zone, the unallotted part of Bahrein, the Sheikhdoms of the Trucial Coast, cjid possibly Muscat# The questions raised have been under consideration in consultation with the other Departments of His Majesty*s Government concerned and one Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and I am now to inform you that the proposals are approved on the following conditions and understandings. 2. Bahrein. There is no objection to your Company applying to the Sheikh of Bahrein for a concessio on the understanding that any concession granted would be subject to the conditions considered necessary to safeguard Government interests; these conditions would be embodied in a separate agreement between the Company and fiis Majesty’s Government. 5* Muscat. There would be no objection to the Company applying to the Sultan of Muscat for a concession . C. 2. on/on a similar understanding. 4* Koweit neutral zone. Application may be made to the Sheikh of Koweit for an option over his part-interest in the zone, on the understanding that, if it should later become possible for the Company to seek a concession from him and King Abdul Aziz jointly, the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government would be sought before the Company entered into negotiations with those rulers, and that any actual concession eventually granted would be subject to such condition embodied in an agreement with His Majesty’s Government (which might be of a special character, in vie?/ of the peculiar juridical position of the zone), as were considered necessary to safeguard British political interests. 5* Sheikhdoms of the Trucial Coast. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are being informed that His Majesty’s Government approve the options already granted to them by the Sheikhs of Has al Khaimah, Sharjah and Debai on the following conditions, and on the same conditions there is no objection to the transfer of those options, and of any others that may be obtained on the Trucial Coast and approved by His Majesty’s Government to your Company;- (a) that any geologist or employee who visits any of the Trucial Sheikhdoms for the purpose of exploring or surveying the area of the option should be of British nationality. If, ho?/ever, your Company should make the application of which the possibility is foreseen in the penultimate paragraph or your letter for special permission for Mr. r.S. Baker, an American citizen, to visit areas on the Trucial Coast, the question of making^an exception in his particular case would be considered in consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gult; os/(Id) that any exploring or surveying party in their travels would he definitely guided hy the views of the Resident as to where they should go; (c) that the Sheikh concerned should give a definite guarantee in writing (as to which he would he approached hy the British political authorities) that he would he responsible for the safety of the exploring or surveying party; (d) that if it is desired during the currency of an option to enter into negotiations with the Sheikh concerned for a concession, the prior approval of His Majesty 1 s Government to the opening of negotiations would he sought and in the event of its being given, the conditions to he attached to any concession obtained, in order to safeguard Government interests, would he considered and the approval of any actual concession would he subject to acceptance hy the Company of these conditions. 6 . The conditions to he embodied in any agreements relative to concessions would he considered in consultation with your Company when the time came, and might vary somewhat according to the locality in which the concession was sought. I am to add that as you are aware, the erection of a refinery or refineries in territory under British influence in the Persian Gulf is one of the prime desiderata of His Majesty’s Government. 7* It is noted that your Company will keep the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf informed of any negotiations with the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Kov/eit tne Sultan of Muscat or other rulers.

The Under Secreta^ of State, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l Sir, I have the honour to refer to my conversation yesterday with Mr. J.C.Walton, at which I indicated that, subject to the a proval of His Majesty’s Government, my Company, petroleum Concessions Limited, proposes to seek for oil concessions in the territory known as the Neutral Zone, the unallotted part of Bahrein Island, the Trucial Coast, and possibly along the Pirate Coast to Muscat. Petroleum Concessions Ltd. was registered as a private British Company on the 14th instant; the whole of its shares will be held by the same interests and in the same proportions as obtain in the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the Board will be of similar composition, excepting the appointment of an Iraqi Government Director. The concession recently obtained by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited from the Ruler of Qatar will, at an appropriate time, be transferred to Petroleum Concessions Limited, together with the Agreements relative thereto concluded with His Majesty’s Government; the provisions of these Agreements are generally acceptable to Petroleum Concessions Limited in their application to oil concessions obtained over the above named territories wherein my Company recognises, and will respect, the existence of a spe cial/♦ &gt; V 2 . special sphere of influence of His Majesty’s Government. There will also be transferred to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. options for oil concessions recently obtained by the Anglo-lranian Oil Company Ltd. from the Rulers of Ras-el-Hhaimah, Sharjah., Dubai and any other options obtained by that Company on our behalf in the Trucial Coast. The negotiations for the actual concessions will be undertaken by Petroleum Concessions Ltd., and in that connection it is proposed to employ Major Frank Holmes, who is acquainted with Persian Gulf matters and who, to the best of my belief, can be entrusted to conduct such negotiations with proper observance of the customs of those countries. The terms to be offered will be based on the terms of the Qatar concession with suitable adjustment of the cash payments in relation to the respective approximate areas of the concessions;, the actual boundaries will be defined at a later stage as and when they are demarcated. The wishes of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the employment of British subjects in these areas will be observed, but I foresee possibly applying for special permission for the Company’s Chief Geologist, Mr.H.E.Baker, an American citizen, to visit these areas to compile a report on their oil potentialities.
