The design of the back is detailed with finely incised lines and regular line flow. The proportions of the top are well balanced. The piece is simply made with good workmanship. \r\n\r\nThe scarab functioned as an amulet with kingship connotations. The amulet refers to all-inclusive divine protection, royal power, and perfection.
