Mr. Bottomley and about. 10 people from the Jabal. tfie Assistant Political Agent though not invited attended the meeting. ±Tie three main points for discussion were: (a) How to provide funds for the Chaplain's journey from Basrah to Bahrain. (t; Where church meetings should be held in Bahrain. (c) How people were to be notified of a proposed Church Service. (a) It was decided that whenever possible the Chaplain would do the journey from Basrah to Bahrain in one of His Majesty’s sloops or aeroplanes. His return fare by British India Steam Navigation Company's steamer being provided for by subscription amongst Chinch of England members of the Bahrain Corrmunity. It waa decided that the Chaplain should endeavour to come down three times yearly,namely,January May and October. It was proposed that Church Services should be held in the American Mission Church which had been offered for the purpose. (C) A committee to be elected and to be asked to2 to accept this responsibility. Also to go further into the matter of (b) above. A comnittee was elected to carry on these discussions in the absence of the Chaplain. Members: Mrs. Belgrave, Honorary Secretary. Mr. de Grenier. Mr^. Sc inner. Mr. Davies (Bapco).

'e put him up and (though not of his denomination) arranged services for him. 2 . A local Committee has been formed by members of the Church of England with a view, among other things, to raising money for fares in the hope of enabling the Chaplain to corne to Bahrain three times a year. Stewart^ as a member of the Church of England, is serving on the Committee and can see that nothing undesirable is done. The Arabian Mission have, I understand, kindly offered tho use of their Church. 3. % In his original letter to ne the Chaplain wrote: M Bahrain, as you probably know, has the doubtful privilege of being within my Parish, and since my arrival here at the end of October, it has weighed heavily on r y cnscience.'* After making him welcome and offering to nut him up, I added to my reply:- n I am sure that the Community will appreciate your visit, but, in connection with your writing that Bahrain is within your Parish, T feel that I ought to mention that I have no record of this and that I believe that ether ecclesiastical authorities also claim that Bahrain is within their sphere.” 4.

I enclose a copy of his letter dated the Ibth January 1937* 4. I have no feeling (or standing) in the matter ecclesiastically, but from the political point of view, I should prefer the Church of England in Bahrain to look to Canterbury and Jerusalem rather than Ispahan for guidance. // The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel T.C.

No. 290-16/29 of 6th February on the subject of the Rev. Bowyer’s visit to Bahrain and the question as to whether Bahrain is or is not within the diocese of Isfahan. Colonel Fowle does not think that the matter need not be pursued further. ^Jcru^&gt; f-W fC To Lieut-Colonel Gordon Loch G.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. ^0 X/7 1At 6 p.m. on the evening of the 16th March 1937 a Church Committee meeting was held in the house of tht; Adviser. The following members of the Committee were present:- Mrs. Skinner who was a member of the Committee, had not been informed of the meeting and was not present. She was spoken to on the telephone and asked that she might be informed of the business conducted at the meeting later. Mrs. Belgrave started the meeting by reading to the Committee a letter received from the R e verend W. tf • Archdeacon of Jerusalem, who wrote that Wt Reverend Bowyer nad informed him of the formation of cJl C hurch Council in Bahrain and that both he and the Bishop were glad to heaf^Lt. He wrote that he had been informed that the Committee had been nj^nnimiR mi as to how best they could subscribe to the expenses involved in arranging for periodical visits of the Basrah Chapla to Bahrain, whether the subscription should be paid direct to the Chaplain in the form of payment for ser vices rendered or whether subscription should be made to the Church as a whole. He himself was in favour of the latter course. He also asked that a copy of the minutes of the Committee’s meeting should be sent to the Bishop. 2. Mrs. Belgrave also read an extract from a letter she had received from the Reverend Bowyer in which the Reverend Bowyer said that he had been in Communication with the Air Vice Marshal who had agreed that whenever possible he would arrange for free transport in one of His Majesty’s aeroplanes for the Chaplain from Basrah to Mrs. Belgrave, Secret' — Captain A.C. Stewart Mr. de Grenier Mr. and Mrs. Carter Mr. Kirby SaOWA^. dloujiAT &gt; WstfBahrain. 3. After reading these two letters the Committee entered into general discussion on the following points (a) In what manner subscriptions should be collected and whether they should be paid direct to the Chaplain or paid in the form of subscription to the Church in general. It was decided that it will be better to pay any subscriptions direct to the Chaplain. After giving the matter due consideration it was agreed that in the event of the Chaplain being unable to obtain free transport from the Royal Air Force or from His Majesty’s ships, the approximate cost of each visit to Bahrain would be Hs 240/-, rs 180/- bein g the cost of return fare from Basrah to Bahrain, Ks 60/- being allowed for incidental expenses such as taxis to and from Jabal, taxis from the Chaplain’s house to the docks at Basrah, tips, etcetera. The cost, therefore, for three visits annually would be about Rs 720/-. The Committee agreed that they should aim at collecting Rs 720/-. It «was thought that it would not be difficult to find at least 20 members of the Church of England in Bahrain who will be prepared to subscribe a maximum of Hs 36/- each. Each member of the Committee guaranteed that if it is In order to gain a rough idea as to how many members of* the Church of England wore living in Tanrain and how much they were prepared to subscribe, it was decided to send round a circular notice informing the members of the Church of England that it had been arranged for thejf Chaplain from Basrah to pay periodical visits to Bahrain and the maximum cost of each visit would be Rs 240/- and asking for subscriptions to meet the expenses involved. A copy of the circular notice which necessary they would subscribe tkcmaximum amount of Rs 36/-is to be sent round will be attached to this note when received. Mrs. Belgrave agreed to find out her self the names of all members of the Church of England living in Manamah. She was to do this in consultation with the wife of one of the clerks of the Adviser 1 s Office who could supply the names of Indian Christians living in Manamah. Mr. Kirby volunteered to find out from Commander &gt; the manager of the per sonae! of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, do?, many - members of the Church of England were employed at the Jabal. 4. The second question mi; discussion was the place where Service^.vuu^ to be held when the Chaplain visited Bahrain. It was decided to accept the offer of the American Mission(the offer had been made during the previous visits of the Chaplain to Bahrain) to make use of the American Mission Church. At the same time for convenience of the members of the Church in Jabal, it was decided that the Bsttiw** Petroleum Company should be asked whether they have any objection to the Service being held in the New Th^swre which is at present under construction. 5. ^xyyQhestion was also raised as to what steps should be taken to buy Hyt** ^ooits. It was decided to leave this to a later meeting. 6. Mrs. Belgrave, Secretary of the Committee, volunteer ed to give accommodation to the Chapiain whenever he visited Bahrain. If Mrs. Belgrave should be absent from the station, Mr. de Gpanier and other members of the Committee agreed that they would accommodate the Chaplaia. 7. It was agreed that the minutes of the meeting should not be sent to the Bishop.March 17, 1937 At the suggestion of various nembers of the Bahrein community a committee has been formed to arrange three visits a year of the Church of England civil chaplain from Basra. These visits are likely to be in January, May and October. It will be necessary to guarantee the chaplain*s expenses to 8c from Bahrein, which it is known will not exceed Rs. 240. each visit. In order to meet these expenses the Committee would be grateful if members of the Church of England would indicate on the detach able slip below the amount of support which they would like to contribute.

The Reverend James Hume arrived on the 4th April and stayed at the Agency as a guest of Colonel and Mrs. Loch. 2. A Service was held on the verandah by the dining room in the Agency on the 9th April. 3. A circular letter had been previously sent out concerning the Service, and a congregation of 45-50 assembled including 9 naval ratings from H.M.S. Shoreham and H.M.S. Fowey. 4. One of the large wooden screens was placed across the west end of the verandah. In front of it was a reading desk (borrowed from the Mission) draped with a flag Union Viceroy. In front of the desk, a table with a white cloth, but no flowers, candles or other decoration. Tennis chairs for the congregation were arranged four abreast with a small aisle to right and left. A single chair for the Minister was placed in front of the front row of chairs. A hymnary was placed on each. Actually, owing to the large congregation, there was a slight shortage of books. 5. The Minister entered about 18.35, when the whole congregation save 3 was present. 6. The service lasted approximately 40 minutes and on its conclusion the Minister stood at the head of the Stairs shaking hands with each member of the congregation as they left. Sd. G.

He asked what it would cost and I said that I thought about £400 or £500 a year f and that of course it would be necessary to ask the Oil Company to provide a house. Thornburg made it clear that he hoped that if a clergyman were appointed at Awali he would minister both to the spiritual and bodily needs of their young men. In other . ords, he hoped he would look after their games and recreations generally, including such things as the library, arranging musical concerts and so on. And he also made it cleai that he thought that if a man was to be successful he would need to te a fairly robust individual with the type of personality that will appeal to people of the rough and ready kind. I said that I believed you had the very man in mind, though I am afraid I did not make a note of hie name and I am not sure if he is at present in Jerusalem or in England. Thornburg would very much like to meet your man and suggested a rendez vous at Alexandria on his way back to Kurope. I am afraid there is not very much time to arrange this as, although Thornburg* s dates are not finally fixed yet, I anticipate he will be going off fairly early in Staly. If your man* is in Jerusalem at present and it is possible to arrange for him to get to Alexandria quickly, could you send me a telegram Just The Bishop in Jerusalem f St. Ceorge’s Close, Jerusalem. saying/-II b M 1 - 2 - saying:- n X can arrive Alexandria by Y date”. Then If this arrives before Thornburg leaves, I will send you another tele gram saying exactly when he Is due In Alexandria. 2. I am afraid this is all very rushed, but things will move so much more quickly if only Thornburg can handle them, and so 1 hope we shall be able to arrange a meeting. If not we shall have to go about the matter a little more slo;vly. Yours sincerely, ' f 8Dio: 3^ Political Agency, Bahrain, 17th February 1943, Thank you for your letter of the 10th Feb ruary.

Can you help with any funds for the construction of a church or the provision of a clergyman? The latter la a question which we shall presumably have to leave to the end of the war ae no obe is likely to be available now — in fact the oast of building will probably compel us to defer construc tion till then. The Oil Company may give a grant towards the Church, and if we can combine the clergyman in a school* master for English children, they might possibly find a portion of his salary, and I hope for a capitation grant from the R.A,F. and possibly the Koyal Mavy. I am writing to the Archbishop of Canterbury on another matter and will enquire if he has any funds from which he can help us and will let you know the result* 5* Uy proposal therefore is to launch an appeal for a Pro testant church to be built at Manama under the authority of the Bishop of Jerusalem, the funds already collected to be utilised for this purpose, and I should be glad to know whether it meets with your approval* The provision of a permanent clergyman will be taken up when men may become available and the actual construction of the building will be put in hand when circumstances permit* The stained glass windows which I intend to donate are actually in my possession and available* Copy to the Adviser to the Government of xiahrain Bahrain,1944.

Belgrave, Bsquire, C.B.E., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain.Telegram GTC From Political Agent, Bahrain. To Political Resident, Bushire. No. 41 Dated 16th January, 1946. • • • • • Bishop of Jerusalem is visiting Bahrain, seventeenth to twenty first January and staying with me =POLITICAL=m ; | l The Hevd Mr.Westlake arrived after lunch on the 26th January 1933 and stayed the night,going off after lunch on ik the 27th January 1933. 2. He had intended to hold Evensong on the evening of the 26th and Holy Communion on the morning of the 27th. As, however,there was a possibility of T Id starting on the 27th, he agreed to combine the services on the evening of the 26th. About 20 seats were arranged in the east inside verandah and a table with white cloth and silver candle sticks at the north end of the verandah, ihe congregation faced north. It was noticed that a number of the congregation,including Mr.Belgrave, the nevd Mr.Hakken and Mr.de Grenier appeared in flannels. There was perhaps some excuse as tennis had been put off the da- before for th Chaplain r s visit but,I think,that on a future occasion a hint should be given to the European Community that su^h dress is inappropriate. At the opening of the service the Chaplain explained that he proposed to ai hold Ho^y Communion in the evening on account ol the possibility of the T Id beginning next morning an^ also saying that he would welcome anyone willing to Participate even though they were n-t of the membership of the Church of England. It was not known whether the Chaplain -ould bring a suppiy of prayer books and so on and copies were tyr&gt;ed of Ps~lm C and the paraphrase^®# ”0 God of Bethel”. The Chaplain was apparently pleased that tdis had been none,though he brought his own Army Prayer and hymn books. it would be well in the future to have a row of cushions in front of the Alter table on which people could kneel and also to leave more room than was left between the Alt^r t»ble ana the first row of ^heirs,a good three yarns would be suitable. After the service the congregation went into the drawing room and the Chaplain was introduced to them. They were given drinks and smokes. 3. Mr.de drenier is apparently a high churchman and did not.MMT' 2 . wish to communicate without having fasted beforehand. He, therefore,asked the Chaplain if he would give him the Communion the next morning,which was done. It wa&lt;= proposed that Mrs. ■^elgrave^ nurse should come to the Communion in the morning at the same time as Mr.de Grenier,but she eventually did not come. 4. r ihe Chaplain had a collection during the service for the ^unas of the Chaplaincy. 5. it is understood that the Basrah Chaplaincy extends from T Amarah to Muscat and that it is under the direct orders of the archbishop of Ca'+erbury,or was,until recently,when apparently the Bishop of Jerusalem given certain episcopal powers overs the Chaplaincy. 6. Thre is some doubt as to whether the Basrah Chaplaincy will continue as the Anpdo Persian Oil Company have recently withdrawn their annual donation of £.300 and are going to have a chaplain of their own. I gathered that there was some feeling against th'' present Chaplain’s predecessor in regard to his dealings with th? Oil Company. 7* No music himself. 8. The Revd was possible but the Chaplain led the singing Mr. u akken attended the service.i * / » &lt;£) L \ Tlie arrangements for Church were made in the verandah next to the drawing room at the north end. There was a table v. ith a v.hite lace tray cloth and two silver candlesticks with Ccinciles and &amp; large bov»l with v.hite flowers* A seat was left in the west corner for the Chaplain. 2. The seats were arranged leaving a passage-way up the center* The seats used were cane and ^loyd ^oom furniture in the verandah and tennis chairs. 3. The Chaplain put on his surplice etcetera in the Political Agent*s of lice and walked in when the congregation were ready. 4. A line of cushions was placed before the Altar table on tue iloor ior Kneeling. At jbeast two paces should be left betweei the line of cushions and the front of the front line of chairs. On this occasion there was not sufficient space for those going up to kneel. The windows and curtains were left closed but the electric light was on. ?cl/ Dictated on 24-1-1935. $ nKI'HiB &gt;'I Please let me have a note forthe Etiquette file about church arrangements made during Father Lamb's visit. In fair detail as in my note of 24.1.34 on Etiquette The Reverend L. Lamb, O.C. visited Bahrain # for 3 weeks at the end of July 1935 and early August 1935 by my invitation and the arrangements for his entertain ment were made by Mr Skrimshire and me. He stayed with both of us as our guests in turn. Mass is usually offered in Mr Dias 1 house and was a few times on this occasion. I offered the Political Agent T s Jourt as a permanent chapel for Father Lsmbs f visit and the ofter was eventually accepted. Father Lamb and Mr Lias arranged the Court as a Chapel with a table raised to waist high as altar. I lent my carpets ior the dais. Chairs were arranged below the dais with an aisle in the centre. Fhe objection the priest has to using the Agency is that the subordinate employees in Bahrain, a very laige number of whom are Catholics would not come to the Agency. On the other hand I pointed out that although Mr Skrimshire and I had no objection to going to Mr Lias T house for Mass, some members of the Bahrain Petroleum Company had. Due to the fact thatI I i v I served Mass daily, and people came to know I was a Catholic, the objection to their coming to the Agency was overcome. 12-12-1935 flh. 4 /Wifi' Copy sent to Mr. Thoms for Etiquette file.

On the evening of the 5th January 1936 Father Lamb came to call accompanied by the A.p.A. (Captain Cole). I mentioned to him the question of Mr iellis 1 marriage and explained the difficulty caused by the marriage clashing with the 'At Home' in honour of the Shaikh’s accession. 2. In the same conversation I asked father Lamb what arrangements he had made for his services and offered to let him hold a service in the Court '^oom on Sundays. Father Lamb thanked me for the offer but informed me that he had already established an Altar at the house of one of his flock (actually it is at the house of Mr Dias) and that he thought that it would be better not to move it. I asked him whether he did not have any difficulty as for some reason Americans at the Jabal were not willing to go to Mr Dias’ house.
