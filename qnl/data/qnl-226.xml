These letters are primarily addressed to either the Chief Secretary of the Government of Bombay (either Lestock Robert Reid or John Pollard Willoughby), or the Secret Committee at India House in London. The remainder are addressed to various officers of either the British Government, or the East India Company.The subject matter is primarily concerned with the expansion of Egyptian influence towards Bahrein [Bahrain] and Oman through the conquests of the Egyptian commander Khorshid Pasha [Khūrshid Pāshā]; the expansion of Egyptian power is viewed as a threat to British interests in the Persian Gulf. Much of the volume therefore concerns itself with the efforts of the Resident to unite the Arab tribes of Oman in resistance to the Egyptians. More specific details in relation to this subject are as follows:The expulsion of Sued bin Moottuk from Oman, and rumours of his possible return at the head of an Egyptian force to subdue the region.The efforts of the Resident to secure restitution for the Naeem tribe of Brymee for an attack made upon them by the Beniyas [Bani Yas] tribe of Aboothabee [Abu Dhabi].Negotiations to arrange for the resettlement of Esa ben Tareef [‘Isá bin Ṭarīf] and the Al Ali tribe from Aboothabee to another part of the Persian Gulf, and/or affect a reconciliation with Shaikh Abdollah ben Ahmed [‘Abdullāh bin Aḥmad Āl Khalīfah], Shaikh of Bahrein.The Resident's mediation of a reconciliation between Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd, Imam of Muscat, and Sued Humood bin Azen, Chief of Sohar [Ṣuḥār].Ideas for enhancing the power of influence of the British in the Persian Gulf.The designs of Khorshid Pasha to conquer or subdue Bahrein, and the political position of Shaikh Abdollah ben Ahmed on the island.The deputation of Captain Akins Hamerton, 15th Regiment Bombay Native Infantry, to Brymee to obtain information on the condition of the town's defences, and his later appointment as Political Agent to Muscat.To a limited extent the correspondence relays news from Persia, primarily from Shiraz. This relates to disturbances in that town, rumours related to the travel plans of the Persian Shah (Muḥammad ‘Alī Shāh Qājār), Persian warlike preparations, and any potential threat to the British at Karrack. It also contains a few updates on affairs at Bushire.The British occupation of Karrack [Khārk, Jazīreh-ye] is therefore also covered within the volume; primarily this concerns measures required to keep the garrison supplied, the health of the troops, and suggestions for the improvement of the island's defences. In addition, the matter of Shaikh Nasir's [Shaykh Nāṣir] expulsion from Karrack, and his later restoration to the Governorship of Bushire is also covered.Also discussed within the file is the inadequacy of the strength of the naval squadron stationed in the Persian Gulf, and various methods for addressing this. This is cited in a number of instances as a factor which prevents the orders of Government from being carried out. The volume contains a split index; the first part is located on folio 2, and the second part is on folio 141.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter book</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Governor of Bushire</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Naval Squadron</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shah of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>East India Company, Court of Directors, Secret Committee</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Bombay, Secretary to the Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Abu Dhabi, Āl Nahyān dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commander-in-Chief of Egyptian Forces in Central Arabia</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Egyptian Agent to Oman</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Nāṣir Khān</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Na'īm (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrein</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Brymee</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sheraz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Karrack (island)</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Nedjd</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Naval affairs</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imperial rivalry</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000039#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
