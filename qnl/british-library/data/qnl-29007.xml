Political Agency, Muscat. October 28th f 1941. Captain «J.3. Howes, 11.6.]^., Political Agent, Muscat. The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain. I have the honour to s**y that I have just returned from the coup to D&amp;lalah, 'the capital of the Sultan's province of Dhofar, which was necessitated, as you know, by the prospective inauguration of an air route along the southern coast of Arabia. 2 . As this hitherto isolated part of the Muscat Agency now bios fair to become one of its most important areas, and as the province of Dhofar is that in which Sultans have recently shown a tendency to spend a great proportion of their time, I have been impressed by the real necessity for the building of a dak bungalow there, similar to that at Gwadur, to enable the Political Agent to tour this area at intervals, and so to maintain personal contact with the Sultan during his prolonged absences from his capital. 3. while in Salalah, the Political Agent could effectively control important matters at his main office, as a wireless transmitter and receiver belonging to the Multan are already in operation there} ana communication has been established with Muscat thr ugh Cable &amp; Wireless Limited. Still better communication will be available when theip Ax2 Airways transmitter is installed. The journey by sea to Salalah occupies only four days by launch; and it would be a pity if the beneficial effect of the recent provision of a launch for the Muscat Agency were to be lost, as far as tho maintenance of personal contact with the Sultan and supervision of the ail* route are concerned, by the absence of accommodation for the Political Agent at Salolah. During my recent visit there, I was the guest of His Higjmeaaj but it would not, of course, be possible for Political Agents to depend on his hospitality as a regular thing. 5. Building materials, and unskilled ana serai-skilled labour are available at Salalah, so the erection of a bungalow would not be an expensive matter. At present, Airways have been rent the services of the Sultan’s ntate engineer to supervise the erection of their wireless and meteorological buildings; and X believe that I could similarly obtain the loan of his services if sanction for the work could be obtained fairly soon. It would only be necessary to import timber and a carpenter for the joinery work. 6. I am persuaded therefore that there is a genuine need for this proposal; and that the initial outlay would be far outweighed by the recurring benefit to Govern, mt* Yo I have the honour to be, Dir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Muscat.

I have in mind something on the lines of a Political Naib Tahsildar or a Political Muhamir on the North West Frontier. 3. No Muscat subject is readily available and PI it leal Agent thinks Sultan might object to a subject of another Arab State.

Both previously served in the liinistry of Interior, Iraq. 4.

Please let me have your comments • i am doubt ful whether the Sultan would be willing to pay Rs.420/- for a doctor at Salalah and if he leaves the place in November he will probably lose interest in the matter for the time being. 4* Have the miscellaneous personnel now stationed at Salalah any doctor amongst them and if so does he treat the local population or assist in any way in the State dispensary ? C.J.Pelly Esquire, ICS., Political Agent, Muscat./! By ATR MAIL. Ti.n.Tio.499-5(D)/-^ EXTERNAL AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT, New Delhi, The jtit August 1942, Wil3 you Please refer to your demi-official letter No.C/ ^03 of the 2nd M^f about providing a doctor for the Sultan at ^alalaii As you rightly remark there is an appalling dearth of doctors t^ese dtvs and a whip round all the provinces failed to produce anyone. We^then had to try the Array in order to see .i f t ^ y ^°^i a I '^g^ 1 e man from military service ana we have only just heara o. a name Following your suggestion we had obtained iinancial sanction to meeting the cost of the doctors appointment on th main o^V u that he would be of very great political value and could xunction as the Political Agent's representative in Salalah. Meanwhile, however, things have been m3vins fairly fast in those parts with the developnent of the southern Arabian air route and, particularly a n view of the American complication there now, it sseems inevitable that an officer of the Political Service will have uo be stationed at Salalah for a lorg time to come. Although the Sultan was aocarently rlther dubious *out this when Pelly first went there, we P imagine that he will now be only too thankful to have one ox ou people S on his doorstep in order to act as a responsible go-betwee with such American personnel as may be located on aerodromes in Muscat territory or may be passing through along the ai- reinforce ment route. It follows that there is no longer any real justifica tion for the Government of India to pay the salary of a_doctoi , and if we could still induce the Army to release a man -or ^alalah in spite of the disappearance of the 'political representative content of such an arrangement, His Highness the Sultan v.ould definitely to veto ^y the salary’himself. Doctors are vastly moreexpensive than they used to be, and the particular person reconmended to us, namely Jemadar Mohammed Amin, draws pay at the rate of Rs.270 a me nth and would have to receive a special pay of Rs 150 to cover loss of items such as free rations, field service batta, etc., etc.j and apart from this he would requlr free quarters. 2. tn the light cf the above what are your views 7 Would the Sultan be likely to meet charges of this order or would it be Jitter to tell him that civilian doctors are quite unobtainable the=.e ay , adding that whilo it might be possible to get one released from military employment for him the charges would b' very heavy anu unless he were particularly anxious to have a man there would be a good deal of reluctance at this stage of the war to release even one doctor from essential military duties.

C/Wf - Political Agency, Muscat The 14th September 1942. w * A Please refer to your demi-official letter No. C/849 dated the 5th September 1942 regarding the Sultan*s request for a Sub-Assistant Surgeon at Salalah* 2. May I in the first place suggest that this question now be stripped of its “political representative* content^ entirely ?. You will remember that I have given to you my opinion separately as to the need for such^representative at Salalah during the forthcoming cold weather. I have to add in connection with the proposal for a doctor that I am of the opinion that any non European - I will almost say^non Politi cal service - representative would be valueless at Salalah in view of the new circumstances there referred to in KO paragraph 1 of the enclosure to your letter. Any non European could mot cope with the problems occasioned at times i by the conduct of the Europeans and Americans on the South Arabian air route. 3. In the light of these remarks I think it will be better to reply to the Sultan*s request as suggested by Mr. VJeightman in paragraph 2 of jfchis letter. The Hon’ble Lt.-Col. W.R. Ehy, C.I.E. i Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire•4. As you are well aware, the Sultan is superlatively reticent about the length of his stay in Dhofar. When I saw him last he told ae that he did not think that he would be able to return to Muscat in November. I have heard since that he aay postpone making a decision about leaving Dhofar until April next; if he does this it seems exceedingly unlikely that he will then leave. 5. The R.A.F. at Salalah have an English qualified doctor, one Squadron i-»eader Traynor. I gahher that he had been treating some of the locals and I know that he r^iaaaes the Sultan. Possibly this explains why the Sultan did not press his request for a Sub-Assistant Surgeon when 1 last saw him.TELEGRAM. io) x Telegram From To No. Dated Code. Political Agent, Muscat.

Government of India who have been considering the matter now inform me that civilian doctors are quite unobtainable these days and that while it may be possible to get one released from the military the charges would be very heavy and unless Your Highness is particularly anxious to have a man there would be a great deal of reluctance to release even one doctor from essential military duties.Page 1.
