Included in the file is a petition from a group of Arab merchants to Shaikh Isa asking him to do everything in his power to get more steamers to call at Bahrain to ease the situation.Also included in the file is correspondence with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Chief Political Officer at Basrah [Basra] regarding a complaint from Bin Saud (‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd), Ruler of Najd over the Shaikh of Bahrain's decision to increase transhipment charges. The complaint is dismissed as the political authorities concluded that Shaikh Isa had been well within his rights to increase the customs duty.Other matters discussed in the file include correspondence with F T Maharaj, Director of Customs at Bahrain regarding proposals for the construction of a new pier at Bahrain, and export licences from Bombay for blasting powder and fuses that would be required in the construction work.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Customs policy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001cd#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001cd#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001cd#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
