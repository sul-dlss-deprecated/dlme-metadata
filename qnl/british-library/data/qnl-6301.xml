As to the practicability of the proposal, it would, I believe, be impossible for an Englishman, undisguised, to find Ills vray to Eiadh either from /'atif or Ojair. The Turks would almost certainly, at the present time, prevent him from going throtigh. As regards the route from howeit, I directed my First Assistant, Captain hunt, luring his recent visit to I oweit, to ascertain confidentially from, Sheihh Hubcirak his views on the subject.The Sheikh inform^ Captain hunt that the road was clear h thlst there would be no difficulty in r-j*ranging for an. liiglish officer to visit Hiadh.

Captain I tot further reports that j; .ubsj^al: appeared to bo pleased with the idea, &amp; Sciid that he uiiOii h- it would be a good thing for an English officer to visi’ Baidh.

Ho, as well as Ion Saub», wouf r . I think, look upon it as an open espousal by us of the latter's cause,a:,for the visit is not one which could be kept a secret,this would also be the view tediien by tlie Turks k* Ibn Has-lid. I am further inclined to doubt vrtietiier,by a simple visit to Biadh &amp; back the officer would be able to obtain much intelligence of a useful &amp; comprehensive nature. The information which he would gain would certainly be somewhat one si led. Ho would have, I think, to remain in the country for some time,&amp; this perhaps would hardly be advis able.

[February 15.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. No. 3. Sir N. O'Conor to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—[Received February 15.) In my despatches Nos. 11 and 39 of the 11th and 26th ultimo respectively, I had the honour to transmit Reports by His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah as to the rupture between Sadun Pasba and the Ottoman authorities. In the first despatch above mentioned, Mr. Crow represented the Ottoman Government as not unwilling to come to terms with Sadun, and at the date of the despatch of the inclosure in my despatch No. 39 he reported that the military measures taken against him were of no very drastic character. From a telegram from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Baghdad, dated tl e 11th January, and inclosed also in my despatch No. 11 of the 11th January, it would seem that the Ottoman authorities, while not undertaking any serious punitive action against the Mountefik partisans of Sadun with the regular troops at their disposal, had succeeded in inciting against him the powerful tribes of the Shammer and Aniza, and that a large combined force of these tribesmen was moving against Sadun. On the 3rd February Mr. Crow informed me by telegraph that Sadun had applied to him for advice as to making terms and coming in to Bussorah. In the latter case he asked for a guarantee of safety from the British Consulate. Mr. Crow proposed to inform him that the Consulate could not interfere or help him, and to advise him to surrender at discretion and trust the Sultan’s clemency. As, however, this language might, under certain eventualities, have entailed undesirable responsbility, I thought it better to instruct Mr. Crow to confine himself to advising Sadun that he could not interfere, and that his best course would probably be to make terms with the Turks. Sir N. O'Conor to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—(Received February 15.) (No. 77. Confidential.) I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith to your Lordship the translation of a telegram, dated the 7th ultimo, which I have obtained confidentially, addressed by the Amir Abul Aziz-ibn-Reshid to the Grand Vizier, repeating his request for the authorization of the Imperial Government to attack the Sheikh Mubarak, of Koweit, on the ground that he has attacked and plundered his country, and that he is the tool of the English. I understand that no answer has so far been returned to Ibn Reshid, and I feel pretty confident that the Sultan will hesitate to encourage any action which is likely to encourage further disturbances in districts which are already very troubled.

R. O’CONOR. Inclosure 1 in No. 2. Emir of Nejd to the Grand Vizier. (Translation.) (Telegraphic.) 3a,nuary 7,1904. ***** * We have already explained, by means of the special emissaries charged witn presentmg^ our humble offerings to His Imperial Majesty, that we have never incited or invited the relatives or dependants of Mubarak-es-Sebah to take refuge with us. As regards the relations of these people to us, to whom felsel should they resort for protection ? For, as we are the faithful subiects of Hii Majesty, our friends and the friends of the Caliph are the same. Mubarak Pasha not only did not assent to our proposals and prayers for the restitution of their property and belongings to these unfortunate people, but he has dared to attack our men and slay and plunder them. This diminishes our power and injuriously affects our honour and prestige amongst the tribes Whereas we are still in a position to punish him (Mubarak), and to arrest him and hand him over alive to the Imperial Government, but we have been com- peiled to defer energetic action pending the Imperial orders of the Commander of the Faithful. As for him, he has recently given proof of his relations with and subjection to the English. In fact, we have ascertained beyond doubt that he has been scheming to conclude a Treaty with them, and it is certain that cannon and munitions will be given to him by England and introduced into the country. It is right that the Government should be aware of the difficulties and troubles to which this will give rise in these parts. Our object being to secure peace and tranquillity, to protect the pilgrim route, to prove our fidelity to His Imperial Majesty, and protect our power and prestige from diminution, while he is stirring up much trouble and sedition in these countries—and especially in Nejd and its neighbourhood—and as it is our duty to defend the land of the Kaaba of our worship from sedition and revolt, I beg your Highness to inform me. as soon as may be possible, what steps the Imperial Government decided to take in this matter. Inclosure 2 in No. 2. Sheikhs and Notables of the Nejd Sandjak to the Grand Vizier. (Translation.) (Telegraphic.) January 27,1904. THE proceedings of the Mutessarif Mohammad Talib Pasha are not only reducing the sandjak to ruin, but will bring the greatest trouble upon the State, which is even now beginning to make itself evident. As has happened m the Mountefik, so in this district also, not only the nomad tribes, but the settled rayah population also, is ready to rise and seek other abiding-places, tor pillage, murder, and outrage have come to be the normal state of affairs 12 'cX'13 a Was it for this that the Imperial Government, to please Ahdul Huda Effendi, handed over a faithful population, with all its lands and property, to Talib Pasha ? In spite of the numerous telegrams which we have sent to the First Secretary and to other high authorities, no order has yet come to take from the Mutessarif and restore to us our plundered property. Every one is mourning the blood of his kinsmen, and no one is sure of his life or property. If this time again our complaints meet with no attention, 50,000 people, with their families, are ready to rise a’nd seek the protection of a foreign State, in order to free ourselves from the oppressions and extortions of which we are become the victims.

My informant, however, declared that the Turkish authorities attached little value to the Sheikh’s protestations, realizing that Koweit was lost to them.

This action, it taken, as is probable, with the connivance of the Sheikh of Koweit, is of a piece with the reports of the latter s intrigues, to which I hav e called attention ou several occasions. I am afraid we shall find the Ottoman Government very unwilling to any concession in regard to Bubian Island so long as they are imbued with the idea that Sheikh Mubarek is abetting Bin Saoud in his depredations upon the territory of Ibn-bin-Heshid, of Nejd.

It is affirmed that Bin Jerad was killed, with 400 of his followers, and that his flag was sent to Koweit, and that Abdul Aziz, on his return, met 150 camels, with 1,000 reals, and captured them. It is also announced that Abdul Aziz now proposes to attack Nassim and Bony da, in the Amiri territory. If this is correct, the Wahabee party at Riad will be considerably strength ened; but it is possible that the success of the operations may have been pur posely exaggerated by the Sheikh of Koweit, who supports Abdul Aziz-bin* Saoud in his campaign against the Amir.

He adds that the Sheikh may he obliged, by identity of interests, to lend assistance, or the support of his tribes may be withdrawn from him.A telegram from Baghdad from Major Newmarch, dated the 2nd May, states that 400 infantry, 100 artillerymen with 2 field pieces, 4 mountain guns, and 6,000 rounds of ammunition had left, or were just leaving, for Samawa, and that these would be followed by a further contingent of 800 infantry.

May 5th ; ditto, IR&amp;Tnillj On the Subject of hostilities in The understanding arrived at with the Turkish Government in October 1901 provided that the two Governments should use their best endeavours to prevent hostilities between the Amir of Nejd and the Sheikh of Koweit. No stipulation was*made that either Government should exercise influence with the object of preventing hostilities between the Amir of Nejd and the Saood party. At the same time, His Majesty’s Government have, on more than one occasion, in the hope of assisting to preserve peace in that portion of Arabia, employed special efforts to dissuade the Sheikh of Koweit from taking part, even indirectly, in the hostilities which have broken out, and they have fearned with regret that the Turkish Government, on their side, appear to contemplate giving active assistance to the Amir in this intertribal quarrel. Your Excellency will observe that the Resident at Bushire will repeat to the Sheikh of Koweit the advice to observe an attitude of strict neutrality. Having regard to the above circumstances, and also to the further information contained in the Viceroy’s important telegram of the 9th instant, it is clearly desirable that Your Excellency should communicate this fact to the Forte, and should take the opportunity to repeat the advice which you were authorised to give in my despatch above mentioned, and to express the earnest hope of His Majesty’s Government that no action will betaken by the Turkish Govern ment which might add still further to the disturbed condition of this part of Arabia, the tranquillity of which is a matter of interest to His Majesty’s Gov ernment as well as to that of the Sultan.

On C same day a telegram was received here from the Finance Minister at Con st, ntinople ordering this money to be remitted. The amount was accordingly remitted on the 26th ultimo to Diwanieh or Samawa. This £ T. 1,500 was the balance due of the £ T. 4,000 assigned to the Basrah Vilayet as its contribution to the expenses of the expedition, the same sum £ T. 400 having so been assigned to each of the Vilayets of Baghdad and Mosul. A further :' T. 12,000 is in case of need to be taken from the 3 Vilayets for the expedition. My informant said the number of troops, whose departure from Diwanieh for Samawa, had been reported was 12 battalions with , 2S guns ; these figures, l owever, would seem to be too high, especially the number of guns. It is possible that these were 12 paper battalions. It is certain that during the last 6 weeks or 2 months troops from the Baghdad, Basrah and Mosul Vilayets have been concentrating at Diwanieh and Samawa, and that troops moved from Oiwanieh to Samawa towards the end of May, but I gather from various sources that there were not concentrated at Samawa more than about 12 battalions, or something over 4,000 men with perhaps 12 guns. It also appears that Ibn Bashid was at or in the immediate neighbourhood of Samawa in thedatter half of May. An eye-witness, who has since gone on to Koweit, reported that he saw * large Turkish force with Ibn Rashid’s Arabs on the 30th ultimo at a place two days’ journey from Samawa which is perhaps called Ain Salim. It is the ^.rst watering-place on the road from Samawa to Nejd. It seems uncertain whether Ibn Rashid himself came there with these troops from Samawa. The troops and tribesmen were waiting for stores from Samawa which, I hear, from another source consisted of three months’ provisions for the troops. The Shammar Arabs had deserted the expedition, but the Aneyzas, who are less important, were with it. The whole number of Arab tribesmen with the expedition would be perhaps about 7,000. Large numbers of camels for the ex pedition were seized by Ibn Rashid. The expedition has suffered from heat, and will suffer greatly even if the wells are not stopped as it has been rumoured they would be. I have heard ; 4 70 Turkish soldiers had already deserted before the end of May.(Received on the 27th June with Political Secretary s letter No. 24, dated 10th June 1904.) KOTV EIT.

The victory of the Wahabis is con firmed from other sources, and it is already reported, though perhaps prema turely, that Boreida has fallen.

We sent word to Your Highness before this by the hand of your servant Madi that it was our inten tion to set forth on an expedition. So we proceeded against Majid, and 23 be was in his^ tents in the region of llamlan of Aneyza, and, by the help of God and with your assistance, we halted our camels over above Osheziye at the break of day on Tuesday, the 4th day of Muharram. And we abode there, we and the people of Kassim who were with us, for the rest of that day. And the people of Aneyza who were with us sent men to their friends furtively to announce our coming And when it was the fourth hour of the night we bestirred ourselves and came to Aneyza. There, when the eighth hour was come, we halted our camels at Ijharniye, near to the town, and we left the people of Kassim to watch the villages, and, God helping them, they entered the town and slew Feheya-es-Sebhan and his company who were with him, and surrounded the family of Yabiya and their servants and a few men of the company of Feheya in the castle. And after we had said the morning prayer we sent against them Abdullah I bn Ij levi, with him 100 men of the people of Riad to assist. And we marched against Majia, and, when we saw the horsemen, God lifted his hand from off them and helped us against them. And ’ we broke them and slaughtered of them 370 men. Among them were Obeyd-al Ikmadar-Rashid. And God restored to us our kinsmen of the family of Saud, who were prisoners in their hands—Saud Bin Abdul ]Aziz and Saud Bin Mohamed and Feysul Bin Saud. And, by Almighty God, but two Bedouins on our side were slain. Then we returned to the villages of our friends. And they had taken the castle and laid hands on the family of Yahia and those with them and slain them, and emptied the houses of the family of Bessam. And, by God, there went away with Majid but some fifteen camels and seven mares; and the rest of their army and their horses and their arms and their tents and their furniture we took as a spoil, by the help of God and with your assistance. And at this time all the people of Boreida have come over to us and the chief men of the people of the villages Kassim, all of them. And when they heard the news of our being in the neighbourhood, they who were in Ras and Mezmil fled, and we settled those places. And as for Majid, the last news concerning him is that we set Boreida on his right hand and fled without his equipment. And our intention, by the grace of God, is that we should speed to Borei da, if God wills. Now, when we saw the victory and triumph which had come to us of God, Saltan Abal Kheyl begged leave to bear the good news to you, and the rest of tbe message you will learn from him by word of mouth.

I have the honour to state that news came here on the 13th instant that Bin Saud, having gathered a strong following of more than 5,000 men, attacked the towns of Kassim, Boreida and two others, and took them one after the other. In the meantime, having received assurances of-co-operation from more than half the people of Aneyza, the chief town of Nejd, who arc friendly inclined towards him, Bin Saud marched on Aneyza, and on the ni^ht of the 5th Muharram 1321 (22nd March 1904) entered the town without meet ing any serious opposition. The Sheikh, or Governor, of the town appointed by Bin Rashid was shot by the order of Bin Saud, and the houses of four leading men of Aneyza, who are supporters of Bin Rashid, were plundered. It is said that one of the Bessams, who are notables of that town, was killed, and the others have con cealed themselves. Having established himself at Aneyza, Bin Saud wrote a letter to the Grand Shereef announcing his victories, and assuming the titleof Amir of Nejd, and sent it through a special messenger. This messenger was intercepted at Medina, ami was sent to Mecca under arrest. It is not 'known what treatment he received at Mecca, but it is rumoured that the Turkish Gov ernment is taking steps to send troops to Nejd to support Bin Rashid and re establish bis authority, but I have been informed by a reliable person that Ahmed Ratib Pasha, the Vali of Hejaz, does not like Bin Rashid, and there fore he would be disinclined to act vigorously on his behalf.

My Lord, I have the honour to report that, in obedience to Your Lordship’s instructions, I called the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ attention yesterday to the understanding arrived at between the two Governments in October 1901 in regard to Koweit, and reminded His Excellency that His Majesty’s Government had upon several occasions cautioned the Sheikh Mubarak to abstain from interfering in the conflicts and disturbances which, unfortunately, existed in relatively close proximity to his territory. I said that His Majesty’s Government expected that, having adopted this attitude towards the Sheikh of Koweit, they had a right to expect that the Ottoman Government will do what they can to restrain the Amir of Nejd, 4and to refrain from any action which might endanger peace in those regions, whose tranquillity is a matter of interest to His Majesty’s Government as well as to that of the Sultan. I purposely abstained from using more precise language, as I do not understand that it is Your Lordship’s wish to go so far as to attempt to dissuade . or prohibit the Ottoman Government from sending assistance to the Amir of Nejd in his difficulties with the Wahabi Pretender Ibn Saud, whose apparent object it is to conquer Hail and re-establish a Wahabi dynasty throughout the centre of Arabia—a result which might be fraught with serious consequences in the near future, and render our influence and authority at Koweit, which is yearly growing stronger under the actual condition of affairs, dangerously precarious.

Sir, A 1&lt;X Basrah ; April 27y 1904. With reference to my telegrams Nos. 18, 19 and 20, in regard to Nejd affairs, there seems no further doubt that the Ottoman Government intend to give the Amir Ibn Rashid material support in his struggle with Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, in order to check any expansion of the Wahabi faction, and gain a stronger hold on Central Arabia. Troops are being sent from Baghdad, Basrah, Amara, Nasrieh and Nedjef to Samawa on the Euphrates, whence, it is reported, they will proceed to Aneyza with the Amir, and expel Ibn Saud from the places he has lately occupied. The Sheikh of Koweit has for a long time past supported Saud, either hoping thereby to extend his own power and benefit by the Wahabi successes, or, at least, to maintain his authority over the neighbouring Arab tribes, who now give him their allegiance, and protect his caravans in their commerce with the interior. Mubarak’s political aims make the Turks the more ready to check the movement. I am informed that they are helping the Amir with arms secretly imported through the Basrah district. A private letter recently sent from Baghdad to a Basrah friend to the Sheikh of Koweit warns him that the Turks are preparing to assist the Amir with all possible speed, and that the forces will leave Samawa between the 1st and 6th May. The Sheikh is advised to destroy all wells on the road from Samawa to Kassim, and to hasten the despatch of men and provisions to the Wahabi camp. It is stated that the Mushir will send six battalions fully equipped, besides arms and ammunition, and a large sum of money. Turkish interfer ence may presumably influence the Arab tribes round Koweit who adhere to Mubarak, and may induce them to join the Amir, unless the Sheikh exerts himself to protect them. In any case the hostilities are likely to hamper Koweit trade with the interior. Koweit is an enclave in Turkish territory with no defined boundaries, and the Turks would readily avail themselves of any opportunity to circumscribe its limits in the hinterland by averting the sympathies of the tribes in that neighbourhood who owe allegiance to Mubarak. If the Sheikh of Koweit does not help these tribes in the struggle now pending between the Amir, who has gained Turkish support, and the Feysue faction at Riad, it is probable 5. that they will forsake him and join the stronger side, and Koweit trade and influence, winch largely depends on their fidelity, must necessarily suffer. Bearing this in mind, the Sheikh of Koweit may be involuntarily drawn !. Dt ° the stru SD^ e » as hi 8 interests are identical with those of the Saud family. I have, etc., (Sd.) F. E.

Under date, the 28th October 1904, the Vice-Consul at Kerbala reports as follows:— ««Some time ago Arabs of the Aniza tribe who are hostile to the Amir of Jabal (Ibn Rashid) came to buy provisions, and have since then encamped themselves between Kerbala and Nejd. They tampered with the telegraph wire to Nejd and are giving trouble to pilgrims—pelting stones at the carriages going to Nejd. A few days ago they caught some pilgrims and stripped them even off their clothes. The authorities have not yet been able to cope with them.** Extract from the diary of the Political Resident in Turkish Aralia for the week ending the 13th November'1904. The Vice-Consul at Kerbala reports that the Redifs (Reserves) are being called out at Kerbala, Nejd, and Hillab, because the regular troops are going to help Abdul Aziz, the Amir of Jabal, against Ibn Saoud. The Redifs of Nejd will he stationed in Kerbala, those of Kerbala in Hillah, and those of Hillah in Nejd. He says this has caused great uneasiness among the people. It is stated at Baghdad that 25 battalions in all are going to join Abdul Aziz.r U I 48 Anot her rumour current here, perhaps also originated by my Russian Colleague, is that there are several English officers disguised as Arabs fighting for Ibn Saoud.

My Lord, With reference to my despatch No. 720 of the 12th instant, reporting the despatch from Medina of Turkish soldiers to reinforce the troops with Ibn Rashid, I have the honour to report that the Minister of War has informed Colonel Maunsell that the previous force of four battalions, sent to assist the • ibu Raahid Amir * of Nejd, having suffered defeat and the loss of the Colonel at Kassim, where it was now holding a defensive position, a relief force had to be despatched, consisting of three battalions, under Aarif Pasha, an energetic staff officer, who joined the Yemen corps two years ago. The Minister of War said he thought these troops must have now effected a junction with the other force at Kassim, and that the total strength of seven battalions would be quite sufficient to drive off Ibn Saoud’s men. His Excellency enlarged to Colonel Maunsell on the great difficulties of the want of water and supplies along the route from Medina, and said that a column of 3,000 men was all that could be properly provided for, but that others might follow if required. He also mentioned that the Wahibis under Ibn Saoud were in possession of some old iron cannon dating from the time of Ibrahim Pasha’s invasion of the Nejd from Egypt. I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch which I have just received from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Baghdad, containing details of the alleged treacherous killing of the Turks in question by Ibn Rashid himself during the conflict with Ibn Saoud, but I have not yet been able to obtain any confirmation of this version of the affair at Kassim.

CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. No. 1. Me. Townley to the Maequess of Lansdowne, (Received 14th November). Constantinople, (No. 862, Secret.) 8th iN ’ 0fember 1904. My Lord, I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship herewith copies of papers which I have received from a secret source, containing information about the’ present state of affairs in Nejd. As Your Lordship is aware, there has been much fighting recently in that region between Ibn Saoud and Ihn Rashid, who both claim the title of Emir The latter has recently been assisted by Turkish troops, and for some time past there have been conflicting rumours as to which side was victorious. ^ Latterly a conviction has been gaining ground that Ibn Saoud has won the day, a surmise which is borne out by the accompanying documents, of the genuineness of which I have been able to assure myself by the corroborative evidence I have collected in various directions. Having heard rumours of a proposed movement of troops to the Yemen or Aejd, I asked the Grand Vizier and the Minister for Foreign Affairs whom I saw together on the 3rd instant, whether they could give me any informa tion as to the real destination of the troops, which I understood were bein- sent from Aleppo and other places to Arabia. I was not at that moment in possession of the inclosed papers, but I gathered from their somewhat lame answers that the projected expedition had some object which they were unwilling to communicate to me. * A jj. Th ® accompanying copy of a despatch from Colonel Maunsell, Military Attache to His Majesty s Embassy, reporting information acquired at the War Department, shows that the troops were destined for Central Arabia, to avenge a defeat suffered by Ibn Rashid and the Turkish troops at the hands of Ibn Saoud. The Minister of War further told Colonel Maunsell that preparations for the dispatch of the expedition were now suspended in consequence of a etter having been received from Ibn Saoud, presumably the accompanying letter fiom his father to the Acting Vali of Bussorah, asking for pardon and tendering his submission.60 It is possible also that the Turkish Government may have been influenced in coming to this decision by a report addressed to them, as I am informed by His Majesty*s Consul at Jeddah, by Ahmed Ratib Pasha. Vali of the Hedjaz, in favour of Ibn Saoud, who is represented by His Excellency as being of the dynasty of the old rulers of Nejd, and that to take him into favour would do away for ever with disturbances in that country, since the large majority of the people side with him. ‘Whatever may be the reason of the change in the plans of the Turkish Government, I think that they are well advised to hesitate before sending a strong military expedition composed of troops quite unfitted for the purpose to the heart of Arabia against a foe who would have all the natural advantages of the country on his side. The arms and ammunition to which allusion is made in Colonel Maunsell’s despatch are to be forwarded by the Austrian Lloyd steamer “ Calypso,*’ which has been chartered for the purpose by the Turkish Government. I have, etc., WALTER TOWNLEY. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Fakhir Pasha, Acting Yali of Bussorah, to the Grand Vizier. 8th (21st) October 1904. I regret to report that the rumours of Ibn Rashid’s retirement to Hail are confirmed by the inclosed letter from Abdurrahman-ibn-Ee'isal, father of Abdul Aziz-el-Saoud, addressed to me via Koweit, and apparently written at Koweit for Abdurrahman. Inclosure. I heard of your arrival at Bussorah as Acting Yali and of your loyalty, so I report the following :— My family has of old been known to be loyal to the State, and especially to the Commander of the Faithful. But certain intriguing officials, egged on bv the tyrant Ibn Rashid, have calumniated us. As soon as I heard this, I* telegraphed to the Palace and wrote to the Vali of Bussorah and the Commander of the Army Crops, and begged that a full account might be sent to the Sultan. Ibn Rashid and his following deceived the Government, and, contrary to all expectation, brought about the dispatch of troops. We refused at first to believe this. Subsequently, Ibn Rashid and the troops arrived near the village of Bekirie.* Seeing this, all the inhabitants of Nejd and Kasim united and prepared for war, so as to prevent Ibn Rashid’s tyrannical murder ous designs. Ibn Rashid attacked them. My son, Abdul Aziz, being there with his followers, prepared, retired from in front of the troops and urged the tribes to attack Ibn Rashid’s band. Hereupon Ibn Rashid, seeing himself hard-pressed, fled to the troops, and in the ensuing encounter was defeated and routed. The soldiers lost 210 killed, and six guns fell into the hands of the people of Nejd. My son, Abdul Aziz, ordered the people to leave them at the village of Bekirie(?) Thus this service proceeded from our affection and loyalty to the State. Abdul Aziz-el-Saoud constantly designed to communicate with the Commanders of the troops and ascertain their desires, and to telegraph to the Palace, but Ibn Rashid sent out men to apprehend him, and seized all the letters and telegrams. After the encounter, which was on the 29th Rebiel Akhir, 1322, f we remained expectant. But Ibn Rashid would not rest, marched his following and the troops against the people of Kasim, and began to press them hard. On the 17th Rejeb, 1322, J he was attacked, defeated, and routed, many of his following being killed, all his tents, stores, and other possessions taken, * El-Bukirieh, between Hail and Boreideh, about half way.— (F. R. Maunsell.) f 13th July 1904. 1 27th September 1904.51 and it is unlikely that he will again make head. On this occasion also my son, Abdul Aziz, and our relatives prevented the Moslem population of Nejd from molesting the troops, but as they followed the same road as that which Ibn Rashid bad taken, they did not rest in Kasim. I am convinced that their departure is due to the machinations of Ibn Rashid. For neither the Sovereign nor his Ministers would ever allow their subjects to be harassed. I beg that our tender of loyalty may be accepted as heretofore, and that my condition may be reported to His Majesty. I am ready to perform any service to the State, and guarantee on oath the security of the roads aud pilgrims. I beg that my submission may be accepted, and that we may not be left in despair. Despair makes men commit any crime. I repeat my prayer, and beg that my pension, some months in arrear, may be paid. The big guns with the soldiers are now with the people of Nejd. They remain in my son’s possession. I await your orders. Inclosure 2 in No. 1. The Grand Vizier to the Minister of the Interior. 17th (30th) October 1904. The measures respecting the dispatch of troops to Kasim against Ibn Saoud have been concerted in communication with Eeizi Pasha. The following decisions have been sanctioned by His Majesty : — The dispatch of eight battalions from the 6th Ordou, one cavalry regiment four bottalions from Medina, besides from Syria and Adana, eight battalions of the best trained Redifs, not to fall below 600 each; dispatch by the Abdul Kader of four battalions of Redifs from the said Ordou, and from it also the requisite guns, as well as four Maxim mitrailleuses from the Selimie barracks at Constantinople, together with munitions; levy and embarkation of the troops from Adana as soon as such steamer arrives there, sufficiency of muni tions of war to be sent by a steamer to be chartered from the Lloyd Company, which will call at Adana, where eighty mules capable of conveying stores are to be prepared and embarked at Mersina; the troops and munitions to disembark at Beyrout, proceed to Syria, thence by Hedjaz Railway to Maan, thence to Acre (? Akaba), and so by special steamer to Yambo, whence they will march via Mecca and Medina to Kasim. The aforesaid has been communicated by the Minister of War, and the necessary orders have been given in haste, and you are hereby instructed to take such measures in accordance as fall within the scope of your Ministry. Inclosure Si in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Maunsell to Mr. Townley. Constantinople, 8th November 1904. (No. 68.) Sir, I have the honour to report that recently plans have been drawn up for sending reinforcements into Central Arabia to restore the prestige of the Turkish troops after the defeat by Ibn Saoud of Ibn Rashid’s forces whom they were assisting. Four battalions, two of Nizam and two of Redif, were ordered to be ready to be start from Aleppo, embark at Alexandretta, thence to Damascus by Beyrout by the new Hedjaz Railway to Maan by march route to Akaba, there embark for Yamboo, whence they could march to Medina and join the expeditionary force there for Kasim. Other troops were to be sent from Baghdad and Bussorah towards the Nejd, but no orders were actually sent to the 6th Corps head-quarters.I saw the Minister of War to-day, who told me that preparations for sending troops were now suspended, and that probably no expedition would be sent, as Ibn Saoui bad sent a letter to the Sultan asking pardon and tender ing submission, so that the matter would be arranged amicably. No troops at all would be sent from the Baghdad side, but very likely four or, perhaps, six Aleppo battalions would be sent to Medina, but nothing bad been actually decided. The Minister told me that actually at the present time Ibn Basbid was shut up by Ibn Saoud’s forces in the old fortress of Hail, bis capital. The Chief of the staff and other officials confirmed the above information. The troops of the 6th or Baghdad Corps are still armed with the old Martini rifle, now much worn, and practically the same weapon as possessed by Ibn Saoud’s men. It has now been decided to issue them the Mauser rifle like the rest of the army, and for this purpose 40,000 small-bore Mausers and also six batteries of the newer pattern of 7*5 centim, mountain guns, made in the arsenal here, have been packed up, and are awaiting shipment by an early steamer for Bussorah.

Xcation from the Government of India, regarding the reported ambition of Bin Saood to visit the Pirate Coast and Oman. I his was one of the matters which I had hoped to discuss with you per sonally at Busreh last week, but as you know I was prevent ed from proceeding there at the last minute. 2. 'Jhe position is briefly this:- Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman has shown by letters which he has addressed to some of the Crucial chiefs that he has some idea of attempting XM# re-establish the old Wahabi influence which his fore-fathers formerly acquired in Oman and of paying a preliminary visit to the Pirate Coastin connection with that aspiration. His interference in the affairs of the Trucial Chiefs or with subjects of the Sultan of Muscat would obviously be a most undesirable contingency; and vhe Government of India consider that our best means of preventing it is through the medium of Sheikh Mobarek. Hence their desire that you should sound him on the subject. In order that it may not appear that we attach very great importance to the reports at present existing, it would be better that you should in the first instance discuss the matter with Sheikh Mobarek, not as if you were acting facting on instructions from Government, but as if on a I casual reference from me. You might tell him, as is the case, that during a tour on the Irucial Coast from which I have just returned, I heard from some of the Sheikhs that Abdul Aziz bin Saood had been writing to them about a visit which he said that he contemplated paying to their country; and then ask him if he supposes that bin Saood seriously contemplates such a thing. You could go on to say that you cannot suppose that Government would approve of any interference by bin Saood in the affairs of Chiefs in treaty relation with us, and that you would advise Sheikh Mobarek as . our friend and that of bin Saood to discourage him from the project should bin Saood consult him in the matter. Please t report as early as possible the results of your interview. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant Major, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf96 (Copy) CONETTM'Tn IAL .

A report should in that case be sent of the results of the interview. 4. Since the present rumour appears to be somewhat in definite, care should be taken at the present stage not to give too official a character to any communication that may be made to Sheikh Mobarek.

Sir, With reference to my despatch No: 202 of the 1st instant, I learn from a secret and confidential source that the Vali of Busreh has informed the Vali of Baghdad, who has in turn reported to the Ottoman Government, that the armed conflict in Kassim Between Ion Rashid and Ion Saood, which resulted in the death of the former and the defeat of his followers, was the result of the attempts of Sheikh Mob are k-us-Sub ah, of Koweit, to bring about a reconcilation between these two Arab Chiefs. The Vali of Busreh accused Mobarek of plotting and treachery, and asked that the necessary military steps might be taken at once to restore order and arrest Ibn Saood. In a telegram sent by the Grand Vazier to the Vali of Baghdad in reply to this message, the opinion is expressed that the position of affairs in Kassim and the neighbouring districts, brought about by the death of Ibn Rashid, is the direct outcome of the recent encroachments of the military authorities in the province on the functions of the civil authorities. The Vali is to warn the Commander of the VI Army Corps that all interference in civil matters must now cease, and that no time must be lost in talking steps to restore tranquility in the disturbed districts.

He had been ordered to Baghdad and left the sane evening. It is uncertain whe ther he vrill return to take up his appointment as Com mandant at Busreh* Sudqi Pasha stated that he had handed over the Command in 31 Kasim *oo Sami Pasha, Acting J!uto- ssarif and Commandant and stayed ten dt^s \vith liim after his arrival. Sard Paslia brought 500 soldiers and one gun with him from Medina. The troops arrived in excellent condition. According to Sudqi Pasha*s account there are 2500 troops in Nejd and 31 Kasim. The lines of communication are o^en and caravans arrive finely and, though sit-plics are not easily obtainable locally, all necessaries were forwarded to thorn by caravans. Information from other sources does not confirm this favourable account. The tale told by the numerous desert ers who have from time to time found their way to Koweit and thence to Busreh during Sudqi Pasha's command in Kasim is a very different one. They describe the state of the troops there as pitiable in 'the extreme and state that provisions are scarce and they are without pay. Sudqi Pasha himself is said to bo owed 2000 Turkish &amp; for his services. SclccL Sudqi Pasha^that Ton Saood tos jealous of Saleh bin Mohanna’s intercourse with the Turkish Officers and that he got the people of : oreyda to sign a mazbata complain ing of Ms oppression and then removed him to Biadh. He attributes Ms removal to personal animosity. Thouf“h Hohanna‘ --'•'IS Hohanna was appointed Caimakaia of PxDreyda by uhe Mushir, ; ^ie appointment had not been oonfimed by Constantinople. Sudqi Pasha marched from Boreyda 'U&gt; Zilfi and thence travelled by \' 7 ay of Bs Sa.fa and Subakeya to Koweit cross ing the northern end of the Dahna between }\!oweit and Kasim. Prom Zilfi onwards he found water once every four days. The journey was performed on camels. He brought 142 men with him and had no casualties. He seems ‘co have travelled very quickly. He told mo Ghat peace had been established between Ibn Saood and Ibn Bashid but did not think it would last very long. He described Ibn Saood as a desert diplomatist and the late Abdul Asiz Tun Bashid as a desert warrior and said the former displayed considerable ability and adriotness in his dealings while the latter was a fighting man pure and simple. Meta’ab his son is only 21 and Sudqi Pasha thinks his youth will prevent him from taking any active line for the present, but his ambition to make a name for himself and follow in his father's footsteps may lead to a recurrence of hostilities between the rival factions at no distant date. He state a the Arabs had now all retired to their homes and their pastures. The murder of Abdul Aziz bin Jilwa while on his way to Koweit with letters from Saood was I am informed perpetrated by a raiding party of Shamm&amp;r Arabs who had not heard the news of peace being proclaimed. I learn that the allowance granted by the Turkish Government to Ibn Saood is oy recent arrangement paid through the Sheikh of Koweit, who deducts it from the land tax due to the Government on his Pao property. Meta'ab's allowance is supposed to bo paid through Baghdad, but I have not heard of his receiving anything as yet. I can obtain no confirmation of the report from Jeddah mentioned in Your Excellency’s despatch of 7th July that Ibn Saood had ordered the Arab Sheikhs and tribes in Nejd to abstain from communication with Turkish officers\ British Eeitfidenoy and Oonsiilate-Qeneral , Bushir©, Be.jtiiher 1906. 1 To t Zfflot 1P06.

We nave thus been approached from tiree directions % aid I think tie re can be no floubt ‘that these representa tions iii^y be held to have been inspired by Bin Saood per sonally. 3. Phn Rashid ' s death at tie nh&amp;&amp;m of his rival had an important influence on tie situation and as the 'dovemment of India have been informed the three-comered peace of which the possibility was indicated in paragraph 2 of ry letter No: 620 of 18th March has lately taken shape. Whether it will endure on its o-'Wi merits or whether the Turks will at once set themselves to undo it, it is impossible to prophesy, but seeing that the present Bin EaBhid is a mere youth of 18, it is hardly likely that he will be able to make any sorious stand against Bin Saood for some cime co come. Tne euncoure is consequently a con venient one for an examination and review of the political situation in Central Arabia and of our attitude towards Bin Saood and I venture 'to hope that Government will uake advantage of it for that pur-pose. 4.

Ramsay, C.I.E. , Offg: Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and Acting British Consul- General, Baghdad, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Majesty’s Consul-General for Pars, Khuzistan etc., Bushire. \ With reference to your letter Wo: 2139 dated the 15th September 1906, I have the honour to enclose herewith a note t&gt;y Mr, Gaskin on Wejd Affairs* I am sending copies of this note to H. B.M’s Ambassador at Constantinople, to the government of ndia and to H.B.M’s Consul at Busreh.Memorandum of information obtained by Mr. Gaskin. X With reference to the Turkish occupation, he informed me that there were only about 50 Turkish soldiers under a Kulaghasy at Boreida and a similar detachment at , Anesa, and the main body, consisting of over a thousand Infantry, a few Cavalry with 4 heavy field guns and 5 or 6 lighter pieces, stationed at bheihiya a village about 5 or 6 hours ride W. N. W. of Boreida, under the command of Sami Pasha. The Turks are there on sufferance, and do not interfere in any way with the local affairs, and con fine themselves to their quarters, only leaving them when going to purchase food or going to the Mosque for prayers. The troops are stationed by their own Government, The Amir does not provide them with anything. They are wretchedly off. Many of the officera and men are con tinually deserting. If no fresh troops are sent to relieve the present garrison before long no soldiers will be left in Kassim through the wastage by dis ease and desertions. As regards the young Amir, he stated that the people of Jabal Shammar are very hopeful of him, and he has gained their affection through his straight forwardness, generosity and the habit of carrying out no undertaking without consulting all the elders of the A1-Rashid clan and listening to the best advice. He has remitted the tribal taxes for the current year and reinstituted the payment of annual allowances to the various tribal chiefs, retainers and charities on the same scale as that paid by his grandfather. These allowances had been reduced by his father. After reducing to obedience the Hetein and Hhararat tribes occupying the tract of country lying betweenbetween Teima and Jowf, th.e Amir on about the last week of August 1906 attacked the Mateir Arabs, ad herents of Bin Saood in Kassim and carried awaynrauch plunder in the shape of camels, horses, cattle and Sheep. Regarding the general feeling of the Araos tovrardS the Turks, my informant declared that there is a growing discontent and dislike towards them, oec^lIase of their unjust demands and harsh treatment, the life of the Arabs is becoming harder every year, and poverty is overshadowing them. Many of the Arao chiefs whose incomes amount to 400 or 500 Liras which would be sufficient under ordinary conditions foi their needs, are reduced to beggary on account of the ex— N ote. This has i actions of the Turkish officials. The Arabs are long- not been ^ara 0 ff the Turks and become independent or to come under the protection of the Great Powers as in the case of Bulgaria and Roumelia. With this view recently a Hiteim Chief whose brother is imprisoned by the Turks and not yet released, though the amount of bribes demanded by the officials have been ^aid, has proposed to the Sheikh of the Mui&amp;fik Arabs the fonr-ation of a strong confederacy of all the tribes for the purpose of turning Enfe; the Turks out of Arabia and applying subsequently to the Great Powers for protection. The Muntafik Sheikh did not fall in with the views of the Hiteim Sheikh as the Arabs con sider the Hiteim are of inferior blood and a proposal coming from such a source would not be taken up by other Arabs. My informant also informed me that cereal^ are very expensive in Jabal Shammar and Kassim, and ^ri ces ranged five or six times as high as those on the Euphrates owing to the limited produce available in the regions mentioned. He explained that the fields are irrigated by water drawn from wells by camels, and these animals cannot stand the work, and in two monthsmonths they become useless and are sold for a fifth of their original price and though there is plenty of water and arable land, for this reason they find it just as cheap to import their grain from the districts on the Euphrates. He has heard of the recent import ations of pumps into Baghdad for purposes of irriga tion and he is very much interested in the matter as ^ he thinks that these appliances would meet with much favour in the regions indicated as the whole of the . cultivable land may be brought under cultivation oy their employment. He understands that the price of Russian Kerosine Oil necessary for working the oil engine which drives the pump is about S0% dearer in Jabal Shammar than at Koweit from where it will have to be procured, and that proper mechanics will have tocbe engaged to work the engines etc. from Baghdad at a higher rate of pay than they receive locally. He wishes to procure definite information as regards ^ a pumping plant, capable of raising a similar quant,iby Water bags of water as 10 or 11 Bakras from a depth of 8 to 9 drawn by bullocks metres. When the details are forthcoming he proposes known in India as 'charge'. to transmit them to the Amir of Jabal Shammar and suggest to him the purchase of such a pumping plant for erection at Hayil as a trial. If the venture meets with success he declares that over 200 plants will be required in the localities mentioned alone. He asks me whether I would assist him in obtaining the details of a suitable plant - a plant that can be carried in pieces weighing from 2 to 2-J- cwts each for transport by camel. In respect of the appearance of several sections of the Anesa tribe on the Euphrates between Musayib and Nejef he stated that it was nothing unusual. He explained that it was customary for these Arabs to camp in that neighbourhood during this season of the year so long as the grazing round-about supported their camels, cattle and flocks. Aoout 1^ years ago the■ the Aneza fell out with the Amir of Jabal Shammar and. to avoid, being raided by the Amir they kept aloof from the lower reaches of the Euphrates, out now that they have come to an understanding with the Amir, they need no longer take that precaution. There are several thousands of tents scattered in groups of 200 to 500 throughout the region mentioned. (sd). J. 0. Gaskin. 24th September 1906. Note by Major Ramsay. Mr. Gaskin's informant is in a position to have the latest and most accurate information of v'hat is going on in the Ibn Rashid camp and counsels. The interview took place in the house of an Indian resident of Baghdad. I did not take part in it as my movements are carefully watched. Mut’ib Ibn Rashid is said to have received an order on the Karbala district for £ T 250 a month. This is not regularly paid and the local officials ‘t,pyj_xig to get a oribe to induce them to pciy» this Mut’ib has refused to pay. From another source I hear that the Sultan’s Aide-de-Camp, who went to take a decoration to Mut’ib had got as far as Kayil. (sd). J.

Sir, I have the honour to inform ^ ou that I visited Sheikh Mobarak this morning and found him very communi’cative &amp; interesting on the subject of his interviews with the Turkish authorities at his recent visit to kao . 2. He said that he had had some trouble with them ab out the assessment of his kao revenues &amp; that he had had to inform them the^ must reckon their revenues on the datetrees bearing fruit 1- not on the area of the gardens which had been ruined b^ the action of their own Tali , wno interfered with the protecting embank ment &amp; let the sea in on to the date-gardens . 3. He said that the Commision went &amp; inspected the date-gardens but that he refused to go himself , as he was afraid that evil-minded people would say that he had bribed them . 4. The Sheikh then went on to say that , during his visit , he had been approached by one Bartu pasha , Irkan Harab , who consulted with him as to the possi bility of establishing friendly relations between the Turkish Government % the Bedouin tribes , on a System of payment of their Sheikhs . He said that they were-^ all in Sheikh Mobarak’ s hands k that he was sure that the Sheikh could assist him in effecting his object. 5. The Sheikh say s that the Turkish officer had a took w ifei him in which the names of all the tribes were %% written down 8c he asked the Sheikh about each one 8c the Sheikh replied putting objections in his way . ; IThe Jmtair were with Bin Sa'ucl, so were the Sbi'a % Sahul . The Ajman, Bani Khalid be were the tribes of hi Ahsa , their own province , The Thaffir were r round Basra Zubair , the officer should consult _ ul _ Khalid^’Aon * The ’Ataiba v/ere under the Sharif of Mecca , The Harb? IBless ^ our soul ! to get at the harb , ^ ou should appl u round Medina . As regards the Sheikh’s own Bedouins , true that he kept a tew unim portant sections to look after his horses 5? camels . The u were called the 'Araibdar ,i.e. the Arabs of the dar. He lived in a dar , a house . Their Sheikhs with their riding camels were all at the gentleman’s service, if he wished to enter into relations with the Bedouin Sheikhs . The Turk seems to have got home here with the repM&gt; ' But I hear that u ou have the head Sheikh of the Ajman under lock and ke u 8c that ^ou collect zikat from all these people 'Hot exactly That . He was misguided enough to carry off aoout 500 camels and only offered to bring back 170 . So he had to staj 4 as a hostage , until the others were restored . But it is all done b., kindness and good faith • No com pulsion . Tith regard to Bin Sa’ud and Bin Pashid, th position is not quite the same # The,, are mighty chiefs^ far more important than I am . I strive to keep on excellent terms with them but I have no influence with them . You should approach them direct.' The Turkish officer listened to all this , gravel, shaking his head!., and then remarked that he was going up to the Muntafik at present * would then go round b, sea to hi Ahsa . 6. At this point , I mentioned to the Sheikh that I had noticed recentl, that quite a number of bedouin Sheikhs had been coming to me and that with a view to getting on good terms with them , I had , as he was probabl, well aware , been making them small presents of cash and clothes and I asked the Sheikh what he thought of these measures . That , if he thought that this was likel, to rouse the suspicion of the Turks &amp;so induce them to extend their influence over the Vri tribes 8c sap his authority , I wanted no more aid or prestige in the desert than what he could afford 8c H®' would discourage them . 7. The Sheikh replied that he was perfectly aware of what I was doing and that he himself was encouraging the Sheikhsjto go to me 8c that no possible ham could come of m^ gatting on friendly terns with them 8c ask ing them questions about their histor u , pedigree 8c £ customs . As regards the Turks , the., would never do anything with the tribes .Lven if the u succeeded in inducing the Sheikhs to come in 8c gave them allowances for a few months , the,, would at once begin to exact onerous services in return 8c nothing but trouble would follow # YTien the Turks had succeeded in coll ecting the ,, miri ,, due to them from the Muntifich ( I think he named T£ 160,000 ), whd&gt;Jwere actually in their territory , it would be time enough for them to take the true desert tribes in hand 8c settle them . 8. I told the Sheikh that for some da u s I had had it in nt, mind to consult him about visitinfe the Sab ha 8c Jiblan sections of the Jmtair , which are camped round SubaihX, a • I had now made the acquaint- ance of their Sheikhs 8c it would be interesting to go 8c see them in their tents. The Sheikh replied that I was perfectly welcome to do this • 9. He then turned to me abruptly 8c said ' I notice that the Government do not seem in a hurr^ to extend their protection to bin Sa'ud • It would be a ver^, good tiling if the, did I asked him ,,v hat good would it do? Do „ou want the Turks to send soldiem again to Nejd 5? do ,ou want British soldiers to march into Nejd to oppose them ?' He laughed at this and said 'No! No! phe terror of ,our name would suffice . The, are ver, much afraid of , ou . Th, did the, honour Bin Sard's messengers so much? Onl, because the, are afraid of ,ou . It would be so good for trade 8c general quiet.'It is impossible for me , living in a town , of which- the atmosphere reeks with intrigue , to refrain from speculating as to what the old Sheikh's object was in throwing this question at me &amp; I must ask pardon , if these speculations appear to those , happily free from such influences 9 to be childish &amp; farfetched# 10. All the later indicationstoint to the notion that Sheikh Mobarak thinks|that the family of Bin Rashid have been sufficiently humbled 8c that Bin Sa'ud is getting above himself. I think that the projects of the Turkish officer alarmed him seriously • The i-nfluence over the tribes is a privilege that all these tribes Sheikhs , whet^her Js-Subah , Bin Sa'ud or Bin Rashid watch most jealously . The terror of our name , in Sheikh Mobarak's mouth , is mere flattery and ^ the only use of flattery is to help a man make a fool of himself. Poes he want us to lend our name to Bin Sa'ud , so as to bring the Turkish troops down to embarrass him , and set Sultan bin Hamud ur Rashid on his feet so that the two combatants ma^ exhaust each other over again ? Or , does he think that the Bnglish , in their insane philanthropy &amp; vain-gloriousness , .ma^ set themselves up as arbiters of the destinies of Central Arabia , destroy theTurkish bug-bear for ever , 8c establish garrisons in Ll-OasTm , in which case he is confident in his own skill 8c ability to ride them , as he w °U-l.d. one of his own horses ? Or , lastly , the Sheikh knows that Government moves slowly , Is he afraid that ,when the situation has completely changed , an order may come affording Bin Sa'ud protection , which ma^ not suit Mobarak at all 8c is he merely fishing for information ? 11.

From— Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— MAJOR P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to report an interesting development of the Nejd situa tion, reported on in some fulness in this office diary No. 35 for the week ending 28th August 1907. 2. It would appear that Bin Sa’ud has written to Sheikh Mobarak in some form or other asking for his assistance at the present juncture, as he is seriously alarmed at the rapid advance in strength of Bin Rashid and the defection of Boraida and the Umtair tribe. This is merely local conjecture to account for the action Sheikh Mobarak is taking, but it is probably founded on fact. 3. Fortunately, I decided to visit Sheikh Mobarak this morning and he opened the conversation by remarking that Nejd affairs were causing him a good deal of anxiety and that he was sure that the present movement would lead to the disastrous result of an occupation of El Kasim by the Turkish troops, as Sultan bin Rasid and the people of Boraida were in no way far-seeing. The people of Boraida wanted nothing but peace and Sultan bin Rashid was anxious to obtain recognition by the Turkish authorities and to secure himself against Bin Sa’ud’s depredations. They would probably therefore call in the Turk, not perceiving that he, in the end, would be a harder master than Bin Sa’ud. 4. Accordingly Sheikh Mobarak has arranged to despatch Abdul Aziz ul Hassan, a native of a hamlet, Turaif, near Boraida, to bring the Umtair back again and to persuade all parties to keep quiet. 5. Abdul Aziz ul Hasson has been frequently alluded to in my reports. He is Sheikh Mobarak’s chief zikat collector and was the Amir ul Haj of the last Koweit pilgrim caravan. He is respected and of some influence, but I do not altogether share Sheikh Mobarak’s optimism which persuades the latter that he will be successful in the difficult negotiations which he has to pursue. 6. He is, as I have said before, to persuade all parties to keep the peace ; to order the Bedouins back again ; to guarantee, on the part of Sheikh Mobarak, Bin Sa’ud in the possession of his territory, and Boraida; say El Kasim against the aggression of both parties, and Sultan bin Rashid in the possession of Hail, and to state that Sheikh Mobarak will visit with his displeasure anybody who presumes to stir beyond the limit he has marked out for them. 7. It is a fine ambitious project worthy of the genius of the man who con* ceived it and, if there is any one, who can enforce it, he may fairly be regarded as the Nejd {i dtus exmachina” who would restore peace to that distressful country. 8. Boraida will be ready enough to come to terms, but Sultan has already declared that he counts not on their assistance but their neutrality. r vThere remains the Umtair for it is not likely that the remainder of Sultan’s following will pay much attention to Sheikh Mobarak’s wishes. Faisul ud Dawish has sent a written challenge to Bin Sa’ud and declares that, so long as 10 horsemen will follow him, he will fight Bin Sa’ud. Too much attention need not be paid to Bedouin boasting, but a man who has had a bullet through his shoulder, which is barely healed, is apt to feel a bit sore about it, and the attack on the Umtair at Majma’a was hardly justifiable. Practically, the success of Mobarak’s mission depends on this man’s attitude. 9. Everybody in Koweit knows all about this mission, which fact in itself is significant. I had not been away from Mobarak two hours before I was informed of the facts from two different sources. People are not wanting who say that Mobarak is afraid of Bin Rashid’s success and does not wish for a repetition of the situation of 1901. 10. I felt myself unable to make any reply to Sheikh Mobarak beyond that the situation as described by him would be reported to my Government and to remind him of their caution that they did not approve of his interference in Central Arabian politics.

C.I.E., Resident and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul- General in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to forward the following report from Nejd :— Abdul Aziz ul Hussan recently sent a messenger, a man of no special importance and not one of Sheikh Mobarak’s servants, with letters for the Sheikh. This man was travelling with a party of Towata Aniza Bedouins, about twenty-five strong. At Ath Thamami they were set upon by Ajman tribesmen who robbed them of arms, camels and everything they possessed and they came through to Koweit on foot and in a destitute condition. The Towata are the Aniza sub section who hang about in Koweit territory. Ath Thamami is a group of wells in the Batin, two days beyond Hafar and just inside the Dahna sandbelt. The leader of the Ajman raiders was one Muhammad ud Damir, one of the Sheikhs of the Tha’an section of the Ajman. It is by no means certain that the outrage at Ath Thamama had any poli tical significance or that it was specially directed to get possession of Sheikh Mobarak’s post-bag. It seems more likely that it was an ordinary incident of desert travel. The news brought verbally by the messenger is to the effect that no one on the side of Bin Rashid has paid the smallest attention to Abdul Aziz ul Hassan’s well meant efforts in the cause of peace. Indeed, Faisul ud Dawish, Sheikh of the Umtair, flatly refused to obey his instructions. Haza’a bin Ishgair and Badar bin Muhammad-ud-Dawish are at Aj Ja’ala wells in the tract of A1 Asyah about 8 hours from Boraida for a riding camel and a day and a half for a caravan. The report^ that they were inclining towards Bin Saud and that the Umtair were divided against themselves is now completely discredited. The result of Abdul Aziz ul Hussan’s overtures to Bin Sa’ud is unknown. One recent report places the latter at Shagra and says that he has no Bedouins with him, but his sympathisers state that he has advanced some distance towards El-Kasim and is in strength. It may be noted that this last batch of Ajman raiders have nothing to do with the party who, as reported in recent diaries of this Agency, recently looted a caravan destined for Koweit. The leaders of that party were Ikhmayas A1 Manaikhar Sheikh of the section of the As Safran, and Raikan of the Bani Hithlain family. The negotiations for the recovery of that looted property appear to be also delayed. It would seem that the hinterland is in a very disturbed state and that Sheikh Mobarak’s authority is not respected to the same extent as formerly, though, no doubt, this has no special significance and is merely a part of the general unrest consequent on the two leaders of Central Arabia preparing again for battle.

Ibn Rashid who seems to be superseding Ibn Sooud among the different tribes of the Nejd. It would appear that the party of Ibn Rashid is increasing at the expense of his rival, and that the policy he has adopted shows that he has wider ambition than that of being Emir of Hail. He is communicating with the Druses of the Jebel Hauran through his agent at Jauf, Sheibh Saleh-el-Muzeini, avowing to them eternal friendship and strong alliance, to say nothing of his promises and expressed devotion to the tribes of Anezah.^ Muteir, Oteioeh and the natives of Kassim.

The file also contains a limited amount of direct correspondence between Ibn Sa'ud and Knox (in Arabic with English translations) and correspondence from the Foreign Office in London and the Foreign Department of the Government of India.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003b3#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
