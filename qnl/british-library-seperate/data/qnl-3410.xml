A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence and telegrams between the Political Agent at Bahrain; K S Husain bin Hamad, in charge of the Agency at Sharjah; the Political Agent in the Trucial Coast; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; and Yusuf bin Ahmed Kanoo; regarding outbreaks of smallpox and other diseases on the Trucial Coast.The file mostly contains documents regarding a smallpox epidemic in the Trucial Coast: weekly statistics and telegrams showing deaths by smallpox in 1936, in English and Arabic.The file also contains requests for supply of vaccines, vaccinations, quarantine measures, requests for the intervention for Dr Ralph Holmes, Medical Officer at the Victoria Memorial Hospital, and reports from Dr Holmes' work in Sharjah.There is correspondence in Arabic with English translation, with the Residency Agent at Sharjah and with the ruler of Ras-al-Khaimah, Shaikh Sultan bin Salim Al Qasimi.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency, Medical Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Yusuf Bin Ahmed Kanoo</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ra's al-Khaymah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Statistics</topic></subject><subject><topic>Infectious diseases</topic></subject><subject><topic>Smallpox</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000295#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000295#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000295#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000295#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000295#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
