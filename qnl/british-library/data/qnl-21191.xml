RESIDENCY, /$ July 1936 Rlease refer to your demi-official letter No.C-290-4/7 of June 9th last to Colonel Lake. I have made extracts of Mr. Ingrams’s Report on the objects and organisation of the Aden Protectorate College lor the Sons of Cniefs, which should contain the information you require. Captain T. Hickinbotham, Acting Political Agent BAHRAIN. AM/Extracts from the Report by hr. W.H. Ingrams, First Political Officer, on objects and organisation of the. proposed Aden Protectorate College for the Sons of Cniefs. &gt; (a OBJECTS . It is intended to be a Training College for Chiefs and others of the ruling classes. The School is to be designed to accommodate 36 boarding pupils from the age of 8-15 inclusive who are the sons of near relations of Ruling Chiefs. I propose to enlarge on the training of rulers for the Protectorate with some detail in order to make more clear the relations between the objectives and the routine I propose for the school, but before doing so there are other factors to be considered in drawing up plans for the conduct of the institution which it will L perhaps be well to state. They appear to me to be our policy in the Protectorate, and the sociological and economical conditions of the Protectorate. I will deal with these in turn. (c) SOCIOLOG-ICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITION S. Apart from the few civilised areas of the ♦ Protectorate such as Lahej and kukalla, anyone who knows anything of conditions in a dependency inhabited by backward people has got to go a good deal further back to have any conception of the actualities of life in many of the more primitive tribes of the Protectorate. Perhaps one of the most striking features to a newcomer is the cheapness of human life. The relations of Government with these Chiefs are on the whole of uniform pattern, although there is a natural difference in the way relations are conducted with an intelligent and well-intentioned Chief and an ignorant petty Sheikh of little understanding. Government2 . deals direct only with those chieftains who are in treaty relations with it, and the politics of the Protectorate are coloured to a great extent by the treaties held with various tribes. The general attitude of Crovemment is to hold the treaty Chief responsible for the doings of his o?/n subjects, and to some extent for those of the tribes for which he is held to be suzerain. While therefore in framing a type of education for the future rulers of such a medley of different organisations we have to consider the different social conditions under which so many of them live, we have none ohe less to uring the training we give into conformity with our policy of holding the chief responsible for the doings of his tribes, and therefore to give him such a training as may afterward ^44 him in good stead. Apart from these so-called Quran Schools there are no where outside Lahej and tiukalla any educational establishments of any kind whatever. Sons of the majority of tribal chiefs rarely receive any literary education, though they learn early to shoot and carry rifles and to ride a horse or camel. II. EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVaS . It seems to me that there are three possible phases or stages the training should follow:- (1) the personal acquisition of sound habits in the performance of work and play. (2) an appreciation oi tne needs of others in their daily life. (5) the application ot the principles so learnt to others: in otner vvoras tne i unctions of a ruler and how to carry them out. actually the school must be arranged in a series of yearly courses, the lowest standard consisting of beginners with instruction graded to suit a normal childat 8-9 (in this case as they are to come to us at that age) and so on. But considerations of finance make it impossible to have seven separate forms and the limited number of pupils renders it unnecessary. I think from this last point of view two teachers would be numerically enough as the size oi c^ass would still be moderate, but as it is desirable to give as much personal attention as possible to each of these children and as the inevitable casualoies of leave and sickness have to be considered it is most desirable to have three. One master*s class will cover the first three years work of the course, the second two and the third two. In view of the probaoility tnat recruitment will at first at any rate take place at irregular intervals there may often be beginners who have got to be dealt with separately (vide Recruitment). (a) CHARACTER DEVRLQPMRNT . I consider the chief educational objective of the School to be character development. of the curriculum. It must of course be conducted in accordance with the best traditions and prescribed rules of Islam and the boys must realise the inter-action of religion in every phase of daily life. Moral and ethical instruction must be based on the sanctions of religion. Put shortly while character training should have a religious background it must not be based on abstractions but related to the actual conditions and experience of every day life. (b) FAMILY AND COMUNITY LIFE . The atmosphere of the school particularly in the domestic rooms should oe tnat oi a large Arab familv. The furniture and appointments generally will all be such vital partas are found in Arab homes and the school should adopt the best tradition of Arab homerlife. (c) READING AND WhlTINCL When the boys have mastered the elements of reading and writing Arabic they should be given books, the reading of which will serve the double purpose of practice in reading and stimulating their interests in the needs of their future life. Such subjects as health ( and here I do not neglect the importance of impressing religious precepts directed towards hygienic ends) the care of crops and livestock, natural history etc. will be of more use than the pointless tales often found in reading primers. Carefully chosen biographical sketches of men whose lives point a useful lesson should also be included. 7/riting lessons can develop into the writing of essays on observations made in nature study, and of the lives of animals, and will progress towards an attempt to judge of the appreciation a boy has formed of the objects of his school life and of the duties of rulers in the conduct of their states. (d) ARmmc. This subject too must be adapted to the needs of life. It will not be sufficient to confine instructions to the correct solution of impossible multiplication and division problems, but when the principles have been learnt they can be applied to actual problems connected, lor instance, with the life of the school and what is taught there. (e) HISTORY . t Instruction should therefore begin with the History of Aden, the actual surroundings in which the instruction is given. It should progress to the history of the country lorming the Protectorate from the earliest—times (tnis will include the growth of Islam and something of the history of the Holy Cities) and go on to the history of the various tribes and States and of the growth of the Protectorate itself. It should and with a short survey of Empire History. That dealing with the British Empire should also be short and should avoid needless detail of strife and dispute but should rather dwell on the undertaking and carrying of responsibility and the Ideals c(| Empire as we see them to-day. Its diversity might.be touched on and the place of Aden and its Protectorate in the scheme of empire described. (f) aEOGRAPHY . The Committee recommends ’’the Geography oi Arabict with an outline of the Geography of the world'. Here again instruction should begin with the surroundings in which it is given, where abstraction can be given a concrete meaning by reference to actual objects. I tnink then that the terms of geography should be learnt as far as possiole from Aden itself and then the Protectorate should oe described, ihis will lead to Arabia as a whole and then to our neighbourhood. (g) LANGUAGES . Arabic apart, the Committee recommended English Reading, wiiting and translation'. They also recommend that the soudy of it should begin from the second year. (h) HYGIENE AND MEDICAL INSTRUCTION . Instruction should progress from teaching the necessity of personal hygiene and the development of a sound body to measures for the prevention of disease. (i) RECREATION . Probably6 * Probably the first word that jumps to our minds when we think of recreation in Government Schools is Football. Football must certainly play an important part in the games of these boys. But apart from football, other English games, and the obvious physical training, I think we ought to organise and improve if necessary purely native games. I have seen a specie of rounders played in the Fadhli country and such tnings as the use of the sling popular amongst small boys trains hand and eye. Scouting also will be encouraged. Recreation will in any event form an important part of the curriculum and will serve to teach the right use of leisure. (j) NATURE STUDY . I am glad to see that the Committee have recognised the importance of including Nature Study in the curriculum. No school subject is easier to make interesting and perhaps no other is nearer recreation. (k) AGRICULTURE . Our ultimate aim in the Protectorate should be to wean the Arab from the following of warlike pursuits and to lead him to extract all that he can from his land and livestock. The encouragement of agricultural pursuits is so obviously the duty of Chiefs that I think we ought to recognise this in the school curriculum. Cm) CIVICS AND THE ART OF GCVERIL.RNT . I consider these boys should be given some instruction in civics and in the art and machinery of Government.III. STAFF AND LIANAGSLI3NT . (a) CONTROL . There is, I think, a definite value in having a member of the Political staff in control of the school as he will be able to maintain contact with the boys after they leave. (b) TEAGHI.G STAFF . To achieve even a moderate success in the attainments of our objectives it is obvious that the staffmust be of as high a quality as is consistent with the means at our disposal. Badly or indifferently trained staff would be worse than useless. (c) USHER . (The title of this office has not yet been fixed. He has been referred to as 'matron' and jocularly as 'patron'. His function is primarily to run the hostel and keep order and discipline. For this post, too, high character is essential. wtain B.V- D« J .i^o.C/36 9-4/7. ted, the 5th August 1936.

The money will be credited to a joint account at the Imperial Bank of India, Ajmer in the names of the Principal and the student The Principal reserves the right to limit expendituie if and when he considers it necessary.8 4. (Steruxal Arrangements The Mayo College is situated in an extensive park of 300 acres in a most healthy position outside the town and is fully equipped for all the needs of a self-contained residential institution. Two large buildings in the park are set apart for the exclusive use of the College Section. One of these, known as the Jhalawar House, contains the Lecture Rooms, Tutorial and Staff rooms, and the Library, while the other, known as the Colvin House, is used for residential purposes. The College Section is therefore for all practical purposes entirely separate and distinct from the School Section. Students in the College Section are given the same privileges and position as are enjoyed by under graduates at a University or College in India. Medical. The Civil Surgeon of Ajmer is in medical charge of the College. He exercises a close supervision over its health and hygiene, and there is a resident Sub-Assistant Surgeon to assist him. There is also a well equipped Dispensary and a Sanitarium with a set of Nurses’ quarters attached. *9 A medical history sheet is maintained for each student from the time lie joins the College. Weight, height and chest measurements are recorded regularly at the beginning and end of each term. Eyes and teeth are inspected at regular intervals. Supplies. There are two Modis’ Shops controlled by the College authorities in the College grounds to supply provisions of all kinds. There are in addition a College Book Depot, a Vegetable shop and Hay and Firewood depots. The supervision of these Supply Stores is carried out by a Supply Committee appointed by the Principal. A list of tradesmen who are licensed to deal with the College is maintained and only such tradesmen are permitted within the College compound.10 5. hoarding TKoust Arrangements Ordinarily only resident students are accepted. In special cases', however, students may be accepted as Private Boarders, living in private houses, preferably within the College park, with guardians approved by the Principal. No day scholars are accepted for admission. All resident students are housed in a special hostel, the Colvin House, over which the Principal, as the Warden of all College students, exercises particular supervision. The Assistant Warden, who is resident, is a senior member of the College teaching staff. A set of rooms, consisting of a living room, a dressing room and a bath room, is given free of rent to each student. Additional rooms may be given, if there are any to spare, at a monthly rent of Rs. 1/8 or Rs. 10 /-, according to the size of the room. o There exists in the Colvin House a Common Room, where students may meet, read newspapers, write letters or play indoor games. There is also a library to which students may retire for quiet study* There also exists in the Colvin House a Common Mess and it is very desirable that all students in the House, should become Members of the Mess.

Dear Colonel Loch, Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohomed bin Isa has asked me whether it would be possible for him to be sent to a Military College in India or elsewhere, at Government expense. He is about 23 years old and has a fair knowledge of English and is better edu cated than most of his relations having spent about two years at the Beyrout University. If he acquired some military training he would be of use in the Bahrain State Police. I do not know much about Military Colleges in India but I believe there is a Military College in Baghdad where officers of the Iraq Army are trained. Could you possibly give me any information on the subject? I think Shaikh Khalifah is the only one of the family who would repay the expense of military training abroad. I suggested such a possibility to one or two of the younger members of the family but they refused to consider the idea.

Office of the Inspector General of Police, Post Box No.P, Poona, 10th April 1937. 31st March last to the Principal, Police Training School, Nasik, I have the honour to send herewith extracts from our regulations regarding the training of Assistant and Deputy Superintendents of Police, which, mutatis mutandis, would be applicable in the case of Shaikh Kalifah. This is the course I would suggest for the training of Shaikh Kalifah. It is the course which our own Imperial and Provincial officers have to pass in our School. After he has passed this course (which may take eighteen months to two years according to his ability to pass examinations), the question of putting him through some practical training in a district for six months might be considered. 2. I need hardly say that at the School discipline is strict and we cannot relax it in favour of special officers as that would be detrimental to the general discipline of the School. By this I mean frankly that Shaikh Khalifah would have to come prepared to work and to comply with orders: it would not be in the nature of an easy interlude.s. Our next course commences about 1st July and it may be possible to take him then, but at the moment I cannot say so with certainty* 4. If the Honourable the Political Resident wishes to have Shaikh Khalifah sent to the School, a reference would be necessary to - The Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political and Reforms Department, Bombay (Sir Charles Turner, K*C*I.E*&gt; C.S*I.

The regulations, which he has sent, would be applicable, mutatis mutandis, in Shaikh Khalifah 1 s case also. After he has passed tills course, which, the Inspector-General informs me, may take 10 months or two years according to his ability to pass examinations, the ques tion of giving him some pr cticai training in a district mi fit be considered- 2 - 4.

At the same time I appreciate that in Shaikh Khalifah’s case it may be desirable and politic to make some concession. This might be that he should be given the benefit of the vacations in June and December as in the case of subordinate officers. This gives him a month for each vacation if he wanted to go to Bahrain for a couple of weeks or so* As he would join some time in November, it would hardly seem worth whilewhile his taking the vacation in this December: he might wait till June 1938. Other students doing his course would not ordinarily get these vacations but naturally at Christmas time all get the benefit of the usual holiday then* I should be glad to know how this idea would suit in his case: if suitable, we could later arrange officially to have it carried out.

These fees are payable to the Principal of the School. ...The length of the course is usually 18 months but it naturally depends also on how long a student takes to pass his several examinations: some take longer than others* Ordinarily students doing the course suggested for Shaikh Khalifah are not given the vacations, but carry on with certain practical work- Leave is ordinarily not given to students except perhaps a few days in some urgent cases.

Bahrain, February 3, 1938. 3 Dear ii eight man, /V I spoke to you sometime ago about the allowance which is being paid to Shaikh Khalifah at the police school at Nasik. He receives Rs 350/- per month from the Civil List, and additional Rs 100/- was approved by His Highness when he went to Nasik and since then this has been increased to Rs 150/- per month making a total of Rs 500/- per month altogether. In addition he receives Rs 2,100/- in two six monthly payments, March and September, when oil royalty is paid. He now writes to me asking for Rs 500/- a month while he is at Nasik in addition to the Rs 350/- and the two six monthly payments and he says he cannot possibly get on with less than this amount at Nasik and if he does not get it he does not wish to remain there. I find that he has included over Rs 150/- for one month, mess bills. Could you write to the head of the school and ask whether in his opinion we are giving him too small an allowance.- 2 - l2o I understood in the beginning that the amount paid by Government included messing and I still cannot make out from Khalifah whether it does or not. According to his account he has to spend over Rs 600/- a month at Nasik and I canlefieve that this is the case. He seems to have suddenly taken a dislike to being there and wants to return at once, I have written to him again telling him to wait.

Political Agent, Bahrain.© Confidential. D.O. No. 1822/9-A. Bahrain, February 6, 1938. Dear Vveightman, O Before His Highness left for the Haj he approved of my suggestion that his son Shaikh Abdullah should be sent to England for a year in order to acquire a good knowledge of English. I mentioned this matter to you and to the Hon 1 Die the Political Hesident some time ago. Since then I have been dealing with the matter and in order not to cause any unnecessary trouble I have got into touch with people myself. The Hon’ble the Political Hesident, as you remem ber, told us that the Shaikh of Kuwait had asked him to arrange for his son to go to England and after taking a great deal of trouble the Shaikh had changed his mind at the last moment. When His Highness was in England I took him and the sons to Oxford for the day and from that time Shaikh Abdullah expressed a desire to go to Oxford. It is of course impossible for him to become an undergraduate but I think Oxford is a most suitable place for him to be in because there are so many young men there from foreign parts and there are people there who deal with foreign students. I then wrote to a very old friend of mine, the Reverend H. R. Martin, ohaplain of New College and- 2 - \ and Vicar of St. Michaels. He was at school with me and also at Oxford with me. I also wrote to Mr. E. G. Merchant, sub Hector of Lincoln, my own college whom I have known since I was up there. These two recommended a Colonel Gordon Browne, D.S.O., who takes in a few pupils many of whom have been foreigners. Gordon Browne is a Cambridge m.A. He was at Sandhurst but left the army before the war and took up coaching. He joined up again dur ing the war and was in command of his regiment (the Worcesters) in France, then on the staff and then served in the East. He passed the staff Arabic examination. He retired and has lived in Oxford for a good many years as a sort of superior coach. He has several young men living with him and coaches some himself and has tutors in for others. He is married, his wife comes from Norfolk and I Know of some of her relations who are proper people.5^ ^ He is now living in Banbury road but is moving into a larger house in March. Both Martin and Marchant know him personally and strongly recommend him. My idea is that if Shaikh Abdullah goes to his place he will get something of college life without the college. I also think that it is an advantage for him to be in a place where there are people who know him and can sometimes see and entertain him. He met both Martin and Marchant at Oxford and he and' o (J^) r -3- and his father spent most of a day with some cousins of mine who have a house in the is the country outside Oxford. They too would deal with him. I used to live in Oxfordshire and I know people round about there. Gordon Browned establishment is not cheap. His terms are £1,000. for one year, this is his normal charge, but from what I hear of the way he looks after the boys, I do not think it is very expensive. It would pro bably be possible to find somewhere cheaper, but ii the experiment turns out a success, I think it would be worth that money. Gordon Browne says that he will teach Shaikh Abdullah English and coach him in the rudiments oi international, civil and criminal law. These are suojects I suggested. He would also give him the opportunity©! learning about B^nglish ideas and customs and would take him about to various places inland and by the sea. He would have his own sitting room and bedroom and fires and all that sort of thing. I have written to Sir Verney Lovett, K.C.S.I., Header in Indian History at Oxford and to Sir Richard Burn, K.C.I.B., retired I.C.S., asking for more particulars about Gordon Browne and I hope to hear from them shortly. There are still various particulars which I have to go into.If the arrangement is approved of I should like to send Shaikh Abdullah to England in march or early April and when I am home I shall be able to see him at Oxford. Will you please inform the Hon'ble the Political Resident about this matter? His Highness left it to me to make all arrange ments but knowing how sometimes people change their minds I thought it best not to involve the GrOvem- ment ol India in any trouble over the scheme until I had dealt with it myself up to this point. Yours sincerely, H. Weigh' 1 '— T1 ' I.C.S H.B.M's Bahrain.Confidential D.O•No.C/124-4/7. The 13th February 1938. I enclose herewith a copy of a letter from Belgrave regarding the proposal that Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad should be sent to England for a year. It is the rule in India that when sons of Ruling Princes are being sent to Europe Government is informed in advance, and I imagine that the same procedure should apply here. 2. I need scarcely say that I agree very fully v/ith Bel- grave* s view that it is highly desirable to send Abdullah to England, and though the arrangements which Belgrave is making are somewhat expensive it is really not a serious matter in these days of oil prosperity, and the arrangements themselves seem to be admirable. 3 . I will keep you informed of further developments.

My dear Moss e have been receiving complaints that the allowance granted by the Bahrain Government to young Shaikh Khalifah bln Moharsjnad al I^halifahj who is at present und^r training at i asikj is insufficient for his needs* He sent accounts the other day to show that it is costing him something in the region of rts. 400/— a month to live at Naslk| quite apart from any expenses incurred on occasions such as Christmas vi sits to Bombay. I gather that he does not live in a mess 9 and his bills for food seem to be pretty high. Naturally a stran ger in a strange land always finds it more expensive to live than neople who know the place and know the ropes, but I should be most grateful if you could give me some idea of what you think it should cost Khalifah to live in Nasik. He is a mem ber of the Ruling Family in Bahrain, and so perhaps has rather extravagant ideas of how he should keep up his position; but it would be reasonable, as a matter of fact, to make a certain amount of allowance for this, though possibly not to the ex tent that he himself thinks fit. 2. I apologise for troubling you with this matter, but I am extremely anxious that khalifah should make a success of his Nasik training, and obviously if he feels that he is not being given a square deal by Bahrain he will not be in the right ffame of mind to make the best possible use of his train ing.

A little more may he allowed him, *f considered necessary, as pocket money, hut I would not recommend too large an allowance, shaikh khalifa’s expenses during his uncle’s visit to India, of course, must have been heavy, hut that was an exceptional occasion and is not likely to occur again. Ny. Supdts. of Police are allowed Rs.200/- p.m. while under training hut this sum barely covers expenses and usually has to he supple- -mented by private means, ihe allowance suggested by me of course, would not cover travelling expenses to -Bahrain and hack during the school vacations. 2 . Shaikh Khalifah is a-decent living,steady young man and I am glad to say is now settling down very well, although at one time he was very homesick and even talked about throwing in his hand, ue is very popular with the other i^roby: Officers and takes a keen interest in all activities of the school. As regards his studies, he is definitely a trier and works hard, but, as X expect you are aware, his knowledge of .uinglish is not good and ne finds great difficulty in expressing himself on paper, iiowever he showed very much better results during the last examination and 1 have no doubt he will improve, iiis English is, however, a very great handicap and I doubt whether he will reach the standard required by the civil service Commissioners, but 1 do not suppose that that really matters a great deal from your point of view. *©ightman, iisqr., i.U.3.

I made en- quiries from the Police Training School, and I now enclose e copy of a letter which 1 have received from the Principal. 2. On the basis of this letter it would seem reasonable to give Khalifah about Ra. 275/- or Rs. 300/- per month while he is at ’ aaik,and of course any increase would presumably have retrospective effect from the time he went there. 3. The comments in paragraph 2 of the Principal's letter are really very encouraging, and I have no doubt that His Highness and you will be as pleased at this report as I am. It is not Ihalifah's fault that his knowledge of English is below Vta standard, and the main thing is that he seems to be making a real effort to get the best out of his course at Nasik.

Shaikh Kalifah should remain at the School- In this connection I might mention that ordinarily our own candidates stay not less than 18 months as it generally takes them this period to pass their examinations, including the practical which means all parade and outdoor work: I suggest this practical examination could be undertaken by Shaikh Kalifah and would indeed be very desirable. It is admittedly a question for the Bahrain Government to settle, but, if I may do so, I would recommend at least an 18 months’ course- For reasons of quarters and accommodation we do not want to retain any officer at the School longer than necessary- It may not be perhaps relevant, but I might add that our own officers doing the same course as Shaikh Kalifah have to do a subsequent course of twelve months under practical training in one of our districts. But I do not think the Bahrain Government would desire such subsequent practical trainingConfidential &gt; D.O.

I am afraid it will seem a little queer, in view of the opinion expressed in that letter, that I should write to you now and ask you for your advice on the subject. My excuse is that you now know Khalifah pretty well and that as a result of your knowledge you can give me the best possible assistance in advising the Bahrain Government on this question. Khalifah came to see me the other day and I gathered from him the imp ression that you thought he could finish all that is really worth while in his particular circumstances by December. He spoke of the A Class next January being mainly devoted to dacoit and accounts work, which of course will not be of any particular value afterwards in Bahrain, On the other hand I am rather an xious that he should spend two or three months both in a mofUs- sil thana and in a city thana with the object of accompanying Sub-Inspectors engaged on the actual investigation of represents tive cases. Admittedly a great deal of the detail a Bub-Ins pector in India has to go through is not necessary in Bahrain, but at least Khalifah will get practical experience of the points which an investigating officer in India directs his at tention to when he is up against, say, a murder case or robbery or theft. All this of course would have to be arranged with the Bombay Government in due course, and I am rather afraid that I ahould/- C.H. de V.

By December Khalifa should have a sufficiently good grounding in subjects such as the Indian Penal Code,Criminal Procedure Code,Evidence Act and practical training,which after all is what he most requires. I wouls^ suggest,if I may,that for the subsequent course in¥ 1 DEPARTMENT. &lt;&gt; /Hx^JUKXSif aaj - ■-,.A ., pi.^ *■■ practical training,Khalifa should be attached,if possible. to the Bombay City Police,as I consider the conditions and problems of police work in Bahrain are probably far more similar to those pertaining in Bombay City than elsewhere in the mofussil.

Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to your Con* / fidential letter No. 4931/11 dated the 22nd JUne 1938 in re gard to the training of Shaikh Khalifah bin Muhammad al Khali- fah. I much regret that your letter has remained unanswered so long, but the Adviser to the Bahrain Government is at pre sent on leave and I have been unable to consult His Highness the Shaikh personally owing to the letter’s illness. As how ever an early decision is desirable I would like to make the following suggestions. 2. As it has been accepted that Shaikh Khalifah is not re quired to pass the usual examinations in Law, and as 1 under stand that a large part of the syllabus for the last six months in a normal course consists of such subjects as the Police Manual and Minor Acts and Accounts, it seems to me that the balance of advantage rests with Shaikh Khalifah ending his period at the school in December. It mi^it then, if the Bom bay Government would be prepared to agree, be arranged that he should undergo a further course of practical training at a Police Station, preferably with the Bombay Qity Police. This further training might extend to a period of three or four months (subject to your approval) and would be particularly valuable in ensuring that Shaikh Khalifah, by observation of the/-the practical methods adopted by Police Officers in their investigations! should return to Bahrain in due course with a fund of practical knowledge which would be of great value to him and the Bahrain Government later# If you agree with this suggestion it will not f I am sure t be difficult to ob tain the Bahrain Governments agreement# 3# I saw Shaikh Khalifah recently and, if I may, I should like to say how greatly he has benefitted from his course at Naaik. He already exhibits greatly increased self-reliance and has obviously acquired a very fair sense of discipline# The Bahrain Government are indeed under a debt of gratitude to the Principal of the Police Training School# I have the honour to be, Sir, Your moat obedient servant, I t/v Political Agent, BahrainME'iORAMJI.

I har^rhe honour to invite attention to my letter No.4931-11 dated 3rd August last regarding some practical p ) { % training for Shaikh Khalifah and to send herewith copy of a letter received by our Government from the Resident in the Persian Gulf. In this connection Shaikh Khalifah recently y’ .^ ^ expressed to me a desire to be put through a course of Military ' tralnln g special reference to musketry, the use of Lewis guns etc. I am posting him to Ahmedabad (our second largest city&gt; for part of his Police training and later in our Bombay Suburban District. If the Bahrain Government desire that Shaikh Khalifah should also do a month 1 s training with an Indian Regiment (as our own young officers do on passing out of the School), I could arrange to have^it done either in Ahmedabad or Bombay or Poona through the Military authorities: it would probably be with the Sappers and Miners in Poona, with the 5th Mahratta Light Infantry in Bombay, and with a Battalion of the 6th Rajputs in Ahmedabad. If the Government have any particular choice, I should be glad to know it: incidentally I might mention we endeavour to send oujfc officers to the Sappers and Miners as they are permanently stationed in Poona and have a good Mess with a goodly number of young officers forx Cl social company: in Poona I could keep easily in personal contact with Shaikh Khalifah. Further, I should like to know if this month T s Military training should be in addition to the three months’ Police training or should be included in the three months with necessarily a month’s reduction of Police work. In any case Shaikh Khalifah would be required to report for duty in Ahmedabad on 3rd January after the Christmas holidays. I should be glad of the favour of an early reply. I have the honour to be.

I know little about the Indian Army so if you agree perhaps you would suggest which regiment would be suitable, the Inspector General of Police evidently favours Sappers and Miners.

On return he is being posted to the Bombay Suburban District under the District Superintendent of Police (H.B. Kidd) to get an insight in Bombay and Suburban Police work. I am arranging at the same time that he should see how Bombay Harbour Police work is done in all its details: I know Shaikh Khalifa was anxious to do this. The question of his residence in the Bombay Suburban District was beset with difficulties as 1 did not want Shaikh Khalifa to be on his own and without good company in a place like Bombay and its suburbs. Mr. and Mrs. Kidd have kindly arranged to take him to live with them, which is very convenient and suitable. After his month in the Bombay Suburban District-•••■SS I am bringing him up to Poona and shall arrange shortly with Southern Command about his attachment here to a Regiment: it will .probably be the Royal Bombay Sappers and Miners, who have a collection of young offi- eers and a good Mess.

Even a small memento would entail a reference to Government: under our previous regime the idea might have been sanctioned, but now I would prefer not to risk a rebuff to His Highness. May I leave it at that? A short note of thanks on behalf of His Highness to Mrs. Kidd would no doubt be appreciated. Yours sincerely, To, H. Weightman Esq., I.C.S.Personal. Poona, 10th April 1939. My dear Weightman, This is for your personal information and not for the Bahrain Government. In connection with Shaikh Khalifa I suggested to our Governor (Sir Roger Lumley) that it would be a good diplomatic gesture if he were to take some recognition of Shaikh Khalifa before he finally returned to Bahrain. Anything to foster good Arab feelings would never be amiss just now is what I feel about it. As His Excellency was working in the a—-* Foreign Office, he readily^agreed to the suggestion and has left it to me to settle details later. I cannot at the moment say what will be done: as Kis Excellency will be in residence in Poona when Shaikh Khalifa leaves, I expect it will be at any rate a lunch followed by a private interview. If you think the gesture might take some other form, I should be glad of any suggestion. I have of course~1S8 no objection to your passing on this proposal to the Resident. Yours sincerely, H.

Locally 1 should inform His Highness, after the lunch party, that it was an honour accorded vicariously by His Excellency to the Shaikh of Bahrain himself, through the person of one of hi* close relatives who has had the privilege of receiving training from some of His Excellency’s officers. 3, It is very kind indeed of you to have thought of this.

I saw him on the 19th instant and found that he was quite satisfied with what was shown to him in Bombay during May and with the Sappers and Miners in Poona.
