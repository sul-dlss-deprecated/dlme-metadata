Their claim is against Lukoomal Devanmal, a British Indian subject and former tenant shop keeper who had returned to Tatta in Sind Province [Thatta, Sindh, Pakistan].

Included in the correspondence are the following original Arabic documents: a petition from the claimant Muhammad Saleh Kadhem to Shaikh Sa’id the Ruler of Dubai [Shaikh Saʻīd bin Maktūm bin Hasher Āl Maktūm], and a letter from the Ruler of Dubai to the Residency Agent, Sharjah, forwarding the petition to him for investigation of the claim.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Debt recovery</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Claims</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000260#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000260#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000260#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
