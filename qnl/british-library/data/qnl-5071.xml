Lord Clarendon informed Mr. Barron that ‘ the Sultan was the real Sovereign over the district ’ (although a portion of it was outside the Straits of Bab el Mandeb) ; but he nevertheless instructed him to tell the Porte confidentially that the British Government would deprecate the establishment of a foreign Settlement in the immediate vicinity of Aden. “ The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, however, assured Mr. Barron that the scheme was not in any way under the pro tection of the Turkish Government; and he added that the French Government had disclaimed all knowledge of the transaction; that the Sheikh had no right whatever to sell the territory; and that it was the intention of the Porte to send a flotilla of two or three small vessels to the Bed Sea with a view of preventing similar encroachments. “ Nevertheless it was reported in the following month that the same French Company had definitely purchased the territory called ‘ Sheikh Saidbut the harbour was found to be too shallow to be serviceable, and it was believed that the scheme would be abandoned; although M. Aubert, Secretary of the French Embassy at Constantinople, stated to Lord Lyons, in course of conversation, that ‘ the affair of Sheikh Said was a pending questionand he argued that the sovereignty of the Sultan over these remote regions was far from being established, and at all events, that the European guarantee of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire could not be held to extend indefinitely in directions in which the frontier was not distinctly mentioned. “ Still the Porte continued to deny the right of any one to alienate the land in question to a foreign State, and proposed either to refund the money that had been paid for it, or to allow it to be used as a station or depot for French commerce without its being withdrawn from the Sultan’s jurisdiction. “ In December 1871 it was publicly reported that the French had finally abandoned Sheikh Said; whereupon the French Con sular Agent at Aden wrote a letter to the British Agent at Aden, in which he said ‘ the French, or, to speak more correctly, ‘ MM. C. et A. Bazier et Raband, Freres, of Marseilles, have in ‘ no way renounced their establishment of Sheikh Saeed, which ‘ remains, as heretofore, their property absolutely. Only, as it is ‘ necessary that the question between the said mercantile house ‘ aud the Government of His Majesty the Sultan should be treated ‘ in a diplomatic way, and as the status quo has been agreed to by both parties, with a view to this, the personnel has been ‘ provisionally re-called home, in order to avoid useless expense.” ‘ But,’ he added, ‘ the rights of us French to this territory could ‘ not be discussed otherwise than favourably by the English press, ‘ seeing that they are founded, so far as regards Turkey, on the ‘ same basis as the Residencies of Aden and Perim, formerly the pioperty of independent Chiefs, in spite of all pretensions to the ‘ contrary.’ “ In the following month the Turkish Governor of Hodeida was reported to have written to the French Consular Agent at Aden re-asserting the claims of the Porte upon the territory of Sheikh Saeed, and apprising him that formal possession of it would shortly be taken.” Sheikh Said was visited in 1870 by Commander W. Chimmo, of H.M.’s surveying ship “Nassau.” He made a sketch of the place, and submitted a report, in which he wrote :— .... . j suns ai oneikn » some civil engineers, &amp;c., and they are living in two tents, flying the Jb reach flag and the other the Company’s fla- n* Mr. Barron, No. 42, 28th March 1870.

A 2 “ The Turkish Governor of Mocha, on hearing of the occu pation, went there with 500 troops, and they are now encamped under Bab-el-Mandeb hills, and intend to remain there until orders come from Constantinople on the subject. “ The object of the French appears to be to cut a canal through the opening into the lake, and to cut docks, &amp;c., in the lake large enough to receive ships, and run out a pier or breakwater to the north of the opening. “ The place is of great importance, being the entrance to the Rod Sea, and is capable of being strongly fortified. “ A French brig was at anchor off the place, said to have guns and stores on board. Wells have been dug there, and a stockade is now building by the Turks and Arabs. “ The French have 18 miles on each side of the Cape, and the boundary marked off by posts with French colours.” In January 1885 the Resident at Aden telegraphed that a French gunboat had stayed 40 hours at Sheikh Said and taken soundings. The captain landed with an escort and interpreter, but was warned off by the Turkish guard vessel. He left saying that early action was certain, as the place was purchased by France from the Sultan. Shortly after this the Resident announced that 800 Turkish troops had occupied Sheikh Said, and Letter from Aden, 19th October 1885. that information had been communicated to him by (B. 6.) a correspondent at Hodeida, which appeared to in dicate that the Turkish Government desired to make a permanent settlement there.

Lord Lyons Yol. 71, p. 201. communicated an article from the “ Temps,” stating that the French naval officers who were sent to examine the place had given an unfavourable report of it:—, “ MM. le contre Amiral de Boissoudy et 1’ingenieur hydro- graphe Gaspari font de retour de la mission qu’ils viennent de remplir a Cheik Said. Ils estiment, croyous nous, que pour faire de ce point une station serieuse il faudrait y depenser de sommes tres considerables tant pour construire les jetees indispensables pour un port en eau calme que pour les ouvrages de fortification a etablir au sommet de la montagne qui commande Perim.” Enclosure to Letter from Aden, No. 14, In 1887, Commander J. E. Blaxland, H.M.S. 18th July 1887. “ Griffin,” was instructed to visit Sheikh Said, and gave the following description of the fort under construction by the Turkish Government:— “ I proceeded to Warner Point on the Arabian coast, and, in company with Captain Lyde, Assistant Resident at Perim, visited the fort which is being built by the Turkish Government at that place. It is a closed work, situated on the spur of a hill, some 250 feet above Warner Point. It is semi-circular on the sea front, and is about 60 feet in diameter. The land face consists of barracks for the accommodation of about 40 or 50 troops, and through which is the entrance to the fort. I saw two bronze 15 cm. Krupp guns on field carriages outside the fort, but none were in position inside the fort, which is not yet finished. There is a second barrack on the same hill, and a third is to be built, I was told. “ The fort commands a great part of the small straits, and bears N. 79° E., 4 miles from Perim lighthouse, and is distant 53 miles from the Perim harbour coal stores. It does not, however, appear to be very formidable, and, the Colonel in command of the Turkish troops informed me, is intended as a protection for his men in the event of their being attacked by the Arabs. At present they are encamped on the plain.” A more detailed account was rendered by the Assistant Resident at Perim who went to Sheikh Said in October 1887. His report is as follows:— “ According to instructions received, I beg to report that I visited the Turkish commandant of the new Turkish fort at Enclosure to Letter from Aden. No. 26, dated 4th November 1887.4 Tonrbeah yesterday, and 1 beg to submit the following obser vations made during the visit. The sketches enclosed do not, ol course, pretend to be accurate as regards distances, but the main points may be depended on, such as the construction of the fort, the position and direction of the guns, as also the main features of the sketch. “ The fort. —The fort is circular, with the exception of the rear portion, which is a barrack for the artillery manning the lort, and is a parallelogram. The wall is about four feet high and about four feet thick, with a sloped top, and is constructed for guns en barbette, consequently having no embrasures. The fort is divided almost in the middle by stone and iron railings placed about two yards apart, the portion seawards forming the battery being about three to four feet above the remaining portion of the fort. The part marked ‘ k D ” in the sketch is a banquette for infantry, and commands the road to Shaikh Said. That part marked E, E, E is as yet uncompleted. The fort is con structed for four guns, but six might be mounted if occasion required. “ The guns .—There are two guns at present mounted, being bronze breech-loading guns of (15) fifteen centimetres calibre, and were constructed at Constantinople on Krupp’s pattern. They are mounted on wheeled carriages somewhat similar to the field gun carriages. They could be mounted at any part of the semicircle above the railings. The general direction is the “ Brothers,”* thus the position can be laid down exactly on reference to the chart. At the spot marked “ A ” on the sketch, tfo. 1, the Red Sea is commanded for a short distance, but I should imagine that the water at that part would be too shoal for ships of war. The present position of the guns is marked, but they could be placed in any position in the semicircle. “ The fort is situated on a small elevated plateau stretching a short distance into the sea, having a bay and headlands on either hand. To the rear are hills of a greater elevation. To judge by the eye, and from ascending, the height of the fort above the sea line might be 1,000 to 1,200 feet. There is a good road from Shaikh Said up to the fort, and another is under construction leading to the barracks, stores, &amp;c., and to the bay to the eastwards, where the erection of a bunder is in contemplation. “ Sketch Ao. 2.—The bay marked A, A, would seem the natural position to take up in the event of it becoming necessary to silence this fort, but I am informed that the water there is too shallow to admit of a man-of-war of any size entering there. If this is the case, the only way I should recommend of silencing the fort would be by direct shelling from the seaward. To take this fort by assault would be almost an impossible undertaking, as the sides of the hill are very steep, and are directly commanded by the fort, and very few men would be sufficient to repel any attempt to carry the work by assault. “ There is at present no water in the fort of any description, and thus, by investing the fort by sea and land, it must be reduced shortly after supplies of. water were exhausted. Of course, I premise that the attacking fire would be heavy enough to prevent condensers from working, and steps being taken to prevent sea-water to supply them being obtained. There are, however, wells in the sandy plains below the hills on which the fort is situated. It would be useless to attempt to command the fort from the hills here, as they are too steep to admit of guns being transported to them. “ I regret that the sketches are not more presentable and accurate, but they were necessarily done from memory, and I have no instruments to make a neater sketch with.” * Islets near Perim. A few years ago a Mr. Sinyaki, then Private Secretary to Mr. H. Grindstone, M.P., sent to Sir A. Godley papers, showing that some merchants of Marseilles — perhaps the alleged French Con cessionaires — were endeavouring to dispose of Sheikh Said by sale. The position of affairs was explained by the Department to Mr. Sinyaki, and the documents were returned to him.It might be advisable to instruct the Resident at Aden to depute the Assistant Resident at Perim at some convenient opportunity to Sheikh Said, with the object of ascertaining the present condition of the place.
