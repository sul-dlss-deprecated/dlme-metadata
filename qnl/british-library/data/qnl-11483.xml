Since the acceflion of the Crimea to Ruffia, the emprefs hath held out an avowed protection to Heraclius, who is now declared an independant prince ; and it appears that an officer of the court has been deputed to prefent him, in the imperial name, with a crown of gold, and the title of King of Grafia.* By this ad of policy, which involved no danger or charge, hath the afpiring monarch of Ruffia, fecured an ufeful ally, and efta- blifhed on the fide of Georgia a fubftantial barrier againft the natural enemies of her Rate. The other potentates of Europe, are in the ufage of prefenting their portraits, fome curious ani mal, perhaps, or patents of nobility to their allies and favo rites ; but a commanding fortune has enabled Catharine to be llow on her friends,'j' crowns and kingdoms.

Without ceremony he entered into a general difcuffion of the hiftory of Perfia, from the period of Hanway’s concluflon to the prefent time, and treated the fubject with much apparent accuracy. This gentleman of the name of Marcke, had held the rank of Brigadier General, in the Ruffian fervice, and for fome years directed the affairs of the Ruffian factory at Ghilan. But, on a charge of oppreffing fome Armenian merchants, he was difmif- fed from the fervice, and mul£ted in the whole amount of his property. Mr. Marcke concluded his obfervations on Perfia, by noticing, that the Captain Elton, who has been already men tioned, married an Armenian woman in Ghilan, and his daugh ter, the iffue of that marriage, was now refiding at Aftracan. Intelligence, he faid, had been received, that an eftate or legacy had been bequeathed to Elton, during his fuppofed refidence in Perfia, and that if fuch property had really devolved on him, no one poffeffed a fairer claim to it than his daughter, who could afcertain the legitimacy of her birth, and who now a widow, encumbered with many children, was icduced to extieme M m 2 indi-FORSTER’S TRAVELS. 276 ' indigence.* It would be an aft of charity, he added, to make an enquiry on my arrival in England into the truth of this intelligence, and endeavour to obtain fome provifion for a dif- treffed family. Noticing in me a more than ordinary concern for the misfortunes of this woman and the fate of her father, he faid, that if I faw her, I fhould be enabled to reprefent her fituation with more corroborating fafts. He objefted to the pro- pofal of my going to her houfe, apprehending from her manner of life, that the vifit would be incommodious; but went him- jelf and condufted her to Mr. Long’s lodgings.

He had ferved likewife in the corps of engineers, where I have fince underflood, he acquired the reputation of an officer of ability, and formed a friendfhip with the prefent governor of Aflracan, who now renders him many offices of kindnefs. After occupying various flations in the fervice of Ruffia, he was appointed to the direction of the Ghi- lan factory, whence he had been removed at the infligation of the Armenians, who, he faid, perfecuted him with uncommon marks of malignity. His property was confifcated, and he re ceived the fentence of banifhment to Siberia, which was afterwards commuted to a clofe refidence at Aflracan. His deportment evinced an unaffected refignation to . the lot which had befallen him ; nor was it devoid of a manly exertion of fpirit.

On the 12th of May, at midnight, having travelled two hun dred and fifty-eight miles, and two thirds, I arrived at Czaritfin, where I was detained until the next morning, that my paffport might be examined by the commandant.

It is faid, that the emprefs occafionally exprefles a difpofition to open a channel between the two rivers ; a defign which had been under taken by the great Peter, but fruftrated by the unfuccefsful iffue of the Turkifh war, as well as certain difficulties which attended the operation.* The ground occupying this fpace, which I examined, is chiefly compofed of gravel or rock, and apparently little higher than the level of the rivers. By opening this pafiage, an inland navigation would be effected from the Black-fea to Siberia, by the medium of the river Kamah, which rifes in that province, and falls into the Volga, about forty miles below the city of Cazan ; and the Ruffian marine, now eftablifhed on.the Black-fea,f which has long been a favourite object at Peterfburgh, would receive from this communication a fupply of commodities, the moft effential to its fupport; as timber, iron, cordage and canvas.

The Day on which I left Czaritfin, the road led along the fouthern bank of the Don, which was wholly uninhabited $ its current feemed to run at the rate of one mile and a half an hour, and the breadth to be about three hundred yards.

At the diftance of a few miles from Choperfkoy, the dri ver* of the carriage alarmed me by a report of the hinder axle being {battered : an accident which gave me an opportunity of obferving the dexterity of a Ruffian carpenter in the ufe of the axe. Without the help of any other tool, except a narrow chif- fel, to cut a fpace in the centre of it for receiving an iron bar which fupports the axle, and to pierce holes for the linch pins, he reduced in two hours a piece of grofs timber to the requi- fite form, and his charge was one {hilling. Travelling one hundred and twenty miles from this place, I arrived at the city of Tanboff, not large, but populous, and generally well built, the refidence of a governor, who examined and put his fignature to my pafsport. The country was level, bearing little wood, and from Aftracan to this place I had not feen a ftone on its furface. A heavy rain fell during the night of my departure from Tanboff, which caufed an overflowing of the adjacent brooks, in one of which the carriage funk fo deep, that the horfes with every effort could not drag it, though fie- nuoufly affiffed by the driver. This trivial event fhould not have been intruded on you, did it not tend to delineate the cha- \ ra6ter of a Ruffian peafant. * He fits on a low feat, fixed on the fore axle. After 1I FORSTER’S TRAVELS. 2S3 After trying various methods to extricate the carriage in vain, and without a murmur, though the weather was piercingly cold, and he was dripping wet, he loofened the horfes, and yoking them to the hinder part of the carriage, he brought it back wards to dry ground. He endeavoured to pafs at another place, and was again foiled; yet he preferved an evennefs of temper, which I did not think our nature poffeffed. He did not ceafe a moment from applying fuch aids as were beft adapted to our relief; nor once fhrunk from a chilling wind and rain, which had thrown me into an ague ; but fevere patience, and an in durance of the rougheft inclemency of weather, are qualities with which the peafant of Ruffia is conftitutionally endowed. Whilft we were ftruggling againft this difficulty, which feemed to me re- medilels, a paffenger leading fome horfes, faw the embarrafsment, and chearfully yoking two of them to the carriage gave us fpeedy relief.

From the Volga to this city, I had not feen any land fo much ele vated as to merit the name of a hill, and but few ftones on the ground. The buildings in Ruffia, with an exception of fome of the public ftruftures, and houfes of the principal people, cue com- poled of wood, which is io abundant a commodity, that in many places it forms the ftreets of towns and villages.

At every halting-place, 1 muft again notice, the people treated me with invariable civility ; inviting me into their houfes dur ing the change of horfes, and fupplying, at a moderate rate, the things which I wanted. The roads in Ruffia, during the dry feafon, are in a good condition naturally j for little labor is be- ftowed on them j which indeed from the large tradls of inter vening waftes would be impracticable. On fome days when the horfes were ftrong, I have travelled from one hundred and twenty, to one hundred and thirty miles, over a country on which the eye could perceive no elevation. The intervening rivers I either paired on floating bridges or ferry boats, there being no fixed bridge on the road from Aftracan to this city. On approaching Mofcow, its numerous and lofty fpires* fhooting though extenfive plantations, exhibit a view equally pic- turefque and magnificent. The gardens interfperfed through this city, have given it a more extenfive fite than is requifite to con tain, perhaps, three times the number of its inhabitants, who are computed at three or four hundred thou fan d. * I was informed that the fteeples in MofcoWj amount to fixteen hundred. TheFORSTER'S TRAVELS. 285 The driver of the carriage conducted me to a German ho tel, whofe manager, a very affiduous and obliging perfon, fpoke the Englifh language fluently, and though he had experienced a variety of fortunes, fome of it very adverfe, he had acquired but little knowledge of the world; that is, he was ill qualified to combat its iniquitous pradlices, or to derive an adequate pro fit from his profefiion. By a credulity and benevolence of dif- pofition, he had fallen a prey to many of the foreign adven turers who infeft Mofcow, among whom I was mortified to fee fome of my own countrymen numbered.

A fire many years ago deftroyed the build ing in which it was fufpended, and falling to the ground, where it has fince remained, a piece was broken from its fide. Moscow though no longer the capital of the empire, hath not felt thofe fymptoms of decay, which are feen to follow the deprivation of fovereign refidence.

Mr. Zchernichoff, the governor-general of Mofcow, has acquired in the adminiftration of his office, a general good name, by the eilabliffiment of a vigorous police, and bellowing on the city many ornaments. Standing high in favor of the emprefs, „ whom his family had ftrongly aided in afcending the throne, his defires are confidered as equal to thofe of the court; and it may be deemed equally conducive to the welfare of Mofcow, as that of the nation at large, that a fubje£l of fuch zeal and authority has been placed in fo eminent a Ration. The character of Mr. Zchernichoff deferves the more diftinguifhed notice, as a ffiame- lefs laxity and corruption are feen to pervade every office and department of this wide empire, to counterpoife its powers and warp the direction of its natural policy. Mr. Hannicoff having given me a letter to his brother at Mofcow, I went to this gentleman’s houfe, where, with much mortification, I faw every thing French. The furniture, the drefs of the family, its manners, and the preceptor of the chil dren were all French. The Ruffian gentry, indeed, from what ever other quarter they have drawn fcience and literature, have received a large portion of their manners from France; and it is evidently feen, that a connexion cemented by fo ftrong a partiality, has occafionally attracted Raffia, from its eonflitutional bias, and infufed a fpirit of policy inimical to its welfare.

It is to be noticed that the Ruffians of all ranks are of a fallow and brown complexion ; few of them, even when young, having a natural bloom of face 5 this defedt I am induced to attribute partially to the exceffive warmth of their ftoves, and a frequent ufe of the hot bath, which in Ruffia contains a more intenfe heat than I have experienced in any country. After dining with my German hoft, whofe attentions to me had been indefatigable, and his charge moderate, I left Mofcow on the acth of May 3 on the next morning I arrived at the town of Klin, and breakfafted with an acquaintance of my Mof cow friend.

On the 25th of May, I entered Peterfburgh, and procured a commodious lodging at an Englifh tavern.

In fo tranfient a vifitor, it would be a manifeft prefumption to give any detailed account of this fplendid city, or to defcribe its conftitution or laws. I will, however, notice fuch matter, as its more immediate proje&amp;ion forces on ordinary obfervation. The view of Peterfburgh, adorned with its numerous magnificent build ings, interfered by fpacious and regular flreets, imparts the con- fequent pleafure of beholding a beautiful objeft j but when I looked on the period, removed only at the diftance of feventy years, when this fpot, now covered by a proud city, reforted to by all the nations of the' European world, and enriched by an ac tive commerce, was a dreary morafs, affording a miferable refidence to a hord of rude fifhermen. I was infpired with reverence and wonder, when I refle£l:ed on the creative genius of the man who had accomplifhed fo glorious a work. Other monarchs have mo delled armies, aggrandifed kingdoms by conqueft, or gradual civili zation j but Peter at once difpelled the cloud of barbarifm, which inveloped his country, and brought it forth to the aftoniftied and applauding view of Europe.

Nor muft we forget i m that thirft of knowledge, which carried him into foreign countries to court their fcience, and pra£tife their arts. This fubject hath infenfibly produced a ftrain of writing, too ftrongly I fear impreg nated with that fpecies of colouring, which marks the compofition of the Afiatics, and indeed their ordinary converfation, and which, by an intimate connection with them for many years, has perhaps become habitual to me. When you advert therefore to the foci- eties I have mixed in, and alfo to a warm impulfe, which has prompted me to throw a laurel at the brow of Peter, I hope that this effervefcence of ftyle will meet with an indulgent eye. From the drefles of the nobility, enriched by a various dis play of jewels, their equipage and pompous retinue, the court of Peterlburgh is faid to be the moft brilliant in Europe j and it Ihould feem, that the emprefs manifeftly indulges * this dif- pofition in the courtiers, whether from the congenial propenfity of a female mind, or an opinion, that the intrigues and machina tions which fhe has heretofore fuccefsfully pra&amp;iced, will not deeply occupy the minds of a people, involved in luxury and diffipation. The Ruffian gentry, efpecially thofe attached to the court, * She has eftabliftied at Peterfburgh, four companies of players, of different na tions, French, German, Italian and Ruffian, which receive falaries from the public treafury.FORSTER’S TRAVELS, are either in debt, or they expend the full amount of their re venue ; and if the teftimony of thofe who have made the expe riment is to be credited, we muft believe in the extreme ve nality of the minifters of government, however adverfe to the public welfare. The adminiftration of count Panin gave a ftrong proof of this difpofition. The French who have ever avowedly oppofed the views of this empire, have afforded with out referve, affiftance to its enemies, and who, it is faid, re- ftrift its Mediterranean fquadron, to eight fhips of the line, poffefTed during Panin’s miniftry, a leading fway in the Ruffian cabinet,, which they rendered hoftile to the general interefts of the empire. Since that period, Ruffia has adopted a more na tural policy, and is aware of the falutary expediency of form ing a cordial intercourfe with the court of London.

The government of Aftracan, is now directed by a fyftem wholly civil and commercial, and the garrifon confifts of about fifteen hundred men, who have more the appearance of militia than regular troops, and are confpicuoufly deficient in military order. In this city, which occupies a mediate fituation between Afia and Europe, there is perhaps a more diverfified affemblage of nations, than on any other fpot on the globe, and a more liberal difplay of toleration ; you fee the Greek, Lutheran, and Roman churches, mingled with the Mahometan mofque and Hindoo pagoda, and the different fcctaries united by the bonds of a common focial compatt.

Yet it is evident, from the precipitated current of the rivers of this quarter of India, that the valley of Kafhmire is confiderably more elevated than the Punjab plains.

It fliould have been before noticed, that oui patron, from the lamenefs of his hand and a general infii m ftate of body, was obliged to travel in a litter; a fpecies of carriage different from any feen in the fouthern quarters of India. The frame of four flight pieces of wood, is about four feet and a half long, and three in breadth, with a bottom of cot ton lacing or fplit canes interwoven. Two flout bamboo poles, project three feet, from the end of the frame and are fattened to its outward fldes, by iron rings. The extremities of thefe bamboos are loofely connected by folds of cords, into which is fixed, by clofely twitting and binding at the centre, a thick pole, three feet long; and by thefe central poles, the litter, or as it is here calied, the Sampan, is fupported on the (boulders of four men.

In the paflage of fome of the fteep hills the Khan was obliged to walk, and it feemed to me furprifing, that the bearers were able to carry the litter over them. The Kafhmirians, who are the ordinary travellers of this road, ufe fandals made of ftraw rope, as an approved defence of their feet, and to fave their fhoes.

On the 27th, at Iflaamabad, five coffes — a large town, fituate on the north fide of the river Jalum, which is here fpringing from the mountains, or penetrating them in narrow openings. At this place the Jalum, over which a wooden bridge is built, is about eighty yards acrofs, and from the level furface of the country has a gentle current. Our party, this evening, hired a boat to proceed to the city, and had gone more than five miles, when a written order ar rived, in an evil hour, requiring us to return and remain at Ifla- / amabad, until a paflport ftiould be obtained from the court. This check infufed a general gloom, and rendered our fituation, already confined and irkfome, almoft comfortlefs. The boat, a very fmall one.6 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. one, was fcantily coveted with a Render mat, and the wind, current, and a heavy rain had fet in againil us. The rain continued incef- fantly the whole night, and though my bedding was drenched with water, I received no injury from having lain on it feveral hours. After exprefling my grateful acknowledgements to a hale conftitu- tion, I am induced to afcribe a great fhare of the prevention of ficknefs, on this as on other occalions to the frequent ufe of to bacco, which manifeftly pofiefles the property of defending the body againfl the impreflion of damps and cold or impure air, which, from the thick ranges of wood and hills, is tainted with noxious vapours, produces fevers of a malignant kind, and I am prompted to attribute the good health I enjoyed in thole parts, to the common habit of fmoking tobacco. Our party was greatly furprized at the receipt of this very un« feafonable mandate, as we had during the day, occupied one of the moft public places of the town, where moft of the principal people vifited Zulphucar Khan, fupplied him with provifions, and were apprized of his intention to depart in the evening. But it had been ifliied I believe by the governor of the town, in refentment of the khan’s not vifiting him ; and operated with a quick force, on the minds of all the men, and even the children of Iflaamabad, who, but the fhort day before, from treating us with a ftudied kind- nefs, would now pafs our quarters without a notice.

Zulphucar Khan informs me, that the chief of Kafhmire, though a youth, ftands in the foremoft rank of tyrants, and that the exactions of a Hindoo cuf- tom-houfe will be foon forgotten in the oppreffion of his govern ment. The one, he laid, affects a trifling portion of property, the other involves for une and life. Two or three days after our arrival at Iflaamabad, the Dewan, or principal officer of the governor of Kaflimire encamped in our vicinity, and being acqu nted with Zulphucar Khan, obtained permiflion for the procedure of our party to the city. It is here neceffary to obferve, that no perfon, except by ftealth, can enter or depart from Kaflimire without an order, marked with the feal of government. The Dewan, attracted I fuppofe by the appearance of fo white a perfon, made fome enquiry into the nature of my occu-s FORSTER’S TRAVELS. pation and views. I told the old ftory of a tuik travelling towards his country, with the addition, that to avoid the Sicque territory, I had taken the route of Kalhmire, where I hoped to experience the benefit of his proteftion. My ftory was favourably heard, and I received a very cordial affurance of every neceffary afliftance. Our party being directed to attend the Dewan, and to form a part of his domeftic fuite, we preceded by water, on the afternoon of the 3d of May, to Bhyteepour, nine cofles, a village fituate on the northern bank of the Jalum, the evening was ferene, and the variegated view of populous villages, interfperfed through a plain which was waving with a rich harveft, and enlivened by the notes of a thoufand birds, filled the mind with harmony and delight. In the vicinity of Bhyteepour are feen the remains of an Hindoo temple, which, though impaired by the ravages of time, and more by the deftruftive hand of the Mahometans, ftill bore evident marks of a fuperior tafte and fculpture. Kafhmire, having fallen a con- queft to the followers of Mahomet, at an early period of their empire in India, when they furioufly broke down every fence that barred the progrefs of their religion, felt the full force of a barbarous zeal; and its monuments of worfhip and tafte were thrown to the ground in fhapelefs piles of ruin. The Dewan taking Zulphucar Khan with him, went, on the 5th of the month into the interior part of the country, and directed me to wait for him at the town of Pamper, ten miles further down theFORSTER’S TRAVELS. 9 the river, where an order was fent for my accommodation. This perfon of the Hindoo feft, polTeffed a more liberal difpofition than is ufually found in an Indian : though perhaps I am fo much biaffed by his indulgent treatment, that my Opinion may be thought partial, but his deportment feemed uniformly bene volent to all clafles of people ; with his companions he was af fable and good humoured, he was humane to his domeftics, and he exercifed with a reafonable temperance the duties of his office. On the 7th, the Dewan came to Pamper, whence I went to the city, a diftance of feven coffes in his boat, which, though in Kafhmire was thought magnificent, would not have been dilgraced in the ftation of a kitchen tender to a Bengal badgero. The boats of Kafhmire are long and narrow, and are rowed with paddles: from the ftern, which is -a little elevated, to the centre, a tilt of mats is extended for the fhelter of paflengers or mer chandize. The country being interfecled with numerous ftreams, navigable for fmall veflels, great advantage and conveniency would anfe to it from the water conveyance, efpecially in its interior commerce, did not the miferable policy of the Afghan govern ment crufh the fpirit of the people. The city, which in the ancient annals of India was known by the name of Siringnaghur, but now by that of the province at large, extends about three miles on each fide of the river Jalum, over which are four or five wooden bridges, and occupies Voto IE g inJO FORSTER’S TRAVELS. in fome part of its breadth, which is irregular, about two miles. The houfes, many of them two and three ftories high, are flightly built of brick and mortar, with a large intermixture of timber. On a Handing roof of wood is laid a covering of fine earth, which fhelters the building from the great quantity of fnow that falls in the winter feafon. This fence communicates an equal warmth in winter, as a refrefhing coolnefs in the fum- mer feafon, when the tops of the houfes, which are planted with a variety of flowers, exhibit at a diftance the fpacious view of a beautifully checquered parterre. The ftreets are narrow, and choaked with the filth of the inhabitants, who are proverbially unclean. No buildings are feen in this city worthy of remark ^ though the Kafhmirians boaft much of a wooden mofque, called the Jumah Muffid,* eredled by one of the emperors of Hin T doflan 5 but its claim to diftindlion is very moderate. The fubahdar, or governor of Kafiimire, refides in a fortrefs called Shere Ghur, occupying the fouth-eaft quarter of the city, where moft of his officers and troops are alfo quartered. The benefits which this city enjoys of a mild falubrious air, a river flowing through its centre, of many large and commodious houfes, are effentially alloyed by its confined conftrudtion and the extreme filthinefs of the people.

The lake of Kafhmire, or in the provincial language, the Dali, long celebrated for its beauties, and the pleafure it affords to the inhabitants of this country, extends from the north-eaft quarter of the city, in an oval circumference of five or fix miles and joins the Jalum by a narrow channel, near the fuburbs. On the entrance to the eaftward is feen a detached hill, on which fome devout Mahometan has dedicated a temple to the great king Solomon, whofe memory in Kafhmire is held in profound veneration. The legends of the country affert, that Solomon vifited this valley, and finding it covered, exxept the eminence now men tioned with a noxious water, which had no outlet, he opened a paffage in the mountains, and gave to Kafhmire its beautiful plains. The Tacht Suliman, the name bellowed by the Maho metans on the hill, forms one fide of a grand portal to the lake, and on the other {lands a lower hill, which, in the Hinduee is called Hirney Purvet, or the green hill, a name probably adopted from its being covered with gardens and orchards.

In the centre of the plain, as it approaches the lake, one of the Dehli emperors, I believe Shah Jehan, conftrufted a fpacious garden, called the Shalimar, which is abundantly flored with fruit- i' trees and flowering fhrubs. Some of the rivulets which interfeft the plain, are led into a canal at the back of the garden, and flow ing through its centre, or occafionally thrown into a variety of water-works, compofe the chief beauty of the Shalimar. To decorate this fpot, the Mogul princes of India have difplayed an equal magnificence and tafle j efpecially Jehan Gheer, who, with the enchanting Noor Mahl, made Kafiimire his ufual refi- dence during the fummer months, and largely contributed to improve its natural advantages.

The canal of the Shalimar is Conflrufted of mafonry as far as the lower pavillion, from whence the ftream is conveyed through a bed of earth, in the centre of an avenue of fpreading trees, to the lake, which, with other ftreams of a lefler note, it fupplies and refrefhes. The other fides of the lake are occupied by gardens of an inferior defcription ; though two of them, the property of the government, deferve a diftinct notice for their fize and pleafant appearance $ the Baugh Nuffeem lying on the north-weft, and the Baugh Nifliat on the fouth-eaft quarter of the Shalimar. The numerous fmall iflands emerging from the lake, have alfo a happy effect in ornamenting the fcene.

Since the difmemberment of Kafhmire from the empire of Hindoftan, it has been fubjeft to the Afghans,* who poflefling neither the genius nor liberality of the Moguls, have fuffered its elegant ftru£tures to crumble into ruins, and to hold out againft them a fevere tefti- mony of the barbarity of their nation. Amir Khan, a Perfian, one of the late governors of Kafh mire, ere£ted a fortified palace on the eaftern fide of the lake 5 but the materials have been fo unfubftantial, that though of not more than eight years (landing, it cannot now with fafety be inhabited. He ufed to pafs much of his time in this retreat, which was cu- rioufly adapted to the enjoyment of the various fpecies of Afiatic luxury ; and he is ftili fpoken of in terms of affeftion and regret $ for, like them, he was gay, voluptuous, and much addifled to the pleafures of the table. There is not a boatman or his wife that does not fpeak of this Khan with rapture, and afcribe to him a once abundant livelihood.

A Kaflimirian mu ft have been grievoufly embarraffed to juftify his conduct when he afcribed it to any principle of religion ; for he is a Hindoo, a Mahometan, and would become a Chriftian if a prieft were at hand, according to the fajhion or intereft of the day. The environs of the town, to the eaft and weft, are laid out in private gardens, which, fkirting the banks of the Jalum, or fupplied with canals from the lake, afford a various retreat of pleafure to the inhabitants. The plane-tree, that fpecies termed the Platanus Orientalis, is commonly cultivated in Kafli- mire, where it is faid to arrive at a greater perfection than in other countries. This tree, which in moft parts of Afia is called the Chinaur, grows to the fize of an oak, and has a taper ftreight trunk, with a filver coloured bark; and its leaf, not unlike an expanded hand, is of a pale green. When in full foliage, it has a grand and beautiful appearance, and in the hot weather, it affords a refrefliing fhade. But I may ven ture to clafs in the firft rank of vegetable produce, the rofe of Kafhmire, which, for its brilliancy and delicate of odour, has long been proverbial in the eaft; and its effential oil or ottar is held in univerfal eftimation. The feafon, when the rofe firft opens into bloffom, is celebrated with ijiuch feftivity by thei6 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. the Kafhmirians, who refort in crowds to the adjacent gardens* and enter into fcenes of gaiety and pleafure, rarely known among other Afiatic nations. There, all that exterior gravity which conftitutes a grand part of the Mahometan chara&amp;er, is throw r n afide; and the Turk, Arab, and Perfian, as if fatigued with ex hibiting the ferious and guarded deportment of their own country, give a licentious fcope to their paffions. The valley of Kafhmire is of an elliptick form, and ex tends about ninety miles in a winding direction from the fouth- eaft to the north-weft. It widens gradually to Iflaamabad, where the breadth is about forty miles, which is continued with little va riation to the town of Sampre,* whence the mountains by a regular inclination to the weft ward, come to a point, and divide Kalhmire from the territory of Muzzufferabad. To the north and north- eaft, Kaftimire is bounded by what is here termed the mountains of Thibet $ a branch, I apprehend, of that immenfe range, which rifing near the black fea, penetrates through Armenia, and Ikirt- ing the fouth fhore of the Cafpian, extends through the north-eaft provinces of Perfia, to Thibet and China.

About eight miles to the weftward of the city, the Jalum is joined by a fmall river called the Chote, or little Scind, which I was informed by a Kafhmirian Pundit, arifes in the Thibet mountains, and is the only ftream not produced within the valley. Previoufly to the Mahometan conqueft of India, Kalhmire was ce lebrated for the learning of its Bramins and the magnificent con- ftrudlion of its temple. The period of its fubjedlion to the Ma hometans, is not recorded in any hiftory that I have feen, but we may believe, that a country, containing a valuable commerce and a profufion of natural beauties, would at an early date have at tracted their notice and invited their conqueft.

The valley of Kafhmire has generally a flat furface, and being copioufly watered, yields abundant crops of rice, which is the common food of the inhabitants. At the bale of the furrounding hills, where the land is higher, wheat, barley and various other grains are cultivated. A fuperior fpecies of faffron is alfo produced in this province, and iron of an excellent quality is found in the adjacent mountains. But the wealth and fame of Kafhmire have largely arifen from the manufacture of fhauls, which it holds un rivalled, and almoft without participation. The wool of the lhaul is not produced in the country, but brought from diftrifts of Thibet, lying at the diftance of a month's journey to the north- eaft. It is originally of a dark grey colour, and is bleached in. Kafhmire by the help of a certain preparation of rice flour.

A portion of the revenue of Kafhmire is tranfmitted to the Afghan capital in fliaul goods, which I had an opportunity of feeing previoufly to the difpatch, and from the information then received, I am reafonably confirmed in the accuracy of this ftate- ment I have given.

But the heavy oppreflions of the government, and the rapacious temper of the bordering Rates, who exercife an unremitting rapacity on the foreign traders, and often plunder whole cargoes, have reduced the commerce of Kafhmire to a de clining and languid Rate. In proof of this pofition, the Kafli- niirians fay, that during their fubjection to the Mogul dominion, the province contained forty thoufand lhaul looms, and that at this day, there are not fixteen thoufand. In KaRimire are feen merchants 'and commercial agents of moR of the principal cities of northern .

The city of Kafhmire once abounded with courtezans, equally gay and affluent; but the rigorous contributions of the Afghans have greatly reduced their number, and driven moft of thofe that remain into a languid poverty. The few that I faw, afforded me much pleafure by their graceful fldll in dancing, and voices pecu liarly melodious.

The language of Kafhmire evidently fplings from the San- fcrit flock, and refembles in found, that of the Mahrattas, though with more harfhnefs, which has probably induced the inhabitants to compofe their fongs in the Perfic, or adopt thofe of the Persian poets. Yet in defpite of the unpleafant tone of their fpeech, there is fcarcely a perfon in the country, from youth to old age, who has not a tafle for mufic.

None are more eager in the purfuit of wealthy have more inventive faculties in acquiring it, or who devife more modes of luxurious expenfe. When a Kafhmirian, even of the lowed: order, finds himfelf in the pofieffion of ten {hillings, he lofes no time in aflembling his party, and launching into the lake, folaces himfelf till the laft farthing is fpent. Nor can the defpotifm of an Afghan government, which loads them with a various op- prelfion and cruelty, eradicate this ftrong tendency to diflipation, yet their manners, it is faid, have undergone a manifeft change, fince the difmemberment of their country from Hindoftan. En couraged by the liberality and indulgence of the Moguls, they gave a loofe to their pleafures and the bent of their genius. They ap peared in gay apparel, conftrufted coftly buildings, and were much addifted to the pleafures of the table. The interefts of this pro vince were fo ftrongly favored at the court, that every complaint againft its governors was attentively liftened to, and any attempt to moleft the people, reftrained or punifhed. In the reign of Aurungzebe, when the revenue of the different portions of the empire exceeded that of the prefent day, the fum collected in Kaftimire amounted to three and a half lacks of rupees, but at this time, not lefs than twenty lacks are extracted by the Afghan governor, who, if his tribute be regularly remitted to court, is allowed to execute with impunity every a£t of violence. This extreme rigour has fenfibly affected the deportment and man-2 4 FORSTER'S TRAVELS. ners of the Kafhmirian?, who {brink with dread from the Afghan opprefiions, and are fearful of making any difplay of opulence. A Georgian merchants who had long refided in the count* y, gave me the moft fatisfacfory information of Kaihmire. He faid, that when he firft vifited the province, which was governed by a pexfon of a moderate difpofition, the people were licentious, volatile and profufe. But, that fince the admxniflration of the late chief, an Afghan of a fierce and rapacious temper, they had become difpi- rited, their way of living mean, their drefs flovenly, and though of a temper proverbially loquacious, they were averfe from com municating ordinary intelligence. During my refidence in Kafhmire, I often witneRed the harfli treatment which the common people received at the hands of their mailers, who rarely ifiued an order without a blow of the fide of their hatchet, a common weapon of the Afghans, and ufed by them in war, as a battle-axe, Though the inhabitants of this province are held under a grievous fubjeilion, and endure evils the moft mortifying to human nature, being equally oppreffed and inful ted, the various tefiimonies brought home to me of their common depravity of difpofition, made me the lefs fenfibie of their diftrefs; and in a fliort time fo faint was the trace of it on my mind, that I even judged them worthy of their adverfe fortune. In viewing the manners of a people at large, it were at once a facrifice of truth and every claim to hiftorical merit, to introduce pafllonateFORSTER’S TRAVELS. pafllonate or fanciful colouring; yet the cooleft refleflion does not withold me from faying, that I never knew a national body of men more impregnated with the principles of vice, than the natives of Kafhmire. T he charadfer of a Kafhmirian is confpicuoufly feen, when invefted with official power. Supported by an au thority which preferibes no limits to its agents, in the accumula tion of public emoluments, the Kafhmirian difplays the genuine compofition of his mind. He becomes intent on immediate ae- grandizement, without reje&amp;ing any inftrument which can promote his purpofe. Rapacious and arrogant, he evinces in all his aflions, deceit, treachery, and that fpecies of refined cruelty, which ufually actuates the conduft of a coward. And it is faid, that he is equally fickle in his connections, as implacable in enmity. In be half of humanity, I could with not to have been capacitated to exhibit fo difgufting a picture, which being conflantly held out to me for near three months, in various lights, but with little relief, imprefled me with a general dillike of mankind. The Kalhmirians are fo whimfically curious, that when any trivial queftion is propofed to them, its intention and purpofe is enquired into with a firing of futile interrogatories, before the necefiary information is given j and a fitop keeper rarely ac knowledges the pofleffion of a commodity, until he is apprized of the quantity required.

He will perceive that the lingular pofition of their country, its abun dant and valuable produce, with a happy climate, tend to excite ftrong inclinations to luxury and effeminate pleafures ; and h^ ia aware, that to counterafl caufes, naturally tending to enervate and corrupt the mind, a fyftem of religion or moiahty is neceffary to inculcate the love of virtue, and efpecially, to impiefs the youth with early fentiments of juftice and humanity. But he will evi dently fee, that neither the religious or the moral precepts of the prefent race of Mahometans contain the principles of reftitude or philanthropy; that on the contrary, they are taught to look with abhorrence on the faireft portion of x the globe, and to perfecute and injure thofe who are not inclofed in the fold of their prophet. Seeing then the Kafhmirians, prefiding as it were at the fountain head of pleafure, neither guided or checked by any principle or ex ample of virtue, he will not be furprized, that they give a wide fcope to the paffions of the mind and the enjoyments of the body.

Though the Kafhmirians ex claim with bitternefs at the adminiftration of Hadji Kareem Dad, who was notorious for his wanton cruelties and infatiable avarice; often for trivial offences, throwing the inhabitants, tyed by the back in pairs, into the river, plundering their property, and forcing their women of every defcription; yet they fay, he was a fyflema- tical tyrant, and attained his purpofes, however atrocious, through a fixed medium. They hold a different language in fpeaking of the fon, whom they denominate the Zaulim Kham, a Perfic phrafe which expreffes a tyrant without difcernment; and if the fmaller portion of the charges againif him are true, the appellation is fitly beftowed.

But his a£ls of ferocity exceed common belief; they would feem to originate in the wildeft caprice, and to difplay a temper rarely feen in the nature of man. That you may form fome fpecific knowledge of the character of this, let me call him, infernal defpot, I will mention fome fa£is which were communicated during my refidence in the province. While he was pafling with his court, under one of the wooden bridges of the city, on which a crovrd of people had affembled to obferve the proceffion, he levelled his mufquet at an opening which he faw in the path way, and being an expert markfman, he fhot to death an unfortunate fpe&amp;ator. Soon after his acceffion to the D a govern-mmm ■■■■■MB at FORSTER’S TRAVELS. government, he accufed his mother of infidelity to her hufband, and in defiance of the glaring abfurdity which appeared in the al legation, as well as the anxious intreaties of the woman who had borne him to fave her from fhame, fhe was ignominioufly driven from the palace; and about the fame time, on a like frivolous pretence, he put one of his wives to death. A film on one of his eyes had baffled the attempts of many operators, and being impa tient at the want of fuccefs, he told the laft furgeon who had been called in, that if the diforder was not remedied within a limited time, allowing but a few days, his belly fhould be cut open ; the man failed in the cure, and Azad Khan verified his threat. These paffages were related to me by different perfons, fome ft rangers in the country, others, who from the Rations they held, would rather have been induced to fpeak favourably. Azad Khan had, in the three firft months of his government, become an object of fuch terror to the Kafhmirians, that the cafual mention of his name produced an inftant horror and an involuntary fupplication of the aid of their prophet. Among the leffer order of his exaftions, but which feemed to me the moft unpopular and difcouraging, is that levied from the cour tezans or dancing girls, who are obliged to account for every fum of money they receive, and to pay the larger fhare of it to the intendant of the police; nor are they allowed to attend at any feftival or entertainment, without the permiffion of that officer.FORSTER'S TRAVELS. 29 officer* The rigorous treatment of this clafs of females, which are ever the moil: pleafing to fociety from the indulgence granted to them, has here effedted a grievous change $ for though Kafh- mire is known to abound in fine women, few are now feen among the courtezans.

Contenting himfelf with the tribute, he is feldom difpofed to controul the condudt of a re- mote governor. I am to exprefs a regret, that previoufly to my route, I had not perufed the accurate and candid memoirs of Mr. Bernier, who hands in the flrft rank of writers on Indian hiftory: yet, fhould this curfory relation throw any light on his defcription of Kafhmire, as lively as it is juft, by filling up a chafm, or mark ing the changes which have happened fince his day, I flrall hold it in fome eftimation, and confider any inconveniency which might have arifen from my journey thither, honorably requited. Mr. Bernier enjoyed advantages which have fallen to the lot of few Afiatic travellers, and fortunately for the learned world, his talents amply improved them. He travelled into Kaflimire in the fuite of Daniflrmund Khan, a favourite Omrah of Aurungzebe, who having a tafte for fcience and letters, encouraged this ingenious Frenchman to attentively inveftigate the great variety of its curious produce. He has alfo defcribed the caufes of that important re volution, which raifed Aurungzebe to the throne of Hindoftan. AsFORSTER’S TRAVELS, As he was perfonally engaged in the fcene of a£Hon, and an eye witnefs of many of the principal events, all which are related in a fimple interefdng language, I earneftly recommend to you a dili gent perufal of his inftrudlive and judicious book. This writer having chiefly aflbciated with Mahometans, who invariably poflefs an abfolute abhorrence of the religion of the Hindoos, and being deftitute of the proper documents for the refearch, he has not been equally fuccefsful in his explanation of the principles and fpirit of the Hindoo doctrines, and it is only in that difcuffion I prefume to doubt the opinions of Mr. Bernier. After clofing this differ tat ion on Kafhmire, you mull: permit me to relate my defultory adventures in that country. On my arrival at the city, I was accommodated with an apart ment in the houfe of Zulphucar Khan, and feeing him of fo re- fpedtable a charadter, and difpofed to do me kindnefs, I had re- folved to remain there, but my fervant, the fame perfon who had fet upon me at Jumbo, difcovered me to the family to whom he knew I had brought introdudtory letters, and being urgently prefled, not to fay peftered, to lodge at the houfe of a Sheich Mirza, the brother of my Jumbo hofl, I was forced out of the friendly roof of the Khan, whom I fhall ever remember with af~ fedfion and efteem. His father having filled high ftations in the upper part of India, at the period of the Afghan and Sicque inva- ■ . i fions, Zulphucar Khan, who was himfelf prefent at fome of the adUons, had acquired a converfant knowledge of the motives that adluated2 ,z s FORSTER’S TRAVELS.: actuated the different parties; and his remarks on the various events of thofe times, from which I derived much ufefui infor mation, denoted a found difcerning judgement, little heated by prejudice, or fettered by thofe narrow precepts which ufually fway the mind of a Mahometan. He ftridtly obferved the ceremonies of his religion, which were performed with an apparent convic tion of their rectitude ; and, though he daily faw my remiffion of the cuftomary worfhip of his family, he neither remarked or cenfured it. At Sheich Mirza’s, I was received with fplendid offers of frisndfhip, and all that farrago of proteftation, the common bur then of Afiatic language, which goes for nothing. The truth was, the brother at Jumbo had reprefented me as a wealthy merchant who would produce great profit to the houfe; and this objeft de luged me at the firft meeting with compliments, which com menced with embracing my legs, and ended in wafhing my beard in rofe water. Nor did he ceafe to load me with a feries of difgufting attentions, until I told him that my hufmefs obliged me to proceed, without delay, to Kabul. The arrival of a mer chant from Conftantinople compleated my relief; for then the Sheick had no leifure to fay a civil word to any one, and feeing indeed, that my refidence promifed no emolument to the houfe, he would without ceremony have turned me out of it, had another Turk appeared.

In a future converfation with the Georgian, he explained to me, and proved by comparifon, that the head of a Chriltian is broad behind and flatted out at the ciown; that a Mahometan’s head grows narrow at the top, and like a monkies has a conic form. This Georgian was aflbciated in trade with one of his countrymen then refiding at Benates, and feeing that he viewed me with miftruft, the com munication of which muft have had mifchievous eflefts, I judged it prudent to difclofe my true ftory ; premifing, with an aflurance, that fliould treachery or his indifcretion bring on me any mifchance, his efiate at Benares would become forfeit, and the perfon of his companion expofed to punifhment.

The Dewan, whom I daily attended, ftill continued his former kindnefs, and agreeably to his promife, folicited for me the governor’s permiffion to leave the province. The memorial prefented by the Dewan, fet forth, that a Turk who had come from Hindoftan, was defirous of pairing, with two domeftics, through Kaihmire, in his way to Conftantinople. When this purport was made known to me, I ftrongly feared its failure j for flxangers rarely vifit Kaihmire for the purpofe of curiofity or amufement, and as no fpecific occupation was afcribed to me, I obferved to the Dewan that a refufal might be expected. The apprehenfion was wholly verified in Azad Khan’s faying, that the Turks were good foldiers, which he then wanted, and that he would employ me in his army. It was in vain the Dewan reprefented the folicitude of vifiting my country, whence I had been long abfent, and that little benefit would accrue from the fervices of a perfon under fuch conftraint. He for bade the Hindoo, in a voice that made him tremble, to ceafe from urging the requeit, for he had formed an ultimate refo- lution. When the Dewan intimated to me the information, I no ticed an evident agitation in his countenance; and though you may fuppofe that my mind was ill at eafe, I forced upon mylelf thatFORSTER’S TRAVELS, 35 that fpecies of refignation which is habitual to an Afiatic in his day of trouble, and gravely affefted to adminifter a comfort to the Dewan, which was more wanting to myfelf. From that moment, I never faw him,* nor did I ever impart to any one the ftory of my failure, well knowing, that had it become public, no one would have dared to have given me affiftance or even {belter. On revolving the different modes of extrication from this dilema, I bethought myfelf of the Banker, on whom I had brought a draft from Jumbo ; and in the courfe of a day or two I applied to him for a paffport. He very frankly affured me of his fervices, from which, as he was at that time high in the eftimation of the governor, I entertained fanguine hopes of fuccefs, and to obviate the rifque that might arife from the name of Khuroe, which had been inserted in the former me morial, I now took that of Eufuff, a Mahometan merchant, going on a commercial adventure to Pefliour.

The obftacles that flood in the way of my departure, now became ferious, and gave ame much anxiety. I was thrown into the power of a capricious tyrant, under a femblance alfo, which if difcovered, might be fatal, and I was precluded by the late occurrence, from a perfonal application to the court. Endeavouring to remove the appearance of chagrin, I intreated the Georgian, who has been mentioned, to expedite my departure, though without communicating any part of the former failures. •Only obferving that the multiplicity of bufmefs, neceffarily engroffing the attention of the dewan, of whofe friendfhip for me he had been apprifed prevented me from giving him further trouble.

After a halt of three hours*, which were chiefly employed in repairing the riding tackle, which was all of cordage, bridle, ftirrups and girth, I proceeded in com pany with Mohubullah, the proprietor of the fteed, and Hu film, the Perfian boy, to the finall village of Markore, a ftage of ten cofleSo Mohubullah made a good travelling pillaw, of which the hones were picked, and pluming myfelf on having outwitted the governor of Kaflimire, I went to fleep in an adjacent mofque with a light heart.

The night being cool, I had thrown over my bed-cloths a coat, in the pocket of which was depofited the paflport; when, in an evil hour, juft as I was beginning to awake, a thief fnatched my coat, and made his efcape. Had the coat been of any other colour than red, it would 'not, 1 believe, have attracted the marauder’s notice; but a fpark of vanity, many of which have lighted me into fcenes of trouble, prompted the purchafe of this gaudy garment, which before had been3 g FORSTER’S TRAVELS. been often flared at.

The limit of Kafhmire on this quarter is terminated by a low thick wood, the edge of which is fkirted by a rivulet, and, on the other fide rifes a lofty chain of mountains, firetching to the north and fouth, whofe fum- mits are in fome parts, now, covered with fnow, a deep tract of which I croffed. The inhabitants of the Muzzufferabad diftridts, de nominated Bom bans, are Mahometans of the Afghan tribe and inimical to the Kalhmirians, who. under the father of the pre- fent governor, had laid their territory wafte.

The mountain being in fome places fo fteep, that projedling beams are fixed,, into its fide, to fupport a path of planks, for the accommodation of foot pafiengers ; horfes are Lent by another traft. This path hath been lately repaired, out of the favings of charity, by a Mahometan mendicant, who had, alfo, in a recefs of the hill, erefted a fmall building for the refrefhment of travellers. It being one of thefe few a6ts of public benefit, within the compafs of my knowledge, performed, by this clafs of men, I deem the communication a matter of confcience; for, too frequent occafions of reprobating them have already offered.

On the 18th, halted at a mofque, on the weftern fade of Kifhen x Gunga. On the 19th, thekafilah proceeded a cofs inland from the river. The heat of the weather during the day, and the remains of a ficknefs had fo enervated me, that I could not walk a few paces, without extreme pain and laffitude. But, my little wants were, readily, fupplied by Mohubullah, who procured good provifaons, cooked them, and was my pipe bearer. On the 20th, at Dunnee, three coffes, a fmall village, on the eaftern bank of die Nhah, a narrow rapid river, which falls into die Kiffien Gunga. The kafilah remained at this place, until the inhabitants had conftruaed a bridge, which confided of two entire beams, at the diftance of three feet afunder, with an interftice of planks, faftened by cordage. The performance of this work, a very Vol. XL p tediousFORSTER’S TRAVELS. tedious one, was chiefly expedited by Sultan Mahmoud, in perfon who, though an old man, fhewed a perfevering aaivity with a great fiiare of good temper. The materials of the bridge, which had been floated from fome diftance, having, by the force of the cur rent, been carried below the proper ftation, we were detained at Dunnee for another fupply of wood, until the 28th, when we moved three coffes, and halted in an uninhabited valley. On the 29th, on the fummit of a mountain, ten cofles, in the diftridls of Jiddoon, governed by a Patan chief. In a fleep pait of this hill, where the path, from fome rain that had fallen, was flippery, my horfe ftumbled; and had not a tree been within reach, a branch of which I caught, I muft have been thrown down a lofty declivity. This night I experienced fome of thofe incon- veniencies to which travellers of my defeription are occafiona fubjedt. My baggage was thoroughly foaked by the rain ; and water, which had already fo much annoyed me, was not to be found, nor a flick of fuel. Thefe embarraiiments, which made me tefty and much difpofed to quarrel with my neighbours, were at length obviated by the adfive fervices of Mohubullah, wno having brought water and fuel from a long diftance, prepared a mefs of broth from fome mutton in our ftore, which afforded a regale to a very hungry party. The Jiddoon road being difficult of acceis, is little frequented, and, until the paflage of our kafllah, had never, I was informed, been ufed by merchants.

Halted at this place for the adjufting the payment of duties, and of an efcort, that had accompanied our progrefs through the country, until the the 4th of July, when we proceeded to Kotillee, a fort in the pof- feflion of Meimoun Khan, a brother and vaffal of the chief of Ja- noul. Halted on the 5th, to compofe a difference of opinion, that had arifen among the merchants, refpe&amp;ing the choice of a road.

Being told that the merchants would be detained fome days at this place, for the difcharge of cuftoms, and thence proceed to the town of Beer, the refidence of Gul Shere, where as at many other flations, a long delay would be occafioned, I propofed to Mohubullah the profecution of our journey by a nearer route. He gave a ready affent to the meafure, affuring me alfo, that his knowledge of the country and many of the principal people promifed very reafonable fuccefs; but he required, as the firft condition^ an implicit obedience to all his directions, and a % F 2 reftraint44 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. reftraint on that impatience of temper, with which he was forry to obferve I was too much aftuated. On the 7th we left the Serauce, and conduced by a guide through an unfrequented path, we paffed without moleftation the Tyrrhene diflridts, where moft danger was apprehended, and halted, during the heat of the day, at a fmall fortified village. In the evening, after various alarms, we arrived at the fort of Kote, nine cofles, which, with an adjacent diftri6I, is held by a Nujjeeb Khan. It is to be noticed, that Enayet Serau ftands on the weft fide of a break of that great range of moun tains, extending along the head of the Punjab, and within which I had travelled, with little variation, from the Ganges to that place, whence I entered the plain country. On the 8th,, at Mourree, five coffes, a fmall village, depend ing on the Harbarry territory, which is governed by a power- full Afghan chief.

But thefe pleafing thoughts were wholly difpelled by the intelligence of a paflenger, who told us, that when he left Kote, a body of horfemen were preparing to fol low and plunder us.

On receiving this favorable in telligence, I went to the held to return thanks for this opportune afliftance, and found him ftretched on a bed amidft a grove of fhady trees, and furrounded with boys, fome fanning him, while others were gently rubbing his body. Though his manners evi dently difplayed that fuperiority which the fuppofed defendants of Mahomet ufually affume from their lineage and rank, he was not wanting in a polite civility; nor did he refufe fome fmall offerings, that were prefented to him with much refpe£t. The authority of this man was fo implicitly admitted, that we were efcorted in fafety by a Angle domeftic, whofe fervices were liberally rewarded.

It is a fevere reflexion on humanity, fays Bruyere, that the difpoAtion of man is ever the moft effectually meliorated in the hour of calamity. At Mourree we received intelligence, that a Pefliour kaAlah, had a few hours before departed on its way home, which gave us great joy, efpecially to Mohubullah, who now faw the near profpefl of a concluAon to the perilous talk he had under taken. OnFORSTER’S TRAVELS. On the morning of the 9th, before day light, we left Mourree, and after travelling fome hours through a wild and gloomy tra£V, on which the turn of my mind, threw perhaps, an additional fhade, and encountering many ill-looking fellows, who viewed us with a keen eye, we joined the Pefhour party, where we ex perienced from the countrymen of Mohubullah, every token of welcome. At noon arrived at Hyder B unghee, nine coffes, a populous village dependant on Attock, the principal town of a fmall dif- trift, which acknowledges the fupremacy of Timur Shah. The chief, an Afghan, yields an obedience conformable to the motions of that prince, or the leading motives of the day ; but, when def- % titute of other refource, he furnifhes a tribute of about fifty thou- fand rupees.

In our boat were embarked feventy perfons, with much merchandize and fome horfes. This unweildy lading, the high fwell of the current,,and the confufion of the frightened paffengers made the paifage dangerous and very tedious. The Indus forms a ftrong barrier to Hindoftan on the weft, and it feems a manifeft truth, that had the Indians made their giand ftand on the banks of this river, at the period of the Tartar, Afghan, and Perfian invafions, their empire might have made a powerful refiftance. Armies at all times have fuftained difficulties and damage in croffing the Indus, but the attempt to force its paffage mull be arduous and full of danger. The road from Muzzufferabad, tending to the fouth-weft, led me through the mountains, into the upper part of the Punjab, at Nheamut Serau ; from which place to Kote, are feen fome fcattered hills; but thence, the country is plain and thinly wooded.

I arrived at Akorah about noon ; when, immediately entering a fpacious cool mofque, I fpread my bed, and lay down much at my eafe.

On the 14th, at Pefhour, four coffes, a large, populous and opulent city, governed, with the dependant diftricts, by an Af ghan officer, who remits to the capital a revenue of feven lacks of rupees. The road from the Indus to Pefhour, has nearly a weft and by fouth direction; and the country to Akora is fandy and interfperfed with ftones; from thence to Pefhour, are feen many trafts of cultivation. The city of Pefhour was founded by the great Acbar, who feeing, it is faid, the Afghans averfe from dwelling in towns and the occupations of commerce, encouraged the inhabitants of the Punjab, Mahometans, and Hindoos, to refort to his new fettlement, where their defcendants have greatly multi plied. From its well chofen pofition, which unites, by a commer cial chain, Perfia and Afghaniftan with India, Pefhour has become an important mart, and the refidence of wealthy merchants; efpe- cially of the fhaul dealers, many of whom difliking the dangerous and tedious route of Kafhmire, are here enabled to make their purchafes at a moderate advance on the firft coft. I found a fmall fociety of Jews at Pefhour, living at their eafe, and in the - enjoyment of an unreferved protection. The heat of Pefhour feerned to me more intenfe, than that of any country I have vifited in the upper parts of India.

The apprehenfion of the evident difficulties which would attend my want of money, in a country where the moft fanguine hope could promife no affiltance, and the neceffity of mixing in focieties, void of every good or rational principle, occafionally operated in depreffing my fpirits. But the defire which had originally impelled the journey, and the zeal which had hitherto maintained its purfuit, at length difiipated thefe G 2 gloomyFORSTER’S TRAVELS. gloomy impreflions, and in gay colours, defcribed a various fcene of future pleafure. Being informed that a kafilah was immediately proceeding to Kabul, I hired a mule, and went to the adjacent village of Tackal, the ufual rendezvous of travellers, going to the weftward. On my arrival there, I learned, that the great kafilah ftill con tinued at Pefhour, and that only fome horfemen confiding in their fpeed and arms, had moved early in the morning towards Kabul* A reflexion on the predicament in which I then flood, the flow pace of my mule, which had more the appearance of an afs, and the reprefentation of the muleteer, whofe fears prompted innu merable falfities, flackened my flrong inclination to efcape from the heats of Pefhour, and after making a fruitlefs attempt to over take the horfemen, I returned to my lodging in the mofque. Sauntering one day in the bazar, the common refort of idle, as well as bufy people, I faw a perfon, with whom I had travelled from Muzzufferabad to Enayet Serau. We agreed, as our road was the fame, to travel together, and in the mean time to fhare the fame fare. So cordial is the pleafure refulting from fociety, fo naturally do we cling on each other, whether for fupport or amufement, that I immediately looked on this man as an approved friend, and felt a confidence from the connexion, which fet my mind at perfeft eafe.

Fully apprized of the danger, as well as inconveniency of difclofing the amount of my property,. I gravely told Noor Mahomed, that I had then no more than three rupees, which, with his (ingle one, (hould be placed in a joint fund, and that on it and providence, we muft truft until our ar rival at the capital. The Mahometan, with a countenance bright ening with faith and zeal, exhorted me to be of good cheer j for that true believers were never deferted in the hour of need. On the 25th of July, accompanying a large kahlah, in which a portion of the Kaihmire tribute, invefted in (hauls, was con veyed, we proceeded to the village of Tackal, three coffes, where we laid in a provifion for three days journey, the enfuing trad of country, for that diftance, being thinly inhabited. On the 26th, at Timrood, four coffes, a fortified fmall vil lage, fituate on the fouth fide of a range of rocky mountains, which reflected a fcorching heat on the plain beneath. The inha bitants of this village, genuine Afghans, have little refpect, though refiding fo near Pelhour, for either the perfon of Timur Shah, or his government, which was in fome degree evinced during our halt. The governor of Kaflimire had fent with our kafilah, for the ufe of the prince, four large dogs of Thibet, which were car ried in litters, and attended with much care. The keepers had led.54 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. led them to drink at a pond, where an Afghan woman was, filling her pitcher, but, on feeing thefe animals, which the Maho metans hold unclean, fhe put it down and by a fhower of ftones and abufe drove the whole party from the place, loudly calling at the fame time, on the villagers to her affiftance, which fhe little needed. The Afghans immediately affembled and compleated the route of the dogs and their keepers, beftowing on the Shah, alfo, very contemptuous language, nor were they fuffered to return to the pond, until efcorted by the kafilah guard. On the 27th, at Dickah, eighteen coffes, a fmall village, {land ing on the fouthern bank of the Kabul or Attock river, which here runs to the right, or eaftward. At the diftance of about two miles from Timrood, we entered a narrow defile, which interfedls the chain of mountains, lying to the north of the village. At the entrance of the pafs, the Afghans flopped the kafilah, and, excep ting fome troops of the Shah, levied a fmall contribution on all the paflengers; they receive, alfo, an annual fum from the govern ment of Pefhour, for permitting travellers to pafs unmolefled through their diftrict. In the firfl part of this day’s journey, fraught thoughout, with danger and fatigue, the rain which fell in torrents, nearly deftroyed my papers, and compleated the obliteration of the bill, now deflitute of mark or token; and I judged it as formally cancelled, as if a receipt had been palled for the amount. Towards the clofe of the day, I was entangled, by my own indifcretion, in a perilous adventure, the iffue of which, muff be, wholly afcribed toFORSTER’S TRAVELS. 55 to good fortune. When the rain had ceafed, the heat of the fun was extreme, and neither fhelter or water was to be procured. Anxious to efcape from thefe inconveniencies, for the journey was yet long, and the kafilah proceeded at a flow rate, about thirty of us, mounted, and the greater part well armed, refolved to leave the efcort. Had I derived the ufes which men ufually do from experience, and reflected but a little on thofe refulting, efpecially in my fituation, from xhzfejlina lente, I Ihould not have joined this Quixote detachment. We had advanced about four miles, when a fmall body of Afghans, which had ifiued from the hills and flop ped us, peremptorily demanded a fum of money, as a toll for palling through their territory. Here I feel myfelf fenfibly hum bled, when, as a faithful narrator, I am obliged to fay, that our corps behaved in a moft pufillanimous manner and facriflced with out fair caufe, the evident advantage which a common exertion of fpirit would have given. We were about thirty, ftrong, and, to the fight, refolute good looking fellows; all armed, except myfelf, with matchlocks or fide arms. On the enemies approach, our leader, a portly man with a large beard and fpreading muftachios, mounted on a curvetting fteed, was ftruck with a violent terror, which was inftantly communicated to the party. The moun taineers failed not to augment the confternation, and, without ce remony, proceeded to the ufual modes of plunder: But, fearful of the arrival of the kafilah, they were prevented from a total capture.

He did not, however defiff, but by an aftive perfeverance, fupported by a fmall fum of money, he accompliflied his purpofe. At the clofe of this affair, I had mounted my mule and was rejoicing at the efcape, when I received a fmart blow on my back 5 and turning about, an Afghan, who had taken this mode of attracting my notice, told me, with an ex ulting laugh, that our party might now move on, as the kafilah was in fight, but directed us, if the fafety of our lives was regar ded, not to join it until it fhould have pafled the place of aftion. This injunction was fpeedily obeyed by me and fome others; but our doughty commander, feeing the near profpeCt of relief, began to utter many bold words, and fliew a difpofition of recovering his property and honor by an affault of the Afghans ; who roufed at the menace, though the kafilah was clofe at hand, drew their daggersFORSTER’S TRAVELS. g7 daggers and advanced their fhields, daring him to battle and to fight for what he had loft. The cautious officer, again, qualified his wrath ; but he reprobated them in very Ipinfced language, and denounced a fevere vengeance on fome fitter occafion. In the lat ter part of the journey, an Hindoo, who had gone about a quarter of a mile from the party, was plundered of property to the amount of four hundred rupees, by a fmall body of thefe robbers who had made a fudden defcent from the hills, and before affiftance could be given, fecured the booty.

The ftage from Timrood to Dickah, ufually called the Hyber-pafs, being the only one in which much danger is to be apprehended from banditti, the officer of the efcort gave orders to his party to quit the kafilah, and march early on the next morning. This opportunity, at once offering fafety and expedition, was not to be foregone; yet, the muleteer was with great difficulty perfuaded to embrace it, and but for the in terference of Noor Mahomed, who was obliged to beat him into compliance, I mu ft have attended the tedious progrefs of the ka filah.

The Vol. II, H lawlefsFORSTER’S TRAVELS. 5% iawlefs condu£t of this fe£l of Afghans, who are known in this country by the name of Hybers, originates chiefly in the imbe cility of Timur Shah’s government, and his want of military fpirit. They are ftrongly aided alfo in the purfuit of a free- booting life, by the fituation of their country, which forms a chain of rocky mountains, whofe fcanty flips of valley afford but the coarfeft provifion for human wants. This rude race of men have made fo flow a progrefs in civilization, that the greateft part of them, like the floried Troglodites of old, dwell in caves, or rather in the fiffures of rocks. Though profeffing the Mahometan religion, they are little more verfed in it than believing Mahomet to be their prophet, that he had four dif- tinguifhed friends, and that the Perfians, with the whole fe6t of Ali,. are a mifcreant race of infidels. The Hyber dialedl is founded on the common language of the Afghans, but harfhly guttural, and is ill underftood by the adjacent tribes. Timur Shah, who ufed formerly to pals the winter at Pefliour, which is there much milder than at Kabul, never pafied through the territory of the Hybers, without their attacking his advanced or rear guard. An Armenian, with whom I was acquainted in travelling from Moultan towards Kabul, arrived at Pefliour,, where taking alarm at the perils of the Hyber-pafs, he re turned to Moultan, a journey of three weeks, thence he proceeded to Kundahar, a month’s journey, from which place it is a diftance ®f fifteen days to Kabul making in all, a paflage of nine weeks* whichFORSTER’S TRAVELS, which is ufually performed by the Hyber&gt;track in eleven days. This fa6l 5 at the fame time that it marks the caution and patience of an Armenian, explains the dread entertained of the Hybers. On the 28th, before day break, having joined the party that had efcorted the kafilah, we left Dickah, and, at the diftance of feven coffes, halted near the village of Biffouly, to dry our bag gage, which had been expofed all the morning to a heavy rain* In moving again, we experienced many obftacles from the ex treme darknefs of the night, and the numerous currents of water, which fuddenly produced by the rains, poured from the hills with extreme impetuofity; carrying with them ftones of a vaft fize, whofe rolling noife refembled thunder. It was mid night, the Iky was overcaft with black clouds, and the roaring of the torrents heard on all fides, created in my mind a certain horror mingled with awe, and I was involuntarily led to con- lider this grand fccne of nature with fentiments of profound reverence. On approaching a rivulet, which had been greatly enlarged by the rain, our chief difpatched firft, that fhe might not be incom moded by the crowd, one of his favourite women, who, though mounted on a ftrong horfe, had no fooner entered the ftream, than fhe was fwept away by its force and drowned. This event occa- fioned an immediate halt, and very fenfibly afHidted our leader, who threw hlmfelf on the ground, and loudly lamented the fate of his miftrefs.

On the 2d of Auguft we commenced our journey, that day a long one, at three o'clock in the morning, and in afeend- ing a high fteep hill, which forms one lide of the valley of Baracow, the tackle of my mule broke 5 when I, the animal and baggage, rolled rapidly to the bottom. In my way down, I roared out with vehemence for affiftance, but every perfon being engaged in more interefting bufmefs, no notice was taken of my clamours. My fituation would have been very comfortlefs, had I not perceived Noor Mahomed palling clofe by me, whofe help I earneftly intreated. After a long helitation, and a hearty curfe which I bore with patience, he confented to flay, and having affifted in colledling my fcattered garments, and repairing the mule’s tackle, we proceeded together. During a fmart debate, in which his illiberal condudt and my ill luck were keenly reprobated, it was found that we had flrayed from the path. But the effedts of a mutual fear, foon abforbed the late grievance, and united our exertions in difeovering the right path, which was found after much groping. Crossing a range of rocky hills, which extends with little intervention of valley for the fpace of about eight miles, we entered a wideFORSTER’S TRAVELS. a wide plain well watered and interfperfed with walled villages. The Kabul river runs through this plain, over which, at the dif- tance of four or five miles to the fouthward of the city, is a bridge * built of bricks. On our approach to the capital, an a£tive fcene of perfonal decoration took place, yet in a fafhion very dif ferent from that of the beaus of Europe. Inftead of powdering and curling the hair of the head, a Mahometan is there clofe fhorn, and fo far from thinking that beauty is imparted by a fmooth chin, he me a fines the comelinefs of his countenance, even the extent of honour, by the length and breadth of his beard.-J- It Is no uncommon oath in this country to fwear by the beard; and to call a man bud reijh, or bad beard, is held a bitter reproach, but petit maitres are not wanting among the Mahometans, efpecially in the exhibition of the beard; and though they do not apply to it marechale powder or pomade divine, it is clipped into fome fa vourite fhape with much nicety, and fhould the natural hue be not liked, it is fiained with a fiiining black colour,J which lafts a long time.

He obferved with much indifference, that the road was an improper place for the adjuftment of accounts, and that he would take fome future occafion for the purpofe. In the evening I arrived at Kabul, fifteen coffes, the capital of the Afghan empire ; and, after a long fearch, found a Georgian, for whom I had brought a letter of introdu£tion, from his coun tryman at Kafhmire y having read the letter, he made me an offer of half his appartment, and fuch affiftance as a ftranger might need. This acceptable tender was embraced with little circum locution, and I was immediately received into a mefs, which then confifted of Bagdafir the Georgian, and the Armenian whom I mentioned to have made the circuitous route from Pe- fhour to Kabul. My hoft refided in a karavanfera, once paid by foreign traders, and had paffed twenty years of his life at Kabul.

The truth of this reafoning was on the next day fully proved, for not a merchant of the city, and all were applied to, would even attempt to decypher the paper, when he underftood it contained / /FORSTER’S TRAVELS. % contained an order of payment. This event fenfibly affedted my future progrefs, and I feared would detain me at Kabul until clearer credentials were obtained. Another occurrence be fell me at this time, of a much more trivial nature; but as it ferves to pourtray perhaps a national character, may deferve a notice. The muleteer, who had accompanied me from Pefiiour, charged me with having given him a counterfeit rupee on the road, and now required its exchange. He had before made known to me his fufpicion of this piece of money, which one of the paflengers had given him, and had folicited my inter ference for redrefs. When I recounted this fa£t, reprobating alfo the fhamelefs fraudulency of the attempt, the boy, for he was not more than fixteen years of age, daringly told me to fpare my words and^ pay the money, or he would prefer a double complaint againft me, and make oath to the kazzi, that none of the mule-hire had been paid 5 though himfelf had witneffed the advance of half the hire at Pefho.ur. His youthful appearance, and fo intrepid a declaration, united in ftriking me with horror, and I inftantly put my hand to my purfe to prevent his purpofe, when Bagdafir, who had heard our difcourfe, infilled that no money fhould be paid without an order from the judge. They went to that officer’s court, where the muleteer, without a wince, made oath to the truth of his demand, winch was forthwith paid Vol, II, ' I by66 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. by Bagdafir, who returned croffing himfelf, and congratulated my eafy efcape from the clutches of a young incarnate devil By Beeping in the open air I imagine, and on nitrous ground, a fever, accompanied with an ague, feized me a few days after my arrival at Kabul, the effedts of which were Angularly violent,. The fever, during its continuance, caufed a delirious ftupefactjon, and created an infatiable thirfl, which frequently relieving by draughts of extremely cold water, it feemed at once to gufh from every pore, and drenched me in profufe perfpiration. When the fit of ague commenced, my bed-cloths, with thole of Bagdafir, and all the horfe-covering that could be procured, were heaped on me, but to little purpofe ; for I lay in the Rate of the damned, if fuch can be formed by human idea, until the paroxyfm had wreaked its vengeance. My body was filled with fpots of a very bright colour, lhaded between purple and crimfon, which I Ihould have beheld with pleafure, thinking that fuch eruption would diminilli the difeafe, had not an Armenian pronounced them a fymptom of the plague. This opinion gave a common alarm; and though no alteration appeared in the condudt of Bagdafir, it operated ftrongly on the fears of my neighbours, and they were difpofed to exclude me from their quarter, when I confidently afferted that the fever of the plague always produced its crifis in three days. Seeing that I had endured feven, and preferved a brifk flow of fpirits, their apprehenfion was much allayed, and the fcheme of banilhment fet afide. Bndea-FORSTER’S TRAVELS. 67 Endeavouring one day to look through the tube of my to bacco-pipe with my right eye, the left being clofed, I perceived it to be wholly without fight. This was a mortifying event, and that my ills might be more grievous, I was afflifted with a fpitting of blood. Bagdafir now called in a doftor of phyfic, who after pronouncing me in a deplorable Rate, and that little fnort of a miracle could fave me, undertook the cure, through the medium of fome medicine only known, he faid, to himfelf, and which had never failed of fuccefs. Entertaining from the difcourfe of my phyfician, but a flender opinion of his ability, I ufed, under dif ferent pretences, to fend Bagdafir out of the room, and difpofed of the medicine where no injury could be done. The diforder having diredled its full force againft me for the fpace of twenty days, began, as if wearied with the exertion, to abate, and in a ihort time it wholly ceafed, but my frame was fo fhattered and my nerves fo much relaxed, that I could fcarcely crawl about, and the lead: noife produced a violent tremor. In the courfe of my illnefs I was vifited by many of the Armenians, and one of them, a zea lous devotee, defired me to fvvallow fome fmall rolls of paper, on which were written certain myfterious words, infallible, he faid, in their effects, upon the bodies of pious chriftians. I expressed my thanks to this dealer in fpells, and readily agreed to take his dofe, fhould Bagdafir who was my abfolute di rector, give affent. On an inveftigation into their virtue, he per mitted me, though with reluctance, for he abhorred the Armenian I 2 fedt.mm 6 g FORSTER'S TRAVELS* fe£t ? to eat them, at the fame time exprefsing ftrong doubts of theif efficacy. But whether from not being a member of the orthodox faith, as the Armenian urged, or according to the Georgian, from the heretical preparation of the charm, I received no benefit, in deed 1 grew daily worfe, as the fickneft was then in its progreffive ilage. Observing on my arrival at Kabul, a common toleration of religion; that Chriftians, Hindoos and Jews, openly profeffed their creed, and purfued their occupations without moleftation; and aware alfo that the Mahometan charadler would deprive me of the advantage of Bagdafir’s connexion, I had informed him that I was a native of Europe, returning from India into my own country. At firft I defigned to take the name of a French man, but the wandering temper of that people, who Array into every corner of the earth, made me,fear detection; and had I been hardy enough to become an Englifhman, one of thofe who have abforbed the Mahometan power in India, and in this country have obtained a fuperior military reputation, I fhould perhaps at this day, have been a bombadier in the corps of Timur Shah’s artillery. To avoid thefe rifques, I denominated myfelf a Spaniard. It was with much fatisfaftion I faw the road from Kabul to Perfia open, and a fair profpeft of performing the journey into Europe, by the route which I had originally propofed. Two Ar menian travellers, who had gone by fea* from Aftracan to Ure Gunje, a Tartar Ration on one of the rivers at the head of the Cafpiam,FORSTER’S TRAVELS. 69 Cafpian, and thence to Kabul, by the road of Bochara and Balk, were earned: in perfuading me to purfue their tract as the fiiorteft and mod free from danger. Yet in this fcheme were fome effen- tial defects. The Perfian language, on which was founded my chief fupport, would in this route render me little ufe, I learned alfo that the winter of Bochara was fevere and long, that the Ure Gunje river, continued frozen until the month of March, and that no Ruffian vedel came there before May; though a journey from Kabul to the northern diore of the Cafpian, by the way of Tar tary, might be performed in two months and a half, yet by winding at Bochara, and the eventual delays of procuring a paffage by fea, it did not feem probable that I diould reach Adracan before the enfuing June. This reafon, with the dif- like of vifiting a country now barren of events or of any grand object of curiofity, determined me to enter Perfia, where a knowledge of the language would affid in extending refearch, as well as combat with more probable fuccefs, the difficulties incident to my fituation. Having too fully, I fear, expatiated on perfonal concerns, I will now purfue the more ufeful tendency of this letter, and inform you that Kabul, the reddence of Timur Shah and the capital of his dominion, is a walled city of about a mile and a half in circumference, and fituated on the eadern fide of a range of two united hills, defcribing generally the figure of a femicircle. The fortification, which is of a iimple condruction, with'7° FORSTER’S TRAVELS. with fcarcely a ditch, and the houfes built of rough ftone$ ? clay, and unturned bricks, exhibit a mean appearance, and are ill fuited to the grandeur which I expected to fee in the capital of a great empire. But the Afghans are a rude unlettered people, and their chiefs have little propenfity to the refinements of life, which indeed their country is ill qualified to gratify. From the Indus to the weftern limit of this extenfive ter ritory, there is an invariable deficiency of wood 5 infomuch, that the lower clafs of people in the northern quarter, fuffer as much, perhaps from a want of fuel in the winter feafon, as thofe of other countries would do from a fcarcity of pro- vifions. Balau Sir, the name of the Shah’s palace, where alfo the houfhold fervants, guards, and the flaves are lodged, ftands on a rifing ground in the eaftern quarter of the city, and exhibits but a (lender teftimony of the dignity of its mafter. Having no ticed what has not been done to decorate Kabul, I muft not omit to mention the works of Ali Murdan Khan. This omrah, who held an eminent Ration in the fervice of Jehanguir, eredted, nearly in the centre of the city, four fpacious bazaars, or market places in a line, which confifl: of a range of apartments on each fide of two floors, the lower appropriated to merchants, and that above to private ufe. The intermediate fpace between the ranges, is covered by an arched roof, and each bazaar is feparated by an open fquare, which was fupplied with foun tains.FORSTER’S TRAVELS. 71 tains, but now choaked with filth or occupied by the meaneft order of mechanics. Ali Murdan has left behind him many monuments of liberality and tafte ; the grandeft, though now in ruins, is feen * in the vicinity of Dehli, and difplays at once a defign, ufeful and f magnificent. During the fplendid sera of Dehli, when it covered accord ing to popular tradition, a fpace of twenty miles, the inhabi tants who refided at a diftance from the Jumna, which fkirted only one of its angles, experienced much difficulty in procuring river water, that of the wells not being efteemed fo falubrious. Ali Murdan, defirous of relieving this common grievance, furveyed the land to the weftward, and faw that a fiuice, opened from the Jumna, where that river approaches Karnal, would from the de clivity of the ground, introduce water into the back part of the: city and conduct it through all the quarters. The defign was put in execution, and to reward his fuccefs and preferve the work in good condition, Ali Murdan was veiled with the privilege of levy ing a certain tax, on thofe houfes which enjoyed the ufes of the canal. Water was conveyed by this branch of the Jumna, form ing a dillance of more than one hundred miles and afford ed a commodious fupply to all the inhabitants; nor, did the canal fall into decay, until the period of the Perfian and Afghan invafions. Ali Murdan, who in hi$ tafte and difpofition would, not have difgraced the Roman Lucullus, bellowed on the public numerous edifices and gardens 5 one of which thickly fhaded with cyprefs^FORSTER’S TRAVELS. cyprefs trees, [lands in the environs of Pefhour, and another at Nimlah, a fmall village lying about eighty miles to the fouth-eaft of Kabul, on the Pefliour road. A respect for the memory of tins omrah has, perhaps led me into too wide a deviation from which I will now return, and inform you that the diftriels of Kabul abound in excellent provi- fions, and that its market is arranged in a neater manner and more like that of an European town, than any I have feen in Afia. The fruits are of a good kind and in great plenty, as apples, pears, peaches, pomegranates and a variety of grapes. This quarter of Afghaniftan, poffeffing but few Indian produc tions, receive fugars and cotton cloths, chiefly from Pefliour, whi ther it fends iron, leather and tobacco. To Kandahar it exports iron, leather and lamp oil, whence there turns are made in fun- dry manufaftures of Perfia and Europe, with a large fupply of melons of an excellent fort. The Tartars of Bochara, bring to Kabul the horfes of Turkiftan, furs and hides, the latter refembling thofe in Europe, called Bulgar, the amount of which is applied to the purchafe of Indigo, and other commodities of India.

Among the foreign na tions who frequent this city, the Hindoos, chiefly of Peflioitr, contribute more than any other to enrich it, by a fuperior in- duftry and knowledge of commerce ; and they enjoy under the Afghan government, a liberty and proteftion, little fhort of that experienced by the inhabitants of our Indian pofleflions. The benefits derived by a ftate from the refidence of any clafs of people, ufually enfure to them a fecurity of perfon and property $ but the Hindoos of Kabul are indebted, I believe, for fpecial indulgence to one of their own fe£l, who controuls the revenues of the Shah, and ftands high in favour. The environs of Kabul are, chiefly occupied by garden grounds, and watered by numerous ftreams ; the largeft running through the city, over which is a fmall bridge,*; affords a plentiful fupply of falubrious water. Kabul as has been before noticed, (lands near the foot of two conjoined hills, whofe length has nearly an eafl: and weft direction. Towards the bafe of the eaftern ftands, on a flat projedlion, a for tified palace, which was formerly the habitation of the governors of the city; but it has been converted by Timur Shah into a ftate prifon, where the brothers of this prince and other branches of his family are kept in confinement. Above this building is feen a fmall tower on a peak, whence the' ground rifes to a confiderable height, and is united by a neck of lower land to the * Called I have fince been informed the Pool Miftan.74 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. other hill. From the peak, a ftone wall extends over the fummits of the two hills, and is terminated at the bottom of the welter- xnoft by an ordinary redoubt. The Afghans are the indigenous pofleffors of a tra6f of coun try, which ftretches from the mountains of Tartary to certain parts of the gulf of Cambay and Perfia; and from the Indus to the confines of Perfia. The inhabitants of this wide domain, have no written character and fpeak a language peculiar to them- felves. They are a robuft, hardy race of men, and being gene rally addidled to a Rate of predatory warfare, their manners largely partake of a barbarous infolence, and they avow a fixed contempt for the occupations of civil life. Though in fome of our hiftories of Afia, the natives of Afghaniftan are denominated Tar tars, I am prompted to fay, that they bear no refemblance to thofc people, either in their perfons, manners, or language. Certain territories of Afghaniftan, were conquered in the ninth century by the khans of Bochara, of the Samani race, and annexed to the Tartar principality of Khorafan, from whence a fubordinate chief was deputed to govern at Guizni. But it does not appear that the northern quarter of the country was fubdued until the reign of Mahmoud,* the fecond prince of the Giznavi dynafty, who compleated the conqueft: of Afghaniftan.

The Ghiznavi dominion, which involved a large portion of Perfia and Hindoftan, acquired chiefly by the arms of Mahmoud, the fon of Sabuftagi, flouriflied for the fpace of two hundred and feven years, when it was wrefted from Kufro, the laft of the race of Sabuclagi, by the Afghan Mohomed Ghori.f This prince bequeathed to Eldoze, a favorite flave, his pofleffions weft of the Indus, which were quickly overrun by a Eerfxan prince of Khariftn, whofe fuccelTor Tillal-ud-Dein, was compelled to fly before the viclorious fword of Zinzis.J From the period of that revolution, till the invafion of Timur Beg, the hiftory of the Afghans is immerfed in general obfcurity ; and little fatisfactory knowledge of their government has been com municated to us, except by Ferilhta, who fays that in the year 1251, Mahmoud, a Patan, king of Dehli, drove the Moghul Tar- ^ The fifth prince of that dynafly. f So called from Ghor a diftrift or principal town, in the northern town in the northern part of Afghaniftan. $ This event happened about the year 1242, K z tars76 .

It is probable, that it continued fubje£t to the dominion of Delhi, until the expedition of Timur’s into India, when the northern quarter of Afghaniftan became a Tartar province. As the great empire of Tartary fell into rapid decay on the death of Timur, and no relation being given of the fubfequent exiftence of a Tartar government in Afghaniftan, we may infer that it was ruled by its national chiefs until the year 1506, at which period, Baber, previoufly to his conquefl: of Hindoftan, feized on Kabul and Ghizni, which occafionally with Kandahar, were held by his pofterity for the fpace of two hundred and thirty one years, when Nadir Shah annexed them to the dominion of Perfia. In arranging thofe heads of Afghan hiftory, it may not be fu- perfluous to note, that Mahmoud Ghori, bequeathed his territory eafl: of the Indus to a Have, whom he had adopted, named Kultub U 1 Dein, the firft Afghan or Patan* king of DehJi, from whom a fucceflion of princes of the fame nation, continued to reign for near three hundred years, and ended in Ibraham, of the houfe of Lodi; who was flain in battle by Baber.

Yet the lofs is the more eafily confoled, when it is confidered, that little in ft ruction or pleafure can arife to the mind, from reviewing the aftions of a race of men enveloped in favage ignorance, and ftigmatifed even by the fierce Tartars for their cruelty and rapine. The Afghans received the religion of Mahomet from their Tartar conquerors, and like them profefiing the Sooni creed, are avowed enemies to the Schias, or the Sectaries of Ali. Though many of the tribes muft have been converted at the period of the Ghizni dynafty, it is feen that Timur encountered a fierce body of this nation, whom he denominated infidels. At this day, the Afghans are efteemed the leaft correct of the Mahometans in religious obfer- vances; and few of them are converfant in foreign letters. Their common drefs confifts of a fhirt, which falls over the upper part of long and narrow trowfers; a woollen veft, fitted clolely to the body, and reaching to the mid-leg, and a high turned up cap, of broad cloth or cotton, ufually of one colour, and of a conic form $ with two fmall parallel flits in the upper edge of its facing.

Mahmud held pof- ieffion of the capital and the fouthern provinces until his death, when the fucceffion devolved on Afhruff, an Afghan of the fame tribe, who in the year 1730, continued to exercife a fovereign power in the interior parts of the country. About this period, Thamas Mirza, who had fled from the Afghan arms, raifed a body of military adherents, and ultimately aided by the prowefs of Nadir his principle officer, made a vigorous attack upon the Af ghan ufurper ; Afliruff maintained fome obftinate conflidts with the Perfian army, which was wholly commanded by Nadir, the moft intrepid and fuccefsful foldier of the eaft $ but he was com pelled to yield to the fuperior genius of his enemy, and in retiring towards Kandahar with not more than a hundred men, he was at tacked by a party of his marauding countrymen, and cut off after a defperate defence.

Having recovered the territo ries^ which the Turks and Ruffians had difmembered from Perfia du mg the weak reign of Hufieyn, and expelled the Afghans, Nadir Shah depofed Thamas, and entering Afghaniftan in the year 1737 with a large army, 4 aid fiege to the ftrong fort refs of Kandahar, which was at that time held by KufTeyn Khan, an in dependant Afghan chief.

At this day he retains, on the eaft fide of the Indus, the principality of Kafhmire, the diftrift of Attock, with fome fcattered divifions of Moultan, including the city and the territory of Scind. Yet Timur Shah derives but few real advantages from his Indian domain. Scind at the period of my journey, was in a degree difmembered from his empire ; no revenue had been remit ted to Kabul for the fpace of two years, or any meafure adopted to enforce obedience. And the governor of Moultan, confiding on his remote diftance from the empire and the inaftive difpofition, of the prince, Ihews only that attention to the orders of govern- ment, which is moft accordant with his purpofes. From this out line you will perceive, that the Afghan dominion in India, does not ftand on a flourifhing ground; that under the aufpices of Timur, few marks of its extenfion are evinced; or that it im parts any leading influence in the affairs of Hindoftan. * Nadir Shah deftroyed the old fortrefs of Kandahar, which flood on the top of a high rocky hill, and founded on a contiguous plain, a city entitled Nadirabad j it was completed by Ahmed Shah 5 and is now only known by the name of Kandahar. _ ■k 2 RumoursFORSTER’S TRAVELS. $4 Rumours wafted from the court of Dehli, have occafionally agitated our quarter of India, and taught us to believe that Timur with a mighty hoft, had eroded the Indus, and was making rapid marches to Dehli, to reftore the loft authority of the Moghul empire. Rut this is an empty tale, framed to raife the fpirits of a decaying drooping court, or amufe the dreaming politicians of the day. It is indeed, fo oppofite to the truth, that the Af ghan prince, inftead of urging a foreign enterprize* feems afraid to move from his capital.* At this time a common outcry of the foldiery prevails againft the Shah, for a large failure of mi litary payments;, and it appears that fmee the year 1780, when he vifited Pefhour, where he was treacheroully attacked by a party of difaffefted Afghans, he has fhewn no defire of leaving Kabul.-fv Since that period Timur Shah, has appeared in the field and proceeded to the pro^ Vince of Moultan ; but his operations, futile and indecifive, have terminated after muefi negotiation and threat, in a manifeft incapacity to complete the reduction of a nominal tributary; and having diflblved the charm that popular opinion had impreffed on his name, he returned - inglorioufly into his own country.

In token of impe rial dignity, he wears on days of ceremony, a high cap of black velvet, with a top of a quadrangular form. From a want of vigor in the government, a thin population, and the averfion of the Afghans to civil occupations, the reve nue of Timur Shah bears an inadequate proportion to the ex tent of his dominion.

At Kandahar, are eftabliflied many Hindoo families, chiefly of Moultan and the Rajepoot diftri£ts, who by their induftry and mercantile knowledge, have eflentially augmented its trade and wealth. The Turcoman merchants of Bochara and Samarkand, alfo frequent this mart, whence they tranfport into their own country a confiderable quantity of indigo, with which commo dity Kandahar is annually fupplied from various parts of upper India. This city is more abundantly fupplied with provifions and at a cheaper rate, than any place I have feen on the weft fide of the Indus. The grapes and melons of numerous kinds are peculiarly high flavoured, and are comparable with the fir ft fruits of Europe. The extenfive range of fhops occupied by Hindoo traders, with the eafe and contentment exprefled in their deportment, affords a fair teftimony of their enjoying at Kan dahar, liberty and proteftion. A son of Timur Shah governs the city with a tra£l of de pendant territory, which produces it is faid, a revenue of eighteen lacks of rupees ; and it may be juftly concluded from the ap pearance of all clafies of people, that this col!e£tion is made without any extraordinary rigour. The environs of Kandahar occupy an extenfive plain, covered with fruit gardens and cul tivation, which are interfered with numerous ftreams, of fo excellent a quality as to become proverbial and the climate is happilymm FORSTER’S TRAVELS. happily tempered, between the heats of India and the cold of Ghizni. It it generally fuppofed in Europe that Kandahar ftands in a country of mountains, and we fpeak of the lofty paffes of Kandahar, as a point not lefs clearly afeertained than the exiftence of the Alps. Permit me to redtify this popular error, which, like many of a fimiiar texture, has made mountains of mole-hills, and acquaint you that the face of the country furrounding the new city of Kandahar, forms an extenfive plain, which as it approaches the fite of the old fortrefs, becomes interfperfed with hills $ but they are of a moderate height; nor, do they form any barrier of difficult accefs or deep extent. On leaving Kabul, Bagdafir, my Georgian hoft, had given me- introdudlory letters to two Turkifh refidents of Kandahar; the one kept a fmall fliop in the bazar, the other, Aga Ahmed, had a warehoufe of fome note in the karavanfera. This perfon re ceived me in a courteous manner, and though then in the charadler of a Chriftian, I did not experience any of that haughtinefs of manner, with which Mahometans ufually regard thofe of our faith. He even direfted his countryman the fhopkeeeper, to pro vide the neceffaries for my journey, and to carefully guard againft any fraud. The immediate departure of a kafilah, and the fail approach of winter, when the road to Perfia is impaffable, determined me to proceed to Herat; though I wiffied much for a few days re- LdenceFORSTER’S TRAVELS, 105 fidence at Kandahar.

Could I have found a fit aflbciate to divide the cares of houfe- keeping, I would have remained at Kandahar, during the win ter, as I ftill felt the effedts of the late ficknefs, and feared a relapfe from the fatigue of travelling; but the predicament^ in which I .flood, wholly precluded any domeftic connection with the Maho metans ; and that of fome ftray Armenians, whom 1 found there, did not feem eligible. 1 he road from Ghizni to Kandahar, according to my grofs obfervations, tends to the fouth-weft; and the country has ge nerally a barren afpedt, with a fcanty fupply of wood and water.

My perfecuting neighbour, had already deprived me of two fervants, when after much intreaty, mixed with a w 7 arm eulogium on his extenfive ca pacity, I prevailed on him to moderate his refentment againft me # and ceafe to anathematife thofe, who might in future be induced from their neceffity to eat the bread of an infidel.

I was, he laid, an incorrigible Kaufir, whom ill .• fortune had placed with him on the fame camel, and which he feared could never thrive under fuch a weight of fin. The urgent calls of hunger now gave me a third fervant, who was in his way from Moultan, to make the pilgrimage of Muf- chidj*FORSTER’S TRAVELS. io*» chid * Think how ardent muft have been the zeal which incited this pilgrim to To diftant a journey, and fupported him againft the inclemency of winter, and the inhofpitality of a rude people, with fcarcely a covering to his back, no fhoes to his feet, or an atom of money in his purfe. Though I gave him fome warm clothing and fublfantial food, he was not able to keep pace with our party. His fucceffor was a Kaflimirian, who had a countenance as demure as that of Gil Bias’s Ambrofe Lamela, and to the extent of his ability, as great a rogue. To enhance the value of his fer- vices, for which I was obliged to pay largely, he expatiated on the fin he was about to commit, eating the fait of an infidel; but I foon found there was no reftriction to his diet. Moll of the Afi- atic nations have affixed to fait a certain facred property, but it is held in the highell: degree of reverence by the Mahometans, who fpeak of fait as Europeans do of bread. A fervant is faid to eat the fait of his matter, and when guilty of ingratitude, he is ftig- matized with the name of a Nimmock Haram, or a polluter of his fait, which is, I believe, the only term applied by Mahometan nations to inch an offender.

The Seid foon felt the natural benefit of this admini- ftration ; but the violence of the fhock created a temporary ftupefaclion, during which he uttered fo incoherent a language that it confirmed the opinion that a demon was fpeaking, and not the Tartar. Our Logician addreffed the infernal perfonage in a very fpi- rited harangue, feverely reprehending his entrance into the body of one of the prophet’s defcendants, and challenging him, that the cloven foot might confpicuoufly appear, to repeat the Ma hometan creed. To this reft the fhartered Rate ot the Seid’s fenfes were not yet equal; nor, was it until he had fmoaked hismmmm n , FORSTERS TRAVELS. pipe, that he diflinctly and with furrounding applaufe, pronounced his creed and fhook off all diabolical connection. On the 23d, at Ghurmow in the defart, five furfungs. This evening my perfecuting companion left our party and proceeded with fome Hindoo Traders to Fera, an Afghan town of fome note, lying about forty or fifty miles to the fouth-weft of Drauze. But, my joy at this riddance, like moll joys of fublunary texture, was of fhort duration ; for the vacant place fell to the lot of a much- more obnoxious aflbciate. I begin now to be afhamed at having impofed upon you fb large a portion of private ftory; yet, without it, I perceive my fubjedl would be as barren as the land I travel over; which ex hibits to the fatigued eye, one vaft fteril plain, without rivers, wood, or fcarcely a place of human habitation. Though perfonal recitals are ufually fufpe&amp;ed of vanity, and even in their befi: fenfe partake more of the amazing than the inftrudtive qualities, you may perhaps gather from my anecdotes, fome fubfidiary knowledge of the human chara&amp;er, an important fubjeft, and not lefs va rious than the human face. My next afibciate was the Arab taylor, already mentioned, who fucceeded to the vacant pannier by the affiftance of one of his countrymen in our party, a trader of fome note. A converfation held when I was thought afleep, fome nights before, between the logician and the taylor; in which the latter was ftrenuoufly exhorted to rob me, boded no good from the change; and this counfel was ftrengthenedFORSTER'S TRAVELS. n 3 by a doclrine, very prevalent among the lower clafles of Ma hometans, that it is meritorious and laudable to attack the pro perty of an infidel. Nor was the advice loft on the taylor, who promifed an active diligence in performing the required fervice. Combining therefore the intereft of the world with that of his religion, he commenced a brilk attack on my chattels 5 but, which at that time my vigilance preferved. His fubfequent at tempts however were more fuccefsful, as were feen in the diminu tion of my apparel. This freebooting fyftem of the taylor’s kept me in conftant alarm, and difplayed every day in ftronger co lours, the ill confequences of my Chriftian garb. On the 24th, at Ghiraunee, fix furfungs. A populous walled village, fituate near a fmall running water. Halted there the next day to make the payment of a toll, and purchafe provifions for a three days journey over a defert, which reaches from this place to the confines of Khorafan. My Kafhmirian fervant was wholly divefted of religious fervor or a religious cloak. For he neither prayed nor wafhed ; but, was much addidled to theft ; and while the taylor purloined my cloths, he was occupied in ftealing my vidtuals. Yet this propenfity was, in fome degree, compenfated by his fervices, which found aftive employment in bringing water and fuel, baking cakes, and boiling my coffee. On the 27th, at Khoos, in the defart, five furfungs. The tay lor’s payments for conveyance not being regularly made, the feat was again put up to fale, when it was purchafed by an Hin- ^ 0L * F doftany cFORSTER’S TRAVELS. r 34 ‘Of*- doftany Mahometan, who had left his wife and family at Juan- pour, in the diitncf of Benares, and was thus far advanced on a pilgrimage to Mufchid. From the mouth of this devotee, who had formerly been a marauding foldier, there iffued an aim oil inceffant ejaculation of prayer. In truth it may be faid, that he overflowed in holy zeal, for he prayed and cryed in a fucceflive rotation ; what an extraordinary character would this be thought in a country where its inhabitants, though fluinning no peril or fatigue in the purfuit of wealth and pleafure, will fcai cely crofs a ftreet to look into a Church. The various precepts of education and religion, eftablifhed in the world, but, efpecially, the different orders of government, produce fb tliong a diflimi- Jarity in the manners of men, that in inveftigating thofe of the moft oppofite tendency, they would feem to arife from beings of a diftindl fpecies.

The road from Kandahar to Gimmuch leads to the weft or weft by north; from thence to Herat, it has I apprehend, nearly a northern courfe, yet I cannot account for the fudden deviation of the track. The country is generally open, and interfperfed with barren rocky hills of a moderate height. The foil is light and fandy, producing na turally little elfe than the aromatic weed before noted. The city of Herat ftands on a fpacious plain, which is inter fered with many fprings of running water, fome of which are fupplied with bridges ; and the numerous villages furrounded with plantations, muft afford a pleafant view to the traveller, whofe eye has been wearied with the deferts of Afghaniftan. The diredtor of the kafilah carried us to the karavanferah, where paffengers only are lodged ; the other places of this defcrip- tion, being all occupied by refident traders. In this fquare of the karavanfera, I perceived an Armenian, whom I informed with little ceremony, lead he fhould hear a left favourable ftory, that I was an European, returning from India into my own country: but, fgr greater perfonal fecurity, I had affumed the name of an Armenian. And to quiet any fufpicion of the truth of my re lation, I produced a letter, which the Georgian, Bagdafir, had writ- P 2 tenFORSTER’S TRAVELS. 116 ten in my favour to an Armenian, who lived in a village about forty miles from Herat, My addrefs was clofed by obferving, that though not in want of money, I flood in great need of his friendly offices, as he mu ft be well aware of the various difficulties affedling thofe of our fe£l, efpecially when alone, among lo bigotted a peo ple as thofe of Khorafan. The Armenian heard the little oration, which all my powers of fpeech had pointed at him, with a refolute coohiefs, and perceiving, I fuppofe, that my acquaintance would yield no profit, he turned from me and went away, without even expreffing the common terms of civility. The frequent occafions which have occurred to me of noticing the Armenian character, foon cooled my resentment, and enabled me to reconcile the wari- nefs and apathy of this man, with the common principles which govern his fe£t. The prefent race of Armenians, like the Jews, are with little exception occupied in commerce, chiefly in its fmalleft branches, and having long loft with their country the fpirit of patriotifm, divefted alfo of any valuable attainments of knowledge, they ex hibit but a faint difcrimination of chara£ler; being generally in- duftrious, fervile and difhonefl; they are fcattered over various parts of Turkey* Perfia, and India, where except in the Englifli colonies, they live on a precarious fufferance, being often on tri vial pretences, infulted, opprefled and plundered. To palliate the evils inherent to their fltuation, and create a fubftitute for powers,, honors* and national importance, they purfue the. dif ferentFORSTER'S TRAVELS. , n? ferent roads of traffick with unremitting ardor, and invariably meafure their pleafures by the mere extent of their wealth. Little fufcepdble of friendftiip, they are rarely induced to afford even among themfelves mutual affifiance, or difpofed to promote the enjoyment of fociety : the Armemians at this day are divided into two general claffes y the one the moft numerous, eftablifhed in the Turkilh dominions ; the other in Perfia. The city of Jolfa, contiguous to Ifpahan, was expreffly founded for the accommodation of the Armenians, by Shah Abbas, who aware of the benefits that would accrue to his kingdom, from a commercial and temperate people, gave them an ample proteblion, and many indulgencies. He permitted them it is faid to accompany their adventures to foreign countries, and advanced a capital to thofe not already opulent, but he al ways kept their families at jolfa in pledge of good conduft. The Indian Armenians are of the Jolfa colony, and from an a6lual refidence in that city, or fprung from families originally fettled there, are all converfant in the Perfian language. The vicinity of the Perfian gulf, which has long maintained an im portant trade with India, naturally allured the Armenians to a region, which at once held out to them the hope of fpeedy opu^ lence, and the advantages of a temperate government. Nor did they ever think of returning into Perfia; but having amaffed a fufficient wealth, purchafed the releafe of their families on the payment of large fums. FromFORSTER’S TRAVELS. ii8 -Mlj'WlT' From the defeription given of the Armenian character, which I am not confcious of having in the leaft overcharged, you will not be furprized at the mode in which I was received by my bro ther Chriftian at Herat. But I now determined to Aide into the Mahometan community, on the firft fairoccafion ; feeing that with out adding one benefit, I was like to become a trartyr to our faith. In all parts of the city which I frequented, I was known only as a Mahometan, except in the karavanfera, where I experienced unceafing infult and derifion; for the Perfians ailect t a g uisr fcruple in communicating with thofe of a different religion, than any other fe£t of Mahometans. I was not even permitted to draw water out of a common well, but ordered to place my veffel on the ground, which was filled, by a peifon hired for the purpofe, from a height and not touched. When I have been waiting for this fupply, the town boys who in their round of diverfion, would occafionally take our karavanfera in their way, learning that I was an impure perfon, uied to form a cir cle round me, and defired to have the unclean part fhewn to them, and feemed much difappointed, on being told that I was ' unclean all over. My journey hitherto, if not produdlive of other advantage, has corredled my former belief of Mahometan politenefs and fuavity of manners, and alfo I truft, qualified that infolence of carriage, which I have too frequently evinced to the inhabitants of our eaftern territories.

Whenever I quitted the purlieus of my lodging, I became a grave hypocrital Muffulman, with the enjoyment of all his pri vileges ; and the city containing a various defcription of people, there was little appreheniion of a difcovery. I daily frequented the eating-houfes, where all the talk of the day is circulated, and chiefly fabricated, in conjundtion with the barber’s fhop, which in Herat, has a neat appearance. In the centre of it ftands a fmall ftone pillar, on the top of which is placed a cup of water, in readinefs for operation, and the fides of the fliop are decorated with looking glafles, razors, and beard combs. Home having no plealures for me, I was glad to feek them abroad; nor did 1 fail in procuring equal amufement and information. Neither Afghaniftan or the northern provinces of Perfia, permit the refidence of courtezans, or any women that dance or ling for the public entertainment. The northern Periians affedl to expiefs an abhorrence of the Indian Mahometans, whom they reprobate for a general depravity of manners, and a negledl of religious duties, yet this temperate and demure people are much defamed, if under their myfterious carriage of body, they do not practice in their different vocations, every fpecies of deceit and knavery.1 20 F O R S T ER’S T R A V ELS. knavery. In India, it is a well known fa£t, that the Moguls, a denomination given there to all foreign Mahometans, throw off their northern cloke, and becoming notorious debauchees, laugh to fcorn the precepts of their doftors. Herat is a fmaller city than Kandahar, but maintains a refpectable trade 5 and the market-place occupying a long ftreet, covered with an arched roof, is filled with {hops of various wares. Bread, rice, and flefii meats, with numerous fruits and ve getables, are equally cheap and abundant; and the grand market, held once a week, is fo crouded with the produce of the neigh bouring villages, that a pafiage through it is difficult and fati guing. Coarfe woollens of a ftrong texture are manufadtured in the adjacent diftricts, a great part of which made into garments, are exported into various parts of northern Perfia ; furtouts of fheepfkin with the wool in the infide, are feen hanging at al- moft every fhop, and are ufed by all clafles of people in the winter feafoo.

Nor does it appear that any of thofe violent commotions were ex cited, which ufually mark the progrefs of ecclefiaftical reformation.

Some claffes of the Schiahs believe that Ali was an incarna tion of the deity, who perceiving they fay, the miffion which had been delegated on Mahomet to be incomplete, affumed the perfon of this khaliph, for the purpofe of fixing the Mofiem faith and power on a firmer bafis. The Schiahs have imbibed ftrong reli gious prejudices, are more inflamed with the zeal of devotion, and confequently lefs tolerant to the other feels than the Soonis. In Perfia, they do not permit a Soom to eat at their board, and in common language, without provocation 01 heat of temper, they call him an infidel. But in what light, dear Sir, will you view a numerous and a civilized people, who have produced writings that would exalt the name of the moll polifhed nations, yet in folemn deliberate expreflion, imprecate God’s wrath nve times a day, on the fouls and allies of three men who never did them an injury, and who in their day, advanced the empire of Mahomet to a high pitch of glory and power.

The Soonis, though aware of this unvaried ceremony of execrating the memory of men, whom they have been long taught to hold in reverence, and that they themfelves are ftigmatized as infidels, do not even, when fully empowered, intemperately refent this perfe- cuting fpirit of the Perfians. In the divifion of Khorafan, fubjedf to the Afghan empire, the Perfians enjoy a fair portion of civil and religious liberty, and are rarely treated with infults. In noticing the more liberal opinions of the Soonis, in the pra&amp;ice of their religion, I am brought to the recollection of an occurrence, which places this fa£t in a confpicuous point of view. An Armenian merchant from Ifpahan, accompanying an ad venture of feme value, came to the karavanfera in Kabul, where I lodged $ and though five of his countrymen were on the fpot, the other refidents being Jews, Mahometans and Hin doos, not one of them advanced to give him welcome or an offer of affiftance; and to augment his embarraffment, all the apart ments of the ferauce were occupied. In this predicament flood the Armenian, and he mu ft have lain in the ftreet, had not a Turk invited this forlorn Chriftian into his own apartment; and he fed him alfo at his own board. One of the Armenian tribe, after fome days, taking fhame, perhaps from the Maho metan example, or expecting fome advantage from the cargoe R 2 of.„ a .

It is now time to revert to my own ftory, and inform you, that it had been my firft intention to have proceeded from. Herat to Rdhd, the principal town of the Ghilan province, which lies a few miles inland from Inzellee, a Ruffian factory on the border of the Cafpian fea. It is a computed journey of feventy days, of about twenty miles each, from this city to Relhd,* but the road which leads through the lefier'ftiakj'f - has a deviating courfe from the direct: line. Being informed by the Armenians of Herat, that Ruffian veflels navigate along the coaft of Mazanderan, to which a ftraight track lay from hence, though not much frequented from being fubject to the depredation hof the Turcoman Tartars, 1 was refolved to purfue this route, at once direct and wholly unknown to European travellers.

Some days before my departure from Herat, an Afghan Seid came into my apartment, and perceiving in the courfe of conver- fation that I was a Chriflan, he exclaimed with fenfible emotions of joy, that he had now obtained a favorable opportunity of re venging the grievous injuries fullained by many of his holy ances tors at the hands of infidels, and that unlefs I paid a fine of five hundred rupees,* I mufl repeat the creed of Mahomet and be circumcifed. Pretending an ignorance of the purpofe of this de mand, I carried the feid, with a mifchievous intention I confefs, to the next quarter, where the Armenian corps, four in number, were then affembled, and requefted the principal of them, who Ipoke the Perfian language with fluency, to explain the fubftance of the feid’s demand $ and this was precifely the point to which I wanted to reduce the queftion. When the hungry Afghan per ceived, that inftead of one Chriftian he had found five, his exul tation had no bounds. He fwore by his beard, that we Ihould all incur the fine or circumcifiom Oh ! what a glorious light, cried * Such pecuniary afleffment is termed Jayzeah, ami is occafionally levied in Ma*- hometan countries, on thofe who do not profefs the faith of Mahomet..FORSTER'S TRAVELS. *JT he, will be difplayed to our prophet, when thefe hardened infidels, renouncing their herefy and impurities, lhall become a portion of the faithful: what a triumph to our holy religion ! The expe dient which I had adopted, though not a fair, was for me a for tunate one ; as the contrbverfy, which became ferious, was now more equal. The feid called loudly on the Mahometans in the name of the prophet, to affift in compelling the enemies of his religion either to embrace it, or by adminiftrating to the wants of his defcendants, contribute to its fupport; the Perfian refideuts of the karavanfera endeavoured to afTuage the Afghan s intemperance *. but they quickly withdrew all interpofition, on being told that the toleration of their doctrine was a greater indulgence, than the maintenance of tneir execrable tenets deferved. The fe.d experiencing however more obftinate reliftance from the Ohiif— tians than he had expefted, it was evidently leen, that however ar dent might have been his zeal for the advancement of religion, he was not the lefs mindful of his temporal welfare; and permitting himfelf, after difplaying great powers in this holy war, to be foothed by the fuppliant infidels, he withdrew his threats for a trifling fum of money ; far difproportioned to the firft demand. And here I muft obferve, that when I faw the refolute and judi cious manner in which the principal Armenian conduced his fhare of the confiicf, I felt a compunction for having involved him in fo ferious an embarraflment. At Herat I found, in two karavanferas, about one hundred HindooFORSTER'S TRAVELS. *3.5: Hindoo merchants, chiefly natives of Moultan, who by the main tenance of a brifk commerce, and extending a long chain of credit, have become valuable fubjefts to the government ; but dif- coui aged by the infolent and often opprefflve treatment of the Per- fians, they are rarely induced to bring their women into this country.

Being habituated to the manners of upper Afia, and con- verfant in moft of its languages, the Jews and Armenians mix with little perfonal inconveniency in Mahometan focieties. The leading cuftoms of the various nations of Afia are II- milar, or but weakly diverfified. When they fit, the legs are croffed or bent under them; they perform topical ablutions be fore and after meals, at which no knife or fpoon is ufed, un- lels the diet be wholly liquid ; they invariably adopt the like modes of performing natural evacuations. And all the hair of the body is (haved, except that of the beard yet this lafi: ufage is more peculiar to upper Afia, where Jikewife all degrees of people cover the head; affixing the idea of indecency to its being bare ; and they never enter an apartment covered with a carpet, without pulling off their fhoes.

The principal Armenian earneftly urged me to open myfelf to him, and dif- clofe the myftery which appeared in my character. It was not in reafon, he faid, to believe that motives of curiofity, as I al- ledged, could have induced me to incur fo much fatigue, dangei, and expenfe, which were only to be compenfated by the prof- pe£t of gain, or a pilgrimage to Jerufalem.

This demand was no fooner adjufted, than he commenced another attack, not on my purfe, though that was weak, but on my fame, which was vulnerable all over. Ali feeing me generally addrefled by the title of Hadji, and treated with a marked civility, was much mortified, and be gan to fap the importance I had obtained. He whifpered to fome of thofe with whom I afibciated, that I was no Hadgi nor even one of the true faith.

Markets and public fhops being only feen in the cities and principal towns of Perfia and Afghaniftan, travellers are obliged to apply for provifions to the houfekeepers, who are often unable to provide the required quantity. Though Kauff is a village of note, bread in no part of it is publkkly vended, and having occafion for a three days fupply, I advanced the required price to a Perfian, who, after keeping me in waiting till midnight abfconded. Bread and the cheefe of fheeps milk, when procurable, was my common fare; which, with a water beverage, gave me a vigor and ftrength equal to the daily fatigue I incurred.

On the 6th, at Alhkara, five furfungs, a fmall fortified vil- lar'e. A great quantity of fnow fell on our arrival at this place, and the weather became fo tempeftuous, that the kafilah could not proceed. Our party went into the fort to leek fhel- ter, and after earneft intreaties, were conduced into a fmall dark room, barely capable of defending us againft the itorm, which had now fet in with violence. The inhabitants aware of our diftrefs, furnilhed an abundant fupply of fuel, which be came as neceffary to our exiftence as food; but when the cold was a little qualified, we experienced an urgent want of pro- vifions; not an article of which was to be procured at Afhkara. This dilemma difmayed the ftouteft of us, and became the more alarming from the apparently fixed Hate of the weather. Yet, fuch cordial pleafures are inherent in fociety, that though pent up in a dark hovel, which afforded but a flimfy Ihelter againft the mounds of fnow furioufly hurled againft it, our good hu mour with each other, and an ample fupply of firing, produced cheerfulnefs and content. OneFORSTER’S TRAVELS. H5 One of our affociates who had received a more than ordinary education, and had a tafte for poetical literature, amufed us with reading Jamis’s ftory of Jofeph and Zuleicha,* which for its fcenes of wondrous pathetic adventure, and the luxuriant genius of the poet, is happily adapted to foften the rigors of a winter’s day. Nor was our companion deficient in accompanying the reading with that energetic emphafis and deep nafal tone, which in the eafl is thought highly ornamental to the recitation of poetry. As our pleafures and our forrows exift largely in the ima gination, and as at this period, my ideas did not wander beyond the circle of my refidence, I felt comforts in my prefent fituation, equal perhaps to the enjoyments of the mod refined focieties. How often in the fervor of my heart, have I prayed for the fortitude which is faid to have adtuated the ftoic fchool, that I might fhackle, or at lead qualify the paffions that are continu ally precipitating us into dependance and embarraffments, and edablifh within myfelf a refource for conducing all the opera tions of life. But the wifli was futile, nor would the gratifi cation of it accord with the (economy of human nature. The inhabitants of Afhkara were now bufily employed in commemorating the death of Huffeyn, the fecond fon of Ali, who was flain at Karibullah, in the vicinity of Bagdat, where a monu- * Fhe Patriarch of /Egypt.

Huflin, the elder brother* was poifoned by fome female machinations j but the celebration of ) this event, which is noticed at a different period of the year, does not produce that tumultuous lamentation, and often dangerous effe£ts which accompany the memory of HuiTeyn’s fate. A pilgrimage to the tomb of HuiTeyn, confers the title of Karribullahee; which claffes next after the Hadji, and before a Mufchidee, an appellation given to thofe who vifit the Ihrine of Mufchid. The pilgrims of Karibullah make grievous complaints of the infults and oppreffion of the Turks. Yet it would feem that perfecution inflames and invigorates their fenfe of this reli gious duty, fo that it is merely rated by the extent of difficulty and danger it occurs; for I have known a Schiah travel from the banks of the Ganges, to proflrate himfelf at Huffeyn’s tomb, amidfl the feoffs and rigor of the Turks. To prevent the Afghans from throwin£ a ridicule on their obfervance of the Mohurrum cere- mony, which happened during our halt at Afhkara, the Perfians Ihut the gate of the fort, and commemorated the day by beating their breads, and chanting in a mournful tone, the praifes of Huffeyn. * The Mahometan months being Lunar, the fafts, obferved in Ramfar and Mo~ hurrum are moveable.2 47 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. In India, though the proportion of the fe£t of All is fmall. and Huffeyn only known but by his name, this occafion never fails to excite extravagant tokens of grief and enthufiafm, and it often happened, that the mafquerade mourners, impelled by a vio lent agitation of their minds and bodies, and heated alfo by intox ication, commit defperate outrages. But the fa£l is, that all the natives of India, Hindoos, and Mahometans, are wondroufiy at- tradled by public exhibitions, and thofe of the mod: glaring kind. Though any external commemoration of Huffeyn’s death is re pugnant to the dodtrine of the Soonis, thofe of India cannot refill fo alluring an offer of gratifying their love of fhew and noife. Many of the Hindoos alfo, in compliance with this propenfity, and the ufage of their Mahometan mailers, contribute largely to aug ment the Mohurrum proceffions. I have heard Mr. Schwartz, the Chriftian miffionary on the coall of Coromandel, as pious a prieft as ever preached the gofpel, and as good a man as ever adorned fociety, complain that many of his Indian profelytes, dif- gufted at his churche’s want of glitter and bullle, take an early op portunity of going over to the Popilh communion, where they are congenially gratified by the painted fcenery, by relics, charms, and the blaze of fire-works. From Schiahs and Soonis, Proteflants and Roman Catholics, I am forcibly brought to the bufinefs of the day. It is the roguery of a camel-driver, on whom, fliould you ever travel in Perfia, never put your faith. Ali now gravely informed me, that he meant to proceed on the next day towards T 2 Nilha-FORSTER’S TRAVELS. 148 Nifhabor, but that he would provide a conveyance for me to Tur- fhifh on an afs. It was in vain to talk of engagements, the injuftice * of forfeiting them, or the fum I had advanced; and had not one of my afibciates pleaded my caufe with a fpirit that intimidated him ? Ali would have laughed at my plea. On the ioth, the ftorm having abated, the kafilah moved be fore day-break, and arrived in the evening at Hoondeabad, fix and a half furfungs, a finall village, fituate in a well cultivated plain, watered by many rivulets. Ali, with an ill grace, procured for me one fide of a camel, the other being poifed by a bag of rice, con- figned to the market of Turlhilh j my companions, who had con tinued to treat me with much kindnefs, proceeded from this fta- tion to Nilhabor, which lies about feventy miles to the north-weft of Hoondeabad. The divifion of Khorafan, which has been annexed to the Afghan empire, feems to be wholly entrufted to the management of Perfians, who though a conquered people, live in the enjoy ment of every right, civil or religious, which could have been granted to them under their own princes. We met a party this day, returning from the army which Timur Shah had lent to be- fiege Mufchid. This city, on which depends a fmall tra£l of ter ritory, is governed by Shah Rock, a grandfon of Nadir Shah, and I believe, the only branch of that prince’s family now in exiftence. Shah Rock is the offspring of Mirza Kuli, the eldeft fon of Nadir Shah, by a daughter of the Sultan Huffeyn, who was driven fromFORSTER'S TRAVELS, on t he throne of Perfia by Mahmoud the Afghan. After Nadir's deaths the empire fell to the poffeffion of Aii, his nephew, who cut off all the defcendants of Nadir, except Shah Rock then a youth, whom he intended to raife nominally to the throne, ftiould the Perfians fnew any ftrenuous oppofition to his government. But being in a fhort time after his acceffion, encountered by his brother, who by liberal donations had collefted a ftrong force, Ali was defeated and taken prifoner in the field. Ibrahim, though at the head of a numerous army, and poffeffing the fouthern pro vinces of the empire, faw the impraclibility of attaining the do minion of Perfia, whilft Shah Rock, who was much beloved in Khorafan, held the city of Mufchid, where a large portion of the treafures of Nadir were depofited. That he might the better fucceed in his defign of feizing the perfon of Shah Rock, his only rival, he declared this prince, by a lineal defcent from Nadir and the race of Sofi, to be the right- full heir of the kingdom, and by public deputation invited him to Ifpahan, that he might there be invefted with the diadem of his anceftors. The adherents of Shah Rock, averfe from entrufting him to fo powerful and fufpicious a charge, made an advan tageous ufe of Ibrahim’s profeflions, by inftalling with the ne- ceflary ceremonials, the young prince at Mufchid. Ibrahim, * Nadir Shah was afTaflinated at the age of fixty years, near Mufchid, in the month of June, 1747. baffled■■ FORSTER’S TRAVELS. baffled in the defign of drawing Shah Rock to Ifpahan, caufed himfelf to be proclaimed king, and proceeded to reduce the chiefs of Khorafan. But fquandering his treafures by an m- dU’crinainate profufion, and having difgufted his troops by an injudicious choice of officers, he was betrayed by them, and to gether with Ali, then his prifoner, delivered to the minifters of Shah Rock, who put the brothers to death. About this period appeared, it is faid, a defcendant of the ancient Sofi family, who had eicaped the maflacre of the times, and improving to his purpofes the diftraciion of the kingdom and the minority of a young prince, he fuborned, by a largefs, and extenfive promifes, a party in the court of Mufchid, and having procured at a fecret hour admittance into the palace of Mulchid, he feized the perfon of Shah Rock and deprived him of fight. The a£l was foon punifhed by the death of the perpetrator; but Shah Rock, cut off by this calamity from the hope of empire, was contented to remain at Mufchid, in the pofleflion of a very limitted revenue. He has two fons. Nadir Mirza, and Wulli Neamut, who are waging againft each other an inveterate predatory war. Wulli Neamut being driven from the city, has colle&amp;ed a body of cavalry, which in Khorafan are ever ready to rove in quell: of plunder, and are at this time levying a general contribution on every village, karavan, and traveller, within his power or reach} not fparing even the pilgrims. After an ineffe&amp;ual effort to enterFORSTER’S TRAVELS, 151 enter the city, he folicited the affiftance of Timur Shah, who fent a fmall army to join him and befiege Mufchid. But their N - • S knowledge of artillery is fo limited, that the Afghans after the campaign of a year, have only been enabled to ftreighten the fupplies of the befieged. When the extenlive conquefts of the Afghans in Perfia are confidered, the fpacious empire which they have fo recently founded, and their general reputation for military prowefs, I felt a fenfible difappointment at feeing their armies, compofed of a tumultuous body, without order or common difeipline. It is feen, however, that they were good foldiers under Ahmed Shah, who himfelf, a prince of confpicuous military talent and a difeerning patron of merit, was empowered to give his troops that force which they conftitutionally poiTefs. Yet even under this famed leader, the Afghans, impetuous, and haughty from the form of their government, were never an obedient foldiery; and the fevere encounters which Ahmed Shah experienced from the Sicques* when he ultimately evacuated the Punjab, are attributed to the defertion of his troops, who already enriched by the plunder of India, retired in large bodies to their own country. Though far fhort of the opinion I had formed of it, the Af ghan army is much luptrior to that of Perfia at the prelent day, who long deprived of a monarch, and fubjccled either to a foreign yoke or the precarious authority of petty chieftains, have toft vri h their patriotifm the Ipirit of enterprise. It appears that tne Per- fiansF OUSTER’S T R A V E L S. 15* fians have been ever ill acquainted with the ufe of fire arms, and that their grand fucceffes were obtained by the formidable onfet of their cavalry. Little other proof inueed is required oi theii want of fkill, than a review of Nadir’s long liege of Bagdad, which, though a fortification of mean ten ability, baffled all his efforts. The matchlock-piece is the common weapon of a Perfian foot fol- dier, except in the province of Auderbeijan, and in fome parts of Shirvan and Dhaghiftan, where the ufe of the fpring lock mufquet has been adopted from the Turks; but the ridicule which has been thrown on this praftife by the body of tne people, will pro bably long prevent its general introduction. The feverity of the winter feafon, has now obliged the Afghan army to retire into quarters, and afforded a temporary relief to the inhabitants of Mufchid, who began to feel a want of provifions. The young chief of this city, in defiance of the reprefentations of his clergy, has coined into current fpecie fuch of thofe orna ments with which the oftentatious zeal of the Schiahs had for two centuries been decorating the tomb of Mooza Beza, as had been preferved from former depredations. Even Nadir, the avowed foe of prieffhood, made his offering at the fhrine of Mufchid. But his defcendant fearing that the whole fabric would fall into the unhallowed hands of his enemies, has wifely facrificed a part, to, prevent a total deffrucfion. Yet his efforts will probably be fruit- lefs j for if the Afghans return to the fiege, they will derive a con- fiderable aid from the low ffate of the Mufchid treafury, which IVol. XL U then FORSTER’S TRAVELS. am informed is nearly confumed.

Were this fpacious extent of territory, governed by as vigorous and enterprizing a prince, as it is peopled by a brave and hardy race of men, the entire conqueft of Perfia would not be of difficult attainment. But Timur Shah inherits no por tion of his father’s genius, and his power is feldom feen or felt, except fome objedt of wealth, and of fafe accompliftiment be held out to his avarice.

The fort of Turlhilh being at no greater diftance than two miles, I would have proceeded without hditation, could I have carried my baggage, which though of little value, was too heavy a load for me. After much intreaty, it was tran- fported at my charge, on the back of an afs,* to the kara- vanfera at Turfhifn; there I found every apartment occupied, but the application of a fmall piece of money to the gate keeper, who regulates the diftribution of quarters, introduced me to a lodging, occupied by only one perfon. The ftranger accofted me with evident tokens of joy, obferving, that the folitary life he had paffed at Turfhida, was very tirefome to him, and that he expedted a cordial relief from my company. This reception was happily adapted to my purpofe, and promifed my Maho metan charadter a fair introduction. It was agreed that a joint board Ihould be kept, that my alibciate, yet weak from a late ficknefs, Ihould prepare the victuals, and that I fhould furnilh the water, and a laborious duty it was, there being no good water at a nearer diftance than a mile.

Even men of opulence do not carry a fervant. Previously to the commencement of a journey, focieties are formed at the place of rendezvous, where the different offices are alloted to each ; the moft robuft generally provide the water; fome are employed in the kitchen, while others go in queft of pro- vifions and provender for the cattle. Should no prior opportunity have offered to fix fuch a fcheme, it is adjufted on the firft halting day, and preferved on a cordial footing throughout the journey. It is not to be inferred that certain attentions are not alfo fhewn to the men of rank, who attach themfelves to thefe parties.

But he ftudioufly avoided giving me any intelligence of the affairs of that province, efpecially of the Ruf fian trade there which I much defired to know, and of which he muft have been informed ; and though he feemed to like my company or perhaps my affiftance, he foon became to me an unplea-FORSTER’S TRAVELS* *57 unpleafant colleague. In a few day«, his departure to Herat left me foie tenant of a dark folitary lodging, with the advan tage, and with the privilege of being unrefervedly admitted into the fociety of the karavanfera, as a pure Mahometan. In the courfe of vacancies, I got poffeffion of a more com modious apartment, in the corner of which I found at firft en trance, a decent looking old man fmoking his pipe. On en quiry it appeared, that he was then wholly at large ; but that his ufual fubfiftance arofe from vending certain fpells, which were powerfully efficacious in conferring every fpecies of worldly happinefs, and confequently in the preclufion of all evil. Yet he was willing to fhut up his book, he faid, fliould any other profpedt of maintainance he held out. This being the perfon I was in fearch of, I made him a cordial tender of my affiftance, and invited him to a participation of my fare. The offer came to him, poor man, at a convenient feafon. It was now the depth of winter, and he honeftly confeffed to me, that his charms had fo bad a run at Turfhifh, that even a fcanty meal was earned with difficulty. The mollah, which was the title he had derived from his profeffional fkill, with a natural good temper, had acquired an accommodating difpofition ; he was all things to all men ; and he found a full exercife of thofe qualities during our affbcia- tion.

The cold being in- tenfe and the country covered with fnow, it became expedient in the firft inftance, to lay in a flock of fuel, which is a dear commodity at Turfliifli, that we might at leaft communicate an external heat to our bodies; for our creed precluded any in terior cordial, nor durft we even mention its name.

Nor could one of our minute virtuofos have been more inflated with pride at the difcovery of a new fpecies of fnail, than the mollah, in demonftrating the qualities of fome favorite difli. The excellent fervices of my companion now left me at liberty to walk about the town, colle£t information, and frequent the public baths. In the evening we were always at home, when the Mollah at the conclufion of our meal, either read a ftory of Yufuff and Zuleicha which he did but lamely, or open ing his book of fpells, he would expound the virtues of his noflrums, which embraced fo wide a compafs, that few difeafes of the mind or body could refill their force.

But obferving that I was yet more relaxed, he would gravely cenfure my negligence; not that I was degraded in his opinion, but it was neceflary, he faid, to maintain a decorum of manners, that the people of the karavanfera might not make unfavourable remarks. The fpirit and tendency of the mollah’s obfervation, when impar tially confidered, difclofes the grand tenure by which the reli gion of Mahomet is at this day held. It is on the daily reci tal of five prayers,‘f* wafhing as often, and a reft rift ion from a certain food, that the Mahometan builds his hope of Paradife.

Travelling once with fome Perfians on a fultry day, and over an ill watered country, the party unexpedledly approached a fmall ftream, where haftily difmounting, I drank a cup of water with avidity, one of the Perfians who ftood near me, cryed out in an earned: tone, while I was finifhing the draught, to referve a little in the bottom of the veffel, and throw it on the ground with an Vol. II.

But Perfia has long loft her men of genius and philanthrophy. The day of Ferdoufi, Sadi, and H hz, is fet in barbarous darknefs; and little elfe is now written or liftened to, except the legends of pried', or the chimerical exploits of the twelve Imaums, which nearly quadrate in ftyle and matter with our renowned nurfery hiftories of Tom Thumb, or Jack the Giant-killer; though with a more pernicious efteft ; for the Per- iian writings ftrongly tend to eternife amongft them a rancorous hatred to all thofe of a different creed. It is recorded that the cotemporaries of Hafiz, were fo much offended at his bold difquifitions on the religion of the Koran, and witty fti iff ores on the loofe conduct of the clergy, that at his death, they hefitated to perform the ufual obfequies. Yet the later Perfians have not only acquitted Hafiz of any chaige of irreligion, though almoft every page of the poet refutes the pofition, but they affert, that under the cloak of his fportive pleafurable exhortations,, he defcribes the excellency of their faith, and the future happinefs of pious Mahometans.

The prefent winter was accounted more rigorous than had been for fome years remembered, particularly in the quarter of Mufchid and Nifhabor, where two of thefe pilgrims had perifhed in the fnow, and others had loft their limbs by the feverity of the froft. In that band, which rufhed into our apartment, was a perfon who feemed to take the avowed lead ; he was better equipped than his afibciates, and wore on his head the infignia of a hadji ^ a pilgrim, who fupplied the place of a fervant, began to reconnoitre the room, and as foon as he had noticed its fit nation, he diflodged without ceremony, and with much facility from one of its corners, the very portable chattels of our poor mollah 3 and in the voice of authority, declared the place affigned to the ufe of the hadji, w 7 hom he reprefented to be of fuperior rank and importance.

I told him that I was an Arab, travelling to Muf- chid ; but judge of my confufion, when the hadji began to fpeak in my fuppofed language. Endeavouring to fupprefs my embar- raffment at fo complete a conviction of falftty, I obferved, that I had affumed the name of an Arab, for the purpofe of travel ing with more fafety; but that I was a native of Kalhmire, proceeding on a mercantile concern to Mazanderan. Such Ro ries, which in the eaft may be defcribed by the fmoother term, fimulation, are in common ufe among Afiatic travellers; and un- lefs other teftimony corroborates their relations, little credit is given, nor is much expected. It is fufScient that their true Rory remains concealed. This emendation of my account, produced no apparent fur- prize, nor any further interrogation ; and from the mode of the hadji’s behaviour, it was evident that I had not fuffered in his opinion. The laR year of my life had been occupied in an in- varied fcene of dilguife, with a language wholly fabricated to pie- ferve it; fo that, God forgive me, I never wanted a ready tale for current ufe. I have now only to hope, that when it may be no longer expedient to lupport the part hitherto fo fuccefsfully main tained, I flrall be enabled to throw off the cloak with all its garni ture for ever. The hadji was a rendent of BalfroRi, the principal town iFORSTER'S TRAVELS. 165 town of Mazanderan, vvhere he maintained a confiderable traffic; he had joined the Tabrez pilgrims at xMufchid, and was now on the way back to his own province. The occafion of accompany ing this party was not to be foregone 5 as few roads are of more dangerous paffage, than that from Turfhifh to the Cafpian fea ? and confequently not much frequented. The hadji, to whom 1 applied for a paffiage to Balfroffi, affefled to lay various obftacles in my way, and feeing my anxiety to proceed, he made his bargain conformably, that is, he ftipulated for a double amount of the ufual hire. The territory of Turfhifh, which takes in about * miles from eaft to weft, and nearly half that fpace in latitudinal direction, is held by Abedullah, an independant Perfian chief 5 he feems to be forty years of age, has a refpeCtable appearance, and affumes that air of gravity which ftrongly pervades the manners of the higher claffes of Mahometans. His adminiftration is well liked by the people, who feem to a£t and fpeak very much at their eafe. Paffengers are never interrogated, nor is a paflport required. Adjoining to old Turfhifh, called alfo Sultanabad, which is of fmall compafs, and furrounded with a wall, Abedulla has built a new town, in an angle of which ftands the karavanfera, the only one I have feen in Perfia, which is not interiorly fupplied with water.

And the chief article of export feems to be iron, wrought in thick plates. The fmall quantity of European cloths required at Tur- fhifh, is brought from Mazanderan, by the way of Shahroot, or from Ghilan, by the way of the great road of Yezd. About one hundred Hindoo families from Moultan and Jeffilmere, are eftablilhed in this town, which is the extreme limit of their emigration on this fide of Perfia ; they occupy a quarter in which no Mahometan is permitted to refide, and where they conducted bufinefs without moleftation or infult: and I was not a little furprized to fee thofe of the Bramin fe£t, diftinguifhed by the .appellation of Peerzadah, a title which the Mahometans ufually beftow on the defendants of their prophet.

There are, I believe, few fuch men amongd us as Hadji Mahomet. He had the reputation of being an opulent merchant, and he was connefled with perfons of the fir A rank in his country 5 his deportment was grave and dignified ; his manners- in common intercourfe were fo forcibly infinuating, that he never failed to pleafe, even thofe who knew and had experienced his ill qualities; he had, on the odenfible fcore of devotion, made pil grimages in Arabia, Turkey, and Perfia; he prayed with unde viating regularity five times in the day, befides a long roll of fu^ pererogatory orifons. Yet this man of property and rank, of po lite manners, and profeffed fandlity, having in vain aimed at a larger fum, importuned me in abjedt language to lend or give him half a crown. But my feelings having become callous, from a long aTociation, I fuppofe, with thofe who had none, I was enabled to withdand, with intrepid coolnefs, the intreaties of the hadji,, who feemed to take the refufal nothing amifs; indeed I ima gine, he accounted me a pei fon of difcretion, and converfant in the hufinefs of the world-. That I might the better guard againd a fufpicion of the cha racter I reprelented, efpecially in the mind of the hadji, who to hisj68 FORSTER'S TRAVELS. his other acquirements united infatiable inquifnivenefs, I tol hdim .that 1 was a Sooni, imagining that the low eftimation in which this fe£t is held in Perfia, would prevent further notice. The hadji did not approve of this charadler, which was rarely fecn, and much abhorred in this part of the country $ nor would it be fafe for a Sooni, he faid, to travel in the fociety of Schiah pilgrims, who elevated by their late purification at Mufchid, would aflame a merit from infulting and ill treating me. B\ r the council of Hadji Mahomed I became a Schiah, and was received among the pilgrims without a fcruple. It was, be lieve me, with no little concern, that I parted from the mollah, who had been to me an ufeful as well as a pleafant companion ; and in the unreferved intercourfe which had for fome days fub- flfted between us, I experienced a pleafure, the more fenfible, as my fltuation before had been folitary and irkfome. In his deal ings, I found him pundhially honeft, for conceiving an attach ment to this harmlefs conjuror, I ufed to make enquiries at the places where he made his purchafes for me, but never difcovered a falfe charge. i On the morning of the 28th of December, left Turfhifh, and about noon arrived at the village of Killeelabad, two and a half furfungs.

When the chief of this place was informed that Hadji Mahomed was our leader, for though of a diftant province, he was well known in Khorafan, we were invited to the fort, and hofpitably entertained. This day my horfe gave many tokens of inability to fupport the heavy burthen that had been laid upon him. He eat little, fweated much, and often Rumbled. In one of his inclinations, I was thrown from my elevated feat with a violent Ihock, and re ceived a violent contufion on the hand. Inftead of exprefling any concern at the difafter, the hadji fharply reprehended my want of fkill, and predi&amp;ed ill fuccefs to my undertakings. At Hadjiabad the pomegranates are of a delicious flavor, a property indeed of this fruit in moft parts of Perfia.

From Turfhifti to this place, the general diredion of the road, lay about weft; the country is open and well cultivated, but like the eaftern divifion of Khorafan, fcantily fupplied with wood and running water. At this place, my endeavour to procure a fto k of wheat bread, to fupport me during a three or four days journ y over a defert, which lay in the road, was wholly fruitlefs. The number of applicants for a like provilion was fo great, and their arguments from the late meritorious fervice they had performed, was fo much more efficacious than mine, that I was obliged to reft fetisfied with a few barley cakes. Being thrown by a fort of chance, for the two laft days, into the company of a Ghilan feid, who had been making the pilgri mage of Mufchid, we agreed after a ftiort preliminary, to place in a common ftock our provihons and good offices.

On the 31 ft, at Durroona, feven fur fangs, a fmall village, fi- tuate near the wcftern boundary of the territory of Abedullah, the road led in a weftern direftion through a barren country. In eroding a fteep riv ulet, during this day’s journey, my horie precipi tated me with the radji’s bags of dye into the middle of it, where we were difeovered lying by this now enraged Mahometan. He fmote his beard until his anger found utterance, when he poured on me a torrent of abufe, and charging his ill fortune to my fcandalous omif- fion of the ftated prayers of a Muffulman, he declared that I fhould indemnify the lofs of his paint to the laft farthing. On the lit January, 1784, having travelled eight furfungs, through a defert, which was interfperfed with low hills and a thin flattering wood, we halted on an eminence, where the fnow which covered it, fupplied our water. My horfe became fo much ■enfeebled, that he was unable to carry me with the other part of his load; and I fhould have been left on the ground, had not fome of the paffengers who were apprized of the extraor dinary fum which 1 had paid for hire, warmly expofhilated with the hadji on the injuftice of his condudt j fomewhat abafhed at the remonftrance, and fearful perhaps of a more general attack on the many weak fides of his charafter, the hadji procured a horfe* from a perion who was proceeding two ftages on our road, Y 2 andFORSTER’S TRAVELS. 172 and who for a fmall gain, confented to difmount and incur an exceffive fatigue. The domeftic affociate of Hadji Mahomed, having feen his patron treat me with neglect, and often with rudenefs, thought that he might with impunity indulge a like fpirit ; but feeing no reafon to {hew him the refpeft which I obferved to the hadji, I was provoked this evening to give him a fmart chaftifement, and in the Englifh manner; a fpecies of attack as novel to him as it was efficacious, and which furprized the pilgrims, who be- flowed on me a general applaufe. In this occurrence, you will perceive the effential advantages of my Mahometan chara6ler : for in my real one no affront, however infolent, or opprobrious could have warranted any adlive refentment; the only refource would have been a filent patience; it is indeed often neceffary to affuage the offender’s wrath, to avert a further outrage. The penalty that would probably be inflidled on a Chriftian, hardy enough to lift his hand in this part of Perfia, againft a Mahometan, would be a heavy fine or fevere corporal punifhment. The Armenians who vifit mod of the quarters of weftern Afia 3 are feldom feen on this road, dreading equally the inimical difpo- fition and inveterate prejudices of the inhabitants to all thofe of a different faith, and the incurfions of the Turkoman Tartars.

The adjuftment being fpeedily made, I rode on to Towrone ; from whence I fent back this fame perfon, on whom money had irrefithble force, to bring the hadji’s tired horfe, which I learned from feme of the paflengers, was fcarcely able to crawl. Fearful of being altogether abandoned by Hadji Mahomet, I found it neceffary to fpeak to him in unreferved language, which was ftrongly fupported by a Perfian merchant, whole notice I had ac quired, and after much oppofition, became fuccefsful.

While the feid retired to pray, I went in fearch of fuel, and returning firft to our quarter, I haftily drank off the re maining water, and again betook myielf to wood-cutting, that I might not be difeovered near the emp’y veil'd by my affociate, who had naturally an iraicible temper.

This branch of hills, which feem to have a long fcope, has effedted a grand change in the courfe of the running waters.

At Dhey Mollah, the feid and I were entertained with cor- * dial hofpitality ; a benefit wholly afcribed to the inherent and contingent virtues of my companion, who from defcent, as well as his late arduous pilgrimage, had a twofold claim on the be nevolence of his countrymen. I fhould be deficient indeed, in ordinary gratitude, did I not feel the kind offices of this feid, who fmoothed the many inconveniencies which often crofled my way, and procured for me accommodations not attainable by com mon travellers.

Yet he mull: have been aware that Khorafan would have reinforced his army with thofe foldiers, who empowered Nadir to expel the Turks and Afghans from Perfia, and overthrow the empire of India. The northern regions were long the nurfery of a hardy and preda tory militia, who from their bleak plains and mountains, were wont to pour their force upon the nations of the fouth, but who in their turn felt the force of fiercer and more barbarous tribes, until continued emigrations wafted the ftock, and witheld the power of foreign conqueft.

This being the laft ftation on the road, where bread is to be procured on the eaft fide of the Mazanderan limits, I procured a neceflary fupply. On the 20th, at Killaufir, five and a half furfungs, a range of ruined buildings on an eminence, a mile’s diftance to the northward of the fmall village of Hirroos.

As this was among the very few marks of goodnefs which I experienced from the hadji, to notice it, is but fimple juftice to his charadler, of which perhaps, you are already impreffed with an ill opinion. Taking me afide, he enjoined me, in a manner which evinced an honeft concern, not on any pretence to proceed to the carrier's village 5 that the ftory of the Ihoe- maker had circulated a general belief of my great wealth, and that the carriers had been heard in concerting fchemes to rob* and even dedroy me; that if fuch was their defign, there were few adtions, he obferved, however atrocious, which thefe men would not perpetrate, when plunder was the objedl; and that the fituation of the village, which was detached and inhabited only by their families, would equally facilitate the purpofe, a&amp; preclude a difcovery. This reprefentation determined me again ft leaving the party; but having before confented to accompany the carrier, to whom the caufe of the refufal could not be affigned, I impofed the talk upon the hadji, who immediately making it his own bufi- uefs, told the carrier, in a ftern tone, that as I was under his charge, he would not permit me to be feparated from him. Though the carrier continued t 0 urge his purpofe by along and ftrenuous.FORSTER’S TRAVELS. 190 ftrenuous argument, he was overruled by the hadji, who by dome degree of compulfion, configned my horfe to the charge of another perfon. As we rode on, the hadji congratulated my near efcape from a combination, which muft have been fatal to my per Ion, or deprived me of my property ; for that many robberies were com mitted in thefe parts, and ufually accompanied by murder. This night I lodged in the remains of a bath, which feemed to have pertained to fome place of greater note, than the appearance of the adjacent ruins indicated. The Ghilan feid had not joined me in the latter part of the journey, according to a ufage obferved by us, for adjufting the concerns of our evening meal, but more prudently went to Hirroos, where he was well received. Being now habituated to the feid’s company, which had become equally amufing and convenient, for even our little difputes had a rifible \ tendency, I fenfibly felt its lofs. Though our acquaintance was of fuch fhort duration, I already began to efteem this man as a trufty friend 5 fo natural and immediate is the propenfity to cleave to what gives us folace and relieves our anxiety ; nor is any object more completely veiled with this property, than a pleafaiit com panion.

From Shahroot, the road has nearly a weftern direflion, through a country generally open. Low hills are alfo feen at wide intervals.

At Challoo, the feid largely reaped the fruits of his pilgrimage and his iacred defcent. He and confequently his affociate, for he never failed to divide with me the good things which fell to his lot, were lodged in a mofque, and hofpitably treated by the inhabitants, who fup- plied us in the firft inftance with great ftore of fuel, which ena bled us to hold out again ft a heavy ftorm of fnow, and a piercing north wind; and without which, indeed, our fpacious and airy apartment muft have been untenable. It was with pleafure I again faw an open village ; it exhibited a ruftic fimplicity and a peaceful confidence, which I think could not have exifted within a rampart. The inhabitants allb, if their kindnefs to us has not biaffed me too much in their favor, feemed to be more civilized and humane, than the people of Khorafan. The houfes here are built with flat roofs, fupported with large beams, which the adjacent forefts plentifully fupply. A continuance of the ftorm, detained us on the azd, at Chal loo, where we found no abatement of the hofpitality of the in habitants, who furnifhed every thing that could render our fitu- ation commodious. On the 23d, in the morning, our party moved and penetrated through a mountainous country, interfered with rivulets, and ' clofely covered with large trees, which being ftripped of their leaves, I could not afcertain the different fpecies, nor could the carriers, whofe only knowledge feems to confift in driving horfes. Halted, atFORSTER’S TRAVELS. 193 at the diftance of five furfungs from Challoo, under fome trees, about one hundred yards from the fide of the road, where we kept a large fire burning throughout the night; not for deterring the attack of wild beafts, which are not numerous in thefe woods, but to qualify the intenfe coldnefs of the air. On the 24th, proceeded five furfungs through the foreft. In the evening, while I was riding alone, the party, which had pro ceeded a fhort way before me, turned quickly into the wood, and came to their ftation-ground. It was in vain that 1 endeavoured to trace any marks of men or horfes; for the ground to a great extent was ftrewed with leaves. My horfe, on having for fome time loft fight of the party, became reftlefs, and I thought much terrified. It neighed inceffantly, and though a willing, adlive animal, would not move in any diredtion but with reludtance.: My fituation grew alarming; it was growing dark, and I found myfelf bewildered in an immenfe foreft, with fcarcely the hope of obtaining relief during that night. In fearching for a fpot to faften the horfe, and lay myfelf down, good fortune threw in my way two men, who were driving a loaded bullock and an afs. Without noticing my embarraffment, which they might have made an ill ufe of, or even making any enquiries, I learned that a part of the kafilah had proceeded on the road which they were purfuing, and going with them about two miles, I found Hadji Mahomet, with fome other pafiengers, refrefhing themfelves on a fmall plain, (kirted by a ftream of Vol. II. B b water.*94 FORSTER’S TRAVELS, water. The proprietor of the horfe, who had followed, expreffed much difpleafure at my quitting him, which he afcrihed to the council of the hadji, whom he fpoke of with a fneer, and laughed at the fort of protection which I had chofen. On this night was feen by mo ft of the paflengers, a ftar, with a brightly illuminated tail, which I apprehend, from its form and quick motion, muft have been a comet. Hadji Mahomet now became profufe in his offers of fervice; he promifed me every ac commodation at Mazanderan, as a fupply of cloths, for I was ill apparelled, a proper place of lodging, and to difpatch me with fafety to the quarter of my deftination. This man, though one of the moft acute and knowing of his fe£t, did not feem to entertain any idea of my being a Chriftian $ yet he fufpefted the truth of my narrative, or rather, he did not believe a word of it 3 but imagined that I was a trader in jewels, which were concealed about my perfon. Desirous of knowing the ftate of the Ruffian navigation, on the Cafpian fea, I had fought the information with too much earneftnefs,-which created a fufpicion at Shahroot, that I was a Ruffian, efcaped from the captivity of the Tartars, and return ing to my own country. But this conjecture ceafed, when it was known that I had come from the eaftern fide of Perfia. On the 24th, proceeded five furfungs, through the foreft. The greateft part of this day’s journey, lying over fteep hills of a moift clayey foil, became of difficult accefs to our cattle. TheFORSTER’S TRAVELS, 195 The carriers of this road, ufually employ mares for the con veyance of merchandize, being more tradable than itallions, and requiring lefs attendance. They are indeed as quiet as any do- meftic animal, and though feeding at large, during the night* they never ft rayed from the vicinity of the Ration. On returning this evening, from a fmall excurfion into the foreft, I found that my Ghilan affociate had left his quarter* and gone over to the perfon who has been before mentioned, as the travelling afhdant of Hadji Mahomet. He was alfo a native of Ghilan, well known to the feid, and being ftout and hale, had previoufly to their departure, agreed to be the feid’s affiftant during the pilgrimage; it was a concern of moment to this old infirm man, in the various accidents to which a long and harrafiing journey was liable, to have fo capable a companion; and the Ghilanee, to corroborate the fincerity of his offer, had formally pledged himfelf on the koran. There was every reafdn to credit the feid’s relation of this compa£V, for he was an invio lable obferver of the truth, and I have myfelf often witnefied the ill treatment which he experienced from his countrymen. But being now near home, where a retaliation might be feared, he had affumed fo genuinely the femblance of contrition, that in the fpace of my fhort abfence, the feid’s full forgivenefs was obtained, and the promife of future union. On feeing me, the feid feemed embarrafied, but faid nothing, and while I was preparing a flender fupper, my attention was roufed by a loud noife of altercation \ B b 2 from ■196 FORStER’S TRAVELS. from the Ghilan quarter, where I faw a furious debate waging be tween the members of the new alliance. The old pilgrim foon re turned to me, entreating with many confeffions of his credulous folly, to occupy his former Ration. On the 25th, completed, in a journey of five furfungs, the paffage of the foreft, and halted on its weftern edge. This day we frequently crofled the Mazanderan river, which, after winding in various directions, takes a north weft courfe through the flat quarter of the province, and falls into the Cafpian fea at Mufchid Sir. This ftream is rapid among the hills, but fordable for laden horfes. And on reaching the plains, it flows with an eafy current. At a toll-houfe within the fkirt of the foreft, the merchants paid a fmall duty, and I was aflefled a few pence, on the fcore of being a ftranger. In my way through this extenfive foreft, I did not fee the vef- tige of a habitation, nor any culture, except fome very narrow ftrips of land, thinly interfperfed at the bafe of the hills. But the vallies now opened and exhibited a pleafing picture of plenty and rural quiet. The villages all open and neatly built j the verdant hills and dales, encircled by ftrearns of delicious water, prefented a fcene that gave the mind ineffable delight. The air, though in winter, was mild, and had the temperature of an Eng- lifh. climate in the month of April.

Many of the Ruffians with their officer went to the Perfian feaft, where they were fuddenly feized and put into confinement. Aga Mahomed then affedled to exprefs much refentment at the conduct of the Ruffians, in having erected without permiffion, fo large and folid a building in his country. It was in vain that the Ruffian expatiated on the treachery of the a£t, and fo glaring a violation of hofpita- lity. He was refolutely anfwered, that unlefs his men were di rected to demolifli the building, the party fhould be detained in prifon, and perhaps meet with a worfe fate. The commodore dreading the effects of this threat, difpatched the neceflary orders to the fquadron ; and when the work was performed, he and his companions were releafed. The officer was foon after difmiffed from the command of the Cafpian fquadron, and baniihed from the court. The emprefs feverely cenfured his breach of military conduct, which on account of youth, and a regard for his family, file obferved had not been noticed with the Vol. II.

Aga Mahomed lately received an addrefs from the Ruffian government, threatening him, it is faid, with a fevere vengeance for the infult offered to their flag, unlefs he made a fpeedy atonement. But it does not feem that this chief is dif- pofed to fliew any refpedt to the requifition ; and if credit is to he given to a general rumour, another defcent on Ghilan may be foon expedled, the probability of which is corroborated by a pro hibition of all intercourfe with the inhabitants of that province. On the 27th, we left Sari, and proceeding five furfungs, through a country interfperfed with plain and foreft, halted on the fkirt of a wood near the high road. At half the diftance. of this day’s journey, croffed a fordable ftream, which runs to the left or north-weft, and falls into the Mazanderan river. The carriers were flopped at the paffage, and ordered to convey on their horfes a quantity of ftones, and place them in certain fwampy parts of the great road, leading from Sari to Balfrofh; which, it is faid&gt; was firft conftrudled by Shah Abbas, and ap pears to have been cut through a foreft. At three miles to the fouthward of odr laft night’s halting place, we paffed through the fmall village of Alhabad, which has a daily market well fapplied with bread, cheefe, and fuch provifions as are. adapted to the refrefhment of travellers, for the ufe of whom it feems to have been wholly eftabliihed. On the 29th of January, our party arrived at Balfrofh, four and a half furiungs. The road this day was the worft I ever hadFORSTER’S TRAVELS. had travelled on, and required, in the winter feafon, continued labour to make it paffable. Though deep ditches are extended on each fide and drains cut acrofs, to carry off the extraordinary moifture of the foil, we proceeded with much difficulty and ha zard, The carriers at certain Rations, were required to deliver their refpedUve portions of Rones, and the defaulters, among whom I was claffed, were d&lt; 'ained by the officers of government 5 here I might have incurred a bug delay, had not the Ghilan feid inter- pofed his good offices for me as a pilgrim and his friend. It was then foon feen in what a favourable light we were beheld. Our hands were even kiffed in token of reverence. The proprietor of my horfe having no religious virtues to plead, and his quantity of Rones being found very infufficient, he was not permitted to pafs; and while he with many others were endeavouring to qualify the demand, the feid and I agreed to proceed to Balfrofli, that we might be fheitered againR the weather, which this day had fet in with drifts of fmall rain and a fevere cold. In high anticipation of the pleafures in flore for us at the V % . . . . . ... capital, we were overtaken by the carrier, who foaming with rage, at this my fecond defertion, as he termed it, accufed me of an at tempt to Real his mare. Nor was his paffion allayed, until I promifed him a large difli of pill aw, to be ready at his arrival *r in Balfrofh. At the diRance of two miles on the fouth fide of the toWn, is feen a fmall ifland in the river, where Shah Abbas eredted a C c 2 palace, ■81 ■real204 FORSTER'S TRAVELS. palace, whofe roof with the bridge of communication, has lately been applied by the governor of Balfrofli to fome domeftic pur- pofes. After paying double the ftipulated hire, and the fine in pillaw, I difcharged the carrier who, like all thofe of his profef- fion within my knowledge, was an arrant knave. But knavery conftitutes a grand branch of his profeffion, and does not heavily affedl the purfe of the traveller, who if he wifhes to journey on with comfort, and have his name puffed, fhould heartily feed his carrierand as the common nature of man re quires indulgence, occafionally wink at his roguery. Not to go vern too much has been a maxim of long Handing in the po licy of nations, nor is it lefs neceffary to the welfare and quiet of domeftic ceconomy. At Balfrofli I was informed that three Ruffian veffels were lying in the road of Mufchid Sir, and would fail in a few days to Baku.* It now behoved me to a6l warily, and to wind up with difcretion an adventure which had hitherto been fucceis- ful, and had at this place reached a crifis, which. muR either produce a happy, or a dangerous iffue. To this period I had aflumed, with good fortune, the Mahometan character, without which, the journey I think could not have been performed, es pecially from Turfhifh to the Cafpian fea. I had been admitted, without referve, into the foeietv of Mahometans, and had lived at * A port on the weftern coaft of the Cafpian fea* theFORSTER'S TRAVELS. zo '5 the fame board with the moft zealous and fcrupulous, fome of whom, being now on the fpot, would, on a difcovery of my perfon, inveterately refent the deceit. It was firft expedient to quiet the mind of the feid, who lodging in the fame apartment,, mull neceffarily become acquainted with my departure. Telling him that I was going to make a pilgrimage at a tomb,* much re- forted to by the Perfians, in the vicinity of Mufchid Sir, and leaving a few things which would be ufeful, I bade him adieu with an air of unconcern, yet breathing a filent, fervent wifh, that this old man, whom I was never to fee again, might expe rience every good in the difpenfation of providence. Musing on the fcenes which of late had been fhifted with a rapid diverfity, and on the Angular, yet interefling connexions which I had formed in the courfe of my journey, I travelled- on to Mufchid Sir; a fcattered village, fituate on the eaftern bank of the Mazanderan river, about ten miles diftant from Baifrofh, and two from the Cafpian fea. On feeing the Ruf fian quarter, I fent back a horfe which 1 had hired, and pre fen ted myfeif to a perlon who was pointed out to me as the mafter of a Ruffian veffel; but he did not underftand any lan guage that ! fpoke. To obviate this embarraffment, an inter preter was called in, and being informed that he was a Ruf- * The place of interment of a fon of Mouza Kazim, one of the twelve Imaums #f the Perfians. flans iF O R S T E R ’ S TRAVELS. Engl : fian, I related my ftory without referve; that I was an gentleman, who from motives of curiofity and pleafum, hac travelled from Bengal, through the northern parts of Ina and Perfia, and that I now intended to proceed by the way of Ruffia to England. The linguift expreffed furprize at the relation, which he feemed to doubt 5 but a repetition, accompanied with that con fidence which only arifes from truth, noticing alfo that I was enabled to reward any good office, gave my relation credit, at leaft with the Ruffian. The mafter agreed to convey me to Baku, whither his veffel was configned; and obferved, that the command ing officer of a frigate lying at that port, would give the neceffary direflions for my future procedure. The matter being thus hap pily arranged, I was invited to partake of a mefs of fifh-broth, ferved up in a large wooden bowl; of which the mafter, fix or feven failors, and myfelf, made a hearty meal; to me it was a re gale ; both from its being really a favory one, and from the manner of participation, to which I had been long a ftranger. The Ruffian habitations at Mufchid Sir, are rudely conftruc- ted, and far from being clean. The fides are about five feet high, and compofed of branches of trees, twifted between flakes, ftuck at fmall diftances in the ground'; and the roof is of thatched ftraw. The furniture, equally Ample and coarfe, confifts of fome narrow wooden beds, a long board, raifed in the centre to eat at, and a few ftools, or buckets inverted to fit on. But the pradtice of living207 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. living hard, in all its variations, from eating Rale barley bread to deeping on fnow, had formed me into a complete veteran, fo that Lne Rufiian cabin, with its affemblage of rough utenfils, was to my fight a garniflied hotel. And the knife, wooden fpoon, and. platter, luxuries of a fuperior order. In the fir ft days of my refidence at this place, I fenfibly expe rienced a refrefhment of mind and body. I had been accuftomed to rife in the morning before day-break, with my hands and feet genearlly benumbed with cold, when after packing my baggage, I was obliged to take a part in the bufinefs of the camel-driver or the carrier ^ nor did the end of the day’s journey, often bring with it more than the bared: accommodation, or afford me much matter of intellectual gratification. But thefe inconveniencies were all done away, and my meals as my fleep, became falutary and regular. Being thus iclieved from labour, anxiety, and the inceffant tafk of fupporting a feigned character, I thought myfelf happy, and as happineis largely arifes from companion and the excurfions of fancy, to which I now gave an ample fcope, this was perhaps the molt pleafur^able period of my life. The Calpian fea prdented a grand fcene, and its waves dafli- ing again ft the fhore, produced with a delightful found, the ex ulting retrofpedt or dangers paffed ^ yet I endeavoured to check this ruing tally of prefumption, ill fuited to tlie nature of man, by confidermg that the accomplifhment of my journey was greatly promoted by a train of events,, m which my own exertions had but- _s FORSTER’S TRAVELS. bat a trivial fhare. Common tradition, and certain ideas which are arbitrarily located in the minds of moft men, had figured to me a Ruffian, tall, robuft, of a fierce afpedt, of barbarous man ners, and uncouth deportment. In fhort, truth obliges me to fay that I had ever affimilated the idea of an urfa major with a native of Ruffia, and it would have been equally difficult to have fepa- rated thefe figures in my mind, as meagernefs from a French man, or corpulence from a Hollander. But I muft crave par don of the Ruffian nation at large, for this and other erroneous opinions which I had formed of it. In the firft inftance, I law that the Ruffians were evidently of lower ftature, than moft of the northern people of Europe, and generally had the thick form of a Tartar, with his broad vifage. Thofe w'ho are not in the fervice of government, encourage the growth of the beard j they wear a long outer veft, which is faft- ened round the middle with a girdle ; their Hurt, like that of the Mahometans, hangs over the breeches, which are Ihort, and they ufually wear boots. Their hair falls loofely down the neck, and they cover the head, when abroad, with a cap or bonnet, which is taken off in the houfe, and in the interchange of courtefy. They poffefs an addrefs and fuavity of manners, even in ordinary life, which would not difgrace men of a much higher clafs, among nations deemed the moft polite. The entrance of a Ruffian into a room at firft furprized me; for, inftead of noticing any perfon in it, he uncovers his head, and with an air of humble reverence, offersFORSTER'S TRAVELS. icg oilers up a prayer to the pi£ture of the virgin and an infant Jefus, which is exhibited in the mod confpicuous part of every apartment. Having performed this ceremony he falutes the com pany, and at departure he obferves the like ufage. I am by no means empowered to afeertain the virtual opinions which the Ruffians entertain of their national religion, or to what extent they may operate in a moral tendency j but I can with confi dence fay, that their exterior obfervance of religious duties is ac companied with a reverential attention ; and is void of that fan- taftic mummery which has thrown a ridicule on many parts of the Romifh worfhip. I had not long been a member of the Ruffian fociety, when Hadji Mahomed appeared at Mufchid Sir. On perceiving him, I was impreffed with an involuntary dread, and had my creed admitted the tenet, I fhould have feen in Hadji Mahomed my evil genius. Retiring to the houfe I waited with anxiety for the iffue of his operations, which I knew would be hoftile to my wel fare ; when, after fome little time the mailer of the veflel coming in, informed me that the hadji had made many enquiries about my fituation, and fpoke of me in terms of regard. The Ruf fian expreffed much furprize at hearing me lament this intelli gence, which he faid, ought to give me pleafure, as Hadji Ma homed was a perfon of eminent note at Mazanderan, and might affift me in procuring a pafsport, without which I now learned no perfon could leave the province. A ftorm now began to Vol. II. P d threaten210 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. threaten me from all quarters ; the perfon who had been my firft in terpreter, was not as he faid, a native of Ruffia, but an Armenian ; and with a treachery not uncommon to his tribe, had cuculated among the Perfians of Mufchid Sir, the information he had been entrufted with, embellithed with many fabiications of his own; as that I poffeffed much wealth in money and'jewels, and that I was a fpy. This ftory obtained a general credit with the Ma hometans, efpecially with Hadji Mahomed, who began to con trive plans of deriving an advantage from my troubles. The niafter of the veffel feeing the popular cry ftrong againft me, be came. fearful of giving me fhelter ; for it is neceffaiy to men tion, that the Ruffian traders, chiefly a low clafs of people, are expofed in all parts of the government of Aga Mahomed to fe- vere oppreflions and infult; but which an advantageous traffick has induced them to overlook. And Aga Mahomed knowing the caufe of their forbearance, preferves no decency in his con- du£l to them. The Ruffian now acquainted me, with manifefl: fymptoms of fear, that were he to receive me without a paffport, his veflel and cargoe would be confiscated. The principal freighter of the bark, Abbas Ali, a native of Baku, had fhewn me from my firft arrival at Mufchid Sir, much kindnefs, and feemed defirous of relieving my embarrafiment. He expreffed a farrow at the fe- rious difficulty in which 1 was involved, rendered, he faid, the more perplexing by the ill defigns of the mafter of the veflel, ' , ^ whoFORSTER’S TRAVELS, 21 X who was a perfon of a bad character 5 but be of good comfort, continued he, “ for I will be your friend, and do not on any pretence entruft your property to the Ruffian.” This advice came in convenient feafon, and teftified that Abbas Ali knew this man ; for on the following day he addreffed me in a long ha rangue, fetting forth that the Perfians had received intelligence of my poffeffing a valuable amount in fpecie and jewels, that my own knowledge of thefe people would naturally point out the infecure Rate of both my perfon and effects, and that an ear ned: regard'to my welfare, had induced him to requeft that my property might be depofited in his charge, until the departure of the veffel. But the counfel of Abbas Ali, not a little ftrehgth- ened by the prefent propofal, determined me to be the keeper of my own cafh. Either the refentment of a fuppofed want of confidence in him, or the difappointment of fome finifter purpofe, gave the Ruffian a fenfible chagrin ; and from that time he continued to treat me with rudenefs and negle£L That 1 might retire from the view of the people at Mufchid Sir, who were now in the habit of accumulating unfavourable conjectures of me, I defired to go on board the veffel, and remain there until fome method might be adopted to leave the country with permiffion 5 and the mafter having confented, though with much reluCtance, to my embarkation, I departed fecretely and without any impediment; From the Ruffian quarter the diftance is about a mile and a D d 2 half212 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. half to the mouth of the river, where the force of the fea has raifed a long and (hallow bar, navigable only by boats and (mall light veflels; but when the wind blows ftrong from the north, the paffage is wholly impraflicable.

I NOWFORSTER’S TRAVELS. 2I 3 I now learned that the Ruffian whom I have hitherto termed the mafter, was not a mariner, but an agent* who is appointed to manage the commercial bufinefs of the veffel and diiburfe the failing charges. The crew confifted of a mafter,‘f* termed boats- man, his mate, fix mariners, and a cook j who from their pay and final! trading priviledge provide their own diet. The Ruf fian feamen among whom I was known by the name of Gre- goree, from its near refemblance to George, treated me with a cordial hofpitality; nor muft you imagine that I was demeaned by an unreferved aflbciation with thefe men, whofe habits and mode of life admitted of no difcrimination of rank. I fat down at their board without fcruple ^ indeed with thankfulnefs; and they never omitted to prefent me with the higheft ftool, the bell fpoon, and with wheaten-bread, while they themfelves eat that of rye. Some tea and fugar,^ purchafed from an Armenian, ena bled me to breakfaft alone in the cabin, which I occupied with the boatfman, who (hewed a ready attention to all my little wants,' and became as agreeable a companion, as the want of language would admit.

It now appeared that obflinate difficulties were thrown in the way by the cuftom-mafter at Mufchid Sir, who filled his office with equal vigilance and rapacity. Seeing me from the unfavor able predicament in which I flood, a profitable game, he diredled that I (hould be immediately lent on fliore, there to be detained, until the chief’s pleafure fhould be known. As this man only wanted fome of my money, and would have been difappointed by my formal departure from the country, I made him, through the medium of Abbas Ali, the Baku merchant, a fubftantial offer, but delayed the payment till the time of failing, that no lecondary de mand might be preferred.

Knowing that an interdi&amp;ion had been laid on all inland pailengers, and that the difpatch of the Rulfian had been withheld for the fpace of twenty days, to accom- plifh fome purpofe of government, I was aware that a certain rifque was incurred by the Perfian, whom I propofed to indemnify by a proper compenfation ; but I alfo obferved that if he per il (led in the refufal of all private negociation, I would myfelf proceed to Sari, and relate my ftory to the chief, and he well knew that no benefit would accrue to him from the decifion of his mafter. This argument was completely efficient, and when reinforced by fome of my Hindoftan gold, permiffion' was given me to purfue whatever way I liked, except that of Sari. - Before I leave this quarter of Perfia, I will lay before you a brief account of its geography, with curiory obfervations on its former and prefent commerce, and its relative policy with Ruflia. Mazanderan which occupies the centre of the fbu- thern fhore of the Cafpian fea, has Afterabad on the eaff, Ghi- lan on the weft, and to the northward it is bounded by the eighteen feet, and has the head and form of a (hark.

The rice of Mazanderan is of an excellent quality, and com- pofes the ufual food of the people, who find it difficult in their marfhy lands, to cultivate a fufficient quantity of wheat for com mon confumption, and that produced is of a coarfe fort. The bread ufed by the higher claffes of inhabitants, is made of the flour of Shirwan, a confiderabie amount of which is annually imported at Mufchid Sir. This deficiency is in fome degree, com- penfated to Mazanderan by the growth of fugar, which though of an inferior kind, is' adequate to moft of its common ufes.

An inhabitant of Aflracan, I am informed, came into this pro vince for the purpofe of eftablifhing a manufadtory of fugar, but failing in his project, no future experiment has been made e Were the Ruffians {killed in the procefs, they would be enabled^ by the importation of raw fugars, to fix in their country an im portant and lucrative commerce. Mazanderan alfo produces a fmall quantity of filk, which is fabricated by a fociety of Jews; but its principal trade is maintained by a frequent intercourfe with the port of Baku, which receives white and coloured cali coes, cotton, and rice, and returns bar iron of Ruffia, faffron, flour, and remnants of broad cloth procured from Aftracan. The commerce of this quarter, which now does not employ more than four or five barks, might be largely extended, did a greater har mony exiit between Aga Mahomed and the Ruffians 3 efpecially were the manufacture of fugar increafed. The Periians have long attempted to navigate the Cafpian fea, though with little fuccefs; their veffels are open, rudely con- ftrufted, and ill managed, feldom leaving the coaft but in the fea- fon of fair weather; many of them are fitted out at Farabad, an Vol. II.

This town in the Euro pean topography of Mazanderan, bears the appearance of note, and gives its name to a province; whatever might have been the former importance of Farabad, and it is noticed with refpect in Perfian hiftory, little teftimony of it now exifts. The province of Afterabad, lying on the the eaft fide of the fouthern Cafpian ftiore, affords little produce for a foreign trade; and it enjoys a refrelhing temperate air, and is beau tifully interfperfed with hill and dale, and abundantly fupplied with ftreams of falubrious water.

Nor will the Ruffians, while they enjoy fuch important benefits from Ghilan, fail to give him fupport. The filks of Ghilan are exported to Aftracan, chiefly through the medium of Armenian merchants, fubjefts of Ruffia, who poflefs the larger fhare of the Cafpian commerce. It was long believed that the filk brought into Europe from Turkey, was all produced in the Ottoman empire : but fince a more con- verfant knowledge of Perfia has been obtained, it appears that the Turkifh merchants were ufed to refort to the provinces of Ghilan and Shirwan,* whence they tranfported large quantities of this commodity to the European factories of the Levant. The Pei flan filk trade continued to flow in this channel, until the year 1739, when the Ruflia Company of England having procured the fan6tion of Parliament,*^ fent their factors into Ghilan to eftablifh a commerce, which fhould have for its ob ject the purchafe of filk, and the vent of Englifh manufa6tures.

On the 17th, we got under fail, and a(Tifted‘by a favorable wind, we anchored on the 22d, about ten leagues to the north ward of the port of Baku; and on the 24th, reached the en trance of the harbour, when the wind which had been blowing ftrong from the eaftward, fuddenly changed, and came from the land with extreme violence; but the vicinity of the fhore kept the fea down, and probably prevented our deftrudion.

The province of Shirwan produces a large quantity of filk, of which about four hundred tons are annually imported at Aflracan; faffron of a good quality is alfo produced there, and conflitutes a valuable article of trade. A focietv of Moultan Hindoos, which has long been eftablifhed in Baku, contributes largely to the circulation of its commerce; and with the Armenians they may be accounted the principal merchants of Shirwan. The Hindoos of this quarter, ufually embark at Tatta, a large infular town in the lower tra£t of the Indus, whence they proceed to Bafforah, and there accompany the karavans which are frequently palling into Perfia; fome alfo travel inland to the Cafpian fea, by the road of Kandahar and Herat; but the number is fmall, and they grievouily complain of the oppreffions and infults of the Mahometans. On the 31ft of March, I vifited the Atafhghah, or place of fire; and on making myfelf known to the Hindoo meridicants, who refided there, I was received among thefe fons of Brimha, as a brother; an appellation they ufed, on perceiving that I had ac quired fome knowledge of their mythology, and had vifited their moft facred places of worfhip. This religious retirement, where the devotees worfhip their deity in the femblance of fire, is a fquare of about thirty yards, furrounded with a low wall, and contains many apartments ; in each of which is a fmall volcano ofFORSTERS TRAVELS, 229 of fulphureous fire, ifluing from the ground through a furnace or funnel, conftrufled in the form of an Hindoo altar.

On clofing the funnel, the flame is immediatly extinguifhed y when a hollow found is heard, by applying the ear to the aperture, ac companied with a ftrong and cold current of air, which is inflamed at pleafure by placing near it any illuminated matter. The flame is of a pale clear colour, without a perceptible fmoke 3 and emits a vapor ftrongly impregnated w th fulphur, which confiderably impeded my refpiration, until by fitting on the ground I brought my head lower than the level of the furnace. The Hindoos had a wan emaciated appearance, and were oppreffed by an he£lic cough, which continued to affeft me during my flay at the Atafhghalu The ground within the enclofure, abounds in this fubtenaneous air, which iflues from artificial channels * but in thefe con- trailed fpaces, it feems only capable of producing flame by the application of a foreign fire. Exclufive of the fires pertaining to the Hindoo apartments, a large one arifing. from a natural cleft in an open place, inceflantly burns, whence it would feem that no extraneous objeil is required to impart an illumina tion to the larger evaporations of this air. On the outfide of the wall are feen many of thefe volcanos, which have the ap pearance of lime kilns, and one of them is conveniently adapted by the Hindoos to the ufes of a funeral pile. The general fpace whichFORSTER’S TRAVELS. 230 which contains this volcanic fire, forms a low flat hill flanting towards the fea, the foil of which coniifts of a fandy earth inter mixed with {tones.

Int the defcription of this natural phenomenon, I have can- tioufly adhered to the Ample fa£f, without prefuming to dil'cufs its caufe or properties.

The black naptha or bitumen, is produced in the fame manner as the the white, but more abundantly and on larger pieces of water, and with a fcum three or four inches thick, of the confiftence of tar. The houfes of Baku moft of which have flatFORSTER’S TRAVELS. flat roofs, are covered on the top with this material, which is found a.fubftantial defence againft the rain; and when formed into fmall cakes or balls with a mixture of fand, is commonly ufed by the lower clafs of people as a fubftitute for the fuel of wood, which in this province is thinly produced. This quarter of Shirwan in afpect and the nature of its foil, refembles the province of Khorafan; there is the fame want of wood and large ftreams, and in the winter the air is equally bleak I , and piercing ; with the ditference that in Shirwan it is fubjeft to fogs, which, I apprehend, are caufed by the vicinity of the Cafpian fea. The foil yields abundant crops of good wheat and. 1 barley, the bread of which conftitutes the food of the common people; the higher ranks only are enabled to procure rice, which is chiefly imported from Mazanderan and Ghilan. The mutton is fat and well tafted, being of the large tailed fheep, and is fold at the rate of one penny and three halfpence per pound. Ap- ✓ pies, pears, grapes, and chefnuts, all of a good kind, are pro duced in plenty.

Old Shahmachee, the former capital, is fituated about feventy miles inland of Baku, and for its trade, wealth, and population, was, after Ifpahan, ranked among the moft fiourifhing cities of Perfia. To punifh a rebellion, which the inhabitants had raifed againft the government of Nadir Shah, this city was rafed and depopulated; but that the empire might not be deprived of a mart, fo happily placed for foreign commerce, that prince formed about ten miles to the fouth-weft of the old city, a new Shah- machee.* Fultah Ali Khan, the chief of Shirwan, reiides ge nerally at Derbent, but he gratifies a rapacious difpofition, by making frequent circuits through the province, which he feverely harrafles.

Human nature takes a portion of its prominent features from national prejudices, from education, and from government; nor mu ft we exclude climate from its fhare of the formation. This remark arofe from a view of the Atafhghah at Baku, where a Hindoo is found fo deeply tin6lured with the enthufiafm of religion, that though his nerves be conftitutionally of a tender texture, and his frame relaxed by age,* he will journey through hoftile regions, from the Ganges to the Volga, to offer up a prayer at the ftirine of his God.

When the mercantile property of Mr. Hanway, was plundered at Afterabad, that gentleman prefered his complaint in perfon to the fhah, who directing an inveftigation into the account, iffued an effe6tual order on the governor of the province for a full re- ftitution of the effects or the amount. In the vigorous attempts, which this prince made to introduce the European art of navigation and fliip-building into his country * he evinced a genius rarely found in the mind of an Afiatic. It was his intention, by the aftiftance of John Elton, to ere£t fortified Rations on the eaft fide of the Cafpian fea, that a flability * Frazer’s hiflory of Nadir Shah..might be given to his conquefts in Khieva, and the Tartars checked in their depredations on the province of Afterabad. After Elton, had, with vaft labor, completed the building of a veffel, in which he encountered obftinate difficulties, as well from a jealoufy of the Perfians of his rifing favor with the fhah as difguft at an irkfome fervice; he was directed to examine the Tartar ffiore of theCafpian, and to make choice of an eligible fituation for a fettlement. But the coaft, according to the report of Elton, being found deflitutc of good water, the defign was relinquiffied. Nadir Shah, contrary to the general diara£fer of the Perfians, who are impreffed with a more perfecuting fpirit than any other Mahometan nation, gave a common toleration to the wor- ihip of the inhabitants, whether Chriftians, Hindoos, or Jews, and largely retrenched the power and wealth of the priefts, who during the latter period of the Suffuee dynafty, had engroffed the chief diredlion of government. That Nadir might incapacitate their revenge for the death of the moliah Bafhi,* who had been ex ecuted for refufing affent to a plan of this prince for introducing the Sooni religion into Perfia, and to accommodate other falutary purpofes, he demanded an account of the vad: revenues which had been affigned to the church; they informed him, according to the tenor of Frafer’s relation of this event, that their property was applied to the ufes, for which it had been allotted ; in falaries for * High-prie-ft. theFORSTER’S TRAVELS, the priefts, in the maintenance of numerous colleges and mofques, in which prayers were inceffantly offered up for the fuccefs of the arms of the prince, and of the profperity of the Perfian empire.

It appears that Saadut Khan, the brother of the regent, took Baf- forah*f from the Turks after a year’s fiege; and during the Per- fian government of that place, Kareem Khan gave diftinguiflied indulgencies to the Englifh refidents eftabliflied there, whofe fac- tory and property, when the city fell into his poffeffion, were fully fecured to them. The adminiftration of Kareem Khan, was involved in a feries of hoftilities againft the Turks and Arabs, over whom, except the capture of Bafforah, he obtained but trivial advantages. At the period of the regent’s death, which happened about the year 1778, Saadut Khan was Rationed with a fmall force at Bafforah, and folicitous of fpeedily reaching Shiraz, the theatre of a&lt; 5 lion, he abandoned Bafforah, which again ac knowledged the powder of the Turks.

Ali Morad, who has cftablifhed the feat of his government at Ifpahan, took Shiraz in 1778, or 1779, at which period, a gentleman of my acquaintance refided at Baf- forah, and has fince communicated to me fome tracts of the - hiftory of Kareem Khan, and of thofe chiefs who appeared in a&lt; 5 tion after his death. This gentleman whofe veracity and difcerning judgment may be confided in, draws a melancholy picture of the fouthern provinces of Perfia. He fays, that the inteftine feuds and com motions gave a pretext for the perpetration of every crime dif- graceful to human nature, and produced fuch daring a£ts of flagitioufnefs, that the people refembled demons rather than men. It was ufual, he fays, for one half of the inhabitants of a vil lage, to keep watch at night, that they might not be murdered by the other, which if not equally vigilant became fubject to a fimilar fate. But enough of this fcene of blood, which degrades our race below the beafts of the field, and permit me in my defultory manner, to convey you again to the banks of the Caf- pian. It having been already noticed, that the dominion of this fea is veiled without competition in the empire of Ruffia, which has alfo obtained a Itrong influence in fome of the bordering H h 2 provinces.FORSTER’S TRAVELS provinces, it may not be foreign to rational enquiry, to exa mine the Rages by which Ruffia has arrived at this acceffion of power. In the year 1722, Peter the Great was folicited by Thamas Khan, the fon of the Shah Huffeyn, to aflift him in expelling the Afghans from Perfia, who had driven his father from the throne, and continued to hold poffeffion of an extenfive portion of the kingdom’; and to ftimulate Ruflia to the grant of this aid, the Perfian prince ftipulated to cede in perpetuity the provinces of Ghilan and Shirwan. This propofal being acceded to, Peter, accompanied by the emprefs Katherine, embarked at Aftracan with a large force, and proceeding along the weft coafl of the Cafpian, landed at Agrechan, in the province of Min- grelia, about two hundred miles to the fouthward of the mouth of the Wolga; from thence he moved to the relief of Derbent, which had been befieged by the Afghans, and Rationing a party of three hundred men in the caflle, advanced a day’s march into Perfia; where he was met by the deputies of Baku, and Shah- machee who fought his protection againfl the Afghans, then making flrenuous exertions to reduce thefe places. Peter was preparing to undertake the fervice, when a Tur- kifh envoy arrived in the camp, and reprefented, that his maRer having annexed Shahmachee to the Turkifh dominion, was much difpleafed at the appearance of a Ruffian power in that quarter.FORSTER'S TRAVELS, and that unlefs the emperor withdrew his forces, he was directed to declare war againfl Ruffia. Peter having lately felt the fuperior ftrength of the Turks in the unfortunate campaign of Pruth, and being then in a fo reign country, deftitute of the refources neceffary for commen cing hoftilities againft fo powerful an enemy, he confented to. a peaceable return to his own dominions. The Turkifh envoy ac companied the army to the northern limits of Perfia, where he remained until it had embarked for Aftracan. The party which had been lodged in the fort of Derbent did not join the army in its retreat, but at the felicitation of the inhabitants conti nued in that Ration, until the Ruffians at a future period ap*» peared on the Cafpian, while thofe of Baku deprived of the hope of fuccour, received a body of Afghan troops into the town, and lubmitted to the government of Ifpahan, The Ruffians had contracted a fin all fort on the river Mill a Kenti, in the territory of the Lefghi Tartars, and garrifoned it with five hundred men, who after the departure of the grand army., were attacked by a large Afghan force and wholly deftroyed^ Peter, it is faid, loft in this expedition, a third part of his troops, by ficknefs, fatigue, and onfets of the Lefghis; a lofs the more mortifying, as it was then attended by a fubverfion of the faiir guine proje£l he had formed, of extending, his conqueft into the interior provinces of Perfia. It appears that this event was followed in a fhort time, by246 FORSTER’S TRAVELS. an ultimate and formal convention, between the courts of Con- ftantinople and Peterfburgh, which ftipulated that Shahmachee, the territories of Armenia, Georgia, and Melitaner, fhould be held permanent appendages of the Port; and that Peter fhould be left at liberty to profecute his defigns on the provinces of Perfia, bordering on the Cafpian fea. In the latter end of the year 1722, the Perfian chief of Ghilan deputed an agent to Aftracan with powers to deliver up Refhd, the capital of the province, to a Ruffian garrifon, fhould it be immediately difpatched to the relief of the city, then invefted by the Afghans. The emperor affenting to the meafure, difpatched by fea a thoufand men to Ghilan, but on their arrival they were refufed admittance by the inhabitants, who alarmed at the delay of the aid, and threatened with fevere vengeance if they formed any connexion with the Ruffian government, had en tered into a negociation with the Afghan officer for the fur- render of the city* The Ruffian detachment formed an entrench ment on the fea-fhore, where it remained until a reinforcement of four thoufand men came from Aftracan, with orders to force an entrance into Refhd 5 but this fervice was not found neceffary, for on the arrival of the additional force, the gates of Refhd were immediately thrown open, and the whole province of Ghi lan became fubjedt to Ruffia. The officer who commanded the auxiliary troops, had in his paffage down the Cafpian, touched at Baku, where he was diredledFORSTER'S TRAVELS. 24? dire6ted to lodge a garrifon, conformably to a previous requi- lltion of the Perfian governor, but the fuccour arriving too late, the place had fubmitted to an Afghan army. Peter anxious to acquire fo valuable an acquifition, difpatched in the courfe of the following year, 1723, a ftrong naval arnament from Aftracan, which entering the port of Baku,* took the fort after a fhort bombardment. It is faid that previoufly to this fiege, the Per fian s had never feen a mortar, and that when the Ruffian bomb- ketch was warped into its ftation, they ridiculed the attempt of fo fmall a veffel preparing to attack the fort; but the de- ftruflion of the buildings, and the carnage which enfued, fpee- dily converted their contempt into afionifhment and fear. These leading lines of the progrefs and eftablifhment of the Ruffian power on the Cafpian fea, are largely borrowed from the memoirs of a captain Bruce, who ferved in Peter’s army during the firft Perfian expedition, and who feems to have made his obfervations with an accurate judgment j he has certainly related them with fimplicity and candor. His documents alfo correfponding with the information which I collefted in Per- fia, this Iketch is laid before you with the greater confidence.

But when this me teor of the eaft had blazed forth, and in its courfe confumed or difmayed the furrounding nations, the Ruffians then invol ved in domeftic commotion and intrigue, were compelled to eva cuate their Cafpian dominion, with only the permi(lion to hold a refident at the fea-port of Enzillee, for the management of the XBhilan filk-trade.* Fultah Ali Khan, having within thefe late years, enga ged in a defultory warfare with the Lefghi Tartars, fought the affiftance of the Ruffians, who after repelling the incurfions of the enemy, held for fome time poffieffion of the fort of Derbent. It has been again reftored ; but the conditions are not known, though we may infer from the policy of the court of Peters- burgh, which is not in the habit of retrenching its limits, that the caufe of withdrawing the garrifon of Derbent, did not pro ceed from mere motives of liberality. That your knowledge of this quarter of Perfia may be more complete and fatisfadlory, I have been prompted to annex in this * In the year 1746, an embafly was fent by the emprefs Elizabeth to Nadir Shah, a relation of which has been publilhed by Mr. William Cooke, who accompanied it in the capacity of a furgeon ; and at that time it appears that except the Enziile fa&amp;ory, ‘and a commercial refidency at Derbent, the Ruffians did not poffefs any eftablifhment jn Perfta, plac.’,4 \ FORSTER'S TRAVELS. 249 place, a furvey of the Cafpian fea made by Captain Bruce, in the year, 1723, by the order of Peter, after his return from Perfia. The relation of this furvey is deficient in the detail of bearings, and often of the foundings, nor is it known whether thefe remarks were ever recorded, or have been omitted by the publifher; but the information is much wanted, for except the Ruffians, other nations are ftill trivially acquainted with the coafts of the Cafpian fea 5 efpecially with that which confines Tartary. Captain Bruce fays, ' we received orders to go all round &lt;c the Cafpian fea to furvey and found it, and lay down in a 66 chart all the rivers,. creeks, and bays, with all the different “ foundings; and for this fervice, had one of the ftrongefl new a built galleys of forty oars, carrying two eighteen pounders in cc her prow, twenty four fwivels, and three hundred men, at- cc tended with four boats, two of eight oars, one of ten, and cc another of twelve, each boat carrying one fwivel gun; and £C two fub-engineers were appointed for my affiftants. &lt;c The 18 th of April 1723, went down to the mouth of “ the Volga,* and next morning proceeding from thence eaft- u ward, we paffed in very {hallow water along the coaft, fo C6 very overgrown with weeds, that we were obliged to keep at five or fix miles diftant from the fhore, in from ten to twelve * Forty miles below the city of Aflracan, I i Vox.
