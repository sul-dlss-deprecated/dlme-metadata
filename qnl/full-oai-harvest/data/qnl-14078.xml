(sister firm to Gray, MacKenzie and Company), a company that acted as shipping agent for British India steamers between India and Europe, via the Gulf ports.A number of buildings are seen in the photograph, though relative degradation of the image obscures much of the background and horizon area. A building under construction extends from the lower left of the image to the centre. Immediately behind this, the terrace of a flat-roofed building is fenced off. Next to the building under construction, and immediately below the centre of the image, bricks can be seen stacked high against the wall of an adjacent building.In the far right of the image, towards the horizon, a domed roof can clearly be seen amongst the flat-roofed buildings. Although the dome is windowless, a smaller dome with openings to allow light to filter through sits atop it. This is possibly a bath house.InscriptionsLower right, in pencil, alongside image: ‘83’Below image: ‘The Town looking South from Gray. Paul's Office. 23.
