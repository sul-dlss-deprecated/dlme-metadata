Printed in Karachi at The Commissioner's Press, 1898. The annual report concerns the conditions and administration of the region and the development of the Quetta-Seistan trade route and follows on from Ware's similar report of 1897 (Mss Eur F111/362).The report opens with a letter from Ware to the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan, Quetta, dated 18 June 1898, in which the main points of the report are summarised. The report itself consists of four appendices, as follows:I 'On the Administration of the Nuskhi, Chagai and Western Sinjerani Districts', with information on the history of tribes, water-supply for irrigation, lands, crops, and revenue (folios 4-12)II 'On the Quetta-Seistan Caravan Route' (folios 13-15)III 'Regarding the question of appointing Native Agents and News-Writers in South-Eastern Persia and the effect which such appointments would be likely to have on the present position in that country' (folios 16-18)IV 'Nushki Trade Returns for months April 1897 to March 1898', consisting of tables of statistics (folios 19-68).Near the back of the report are genealogical tables of the Nushki Jamaldini, Zagar Mengal Amirzai, Mandai, Sinjeranis of Chagai, Narui Baluch, and Rekis of Mirjawa (folios 69-71).Folio 73 is a map of the area covered by the report.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Assistant</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Nushki</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Seistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Quetta</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade routes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001491.0x000116#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
