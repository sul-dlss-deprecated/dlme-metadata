# DLME Metadata

This repo contains records for the Digital Library of the Middle East (DLME) organized by stewarding institution and collection. Institutions have their own directories with collections as sub directories when the concept of 'collection' is used as an organizing strategy. If collections are not used, all records harvested from an institution will be in the same directory.
