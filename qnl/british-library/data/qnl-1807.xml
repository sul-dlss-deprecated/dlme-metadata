In previous years very few Bahrain subjects were employed by Brit ish subjects or foreigners; but owing to the coming of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, the number of persons eligible to register under this section is enormously increased. Now that the administration in Bahrain is stabilized, and a regular Nationality Law has been passed, this sub-section has, I submit, become obsolete, and may be omitted from the new Order. (11) Reference sub-section (e)t- In view of possible litigation between the Bahrain Petroleum Company and their employees, or ex-employees, I think that the Agency should avoid as far as possible any exchange of facili ties with Indian Courts, and should use the ar bitration clause in the employees contracts as the method of settling such disputes.

Throughout the Draft Treaty the words N His Highness 11 before the word '•Sultan'* are omitted.

A point arises as to whether the follow* ing words from Article 16 of the Draft Treaty should be added to the above draft of Article 8(2) of the Order in Council after the words 'His Majesty' :- 'Provided that if any such person should be charged with a crime the Consul will allow the charge to be tried by the authorities of the Sultan'.

It is a point for con sideration as to whether it would not be advisab^ perhaps by exchange of letters to clear up the question with the Sultan* Reference Article 8(4) and (5) * X think both these clauses can stand in view of Article 16 of the Draft Treaty.

Whatever the proper procedure in this respect under the 1891 Treaty I am con fident that the Sultan would never consent to the excercise of such power over his subjects by the Political Agent as would appear to be assumed by the words in question and for this reason 1 suggest they be omitted from the Article in the new Order in Council. If this suggestion is aj^roved the first portion of fee sentence of clause 44(2) will require modifying and this might then read as follows: • •Provided that the Muscat subject or person not subject to this Order, if so required by the Court, first obtains and files in the proper office of the Court the consent, in writing, of the competent authority (if any) on behalf of his own nation to his submitting his case N . ^ fVA Reference Article 44(4) .

Unlike a Treaty to which the Sultan is a Contracting Party atd who therefore has the right to state what his title should be, the Order in Council is an Order framed solely by His Majesty's Goyern- ment.

A note is enclosed in explanation of certain Articles of the draft,which is 'based generally on the recently revised Qatar Order in Council. Attention is specially invited to the anendments introduced in Articles 17, 18, 42, 54 o: 55 to meet the conditions obtaining under the new Treaty. 2# The Muscat Order of 1915 (as well as later Orders, including the recent Qatar Order) provides in several places that certain things are to he done ''by the Secretary of - iMi -in i - i State, or, with his previous or subsequent assent, the Governor General (of India in Council)'. The practical utility of this provision in the circumstances of to-day, when communications have greatly improved, is not apparent. Moreover, the phrase is considered open to certain formal becretary to the Government of India, o'bjections/ External Affairs Department, Simla.ctojections; in so far as it relates to 'previous' assent it v/ould seem preferable at the oiitset to decide which of the two authorities should 'be responsible, v/hile in so far as it relates to 'subsequent' assent the provision is defective in that there is nothing to validate actions performed 'by the Governor-General under it for which the subsequent assent of the Secretary of State is refused (cf. the provisions of Article 85(l) of the draft Order relating to the issue of King's Regulations) . Accordingly an endeavour has 'been made to eliminate the phrase from the draft, and in Articles 14, 18, 27, 39, 78, 79, 80, 85 and 89 the phrase has loeen amende d, provisionally and subject to the views of the Government of India, so as to specify either the Secretary of State or the Governor General as the only competent authority. The omission of the reference to the Governor General in certain of these amendments would not of course affect the normal procedure 'by which references v/ould 'be made to the Secretary of State through the Government of India, whose views would therefore he available to him at the same time. * I am to request that having regard to the Y assurance given to the Sultan in pursuance of the y Secretary of State's telegram of the 26th January^ No. 178, the Government of India in consultation with the PoO -itical Resiaent may furnish their views as early as possible on the draft Order. It is not considered necessary to consult the oultan in respect of any provisions of the draft Order* the sole ooject of which is to give effect to the powers of jurisdiction ceded by him within the limits defined in the recently concluded Treaty and in the lettersexchanged with reference to Article 15 thereof. There is no evidence here to suggest that the Sultan's predecessor was consulted/I f 3. consulted 'boforo the issue of the 19;.5 0rdei? and this is in accorc.ance with the nom&amp;l procedure in cases v/here a clearly deiined cession of jurisdiction has 'been agreed upon 4.

A drafting amendment has also 'been incorporated. Art. 26: An addition has 'been made to sub-article (l) to provide for the rcnov al of persons from within the limits of the Order.

The reference in 44 (2) and 45(2), lines 2-6, to the obtaining of consent to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court has been omitted as unnecessary, the Sultan having agreed to the exercise of jurisdiction. Sub-article (4) of both Articles has been omitted as no longer relevant - see Article 13(2) of the Treaty, in view of which a new paragraph has been inserted (54(3) and 55(5)) . Art. 59. A revised form of Art. 49 of the 1915 Order. u-'' Artcs.69 and 76: It is proposed in these Articles to omit the provision in Articles 57 and 67(1) of the present Order that a person or company shall not be entitled to protection unless registered, on the ground that no one has a legal rip:ht to protection; it is a matter of discretion always, and moreover in some cases protection cannot be refused, whether the person has registered or not. i.rt. 77: Article 60 of the 1915 Order has raised doubts, particularly with respect to para, (b) , which may hav e/ I .\ ) ^ n *y 4. have the effect of penalising the person not subject to the Order with whom the transaction has 'been made. The views of the local authorities are desired on the question of retaining the .article in whole or part. It may 'be that para (a) is still of value. i/hen the article was proposed ' in 1913 it was stated by the 'critical Resident (vide enclosure to Government of India Foreign Department despatch No* 108 of the 16th October 1913) to embody the provisions of Muscat King's Regulation No. 1 of 1903 'which have worked satisfactorily for the pest ten years and which have served materially to reduce litigation regarding land or household property, by providing for an effective system of registration of changes in ownership thereof.' If the retention of para (a) is desirable it might be retained and para, (b) simply omitted, as in the draft? Arts. 16 and 82. Some doubt has been felt rs to the necessity for retaining these articles, since both the Political Resident and the Political Agent have consular authority (and this will presumably remain true in the event of the transfer of the Residency to Bahrain) and therefore already have the powers referred to in these articles. schedule. This is subject to scrutiny by the Government of India.GOVERNMENT OP INDIA.

(b) The entry relating to the Indian merchant Shipping Act may be recast as follows •So much of Part IY of the Indian Merchant Shipping Act, 1923- 2 - P 1925 (Act. XXI of 1923), excepting sub-section (3) of section 213&gt; fi'S relQ.t€;£ to pil^riJii Article UU) (c) In view of the modification au^gestea at (b) above article il{2) (i) U) 18 superfluous. (a) part IV of iict jll L of 1923 there is no reference to 'Provincial Government'' ana hence the rule of construction in iirticle li(2)(i)(b) for that expression seems meaningless. 4Rain, it appears that a ruie of construction for ^British India'^ with special reference to Uas Act, is unneceaaary. un the other hand, followiufe the usual pracirice in applymg British imian enactments to aomimsterea areas in Indian States, a few general rules of construction ap r lying to ail trie enacUitents mentioned in the Scheaule to tne Oraer voula be useful.
