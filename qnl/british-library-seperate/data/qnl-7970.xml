The Resident suggested that the orders could be amended or rescinded, in order to remove the Persian right to search vessels in territorial waters.The rest of the file contains correspondence thereon between the India Office Political Department and the Admiralty, plus reports by the Commander-in-Chief of the East India Station, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of seeking to amend the proclamations.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references found within the file by year.
