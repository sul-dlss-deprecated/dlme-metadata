This part contains papers regarding proposals for the improvement of the Persian Gulf Quarantine Service. It therefore contains discussion between British officials over the provision of finance, personnel, and equipment to facilitate improvements. The supply of stoves (for Jask, Bundar Abbas [Bandar-e ʻAbbās], Lingah [Bandar-e-Lengeh], Mohammerah, Bushire, and Bahrain) and a Clayton disinfection apparatus by the Government of India accounts for a significant amount of correspondence. Some discussion surrounding possible threats to British control of the Quarantine service can also be found in the file.Printed copies of the minutes of the Sanitary Council for the Empire of Persia are included for the meetings: 29 June 1907 (folios 141-143), 5 August 1907 (folios 144-145), 2 September 1907 (folios 133-135), 4 November 1907 (folios 81-83), and 2 December 1907 (folios 84-86). These documents are written in French. A note from Dr Jean-Etienne Justin Schneider, President of the Sanitation Council, on proposed improvements to the Quarantine Service can be found on folio 196-198. This note is also in French.Printed copies of telegrams regarding a plague outbreak in Bahrain in 1907 can be found between folios 183-187.Towards the front of the file are a small number of papers related to a proposal to withdraw the mobile assistant medical officer – posted to Bushire under the improvement programme – from the Persian Gulf in 1909.The main correspondents are as follows: the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir Edward Grey), HM Minister at Tehran (Sir Cecil Arthur Spring-Rice), the Chargé d'affaires at Tehran (Charles Murray Marling), the Under-Secretary of State for India (Arthur Godley), and officials from the Foreign Office (Louis Mallet and Sir Walter Langley). Occasional reference is also made to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Major Percy Zachariah Cox) and the Government of India.Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Quarantine Service</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sanitation Council of the Persian Empire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Disease control</topic></subject><subject><topic>Personnel</topic></subject><subject><topic>Quarantine</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sanitation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000010#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000010#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
