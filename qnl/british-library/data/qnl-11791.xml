It is situated about 70 miles south-east of Baft and about 80 south-west of Bam. It consists of a prosperous settlement inhabited by people of the Mehni tribe, with many hamlets in the vicinity. The mdlidt of the district in 1902 was 12,000 tumdns. There are some 20 families of nomads, belonging to the Anal tribe, in the district.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1894 ; Sykes, 1902.) ISFAREH— A village in Kirman, situated on a tributary of the Hanza river, 18 miles from Babur, on the road to Rayin. It possesses a garden containing apples, pears, almonds, etc., and is surrounded by a con siderable amount of cultivation. The inhabitants own a few cattle, donkeys, sheep and goats, and there is a plentiful supply of good water from a small rocky stream.— (Massy and Medley, 1894 ; Sykes, 1900.) ISFID or ISPID (St. John's Maf)— A village in Kirman, the first halting-place from Khanu, on the road to Bandar Abbas. It is situated in a wide spreading plain covered with acacia and the Indian her trees ; also brambles and low bushes.— (Bo- zario ; Goldsmid.) ISFIZAR or ISFIZAR— Lat. 32° 52' 5'; Long. 59° 36' 45'.—(Lentz.) A village in Khorasan situated on the Kuh Muminabad, and 27 miles east of Birjand. It consists of some houses inside a fortlet, fixed in a commanding 'position ; and a few outside. The fort would, doubtless, be difficult to take if only infantry were employed, as its walls are very high, and it is not commanded in any way. It is now, however, going to ruin. The inhabitants are partly Shi’ah and partly Sunni. It has a few gardens and cornfields around it, with a good and sufficient supply of water from a canal. From Isfizar there are direct roads to Sarbisheh and Bujd on the Sistan road. The pass is said to be closed for several months during the winter.— (MacGregor ; Forbes ; G. F. Napier ; H. D. Napier.) ’ISlN— A village of 800 houses, 9 miles north of Bandar Abbas. The inhabitants possess 20 Martini-Henry rifles. Melons, mangoes, onions and other vege tables are cultivated. Livestock are : 1,000 camels, 900 donkeys, 100 cattle, 2,000 sheep and goats.— (Sher Jang, 1902.) ISK— A small village with one kdriz on the road from Nasratabad (Sistan) to Birjand about 7 miles south of Shusp. It contains about 4 families ('Abbas 'All, 1907.) ISMA’IL (Chah)— A village in the Shamil district (g-v.).264 ISP—ISP 17 miles from Kahlri (q.v.) and 12 from the crest of the watershed range, which is about 4,800 to 5,000 feet high. Sarbaz is about 16 miles The Ispatki road is the one usually taken by Jcafilehs and travellers from Bampur to Sarhad. It branches from the Kulani road at Kahm (q.v.). Leaving that place a ravine is ascended to the crest of the mam range, a n ascent Sf 1,100 or 1,200 feet in about five miles. Thence the road descends the bed of a watercourse, which, for want of a better name, may be called the Ispatki ravine. The gradient is evidently easy, there being a descent of 600 or 700 feet in about 12 miles. Lovett, who traversed this route on the 18th February 1871, gives no particulars whatever of Ispatki itself, but it is probably a mere halting-place in the ravine, with water, firewood and camel-forage in tolerable quantities. n , The hills through which this march lies are composed of clays, marls, and limestones, in vertical strata, with occasional beds of sandstone. I he vegetation is almost exclusively tamarisk and aloe 1 From Ispatki to Sarbaz the road continues to descend the ravine, water being found everywhere from 5 miles below the camping ground. At 10 miles from Sarbaz (6 from Ispatki ?) date trees and cultivation commence At 10 miles from Ispatki the ravine joins another from the north, by which the Kulani road (q.v.) descends. The two form the Sarbaz river which is followed for 6 miles to that place. It is broad and stony, with a small perennial stream. The valley is narrow up to Sarbaz, but both the banks are cultivated. The baggage of Sir F. Goldsmid s party (z.hh and 21st February 1871) followed this route by mistake, the officers of the mission having gone by Kulani. The servants reported the road “ very good, with the exception—and it is an important one—of two narrow gaps where the animals had to be unloaded. Lovett makes no mention of these or ol the nature of the road, simply remarking that it was confined to the river-bed .—(Lovett \ Evan-Swith.) ISPID —See Isfid. ISPIDAN, or ISFlDAN, KUH— Elev. 5,547'.—(&amp;/&amp;es.) Lofty limestone hills, nearly 60 miles east of Bampur, in Persian Balu chistan. They are part of ranges which divide the low-lying Bampur plain from the higher region about Magas, etc. Travelling westward from Magas the watershed is reached 3 miles beyond the halting-place known as Sar-i-Pahura or Sar-i-Fehruj (q.v.), that is, at about 16^ miles from Magas village. This watershed appears to be rather sharply defined, but is not very elevated, being only about 5,000 feet high, that is, some 800 feet only higher than Magas. Westward, however, there is a long descent through hills to the Bampur plain, which is everywhere _less than 2,000 feet above sea-level. The highest hills, as the Ispidan Kuh and the Humand peak, appear to rise from lower ground west of and apart from the watershed. This is certainly the case with Humand, but the eastern slopes of Ispidan perhaps drain towards Magas. ^ . St. John thus describes the country between the halting place of bar-i- Fehruj and Aptar in the Bampur plain. l No doubt pish —dwarf palm or palmetto (Ghamoerops Eitchiana).265 ISP—ITA ISPlDAN— A halting-place in the Bampur district of Persian Balhchistan, on the road from Bampur to Magas, Dizak, Jalk, etc. It is about 25| miles from Aptar (q.v.)&gt; almost the whole way ascending through hills by the bed of a torrent. There are springs, however, in several places, rising amid high and thick grass in side clefts, so the stage could probably be divided. The torrent-bed is from a quarter to one mile wide and in parts thickly wooded with tamarisk, both above and below the halting-place. Camping-ground on a level plot of turf at the foot of lofty limestone hills, called the Ispidan Kuh {see below). Supplies, nil. Good and plentiful water from a spring. Wood, grass and camel grazing, plentiful. The next stage to Sar-i-Pahura or Sar-i-Fehruj {q.v.) is about 21 miles crossing the watershed at 18 miles.—($C John.) ISPIDARANAGI, See Sapid rang!.

B. ott266 JAB—JAB f { J JABAL BAKHUN (Laristan)— A mountain 10,660 feet high, 42 miles north | east from Bandar Abbas seen from the sea between Kuh-i-Ginau and Jabal Shamil. It has three little peaks, and is covered with snow for many months. (Constable; Stiffe ; Persian Gulf Pilot.) JABAL BARIZ or JAMAL BARIZ (Range)—Lat. 28° 34' 24' ; Long. 58° 18' 44'. I A mountain range in Kirman, running north-west and south-east, and r forming part of the main orographic system of Persia. The name Jamal Bariz (or more properly Jabal Bariz) is applied in some maps to the whole of the great range which divides the hot country of Jiruft from tlm up lands of Rayin and Sarduieh, but this is erroneous, and the name is, strictly speaking, only applicable to that section of the range contaming the gr^at peak Amjaz, which towers above Dusari, and separates Jiruft from the district of Bam-Narmashir. To the east of this section is the Zurnak Pass, while the prolongation of the range beyond this is termed the Shah Savaran Kuh. The drainage from the north and north-eastern slopes disappears into the Shurgaz Hamun, while that from the southern slopes flows into the Halil Rud, and eventually into the Jaz Munan Hamun. Some of the higher peaks reach an altitude of 15,000 feet, or perhaps more. Many of the valleys enclosed in this massive wall of mountains are rich and cultivated and have large orchards. The hillsides are thickly covered with shrubs and trees of all sorts, amongst which are fine oak, fly cypress, Jcassar (Pistachio tereblntha), gwan (Pistachio mutica, ) gisthan (PeriUca aphylh), ba lam (Nerium odor urn), etc., and game is found in considerable quantities. _ . ^ „ Floyer, who travelled through this range m December 1876^by the bag- dar Pass, describes his ascent from a place called Dasht-i-Kush, a small arm of the Jiruft plain, at the southern skirts of the range as follows “ On December the 5th, we started at 6-40 a.m. winding along the foot oi the hills with a gradual ascent. Soon we^ travelled along the north* rn bank of a tributary of the Shur river, which, in spite of its name, was sweet enough, and, judging from the flocks of large white and black herons, con tained numerous fish. At 8-17 the Sargaz village bore 210 , distant 10 miles, and after a laborious two hours’ crossing the talus of a huge hill we turned up and a steep ascent began. The road was a shingly watercourse, flanked on either side by grand cliffs and masses of rock, sparsely covered with shrubs. I carefully observed the vegetation on this side of the range, ^ but I never thought, of finding such marked and characteristic difference between this side and the other as I did. One of the shrubs looked exactly like majguk (capital camel fodder), but it was as bitter as a bitter almond and useless to us. At 12-27 we reached the first summit, 5,770 feet across a shallow valley, and at 1 p.m. reached the second summit (barometer 24-45), 5,523 feet. There was a huge mountain on our right about 1,500 feet higher than we were covered with snow, across another valley. At 2 p.m., weJAB-JAB 267 reached the third summit (barometer 24-5), 5,469 feet. Then we crossed a sheltered valley swarming with partridges. At 2-30 we forded a rapid rushing bounding torrent, which, in the reckless way it dashed itself about, seemed to harmonise well with the wild desolate grandeur of the scene around. A misty rain made everything dim and wet, and our position on the very brink of a chasm 40 feet deep was not without its difficulties. This place, Sagdar, is the usual place for halting, and two deep but low caves close by had often been used as sleeping places. There was no fodder, the only tree being an occasional ban (much resembling Pyrus ter- minalis) and the shrubs being blackberries (Sagdir in Persian) and the omnipresent bdldm. To our surprise we found little patches of soil clear ed of rocks and sown with wheat. The people, it appeared, lived in the plains during the winter, and camped here among these grand hills in the summer. ” That night the minimum the thermometer registered was 36°. We were on the march by 8 a.m., and at 8-35 reached the summit of the Ushturan Gudar, or the Camels’ Pass, called, I imagine, on the lucus a non lucendo principle, for it is fearfully steep for camels. Here the barometer showed 6,780 feet. At 9-30 we passed a sort of oasis in the endless miles of rock in the shape of the Bag-i-asp-i-Isma’Il Khan. It is a large grassy mound, and it is re lated that when Isma’il Khan, father of the present Governor of Kirman, levelled and widened this road across the mountains, he personally en camped there for many days. Here the barometer showed 7,250 feet, and away to the west stretched an endless sea of mountains, range after range, gradually softening away into the distance. . Higher and higher we went, the barometer at 2 p.m. showing 8,070 feet at 2-30 p.m., 9,250 ; and at 3 p.m., 9,260 feet; while wet and dry bulbs were 49°, 51°, and a strong cold wind set in from the south-west. At 3-30 p.m. we reached our highest point, 9,310 feet, and at last saw our way before us. The road ran north down a steep short descent and lost itself in the thick oak scrub. Then far below it reappeared a dim line leading away across a broad desert plain running east and west, behind which rose a faint purple range, called the Darzin hills. About 35 miles to the west, half hidden in the clouds, ran a long dark blue ridge of moun tain. This is the Sardmeh route from the low-lying Jiruft plain to the high plateau. It joins our route at Kayin, but owing to its immense altitude above the sea is only practicable in summer, when it is generally preferred as being cooler, more direct, and having two or three caravanserais. Behind, softened by the'mist, lay the ranges we had just crossed, a sea of hills, here slightly clothed with oak scrub, and spotted here and there by a tall, dark cypress tree. , This is the part of the pass that gets blocked by the snow, which, as is easy to imagine, gets drifted into the ravine representing the road, and renders it impassable. At 4-30 1p.m. we finally reached flat ground again at a small grassy corner of the plain, which was of course fertile just in the immediate neighbour hood of the mountain.” —(Flayer ; Brazier-Creagh, 1894 ; Sykes, 1902.) 2 H 2268 JAB—JAF JABAL BlS or BRlSG (?)

A large -village in the Rudbar district of Kirman, 33* miles east-north- east ot Mmab, on the road to Manujan and Rigan. A village which occupies both banks of the Manujan river, consists of a deserted fort standing about J mile from the left bank and a fluctuat mg population which has been variously estimated by different authorities at from j 0 to 500 households. It probably varies largely according to the season of the year. The village possesses 60 ploughs, for each of which 11 Indian maunds of seed are sown, and two crops are raised annuallv one of wheat or barley, and one of tall millet, besides a little henna and mdigo. Irrigation is from the Manujan river. Chiraghabad, 3 miles to the south-east, is also cultivated by the inhabitants of Jaghin The inhabitants in 1899 owned 300 cattle, 20 camels and 50 donkeys and also formerly possessed 6,000 goats, but a Bashakardi raid in 1898 reduced the number of the latter to 1,000.

Wood from the Mur jungle in the neighbourhood is plentiful. There is good water in the river .—1893 ; Napier, 1899 ; Grey, 1905 ; Gibbon, 1908.) JAGIN (River)— A river in Bashakard, which rises in the Band-i-Marz, and draining the west central portion of the district, empties itself into the Persian Gulf. Considerable doubt exists at to the exact course of this river, owing partly to the small extent to which this part of the country has been explored, and partly to the habit obtaining in Persia of giving the san e stream a different name in the various districts through which it flows. For the first portion of its course it flows east-south-east, more or less parallel to the Band-i-Marz, and between that range and the Band-i-NashkI; east of Anguranit turns southwards, and roughly maintains that direc tion for the remainder of its course. It receives numerous tributaries, the most important of which, perhaps, is the Sharifi, which, coming from the north-west, joinsJt^ at Sapinchi. At Ending, where the river is crossed by the Jashk-Anguran road, it is 60 yards wide, and 2 feet 6 inches deep, with a current of 3 miles an hour. At this point the banks are sloping and stony, and the stream is said to be unfordable for a week at a time in the rainy season.—(Medley and Massy, 1894.) JAGISTAN— A village in Rudbar (q.v.) in Kirman. JAGTUM (Persian Baluchistan)— A rapid stream in Persian Baluchistan, crossed on the road from Jashk to Surag. It is 50 yards wide and 3 feet deep with banks^ 12 feet high. It is generally dry in v summer and autumn, but after heavy rains it becomes impassable, and sometimes overflows its banks. The country in the immediate vicinity is tolerably fertile. (Johnston.) JAHALl— A date-grove on the left bank of the Kaju river on the Bampur-Chahbar route 87 miles from the former.

A district in Persian Baluchistan, dependent on Dizak. It lies on the eastern borders of Persian territory, about 25 miles in a straight line north-east of Dizak, and about 10 miles north of, and parallel to, the Kalaghan valley. It consists of a cluster of date-groves, 4 miles long by 2 wide, encircling various villages and forts, and is irrigated by the Jalk river, which running out beyond the cultivated area into the open Mashkid plain, affords a supply of clear sweet water, far in excess of the requirements of the whole inhabit ed district. Sinking here into the ground, it comes to the surface again in the Mashkid date-groves, 30 miles away to the east, on the edge of the Hamm, and would probably be found a few feet below the surface in any part of the intervening plain. In the Jalk oasis are several domed buildings, mainly built of sun-dried bricks, which though known locally as the tombs of the Kaianian Maliks, probably belong to members of the Saffar family, who ruled for more than five centuries in Baluchistan—from about A.D. 867 to A.D. 1400. Among the date-groves are ten villages, arranged in two rows from west to east. In the southern row are— (1) Sirdak, 10 houses. (2) Sar-i-Kuh, 100 houses and fort. (3) Gitanuk, 15 houses. (4) Shishrlz, 200 houses and fort.272 JAL—JAL On the northern side are six villages— (1) Sindati, 30 houses. (2) Hushab, 20 houses. (3) Kuhkan, 1,000 houses, with a strong fort. (4) Dashtak (demolished by the Persians in 1902). (5) Nazarabad (or Kashan), 20 houses. (6) Chagird, 20 houses (it pays no revenue). Of the above, Chagird and Kashan belong to the Rekl tribe ; the remain der mostly to Arbabis. Kuhkan fort stands on a rocky ridge, 100 feet high, is in good preservation, and built in two parts, each independent of, and flanking the other. There are four Hindu baniahs in Shishriz and supplies are procurable in fair quantities. Fuel and grazing are plentiful in the hills south and south-west of Shishriz ; and fodder and bhiisd abundant. _ * The ordinary revenue for the district is 700 tumdns, but the Persians year by year increase their demands, thereby driving the people up to, and even beyond, the bounds of open rebellion, so that it is difficult for them to collect any revenue at all, except by force of arms. At Maskatu, near Jalk, there is a Customs frontier post under Sistan. Detail of Tribes in Jdlk district showing armed strength and residence {1909). Tribe. Fighting men. Rifles. Residence.

History.—It is said that Jalk was originally occupied by three tribes who came from Kashmir, namely the Baniahs (Hindus), Buzurgzadehs (Kureshi Saiyids) and Arbabis, while by popular election a Buzurgzadeh was appointed their ch ief and ruler, the duties of the position being carried on for manyJAL—JAL 273 generations by members of the same family, one of them succeeding to the Governorship of Kej, when Ahmad Shah, Euianl, held sway at Kabul. In 1737 Nadir Shah seized Kandahar, and at the same time sent a detachn cnt of his army, under Generals Hr Muhammad Khan and Latif ’AH Khan— both Kajars—to Jalk. At this period Mir ’Abdulla Khan I was cnlv ten years of age, his father having but lately died. The headmen of^Jalk assembled, and collecting several valuable presents, went out to pay their respects to the two generals, but owing to the tender years of their sardar they did not take him with them. The generals were incensed at the non-appearance of the boy, and refusing the presents, ordered him to be brought before them. The headmen begged that he should not be summoned as he was but a boy. The generals replied : “ Then bring his mother Eibi Chandan ” (by name). But she declined to come, saying she was 'pardanashin (a woman who does not appear unveiled before men, excepting near relatives). This further incensed the two generals, and all J alk assembled to give battle to the Persian army. A great and bloody conflict ensued, the result being that the whole of the Buzurgzadehs men, women, and children,—excepting one woman named Shahr Banu, and Mir ’Abdulla Khan and his younger brother Nawab Khan, were massacred. These three were the only survivors of the Euziiig- zadehs then in Jalk. Nawab Khan had been carried ofl to Kej before the battle (how Shahr Banu escaped is not stated); while Mir ’Abdulla Khan w aa carried back a prisoner to Kandahar, together with several Hindus and: Arbabis. At sight of the boy, Nadir Shah’s pity was kindled, and he released him as well as the other prisoners, and sent them back to Jalk in safety. Hem this time onwards, Jalk and Kalaghan continued to pay a yearly cash revenue of Rs. 600 to Kandahar. Mir ’Abdulla I in due course died, and was succeeded by his son, Mir Haidar Shah. The latter ruled but for a short time, and on his death 9 was succeeded by his son, Mir ’Abdulla IT. A short time after the latter had succeeded tc the Jalk sardarship, Shah Mihrab, Baranzai Kiyani,* a resident of Dizak, was appointed Governor of Bampur by order of the Shah ; and he was directed to march against Jalk and compel Mir ’Abdulla II to pay revenue to Persia, acknowledge the Shah as his suzerain, and give up his allegiance to Kandahar. ^Mir Abdulla declined, stating he was a subject of the Amir of Afghanis tan. A battle ensued between the Persian troops under Shah Mihrab, on the one side, and the people of Jalk and Kalaghan., under Mir ’Abdulla II. on the other. Mir Abdulla was killed, and his people utterly routed, while Jalk and Ka 1 aghan were formally annexed by Persia. This was some 80 years ago. Owing to internal troubles in Afghanistan, no help was sent from that quarter, and no attempt has since been made by that country to re-conquer these districts. * The Kiyam. are the second dynasty of the Shahs of Persia. 611. B. 21274 JAL—JAL Mir ’Abdulla II was succeeded in the sardarship by Mir NaVab Khcn. The latter was a son of Mir Isa, who was a great-grandson of Mir Mihrab Khan, the fourth sardar of Jalk. At this period Mir Alam Khan (father of Sardar Dilavar Khan, of Eizak) conspired with Mir Gajian, Naushirvani (the father of Shirdil Khan, of Kalaghan, and own brother of the famous Sardar Azad of Kharan) to depose Mir Navab, and being successful, they killed him. This treachery appears all the blacker, as Mir Navab s wife was Mir Gajian’s sistei. On Mir Navab’s assassination, the people of Jalk elected Mir Maddat Khan, son of Mir ’Abdulla II, as_sardai\ He, in revenge for the death of his cousin, killed Mir Gajian. Sardar Azad Khan of Kharan, on hearing of the assassination of his brother, marched an army of Naushirvanis against Mir Maddat Khan to exact vengeance. Mir Maddat Khan being quite helpless and unable to cope with Azad Khan, gave BalaKalat (the then largest village of Kalaghan, vide account of that district) to Azad Kh§.n in settlement of the blood-feud, and the latter returned to Kharan, no blood having been shed. Shortly after this, Mir Alam Khan succeeded is seizing Mir Maddat Khan by treachery, and sent him to Bampur, where he eventually died as a prisoner. Mir Alam Khan then seized Jalk, which, together with Kalaghan he constituted as part and parcel of his own district of Dizak, and since that time they have formed simply sub-districts of the latter. Thus Mir Alam Khan w r as the tenth hakim of Jalk, and the fifth hakim of Dizak, i . e ., since the time of Niamatullah (see account of DIzak), and this was the first time that one man ruled both Dizak and Jalk. After the blood-feud between the now deposed Mir Maddat Khan and Sardar Azad Khan, by the cession to the latter of Bala Kalat, a great friendship had sprung up between these sardars, and in consequence Azad Khan was much enraged at the seizure and deposition of Mir Maddat Kh .n, especially so, as Mir Alam Khan refused to recognize his rqht to Bala Kalat. The result was that Azad Khan marched an army against Kalaghan, raided that district, and partially destroyed the fort of Liji. This happened about 1857 A.D. _ . . . From that period till his death, Mir ’Alam KhSn. resided in Dizak and his son Sard&amp;r Dilavar Khan in Jalk, whence he, under his father, ruled that place as well as Kalaghan. On Mir ’Alam Khan being gathered to his fathers, Dilavar Khan succeed ed him and took up his residence at Dizak, while he in his turn has been succeeded by his son Mir ’Abdulla Khan, who was sardar in 1902, under the nominal overlordship of the Governor-General of Persian Baldchistan. # ... , The authority of the latter, however, in the outlying border districts or his province, is a very shadowy one, and can usually only be insisted on by force. In 1902, Persian troops visited Jalk and destroyed the forts of Hushab and Dashtak, but on the advice of Major Showers, the Political Agent of Kalat, left those of Kuhkan and Shishriz untouched. It may here be mentioned that in 1896 a Boundary Commission under Colonel Sir Thomas Holdich, visited Jalk, and delimitated the frontier east of that place, by which the much disputed date-groves of Maehkid fellJAL—JAM 275 within the British borders.

It is a warm tract of plain coun ry. lying between parallel ranges north and south, many parts of which are clothed with low jungle. As it possesses a mild climate and abundant pasturage, it is resorted to in winter by many small tribes who occupy the mountain districts at other seasons. It possesses only four or five collections of huts, which can be termed villages, each possessing a small mud fort as a place of refuge, but seldom inhabited: these are Sarjaz, Du Siar or Sarah, Kaleh Nau, Kaleh Pish. The rest of its unsettled popu lation reside in little groups scattered over the plain. The heat is so great in summer and the flies so numerous that it is almost wholly deserted by the tribes, who return to the mountains of Jamal Bariz. The lands yield grain, millet, pulse, beans, rice, cotton, henna, palma-christi, and dates ; and some pa ts a ! e of great fertility ; from five to thirty fold being spoken of as the return for barley and wheat. In the middle of January when Abbott visited it, green crops of barley, high enough tc be cut for the food of cattle, were standing in the fields. Sheep, goats and horned cattle, and their produce, butter and wool, are advantageously purchased here. The flocks yield lambs twice a year. The regular revenue is stated to be about £1,450, but is nearly doubled by local impositio s. The jungle and reeds with which this plain is clothed in parts abound with game, such as the francolin, the partridge, known as Jarufti {perdrix Pondicereanus), and the wild hog. The boiling point of water on this plain is 209°, and the thermometer at 10 a.m. on 22nd January was 81° in a tent and at noon 86°. Floyer in 1876 says that the whole of this fertile plain is inhabited at, from a rough estimate, the rate of about a village of two hundred people to every 10 miles square. Carpets are made in the villages in this plain, but the patterns are all simple zig-zag, and the colours not brilliant. {Abbott ; Kinnier ; Floyer.) JiSHJtfNA or OLD JASHK—Lax. 25° 38' 50'; Long. 57° 46' 40' The administrative capital of the Jashk district and residence of the chiefs ; it is situated 7 miles north of New Jashk and 1 mile inland from the shore of Jashk West Bay. The village is completely sorrounded with date-- groves. It expends over a squ re mile. The chief points of interest are the ruins of a Portuguese fort, which is a mere debris of ruined walls, saidJAS—JAS &lt;277 to have been battered down by Mir Yusuf, with an old gun lying half buried in the ground: and a zldrat called Shah Mardan, which is much frequented by Baluchis. There are about 10 mud houses and 150 mat huts. Some of the houses are of a fair size, and there is a house of considerable preten sions belonging to Muhammad Sahib. The population may be estimated at 800 souls, of whom rather more than half are Baluchis ; the remainder are Shaikhs, Jats and slaves. There are extensive date plantations and sufficient fields for the needs of the inhabitants. Dates, wheat and arzun are cultivated, and to a lesser extent cotton and barley. The village possesses 200 camels, 50 donkeys, 60 cattle and 300 sheep and goats. Water is from two wells, 8 feet deep, and is muddy but sweet. The inhabitants are chiefly agriculturists, except some weavers called Julahag. They deal also carpets called zilu and Ichirsak, date-mats called tah, firewood and which they export to Qishm island and to the Arabian coast, specially Batmah, their trade relations being chiefly with these places and with the ersian districts of Bashakard and Minab. Boats are obliged to anchor, about !,OOO yards from the shore, as the bay is very shallow. The trade with Masqat is now insignificant. Some silk embroidery is done by the women and fishing nets are made. The administration is noticed in the article on Jashk district. There is good partridge shooting, and some hares are obtainable.—(Aormer, 1906 ; Craufurd, 1910.) JASHK NAU or NEW JASHK— A port of Persian Makran and station of the Indo-European Telegraph . e P art n i ent; it is situated on the promontory which ends south-westwards m Jashk point and lies about 140 miles south-east of Bandar Abbas 145 miles no_rth-north-east of Masqat and 290 miles west by north of GwSdar. Ihe Jashk peninsular divides Jashk East Bay on the one side from Jashk West Bay on the other, and is itself nearly cut off from the mainland by a winding creek which runs inland from the western bay at a place 3i miles northwards from the tip of the promontory. The land on which New Jashk stands is low; the upper stratum consists of a loose sand mixed with clay and the sub-stratum of hard calcareous matter, chiefly a shelly conglo*- ^mate of the place is extreme, the thermometer, which may fall to ; * alire nheit m winter, sometimes rises to 110° in summer, and the heat^is rendered more trying by the moistness of the atmosphere, the mean humidity of wffiich exceeds 70 per cent, of saturation.

The peninsula has two other small points not far from Jashk-i-Sar upon its eastern side ; the nearer to Jashk-i-Sar is called Damilan and the other Kurazi. A quarter of a mile to the north of the tomb are the telegraph buildings and British military barracks, and at a similar distance beyond them again upon the shore of the West Bay is the ordinary landing-place adjoined by a mud fort, which is the property of the Persian Government and being no longer required for executive or military purposes is now occupied by the local Director of Customs. Still further north, on the west side of the promontory, begins a date-grove called Maksa a mile in extent when there is and a large mansion with badgirs owned by a private merchant, but sometimes used for the accommodation of persons subject to quarantine. New Jashk is divided into two parts, namely the European station, with a native settlement depending on it, and a Persian village which surrounds the Persian fort. In the European station reside all the members of the telegraph estab lishment with their families and servants. The Persian village consists of 45 mud houses and date-leaf huts; it is inhabited by Baluchis, Saiyids, Mulais, Kaisis, Maids who are fishermen, and Negroes who are either labourers or domestic slaves: in addition to these there are some natives of the Mlnab district and other Persians, also a large number of half-breeds of various kinds. Except the Persians all the inhabitants are Sunnis, and of these two sects are represented, the Baluchis being Hanafis, aud the Saiyids Shafi’is. The Persian, Baluchi, Arabic and Hindustani languages are all spoken and some of the people understand a little English. The inhabitants of the native village are mostly traders, agriculturists, graziers and fishermen Agriculture is now at a low ebb, in consequence of a succession of bad seasons ; and a formerly considerable trade, especially by the Saiyids, in goods imported from Karachi and Bombay, has declined since the establishment of the Persian Customs pest. No statistics of the volume of the trade are available, but its character may be inferred from the remarks on trade in the article on Persian Makran. New Jashk is a fortnightly place of call for the steamers of the British India Company, and is the chief port of Persian Makran after Chahbar. Six native vessels ranging from 18 to 28 tons’ burden and trading only to the Arabian coast, belong to this port.JAS—JA 8 279 There are anchorages suitable for steam-vessels on both sides of the Jashk promontory in which shelter can be found from all but southerly winds * the customary berth is in the West Bay about 2 miles from the landing-place.* Native boats use the creek already mentioned as leading out of the West Bay ; the course is winding, its length 4 or 5 miles, and it has some depth of water inside, but the bar is almost dry at low tide. The resources of New Jashk are inconsiderable. Water, which is brackish, is from wells, the best being situated 1 mile north-east of the telegraph station : rain water also is stored in tanks near the telegraph buildings. Food-stuffs and even vegetables during the recent bad agricultural years have been mostly imported from India and Bandar Abbas. Live stock amounts to about 200 cattle and 200 sheep and goats ; there being no fodder, there are no transport animals and some of the residents who own camels keep them at old Jashk. The telegraph station is an important one. The staff consists of 10 or 12 Luropean clerks under a Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent and there is an Assistant Surgeon in medical charge of the establishment/ The inspecting officer of the land-line from Gwadar to New Jashk also has his head-quarters here. The Jashk office is connected with Karachi by a cable ; with Chahbar, Gwadar, Pasni, Ormara, and Karachi by a two- wire land-lme ; with Masqat by a cable ; and with Bushire by two cables, one of which runs direct, and the other via Hanjarti. The principal instru ment is generally in use for the direct transmission of messages between arachi and Tehran, the current being reinforced at Jashk and again at Bushire : from 500 to 1,000 messages pass in the 24 hours, in one direction by day and in the other by night, this being arranged in alterna tion with another line. The telegraph office and quarters form three blocks of substantial and commodious flat-roofed buildings. For the protection- of the place a detachment of 50 sepoys of the Indian Army under a Native officer are posted at New Jashk and are accommodated in well-built’barracks capable of containing double the number. The head of the telegraph station is also political representative of the British Government at New Jashk and as such exercises jurisdiction over British subjects, and deals with the Persian officials and local author- Xties under the orders of his superior, the Director at Karachi. rhe Persian Imperial Customs establishment consists of a Mudir and 4 armed guards, locally recruited. The Mudir has his abode in the Persian fort near the landing-place. Apart from these Customs employes the Persian Government has no agents at Jashk. The quarantine arrangements are in charge of a British medical officer of the telegraph station, on behalf of the Persian Government. Authority over Persian subjects in the settlement is exemsed by the Mirs of Oid Jashk whose position is described in the article on Jashk district. JASHK (District)— The Jashk district is a division of Persian Makran and most of the genera! remarks contained mthe article on the coast of that region apply to it without modification ; a brief notice in this place will consequently suffice.280 JAS-JAS Limits.— Jashk district extends from Kuh Mubarak (or rather the Mainahi stream 1 mile north of Kuh Mubarak), on the west nearly to the Sadaich river .on the east ; inland it meets the Bashakard district at about 50 miles from the coast. Our attention w ill, however, be confined to the plain which here, as elsewhere in Persian Makran, skirts the sea and reaches to the outer hills that rise some miles inland. Physical characteristics—The remarks under this head in the article on the Persian Makran coast hold good of the Jashk district, and need only to be supplemented by a slight description of some of the principal natural features. These are given below, in tabular form, in order from west to east :— Name. Kuh Mu barak.

Rises 70 miles from the coast in the Bashakard dis trict and reaches the sea 60 miles east of New Jashk. A river near the coast which is dry in summer and autumn, but after heavy rain becomes impassable and over flows its banks. Or dinarily it is a rapid stream 50 yards wide and 3 feet deep with banks 20 feet high, which are in places i mile apart. The water is good. A river somewhat resembling the Jagin but with low banks which at 10 miles from the coast are | mile apart. A large river which overflows its east bank in the mari time plain during high rises. The water is sweet. At 4 miles from the sea, the Sadaich re ceives a tributary called the Haimin, on its right bank, and at 6 miles from the sea another called the Gilik on its left; the latter has a tributary called the Raiku, which enters it on its left bank, 5 miles from its junction with the Sadaich. These smaller streams contain water after rain only and their banks are low and ill-defined. The river is sometimes im passable for 5 or 6 and even for 10 to 15 days. In the plain there is a thick belt of tamarisk and acacia jungle on both banks. Near its mouth are two man grove swamps called Janakani and Nazai sepa rated by a plain 7 miles wide. The chiefs are said to derive revenue from the creek formed by the mouth of the river. They impose dues on the boats which call to collect man groves. After entering the mari time plain this river has a sandy bottom abound ing ^n quicksands and the banks are lined with tama risks and acacias. Between the Jagin and Gab- rig rivers is another smaller stream called the Slrameh. The mouth of this river is a tidal creek with a shallow bar; the coast on the east side of it is swampy and on the west bare white sandhills, called Surap, in which water can be obtained by digging, extend along the beach for 6 miles.Name. Position. Nature. Remarks. Slramch stream. Between the Jagin and Gabrig rivers, nearer to the former. Resembles the Shahr Nau above. This stream has a number of small tributaries, it is dry except after heavy rain. Before leaving the subject of physical conformation, we may note that the coast of the Jashk district is in general low and marshy. From Ras-al- Kuh to the mouth of the Jashk creek the shore consists of a narrow strip of sand, in places bearing tufts of grass, which has mangrove swamps behind it and in places is penetrated by inlets, Khur Hamid, 9 miles east of Ras-al-Kuh, being the most considerable and to some extent frequented by boats. At New Jashk there is a short interval of well-defined coast; and east of this again mangrove swamps, with creeks which are visited only for fish- ing and cutting firewood, resume their course, till the Surap sandhills are reached near the mouth of the Sadaich river. Population .—The inhabitants of the Jashk district are comprised in the population described in the general article on the coast of Persian Makran. The Hots may be regarded as the dominant tribe, inasmuch as the chiefs are of their number. The total population (including hill-villages) is roughly estimated at 22,000 souls, the fighting strength of the first line, that is of men armed with modern rifles at 500, and that of the second line at 3,000. The population of the coastal strip with which we are concerned is about 9,000 souls. Agriculture, live-stock and fisheries :—For general information under these heads the Persian Makran article may be consulted. Additional details will be found in the topographical table at the end of the present article. Trade, communication, supplies and transport—Thz reader is referred to the remarks under these heads in the articles on Persian Makran and New Jashk and to the topographical table at the end of this article. Administration: Jashk district is governed on the same general principles as the other districts of Persian Makran described in the article on that region. There are two joint chiefs or Mirs of Jashk, Mustafa Khrn and Mir H5ti who reside at Old Jashk and are relations : the former is the principal chief. These chiefs belong to the Hot tribe. No tribute is pay able by them to the Persian Government, but they collect for their own benefit several taxes, notably a general land-tax which produces about 1,500 tumdns per annum, a poll-tax of 10 krdns yearly on all men of substance and traders, a poll-tax of 2 riydls a year on male adults in the villages of Luran, Behai and Kuh Mubarak and a tithe or Dahyakl on grain produce and dates. In the fishing season they also receive 10 riydls on account of every fishing boat and take annually 15 camels under the Baluchi title of Gurjawi, Some of the slaves of the chief con* stitute a sort of police force. The political institution of the greatest importance in the district is the British telegraph station described in the article on New Jashk. The284 JAS-JAS Persian Government is now unrepresented save by a Mudir of the Imperial Customs and his subordinates posted at New Jashk.

It is uninhabited but visited by fishing-boats.— {Constable ; Stiffe ; Persian Gulf Pilot.) JA.Z MURG— A village in the Rudbar district of Kirman, situated on the lower reaches of the Halil Rud. It consists of 100 huts with some cultivation and flocks- Supplies can be procured in moderation. It is said to be the fourth stage from Ramishk to Rigan.— {Brazier-Creagh, 1894,, from native information.) JAZ MURGHAB— A village in Kirman near Shahabad (g.v.). J^Z MURlAN HAMUN— It may here be remarked that in several dialects of Baluchi, also in Kurdi, “gaud ” and “zireh,” and “hamun ” all possess identically the same meaning, viz., ‘ ‘ low, level ground surrounded on all sides by somewhat higher ground. ’ ’ As a rule, all large hdmuns receive rivers of sweet water, but their banks are unapproachable for miles owing to deposits of salt (wet salt and sand, called “ kalar ” in Sind and the Punjab), while generally after rain these hdmuns are immense salt lakes covered with rushes, grass, and water-fowl. These hdmuns receive drainage from all four directions, and their waters never rea&lt;5h the sea. The Jaz Murian Hdmun lies between Bampur and Khanfi, and receives the drainage of the Bampur, Halil, Kahn Rud and Kuhistani Rivers ; also the drainage from the northern slopes of the Aspan Kuh, Ramishk Kuh, Patarun Kiih and Marz Kuh ; as well as that from the south-western slopes of the range running south-east from the Jabal Bariz range. Its extent as shown on the map is misleading. The swamp ground is locally called sarog or halar (soft, sand and salt), and the entire ground between Kalanzau on the east and Zeh Kalut on the west is liable to inundation during the rains. Between these two spots is the actual limit of the swamp, making it some 50 miles by 20. Sykes states that there are two separate ‘ ‘ chils ’ ’ (ponds in which water is collected before being run off into the fields) called Milan and Jihun respectively, from which, by error, Jennings named the whole hdmun, which is really only known as the Jaz Murian or Haunt of Birds. It is a sweet water lake, in which the water remains permanently only between Kalanzau and Gumbaz. During and after the rains there is a large swamp in the vicinity of Jaa Murian, but in the hot weather it is mostly dried up. The fact that all the kdfileh routes converge on KalanzaQ and Zeh Kalut, goes to prove that its length of over 100 miles, as given on the map, is erroneous.— {Jennings, 1885; Brazier-Creagh, 1894 ; Sykes, 1902.) JEH KAUR— A small stream which is crossed at 3 miles from Maskhfitan, on the ioa d to Bampur. It runs eastward. 2K2292 JEH—JJR From here low ranges, Baggink, Gasnmal, and Band-i-Lagi are about 3 miles east. The route here lies over hard gravelly and sandy plains, thinly covered with jungle.— (Floyer.) JlAND— A well in Sarhad, 3 miles north-west of Nudu, on the road from Ladgasht to Ladis. The water is fairly plentiful and good.— (Showers, 1902.) Jl jlAN or JlJUN— A village in Qishm island (q.v.). JIRUFT— A small district and plain consisting of the upper reaches of the Halil Bud. It is bounded on the east and north by the Jabal Bariz range, which running up to 15,000 feet in height divides the hot country of Jiruft from the cold uplands of Rayin and Sarduieh and Narmashir. The district in 1903 yielded a revenue of 13,000 tumdns. At one period it was famous for its wealth (vide Dag-i-Yanus), its silk trade alone paying £25,000 yearly in customs dues, but now it is mostly inhabited by nomads the chief tribe of which is the Vali OshaghI, though there are representatives also of the Mehni, Sardul, Jabal Barizi, Lar and Afshar tribes. The plain is about 30 miles broad and is intersected by the Halil Rud or Haliri river, which eventually loses itself in the Jaz Murian Hamun. It is bounded on the riOrth-east by the Jabal Bariz range, on the west by the Suleman Kuh and Isfandaqeh hills, and on the north by the lofty Sarduieh and DIvan-i-Murad hills, to the south it is open and stretches away towards Rudbar. As it possesses a mdd climate and abundant pasturage, it is resorted to in winter by many small tribes who occupy the mountain districts at other seasons. Ihe heat is so great m summer and the flies so numerous, that it is almost wholly deserted by the tribes, who return to the moun tains of Jabal Bariz. The lands yield grain, millet, pulse, beans, rice, cotton, henna, and dates , and some parts are of great fertility j from five to thirty- fold being spoken of as the return for barley and wheat. In the middle of January, when Abbott visited it, green crops of barley, high enough to be cut for the food of cattle, were standing in the fields. Sheep, goats, and horned cattle, and their produce, butter and wool, are advantageously pur chased here. The flocks yield lambs twice a year. The jungle and reeds with which this plain is clothed in parts abound with game, such as the francolin, the partridge, known as jarufti (Perdrix pondicereamis) and the wild hog. The boiling point of water on this plain is 209° and the thermometer at 10 a.m. on 22nd January was 81° in a tent and at noon 86°. bloyer in 1876 says that the whole of this 'fertile plain is inhabite from a rough estimate, at the rate of about a village of 200 people to eve 10 miles square. Carpets are made in the villages in this plain but t patterns are all simple zigzag, and the colours are not brilliant ’The plain of Jlruft is important ; the richness of its soil and the quality of its crops could be vastly increased. A large amount of grain and forage could be collected in this province and in Rudbar, and transported over the Deh Bakn Icutal for storage at Bam, Rayin, or Mahun in case an occupa tion of any of these places became necessary for the protection of southern Persia and our seaboard. InJiruftin 1905 the permanent habitations could be numbered on the fingers at one counting. A small fort, a water-mill and a few mud huts, at Dusari, the capital; a 12-roomed mud hut,' owned by a Hindu trader* one Manumall, at Gaz Sala; two water-mills and one mud hut at Hukirfl with the house and hammdm of Muhammad Khan a mile from this village These are all the permanent buildings in Jiruft. Yet there are in the val ley 300 villages or village sites, on which year after year tribes erect their hovels of branches and mats or their black blanket tents.

It lies between Sehlabad and Mud, and is 13 miles from the former and 32 from the latter. The village possesses 10 cattle, 500 sheep and goats and 20 camels. In ordinary years the annual production of wheat and barley (f wheat, i barley) is 70 kharwdrs or 315 Indian maunds. Good and plentiful water- supply from a Jcdriz. The Sardar, Ghulam Riza, lives in an old fort situated on the south side of the village—(C. Wanliss, July 1903 ; 'Abbas 'All 1907 ) KAIMAGAR— A village in Persian Baluchistan. It is situated in the Magas plain (see Magas), about 3f miles cast of that place, and half a mile to the right of the road leading to Sib and Dizak. Kashan is about 4 miles further along the road. Coming from that place, St. John says,—“ A slight descent brought us opposite Kaimagar, a small date-grove half a mile to the east, after which the road gradually ascended towards Magas.” Gasteiger! who passed through in 1881, remarks: “ This village is surrounded by cultivated fields, but is itself very dirty.”— {St. John ; Gasteiger.) KAIN SAGRI (Nala) (Kirman)— A tributary to the Bampur river in the vicinity of the old fort of Pahura. This river possesses a good perennial stream which is used for irriga tion.— {Jennings.) b KAIR and BIR— Coast districts of Persian Baluchistan, lying east of the Rapch river and forming a division of the Dasht district. Kair and Bir consist for the most part of sandy plains between the hills and the sea. A general description of the country will be found in the article Dasht. The Kair and Bir rivers run southwards from the hills across the plains to the sea. They will be found described under their own names. It is uncertain whether there are permanent settlements of Kair and Bir. KAIR RIVER, or KAUR-I-KIR— A considerable stream in Persian Baluchistan which drains the Geh dis trict, and descending in a general ^ southerly course to the coast plains falls into the sea by two mouths, of which the eastern is on Pilzim Bay, 28 miles west by north of Chahbar and the other 18 miles further to westward on the east side of Tank point. The village of Tank is situated on the right bank of the western branch, about 3 miles from the coast, and the village of Kair is scattered on both banks of the eastern branch at about 7 miles from the sea. The district of the delta is called Kair and is cultivated to a considerable extent. Near the town of Geh {q.v.) three watercourses unite, and run south for about 10 miles, when they are joined by theHichan Kaur, which appears to be the mam stream. r300 KA'I—RAJ It is possible that this channel receives the drainage of the eastern part of Bampur. Grant (1809) coming .from ,Bampur entered a watercourse which he calls the Lashar ravine, and followed it down past Isfakeh. Bloyer (1876) found at Maskhutan {q.v.) a watercourse 500 yards broad coming from the north and running south-east. All the watercourses he crossed i' after entering the open country north of Fanuch led east or south-east. This drainage must either have an outlet southwards, or form a “ hamun” in Lashar. But the latter would be so large that we should almost certainly have heard of it. It is more probable on the whole that the Lashar and Maskhutan streams, with the Geh, Murgh, etc.,, find their way to the Kair, perhaps by the Hichan channel. The road from Geh to Chahbar descends 1 the river for 23 miles after passing the junction of the Hichan. It is describ ed by Grant as having water flowing most of the way and the sides skirted in places with palms. . Grant quitted the Kair at $3 miles from Geh, and not far south of that point it emerges from the hills, which here trend away from the coast, , Its further course of about 40 miles is through a sandy plain, It has a wide bed with low flat banks, and in winter always contains water in pools, if not running. Like other rivers in this region it is subject to floods^ which generally occur in December, January, amf February ; rarely if ever in the summer months, whep. the river is usually perfectly dry. When in flood the water sometimes spreads over the country 2 or 3 feet deep for 3 miles on either side of the channel, and the river may be impassable for a week. The usual ford is at the telegraph crossing, though there is abetter one 1| miles below it. These big floods argue a large catchment basin, and as this cannot be of great size laterally, it is probable that the Lashar drainage comes down by the Kair. Water always obtainable by digging in the bed. The Knir river is crossed by the telegraph line and road from Gwadar to Jash-k 7 or 8 mil es from the sea. It is reached at about 46J miles from .Chahbar, and is usually made the fourth stage from that place. Water from ppols is abundant. Firewood plentiful. Camel forage scanty, except for about three mprdhs after rain, when it is plentiful in the bed of the riyer .—[Grant } Pierce; Lorimer 1907 ; Austin, 1910.) KAISARAK— A small village on the coast of Kirman, some 30 miles south of Mlnab.— (Bruchs.) KAIVAN (Persian Baluchistan)— A place in Makran, said to be 122 miles from Jashk, on the road thence to Geh.— (Hdjl Abdul Nabi.) KAJMAKAJ (Pass)— A pass in Kirman, over one of the spurs of the Kuh-i-Lalehzar. It is distant about 12 miles from Rabur, and a road from that place leads across it to Lalehzar village. It is practicable for mules, but would be difficult for camels.— (Sykes, 1900.) KAJU or DASHTIARI (River)— A river in Makran, rising in the Lashar range, where the watershed divides the drainage of the Bampur river from that running to the PersianGulf. Its upper reaches and tributaries water the Champ district, and from thence ,it runs to Qasrqand, about 46 miles, dropping from about 4,000 feet to 1,770 in that distance. For about 2 miles in the neighbour hood of Champ, it goes by the name of Hunzuk {q.v.), and below that, Kaurianch (gw.), and then runs through the Tang, a narrow defile, If miles in length, and only 100 yards in width. The' main kdfileh route between Qasrqand and Champ follows the winding of the stream, and is about as difficult as any in Persia, the western entrance to the Hunzuk being particularly dangerous. Along this portion of its course, there are numerous date-groves, with more or less cultivation, but the inhabitants are very few, as the people chiefly live in the hills. The largest groves are AnjarukI, Kuruchi, and Padin Bug, where a few provisions can be procured. There are said to be about 3,000 Baluchis scattered over the Kaju hills between Qasrqand and Champ. After passing Qasrqand, the Kaju bends westwards, and being joined by the Patak stream, runs past Bug, and then tabes a southerly turn till it -enters the open country of KughI, which is part of Bahu Dashtiari (gw.). Here, as also lower down, the river flows over extensive plains, and widen ing nut into many channels, mingles with the Bahu river, and the two combined, in Dashtiari, render that district liable to severe floods during the rains. After this junction, the stream appears to be called indifferently the Dashtiari, Bahu, Chil or Silop river, and it eventually falls into the Persian Gulf, slightly to the east of Gwatar. Its total length is about 175 miles.—(Zowetf, 1871 ; St. John, 1871 ; Janes, 1900.) KAKISTAN KUH (Kirman)— A range of mountains east of Manujan.— (Jennings.)

About 12,000 date-trees. Good water from wells .—(Sher Jang, 1902.) KALABATAN— A village in the Jashk district (gw.). KALAG— A kutal in the Daman Kuh range on the Sehkuha-Bampur road, between the Karvanda river and Bulbulu, the twentieth stage on that route. It is 10i miles from the latter stage. The rock is of sandstone and a good camel- road could be made with a little blasting and a good deal of picking. The descent is very steep, for a short way 1 in 3. Some treacherous mud,' a sort of quicksand, exists on both sides of the kutal, and the path here is very bad. There is perennial water on both sides of the kutal, and also a hot sulphur spring. Excellent grass and good grazing. Height 3,702 feet.— (Jennings.) KALAGHAN— A village in Bashakard, 2 miles east-south-east of Ramishk on the Eanuch road.— (Sykes, 1898.)302 KAL—KAL KALAGHAN— A well watered valley in Persian Baluchistan, lying on the northern slopes of the Kuh-i-Siahan, about 30 miles east of DIzak. Geographically it is of importance, as the main Jtdfleh route s from the Mashkll valley on the south, h ad through it to Jalk. The road from Dfzak and Kalpur- kan crosses by the Brinjinan Pass (4,600'), which is practicable for wheeled artillery ; and that from Isfandak by the Bunsir Pass (4,500'), which is practicable only for pack transport. The Kslaghan river, rising in ^he Kuh-i-Sinhiin flows northwards, and eventually loses itself in the Mfsh'aci Hdnifin. Along ih&gt; banks of the river are numerous villages and some dilar idated forts, but none of any great importance, the principal on s being, starting irom the south, Aibi, Pahura, BalaKalat,Liji, Nagan, andKal ;h-ud-DIp, all of these beingdes- cribed separately under their own names, The valley is famous for its comparative fertility, and especially for the luxuriant growth of its maiden-hair fern. Among many writers who have described this spot, Sir Thomas Holdich, who visited it in 1896, says “Water was running with refreshing abundance in the Kalaghan valley. There was no haunting suspicion that it might run dry in a week or so, for it spread out into swamps with tall reeds and grass, with snipe in the midst of it. At intervals appeared forts, protecting small clusters of white mud-built houses, surrounded by palms, and rich with fields of wheat and beans, encompassing orchards of pomegranates, figs, and mulberries. | Kalaghan is as picturesque in details as some of the Himalayan valleys ; the pity of it is, that there is so little of it.” It appears that at one time Kalaghan rivalled Jalk in prosperity, but that the district was ruined by a great flood in 1862, from which it has never been able to recover, while yearly increasing taxation has prevented it from making any real material progress. The inhabitants of JCalaghan are a wretched-looking people, but little better than the Bampur slaves, and are said to be almost all Arbabis, a subject tribe not far removed from serfdom. The chiefs are physically both finer and fairer, and probably belong to a different race.—(Jennings, 1685 ; Sykes, 1896 ; Holdich, 1901 ; Grant, 1902.)

KAL MAZAR HAMUN or KALEH MAZAR HAMUN*— A large saucer-shaped hamun in Persian Baluchistan, situated in the depression between the skirts of the south end of Rizabad Band where it joins Siah Band on the west, Jauri Band on the south and Gvar kuh on the east. Its dimensions are from 2 to 3 miles broad from north to south, by 3 to 4 miles long from east to west. It is now for the most part dry, with white efflorescent shur covering the exposed surface, except at the north-west corner, where there is a large pool containing 2 or 3 feet of water. The entire ground is covered with long grasses, reeds and rushes, and is fringed with tamarisk trees. It receives all the drainage of the Galugan and Gvarkuh plains, also that from the slopes of the surrounding ranges. At the west corner it is from 6 to 8 feet deep and is full of wild fowl during the rains. At the south-west corner, where the Rizabad and Siah Band ranges approach, is a deep gorge through which the surplus water drains away and flows into the Bazman hdmun, which is situated under the Rizabad Band range some 8 miles west of Chasl meh-i-Shuraf and, as far as I can see, disappear s into the plain there. From what I subsequently saw from the top of Kuh-i-Zindeh, I cannot see how any of this drainage joins the Narmashir {vide map). During our hour’s halt here at Chashmeh Kuch we were visited by several local Rikis who live in ghiddns close by ; they told us that this side of the Kal Mazar is impassable in rainy weather, and that the track to Bampur then runs via Nur Muhammad kdriz on the opposite side of the hdmun ; this is corroborated by Captain Jennings.— {Brazier-Creagh, 1894. ) KALMURD (Kirman)— A range of hills west of Khanfl.— {Jennings.)KAL—KAM 311 KALPADA— V ei sr. le fl it lie iy tli st le d i e ;es nd nd e'G, ;op lit ere us tie ide Kalpada, 10 miles from Shurfi and 39 miles from Nasratabad, on the Sistan-Narmashir road ; good water .—{Shaikh Mohi-ud-Din, 1893-94 ) KALPURKAN— A village in the Dizak district of Persian Baluchistan, 13 miles south-east of Dilavar Khan.

It. is in habited solely by fishermen.— (Kempthome.) KARVAN— A small district near the coast in Persian Makran ; it lies upon both sides of the Rapch river, beginning on the south at about 10 miles from the coast, and extending thence northwards for a distance of 10 or 15 miles; its breadth also, from near Balak on the coast to the Kashi stream on the west, is about 10 miles. Karvan is, for Persian Makran, a well cultivated and well-wooded tract ; it abounds with small game, such as black partridge and (in the season) duck. Karvan is inhabited by the Karvani tribe whose divisions are given in the article on Persian Makran. The principle villages are :— Name. Position. Number of huts. Ganjak 11 miles north-west of the telegraph crossing, on the ^ Rapch river. 35 Gao 10 miles north of ditto 12 Haiyan 2 miles west of Gad 20 Karkindar 12 miles north-west of the telegraph crossing on the Rapch river. 40 Tambalan 8 miles north of the telegraph crossing on the Rapch ri ver. 25 The chief village is Karkindar, and, besides the places mentioned above there are several small hamlets of which the names and particulars have not been ascertained. Five headmen of the Karvan district receive annual subsidies, aggregating Rs. 700, from the Indo-Eur. pean Telegraph Department for the protection of the land ine within their district.^ (Lorimer, 1906.) KARVANDA (Kirman)—Lat. 27° 48' 35'; Long. 60° 42' 56'; Elev. 4,142'. This village lies between the Siah Band and the Murghak Kuh. It is situ ated on the right (south) bank of the river. There is a small fort herein bad repair and 30 houses. Inhabitants Sohrabzais (Kurds) and Arbabis (Dehkan *) 120 souls; 50 cows and bullocks, 2 camels, 15 donkeys, 300 goats and sheep. But at this period (April 1885), owing to fear of a raid by the Sinjaranis, many people have come here from eastern Sarhad to graze their flocks and herds. Cultivation from karizes generally, and a little from the river. In the latter is a good perennial stream. * Dekhdnls, like the Arbabis; have no known origin ; they are only cultivators ard do not fight ; they are always under some one’s protection.316 KAR—KAS Produce : wheat, barley, Indian-corn and cotton. Formerly several more kdrlzes existed in this district, to the west; but they have now gone to ruin. Much cultivation must at one time have existed. There is also here a date palm grove. Grass, grazing, wood and water are abundant and good. The village is included in the Bampur district. History. —When Saiyid Khan (father to Sardar Karim Khan) was the chief at Vasht, this village was included in Sarhad, and the Katkhudd here was named Mir ManjI (Kurd). The latter took one-third of the total produce from this place, as also from all patches in the Siah Band as far as Jacri Nala. When Mir Manji quarrelled with Saiyid Khan, the latter confiscated the former’s right to the said one-third share of the produce. Mir Manji complained to the Persian Government. The latter decided the matter by annexing Karvanda to-Bampur. Now Mir Manji possesses large flocks and herds, and cultivates a certain portion of land to the west of Karvanda. Some 12| miles to the west, i.e., beyond Ganich, near the watershed sepa rating Karvanda Ndld from the Hehmukki Ndld draining to Sarhad Hdmun, is a white hill, from which much chalk is obtained; and opposite to this, to the south, in the slopes of the Siah Band, are the remains of numerous ovens and bits of furnace clay—identified as “clay from a copper furnace”—showing that copper was once manufactured here. The roads leading from here are the ones’traversed— (a) to Vasht: (b) to Bampur, via Damin ; (c) to Bampur, via Karag Kutal; (d) to Vasht, via Jauri and to Sehkuha, via Jauri, both avail able for guns.— {Jennings.) KARVANDA (River) (Kirman) — Flowing past the village of the same name southwards, it eventually meets the Bampur river.— {Jennings.) KARVAN KAUR— A stream in the Karvan district, on the coast of Persian Baluchistan. It rises in the hills, beyond those called Jaodar, and running south appa rently falls into the sea east of Kunarak Kuh and Ras Maidani. It is possible, however, that it may join the Rapch, and the cours s of all streams in the plain vary constantly. Floyer’s route from Kashi {q.v.) to Bint led up the Karvan through the hills. At Pugunzi halting-place, 26 miles from Kashi, the bed of the stream was 300 yards across. The water ran in numerous small channels and was fairly sweet, although the boulders were white with crusted saline deposit. From this place down through the Jaodar hills the ; bed of the Karvan is full of 'pish (dwarf palm), resembling miniature date- groves, and greatly increasing the beauty of the river from the high banks. Above Pugunzi the route leaves the Karvan and crosses a shingly plateau to the Tank river.— {Floyer.) K ARV ANSAR AI— An old serai in the Shamil district (&lt;?.«.). KASANJAN— A fort in Kirman.— {Malcolm.)KASHAKAN— A halting-place and date-grove in Bashakard, 25 miles trom Ramlshk, on the road to Bint. Water is obtained from a stream.— (Sykes, from native information, 1898.) KASHAN or NAZARABAD— A village in Persian Baluchistan, near Jalk (q.v.). KASHI— A halting-place in the coast district of Persian Baluchistan. It is the ninth stage from Chahbar and the sixth from Jashk ; and is 12 miles west of the Rapch river (q.v.) and 16 miles east of Surag (q.v.). Kashi appears to be near the hills, about 3 or 4 miles south of the Kashi Kaur. Water is obtained from a well some 2| miles north of the camping- ground. There is generally a fair supply ; fuel and forage are abundant. From this place the track to Bint, followed by FI oyer in 1876, strikes northwards, and ascends the Karvan river (q.v.) through the hills. The country about Kashi is composed of shingly plains and undulations, intersected by small sandy water-courses, the course of which is marked by lines of long grass and low jungle. Wild thyme (southernwood) is abun dant. Eastwards there is a flat sandy plain extending to the Rapch river. To the west also there is flat sandy ground for 4 or 5 miles, where low hills are met with.— (Floyer ? Pierce.) Kashi would seem to be in the Kirman district, and, according to Grant, is 9 miles west of the settlement so called. ‘ West ’ here no doubt means ‘ south-west.’ KASHI— A perennial spring of sweet water about 1 mile north-west of Baghi.— (James, 1909.)

This road is said to be fit for guns.—(//Mj'i Abdul Nabi.) KASHI KAUR— A small stream in the Karvan district, on the coast of Persian Baluchis tan. It appears to rise in the coast range some distance west of the Karvan, and going eastwards falls into that stream. Floyer, however, thought that both the Kashi and the Karvan joined the Rapch. Ordinarily the Kashi is a chain of pools and mud, and is probably quite dry in the hot weather.— (Floyer.) KASHIT,— see Kahn MJrza. KASHlT— Lat. 29° 45'; Long. 58° 15*. A village in Rudbar (q.v) in Kirman.318 KAS-KA3 It consists of 400 to 500 inhabitants, and is situated on the western border of the Lut desert with a stretch of date-groves stretching north and south for 2 miles by ^ mile in width. The fort and village are situated on the lower slopes of a range of hills west of the date-groves. A large stream of slightly brackish water flows through the village and past the fort. The water is said to be impregnated with zdk; this and the excessive heat of the place are said to cause the early death of the inhabitants, now living beyond 40 or 50 years of age. About 60 of the inhabitants are adult males ; they were Levies until about 1907 when they were discharged, their breech-loading rifles (Werndl) being taken away from them. They now all possess old muzzle-loaders. In the event of attack by robbers the whole population take refuge in the fort. The fort is a large one built on a rocky eminence and commanding the whole village and the date groves, it in its turn being commanded by the neighbouring hills. The walls are badly cracked, but on the whole the fort is fairly intact. The interior is a labyrinth of tunnels and passages ; many of the rooms are occupied by villagers. A deep well inside the fort has not been uncovered within living memory. Half the cultivated ground is owned by the inhabitants, the other half by a person in Kir man. Taxes calculated at 10 per date palm yield 4,000 tiimans annually, half is paid in at Khabis by the villagers, the re mainder by the property owner in Kirman. , The production of dates (Keruteh variety only) is about 700 Jchanmrs (200 tons) annually ; some aie sent to Bam and the remainder taken by Sistanis, who visit the place in the autumn, bringing wheat to barter for the dates. Sufficient wheat is grown for the use of the inhabitants for three months, the supply for the remaining nine months of the year being obtained from Sistanis as above-mentioned and from the Narmasbier. A small quantity of henna is grown, about 3 khanvdrs (1 ton) per annum. About 30 oxen, 30 donkeys and 100 to 200 sheep and goats are owned by the villagers. The sheep graze in the reed-beds at Gazdar Mill 6 miles north-east of Kashit, in the winter and early spring and in the neighbourhood of Goak during the summer. Supplies : sheep and fowls, flour in small quantities. Grazing poor. Fuel is brought from a distance of 5 or 6 miles. The following minor villages are owned by the inhabitants of Kashit and are distant as stated — PashS, about 20 miles. Kehnu ’Ali Mirza, 30 miles. Kehun Shah, 33 miles. Satmmun, 33 miles. Sabtu, 36 miles. Jehar, 36 miles to the north-west. Nask, 16| miles, west—• {James, 1909.) KASHKAN GIT IN or Kishkan Gitan— A halting-place in the Champ district of Persian Baluchistan {see Champ), 71 miles east of Champ village, on the Qasrqand road. It is situated amonghills on the upper course of the Kaju stream (&lt; 7 . v.), which contains an abundant supply of water. Thera appears to be a palm-grove, as dates are procurable in addition to fuel and forage, but there was only one hut in February 1871. The ordinary route to the Champ plateau leads up an affluent ravine to the villages of Surian and Champ. It is impracticable for artillery, but another road ascending the main stream of the Kaju is said to be passable for wheels. Tang {q.v.), the next halting-place towards Qasrqand, is 15 miles down the river. Perhaps the same as Kuchan Gitan {q-v .)— (Beresford-Lovett .) KASH KAUR— A stream or watercourse in the Sarbaz district of Persian Baluchistan, which rises apparently somewhere north of the hill marked Sagar Kuh, on St. John’s map, and running east or south-east joins the Sarbaz river at Dipkur (q-v )- KASH KITH— A stage on the Dasht Ab plain on the Kirman-Bandar Abbas route, 20 miles south of Baft and 36 north of Daulatabad. Elevation about 6,600 feet. A small dilapidated village of about 30 mud houses with a few orchards and a little cultivated ground and also a mill. In its vicinity, scattered over the plain, are several other small tumble-down hamlets with orchards and cultivation. The Dasht Ab plain is but sparsely cultivated and inhabited; many of the houses are deserted. The soil is good and well supplied with water, and there is fair grazing all over it, yet there is a general appearance of neglect visible all round, and the inhabitants appear poverty-stricken. There is a small stream of hill water passing down close to the village, and qandts are seen over the plain. There are five weavers, one carpenter, one mechanic, two dyers, and one felt worker. Supplies scanty ; water plentiful and good ; no grass or forage. We got 16 eggs for 1 krdn and 4 mans of flour for 6 | krans. — (Brazier-Creagh, 1894.) RASH KUSH —See Daman. KASHMARAN— A village in Khorasan, on the route from Birjand to Farah, 30 miles beyond Sar-i-Bisheh. There is water here, but no supplies.—(JfacGreg'or.) KASH RUDKHANEH— A village of 150 houses, 30 miles north-east of Farghun. Livestock : 5 horses, 50 donkeys, 20 camels, 400 cattle, 1,500 sheep and goats. Good water, from a stream and kdrlz. About 4,000 date- trees. Firewood, bhilsd, wheat and barley, are generally procurable.— (Sher Jang, 1902.) KAS KASH— A village in Geh (q.v.) in Makran.320 KAS—KAS KASKlN— The tenth stage on the Robat-Bampur route. The halting-place is situated in the bed of the Kaskin river which in the dry season contains numerous pools of brackish water, generally much fouled by camels. Abundant camel-grazing, grass and fuel obtainable at a distance of from £ to 1 mile. No habitations.— {Grey, 1906.) KASKlN— A valley adjoining the Kafanu valley, about 13 miles south of Am on the Kirman-Bandar Abbas road, in the Kirman district. The road south from the Kafanu pass runs along a well-beaten alluvial track down the Kaskin valley, with the Kaskin river to the west under the Kaskin hills ; to the east is the lofty snow-clad Lalehzar huh. This valley is some 4 miles long and miles broad, and contains several fine old orchards ; there are also some cemeteries with tombstones bearing dates of 200 or 300 years ago. It is now but sparsely inhabited ; there are no per manent buildings ; only a few hashams are seen along the valley. The inhabitants go to the Garm Sir in cold weather and are only now return ing.* There is at present * no cultivation, but the valley is green and covered with flowering plants ; a profuse crop of yellow tulips, cowslips^ blue-bells, and narcissus are seen, and all the orchards are just blossoming.* Sixteen miles south of Am is a cemetery close on the left, and a little way on a path runs off over a well-beaten track to Rabur via Bizinjan. The road from this runs parallel to the river, which is close on the right; it is a deep rapid hill stream, some 30 yards wide, with fine old willow-trees scattered along its banks. Water (brackish) from pools in the river-bed, which are generally much fouled by camels. Camel-grazing, grass and fuel in large quantities | mile from the camping-ground. Horses thrive well in this valley, and it would make an ideal hill statio'n for cavalry, were it not for the question of supplies. Kaskin is the head-quarters of the Lak tribe, who are pure Iranians, numbering about 1,000 families. They came to Kirman from Fars some 150 years ago. For their sub-divisions vide article on nomad tribes, under the heading Kirman.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1894 ; Sykes, 1902-06.) KASKlN (River)— A stream in Persian Baluchistan which, rising in the southern slopes of the Siah Band Kuh, flows in a south-south-westerly direction, and after receiving the waters of the Shandamulla stream, eventually empties itself into the Bampur river, about 32 miles west of the town of that name. kAstag— A village and halting-place in the Pishin district of Persian Baluchistan. It is the first stage from Pishin on the Gwadar road, and is 11 miles south of that place. On clearing the date-groves and cultivation of Pishin (after * On 20th April,about 3 miles) the road enters thehills and follows a narrow winding gorge, between low hills and is very stony for about 6 miles, when it emerges into a valley which gradually opens out. Kastag halting-place is in this valley. * Water from pools was sufficient: and good at the beginning of March 1871 but the supply is precarious. Plenty of grass is obtainable and also fire wood. No signs of cultivation or inhabitants near the halting-place, and the hills around are barren and stony. There is, however, a small village and a few acres of cultivation some- where in the neighbourhood. The people come from Pishin, and the place, therefore, belongs to that district and is in Persian ’ territory, although on the Kalat side of the watershed, which is the general boundary! The road follows the course of the valley which widens after 2 miles and is covered with low jungle and wild caper. Otherwise the scenery is of the most desolate description. The Siah Kuh (q.v.) lies some miles west of the road and of Ghistan. Many divergent paths leading into the constant openings in the low hills necessitate a good guide in this part of the route. Ghistan {q.v.), which is also in Persian territory, is reached 10 miles from Kastag.— {St. John ; Euan-Smith.) Euan-Smith’s narrative also mentions a “ Kastuk ” ravine, in which is situated the halting-place of Gvar Manzil {q.v.), two stages south of Kastag. It is natural to suppose the Kastuk or Kastag Kaur would be that drain ing the Kastag plain. But although the road, after passing Ghistan, which appears to be at the lower end of the plain, is described as entering a wide gorge and following the bank of a mountain torrent, it is impos sible to say from the account whether this is the same as that at Gvar Manzil or not. The map, if correct, is decidedly against the supposition. All this country drains into the Dasht river. KASUBRAN— Elev. 3,311/ A sweet well m Kirman, lying in the bed of a stream, about 35 miles south-east of Rigan, on the Bazman road .—{Shaikh Mohi-ud-din, 1893.) RATAL ARA— Lat. ; Long. Elev. A village near Chari {q.v.) in the Kirman district. KATGAN, see Bampur. KATlCH— A village in Persian Baluchistan, which in the time of Haji ’Abdul Nabi (1839) belonged to the Fanuch district. It is supposed to lie in a north westerly direction. Haji ’Abdul Nabi travelled 10 kos east from Ramlshk to Katich ; thence he took about seven hours on an ambling donkey to reach Mutarabad over a good road. Mutarabad is 7 kos from Fanuch by a good road. It may, therefore, be concluded that Katich is about 50 miles from Fanuch. * The whole of which is probably known as Kastag. t According to Euan-Smith s narrative. The route given by St. John on Euan- Smitn s authontv makes it 13 miles, but from the map 10 miles would appear to be correct. 61 I. B. 20322 KAT-KAU In 1839 the village contained about a hundred huts. Tobacco is culti vated here, as well as at Mutarabad.— (Haji ’Abdul Nabi.) KAUGlB— Fourteen nrles from Nasratabad (Sipi) towards Neh ; is situated amorg low hills, with little water, and no other supplies.—(iSAatM Mohi-ud-din, 1893-94.) KAURAN DAP— A small hamlet in Makran, about 18 miles south of Bint, situated at the junction of the Bint and Maluran rivers. The routes between Bint and Chahbar, and Geh and Jashk cross here. The distance to Geh being about 50 miles. There are said to be no supplies, and the water has to be obtained from wells. Fuel and camel-grazing are plentiful.—(Fio?/er, 1876 ; Brazier-Creagh, 1893 ; from native information.) KAUR GtJRAN— One of the two navigable channels between Laft Point and Guran, island of Qishm, Persian Gulf. It is the more eastern of the two, is narrow (in some parts under a quarter of a mile in width), but generally preferred by the pilots, as the water is 5 to 15 fathoms deep. The banks are of mud, and well defined by the mangroves on them. Its course is tortuous, being south from Laft Point for 9 miles, passing about 1 mile westward of that town; thence north-west for 2| miles ; and then turning sharp south-west and south-south-west for 9 miles more, to the village of Guran. It then trends west-south-west for 2 miles, when it re-unites with the western or main channel. This last reach is the most difficult part of the passage ; it is very narrow, with 12 to 15 fathoms water, and the banks are covered at high water, and have no mangroves on them.— {Constable ; Stiffe ; Persian Gulf Pilot ; Lorimer.) KAURIANCH— A portion of the upper reaches of the Kaju river in Makran. This name seems to be applied to the stream from about 3 miles north of Suhragi Dap, or 30 north of Qasrqand, and ends some 9 miles higher up, where it becomes known as the Hunzuk.

KHAJBlZ— A village about 13 miles from Kalat on the Neh-Birjand road, lying a little off the watershed in a plain under the hills.— (Mohi-ud-Din.) KHABIS— Lat. 30° 25' 26' {Lentz) ; Long. 57° 38' 45' ; Elev. 1,860. A small town and district of Kirman, about 56 miles east of the town of that name. The village is situated in an oasis on the edge of the great desert of the Lut, and is surrounded by wide-stretching orange groves and date palm plantations. The population of the place numbers about 5,000 in the village, or rather villages (for it is really a collection of such), and 10,000 in the district, which i 3 known as Tikab to the north-east, east and south-east. The chief trade of Khabis is in the exportation of henna and dates. Resources 01 the forme:r between 30,000 and 40,000lb go to Khorasan and 270,000 to Yazd ; of the latter 1,110,000 lb are produced annually in the district and 810,0001b exported to Afghanistan, Khorasan and Yazd. The trade is conducted on barter principles, grain being taken in exchange (none being raised locally) when grain is dear in the district, but cheap in Khorasan. If, however, grain is dear in Khorasan, and cheap in Khabis (Kirman), money changes hands. There are no merchants in Khabis, only petty shop-keepers, who get their stocks from Kirman, and who remain in Khabis eight months. Goods intended for Khorasan and Afghanistan go either direct or vid Birjand, whence they are sent on to| Meshed and Herat. The cost of transport is 60 krdns per kharwdr to Birjand.. The trade to Sistan is direct vid Neh, to Nasratabad ; cost, 10 tumdns per khanvdr. The roads bifurcate in the centre of the Lut at Gudar-i-Barut. It would be possible with the expenditure of a little money and a little engineering skill to make the present road between Khabis and Kirman, which is almost impassable for camels and very difficult for mules, easier and much shorter, and thus also to gain a direct caravan route between Kirman and Khorasan (avoiding the Anjir Pass) Some details regarding the date palm, whose fruit forms the staple pro duct of Khabis, and also of Baluchistan, may not be without interest. The life of a date palm is occasionally as much as 150 years, and it bears 180lb of fruit per annum. The fruit is sold at about Id. per lb. I n winter the soil round the trees is turned over by deep hoeing, and the trees are watered once a fortnight. In summer the watering is done once every seven or eight days. There are about 60,000 date palms in Khabis. Henna is the well-known orange-coloured dye used by Muhammadans for their hair and beard, a brilliant black being obtained by the addition of indigo leaves to the above colour. The leaf of the henna plant resembles that of the myrtle in shape. ' r326 KHA—KHiS The plant grows like a thin, straight twig about 18 inches in height. The leaves are stripped from it and dried, after which they are ground up and are ready for use. Cold quickly destroys the plant, but it usually yields for six or seven years in succession. The henna of this part is much esteemed. The heat in summer is so great at Khabis that nearly all its Climate inhabitants forsake the place for higher ground, leaving only a few to look after the cultivation. The wind known as the Bad-i-Samiim, rising in the desert, blows for about forty days in summer during part of each day generally an hour before and an hour after noon. It is said that those who are caught by it in the desert are frequently destroyed, but it is not fatal where trees abound, and it is affirmed that the dates do not properly ripen without it. During four months of the heat, this wind prevails from the direction of Khorasan. The place is well supplied with water from two streams, which after uniting are conducted tp the gardens and groves of Khabis by canals. To the north-east of Khabis, at a distance of about 12 miles, is situated a tract of salt formed by the deposits of some collection of water from the mountain torrents, which apparently sweep over an intensely saline soil in their passage. The extent of this deposit is described as being from 9 to 12 miles ; the salt is several inches in depth, and is carried in slabs for sale to neighbouring places. Eastward of Tikab lies the great desert, extending towards Sistan—an arid waste and wilderness, which neither man nor beast can inhabit. The town was held, ofi and on, by the Afghans, until the Kajar dynasty was firmly established. The remains of their elaborately fortified walled city, which was contained within a square trace, and covered about 100 acres, are still evident, lying to the east of the present town . The supposed ruins of an ancient Christian church are situated a mile to the east of the town and are known as Aims —said to be a corruption of Nalctis,' the wooden gong used by Christians in Muhammadan countries. The ruins consist of the remains of a shrine, containing a brick grave dated A.H. 173 (A.D. 789) ; and a more ancient pre -Muhammadan building, together with what has been identified by the Reverend A. R. Blackett (C. M. S.) as portions of a vestry, apse, and sedilia, but this identification is doubtful.—(Kewneir; Abbott, 1850 ; Sykes 1902 • Newcomen, 1905.) KHlBR, KUH-I —Elev. 10,780'.

The boundary then follows the line of coast, taking in the Bashakard district, up to the western borders of Makran; then northwards to Chil-i- Nadir, and leaving the Bazman Kuh on the east, runs to Nasratabad in the Lut. , _ v o -r Its northern boundary runs roughly from Nasratabad to Deh-Saif, then to the lowest level of the plain between Chehilpai and Darband, on the Naiband-Kirman road, and from thence south of Gudran and Bafq to Sar-i-Yazd. Its total area is thus approximately the same as that of France. Kirman is a very mountainous province. The principal range is part of the main orographic system of Persia, which Mountains. rung f rom nor th-west to south-east.

In the desert west, south, and east of Kirman, as in the greater part of the plains of Persia, the villages exist solely by Irrigation. means of springs tapped in the hills, the water of which is conveyed for many miles to the level plain by underground channels termed qandts. In some cases the original well from which the qandt starts may be as much as 400 feet deep, and as every few yards other shafts have to be sunk, it is evident that the labour incurred must be enormous, and that the water obtained can be only sufficient to cultiviate a very trifling portion of the soil', because no systematic and scientific * But the district of Rudan is an enclave of Fars, the Duzdl river running down the middle of it.effort is made to conserve the enormous quantities of snow and storm water that now rushes to wash in the desert. Narmashir is less arid than other parts of the province, but even there the water-supply is said to be yearly decreasing, and the desert to be gradually encroaching. This is probably due to a constantly diminishing rainfall, consequent on the gradual dis appearance of the forests, which are slowly being exhausted by the char coal burner. Few ranges are now covered at all extensively with timber, sparse bushes being generally all that can be found. N Rain very seldom falls before the middle of November or after the ^ end of March. The average number of days in any one month would be three or four only. The average annual rainfall for Kirman itself is only 5'7 inches. Floods caused by rain subside in 24—36 hours and the ground dries very quickly. Where not pure sand or stone the ground is very slippery when wet and is then very difficult to march over. On the top of plateau there is never any excessive heat as Heat understood in India, though in mid-summer it might be advisable to march by night rather than by day. Down below the climate is hot from April to October, and in Baluchistan so hot that compaigning during time would be impossible. Down below the nights are chilly from November to March, but there is no real cold on the plateau ; it is cold from November to March, January and February are the coldest months, the temperature at night during these months is usually 9—10° below freezing, though very rarely temperatures below zero are registered as late as March. Usually falls during January and February, but not before or after. This year there has been heavy snow as low as Snow ' Bam and the roads have been blocked. Snow seldom falls at Bam or anywhere off the plateau. Kirman itself is wonderfully free from wind, but the prevailing wind in Winds the winter is from west and is very cold. On the Sarvistan plain and from Tehrud to Abariq a high and bitterly cold wind blows all the winter. In summer the breeze is cool on the plateau, but down below there are hot winds which, across the But, are intensely and dangerously hot. The only other climatic condition which would interfere with the marching of troops is the melting of the snow in the spring which causes floods in the rivers, which are however very seldom unfordable at the places where the main caravan route crosses them. In 1902 experiments in artesian well boring were made, but were not successful. An ancient dam used to exist some miles up the Halil Rud and could again be reconstructed at a trifling cost; it would dam up an extensive catchment area and quadruple the water-supply of the Jiruft. The Garmsir is the name given to the belt of country which lies be- Garmsir. tween the great mountain ranges and the sea. This extends along the coast of Persia from Minab to the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab or Basrah river, and varies in4 S36 KIR-KTS* I breadth from 30 to 100 miles, its greatest width being in the direction of Rudbar and Jlruft, across the plains of which it stretches up to the mountain barrier of Sarduieh. Within the limits of Kirman this tract is composed mostly of saline sand. Here the palm flourishes, while wheat and barley are grown as winter crops, reaped in early spring. The inhabitants are almost as dark as those of the Punjab. Part of the great Lut desert, which has an average elevation of 2,000 feet, and which is supposed to have been originally an inland sea, lies within the limits of Kirman province. The route across the Lut is bad, but caravans annually cross it to Bandar Abbas from Herat. While being impassable for an army or even a brigade, it is feasible as a caravan trade route. There is more water than was supposed to exist, and it is this trade route in Bandar Abbas to Sistan and Herat vid Rigan and Mlnab that is the natural one, not via Nushki and Quetta.

The products of the country are :—wheat, barley, opium, millet, cotton, ^ beet-root, and peas. In the Garmsir rice and maize are the summer crops, and henna, especi ally in Narmashlr and Khabis. There are also grown melons, grapes, beans, lucern^, castor oil, cabbages, onions, potatoes, etc., as well as many kinds of fruit, while the pistachio of the province is famous ; the average output being about 1,200,0001b per annum. The trees include the plane, poplar, willow, olive, cypress, fir, acacia and some roses. From one species of bush known as Icatira the valuable tragacanth gum is extracted ; malodorous asafcetida is similarly procured, while over the whole provinc 0 grows the peculiar class of tamarisk from which manna is collected. The walnut tree is found at a height of about 7,003 feet. This is the wood principally used in carpentering ; doors, boxes, etc., all being made of walnut in the bitter class of houses. The game birds and animals are :— leopard, bear, wild sheep, ibex, gazelle, wolves, hyenas, jackals, foxes, wild ass, boar, partridge, sand grouse, and pigeon. Quail, duck and snipe are rare.KIR—KIR 341 The minerals are sulphur, copper (found in the neighbourhood of Minerals Kirman and on the road thence to Bam), manganese earth (found near Kirman and used for making glass), salt (from two salt lakes on the Kirman-Bandar Abbas road, between Urzu and Ahmadi) , astetos at Darband, sal- ammoniac in Sarhad, and some inferior coal.

The military forces consist of— 3 infantry battalions of 800 men each .. 2,400 men. 1 infantry company . . 9 cavalry regiments or squadrons at various strength Artillery 60 „ U40 „ 24 guns, of which only 9 are serviceable. In addition there are several levies of horse and foot doing police work along the main roads. The soldiers are practically untrained and are armed with very obsolete weapons ; they seldom receive pay, and are of little practical account. But in the nomad tribes there is a fine reserve of raw material, which might be converted into excellent cavalry. As in all other districts in Persia, the Government of the province is farmed out to the Governor-General, who makes himself responsible for the revenue. In 1900 the revenue was 315,000 tumdns (£63,000), while the amount collected was probably £90,000, of which £10,000 was the Shah’s pishkash, the balance going into the pocket of the Governor-General. The imports for the year 1893-94 were estimated at £97,900, and the exports at £89,000. The Russian imports for - Tra e ' the same year were £3,000. The principal trade centres, besides the capital, are Saidabad, Bahramabad, Khabis and Bam. Since the British Commercial Mission to South-East Persia in 1904-05 the Russian efforts in organizing their trade in Russian trading enterprise. j£} rm j| n an q its adjacent districts have been more vigorous than they had hitherto been. In June, 1905, a Russian trader from Isfahan visited Kirman, and having entered into an agreement with the Kirman merchants (Parsis and local Persian merchants), obtained certain orders for the purchase of Russian manufactured goods. This visit of the Russian trader from Isfahan was followed by the Commercial Mission of Prince Amatuni, who arrived in Kirman from Yazd in January, 1906. While in Kirman and at Bam the Prince was engaged in investigations regarding fhe trade of the country. From Bam Prince Amatuni went to Bandar Abbas, thence visiting Bushire. The Russian Consul here also established Russian trade agencies in Kirman, Bam, and Rafsinjan.342 KIR-KIR Owing to recent troubles in Russia the goods mentioned in the above- mentioned agreement were not received at Bandar Abbas in November, 1905, as was stipulated, but arrived later. It is reported that Russian manu factured chintzes and other woollen cloths to the value of about 24,000 tumnns (about Rs. 60,000) were brought to Bandar Abbas by Russian steamers and sent to Kixman to the Parsis and local Persian merchants of Kirman and Yazd. A Russian steamer service company is also reported to have been established in the Persian Gulf, with their agents in Bandar Abbas, styled the Russian trade and steamer agents in the Persian Gulf. It is said that the (hintzes brought by the Russian steamers and delivered at Bandar Abbas were not of the same quality as the samples mentioned in the agreement, and the merchants here complained of the matter to the Russian Consul, but the result is not known. Some 400 cases of Russian loaf sugar from Bandar Abbas and some 400 tins of kerosene oil from Meshed, with a quantity of Russian tea, were also imported into Kirman during the year under report. The Russian tea is not liked by the Persians, in consequence of which the trader who imported it is said to regret his enterprise. The carpet trade of Kirman, which is entirely in the hands of the Tabrizi Turk merchants, who export to Constantinople Carpet trade of Kirman. an( j America, been more prosperous during the year under report than it had been in the previous one. It happened twice during this year that there being a great demand for carpets in Constantinople and America the value of the Kirman and Afshar carpets rose, and the carpet merchants of Kirman profited handsomely by the occasion. The well-known carpet merchant, Agha Muhammad HajI, Tehrani of Kirman who took his caravan of carpets a second time to India via the Nushki-Sistan trade route, and who is still in India, appears to have failed in his enterprise. There appears to be no very great opening for a Persian carpet trade in India. The British trade of Kirman is chiefly in the hands of Hindu agents of the Shikarpur firms.

The province of Kirman has, from its earliest appearance on the stage of Tjj gtor history, been of considerable importance, while its extent at the present day is approximately what it was more than 2,000 years ago. When the Indo-European trade went across Persia instead of round the Cape the town of Kirman^was the second most important town in Persia and in early days Camadi in Jlspft was a most important place.344 KIR—KIR Its first mention is found in the pages of Herodotus, who refers to it as forming one of the twelve tribes of Persia. Strabo gives a general account of its dimensions, fertility, and mineral wealth, in terms which would be fairly applicable even now. In the great epic poem the “ Shah Nameh,” the king of Kirman is mentioned as fighting on the side of Kai Khusru against the forces of Turan. Alexander the Great traversed the province from east to west on his return journey from India, while Krateros entered it from Sistan. No reference to Kirman is found during the period of the Parthian dynasty, but after enduring a foreign yoke for five centuries., Ardashir, son of Papak, defeated Artabanus in a desperate battle near Ram Plurmuz (A.D. 218), and established a national dynasty which lasted till the ’Arab conquest and under which it enjoyed a state of general peace and prosperity. When the Nestorian sect spread over Persia, Kirman became a See under the Metropolitan of Pars (vide Khabis). During the Arab invasion, after the battle of Nahavand (A.D. 642), Kirman offered little opposition, and, though rebellions and risings were of frequent occurrence, the Muham madan rulers became the more firmly established, till gradually the majority of the population themselves embraced the tenets of Islam. For the next 400 years Kirman was the scene of battle and murder, where one king succeeded another, only to be ousted in his turn by a stronger than he. In A.D. 1013 Mahmud of Ghazni seized Kirman, but eight years after his death, which occurred in A.H. 421 (A.D. 1030), a mighty wave of conquest rolled westwards across Asia, when the Seljuks captured Merv and Nishapur, and Malik Kaward, son of Chakar Beg, hewed out a kingdom for himself in Kirman, which was held by his descendants for a century and a half, and included, till the reign of Arslan Shah, the province of’Oman, which Kaward annexed by an oversea e pedition. Kirman under the Seljuka was at the zenith of its prosperity about the year A.D. 1100, after which a fearful condition of rapine and anarchy succeeded, when the Ghaz, expelled from Sarakhs, invaded the province, marched to Baghin, defeated the forces sent against them and raided Jiruft, killing, harrying and destroying. Kirman was practically deserted and the province laid waste. Malik Dinar of the Ghaz tribe, about A.H. 581 (A.D. 1185), established himself on the throne, upon which followed as usual, intrigues and counter-intrigues of rival and succeeding claimants, till the great Mongol irruption under Changiz Khan indirectly changed the course of its history, when a certain Borak Hajib managed to assume supreme con trol, under the overlordship of Changiz Khan. One of his successors, the widow of Kutb-ud-Din, was on the throne when Marco Polo passed through on his outward journey. She appears to have ruled wisely and well, to have founded villages, which are still flourishing, and many qandt pipes stamped with her name are even yet extant in the province. She died about A.H. 681 (A.D. 1282). It is interesting to note that Arghun Khan, reigning about A.D. 1290, i sent embassies to the Pope and the kings of France and England, while Edward I accredited Geoffrey de Langely to the Court of the Mongol, with a return embassy and presents. .-Ir was at this period, as noted by Marco Polo, that Hormuz was under Kirman. About A.H. 741 (A.D. 1340) the MuzafE t dynasty was founded, but came to an end in A.H. 796 (A.D. 1393), its chief claim to fame being that the poet Hafiz flourished under its patronage. The history of the next 200 years contains little of interest, beyond a long and changing list of kings and chiefs and murders and trea chery, till in the year A.H. 1005 (A.D. 1596) Ganj ’All Khan, Zik, stands out as a great leader in war, and in peace as a builder of numerous caravanserais, bazars, and tanks, as well as being a successful invader of Baluchistan. In 1720 Mahmud of Kandahar seized and used the province as a base for his march on Isfahan, and, having defeated the Persians at Gulnabad, finally captured the capital, murdering hundreds of thousands of its inhabitants. A few years later these atrocities were revenged by Nadir Quli, a robber chief, who having practically exterminated the invaders, penetrated into Afghanis 'an in A.H. 1148 (A.D. 1735), but was eventually murdered in A.H. 1160 (A.D. 1747). On his death anarchy again ensued till Shahrukh Khan, Afshar, obtained possession of Kirman, which he ruled till A.H. 1172 (A.D. 1758), when he vas ousted and killed by Karim Khan, Zand. In A.H. 1204 (A.D. 1789) Lutf ’AH Khan, who had obtained a reputation for heroism unequalled in Persia, succeeded to the throne, but was finally defeated and treacherously killed by the Kajar Eunuch, who, seizing Kirman, sold 20,000 women and children into slavery, and put out the eyes of 35,000 of its inhabitants. In A.H. 1216 (A.D. 1801) the then Governor Ibrahim Khan, a member of the Kajar tribe, did much to restore the former prosperity of the district, rebuilding towns, digging qandts, and founding villages. Minor alarums and excursions were again the order of the day, till in A.H. 1276 (A.D. 1859) Muhammad Isma’il Khan came to Kirman, first as Minister and eventually as Governor, and left there a reputation as one of its great rulers; the present comparatively prosperous condition of the province being the principal monument of his fame. Since then governor has followed governor for longer or shorter periods of office, the present ruler being (in A.D. 1905) His Highness the Kukn- ud-Dauleh, who is a first cousin of the Shah. The province is ruled by a Governor-General, resident in Kirman, who Administration. ^ as _ jurisdiction over the whole of Persian Baluchistan as well: under him are the Governors of the various districts, into which the province is divided. The revenues of these districts _ are farmed out to the Governors, who extract what they can from t)ie inhabitants, paying the necessary sums to the Governor-General, and retaining the balance for themselves They seem to trouble themselves little about the material prosperity of their people, or the administrative progress of their districts. The communications of the Kirman. province, as a whole, are in a very Communications. backward state. No trouble is taken to repair . . . tk® roads, or maintain security on them; many o£ the trade routes, in consequence, are shut for months at a time, owiim to the depredations of bands of robbers and outlaws.

John.) The capital of the province of Kirman was originally situated in Bardsir, and it was not till the time of Ibn Ilias (A.H. 315, A.D. 928) that the town on the present site became the capital. The original town and fort are reputed to have been founded by Ardashir about A.D. 220; though with regard to this there is considerable uncertainty. At the time when Indian trade with Europe went across Russia instead of round the Cape, the city was the second in importance in Persia. Kirman is mainly surrounded by desert, absolutely devoid even of bushes, but, lying as it does at the junction of many roads, it is naturally important as a trade centre. For its water it is entirely dependent on qanats (Sykes, 1902), though every house has, besides, its well, the water- level being some 50 feet below the surface, and the water being fair to brackish. There is a fine supply of water, but as a rule owing to the open channels through which it runs it is most impure and wells are not safe to use as a rule as sewage percolates into them. There are certain mineral properties in the water that are liable to cause stomach complaints. With the exception of some limestone crags in the immediate neighbour hood of the city, Kirman is some 8 miles from any range, while south-west, south and south-east, a wide belt of sandhills extends ; but further off, 20 miles to the south-east, the Jupar mountains attain an elevation of close on 13,000 feet, while to the north lies the Kuh Paleh range (about 10,000'). The sandy nature of its soil, its considerable altitude (5,680') and the scarcity of water, accounts for the great healthiness of the city. Approaching Kirman from the east, the city presents a somewhat con fused medley of wind-towers and mosques, surrounded by ruins on every side, giving it the squalid appearance common to so many oriental towns. Half a mile to the east of the city rises a limestone crag, some 500 feet above the plain, upon which are built the two forts of Kirman. 2E 2348 KIB-KIR The first—Kaleh Ardashlr, (dating back probably to A.D. 220)—has its walls of colossal sun-dried brick, resting on stone foundations, still in almost perfect order; below, on a westerly spur, is a second keep, between which the road winds up to the castle on the crest, which possesses a triple line of defence. According to legend its ancient well was con nected with Khabis, but so many murders were committed by throwing the victims down it, that it was filled up about 1860. The second fort, Kaleh-i-Dukhtar, or virgin’s fort, is situated on another crag of smaller dimensions, half a mile north-west of Kaleh Ardashir, and between these two the principal buildings, including the palace and mes- que, were situated, but now all is in ruins ; there are, however, still found there many valuable lustred tiles, bronzes, seals and coins of the Caliphate, etc., etc., which the villagers occasionally dig up and bring in for sale. On the southern spur of the main crag is a detached cliff, with 143 steps hewn out of the rock leading up it; immediately below is-the deserted quarter of Farmitan, said to have been destroyed by the Afghans about A.D. 1750. High up among the crags to the east is a small shrine and spring, the Tak-i-’Ali, which is believed to be connected with the Zindeh Hud, and is said to have run red at the time of the massacres at Isfahan in the eighteenth century. In the plain the ruins lie thick, tombs and mosques jostling each other for places. The only stone building in Kirman is one of octagonal shape, surmounted by a bracketed dome, the apex being of brick ; it is known as the Jabalia, and is believed by the Persians to be the “ Dome of Gabr,” or “Dome of the Fire Worshipper,” the origin of which had been lost in antiquity, even before the conversion of Kirman into a capital. Moving westwards towards the modern city, the Bagh-i-Zirisf which covers an area of half a square mile, and in which the British Consulate is now situated, is approached; beyond it, and following the ancient city walls, the modern Zoroastrian quarter is reached. Touching it to the north is their old suburb destroyed by the Afghans in 1750, the chief min ' of which is known as the Khaneh Farang; outside, again, is the race-course, half a mile in Lngth. On the south-west side are the remains of the lines of in vestment of Agha Muhammad Khan, when he besieged Kirman about 1793. The city is surrounded by a clay wall in a good state of repair, about 30 feet high, with a ditch 40 feet wide and 10 feet deep, forming an irregular hexagon, measuring roughly a mile from east to west, and slightly more from north to south. It is divided into five quarters— (1) Shahr, including part of ancient Kirman, (2) Khwaja Khizr, (3) Kutbabad, (4) Maidan-i-Kaleh, (5) Shah Adil, and three extra-mural quarters— j (a) Glabri, (6) Mahuni, (c) Jumuiidl. Touching it on the west side is the Ark or fort, in which the Governor- General resides, and containing the post and telegraph offices, barracks and arsenal; all in good repair.There are six gates and roads leading from the city— (1) Baghin Gate. (2) Sultan! Gate (said to be the work of Shah Rukh, circ. A.D. 1425). (3) Gabr Gate. (4) Nasir! Gate. (5) Masjid Gate (entered by the Kajar Conqueror). (6) RIgabad Gate. There are about 90 mosques in Kirman, but only three of any import, viz., (a) Masjid-i-Malik, founded by the Seljuk Malik Turan Shah ( A.D. 1084—1096), and since entirely rebuilt ; (6) Masjid-i-Jami (or Masiid Muzaffar) built in A.D. 1349 ; (c) Masjid-i-Pa-Minar built about A.D. 1390. There are six madrasehs or colleges, that founded by Zahir-ud-Dauleh being of interest; and 50 baths and 8 caravanserais, the best being that built by the first Vakil-ul-Mulk, about A.D. 1860. The bazars are -well built, straight, high fairly broad and commodious, the main one running right through the centre of the town, nearly east and west. Until 1896, when an earthquake completed its ruin, the Qubbeh Sabz or Green Dome, was the most conspicuous building in Kirman. It was the tomb of the Kara Khitai dynasty, and consisted of a curious cylindrical building, 50 feet high, with greenish blue mosaic work outside, and is said to have been erected in A.D. 1242. It is now a shapeless mass of ruins. The population of Kirman was estimated (in 1902-03) as 50,000, divided as follows :— Shi’ah Muhammadans .. .. .. 37,000 Sunni „ .. .. .70 Babls* (Behai) .. .. .. 3,000 „ (Ezeli) .. .. .. 60 Shaikhis .. .. .. 6,000 Sufis .. .. .. .. 1,200 Jews .. .. .. ... 160 Zoroastrians (Parsis) .. .. .. 1,700 Hindus .. .. .. .. 20 Total .. 49,210 Newcomen in 1905 estimated it at 75,000. The post office is in charge of a Belgian official, the mails running bi-weekly to Tehran, and with fair regularity to Bandar Abbas, taking 15 days on the journey (1904). A weekly service also runs to Bain, and may be extended later to Sistan (200 miles). The Central Persian Telegraph line, which was constructed by the Indo- European Telegraph Department, via Kashan, Earn, Yazd, Kirman, Bam, and Persian Baluchistan, reached Kirman from the west in October 1903, and Bam in January 1904. In May 1904 it was linked up with the Indian system at Robat (Kuh-i-Malik Siah), and is now to be connected with Karachi. * Chirol estimates that one Persian in every five is a Babi.350 KIR—KIR ' The Imperial Bank of Persia opened a branch at Kirman, under Yazd, in 1904. , , , Camels, bred in the district and in Khorasan, form the chief means of carriage ; a few mules are raised in the hills, Transport. an( ^ ( j on ^ ;e y S are numerous everywhere. In 1905 the rate of transport from Kirman to Bandar Abbas and vice versa averaged 7£ to 8 tumans per 650 lb ; from June to September it is slightly higher. A small hospital for men and women was opened in 1901 by the C.M.S., and has a competent staff.* There were (in 1905) six English missionaries stationed in Kirman, including a doctor and a lady doctor. The moral standard of the town is a very low one, lower it is said than in any other portion of Persia. The women are famous for their beauty and debauchery; and are looked upon practically as slaves among the middle and lower classes. Temporary marriages, from a few days to a few years, are the rule here, as elsewhere in Persia ; and these can be dissolved at any time by the temporary husband, he having the right to claim any offspring. Venereal disease is rampant, 75 per cent, of the population suffering from syphilis and gonorrhoea. Blindness, defective eyesight and skin complaints, due to dirt, are very widespread. The people are rapidly ruining their con stitutions by opium-smoking, which is almost universal, even girls of 13 or 14 years of age indulging in it.

There are 1,000 looms at work in the city, and about 130 more in the district, apart from the weaving carried on by the nomad tribes. Silk carpets are also manufactured, the ordinary size being 7' x 4i', at a price of £10 to £15 a piece. Shawls, woven from the down of the goat, or from wool, reach an output of about £60,000 per annum. The minor industries are the manufacture of felt, overcoats {aba) and brass work.— {Brazier-Creagh, 1894 ; Rittich, 1900 \ Sykes, 1902 ; Newcomen, 1905.) * A school has lately been started, the pupils numbering 100 boys and 60 girls and the English class consisting of 23 children (1904).KIRMANABAD— A small village in Kirman, 125 miles from Kirman city, on tlie route to Blrjand.— [Stewart.)

It is a small place of reed huts.— (Smith.) KOH— A village in Larak island (q.v.). KtHAK— Elev. 2,920'. A strong fort and small district in Persian Baluchistan. It lies in the lower part of the Mashkid valley, on the borders of British Baluchistan, and is bounded on the north by the watershed of the Kuh-i-Siahan as far as a point about 10 miles slightly west of north of Kuhak itself, from thence it runs in a south-easterly direction to the Mashkll river, 7 miles west of its junction with the Rakhshan stream. Then, following the bed of the Mashkll, it runs in a westerly direction to a hill on the north bank of the river, about miles below the junction of the Gazbastan stream with the Mashkil, almost immediately south of Kuhak fort. Its western border consists of an undefined line running north and south somewhere between Isfandak and Dehak, but where it joins the southern boundary, is not at all clear. Its extent then is roughly some 35 to 40 miles long, and about 18 miles broad, and consists of a vast glacis of gravel sloping gently upwards from the Mashkil to the foot of the rugged Siahan, which rises here to a height of 6,500 feet. The bed of the Mashkil is large, and its towering banks point to its having been once a mighty river, but now even in spate, the torrent is readily forded after the first rush. In March 1896, there was only a foot of water at the ford, below Kuhak. The district contains various date-groves and hamlets, but Isfandak and Kunar Basteh are the only ones that require mention. Geographically Kuhak occupies an important position, as through it passes all the trade up and down the Mashkil valley, which forms the main route between Bampur and Panjgur in British^ territory. There is a Customs Frontier Post at Kuhak under Sistan. Historically Kuhak is of great interest. It is said that originally it belonged to Dizak, but was conquered early in the nineteenth century by a Naushirvani chief of Kharan, who married the daughter of the rightful owner, after putting the latter to death. There is no doubt that it formed part of the dominions of Nasir Khan I of Kalat after the death of Nadir Shah. However, Persia unceasingly put forward claims to Kuhak in common with the rest of western Baluchistan, and supported them by355 force on every possible occasion. Many times did they besiege the fort, but never successfully. In 1871-72 a Boundary Commission, under General Sir Frederick Gold- smid, was despatched by the Imperial Government to demarcate the border between British and Persian territory. This was satisfactorily done from Kuhak southwards to the sea ; but northwards, as far as Sistan, the country was unexplored and of unknown ownership, and so was left alone ; while the difficulties encountered by the British representative, in dealing with his Persian colleague, were found to be so insuperable, that the commission had to break up. The Shah would not accept the arbitrator’s decision, and the final agreement with the Tehran Court left Kuhak and Mashkil together with a long stretch of frontier up to the Helmand, mostly undefined and unmapped. As soon as the British Commission was out of the country, the Persians seized the district of Kuhak, though whether they actually captured the fortress is uncertain. No action, however, was taken by the British Government till 1896, when, the raids across the border becoming intoler able, another Boundary Commission, under Colonel Sir Thomas Holdich, was appointed, and boundary-pillars set up from Kuhak to Kuh-i-Malik Siah, by which Kuhak was definitely handed over to the Persians.—(For further 'particulars regarding this Commission vide Mh jdud.) In 1902, when a British and a Persian force were co-operating against the outlaws and turbulent factions of this part of Baluchistan, its chief, Mir Ghulam Muhammad, at first refused to come in and make his submission to the Governor-General of Persian Baluchistan; but owing to the good offices of Major Showers, the Political Agent of Kalat, a rupture was avoided, and the Governor-General finally presented Ghulam Muhammad with a khilat, and a letter (in which he w r as described as a Persian subject) saying that he might retain his fort, subject to future good behaviour. In March 1902, the following description of the Kuhak fort was supplied by Lieutenant Hart, It.A., who visited and sketched it:— The fort is built on an apparently solid plinth some 20 feet high, with the main wall rising another 20 feet above this, protected at the south-west corner by a terrace, and by a stone loopholed wall for half its height. Two mam towers rise from the centre, one about 60, the other 70, feet from the ground. The walls appear to be about 2 feet thick, loopholed every 6 feet. The entrance to the fort seems to be by a passage on the north side, leading up through the solid plinth. The fort is surrounded by an outer wall i0 feet Irgh and 2 feet thick flanked by four towers at the corners. The entrance through the outer wall is by a big gate house on the western side close to its north-western corner. This wall is not loop- holed. The approaches are through cultivated fields on all sides, except the western, where it leads over a hill, while date palms to within ICO yards afford fair cover. Hills surround and command the fort oh all sides, offering mariy good gun positions, from which the fort could be shelled at a range of 500 ^ards.

KtJHTAK— A village in the Shahrl district of Kirman, 19 miles from Sikunkan, on the road to Kahn-i-’Ali. It consists of a few palm and tamarisk huts. The water-supply is h om four wells, of which the upper ones are slightly and the two lower ones very brackish. There is a good camping-ground for a large force. The camel-grazing is excellent, but no supplies are procurable.—(Medley and Massy, July 1893.) KUHURAKAN— A village in the Geh district of Persian Baluchistan.— {Hdji 'Abdul Nabi 1839.) KUIK or QUlK— % A hamlet in the Bariskhan district of Kirman, 12f miles from the tele graph office of Jashk, and about 4 miles from the old town of Jashk on the road to Anguran.358 KUI—KUL It consists only of a few miserable reed huts. There is no cultivation, and no supplies are procurable, but fair camel-grazing is to be had. To the west of the village is a large ndld, about 200 yards wide, with banks 30 feet or 40 feet high, whch runs in a south-westerly direction down to the sea. Though dry when Medley visited it in June, it is said to contain a good deal of water in the rains. The water-supply is from shallow wells dug under the right bank of this nald, and although scanty, is of good quality. This nald is probably what Lorimer calls the Kvaik stream .—{Medley and Massy, June 1893.) KtfKAM— A village in the Shamil district {q.v.). KULlNl— A halting-place in the Sarbaz district of Persian Baluchistan, on the east ern of the two roads from Bampur to Sarbaz. These roads divide at Kahir {q.v.), which would be the fourth stage from Bampur. Pagodar {q.v.) on this road is about 7 miles east of Kahiri; but travellers if they stopped at the latter would probably pass it. The road from thence follows the 'plsh- choked ravine for about a mile and a half, to the foot of the watershed range. After crossing, the road immediately enters the Kulani ravine, which is the main branch of the Sarbaz river {q.v.). The pass over the range appears to be easy. As there is tamarisk and water in the ravine, a halt could be made here, say at 11 or 12 miles from Kahiri. Thence the track descends the bed of the watercourse {see Sarbaz River), and appears to be tolerably good for camels. There are pools of w T ater under the rocks at intervals. Kulani is reached 17 miles from Pa Gudar halting-place, that is probably about 14 miles from the crest of the pass and 13 from the halting-place on this side of it. The regular camping-ground on the right of the stream was found by Sir F. Goldsmid’s party, who travelled by this road in Feb ruary 1871, to be so infested with camel ticks and bugs, that they were obliged to shift to the other side, Wood and water are abundant at this stage. From Kulani the road continues to descend the ravine {see Sarbaz River), and at 13 miles is joined by the Ispatki road {q.v.) which comes from the north-west by north down the ravine from that place. Sarbaz itself is reached 6 miles further on. This route is about 10 miles longer than that via Ispatki, but is better, insomuch that there are narrow places on the latter where baggage animals have to be unloaded. Nevertheless, it appears to be the most used by Jcafilehs and people of the country, while the Kulani route is adopted by the Persians for the movement of their troops and artillery. The passage of guns, how ever, along this road can be no light or easy matter.— {Euan-Smiih.) KUL! DAP— Elev. 2,450'.

The left bank is 15 feet high and the right bank 5 feet, and the former, being sandy, is apt to be washed away and after rains becomes precipitous. After receiving the drainage of the Kahur and Talab streams it is known as the Shandamulla, which name it continues to bear up to its junction with the Kaskin river.— (Brazier- Creagh, 1894 ; Wood, 1899.)

KURDS of SARHAD— Certain families of Kurds, the well-known warlike tribe of the Perso* Turkish Frontier districts, have long been established in Sarhad, the chief of which country belongs to this race. {See Sarhad.) At present we know very little about them, but it is probable that they came to Sarhad in much the same way as the Kurds of Khorasan became located in that province, that is, they were induced to settle there as a check on the Balhchis. But quis custodiet custodies ipsos? The courage and raiding talents of the Kurds were highly appreciated by the Baluchis, and the elevated plateau of Sar had, difficult of access on almost every side, afforded them a secure base from which the chiefs, assisted by the local tribes, could lead forays in every direction. There is no doubt they plundered in Persia quite as much as in Baluch territory. It appears that while fully aware of, and ac knowledging, their origin, the Kurds of Sarhad now call themselves Baluch— a name which, despite St. John and some others, is held in high repute throughout Southern Afghanistan, Eastern Persia, and the country which we are pleased to call Baluchistan. In 1838 Haji ’Abdul Nabi found Madafc Khan, Kurd, the dreaded chief of Sarhad ; but it would appear that, like the Naushlrvani Chief of Kharan, and others in this region, he had no great number of his own tribesmen with him, his retainers being said to consist of Persians (among whom Kurds are perhaps included), Bamarl, and Damani Baluchis.KUR—KUR 384 The power of the Kurd chiefs of Sarhad continues almost undiminished to the present day, although within the last few years they have submitted to the Persian Governor of Bampur. (See also Sarhad.) In 1881 General Gasteiger Khan, a German officer in the Persian service, was sent on a special mission to the Baluch frontier. In his published narrative of the journey from Tehran to Jalk, he gives the following highly coloured account of his meeting with Said Khan, the present chief of Sarhad, at Vasht (q.v.) in that country:— I had special instructions for the chieftain Said Khan, so I sent an orderly a few days in advance to inform him of my coming, and to tell him I had orders from His Majesty the Shah, and also that I had selected Chash (Vasht) as a halting-place on my journey to Jalk. The chieftain was at this tijne along with his tribe in the hills which form the line of demarcation between Sistan and Baluchistan. I shall first relate the past career of this prince and then introduce him to the reader. About two hundred years ago the ancestors of Said Khan emigrated to this place from Kurdistan, being induced to do so by Shah ’Abbas the Great, from whom they received large grants of land, free from taxes, for ever. The Kurds, accustomed from boyhood to an unsettled life, and having a predilec tion for fighting and plunder, found here, where they were surrounded by a wild mountain people, a congenial life and a favourable field for their profession of robbery and murder. So powerful were they, that the present chieftain has gained a great reputation by his success in raiding all the surrounding people for the last twenty years. He accomplished the most daring feats, and at the head of his tribe invaded the pro vinca, of Khorasan. Only a few miles from the gates of Tehran he emptied the well-filled granaries be longing to the wealthy farmers in the plain of Varamin. Returning heavily laden with plunder, he made many more daring expeditions in the neighbourhood of Ispahan, Yazd, and Kirman. His success gave him great influence, and he soon made an alliance with the robber hordes of Afghanistan, and also sometimes lent troops to a less powerful chieftain, named Azad Khan, who was the ruler of Kharan, and had a force of about 10,000 men.* I heard later that these chieftains are still feared by the Government. When no robber expeditions were going on, Said Khan used to return to the moun tains, where he occupied his time in pleasure, agriculture, and rearing cattle. The fertile plains give proof of his industry. Several times the Persian Government tried to win over this daring chieftain ; but it either did not choose the right means, or the chief was too crafty or cunning to trust in the plausible speeches of the emissaries of the Shah who tried to entrap him. Since the battle of Chash (i,e. Vaslit), where he was only conquered by the two guns which the Government troops brought to bear against him, he has aided the Government to subdue some of the rebel tribes, and the Shah has showered honours on him for those services. At last, worn out by the constant changes, hemmed in by the English in Afghanistan and the Russians in Turkistan,f and dispirited by the condition of the people, who b i ! me very much reduced in circumstances owing to the general drought which had prevailed for several years, Said Khan was compelled to try and inaugurate an .i b’e relations with the Government ; and to effect this was the object of my mission to him. * Said Khan can hardly have been in alliance with any Afghan. A few from the Helmand valley may occasional y have joined his plundering expeditions. Azad Khan, whose force is not above half of what is here stated, appears to have been generally at war with the Sarhadls ; in some of his raids he has been assisted by the Baraichis of Shurawak .—[See Kharan in Gazetteer of Baluchistan.) | It is hardly necessary to remark that the English and Russ'an movements can have bad no effect whatever on Said Khan. Gasteiger writes as if this leader of bandits was sovereign of an independent State.I was the first to arrive at the place appointed for our meeting, and I pitched my tent at the foot of his robber’s nest, and waited for the roaring lion. He came accompanied by his two sons, and disarmed himself in front of my tent, retaining only a dagger in his belt. He was over fifty years of age and of splendid physique, with decision of character shown in his features, a pleasant voice, free and abrupt mannersi He stood before me in his Afghan dress, without constraint, but with dignity. It was a critical moment when this man, whose doings had often made the whole of Persia tremble, and whose life was principally occupied by murder, arson, robbery, and slave-dealing, stood before me. After a short but friendly greeting, I addressed him in the following words : “In the name of mine and your imperial master, whose head radiant with diamonds you have never had the honour to behold, I deliver to you his gracious wishes. His Majesty knows and honours your bravery, and it is his supreme will to strengthen our alliance ; and believe me I belong to a country where the first virtue of man is to keep his word. He answered : “ I disarmed myself before your tent, and I now hand you my dagger; but I have three hundred well-armed men waiting behind the mountain, ready to obey my signal. I know that your escort is composed of sixty men only, and also that you carry no valuables with you, but I believe if I were to take you prisoner, the Shah or your relatives in your own country would ransom you for a heavy sum. But the ruins, which have overlooked many a hard-fought battle, still belong to me and are my home in which you are a guest; and no Kurd ever violated the laws of hospitality.' We were soon deep in conversation, and I made a report to His Majesty of our arrangements, the principal of which were as follows : Said Khan places 1,000 well- armed men at the disposal of the Government. He asks for 100 pickaxes and shovel for purposes of cultivation, 10 pairs of draught oxen, and 150 sacks of grain for seeds besides the old privilege granted by Shah ’Abbas of holding his lands free of revenue, These demands were so moderate and reasonable that I thought the Government would agree to them. We also considered the absolute necessity of entrenching a posi tion for a war depot at this place, which is so situated that direct communication with the rear by Rigan could be established without going near Bampur, and also with Jalk in the front. It could also be made a point of concentration against the frontier of Siskin and against the tribes of Baluchistan. As I am writing Said Khan has offered to help with 500 men against the Bashakard tribes, who are just now in rebellion, having refused to pay the taxes. This expedition wM be commanded by General Ibrah'm Khan, and accompanied by His Highness the prince.governor. Said Khan presented me with a shield as a memento, and made the following speech: “ This shield has saved my life several times, and I hope it may render the same service to you. ’ ’ KURGAR or Khargar—Lat. 29° 16' 20'; Long. 61° O' 15'; Elev. 5,189'.

There are large quantities of pomegranates. Adour grazing for camels and donkeys is plentiful. There are two very large qandts, the northern coming from a kdriz, the southern from a ndld. The water of both is very good. Kurftk was said to be the largest and most famous village of Narmashir. There is a very old fort, stated to date back to the Afghan period. There are two detachments of sarbdzes, each consisting of 88 men. They possess 176 Werndl rifles. These, however, are not of much use as the men have only self-reloaded cartridges, with bad powder. The English are here held in high esteem. Many of the inhabitants had made the acquaintance of the English during the Makran Expedition.— (Newcomen, 1905; Gibbon, 1908.)

A beautiful valley in Sarhad among the western spurs of the Kflh-i-Chehil Tan. It must have been a place of considerable importance in the old feudal times of Said Khan I, the head of the Kurds, who inhabited this valley, and was Saidar of Sarhad. The hillsides are pierced by old cavesand passages where lived the robber bands and outlaws who raided the plains of Sarhad and Bazman in the days gone by.

It may be recognized by the fort, which stands on a peculiar little isolated hill, or rock, close to the I eastward of it, and is 80 to 100 feet high. There are some date trees round the village. The inhabitants are chiefly fishermen. The nearest hills are 2 miles or so from the coast and fall back from hence north-north-eastward, the plain between them and the sea increasing in width to the northward appears to be the same as Kuhistak.— {Constable ; Stifle ; Persian Gulf.

It consists of a very fine date-grove and plenty of cultivated land. Supplies are procurable in fair quantities, and fuel and water are abundant. The road between Kutaich and Daggaz is an extremely rough and difficult one. In the village is a tiny fort, while the population numbers 80 families or perhaps 500 persons.— {Sykes, 1902.) KUTAL JANIN— A neck joining two out of four conical flint hills.

Ladgasht is one of the outlying date-groves described in the article Jalk. Askan is 15 to 20 miles south-east, the intervening country being a level plain with date trees and the remains of cultivation. Dehgwar (q. v.) is the same distance, or more, to the north-west. There are no per manent habitations or cultivation at Ladgasht on account of the insecu rity of the country. Water from wells is good and abundant; firewood and camel forage also plentiful.— [MacGregor.) LADGUJ0 or LADGAJU— A village in Makran on the Maluran river [q.v). LADl— Elev. 1,500'. A village in the Bampur district, 10 miles west of Kalanzau, on the road to Bijnabad, and about 67 miles west-north-west of Bampur. It is situated in quite a forest of tamarisk and thorn trees, some of fair size and appearance. Flocks are numerous, and there is good grazing for camels. The inhabitants are poor Baluch shepherds. Euan-Smith says there are two wells here, both brackish, but one some what better than the other. In 1881 General Gasteiger Khan was sent to report on this place as a post station on a new military road through Persian Baluchistan. It (with the others on this road) was to be colonized and surrounded with high walls for the protection of the inhabitants ; but this project does not seem to have been carried out.— [Goldsmid ; Euan-Smith ; Gasteiger Khan ; Brazier-Creagh, 1^94.) LlDlS— Lat. 28° 53' 52' ; Long. 61° 15' 18' ; Elev. 4,186'. A small district in Sarhad, about 53 miles north of Vasht. It is situ ated on the banks of the Ladis river, which flows in an easterly direction towards Mirjawa [q.v-), and consists of a ruined village and fort, deserted years ago, with a little wheat cultivation. The soil is good ; there is an unlimited supply of water from the river ; camel-grazing is abundant; but fuel is scarce, and other supplies are nil. The fort is reputed to have been built about A.D. 1400 by Timur Shah Tartar, but is now abandoned owing to the undermining action of water on the clifis on which it stands.Tlie district contains 7 haskams or tent encampments. Starting from the west, and going down the right bank of the river, these are :— (1) Dizak, (2) Barziar, (3) Bangan, (4) Ladis, (5) Allnjan, (6) Mir Kuh, (7) Andai. (1) Dizak has no tents, and is the name given to a ruined fort and a spring of water, round which there is good grazing. (2) Barziar —30 tents ; 150 people ; wheat and barley, 65 Indian maunds ; cotton, 12 Indian maunds ; sheep, 500 ; cows, 30 ; donkeys, 20 ; camels, 10 ; labourers, 10 ; 1 qandt, sweet.

There are also numerous nomads in the neighbourhood, who possess, it is said, 20,000 sheep and goats, while the grazing is absolutely without limit. Ladis at one time was a place of great importance, but the incessant Damani raids have depopulated and ruined the country, which only needs peace to be once more prosperous. The Damanis have carried their raids as far a$ Birjand and the Helmand, and till they are settled with, there can be no hope for the country. With an altitude of 4,000 feet v Kuh-i-Taftan as a neighbouring hill station, an excellent climate, and the possibilities of very extensive irrigation, Ladis must in time rise again to importance, as forming the only cultivated area lying between Rigan and Nushki. —{Jennings ; Sykes, 1898 ; Wood, 1899 ; Tighe, 1902.) LAFT (Village)—Lat. 26° 53' 49' ; Long. 55° 46' 9'. A considerable village situated on the western side of the great salient from the north coast of Qishm island, of which the extremity is Laft point; Laft village, situated in a recess of the coast, is about 3| miles south- south-east of the point. It is built at the foot of a hill which slopes up from the beach to a height of 200 feet and ends in cliffs on the land ward side. The approach to Laft is by a small narrow creek opening from the Guran branch of Clarence S rait ; its mouth is marked by a low islet called Hindram and its course to the village, a distance of over 2 miles, is between the coast of Qishm island and a mangrove-covered mud-flat which divides the creek from Kaur Guran. In this creek native vessels lie. The village is close to the shore and consists of about 250 houses of Arabs and Persians, not belonging to well-known tribes, who are chiefly engaged in fishing and boat-building and in cutting firewood for873 LAF—£AK [ Bale from the adjacent swamps. The water-supply, which is from roofed tanks, is slightly brackish ; there are also some wells sunk 25 to' 30 feet in the sandstone rock which are used when the tanks run dry. Provisions in small quantities are available; livestock comprise about 20 cattle and 200 sheep and goats. There are three ordinary mosques, but the place has no local shrine. The hill behind Laft is scarped and the scarps are strengthened at their crests with curtains and flanking works which, with a dilapidated fort having 5 circular towers pierced for guns, appear to be traces of a former European occupation. The Imperial Persian Customs have a post here.— (Lorimer, 1906.) LIFT QADlM— A place in Qishm Island (q.v .). 1 LAGUA- A lake in the Kusha valley, Sarhad.

It bears evidence of being an extinct volcano with lovely, pellucid water filling up the- crater. It is circular in shape, being about 300 yards long by 250 wide ; the sides are precipitous, shelving straight down, and it must be very deep. The southern and eastern banks are fringed in parts with long dense reeds, and the centre of the lake is black with large flocks of duck, teal and water hens, which lie tantalisingly beyond gun range.— (Brazwr-Creagh, 1894.)

The channel between Larak and Q?sh™ to the north-west of it is 6 miles, and that between Larak and Hormu z to the north-north-east 11 miles broad. Larak is oval-shaped and measures 6 mi es from east-north-east to west-south-west by about 4 miles across • the chief irregularity of outline is a small sandy cape wlich Tuts out from the north coast. The island is closely surrounded by deen water, except on the west side, from which a shore-reef extends for about £ mile. The interior consists of a mass of rugged bilk nf c ri + with an admixture of rock-salt and red oxide of iron TLh^re almost entirely destitute of vegetation ; the highest summit, a mile from the north shores 510 feet high and another a mile to the south-west “ hardW inferior in elevation. There is no vegetation ; sweet water with tlT exception of that of the Salmi well, is not found unless in’reservoirs There are many wild garelle, which are exceedingly shy The inhabi' tents, about 200 in number, are Dhahuriyin, but aredojy conLted to’ the Shihuh tribe of Kumzar and they sneak the jrZLT? * There is no trade except in salt, of which some quantity is exported to adjoining district of Buus-aWibal in the Sultanate of ’oS and to Qishm town, which is the market in which the inhabitants of Larak make _ most of their purchases. The people assert t hat they are independent of374 LAR-LAR any ruler except of their own Kumzari Shaikh at Labtiab village, and up to 1905 A.D. no visible signs of Persian authority existed, but the island was said to be nominally included, along with the islands of Qishm and Hormuz, among the places at present farmed by the Mu in-ut-lujjar of Tehran. Larak seems to have been at one time occupied by a non-Muhammadan people, for a flat-topped hill on the east coast is covered with hundreds_ of graves! all of which run east and west. A large valley between Labtiab village and this curious hill and all the flat ground upon the circumference of the island appear to have been highly cultivated at some former time , the evidence consists in remains of water-channels and embankments. The following table embodies the chief facts of the topography of Name of place. Kuh . Labtiab Larak . Salmi . Position. Houses and inhabi tants. In the interior of the island.

Remarks. gers, graziers and fishermen, owning boats. Water is from 2 reservoirs and live stock amount to 50 sheep and 200 goats. Date trees number about 50 and a patch or two of barley are culti vated. There are the ruins of an old fort and the ground near by, ^called Kharabistan, bears traces of former occupation by a civilised people. This village is also called Larak and is the chief one on the island. It has a date-grove and near by is an old fort in toler able repair, said to be Portuguese. There is sweet water from one well and two reservoirs. The people are fishermen and the only industry is a little fish curing ; livestock amount to 5 donkeys and 200 sheep and goats. The people o wn a few small boats, but no large ones. See Labtiab above. A deserted site with a Well of sweet water. (Lorimer, 1906.)LARD-I-AHMADl— A pass on the Bandar Abbas-Sirjan road, about 8 miles from Ahmadl. The pass, which is 3| miles in length and about £ mile wide, is bound ed by steep sandstone cliffs, from 300 to 400 feet in height. It gradually widens into a great saucer-like valley, into which the watershed in the wide plain to the west pours its drainage through another short and very wide valley. The drainage here divides into two, the main drainage running down almost due east, in the direction of the Kuh-i-Ahmadi ; the other overflow channel running south, through the Lard-i-Ahmadi, and ultimately pour ing its water into the Zindan, which drains an enormous area of mountain and plateau.— {Ryan, 1905.) LARKH-I-ZARD— A spring situated on the Duruh-Fareh road, about 6 miles west of Chah-i-Sagak. The water is sweet, but scanty and dirty; some cultivation. -—{Fazal Rahman, 1905 ; Abbas All, 1907.) LASHAR— A district in Persian Baluchistan, south of the Bampur plain. It is understood to be a sub-division of Bampur, but is under its own chief. To the north-west is Maskhutan, also believed to be a sub-division of Bam pur ; to the westisFanuch ; to the south is the large district of Geh ; to the east is the small district of Champ. Lashar is of no great size. It may be 40 miles long by 20 wide. A part of it is open country, adjacent to the sand desert which separates it from Bampur proper, but south of that is the range of the Lashar Kuh and other hills. However, we know very little about it. Pip {q.v.) is the principal place. It is a large village with a fort, and is the residence of the chief. Isfakeh {q.v.) is also a large village. Gurdur and Ughin are small villages. All these are on the road from Bampur to Geh and Chahbar, which has only once been traversed by a British officer— Captain Grant—in 1809. His report is unfortunately very meagre, and is besides out of date. The general characteristics of the country probably resemble those of Maskhutan and Fanuch immediately to the west. The people are call ed Lasharis, but there are also Hots and other Baluch tribes LASHAR KUH— A range of hills forming a part of the southern boundary of the great plain of Bampur, in Persian Baluchistan. In the absence of any definite information it is only possible to hazard a conjecture that they are a con tinuation of Floyer’s Band-i-Nilag running north-east or east-north-east, until they meet Ahuran and the other ranges dividing Bampur from the more elevated country of Sarbaz. The north-eastern end of the Lashar hills is said to form the scarp plateau of Champ, but further south there is no reason to suppose that the country on the Geh side of the hills is more elevated than that on the Bampur side. In fact it is highly probable that its general characteristics resemble that of the tracts to west through which the Aiminx river flows.LAT-LUN \ LATARK— A village near Bazman (q.v.) in Persian Balucliistan.

Long. 60° 23' 20'. Elev. 2,650. Madeh is the name of a small walled mud fort or village (situated 21 miles south-east of Hauz-i-Gudar-i-Zard and 34 miles south-east of Neh on the road to Kuh-i-Malik Siah) about 25 paces square with four towers at the comers. The walls and the towers are still standing and in good condi tion, but the gateway and the roofs of the houses or single rooms inside, about 12 in number built along the walls on three sides, have fallen in. Two brick kilns built for burning bricks for houses and earthenware pipes for kanzes (under-ground irrigation channels) are situated at a short distance from the village. There are bits of lar^je bricks and earthernware pipes scattered about, but no building of burnt bricks exists in the place. The water-supply depends on a kdrlz from which flows a small quantity of brackish water. Some of the wells have fallen in and blocked up the channel, but all are full of water. The water of the higher wells is of better taste than that of the lower wells. If the kdnz is cleared out and repaired, it would yield perfectly drinkable water, sufficient for irrigation of land, the produce of which would support the population of a good-sized village. The village is said to have been built by the late Amir of Kain (Mir ’Alam Khan) about 30 years ago, but w T as neglected after a few years, and the few families that were located in it, left about 12 years ago, owing to scarcity of grain caused by failure of crops for three successive years. The soil contains a small quantity of salt and is apparently not very productive, but it is perfectly fit for cultivation. The village now lies deserted, but if the present chief of Kain could be induce 1 to repopulate it, it would make a good halting-place for caravans going from Persia and Afghanistan to Quetta by Khh-i-Malik Siah. There is a tamarisk jungle near the village and firewood and camel graz ing are plentiful. Bhusa obtainable ; and perhaps 300 to 500 lbs. barley at harve st time.— (Maula Bakhsh; Reunion, 1909.) MADUN J— A halting-place in the Bampur district, said to be situated on the Kaur Gank, 26 miles east of Ramishk in Bashakard, on the road from there to Bampur. Water is obtainable from a river, but there are no supplies.— (Brazier- Creagh, 1S93, from native information.)MAG—MAG 379 A village and small sub district of Bampur m Persian Baluchistan, in the district of Dizak. The village consists of some 130 houses, collected round a high mud fort on the east side of an extensive date grove, and is situated in the middle of the plain, some 3 miles from the southern end of the Kuh-i-BIrg, and about 87 miles east of Bampur. The fort, surrounded by extensive palm groves, is of the usual Balilch The population, estimated at anything from 800 to 2,000, are mostly Population, climate, etc. The people are a fine, hardy, well-to-do looking race. They appear industrious and are sound agriculturists. The climate is very bracing in winter and is said to be comparatively temperate in the hot season and healthy all the year round.

Throughout the date grove, and around the village, neat walled-in gardens are visible, with crenellated coping on top. These gardens contain the following fruit trees, vegetables and flowers Fruit-trees— {sib), peach {hal), mulberry (tut), pomegranate (awfir), grape (angur), pear (amrud), apricots (zarddlu). Flowers—Bone (gid), blue tulip (karchuk), snowdrop^, white violets (bartag). Vegetables and spices.—Onions, beans, brinjdls, turnips, radishes, chillies, anise and coriander. Supplies are obtainable in fair quantities. Barley was scarce in winter. obtainable. The latter, when dry and well-saved, is first-class forage, but is scanty here. Sheep cost Rs. 4 or Rs. 5. Fowls, milk and eggs are also obtain able. There are large flocks of sheep, goats and cattle, also a number of camels and donkeys. The sheep are fine, heavy-framed, fleshy and large-tailed. There are a number of black-fleeced sheep in the herds ; the fleeces are thick and the wool longer than usual. Altogether, these sheep are much fatter than in other districts, and their flesh better-tasting. The higher altitude of these plateaux accounts no doubt for the superiority. Water is obtained from karizeq and is abundant; good fuel is scanty and is brought from the neighbourhood on donkeys. Several caravans bring grain fqom Sistan and return with dates.

MAKRAN (Coast of Persia)— This article relates to so much only of the great tract styled Makran as is situated in Persia and maintains relations with the Gulfs of Persia and’Oman. British Makran, as we may call the portion which is attached to Baluchistan, is excluded from consideration altogether, and in Persian Makran minute consideration will be directed only to the narrow maritime plain which borders the sea. Our subject then, as the title of the article indicates, is primarily the coast of Persian Makran, but the circumstances of the interior are of importance to us in so far as they serve to elucidate the physical, commercial and administrative situation of the coast tract and in that degree will receive attention. Persian Makran is bounded on the south by the Gulf of ’Oman and the Arabian Sea. On the west it extends to and includes Kuh Mubarak, and in the opposite direction it reaches to a point 8 miles east of Gwatar, the termination upon the coast of the frontier between Persia and Kalat which was accepted by the Persian Government in 1871,* its length along the coast is thus roughly 275 miles. On the west, Persian Makran meets the coast district of Biaban and the inland district of Bashakard in Persia; on the east, as already indicated, it is conterminous with the territories of the Khan of Kalat. For present purposes it is unnecessary to define its northern boundary precisely, and it will suffice to state that eastwards of the district of Bashakard that boundary lies between the 27th and 28th parallels of north latitude. The bulk of Persian Makran is a labyrinth of mountains, in some places t Physical characteristics, a , ttalni “g , an , elation of over 6,000 feet, flora and fauna. through which various streams and valleys travel southwards by a devious course to the sea. The rocks are generally sandstone or a conglomerate of sand and shells; they contain no minerals. The larger streams are the Jagin, Gabrig, Sadaich, Rapch, Kair and Dashtiari, which contain water, in deep hollows, more or less throughout the year ; the remainder are mere torrent- beds which after rain are impassable for a day or two, from March to August contain water in pools, and thereafter become dry on the surface but still yield water, at about 10 feet below ground. Water is most scarce in the part between Chahbar and the Chil river. The maritime plain, of which mention has already been made and with which we are more particularly concerned, is bounded on the inland s ; de by a range of hills of which the average height appears to vary from 1,000 to 2,500 feet: this outer range, which has no general name, is not straight or continuous, but nowhere does its distance from the sea much exceed 20 miles and towards both extremities, as well as in the centre between the Rapch and Kair rivers, it approaches with an elevation of over 1,500 feet to within a few miles of the coast. It is composed ordinarily of a light- coloured clay with streaks of gypsum, and is capped with sandstone, which frequently contains fossil remains. The greater part of the maritime plain is a sandy waste diversified by long dunes of sand in certain localities, but here and there occur patches * Remarks on particular physical features, such as the principal hihs and rivers, will be found in the separate article on the Jashk district and in the topographical table at the end of the present article. t See Aitchison’s Treaties, X. 177. 61 I. B, 2 LMAK—MAK S86 of alluvial soil, and the last 7 to 12 miles of the courses of the rivers before reaching the sea are usually characterised by considerable alluvial deposits. Mud volcanoes are met with between the Bir and Kair rivers, and on the sea beach, 15 miles east of New Jashk, there are some hot springs. Trees are not found on this plain except by the banks of rivers, where tamarisks and acacia grow in profusion and even large banyans are some times found; but grass and other small vegetation is fairly plentiful after rain. In the hills of the interior the Pish palm flourishes, and the banyan and even the mango occur in some inland valleys. Wild animals include, in the neighbourhood of the coast, the leopard, wolf, jackal, fox, hyfena, gazelle, ibex, and oorial, while black bears are found in the more northern areas. The bustard, partridge (?), chikor, sisi, pigeon, dove, vulture, kite, falcon and raven are always found and the wild duck, sandgrouse and quail at the seasons of their migra tion southward. The kupper, or adder, scorpion, lizard, centipede and tarantula are all seen, also the viper, which is very common, and the black rocksnake, which is seldom met with. In places mosquitoes are trouble- some. i nir The cold weather lasts from October to April, the hot weather rrom May to October. From the observations at New Climate and seasons. Jashk and Chahbar in 1903 and 1904, it would seem that the maximum winter temperature on the coast varies from 87° to 94° Fahrenheit, and the maximum summer temperature from 94° to 110°. At New Jashk the thermometer has been known to fall in the cold weather to 47°. Bainfall is uncertain, but usually occurs in November, December, January and February, occasionally continuing into March ; the annual rainfall has not been observed but is probably on the average between 6 and 7 inches; it differs c onsiderably from place to place. In summer it would be impossible for Europeans to sleep under canvas by day on account of the heat ; while wherever water exists, mosquitoes and other insect pests frequently make rest impossible. The country is peopled by a medley of tribes, mostly claiming to be descended from Arabs who either originally n a itan s. settled in Makran or removed thither from earlier settlements in Sind and Katch.

The total population of Persian Makran is estimated at 114,000 souls * : the ordinary fighting strength at 6,300 men, armed with Martin and in some cases with magazine rifles, and the additional fighting muster provided with inferior fire-arms at 19,500 men. Almost every, adult carries a sword, pistol or revolver : only the lowest classes, that is the fishermen and herdsmen, go unarmed. The people are all Muhammadans and a vast majority belong to the Sunni persuasion but there are some Slii’ahs chiefly from Minab They are addicted to pilgrimages to local shrines whereat they perform vows. The customs of the people are mostly in accordance with Muhammadan law but in matters of inheritance children by mothers of inferior status do not ordinarily receive their full legal rights. Girls may not be married until the age of puberty. In character the people are peaceable and not inclined to violence. Slavery still prevails in every part of the country and free-born families that do not own one or more slaves are the exception. Most of the slaves are slaves by birth and their condition is ordinarily * The district totals will be found in the separate artilee on the Jashk dis;rict and in the notices of the other districts towards the end of this article.a mild form of domestic and agricultural servitude: tlie master has, however, in the last resort, the power of life and death (in punishment for murder) and the slave has no voice in any matter whatever. The spoken language of the country is a di Ject of Baluchi called Makrani; it contains a considerable admixture of Persian and Arabic words and differs widely from the standard Baluchi spoken in Northern Baluchistan. It is sometimes reduced to Persian characters, but the or dinary medium of communication by writing is Persian, which all chiefs of districts can speak fairly well. Except the Mullas, the entire population is illiterate. Popular ballads in which the deeds of tribes, chiefs of districts and other heroes are extolled, together with songs having similar themes and chanted by roving minstrels of the Lori tribe to the accompaniment of a kind of fiddle, supply the place of literature and the arts. Cultivation, in the maritime plains, is mostly confined to the beds . , , , and banks of rivers, where an alluvial soil 6 exists accompanied by the means of irriga tion, and to places under the hills where rain water is caught and uti lised by means of embankments; there are no canals or regular wells, only water-holes, and the crops depend almost entirely on rainfall, which is deficient on the average in three years out of every four. Near the coast the staple of cultivation is the date, but small quantities of wheat, barley, millet and jowari are grown, also some cotton: in the valleys of the interior the percentage of arable soil is larger, and consider able quantities of dates, wheat, barley, jowari, millet, lentils, rice and cot ton are grown. The winter crop of cereals is sown in November and reaped in April. Manure is not used, and the crops frequently suffer from the depredations of locusts and caterpillars. A wooden plough, re sembling that of India, but much smaller in size, is the principal imple ment of agriculture ; field labour is mostly performed by domestic slaves, and seed-grain is usually obtained from British Indian traders. The portion of the population directly interested in agriculture is small and probably does not exceed 20 per cent, of the whole. One-fifth of the gross produce is the share ordinarily taken by the chiefs of districts or headmen as the revenue of cultivated land. ( Livestock and domestic animals are camels, donkeys, horses, buffaloes, cattle, sheep, goats and dogs, all belonging to indigenous breeds, and of small size ; horses and buffaloes are both scarce. The Jats are the main pastoral tribe ; they live a primitive life, subsisting almost entirely on dates and milk and changing their grazing grounds frequently according to rainfall. The chiefs of districts collect a small tax in money from the owners of herds grazing within their territories. The sea fisheries are an important asset of the part of Persian Makran -r . . with which we have to do. The fish are of jf isncpiGS numerous kinds, and may be roughly divided into two classes, those which are taken for local consumption and those which are caught for export. Most of the first class are procurable throughout the year. Of the second class, about 90 per cent, of the total catch are cured and eventually exported.390 MAK— MAK Fishing is carried on with both net and line, and the bulk of it is carried on by local boats, of which two or three are owned in almost every coast village between Jashk and Gwatar. In April and May however, and again from October to December, Chahbar is the resort of a score of large sized boats owned by Arabs, and of a dozen others from Gwadar which come to take part in the fishing. The fish caught for export, whether by natives or strangers, are cured on the spot by being gutted, rubbed with salt, kept a few days and then washed in the sea and finally dried in the sun. The fish, when thoroughly cured, are sold to Baluch and Indian retail traders, who visit all the places upon the coast periodically in order to purchase them for resale to merchants at Chahbar and Gwadar ; the profits of the fish trade are said to be large, amounting to as much as 40 per cent upon outlay. There are no pearl fisheries upon the Persian Makran coast. The only considerable ports are Jashk, Chahbar and Gwatar, and a , leading part is played in the foreign commerce oreign ra e. 0 f the district by Hindus and Khojahs, British subjects, who reside permanently at Chahbar and Gwatar. The chief exports are dates, 'pish palm mats, dried fish, 'poto or fish- maw isinglass, shark-fins, raw cotton, ghi, goat’-hair, camel-hair, wool and hides in small quantities. The annual value of the exports appears to be about Bs. 1,50,000 at Chahbar and Rs. 50,000 at Gwatar : the trade r of Gwatar is at present depressed by the prevalence of disorder in the neighbouring country. No estimate is possible for Jashk or other smaller ports. The bulk of the exports goes to India, but a portion to Arabian ports. The profits of the export trade are said to run from 15 to 20 per cent, or, in the case of dried fish, from 25 to 40 per cent. Imported goods are principally rice,flour, piece-goods,lead,iron,tobacco, beads, mineral and vegetable oil, matches, tea, cotton thread, silk, spices and sugar, and the profits of the trade are placed at 20 per cent., on the average. The annual value of the Chahbar imports is estimated at Rs. 1,00,000' and that of the Gwatar imports at Rs. 30,000; for Jashk and other ports there are no data. It should also be mentioned that there is a considerable importation, chiefly from Masqat, of modern rifles manufactured in England, France, Germany and Belgium. The internal trade of the country is carried on chiefly by barter, agri- Internal trade and manu- cultural and pastoral products being exhang- factures. e d for dried fish and foreign imported goods. The ports of Jashk, Chahbar and Gwatar are the main trade centres; Tank and Galag also are markets, but petty ones. Business is chiefly in the hands of Baluchi and British Indian traders. The merchandise is transported about the country on camels and donkeys. Manufactures there are none, except of pish palm mats, partly for export, and of swords and pistols for local sale.

The principal weights are the Qiyds, ordinarily equal to about 8 oz. avoirdupois English but varying from place to place, and the Man, which is subject to wide fluctuations between 7 and 15 Engli h pounds. The common measure of length are the Baluchi Gaz or cubit, equal to the distance from a man’s elbow to the tip of his middle finger, or about l£ feet, and the Persian gaz of about 3 feet. Distances are estimated on the coast by time and inland by a farsakh of about 4 miles, which is defined as the space that a walking horse will cover in an hour on ordinary ground. The land-line of the Indo-European Telegraph Department from Gwadar ^ ..to Jashk traverses the whole district, keeping and°transDort 10nS ’ SupP ‘ ieS near the coast : the only offices in Persian P Makran are at Chahbar and Jashk. There is a continuous route along the coast which passes through Jashk, Chahbar and Gwatar, eventually reaching Gwadar ; and the ports of Jashk, Chahbar and Cwndar, as well as some of the smaller places on the coast, are connected with the district capitals of the interior and through them with Bampur, the nearest seat of a high Persian official, by various routes, of which the major portions lie beyond the scope of our inquiry. These routes have been fully worked out, along with a number of cross-routes in the interior, by the mi litary authorities in India.* Here it is sufficient to remark that the roads of the country are all camel-tracks, and that,— though on some there are difficult places,—as lines of communication they are fairly good of their kind. The maritime plain between New Jashk and Gwadar is free from physical obstacles in dry weather and could then, it is reported, be made passable for field artillery in a few days : but the route along it is everywhere liable to be interrupted after rain for one or two days by floods in the torrent beds which cross it from the hills, or for 5, 6, 10 or even 15 days by the larger rivers ; and in the Dashtiari and Bahu districts the country generally is sometimes impassable for a fortnight together. In a dry season the use of the coast route would be strictly limited by scarcity of water, fodder, and other supplies, and it would probably be impossible to move with more than 500 men : it is estimated that in a favourable season, that is, after good rainfall, the local supplies of sheep, goats, ghi and fodder might sufiice to maintain a force of 1,500 men, except in the Dashtiari and Bahu districts, where the water is bitter and a detachment of even 100 men would be supplied with difficulty. In the hills, supplies are at all times less inadequate : some particulars are given in the notes on districts toward the end of this article. Water, slightly brackish, can generally be obtained even in the hot weather from holes in river and torrent beds at a depth of from 4 to 15 feet. There are also some artificial tanks called otags which are filled by rainfall and are frequently not exhausted in less than 6 to 8 months. These are not common on the coast but there are 8 between Chahbar and Gwatar. * See in particular Routes in Persia, Vol. IV, Nos. 41, 43, 45, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 A, 133 and 136892 MAK-MAK Pack-carriage is obtainable to a limited extent throughout the country, and abundance of camel transport can be obtained at Chahbar and Jashk on short notice. Maritime transport consists of a number of boats owned at places upon the coast. Gwatar has 4 Safri Bojis of 75 tons ; and Chahbar boasts 12 vessels of 20 to 100 tons burden manned by crews of 8 to 20 men which run to Karachi and Bombay as well as to Arabian ports. New Jashk possesses 4 and Tank 6 boats of about 12 tons with crews of 5 to 7 men trading to the coast of Arabia only ; and at Galag there are 5 boats of 20 tons each. The total shipping of the coast is thus only about 40 boats of 18 tons and over : there are few boats at smaller places which are not included in the above estimate. Persian Makran, except the district of Jashk is administered by a Persian Administration Governor or Hakim, who has his seat at Bampur and is subject to the authority of the Persian Governor-General of Kirman. Persian Makran is divided into the five districts of Jashk, Geh, Qas’ qand, Dashtiari and Bahu; of these, the first is described under its own name and the remainder receive short notices below. Each of the districts except Jashk is ruled by a chief who pays annual tribute to the Persian Governor at Bampur, but in regard to the internal adminis tration of his district is exempt from the interference of the Persian ex ecutive. In fact, with the exception of Customs employes on the coast, and a Baluchi Vali representing the Governor of Bampur at Chahbar no Persian officials are to be found in Persian Makran, and similarly there are no Persian garrisons ; when however the annual tribute is refused or falls into arrears, the Persian Government is accustomed to make an incursion into the country with regular troops and wheeled artillery, and to de vastate the refractory districts by way of punishment. Persian Customs officials are stationed only at Jashk, Chahbar and Gwatar, and foreign trade at other places on the coast is forbidden, but the prohibition has not yet been successfully enforced. The Chiefs are assisted in the administration of juctice by the religious authorities or Mullas of the country and delegate their executive authority to headmen of sub-districts, who in some cases are hereditary but are more commonly appointed by the chiefs: these headmen have almost plenary powers within the limits of their jurisdiction, and are responsible for the collection of the taxes. The ordinary taxes are ith of actual gross produce on cultivated land, a grazing due of | to 2 krdns per animal for the year on livestock except sheep and goats, 1 to 2 per cent, in kind of sheep and goats kept, and 10 per cent, in kind of fish brought to market. There are no recognised laws, and order—so far as it exists—is enforced by primitive, summary methods; formal protection of life and property is almost altogether wanting, and its place is only partially supplied by the blood-feud system, which renders aggression upon natives of the country dangerous to the committer. Arms are frequently used in tribal disputes, but serious disturbances are rare. The British Government pays subsidies to various local chiefs for the protection of the land-line of telegraph between Gwadar and Jashk, andMAK—MAK 393 the inhabitants are in general well disposed towards the telegraph staff and other British officials. The Geh district has a population of about 48,000 souls. The capital x&gt; x- i ™ is deb. which is situated 72 miles north-north- except JSshk. 10 w r est of Chahhar ; population about 2,500 souls ; the second place of importance is Bint with 2,000 inhabitants, 42 miles west by north of Geh. The tribes of the district will be found in the table of tribes already given. The fighting men of the district—armed with modern rifles—are estimated at 4,000, and the second levy with inferior fire-arms at 10,000. The Chief of Geh, at present Saiyid Khan Shairkhanzai, maintains a body-guard of 50 mounted men, armed with swords and Martini carbines. The Geh district is reported to contain large patches of cultivation, and the water is said to be generally good: it is estimated that supplies and forage to maintain a force of 1,500 men would be forthcoming all the year round. The passage of wheeled artillery in this district, if possible, would be difficult. The chief village of the Qasrqand district is similarly named Qasrqand : its population is about 1,500 souls and it is situated on the Kajii affluent of the Chil river 68 miles north by east of Chahbar and 1,775 feet above sea-level. The population of the district is about 12,000 souls, and the tribes are the same as in the Geh district. The first levy of this district comprises about 300 men, and the second 1,500. The Qasr qand Chief, like the Chief of Geh, is a Gichki : the present Chief is J an Muhammad It is calculated that the resources of the Qasrqand district might support a force of 1,000 men. The country is unsuited for field artillery. The Dashtiari district has a population of about 18,000 souls, the tribes will be found in the tribal table above. The principal village is Miri Bazar, with 1,500 inhabitants, situated 35 miles north-north west of Gwatar. The well-armed fighting men of Dashtiari are said to number 1,000, and the less well armed 2,500. In the coastal part of the district it would be difficult at any time to maintain a force of 100 men, and after heavy rain the country is generally flooded and may remain impsssable for animals during a fortnight. The present joint chiefs of Dashtiari, the brothers ’Abdl and Mahmud, are Jadgals, and are related to the Chief of Bahu. They each receive a telegraph subsidy of Rs. 500 a year from the Indo-European Telegraph Department. The Bahu district has a population of about 14,000 souls : its capital is Bahu Kalat, with 1,000 inhabitants, situated 38 miles north of Gwatar. The tribal table already given shows the tribes to which the people of the districts belong. About 500 of the fighting men are said to be srmed with modern rifles, and 2,500 with indifferent weapons. Near the coast there are the same obstacles to the maintenance and movement of troops as in Dashtiari. The Chief of Bahu, Mir Ashraf, is a Jadgal; he belongs to Ihe same family as the Chiefs of Dashtiari. He receives Rs. 600 per annum as a telegraph subsidy, and one of Rs. 400 is also paid to his cousin Mir Ahmad. 61 I.

Ross says it is in the low hills north of Sadaich. Its exact location is a point of some little interest, as native tradition asserts it to have been erected by an independent prince, or malik, of Makran, to mark the limit of his territory. It is also said that Nasir Khan I of Kalat extended his sway as far as this point. HajI ’Abdul Nabi mentions another boundary mark of the same name near Qasrqand. MALIK SIAH, KtJH-I— Elev. 3,12s'. A halting-place on the borders of Sarhad and Sistan, between the stages of Duzdab and Hurmuk on the Ladis-Nasratabad road, distant 28£ miles from the former and 5 miles from the latter. It has a small spring of sweet water. There is a Customs Frontier Post at Kuh-i-Malik Siah under Sistan. It is the residence of a British Indian vice-consul (under the 2N2404 MAL—MAN consul of STstan) There are a few houses. A small amount of supplies pro curable ; no cultivation. The temperature here on January 3rd, 1899, was 27° F at 8 a.m., and 45° F. at 6 p.m. Close to the halting-place is a low black hill, which marks the spot where the boundaries of the Indian and Persian Empires meet those of Afghan istan. It was selected by Sir Frederick Goldsmid, who noted that it was the first hill met with to the south-west in a suitable position for terminating the Sistan boundary, which was accordingly delimitated m a direct Ime from the Sistan dam to this point, but no bound^y pillars were erected. It was not until 1896 that the Perso-Baluch and Baluch-Afghan frontier were demarcated, and shortly after this the latitude and longtitude of this -the north-west boundary pillar of the India ^m|ure-were£na ly fixed by Mr. G.

Long. 57° 28' 0'. Elev. 1 ; 000'. A village and fort in the Eudbar distiict of Kirman, 1221 miles from Bandar Abbas, on the road to Rigan The fort, owing to its position on the borders of Bashakard, must have'stood numerous sieges. Its capture and the torture of its garrison by mahk Dinar at the end of the twelfth century A.D. are mentioned by Muhammad Ibrahim in his history. Some two centuries later it was besieged by Afghan and German mercenaries. Jennings, who visited it in 1885, thus describes it .— “ The Maim] an fort is situated on the end of a spur, or promontory, running from south to north, nearly from the main range. The spur is composed of variegated shale with nearly perpendicular strata, and is seme 30 to 50 feet above the plain. The foundations throughout are of boulders, set in excellent mortar, the entire superstructure being of good burnt bricks set in mud. “ One turret stands about 60 feet above the foundations, i e., 90 to 100 feet above the plain; another is 40 feet in height (above its foundation) and is 50 feet in diameter at the top. The walls are several feet in thickness. Regarded from a military point of view, tlm site of the fort is badly selected, as it can be easily con.manded from neighbouring hills To the west the remains of a city wall exist, the circumference of the whole being from J to 1 mile. Within this space are the remains of several wells and kdhns. This w^as evidently once a place of considerable importance, as outside the walls are still to be seen the remains of numerous houses but all are now (May 1885) in ruins; and even the fort, which is in fairly good repair, is uninhabited, the people preferring to live in ghiddns or temporary hovels in the neighbourhood.” . Decay has, however, evidently proceeded rapidly, for Napier, who visited Mann] an in 1899, states that the fort was much dilapidated since Jennings’ time, while Grey, in 1905, found it in a very ruinous condition. There appears to be no proper village of Manujan. According to Grey there is, close to the fort, a group of 10 or 12 huts, with a ziarat, 3 good wells and a date grove, called Bullulabad, but this is probably only one of the numerous groups of houses which both Jennings and Napier say dot the country all round in the vicinity of the fort. The population is esti mated at 1,800, including 1,000 youths, and there are 2,000 jezails for their use. Ten thousand sheep and goats, 2,000 cattle, 40 camels, and 3,000 mans of seed are sown yearly. The date groves consist of about 6,000 palms. The land in the district is said to be the richest in southern Persia and is well irri gated by kdrlzes and cuts from the Manujan river. Large quantities of wool and grain are exported to Bandar Abbas, the rate of hire being 2 tumdns per camel-load of wool. Labourers receive 1 hdn 'per diem. There is considerable caravan traffic through Manujan in the cold weather, and it is estimated that nine caravans, each composed of^ not less than 500 camels, pass through from Kandahar or Herat every winter. The inhabitants of the Manujan plain call themselves Baluchis, and the district, as well as the adjoining one of Bashakard, is under the Governor of Rudbar. The Katkhvdd (1902) is Meshedi Husain. Some supplies are procurable, and camel-grazing and fuel are very plentiful.406 MAN—MAQ Gibbon who visited the place in 1908 says that the whole plain is* kown as Manujan, and through it runs a river from which excellent water is_ obtainable. He mentions a very ancient fort known as the Kaleh-i-Manu jan, in the immediate neighbourhood of which are several wells about 20 feet deep The ground is rich, but the number of inhabitants is not very great. The population and cultivation however seem to have increased in a marked degree during the previous 7 or 8 years. The place is an excel lent one for breeding cattle. The inhabitants live in huts made of palm leaves in number about 200 scattered all over the plain. They own 30 buffaloes, 200 cattle and 5,000 goats and sheep. In Gibbon’s opinion this would be a good centre for troops in case of military preparations. There are good roads in all directions which are for the greater part suitable for wheels even in their present condition. {Jennings 1885 : Navier 1899 : Grey 1905 ; Slier Jang 1902Gibbon 1908.) * MANUJAN (River) or RUDKHANEH-I-SAGHIN or RtDKHANEH-I- RUDKAN or RtJDKHANEH-I-MlNAB— A river which_ rises m Kirman province, north-east of Manuian, and flowing past Jaghin, Birinti and Minab, empties itself into the straits of Hormuz at a point about 40 miles east-south-east of Bandar Abbas. The Bandar Abbas-Rigan road follows its course from Minab to Manuian and crosses it frequently. It is the classical Anamis, where Nearchos, landing at Harmozia, marched inland to meet Alexander the Great, in the valley of Halil Rud. At Jaghin the stream in October is only about 25 yards wide, but a couple of miles lower down it sometimes spreads out in the winter season to a breadth of 1 mile, when caravans have to halt for three or four days until the water subsides. Two and a half miles above Birinti its width m the month of October is about 45 yards with a depth of 0 to 18 inches. About 3 miles below that village it is joined by the Duzdi stream from the north, and at Bagh, a short distance above Minab, their combined waters widen out to 150 yards (in October) with a depth of from 6 inches to 2 feet.—(Napier, 1899.)

It is said to join the Dahart river lower down .—{Medley and Massy, July 1893.) MARE!— A place in the Maskhutan district of Persian Baluchistan. It _ is 11 miles from Maskhutan on the Bampur road and 15 from Baluchan Chah. Floyer (1876) describes it as a miserably desolate-looking place. “ About two hundred date trees, mostly dead or dying, leaned in all directions over a barren tract covered thickly with a white efilorescence, having the taste of stale soda-water. Many low mounds were scattered about, from the centres of which trickled small black streams of very clear bitter water. The owners of these trees only visited them in the fruit season, and we could neither get information nor form conjecture as to the cause of their wretched condition. The bitter springs did not appear to have broken out recently. Fresh Water is obtained here by scraping a hole in the wet black sand. The water that filters through into it is drinkable for about two days, and here we filled water-skins for the desert march. “ Another date grove, called Dariabad (q-v.), is visible about 4 miles to the west.” Goldsmid in 1866 passed at 16 miles from Baluchan Chah, date trees and a pool of water in high grass. The spot may have been eithe Main or Dariabad. The heavy sand commences at about 4 miles beyond Marri at two low sandstone hills, called Dubum and Kahnuk.

MASHKlL or MASHKlD— A river in Persian Baluchistan. Rising in the hills between Bampiir and Magas, the Sar-i-Pahura (4,800 feet) being the watershed between the two river systems, it flows in an easterly direction towards Kuhak, receiv ing the northern drainage of the Bampusht range, and the southern drain age of the Kuh-i-Siahan and other mountain chains to the west. Its prin cipal tributaries are the Rohtak, after its junction with the Simish, about 20 miles south-east of Dizak, and the Rakhshan, about 10 miles east of Kuhak. Numerous ndlds and streamlets join it on its course, but none of them are of much importance. After leaving Kuhak and passing into British territory, it takes a norther ly turn and flowing between the Kuh-i-Siahan and the Kuh-i-Sabz, through the Gravag and Zorati defiles, it spreads out into the MashkIl Hdmun, where all its waters are lost by evaporation. Its total length is about 200 miles. The bed of the river is large, but water runs in it by only a few channels, and it is generally fordable—except when in spate—throughout its course as far as Kuhak, though in the vicinity of this place its high banks point to its having been once of greater size than it is at present. The chief villages along its course are, Isfandak and Kuhak, all in Persian territory ; while fair kdfUeh routes follow its banks connecting the above named places, and branching off at Isfandak over the Bunsir pass (y.?;. to Jalk, and at Kalpurkan to Dizak, to Talk over the Brinjinan pass, for details of which vide the Route Book, Vol. I, Routes 3, 5 and 6.— (Holdich, 1901 \ Sykes 1902.) MABITlBAD or MAZlDABAD— Elev. 1,205'. A village in Kirman, 76£ miles south-west of Rigan, on the caravan track from there to Minab. The village, which lies about 1 mile to the east of the road, consists of a dilapidated and deserted mud fort, half a dozen palm-leaf huts, and a date grove, while two more date groves lie 3 miles to the north-west. This and the neighbouring hamlet of Deh-i-Gau are inhabited by Baluchis, who pay revenue to the Governor of Rudbar. They cultivate a little barley and cotton, which is irrigated from two qandts, the water of which is good. Grazing and firewood are procurable but no supplies.— (Napier, 1899 ; Newcomen, 1905 ; Grey, 1905.) MASKHARA— A village in Rudbar (q.v.) in Kirman. MASKHtTAN— Elev. about 1,500'. A village and small district of Persian Baluchistan to the south-west of Bampur, of which it is a sub-division. The size of the district is unknown, but it is poorly inhabited and un important. It adjoins, and is almost a part of, the sandy desert country 61 I. B. 2 0410 MAS—MAS which occupies the whole south of Bampur {q.v.). A large portion of it consists of gravelly and sandy plains thickly sprinkled with bushes and a few small trees. Bampur itself is 62 miles from Maskhutan village. The distance is done in six stages, but it is difficult marching over sandhills, and water is pre carious. Fanuch is 25 miles to the south , the hills being entered at 14 miles. To the east of Maskhutan is Lashar {q.v.) ; and Pip, an important place in that district, is not more than a couple of stages distant. It lies at the junction of. several tracks, those from Fanuch to Bampur and Bampur to Ramishk being the principal ones. The village contains about 500 inhabitants, and is situated on a steep low hill near the western end of a stretch of date groves, nearly 7 miles long, fringing the southern bank of a broad watercourse. In addition to the usual Baluch huts there is a fort, now much dilapidated. Goldsmid saw in 1866 the remains of a second fort, which had been destroyed by Ibrahim Khan, the Governor of Bampur. He was informed that the people of the two forts, which are close together, were formerly at enmity and used to assail each other with stones. But since the Persians have been in possession of the country it is probable that a good many of these local feuds have died out. The village is very dirty. Whereas Fanuch and Bint resemble English cowyards, the manure in Maskhutan has so much the upper hand of the grass roots and straw, that the place resembles a pig sty. As a natural consequence it is unhealthy. The people ha\e a sickly look, and smallpox and cholera occasionally make great ravages. The climate is very hot in summer, probably resembling that of Bampur {q.v.), but sometimes equally cold in winter. Floyer on the 31st December 1876 was overtaken by a violent snow-storm, 5 miles south of Maskhutan, and had great difficulty in getting his men through to Fanuch. Yet the elevation cannot be more than 1,500 feet above sea-level. The people appear to be of three classes : sallow Persians, wild-looking Lasharis (Hots), and a third class of square-faced beardless men in Persian dress. But the dress here is no certain proof of the origin of the wearer. The Baluch of Makran would scorn to wear any but a Baluch dress and would particularly object to a Persian costume. Here, however, the Persian is more feared and the Baluch more ignorant, and they wear these dresses with a feeling modified, but akin to that with which the African savage attires himself in a red coat and trousers. The knife worn here is called a leach (abbreviation of kali chin, grass-cutter). A thick piece of wood, split down to within an inch of one end, is the handle. The blade is 18 inches long, pivoted in the centre, having one-half sharp, and the other half made into a saw, so that it can be used either for cutting grass ! or wood. The sheath is generally of matting. The grass roots and firewood and all burdens are carried on cows when they can be afforded, otherwise on men’s backs. Even little children carry extraordinary loads of fire wood. The watercourse, here 500 yards wide with a sandy bed, comes from the north and turns south-east at Maskhutan. In the cold season it has a small stream, 20 yards across and 1 foot deep. From this, channels an led off to irrigate the date groves and cultivation. The soil is good,but there is not much of it. On the right bank the date groves are backed by low jagged hills ; on the opposite side are also low rocky hills between which the sand is changed to a light soil bearing thin grass and a few babul trees. Here would be the camping-ground. Water from the river is somewhat brackish, but drinkable. Dates are abundant, but other supplies doubtful, and forage scarce. The Maskhutan river joins the Isfakeh stream and flows into the Bam- pur river, via the Talasht ndla, and eventually loses itself in the Jaz Murian Hdmun. It does not run into the Kair river, as was formerly surmised.. Maskhutan is called Maskotu by Goldsmid, the first traveller who visited it. Floyer, however, who could speak Baluchi, Persian and Arabic, and is therefore a good authority, seems to have no do*ubt about the name. He was informed the derivation was Maskan Hutdn, the residence of the Huts, or H5ts ; from Maskan (Arabic) “a residence.” Since 1876, this place has not been visited by any European, but the surrounding country has been mapped, and the direction of the flow of the river definitely settled. The mdlidt of the district in 1902 was 800 tumdns. — {Goldsmid, 1866 ; Floyer, 1876] Brazier-Creagh, 1891] Sykes, 1902.) MASKUN—Lat. 28° 57'0'. Long. 57° 47' 17''. Elev. 7,000'. A caravanserai and small village in Kirman, in the Aspi Darreh valley {q.v.) surrounded by considerable cultivation, situated 36 miles from Bam on the Kahnu-Bandar Abbas road, and 9| miles from Sagdar on the Bijnabad- Kirman road. In the vicinity are ample camping-grounds, with abundance of water and fuel, but any large quantity of supplies would have to be arranged for beforehand. About 3| miles south is Ibbad-i-Maskun (q.v.), stated to be a hot spring emitting carbonic acid gas. Maskun is one of the three' divisions of the Jabal Bariz.— (Sykes, 1894] Brazier-Creagh, 1894.)

St. John remarks : “ The Bampusht hills continue their bold scarp under the name of the Kfth-i-Mazampusht in the same even west to east direction until they end in a loftier and 2 0 2412 MAZ—MAZ bolder peak called Sagarkand, etc.,” and there is evidently no difference, except in name, between these portions of the range.— {See algo Bampusht Kuh.) The villages of Kolan {q.v.) and Patkuk are shown in the map among the hills at the foot of the Mazampusht Kuh on the northern side. “ In the Mazampusht hills the water-parting between the oceanic and central basins turns abruptly south over the Sar-i-Sham plateau, after which it resumes its eastward direction.”— {St. John.) MAZAR— A line of stones in Kirman, 10 miles east-south-east of Rigan, on the road to Bazman. * Rectangular in form, it covers about an acre, and is said to be the spot where the Prophet ’Ali deviated from the road.

MAZAR-I-HUSAIN KHlN— A monument close to the eastern side of the town of Kirman.— {Khani- Jcoff.) MAZAVl (River)— A river in the west of Bashakard, which is crossed by the Minab-Bint road, 39 miles south-east of Minab. Where crossed by the road the channel is about 100 yards wide, and, though not deep, is full of large rocks and boulders, and plentifully strewn with drift wood. It contains a fair volume of water, which, though thick and white in colour, owing to the large amount of gypsum which the soil contains, is nevertheless sweet and good to drink. Most other streams I in this part of the country possess the same characteristic.— {Galindo, November 1888.) MAZIDABAD— See Masitabad— MAZIGH— A village in the Minab district {q.v.).

It nestles among some low hillocks on the right bank of a dry water course ; the water-supply is from a spring, 200 or 300 yards off, on the left bank. About 1^- miles to the south-east rises the great Kuh-i-Meha, an enormous mass of rock with precipitous sides and a nearly flat top, very similar in appearance to the Guh Kuh (q.v.). — {Galindo, December 1888.)

It is said to be naturally so strong that it has never been captured, and that it boasts an inscription giving the names ot the Generals who attacked it, probably under Shah ’Abbas and Nadir Shah, about 1736. It has not been visited by any European.— 1902.)414 MIH—MIL i MiHl AMBlR— A mountain in southern Khorasan, to the south-west of the road through the desert of Lut from BIrjand to Kirman.

It appears to be the end of a spur from the coast range. r 2 977' MlL-I-FARHAD— Lat. 28° 8' 2'/ Long. 58° 51' 18'. Elev. [ 3)7 ^_^ Grey ^ A halting-place in Kirman, on the road from Rigan to Minab, 50 miles from the former place. The name means the ‘ pillar ’ of Farhad, and the place is so called from an immense cone-shaped obelisk of solid white rock, sotne 900 or 1,000 feet high, which forms a conspicuous landmark in the surrounding country. At the foot of it is a zldrat, occupied by faqlrs who levy alms from passing travellers. No supplies of any sort are procurable. Fuel is scanty, and the water from the stream (which is not perennial) is salt, but sweet water can be got from a spring £ mile to the east of the rock. There is some grazing, and a curious red flower is found which has receptacles between each leaf full of a bright red dye, which is said to fetch a good price in Kirman and Karachi. The Baluch name for it is 'pilgusht, and Jennings considers it a sort of dragon-wort. At Mil-i-Farhad three roads take off, one going east to Baluchistan, the other two being alternative routes to Bandar Abbas— one via Jiruft and Rudkhaneh-i-Duzdi, the other and main route running more to the south, through Minab.— (Jennings, 1885 ; Neivcom n, 1905.) MIL-I-NADIRl— A tower or pillar in Kirman, 18 miles north-east of Fehraj, on the road from Bam to Sistan. Built of burnt bricks and still in fairly good pre servation, it is said to have been erected by Nadir’s orders to guide travel lers across the desert. Its dimensions, as given by Sir F. Goldsmid, are ‘ ‘ height, 55 feet; base circumference 43 feet, slightly tapering to the top; thickness of wall, 3£ feet; bricks 14 by 12 by 2 inches ” ; with 49 steps up a spiral staircase. There is a second Mil-i-Nadiri—in ruins—between the halting-places of . Shurgaz and Gurg on the same route, 10£ miles north-east of the former place.— King Wood, 1899 ; Dobbs, 1902.)MIM-MIN 415 MIMGAST (Nala)— A gravelly nala in RUdbar, whicli is crossed by the road from Kahn-i- ’Ali to Kuhtak, 12| miles from the former place .—{Medley and Massy, July 1893.) MINAB or MlNAO (Khur or Kaur)— A salt-water creek in the Minab district providing a partial and imperfect approach from the sea to the district capital of Minab: its mouth is situated about 33 miles east by south of Bandar ’Abbas and 19 miles west by south of Minab town. The bar of the creek is nearly dry at low water. The Khur runs inland at first in a north-easterly direc tion for I-*- miles through sand and mud flats, then for 2 miles south-east wards between banks overgrown with mangroves, and finally for 4 miles to the east-north-east to its head, where is situated Tiab, described else where among the villages of the Minab district, the landing-place for Minab town and an Imperial Persian Customs station. A mud flat continues 2 miles beyond Tiab in the direction of Minab town, between which and the landing stage, goods are transported on camels and donkeys. At certain seasons there is a considerable trade, as many as 20 boats arriving and leaving on the same day ; these are mostly from Qishm and Bandar Abbas, but a few are from the coast of Arabia and even from India. The Minab creek makes an indifferent harbour : the bar as already mentioned is shallow, while the inner channel, which at its head degenerates into a mere ditch, cannot be used by native boats exceeding 20 tons’ burden, and at low water is impracticable even for these. During a shimdl vessels can neither enter nor leave Khur Minab and accidents in attempting to do so are not uncommon.— {Lmmer, 1906.) MINAB or MINAU (District)— A comparatively rich and important but not a very extensive district, the first of those on the Persian side within the entrance of the Persian Gulf; it is situated between the Persian littoral district of Shamil on the north and that of Biaban on the south. The Minab district is bounded on the west by the sea ; on the north by Limits a line running from the mouth of the Shar il river to the Zindan hills so as to pass im mediately north of the village of Mian Shahr ; on the east by the crest of the Zindan hills till the village of Garuk is almost reached. At this point the boundary turns to the south-west and passing between the villages of Taling and Garuk leaves the village of Guvasmand in Biaban and then runs westward by southward to the sea between Ziarat in Minab and Bundram in Biaban. With these limits the district has a length of about 45 miles and a depth inland at about 25. The Minab district is a plain reaching from the foot of the hills on the Physical characteristics and east to the sea. The coast generally is low and climate. swampy, with a number of creeks too small to admit native craft of more than medium size and containing as a rule only salt-water ; of these the principal is Khur Minab, which is elsewhere described under its own name. Near the coast the country is everywhere a saline416 MIN—MIN swamp bearing only coarse grass and tamarisk busbes or, in the immediate neighbourhood of the sea, mangroves. The north-western corner of the district inland from the coast is a sandy desert so strongly impregnated with salt that nothing can grow in it. The remainder of the district is fertile and well cultivated by dint of irrigation from the Minab river and other smaller streams from the hills. The Minab river has at Minab town a bed-width of 400 to 600 yards and usually carries a fair volume of water. In March the stream flows about 1 foot deep and 200 yards wide; in summer it is drained almost dry by various irrigation canals, while in winter it runs at a higher level and sometimes becomes difficult of passage. Little water at ordinary times reaches the sea through the mouth of the river which is on the coast about 7 miles south-east of the entrance of Khur Minab. The principal canals depending on the Minab river are one which takes off from the right bank at Basreh and waters several villages to the west and another which leaves the left bank and runs through Minab town to some of the southern vil lages. The water of the river is good and drinkable. The only other streams in the district deserving of notice are the Mazavi, with a broad but shallow flow, which crosses the district to the sea several miles south of the Minab river, and the Chahlak stream which disembogues 1 mile to the south of Kuhistak. The hills forming the eastern boundary of the district and called Kuh-i- Zindan—or in the north where they adjoin the Rudb5r district Kuh-i- Rudbar—are rugged of outline and barren of vegetation, except for a few her trees. By natives Minab is considered to be much healthier than Bandar Abbas, and shade and flowing water combine to render it at least cooler. In summer many Bandar Abbasis migrate to Minab town to escape the terrible heat of their own. But mosquitoes abound, and even early in March are sometimes so numerous as to make life a burden. Rain is said to fall more copiously in Mlnib than on any other part of the Persian coast within 150 miles on either side of it. A majority of the inhabitants of the Minab district are Persians of mixed p descent, a Baluch strain predominating among opu a ion. the foreign elements in their composition ; the rest are for the most part genuine Baluchis or Arabs who are believed to have immigrated from Bahrain. Their total number, inclusive of the permanent inhabitants of Minab town, may be placed at 26,000 souls. The most part are SLI’ahs, Sunnis being found only among the Baluchis and the Arab immi grants. The topographical table at the end of this article will make plain in detail the distribution of the population and their means of livelihood. In the interior' all are date-growers, stock-raisers or ordinary agriculturists ; on the coast there are some fishermen and sailors. The people on the whole are fairly well-to-do, most of them inhabit mud-brick houses, only the poorest labourers occupying the date-leaf huts which in some adjoining districts are the commonest form of dwelling. The character of the people is less degraded than in the neighbourhood of Bandar Abbas—a circum stance which is attributed to the less direct and oppressive form which the Persian Government here assumes; as agriculturists they are reputedthrift}' and careful. The language of the district is a local patois com pounded of Persian, Arabic and Baluchi, Persian words predominating. But few arms are carried or owned in Minab, though the district was ‘until lately upon a highroad of the rifle-trade with Afghanistan and Baluchistan. The staple industry is the cultivation of dates, but wheat and barley, i. Agriculture and Trade. besides henna, vegetables and fruits such as . . citrons, limes, lemons, oranges, mangoes and plantains, are grown in considerable quantities. The chief facts about trade are gi/en in the article on Minab town, which is the only trade-centre in the aistrict; here it may be added that an illicit trade with Afghanistan and Baluchistan in imported rifles which formerly flourished here has now been all but suppressed by the reformed Customs administration. Communication and trans- The principal routes in the district are four, P orti - as follows :— (1) A portion of the coast-route between Minab and Bandar Abbas ! this is the continuation of Route No. 1 of the paragraph on com munications in the article on the Shamil district, and no further remarks are necessary here, except that the two stages within the Minab distiict are Dudau at 14 miles from Minab town and 16 from Q ulughan in the Shamil district. (2) A small portion of the route between Minab town and Shamil village lies in the Minab district; vide Route No. 4 in the paragraph and article already cited. It will be seen, on refer ence to Route No. 5 in the same place, that travellers proceed ing from Minab town to Bam or Kirman might go by Shamil village, joining the Bandar Abbas-Kirman route at Tang-i- Zindan. (3) There is a route over the hills from Minab town by the Gardaneh Asiai and Murad Kushteh passes to Manujan, whence, as ex plained under Route No. 4 in the passage cited above, ways lie to Sistan and Khorasan. (4) The route to Jashk runs from Minab town to Kalavi (26 miles) by Kokogaz, Hazarmani, Kahatak Majbun and Dahi Qand ; there is also a route a few miles shorter by Hazarmani, Ju Mahalleh and Dahi Qand. The continuation beyond Kalavi is given in the paragraph on communi cations in the article on the Biaban district. The above routes are no better than those of South-Eastern Persia gen erally ; but in dry weather they are free from difficulty for mounted men and pack animals at least until they enter the hilly country. A rough estimate of the land transport owned in the Minab district shows about 1,000 camels, and 1,000 donkeys. As wall appear from the village-list at the end of this article, the number of boats belonging to the coast villages is inconsiderable. The district is ruled by an official who has his seat at Minab town Administration. j? 6 .. a ^' P resen t a nominee of the Mu’in-ut- , , T’Mjar of Tehran wdio holds the district in farm from the Persian Central Government. Minab, however, is subject in some 61 I. B418 MIN—MIN respects to the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and his subordinate, the Deputy Governor of B ndar Abbas, is supposed to exercise a certain degree of authority over the official in charge of Minab ; no signs of control, how ever, are apparent. The local Sub-Governor dispenses a rude form of criminal and civil justice, and is responsible for the collection annually of 14,000 tumdns as land-revenue. Except this mdliat or land-revenue no taxes are collected in the district, which in this respect is more fortunate than Shamil or Bandar Abbas. The Agent’s behests are enforced by means of a small corps of about 30 TufangcMs, and about 20 rifles of regular Persian Infantry are stationed in the district to support the authority ol the Imperial Persian Customs. The operations of the Imperial Customs establishment in the district are supervised by a Persian Mudir stationed at Minab town ; he has under his orders a post at Tiab and another at Kuhistak.

MINAB or MINAU (Town)— Lat. 27° 9' 17'. Long. 57° 3' 0'. Elev. 378/ The capital of the Minab district, and the only populous -or important place near the Persian Coast anywhere east of Bandar Abbas; it issituated about 28 miles south-south-east of Shamil village and nearly 50 miles due east of Bandar Abbas, at a distance of about 15 miles in a direct line from the nearest point on the sea. Minab stands on the left bank of the Minab river'and is immediately commanded on the east side by some hills which rise to 640 feet and carry a large but very dilapidated fort overlooking the town ; the whole hill side is covered with remains of towers, bastions and walls. The greater part of the town consists of mat huts, but at the foot of the hill on which the fort stands is a quarter, about 5 acres in extent, with many good and substantial houses ; this quarter was originally enclosed, but the wall which surrounded it has now almost entirely disappeared, only the towers and bastions which belonged to it remaining in situ. On the south side are extensive plantations and gardens and here begins an enormous date- belt, about 6 miles in breadth, which follows the course of the Minab river to within a few miles of the sea. There are in all not less than 2,000 houses in Mmab town, and the popula tion may be estimated at 10,000 souls in summe^ when the place is partly occupied by immigrants from Bandar Abbas, Hormuz and the adjoining rural districts : the minimum winter population possibly does not exceed 7,000. The inhabitants .fire described as civil and obliging : the majority of them Persians of no particular tribe and are Shi ahs, a considerable propor tion of them being natives of the Rudbar district upon the upper course of the Minab river. Large numbers of Arabs and Negroes also are among the inhabitants and there are at present 14 Hindus and 17 Khojahs also, who are British subjects. Almost the entire population is dependent on date and fruit culture, but a few are engaged in the manufacture of lungis or coloured check cloth, and others live by trade. Dates, tobacco, henna, oranges, citrons, lemons, plantains and mangoes are grown, and the town can furnish about 200 donkeys, 300 camels and 400 cattle’. The bazar is large and better supplied than that of Bandar Abbas, and carpenters and blacksmiths are here obtainable. Exports consist chiefly of dates, corn, vegetable, fruits, henna, wool, ghi and hides, while imports include piece-goods, rice, sugar, tea, kerosine oil and dried fish : a portion of the trade really belongs to the Rudbar district in the interior which produces the greater part of the wool, grfo’and hides exported. The town is the only trade-centre of the Minab district, its currency, weights and measures are indentical with those of Bandar Abbas. About 100 Indian maunds of wheat might be obtained, and 20,000 Indian maunds of dates, but flour is scarce. Supplies of all kinds are procur able at Minab. Water which is from the Minab river and canals dependent on it, is good and abundant. There are a few wells. The Deputy-Governor of the Minab district has his residence here, and there is an inspector of the Imperial Customs; the authority of both is sup ported by the presence of a small detachment of 20 Persian infantry. There are shrines of Hazrat ’Abbas, Zain-ul-Abidin, and Shah Wali. The elements of a Muhammadan education are imparted in tw T o or three mosques : these are the only tuitional establishments.—(Lon'mer, 19C6.)

It is situated between the junction of the Bahu and Kaju rivers, which both spread out into numerous channels, and render the surrounding country liable to inundation.The populationof the villi age consists of some 30 families of Jadgals, who speak Baluchi as ■well as Sindhi; hut in the district from hlsad to Ehan, north of Churak, there are said to be 300 Jadgals and 1,200 Baluchis. Supplies are procurable in fair quantities, both from Indian traders and the villagers, while fuel and forage are plentiful. Buring the rainy season water is taken from dbambdrs or surface reservoirs, and is probably impure, but in summer a limited amount is available from wells. Camels can be hired at annas 12 to Be. 1 per diem. The climate in the summer is hot^and dusty, the temperature at noon in April 1900 ranging from 94° to 110°. There are several villages in the neighbourhood, from which a few T sup plies and good water are procurable, the principal ones being Eachu, ISur Muhammad, Hutag, Umar Hutag in the direction of Chuioak— (Janes, 1900.) MlBJAWA— Elev. 2,800'. A small area of arable soil in Sarhad, 11 miles north-east of Ladis and about 70 miles south-south-east of Kuh-i-Malik Siah. Of recent years considerable attention has been drawn to this spot, as being a place of great geographical and strategical importance along a dis puted frontier ; and as it is possible that it may yet again come into promi nence, the events with regard to it will be here related in some detail. In 1895 a convention was signed by the Indian and Persian Governn enfs regarding the alignment of the Perso-Baluch frontier, from Kfihak to Kuh- i-Malik Siah—the mountain where the Persian, Indian and Afghan frontiers meet. To give effect to this agreement a British Commission under Colonel (now Sir Thomas) Holdich assembled at Kuhak in February 1896, and, in conjunction with the Persian Commissioners, commenced to delimitate the frontier which had already been decided on at Tehran. The Commission proceeded as far as Jalk, erecting boundary pillars along the Siahan range as they went, but north of Jalk they were unable to go, owing to pressure of time, and the rapid approach of the hot weather. A native surveyor, however, was directed to continue by double marches as far as Kuh-i-Malik Siah, and to erect pillars along the proposed boundary, on spots which had been roughly indicated on the then existing maps, but which w T ere not strictly in accordance with the terms of the Tehran Treaty—being placed considerably more to the east than had been contemplated by the Indian and Persian Govern ments. The maps also were inaccurate, and did not represent the true features of the country. It thus happened that in reality four boundaries were in existence, viz., that in the agreement; that on a composite map, put together to reconcile discrepancies ; that on the sketch map signed by the Commissioners ; and that on the ground ; while it was not possible to reconcile the agreement with the features as they really existed. The boundary actually demarcated by Colonel Holdich, ran from Kuhak along the Siahan Kuh, thence to the east of Jalk and northwards up to Pillar No. 11, as marked on the map. From there it followed the course of the so-called Talab river, to a point where the Mlrjawa river432 MIR—MIR was supposed to join the Talab, and thence branched off along the crest of the Kacha Kuh to the Kuh-i-Malik Siah. Such a point of junction however, between the two rivers does not exist ; with the result that there arose in the neighbourhood of Mirjawa a small area of country, the ownership of which was in dispute. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the fact that the Boundary Com missioners were mistaken in supposing that the true Talab river flowed past Mirjawa, and that the so-called Mirjawa river ran in a clear well-defined course into the Talab. In reality it is the Dar-i-Ghlaban which runs past Mirjawa, and it does not receive the name of Talab until it passes the Kuh-i-Rlhl, and reaches the junction of the Rlhl nala, 28 miles below Kaleh Safid, or according to other authorities, the Talab spring, 41 miles below Kaleh Safid. At the first named place water oozes up for the first time in the bed of the river, and forms pools {Talab) from which its nomenclature is derived. The Dar-i-Ghlaban river, where it passes the Mirjawa cultivation, is an insignificant dry sandy Yiala bed, only 20 yards wide and about 2 feet deep. ... The Ladls river on'issuing from the hills, spreads out into a wide fen sloping to the Dar-i-Ghiaban, and the stream, w 7 hich at first has a consider able volume of water, gradually diminishes, but seldom entirely dries up. The lower portion of this stream is sometimes called the Mlrjaw-a river, but there is no indication whatsoever of a main channel running down this deltaic fan, which is here a series of shallow gravel mlds radiating from the upper Ladls river valley to the Bar-i-Ghlaban. In flood time its waters spill broadcast over the fan right down to the Dar-i-Ghlaban, so that it is impossible to say where at any particular point is the junction of the Ladls or Mirjawa river with the Dar-i-Ghlaban. In April 1901, owing to depredations of DamanI marauders, and their threatening attitude with regard to the Nushki-Slstan trade route, Captain Webb-Ware, Political Assistant, Chagai, thought it advisable to establish a levy post in the neighbourhood of Mlrjatva, which he did on the right bank of the Dar-i-Ghalban, in the angle formed by the above named river and the most northerly of the nalds into which the Mirjawa river divides. This is a spot, which, owung to the absence of definite boundaries, might well fall within the British border. He subsequently prevented a Belgian Customs Post being establish ed there, on the grounds that it was not Persian territory, and that one bad already been formed at Ladls, which was fully able to deal w 7 ith all existing trade. . Meanwhile representations had been made by the Persian to the British Government against the so-called violation of Persian territory, and as a con sequence, the levy post at Mirjawa was evacuated and destroyed on the 4th April 1902, and a new one established on the left bank of the Dar-i-Ghlaban, opposite Mirjawa, on ground over which there could be no dispute. This new post was called Padaha, to distinguish it from the demolished post at Mirjawa, though there is also another Padaha between Ladls and Mirjawa, with which it is liable to be confused. The Persian Customs Post was at the same time moved from Ladls to Mirjawa, and placed under Slstan. . ...Unfortunately no water is procurable at the new post of Padaha, so that the garrison there is dependent for its supply on a tank on the Persian side of the river, which is a mile distant, and which is filled from the perennial flow of the Ladis river. Meanwhile negotiations had been going on with the Persian Government for a realignment of the doubtful boundaries from Pillar No. 11, north wards, and Commissioners had been appointed on both sides to investigate the matter, and to adjust, if possible, the differences between the Tehran agreement and the Holdich award. Later, owing to the improbability of any satisfactory settlement being arrived at in the re-delimitation of the frontier, the question of the Com missioners meeting was allowed to drop, a compromise was effected, and an agreement signed on 13th May 1905 between the British and Persian Governments on the following terms— (1) The British claim to the ownership of Mlrjawa, put forward in 1902, to be withdrawn. The Persians on their side to permit the gar rison at Padaha to procure (“ using buckets or water-skins for the purpose 5 ’) the supply of water that may be necessary for it from the wells or tank situated at or near Mlrjawa. question of the further examination of the frontier line to be abandoned, and it shall be regarded as definitely settled in accordance with the agreement of 1896, and no further claim made in respect of it. Persian Government will permit the inhabitants of the frontier villages of Mirjawa, Ladis and Duzdab to sell supplies (to the annual amount of 700 Tabriz khanvarsoi grain) to the British outposts on the Indian side of the frontier, and will also allow the unrestricted export of 1,500 Tabriz kharwdrs of grain, and 50 Tabriz kharwdrs of ghi annually from Sistan, for the use of the British frontier station of Kala Robat, and others along the Nushki route. (4) The above provision applies only to normal years, when the locality is not suffering from actual famine due to destruction of its crops by locusts, blight or other exceptional visitation. The actual name of Mlrjawa is given to a small area (about 1 mile long and half a mile wide) of alluvial and arable soil in the delta of the Ladis river, where it joins the Dar-i-Ghiaban. Formerly a somewhat larger tract was cultivated, as is shown by the ruins of an old village or fort called Mirjawa Ka'leh, about 2 miles up the fan from the Dar-i-Ghiaban. Its strategical importance lies in the fact that it is at the junction of three routes which turn the Kuh-i-Taftan, on its east side, for any force advancing from the north (i) from Ladis via Sangun, (n) from Ladis via Andai and Gazu, {Hi) along the border via Guranl and Maksotag. A post at Mirjawa would control the trade along these roads, as well as along those to Jalk and Dizak, and would serve as a considerable protection to the Nushki route against Damani raiders. It would also serve as a menace to any possible Russian railway, connect ing their present Asiatic system with the Gulf.— {Showers, 1902 ; Webb- Ware, 1902 \ McMahon, 1905.) I. B.

NARMAK— A spring of sweet water and some date palms £ mile north-east of Nask (q.v.). — {James, 1909). NARMASHlR— Narmashir is a fertile district in south-east Persia, about 50 miles long by 30 broad. It forms part of the administrative district of Bam-Narmashir {q.v.). It contains or is said to contain 500 villages, large and small. Many of these villages are mere farms with a dozen inhabitants, and the whole district is parcelled out among less than ten owners, who are all wealthy Bami Khans. Supplies in moderate quantities are obtainable almost everywhere and water is abundant. From each village beaten paths and tracks radiate to all the points of the compass and it is consequently possible to traverse the district from end to end several times each time using a distinct route. The prosperity of the district depends entirely on the cultivation of henna.— (Ogilvie, 1907.) NARF— A village of 20 houses, miles south of Nagar {q.v.) in the Kirman district. NARZ— See Fadumi. NASARABAD—Elev. 4,200'. A place permanently occupied by nomads, 6 miles east of Vasht. There are some 30 ghiddns and a small amount of cultivated land. The people own about 1,000 sheep and goats, a few camels and donkeys, and some 25 head of cattle. There is a good perennial supply of water through a Jcdriz from Kuh-i-Panj Angusht. Supplies scanty.— {Brazier* Creagh, 1891.) t Not murkod on map.446 NAS—NAS NASFANDEH— A stage in the Kain district of Khorasan, on the route from Randan to Shusp known as the Rah-i-Anjireh.

NAS FAR AN— An affluent of the Rint river {vide Rint) in Persian Raluchistan, which falls into it below Pint. It appears to be that which joins the river at Kuran- dab {q.v.) ; but possibly there are several which come in at this point. Vajbis (g'.'y.) may be on this stream. NASlRI— A sub-district in Rampur {q.v.), in Persian Raluchistan. NASK— A small village, population about 60 peasants, the property of the inhabi tants of Kashit {q.v.). About 30 kharudrs ( 9 tons) of wheat raised annually. There are many date palms, but the fruit is of poor quality. The fort, built on a hill east of cultivation, is in ruins. A stream which rises near Goak brings a very good supply of water ; there are also the following springs :—Zir-i-Kaleh, £ mile north-east.; Hurak, J mile north-west; and Narmak, f mile east of the fort. In the vicinity are the following small villages :—Gustak, 1 mile south-east; Akbarabad, 1| miles south-east; ’Aliabad, 2 miles south of the fort.— {James, 1909).

A qandt and village in Sarhad about 6 miles south-east of Vasht, on the Magas road. There is some cultivation, about 1,000 sheep and goats, 25 cattle, and some camels and donkeys. Supplies scanty, w T ater good.— {Sykes, 1893 ; Brazier-Creagh, 1893.) NASRATARAD SIPI-^Lat. 29° 51' 0'. Long. 59° 53' 50'. Elev. 3,836'. A village and fortified post in Kirman, on the caravan track across the Lut from Ram to Nasratabad (Sistan), from the former of which place it is distant 144 miles, and from the latter 145 miles. The village is situatedin a valley, 7 miles broad, which in wet weather is completely under water, and in dry weather is so thickly covered with saline efflorescence as to wear the appearance of being deep in snow. It is the furthest inhabited spot on the north-east frontier of the Kirman province, and is purely a government place, maintained for the protection of kdfilehs passing to and from Sistan. The settlement consists of a mud fort with walls 30 feet high, and forti fied with nine round towers and a bdla Tchdneh. Each face is 100 yards long, and the place can accommodate 350 men. Originally strongly built, it was in rather a ruinous state when Dobbs visited it in 1902, owing to recent heavy rain. In 1905 further damage was done by an earthquake, which destroyed the fortified walls, and the majority of the population now live in huts which they have constructed outside. The remains of an earlier fort lie to the noith of the present site. There are four houses of Persians, who live on Government ground near the forts, also 30 houses of Ilidt Baluchis who live on the Kuh-i-Khul in summer. They are scattered about in huts in the tagaz jungle. There is a Persian telegraph office with a ghuldm in charge. The inhabita^its are not soldiers, but a sort of levies, wfflo were impressed from Narmashir, and originally were not allowed to have their wives or female relatives with them. They number about 100, the garrison of regular troops consisting of one sultan (captain), one naib (lieutenant), and ten sarbUzes. A portion of the salt swamp surrounding the settlement has been reclaimed. The cultivated area, which covers about 10 acres, but which might be largely extended, is irrigated by a good qandt of slightly brackish water, and produces annually about 300 mans of cotton and 1,400 mans of wheat and barley. This suffices for the needs' of the post, but leaves little over for the use of caravans. The place is surrounded by a gaz and tapaz jungle. There are also other descriptions of trees and shrubs affording good grazing for camels. There is a sort of coarse grass in plenty for donkeys. Livestock consist of 4 cows, 2 oxen, and some camels. The water is brought in qandts from the Malusan range, and, though brackish, is quite drinkable. It is said to have been found on analysis by a European doctor to contain the eggs of the guinea-worm ; this disease, however, appears to be unknown among the inhabitants. In the neigh bouring hills are two or three thermal sulphur springs, with a surface tem perature of 75° F., which have a reputation for the cure of skin diseases. There is a well in the neighbourhood of the telephone house, the water of which is not very brackish. The depth of the well is about 18 feet, and water about 12 inches. There is an old qandt the water of which is said | to have been good and sweet, but it was destroyed by an earthquake about 1905. The Baluchis have also a well about \ mile from the telephone house, the water of which resembles that of the other well. The climate is pleasant in the winter and spring, but hot winds blow in summer. The temperature at 7 p.m. on the 1st February 1899 was 51° F. The two chief Baluch tribes in the neighbourhood are the Nahruis and the Isma’ilzais. Their head man is Agha Khan, Nahrui. The former reside chiefly round Kuh-i-Asar near Rud-i-Mahi, and have about 400 tents.448 NAS-NAU Their sub-divisions are Shirzai, Karamzai, Meruzai, Minai, Sombakal* Zardadzai, and Hajizai. The Isma’ilzais possess about 500 tents. From Nasratabad a road runs north-west to Neh.— (Rozario; Mac Gregor; Goldpmid; Wood, 1899; Dobbs, 1902; Grey, 1905; Gibbon, 1908.)

B. 3L2450 NEH-NEH 630 It is situated on an elevated barren stony plain surrounded by bills, and Situation. We ^ suppled with provisions. It lies in a hollow in the middle of the plain and consists of a ruined mud fort on a mound with a citadel held by a few men. It is situated at the junction of roads to BIrjand, Bandar Abbas, Kirman and Sistan. They follow two valleys separated from each other by a narrow ridge, and down these valleys the wind sweeps with terrible violence. The village contains 700 houses, but is often almost entirely deserted during the summer months. The windmills to the north of the village, some 40 in number, are worthy Windmills °* no ^ ce ‘ J ^ s the y are only used at certain time's of the year,—principally in autumn after the harvest,—they are arranged so as to utilize the north-east wind, which is the prevailing wind at that season. These windmills are mentioned by Musal- man geographers as having been in use in the tenth century of our era— that is to say, sometime prior to the introduction of windmills into Europe. During the months of June, July, August and September the bad-i-sad-u- llst-ruz (wind of 120 days) blows continuously from the north and is strong enough to turn a millstone. There are 8 qandts of water, and a fair amount of cultivation south of the village, chiefly wheat and barley, the production of grain being sufficient for local needs and to supply passing caravans. The Meshed-Sistan tele graph line passes through the village. Revenue. r ^^ ie revenue of Neh with that of seven ham lets attached to it is as follows :— Land Revenue .. .. ..

The district owns 1,000 sheep and goats, some cattle, and 50 donkeys. The road from Nigar to Kirman is practicable for artillery. Sykes, who visited Nigar in 1900, says :—• “ Nigar contains a ruin of considerable interest, which was at^one time used as a mosque, but has now only the walls left. These show unmistake- able signs of having been built at two periods, to the latter of which the burnt-brick mindr must be assigned. Only some 30 feet of this are still intact, and round it is a belt of blue kufic lettering. The mihrab bore an inscription dated A.H. 615 (A.D. 1218) until quite recently. The orienta tion being towards Jerusalem, we may feel confident that this was originally a Nestorian church, which had been converted into a mosque.”— (Brazier- {Jreagh, 1894 ; Sykes 1902.)

The city, which is now completely in ruins, must, at the time of the Arab conquest, have been a place of great importance, as Mansur-ud-din made it the capital of the whole province. Not far off is the famous Band-i-Nisa, which was built across the Narmashir stream by the wife of Ardashir, to supply the city with water. The ancient dam has long since disappeared, but another, roughly built of stones and branches of tamarisk, still regulates the water-supply of nearly the entire valley.— {Sykes, 1902 ; Newcomen, 1905.)

This route divides from that via Ispatki {q.v.) at Kahi i, which is only 7 miles west. Travellers halting there (fourth stage) would therefore probably pass Pa Gudarand cross the watershed range, halting the further side 11 or 12 miles from Kahiri. Sir F.

PARSUK KAUR— A watercourse in the Qasrqand district of Persian Baluchistan, which coming from the watershed between that place and Pishin, joins the Kaju river a short distance below Qasrqand village.—(Zove#.) PARED— A village and small*district in Persian Baluchistan, forming a division of Sarbaz.* To the north is Sarbaz proper : to the east Murtan or Murtaneh : to the south Pishin: and to the west Qasrqand. It is a hilly tract, consisting of the lower part of the upper basin of the Sarbaz river (qx ) and resembles in ts general characteristics Sarbaz proper, which it adjoins. It is, however, more open as well as considerably lower, varying in eleva tion from 2,800 feet in the north to 1,400 feet in the south. Its situation, no doubt, has given rise to its name, which is strictly speaking Pd-i-Rud, the foot of the stream” The products of Parud are those of Sarbaz generally (see Sarbaz) and include dates, beans, barley and rice, all of which ripen somewhat earlier than at Sarbaz itself. The fruits are mango, orange, and mulberry. * Our information on this point is vague. The limits of Sarbaz proper, as given under that name, are probably pretty correct, but there is considerable uncertainty about the exact political status of the country between the districts of Sarbaz proper and Pishin. It was all under Ha an Khan, chief of Sarbaz, at the time of Goldsmid’s Mission (^1871), hut whether Parud has a minor chief of its own, and whether his district includes Flruzabad and Hash, is not positively known. In HajI ’Abdul Nabi’s time (1839) Firuzabad was quite separate from Sarbaz and belonged to the chief of Qasrqand.462 PAR-PAR As in Sarbaz proper, the chief feature of the district is the Barfcaz riv6i which runs from Diphur (q.v.) in a general south-easterly direction, till it emerges from the hills below Rask. In this part of its course its bed is wider than above, in Sarbaz proper, and is much more stony with less water running. The hills also are lower, and stand further back from the river, forming a valley in contradistinction to the defiles above. The river winds from side to side through patches of cultivation and palm groves. Five or six villages lie along the banks above Parud itself. Of these we have the names of Ghafar Khan {q.v.) and Tejak. Below are other hamlets and the considerable villages of Firuzabad and Rask, all with cultivation and groves of date palm. Parud village is described as a strange looking place situated on a high bluff on the left bank of the river, which seems here to terminate, as it makes a detour at right angles to the left (east), and the two banks merge as it were into one to the eye of the downward traveller. Euan-Smith thinks it is probably from this appearance that the place received its name. A broad watercourse from the west joins the Sarbaz at the angle above mentioned. Euan-Smith says it comes from Qasrqand, but this is of course a misapprehension. According to the map it would seem to origi 1 * nate in the “ Sagar Kuh,” a large hill conspicuously marked among the lesser ranges, about 20 miles west-north “West of Parud and 11 or 12 miles west-south-west of Diphur. The village consists of the usual ruined mud fort and about 80 mud huts, with a poor population. The road from Sarbaz winds up from the river-bed through the village on to a stony plateau, where the camp ol Sir F. Goldsmid’s mission was pitched in 1871. Its elevation is probably about 2,200 feet. 'The people all about seemed to have a great fear of Ibrahim Khan, who was as much hated as feared, and whose rule was by no means firmly established. They stated that when their revenue was not made up he took a girl or two and sold them as slaves: and we heard that in these parts the price of a young man of about 25 was 12 tumans' Parud village is 26 miles from Sarbaz, with an intermediate halt at Diphur, 12 miles. Pishin is about 39 miles (three stages): and Bahfil Kalat on the Chahbar road, dividing from that to Pishin at Rask, is about 5 stages, or 60 miles. Rask is 14 miles down the river, passing Firuzabad {q.v.) at about 9 miles. Haji ’Abdul Nabi followed a direct road from Qasrqand to Parud, distance about 40 miles, halting midway at Ushaf {q.v), which may be conjectured to be near the source of the water course above mentioned as entering Sarbaz from the west. Next to nothing is known of this history of Parud. It has certainly been in Persian possession, along with Sarbaz, since 1850. Haji ’Abdul Nabi, who visited it in 1839, says that twenty years before, a Persian detach ment succeeded in levying 700 ducats (Rs. 3 ; 850) “ by means of a gun they rad with them.” In 1839 the chief was Mulla Miah, Bulidi. His revenue vas 30 ducats (Rs. 165) and 2,000 maunds of grain. But the maund is probably the local man of 3J lb to 4 lb. The rate at which the revenue in kind was levied varied from one-tenth to one-fifth and even one-third of the produce. It was considered so oppressive that most of the cultivatorsPAR—PAS 463 'Wvtf till it W ij itli lejj iCBltlj kmei groves, fee« tamleti 'ivatioi a ligl !, as it smeige i-Smitl : name, above tis of origi- ig tk Smiles ) mud im tlie ,mp of obably Khan, fiimly up k parts It at BaW- aakjis ussing t road -ay at water- rtaiuly ’Abdul etach- a they ivenufl ind ia nueia jrdof trad fled to Baku.

PASAK— An intermediate halting place in the first stage of the Qasrqand-Chahbar i route, 4| miles from the former. It is situated on the bank of a perennial stream of the same name, a tributary of the Kajii river. Camel grazing and fuel abundant. Fodder and supplies obtainable from Qasrqand. Water from stream.— {Grey, 1906.) PAS AN— A hamlet, of which only one hut is now standing, in Persian Baluchistan, about 1 mile north of Sarbaz. About 2 miles to the north-west of it is a similar place called Padok. Both these places were once inhabited, but, owing to scarcity, the people have migrated to Karachi.— {Wood, 1899.) PASGA or PAZGA— A small river or stream in Persian Baluchistan, which, rising in the Band-i-NIlag range, drains a considerable portion of the hilly country west of Bint, and eventually joins the Gidich river (q.v.). The Pasga appears to have at first a general south-easterly course. It is crossed by the road from Bint to Jashk at between 23 and 24 mdes from the former place, that is, at between 13 and 14 miles from Gari Darap. Here it flows in a broad valley full of trees and shrubs. The river-bed fs about a quarter of a mile wide and contains much tall hash (pampas grass) growing to a height of 13 feet. The Siga Pusht Kaur joins here on the left bank, and on the right bank is the Siga Pusht hill round which the road goes. {See Siga Pgsht.) The river appears to go away to the eastward. After 4 miles of travelling through a mass of sl.ur and other hills, the road descends the'difficult Ridagun Darag defile and again comes on the Pasga, which has come round from where first struck, and is now found running in a westerly, or north-westerly, direction. The stream is here 20 feet wide, with an average depth of 1 foot. Two large snow-white boulders stand in mid-stream. Floyer describes the scenery about here as magnificent. Crossing the river, the road rounds the Kalkia hill and in about half a mile again crosses the river having come round the northern end of the hill: thence through hills and for a short distance along the Kalkia stream till the river is again reached, running almost west. The ■ valley is here narrowed to half a mile, but immediately widens to a much greater breadth. On either side are low broad hills and shurs. The road follows the valley, and at 3 miles from the last crossing, or 21 from Gar Darap, is a Jcdfileh halting-place on the right bank, immediately opposite &amp; Striking rock, called Kunar Kabnu. Here the Pasga appears to makem PAS-PAS a sharp bend from west to south-east, in which direction it continues till it joins the Gidich : the united stream afterwards falling into the Rapch or Bint river (q.v.). There is nothing grand about the view here, the hills being low, and the river split into three channels, all hidden in dense pampas and “ kik ” grasses, mixed with tamarisk, oleander and other bushes. The Pasga is said to be a perennial stream, but this is not quite certain. The above description is from Floyer, who saw it in January 1876. There is always plenty of water in winter, and floods are not uncommon, vhen the river may be impassable for a day or two. If there has rot been much rain in winter the river may cease running in the hot weather, but numerous pools of water would probably be found under any circumstances. At the above mentioned camping-ground the road from Kashi and Karvan on the south meets that from Jashk.— {Floyer?) It is not certain whether the Pasga originates in the Band-i-Nilag range. It may possibly come from beyond it like the Sadaich, which is only 7 miles west of the kafileh camping-ground. PASHAMAG, KL T H-I- — * , . &lt;• A large hill in Makran, 27 miles south of Sarbaz, and 12 miles east of the road from that place to Bask. It is said to be the head-quarters of Sardar Husain Khan.— {Wood, 1899.) PASKGH— Elev. 3,846 f '. A village and small district in Dizak 63f miles from Vasht, 29£ from Magas, 35 from Sib, and 53 from Dizak. The village consists of from 80 to 150 houses, collected round an old fort at the north-eastern end of an extensive date grove. It has a great reputation for healthiness and fertility. A perennial stream of good limestone water irrigates a consider able amount of arable land. This stream, the Bud Gurk, rues in the Murghak hills, and flows via Suran and Sib to join the Magas river. Supplies are procurable in moderation, as well as fruit and vegetables.- Good rough material for suitings can be bought at reasonable rates. The inhabitants are estimated at 800, and comprise Nodizai, Sandakzai. Chahari- zai, Mazarzai, Ghamshadzai, and Shadadzai, and are probably of aboriginal (Dravidian) descent. In the village are 12 weavers, 3 iron workers, 5 shoemakers, 2 carpenters, 1 Hindu baniah. Roa*ds meet here from Rindigan, Vasht, Gusht, Sib and Magas.— {Brazier-Creagh, 1893 ; Sykes f 1893—1902.) paskGh— A valley between Jamali and Kuruk in Narm&amp;shir/Kirman.— (St. John.)

PAT— A camping-ground in Persian Baluchistan, 22 miles south-east of Dehak, situated on the Mashkil river. Fuel and grass are abundant, but the water, though plentiful, is brackish.— {Hulseberg, 1902.' PATAB or PUTAB— A small village in the Geh district {g.v.) of Persian Baluchistan. It is 28 miles north-west of the town of Geh, and 1G miles north-east of Vajbis {q.v.). It has water and palm groves. According to Grant (1809), Patab is on the road from Geh to Jashk, the next stage being Yajbis {q.v.), which is 8 or 9 miles from Kurandab. The total distance from Geh to Kurandab by this road would be about 52 miles The route travelled by Hap ’Abdul Nabi in 1839, via Chahan and Muht, makes it only about 42 miles between the same places. But perhaps the Patab route is easiei Patab appears to be erroneously placed on St. John’s map. It should be some 10 miles further north (?). This would make it only about 8 miles east of the Bint river, and, supposing there is a road, only about 18 miles from Fanuch, and the same from Bint. PATAB— A small village in Makran, about 23^ miles south of Geh, on the Bandar-Tank road. A small amount of supplies is procurable, and water from a spring. The villages of Rizdan and Nasok are close by, in the hills.— {Brazier-Creagh, 1893, from native information).

Grass and camel-grazing are abundant and a certain amount of iud.—{Jennings.) PAZM or PAZIM, see Fazm. PERSIAN (GULF)— A gulf which runs in from the Indian Ocean, between Persia and Arabia It extends from latitude 24° to 30° 20' and longitude 48° to 56° -30'. Its greatest length from Ras Jashk to the mouth of Shatt-al- Arab is 700 miles, and its breadth varies from 150 to 300 miles. It communicates with the Indian Ocean by the Straits of Hormuz, which are 35 miles wide. Fishery forms a most important industry, next, indeed, to pearl fishing throughout the whole of the Persian Gulf. The fishing localities appear to be principally on the Arab coast, but the sea about the island of Qishm, off the coast of Lar, is one of these. The total number of boats engaged m fishing in the. gulf has been calculated at 6,600, and the number of men at 46,380. On the Persian side the fishing boats are subject to a tax of 8 hrdns per boat per annum, except for the smallest kind. But this tax is subject to variations, according to the pleasure of local governors. At Lingeh, oi instance, the large boats pay 10 dollars per annum, and each fisherman 2 dollars m addition. A rough estimate of the fish caught is 160,000 tons 'per annum.—{Colonel Ross’ Report, 1881.)PETAK,— see Sarkaur (River). . : J PlB or PIP— Elev. 3,300'. The capital of Lashar, in Persian Baluchistan, situated nearly in the centre of a valley some 6 miles long by 3 broad, surrounded by hills, 49 miles north of Geh and 55 miles south of Bampur. Scattered over the valley are the following villages and date groves:— Vashmaqan, Jakkas, Patkun, PIz, Gurdahan, Kuch Khan, Hari Dug, Han Dak, Rus, and Surmich. Pib village consists of some 200 houses and huts, huddled together round a small mud fort (of no importance) quite in the open, with no date or other trees round. Population 1,000. Supplies are plentiful. There is a considerable amount of cultivation both here and in the other villages, and the tribes esources. own i ar g e fl oc ^ s 0 f g^eep and goats. The soil is good and impregnated with lime, and, being well irrigated, superior crops are produced. Fig, mulberry, grape, and pomegranate are seen, also the castor and cotton plants. Lucerne and bean crops grow well. Water is abun dant and good. Fuel and camel-grazing plentiful. Climate reported to be healthy. The following bearings of points were taken from Pib :— Kuh-i-Gatak, 204°. Kuh-i-Yazbag or Nilag, 265°. Kuh-i-Bazman, 357°. Kuh-i-Shlsheh Pusht, 48°. Kuh-i-Suhran, 56°. Kuh-i-Dahan, 75°. The lofty pyramidal Bazman peak is called here Zind-i-Pir. Kafileh routes run respectively east and west from Pib to Qasrqand via Champ (two stages) and to Fanuch and Bint via Maskhutan. The Lasharis are different from other Baluch tribes in being taller and The Lashar Baluch. physically finer men. They have a wild, indepen- dent, frank appearance, with clear-cut features and long ringlets. When seen armed and mounted on fast-stepping camels, they present a warlike appearance. They are of nomadic tendencies, and wander about with their flocks, only returning to their villages during the date harvest and to cultivate the ground, and then again wandering afar. Six miles north from Pib on the road to Isfakeh the following villages are passed. A village of some 50 flat-roofed mud houses and huts, with the remains of an old mud fort, some 20 acres of rich cultivat ed soil and a date grove. The crops are parti cularly good : jowari, lucerne, cotton, beans, onions and tobacco are seen in the gardens, also fig and mulberry trees and castor plant. A village with some 30 houses and huts, situated in a date grove 300 yards to the right, a little way below Gurdahan. Here also is some good cultivated ground. Sup plies can be obtained at either of these villages in small quantities.—^ (Brazier-Creagh, 1893.) Gurdahan.

Long. 63° 40' 0' A part of the same range as the Bampusht Kuh (q.v.) with which it is united (westwards) by Sagarkand and Mazampusht. The name Pimpiska is attached on the map to what looks lihe a considerable peak, but Lovett remarks : t£ We crossed the continuation of the Bampusht range to the east ; it was here of no great breadth, consisting only of three or four ridges, from the principal one of which, called 4 Pimpiska, ’ we obtained the direction of Kuhak and Tang.” The elevation of Pimpiska is certainly much less than that of Sagarkand, and may be taken at between 4,000 and 5,000 feet. Eastwards Pimpiska is continued by low broken ridges which join it to the Kashani Kuh and the range bounding Panjgur on the south. The road from Panjgur to Bolida and Kej, via Diz, crosses Pimpiska. It passes through narrow defiles at the foot of the Pimpiska peak. The Pimpiska part of the range is entirely within Kalat territory. To the south is the saline plain lying to the east of Diz, and to the north the country (a part of what is called the Dasht of Panjgur) is inconceivably arid, barren and desolate looking.

The heat and glare in the narrow defiles amongst these marly hills even at this season (19th October 1893) of the year was terribly trying for man and beast. At 12-45 p.m. it registered 107°. There is no water anywhere in the vicinity. This pass is most difficult for heavily-laden camels, and very narrow.—(Brem'er- Creagh, 1893.) PlR KAHTlR (Kutal) (Persian BalPchistan) — A kutal in the Slaneh Kuh range between Jalk and Nahu. The top of this kutal is 21 miles from the former place and 4 from the latter.

It is situated in the north-west corner of the plains near the right bank of470 PIR—PIS the Kaju river {q.v.), which here emerges from the hills and soon after begins to divide itself into numerous channels in the low flat country extending from here to the sea. The elevation of Pir Suhrab is probably the same as that of Churak or about 300 feet. Putli Kalat is a mile or two to the south. Pir Dastgir is the name given to this place by Grant (1809). Pir Sohraf is Beresford-Lovett’s name and he expressly mentions it as being the same as the Pir Dastgir of the old map. There is a zidrat of seme note at this place.—(6rra/ } 1906.) PlR TARI— FI oyer remarks that all the zmrats he passed going to Bint in Persian Baluchistan were called Pir Tari, that individual being a celebrated local saint.

It is the largest villags met with between Pahura and Gwader, and consists of some 300 mud huts with about 1,500 inhabitants, who are Baluchis, and slaves of the Negroid type, some of the latter having a magnificent physique. The Pishinis have a bad name, their two tribes of Rinds and Barrs being noted for their predatory and lawless ways.- Fuel is abundant and water fa rly plentiful from kdrizes. There is a Customs Frontier Post here under Bandar Abbas. The soil in the vicinity of the village looks rich, and there is extensive cultivation, cereals being principally produced. Excellent camel-grazing is found in the Pishin plain, which is very extensive, stretching eastward towards Mand as far as the eye can reach, while its western limit is said to be Qasrqand. It lies parallel to the Bampur- Magas-Kuhak plain, but at a lower level. Various hamlets and mud forts are scattered about in the neighbourhood of Pishin, the revenue of which was stated in 1899 to be 5,000 krdns, although none had been paid for the three preceeding years.—(BW, 1899; Tighe, 1902.)

A stage in the hills on the Geh-Chahbar road in Makran, 16 miles from Nur Mumdi, 42 miles from Chahbar, and 9 miles north of the PIr-i-Gurik Pass.; The name is derived from Fish, a kind of palm, and Mant, a place. The water obtained from a large pool, Talkh Ab, tastes and smells like sulphuretted hydrogen, and even camels will not touch it. A little can be got from small pools scraped in the sand, but it is very bitter. There is plenty of shelter, and fuel can be got from the tamarisk trees in the mid : other supplies are nil.

It is of considerable elevation, probably about 3,000 feet, and stands high above the low plains, from which it appears to be separated by a more or less con siderable width of small ridges. The formation of the Pitag Kuh consists of thick clays, with hard dark-coloured bands, apparently of sandstone like the rocks of Gwadar. About 10 miles above Bahu Kalat the spur of the Pitag Kuh comes down to the river bank, forming with the Jambki ridges a rather pretty gorge.— (St. John', Blandjord.)

Horsemen have to dismount and lead their horses over. There are springs on both sides of the hill. This pass was so named on account of its narrowness by Mulla Harun, a celebrated saint of Dizak, between 1839 and 1840, in allusion to the bridge over which Musalmans believe the souls of the departed have to pass on their way to paradise.

QASIMABAD— Elev. 1,530'. A small village of some 20 huts, in Persian Baluchistan 9 miles west of Bampur. The place presents a squalid and desolate appearance. The people are of the Durzadehs tribe (cross-bred, i.e., father Baluch and mother negro, or vice versa) and are all slaves of the Governor of Bampur. Forage, fuel and abundant and good river-water are procurable ; other supplies are scant. North of the village, between it and the river, there is a good deal of cultivated ground, stretching away upon both banks (but mostly on the north bank) to F hru. All this is Crown land, farmed by the Governor of Bampur, and tilled by these slaves, who receive but a bare subsistence in return for their labour. A condition of extreme ansemia and wretchedness is the natural consequence. The bulk of the pro duce, some 850,000 mans, is stored for the consumption of the garrison and for sale. A road from Bazman to Champ via Surmich (5 farsakhs south-south-east) crosses here. The river is fordable, except during heavy rain, which often causes a delay of a few days.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1893.) qAsimAbAd— A hamlet in Kirman, 21 miles east-south-east of Bam, on the road to Nasratabad.— {Dobbs, 1902.)

A large village in Makran, capital of a small sub-district of that name, ... and situated on the eastern bank of the Kaju river, and at the western end of the Qasrqand valley. It consists of a large square fort, surrounded by a number of mud-built houses and wattle and clay huts ; it contains a population of some 1,800 persons, mostly Baluchis, who seem a well-to-do and polite community. In the vicinity are extensive and scattered date-groves with considerable cultivation, the huts of the inhabitants being grouped in tens and twenties among the trees. Supplies of all sorts are procurable in large quantities, such as wheat, rice, dates, barley, millet, tobacco, beans, ghi, etc., etc.; while fruit of manykinds are plentiful in season, such as lemons, figs, pomegranates, grapes, mangoes, etc. Unlimited water can be got from the Kaju river, while &amp; little to the north-east are seven springs and several qanats. Forage and fuel are abundant, and sheep can be bought from the nomads. Camels and donkeys can be hired for transport purposes at Re. 1 yer diem ; while some coolies and two carpenters are available for labour. The climate is said to be fairly healthy, the recorded temperatures being in April 1900, at noon, 89° ; at 6 P.M., 80° ; and in May 1900, at noon 104°. On an eminence overlooking the village are the remains of an old fort which in 1839 was described as being dilapidated ; it is now in ruins. The prices of supplies in August 1906 were as follows :— Flour (wheat) .. .. 14 seers (Indian) the rupee (supply urn ertain).

Rs. 1-8 to Rs. 4 , Sugar .. 11 annas the seer- Eggs Fowls .. 4 ,, ,, dozen) .. 4 ,, each J (scarce). There are four Shikarpuri Hindu shops in the town. The town consists of a mud fort and some 300 houses of which some hundred are of mud with thatched roofs the remainder being huts made of rice straw and palm leaves, scattered through the date-groves. The place is noted for its mosquitoes, as a consequence malaria is common. Even the poorest inhabitants sleep under muslin mosquito curtains during the hot months. From the village of Qasrqand, routes radiate in various directions, ■ Route which used to make it an important trading centre in the twelfth century, when TIz was a flourishing fort. The principal routes at present are ; (1) to Bampur, 102 miles (Route 45) ; (2) to Gwadar, 160 miles ; (3) to Tank, 101 miles ; (4) to Sarbaz, 82 miles (Route 34) ; (5) to Geh, about 40 miles (Route 40) • (6) to Gwatar, 96 miles (Routes 23 and 36) ; (7) to Baku Kalat, 62* miles, v i&amp; Talang (little used). From here to Chahbar the following routes exist:— (i) Via Tallarah and Balui Sik crossing the Kaju river at Gazeh Manzil and thence over comparatively flat country to Chahbar. This is the route followed by the Russian survey party of 1899-1900. See Route No. 45 (Grey’s). (ii) Continuing down the Kaju river, via Bug to Gazeh Manzil and thence to Chahbar following the same track as in (i). This track is easier than (i), though longer, and unlimited water is available from the perennial Kaju stream. (iii) Via Geh—the longest route, which is seldom used.478 QAS—QIS The district of Qasrqand consists generally of a valley running east and west, bounded on the west by Geh, on the 18 ric ' east by the watershed of the Mazan Kaur, on the north by the Nukach hills, and on the south by the Baga-i-Band range. It is watered by the Kaju river {q-v-), which has numerous hamlets along its banks, of which Bug appears to be the chief. Its malidt in 1903 was Rs. 1,900, while its Sarddr in the same year was Jan Muhammad Khan, of the Bulidi tribe, who is said to control 500 fight ing men. The known history of Qasrqand is very scanty. No doubt at one time it formed part of the territory of the History. Khans of Kalat, but after the defeat of the Baluchis at- Chil-i-Nadir, in AJD. 1737, the Persians occupied Bashar and Amir Mahabbat was installed as Governor of Baluchistan, with his head-quarters at Qasrqand. During the anarchy, which ensued on the death of Nadir Shah, about 1742, Eastern Baluchistan resumed its inde pendence, but in 1849 the Persians seized Geh, and probably annexed Qasrqand at the same time. Since then it has formed a sub-district of Makran, under the rule of the Governor of Persian Baluchistan, resident at Fahraj or Bampftr.— (Floyer, 1876 ; Janes, 1900 \ SyJces, 1903.) QASRMUNl— A village and ndld, 4f miles from Geh on the Fanuch road, in Makran* — (Brazier-Creagh, 1893.) QIBLEH— A tract of country in the Geh district of Persian Makran, situated between Chahbar and the territory formed by Masqat. The term “ Qibleh ” implies the westerly position of this portion. With reference to the rest of Makran, it contains the townships of Sirgan, Kair, Bir, Karvan, Surag, etc., and on the coast the villages of Biz, Tank, Galag, among the most flourishing. Numerous herds of camels wander over this district kept for breeding and farm purposes. The people, however, seem poor and apathetic. The Hot and Sangalu tribes prevail.— (Ross.) qirtaT— A village in the Shamil district (q.v.). QISHM— Also pronounced Jishm and by Arabs occasionally Jazirat-at-Tawilah. The largest and most important of all the islands in the Persian Gulf; it is situated on the coast of the Persian districts of Bastak and Shamil, which it subtends from Lingeh almost to Bandar Abbas, and is divided from the mainland by the channel 1 to 8 miles in breadth known to British mariners as Clarence Strait. The islands of Barak and Hanjam may be regarded as being physically appendages of Qishm. The extreme length of Qishm from east-north-east to west-south-west is 68 miles ; its average breadth is difficult to calculate on account of the irregularity of its outline, but may be roughly stated at 10 miles, though in one place,nearly abreast of the adjoining island of Hanjam, it actually exceeds 20 The shape of Qishm is somewhat that of a fish, the eastern end represent ing the head, the western end the tail, and Laft point a projecting dorsal fin. The coast is generally rocky : its two principal salients are Laft point and Khargu point, both about the centre of the island, the former on the northern, the latter on the southern coast. Khargu point is low and rocky, but Dairistan bay to the west of it is sandy, and there are swamps inland of it. Has Dastakan, the south-western point of the island is also low and rocky : Basidu point, the westernmost, is described in the* article on Basidh. Qishm is almost covered with table-topped hills of a light brown colour with broken-down sides and in some cases of very remarkable appearance • there is, however, a general absence of dominant or characteristic peaks’ The land which rises immediately behind Qishm town continues increasing in elevation till at one point, 3 miles west of the town, it reaches 560 feet • it then falls away abruptly to a low plain which reaches across the island from sea to sea and is several miles in breadth. Beyond the plain the hills recommence but without any remarkable features until Kishkuh the highest summit on Qishm with an elevation of 1,300 feet, is reached, at about 17 miles from Basidu and nearly in the middle of the island About 3 miles west of Kishkuh, a range of dark-red hills with patches of slate colour crosses the island from north to south; where it abuts upon the southern coast, with which it is in contact for 5 miles, it con tains great salt-caverns and is known by the name of Namakdan. The largest cave is at the eastern end of Namakdan ; it is over 200 feet in height, is about as deep as it is high and has a span of 60 or 70 feet.* The general geological formation of the island is the same as that of the adjoin ing coasts. The upper strata are of course sandstone, grit and conglomerate, supported by a blue lias marl and interrupted in one place by the salt hills already described : the aspect of the whole island is that of a plateau rising by a perpendicular scarp from the sea beach and eroded by weather in many valleys, some of which are parallel to the coast. The surface of the island along the southern coast has the bleak and barren appearance usual in this part of the world in the formation to which it belongs. Qishm in fact is, apart from the villages, almost a desert, but the hills contain some wild goats, partridges and pigeons, and the plains some gazelle. The population, including Qishm town, amounts to about 13,500 souls. Nearly all are Arabs by race and Sunnis by religion ; but there are Persian communities at Qishm town and Diraku which together may number 500 souls among whom also the Sunni form of Islam prevails. The Arabs belong for the most part to tribes of Trucial ’Oman but these tribal divi sions are not here of much importance ; the Shaikh of the island belongs to a tribe called Bani Ma’in or Mu’ain who are said to be connected with Shammarof Na,jd and number in Qishm town about 100 persons. The population is said to have been considerably reduced by a severe earthquake which in 1898 visited Qishm and levelled many village with the ground. Arabic is the language of the island. £ A C ^ ve ’ with the methods of working, and the Namakdan generally are descried by Pelly in the Bombay Geographical Journal, Volum# XVII, 1865, pages480 QIS—QIS Salt is the only natural product of value, but most of the villages possess date-groves and some have small expanses of cultivation, these form ing the only verdant spots. Fishing, navigation and boat-building are the principal occupations, Qishm town and Laft village being centres of the last-mentioned industry ; but there [is also some weaving of Lungis and Chddars, and some villages are given up to camel-breeding and stock- raising. The following is a table of the native craft belonging to Qishm :— Kind. Number. Aggregate tonnage. Aggregate hands employed.

The Deputy-Governor of Bandar Abbas occasionally attempts to assert jurisdiction over the island, but his authority is not respected. The local chief through whom the general administration is carried on is the Shaikh of Qishm, who resides at Qishm town and is at present an Arab named Shaikh Hasan. The Persian central government is unrepresented save by officials of the Imperial customs at Qishm town, Laft, Dairistan and Suzeh.

The town stands on a fairly level sandy site, close to the water’s edge; it has a small date plantation on either side and several domed water reservoirs at a short distance to southward. Behind it and to the south of it the land rises in a gradual .slope from the sea till it breaks off precipitously to the north and west. Qishmis a well- built town and formerly contained several high badglrs reaching 50 to 60 feet above sea-level, but they were destroyed by an earthquake in 1898. There is an old Portuguese fort now in a ruined condition. There are several wells in and about the town, but only one,.. which is about a mile from the fort, furnishes good water; 7 birkehs also exist for storing rain water, and these generally suffice for the needs of the population. The climate is cooler than that of Bandar Abbas. The population may amount to 3,000 souls and comprises 100 families of Persians, of whom 8 are ’Awazi and 2 Hindu : the remainder of the people are Arabs of the same tribes as occupy the rest of the island. The inhabitants are mostly engaged in fishing, in trade, in boat-building and in the weaving of lungls. The chief exports are dried fish, shark-fins, lungis, salt, and ghi collected from the villages of the island ; the leading imports are rice, piece-goods, planks, and beams, coffee and sugar. Some common pottery is manufactured front the clay of the island. Date palms number about 900, and the livestoek486 QTS—QUO consist of a few camels, 30 donkeys, 160 cattle, and 200 sheep and goats. The shipping of the port (included in that of Qishm island, q.v.) is con siderable ; but there is no harbour, and off the town are several reefs of rock and sand. Vessels of moderate or large size must anchor a mile or more from the beach, but are fairly well sheltered from the prevailing winds. Qishm is the seat of a Shaikh who, under the Persian authorities, has executive power over the whole island. The town possesses a Madraseh in which advanced instruction in Arabic and theology is said to be given.— (Lorimer, 1908.)

The Little Quoin bears from it south 41° east, nearly 2 miles, and Gap Island, the smallest of the three, bears south 70° 24' east from the Great Quoin. Both these latter are called by the Arabs Binat. They have safe channels between them, which may be passed in case of necessity with soundings from 22 to 45 fathoms; between them and the main land the soundings are from 45 to 90 fathoms.-— (Brucks.) * The Arab name for the “ Quoins ” is Sallamah-u-Binataha (“ Sailamah and her- daughters.”) Great Quoin—Lat.

RAPCH (River)— A perennial river in Persian Makran which comes down by Bint in the Geh district and reaches the coast by two mouths, 9 miles apart, of which the western, Khur Rapch, is 92 miles east by south of Jashk point and the eastern and more important, Khur Galag, is 78 miles west by north of Chahbar. Both estuaries have shallow bars with deep water inside and on each is situated a small village having the same name as the Khur ; neither place, however, is much frequented except by fishing boats. Khur Rapch is the more considerable on account of its large tidal back-water and could be used by small vessels if it were buoyed. The coast on both sides of the river is low and sandy and full of creeks and back-waters. About 12-miles from the coast the Rapch river is crossed : by the land telegraph line between New Jashk and Gwadar, its width from bank to bank being at this point 612 yards. On the east bank is a telephone hut. This spot is chiefly memorable as the scene of the cruel murder by Karvan Baluchis on the 2nd December 1897 of Mr. E. Graves, Telegraph Superintendent. The country on both banks of the river from near Balak on the east to the Kashi stream on the west at a distance of from 10 to 25 miles from the sea is known as Karvan; it is, for this country, well-wooded and cultivated and abounds in small game, such as black partridge, and, in the season, duck: it contains a number of vil lages. The Rapch in flood inundates the country on both sides of it. The'usual ford is at the telegraph crossing, but abetter one exists 1| miles further down, while the last ford of all to become impassable is 3 miles further up.— (Lorimer, 1906 ; Austin, 1910.)

The streets are cleaner than is usually the case in Persian villages, from the fact that numerous rivulets, constructed for irrigating the gardens, run rapidly down them. The village is on a slope, so that these rivulets, which are on the surface about the middle of the village are, at the upper end, 16 feet under ground and only acces sible by kdhns. The arrangement of the gardens is generally the same. A row of tall, slender poplar trees runs round the gardens inside the mud wall. Between these are a few willow bushes and an occasional rose. The garden is usually full of lucerne r grown in oblong beds. This is at fre quent intervals cut down to about an inch from the ground, but the roots soon send out a new crop. There is a small and busy bazar, where, in addition to the ordinary supplies sold, knives, felts, hats, shoes, and glass bottles are made. There are several fine walled-in gardens well stocked with fruits and willow trees, and a large grarveyard filled with marble- covered tombs, for Rayln is famous for its yellow marble. The population numbers 5,000 and includes three sects, viz., Gumbai, Razai and Ismali, and four fire-worshippers. The people own 2,200 sheep and goats, 200 camels, and some 30 donkeys. There are 3 hammams (or baths), 6 merchants, 8 shoe-makers, 4 mechanics, 6 carpenters, 4 felt- workers, 7 glass-workers. Mdlidt, 4,000 tumdns : some 2,000 mans of opium are cultivated annually. _ Ud to the last fifty years the people all lived in an enormous fort, the remains of which, in a fair state of preservation, still crown the top of the hill. The fort is said to have contained 3,000 families, and the houses of the governor and the great men were very large and neatly plastered. The woodwork, however, has now been removed, and the roofs in most cases have fallen in. , Coming from the south Rayin is the first true Persian town one reaches where the women dress in white, a colour peculiar to Kirman, white being reserved for Jewesses in Yazd, and dark blue being the rule for Muham madans. . , 1 r i The town, lying, as it does, at the junction of many roads, has been ot importance for generations, and was the site of a battle between Malik Arslan and his half-brother, Bahram Shah of the Seljuk dynasty, in the twelvth century. There are some 220 families of nomads in the district, for particulars of which see Kirman. RAYIN— Lat. 27° 3' 6'; Long. 57° 10' 45'; Elev. 378'.

There are 25 huts and about 100 inhabitants; they own 150 oxen, 600 sheep and goats, 30 donkeys and 10 camels. There are also two wells with perennial water, 20 feet deep and some rain cultivation. The plain in which this village lies has a bad reputation for robberies. Jennings gives an account of one which happened shortly before his arrival. The bandits were said to be Bashakardis, and the Persian Government seemed quite unable to cope with them.— {Jennings.)rezbAnigOn— A small village of 70 houses in Rudkan and 13 miles south of Gulashkard.

RIGAN- Lat. 28° 39' 30''; Long. 59° 2' 0'; Elev. 2,288'. 1,576'—(Gra/). 2,300' {St. John). A village in the Narmashir district of Kirman, 53^ miles south-east of Bam, on the road to Bampur. It was formerly a place of some import ance, but now consists of little more than the fort and a mass of ruins. The fort has a square trace, each side being 150 yards in length. There are seven round turrets, and one rectangular one, for flank defence. It has never been completed, and there are no terrepleins nor stages, nor are there any houses (except two of modern construction) within the walls. The garrison consisted in 1898 of 10 soldiers. To the east of the present fort are the ruins of an ancient one, which is said to have been occupied up to 1870. When Newcomen visited Rigan in February 1905 it contained barely 200 people, while Grey, who passed through in September of the same year, found only 30 houses inhabited. All round, however, are hamlets from which supplies can be procured in abundance, the chief products being wheat, barley, Indian-corn, rice, millet, henna, beans of various sorts, sesame, indigo and lentils, also some opium. Cotton was formerly largely496 RIG—RIG produced, but little is now grown. A kind of grass called sarut, from which chiqs and chairs are made, is found in abundance, while the grazing for camels is considered to be the best in Persia. Water is obtained from kdrlzes which are numerous, and much of the cultivated land is ‘ mndf ’ or revenue-free. Game is fairly plentiful in the district, chinkara, wild asses, pig, wolves, jackals and foxes, besides sandgrouse, partridges, pigeon and chikor, having been met with by Jennings in 188o.^ Three routes lead from Bampur to Rigan, viz .- . . , , (i) The one traversed by Pottinger, some 170 miles in length, which possesses no advantages. _ (ii) That traversed by Sir Frederick Goldsmid, 186 miles m length. (iii) That taken by Jennings, which is according to him the best, as it is available for guns, which have already been taken along it, but to render it really serviceable some unskilled labour would be necessary in a few places. This route runs via Gazzaq, Dar-i-Kishkin, Dar-i-Ahu, Gehgan and Chah-i- Malik. TWp n.rp. also roads from Rigan to Bandar Abbas, to Nur Muhammad Kariz (in Sarhad), to Sistan, and to Bam.

In the rainy season water is available from the bands, but at other times it has to be brought from Balur Mach (q.v.), 7 miles away. There are a few inhabitants, but no supplies. Fuel and camel forage are abundant. To the north and north-east, about 8 miles off, are some arid-looking hills which form subsidiary ranges to the Jambkl Kuh {q.v.), and to the south-east is the singular mass of hills called Darabol Kuh.

RlPAK KUH— A hill in the Balm Dashtiari district, on the south (right) bank of the Kaju or Dashtiari river {q.v.). The Ripak Kuh is the easterly termination of a long chain of hills, which runs parallel to the coast as far as the Rapch river, and is in fact traceable almost to the head of the Persian Gulf. West of the Ripak Kuh the hills are called Daj Kuh, Parag Kuh, Sar Kuh, etc., while to the south-west of the Peteh Kuh, and connected with it, is the Khaki Kuh {q.v.). The general elevation of the main ridge probably approaches 2,000'feet. Eastwards the range terminates on the Dashtiari, and there is a break before the hills again appear as the Daram Kuh.

On one bank stands an old watch- tower, which formerly held a guard to protect the kafilehs from raids ; but judging from the number of graves about, the protection afforded was evidently very inadequate. Where the road crosses the stream the river bed is about 150 yards wide, all of which is covered in flood. A kdriz runs from here to Qadirabad, 7 miles to the south-west.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1894.) ROHAWA— A village in Kirman, 242 miles from Birjand, and 95 miles fiom Kirman. It contains five or six hundred houses in the midst of groves of trees.!

RtfDBAR— A rich and large district within the province of Kirman, with which is included Bashakard. On the north this district is bounded by the Kuh Shah Savaran and Jabal Bariz mountains, on the west by a line running approximately north from Jaghin to Tang-i Mardan, on the south by a line running from the Dasht-i-Kuchak to the Milan-i-Jihun (this excludes the Manujan district,which together with Bashakard is now under Rudbar), and on the east by a line running from the Kuh-i-Hudian to the Dasht-i-Kalan-i-Zahur. The revenue of Rudbar and Bashakard amounted, in 1903, to 24,000 tumdns. Though there are no trade centres worthy of the name in the district, Rudbar possesses considerable possibilities,. At present it is well watered, thinly populated, and scarcely cultivated. Nomads and their flocks wander over the country. There are 21 of these nomad tribes.* The chief river is the Halil Rud, running south by south-east. On its banks are to be found most of the inhabitants of the district. Cultiva tion is carried on by means of irrigation canals and qanats. The river is very liable to floods during the hot weather owing to the melting snows, and remains impassable sometimes for three weeks or a month. During seasons of drought it does not possess a perennial flow below Bijnabad, Like so many Persian rivers, it does not find the outlet to the sea, but dis appears into the Jaz Murian Hdmufi at its north-west extremity. Along its banks are jungles of tamarisk, kahur } and fog trees, with reeds and grass. There is excellent grazing in Rudbar and the quality of the wool is very good. Wheat and barley are cultivated. Khanu is the capital of the district, and is almost entirely populated by men who are the descendants of slaves brought to the place from Khorasan some four centuries ago. There are over 1,000 families of these people. List of the sub-districts of Rudbdr, with the mdlidt of each in 1894. Pargannah* £hanu Villages. Khanu, Gvajgun. Gilmird. Dashkirdish. Patkhun. Durkun.

It rises north of the Band-i-Nilag range, which it passes by the Siiimsan gorge, a defile we may suppose to resemble the Fanuch Pass. It is possible that the Sadaich carries off some portion of the drainage of Shahri and Rudbar, but equally probable that it rises in the Band-i-Marz or its easterly continuation, the hills south-west of Bampur. After what we may suppose to be a general southerly course through a hilly country for s: me 25 or 30 miles from the Shimsan gorge, it bends westwards, or south-westwards, passing the eastern end of the Gau Klih range* and winding in that direction lor another 20 miles or so, it turns south and passing through the coast range between the Surag and Huni hills, falls into the sea 30 or 40 miles west of the Rapdi, and about 20 miles east of the Gabrig. The Sadaich is the western boundary of Makran which, as elsewhere explained, is a mere geographical express! n, the country so called being partly in Persian, and partly in Kalat territory. In the interior it divides Ramlshk and B'nt from the Gaur and Parman districts of Bashakard. On the coast, the Makran district of Qibleh, or the Dasht, lies to the east of the Sadaich, and the Gabrig district to the west. * Or, perhaps, the Tlai range {q.v.) mentioned by Moyer. We know next to nothing of the topography of the country. 3 S. 2508 SAD—SAD Not far from the Sadaich, west of the point where the river emerges from the hills, is a pile of stones, or pillar (chadar), said to have been raised by an independent prince or malik of Makran to mark the limit of bis territory. It is known as Maliki Chadar or Chidag or, as marked on the telegraph route map, Malikani Chedag. Nasir Khan I of Kalat is said to have extended his sway to this point. • A camel road from Jashk and the coast districts immediately to its east, leads up the Sadaich, either to Bint or up through the Shimsan gorge to Ramishk and the districts west of Bampfir.* The former was travelled by Floyer in 1876 : the latter is said to be a good road, that is, it is practicable for laden camels.f According to Floyer’s account of his journey from Bint, the Sadaich is first struck at the junction of the Surini Kaur (q.v.), 30 miles from the kdfileh halting-place on the Pasga {q.v.), and 23 miles after leaving the Gidich, the intervening country being a barren shingly plain. The Sadaich is here a fine stream, much larger than in its lower course through the flat sandy country on the coast. Its bed is about a mile and a half wide, cut 100 feet deep into the stony plain. There are high hills as well as spurs on either side, but they appear as a rule to stand some distance back. The stream is broad but not deep, and runs pretty regularly from side to side, leaving low flats {kaches or bents). Every kaoh is well treed and grassy, and would make a good camping-ground for any party carrying their own provisions. They are all distinguished by names of their own. The kach near the junction of the Surini ndla is an admirable place[j; ; water, camel fodder and firewood being abundant and excellent. It is one of the regular halting-places for kdfilehs taking the Sadaich route into the interior. The route leads down the valley, occasionally leaving it by a steep ascent up the cliff on one side or the other, to avoid a larger bend than usual. “ Sometimes a mile through tall rich vegetation, sometimes over rough large shingle, thickly studded with feathery tamarisk, and sometimes down the broad, shallow river itself.” Where the road quits the valley it lies over stony plain until it again descends the cliffs to the stream. - Floyer appears to have followed the winding course of the river for some 25 miles; he does not give the distance. He left it about where it makes * Thence probably direct to Bam ; also to Kirman through Jiruft. -j- There can be no reasonable doubt that the Sirich of Haj i Abdul Nabi is the Sadaich . The Hajiwas at Bint in April 1839 having come from Ramishk. He relates that going from thence he returned towards Mutarabad {q.v.) until he came on the Kaur-i-Sirich, where he spent the night. He travelled in this kaur for three stages, sometimes due south, at others south-south-west, over a very difficult river-bed winding between hills. On the fifth day he arrived at the port of Sirich, a few huts of poor fishermen. From thence he went west to Gabrlg. The only puzzling thing about this is, that while Mutarabad appears to be only 10 to 14 miles north-west of B nt, the Shimsan gorge must be merely 40 miles west of the same place. However it is possible that the Haji made two stages before he struck the “ Sirich ” instead of one, as implied above. J It may safely be surmi ei that i-i.is spot wouldbe known to any inhabitant of the country as Surini Daf. Here the Bint road, quitting the river eastwards, must divide from that to the interior, vid the Shimshan defile, which continues up stream.its southerly turn for the coast hills, ascending a steep defile on the right bank. “ From the top of this was a grand view of the broad blue river, winding through a grassy, well-wooded bottom, hemmed in on both sides by fine hills.” The kdfileh route continues down the river, and would probably strike the telegraph road in the plain at 16 to 20 miles. That followed by Floyer was a short cut across the hills towards the G-abrig river. He reached the plains under the HunI hills, 52 miles from Jashk, after about 20 miles of very rough travelling without a guide. After emerging from the hills, the Sadaich, like the other rivers which cross the plain to the sea, cuts a constantly changing route through the sand strip. Where crossed by the telegraph road, its bed is only about 400 yards wide, and the running stream is considerably less than up among the hills, as so much of the water is absorbed by the soft, sandy soil. What remains is thick and muddy, very different from the clear delicious fluid in the upper course of the river. The actual bed is rich silt, which might be made to bear heavy crops. Crossing is often difficult owing to the muddy nature of the bottom. After a storm the river is often a raging muddy torrent, 200 yards across, and impassable for several days.— {Floyer.) The halting-place on the Sadaich is 11 stages, about 145J miles from Chahbar, and 14 stages (63J miles) from Jashk. Water is abundant from the river; there is also a well at Gilik {q.v.), 6 or 7 miles east. Firewood and camel-grazing are abundant. The country in the neighbourhood is all fiat, sandy plain.— {Pierce.) SAFIDAVA— Eight small springs of rather brackish water on the slopes of the Palangar Kuh, 60 miles from Girdi Chah and 30 from ’Aliabad on the way round the Sistan Hamun.— {Keyes, 19C4.) safIdganj— In the Darusar division of Persian Baluchistan there is a steep sharp- pointed cone of “ shur ” clay running up more than 600 feet high, exceed ingly regular in shape, and forming a remarkable landmark in the Zamia Mulla plain of Western Bashakard, called the Safidganj.— {Floyer.) SAFID KHANEH— A small hamlet of 13 houses, 18 miles north-north-east of Daulatabad (Bandar Abbas-Kirman rout#). Livestock: 10 donkeys, 40 cattle, 500 sheep and goats. Cultivation : wheat and rice, in small quantities. Firewood, grass, and bhusd are procurable. Good water from a kdriz and Lrge spring. There is a burj close by where 10 men are located by the Shahs ciders for protection of the road —{Sher Jang, 1902.) SAFlD KUH— Elev. 8,455'. A long range of hills in Persian Baluchistan, forming part of the eastern scarp of the Sarhad plateau. The range may be said to begin a little to the north of Jalk, though it is here known as Jalk Band, thence continuing in a north-west direction; the range is known as Dulogh Band, Darrahi510 SAF—SAG Band, and close on the twenty-eighth parallel of latitude is the peak known as Safid Kuh, height 8,455 feet approximately. It thence con tinues in a north-westerly direction to the Gili Kuh and running parallel to the Slaneh Kuh, which range it probably joins eventually. Haji ’Abdul Nabi, who was at Nahu in 1838, says the people of that place believed gold and silver to exist in the Safid Kuh. On the same hills, they told him, was found in spring a bush, which at night from a distance appeared on fire, but on approaching it the delusion vanished. This burning bush is perhaps not altogether a myth. A some whet similar phenomenon is well known to exist in the Kachhi desert on the Sind frontier, and the writer has himself seen it to great perfection.— {Mait land ; Jennings.) SAFID KUMBIL— A halting-place in Kirman, 61| miles from Minab, on the road to Rigan.

SAGARKAND— A part of the same range as the B^mpusht and Hinduan Kuh {q.v.). Sagarkand running east and v/est forms a portion of the northern boundary of the British district called Parom. The fro: tier line of Kalat and Persian territory, as laid down by General Goldsmid’s mission, runs for some distance along the crest of Sagarkand. The elevation of the range is probably not for short of 5,000 feet, though in one part it rises into a peak which may be higher. As St. John says, “ the Bampusht hills continue their bold scarp under the name of the Kuh-i-Mazampusht, in the same even west to east direction, until they end in a loftier and bolder peak called the Kuh-i-Sagarkand. Beyond this, which marks the frontier, the hills diminish rapidly in height, chang ing the direction of their ridges from east to east-north-east .”—{Lovett ; St. John.) Jennings’ -route from Parom to Jalk crosses this range by a kutal called Kesri, height 3,942 feet. The same writer also speaks of a peak, the easternmost in the range, called Parmishk, which probably is the same as St. John’s Kuh-i-Sagarkand. All the drainage from this range runs to the Mashkll.— {Jennings.) SAGBANU— A hill in the Shamil district {q.v.). SAGHlN, RUDKHANEH-I- — See Manujan River. SAGUCH— A village of about 50 houses in Kirman, about 9 miles south-east of Mahun and about 3 miles to the east of the road from that place to Bam,via JNamd.

Formerly there was a small village and fort here, but they are now in ruins, and there only exist a few huts with three orchards and patches of ground which are being prepared for spring sowing. No supplies ; fuel abundant, also water, which is obtained from a kdriz Supplies running down from the hills. Good cornel- grazing along the valley ; which is scarce in winter.

SAIF-UD-DIN, KGH-I- (Kirman) — A range of hills between the Jamal Bariz Kuh and the Bazman Kuh.— (Jennings.) SAIGAN— Daman.512 SAI—SAL SAIYID HlRLTN— A ziarat in the bed of the Tank river (q.v.), believed to be the upper course of the Eir. Goldsmid calls it Shai or Syud Harun, but “ Shai ” is per haps a misprint for “ Shah.” He saw “ a tree which, though a tamarisk, looked almost Druidical and quite picturesque.” But the shrine is said to be a well. “ No Baluch ever passes this place without laying there his offering : nor would he think of reclaiming any money or property acci dentally dropped. If a traveller, halting for the night, burns the wood and gives his cattle the fodder procurable on the spot, it is well ; but if he should take the wood to burn elsewhere it would be impossible to light it ; or if he should cut and carry away the grass for consumption elsewhere, it would kill the animals it was intended to nourish.” SAKANSURIAN— Elev. 3,200'.

SARBAZ— Elev. 3,184'. A village and district in Makran, situated on the Sarbaz river 68 miles south-east of Fehruj, on the road to Gwadar. The village consists now of a mass of ruins, testifying to the former im portance of the place, and is built in a small valley about one mile long by half a mile broad. The old fort, though a good deal battered about, is still very strong and stands on a shaly hill some 50 feet in height, though it is commanded by other hills within 200 yards on the southern side. It was partially destroyed by the Persians about 1830, and has not been repaired since. It is the occasional place of residence of the chief of the district. Sarbaz has very few inhabitants, as they have mostly moved away further south to escape from Persian exactions ; and whenever any of the officials appear in the neighbourhood, the small remainder take to the hills. But for this it might be very prosperous. There are 75 house holds in the village. About 50 Indian maunds of wheat and barley, 260 maunds of rice and 15 maunds of beans are grown in terraces along the valley, and dates are plentiful from groves in the neighbourhood. Fuel and grazing are scarce, but water from the river is good and fairly abundant. The district proper appears to consist of the area bounded on the north District. ^y the Zard Kuh range, which forms the watershed of the Sarbaz and Bamptir drainage ;518 SAR—SAR on the west by the watershed of the Kajil drainage , on the east by Irafshan ; and on the south by a line running throught Parud. Though hilly, it is well watered by many mountain streams, and con tains numerous small villages and a considerable amount of cultivation. The Sarbaz river which runs throughout its length has a broad gravelly bed, but the stream in ordinary times only occupies a minor part of it. Date-groves are plentiful everywhere, and fuel is usually procurable. The inhabitants are Baluchis, belonging to the Bar, Rais, Askani, Arbab and other tribes, many of whom go to Karachi and East Africa for work, so that Urdu, as well as Persian and Baluchi, is generally understood in the district The chief is a man of considerable authority. He has under him the district of Qasrqand as well as Sarbaz, and is said to be able to raise some 1,200 good fighting men. The mdlidt of the district is Rs. 5,000, paid to the Governor of Bampur. Sarbaz village lies at the junction of several hdfiteh routes, of which the principal are those leading to Bampur, Magas, and Gwadar, for particu lars of which vide Route Book.

(Wood, 1899 ; Showers, 1992 ; Tighe, 1902.) SARBAZ RIVER&gt;r BAKU RIVER— A river in Makran, one of the most important streams in that country. It rises about 22 miles north of Sarbaz village (see above) at the eastern end of the Zard Kuh range which runs from south of the Humand peak, 50 miles in a west-south-west direction and overlooks the Bampur plain. The range terminates about the Ahuran peak. From thence the Sar baz runs at first south and then about south-east through a hilly coun try of close parallel ranges for about 55 miles, till it emerges in the Pishin valley (which has an average width of 30 to 40 miles), dropping from about 6,000 feet at its source to 600 feet in the neighbourhood of Bugani, near Pishin. Crossing the valley diagonally, in a south-east direction, it turns south- gouth-west and runs through low rocky hills to the alluvial plains of . Bahu-Dashtiari (q.v.) which commence a few miles north of Bahu KaliU. It is here known as the Bahu river.

A water course, called the Kash, joins here from the west. Thence to Parud (12 miles) the river presents little change, but its bed widens and becomes much more stony, with less water. The hills on either side (mostly condo- merate ridges) are notTso high, and their bases slope in a way to form a valley, m the centre of which winds the river-bed. The country in een- eral too is much more open. The road shifts from one side of the river to the other, winding through patches of cultivation and groves of date palm. About five or six villages dot the banks. Parud {q.v.) is a strange-looking place, consisting of the usual ruined mud fort and some eighty mud huts with a poor population, and situated on a high bluff bank, left of the river’ which seems here to terminate, as it makes a detour at right angles to the felt, and the two banks merge as it were in one, to the eye of the downward passenger It is probably from this appearance that the village receives its name. A broad stony watercourse from the west joins the Sarbaz at the angle above mentioned. The road winding up through the village from the river-bed leads on to a stony and spacious plain beyond descending again into the date-groves and cultivation on the left bank of the river, crossing it at about 2 miles, and following the windings of the bed on the right side for some 9 miles, when the path leaves the river-bed and turns off abruptly to the right (west) through a narrow gorge in the hills on the bank. In less than 2 miles the gorge opens; and here the road forks, one branch leading to the village of Firuzabad plainly visible ahead on the right bank of the river, the other winding among hills and groves up to Rask About 5 miles from Parud an old ruined square tower is to be observed on the left bank. Firuzabad is a picturesque place on a high site, overlooking acres of cultivation surrounded by date palms and very luxurious mango and orange trees. Rask (q.v.) has about 160 huts and is similar to all the other Sarbaz villages. About 4 miles below Rask the river emerges into the plain which extends eastwards between parallel ranges of hills to beyond Qasrqand, and west for a very great distance. At Baftan (q.v.), 5 miles from Rask the Sarbaz is joined by a considerable affluent coming eastwards from the Qasr qand watershed. Passing Baftan, with its dense grove of date trees, 5 miles from Rask the river bends south-east, and runs apparently in a deep stony If d ' ° n t} f n g ht bank 18 a th i ck low jungle of tamarisk and caper. On the other side are stony and rather bare plains. At 15 miles from Rask it is joined by the watercourse from Murtan, opposite to the camping-place o ugani (q-v.).' hence it continues through jungle for some miles in the same direction when it turns southward entering the low hills south £• i- S j • In tbese hills it receives the watercourse which carries off the Fishin drainage. From about here it begins to be called the Bahu, and with a winding course has a general south-south-west direction. Its bed is cut deep through clay and conglomerate strata. At the point where it was left by St. John and Blanford in January 1872, some 20 miles south of Bugani, it is con- fined by cliffs 60 to 80 feet high. There are fine tamarisks in the bed at * * Pa-Ri-Rud, the foot of the stream.SAR—SAR 521 this point. A short distance to the south, it passes through a pretty gorge between the Pitag Kuh to the west, and the spurs of Jambkl to the east, thence emerging on to the alluvial plain of Bahu-Dashtiari. The left (east) bank is, however, broken by ravines and low spurs, from the Jambki ranges. There appears to be a good deal of low jungle here, in and about the river-bed, which rather increases lower down. From the some the road on the right (west) bank cuts across a bend, and at about 10 miles reaches Bahu Kalat (q.v.) which is on the east bank. The crossing here is not always easy. In January 1872 the river was 60 to 80 yards wide and about 3 feet deep, with a slow current and muddy water, presenting a great contrast to its clear and rapid stream in the hills. The actual banks are here low only 10 feet or so above the water, and are evidently over- oved m high floods. The bottom is treacherous in places, and crossing on horseback unsafe without a guide. On the side opposite the villages are many extensive clearings which are flooded for irrigation purposes the water being retamed on them by embankments. 1 . Fro f 1 Balal ! K f! at a tll i ick belt of jungle extends down the course of the river, low rocky hills on the east and a wide flat plain extending to the horh zon on the west At 8 miles or so below Bahu Kalat it enters the Sisad divi sion of the Bahu-Dashtiari districts, and here, as above stated, splits into three mam channels and a great number of smaller ones. The countrv here used to be well irrigated and fertile but owing to the river having changed its course m recent years, much of the land has now been thrown out of cultivation and ruined (see Sisad). 1 Not far to the south and west, the Sisad streams are Joined by and inter mingle with, those of the Dashtiari, or Kaju, river (q.v.) and the whole bend away south-east However, the main branch of the Bahu, called the Jadai and the main branch of the Dashtiari, though running nearly parallel to each other for a considerable distance, do not appear to unite till a point is reached fully 40 miles from Sisad, and only 10 or 11 from the sea P This place is known as Gazak Both channels axe often dry or nearly so the perennial stream being drawn off above for cultivation. A little water however, runs for some months after rain. The beds of the Jadai and the Dashtiari are surprisingly small, considering the real importance of thcs- rivers. Where crossed by the telegraph line and road about 3 miles above Gazak, they are only 70 and 30 yards wide. But when in flood they may be impassable for a considerable time. This is due apparently as much or more to the softness of the bottom as to depth and strength of the cur- rent. Floods occur only m the cold weather. At these times, curiously enough, the river may often be forded at Gazak several days before it is practicable under the telegraph line. ^ Finally the united river falls into Gwatar Bay close to the village of that name and some 8 miles west of the western debouchure of theDlsht river St John says by one or two closely-contiguous mouths.” One onl y is marked on all the maps It is possible, however, there may be a second nnel filled only in floods. The lower courses of all rivers on the i akran coast shift and change frequently owing to the soft sandy nature of the soil which has to be traversed immediately before reaching the sea Many of the rivers have more than one channel of exit 61 I. B.522 SAR—SAR At Gwatar, and the river mouths in the bay, boats are procurable for crossing the Jadai and Dashtiari when otherwise impassable. The influence of the tide appears to extend at least as far up as Gazak, and the water is salt to that point, but is drinkable where the telegraph crosses, for four months after rain. The river does not appear to be in any way navigable, even by small boats and for a short distance. Only in floods are boats used, for ferrying across goods and passengers.— (Goldsmid, 1871; Lovett, 18; 1 ; Euan- Smith ; St. John, 1871 ; Pierce ; Janes, 1900.)

On the north it is bounded by the Kuh-i-Hazar, to the west the Gudar-i-Sarduieh divides it from the district of Rabur, while to the east is the Tehrud valley, running down to Bam. On the south the plateau borders on the Garmslr or hot country, terminating at Sarbizan in a high pass of 9,200 feet, from which there is a most abrupt descent to the plain of Jiruft. The climate in summer is delightful, and the district is, for Persia, well- watered and well-wooded,, abounding in pleasant orchards, while turf is actually found in many places. The capital is Dar-i-Mazar (q.v.) which possesses a shrine, dedicated to Sultan Saiyid Ahmad Saghir, and well endowed with land, the cultivators of which constitute almost the only per manent population of the district. In some places there are the ruins of villages inhabited many years ago by the Gil tribe, but these have almost disappeared, and nowadays Sarduieh is practically only inhabited during the summer months by nomads, who migrate to Jiruft for the winter. (For list of nomad tribes, see Kirman.) The revenue of the district was 9,000 tumdns in 1903.

It is bounded on the Geography. south by the Bampur, Sib, and Magas districts ; .... on the east by British territory, the dividing line being the watershed of the Kacha Kuh from Kuh-i-Malik Siah to Mirjawa {q.v.) and thence along the course of Dar-i-Ghiaban and Talab nvers, according to_ the Holdich award of 1896 ; and on the west and north by the Kirman Desert and Sistan. With the exception of the eastern border, none of these boundaries are at all clearly defined,—one district merging into another. It consists of a high-lying plateau with an average elevation m the centre of some 5,000 feet, flanked by two parallel and south - east &gt; a *d culminating in the volcano of Kuh-i-Taftan, 12,681 feet in height. It is supposed that in Eocene times the sea flowed over the whole of Jf 18 , ^ Untry and there is still a legend connected with the Lut, to the effect that the prophet Jonah was cast up at Yunsi, some three stages to the south of lurbat, where he hid for many days under a gourd. A|ain, further to the east on the Herat road, is a village called Langar .(anchor or port), which possesses a tradition that it was once a harbour on a great inland sea. These two instances, among others, point to the probable fact that there m o St rT® been an 1 1 nland sea there at some not very remote period. tjarhad is extremely hilly, but possesses a good water-supply, fair grazing and infinite possibilities for improvement; while there are many evidences especially in the valleys of the Kuh-i-Taftan, that in former times it had reached a high degree of development and even civilization. Jtaibes 1 * 18 a m ° St deSerted ’ and is illhabited by predatory nomadSAR-SAR 525 There are no rivers or lakes worthy of the name in the district. The numerous streams and watercourses running down from the central heights of Kuh-i-Taftan either waste themselves in the Lut to the north, in the Chah Grabi Htivnun in the centre, or in the Mashkil or Talab rivers in the south and east, both of which are lost eventually in the Mashkil Hdmun, none of the waters ever reaching the sea. The principal villages are Vasht (the capital), .Sangun, Tamin, Kusha, Nazil, Deli Pamil, Deh Bala, Gazu and Duzdab, but none of them are of much importance, and consist chiefly of perhaps a dilapidated fort and a small nomad encampment. The inhabitants of Sarhad consist almost entirely of nomad tribes, who Ethnography. &amp; a f n their livin § Periodical raids upon their neighbours, by tending their flocks and cul tivating barely sufficient to supply their own wants. There is a great diversity of opinion as to the total population of the district, the estimated numbers varying from 6,000 to 40,000 souls ; but it is probable that about 30,000 is the correct figure, including some 3,000 fighting men. The most important tribes are as follows :—- Families. .. : 1,000 .. ^ 800 600 20 .. Unknown. The above tribes are again sub-divided into numerous clans and sub sections, almost every two or three families having its own generic name. The Yarahmadzai, as a matter of fact, is in itself one of the smallest of the lot, only aggregating some 50 families, but owing to their raiding propen sities under the notorious Jiand Khan, a legendary reputation has been esta blished, so that they control now about 1,000 families. Jiand Khan and his lieutenant, Murad Khan, have for long been the scourge of the country side and were quite uncontrolled by the Persian authorities till 1902 when, owing to their raids, which they had even carried into British territory,' becoming intolerable, a combined Persian and British force, with Major Showers as Political Officer, marched to Vasht and made a satisfactory settlement with them, on the terms that they should pay a fine of Rs. 17,000, that the forts of Gazu Deh Bala and Kamalabad should be des troyed and security taken from them for their good behaviour. Besides this, Persian troops were garrisoned at Vasht and Mirjawa, so that it is unlikely that they will renew their raiding into British territory for some time to come ; though too much must not be expected from a people who have been robbers for centuries. The Rikis, divided into 26 sub-sections, reside both in Persian and British Baluchistan ; the former consist of about 600 families, the latter of 400, who are located generally in the Dehgvar country. The Kurds, who formerly were the leading tribe in Sarhad, observed a strict neutrality when the Governor of Baluchistan, ’Abdul Fath Khan, was carrying on a campaign against the Yarahmadzai in 1888. This cam paign proving successful for the Persians, they sent excuses to ’Abdul Fath Daman or Yarahmadzai Isma’ilzai Rikis „ Kurds Independent non-Baluch ..,626 SAR-SAR Khan, giving as their reason for not assisting him, that they had been coerced by the Yarahmadzais and had stood aloof from fear of subsequent reprisals. These excuses were apparently accepted, and they were offered lands at Fehruj in exchange for their Sarhad property. This was agreed to and in 1889 the whole tribe moved.down to Fehruj. Treated at first with distinction, they were all subsequently seized with their women and property and massacred almost to a man. At the present day there are not more than 20 Kurd families residing in Sarhad. All these tribes, though nominally Sunni Muhummadans, are very lax in their religious duties, while Jennings remarks that all the months he was there he never saw a man say his prayers. Though professing a hatred for Shi’ahs they are in no wise fanatical, and they regard Christians with no dislike. Those residing in the neighbourhood of the Kuh-i-Taftan seem to look upon that volcano as their god—a survival, probably, of the old fire-worshipping days. Sarhad has the best climate in Persian Baluchistan. Though cold in winter, it is temperate in summer, and with an imate. elevation of 4,500 feet at Vasht it would be excellently suited for the location of British troops ; while within 30 miles of Vasht, on the slopes of Kuh-i-Taftan, exist many places which would form ideal hill depots, except that there is an entire lack of supplies. The water-supply is good and is capable of infinite expansion, and the fertility of the soil for all kinds of European fruits and vegetables is undoubted. At the present time Sarhad is but a barren country, hardly any of the _ land being cultivated, and it does not produce enough grain for its local requirements. This has to be brought from Sistan. The nomad inhabitants subsist chiefly on their flocks and scattered dategroves. Fuel also is very scarce, and, though in the spring after rain there is a considerable quantity of coarse grazing, between the months of October and February scarcely any edible grass can be found at all. It lies, however, in close proximity to all the grain- producing, stock-rearing and camel-breeding districts of South-Eastern Persia (Sistan, Narmashir, Bam, Bampur, Bazman, etc.) and there would be no difficulty experienced in importing what might be required. Sheep,, goats and cattle are numerous, and given a greater sense of security and an intelligent system of irrigation, the country is capable of great develop ment and improvment, and, with a little initial outlay, it could become a profitable and prosperous province. Its products are sulphur and sal-ammoniac, chiefly from the Kuh-i- Taftan ; and a saline earth called male or zaJc, which is widely used as a dye. Three species of asafoetida flourish, and a large trade could be done in this commodity ; the king variety being particularly valuable and plen tiful. It is commonly reported that great mineral wealth exists in the district, especially on the Kuh-i-Taftan (copper, gold, and silver being spoken of), but no confirmation of these rumours has yet been obtained. Access to Sarhad can be obtained from the coast ports of Chahbar, Gwatar and Pasni via Bampur and Magas, but these roads are suitable only for pack transport Communications.SAR—SAR 527 and are intricate and difficult. The best route for a large force, but at the same time the longest, is from Bandar Abbas via Minab and Rigan, as supplies and water are more plentiful on the way. From Bampur to Vasht it is possible, with a little difficulty, to take wheeled traffic. From the east, a practicable road runs from Ladgasht to Ladis and others from Amir Chah and Saindak, on the Nushki-SIstan route, to Ladis via Mlrjawa. From the north a track connects Kuh-i-Malik Siah with Ladis and Vasht via Duzdab. On all these roads, supplies are hard* ly procurable, and water is bad and scanty. Sarhad, as an integral part of Persian Baluchistan, is under the Governor- General of Kirman, who rules it through the Administration. Deputy Governor at Bampur, whose representa tive is stationed at Vasht. Certain taxes and revenue are nominally levied, but little of what is collected finds its way into the Persian Exchequer, as it is almost all spent on local administration and subsides. In 1903, 800 tumdns (chiefly in kind) was said to have been raised. The authority of the Persians, however, over the district is very shadowy, and each tribe is practically independent, while, with the exception perhaps of Jiand Khan, there is no Sardar (in 1905) who has any real influence or power among the various congeries of tribes. In 1902 the Persian Government were induced to occupy Vasht and Mlrjawa with troops, in order to put a stop to the incessant raids of the Damanis, but it is not yet known what permanent efiect this will have on the country. The fighting strength of the Sarhad tribes has been estimated at 3,000 men, but they are very badly armed, and there 11 are few, if any, breech-loading rifles in the district. Their power of combination too is small, as they are so constantly at feud with each other that they have no idea of unity of action. Even should they combine for a common cause, they could easily be starved into submission, by cutting off the importation of grain from SIstan ; for the country produces hardly any corn itself, and is dependent almost entirely on outside sources for its food. Strategically, however, Sarhad is of importance, as its occupation by British troops would effectually threaten any hostile advance from the north on to the Persian Gulf ; and a direct line of communication from the coast to—say^—Vasht, either from Chahbar or Bandar Abbas, would not be a matter of great difficulty. The inhabitants of Persian Baluchistan are well disposed towards Great Britain, and such a line of communication might therefore be considered to pass through friendly territory the whole way. As said before the climate of Sarhad is an excellent one, and the soil is capable of great fertility, and the water-supply abundant.— (Jennings, 1885 ; Brazier-Creagh, 1891 ; Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh, 1898 ; Showers, 1902 ; Sykes, 1903.)

SARIN KAUR— . ^ A stream in Makran, and an affluent of the Sarbaz river, which it loins a few miles south of Rask—(Wood, 1899.) J SAR-I-PAHURA, or SAR-I-EEHRUJ— Elev. 5,000'. A halting-place in Persian Baluchistan, about 13 miles 5 furlongs west of Magas on the road to Bampur. It is nearly on the watershed of the s ’ ^pidan Kuh, etc., which divide the low-lying plain of Bampur from the higher country to the east. The name signifies ‘‘ head,” or commence ment of Pahura (q.v.), a sub-division of Bampur, which is there- fore supposed to extend east as far as this place. The actual line of 3 X530 SAR—SAR demarcation is probably the water-parting, which is 3 miles west of the halting-place. The latter is described by St. John as being in the bed of a dry torrent, No supplies or forage ; water good from holes in torrent bed. Immense quantities of asafoetida and wild rhubarb grow around. The use of neither seems known to the natives. This was the last place, coming from the east, where we saw asafoetida, and the first where we saw rhubarb. Sar-i-Pahura seems to be a bleak, cheerless place. On the night of March the 29th the cold was bitter, and a piercing north wind blew in the morning.— (St. John.) .SAR-I-SHAM— An inconsiderable embankment on the highest plain south of the water- parting, 5 or 6 miles from Ghistigan, on the Perso-Baluch frontier. This plain is 3,000 feet above the sea.— (St. John.) SAR-I-SHAM— A pass in Bashakard, across the Riman Kuh, which is traversed by the Jashk-Anguran road, about 52 miles from Jashk. The pass itself is about 1 mile long, with a gradual rise on the south side and a more rapid descent on the north side. The hills to the east of it are about 2,500 feet high, while those on its west side vary from 1,400 feet to 1,500 feet.— (Medley and Massy, 1893.) SAR-I-SlKH— Elev. about 2,700'. A camping-place, 17 miles south of Pur and 71| miles north of Bandar Abbas, on the Kirman road. There are no villages near, and no supplies ; in 1894 the water was reported as good, and in 1905 as scanty and bad. It is obtained from a small stream known as the Ab-i-Khur.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1894 ; Newcomen, 1905.) SAR-I-SURAG— The remains of cultivated ground and a spring in Sarhad, 8 miles from | Paskuh on the Vasht road. The plain here is about 8 miles wide.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1893.) SAR-I-TALAB— A high rocky peak in Sarhad, a mile to the south of the road from Rigan to Vasht, and 114 miles from the former place.— (King Wood, 1899.) SAR-I'ZEH^ A halting-place in the Bam-Narmashir district of Kirman, about 15 miles south of Rigan, on the road to Kalanzau. Water, fu,el and grazing are abundant.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1894, from native information.) SARJU— A village of Dizak in Persian Baluchistan. It is about 2 miles west of Dizak fort, a sandy plain intervening. As with the other Dizak villages there are date groves here and cultivation. This village belongs to Rustam Khan, the head of an Afghan family “ recently (1871) settled in Dizlk ” ;that is, his grandfather was an emigrant from Afghanistan, and by his mother’s side, he is descended from Shah Mihrab Khan, of Pahura, who was at the beginning of the century the most powerful chief in the country. Shah Mihrab is known to have owned a village in Dizak, which may pos sibly have been Sarju. Rustam Khan is also half owner of Isfandak (q.v.), which he shares with his relative Shah Navaz, nephew of Mir Murad of Kuhak. He is described as being both in-person and manner worthy of his name ; eminently handsome and of excellent breeding. The road to the Sib valley leaves the Dizak settlements at Sarju. It crosses the dry bed of the river, and follows that of another torrent, smaller but with plenty of water, through dreary hills, skirting the great limestone rocks of the Dizak range. The watershed and boundary of Dizak is crossed at 16 miles from Sarju. _ The name 44 Sarju” means 44 head of the canal or irrigation channel.”— {St. John.) SARJU— A village of 70 houses 27 miles north-north-east of Mlnab. Khurma is largely cultivated .—{Sher Jang, 1902:) SARKAGI DAP— A date grove in Makran, about 21 miles north of Qasrqand, on the Champ-Bampur road. There are no inhabitants or supplies, but water, forage and fuel are plentiful.— {Janes, 1900.) SARKAHURA or SIRKURAN, see Bampur. SAR KAKHUN— A village near Chan in the Kirman district. SARKAL or SALKHAB— Elev. 4,092'. A halting-place in Sarhad, 103 miles east-south-east of Azizabad, on the road from there to Chah Ahmad, just beyond where it enters the Pir Suhran range. This road is here quite impossible^ for wheeled traffic owing to large boulders and steep gradients. Water is procurable from a small stream, and shrubs furnish a little fuel, but there is.no grazing. {Moore; February 1904.) SARKALAGH (Persian Baluchistan)— A small deserted fort, If miles from Gusht, on the Jalk—Ladis road.— {Jennings.) SARKAUR (River)— A river in Persian Baluchistan, which, rising about 38 miles south-east of Fehruj, in the water-shed which separates the Bampur and Sarbaz drainage, flows south-east. The road from Fehruj to Sarbaz follows its course for 30 miles from its source. For the first 6 miles of its course (after which what little water there is disappears imderground), the river-bed lies between high rocks, and is stony with deep pools. During the next 3 miles within which it receives the drainage of the Petak and Rigab nalds on the left, it is full of * 3X2532 SAR—SAR ) tall tamarisk and debris, and the flood line is seen 9 to 10 feet high, which tends to confirm the natives’ assertion that two days’ rain blocks the road, and that the river is in flood annually. About 12 miles from its source the high rocky banks give place to more open ground, with low hills on either side, and about 2 miles further on there is a semi-circular sort of ! bay—due to the backwash caused by a sudden sharp turn to the east, and to the river forging through a narrow rocky passage. The channel now becomes gravelly, with a rich growth of tamarisk, and the banks in places 1 are fringed with palm trees. About 5 miles north of Sarbaz, the Hansanu nalti, up which a track runs to Purkistan, joins in on the left, while close to the ruined fort of Sarbaz, the river is joined by the Gvaimark, a stream which receives the Naskand drainage, and the bed of which is said to be the route followed by artillery when marching from Magas to Sarbaz. From this point the river ceases to be called the Sarkaur, and is known as the Sarbaz (q.v.).—(Wood, February 1&amp;99.) SARKHA— A village of 50 houses, 24 miles north-east of Ginau. Livestock : 70 donkeys, 120 cattle, 800 sheep and goats. There are about 5,000 date trees.— (Sher Jang, 1902.) SARKHGN— r A village in the Shamil district {q.v.), 3| farsaJchs north-east of Bandar Abbas from whence people visit Sarkhun in the summer. There are plenty of naknl trees and a zidrat.

K SARKHURAN— A camping-ground on the road from Bampur to Sarbaz, on a plain so named, about 20 miles from {Euan- Smith.) * This appears to be identical with Jennings’ Sarkahura. See Bampur SARKUM— A few huts of Baluchis, forming a halting-place one stage north of Chah- bar, in Persian Baluchistan, on the road to Qasrqand.— 'Abdul Nabi ) SARNAG— Elev. 3,900'. A hamlet among the Bampusht hills in Persian Baluchistan 35 miles south of Dizak, and 18 miles south-east of Kurshan. It consists of a few ghiddns with some date palms and a little cultivation. There are no supplies ; grass, grazing and fuel are obtainable in fair quantities and water slightly brackish, in moderation. The inhabitants are wretchedly poor and seem to live chiefly on roots and the ground-up fibres of the msh palm.— {Orton, 1902.) * SARNAI— A small district on the Sarnai river, between Chiraghabad (mile 176) and Rayin (mile 196), on the route from Rigan to Minab. * The road enters the broad, shallow bed of the' Sarnai river at mile 8| from Chiraghabad, and leaves the river bed at mile 11|. The river flowsthrough low hills from this point,, on a bearing of 161° to the sea. The road down this river, turning the end of the Palanish Gazuki range (instead of crossing the Gazuki Kutals) is said to be available for wheeled artillery. At mile 10| from Chiraghabad we come to Sarnai. Here are a few huts and some 100 to 150 ghiddns. Height here at water’s edge, 796 feet Vegetation of all descriptions exists in abundance, reminding one again of the plains of India ; mighty babul trees, huge jaman trees with spreading foliage, tamarisks (both varieties), pomegranates, ber trees (the large Bengal fig), Jcahurs, Jcundrs, and date palms rival one another in the luxuriance of their growth ; while the valley, varying from half a mile to 2 miles wide, situated between low gravel and sandstone hills forming the skirts of the Palanish range, is one mass of rich foliage, irrigated cultivation, and spontaneous vegetation. The origin of the' name is ‘‘ Sar,” meaning “ head ” or “ source,” and “ nai,” a “ reed. ” Here is a dense jungle of reeds from which pipe (kalian) stems are made, and large quantities are exported from here. A plentiful stream of sweet peren nial water exists, in which are abundance of small fish. In this valley are three so-called villages, but really, as before remarked, nearly all the inhabitants live in ghiddns. The names of the Sarnai villages are Deh Musa, Rais, Malik; each with one are more kdrlzes. The inhabitants number about 500 souls, and they own 900 sheep and goats, 250 oxen, 60 camels, and 100 donkeys. Half of Sarnai is in the Bashakard district, half in the Mlnab, i.e., as far as the collection of revenue is concerned. The Bashakard district is now a sub-district of Rudbar. (See article on Rudbar.) Mlnab is under Pars.— (Jennings.) SAR PUZEH— A place in Hormuz Island (g.v.). SART AB— Elev. 1,522'. A stage on the Geh-Maluran-Fanuch and Bint-Eanuch routes, 47 miles west of Geh. The halting-place is in a ndld close to the Fanuch river-bed. There is no village near. Fuel and camel-grazing plentiful. Two deep pools of suspicious-looking water close by, under the cliffs surrounded by a large clump of old tamarisk and other trees, form the only available water-supply between here and Bint (15 miles south) at this dry season.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1893.) J SARTAB— A small village in Makran, 23 miles south-east of Geh, on the Baku Kalat road. Water from springs is abundant, and some supplies are procurable.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1893, from native information.) SARTAB DAP— Elev. 1,910'. A place_ in Mafa-an, about 20 miles south-east of Qasrqand, on the Talang—Bahu Kalat road. Two streams meet here, one issuing from, a lake a mile north of Sartab Dap, and the other from springs a mile to the north-east. These streams run into the Churak river.—(/awes, 1900.)634 SAR—SAE 6ARTAP! KAUR— A watercourse in Persian Baluchistan on Floyer’s route from Kashi to Bint. It is struck at 19 miles from Pugunzi halting-place on the Karvan stream, and about 8 miles after leaving the Tank (q.v.). The bed of the watercourse is here about 100 yards wide and it is therefore not nearly so large as the Tank and many others, but there is water in pools, driftwood for fuel (rather scarce), and camel-grazing. It consequently makes a con venient halting-place. On either side of the Sartapi are low shurs, back ed by hills 800 feet high. The road ascends the Sartapi for about 2 miles, and then ascends the left bank to a high stony plateau, reaching the Gidich river at 14 miles. The Sartapi appears to run first east and then south joining the Tank. At all events it is part of the system of the Rapch river. The name is said to be derived from “ Sard ab,” “ cold water.”— (Floyer.) SARUNADI— A halting-place on the banks of a stream in the south-west of Persia, Baluchistan. It is 26 miles west of Chahbar on the road to Jashk.— (Kinneir.) SARVISTAN or SARBISTAN— Lat. 29° 16'36'. Long. 57° 49' 47'. Elev. 3,300'. A small village in Kirman, situated on the open plain, 93| miles south east from Kirman on the Kirman-Bam-Bampur road. It bears the re putation of being one of the most desolate and wind-stricken places in all Persia. The village, which was formerly of greater importance than now, is sarrounded by a considerable amount of cultivated ground, which is well- watered, but now presents a neglected appearance. It contains one dilapidated caravanserai with a collection of low, thick walled huts built in the form of a small square as a protection from th% severe storm-winds which sweep the place. On the low ground below the serai are several large, walled-in, well-stocked gardens and orchards, and behind the largest is another collection of houses arranged in a similar square. A large irrigation channel runs along the centre here, along which fine bid and sanged trees flourish. There is small ancient masjid in a cemetery on the high ground to the east above the gardens, with four old willow trees hard by. Inside the shrine are old offerings, candlesticks, etc., like those seen at Ziarat-i-Shewib. In A.H. 1106, ot 1694 of our era, Faqlr Shah Muhammad Ulla, returning from a pilgrimage to India by way of Jalk and Dizak, collected subscriptions and built this shrine. He subsequently went to Mahun and died there ; he is reported to have been an enterprising and respected Hajl. Under a rocky ledge in a willow grove below the cultivated ground is an old mill. There are no supplies obtainable here. Fuel is scant; good water abundant; camel-grazing over the plain and along the skirts of the hills. An office of the Persian Tele graph Line is here .—(Brazier-Creagh ; 1894 ; Newcomen, 1905.)

SHAMIL or SHAMlLAT (District)— ^ - , A district of Persia, bordering the north-west side of the loop [ formed by the Gulfs of Persia and’Oman at their junction; it includes542 SHA-SHA the port of Bandar Abbas which, however, is not administratively included in the district. The bulk of Shamil lies eastward of Bandar Abbas in the form of a some- what elongated parallelogram with its south west corner at that town : the boundaries of this portion are, on the north, a line running from Kuh-i-Namak to Kuh-i- Nian in such a manner as to include Khurgu village and thence crossing the valley of the Shamil river to the Zindan hills; on the east, the Zindan hills from the Shamil river gap almost to the breach formed by the exit of the Minab river, and, on the south, an imaginary line running from the point last mentioned to the coast at the mouth of the Shamil river, and beyond the Shamil estuary the sea-coast as far as Bandar Abbas. To the west of Bandar Abbas the district is irregularly bevelled off to the coast at the mouth of the Kul river ; the northern boundary is first carried south from Kuh-i-Namak to the eastern shoulder of Kuh Ginau, the crest of which it follows westwards to the Kul river ; from the point where the boundary strikes the river to the sea the Kul itself is approximately the boundary, but a few villages, of which the most important are the two Kishars, though lying to the west of the river, are included in the Shamil district. The district is in fact a maritime plain enclosed between the sea and Physical characteristics bold moul ‘ tam ranges, of which the elevation , Physical characte.,sties. ge „ erally exceeds 3j000 feet The dominant feature of the whole country is Kuh Ginau, the summit of which reaches 7,783 feet at a point 18 miles north-north-west of Bandar Abbas. The mountains to the north of the district rise very steeply from the plain and attain 4,481 feet in Kuh-i-Namak at their western end, and 6,057 feet in Kuh Nian at their eastern extremity ; between these points they are interrupted by four gaps through which valleys of some size descend to the plain giving the range a disconnected appearance. The Kuh-i-Zindan range, also called the Rudbar hills, at the east of the district, appears to have a nearly constant elevation of over 3,000 feet. A great mountain situated outside the district but visible from the Persian Gulf is Kuh-i-Bakhun which is 42 miles north of Bandar Abbas, 10,660 feet high, and covered with snow in winter. Besides these considerable mountains the district possesses a generally low and in places ill-defined sandstone ridge, which subtends the sea- coast at a distance of from 3 to 10 miles ambdivides the country into two portions that differ widely in their characteristics; the ordinary height of this ridge is perhaps 200 feet, but at a point 13 miles west by north of Bandar Abbas and 6 from the sea it reaches a height of 1,645 feet. On the east, this ridge dies away a little beyond Baghu. Between this ridge and the mountains the land is a fertile plain, between it and the coast a sandy plain impregnated with salt and diversified, at intervals only, by date groves and small patches o f cultivation. From the sandstone ridge numerous steep-sided ravines, containing no water except during heavy rain, run down to the coast. The sea-shore is sandy in its whole extent. The only valleys of importance are : one without a distinctive name, which enters the district between Kuh-Ginau and Kuh-i-Namak and thatof the Shamil river which enters it between Kuh-i-Nian and Kuh-i-Zindan. The former contains a salt stream called the End Shur and its channels turning to the south and leaving the villages of Nung and Baghu on its right bank reaches the sea at a point 8 miles east of Bandar Abbas. The bed of the Shamil, divides on entering the district, sending one branch straight to the village of Shamil and thence south-south-east to the sea, while another branch strikes south-westwards until it receives, near Budik village, an affluent from the the hills known as the Jamush when it turns to the south-south-west and rejoins the eastern branch 8 miles from the sea: in the neighbourhood of the coast the united stream bears the name of the Rud Shirin. Both the Rud Shur and the Shamil river vary greatly in volume being sometimes wide rippling streams a few inches in depth and after rain impassable torrents ; the western branch of the Shamil river is fre quently dry. The Rud-i-Kul or Kul river, which bounds the district on the west, is salt and its riparian villages depend on wells for their drinking- water ; near Gurband it receives from the north a stream called the Rud Shur which carries part of the drainage of the southern slopes of the Kuh- Ginau. The remainder of the southern drainage of that mountain is borne by a channel which runs eastwards to Chah Chakur, then breaks through the sandstone coast range and, turning southwards, reaches the sea a very little to the west of the stream from Baghu. The district contains some clear flowing streams and a number of springs, especially in proximity to the hills. The water of most of these is absorbed in irrigation, or by the porous soil, before reaching any channel by which it could be brought to the coast. Mimosa, oleander and the wild caper are among the commonest plants and in places the country is covered with thorny jungle. The climate of Shamil resembles that of Bandar Abbas, but inland the summer heat is even more intense owing to the distance from the sea and the reflection of the sun’s rays from the bare sandy soil. The people of Shamil are of Persian race with probably a considerable Population. infusion of Baluchi and Arab blood and the . , , . universal language is Persian of a purity which increases with the distance from Bandar Abbas. Arabic is scarcely under stood and Baluchi is not heard except at the eastern end of the district. On the west side of the mouth of the Shamil river, however, is a cluster of villages near the coast, of which the inhabitants are all Baluchis speaking both Persian and a debased form of Baluchi. There are no distinct or well-known local tribes. The people are nearly all Shl’ahs with the exception of about a dozen vil lages, all further west than Bandar Abbas, which are either altogether or predominantly Sunni. _ As subjects the Shamllls are weak, peaceable and oppre ised: as cultivators they are idle and unthrifty. The majority nve m a squalid fashion in date-leaf huts, and as long as they can obtain enough dates to eat they are content to do nothing. In the interior they are cultivators, on the sea -shore fishermen and boatmen: in the season every man, woman and child becomes a date-picker. There are practi cally no arms among them; only a headman here and there owns a rifle or wo. Ihe total population, excluding Bandar Abbas, which is not ' reckoned as part of Shamil, probably amounts to about 25,000 souls^544 SHA—SHA Villages are somewhat numerous, but they are small, and those that possess as many as 100 houses are less than a score. Dates and barley form the staple of cultivation, but in mme places wheat and tobacco are grown, and a few villages Agriculture an tia e. possess a considerable acreage of henna. In a number of the villages the land is irrigated by means of channels cut from the Shamil river and ether streams ; in a few, irrigation is from wells, the water being raised by means of a balanced pole called Dur o, similar to that used is Egypt. Elsewhere the crops are grown by rainfall. The grain grown is only sufficient for home consumption ; but there is a small surplus of dates which is exported. Imports are trifling, on account of the poverty of the people, comprising little beyond tea and cotton* goods. The commercial capital of Shamil is Bandar Abbas and the currency, weights and measures of the district are (with some infinitesimal differences) the same as those of the town, except that the Indian rupee is seldom met with in the district. The area of land is generally estimated by mans, that is by the number of mans of seed grain required to sow it. The land-routes which radiate from Bandar Communications and trans- all lie in their first stages within the p0r ' Shamil district. 1. The coast-route from Bandar Abbas to Minab (54 miles) runs within the Shamil district as far as the Shamil river, and the first halting* place, Qulughan (at 24 miles) is in Shamil. Several muddy and swampy streams have to be crossed, which might at any time present difficulties to wheeled carriage, and in wet weather this route would be impracticable* The remaining stages are noticed in the article on Minab district. 2. The Rah-i-Mian or middle route from Bandar Abbas to Minab runs by Deh Nau (20 miles) and Jallabi (30 miles) to Gavarband (50 miles), which is on the route from Shamil village to Minch and 18 miles from Minab. This route is said to be a good one, and passable except in very wet weather. This is the route by which caravans for Bam, Kirman, Sistan and Khorasan ordinarily leave the district in winter. 3. The best known and most frequented route in the district is one still further to the north, which runs from Bandar Abbas by Baghu (15 miles) and Kalkazi (32 miles) to Kushku (50 miles); beyond Kushku it enters the hills by the Tang-i-Zindan or gorge of the Shamil river. This route is free from obstacles—at least in ordinary weather ; some streams are crossed here and there, and the plains traversed are hard and stony, there is also some swamp ground just before Kushku. In summer, caravans for Kirman generally leave the district by this route, and it is frequently used by hot weather caravans for Yazd. It is also a section of the Persian postal road between Bandar Abbas and Kirman. 4. The preceding routes are linked together by various cross-roads, which are considerably used. The principal of these is a route from Minab Town to Shamil village, but between Shamil village and Kushku it is bad and liable to be swept by floods. There is also a route, said to be fairly good, which runs due north from Shamil village and joins Route No. 3 near the Tang-i-Zindan. t Described by Preece in his report.546 SHA-SHA Name.

SHUTURAN— Vide Magas. SHUTUR GARDAN— A halting place between ’Aliabad and Bandan on the road from Neh to Sistan. It is about 14 miles from ’Aliabad and about 9 miles from Bandan. There is no village or habitation here, only brackish water in a river-bed. Tamarisk wood plentiful.— {C. E. Yate, 1891.) SHUZA— A large village in the island of Qishm, Persian Gulf, on the coast, 10 miles north-east of Ras Khargu. It has a date grove.— (Constable; Stiff ; Persian Gulf Pilot.) SIAHAN or Si ANEH KUH—Highest Elev. about 8,395'. A range of mountains in Persian Baluchistan, forming for a portion of its length the boundary between Persian and British territory. Its eastern extremity commences approximately in Lat. 63° 30' E., and Long. 27° 20' N., runs in a westerly direction for about 50 miles, as far as the Brinjlnan pass, and then turns north-west for another 60 or 70 miles, till Gazu is reached, where it ends abruptly in a valley of the same name. Towards its north-western termination numerous subsidiary ranges are thrown off, under various nomenclatures, so that it is doubtful if the true Siahan range really extends beyond the Kuh-i-Safid, in about Lat. 62° 10', and Long. 28°. North and east this chain is continued by the Mur Pish range, with the GUI Kuh, 9,118 feet, as its highest point. Starting from the Kuh-i-Safid the western and southern drainage of the Siahan runs into the Simish river, past Gusht and Dizak, and together with the Ruhtak, flows into theMashldd which turning north after passing the frontier fort of Kuhak, runs eventually into the Mashkid Hdmun, non^ of its waters ever reaching the sea. Its eastern drainage, in the same way, also loses itself in the Mashkid Hdmun, through numerous rivulets andSIA—SIA 671 ndlds, of which the Nukoda, Jalk and Kaladln streams are the most important ; but these, however, find their way into the Hdmun by under ground channels, not continuing their whole course on the surface. . The chief heights and passes starting from the east are :— (1) A peak near Girdi, 15 miles north-north-east of Kuhak, 5,130 feet. (2) Getam, 6,517 feet. (3) Bunsir pass, 5,137 feet, practicable for laden animals. (4) Brinjlnan pass, 4,600 feet, practicable for wheeled artillery. (5) Badamo pass, 6,788 feet. (6) Dangli pass, 5,633 feet. The range can be crossed at other places, but the passes mentioned above are the only ones practicable for transport animals. The boundary line between British and Persian territories touching the Siahan Kuh was demarcated by the Holdich Mission in 1896, and runs from a point on the Mashkid river a few miles east of Kuhak, to the crest of the hills close to the Getam peak, and thence nearly due west for 25 miles, when it stri jes practically due north towards Ladgasht, leaving the rest of the range within the Persian borders. The geological formation of the hills is slaty shale, similar to that of most of the ranges in Western Baluchistan. North of Isfandak and Kalpurkan the rocks are a good deal altered, the shale being converted into hard slate, some of it good roofing slate. The general aspect of the hills is abrupt and rugged. The ranges are jagged and broken into bold peaks, their sum mit lines being almost, or quite, impossible to travel along. Towards the edge of the desert on the east and north a sudden change takes place in the surface of the rocks. The steep and craggy ridges are replaced by gently rounded rises of low elevation, sloping away to the borders of the great desert. It certainly looks as if the lower hills had been rounded by marine or lacustrine denudation, and adds to the probability of the immense plain to the north and east having been the basin of an immense sea. South of the S’ahan is a gravel plain, sloping from the base of the hills to the Mashkid. North of the hills the base slope or daman (skirt) is an expanse of hard black gravel, falling gently for about 15 miles to the sandy desert. Like most ranges in Western Baluchistan, the ridges of the Siahan are so steep and rocky as to be almost impracticable, except at the regular and ■well-known passes. The sides of the hills are bare, and have generally little or nothing picturesque about them. This range is called Siahan in Baluchi, and Sianeh in Persian, signify ing the “ black hill ”—the former nomenclature is that now generally adopt ed.— (St. John, 1871 ; Holdich, 1901 ; Sykes, 1902.) SIAHBAND KUH— A range of hills in Sarhad, apparently forming part of the western skirt of the Sarhad plateau. It is skirted for some miles by the road from Sehkuha to Bampur via Shandak and Karvanda, and is crossed by the road from Rigan to Vasht near Ab-i-Gajjari .—(Jennings ; King Wood,JSIAHl— Elev 4,750'.

SIAH, KUH— A village in the Shamil district {q.v.). SllNEH—S iahan. SlB— Elev. 3,650'. A town and sub-district of Saravan in Persian Baluchistan. The former is situated 100 miles nearly due east of Bampur, and 25 miles east of Magas, and consists of a flourishing settlement, containing some 1,500 families, belonging to the Arbabi race. The town is built on the banks of the Ruhtak river, which flows into the Mashkid, and is surrounded by large date groves and a considerable amount of cultivation, while waterboth from the perennially flowing Ruhtak stream and from 1 arizes is abundant. Supplies are usually procurable, in good quantities, but in February 1902, when Major Tighe’s expedition visited the place, they were practically non-existent, as the previous year’s crops had been devoured by locusts. Joiva/ri and Krbi, however, could then be obtained, but fuel was very scarce, and the camel-grazing was some distance off among the hills. The Sib valley is about 8 miles broad, stony and flat, but is well watered by the Ruhtak, and is bounded on the north-east by the Sunt Kuzak, a range rising to 6,100 feet in altitude. The fort is a strong mud structure well protected by tiers of habita tions, all arianged for defence, and provisioned (in 1902) ready for a siege. The citadel stands about 60 feet high and contains a well. It has the reputation of being one of the strongest in Persian Baluchistan, and owing to the nature of the ground, would be a difficult one to shell at close range. The villages in the valley are all strongly defended and surrounded by high walls. The district itself is an important one and includes Paskuh, Gusht, Multan, Kant, Hidugeh, and Suran; while its revenue in 1902 was estimated at Rs. 14,500.— {St. John, 1871 ; Sykes, 1902; Tighe, 1902.)

SIGAHAN — Vide Siahan. SIGA PUSHT— , A hill and also a stream in Persian Baluchistan, west of Bint. ; The former is a high hog-backed hill on the right bank of the Pasga i river, and is passed somewhere about 24 miles from Bint on the Jashk road. At its foot is one of the numerous zldrats of Pir Tari. The stream enters the Pasga opposite to the hill. The road comes down it for about a mile before reaching the river.— {Floyer.)574 SIG-SIK SIGARl— A halting-place in Persian Baluchistan, 15 miles north-west of Gwatar, on the coast. Sisad lies 15 miles distant on the road to Qasrqand.— (Lovett.) SIH KUffl or SIKUHl— A halting-place on the road from Bandar Abbas to Jashk 125 miles from the former. It is close to the sea-coast, and has fresh water from wells.— (Felly.) SHIRAN KUH— A high hill in Persian Baluchistan, about 4 miles south of the Sartapi stream (y.v.). Floyer’s route from Kashi to Bint passes under the brow of Sihran at about 15 miles from Pugunzi halting-place on the Karvan Kaur. The track ascends a steep narrow defile, and descends again sharply to the Gari Kaur, in which there appears to be water. Thence a rough road over two ridges to the Sartapi. Sihran Kuh means “ crimson hill,” and Floyer remarks that it was in all lights of a soft rich crimson. SIKANDAR (Nala) (Persian Baluchistan)— A watercourse draining into the Nahu Kaur, 16f miles from Nahu on the road to Kud. There is said to be perennial water some 3 miles up its bed.— (Jennings.) SlKH LARUMBA— A needle shaped rock in Sarhad, to the east of the track from Ladis to Vasht, 16 miles from the former place .—(King Wood, 1899.) SIKKURAN— A village in Persian Baluchistan consisting of 30 huts, 5 miles from Fehraj on the Magas road. It lies on the eastern limit of the cultivation that fringes the Bampur river. It is also called Sari-i-Khauran, Sar-Kohran, and Sarkuran.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1893.) SIKUNKAN— A village in Bashakard, 38 miles north of Anguran. It stands on the Pushtar river and consists of some 50 palm leaf huts distributed in groups of 5 or 6 at intervals along both banks of the stream, which furnishes a plentiful supply of good water. The best camping-ground is behind the huts on the right bank of the river, but if much accommodation is required, space for a force of 1,000 men could be found in the open patches among the date groves. There are no supplies to speak of, only a few dates and a little Indian corn being procurable. Sikunkan, though actually in Bashakard, is on the boundary between that district and Sh&amp;hii.—(Medley and Massy, July 1893.) SIKUI— A place in the Biaban district (q.v.)SIMANDIR— A village near Bazman (q.v.) in Persian Baluchistan. SlMlSH— A stony plain, some 8 miles wide, lying to the north-west of Dizak and between the Slaneh and Mianeh ranges. It is drained throughout, i.e., from north-west to south-east, by the Simish river, which at and below Dizak is known as the Mashkid. Along this river is a good road from Dizak to Gusht, a distance of 39 miles. This latter place lies at the foot of the hills* enclosing this plain on the north, and a good road leads from it to Vasht, in Sarhad, distance 61 miles. Along the Simish river water, wood, camel-grazing and grass are said to be plentiful all the way. The plain slopes gently towards the south. Its elevation at the northern end is about 4,800 feet, while at the extreme southern end, at a point on the Mashkid river, a little to the south of Isfandak, the elevation is about 3,400 feet. This would seem to be the best line for a road from Panjgur to Sarhad, though supplies would not be so plentiful as on the Jalk road. (Jennings.) SINANl— Elev. 3,720'. A tiny hamlet among the Bampusht hills of Persian Baluchistan, about 15 miles north of Sar-i-Jangan (q.v.). It consists of a few huts with palm groves and cultivation.

There are several date groves and other villages in the neighbourhood, and sup plies and water are abundant.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1893 ; from native inform ation.) SIRGAN or SARGAN— A considerable watercourse which descends from the coast range in Persian Baluchistan, and after a general southerly course of about 30 miles through a flat, sandy plain, falls into the sea immediately west of Ras Puzim. Puzim village, if it still exists, is probably on the estuary of this stream. The Sirgan is crossed by the telegraph route from Gwatar to Jashk at about 311 miles from Chahbar, and is usually made the third stage from that place. On to the Kair river is 15 miles. The Sirgan is only a running stream after rain, but throughout the winter months a good supply of water may be obtained from holes in its bed. Firewood and camel forage moderate. Goldsmid, between the Kair and Tiz village, crossed a “ Khur Sangam r coming from the hill of Beshiman, which was forded with comparative ease.” This can hardly beany other than the Sirgan. Haji ’Abdul Nabi in 1839 halted at a place called Sorlcum, one stage north of Pazm (i.e., Puzim). This too may have been on the Sirgan. According to the telegraph map, the Sirgan rises west of, and near, a peak marked as Chandari Kuh, about 8 miles north of the halting-place.

Wheat and maize are the crops cultivated. Gum tragAcanth is produced, and a bad kind of manna from the leaves of different trees. Climate very healthy. During the cholera epidemic of 1868-69, several hundred people left Kirman and lived here until the epi demic was over. Some 3 miles west of Siruj, on the road to Mahuno, is the Siruj Pass, about 10,000' —(Schindler, 1S79.) SlSA PUSHT (Persian Baluchistan)— A mountain in the Lashar range, south of the Bampur desert.— (Jennings.) SISAD— Two- villages in Makran, situated on the banks of the Bahu river, 30 miles west of Siroki on the Dasht, 10 miles south-east of Dashtiari, and about 32 miles north-west of Gwatar, to which there is a direct road. The Bahu river, in this neighbourhood has, within recent times, changed its course nearly 4 miles to the west, and thus has made desolate a country that was formerly well cultivated and flourishing. Mr. Janes, who visited it in 1900, writes :—“ At 7 miles west o'’ Rlmdan we reached Balur Mach, from which place we passed through a jungle of brushwood for 2 miles, and again through neglected fields to the old course of the Bahu river, 3’25 miles from Baliir Mach. This river was almost dry, 60 feet from bank to bank, and 21 feet deep. Its banks were once fringed with magnificent babul trees, which are now withered, presenting a most dreary aspect. Extensive fields on both banks were formerly watered by this stream, but since the river has taken a new course, these have been fallow. Ruins of villages scattered over the country gave a most desolate appearance to the scene. In fact, the whole country from Rim dan, except Balur Mach, had the same aspect. This desolation is attributed partly to the Bahu river having taken a westerly course, and to the scanty rainfall for the past five years, but mainly to oppression from the Persian officials. The distance measured between the new and the old course of the stream is 3-8 miles.” East Sisad, lying on the west bank of the old course of the river, and I f miles from it, is a village containing some 15 families of Jadgals. Supplies are procurable in moderation, and water, from a large and deep Surface reservoir, remains throughout the year.4D2 West Sisad appears to lie at some distance from East Sisad, but no parti culars are available. The Balm river, at its crossing here, is 625 feet wide from bank to bank. No water was flowing in April 1900, but it was standing some 2 feet deep in parts. Both banks are irregular and steep, and the bed is dangerous on account of quicksands. A few camels can be hired in the district.— [Janes, 1900.)

The camp is 20 miles from Shandak and 6£ from the Jauri ndld, and lies some 4 miles to the north-west of a watershed, wrongly called a kutal, of the same name. There is no water here ; the ordinary halting-place is at Nur Muhammad Kam, some 6 miles back towards. iShandak. Unlimited grass, camel-grazing and wood on the road. The ndld joins the. Darinchah and Shandak ndlds, and the combined .stream flows through a gorge between the Rizabad range and Bazman Kuh to Narmashir. From the halting-place the road ascends a valley some 2 miles wide between the Jauri Band and the Suiabur Kuh, and at about 4 miles crosses the watershed above mentioned. Height 5,490 feet.

On the next march he followed for some miles the broad bed of the “ Tenk ” river, remarkable for its high and steep banks. He says the bed of the stream was finer than that of the Kair (q.v.) ; but he met the former in the hills, where all watercourses have larger channels than in the plain, owing to the constant changing and shifting of the latter in the sandy soil.

Afterwards the Tank is again entered, but at 11 miles the road branches to the right down (up ?) the Pulaia ndla, heading for the Sihran Kuh. Floyer describes the Tank as having rocky sides and bottom, “ for we were now fairly within the hills.” The bed is about 400 yards wide, and the hills on either side 50 to 300 feet high.

Long. 61° 2' 28' Elev. 3,538'—4,482'. The principal village in Sarhad (q.v.), in the southern part of that district, of which it is said to be the one permanently inhabited spot ; the people are said to be a wild nomadic race, averse to building regular habita tions. General Gasteiger Khan, an Austrian officer in the Persian service, passed through Vasht (which he calls Chash) on his way from Bampur to Jalk in February 1881. The fort was then in ruins, having been destroyed by the Persians seven years previously. It was surrounded by neglected orchards and a few ruined dwellings. The portion of the Sarhad plateau in the neighbourhood of Vasht is naturally very fertile “and the remains of irrigation canals may be noticed, but the whole place is at present in ruins and presents a most dismal appearance. On the dried-up plains a few miserable huts are to be seen and here and there cattle graze on the scanty herbage. “ This is a good country for sport, and abounds with gazelle (? ibex) sheep (? uridl), wild asses, panthers (?leopards), wolves and hyenas.” The elevation of the Sarhad plateau about Vasht is between 3,000 and 4,000 feet. To the south-east it appears to slope steadily towards the Magas and Sib valleys, but on the east and west towards the Dlzak valley (Gusht) and the Bampur plain there must be a considerable and perhaps606 VAS-VAS abrupt descent, though at ,some distance from Vasht. The climate is therefore cold in winter, more especially at night, when severe frosts are probably not uncommon. The summer no doubt is pleasant. A certain amount of supplies procurable at any time of year. Haji Abdul Nabi visited it in 1838. He went from Sib up the valley in a north-westerly direction and reached Vasht (which he calls Gwash) in 5 marches, aggregating 37 hos. Apparently the country is perfectly open the whole way. From Vasht the Haji went towards Bampur, reaching Rindigan in 2 stages of 8 kos each (24 to 30 miles ?) over a good road.” Gasteiger, however, was 5 days between Rindigan and Vasht, and seems to have found the first march or two difficult, until he got on to the plateau. Daffadar Kalandar Khan visited this place in 1885, having been detached from Captain Jenning’s party to explore the road from Gusht to Vasht. He reached this place by a road from Jalk via Gusht. The road is easy for camels the whole way with the exception of the Badamo pass {q.v.). From Bampur, Vasht is distant about 100 miles, the greater part of this route was visited by Captain Jennings. For list of nomad tribes, vide Baluchistan. The most influential tribe is one of the smallest, the Yarahmadzai, only aggregating some 50 families, but owing to their raiding propensities, a hegemony has been established, so that they control perhaps a 1,000 families. The Kurds who were at one period the leading tribe, number now about 20 families. The total popula tion of Sarhad was estimated in 1900 at 8,000 families, 40,000 souls. The new fort is built on the site of the old one, in the centre of the plain ^ Fort between Kuh-i-Panj Angusht and Kuh-i- as 0 ' Kohas : it can be seen for some seven miles off. At a distance it looks as imposing as it is the reverse when visited. It is rhomboidal in shape, the new addition being built on to a part of the old fort. From north to south the breadth is 75 paces, and from east to west 95. The walls are some 20 feet high, of rammed mud, and thin. There is a turret at each corner, with a staircase leading up it. There are no banquettes round the walls and the fort is unarmed. In the centre of the north face is the main gateway ; a small private gate in[the south face opens on to a neglected garden. The interior very much resembles a sarai ; many of the offices and godowns are crumbling away owing to the sandy nature of the earth of which they are made. This is on the authority of the Sartip, who also stated that his quarters were dangerous and the plaster all falls off. The Sartip's quarters are opposite the main gate. Horses, mules, camels and donkeys are tethered all round the walls of the unpaved courtyard, and feeding troughs are let into the walls. There is no water-supply within the fort but mashaks hanging from tripods are seen in front of the quarters. There is an utter want of any drainage or sanitary arrangements ; the ground is consequently saturated with all sorts of pollution. The garrison consisted in 1894 of the Sartip or general, 1 saltan, 2 naibs, , , . 35 sowars, 80 sarbaz, 30 jambas, 3 blacksmiths, Strength o t e garrison. 3 carpenters and 2 leather-workers. It is not known what is the strength of the present garrison, which was increased in 1902.Consequent on the presence of a garrison, supplies are scant here and all Resource of Vasht, supplies, the cultivation in the vicinity is under the etc. supervision of the Sartip. Barley, wheat, jowdrl cotton, and lucerne are grown and the crops are good. There is no grass or grazing, other than coarse cam el-grazing, anywhere in the district, and the statements of Captain Jennings’ surveyor, Dafadar Kalandar Khan who visited the place in 1885, are most misleading. Water is obtained from kdrlzes and is plentiful and sweet: the supply could be increased by repair* ing the old ones. The area of cultivation could be very considerably im proved as the soil is naturally fertile. Fuel is scant and has to be brought from a distance. There is an entire absence of trees over the plain, though some fine mulberry, willow and other trees flourish near the water rills by the fort. v From its elevated position and proximity of the lofty Chilan Kuh, the climate is heallty all the year round. There is a hot spring here, the water of which is conveyed by a brick built channel from miles above the fort :its temperature remains fairly con stant at 75° F. The position of Vasht is of considerable importance, being the centre of many practicable roads : From Vasht to Vid Remarks.

ANGtJRAN— A village in Bashakard, 90| miles from Jashk, situated at the junction of the Pahtik and Anghran rivers. The chief town of Bashakard and the residence of the Governor is a wretched place consisting of some 55 huts, built of date branches covered with mats, with a population of barely 200 persons. Its chief feature, and the only one which testifies to the former importance of the place, is the fort, which is the principal one in the district and is thus described by Floyer, who visited it in 1876 :— “ The massive but now partly ruined fort of Anguran, which would hold 200 men easily, and 400 in time of war, is perched on the very apex of atiarfow tongtie of land or cliff, formed by the convergence of two broad and deep torrent beds. These two rivers come from south-south-west and north-north-west, and after confluence go off to join the river Jaghin with a south-easterly course. It is a coincidetice that on the prismatic com* pass the bearings are 135°, 235°, and 335°. 5 , ;• | f ‘ The hill on which the fort stands is about 360 feet high, and being formed of a conglomerate of clay and shingle, is not quite perpendicular, though only accessible on the south-west side, in which, near the apex, is the only entrance and the only well. The only path up is narrow, tortuous, and very steep, and would be rendered very difficult by the destruction of some artificial steps which now make it practicable. “ The walls are lofty and very massive. From the base, about 7 feet upward, they are built of large boulders of rounded stones, and above that of a tenacious clay. The citadel and chief’s quarters run across the fort, rather nearer the apex than the centre, and are still in fair repair. Behind this is the main court, to which no one was allowed access but the soldiers. The walls are pierced for matchlock-men, and a platform for them to stand upon is contrived in the way usual in this country, by a kind of thick inner wall 8 feet lower than the main wall. Outside the northern wall is a dry fosse, about 25 feet deep and 20 feet broad, cut straight across the penin sula, leaving only a narrow passage between each end of the fosse and the cliff. “ In both courts, which are overlooked by the chief’s quarters, are the remains of neat rows of mat huts, in which the soldiery lived. “ The food of the fort lies all around in immense date plantations which fill the valley, and in elevated spots, in which are also grown wheat, maize, pomegranates, etc. The well, which is near the entrance, formerly reached to the bed of the river. It was choked up by the besiegers on the capture of the fort, this being about the only effective piece of destruction they perpetrated, as they could do little harm to the strong walls. The fort is of roughly triangular shape, about 180 yards long, by 60 yards broad, across the centre. At the foot of the south-west face are two buildings, which formerly served as masjids or mosques, and which afford good cover for a small attacking party. “ Such was the almost impregnable stronghold of the fierce old Saif Allah Khan, which only yielded after a year’s besetment, and it is now so little damaged that should his family and adherents wait patiently and accu mulate wealth by their flocks and agriculture, he will reign again, and from the centre keep the whole country in order.” Floyer’s anticipation, it may be remarked, regarding Saif Allah Khan again succeeding to power, was not fulfilled. . European penetrated to Anguran for seventeen years after Floy^r’s journey until, in July 1893, it was again visited by Medley and Massy, ttie latter of whom gives his impression of the place as follows :— The fort stands on, and covers, the upper surface of a small spur jutting out from the plateau between the Pahtik and Anguran rivers, upon which in more flourishing times stood the large town of Anguran. The position was well chosen as entirely commanding the roads in the Pahtik from south B 2ANG—ANJ W and north-west, and practically the north-east approach by the Anghran river. Its weak point lay in its north face being level with the Anguran plateau, and this Saif Allah sought to remedy by digging a most formid able looking ditch some 30 feet deep by 20 broad, which is still in good order. The fort consists of three portions, the hill side having been levelled for the two upper quadrangles, the third being enclosed by a wall similar in construction to that of the upper portions but not quite so massive. The walls are built of cut stone and boulders to about 6 or 8 feet from the ground, and above this of the stiff, tenacious, blue clay, so common everywhere from Jashk to the Band-i-Marz. The quadrangles are each about 50 yards square inside, the two upper enclosures being surrounded by small rooms, which served as store-houses for grain, food, ammuni tion, etc., and, as quarters for the garrison. The fort, though now in ruins, could be made tenable by a few days’ work. The walls of the lower quadrangle would have to be blown up and the material made available for strengthening the upper portions, but water would have to be got from the stream below, some 150 yards from the fort, as the only well in the fort, which was in the middle quadrangle, was filled in and destroyed during the siege which followed the murder of Ghulam ’Abbas. This well is said ’to have been excavated originally down to the level of the Pahtik river and its depth was “40 men” or about 220 feet, which very nearly coincides with the height of the middle quadrangle above the river bed, and shows the great trouble taken by Saif Allah Khan to make the fort as perfect as possible. On the plateau to the north-east, and close to the fort, are the remains of a very fine Shi’ah Mimbar built of well cut stone, and inside are some beautifully carved Arabic inscriptions on tombstones of a green marble, which is said to come from Kirman. To the south-west on the river bank is a plain square mosque in which lie the remains of Allah Wordi Khan, assassinated at the instigation of Saif Allah Khan.”— (Floyer; Medley and Massy, 1893.) ANGtJRAN (River)— A river in Bashakard which, rising in the hills to the north of the village of Askan, takes a southerly course and eventually joins the Jagin river. It receives the waters of the Pahtik stream at the village of Anguran which stands on a spur between the junction of the two, and from here onward is a river of considerable size, its bed being from 250 to 300 yards wide, and showing signs of carrying a large volume of water in the rainy season Five miles below Anguran it is joined by the Daruyar (Darusar) river from • the north, which is said to rise in the Band-i-Marz. South of Anguran are to be seen signs of old nomad encampments along the river banks, and the remains of brick-built villages—signs of better times .—{Medley and Massy, July 1893.)

They invariably occupy a subject position, the villages owned and tilled by them being always under the protection of some more warlike tribe. Pottinger’s description of the Dehwars of Kalat would serve equally well for the Arbabis of Western Baluchistan, and the former are believed to be identical with the Tajiks and Sarts of Afghanistan and Central Asia. However, Pottinger’s description of the Dehwars is not very correct, and there are Tajiks of dissimilar appearance and origin. Some of them are undoubtedly of Moghal descent, others are Iranian, f St. John thinks the Arbabis bear a far stronger likeness to the Turks of Azarbaijan than to any Persian-speaking people of modern Iran.J He also remarks that both Dehwars and Arbabis are found only on the higher plateaux of Baluchistan. There is littie doubt that Arbabis, Dehwars, and Tajiks are all remnants of races older than the Baluchis, Brahms and Afghans, who are now the pfincipal inhabitants of the countries in which they are found. The Arbabis form the bulk of the village population of Dizak, Jalk, and Kalaghan, as well as of Gusht, Paskuh, and Sib. All these districts are under the Dizak chief, who is a Barakzai Afghan by descent, his family having emigrated a good many generations ago from the Helmand. It is not unlikely that they brought the Arbabis with them, and the tribe is perhaps of the same descent as the “ Moghals ” of Southern Afghanistan. Pottinger also mentions the Arbabis, but contuses them with Nahrui Baluch {q.v.) — (St. John.) Regarding Pottinger’s mistake about the Arbabis, see article on Bam- pusht. His description of the Arbabis, whom he describes as “ the fairest tribe of Baluchis he met with, and whose elevation of countenance pre-emi nently distinguished them from among their countrymen,” applies without doubt to the ruling family of the Nahruis who had assumed the title of Arbab. — ( Jennings, 1885.)

ASKAN— A village in Bashakard, situated on the Anguran river, about 4 miles north-north-east of Anguran. It consists of a large date grove and a few huts scattered along about a mile of the river bank, and has rather more cultivation than is ssen around the hamlets south of Anguran. 61 I. B. 018 ask-asp askAn— i A mountain torrent, rising in the Hinduan range, and forcing its way between the Shuraband and Rizaband ranges enters the Mashkid stream a little to the south of Kuhak. Perennial water is always to be found in some part of its bed, and it is used to irrigate patches of cultivation on either bank, the cultivators of which are, however, nomads. The Askan cultivation lies between Ghar Gishtar and Mach Nala, on the route from Gwadar to Jalk. St. John describes this cultivation as lying at the mouth of a ravine com ing from the east 2 miles from the foot of the Hinduan Pass. “ A wall .of loose stone built across the entrance served as an escarpment to retain a platform of flood-debris and made-soil, perhaps a tenth of an acre in extent. This was planted with a few date palms, beneath which were little patches of several different seeds—cotton, barley, onions, and radishes among the number. Habitation there was none ; the little garden belonging to a tribe of nomad Baluchis encamped further U p the ravine. It appears that these ravine mouths are the only cultivated spots through a wide extent of coun try from Bampusht to Panjgur in which there are no settled villages. The inhabitants are exclusively Baluchis, owing allegiance to one or other of the powerful chiefs of the neighbourhood, often quite irrespective of the dis trict over which they wander.” On the banks of and in the Askan ravine St., John met with camps of Baluchis belonging to Persian Bampusht, to Kalati Panjgur, and to independent Kuhak. Jennings was informed that there was a dilapidated fort and some 30 bouses, but he did not see them, the owners being Muhammadzais, a branch of the Puski tribe—headman’s name, Dad Karim.— (St. John, 1871 ; Jennings, 1885.)

BAFTAN or BAFATAN— A village in Persian Baluchistan, apparently in the Pishln district, which is itself a sub-division of Sarbaz. It is situated in the plain on the left bank of the Sarbaz river, about 1 mile south of where that stream emerges from the hills. Pishin is 25 miles east-south-east. Rask village, on the Sarbaz, within the hills, is 5 miles distant; FIruzabad is 10 or 11 miles; Parud is 19 miles. To Qasrqand, westwards along the plain, is about 50 miles. That road has not yet been explored, but the country is open and easy the whole way. r Baftan is somewhat to the right of the road from Sarbaz, Parud, etc., to Pishin vzd BhganI (q.v.). On the opposite side and close to the road are the remains of the old fort and village taken and destroyed by the Persians about 1853. Sir F. Goldsmid’s Mission (1871) heard from a Persian official accompanying them, and who was present on the occasion, that they brought 5,000 men and 10 guns against the place—a statement which Goldsmid characterises as “an unquestionable fiction.” The garrison was only 100 men and the assailants lost 2 killed and 10 wounded in the attack. Haji Abdul Nabi visited Baft an in 1839 and said it was very scantily cultivated. It was then “ under a son of Mi Taj Muhammad,” by whom, he means, perhaps, Mir Jan Muhammad, of Rask. The present Baftan is in a dense grove of date trees. Barley, rice, beans, etc., appear to be procurable in moderate quantities.—(#a« 'Abdul Nabi ’ Evan-Smith.) BAGABAND, vide Baga-i-Band. BAGA-I-BAND or BAGRBAND— Elev. about 4.000 / . A range of hills in Makran lying between the Kaju and Sarbaz rivers, and running east and west, about 80 miles from the coast. Rising to an altitude of about 4,000 feet, it forms the northern boundary of the Bahu Dasutia i districts, and is crossed by several passes, leading from the coast to the interior, of which the Baichand Pass (3,820 feet) is perhaps the most important.— (Janes, 1900.)

It consists of a bungalow in which reside one and some times two of the European staff of the Central Persian Telegraph Company. Formerly these men lived at Nasratabad Sipi, but owing to the unhealthy climate of that place their head-quarters were removed to JBaghI which is more healthy being situated in the hills. There is a good and perennial water supply from a cut, led down from one of the ndlds of the Kuh-i- Malusan. This however dries up before it has gone a quarter of a mile below the bungalow. The water is good for this part of the world, as, although it contains salt, it is not particularly nauseous to the taste. On the removal here of the telegraph employes from Nasratabad Sipi, a branch telegraph was constructed to BaghI and thence to Garagheh where the main Narmashir-Sistan or Nasratabad Robat route is again struck. BaghI is connected by telephone with Robat and Nasratabad Sipi. Sup plies nil. Camel grazing, very scarce. — {Gibbon, 1907.)

BAHO or BAHU and DASHTIARI— Two districts on the southern borders of Makran, usually coupled together. Their approximate boundaries are as follows :— On the north, the Baga-i-Band range ; on the east, the frontier line between British and Persian Baluchistan, demarcated in 1871. On the south, the sea coast, from a little east of Gwatar Bay to Chahbar. On the west the eastern frontiers of the Geh district, which are not clearly defined. Though these two districts are usually spoken of in conjunction, they appear to be divided into the following sub-districts :— Sub -district. Mdlidl in 1902. Rs. Gwatar and Bahu KalSt .. .. .. 6.000 Dashtiarl 15,000 In the 18th century Bahu and Dashtlarf acknowledged the chief of k.ar» baz (q.v.), a district to the north, then one of the petty states of what has been called the Independent Baluch Confederation of Makran. About 1810, however, the local Jadgal Chiefs succeeded in separating themselves from Sarbaz and appear for a considerable time to have maintained com plete independence. For when Goldsmid visited Gwatar early in ImII, he was assm ed that, until then, never within the memory of man ha 1 Persian claims been urged upon Bahu. Tribute had formerly been paid to 61 I. B, D26 BAH—BAH Kalat through Kej, but since then the State had been independent. In 1868 Boss mentions the Jadgals as acknowledging the chief of Geh, the contiguous district to the west, which at that moment, after many changes and political fluctuations, was held by Mir ’Abdullah Gichki for the Per sian Government. The Persian Boundary Commission of 1871, under Major- General Goldsmid, formally handed over the districts to Persia, by demar cating the frontier line to east of them. It is true they had then been for some time under Persian management, and had been re-united to Sarbaz, being placed under the rule of Hasan Khan Nahrui, chief of that place, to facilitate revenue collections. The greater part of Bahu and Dashtiari consists of fairly fertile and well i watered plains, but little elevated above the sea-level. There are, how ever, various hills and ranges, running generally from east-south-east to west-north-west. Such are the Pitag Kuh (q.v.), about the centre of the district and the Ripak Kuh, more to the south, on the right bank of the Kaju river. The whole left bank of the Bahu river {q.v.) is also hilly, the country there being covered by the spurs of Jambki Kuh and ranges connected with it. The north-west corner of the district traversed by [ Lovett in 1871 is cut up by small ranges, parallel to the Baga-i-Band range. The Bahu river, known in its upper part asthe Sarbdz (g'.c.) descends through the eastern part of the district, traversing Bahu proper. Below Bahu Kalat (q.v.) it bifurcates, and each branch repeatedly re-dividing itself,makes this tract in ordinary wea' her not hing but a congeries of stream lets, and in floods a vast sheet of wat r. The district it flows through is called Sisad, or the hundred threads, probably from the multiplication of the water channe’s. Sisad is divided from Dashtiari by one of the prin cipal! treamlets of the Bahu river, at a spot where a sandstone hillock called Char-gul-ki-Dikir indicates the boundary. About here the Bahu receives an affluent, the Kaju, also known as the Dashtiari, which irrigates the Dashtiari district in the same manner as the Bahu does Sisad. The Kaju (q.v.) descends in a south-easterly direction from Qasrqand', and above Dashtiari passes through Kughi. Thus Baku and Sisad may be said to be in the Bahu river, while Kughi and Dashtiari are on the Kaju.* The united rivers then pursue a south-east course to the sea, which they reach in Gwatar Bay, at the port of that name. Dashtiari and Sisad together may be considered the westerly extension of the Dasht plain (q.v.). These last named districts are, as may be supposed, well-watered. The i streams are lined with a fringe of Fanesian mimosa, date palms, and tamarisk. On the numerous Small streams and channels of the Bahu and Kaju are various villages and hamlets, as well as a few others in the plains. The names of the principal ones are Bahu Kalat, Miri Bazar, Sisad. Nau, Baji, Behla, Churak, Chakat, Patli Kalat, etc. Concerning most of these, some little information will be found under their own names. Bahu Kalat * There is no definite information as to where the Kaju and Bahu rivers join, and the latest maps (1897) are left blank on this point. Dashtiari, or Miri Bazar is about 6 miles west of the present Bahu Channel, and in 1900 Mr. Janes does not mention the Kaju in connection with this place. ^in 1900 had a population of some 1,200 persons ; Miri Bazar in 187J was estimated at 1,200, but in 1900 it contained only 30 families : official oppression having driven the others away. Churak in 1871 had 800 souls, but in 1900 it numbered only 55 families, probably for the same reasons. The Dashtiari district from Sisad, on the south-east, to Khan, north of Churak, on the north-east, had an estimated population in 1900 of 3,000 Jadgals and about 1,200 Baluchis. The Bahu valley, as a whole, is not very fertile, though a considerable amount of cultivation exists in the immediate vicinity of Bahu Kalat and Miri Bazar. Owing to the fact that Bahu river has changed its course in the neighbourhood of Sisad {q.v.), land that was formerly highly culti vated has now lapsed into jungle, and official misgovernment is completing the ruin. Supplies can generally be obtained, however, at the principal villages. Camels are fairly plentiful, and rice, wheat, millet and barley ara raised in the district. The irrigated fields are fenced round with thorn hedges. In the cold weather numerous pools are formed by the over flow of the Baku, on which wild duck and teal disport themselves, whilst the adjacent copses afford cover to numerous black partridges. On the intervening plains between the streams are found sandgrouse and obara. Away from the rivers, the wide hot plains are irrigated by a system of reservoirs, representing considerable expenditure of time and labour. Lovett, in describing Bahu and Dashtiari in 1871, writes :— “ With regard to the aspect of these plains, nothing can be prettier than certain effects the traveller meets with. For instance, just before and after sunset, under particular conditions of the atmosphere, the landscape is charming. The hills surrounding the Dashtiari plain have very pro nounced outlines. This, with the softening effect of distance, makes their arid sides display various blues and greys, forming a delightful background for the middle distance, composed of date palm and jujube trees, and picturesque Baluch habitations. The wheels for raising water out of the wells or canals, and the groupings of the inhabitants, variously occupied, as, for instance, women fetching water, have a very good effect. But, like many oriental scenes, a nearer inspection destroys the illusion.” The inhabitants of Bahu and Dashtiari are Jadgals, Hots, Lattis, Kaisis, Lagaris, Kosagis, Shahzadehs, etc. The Jadgals {q.v.) are a Sindi tribe, undoubtedly of Lumri origin. Originally called in as mercenaries or auxili aries they became strong enough to wrest the government from the Buli- dis and the Jadgal Chiefs were for long more or less independent. The Shahzadehs are of Arak descent and also migrated from Sind. The Labis are apparently the same as the Lasis, and—like the Jadgals—of Lumri ongm ; the remainder are Baluch, the Hots being the most numerous and powerful of all the tribes in Baku Dashtiari. The Singalus, said to be an inferior branch of the Hots, are also largely represented^ Lovett thus gives his general impression of the people :— The inhabitants of Dashtiari and Sisad originally came from Sind, and speak a degenerate Sindi, mixed with worse Persian. There are a great number of slaves, and traces of African descent are frequently encountered! D “28 BAH—BAH 1 amongst the population. They live in badly-built mud huts, and are cloth- k ed in garments which are never changed, except when discarded for new ones. The men wear their hair long, and are very proud of their locks, which they keep constantly moist with rancid butter. The characteristic red skull-cap of the Baluchis was not much worn by the Dashtiaris.” It is evident the above refers mainly to the agricultural population. In all probability the Hots and other Baluch are more or less no- madic. . Owing to its southern position and low elevation, ranging from 50 to 300 feet above sea-level, the climate of Bahu Dashtiari is very hot in summer— probably hotter than the coast, which, as is well known, is almost unbear able between April and September. In winter, however, the nights are very cold, slight frosts being at times experienced. In December and January the climate is delightful, although the thermometer in the middle of the day rises to 80° and upwards. Gwatar {q.v.) is the natural port of Bahu and Dashtiari, and was noted by MacGregor in 1877 as being, with Pasni, the best place on the Makran coast for landing troops and stores. It has, however, but little trade, and any surplus produce of the district is taken to Gwadar or Chahbar. —(Ross, 1868; Lovett, 1871; St. John, 1871; Janes, 1900; Sykes, 1903.)

BAHRAMjlRD or BAHRAMKARD— Elev. 6,750'. A village in Kirman, 33 miles from the town of that name, on the road to Rabur. It consists of about 100 houses and is situated on the left bank of a stream of the same name. The latter, which is here about 20 yards wide, rises to the west of the Kuh-i-Hazar, and after a short north westerly course loses itself in the sand near Baghin. The road from Raym to Nagar passes a short distance south of the village. The surrounding district is comparatively rich, and good supplies are procurable. Water is obtained from the river.— 1902.) AHRAMKARD— See BahramjIrd.BAHR-ASMAN, A range of hills in Kirman, situated to the south-east of Rabur. It contains copper mines, which are worked spasmodically.— (Sykes, 1902.) BAHtJ KALAT— Lat. 25° 42'37'; Long. 61° 25'; Elev. 120'. 1,750'. — (St. John.) A town in Makran, situated on the eastern bank of the Bahu river,, some 35 miles north of Gwatar. It consists of two mud forts ; and several &gt;paka built houses, with a population of Baluchis and Jadgals, number ing some 1,200 whose languages are Sindl and Baluchi. There are besides five Hindu traders’ shops in the place. Supplies are abundant, and forage and firewood plentiful. Water is obtained from the river-bed, immediate ly below one of the forts, in unlimited quantities at all seasons of the year. The climate is said to be fairly healthy, and far colder in winter than at Gwadar. The following thermometer readings have been recorded :— 31st January 1872—Minimum 34° ; maximum 80°. May 1900—Noon 98° ; 6 p.m. 89°. For transport purposes camels can be procured from 12 annas to Re. 1 per diem ; and coolies at Rs. 15 per mensem. The river is crossed opposite the village by a ford, which in January 1872 was about 3 feet deep. The bottom is dangerous in places, and ford ing without a guide is unsafe, as the bed is here 60 to 80 yards wide. The actual banks are low, being only 10 feet above the stream, and the water in high floods evidently overflows them. The mdlidt in 1893 was said to be 900 tumdns ; while in 1903, that of Gwatar and Bahu Kalat combined is given as Rs. 6,000. Along the banks of the river, in the neighbourhood of the town, are numerous other hamlets, the whole district being generally called Kncheh “ the street ” the name applied, in Western Baluchistan, to any river- valley. This district appears to have been annexed by Persia about 1866.— (St. John, 1872 ; Janes, 1900 ; Sykes, 1903.) BAIDAR— A village at the foot of the Muminabad range of hills in the Naharjan sub-division of the district of Kain, Khorasan.— (Bellew.) BAJl— A village in Persian Baluchistan, a few miles north of MIri Bazar, in the Baho or Bahu Dashtlari district— (y.v.). BAKIN— A village in Kirman, 20 miles north-east of that town. It is a large place in the midst of cultivation ; but to judge from the great extent of ruins, it must once have been far more considerable.— (Gibbon.) BAKRABAD—» A village near Chari (q. v.) in the Kirman district.30 BAK—BAL 4 X BAKHT0—see MIHIBAKHT.

A halting-place in the midst of the desert of Lut in South-Eastern Khora- san, about 90 miles from Khabis, 20 miles from the Bakhtu spring, and 127 miles from Birjand on the road to Kirman ; it is situated on a low mound. There are the remains of a ruined cistern here, which for a long period has contained no water—(Khanikoff; Mohi-ud-Din.) BALAK or BALA G— Lat. 25° 39'; Long. 59° 22'. A place near the coast of Persian Baluchistan, either included in Btr ( q . v .), or forming a small district by itself. Pierce’s Telegraph Route (1883), from Gwadar to Jashk, mentions a spot called Balak, about 6J miles east of the Rapch river, where there is a well which always contains water. Grant (1809) also mentions it as a haltine- place, with wells, 17 miles from Karvan ( q . v .). ® Haji ’Abdul Nabi (1839) gives Balak, with Karvan and Surag, as divi sions of the Dasht district (see Dasht), each paying a revenue nf 40 Sitarami ducats (Rs. ? 220) to Geh. It is possible that there is an dbddl or settlement of Balaff like fkat Karvan, north of the road near the hills. BALA KALAT— A village and dilapidated fort in Persian Baluchistan, in the Kalaghan valley, about 5 miles north of AM.—(Grant, 1902.) BlL! HANARAN NALA— This ndld (a broad ravine 100 feet deep, with huge granite boulders in bed) crosses the route Jalk to Ladis between Gaz and the Bundaran Nala 13 miles from the former. Grass, grazing, and wood abundant. A road here branches off to the right over the Bali Hanaran Kutal, running to the east of Gill mountain to the Mashkid; it is said to be good for larW animals.— (Jennings, 1885.) b aden BALUCH AB— Lat, 30° 7'; Long. 60' 46' A camping ground in Sistan often used by the Baluch Iliats There are no habitations. The country is hilly. Fuel is obtained from shrubs Camel grazing is not very good; the camels get bad diarrhoea.—(^66o»* 4 *BAL—BAL 31 BALtfCH AB.—• A place 8 miles north of Zang-i-Ahmad. There is a very good spring of water there, almost sweet, and four other smaller springs in the neighbour hood. The grazing is excellent both for camels and mules, consisting of beds of reeds, tamarisk kahur, etc. extending for many miles around. At some remote time there was extensive cultivation and there are still many date palms to be seen ; fuel plentiful.— [James, 1909.) BALfJCHAN CHAH— A halting-place in the Bampur district, in Persian Baluchistan. It is in the sand desert south of Bampur proper, about 14 miles from Gazkuk {q.v.), or 27 from Qasimabad, and is generally made the second stage on the road from Bampur to Maskhutan and Fanuch. Isfakeh [q.v.) would appear to be only a short march south, but the road to this place, Geh, and Chahbar, divides at Gazkuk. High sandhills have to be crossed for a good many miles, both before and after Baluchan Chah, in the immediate neighbourhood of which place the ground is harder, and wild vegetation more abundant, but the whole char acter of the country is sterile. Water from wells is somewhat precarious, Sheep may be procured from nomad Lasharis [q.v.), but no other supplies, and the camel forage is only adapted for animals accustomed to it, not for those from the coast. There are a few stunted trees near the wells which serve to mark the spot, but firewood is scarce.— (Goldsmid; Floyer.) Floyer invariably speaks of this place as LucJidn Chdh. He knew both Persian and Baluchi well, and is therefore very likely to be correct. BALUCHI (BALUCHAN)— A village in the Jashk district (q.v.). BALUCHIS— The following account of the derivations of the names of some of the large Baluch tribes, residing in Sarhad, Bampur, Bampusht, Talk, etc., was obtained by Captain Jennings from Sardar Fatteh Muhammad of Bam pusht, his brother Yar Muhammad, and by the Riki Sardar Qadir Bakhsh of Chagird (a village of Jalk) ; also some details connected with Mir Chahkar. The Baluchis under Firuz Khan originally immigrated to this country from Halab (Aleppo in Syria), seized Minab and Bampur as well as the intermediate country. This was about one thousand three hundred and fifty years ago, when there was a fight between Imam Husain and Yazid, son of Muaviah. With Firuz Khan came nine thousand men, four thousand being Rinds and five thousand Magassis, accompanied by their families. Previous to this invasion of Makran by Baluchis, this part of the country had been in the possession of the Turks ; but in a great battle, the latter being defeated, retreated towards Persia. Firuz Khan reigned for a considerable period, and on his death was succeeded by his son, Shah Hagg.32 BAL-BAL The latter during his lifetime abdicated in favour of his son Mir Chahkar, at that time a boy aged seven years. During his reign he was attacked by an army composed of Persians and Turks, and being worsted determined to migrate to Sind and Kachhi. He was accompanied by Sardar Guhram Khan, Rind, and Sardar Bakhar (?) Khan, Magassi, together with the majority of the descendants of the Rinds and Magassis . who had come with his grand-father from Syria. Up to this period, it is stated that the word Baluch only meant (m Arabic or Turkish ?) “ a robber ” or “quarrelsome fellow but that from Mir Chahkar’s departure he and all who accompanied him received the generic name of “ Baluch ” ; but those who remained behind were not, till many years afterwards, considered Baluchis. The following is how the legend goes on :— Amongst the Rinds and Magassis, many were poor, some were afraid, while others preferred deserting Mir Chahkar and remaining in the homes they had established for themselves in their newly-adopted country. .... Those who remained behind were known from this period onwards as distinct tribes by the following names, which were bestowed upon them by Mir Chahkar 1 RikIs—A t this time these people lived on the sandy desert east and north of Jaik and they were called as above, the name being derived from “ Rek, ” a corrup tion of “ Rig,” meaning “ sand ” in Persian. , , , , ^ . They are now (1885 A.D.) for the most part to be found on the banks of the Hel- mand, in Narmashir, Sarhad, Mashkid, Kkaran, Jalk and around Bampur ; there are also some in Kalat territory. 2 Rakshanis In Baluchi “ Rakshan ” (?) means a ‘ painter [a corruption of the Persian word “ naqsheh ” (?), meaning a map]. These, not being men of war, declined to accompany Mir Chahkar, who hence bestowed the name of their calling on them as a tribe. . _ _ _ , . T _ . _ , They are now (1885 A.D.) principally met with in Kharan, Dasht, Kolwa, Kak- shanaad Sistan (?). 3. Bamaris—W hen Mir Chahkar was about to start on his expedition, at the time of morning prayer, a section of his people ran away and concealed themselves. On ! Mir Chahkar enquiring where they were, he was informed that when the mulla beat the drum for morning prayer (this mullah is called the “Mu’azzin ; ” the drum is called in Arabic “ zan ” ; in Urdu “ bang ” ; and in Baluchi “ bam ”) these people ran away. Hence as they showed the white feather at the time of “ bam,” they were called Ba maris. They are mentioned in an old Baluch ballad as follows : “ Kvrd-o-Gubol-o-Bamari ■ Har se ghulame Chakiri.” They are met with in and around Bampur, in Rudbar, and Sarhad ; while the Mans of Kahan, of whom Mir Ullah is Sardar, are said to belong to this section. For a a further account of this tribe, see account of Sarhad. ^ __ They are now (1909) under S'dyid Khan, son of Husain Khan, Nahrui. They muster 400 armed men, living in Jahangahi, Karvanda and Kunch. Head man Navab Khan : although Baluch by origin, this tri' e intermingles with the Persians, and many of them are Shi’ahs. _ {{ 4. Kalkalts—T his section received their name from the Baluch word “ Kalkuli,” which means “ boiling. ” When Mir Chankar was starting, these people said their “ deg ” (cooking pots) were not yet ready or “ kalkali,” but that when they were they would follow Mir Chahkar, i.e. as soon as they had partaken of their food. This answer was simply given as an excuse, as they meant to desert him. They reside in the neighbourhood of Bampur, also in Sinukan and neighbourhood. 5. StrBHAKis—These deserted Mir Chahkar in the early morning {subh in Persian and Baluchi); hence their name. .BAL—BAL S 3 6. Kurts or Kurds— In Baluchi “ Kurt Kanagh,” or “ Kurd Kanagh,” means ‘ to play the coward ” or “ to show the white feather ” in battle. These people fled from Mir Chahkar’s standard in the night. 1 1 The phrase generally used in Baluchi is “ Baghabitha,” meaning “he showed the white feather ” ; but both are used- These people are found in Makran and Kudbar. 7. Zan-o-Zenis, also called Zainuddims— The origin of the word is “ Zanagh ” the Baluchi for “ to know.” s ’ “ Zan na zane ” in Baluchi means “ Do you know or do you not ? ” They were doubtful at the time of starting, and would not give Mir Chahkar a direct answer to his question as to whether they had made up then minds to start with him or not. They are found around Bampur. 8. Shah Haggis —These derived their names from Shah Hagg, the father of Mir Chaahka, whose servants they were. They reside in Sarhad and are few in number As a rule they live with the Bamaris, but are of slave birth (ghulam zadeh) and not of noble birth (asl). 0. Nahruis— In Baluchi “ Druha ” means “ in good health ; ” and “ Nadruha” means “ ill.” The name is simply a corruption of Nadruha. Regarding the origin of the name, Lockhart, on the authority of Bottinger, states the name probably means low- lander, in contradistinction to the Brahuis or highlanders ; but the derivation of the name is but conjecture. They are found in Sistan Sarhad, Bampur, Chagai, and Mashkid. Head man (1909)—Saiyid Khan The tribe musters 800 armed men living in Rizabad Band and Kasandar. Although Baluch by origin, this tribe intermin&lt;ries with the Persians, and some of them are Shdahs. 10. DamanIs —These were followers of B;bl Bamaii, Mir Chabkar’s sister. At the time of departure as they were about to accompany him, BIbi Bamari spread out the skirt of her dress (“ daman ” in Persian and Baluchi means “ the skirts of a dress or mantle ”) and craved as a boon that her brother, who had bequeathed to her all the property he left behind, as well as a fort, still known as “ BibI Bamari’s kaleh ” in the neighbourhood of Bampur, would be pleased to leave this section behind with her. He consented, and they have ever since been known as Damanis. It may be remarked that it is an old Baluch custom, if a woman wishes to prefer an urgent petition to the sarddr or hakim, she spreads out the skirt of her mantle before him and the request, as a rule, is granted. Frequently an attack by one tribe on another is prevented, or a bloody battle sum marily stopped by mutual consent, owing to the women of both sides spreading out the skirts of their mantles before the would-be combatants. These people are found in Sarhad and near Bampur. A further account of this tribe will be found under Sarhad. 11. PuRkiS—The origin of this tribe, who reside in Bampusht only, is unknown. The correct word is “Pirki” from “ Pir,” meaning grandfather, and “ ki, ” who, “—literally, “ Who is your grandfather ? ” Mir Chahkar, accompanied by all his followers, with their wives, families and cattle excepting the eleven abovementioned sections, left the neighbourhood of Bampur and invaded Kachhi, which he conquered and repopulated. He is also said to have fought a battle with the king of Delhi, the legend being as follows :— A nephew of Mir Chahkar’s, a son of his sister BibI Bamari, having quarrelled with his uncle, left the latter and went to Delhi, where, owing to his illustrious descent also to the fact that he was remarkably handsome and a good swordsman and rider he was well received, and given a post at court befitting his rank and acquirements This youth possessed a wonderfully beautiful wife, whom he took with him to Delhi The fame of this woman’s beauty reached the ears of the king’s son, who without ever having seen her became enamoured of her, and determined to possess her In conjunction with the Vazir (prime minister) he contrived that MIf Chahkar’s nephew should be despatched on some important mission from Delhi; and during his absence he caused his lovely wife to be seized and conveyed to his harem. 61 I.B. EBAL—BAL 34 Mir ChahWar’s nephew having accomplished satisfactorily the objects of his mission was returning, highly elated, with all speed, to Delhi, when he was informed by some faVira of what had occurred. Highly incensed as he was, he feigned acquiescence, but, watching for his opportunity, he succeeded in murdering both the king’s son and his own wife during the night; he then left Delhi and rejoined Mir Chahkar. On the king hearing of the murder of his son, he despatched an army to Kachhi and •demanded that Mir C..ahkar should send him back one of his nephew’s arms. This demand being refused, a battle ensued, and Mir Chahkar’s army was defeated. A second battle, however, soon followed, in which the army of the king of Delhi was defeated and pursued almost to the walls of Delhi, where a permanent peace was concluded. Some of Mir Chahkar’s army returned to Kachhi, but many remained in the Pun jab, Sind, and other places. 12 . Tattqis— The branches of this tribe are :— Isma’iDai. Kamarzai. Sanjaranl. Muhammadani. This is a Brahui tribe, and was formerly called Tauqi Brahuis. Traditions differ as regards the derivation of the word “ Tauqi.” One story is: In ancient time the monarch of Khorasan killed the chieftain of this tribe, and his preg nant widow came before him and craved mercy for her child about to be bom. The monarch put a golden necklace {tanq) round her neck and granted her request. On a son being born to her she called him Tauqi, and his descendants are the present “ Tauqis.” Another story is : The origin of this tribe being unknown, they were called “ Tau- kis,” a corruption of the Baluchi expression “ Tau kaie ” meaning “who are you.” 13 . Rinds— A tribe of Makran, who claim to be of Arab origin and to have come from Aleppo, but are to all intents and purposes Baluchis. Their head-quarters are in Mand, about eighty miles north of Gwadar and a short distance east of the Persian frontier, but a few are found scattered throughout the districts of Persian Makran. Their fightingstrength is estimated at 1,500 men. The majority of the Rinds ordinar ly follow peaceful pursuits, but the headmen exercise little influence over individuals, and the tribe is consequently prone to misbehaviour and difficult to control. The Rinds hardly fall within the scope of this Gazetteer but for their connection with Gwadar, in the neighbour hood of which they have sometimes given trouble by raiding. In recent years, however, they have conducted themselves peaceably and have taken to cultivation, of which their country, which is open, is not incapable. 14 Dehwars. —A tribe of Rind Baluchis. The inhabitants of Bampusht, Kuhak, Isfandak, Dehak, Dizak, Sib, Magas, Bampur, and Jalk are, with a few insignificant ex ceptions, a part of the great horde of Rinds who emigrated through Persia and settled in Dalgan and the surrounding country, and thence spread over into Baluchistan. From here again, a few years afterwards, another part of this horde, under the leader ship of Rustam Khan Chakar, emigrated and settled at the foot of the Kalat plateau on the east, in the Kachhi, and the hilly tracts to the north of it. Some of these migrated back to their former possessions, leaving a number of their tribe in the hills north-east of Kalat, in Shoran. This tribe is called the Dehwar and is to be found in the above- mentioned tract, as also about Dizak and in Siiran and Sib : south of the former is Wes tern Baluchistan. Although now considered a subject of Persia, the chief of the whole of the Dehwar clan, Sardar Qadir Bakhsh of Dizak, keeps up his relations with the representative of the Ahmadzais, who once owned the whole of the country inhabit ed by the Baluch tribes even up to Sarhad, and letters are said to pass between Sardar Qadir Bakhsh of Dizak and His Highness Khudad Khan, K.C.S.I., of Kalat, twice or three times during the year. One of his confidential servants stated that his master fully intends, if ever hard pressed by the Persians, to emigrate back to Shoran in Kalat territory, and seek the protection of the Khan of Kalat. Sardar Qadir Bakhsh is undoubtedly the mostBAL—BAL SB powerful chief in Western Baluchistan, as his clan is numerous and he personally is greatly respected for the rectitude and integrity of his private character. His influ ence is said to be always used for good, and at the last pacification of this country he used his interest to restore to Mahmud Khan of Isfandak, Shirdil Khan of Kalagkan, and Mahmud Khan of Sib, their villages and property in the country. i t is also said that the revenue is first collected by Qadir Bakhsh Khan and then made over to Dilavar Khan who, in turn, remits it to the Persian Governor in Bampur. Qadir Bakhsh is the only chief in this part of the country whom the Persians have not been able to oppress. He is said never to trust them and is too powerful for them to attempt to seize him openly. It is said that the fighting strength of the Western Dehwar elan is 3,000 men, when all the tribes contribute their quotas. In three or four days it is estimated that 1,009 men can be assembled if necessary from those tribes within easy reach of Dizak. The Western Dehwars are divided into the following tribes ;— (1) Bahorzai. In Suran. (2) Dashtki. In Dizak. (3) Dekhani. In Sib. (4) Haibazai. In Suran. (5) Haligdazai. (6) Hetki. • (7) Khan Karram Shahi. In Suran. (8) Khan Maliki Shahi. In Suran. (9) Kalpur Kani. In Kalpurkan. (10) Kulwi. (U) Mandozai Shahi. In Suran. (12) Mustafazai. (13) Nagani. In Kalagkan. (14) Rahim Dazai. (15) Samzai. (16) Sardar. In Dizak. (Tribe of Qadir Bakhsh, Chief of the Dehwars.) (17) Shahzadeh. In Dizak.— {Tate.) For further Information regarding the Baliich tribes, set article on Baluchis in the Baluchistan Gazetteer .— Jennings, 1885; Hogg, 1909. BALUCHISTAN, PERSIAN. Persian Baluchistan is the generally accepted nomenelature of a huger- , tract of thinly-populated country lying along Geography ^ ^ p ersia / with British territory. Its greatest length, from Gwatar on the south to Kuh-i-Malik Siah on the north, is roughly 350 miles; and its breadth, from &lt; Kuhak on the east to near Kalanzau on the west, is about 250 miles. Its southern boundary is the coast-line from about where the Karvan river joins the sea (Bashakard lyiing to the west,—the actual division? between the two not being clear) to a point in Gwatar Bay (Long. 61* 29' E.). Thence the eastern boundary runs north and east along thfca watershed of the various ranges of hills to Kuhak, as laid down by^ Goldsmid’s Mission in 1871 ; then turning west along the main watershed of the Si han range, it passes between Talk and Ladgasht, and, following the course of the Talab river as far as Mirjawa, it branches off from there over the highest point of the Kacha Kuh to Kuh-i-Malik Siah,,. The western boundary runs from this latter place in a south-westerly direction and, leaving Kuh-i-Bazman to the east of the line, cuts through €hIl-:-Nadir, and from thence passing Ramishk on the east and Ispand E 2236 BAL—BAL on the west, joins the Persian Gulf, in the vicinity of the mouth of the Karvan river. (The eastern border has at times been the subject of considerable dispute between the British and Persian Governments, for some particulars of which vide Kuhak and Mirjawa.) The principal harbours along the coast-line are Gwatar, Chahbar, and Tiz, which are described under their own headings. Besides these there are several small bays and indentations, which are only used by the fishermen and smugglers. Generally speaking, Persian Baluchistan is a very mountainous region with ranges rising up to close on 13,000 feet in height. Starting northwards from the coast, for the first 20 or 30 miles, the country is comparatively flat and interspersed with minor hills, until the Lashar range is reached, with its eastern continuation of the Bampusht mountains, the average height of their watersheds being about 5,500 feet. South of this range all the water drains to the sea, through the Nihing, Sarbaz, Kaju, Geh, and Rapch rivers ; while north of it, it is either absorbed in'the Jaz Murian Hamun through the Bampur river, or in the Mashkid Hamun through the Mashkid and Talab rivers, none of it * reaching the sea. North of the Bampfir valley lie the highlands of Sarhad, where the ranges have a general northerly and southerly trend, culminating in the Kuh-i- Taftan (12,681 feet) about the centre. To the west is the low-lying Kirman desert, and to the east British Baluchistan. With the exception of the rivers mentioned above, there are none of any importance ; no navigation is possible on them, and only after heavy rain do they possess any considerable volume of water. Usually they are ford able almost everywhere, and in the hot weather they nearly dry up, so that the main kdfileh routes run along their course. Properly speaking, there are no lakes in Persian Balfichistan. The northern drainage of the Lashar hills and that of the Bampur river, with its tributaries, runs into the Jaz Murian Hamun, which also receives the Halil Rud and other minor streams. This Jidmun, though of considerable extent during the rainy season, almost dries up during the summer months, all its water being lost by evaporation. To the west of Vasht is another small hdmun of no importance, the Chah-i-Gabi Hamun, which is similarly generally dry. The Mashkid Hamfin in British territory absorbs the Mashkid, Talab, Kalaghan and Jalk rivers. The other numerous watercourses and ndlds with which the country is cover ed seldom have any running water in them, though it can, in most places, be found by digging in their beds, the water level being about 4 feet below the surface. Administration. Persian Baluchistan is divided into four administrative districts— (1) Makran reaching from the sea up to the watershed of the Lashar range, with Bashakard on the west, and Saravan on the east. (2) Bampfir, north of the Lashar range, with Sarhad on its north, ^aravan on its east, and K'rman on its westt(3) Saravan or Dizak, with Bamphr on its west, Sarhad on its north, and the boundaries between British and Persian territories on its east and south. 5 (4) Sarhad, with Bampiir and Saravan on its south, the Kirman desert on its west, and British Baluchistan on its east. The divisions between these districts are ill-defined and shadowy, so that it is quite impossible to lay them down with any degree of accuracy. They are again divided into sub-districts, as shown in the annexed table; but it must be remembered that the revenues shown against each vary from year to year, and frequently can only be collected by force of arms.t BAL-BAL 39 &lt;w for r -l'&amp;. 4^,000, so tlio ew t&gt;ovo •will givo so ixjlo icle£», of fclxo profits reixlizod. The whole province is under a Deputy Governor, or Sartip, who resides at Bampur and is subordinate to the Govern or-General at Kirman, but his authority over his charge is a very feeble one, so that it can be said with much truth that each sub-district is more or less independent ; and this is especially the case in Sarhad and Dizak. The Persian authorities seem to confine most of their energies to collecting taxes, which increase in severity from year to year, so that many formerly flourishing areas have now gone out of cultivation and the inhabitants take to the hills at the mere rumour of the approach of a Persian official. Under the Deputy-Governor of Bampur is the Sardar of Geh, who is nominally responsible for the administration of Makran ; the Sardar of Dizak, who is in charge of Sarawan ; and a representative at Vasht, who supervises Sarhad. But, as mentioned before, their authority is slight, and the taxes can be collected only by a show of force, and—at times—after much hard fighting. (For a further description of these districts, see the article under each separate heading.) The Persian Customs, under Belgian supervision, have established posts along the eastern frontier at the following places :— Customs House Frontier Posts. No. Name.

Sir H. Pottinger assigns them a Turkoman origin, but Professor Rawlinson affirms that the word “Baluch”is derived from Belus, King of Babylon, who is identified with Nimrod, the son of Cush, of Holy Writ. These two names are reproduced in Baluch and Kuch, and indicate the origin of the nomenclature of the Keeh or Kej valley, and perhaps also of Kach.40 CAL—BAL The Shah Ndmeh of Firdusi mentions the Baluchis as a tribe occupying Gilan during the reign of Naushirvan (about A.D. 600), and apparently they migrated to Baluchistan via Sistan. They are thus in all probability an Aryan race of ’Arab descent, now intermixed with Persian blood, and in habiting the same district are the Brahuis, of Dravidian origin, who must have come from the plains of Mesopotamia in pre-historic times. Besides these, there is a medley of tribes of different nationalities who have settled in the country at various dates, from ancient down to modern times. For instance, the Gichki are the descendants of a Rajput family who came from India in the seventeenth century; the Bolidit are ’Arabs from Masqat ; the Maliks are descendants of the Saffar dynasty; the Naushirvanis were driven out of Isfahan; the Bezanju are a branch of the aboriginal Brahui; the Shahzadehs claim descent from the princes of Kandahar ; the Rais are the descendants of the Ghazz family ; the Meds were pirates; the Darzadehs serfs ; the Luris gypsies; while the Wardilis immigrated from Sind. Many of these now live a settled life, others are but nomads, as is shown in the following table, which was tabulated in 1903 {see also Article “ Baluchis ”).BAL—£AL 43 The Baluchi language belongs to the Iranian branch of the Aryan family, while the Brahui is akin to Tamil. Persian in various dialects is also largely spoken, while along the coast, and up the Sarbaz valley in Makran, Urdu is commonly understood. No accurate estimate of the numbers ofthe population of Persian Baluchis tan has yet been given. A Russian traveller, Rittich, who traversed the country in 1900, says it is between 26,000 and 28,000 families, or, at 5 persons fer family, 130,000 to 140,000 souls. Colonel Showers in 1902 gave an estimate of 11,000 fighting men in the four districts. Besides these two authorities there are no data to go on, except that the population of Sarhad in 1900 was calculated to be 8,000 families, say 40,000 people, chiefly nomads. Owing to the immense extent of country covered by this province, Cfimate the climatic conditions are most varied, and it is impossible to generalise on the subject, as each locality differs very much from even its closest neighbour. It will be sufficient to say that the coast district of Makran is extremely hot and trying, steamy and unhealthy, while the further north and higher one goes, the cooler and healthier it becomes. The valleys of the Bampur division are stifling in the summer months, while Bampur itself is notorious for its unhealthiness. Among the highlands of Sarhad, how ever, different conditions prevail, and on the slopes of Kuh-i-Taftan are spots which might make good hill stations, but the question of supplies would be a very difficult one. The air is dry and bracing, and in the winter snow and ice are not uncommon ; in fact heavy snowstorms have been recorded at Bampur in February. Among the mountains the four seasons prevail, but towards the south, two only—the cold and the hot. Agriculture as a whole is in a backward state, as the inhabitants only Resources. cultivate sufficient cereals for their own wants and frequently, owing to the exactions of the Persian officials, and the deficiency of water, not even that: crops, however, of wheat, barley, sugar, rice, cotton, indigo, etc., are almost everywhere met with in small quantities, and there is no doubt that under an efficient system of administration their output could be largely increased. The Bampur district especially is capable of producing great quantities of grain, and even now it exports to Chahbar wool, cotton, dates, ghi and grain, where they are bartered for piece-goods, iron, powder, etc. Taking it all round, however, the country is poor and agriculture is subservient to cattle-breeding. The nomads of Sarhad own 1 arge flocks of sheep and goats, and in the Ladis district alone they are said to aggregate 20,000 head, but information about the number in the whole district is not forthcoming. Transport is mainly conduct ed by means of camels, of which a great but undefined number is avail able in the province—donkeys also are almost universal as beasts of burden, every householder owning one or more. There are no vehicles, as the roads, with few exceptions, are unfit for wheeled traffic. There are no made roads in Persian Baluchistan, and the communica- Communications. tions shown in such prolusion m the Route u . -Book are for the most part but tracks 1 suitable on y or pac v transport, along which supplies for men and animals, as we F2u BAL—BAL . „ flrp scan ty in the extreme.

(For further particulars of these routes, vide Route Book, section I.) The Indo-European telegraph line passes along the southern coast of A. i in with offices at Gwatar and Chahbar, before continuing into ShltoX wherelt takes to the sea at Jashk. There is no internal of turbulence and unrest which has been Uwing chronic in Persian Baluchistan for centuries, Military. the whole country bristles with all sorts and nations of forts, almost every hamlet and village possessing one. Though one naturally varies from another, they have certain general characteristics in common, which may be worth describing. All are built of mud, usually on an eminence, and are rectangular in shane with well-arranged flank defences provided by towers and bastions. In the centre is the citadel, rising to 40 or 50 feet m height, nml divided into two portions, connected by covered ways. Its plinth is and div hal{ . tg he . ght with solld eart i l5 an d has a well sunkright though the mound on which the fort is built. The walls of the citadel vary from5 to 10 feet iu thickness, and the entrance to it is always un a Steep narrow passage, admitting the approach of only one person »t a time Against the perimeter of the outer wall are constructed the Lus“ of the village, frequently arranged in tiers prepared for defence, and surrounded by another loopholed wall, with flank defences. Loonholed battlements. 2 feet thick and 5 feet high, fringe the outer dee of the walls and machicouli galleries are also frequently provided. The 6 loopholes are Visually badly planned, and the field of fire from them ^ThlLtetetmcommouly built ou the edge of a grove near a Briz, and have a Clear field of fire for about 100 yards The approaches to them are easv enough., as the date groves afford good cover. Mountain guns are useless against the majority of these forts ; and all Mounta n guns demolish the battlements of the towers, and they could do would be^tode o^ ^ enemy , s fire; while a charge of assist the infan y lod led^in a suitable spot in order to blow it up. g Xtrtirsteeng^h ofTerln Baluchistfn was estimated, in 1902 at 11 000 men with some 400 breech-loading rifles. This latter is probably very much below the actual figure, as it is known that large quantities of riftes are smuggled over from Masqat in increasing numbers year by year. Maior Tiahe !n 1902 noticed that in the Sarbaz valley every man was well frmed &lt;Sher with a Martini or a Lee-Speed Magazine rifle The price of”ne of the former, plus 100 cartridges, varied from Rs. 45 to Ks W- The probability is that there is one rifle to every five men, or some 2,000 rifles in all.In 1902 a small British force under Major Tighe co-operated with the Persian troops in trying to suppress the most notorious of the border raiders and in doing so traversed a large extent of hitherto unexplored country. Landing at Gwadar they marched to Magas, via Turbat, Pishin, Sarbaz and Irafshan ; and from thence one party proceeded to Panjgur, one to Mirjawa via Vasht, and a third to MIrjawa via Jalk. They encountered at various times opposition from the outlaws, who mostly defended them selves in their forts ; but it is not thought likely that in future they will trust to them again, when opposed to British troops with guns. In all probability they will wage a guerilla warfare among the hills and defiles, and, unless the further importation of arms and ammunition is sternly suppressed, they may be a very formidable foe to meet under such condi tions. The transport difficulties of this expedition were considerable. The camels were always breaking down, and constant relays of fresh animals had to be arranged for. It is not possible to give the actual wastage in transport, but it may be mentioned that out of 800 camels about 90 died in less than a month, and 50 per cent, of the remainder were unfit for work. They had to be supplemented by donkeys as far as possible. The wastage of men and the expenditure of ammunition were incon siderable—22 of the former out of some 500, and 2,000 rounds of the latter, during the six months’ operations. Since 1902 the country has been in a state of chaos, and no revenue has been paid to the Persian Government since the time of the Makran expedi tion.50 BAL—BAL The early history of Baluchistan is shrouded in mystery. All that; is known is that its aboriginal population, History. Dravidians (represented by the Brahuis of to-day), at times paid tribute to the Shah of Persia, and that the country was traversed from east to west by the forces of Alexander the Great on his return from India. It was then lost sight of foi’ hundreds of years. In the Shah Ndmeh, Ardeshir {circ. A.D. 220) is mentioned as attacking Gilan, and a few centuries later Bahram Gur of the Sasanian dynasty march ed through the country to India, while Naushirvan had to inflict severe punishment on the inhabitants for their raids. About the commencement of the Muhammadan era, Chack, almost the last Hindu king of Sind, marched through Makran to the river boundary between it and Kirman, and set up a monument there to mark the limits of his kingdom. In the early years of the Hijra both Kirman and Baluchistan were con quered by the Arab invaders, and subsequent to A. H. 89 (A.D. 707) Muhammadan supremacy was extended as far as the Indus valley. The Saffar dynasty held Baluchistan for many centuries till Khalaf was cap tured by Mahmud of Ghazni (oirc. A.H. 295, A.D. 907). The Del ami dynasty appear to have held Baluchistan about A.D. 1080, while it seems to have been ruled from Ki 'man by the Seljuks during the reign of Toghrul Shah (A.D. 1156-1167), as we read that at that date Makran paid duty on silk alone up to 30,000 dinars , or 15,000 Napoleons, ^ annum. At the close of the twelfth century, Tiz is mentioned as a flourishing port, with a great import and export trade, and Makran was famous for its candy and sugar. In A.H. 620 (A.D. 1223), after the destruction of Herat, Makran was laid waste by Chagatai, one of the Generals of Chengiz Khan. At the end of the thirteenth century, Marco Polo sailed past its coast, and gives a short description of the country. At the end of the fifteenth century and early in the sixteenth, there was a great migration of Baluchis eastwards from Makran into the Punjab, due probably to Mongol pressure. About A.D. 1620 Baluchistan again became independent of Persia, under Malik Mirza. In the middle of the seventeenth century the Brahuis, under Kambar, rose to power, but later his descend ants were forced to acknowledge Afghan suzerainty. About A.D. 1737, a Persian force marched by way of Jiruft towards Bampur, and met the Baluch Army at Chil i-Nadir,, inflicting a severe defeat on it with a loss of 700 men. Bampur successfully held out, but after the capture of Fahraj, Lashar, Tiz, and several of the forts in the Jalk oasis, Amir Mahabbat was installed as Persian Governor of Baluchistan at Qasrqand.. About A.D. 1736 a force sent by Nadir defeated the nomads of Kharan, but after ms death a period of anarchy ensued, and in 1810, when Pottinger crossed the district what is now known as Persian Baluchistan was independent of Persia under Shah Mehrab Khan of Fehruj. In 1839 Baluchistan appears to have been divided up into various chieftainships, each at war with, and independent of, the other, of whom Muhammad ’ Ali Khan, at Bampur, was the most powerful. _ a j- Aim i After the flight of Agha Khan to India, his brother, Sardar Abdul Hashan, in 1844 marched through Makran to Chahbar, and gained pos session of Bampur, where in 1845 he was besieged by the Persians, andfinally captured and sent to Tehran, being kept a prisoner there and kindly treated till the day of his death. After a few more attempts at independence by the Agha Khan’s party, it remained for Ibrahim Khan, son of a baker at Bam, to achieve the permanent subjugation of Persian Baluchistan, and, though his methods were harsh and crnel, he had suc ceeded, by 1872, in reducing one of the most turbulent countries in Asia to a state of order and tranquility. . In 1881 the Brahuis of the Afghan Garmsir raided across the But to the gates of Tehran, carrying off a quantity of camels and other property from Yaramin : on their return journey they defeated and captured, near Shurgaz, the camp of the Sa’d-ud‘Dauleh, who subsequently massacred one of their caravans near Jalk. In 1888 the then Governor Abdul Path Khan conducted a successful campaign against the Yarahmadzai of Sarhad, in which the Kurds observed a strict neutrality. As a punishment for this, their women and property were treacherously seized by ’Abdul Path Khan, upon which the Baluchis rose and besieged Fehruj, but they were defeated and the Kurds subsequently all executed, while in 1899 the recalcitrant Baluchi chiefs were seized and imprisoned. In 1896 the Perso-Baluch Commission effected the delimitation of the frontier ; but following on the assassination of the Shah of Persia, the Baluchis rose and attacked the Governor-General near Sib, and were defeated. In 1897 again there was a rising, and Fehruj desultorily besieged, but nothing resulted. At the end of 1897 Mr. Graves of the Indo-European Telegraphs was murdered on the Rapch river, as a consequence of which the Karvan expedition was organized against the malcontents, but since the spring of 1898 the province has been pacified and no events of any great import ance have taken place. In 1902, however, owing to the lawlessness of the border tribes and their constant incursions into British territory, a small force under Major Tighe, as escort to the Political Officer, Major Showers, marched through Makran and Sarhad; and, in conjunction with Persian troops, captured and destroyed among others the forts of Magas, irafshan, Afshar, and Ashan, and drove the principal outlaws from the country. About the same time a dispute arose between the Persian and British Governments with regard to the ownership of Mirjawa {q.v.), but it was settled amicably in 1905, and the border from there to Kuh-i-Malik Siah left undisturbed.—(/ewwmg's, 1885 ; Rittich, 1900 ; Holdich, 1901 ; Sykes, 1902 ; Showers, 1902 ; Tighe, 1902 \ Hogg, 1909.)

During the dry weather Rimdan, 7 miles off, has to obtain its water from this place.— (Janes, 1900.) BAM— Elev. 3,605'; 3,500'— (S*. John ); Lat. 29° 35' ; Long. 58° 20 '. A town in the Bam district of Kirman, about 120 miles south-east of Kirman and 180 miles north-east of Bandar Abbas. It is situated about 8 miles from the edge of the Lut, and is the chief town of the large and fertile district of Bam-Naimashir. The city of Bam was founded by Bahman, and, situated as it is on the frontier of Persia proper, has always been a place of much importance. It consists of the old and the new town, the former crowded within the wall that surrounds the fort, the latter scattered along both banks of the river, and liable probably to damage from floods in years of heavy snow-fall. Possessing a fertile soil and a climate suitable equally for palm trees and for many upland products, Bam is the centre of a wealthy district and con tains some 13,000 inhabitants and 3,000 houses. There are many gardens. Pomegranates are largely grown. The waier is good from Karizes. A cool north wind mitigates the summer heat, the mountain villages of the Jabal Bariz range are close at hand, and the importance of the place is enhanced by its being the last commercial town of note in this part of Asia until Quetta * is reached. 1 Caravan routes .—Bam is served by three main caravan tracks : One runs from Bandar Abbas via Jiruft—a good road, but troubled at times, mostly in the spring, by Bashakardi nomads. Caravans using this road take from 15 to 20 days for the journey, the cost of carriage ranging from? to 12 tumans per Marwar of 100 maunds Tabriz ( 6 | lbs.). The other two roads run from Kirman to Bam, one via Nabld, the other via Rayin. These roads bifurcate a day’s march out of Kirman at Mahun, and re-unite a day’s march out of Bam, at Darzin. The telegraph has been laid along the Nabid road, which is the shorter by some 15 miles, and it is used by the post and the majority of Jcdfilehs. The road is quite a good one for Persia. There are some wide rivers to cross, which would be very awkward in time of flood, and in places water is scarce, at others salt, but there are no narrow defiles or high passes. Robberies sometimes take place. The cost of carriage between Kirman and Bam, about 120 miles, varies from 3 to 5 tumdns, and caravans take from 7 to 8 days to do the journey. There are other tracks connecting Bam and various villages in the hills and desert, but they are not much used. * The distance is somewhat less than 7u0 miles.The great caravan track from Herat, Khorasan and SIstan to Bandar Abbas passes within 3 days’ march to the eastward of Bam. This bifurcates near Mil-i-Farhad to the south of RigSn, the main track running through the Rudbar district, and thence via Minab, to Bandar Abbas. The other branch lies north and west of this, going by way of a pass, termed the Nawargu, and across the district of Rudin. Th? choice of tracks is determined partly by the water-supplies, and partly by the likelihood of meeting brigands. There are also alternative routes from Bam across the Lut, viz., that via Fehruj to Gurg and that via Rigan to Gurg. There are two telegraph houses, one English, and one Persian. BAM— A region in south-east Persia, forming part of the administrative district of Bam-Narmashir (q.v.). From Bandar Abbas caravans take— To Sistan 60 days. To Meshed 80 days. Cost of carriage— SisfAn 15 tumdns per icharwdr. Meshed 20 to 30 tumdns per Jcharwdr. The people of Bam and its neighbourhood are very much better off than those of other parts of the province, while the merchants, especially the Parsis, are more keen-witted and energetic than the Kirman traders. Bam, although nearer to Bandar Abbas than Kirman, is chiefly supplied through Kirman, but were the road from Bandar Abbas to Bam through Bruit properly secured against the Bashakard brigands, it is probable that much of tbe Bandar Abbas-Kirman traffic would come round by this way. Commercial products. —Wool, cotton, gums, and dye-stuffs are produced in the district cotton especially could be raised in large quantities, and the export of wool might be greatly increased. But the principal wealth of Bam consists in henna, and from here practically the whole of Persia is sup plied with this commodity. The dried leaves and stems of the plant are brought in from the villages in bundles, and sent to Yazd to be ground. (For further information regarding exports and imports, see Bam-Narmashir.) The great mud fort of Bam is celebrated in the history of the province. Sykes thus describes it:—“We visited the famous fort by special invita tion, and found that the old town was still standing, the whole being surrounded by a high wall and ditch. We passed through the deserted bazaars for some 600 yards, the fort occupying the northern end of the enclosure, and, ascending a steep incline in the rock, which has never been smoothed, we passed through a strong gateway and a 40-foot wall, which is built of sun-dried bricks, as indeed is the whole fortress. “ We then found ourselves facing a second and equally high wall, some 20 yards up the hillside, and, turning sharply to the left, approached the second gateway, a square surrounded by stables being below us as we moved along. “ A second equally steep incline, leading up to a similar gateway, brought us to the artillery park, where we saw some muzzle-loading field-guns54 BAM—BAM mounted on unserviceable carriages ; the date of one, I remember, was A.H. 1254 (1838). A third and steeper passage led up from this square to a plat* form, on which is a well, which we calculated to be some 180 feet deep; it is alleged to have been dug by Rustam, under orders of King Solom on! It now only supplies the water for a bath. A short flight of steps, and we reached the summit of a fort, a CheJtdr Fasl or Four Seasons, evidently constituting the Governor’s quarters. From the roof of this building we enjoyed a wonderfully beautiful view. Looking back, Kuh-i-Hazar with its mantle of freshly fallen snow rivetted our gaze, and on each side of the valley, the hills showed up against the turquoise sky, the Shah Savaran range form ing another vision of beauty. Below us lay the date-groves of Bam, and we could trace its river to the north-east; we also indistinctly saw the greenery of Narmashir. Far away, Bazman, loveliest of peaks, rose grandly in solitary state, and we could not decide which was the finer of the two great giants. Bazman, however, rears its head some 9,000 feet above the plain, whereas Hazar, albeit loftier, rises but 7,000 feet above Rayin, and is surrounded by other, if lesser, peaks ” Bam and Narmashir between them maintain a regiment of infantry, half of which garrisons Baluchistan, while 100 men are supposed to occupy Bam fort, but these latter were conspicuous by their absence when New comen visited the place in 1905. In modern times Bam was the scene of the tragedy which culminated the Kajar-Zand struggle, when Lutf ’All Khan, who had fled from Kirman, was basely surrendered to his hereditary foe by its Governor, to whose hospitality he had entrusted himself. Yet once again in the middle of the nineteenth century, Bam was besieged by a mixed force of Afghans and Sistanis. When the ammunition was all expended and no hope remained, the women of Bam, headed by Banu Husain Fatheh, heated cauldrons of water, and gave the assailants such a warm reception that the city held out until help came from Kirman. A few years later Agha Khan seized the fort and was blockaded therein for the best part of a year, until sickness broke out and he was forced to retreat to India. After this, the erection of the modern town was com menced. In the town several wealthy families reside, chief of whom is the Shaukat-ul-Mamalik, son of Sulaiman Khan, who thirty years ago was in charge of Sir Frederick Goldsmid s escort. Is ext in importance, and related to him, is the As'ad-ud-Dauleh, son of the late As’ad-ud-Dauleh, who governed Baluchistan intermittently for many years.— (Sykes, 1902 ; Dobbs, 1902 ; Newcomen, 1905.) bamarIs— The name of a Baluch tribe inhabiting Sarhad (see article on latter). BAM BALA, see Bampur. BAM-NARMASHlR— A district of Kirman situated in the south-east corner of the province. It is, as its name implies, really composed of two districts, viz., Bam and Naimashir, but both are under one ruler and are usually included together.Bam-Narmashlr is about 100 miles in length and varies from 35 to 80 miles in breadth. It is bounded on the north and east by the desert of the Lut. To the south-east is Bampur ; to the south the Kuh-i-Shah- Savaran, a continuation of the Jabal Bariz range, separates it from Rudbar while on the west lie Sarduleh and Rayin. There is a considerable difference between the elevations of Bam and Nar- mashir, the former being about 3,500 feet above sea-level, while the latter slopes gradually from about 2,700 feet at its northern extremity to about 2,200 feet south of Rigan. There is a corresponding difference in tempera ture, Narmashir being on the whole much warmer than Bam. The popula tion is about 50,000, and the revenue 13,000 tumdns. The district has from early times been of note in Persia and was desig nated 'Arba, or Four, from its four cities of Bam, Rigan, Narmashir, and Nisa. Of these Bam and Rigan were founded by Bahman, while Ardesbir built Narmashir, and his wife constructed the dam on which Nisa depended. The ancient dam has long since disappeared, but the present one, com posed of stones and branches of tamarisk, diverts part of the river which flows down the Narmashir valley from its natural course towards the ancient city of Nisa. The stream is at present diverted in three places by temporary dams at intervals of 15 or 16 miles, and the water conveyed where wanted by cuts leading from the dams, but no attempt has been made to con serve the excess of water in tanks and reservoirs, to the construction of which the surrounding country is peculiarly adapted, and by means of which (in the opinion of Newcomen, who visted the place in 1905) a supply of water could be secured, amply sufficient for the requirements of the whole valley. The country, owing to its proximity to the frontier, has always been subject to attack by the Afghans and Baluchis, of whom the former were not finally expelled until well on in the nineteenth century, and this has con siderably retarded prosperity. With an improved administration and increased and better irrigation, the district, already one of the most flourish ing in Persia, would be capable of immense development. Agriculture—The lands in Bam-Narmashir are mostly in the hands of a few Khans, who have very extensive holdings which they look after themselves, the villagers being for the most part their labourers. There are, however, certain government or khalsa lands, mostly used for rice growing, and a small amount of raiatvari. The region is well watered, drawing its supplies both from open irrigation channels and from qandts. In dry years the streams often fail, but the qandt supplies may be depended on so long as the tunnels are kept clean. Agricultural implements are primitive. A very light and weak plough, something like that used in the Kumaon Himalayas, and a very long handled narrow spade, are those chiefly used. These are supplemented by a wooden harrow and an instrument for loosening the spade-worked soil, somewhat resembling a dining fork and also made of wood. Some very striking earth formations are noticeable in Narmashir, which at first sight have the appearance of a city in ruins with walls, gates, and bastions, but which on closer inspection turn out to be masses of kanJcar and „sand, worn into the fantastic shapes by the action of water. Game is abundant—wild fowl, black partridge, and wild pig especially being found in large numbers.56 BAM—BAM Exports and imports. —The following are the products and the principal imports of the district :— Cotton, raw, sown March—April, picked October—November. Crop 100.000 mans (Tab.), yielding 30,000 mans cleaned cotton. Price on the spot 37 to 38 tumdns per kharwdr cleaned. This has so far been all used at home, but in 1904 a trial shipment of 3,000 mans was sent to Bombay. Cotton, manufactured. —A coarse cloth called “ Garah ” is manufactured and sold at £ krdn a yard. Some 800,000 yards of this are produced a year, about 3,000 women being employed for six months in spinning and weaving. Wool, raw. —About 10,000 mans (Tab.), half of which is fine wool or kurk, are produced in the Bam district yearly and handled by the merchants^ who buy in small quantities from the herdsmen and farmers; some lots of the best are, however, sent in by Khans frqm their estates. This wool is all exported to Kirman, Yazd, Kum, and Isfahan, where it realizes from 8 to 14 krdns a man for fine, and from 4 to 8 for coarse wool. The wool is nearly all used in the manufacture of carpets, and none is exported to India* The quality is said to be very good. Henna. —This is the chief product of the district, which produces some 500.000 mans annually; about of this goes to Yazd and Kirman, where it is ground at the rate of \\ krdns per man and distributed to the chief towns in Persia. The remaining £ is treated locally, part being used locally and part finding its way into Baluchistan and Afghanistan. Price on spot, unground, 2 to 2£ krdnsjpet man. Ditto, ground, 3 to 3f krdns ditto. Indigo. —The plant grown here is smaller and has finer leaves than the varieties grown in Behar and the United Provinces. It is locally known by the name “Parang. ” It is practically never treated for the extraction of the dye, but is ground in the same manner as henna and is mixed with it to form a paste for the dyeing of beards and hair, where black is preferred to red. Thirty thousand mans of leaf are produced, and nearly all is sent to Yazd and Kirman. Price on spot to 3 krdns per man. Lentils (moong). —Annual production 30,000 mans; 20,000 mans sent to Kirman and Baluchistan. Two tumdns per kharwdr. Barley and oats. —Production of both 3,000,000 mans, of which about 50.000 mans go to Bandar Abbas ; 600,000 to Kirman and other places. Price barley 4 tumdns per kharwdr ; oats 2 tumdns per kharwdr. Bates. —Fifty thousand mans a year. About 3,000 mans of the best go to Kirman, spot price 1 krdn for from 1^ to 2 mans. The people live largely on dates, and the local production is supplemented by about 15.000 mans brought in from Baluchistan. Rice. —Forty thousand mans produced; 10,000 mans go to Kirman. Price 2 to 3 krdns per man. Carraway seed. —Five thousand mans. All goes to Bandar Abbas for the Bombay market. Gum tragacinth. —There is plenty of this in the district. The plant producing it grows wild over all the hills and is in appearance like furze. In 1905 arrangements were being made to collect it.58 BAM—BAM f2,107 / — Grey, BAMPT)R— Lat 27° 11' 58'; Long. 60° 23'37' / ; Elev. 1906'—^. John, 11,750—1,920'.

From Jashk via Bint, Fanuch, and Maskhhtan. A track from the coast leads nearly north up the Rapch river and joins this about Bint. ( 2 ) From Chahbar by Geh and Lashar. (3) From Gwatar by Qasrqand. Probably a track from Cha ar by the Namak Kaur joins this in Baku Dashtian {q.v.), bu it has not been explored(4) A road from Gwadar via Pishm and Sarbaz. This is a better road than that via Qasrqand, but perhaps not so good on the whole as that through Geh, while it is longer. At Sarbaz it divides. The most direct track is via Ispatki, but it is difficult for heavily-laden camels. The roads join again at Kahiri. ( 5 ) From Chahbar by Qasrqand—a fair track fit for laden camels. The road from Kech and the interior of Makran joins the above at Pishin. The northward roads are :— (1) North-west to Bam, and thence via Khabis (east of Kirman) to Khorasan, or north-east to Sistan by the route followed by Goldsmid’s Mission in 1871. (2) Jennings’ route through Sarhad to Sistan via Karvanda. There are three roads to Bam, the most southerly was followed by the Sistan Mission, the middle one by Jennings and Sykes, and the northerly one by Pottinger. p n . Bampur is no longer the head-quarters of the district, since Pabhra rose to importance. The Governor and most of the troops are now quartered at the latter place, while in the former remains only a nominal garrison of 500 men. The elevation of Bampur may be taken as ranging between 1,500 and 2 000 feet, with a general average of about 1,900 feet ; that is 2,500 feet lower than the Magas valley, on the other side of the Ispidan Kuh, and 1,000 feet less than Bam-Narmashir. A large portion of the plain appears to be sand desert.* Heavy rolling sand ridges cover the south-eastern part of it extending up to the foot slopes of the hills. They lie at about right angles to the river and are about 20 feet high, and covered with tagaz and green vegetation. St. John describes these ridges as having been heaped up by the wind and attain ing occasionally to a height of 40 feet, the crests of these veritable billows varying in distance apart from 100 to 300 feet. * Goldsmid, who had had some experience, does not consider this a true desert. He says the sandhills are few and far between, and never succeed each other with the regularity of ocean waves, as between Bohri and Jesalmir. Floyer , however, travelling the same road to Bampur ten years later, at 15 miles from Maskhutan entered a sea of enormous hills of loose sands. Six miles further on he got “a view of the open country all sandhills.” However, Floyer does not consider the high sandhills stretch far to the west of the Maskhutan-Bamphr road. Where they cease, the so-called desert is nrobably a sandy plain with alluvial soil and gravel intermixed. It would be interest ing to learn how far this sandy desert stretches, probably not so far as St. John’s man would lead one to imagine. According_ to Floyer above quoted, the heavy sand ceases at about 38 miles from Qasimabad on the Fanuch road. From thence to Maskhutan (62 miles), both Goldsraid and Floyer agree that there is but little sand. From Maskhutan to the hills, which are entered at 14 miles (76 from Bampur), the plain is mostly of hard gravel and'stony , . . - 1 Q n roa d to Chahbar, through Lashar and Geh, the desert is of the same nature, but is crossed nearly at right angles. According to Grant, the heavy sand would appear to cease at 12 miles before reaching Isfakeh, that is,, at about 23 miles from the river and this may be taken as about the breadth of the.real desert.- For Beresford- Lovett’s description of the sand desert, east of the above road, along the foot of the hills, see article Surmich. H3€0 BAM—BAM 4 A sandy plain stretches along the whole south of the district, and the north-east part of the plain also appears to be sand. In the centre,, however, is a fertile and thickly wooded strip of country following the course of the Bampur river and other streams. The river is formed by a number of water-courses descending from the hills, enclosing the eastern angle of the plain, and runs westwards ; and the fertile belt, narrow at first, appears to increase in breadth towards the western part of the district. “ That part of Bampur valley,” says St. John, “ between the river and the mountains to the north, is intersected by numerous torrent beds and covered in most parts by mimosa and tamarisk jungle.” To the west the Kaskin river bounds this sea of sand waves; and due north of Deh Mir, they only extend a few miles towards the hills, the ground beyond being stony and hard and commencing to slope more rapidly. To , the north of the Bampur plain, among the volcanic ridges previously men. tioned, isthe lofty cone of the Mehzar Kuh—“ the misty ” or “ cloud pro ducing ” also called the Kuh-i-Bazman . It is the highest peak of the Baz- man range (&lt; 7 .^.), and is believed to be an extinct volcano 11,420 feet high. Its summit is covered with snow for a great part of the year and forms a striking and beautiful feature in the landscape from any part of the valley. The still higher Kuh-i-Taftan of Sarhadis not visible from any part of Bampur, on account, probably, of the intervening ranges and scarp of the Sarhad plateau. River .—The river rises from springs some 5 miles above Sar-i-Band (Abband or Mubarak-i-Band as it is styled), above which are some dry ndlds. It receives the Damin, Hamant, and Ahuran drainage, through the Karvanda, Kunarak, and Puachln rivers. The Kunarak Nala takes off a large amount of drainage from the Champ, Ispidan, Hamant, and other hills. The river is absorbed into the Bampur plain to the west of Kalanzau, some 9 farsakhs below Bampur. Except during heavy rains there is little water in it below Kuch Gardan, as it is all used up for irrigation purposes above this point. Sar-i-Band is a large dam of very primitive construction, on which depends all the irrigation of the culti vated tract between it and Bampur and even beyond. The river water has a gypsiferous taste, and is very unpalatable, being largely impregnated with this lime substance, which also, accounts for the efflorescent deposit (“shur”) all along the banks. It is generally ford able, but quicksands are found in some places. Bampur District is divided into the following sub-districts:— Sub-district. Revenue in 1902. Remarks.

The people of Bampur are of a mixed race, very inferior to the ordi nary Baluch, and showing strong traces of negro blood. Both Gold- smid and Gasteiger describe them as having very dark skins, curly hair, and the negro type of feature. The males are half-naked; the women and children dirty, dishevelled and ugly. They are rude and uncivilized in their habits. Their language appears to be Makrani Baluch, with a larger mix ture than usual of Persian. Floyer remarks that Persian is more spoken than Baluchi. The people live in rice straw huts, mostly along the river. There are about 200 huts on the north bank, where the road to Fanuch, etc., crosses the stream—a location probably preferable to that of the town near the fort. These people are practically slaves. The land belonging to Govern ment, they obtain but a bare subsistence in return for their toil, and a state of degradation is the natural consequence. Gasteiger says they are cap able of improvement, but their wretched condition cannot be bettered without a change in the system of administration. The people of Fehruj and Aptar—free Baluch peasants, tilling their own land—are much superior to the cultivators of Bampur proper.63 BAM—BAM Both banks. Left bank.

The climate of Bampur.is notoriously bad and a bye-word for unhealthi ness even in Baluchistan. The highly irrigated Climate. land along the river, and the burning sandy desert beyond it, give rise to sudden changes of temperature and altera tions from intense dryness to complete saturation which are most prejudi cial to health. During the five nights St. John remained at Bampur (April 2nd to 6th, 1872) the minimum of the thermometer was as follows 58°, 50°, 80°, 62°, 48°. The cold weather may be considered tolerably pleasant, though a considerable degree of heat may alternate with cold, surprisingly sharp, considering the comparatively low eleva tion (1,800 feet). Floyer in 1876 experienced severe cold, and on the 31st January was overtaken by a heavy snowstorm 5 miles south of Maskhutan (Maskotu). on the southern edge of the desert. The cold was intense, although the elevation of his camp could not have been greater than that of Bampur, and it was half a degree further south. It begins to get warm in February. Gasteiger noticed|that bean crops were ripe on the 20th February 1881, but it might have been an unusually early season. In March the climate usually becomes hot, and unhealthy at the same time; The whole of the hot weather is very unhealthy and un pleasant. Other recorded readings of temperature are as follows : 20th November 1893—2 p.m. 87° F. 28th May 1.900—6 a.m. 24° C.; noon 42° C. 25th July, 1906—2 p. m., 116° F. 26th „ „ —2 p.m., 112° F. , ,,, . The history of Bampur resembles in its general outline that o e * es of Persian Baluchistan. From the earliest JLstory. timeg it has teen tlie j&amp;ene of war and rapine, sometimes owing allegiance to one chief, sometimes to another, spersed with periods of independence. In'ISlO .t was ruM by Khah Mihrab Khan, one of the then most powerful chrefs in Ba'uchist , who was famous as a raider of his neighbours’ 't e £ rl ^ or ^ n r i r Seized by Suruir Khan, one of the followers of Agha Khan, head ol the *Khoja sect, and at one time Viceroy of Kirman. The Persians accord- ingly moved against the fort and captured it in 1845, from which time it has remained in their possession, the district being finally brought into subjection by the celebrated Governor Ibrahim Khan, who died in 1884. Since then, with the exception of a few minor risings and rebellions, the province has remained cpiiet and peaceful.

This district is situated to the north of the Kuh-i-Z&amp;miran^ and to the west of the Sagarkand. Its northern boundary is the Mashkid river flowing from Sarhad via DIzak and Isfandak to the desert , and its western boundary is the Chidigan Kaur. To the east lies the district of Panjgur, , In former days the district was governed by a race of chieftains who styled themselves Buzurgzadehs [not in any way connected with the Buzurgzadehs (Kurishi Saiyids), to which family Sardar Dilavar Khan of Hizak belongs]. These Buzurgzadehs are true Saiyids, and the rulmg chief for tfie time being took the title of “Malik.” At one period they likewise govern ed Bampur, (See History of that place.) Pottinger in 1810 states as follows regarding this family “ The original masters of these villages, etc., were Malikuh Balucbis, who have been nearly exterminated during their struggles with the But he has made a curious mistake in calling them “ Malikuh Baluchis.” Malik” is simply a title meaning “prince” or “lord,” which the Buzurgzadeh Saiyid rulers had assumed, . Pottinger likewise makes the mistake of confusing the Arbabis (q.v.) with the title of “Arbab” (plural of the Arabic word “Rabb;” meaning “ lord ”), the title assumed by the ruling chief of the Nahruis at or about the time the Buzurgzadeh rulers assumed the title of “ Malik After a period a family of Chakri Rinds, from Kolwa, near Pan]gur, succeeded these Saiyids in the chieftainship of Bampusht. The first Sardar of this family who became ruler of Bampusht was named Mir Ahmad. This was during Nadir Shah’s reign, and when Ni matulla I ruled at Pizak, and Mir ’Abdulla I at Jalk. (See account of ' From the period when the ChaM Rinds succeeded the Saiyids as chief tains of Bampusht, the latter been considered, as it is now, a su is trict of Dizak ; but in those days the whole district merely paid a nominal annual revenue of one camel, which was sent to the Hakim of as a “ nazr.” The present Sardar is Sahib Khan, who succeeded m 189 , The yearly revenue of Bampusht is about Rs. 600.

BAMPUSHT KtJH— A considerable range of hills in Persian Baluchistan, either within, or forming the southern boundary of, the district of the same name. (See above.) These hills, running east and west, are a continuation of the range which bounds Rakhshan and Panjgur (q.v.) on the south. They are united to the latter (eastwards) by the Mazampnsht Kuh. Sagarkand and Plm- piska {q.v.), all part of the same hills. To the west the range (no doubt here called by a different name) bends north-west, following the general run of the ranges in this part of the country, and appears to join the ele vated mass of the Isfidan Kuh, Humand, etc. The Bampusht range is of some importance in the general topography of the countrv. as from the Mazampusht Kuh westwards its crest is the water-shed between the basins of the Mashkid and the Nihing. It is also considered to form the boundary between Makran, in its geographical sense, and Dizak. It seems strange it should not have been made the poli tical boundary also in place of the Nihing, more especially as water-sheds are commonly used as lines of demarcation in this country, and streams, along which people live, very rarely. As the boundary laid down by Goldsmid’s Commission of 1871 now stands, the district of Bampusht, instead of being bounded on the south by the line of the Bampusht Kuh, appears to come down to the Nihing stream, which is here supposed to divide Kalatfrom Persian territory. The Bampusht Kuh is of considerable elevation. Its summit line is seldom less than 5,000 feet above sea level, and about 2,000 feet above the country at its base. Some peaks rise to 7,000 feet * Beyond Pimpiska^ * So Lovett says in his original report, but in his contribution to Eastern Persia he says the hills are only 5,000 feet high.however, the hills become thin and broken, and though easily traced, the range appears to be insignificant until the Kashani Kuh, south of Panjgur, is reached. However, the Bampusht Kuh and Mazampusht and Sagar- kand is a lofty and somewhat imposing-looking range, though devoid of vegetation or' natural beauty. Looking from the Nihing, St. John remarks :—“ To the north an arid brown plain stretched away to the Bam pusht hills, rising like a wall in naked ugliness some 10 miles oft;” On the other side also the Bampusht Kuh appears to be more or less precipitous. It must not be supposed, however, that the hills consist of one single bold range. As is almost always the case in this country, the range is composed of several parallel ridges, among which one perhaps dominates the others sufficiently to be considered the main range. Lesser parallel ranges also occupy a portion of the Bampusht district. So far as we are aware, the Bampusht hills can only be crossed by one pass—the Hinduan—which leads over the eastern end of the range. (It will be found described under its own name.) But it should not, therefore, be supposed that no other roads exist. In all probability there is more than one pass leading from the unexplored district of Irafshan on the south to the equally unexplored Bampusht, etc., on the north. In fact the direct road to Dizak by which St. John and Blanford sent_back their Indian servants, superfluous tents, etc., in 1871, lies through Irafshan, and must therefore cross the westerly prolongation of the Bampusht Kuh. The geological formation of the Bampusht hills is of tertiary age and belongs to the nummulitic series. Blanford remarks “ The rocks of the Bampusht range are shales and sandstones, precisely similar to ^the other nummulitics previously traversed.” See also article in Baluch istan Gazetteer, Makran—Geolog v.—(Lovett ; St. John-, Blandford.)

There is little or no water in the river, except during or after rain, when it comes down in a torrent. There are 50 houses inside the walls of the village and a large date grove in the valley above the village, containing about 6,000 trees, each tree yielding about 3ifes of dates in an ordinary year ; ropes are made out of the fibre of the palm. . The principal importance of Bandan from a military point of view lies in the fact that it is situated at the mouth of a pass debouching on Sistan and on the road between it and Neh, Birjand and Meshed. It is also the last point at which water for anything but a very small body of men and animals can be obtained en route to Sistan, until the Hdmun is reached, 30 miles distant Bandan produces about 10 to 20 khanodrs or 150 to 300 Indian maunds of wheat and barley, but it does not suffice for the wants of the people who obtain supplies from Sistan.

Ban dar Abbas is situated about 280 miles north-north-west of Masqat and 96 miles east-north-east of Lingeh town. Bandar Abbas, stands at the foot of a bay upon a low, sandy, shelving beach ; the buildings approach within 100 yards Site and buildings- wa ter’s edge. The town looks out between the islands of Hormuz and Larak upon the junction of the Gulfs of Persia and ’Oman off the Ras-al-Jibal promontory : its background, as viewed from the sea, is formed by the massive pile of Kuh-i-Ginau, which at a distance of only 18 miles north by west of the town attains an altitude of 7,783 feet. The immediate surroundings of Bandar Abbas are utterly bare; even the usual drapery of a few palms and garden cultivation are hero wanting. The anchorage is 2 miles south of the town in 4 or 5 fathoms of water ; it has good holding-ground and is well sheltered from every direc tion except the south-east, but the landing- is bad on account of shallows which extend a long way from the beach. The town is about a mile long, and half a mile deep. If fronts ^ on the beach. The bulk of the town is composed of houses of sun dried brick. A number of the houses possess Bddglrs which here take the form of low square towers like those of English country churches, but more squat, and with vertical slits upon all four sides towards the top. The town was formerly enclosed by walls upon the landward side , but these, where they still exist, are concealed by the quarters which have sprung up out side them. At the head of the pier stands the old Dutch factory used as a residence by the Deputy-Governor, and the Customs house. The ground around the town and the British Consulate is sandy desert, and quite open. The ground rises gradually from the beach to some low hills at a distance of a miles or a mile and a half. A river-bed, dry in Jan uary 1910, is on the east of the town, and divides the town from the sandy d seit on which stands th. ' British Consulate. The caravanserai is about 20 feet above the rive bed, and 150 west of it, on the eastern outskirts of 1 he town. . . , The climate of Bandar Abbas is notorious for its heat and unhealthi ness ;* but there is no meteorological station and Climate and water-supply- precise data are not available. The summer heat is almost intolerable ; this is due doubtless to the combination of the moist air from the stagnant bay in front of the town with the reflected and radiated heat from the mountain wall behind. E ven in the depths of winter the mercury seldom falls below the freezing point, and when, on the morning of the 29th of January 1905,f pools were found covered with a thin coating of ice, the oldest inhabitants professed themselves unable to recall any similar occurrence. The months of January and February are * A selection of remarks by travellers on the Bandar Abbas climate will be found in Curzon’s Persia (II, 421). . ^ ^ „ . TT t The winter of 1904-05 was exceptionally severe m the Persian Gulf as wen m Upper India. .68 BAN—BAN cool and salubrious with occasional showers of rain which are sometimes heavy ; in March, April and May the temperature rises, the surrounding country becomes dried up and malaria prevails ; in June, July, August and September the heat is intense, and most of the inhabitants desert the town to escape it, but at the same time fever diminishes ; during October, November and December the heat is again upon the wane and malarial fevers are once more rife. Mosquitoes are troublesome in the spring and autumn months. The town contains wells, but the water is invariably bad and brackish, and seems to conduce to guinea-worm and kidney diseases. The better off among the inhabitants obtain their supply for drinking from wells at Nai- band village, 3 miles to the eastwards, and the demand has given rise to a regular traffic. Well water is obtainable at two places near the shore, at a distance of one mile and two miles respectively, east, from the town. There are rain reservoirs north and east of the town, which were full in January 1910. Bandar Abbas is described as at present consisting of over 2,000 houses and huts, the more substantial struc- Population- tures outnumbering the slighter in the propor tion of 3 to 2. The cold-weather population is about 10,000 souls; the summer population, as already explained, is very much less. The bulk of the inhabitants belong to a hybrid race of mixed Persian, Baluchi, Arab and negro descent and are known as “ ’Abbasis the lower orders of them speak a patois, also called “ ’Abbasi ” which is a compound of Persian, Baluch ’Arab and Swahili ingredients. The ’Abbasis are a poor-spirited race and hardly, it is said, regard truth, honesty or charity as virtues. The poorer classes lead a mean and squalid life in date-leaf huts. A cheap diet of fish and dates comprehends all their desires, and when this is already provided laziness and independence alike forbid them to work : this apathetic spirt among the labouring classes impedes all work and goes far to justify the local saying that nothing begun at Bandar Abbas is ever finished. Apart from the merchants and shopkeepers, who are mostly strangers from abroad, the people are all boatmen, fishermen or labourers, and in the date-season all are converted into harvesters. The immigrants upon whom the life of the place chiefly depends are Persian from Lar (500 souls), from Ahwaz (300 souls) and from Bastak (150 souls); also Hindus (66 souls), Khojas (67 souls) and Arabs (50 souls). Sunnis at Bandar Abbas are about half as numerous again as Shi’ahs and belong mostly to the Shafi’i school, but some are Hanafis. About 300 or 400 persons, chiefly Laris and Ahwazis, possess arms. Local trade with the surrounding district of Shamil is inconsiderable and the Bandar Abbas bazar, which contains ra o an commerce- about 200 shops, is only moderately well supplied with goods. There are no local manufactures. The export and import business of Bandar Abbas, though its pre-eminence as the port par excellence of Southern Persia has disappeared since the rise of Bushire and the development of the Shiraz route to the interior, is still valuable. Kirman and even Yazd still fall within the commercial radius of Bandar Abbas. i.The true exports, as distinguished from re-exports,'are now cotton, wool, almonds, pistachios, raisins, currants, asafoefcida, gum, opium and carpets. A considerable import trade in rifles which was formerly carried on here has been largely extinguished by the vigilance of the Imperial Persian Customs Department. The currency of Bandar Abbas, which is typical of this part of Persia, Currency, weights and consists principally of silver and nickel. The measures- silver coins are pieces of 1,2, and 5 Krans, the double Krans being the commonest. The nickel coins minted in Belgium are of 100 and 50 Dinars each and are used as small change ; they are styled respectively Dushahl (or Chaharpul) Yakshahi (or Dupul). The money table runs as follows :— 50 Dinars = 1 Shahi, 20 Shahis = 1 Kran. 10 Krans == 1 Tuman. Indian rupees are also current and the present rate of exchange is 4 Krans to a rupee (1905). The official standard of weight at Bandar ’Abbas, as elsewhere in Persia is the Tabriz Man of 640 Misqals, equal to 6.5471b English avoirdupois. The unit generally employed in trade, however, is the so-called ’Abbasi Man of about 9fb English, which is sub-divided as follows :— 1 Man ’ Abbasi .. .. .. .. = 4 Chaharaks. 1 Chaharak .. .. .. .. .. =r 6 Qiyas. 1 Qiyas ? .. .. .. .. .. 37J Misqals. The silver one and two-kran pieces are supposed to weigh 1 and 2 Misqala, respectively. Measures of length are as below :— 4 Girehs .. .. .. .. .. — 1 Chaharak. 4 Chaharaks .. .. .. .. .. = 1 Zara’-i-Shah or 41-143 English inches. There is also a Zara’-i-dast or cubit of 18 inches, a Zara’-i-Bandari of 9 Gireh or about 22 inches and a Zara’-i-Lar of 12 Girehs. The English yard is used by cloth-merchants under the name of Var and is taken as equiva lent to 14 Girehs. There are no liquid measures, fluids being sold by weight, and no measures of capacity.

Other live stock are 250 cattle and 150 sheep and goats. The town is dependent for pack-carriage on the surrounding district of Shamil of which the resources are estimated in the article under that name. The same holds of ordinary supplies, and the water-supply has already been described above. The inland routes which have their starting point at Bandar Abbas is dealt wfth in the article on the Shamil district. Bandar Abbas is now connected with Hanjam Island by telegraph. The shore end of the cable is landed about f of a mile east of the pier at the centre of the town. Bandar Abbas is one of the Gulf Ports and as such is subject to the' Governor who has his head-quarters at Administration. Bushire town. The local representative of his authority is a resident Deputy-Governor who is his nominee; this indivi dual appears to be entitled in theory to exercise official influence over the Kalantar of the Shamil district whose seat is at Ziarat, but in practice the Kalantar generally succeeds in maintaining a position of equality and the Deputy-Governor is ruler of the town only. The Deputy-Governor is an unsalaried official who pays a premium for his post and recoups himself as best he can by the collection of dues and taxes ; the present incumbent of the office is reported to have paid 5,000 tumdns for his appointment for one year, and the highest annual sum ever contracted for is said to have been 14,000 tumdns. From the Deputy-Governor’s sources of income the revenue of the sea customs, collected by the staff of the Imperial Persian Customs, are of course excepted. His chief items of revenue are a shop-tax called Asnafiyeh and a passport-tax called Tazkireh. At tempts are made from time to time to increase the revenue by the imposition, of various irregular imposts under the names of Dallali, or brokerage, collected from both seller and buyer at the rate of 2| per cent. ; of Sar-i-Rigi, a tax levied on goods placed in position for loading on transport animals ; of Mai- dani, a kind of octroi duty at from | Jcrdn to 2 krdns per package according to size, and of Askaliyeh or pierage, nominally for the up-keep of a pier of Askaleh, at to 5 krdns per package according to size. Rahdari or road tolls, nominally for the maintenance of roads and provision of road guards is not at present levied in the neighbourhood. The Deputy- Governor in fact has carte blanche to make what he can out of the place during his lease, subject only to the restraints imposed by the presence of the Director of Customs and of the representatives of Foreign Powers. The town produoes no land or agricultural revenue. Incidentally the Deputy-Governor conducts the general administration of the town and decides criminal and civil cases. He maintains no regular police and his settlement of cases appears to be determined chiefly by corrupt or partisan considerations. As a criminal authority he has power to inflict fine, torture or imprisonment, but death sentences cannot be carried out without the sanction of the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The religious authorities, who in some districts of the Persian coast are respected and administer at least the semblance of civil justice, appear atBandar Abbas to be utterly venal and are not spontaneously resorted to by litigants, even as an alternative to the court of the Deputy-Governor. Fanati cism is absent and the ecclesiastical element at Bandar Abbas is negligible. There are no leading families : the most influential of the local notables at the present time is the Amin-ut-Tujjar, Haji Husain, who belongs to a family ■from Galehdar (1905). _ rc • i The Persian Government is represented at Bandar Abbas by the officials -of the Imperial Customs Department, at the head of whom is a Belgian Director (1905), and by a Naib Karguzar or deputy agent of the Persian Foreign Office. The office of the Customs Director has become a general court of appeal from the decisions of the Persian Deputy-Governor and rela tions between the Director and the general body of Persian officials in the place are strained. The duties of the Deputy Karguzar are nominal. His salary is 50 iumdns a month. The Customs residency is about 450 yards south-south-east of the British Consulate. Bandar Abbas is undefended. The only armed men are 8 artillerymen charged with the duty of firing the sunset gun and about 40 Tuf angchis or armed levies who are under the orders of the Deputy-Governor and the Director of Customs. Except Great Britain no European Power possesses any tangible interests at Bandar Abbas. The Indian Government Foreign interests- maintain at Bandar Abbas a Consul, who is a member of their Political Department, and there is also a British post- office the business of which is exempt from Persian interference. The British Consulate is situated about f mile east of the town, and £ mile from the shore, in the open sandy plain. It is a strong, well-built, stone building of two stories, standing in a compound 70 yards square, which is enclosed by a six-foot wall of brick m mud. In an adjoining com pound, 130 yards by 50 yards, are the Telegraph office, a two-storied budd ing the native infantrv lines, hospital, etc., all single storied mud-brick bu. cl ings. There is a well of bitter water in the Consulate compound, which could be used for drinking in an emergency. Sweet water is obtained from wells at a distance of 2 miles. Th • old British Consulate is situated at Naiband, on the coast 3 miles east of the town, and is surrounded by a garden and some trees which constitute almost the only trace of verdure in the locality. To the British Consul are confided the interests of about 70 Hindu and 70 Khdjah traders, British subjects, some of whom own trad ing-vessels and pearl-boats : the Hindu community have in addition a serai and temple of their own. The only other Foreign Power locally represented is Russia, who maintains here a Consulate with the staff of a Consul, a Persian Agent, and Armenian clerk, a Persian Mirza, and 10 Cossacks. _ Russian trade, however, at Bandar Abbas is very small, and there is not a single resident Russian subject.— (Lorimer, 1908 , Rae, 1910, Dela- main, 1910.) ■ * BANDARSALSFfL— A small bay on the coast of the island of Qishm, Persian Gulf, between a remarkable quoin-shaped hill with a small tree on the top, about 300 or 400 feet hffih, and a peaked hill 3£ miles to east of this, about 300 feet high.78 BAN—BAN Boats anchor here in a ndshi wind.— (Constable ; Stilte ; Persian Gulf Pilot.) BANDAR KARGUN— A small seaside village of 200 houses, 7 miles south of Kanar-i-Ismail (q.v.). The inhabitants own 30 small boats and do a very small trade with Jishm and other ports ; they live principally on fish and drink brackish river water.— (Sher Jang, 1902.)

BAND-I-KALACHU— Elev. 2,520'. A halting-place in Bashakard, 741 miles from Minab, on the road to Bint. It has a small patch of cultivation, and a supply of good water from a stream, but there are no inhabitants.— (Galindo. November 1888.) BAND-I-KALANG— A halting-place in Bashakard, 701 miles from Jashk, on the road to Anguran. It has a grove of fair-sized tamarisks, which afford good shade. About 2 miles to the south on the banks of the Shah Bavag river are the ruins of an old fort, 300 yards long by 200 yards w\de.—(Medley and Massy, 1893.) BAND-I-KASHlN— A river in Persian Baluchistan, about 14 miles south of Bazman. The Talab Nala runs into it, and beyond the junction it is called Shanda- mulla ; it joins the Bampur river before it flows into the Jaz Murian Hamun.— (Brazier-Creagh, 1894.) BAND-I-MARZ— An important range of hills in Bashakard, running north-north-west and south-south-east, forming throughout its length the water-shed bet ween those rivers which flow into the Persian Gulf on the south, and those which drain into the Jaz Murian Hamun on the north.Its height is inconsiderable, as mountains go in Persia, nowhere pro bably exceeding 7,000 feet. The Kuh-i-Hamarsun to the west of the Buhang Pass, and the Kuh-i-Bunakin to the east of it, are two of its promi nent peaks. To the south of the Band-i-Marz and parallel to it are two smaller ranges, the Band-i-Nashki and the Band-i-Sirtang, the latter being the nearer to Marz. From the Band-i-Nashki to the top of the Band-i-Marz the rocks appear to be formed of a sort of crystal—possibly mica—interspersed with gra nite, but on the north side of the Marz range this formation gives place to a kind of hard shale. Ibex and urial are said to be found in these mountains .—{Medley and Massy, 1893.) BAND-I-NASHKi or BAND-I-VIhI— A range of hills in Bashakard, running parallel to, and to the south of, the Band-i-Marz. It is crossed by the Anguran-Sikunkan road, about 18 miles north-north east of the former place .—{Medley and Massy, 1893.) BAND-I-NILAG— A high range in Persian Baluchistan, running approximately east and west, at a distance of about 70 miles from the Makran coast, at the mouth of the Rapch river. It is believed to be continued westwards by the Afin-i-Band range of Bashakard, and to be connected on the east with the Lashar Kuh {q.v.). This range is the geographical boundary of Makran, which for a breadth of about 50 miles south of the coast range is more or less hilly. North of the Band-i-Nilag are the open plains of Bampur {q.v.). At Fanuch the range is pierced by a long defile, through which the Fanuch stream escapes southwards to Bint {See Fanuch.) To the west, probably some 40 miles from Fanuch, is the Shimsan gorge, through which comes the Sadaich river. There may also be intermediate gorges giving passage to the Gidich and Pasga rivers, both large streams. The Pasga, however, is said to originate in the Band-i-Nilag and this may also be the case with the Gidich. According to Floyer, the elevation of the Band-i-Nilag is 3,500 feet. . It is much higher than the other ranges and visible from a considerable distance, both north and south.— {Floyer.) Jennings states that when he visited these parts in 1885 he was unable to identify this range by this name, but regards it as likely to be the range called Ramishk {q.v.). BAND-I-NISSAR NALA— A watercourse in Narmashir, between Rigan and Burj-i-Aga Muham mad Khan. The cultivation of Dali Khan and a karlz lie about half a mile t o the west*.74 BAN-BAN BANDlNl— r A valley or plain in the Bir district, on the coat of Persian Baluchistan* The valley is 8 miles wide from east to west, and perhaps about the same from north to south. It is flat and sandy, almost surrounded by hills, and is drained by the Gitu or Bandini Kaur, which escapes south ward through a gap or gorge 300 yards wide and so makes its way to the sea by Homdan villages (q.v.). The telegraph line and road from Gwadar to Jashk also passes through the gap, above which is Bandini halting-place the sixth stage from Chahbar and ninth frcm Jashk. Water abundant from holes in the bed of the Gitu. Fuel and camel torage also abundant. (Pierce). BAND-I-SHAHRI, see Shakri (Kuh-i-). BAND-I-SHARIKl— A range of hills in Persian Baluchistan, about 3 miles south of the Gidich river {q.v.). The road from Kashi and Karvan northwards to Bint passes the western end of the range, at 10| to 11 miles from camp, on the Sartapi {q.v.). On the right at the end of the range is a, curious castellated hill, and on the left a low hog-backed elevation. Between them is the wide Jambki {forked) Pass {q.v.).&gt; i Floyer (1876) calls Shariki and Ligandi, another hill about 8 miles to the south, very striking ranges. They are rocky ranges, about 1,600 feet high, standing on an elevation and plateau, and are impassable, except in a few places, even for a man on foot. Towards the south-east they con verge sharply, and a bitterly cold wind comes down the gorge. The Sha riki Nala, which divides the ranges, contains a little brackish water. Here we saw two flocks of sheep and goats feeding on the sandhills, the vegetation of which consists almost entirely of trat.—{Floyer.) These ranges appear to be in about the same line as the Gau Kuh {q.v.), and may therefore be in one sense a continuation of it. BAND-I-SIRTANG— A range of hills in Bashakard, between the Band-i-Marz and the Band- i-Nashki, and parallel to these two ranges.—-(MedZe?/ and Massy, 1893.) BAND-I-VIHI, see Band-i-Nashk!

BASHAKARD— Lat. 27° 1' 42'; Long. 57° 49' 45'. A mountainous and savage district of south-eastern Persia, which is said to have been formerly an appanage of Pars, but which is now included - in the province of Kirman. It is bounded on the west by the districts of Rudbar, Shahri, and Rudan; ... on the south by the district of Jashk and by the eogiap ica . g U ]f from Jashk to the mouth of the Karvan river; on the east by a line running north from here and passing between Tutun and Bint to a point midway between Ramlshk and Ispand; and on the north by the Jaz Murian Hamun. Bashakard is the most primitive and backward district in Persia, and probably also the poorest. Until a few years ago no attempt was made to levy taxes, and even now its revenue, paid irregularly and at the rifle’s muzzle, amounts only to 800 tumdns, or about £160 per annum. Durran Khan of Rudbar farms the district, but his post is not an enviable one, especially as he is held responsible for raids. The district is divided into four sub-divisions, all of which pay 200 tumdns per annum, and may therefore be considered to contain an approximately equal population. Starting from the west, Sandark consists of some 15 villages and hamlets, and as it borders on Minab, whither its inhabitants occasionally resort, it is the least savage of the sub-districts. Jakdan (? Jaghdan), further east, was visited by Galindo, who describes its principal village as infinitely squalid and miserable. The district contains 24 villages and hamlets, some of which are close to Jashk. Anguran was visited by Floyer, Massy, and Medley, and has 14 villages, while finally Marz, with its capital Ramlshk, boasts of 22 villages and hamlets. The country consists of one main rugged range running from east to west, t,. . , , which serves as a watershed to streams drain- Physical features. ^ ^ Gul£ of , 0m5n or ^ Jaz Murian Hamun. North of this plain is the open plain running down to the hdmun, while to the south the country consists of a labyrinth of rugged and impracticable hills, intersected by huge rocky water courses. The lines of communication mostly follow the latter, but even these are oftenBAS—BAB 77 impassable, owing to the enormous boulders which fill the river-channels, and to the great ridges of uptilted strata with which the country is intersected, and which often convert the river-banks into perpendicular scarps many feet in height, at the foot of which the water lies still and deep. The hill-slopes be arthe usually stunted vegetation found in such locali- v . ties, and wherever there is a small extent of level ground it is generally sparsely wooded with trees of various thorny kinds, such as the her or hundr, and varieties of the mimosa and acacia families. These often grow to a considerable size, in some cases attaining a height of 40 or 50 feet with a circumference of 6 feet at the base of the trunk. But the all-pervading plant of the district is the palmetto, or dwarf palm, called by the natives pish. This grows in dense masses along all the water courses, and on low-lying ground generally. The stem appears to run along the ground, taking root at intervals and throwing up clumps of broad fan-shaped leaves. These are sometimes 6 or 7 feet high in the more flourishing specimens, and the length of the fan, measured along the mid rib, 2 feet or more. Great use is made by the natives of these leaves. The fibre, after being soaked in water and beaten with a stone, is made into sandals, which, how ever, are not very durable and only last for two or three marches. Their huts are also thatched with a sort of matting made from the leaves, and ropes are made from the same material, while the centre of the young shoots furnishes a kind of soft white stalk, which is not bad eating. The best feature of Bashakard is the abundance of water. Nearly all the streams have a plentiful supply of running water, which is almost invariably good, and in any rate, the district forms a pleasing contrast to the Water. this respect, at rest of Persia. Inhabitants. of oraimdo gives the following description the people of Bashakard :— “ There are two very pronounced and very different types of humanity in Bashakard. One, to which I have referred before, has evidently a large admixture of African blood ; in fact I saw numerous examples which might be supposed to be pure negro. Many such were to be seen here at Tutun. I particularly noticed one half-naked hag, clad only in a filthy rag like a very short petticoat. Her face was of the most pronounced and ill- favoured negro type—huge blubber lips, broad flat nose, prominent cheek bones, and deeply sunk, blood-shot eyes. Her hair was most unmistak able wool, and she was enormously fat, with an arm as thick as a muscular man’s thigh, and huge pendulous breasts ; in fact exactly corresponding with the general idea of a Hottentot woman. “Clinging to the scanty skirts of this lovely creature was a boy, appa rently 10 or 12 years old, as naked as when he was born, with skin of the blue- black negro hue, and crisp woolly hair. Another boy, a little older, was clad only in a kind of short shirt formed of a piece of coarse calico, across the back of which was printed the name of some Manchester firm in big blue letters. Shortly before reaching the village I had met a similar group. A youngish woman, who from her appearance might have been taken for a78 BAS—BAS pure bred negro, clad solely in a sort of shirt of a dusty black. She was driving a camel, on which sat a naked boy, while alongside walked another boy who appeared to be 12 or 13 years old, perfectly naked. The whole party were of the genuine blue-black negro tinge. “ The other type, to which I allude, is, I imagine, the original Baluch. The men are of about the medium height, or perhaps a little over it. Their frames are very lean and slender, but sinewy. The face is usually long, with a thin well-cut nose, generally slightly aquiline. The lips are thin. The eyes are large, well protected by the brow, but not too deeply set. The moustache and beard are usually somewhat scanty, but the hair is long and flowing, generally with a slight curl. The colour is very dark, quite as dark as the ordinary Bengali. “ Altogether the face would not be a bad one, were it not for a peculiar and almost indescribable look of wildness and haggardness about the eyes, coupled with an expression of intense watchful cunning. Another notice able feature about the men is that a large proportion of them are deeply scarred about the face, apparently from sword cuts. The headman of Muri Kuh, an old man of apparently 70 years, had his face so terribly distorted by huge gashes, that it presented a mixture of the grotesque and the horrible, at which one scarcely knew whether to laugh or to shudder.” Sykes is of opinion that the second type, to which Galindo alludes, is in reality identical with the aborigines of Baluchistan, and is the straight haired Ethiopian referred to by Herodotus. Massy draws an even more unflattering picture of the natives than does Galindo :— “ The Bashakardis are a very miserable-looking race—underfed, shrivel led up, small-eyed, wizen-faced creatures, the men generally under 5 feet 5 inches in height, and the women small in limb and stunted in growth. There is nothing open and engaging in their countenances, in which poverty and hunger, cunning and avarice, are plainly written. Though constantly armed and almost always fighting among themselves, they are not brave, and though I have heard from themselves long stories of their wars and battles, there was no occasion mentioned in which either side lost more than 4 men killed and about 6 or 8 wounded. But this, they confessed, was quite enough for them. “Their avarice is most marked and leads even their headmen to commit acts of meanness which would make a Pay Department Babu blush. They are perfectly insatiable, and the more you give the more they want. Whenever money is given to a headman for a party, the snarling and snap ping reminds one more of a pack of hungry pariah dogs than anything else. “Venereal diseases seem to be very prevalent with their usual baneful consequences ; weak eyes and ulcerated throats are common, while deformities of all kinds are not unusual. “ Here, as in most Eastern countries, a large proportion of the fruit is eaten unripe by the hungry and greedy inhabitants. Men, women and children may be seen with handfuls of green dates, crunching them with gusto, and any rare kinds of fruits, such as grapes, pomegranates, melons, etc., are almost invariably devoured before they arrive at maturity. ”The Bashakardls are, of course, nominally Musalmans, but the bonds of their religion appear to sit lightly on them. Their women do not cover their faces, and indeed they appear to enjoy much more liberty than the females of other Muhammadan countries. Owing partly to its remoteness from the central government, and partly to its poverty, which is such that it is nobody’s interest to improve matters, a state of lawlessness and quasi-independence exists among the chiefs of Bashakard, which is probably unequalled in any other part of Persia. The abundant water-supply, which might easily be turned to good account for irrigation purposes, is allowed to run to waste, and cattle cannot be sent to graze at any distance from their villages without an armed escort. Amongst such a people and in such circumstances industry of any kind is, needless to say, non-existent, and agriculture only of the most primitive character. The inhabitants herd a few flocks of sheep and goats, and depend on their date crops, and a few badly-cultivated patches of Indian- corn and wheat, for a hand-to-mouth livelihood. This low state of civilization is due, no doubt, largely to the charac ter of the people themselves and to the strong strain of negro blood, apparently of a very low type, with which they are tainted, but probably no less to the neglect of the central authority ; and as long as this neglect continues, or until the country comes under a more beneficent govern ment, there does not appear to be much likelihood of its rising in the scale. — (Galindo, 1888 ; Massy and Medley, 1893 ; Sykes, 1902.) BASHIB— Bashib, the road from Jashk to this village, crosses the rivers Marik and Tararqand, and passes three villages, one about 13th mile, the second about 15th mile, and third 17th mile. They are surrounded by date trees and situated about a mile from the sea. The village of Bashib is inhabited by Baluchis, and there are a few huts also scattered over the ground. There is a small bit of ground cultivated with wheat, and the water is good from the spring. Other supplies are very scarce— (Shaikh Mohi-ud-Din, 1893-94.) BASHUR— A plain in Makran, some 5 miles wide, 7 miles from Pish Mant, on the Chahbar-Geh road. It is composed of whitish clay intersected hyndlds. On it lies Chah Shur, a salt well.— (Sykes ; Brazier-Creagh, 1893.) BASlDU— A British station situated on the westernmost point of Qishm Island, about 25 miles east by north of Lingeh town: there is also an Arab village of the same name about 1 mile to the eastward. Basidupoint is a low cliff, rising 20 feet above high-water mark, and is level with a few date-trees: it is an airy position open to all the winds that blow. The station was practically unoccupied, from the time when the Indian naval squadron was abolished, until 1910, in which year it was re opened as a coaling station in connection with the suppression of the maseat arms-traffic. The former officers’ quarters, hospital, sepoy lines, bazar,80 BAS—BAS and store-houses were, accordingly, allowed to fall into disrepair. Some of them are now (June 1910) being repaired, and when the work is finished there will be accommodation for some half-dozen Europeans, and a dozen native employes. A good stone pier, extending to water mark, leads to the coal wharf. There is a bungalow, near the flagstaff, £ mile south of the point, which is being repaired. There is also a rest house, a forge, and a wireless station, of which the two latter adjoin one another. There are three reservoirs, in good repair, which are also used by the local population. A rifle range, laid out to 600 yards, still exists. There were never any per manent defences, but, in 1910, a non-commissioned officer and 6 men of the Indian Army were sent there as a guard. The population of the staion, before it was re-opened in 1910, comprised some 50 souls. The station benefits by a shamdl breeze during the summer. There are some Portu guese ruins near the station. The Arab village consists of about 200 huts and is included within the bounds of the British jurisdiction. The people are fugitive slaves, Sunnis by religion, and gain a living as fishermen and weavers of lunqis. The village has no trade and affords few supplies except water, for the collection of which there are 8 reservoirs. There are about 25 donkeys, 50 cattle and 400 sheep and goats. The anchorage at Basidu extends parallel to the shore on the north side of the point and consists of a belt i mile broad at J mile from the shore : the depth is 5 to 7 fathoms and the bottom of clay, is good holding ground. The landing is inconvenient in a swell on account of the rockiness of the coast, and at low-water on account of a mud flat which is then uncover ed. Outside the anchorage lies a channel 12 to 16 fathoms deep called the “Gut,” in which vessels avoid anchoring. Protection against the Shamal, which here blows from south-west by west, is given by the northern point Beacon Shoal, a narrow bank which curves round the west end of Qishm island from Basidu point for two-thirds of the way to Has Dastakan ; of this bank the northern half, about 2J miles hmg, is dry at low water and has its extremity marked by a beacon. There is a deep but narrow and unnavigable channel between Beacon Shoal and the coast of the island. Other important features of the approaches to Basidii are the “ North Bank ” and the “ Flat.” The former is a westward pro longation of the middle shoal of Clarence Strait which has its final ending in the sea 7 miles west-south-west of Basidu point. The flat is a great bank carrying 2 to 3 fathoms at low water and lying round the whole south-western corner of Qishm Island. It extends for more than 20 miles along the coast, about | of its length covering the western and the remainder the southern side of the island, and its northern end overlaps the south end of the Beacon Shoal and is outside it. The main entrance to the Basidu roadstead begins between the Flat and the North Bank where it is 2 miles wide and has 3f fathoms of water ; it then runs between Beacon Shoal and the North Bank deepening as it goes to 7 and eventually to 9 fathoms. There is a subsidiary passage between the coast of the island and the Flat as far as Beacon Shoal where it joins the ordinary entrance; it has been used by a steamer drawing 14 feet, but it is imperfectly known. — (Lorimer, 1906; Craufurd, 1910.)BASlE.AN —Lat. 31° 37' 24'; Long. 59° 4' {Lentz) ) Elev. 4,800'— {Sykes.)

Wood) A village in the Bampur district of Persian Baluchistan, 29 miles from the Khadreh-i-Zindeh Kuh, as the main peak of the Kuh-i-Bazman is term- ed, 48 miles from Bampur and 54 from Fehruj. It is supplied by two kdrlzes, one coming from a warm spring, and the other from numerous springs, below the village. The village consists of the ruins of two forts and some 80 houses and huts, most of the families being away in the plains in the winter, but there are at least 200 in the spring time. There is an extensive date grove and numerous fruit trees, with a considerable amount of cultivation. The stone fort was built by Mirza Khan, son of Haidar Khan of Is fahan, about two centuries ago, and when the Persians re-conquered Balu chistan it was so strong that it could not be captured until artillery was brought to bear on it. Below the village are the remains of an “ Infidel’s fort, but there is no evidence forthcoming as to its origin. The inhabitants of Bazma n are principally KarTamzai &amp; and Sammi. Large flocks of sheep, goats and camels graze over the district and are Resources. Crops and vegetables. seen m several of the spots permanently occu pied. Fair crops of wheat, barley, jowari, cotton and beans are grown, also onions, turnips, melons, and radishes. Fine old mulberry, walnut, fig, lime, pomegranate and apricot trees are Fruit. seen - The date grove yields large and superior dates of three sorts, viz. :— (1) SJiang GWMAa.—There are some 400 trees of this sort; they yield a hardish-skinned sweet date which grows at the top of the tree. They are considered the best for export as they keep longer and retain their sweetness better. (2) Muzawati or Miazabti. Large, soft, golden dates of superior quality. r (3) Hazarat .—Large yellow species. The Magas, Fehruj and Bazman dates all have the reputation of being the best in Persian Baluchistan, both in size and flavour. The best trees yield from 30 to 50 seers. In the month of March or the end of February,K the natives impregnate the female flowers by placing a handful of the stamens in the sheath of the pistil. Only female trees bear fruit : they begin te bear at three years and are at their prime at about 30 years. A fair amount of supplies are obtainable here, but everything was scarce in January 1894. Climate. c ^ ma ^ e Sa id to be healthy all the year round. Up to about 30 years ago, Bazman was included in Sarhad and paid no Mdliat. revenue. Since that time it has been included in the Bampur revenue district and pays 500 tumans (mostly collected in kind) and one Tcharwdr of sulphur. Some 50 yards above the village is a large circular spring, 18 yards Hot spring m . c i rcum ference and 3 feet deep, with a circular pipe in the centre built of red bricks, 8 inches in thickness : the dimensions of the pipe are 15 feet 4 inches long and 2 feet 3 inches wide. Out of this exudes the warm water, flowing gradually and almost imperceptibly : below it is dug out a sandy circular hamum, from which an irrigation canal runs off to the date grove below. Tb e temperature of the water, taken at the mouth of the pipe for over a period of three weeks, in rain, frost and snow, never registered above 93° ; it is uninfluenced by atmospheric changes. There is no sulphurous odour or taste from this water, and it was used for all purposes daily without any detrimental effect. The inhabitants do not use it much except for irriga tion ; they draw from the other ledriz. As at Chilian, the present inhabitants are ignorant of the origin of their Former inhabitants. hamum, and various legends are afloat. The old fort and ruins to the west are considered to be the remains of a large Gabr city, the inhabitants of which built the hamum. BAZMAN HImUN— f This hdmun is situated to the south-west of the RIzabad Band (mountain- range) and to the north-east of the Kuh-i-Bazman. {Jennings, 1885.) BAZMAN, KUH-I or KUH-I-ZINDEH— Elev. 11,217'. A mountain chain in Persian Baluchistan, composed of parallel ranges, running down from a great peak, with a general north and south bearing. The principal peak is an extinct volcano, from the summit of which a mag nificent view is obtained. It is thus described by Brazier-Creagh :— “ From the top of the peak which rejoices in a multiplicity of names, m 2 .,. Madar Kuh, Meh Kuh, Khadreh-i-Zindeh .Kith, Zindeh Kuh, Bazman Kuh, etc., a splendid and striking view for over 150 miles, can , be seen, except a bit to the north shut out by Chehil peak. The altitude we made out to be 11,423 feet. To the south, far beyond the Jaz Murian Hamun and the Bampur lut, the pale-blue Lashar, Band-i-Nilag, Yazbag, Band-i- Fanuch and Ramishk ranges are visible. To the west are seen the lofty snowclad ranges stretching up to Kirman, viz., Jabal Bariz, Shah Savaraij - (Ce., the Shah on horseback), Hudian Kuh, Kuh Hazar and Kuh Jupar*. Description of view from Zindeh Kuh.84 BAZ-BAZ To the north-west the open Kirman desert stretches as far as the eye can reach, separated from the Galugan plain by the Rizabad Band. To the north-east lies the Sianeh range and all between us and it, viz., Jauri Band, Da min Kiili, Panj Angusht, Mur Pish, Garinchin and Birk with their intervening plains. To the south-east Ispidan, Humand and Mulatan peaks are plainly visible, beyond which are the Sarbaz hills. Beneath us are the low ranges surrounding Bazman and conspicuous amongst them are the conical-shaped Bacherama Kuh, the jagged white limestone Almah Kuh, Banaksimo and Banda Kamio. The Bazman range ends abruptly on the north in low sandhills, which seem to run out and split the plain. Six hamuns are seen. The one directly north of Bazman under the Rizabad Band receives the drainage of the plain from Shuraf via the Halil Rud, where we crossed the watershed ; it also receives that from the Kaleh Mazar Hamun through the Sam Sur exit, and that from the north-east slopes of Bazman. Over the Jauri Band is seen the Kaleh Mazar Hamun which has already been described. Between the Bazman and Hudian ranges, near Rigan another hamun is seen, and in the centre of the Kirman desert is the Ab-i-Riz Hamun. Still further off, on the vast Dasht-i-Lut, are the Shurgaz and Namaksar Jidmuns. On the Bampur plain, south-west is the large Chah Shur, Jaz Murian or Milan-i-Jihun Hamun, which receives the Bampur, Kaskin and Halil rivers and the entire southern drainage of the Bazman and Jabal Bariz ranges&gt; On the last 200 feet of the Kuh-i-Zindeh, huge boulders, of red rock lie Composition of Kuh-i- scattered about. The spaces between the bcnkl- Zindeh. ers and the ground along the precipitous: sides are composed of soft dust and crumbling pumice. It was impossible to form any definite idea of the exact strata as the depth of snow precluded a thorough examination, but there cannot be any doubt but that the entire Bazman range is volcanic, although now dormant. At the base of the south ern side of the sugar-loaf, at an elevation of some 8.000 feet, is a deep ndld under the Galami Kuh (a red jagged brick-like hill) which we crossed at the foot of the main peak. From this granular sulphur is obtained : it is in irregular particles and has to be dug out with a pick. A quantity of sulphur and geological specimens were secured. Up to 7,300 feet several fine fig and gwdm trees are seen, and, as on the Chehil range, quantities of asafoetida grow along the hillsides and over the stony plateaux, I recog nised three varieties— king, huslan and patherk ; I, however, failed to find the rab mentioned by Colonel Bell and Captain Jennings, although I made repeated enquiries. There is good shooting on this range. I got several good gad or guch-i- kuh (wild sheep) heads, also ibex. Wolves, hysenas and leopards are also found. In the vicinity of Bazman village chikor, duck, partridge and snipe were also daily bagged.”— (Brazier-Creagh, 1891 ; Sykes, 1902.)BAZ—BHU 87 BAZtjI— A halting-place in Bashakard, 45 miles south of Ramishk, on the road to Jashk.

From Behla to Baji near Miri Bazar, a distance, according to Lovett, of about 18 miles, there are no villages’ and apparently but little cultivation.— (Lovett.) There appear to be date-groves at Behla and no doubt a sufficiency of water and supplies for a small party could be obta'ned. HMADI— A stream and village in the Jashk district (q.v.). BELL PIR— A village near Khushk (q.v.) in Makran. BHAO— see Baku. BHUG— A village in Persian Baluchistan, about 9 miles west or west-south-west of Qasrqand, to which it apparently belongs. It is situated on the south (left) bank of the Kaju river (q.v.), about the point where that stream makes its southerly turn for the Bagrband hills. The village of Hait (q.v.) is about 3 miles further up the river on the opposite side. Both villages can be seen from the neighbourhood of Qasrqand, and each appears to be situated at the eastern end of an extensive date grove. HajI ’Abdul Nabi passed through Bhug in 1839, and says it was 12 kos (about 16 miles) from Geh over a generally level stony road. The chief was then one Mir Murad, probably a Gichki. He lived in a small fort surrounded by date trees. His revenue appeared to be 20,000 mans of grain and 1,000 packages of dates. The maunds are probably Chahbar# 88 BHU-BIA maunds, equalling one Company’s seer. However, the cultivation of the place (including Het ?) must have been nearly equal to that of Qasrqand, ; which is considered very fertile for the country. There is a route from Bhug direct to the coast at Puzim {q.v.). Haji ’Abdul NabI travelled it. The first 12 miles appears to be down the Kaju. Then a night’s journey to Piri Gail, a pool of water; and another night’s journey to the coast plains at “ Surkum ” (Sohrkumb ?); thence one stage to Puzim. The road from Bhug to Qasrqand is good. In 1885, according to Jennings, whose information is from native report, this' place contained about 10 houses and 500 sheep, with abun dance'of wood, water and grazing, and is the sixth stage from Bampur and the 4th from Chahbar.—(/id/i Abdul Nabi \ Lovett) Jennings.) BIABAN DISTRICT— A district of the Persian coast, included in the administrative province known as the Gulf Ports ; it is intermediate between the Gulf Ports district of Minab on the north and the Makran district of Jashk on the south and it flanks, upon the eastern side, the passage which connects the Gulf of ’Oman with the Gulf of Persia. The district is bounded on the west by the sea, and on the east by the crest of range of hills which runs parallel to the coast at a distance of 10 to 15 miles inland, dividing Blaban from the districts of Rudbar and Bashakard. On the north, the boundary with Minab district is a line which passes between the Minab villages of Zlarat, Dudar, Kaleh- Boundaries. i-Gat and Taling and the Biaban villages of Bundram, Guvasmand and Garuk ; on the south, the boundary with the Jashk district passes between the Biaban villages of Bunji and Bashib and the Jashk village of Kuh Mubarak. The district is thus about 50 miles in length from north to south, and from 10 to 20 miles in breadth. The chief range of hills is that forming the eastern boundary of the dis trict • it is known as the Kuh-i-Biaban. In the north, near Guvasmand it reaches an altitude of 1,962 feet, and in the south it has a peak 5,946 feet in height. Between Kuh-i-Biaban and the sea are several minor ranges, . , . which begin near the coast and tend gradually Physica ea ares. away from it in a south-easterly direction towards the main range ; these ridges have no general names, and are called after the villages near which they pass. They are entirely of sandstone, assuming, in places, curious and grotesque shapes and lending themselves to varied uses as forts, store houses for grain, etc. In one peak, these subsidiary ranges attain a height of 899 feet. The principal streams in order from north to south, are the Gaz, Hivai, Kara!, Biriz, and Zangali—all of which except the Kara! and the Biriz, flow down from the main range to the sea. The Gaz, which passes about a mile north of the village of Gaz, derives its name from the tamarisks which grow in profusion along its banks. - «£ke Hivai reaehes the sea approximately in north latitude 26° 15'; theBIA—BIA esr liiiz, rives Kava! is about 7 miles south of the Hival; and the Biriz about 8 miles south of the Karai; the Zangall, which is the southernmost of all, has its course immediately to the soutk of the villages of Tujak and Gavan. All these streams have steep banks, which are about 20 feet high and fro m 50 to 70 yards apart. In winter, the Gaz, Hi /aT, Karai, Biriz and Zangali are sometimes impassable, but in summer they either fall to a low level ©r dry up altogether. In spring the Gaz river has been known to run 6 feet deep, with a current of 6 miles an. hour, and travellers are sometimes delayed by it for as much as a week at a time. Besides these large streams there are a number of hill torrents, varying in width from 10 to 30 yards which after rain would undoubtedly become difficult, if not impossibly for transport animals. The coast line is low and sandy except for a short distance southwards from Biriz, where' it is said to be rocky and bold. There are few inlets or creeks, and none of any consequence except that which forms an anchorage for Sirik. The soil of Biaban is clayey in parts and sandy elsewhere. A feature of the district is the mins or dangerous quicksands, formed by the sun drying the surface of the ground, while, below, the soil remains in a semi-fluid condition ; they occur chiefly upon the coast, between the firm, damp strip near the water’s edge and the soft, dry ground further inland. The com monest wild trees are the camel-thorn and the tamarisk. The inhabitants of Biaban are all Baluchis, chiefly of the Rais and’ Inhabitants Hot tribes; in religion they are Sunnis, and are not in anv degree Persianised. They are ex tremely poor, ignorant and uncivilized. Almost all of them inhabit date- leaf huts ^ there is hardly a dwelling of any other kind in the whole district. The people are date growers, stock owners,, and cultivators; a few upon the- coast, however, eke out their livelihood by working as fishermen and sailors. The total population of Biaban is about 8,000' souls. Dates, wheat and barley are grown for local consumption, and the surplus for export is inconsiderable ; a little produce, Agriculture^, Uvestook and however, from the smaller villages finds a market in the larger, especially in those at the coast and most of all at Sirik. Cattle, sheep, goats and fowls exist only in numbers sufficient to meet local requirements. The only commerical centre is Sirik, from which agricultural products are exported in small quantities to the islands of Qishm, Hormuz, etc., and to the ports of Trucial ’Oman and ’Oman. Sarkand and the landing-places for Sirik and for the village of Gunari near the mouth of the Hivai stream are also points of call for vessels of light draft. Native vessels which are too large to enter the creeks, or to be hauled up the beach,, generally avoid the exposed shore of Biaban. Two main routes between Minab town and Jashk traverse the Biaban district lengthwisethey divide at Kalavi in the Minab district, and unite again at Gangan in the Jashk district. One of them, known as the Rah-i-Daria, follows the coast; the other, called the Rah- i-Kuh, runs further inland through the lower hills. The Rah-i-Daria, 61 I. B. 1 * Communication and transport.90 BIA—BIA starting from Kalavi, passes by Kuhistak (6 miles) and Ziarat (12 miles) in tbe Minab district, and then by Tahrui (9 miles), Sirik (4 miles), Kardar (6 miles), Gaz (3 miles), Gau or Namnrdi (4 miles), Zaravat (5 miles), Slkul (4 miles), Kara! (3 miles), Biriz (8 miles), Gavan (5 miles), Mukhjangan (3 miles) and Gatan (6 miles) in Biaban to Kuh Mubarak (10 miles) in the Jashk district, and so to Gangan(12 miles). The points through which the Kah-i- Kuh runs after leaving Kalavi are Shahmurdi, Kunarzu, Dudar, Bangurman and Hunzam, most if not all of which are in the Minab district, and the villages of Maihmani, Sarzeh, Qalamui, Goshki, Agushki, Zahraki, Shirahan, Sarkuh, and Bashib, in Biaban; Gangan, in the Jashk district, is reached after the last named. The Rah-i-Daria is frequently impassable in winter in consequence of floods, otherwise it presents no difficulties of a physical nature ; it is a mere track, however, sometimes not even visible across the sandy deserts which divide the villages and date groves situated upon it. The Rah-i-Kuh is described as hilly and difficult, and water—at least in summer—is scanty and bad. It follows that the Rah-i-Daria is used in summer and the Rah-i-Kuh in winter. It should be noted that the inhabitants of Biaban consider all water “ good ” which can be drunk without immediate evil results ; this fact should be borne in mind in con sulting the table of villages given below. The district possesses about 300 camels and 500 donkeys, but these are only sufficient for the requirements of the owners, and no considerable demand for transport could be enforced without hardship to the people. The District is governed by a Kalantar of local influence appointed . i ... ,. by the Governor of the Gulf Ports. At present the Kalantarship is in dispute between Mir Haji and Mir Barkat,* who both belong to the family of the Mirs of Jashk. The revenue for which the Kalantar is responsible appears to be about 2,500 tumdns a year. The seat of government has ordina rily been Sirik; but Mir Barkat, when in power, latterly made Gaigan his head-quarters. The state of the district is lawless, and about 1,200 rifles of various kinds are said to be in the hands of the inhabitants. The Kalantar has authority to order any punishment, except death, without reference to the Governor of the Gulf Ports ; and in piactice he may be said to inflict even the extreme penalty at will, for persons obnoxious to him are liable to be shot out of hand, on the pretext of their attempting to escape from custody. Civil cases are nominally decided by the ‘ Shara ’ courts, but in reality they are generally settled by force. * Aow deposed, 1910.BIA-BU 91 L 2 Topography.

BID KUTAL— The above is the name of a plateau wrongly called a kutal, which is a good halting-place in Sarhad, at mile 28, on route Ladis to Sehkuha. It con sists of an undulating plateau from J to 1J, miles wide, surmounted by hills from 500 to 1,000 feet above it. Here on a grassy plot are numerous springs of good perennial water. Grazing abundant; a fair amount of wood and a little grass. This is the highest part of the Bid mountain range which the road crosses, and is the waterparting of the drainage systems flowing north and south; both, however, afterwards curve to the east and join the Duzab river. A large army could encamp on this plateau ; height 6,674 feet. This is the only pass over the Bid range. The ascent from the south is some 1,000 feet in 6^ miles, and the descent on the north side some 1,500 feet in 10 miles. The mountain range crossed and the ndld down which the road descends both bear the name of Bid.

A large village and sub-district in Makran, situated on the Bint or Fanuch river, 20 miles south of Fanuch and about 45 due west of Geh. The district is hilly, but traversed by several streams, on which are numerous villages and date groves of generally minor importance ; but considering it as a whole, it is said to be fertile. The village is situated in the centre of a long line of date groves on the western bank of the river, and is overlooked by a square mud fort built on a high steep hill, round which cluster some 70 strongly constructed houses. To the west is a ruined natural wall, formed by a stratum of hard yellow sandstone projecting from the surface. One hundred yards beyond this is an advanced tower, 40 feet high. The town is entered from this side through a breach in the natural wall. The streets, if they can be so called, are steep, narrow and filthy; their uses as public ways being subordinate to their value'as manure beds. In fact, the houses of Bint, like those of Fanuch, Maskhutan and other Baluch towns, stand in what closely resembles one of the yards used in England for wintering cattle, every nook and corner throughout the town being spread thickly with “ kik ” grass, roots, and old rice straw, and deep in manure. The smell at some seasons must be fearful. No wonder that these places are un healthy, and that cholera and other epidemics occasionally make fear ful ravages ! The quantity of straw lying about, the sparrows, and the substantial appearance of the well-thatched houses, give the place the look of the back part of a very slovenly English homestead. The gardens and date groves of Bint are about | mile wide, and to wards the south reach the edge of the river-bed, which is, however, so large and full of loose shingle that it is not easy to get to the running stream. Many huts are scattered among the date groves. These are for the most part circular ; average diameter 20 feet; height 7 feet, covered by a light strong dome 10 feet high formed of a framework of date-sticks, thatched with pish, and covered with rope netting. The population, who are mostly Baluchis, with a certain number of slaves, was estimated by Goldsmid in 1866 as about 2,000 ; Floyer, in 1897, gave it as 700 ; while Sykes, in 1893, w 7 as informed it was about 2,000, but he did not visit the place himself. The people are supported mainly by their dates and about 100 acres of grain crops, which, in the order of the respective areas devoted to each, are —English horse beans, wheat, rice, and barley. A small quantity of infam ous tobacco is also grown. The soil is a stiff blue clay, requiring to be con stantly manured, and the manure is collected in the spaces between the M 2100 BIN—BIN houses of the village. The irrigation is carried on by a canal, but the arrangements for the distribution of the water are so bad, that some crops wither while others drown. The stream is led into four fields, making a total of about 6 acres daily, and the land holders—all great men—take . their turn according to their rank, and not according to their acreage. ; The manufactures of Bint area coarse white cloth made from cotton grown in the country; leather articles, as shoes, belts, and bullet pouches, water bottles from the porous blue clay of the Gidich; gauzy handker chiefs for women, badly dyed red and green, and embroidered with floss silk brought from Masqat; also elaborately embroidered skull caps. The ■ last named are the only articles for which there is any demand outside the district. There is no regular trade. After an unusually good year, sheep and gki are sometimes sent to Masqat and Bandar Abbas in exchange for floss silk and piece-goods. The money current consists of dollars, rupees, krdns, half-/cmws, and floss silk. Camels are plentiful, larger than coast camels, but not proportionately ■ more enduring, owing to their more succulent food. Donkeys are few : and dear, imported from ’Oman ; sheep poor ; cows few. There was only one horse at Bint in 1876. Religion is of great importance here, as in other towns of this region, but among the nomadic part of the population it is entirely absent. The mullas of Bint represent themelves as Sunni of the sect of Abu Hanif a, while they are really unadulterated Sufis. There is a good masjid and a school attended—in 1876—by twelve youths who paid 10 dollars for being taught the Koran or Hafiz. These young men appear to retain little of their religion after arriving at a marriageable age. Floyer remarks (in 1876) that the main subjects of conversation at Bint as elsewhere in Persian Baluchistan, were the tyranny of the “ Gajars ” (Persians) and the intense desire of the Baluchis that the English should take their country—an event they confidently expected to take place shortly. Its mdlidt in 1893 was estimated at 1,000 tumdns ; while the revenue of the three districts of Geh, Bint and Dasht amounted to Rs. 40,000 in 1902. The Bint or Fanuch river is one of considerable -importance in Makran. It has its source in five separate streams,* rising in the hills north of Fanuch where the watershed divides the drainage of the Bampur river from that flowing south to the Persian Gulf. Below Fanuch it passes through the famous gorge of that name, and being joined by the Gari and the Maluran rivers, runs approximately south for some 20 miles, when the Pasga river and other minor tributaries unite with it. Towards its southerly end, it appears to be called the Rapch river; this was brought * These are counting from the west— (a) The main stream, on which lies Mirabad. {b) Kaur-i-Kantakan. i (c) Kam Kaur with Kam just above Fanuch.

It eventually flows into the Persian Gulf, near Galag, a squalid village lying on the coast between Pas MaidanI and Pas Maki.— (Goldsmid, 1871 ; Floyer, 1876 ; Sylces, 19G2.) BlR— A small district or tract on the coast of Persian Baluchistan, forming with Kair (q.v.) a division of the Dasht district (see Dasht). The Bir stream runs through it (see below). It is uncertain whether there is any settlement so called, though Goldsmid on his march from Bampur to Chahbar in 1886, after leaving the Bint river and halting at Gunz (q.v.) passed a spot in the hills named Bir. It was west of what he calls the “ Tenk ” (Tank) river, which appears to be the upper course of the Bir Kaur. The coast villages of Tank and Galag, also Balak in the interior near the telegraph line, appear to be in the Bir district. Biri Sai Padag is a hill north of the road between the Bir and Bandani streams. It is 1,680 feet high.— (Lockhart’s Baluchistan Gazetteer.) BlPG, KUH-I-Blev. 8.200'. A lofty limestone range which rises from the Magas plain (see Magas) to a height of fully 4,000 feet. Haji ’Abdul Nabi calls it the Kuh-i-Bir, and St.John remarks that the name may possibly be “ Kuh-i-Buruj, but more probably a contraction of Kuh-i-Buzurg.” Conformably with the general lie of the ranges in this part of Persian Baluchistan, the Kuh-i-Birg runs north-west and south east. Its southern end is near the village of Magas and its northern in Sarhad, somewhere not far from Vasht or Kvash (q.v.).- At lea f d Haji Abdul Nabi, travelling in 1838 from Vasht to Erindagan, or, according to Jennings, Rindigan (q.v.), makes no mention of crossing a range, so he must probably have passed the end of it—a supposition which is to some extent supported by his statement that the “Kuh-i-Bir” bounds Sarhad to the south. Its total length may therefore be about 40 miles. The Kuh-i-Birg, as seen from Kushan on the eastern side of the Magas plain is “ a lofty and imposing range of mountains, with steep rugged sides and vividly tinted rocks.” Haji ’Abdul Nabi says that about twenty camel-loads of cardamums are gathered yearly on the Kuh-i-Birg, They are bought by Hindu traders from Dizak and taken down to Gwadar. The geological formation of the range is nummulitic limestone associated with red shale ; the large limestone hill of Mulatan, to the south-east of Magas, is on the v strike of the Kuh-i-Birg, and the same strike is prolonged very close to the Shairas Kuh and the limestone masses near Hung.— (Hdji Abdul Nabi', St. John', Blanford.)

A village in the Rudan district situated on the right bank of the Manujan river, 2 miles above its junction with the Rudkhaneh-i-Duzdi, 19| miles from Minab, on the road to Rigan. It is near the junction of the Duzdi and Minab rivers, and contains about 200 inhabitants, who own about 80 cows and 120 donkeys. The village possesses 14 ploughs, and 420 mans of seed (jau and millet) are sown annually, besides which a little henna and indigo is cultivated, and there are 8,000 date palms. Good water is obtained from the Manujan river. Supplies in small quan tities.are procurable, and there is fuel and camel grazing in abundance. There is a good camping-ground.—1898 ; Napier, 1899 ; Greij, 1905.) BIRlZ— A hamlet on the coast of Makran, about 24 miles west of Gwatar on the i road to Chahbar. Water is obtainable from wells, but supplies are scanty. The Indo-European Telegraph line cuts in about halfway between Birlz and Kaobu,— {Brazier-Creagh, 1893; from native information.)

BIRJAND.— Lat. 32° 53' 1' ; Long. 59° 10' 15’; Elev.j 4,760'— {Smyth). (^4,740'— {Gore). A town in Khorasan, about 240 miles south of Meshed. It is situated on the northern slopes of a barren stony valley, principally on the left bank of the Birjand river, which comes down from Bujd, and it completely covers a low ridge which runs parallel with the stream. The bed of the river remains dry for years together, and is only after heavy snow and rain that water is found at all, and then only a tiny stream. Water is obtained from irrigation channels. That portion of the town built on the left bank was formerly enclosed by a wall, with numerous gates and doors, but this is now in ruins. The whole town occupies a space of about 1 mile by | mile and has a population of about 25,000 souls. The houses are all domed, and built of sun-dried brick and are generally of a poor description. There is no covered bazar, but there are several streets of shops, in which Russian and British gopds are displayed for sale, the former predominating. The town contains a madrasseh, 7 mosques, 6 baths, 6 caravanserais and about 300 shops. The ark or citadel is situated at the foot of the hill to the east, and is a huge square enclosure, with the usual bastions and towers. It has no impor tance as a fortification, as it is in a dilapidated state, and is commanded from several excellent sites for batteries to the north-west, north and north-east. It is closely surrounded by buildings and its water-supply could be cut off. In 1903 the ark contained 10 guns 5 of those were 9-pr. brass rifled, muzzleloading guns mounted on old dilapidated field carriages, smothered in dust and dirt; the remaining 5 were lying about the ground in the topMaweA. There were also 30 artillerymen stationed in the ark. In addition to the artillerymen the garrison consisted of one regiment, nominally 500 strong, but most of the men are away at their houses for the greater part of the year. The regiment is inspected once a year, when the men muster. The men are clothed in ragged uniform, and are generally bare footed. The rifles are antiquated and rusty muzzle-loaders. To the west cf the town, at the end of the spur, is situated a fort which is a much more respectable work. It is a square of about 100 yards, with walls 40 feet high, built on the river-bank ; which is scarped to the north, and the approach to it all round is difficult and steep. If put into good repair, no doubt this place might offer a respectable resistance ; but there is cover close up to it, and the walls and loopholes are in such a state that the former could not be manned. The fort is also commanded by a hill at about 1,500 yards to the east, and is in ruins now. The chief manufactures of Birjand are felts, carpets, and woollen fabrics, copper vessels and leather-tanning. The carpets, for which the locality has long been famous, are chiefly fabricated in the 'Village of Durukhsh about 50 miles to the north-east of Birjand ; also at the villages Nauzad and Sehdeh. These carpets, however, are now held in less esteem ; aniline dyes being used, and cotton mixed with the wool of which they are manufactured. Aniline dyes are now strictly forbidden and carpet manufacturers using them are liable to punishment. Cotton is, however, mixed with the wool. The carpets are very much in demand. Traefe.—The chief trade of Birjand is with Khorasan and Russia, Bandar Abbas and Kirman. Trade with Afghanistan has been practically killed by Persian Custcms (Belgians), and is now a negligible quantity. British trade with Birjand is now said to be nearly equal, if not quite so, to Russian trade. This is probably due to the disturbed condition of Russia. In 1904- 05 the total imports and exports amounted to 1,419 and 1,789 camel loads, valued respectively at 3,05,990 and 2,68,125 rupees. This was, however, a bad year, owing to a cholera epidemic and all travellers coming from Khorasan or Yazd were stopped and turned back, while the people of Birjand deserted the town in lage numbers and sought asylum in the hill villages off the main routes. The chief imports are shirtings (nearly all cotton fabrics are British or European, imported by way of Bandar Abbas), indigo, longcloth, chintz, spices, sugar and petroleum, while the exports are carpets, barak, and kurk (a species of cloth), wool, saffron, and dried fruits. Of late years the trade with Afghanistan had declined considerably owing to the harsh man ner in which customs collection at Sarakhs, Duruh, and Ahwaz were car ried out. The consequence is that Afghans are now generally employing the routes that lead through Turbat-i-Haidari. Birjand is of great antiquity, and though much decayed, is still a place of considerable importance, and on account of its greater proximity to Slstan and the Afghan frontier has supplanted Kaln as the seat of Government of the Kai- nat. Since the days of Nadir Shah up to the time of Yar Muhammad’s death in 1871, Birjand was a dependency of Herat.104 BIR—BRI There is a British agency and a telegraph office with British, Russian and Persian telegraphists in the town.—(Ah^'er ; Yate ; Maula Balchsh ; PFan- liss, 1903; Macpherson, 1906; Gibbon, 1908.) BlR KAUR- A stream, or watercourse, which runs southwards from the hills to the sea through the Bir district of Persian Baluchistan. It does not appear to be of any great size and is dry except after rain. This watercourse is crossed by the telegraph road from Chahbar to Jashk at about 66f miles from the former. It is usually made the fifth stage from Chahbar and tenth from Jashk. Water is obtained from holes in the bed of the watercourse and is plentiful. Fuel and camel fodder moderate. To the east of the Bir is the Napaga Yad plain {q.v.). Goldsmid in 1866 descended for some miles a stream which he calls the “ Tenk ” (Tank). It appears to be the upper course of the Bir {see Tank).—(ZdcMarf’s Baluchistan Gazetteer.) BIRK KHAUN— Said to be a hamlet of 15 houses in Bashakard, 33 miles south of Ma,rz on the road to Anguran.

About | mile south of Budi is a Baluch burial-ground, the graves of which are of brick and stone, some of the superior ones being even enclosed by small stone walls. The climate is intensely hot in summer, 117° F. having been registered at mid-day in June .—{Medley and Massy, 1893.) BUG (No. 1)— A village in Persian Baluchistan, about 9 miles west or west-south-west of Qasrqand, to which it apparently belongs. It is situated on the left bank of the Kaju river {q.v.), about the point where that stream makes its southerly turn for the Bagrband hills. The village of Het {q.v.) is about 3 miles further up the river on the opposite bank. Both villages can be seen from the neighbourhood of Qasrqand, and each appears to be situated at the eastern end of an extensive date grove. HajI Abdul Nabi passed through Bug in 1839 and says it was about 16 miles from Geh over a level stony road and that the cultivation of ( the place must have been very nearly equal to that of Qasrqand. 61 LB N'406 ^ BUG—BUG “ There is a route from Bug direct to the coast at Fazm {q.v.). The first 12 miles appear to be down the Kaju. Then a night’s journey to Pir-i-Garn, a pool of water ; and another night’s journey to coast plains at Sohrkumb (?), thence one stage to Fazm. The road from Bug to Qasrqand is good. Jennings, from native reports, says this place (in 1885) contained 10 houses and 500 sheep, with abundance of wood, grazing and water and as the sixth stage from Bampur and the fourth from Chahbai. BUG (No. 2)— ; ; Elev. 5,674'. A halting-place on the route from Ladis to Sehkuha, 20J miles from the former and 16| miles from Kurgar, the next stage onwards. There is no water here, and the proper camping-place should be 4| miles back, in the river-bed north-west of the Dar-i-Biaban Kutal, where perennial water, grass, grazing and wood, 1-| miles down the ndld, are to be obtained. Here at Bug is grazing, and grass on the hills except in winter ; also wood. The main hills are about 1 mile distant on the right and 3 miles on the left.— {Jennings.) Tighe in 1902 describes this place as a camping-ground in Sarhad, 24 miles south-south-east of Ladis. It consists of a well of brackish water, on the banks of the Bug Kaur, about 4 miles above its junction with the Gazu river.— {Tighe, 1902.) bCgan!— A halting-place in the Pishin district of Persian Baluchistan. It is on or near the Sarbaz river, about 9 miles from the point where it emerges from the hills. Rask {q.v.) on the Sarbaz, within the hills, is 15 miles north-west, passing Baftan village at 10 miles. Pishin is 10 miles east. Bahu Kalat is about 2 stages south down the river. The ordinary camping-ground is south of the river. The road from Baftan {q.v.) leads for 6 miles over the plain on the left bank of the river to which it then descends by a very steep and rocky pass. Having crossed the river it continues through a thick low jungle of tamarisk and caper to the camping-ground, which is reached round a bed of the river. There is a deep pool here. Wood and water abundant, but no in habitants or signs of cultivation. The Bahu road continues down the river, but the Pishin road crosses the river and ascends to an elevated plain on the left bank It is stony and quite flat. After 4 miles a belt of sparse acacia jungle is entered, and at 6 miles the road reaches the outlying cultivation and date groves of Pi shin. Travellers to that place from the Sarbaz villages, however, had better keep along, and camp on the left bank, thus avoiding two crossings.—' {Euan-Smith.)BUGHAU— A village in Makran, containing 20 houses, situated on the banks of the Gvimak Kaur (q-v.). — (Showers, 1902.) BUGSAR— Elev. 5,100'. A camping-ground in Sarhad, 32 miles north-east of Ladls, on the road to Kacha Ktih. It is an open space in the hills, and affords fair grazing. There is a spring of slightly bitter water. BUIKUN (Persian Baluchistan)— A village in Bashakard district. It is the third halting-place from Ramishk on the road to Jashk. BUJD— Lat. 32° 50' 4'; Long. 59° 17' 30'—(S*. John) ; E 51 (Mohi-ud-Din.) A village of Khorasan in the Naharjan buluk of the Kain district, 7 miles east-south-east from Birjand. It is built along the side of alow* ridge which runs down the centre of the Birjand valley. Now, however, it has only some 200 houses. Above the village is a ruined fort and the houses are built in terraces down the slope. It is a picturesque village, and has a large radius of cultivation, chiefly cotton and wheat, with numerous jujube trees, mulberries and poplars. It is plentifully supplied with water by qandts from the Kuh Baqaran hills to the south-east, and supplies are procurable. It has an importance, as being the place whence all the roads east of Birjand radiate, viz., to Herat, Sabzawar (Afghanistan), Fareh, Lash, and Sistan. The village produces annually about 800 kharwdrs, i.e., 13,600 Indian maunds of wheat, barley and millet and could supply a force, ’Abbas ’All maintains, of 500 horsemen. The market rates are :— Wheat 2 mans or 3f Indian seers per krdn. Barley 3 ,, ,, 5| ,, ,, ,, ,, 1 Bhusa 14 ,, ,, 2o-|- ,, ,, ?, ,, { In the Dasht-i-Bujd there is good grazing for camels and sheep and fodder is stored against the winter. The livestock consists of about 80 head of cattle, 1,000 sheep and goats and 100 donkeys. Fuel (unah, mulberry, etc.) is plentiful.—(MacGregor ; Goldsmid -, Euan- Smith ; Bellew ; Mohi-ud-Din ; Mania Bakhsh ; 'Abbas 'AH, 1907.) BUQ— A village in Geh (q.v.) in Makran.

Seen from the west it appears conical in shsupe—(Medley and Massy, 1893.) BUNDARAN (Nala)— A water-course in Sarhad, south of the Gili Kuh. It rises in a kutal of i tbe same name some 3 miles to the north-west of where the road from Jalk to Ladis crosses it. It is about the longest branch of the Hinjirok Nala. Jennings halted here on his journey from Jalk to Ladis, the halting- place being at the junction of the Bundaran and Razzak Nalas ; the latter name is, however, not known here, both branches being called by the same name. Height of camp, 5,855 feet. Water, wood, grass, and grazing abundant. Thousands of sheep and goats in the neighbourhood. The kutal is reached 3| miles from this halting-pi ace, the road following the main ndld. It is an undulating stony plateau, in height about 6,419 feet above sea-level, and is the water-parting between the Hinjirok and Drukan Nalas. Ascent 1 in 50. The main Drukan Nala is to the right and rises in Gili Kutal. A road runs over Gili Kutal to Mashkid, reported bad.— (Jennings.) BCNG— A village in Rudbar (q.v.) in Kirman.BOTGAEDAN— A halting-place in Bashakard, 16 miles from Baim 8 hk, on the road to Bint. Water is obtained from a stream.— (Sykes, from native inform ation, 1898.) BUN-I-KAHNG— Elev. 1,845*. The name of a place at the foot of the hills, which is an excellent halting- place on the road from Rigan to Minab, 10 miles from Kaleh-i-Qantak and 5J from camp east of Kahuri-Daraz, with a total distance from Rigan of 154J miles. Perennial sweet water in river-bed ; grazing, wood and grass abundant.— (Jennings, 1885.) BUN RUD— A tiny hamlet in Makran, 19 miles north-west of Pip, on the road to Maskhutan. It is situated on a river flowing west or north-west.— (Sykes, 1893, from native information.) BUNSIR (Pass)— A pass or kutal over the Sianeh Kuh range, about 13 miles north-west of Isfandak, on the route from that place to Jalk. The summit is 4,786 feet high and is a level stony plateau of shale and sandstone, 100 yards wide, and is the highest point on the Sianeh Kuh, which the road crosses between Isfandak and Jalk. The ascent, which commences as far back as Isfandak, is very gradual and the descent too is easy. All drainage up to this point runs south and south-east to the Mashkid river on the Isfandak plain. All drainage onwards runs north and north-east via, the Kalaghan Nala to the Mashkid river, joining the latter to the east of Jalk on the desert. The following is a description of the pass given by St. John :— “ Our road lay across the plain in a north-westerly direction to the hills, which we entered by an easy pass called the Gudar-i-Bunsir. The summit is about 4,500 feet above the sea . . ...... Seen from the other side of the valley, the Sianeh hills had bolder and more varied outlines than the southern ranges, of whose monotonous ridges of sandstone and shale our eyes had long been weary; but our hopes of something new in geological formations were disappointed, and the only novelty was a welcome increase of vegetation. In an hour’s stroll after reaching the camp ing-ground, a knoll near the path, a mile from the summit of the pass, I found asafcetida in abundance, maidenhair fern growing round springs in the gullies, wild pistachio, and the two most characteristic plants of the lower ranges of South Persia— the broom-like wild almond, and a shrubby heath, which has a curious resemblance to a gooseberry bush covered with fruit.” The road descends from the top of the pass down a tributary of the Bun- sir Nala fora short distance, then turns to the east over an easy kutal to avoid a gorge in the above tributary, and descending joins the main Bunsir Nala here. At about 4 miles from the top of the kutal in this nald is a halting-place called Daff-i-Afi. At 4J miles from this point the Bunsir Nala is joined by the Pork Nala which comes in from the south-south-west. Up this ndld one road runs to Dehak over the Brmjlnan Pass, and another one following this same ndld for some distance at length diverges and runs over the Darpa-110 BUN—BUR thln Pass to DIzak. At 6f miles from Daff-i-Afi the Surkh Nala joins in from the west and from this point onwards the nala is called the Kalaghan. — {St. John-, Jennings.) BUNSUR— A village in Bashakard, about 3J miles south-east of Ramlshk, on the road to Fanuch.— {Sykes, 1898.) BUQ— Lat. 29° 4' 39' ; Long. 61° 3' 0'; Elev. 3,296'. A halting-place in a ndld of the same name west of the Talab Hamfm on the road from Jalk to Ladis. 154 miles from Jalk. It lies at the junc tion of the shorter desert route with this one. By the former, which goes through the desert skirting the hills, Buq is 126 miles from Jalk. Grass, grazing, wood fairly abundant. Water plentiful of excellent quality. The Bhq ndld is a tributary of the Talab river, which itself a tributary of the Mashkid river. From the halting-place onwards up the ndld there is no water. BURABAD—Lat. 29° 5'.

BURJA— A small circular fort in Persian Baluchistan, situated between Rigan and Na’imabad, at a distance of 29 miles (by a very tortuous route) from the fprmer and 10 miles from the latter. When Pottinger visited this place in 1810 he found a village within the fort of 50 or 60 houses. His account of the surrounding country is attractive, and from the snow-clad mountains visible to the westward, the number of running streams and the variety of trees, the scenery may well be, as he describes it, “ beautiful in the extreme.” Amongst the trees he noticed the pipal {Ficus religiosa), mm {Melia azadirachta), babul {Mimaso arabica), and gaz (Indian tamarisk) besides the mango, walnut, and wild almond. He saw barley being cut in this neighbourhood in the end of April, and found the grain still more generally ripe at that early period as he advanced to the westward.— 2,600 {St. John) {Pottinger.)

BURJ-I-GULVARDA— Lat. 33° 3' 30'; Long. 60° 21'.—(Walker.) A stage in Khorasan, on the road from Blrjand to Herat by Fahreh. It is 15 miles from the village of Gazik. Gulvarda is the most northern point of the Tag-i-Namadi : there are said to be customs sowars at this well under the Mirza of Avaz. The Afghans are said to graze right up to Gulvarda , my informant, who was in the service of the farmer of customs before the Belgian ever came, told me that the Persian Customs sowars never ventured further east. A track from Gazik and Avaz to Anardarrah in Afghanistan crosses the Tag-i-Namadi a little to the south of Gulvarda. There is a well called Puzehjanga on this track.— (Keyes, 1904.) BURJ-I-KONDAR— A date-grove in Kirman standing amid some cultivation on the road between Bam and Rigan, 39 miles from the former and 14J miles from the latter place.— (Sykes, 1898.)

It is situated on the west base of a bare gravelly hill, which forms the terminating point of a line of low hills projecting into the plain from east-sou’-east. Below the village is an extensive line of gardens, vineyards, and fields, watered by a most copious clear stream from a canal. The trees are chiefly jujubes and mulberry. Wheat and barley are cultivated in considerable quantity, and some beetroot, cotton and turnips are raised. The village contains about 200 families of Sunnis. The only manufacture is a sort of cotton cloth for shirts,—(MacGregor.)BUZ—BUZ m BUZAIN— A we ll in the Sarhad province of Persian Baluchistan, about 18 miles north-west of Gusht, in the Gad Pusht valley.

CHADDAR JALAN— A cairn of stones in Persian Baluchistan, 11 miles north of Bamptir, on the road to Bazman.— {Wood, 1899.) CHADDAR MIR MAZAR— Elev. 3,710'. A halting-place in Sarhad, 16-J miles north-east of Ladls, on the road to Kacha Kuh. The place is marked by some heaps of stones. There is no water, and but little grazing.— {Sykes, December 1898.) CHADDAR MULLA HAJl— A broad ravine in Kirman, which leads up to the watershed of the Kuh- i-Khul (as that section of the Mukh-i-Surkh-i-Rud-i-Mahirange is called which lies between Gurg and Nasratabad-Sipi) and through which the cara van track from Bam to SIstan runs. The hills on each side of the ravine are low and irregular, and their sides are clothed with red and yellow flowers and strong smelling herbs. Some way up the ravine, where its breadth is about 100 yards, is a spring of fresh water called Kunaruh.- Its waters are not perennial, and run dry in exceptional years. From this point the path rises steeply, and the gorge grows constantly narrower until it is only about 15 feet broad, while its sides glisten with fantastic colours, which appear to indicate the existence of some metals— violet, yellow, and green predominating. About 1 mile above the Kun- aruh spring the gorge forks, the easterly branch leading into the heart of the mountains, while up the westerly one runs the road to Nasratabad. At 21 miles from Kunaruh the pass grows still narrower, and is here called the Gudar-i-Surkhavak. At this point there is a small spring, and the gorge again bifurcates, the caravan route still leading along the westernmost branch. About 1 mile above this the watershed is’reached at an elevation of 4,775 feet. The descent on the north-eastern side of the range is by a narrow winding gorge similar to that just described. About | mile below the watershed is the Darvazeh-i-Nadir (Gate of Nadir), a narrow gap in a transverse ridge of rock not more than 9 feet wide, with traces of walls and rubble towers on each side, said to have been erected by order of Nadir on his return from Hindustan. Three miles from the watershed, the gorge, which increases gradually in width, is joined on the west side by a ravine in which are some tamarisk and date palms and a small spring of fresh water, called Ab-i-Kunji, said to be perennial. Beyond this point the gorge opens out on the eastern slopes ol the mountains, at the foot of which lies Nasratabad-Sipi.— {Dobbs, 1902.) 61 X, B.

Shandak, the next stage on this route, is about 9J miles distant. Here is excellent, perennial, running water in the river-bed, and unlimited peren nial grass of the very best description—square miles of it exist ; and tamarisks and grazing in any quantity. This place is on the Gvarkuh plain. To the south and east are some villages, groups of ghiddns, and kdrizes with cultivation, while two kdri- zes were passed between Galugan and this place.— 1885.) CHAH^ALl —See Chah Hur. CHAH ’ALT— A village in Makran on the Malhran river (q.v.). CHlHAN— A hamlet in the Geh district of Persian Baluchistan. Haji ’Abdul Nabi, travelling in 1839 from Jashk to Geh, reached Chahan in four stages from Karvan, and says it is 8 kos (13 miles ?) from Kurandab (q.v.) and 10 kos (16 miles ?) from Muht, whence to Geh is another 8 kos. At that time there were 20 huts at Chahan, with date groves and running water, so it is perhaps on one of the streams which unite at Kurandab. Yagisbis or Vajbis is probably not far from Chahan. The road from Kurandab is difficult. CHAHAN ASHAHT— Elev. 4,847'. A halting-place in Sarhad, 119 miles east-south-east of Rigan, on the road to Vasht, situated on the west edge of a hdmun, which bears the name both of the Chahan Ashahi hdmun and the Chah-i-Gabi hdmun. There are three wells, holding but little water, and that putrid. Fair camel-grazing is to be had, and a little fuel.—(K% Wood, December 1899.) CHAH ASKAR— A well in the Marz sub-division of Bashakard, situated to the north of the Manujan-Ramishk road, 6£ miles from Kahn MIrza.Close to it is another well called Chah Id.

CHAH-BANU— A well in the Marz sub-division of Bashakard, situated to the south of the Manujan-Ramishk road, 9£ miles east of Tumgiran. CHAHBAR —Lat. 17° O'' 37 // ; Long. 60° 30 / of town. Chahbar Bay is a great bay or inlet, 7|- miles broad at the entrance, by 10 miles in length. The shore on both sides is rocky, with cliffs in places, to about 4 miles from the entrance, but the whole of the rest is low and swampy, and seldom seen from a ship. A range -of mountains runs about parallel with the coast, 8 miles inland from the head of the bay. A high quoin-shaped peak on these, 2,400 feet high, and bearing north from about the middle of the bay, is most conspicuous. Chahbar point is low and rocky, with sandhills, the coast to the east ward of it being of low cliff and rising towards Kinj. CHAHBAR (town)—Lat. 25° 16' 43' ; Long. 60° 37' 7' ; Elev. 30'. On the extremity of Chahbar point is a small square tomb or mosque, and the coast thence trends north-eastward for 1 mile, forming the south side of a little bay, at the head of which stands the town of Chahbar. The south side of this little bay is shoal, with rocky bottom, for two cables off shore, from the Tumban point as far as a little rocky point with a small date clump near it, just outside the fort. Beyond this the beach near the town is sandy ; the best landing is near the date trees. The land rises close to the north of Chahbar village to a high tableland already mention ed ; the south brow is 480 feet high, and it is almost precipitous in places. Its base forms the north side of the little bay in which the village lies, with cliffs near the sea, from miles north of the village to Tiz point, a cliff of light colour, 210 feet high, which forms the north extreme from Chahbar anchorage. The cliff falls back north of this point, running eastward on the south side of a great valley in the hills, and on the north side of this are higher cliffs which trend to eastward away from the sea, leaving the shore low and swampy. Chahbar, called by the Arabs also Shabbar, was taken from the Baluchis by the Arabs at the end of the last century, and held by them until dispossessed in 1872 by the Persians. The town in 1872 was found entirely deserted and gone to ruin, and the gardens left to decay, the inhabitants having removed to Gwadar, etc. In 1873 a Persian, Governor resided at Chahbar, but there is now only a Customs Mudir, and a minor official called a Vali. A ruined fort stands 300 yards from the shore, and around it lies the town. Close and to the south are some gardens with a few fruit trees and a few date palms, extending for i mile inland in a valley lying inside the coast hills. At a short distance to the north-east of the fort is a large white tomb with a dome conspicuous from the sea. There are cocoanut and mango trees, with gardens and general cultiva tion and wells. Sheep are procurable at short notice, and provisions also V 2116 CHA-CHA by constant communication by sea with Masqat and by land with large Baluch villages in the vicinity. Telegraph .—At ^ mile south of the town is the telegraph office of the Indo-European Telegraph Company, available for messages to all countries. It is a fine building with a flat roof. Close to the sea are barracks, hospital, etc., for the accommodation of the British detachment. These buildings are seen across the land when to the south-east of the place. Camping-ground .—At the back of the telegraph office, there is ground suitable for camping some 3,000 men, for whom water could easily be laid on from the existing pipes. There is no mail service, except overland from Gwadar. Anchorage .—The anchorage is with the tomb on Chahbar point south and the white dome east to east by south in 4 fathoms of water with a sandy bottom, 1 mile off shore. Native vessels anchor nearer in, about $ mile off shore, in 2 fathoms. The bay is outside the influence of the south-west monsoon, but there is no shelter from a “north-wester,” which at times renders landing impossible. There is good shelter to the west of the bay under Kuhlab point, but the distance round by land is about 28 miles. Tiz .—In the valley north of Tiz Point, about a mile from the sea, there are a few huts and some trees and cultivation, forming the present village of Tiz. At the entrance of the valley a small hill rises in the middle, on wTiich stand the ruins of a fort, and in front of this is a shallow lagoon, the entrance of which is a mile from Tiz point. It is entered by fishing boats in high water only. From Tiz the coast is low and swampy all round the head of the bay. At 6 miles from Tiz point is the mouth of Kaur Namak, a small river after rain. Has Kuhlab, also called Mutahaddin and Baragin, the west point of Chahbar Bay, is of low cliffs, and has no reef off it; from it the cliffs trend to the north and north-west, increasing in height to a point 3J miles to the north-west, 270 feet high. From this the cliff runs to westward towards Fazim, the low coast commencing in the bay north of this point. Inland from these cliffs it is quite low between Chahbar and Fazm bays. In north-westers native vessels anchor for shelter off Kuhlab point. Soundings .—The depth at the entrance of Chahbar bay is 8 fathoms, and decreases regularly to 6 fathoms off Tiz point, with muddy bottom. To the north of this point a rocky bank extends off shore from 2 to 3 miles, having 2 J to 1J fathoms on its edge and 4 to 5 outside ; it extends to the north for 4 or 5 miles. Has Kuhlab has 3 fathoms at J of a mile off, with 8 close outside, and the cliffs north of it are safe to approach ap to a distance of mile, but beyond them the west and north side of the bay are shoal, there being only 3 fathoms at nearly 2 miles off shore. Directions .—The telegraph office at Chahbar is visible about 8 miles off; the coast on both sides of the entrance is safe to approach, but is not easily seen at night, especially the two low entrance points, which are of light colour.

A volcano in the solfatara stage, situated in the Sarhad district of Per* sian Baluchistan. The name means the “ Mountain of the Forty Beings, ’’ so called after some legendary persons who visited the range and disap peared. It is also sometimes called Kuh-i-Taftan, or “Burning Moun tain.” The inhabitants of the valley appear to have worshipped the vol cano from the earliest times, and at the present day, though Muham136 CHE-CHE madans in name, are Fire-worshippers at heart and still make sacrifices of goats to the spirit of the mountain. Sykes, who was the first European to make the ascent (on Christmas eve, 1893), thus describes the climb : “ Leaving camp at Varaj, for 7 miles the track led up the valley, which then terminated in an extraordinary cleft in the rocks, called the Band-i-Gilu. From this point the climb began, the main difficulty being the steepness and the bitter cold* which latter we especially felt when plane-tabling on the summit, where we arrived about 2 p.m. We could see Sistan and the Gaud-i-Zireh to the north and north-east, while to the south and west the view appeared boundless. The descent was easy owing to the soft lava, and by 9 p.m. we reached our tents again. The valley was full of ruined forts, opposite many of which was an oval chisel-wrought cavern, and as there were no marks of smoke inside them for a while I thought they might be a humble imitation of the tombs at Persepolis, but it seems more likely that they were the Chief’s granaries. The inhabitants said that they were excavat ed in the time of that Kudru Padshah, by which they may mean, Khusru, of the Indo-Iranian epic. In any case this valley Was evidently at some remote period an important centre, and it is a pity that there is no mention made of the volcano by any of the earlier travellers.” Brazier-Creagh, who made the ascent on 31st December 1893, thus des cribes the mountain— ‘‘ The Chehil Tan or Taftan range, situated about the centre of the Sar- had plateau, has a south-south-west strike. It consists of four cone-shap ed peaks, the situations and approximate elevations of which are as follows :— (a) Madar Kuh (or Mother Hill) in the centre, an active volcano, 13,100 feet. From it rich sulphur and pure sal ammoniac are obtained. They form a part of the Sarhad revenue. There are two large volcanic holes from which smoke issues, and several other parasitic volcanoes are seen along the slopes of the cone. A strong odour of sulphur pervades the atmosphere for the last 1,000 feet from the top. (b) The Nair or Nar Kuh (or Male hill) to the west, and separated from the Madar Kuh by a narrow valley. (c) The Ziarat Kuh to the north, shadowing the Madar Kuh, and separated from it by a narrow valley. (d) The Subh Kuh (or Morning Hill). (None of these hills are of importance, and Madar-Kuh is only a volcano which is in the “solfatara” stage of its existence. Jennings is incorrect in speaking of it as an active triple peaked volcano.) The following is a list of some of the geological specimens obtained :— Sulphur. Compact limestone. Pumice stone. Sal ammoniac. Siliceous nummulitic limestone. Argillaceous limestone. Marls, reddish, ochre and khaki-coloured. One specimen of heavy saline dirty yellowish marl, called 'zak” or ** mak ” is used for dyeing purposes all over the country.138 CHI—CHO - f 1^340' (Sykes).

It consists of two villages, the North and South Churak, 2J miles apart. Near South Churak the country is mostly plain, covered with a jungle of tama risk, ahir, and kandr trees, while north of North Churak the hills begin. At both places there are a great number of huts, but not many occupants, as (in 1900) they had mostly taken to the hills on account of official oppres sion.

RCLA—CLA 140 CLARENCE STRAIT— This is the English and only general name of the passage between Qishm island and the coast of the mainland ; it is navigable for vessels, but a pilot is indispensable as it is very intricate besides being incompletely surveyed. The strait may be divided into three reaches. The first is from the east ern entrance between Qishm town and Bandar Abbas to Laft point which is exactly midway between Qishm town and Basidu ; it is 36 miles in length and it contracts from a width of 15 miles at the entrance to only 1 mile in the neighbourhood of Laft. The navigable channel, at its western end, called apparently Khur Masakeh, hugs the Qishm coast, and is for the greater part of the way very much narrower than the strait. The second reach begins at Laft point and continues to a little beyond the village of Guran, a distance, in a direct line, of 17 miles ; its direction is more southerly than that of the other two reaches. In this part the strait consists of two branches which separate at Laft point and reunite slightly below Guran; the western is Khur Masakeh, the eastern Khur Guran or Saiyid Ahmad. Khur Masakeh has a minimum depth in the fairway of 5 fathoms and does not narrow much below | mile, but the banks, which are steep, are submerged and have nothing to mark their position, and this branch is consequently seldom used by pilots. Khur Guran is in places only b mile wide, and its course is winding, but the banks are well- defined for most of the way by mangroves, and the minimum depth, like that . (f Khur Masakeh, is not less than 5 fathoms. The two Khurs are separated by a mangrove swamp intersected by creeks. Khur Masakeh gives access to the town of Khamir near its right bank and Khur Guran to Laft village on Qishm island. The length of both Khurs is over 20 miles, that of Khur Guran being the greater by a few mile:. The third and last reach of the strait, called Khur Ja’afari, reaches from the junction of Khur Masakeh and Guran to Basidu and is 19 miles in length. As Basidu is approached there is a mud flat extending along the shore of Qishm island, and also a shoal in mid-channel by the northern side of which ships pass. There is an anchorage off Laft point which is thoroughly well protected from all winds and would form a good harbour for the largest shij s the bottom is fine sand and shell, and appears to be good holding ground.

DAG-I-YANUS or SHAHR-I-JlRUFT— A ruined city in Kirman situated on the west bank of the Halil Rud nearly opposite Dasht-i-Kush, 3| miles north of the village of Malikabad. Major Sykes has no hesitation in identifying it with the Camadi of Marco Polo’s travels, who, in describing his journey from Kirman, writes thus— “ After you have ridden down hill these two days, you find yourself in a vast plain, and at the beginning thereof is a city called Camadi, which formerly was a great and noble place but is now of little consequence, for the Tartars in their incursions have several times ravished it. The plain whereof I speak is a very hot region, and the province that we now enter is called Reobarles.” The following account is taken from Major Sykes’ “Ten Thousand Miles in Persia ” :— “ In 1894, and again in 1900,1 spent a couple of days on the site of the city of Jiruft, of which Komadin (Camadi) was a quarter, occupying a huge area on the right bank of the Halil Rud. The ruins consist of millions of kiln-burnt bricks, eight inches square, and the surface is littered with frag ments of pottery. I was shown what was evidently the fort, as the ditch was distinctly traceable ; it was square, each side measuring 286 yards. There are some underground chambers which would repay excavation ; there are no lustred tiles, nor could I find a cemetery. A legend runs to the- effect that the city of Jiruft was destroyed by a flood, and this is probable, as not a wall is standing, which would hardly be the case if the city had been sacked and deserted. It is now, in common with other ruins in Persia, known as the Shahr-i-Dugianus, or city of Decius—the Roman Emperor with whom the story of the seven sleepers of Ephesus is connected. “In the history of the Seljuks of Kirman by Muhammad Ibrahim we read that ‘ Komadin was a suburb at the gate of Jiruft, a resort of strangers from Turkey and Hind, and a meeting place of travellers by sea and land, the treasury of the wealthy and the store-house of the east and west. ,T In 1170, just a century before Marco Polo’s journey, it was looted for the first time by Bahram Shah, one of the Seljuk princes. • “ A few years later it was again raided, but had apparently recovered, as it is described as ‘ the abode of men from every quarter, and the store house of the valuables of China, and Cathay and Hindustan, Abyssima and Zanzibar, Turkey, Egypt, Armenia, Fars and Irak.’ This description is of great interest, not only as vindicating the accuracy of the great Venetian, but as showing how widely traders travelled at that period. The Ghazz completed the ruin of Camadi, and when Marco passed through it it was as he remarked, £ of little consequence.’ ”Newcomen states that some 17 miles above the site of Camadi, where the river runs between steep mountains, there are the remains of a natural dam, burst many years ago. This might very easily be restored, and would ■ be capable of storing an enormous quantity of water.— (Sykes, 1902 ; New comen, 1905.) DAHAK— Elev. 5,325'. The 3rd stage on the Robat-Bampur route.

DARUNDA (Village)— The name of a village 1 mile away on the right (west) from mile 35| on the route from Rigan to Minab, between Dehan-i-’Abbas ’All and Mil- i-Farhad, situated on a tributary of the Gishu Kaur—the latter being a tributary of the Kunarnai river. The village has a good deal of cultivation, perennial water, etc. In the ndlds are numerous wild olive trees, oleanders, almonds, tamarisks, Jcahurs, etc., while the valley and hills on both sides of the route are one mass of gr*en (April 23rd, 1885). The village of Darunda (as also the village of Gurai —see article on Dehan- i-’Abbas ’AH) is inhabited by Palangi Baluchis, who migrated here from Vasht (mile 60 on the route from Jalk to Ladis) some 50 or 60 years ago. The headman’s name is ’AH Muhammad. They now speak Persian, and number about 160 souls in both villages. They own 4,500 sheep and goats, 60 donkeys, 60 cows, and a few camels. The Surai village is situated on the ndld of the same name, some 8 to 10 miles above where it joins the Gishu Kaur. See article on Dehan-i- ’Abbas ’AH.— {Jennings, 1885.) DARUSAR (River)— A tributary of the Anguran river (&lt; 7 . 0 .) in Bashakard, which is said to rise in the Band-i-Marz, and joins the Anguran a few miles below the village of that name.

DARVAZEH {i.e., “ the Door ”) (Kirman)— The name given to a passage cut through the perpendicular strata that runs across and bars the road between Gurg and Nasratabad, in Kirman on the Bam-Sehkuha road. It is about 4 farsakhs (about 16 miles) south of Nasratabad. It is said that the Darvazeh had in times past a folding gate, which was guarded by a body of armed men to protect the commerce from Baluchi raids and collect custom revenue on goods passing to and from Sistan.— {Rozario.) DARVAZEH-I-NADIR, see Chaddar Mulla Haj!. DARVlSH KUMB— The Darvish’s hollow. A place on the telegraph road between Kash and Surag, in the coast districts of Persian Baluchistan. It is 7 or 8 milesfrom Kashi and 8 or 9 from Surag. Here water is found after rain in hole in the rocks and generally lasts about a month.—(Pierce.) DARZlN— Elev. 4,360'. A village in the Bam district of Kirman, 16 miles west-north-west of the town of Bam on the Bam-Kirman road. The name is said to be a corruption of Darzanan (which means Gallows-Erecting), because at this spot, according to local legend, Faramurz, son of Rustam, was hanged by Bahman. The village consists of about 100 houses and in 1902 paid 217 iwmaws of revenue, being, for Persia, very moderately assessed. There is a considerable area under poppy cultivation, the seed-heads being enormous and about twice the size of those produced in India. There are also about 500 acres under wheat, of which some 3,000 mans are produced annually. There is a caravanserai and mill, and scattered round the village a number of walled gardens, in which grow vines, fig pear, pomegranate and mulberry trees. About 2 miles to the east of the village a line of mud forts, named Arzerin, Tarkistan, Antuk and Feluku stretch across the valley. They are built of sun-dried brick, but are now in ruins. To the west of the cultivated area lies a small hamlefr called Padva. Darzln was, in the twelfth century, the centre of a well- populated and highly cultivated region ; Zain-ud-Din, who visited it at that period, remarking that in the whole of Ears he had not seen such a spot.—• (Sykes; Dobbs, 1902 ; Newcomen, 1905.) DAS— A village in Kirman, 118 miles south of Kirman by the road fromKirmau on the road to Bandar Abbas. DASHKIRDI— A village in Rudbar (q.v.) in Kirman. DASHKIRDISH— A village in Rudbar (q.v.) in Kirman. DASHT— A name given the coast districts of Persian Baluchistan south of Geh and Bint. They are understood to be Kair and Bir, east of the Rapcfi river, and Karvan and Surag to the west of the same. The whole is also called qibleh, a term referring to the westerly position of this tract with reference to the rest of Makran. The district is not mentioned by Lorimer. In the time of HajI ’Abdul Nabi the Dasht was dependent on Geh, and the Bulidi chief of that place drew the following revenue from it :— Karvan .. .. .. ... 40 Sitarami ducats. Baak .. .. .. .. 40 SSra S ” •• - .. 40 „ Fishermen of the Rapch river .. ..40 ,, ,, Total .. 1.60 ducats which at Rs. 5$ a ducat would amount to Rs. 880. 61 I. B. T154 DAS—DAB This revenue was levied, on the cultivable land, the crops of which are almost entirely dependent on rain. Besides this, the people were accustomed to send 70 camels yearly as “ sodawmna ” or present. The Dasht posts were under the supervision of the chief of Bint, and paid yearly through him as under :— Sadaich Dil Muhammad Singala .. .. 14 ducats. Rapch-Jamah Hot • • .. 55 (Ia!ag (or Kalag) • • .. 35 Tank Shah Beg Singala • • .. 40 Gurdim .. Puzim .. ..20 Parag . • .. 8 „ Tiz .. .. 15 ,, Chahbar (port only) Total .. • •40 227 ducats or Rs. 1,248-8-0. The length of the Daght districts may be nearly 100 miles and the breadth about 20 miles. On the south is the sea and on the north the hill ranges which separate this low strip of country from the somewhat more elevated interior. The Sadaich is the boundary to the west, and the Chahbar district to the east—unless indeed Chahbar is included in the Dasht, which seems probable. The greater part of the tract consists of sandy plains, becoming gravelly or stony towards the hills and rising into sand-dunes along the coast. They are sprinkled with low scrub and bushes similar to those found all along the coast, and in Sind. Occasionally, near watercourses, a few small trees may be found, and there are palm groves on some of the larger streams. There are also hills on or near the seaboard, forming somewhat bold headlands in places, but these are all disconnected from each other, flat sandy beaches and stretches of coast intervening. Tracts of shur hills occur in places. The ports mentioned above are hamlets of fishermen, and not one of them offers a good landing place.* Indeed, from the shallowness of the sea and multiplicity of sand banks, only the smallest native craft venture at all near the land. In the plain there are no villages or hamlets, except a few on the larger vratercourses near the hills (as Karvan ?), but movable groups of mat huts are met with here and there. These are, in fact, camps, and are shifted from place to place wherever the best grazing for the camels and sheep is to be found. A number of watercourses from the hills force a varying course through the sand to the sea. Some of these coming from the interior rise to the dignity of rivers in this dry country. The principal of these are the Kir or Kair, the Rapch, and the Sadaich. The Rapch is perennial, every other water-course dries up in summer, but in the Kair and Sadaich, and perhaps in others, pools of water may always be found. The beds of the rivers are wide and the bottoms soft and muddy. In the cold weather after heavy rain they rise to a great height, flooding the country for some distance on either hand. It is then impossible to cross for some days. {See also under the names of rivers.) * Information regarding them will be found under their own name.The people of the country, known collectively as Dashtis, are mostly Baluch. The Hot tribe is probably the most numerous. They breed camels, sheep and goats, and also pay some little attention to agriculture, but the country is not one which encourages the husbandman. They possess all the Baluch virtues and defects. Haji ’Abdul Nabi speaks highly of their hospitality and honesty. Hie fishermen are of inferior race. The climate of these coast districts is unbearably hot in summer. In winter, from October to March, it is not unpleasant, and, though the ther-. mometer in the shade rises to 90° in the middle of the day, the nights are quite cool. Rain may be expected after September, but rarely falls in any quantities till December. Occasionally there is rain in July and August but not often. The total yearly rainfall is very small. The land line of the Indo-European telegraph runs through the district, and is accompanied, though sometimes not very closely, by abroad or track . In December, January, and February travelling is not difficult. Water is then found pretty frequently. Camel-grazing is abundant and there is some little grass. Supplies, however, except mutton from the flocks of sheep and goats which feed over the country at this season, are not to be had. Fuel is also scanty. After rain camels cannot travel for two or three days, and any of the larger streams may delay travellers for some time .—’Abdul Nabi ; Floyer; Pierce.) DASHT AB— Elev. about 6,600'. A plain on the Kirman-Bandar Abbas road, 20 miles south of Baft, in Kirman. The Dasht Ab plain slopes to the north-east, and scattered over it are a number of small villages and the ruins of others.

DASHT -I -TAGAZ— The name of an open stony plain, covered with grass (in ndlds) ; camel grazing (quite green) and small tdgaz trees, to the west of the Kuh-i-Baz- man, between Dar-i-Ahu Kutal (mile 88 ) and Zahu (mile 109f), on the route from Bampur to Rigan. The Shandak Nala runs along this plains which was evidently once a lava lake, when the Kuh-i-Bazman was once an active volcano. A strong smell of sulphur assails one’s nostrils in the vicinity, and the iron in the soil affects the compass in several places in the valley. From mile 105§ on this route, between bearings 122° and 131°, only low hills are visible'—a depression between the Kuh-i-Bazman and the range Daman-i-Bazman. Through these low hills the road from Bazman culti vation (visited by Pottinger in 1810) runs to Rigan ; the latter meets this route at this point ; by it Pottinger travelled. The plain here is 2 miles wide on the left and some 15 miles on the right. All drainage is from rear to front ; then north to the salt hamun. — (Jennings, 1885.)

The latter is the main Tcdfileh route, and is most used when the Gudar-i-Kafanu is closed, i.e., from December to March ; the kdfilehs then go to and from Kirman via Saidabad. It had such a bad name in 1894 that no one would travel by it, and it had been closed for that year on account of the many raids of Husain Khan of Lar and his gang, who plundered several kdfilehs and murdered the men in 1893.—(Brazier-Creagh, Jana, 1902.

DEHiN, or DEHAM or DAHAN— A village in Persian Baluchistan, about 4 miles north-east of Bint and on the same stream. (See Bint.) Haji ’Abdul Nabi (1839) invariably couples Bint and Dehan together.* Goldsmid passed it in 1866, and remarks that it is not visible from the road on account of the trees. At ^ that time the people had been almost destroyed by a severe visitation of cholera, only about 15 families being left out of 150. Floyer, who * A common practice in this country, as Bam-Narmashir, Bahu-Dashtl&amp;ri, et«. , .passed the place twice in 1876, makes no mention of it whatever, so it is possible there are no inhabitants now, although the date groves, etc., can hardly have been abandoned. The site of Dehan may be only 2 miles above Bint. Goldsmid’s account is not ve'y clear. DEHANEH BAGHI—See BAGHL DEHANEH GAB— A pass in the province of Kirman, between Kirman and Khabis and north-west of the first place.

It has a supply of good water.— {Sykes, from native information, 1898.) DEH BAKRl (Kutal and Valley)—Lat. 29° 3' 5*; Long. 57° 43' 27'. This kutal is »n the main Bam-Khanu road, across the Jamal Bariz or Jabal Bariz range. St. John mentions it as follows :— Here (the caravanserai of Kha i-i-K latun, a couple of miles north-east of the village of T hrud) the eastern road from Kirma i. to Banda • Ab 1 as branches off from the Bam road. This route, travelled throughout by Major Murdoch Smith in 1866, and partially by Mr. Keith Abbott before him, and Sir Frederick Goldsm d afterwards, leads through Sarvistan and the Deh Bakri Pass over the Jamal Bariz range to the plain of Jlruft.” This pass is said to be practicable at all times, and has frequently been traversed by wheeled artillery. Goldsmid, in his route Bandar Abbas to Bam, describes this pass as follows :— “ We had passed early m the day the village of Dasht-i-Khushk, which, as its name implies, marks the limit of cultivation on this side of Deh Bakri, and coming upon * the stony barren slope of the mountain range, had continued our ascent for 10 miles, when we found ourselves at the entrance of the pass, from whence a very fine view of the Jiruft and Rudbar plains is obtained. Our path then followed the course of a mountain torrent between rocky cliffs, till we commenced the very difficult ascent known as the Gudar-i-Sakhtdar.* The summit of this pass, which is 38 miles from Du ad, we reached with difficulty, and passing through a winding valley came into the open plain of Sakhtdar with the Rud Khaneh flowing through it. .. . The desolate caravanserai of Maskun is situated in a hollow on the highest part of the pass, 7,300 feet above sea-level. . . . We found that 2 miles beyond the caravanserai the road makes another steep ascent to the extreme summit of the pass of Deh Bakn, for which the aneroid registered a height of 7,800 feet. Descending by a steep and slippery path, we reached a mile further on the caravanserai of Deh Bakii, which closely resembled that of Maskun, and had evidently been built thus near it to afford shelter to travellers on either side of this dangerous pass in severe weather.” Deh Bakri valley is about f mile broad and 2 miles long, surrounded by low alluvial and gravelly hills. The soil is good, and well-watered by numerous rivulets running down from the west to join the Deh Bakri Rud. A few orchards are scattered throughout the valley, which contains two old cemeteries. This valley, in which the site of the classical Carmana, the most ancient capital of the province, is supposed to lie, was much more thickly inhabited in past years and shows signs of having been more care fully cultivated. It is now but sparsely inhabited and indifferently * Gudar-i-Saqdir.cultivated. There are some 30 huts scattered under the hills. Deh Bakri is owned by the Khans of Bam. Mdlidt, 500 tumdns. Good camping-grounds available in the valley.— [Brazier-Creagh, 1894; Sykes, 1902.) DEH BALA— A village in Ramlshk, about 3 miles east-south-east of the village of Ramishk. It consists of some 50 houses, situated on the Beharug stream [q.v.), with some cultivation and a date grove. Supplies are procurable in moderation and water is abundant and good. The malidt in 1893 was ICO tunidns. — (Brazier-Creagh, 1893, from native information ; Sykes, March 1898.) DEH BALA, see SangOn. DEH GAK— A village on the Ughin stream in Persian Baluchistan.— [Brazier-Creagh, 1893.) DELIGAN (Kirman)— A river in the vicinity of Jamuli, on the Rigan-Minab road. This is the same as the “ Kuhistani ” river. DEHGVAR— A place, or rather a tract of country, in the Talk district of Persian Baluchistan. It is said to be a long strip of marshy ground covered by immense date groves, and situated some 20 to 25 miles north-east of Talk. Gulugar on the Rajab branch of the Mashkid [q.v.) is understood to be about the same distance north-east of Dehgvar. From information gathered by St. John when at Jalk in 1872, he understood the marsh to be caused by the drainage from the hiils—Siahan Kuh, etc.— flowing under the gravelly glacis which here, as in many other places, stretches a long distance from the base of the ranges, and is known as the ddman-i-kuh, or skirts of the mountains. Macgregor, however was informed (1877), that a stream or watercourse, draining Lddis, entered Dehgvar from the west-north-west. Ladis [q.v.) is a district on the Sarhad plateau. It is quite possible that its water comes down here and contributes to form, or is the principal agent in creating, the marshy tract in which the date groves flourish. Between Dehgvar and the Mashkid to within a short distance of Gulugar on the north-west, and right up to the river-bed further south, the country is entirely covered with high ridges of heavy sand. There can be little doubt that the reason why the drainage from the hills accumulates at Dehgvar instead of running off to the M ishkid is on account of the sand intervening. Many examples of drainage thus intercepted may be found round the edges of the Kharan and Shorawak deserts. To the south or south-east of Dehgvar, and in the same line, are similar, but smaller, date groves. The first of these, Ladgasht [q.v.), appears to be some way off, but from that place to Askan, a distance of 10 to 15 miles, the date groves seem to be pretty numerous, though not so thick as those of Dehgvar. The whole of these outlying date groves appear to be in the country of166 DEH-DEH the Reid Baluch, who acknowledge Dilavar Khan, of Dizak, and the Persian Government. The length of D-hgvar, conjectured to be from north-west to south-east, may be 15 miles or even more. Its breadth is probably not great. Formerly there were villages here and also at the other date groves, Lad- gasht, Kalag and Askan; but there are now no permanent inhabitants at any of these places, nor is there any cultivation other than that of the date-tree, which in such places requires but little care. This desolation is caused by the insecurity of the country arising from the constant petty warfare between the Riki Baluch and people of Talk, and the Naushir- vanis and others of Kharan, as well as raids of Sarhadi and Sistani Baluch whom the Rikis are not strong enough to withstand. The groves ’ of Dehgvar are the property of various tribes, Panjguris and Kharanis, as well as inhabitants of Talk and Kalaghan. The proprietors v : sit the place but twice a year, once when the female blossom requires fertilization by the pollen of the male, and again when the date harvest has to be gathered. At other times the groves are void of human life except when temporarily occupied by plundering parties, who ii n( j them well-adapted for concealment and rest before making the final descent on their prey. It is probable that there is ordinarily but little surface water at Dehgvar, and that it is by no means wholesome, but it could always be obtained by digging, and there are said to be wells of good water at Askan and Ladgasht, and at a place called Maksotag, which must be m or close to the Dehgvar date groves. Firewood and camel forage are also procurable at these places. Although St. John and Blanford were at Jalk in 1872, and Macgregor and Lockwood travelled down the Mashkil in 1877, none of them were able to visit Dehgvar, or the similar groves to the south-east. However, General Gasteiger Khan, an Austrian officer in the Persian service, visited Jalk in 1881, and went to a place he calls Mashked, which is almost certainly Dehgvar, though it is just possible it might have been Ladgasht. He calls it “ the furthest eastern boundary of Persia. Gasteiger’s journey was connected with the defence of the frontier. He inspected the forts, planned alterations, and in some instances new works, none of which, however, appear to have been carried out. His account is as follows :— “ After a long inarch of 10 miles, we arrived at last at Mashked, which is situated in a palm forest 4 miles long, without the least sign of human habitation Here com- mence the endless sand steppes, where every sign of the road is obliterated, and only the most skilful can find their way by particular signs.’ Gasteiger’s miles would naturally be German miles (5f English miles), but he seems to consider the Persian farsakh, which is about 3| English miles, as equivalent to a mile. Even at this calculation his distances are always exaggerated. It is certain that neither Dehgvar nor Ladgasht are anything like 37| miles from Jalk. The length of the forest, how ever which he must have got from information obtained on the spot, is perhaps correctly stated at 4 farsakhs or 15 English miles.But to continue :— “ Exhausted by the fatiguing ride, I stretched myself under a palm tree and waited patiently for the arrival of the tents. The troublesome wind drove the sand into our eyes, until it began to rain, which was very refreshing. “ These palm forests are the property of scattered Baluchis, and are now the gather ing point of Azad Khan’s ruffians, who rob on their own account and then run away. At this place the ground is hardly firm yet over the graves of twenty-one persons who died in defence of their homestead last autumn. “There are three ruined fortifications here. One which was built by Azad Khan with walls, ditch, and towers is the best. There are also a few cultivated fields, which are irrigated by two dilapidated canals. The objections to building a fort here are the constant whirlwinds, the bad water in the wells, the most unhealthy climate, and above all the complete isolation of the place, it being 10 miles from any village. In consequence of all these drawbacks, I thought it would be better to build a fort at Jalk than at Mashked. “ As the whole day was occupied in exploring the ground, and we intended to start on our return trip by full moonlight that night, every one sought his bed early ; but the wind which blew like a hurricane, blew all our tents down, so that I had to be in the open air exposed to the moonlight, and was gradually covered with sand. “ To prevent accidents. I gave orders that all fires should be extinguished. About one hour before midnight there was a sudden alarm. Partly aroused from sleep, I looked for my revolver, which was covered with sand, and rushed after the people, thinking it was a surprise ; but soon I heard the word kefier (hyena), and understood what had caused the alarm.” Besides being on the road to Galugan (from whence there are roads to Chagai, Nushki and Kharan, as well as north to Rudbar, etc., on the Hel- mand), Dehgvar is on or close to the direct road from Panjgur to Sistan,* which passes through Askan and Ladgasht to Maskotag, men tioned above. That place is reckoned the ninth stage from Panjgur, 15 or 20 miles north-west of Ladgasht, and 10 or 12 miles from Gaz (q.v.), tha, next stage towards Sistan.— {St. John ; Macgregor; Gasteiger.)

To the north it is open, being bounded by the district of Sarhad, but the division between the two is very ill-defined and shadowy. The sub-districts mentioned above, though nominally dependent on Dizak, are in reality semi-independent; their Sardars pay little or no attention to orders received, and revenue from them is only collected by armed force. . . The total revenue extorted in 1902 was as follows, but in each year it is liable to variation :— Dizak, Sarju, Shastan and Bampusht Jalk and Kalaghan ..

Its general elevation is about 4,000 feet. It contains numerous villages, of which the following may be noted Hushak Bukhshan, Shastan, Sarju, Dilavar Khan, Qadir Bakhsh, Muham- madi, Aspich and Ziarat. All of them possess forts, with_ extensive date groves and cultivation, while the village of Dilavar Khan {q.v.) is the residence of the Sardar of Dizak. Supplies in fair quantities are always procurable, while its cotton is famous throughout Baluchistan, beingDIZ—DIZ 1?5 exported as far as Bint. In 1839 there were said to be 1,000 weavers settled in the district, but it is not known if this is still the case. The climate is considered good, and it shares with Sib and Magas a reputation for healthiness and fertility unrivalled in Persian Baluchistan. The principal routes leading from Dizak are— (а) to Sib, via the Sarandar pass; (б) to Vasht, up the Simish valley; (c) to Jalk, via the Brijnan pass; [d) to Kuhak, via Isfartdak. The inhabitants of the Dizak villages, as of Sib, Talk, etc., are mostly Arbabis {q.v.), a short, sturdy, ugly, but good-humoured and industrious race, believed by St. John to be akin to the Dehwars of the Brahui high land, and therefore to the Tajiks of Afghanistan and Sarts of Central Asia. They are admirable cultivators. Of course the important part of the population, if not the most numerous, are Baluch of various tribes. They own large flocks of sheep and goats and pasture over the hills and unculti vated portions of the country. The chief’s family is of Barakzai Afghan descent, and state that they emigrated a good many generations ago from the Helmand valley—perhaps they brought the original Arbabis with them.

It was reduced in 1734 by Nadir Shah, and with the rest of Baluchistan formed part of the possessions of that conqueror. When in the zenith of his power Nadir Shah bestowed Dizak on an ancestor of the present chief. On the death of Nadir Shah in 1747, Nr‘dr Khan of Kalat became the independent ruler of all Baluchistan. He appears to have confirmed Nadir Shah’s grant, bestowing Dizak on Niamatullah, whose name seems to be still well known in the country. Nasir Khan died in 1795, so that the Niamatullah, who was- chief at the time of Pottmger’s visit in 1810, may have been the same as he who received the sanad from Nasir Khan.’ Haji ’Abdul Nabi visited Dizak in 1839, and relates that at that time the chief was Mir Gajian, who was very popular in the district. His retainers were Damani Baluch {q.v.), a tribe which appears numerous in the whole tract south of Sarhad, from Dizak to Magas. Mir Gajian claimed descent from Shah Niamatullah-i-Yali, a famous saiyid, to whom a shrine is dedicated at Mahun. In the meantime the Persians had again been asserting a right to Dizak (with the rest of Western Baluchis tan), and during the reign of Path ’Ali Shah (1797 to 1834) the country was invaded by the Yazir Mirza ’Abdul Qasim, and a great part of it was temporarily annexed to the Persian dominions. The effect on Dizak was the levy of a tax of Rs. 5 on every hangam, or full water right. Nasir Khan II of Kalat (1841 to 1857) made vigorous and by no means unsuccessful efforts to reassert authority over the territory adjacent to Persia, which had fallen away during the feeble rule of his pre decessor. p ,, Whether he ever got much hold on Dizak is uncertain ; but as uold- smid says, “ these petty Baluch states, instead of uniting under one recog nized head, had no common bond of interest to keep them together, and became the prey of their most powerful neighbour for the time being whether Persia, Afghanistan, or a Baluch Sardar of superior power an ^Prom the time of the annexation of Bampiir in 1844-45, Persia was in a position to enforce her pretensions to Dizak and the neighbouring country, although her only solid title was the right of the strongest Gold- smid about 1863 reported Dizak to be m Persian possession, althoug , according to St. John, it was not brought thoroughly under subjection until 1865-66, when Ibrahim Khan, the Governor of Bampur, reduced the chiefs to submission, freeing them at the same time from the attacks of their enemies, the Kharan Naushirvanis.” Goldsmid says that the chief was Alim Khan, who had been to Tehran and there received his grant of the district in due form. The same authority says that ^ Khan was a grandson of Niamatullah, from which it would appear that the D^ak chiefs had enjoyed unusual longevity for three generation^ But most probably Goldsmid’s informant only meant that Ahm K 1 , wa ecendant of Niamatullah. In 1872 Dizak was visited by Major Oliver her a day or a night m each week.mv-mz iTI St. Jolin in connection with Sir F. Goldsmid’s Boundary Commission. Dilavar Khan was then the chief. Dilavar is described as a dull* heavy-looking man of forty. As before said, he is of Barakzai Afghan des cent. Jalk being his personal appanage, he would appear to be the re presentative of the ruling family of that district (see Jalk) and not a descendant of Niamatullah. Nine years later (1881) General Gasteiger, an Austrian officer in the Persian service, met Dilavar Khan, whom he calls a man of noble and venerable appearance, at Jalk (q.v.). As some consolation for his loss of independence, he had received the title of Colonel from the Shah, and a sword of honour. But no doubt his allegiance to the Persians, like that of all the Balfich chiefs, was compulsory, and he appears to have treated Gasteiger with a want of courtesy, which made the latter very angry. There seems to have been fighting between Azad Khan of Kharan, and the Persians during the intervening period. No doubt the former, who had planted his foot pretty firmly at Kuhak (q.v.)) considerably annoyed Dilavar Khan and the people of Dizak and Jalk. According to Gasteiger, Azad Khan drove Dilavar from his place, and raided the country as far as Bampur. Ibrahim Khan, however, marched against him with a force, and defeated him on the Mashkil, at a spot where he had built a fort, pro bably Gulugan. However, Gasteiger’s statements are so wild that no reliance can be placed on what he says, and St. John distinctly states that Ibrahim Khan defeated Azad Khan six years before his own visit, that is, in 1866, capturing and destroying a fort which Azad Khan had built on the Mashkil, two marches east of Jalk (q.v.), so, perhaps, it is this event to which Gasteiger alludes. However, the fact remains that up to the present time there has been a constant feud between the Persian authorities and the Baluchis, and that the former can only collect their revenue by force of arms. Up till 1892, the Dizak area was controlled by the deputy gover nor of Bampur, through Dilavar Khan, who was acknowledged the prin cipal Baluch Sardar, and through whom all taxes were collected. Dilavar Khan died in 1892, and was succeeded by his eldest son Mir ’Abdullah ; from this date the undivided authority of the Buzurgzadehs declined. Owing to the utter state of lawlessness prevailing in 1901, and the powerlessness of the Persians to prevent raiding into British territory a small expedition, under Major Tighe, in co-operation with Persian troops, was, in 1902, despatched to this part of the country in order to inflict punish ment on the offending villages. Among other places, Dizak was visited, Irafshan taken and the forts of Ashar, Afshan, Magas, and many others blown up and Persian authority firmly established, for the time being, over these border districts. Hogg states that there are now (1909) four claimants to the Sardarship of the Baluch tribes in the Dizak area, viz., Shahbaz Khan, Buzurgzadeh, the rightful claimant; MadadKhan, Buzurgzadeh, his uncle ; ’Ali Muham mad, Baranzi, and Mir Ghulam Rasul, Mir Muradzai.— (Goldsmid, 1871 \ St. John, 1872; Sykes, 1902; Tighe, 1902; Hogg, 1909.)

DURUH— One of the three frontier ndibats of Kain co-terminous with Afghanis tan. It embraces the hilly country north of Asparan, which is bounded on the east by the Tag and mountain range of Atashkhaneh and on the west by the hills west of the Tag-i-Duruh. In a northerly direction, it ex tends to and includes the hamlets of Kahtak and Khushab. The other two ndibats are Julgah-i-Sunni Khaneh and Zirkuh. Very little is known of even the recent history of Duruh. A sanad issued in the reign of Shah Abbas shows that the hereditary kat-khudd of the place at that time was one Mulla ’All Shah. The Akhund family of Duruh and the Duruh people knowm as “ Mulla ’Ali’s ” both claim this individual as their ancestor. The present Naib’s family is sprung from the Khoja brothers who are said to have come from Bokhara during Shah Sufi’a reign. It is not known at what time the family obtained the chiefship of Duruh, but it is believed that till about Mir Asadulla’s time, on account of their connection with the Khans of SunnI-Khaneh they were independent of Kain. r ; The Duruhis say they became Shi’ahs 300 years ago.

The reason put forwaid for A 6 t Zment of olhfr big villages of this strip of frontier is the Turko- nia^r^ds, and it is possible that Asparan should be included in the same 'Aho history of the recent cultivation of Asparan is as follows Q s nr 10 vcars aso one ’Ali and bis father Muhammad, Afghan refugeesBold his share of the ledriz to Kat-khuda Hamza and ’All Murad (TunI) of Sistan for Jcrdns 400 some 7 years ago. The latter worked the Jcdriz for some months with ’Ali and then, having a dispute with him, abandoned it. In 1908, Said Khan (Mamaseni), employed by the Sistan Consulate as Levy Jamadar, petitioned the Shaukat-ul-Mulk for the grant to him of the Asparan Jcdriz. As ’Ali was paying no revenue, the Governor agreed to the grant on the condition of Said Khan maintaining there a post of Baluch to guard the frontier. Asparan, it should be noted, is situated on the direct route from Sistan to Kain that passes through a corner of Juwain to the north of the Hamun-i-Sabari and robberies were frequent. When this grant was made, objection was raised by the Salaris of Neh, the old ruling family of this baluTc, on the ground that they held documents (Mahr-namas) proving them to be the owners of Asparan as well as of Surtigh, Khoja do Chahi and other Jcdrizes in the Duruh-hamun district. Their claim as regards Asparan seems to have been accepted, as they executed a deed making over their rights to the Shaukat-ul-Mulk as pish hash. There were other points regarding the Neh revenue settled at the same time. The man ’Ali, who had been evicted, was given in exchange another property in the Duruh district called Mahrud and he executed a formal agreement accepting the exchange. Kat-Jchudd Hamza and ’Ali Murad do not seem to have put in a claim. Khoja Jan Muhammad of Duruh raised an objection to Asparan being given to Said Khan, as he claimed Asparan as his private property. His claim was rejected as he could bring forward no evidence, while the Salaris’ claim had been held to be good. When M. Miller was Russian Consul in Sistan, it is said that he made endeavours to purchase Asparan from the Naib of Duruh. Jan Muham mad had at that time been temporarily deprived of the Naibship and owing to that it is said negotiations fell through. Their rights to Asparan are, it may be mentioned, altogether denied by the Duruhis, especially those known as Mulla ’Alis. This community say they are Baluch that came fromHamadan in ancient times. The head of the community, Bahran, showed me a sanad of Shah Abbas Saffavi, confirming one Mulla ’All Shah in the Kat-khudaship of Duruh, with which he contends the other hamlets are included. He also holds another sanad to the same effect, alleged to be from Fatteh ’Ali Shah but of this the seal has been torn off. The right of Mulla ’Ali to this sanad is not uncontested. The Akhund family of Duruh state that the Mulla’Ali Shah to whom the Shah Abbas’ sanad was addressed was an ancestor of theirs and that they (Mulla ’Alis) stole it from them. In the present year, Said Khan’s title has been confirmed by the Hissam-ud-Dauleh. There are two kdrizes now open at Asparan, the produce being about 20 Tabriz kharudrs of wheat. According to the Naib of Duruh and all others addressed on the subject, the old political frontier was the Harut Rud. Force of circumstances has caused the abandonment of this line by the Persians, and the Kuh-i- Atashkhaneh is now considered the frontier.184 DUR-DUR 4 Until the country between the Ruh*i-Atashkhaneh and the terminal pillar of the SIstan boundary cdmes to be surveyed, it is difficult to say where a line joining these points would fall as regards Asparan. It seems clear, however, that so far as our personal knowledge goes, the latter place must be considered Persian. A fairly reliable authority has stated that Chah Beg is in Persian limits and Sherak-i-Shah Beg on the Asparan-SIstan road on the frontier. As regards grazing rights, the information given by Captain Keyes in his note of 1st May 1906 has been generally corroborated by other infor* niants. Where rights are undefined, however, as they are in the present case, exact agreement in details cannot be expected. According to informants, even in old days when the Harut was considered the frontier, Afghan mdlddrs had prescriptive grazing rights beyond this to the west. At the present time Afghan mdlddrs have until recently grazed their flocks up to the following points :— Surtigh, Hangur and Hafted Rud (Lahnu), Chah Sagak ; Chah Surkh Khafgas ’AH, Chah Shar. From reports that have beea received, however, it seems that of late Afghan mdlddrs have been discouraged grazing their flocks on the Persian side of the recognised frontier and in some cases have been turned back by the chaurii sowars. This country is also grazed over by the Sistan mdlddrs. The latter do not seem to enjoy any reciprocal rights as regards grazing on the Afghan side. Numerous cases, have recently been reported of Afghans having warned the SIstan mdlddrs back from transgressing the imaginary frontier, and fined them for doing so. As already mentioned, there is a highway from Sistan to Duruh that passes through Afghan territory north of the Hamun. The Afghans levy a Jcdfileh-bashitee on Persian traders and others using this road. In October 1908 a case occurred in which one Mir Husain Sultan, Arab (a servant of the Governor of Kain) was proceeding towards Kain by this road when he was held up by Afghan chaurii sowars at Shorak-i-Shah Beg and certain property was confiscated in lieu of tazkara fees. Another caravan was similarly held up at the same time and close to the same spot. The Persian Foreign Minister brought the matter to the notice of the British Legation, apparently alleging that the Afghan sowars had come 40 miles within Persian territory. As a matter of fact the point Shorak-i-Shah Beg is just about close where the frontier line would run. The Afghans do not seem to take any grazing tax from mdlddrs passing through Afghan territory from Sistan to Kain, but a tax only (possibly unauthorized) of a sheep and krdns 2 to 4 per rama (flock). An old sArHn, whose report may be considered unbiased, stated that the Atashkhaneh range was the recognised frontier of Ehiruh. As regards grazing taxes, he corroborated the Naib’s statement as given above. North of the Kuh -i-Atashkhaneh, Chah Khargosh is recognised to be in Duruh limits, while Damdam and the Dak-i-Tundl are on the frontier line. The Afghan chaunis on this section of the frontier are :—• Chashmeh Khash.—Situated, as far as can be gathered, some 8 miles west to Kala Kah (Sher-i-Kuh). The sowars from this chaurii patrol as far to the west as Shorak-i-Shah Beg.Tundi.—Situated to the east of Kuh-i-Tundl. Taghale-i-Sekchahl.—Situated, apparently, some 16 miles east of Shela, Main-i-Tag. f3,900'— (St. John.) DURUH—Lat. 32° 15' 30' ; Long. 60° 26' 20'; Elev. ^ 1^3,550'— (Mohi-ud-Din.) A village of about 500 houses and some 2,100 inhabitants, in the Kain district of Khorasan, on the road from Birjand to Sistan, and 86 miles south east of the former town. It is situated on the eastern limit of the plains and at the western base of a range of hills forming the boundary between Persia and Afghanistan. From Duruh the plains extend 12 miles west, 9 miles north, and 20 miles south. The roofs of the houses are made of wooden rafters and are not domed like the roofs of the Sistani houses. The hill which more particularly overlooks the village is crowned by a very old and ruined fort, which is said to date from the time of the first Kaiani kings. Duruh is irrigated by six springs of excellent, and three kdrlzes of brackish, water : it also possesses a water-mill and five wind mills. There are a number of walled gardens, containing mostly mulberry, pomegranate and almond trees. In ordinary years the village does not grow sufficient grain for its own use, but in years of good rainfall the pro duction of wheat and barley on bardni land is said to amount to 1,000 Jcharwdrs. Two hundred Indian maunds of 6 Awsa might be obtainable. The people live principally on turnips. At the beginning of 1908 there were in the village 6 horses, 5,000 goats and sheep, 300 donkeys and 200 head of cattle. There is a Customs official stationed in the village for the trade between Afghanistan and the Kainat, and 10 sarbdzes under a vakil with 6 martini rifles. The Duruh valley is a favourite pasture ground of the Iliats of the Kain district, and their black tents are scattered all over the valley, but mostly along the hill-skirts, where water is generally found.' Their flocks of goats and sheep are very numerous, but not so camels and horned cattle. Their goats are of a small breed and mostly black, and shed a soft downy hair called kurk. This is collected, picked and sorted for the manufacture of soft felt, clothes and shawls, according to quality. The sheep’s wool is mostly used in the manufacture of carpets, for which the Kain district has long been famous. Some of the wool finds its way to Bandar Abbas for exportation. The district of Duruh comprises fche villages of Kalateh-i-Bala, Tagushki. Mah-i-Khunik and several others, consisting altogether of about 1,000 houses, and some 6,500 inhabitants, and it is said they can put 800 armed horsemen in the field. The district is under a Naib who is known* as the Sarhaddar.—(C. E. Yate ; Zarudni, 1899 ; Dobbs, 1903 ; Keyes, 1904 ; Gibbon, 1908.)

X186 DUS-DU2 DCSARl— Lat. 28° 26' 47'; Long. 57° 51' iV—{AW)ott). The pi^ncipal \hllage in the Jlruft district of Kirman, situated 311 miles from Bijnabad, on the road to Kirman. It stands on the open plain, some 400 yards from the Kuh-i-Dusari, a jagged limestone range of hills running east and west, and separating it from the lofty Jabal Bariz range, and, though formerly a large village, now consists only of a small fort, a water mill, and afew mud huts surrounded by a wall. The roofs are domed. There is a caravanserai and in 1908 there were five shops. In the winter months, many more people come to live in the place from other parts of the country. One of the houses is in the form of a fort with a very high bddgir. Close under the hills to the north-east is a date grove and a fine spring and 100 huts. Coarse rugs and saddle-bags are manufactured. Supplies in the form of sheep, goats, cattle, grain and forage could be collected in large quantities from the rich Jiruft plain. Camel-grazing is plentiful, and there is abundant water from a kdriz and the spring. There is a Naib-Kalantar. It owes its name to a fight which took place between two forces, one from Bars and one from Baluchistan. The inhabitants of Dusari and the neighbourhood are estimated at 2,000. Later in the year they amount to 4,000. In 1908 there were 900 donkeys, 500 sheep and goats. Besides the owners of flocks, there are many in habitants who live by various trades. Fuel is plentiful.

Several of the houses are double-storeyed, with thick stone and mud walls. The huts are beehive-shaped and substantially made ; the lower 4 feet are stone and mud and the upper part palm-wattling, stoutly thatched with fish palm. The village is very dirty and insanitary.

It is marked by a large crimson-coloured rock, which is now on our right; this rock is called ‘ ‘ Girl, ’ ’ but why it is so named, our guide was unable to inform me. At about the 8th mile the scenery becomes magnificent. We are now confronted with a series of natural weirs or dams, which are formed of stones swept down the hillsides and ravines. These weirs fill up the entire bed of the river and the stones are of every size, shape and colour, snow-white predominating. The track is not confined to one side, but winds about, avoiding as far as possible the deep pools under the cliffs and larger boulders, and the jumbled masses irregularly scattered round. The climb over these dams is a difficult one for192 FAN-FAR animals, particularly so for horses. We had to mount and dismount eVety 10 minutes or so, either to cress the deeper streams or assist our horses over the slippery polished rock and stone. The camels, too, had tough work in many places, and were with difficulty and a considerable expenditure of Baluch bad language, kept on their feet. At 12 miles we got to a clear level bit, beyond which the gorge again closes in and becomes blocked with huge emerald-green, ruby-red and snow- white boulders as big as omnibuses. They have a curious effect, for at first sight it appears as if all further progress up the gorge were impossible. The grandeur of the scenery presented to our view can be but imper fectly described ; lighted up as it was by the fresh morning sun, every con ceivable colour and shade showed, both on the cliff sides, in the deep pools and along the gurgling eddies. One also sees some curious grotos excavated by the force and volume of water, which (judging by the high watermark, 15 to 20 feet) must produce a very effective sight in bad weather, and harmonize well with the wild grandeur of the scene. One longs to dally in such a delightful spot. We now approach the end of the gorge. A bend to the right to avoid a large, deep pool (in which are seen shoals of small fish, like the sardine and chilwa jdts) ; another sharp turn to the left round a huge green boulder, and we emerge from the confines of the Band-i-Nilag range. From this point may be seen the date-grove of Fanuch a quarter of a mile ahead at the junction of two nalas.’’’ The Mirabad kaur, which rises in the hills near the village of Darambakam The Fanuch river main stream. It flows past the village of Mirabad, from which it takes its name, and is joined by the Ziarat and Kanton streams. The main stream then flows through a broad ndla in a south-easterly direction past the large date-grove of Fanuch. The bed of the river at the southern end of the date-grove is 120 yards broad and in November contains a shallow stream, some 18 yards Aimini river wide. The Aimini river, which rises in the Lashar hills and carries off a part of the drainage of that range is seen to receive the Patkun kaur and flow in a west-by south direction through the ndld to the west of the grove.

Inhabitants Balm hi they are said to be wflling to undertake servant’s work. Between the village and the river is a considerable palm-grove, with quantities of pomegranates beneath the date-palms, while more to the east is a patch of old tamarisks watered by an irrigation stream of excellent water. Still further to the east is a large stretch of ground under wheart. Excellent and abundant water from kdnzes. On the other side of the river, opposite the village, there is a small zidrat called Khizr, surrounded by palm trees, and with a curious natural cone- shaped mound in front ; and about 1 mile down the stream a great round ruined clay fort called Kaleh-i-Sang. Here the Kuh-i-Kaput ends, and about 2 miles further to the north-west, out in the Lut, is a low range of hills called Zang-i-Ahmad. Fehraj is a place of great antiquity and has been identified by Colonel St. John with Pahra, the ancient capital of Gedrosia. It was here that Alexander met his heavy baggage and elephants after his march through Baluchistan. The Governor here lives in the Fort, which is garrisoned by about 200 sarbdzes. Supplies are available in fair quantities while the village can furnish 50 or 60 labourers at 1 krdn per cfay ; 50 donkeys are available for hire at 15 sfidhls per day and also 6 camels.— { Jennings, 1885 ; King Wood, 1899 ; Dobbs, 1902 ; Ogilvie, 1906 ; Gibbon, 1907.)

A sub-division of the Bampur district {q.v.) in Persian Baluchistan, also a village, the chief place of the name, about 15J miles east of Bampur. Since its new fort was completed, the village has become the principal place in the Bampur district, and is now the residence of th6 Governor of Bam pur and Baluchistan for the greater part of the year. Coincident with the waning importance of Bampur, Fehruj has increased. The village now consists of some 400 houses and huts, some of sun-dried brick, but the majority of palm-leaf ; the greater number are on the east side of the fort, some are scattered throughout the date grove, some under the ruins of the old fort on the north of the grove, about 300 yards behind the new fort. Besides the above, there are two isolated Baluch hamlets with date groves and cultivation, situated one and a quarter miles north-east, the other named Nukabad, half a mile south from the fort. The date grove is extensive, and large tracts of cultivated ground are seen all round and in it. The fort was built about 1892, and is in a good state of repair. It is not a place of any strength, being merely a fortified caravanserai, about 80 yards long by 80 yards broad, with seven towers. It contains a burnt-brick house, known as theShah Nishin, besides store-room, stables, and quarters for the Governor’s staff and for the troops. The regular garrison consists of : • 2 Sultans (captains). 2 IS!aibs (lieutenants). 4 Vakils (non-commissioned officers). 200 Infantry. 50 Artillerymen. 50 Savdrs. 50 Jamkaz (camel corps). 16 Band (only started in 1892 by order of H.

As the town is about 300 feet Climate. higher than Bampur, and is built on rising gravelly ground, away from the river-bed and the jungle, its climate might naturally be expected to be somewhat better, yet the people say that there is no difference between the two places. There is no grass obtainable; there was not a blade in the whole Grazi district in November 1893. The grazing spoken of by some travellers must be applicable only to camels, sheep and goats, which mostly feed, in the winter, on the leaves of trees and shrubs. About 48,000 Indian maunds of wheat and barley, 1,200 maunds of maize, Resources. 300 maunds of rice &gt; an(i maunds of beans are produced annually.

A village of Khorasan in the buluh Sunnikhaneh of the Kaln district, 41 miles east of Birjand on the road to Herat. It is situated on a small hill about 200 or 250 feet high, but it is commanded by hills to the north and west within cannon shot (point blank). Another hill to the southward, on the opposite side of the ravine, is about 1,200 yards from the summit to the walls of the fort. This fort is of stone and was built about 130 years ago by Mirza Baka Khan. The building itself is a parallelogram, with three tiers or ranges of buildings, the foundations and lower half of the walls and houses being of undressed stone and lime, and at the upper and inner parts partly hewn from the rock (limestone) on which it stands. The upper portions of the walls, houses, and battlements are a mixture of stone, mud, and crude brick and in some places are of mud and raw brick only, which is already crumbling to pieces. At the angles of the walls there are round towers of stone and crude brick, loop-holed ; as are also the outer walls. The whole, however, is clumsily and unskilfully built, and a few rounds of shot would probably bring down an entire side of the structure. The gatewayis on the eastern198 FUR—FUS side ; partly covered by the houses of the village, but without other defences. Within the fort there are three tanks, said to be sufficient for the supply of a large garrison for a year and a half.

T ^ -m - The fort was built by the ancestors of Mirza Ibrahim Khan, the present Naib of Sunnlkhaneh and Chief of Furk and Darmian, etc. ^ A large store of corn is usually kept here, and the g^nanes can Md from 2,400 to 2,600 kharwars (the kharwar here equals 320 16). Ihere is storage in the fort for 30,000 men for one month, and there are plenty of donkevs procurable for its transport where necessary. There is a garrison of 30 sarbdzes or Persian infantry in the fort. The gardens ^rmsh a con siderable quantity of walnuts, and some of the trees from 30,000 to 40,000. The barberry (ziriskh) is cultivated in large quantities, and the fruit export ed to the east.

Its true course is not known, but Galindo is of opinion that the river which is shown under this name on St. John’s map as emptying itself into the Arabian Sea to the south of Guh Kuh, and a stream which he himself struck in the neighbourhood of Gwatar are one and the same. That portion of it which was explored by Galindo meets the Minab- Bint road some 21 miles east-south-east of Parman, and here its bed is very rocky and broken—a typical example indeed of all the Bashakard streams. Galindo gives the following description of it :— ‘ ‘ The country consisted of great waves of up-tilted strata—sandstone in huge slabs, turned up at an angle of 50 or 60 degrees. The stream had forced its- way through these ridges in a series of sharp zigzags. Where the channel cut a ridge at right angles there was always a barrier of huge reefs of rock. Then it would turn abruptly to right or left and flow between two ridges, in a bed consisting of a smooth slippery trough of stone, till it broke through the next ridge, and so on. At almost every curve the bank on the concave side was a perpendicular scarp with a deep pool of water at its foot and the convex side a sort of moraine of huge boulders. The ridges of strata rose on either hand in confused masses of precipitous broken rock from 100 feet to 200 feet in height.” See also Jashk district.— {Galindo, November 1888.)

GARl DARAP— A settlement about 10 miles west of Bint, in Persian Baluchistan. It is on the Gan stream, the name “ Gari ” meaning “ river hollow.” The stream is dammed here and the water led in canals through extensive date-groves and fenced fields of beans, coarse tobacco, and wheat. Rice is also grown as a summer crop, and cotton is plentiful. Coming from the westward this place seems quite a delightful oasis after the sea of barren hills. Its irrigation is quite scientific, and there are many small well-built bndges. The walls of the fields and gardens have the appearance of being bufit of English bricks : so regularly square are the pieces of sandstone of which they are composed. To the north is a many-coloured mountain, w ici 00 s as i it lad been struck by lightning; boulders the size of a house lying about it anyhow, One canal, dug to bring the water direct from higher up the river, is upwards of a mile in length, and is crossed by two strong bridges of mud and stone. The river-bed is very broad and shingly, and studded with bushes. Below the dam it is white with salt and about 400 yards across. The water retained by the dam appears to stand all the year round, judging by the presence of a great deal of water weed. Mosquitoes are also present in large numbers^ in summer, and on the tops of neighbouring hills are many “ siriks” or unner- storeyed huts, m which the people sleep to escape their attacks. The principal man in the place (1876) is Abd-ul-Kadir, elder brother of Mir Haji of Bint (g v.). He is a corpulent, unhealthy looking, and apparent, ly stupid man, who resigned the chiefship to rusticate here. Most of the inhabitants are slaves or servants. There are only two or three families of any importance. All the way down the valley from Daiap are villages with cultivation and palm-groves.— (Floyer.) GAR! KAUR— &gt; A stream m the Bint district, Persian Balfichistan, which is supposed to rise in the Band-i-Nilag range.

In the cold Season it has a rapid flow of water, about 50 feet wide and 1 foot deep. The river-bed is several hundred yards broad. It is shingly and studded with bushes. There are numerous villages on or near the Gari. Going west ward from Bint those near the road are : Rindag, Tarampog, Rah Gudar, Dastur, and Garr Darap ; the last named is about 10 miles from Bint town! Here the river is dammed and the water drawn off for cultivation. All the lower part of the Gari valley appears to be populated, and is fertile for the country.— (Floyer.) There is another Gari to the south. (See below.) GARI KAUR— A stream in Persian Baluchistan, crossed by Floyer’s route from Kashi to Bint. It must not be confounded with the Gari near the last named place. This Gari is north of the Sihran hill, some 16 miles from Pngunzi camping-place, on the Kirman Kaur. Ihe road makes a steep descent to it.— (Floyer.) The Gari goes eastwards and appears to belong to the drainage system of the Rapch. It probably joins the Sartapi. There appears to be water in the Gari, though this is not expressly stated. GAR-I-SAFlD — See Siah Kuh. GARISH BAKU— A high kutal in Bashakard, over which the Minab-Bint road runs 4:7i miles from Minab.

An old ruined fort stands perched on a conical hill to the south-west of the town. There is some cultivation as well as large date-groves. The village possesses about 200 cattle and 500 sheep and goats, but supplies, except dates, are scanty. The water-supply is said to be good and plentiful in ordinary years, but when Medley and Massy visited the place in 1893, owing to the drought, water had to be obtained from shallow wells in the river-bed, which though sweet, was muddy.

This camp is probably situated on the river called Guzhistan on the Survey of India Map, which runs into the Mashkil, nearly opposite Kuhak.— {Hulseberg, 1902.) GAZBUR— A hamlet in Kirman, situated in a valley, which runs up in an easterly direction from Mil-i-Farhad, on the Rfgan-Bandar Abbas road. It is approached by a path, which is with difficulty traversed by camels, up a rocky and steep river-bed, down which runs a perennial stream. The valley itself is fertile and well cultivated, and the hamlet consists of some 20 huts, situated in a small date-grove, and occupied by Balu chis. Supplies are procurable in small quantities. This village, and also all those lying between it and Deh-i-Gao on the Rigan-Bandar Abbas road, are under Taz Muhammad Khan, who again is subordinate to the Governor of Rudbar.

A flourishing village built on a stream in the Sunnikhaneh sub-division of the Kain district of Khoiasan. It lies on the road from Blrjand to Herat, and about 55 miles east of the former town. It is situated in an amphitheatre about 2 miles in diameter, surrounded on all sides but the south-soi th-east by hills. It consists of about 500 to 800 houses of Tajiks, who are all Sunnis. The cultivated land lies in a broad belt along the river, which here sweeps round a shaley spur in almost three-quarters of a mile, and must comprise about 1,500 acres of land, which in October 1903 was rich with millet, beetroot, cotton, hemp, etc. Silkworms are reared and a coarse sort of silk is manufactured. There are about 10 shops in the village. A considerable trade with Afghanistan in dried fiuits, hides, wool and ghi passed through here at one time, but at present (1904) owing to the oppression of the local officials, most of the trade seems to have been directed to Turbat-i-Haidari, where since the establishment of a British Consulate, Afghans can obtain justice. Large numbers of people from Gazik go to work on the Russian rail roads as coolies, etc. There are 20 sowars of the Governor-General stationed in the village. Gazik is irrigated by four good kdrizes : the river does not contain water except after rain. There are a considerable number of gardens about the village, in wffiich are grown mulberries, pomegranates, and almonds. ’Abbas ’Ali in 1907 estimates the population at 300 families or roughly 2,000 souls ; the live-stock at 500 head of cattle, 4,0C0 sheep, 500 donkeys and 25 horses.

A halting-place in Persian Baluchistan, 22£ miles from Isfakeh, 12 | from Chah Gaz and 9 from Qasimabad. There are two dug-out shallow pools here which contain impure, undrinkable water, having an intensely sickly saline taste which is « 1 I. B. 2 A210 GAZ-GAZ persistent for some considerable time after tasting it. Neither horsea nor camels would drink it. The vicinity of the pools for a quarter of a mile round is hard and crusted as if frozen, cracking under the feet; this is due to the earth being impregnated with this saline stuff (carbonate of lime ?). In parts, the neighbouring ground is covered with a thick efflorescent layer of the same substance. It is now abandoned as a halting-place by fcd/iZe/is, no water being avail able. The pool is said to last until the middle of April, but the water, brackish and indifferent at best, must become worse as it dries up. A few stunted “ pir” bushes in the neighbourhood offer inferior fodder. At this place the tracks to Isfakeh and Maskhutan divide. The former is on the road to Chahbar via Kb and Geh, the latter on that to Fanuch. Isfakeh is about 23 miles distant: Baluchan Chah, on the other road, 14 or 15 miles. On the 28th January 1876 Floyer found the pool at Gazkuk covered with a thin coating of ice, and before reaching Maskhutan he was over taken by a severe snowstorm. This testifies to the cold which may be experienced in the Bampur desert in winter.— (Grant ; Floyer ; Brazier-Creagh, 1893.)

The formation is of white limestone, brown sandstone, and red, pur- ple, grey, green, and blue shale. The ascents and descents are bad and impracticable for wheeled carriage. The road, however, down the Sarnai river from mile 187| thence turning the Palanish-Gazuki range (instead of crossing the Gazuki kutals), thence via the village of Kariun to ths sea, is reported to be available for guns.— (Jennings, 1885.) GAZZAQ or GAZAK— Lat. 27° 34' 42'; Long. 59° 50' 14' ; Elev. 1,901'. The name of a halting-place, on the banks of a broad flowing stream of the same name, a tributary of the Bampur river, at mile 5l|, on the route from Bampur to Rigan, between Kaskin and Dar-i-Kishkin. Here is a grove of date palms and perennial flowing water ; grass, wood and grazing also, in abundance. Previous to the present year (1885) this place was largely cultivated by Shadost Khan, Bamari Baluch, of the Burhanzai section. Since his death it has been deserted. A straight road runs from here to Bampur via Chah-i-Kudu (q.v.). — (Jennings.) GEH— Elev. 1,504'. Is an extensive district in Makran, the capital of which is a large and important village of the same name. It extends north as far as Takht Malik, which is 6 miles south of Sarhai; southwards it extends to the sea, Chahbar being a dependent. The eastern and western limits are the Rapch and Kaju rivers, respectively. The district is a hilly region consisting of broken plateaux, with an elevation of not more than 2,000 feet above sea-level. The Lashar and Shigim hills separate it from the low-lying Bampur district. It is drained by the Geh river, which is formed by the junction of the Gung and Kashi rivers just below the plateau on which Geh is situated ; 6 miles further south it receives the large Sarhai stream. The Gung river rises from two sources in the Shigim hills. The western Sources of Gang river. stream flows by the village of Abudan, and the eastern si ream by the village of Kuch ; uniting a little way north of Shigim village, the river flows through the large nala 2 A 2212 GEH—GEH on the west of Geh date grove.

The east- ^ . ernmost stream passing by the village of Rung Sources of Kashi river. . -i . u 7 1^.1 is named the Rung kaur, and the north-east stream the Darkhan kaur ; uniting, they flow through the ndld east of the Geh date grove. The Sarhai river rises from springs in the date grove of Sarhai; it receives Sources of Sarhai river. the southern drainage of the Lashar hills. The Geh river, winding through the Makran hills, emerges on the Dasht The Geh river or Kaur-i- plain, and finally enters the sea at Ras Gurdim, Geh. some 35 miles west of Chahbar. The town, or rather village, of Geh is a large and important one. It is , ... 115 miles from Bampur,w'dPib the principal town in Lashar, and 85| miles from Chahbar. It is the first place at which a force proceeding from the coast to the interior can obtain supplies in any quantity. It is fairly fertile and well watered. Good crops are produced here and in the, district. Geh was formerly the ancient capital of Makran, and was the scene of many a toughly fought battle be tween the Belopi and Gichki tribes. The former, being conquerors, held sway as far west as Bint, and south over Sura.g, but owing to internal strife, this latter place fell into the hands of the Persian,s t in 1848. The town is situated in an extensive date grove at the junction of two rivers, namely, the Gung and Kashi, the former or westernmost of which is the largest. The villages consist of some 500 houses and huts ; the former arc oblong, flat-roofed, and strongly built, and are mostly situated to the north of the grove. Many of the huts are scattered throughout the grove, and are for the most part circular, average diameter 18 to 20 feet, height 10 feet, and dome-shaped; they are formed of a stout framework of date branches thatched with pish palm and covered with a network of fish raping. n t: st- I c r * t 1 a.

There are at Geh— 10 weavers. 2 carpenters. 5 leather workers. 1 Hindu trader. 3 iron workers. Supplies. Fairly plentiful. Sheep, fowls, milk, and eggs, grain, forage Supplies, produce and live- and vegetables can be procured according to the 8tock • season; barley was sold at 25 lb per rupee in October 1893. . Tlie spring crops are wheat, barley, and beans; those of the autumn are rice, cotton, jowari, dates, and ispost (lucerne). The vegetables are onions, beans, radishes, turnips, and brinjals; wild celery and wild rhubarb is also found growing in the district. A few mango mulberry, fig, and pomegranate trees and the vine are found in the larger villages of the district. ° Large flocks of sheep and goats, with a few cattle, are seen grazing along the hillsides and valleys, but a reliable estimate of the number in each flock belonging to the villages could not be ascertained. Camels are plentiful and a number of sturdy donkeys were seen. * The Brahui or hill camels are bred in the neighbourhood of Geh, and are Camel-breeding localities. strong, wiry, sure-footed animals, well used to hard work over these hilly regions. Other camel-breeding centres in the buluk of Dasht are Surag, Balak, Karvan Sadaich, and Kunarak. 5 ’ There is a regular trade from Geh; sheep, wool, cotton, ghi] wheat, barley, Trade and resources. rice, hides, dates, and pish palm being export- . # e d- I hey are taken to Chahbar and exchanged for piece-goods, powder, iron, lead, dried fish, spices, etc. Notwithstanding the great heat between the months of April and Octo- Climate. ber &gt; . the district appears not to be unhealthy, . , . judging by report and the general appearance and physique of the inhabitants. It is woithy of note that, considering the mose proximity of rice cultivation to the habitations in Geh, Nukinga Maluran, Ichan and other villages, where the fields are flooded for days by irrigation (both when the young autumnal crops are above ground and again when preparing the ground for spring crops), there is little, if any, fever; in fact, the inhabitants here are singularly free from any malarial taint.GEH-GHA 215 several smaller hamlets, about which no detailed account is available. Tf we estimate the latter at, say, 30 houses, this makes a total of 1,919 houses. Supposing each house to hold five inhabitants, we get an approximate population of 9,595 inhabitants, irrespective of nomads.— (BTCLzier-CTecLali. 1894.)

The name of a halting-place, on a river of the same name, a tributary of the Kunarnai river, at mile 126f, on the route from Bampurto Rigan, between the Zahu and Kunarnai rivers. Grass and grazing here are good and abundant, also en route. A tamarisk jungle exists in the river bed ; water is scanty and brackish, from a spring. Allround, the country is of volcanic formation. Here the southern edge of the Kirman- Narmastir desert is separated from the Bampur desert (the latter draining into the Milan-i-Jihun) by the range of hills, which is a continuation to the north-west of the Daman-i-Bazman (g' v.). Pottinger visited this place in 1810, i.e., within three days of 75 years ago (1885), since which time no European has been here.— {Jennings, 1885.) GEHt)— Elev. 7,000'. A village in Kirman, situated on the banks of a stream of the same name, 15i m iles south of Rayin, on road to Dar-i-Mazar. It consists of only a few huts. Good water is obtained from the river.—(ATassv and Medley 1894 • Sykes, 1900.) GERAN— A tiny hamlet in Bashakard, said to be on the Tutan river, about 40 miles south-west of Fanuch. The survey of India map, corrected up to 1900, shows a village of this name on the Kutaich river, which flows north into the Jaz Murian Hdmun, about 20 miles north of Tutan. It is uncertain which is correct.—(Sykes, 1893, from native information.)

GHANAN or GHINAN— A mountain, 16 miles to the north of Bandar Abbas, about 6,900 feet high.— (Stack.) GHAR GISHTAR (Persian Baluchistan)—Lat. 26° 49' 18' ; Long. 63° 16'' 20' ; Elev. 3,465'. A camping-ground on the Gwadar-Jalk road, 22J miles from the Kesri ndld, situated in a plain of the same name.— (Jennings.) GHAR-I-KILAR (Kirman)— A noted white stone knoll, situated in the centre of the Hinjiruk river bed, 10 miles north-east of Gaz.— (Jennings.) GHAR (River) (Ghar plain)— The Ghar river, a tributary of the Mashkid, rises at Bansar Kutal, between the Shuraband and Rizaband ranges in Bampusht, at mile 235J, on route from Gwadar to Jalk. It flows in a westerly direction, then curves to the north, over the Ghar plain and Barah Solih plain. This stream runs more or less parallel to the route Gwadar to Jalk, from mile 210 to mile 232 on the above route, between Kesri ndld and Askan, and crosses and re-crosses the road.— (Jennings, 1885.) GHAURIAL— A village in Kirman, 13f miles north-east of the city of that name, on the road to Khabis.— (Galindo, 1887.) GHAUR-I-TALKAB— Elev. 5,526'.

Vide Kuh-i-Chehil Tan.— (Sykes, 1894-1902.) GHAURKtJH— A small group of hills in Persian Baluchistan, 4 miles north of the Pustu pass, and 14 miles south of Bampur, lying on the kdfileh track to Qasr- qand. It is surrounded by sandhills. There is no water in the neighbourhood, but, if wells were sunk, an ample supply could probably be obtained. — (Janes, 1900.) GHAURRtJKl KUH— Elev. 700'. A small hill in Makran, between the Bahu and Dasht rivers, and about 10 miles south-east of Bahu Kalat. There is said to be good water pro curable 2 miles north-east of Kuh Ghurruki.— (Janes, 1900.) GHISHKAN, RUDKHANEH-I- (Kirman)— A small river between Panab and Rudkhaneh-i-Duzdl, on the road from Bandar Abbas to Bam via Khanu— (Euan-Smith.)ghTstan— A halting-place on the border of Persian Baluchistan in the Pishin district. It is the second stage south of Pishin, on the Gwadarroad. The former is 21 miles distant, with an intermediate halt at Kastag, 10 miles * Gvar Manzil (q.v.), the next stage south on the boundary between Kalat and Persian territory, is about 11 miles distant. Ghistan appears to be situated at the lower end of the Kastag plain or valley. Somewhere in the neighbourhood is a small village and patch of cultivation owned like Kastag, by people belonging to Pishin. The whole valley is there fore considered to be in Persian territory, although it is on the Kalat side of the watershed between the Dasht and Bahu rivers, which is the general boundary. There is water in pools at this halting-place, but the supply is some what precarious, and would probably be altogether wanting in summer. Grass and firewood fairly abundant. The Siah Kuh {q.v.) is 4 or 5 miles to the north-west. The country is described as very desolate, but affords grazing to flocks of sheep and goats, A mile south of Ghistan the road enters a wide gorge and follows the bank of a torrent for 8 miles to a high plain situated on the right bank of a ravine called the Kastag Kaur. Gvar Manzil is in the ravine 2 miles further.— {St. John ; Euan-Smith.) GHlSTlQlN— Lat. 26° 41'; Elev. 2,800.'—(£*. John.) A miserable little village, with a tiny fort in the Bampusht sub-dis trict of the Sara van province of Persian Baluchistan, about 20 miles south east of Murti, inhabited by Rinds and Baluchis, the latter living under the protection of the former. Little procurable here, except dates. {St. John \ Sykes, 1893, front native information.) GHISTlQAN (Nala) (Persian BalOchistan)— A few miles south of Jalk.— {Jennings.) GIAN! NADI— A halting-place in Persian Baluchistan, 12 miles from Chahbar, on the road to Jashk.— {Kennier.) GIB (Kirman)— A perennial stream, about 15 miles north-north-west of Minab, flowing to the sea.— {Jennings.) GlDlCH— A considerable stream in Persian Baluchistan, draining the country between the Pasga {q.v.) and the Sadaich river. It is supposed that the Gidich originates in the Band-i-Nilag range, but it is also possible that it rises beyond it in Ramishk, south-west of the Bampur plain; it ma^ even receive some part of the drainage of the western end of Bampur. Floyer crossed the Gidich in 1876 on the road from Bint to Jashk, at 36 or 37 * Euan-Smith. The route given by St. John, on Euan-Smith’s authority, makes it 13 miles. But from the map it is probable that 10 miles is correct. 61 I. B. 2 Bmiles from Bint and about 7 miles from the Tcafileh camping place, on the Pasga stream. (See Pasga.) On to the Sadaich river (q.v.) was about 23 miles south-west, over a shingly plain. About this point the Gidich, flowing south from the direction of the Band-i-Nilag, bends east, and is crossed at about 9 miles from the Pasga camping place above- mentioned by the track leading south to Kashi and Karvan. It continues an easterly course, and receiving the Pasga, falls into the Bapch or Bint river (q.v.). The Gidich is described as a noble stream. Where crossed by the Kashi road its valley is a mile wide, and quite straight for 5 or 6 miles. The hills on each side slope down to a broad belt of fine tamarisk and other trees, between which runs the smooth dark blue river. In January 1876 it was about 60 yards broad, with an average depth of 2 feet, and a velocity of about 5 miles an hour. The river bed is in places large shingle, in others partly vertical strata of hard blue clay. It is from this clay, ‘ ‘ gil, ’ ’ that the river is said to derive its name, the “ Z ” suffering a not uncommon change into il d The clay being porous is used for making water- bottles. (See Bint.) Just to the right of the crossing place the river rushes down a natural weir, caused by the projection of a stratum of the blue clay, which is almost of the consistency of rock. The water of the Gidich is good. Firewood and camel forage being abundant, a very convenient halting-place might be found on its banks. The stream is said to be perennial, but the volume of water diminishes considerably in summer. Like all rivers in this region it is liable to floods, which occur in winter. It may then be impassable for a day or two. As a rule, there is no difficulty in crossing.— (Floyer.) GlK— A village in the south-west corner of Makran, Persian Baluchistan, a few miles east of Jashk on the coast.— (Kennier.)

There were formerly a few huts and a little cultivation, buthese have now disappeared, probably owing to the depredations of the Bashakardis. There is, however, a small perennial stream of good water, and abundant camel-grazing and fuel.—(iVa^wer, 1899 ; Grey, igOS.) GINAU (Kutal)—Elev. f [ Jennings). 11,645— {Grey). A kutal in Kirman, which is crossed by the road from Minab to Rigan, about 70 miles from the former place. It is a depression between the Ginau Kuh—the south-eastern extremity of the Dast Kird-Kishit range, and the Pa spin Kuh at the north-western end of the Marz-Shahrl range, and is impassable for wheels in its present state. A little blasting and pick-and-shovel work would, however,, make it practicable for guns.— {Jennings, 1885 ; Grey, 1905.) GINAU— A village in the Shamil district {q.v.).

GlRANRIG— Elev. 3,200'. A halting-place in the Narmashir district of Kirman, about 45 miles; north-north-west of Kalanzau, and 40 miles south-southreast of Rigan, on the road between the two. Some fuel and forage is procurable, but the water-supply is scanty and uncertain.— {St. John, 1872.) GlRl— ^ huge blood-red rock marking the southern entrance of the FanucK Pass {q.v.) in Persian Baluchistan. There is a deep pool beneath it. It is about 18 miles above Bint, and near here would be a halting-place for troops, or any large party proceeding from the coast, m«?Bint andFanuch,. to Bampur, or vice versd. Water, firewood and camel forage plentiful.. GISHA or GlSHEH— Name of halting-place in the Nehbandan sub-division of the Kain dis trict of Khorasan on the road from Bandan to Duruh via Zainulabad, 20 miles from the latter place, 19 miles from Chah-i-Ziran and 40 miles from Dura . The water here is in the bed of a shallow ndld, a little above where it passes between two ranges of hills, and very brackish, but fit for 2B 2220 GIS-GIT animals. No habitation or supplies. Some Sistani nomads visit the place in the spring, when grass is procurable for their flocks.— {C. E. Yate.) GISHAK— A village, 23 miles from Birjand on the road to Kirman.— {Mohi-ud-Din.) GlSHAN— A village in the Shamil district {q-v.). GlSHU (Kutal) Elev. A kutal in Kirman, in the range which runs in a south-easterly direc tion in continuation of the Jamal Bariz range. It is crossed by the Rigan- Minab route at the 40th mile from Rigan, between the camping-grounds of Dehan-i-Abbas ’All and Mil-i-Farhad. The ascent from the north side is easy, but the descent on the south side is much steeper. The soil is gypsum, sandstone and clay, and but little work would be required&gt;to make a good cart-road across the kutal, and in Newcomen’s opinion it would even be possible to lay a railway along this alignment. Even in its present state the kutal has been traversed by Persian artillery, the guns being drawn by eight horses and drag ropes being used where necessary. The kutal receives its name from the Baluchi “ Gish,” which means an oleander tree, from the large number of these which cover the hillside.—A few miles west is the Gudar-i-Sabzu which is used by camels and is said to be about as easy.— (Jennings, 1885 ; Newcomen, 1905 ; Sykes, 1906.) GISPURDAH— A hamlet and date grove in Makran, a little south of Kahn Abi, on the Ramishk-Fanuch road.— (Sykes, 1898.) GlTAN— Said to be a halting-place in Makran, 22| miles south-east of Qasrqand on the Gwadar road. It lies on the southern slopes of Baga-i-Band. range, and is probably in the neighbourhood of Sartab Dap (q.v.). There is no village or inhabitants; supplies and fuel are not procurable but water is found in the bed of a ndld. Gitan must not be confounded with Khushkan Gitan, near Champ.—^ (Beresford-Lovett, 1871.) GITANUK— A village in Persian Baluchistan, near Jalk (q.v.). GlTU on BANDlNI KAUR— A watercourse in the coast district of Bir, in Persian Baluchistan. Ris ing in the hills it comes south through a wide plain or valley called Bandini. This is almost enclosed by hills, which at the southern end approach so as to form a gap or gorge 300 yards wide, through which the kaur runs and makes its way to the sea. The hills west of the defile are the Bandini Kuh and Kalat Kuh (q.v.), while to the north-east is the Biri Sai Paldag, a hill 1,680 feet high.There is a halting-place known as Bandini in the valley, on the bank of the GItu. It is six stages from Chahbar and nine from Jashk. Water abundant from holes in the bed of the kaur. Fuel and camel forage are also abundant.— (Pierce.) Humdan village (q.v.) is, or was, on the left (east) bank of the Gitu, near the sea. GOMBRUN— A name for Bandar Abbas current among Europeans till about the end of the eighteenth century.

' The highest pass crossing the Jamal Bariz range on the main Kirman- Bijnabaci road, about 24 miles south-west of Bam. It is called after ji small district of that name, which forms the summer retreat of the Khams*222 GUD-GUD of Bam. Owing to its elevation it is never hot, while the hills are well wooded and water abounds. From the pass, looking north, a commanding panoramic view is obtain ed. Below lies the broad valley of Deh Bakri, through which meanders a broad swift stream of the same name. It gradually becomes lost to view in the plain beyond, where it Joins the Bam drainage. Away in front beyond the broad plain is the Darzin range. To the west are the lofty snow-clad Sarduleh hills ; and behind lies the Jamal Bariz range. On reach ing the foot of the steep hill (which is the part of the pass that gets block ed with snow and becomes impassable) the road runs along the bed of a dry ravine for half a mile and then down the centre of Deh Bakrf valley through broad strips of cultivation. Leaving the valley by the river-bed, the track sometimes leads along the hillside and again along the river-bed. In this valley is, in all probability, the site of the most ancient capital of the province—the classical Carmana. GUDlR-I-GANDEH KfjH— Elev. 6,900'. A pass in Khorasan, about 70 miles from Birjand, on the road to Farah in Afghanistan, crossing a range which runs south from the Saman Shah to the Kuh-i-Baqaran. The altitude is nearly 7,000 feet, but the ascent from the west is by a steep narrow path, gradually ascending the course of a ravine from the Ab-i-Gandeh Kuh stream j the descent is easy and by a good road. For wheeled vehicles, the pass would require a good deal of making and some blasting. Ihe top of the pass is basaltic, while granite trap and old red sandstones go to form the sides.—(Tfozarfo: Bellew v MacGregor.) GUDAR-I-GIL or GUDAR-I-GILI— Elev. 400'. A low and easy pass in the Minab district, 72 miles from the town of that name, on the road to Rigan. The gradients nowhere exceed i, but the track at the top of the pass is very narrow, though two days’ work would render it fit for guns. The track along the water-course leading up to the pass is, however, so thickly strewn with boulders as to render it almost impassable.— (Napier, 1899.) GUDAR-I-GILl, see Gudar-i-Gil.

The remains of several old qandts show that the place was once inhabited, but nothing now exists except a mud hut occupied by two telegraph ghuldms, and a brackish well 6 feet deep surrounded by plentiful tamarisk trees and camel-grazing. Animals will drink the water of the well, but it is too salt for human consumption. About 2 miles south-west of Gurg the230 GUR-GUR Gurg river, a stream about 20 feet wide by 6 inches deep, crosses the track, flowing westwards. This appears to be the stream which Goldsmid calls the Rud-i-Mahi, and its waters are exceedingly salt and bitter. The climate of Gnrg is bitterly cold in winter, but the heat in summer is so intense that Goldsmid states that it is necessary for a rider to wrap bandages round his stirrup to prevent his horse or camel from being scorched by the contact, and to protect the rider’s feet.

The village is in the JagrAtr of the Khan of Sib. Water is good and abundant, and there are many date groves and some cultivation. Its position commands the Badamo pass leading to Gazu and Ladis. The fort, which was a very strong one, was treacherously seized during the disturbances in 1902, by the Sardar of Sib, who killed its owner and demolished its battlements and flanking defences. There is a most curious and romantic spring here, near which is the tomb of a celebrated saint, Mir Muhammad, a Baluchi Pir. The water, which is very salt, flows from a rock of variegated colours—red, blue, yellow, etc., in all directions, over a smooth stony surface, and as it evaporates in the sun, it leaves a deposit of excellent, white salt, which is collected and utilized. The water rises through a single hole about 6 inches in diameter, in the top of a round knoll of rock. One legend regarding this hole—fully be lieved in by every one here—is as follows :— A man accused of theft, or a woman of adultery, is made to put his (or her) hand into this hole.

Below Kandaz, the stream is small, nearly all the water being diverted on to the fields by the villagers, but the river valley itself is sometimes as much as 800 yards in breadth, flanked by low hills, with a considerable amount of wheat cultivation and many date groves.— {Showers, 1902 ; Tighe, 1902.) GWATAR (Bay and Village) — Gwatar bay is a great indentation in the Makran coast line at the point where Persian territory ends and Kalat territory begins : the bay is about equally divided between the Persian and British spheres of influence. At the entrance, the width is 19 miles and within it is somewhat less: the depth inland is about 11 miles and the whole area of the bay is entirely open to the south : the bottom is of mud, very flat and even. The sound ings, which are 6 fathoms in the entrance, begin to diminish half-way towards the foot of the bay and thereafter shoal regularly to the low swampy coast which forms its northern shore : the land on the east and west side of the bay is rocky and hilly, and on the west side rises to a table-land from 300 to 400 feet in height. With the eastern half of the bay, which lies in Baluchistan, we are not concerned : the chief feature of the remainder is the Dashtiari Chil river which, coming down from Bahu the capital of the Bahu district, and ' 2 D 2236 GWA—GWA * passing 4 miles to the east of Mirl Bazar, the capital of the Dashtiari district, enters the bay at its north-western corner. On the west coast of the bay, 3 miles south of the estuary of this river, is the village of Gwatar ; it consists of about 200 mat huts. There are 2 mosques built of mud. The inhabitants, who belong to the Maid tribe, number about 1,000 souls and are nearly all fishermen. There are some 10 Hindu and 28 Khojah traders, who are British subjects. The trade of Gwatar, which is one of the three principal parts of Per sian Makran, formerly nearly equalled that of Chahbar, but is at present hampered by disturbances in the interior, and the value of the annual exports does not now exceed Rs. 50,000, nor that of the annual imports Rs. 30,000. The Persian Imperial Customs department is represented here by a Mudir assisted by 3 Baluchi guards.— (Lorimer, 1906).HAD—HAJ 237 rict, ited H HADAR KAUR— A stream in Persian Baluchistan, about 27 mites from Bint, on the Jashk road.

It consists of a mud fort and 210 palm-leaf huts, and, with the neighbouring village of Mian Shahr, owns 50 yoke of plough oxen. Irrigation is by a cut from the Minab river, and about 5,000 mans of seed (barley) are sown yearly. From Haji Khadami to Minab there is an almost continuous belt of date groves, the inhabitants of the former owning from 25,000 to 30,000 palms. The village is under the chief of Shamil. — (Jennings, 1885 ; Napier, 1899.) HAKAMl— A village in the Minab district (q.v.). HALIL or HILIRl or HALIRl RUD— A river in Kirman, which rises in the mountains to the west of Sarduieh, and after a generally south-easterly course mingles its waters with those of the Bampur river in the Jaz Muiian Hdmun. It is the largest river in the province, and, indeed, the only one of any importance, but even it has not a perennial flow throughout its entire course, and running water is said to exist permanently only as far south as Bijnabad, though it can always be obtained by digging 10 or 15 feet below the surface. The Halil valley is very rich, and the fertile plains of Rudbar and Jiruft are irrigated by its water. It is largely a snow-fed stream, much of its water coming from the snow-capped Jamal Bariz range, and like all Persian rivers is liable to sudden and disastrous floods. Jennings experienced one such flood when marching from Rigan to Minab in April 1885—the worst, the natives said, that had been known for 20 years. He found at Hasan Sultan a Icdfileh of 200 camels, carrying merchandise fromHAL—HAM 239 Bandar Abbas to Slstan, wbich had been encamped on the bank for 30 days, waiting for the flood to subside. They eventually got the'r bag gage over on rafts made of massaks and sticks, and hauled their camels through the stream with ropes, being five days thus employed. On this occasion large flocks of sheep and goats were swept away ; while in a simi lar flood which occurred three years previously the natives said that upwards of 100 people had been drowned. Grey states that where crossed by the Mlnab-Rigan road the breadth of the river is 900 yards, and that a bridge of that length would be required. The bottom and banks are of sand, and after heavy rain the river sometimes overflows to a breadth of about 1 mile.—(Jennings, 1885 ; Sykes, 1902 ; Grey, 1905.) HALIRl RtJD, see Halil Rud.

See article on Gaz.— {Jennings.) HANJAM ISLAND— Lat. 26° 40' 49'; Long. 55° 53' 53'. A remarkable island situated off the south coast of Qishm island, in close proximity to Khargu point, from which it is divided by a strait a mile wide and from 6 to 12 fathoms deep in the fair-way. Hanjam has been not inaptly called the “ Perim of the Persian Gulf,” and would form a good base of naval observation, the Gulf being here so narrow that the Arabian coast is visible on a clear day ; it would not, however, be a suitable site for a defended naval establishment. Hanjam island is of a nondescript but compact shape, and measures 5| miles from north-north-east to south-south-west by about 3 miles in breadth. Physically it is an agglomeration of rugged hills decreasing in elevation towards the south end of the island : the highest summit is Table Hill, 1 mile from the north end, which reaches 350 feet. The dismal aspect of Hanjam from the sea, whence it appears as a mass of barren, broken and almost black rock streaked here and there with white and red, does not belie its real character. The only self-sown trees are the her and acacia, and grass—even in spring—is only sufficient to tinge slight ly one or two of the main valleys. Geologically the island is as rich in interest and variety as botanically it is destitute. The prevailing rock is a milliolitie limestone, but patches of maroon coloured stone and soil are numerous and are frequently indications of the presence of rock salt. In the northern part of the island are several salt caves, notably one * towards the centre of the island, entered by a long, low,’ narrow passage m the face of a hill: ^ it contains a grotto of rare beauty adorned with stalactites and tracery in the purest white salt. The mouths of some of the caves are adjoined by piles of stones and metallic substances of various' colours and attractive appearance, which have excited the admiration of more than one visitor ; among them appear to be sulphur, red ochre, and blocks of specular iron ore which are used by the fishermen of the island as sinkers on account of their weight. A valley near the western coast, about 300 yards north-west of the foot of Table Hill, presents another geological curiosity m the form of clay pillars bearing a singularly close resemblance to the trunks of fossilised date-trees. In 1904 two of these pillars, on being broken open, were found to hold a core or second pillar of flint of the same length as the first and one of the clay pillars contained in addition of t * Described by Floyer ; see his “ Unexplored Baluchistan,” pages 124—6.242 HAN—HAH fossilised bivalve shell. The outer clay case was extremely hard but peeled off in layers under the blows of a hammer*. The climate of Hanjam in summer is barely tolerable ; the heat is ter rific and is aggravated during the months of June, July and August by the moisture with which the atmosphere is laden, by the assaults of sand flies and other insects and, in the neighbourhood of the coast, by the stench of decomposing sea-weed. The rainy season begins in October and ends in March. In the winter of 1903-04 the fall was considerable and filled the reservoirs, but for 4 or 5 years previously there had been very little ran. In the hills are some wild goats, in reality domestic goats which have escaped from the villages and their descendants, and the island is now overrun by hares, which were introduced here and on Tunb island about 1882 by Mr. Ffinch, then Director of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs. There are no wild carnivora. Birds are not uncommon, especially towards the open ground at the south-west of the island ; among them are the kite, hawk, stone-plover, lark, dove and blue-rock pigeon, the latter inhabiting the caves and sometimes the deep wells of the island. The edible oyster is plentiful along the shores and pearl-oysters also abound. Sand flies and other insects exist in myriads and are troublesome at certain seasons. Only three points on Hanjam are at present inhabited. Of these the first is the British telegraph station, which was re-established at the north end of the island in April 1904 after having been m abeyance for 13 years. The buildings are situated on a cliff, J mile inland from the north coast of the island, and are only a few yards to the northward of the plinth which makes the site of the original station. The staff consists of an Assistant Superin tendent and 2 clerks. To the south of this old site is a valley of consi derable extent in which are two or three wells, the best of which is reserved for the use of the Telegraph establishment. The water is about 18 feet from the surface and varies from sweet to brackish ’. advantage has been taken of it to lay out a small garden and plant some trees. A native village called Masheh, consisting of a few huts, stands 300 yards east of the site of the old station and may be regarded as a dependency of the present one; the inhabitants are native emplo) es of the I. E, T. D. who were brought here from Jashk. The most populous place on the island is the village of Han] am, situat ed on a stretch of flat open country by the coast at the south-east side of the island. The plain adjoining it is all under cultivation. Hanjam is a typical Arab village, comparatively clean and well-built, and consists of about 200 houses. It possesses 8 or 9 gardens well stocked with fruit trees and irrigated from wells 20 to 25 feet deep which are worked by bullocks ; there are about 1,400 date-palms and the other principal crops are wheat, barley, onions, and pumpkins. The Arabs of Hanjam belong to the Bani Yas tribe of the Arabian coast, whence they are said to have immigrated about 3 generations ago ; their intercourse is still chiefly * Mr. Q. W. Laing (?) of the Indo-European Telegraph Department on whose excellent account of Hanjam the greater part of this article is founded, has seen similar freaks of nature at Qunara on the coast of Makran.HAN-HAN 243 Q2£&gt; nsists iid Ho 'with, that coast and particularly with the town of Dibai. They are mainly independent, intelligent, industrious and extremely hospitable. They own 36 pearl boats which constitute their principal means of livelihood ; the bulk of the male population is absent on the Arabian pearl-banks every year from June to October, not returning to the island until they have disposed of their takings to Indian merchants in Trucial ’Oman or at the pearl mart of Lingeh. The women during the same season seek employment at Minab and other places as date-pickers, and return to the settlement about the same time as their male relatives. In summer con sequently Hanjam village is practically deserted, except by aged care takers. In winter the men of Hanjam mostly devote themselves to whal ing and shark-fishing and are said to be very dexterous in the use of the harpoon, but some remain on shore to tend the cold weather crops. For shore fishing the people of Hanjam use a torpedo-shaped fish trap of wicker work wdth one inch meshes and a cone-shaped entrance projecting inwards from one end ; this is sunk at a moderate depth in a passage between two rocks, and is taken out at the end of the day with such fish as having wandered in have been unable to find their way out again. To this village and that of Ghail, belong 7 camels, 40 donkeys, 50 cattle and 400 goats, all of which are allowed to roam at large over the island, and the solitary dog, which is the only representative of its species on Han]5m, is kept here. About a mile south of the village, in the first series of hills from the coast, are some masonry remains which the Arabs attribute to the Portuguese. _ The third settlement is Ghail, an off-shoot of Hanjam village situated on the west coast about 3 miles south-west of the telegraph station and 2| miles north-west of Hanjam village. It contains about 30 houses and depends like Hanjam chiefly on pearl-diving. Here there is a well of excellent water within a few feet of the sea beach. Four or five walled gardens have sprung up about 100 yards east of the village ; in these are fruit-trees, beds of onions and a few pumpkins and beans. In the gardens are some eight shallow wells and between them and the village an artificial lake for storing rain-water has been created by damming up a hollow which passes the village. The supply of water at Ghail is almost inexhaustible and native vessels anchoring between Hanjam and Qishm island procure their supply from this place by boat when the tanks at the north end of the island are empty. Besides the telegraph station and the villages of Hanjam and Ghail, there are now no other settlements on the island, but traces of former hamlets exist in more than one place and in the valley south of the old telegraph station are the remains of walled plots of cultivation. Some idea of the resources and trade of Hanjam has been given in des cribing the island and villages. The salt-caves and pits, it may be observed, have not been worked in recent years. It remains to add that there is a valuable anchorage between Hanjam and Qishm visited by most native vessels proceeding up the Gulf in order to take water on board or in some cases to obtain shelter from the Shimal which here blow r s from the west-south-west. This place was formerly a rendezvous of pirates and is still occasionally used by slavers; one was recently surprised here 2 £2244 . HAN—HAN and a slave released. The anchorage is a double one lying on both sides of a sandy spit at the northernmost point of the island, cn which a beacon and high-water mark have recently been erected by the cable ship of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. The anchorage is sheltered from the prevalent winds, but the bottom is hard and a ship is liable to drag her anchor, especially in consequence of the tides which run strong during the ebb. Vessels drawing about 10 feet can be beached on the spit. The western part of the anchorage is the better, but is partially exposed to the Shimdl, to avoid which vessels must change their position to the other side of the cape. The depth in the anchorage is about 9 fathoms. Masheh Bay is the place where vessels load salt from the Namakdan mines on Qishm island for the Calcutta and other markets ; there being no safe anchorage off Namakdan the salt is brought here in lighters, a distance of over 20 miles, and transhipped. The principal authority on the island is the Shaikh of the village of Han- jam, who appears to have no relations with the Persian authorities. No revenue or tribute is paid by the islanders and a Persian Customs post and two Persian flag staffs at the north end of the island are as yet the only evidences of Persian sovereignty. No account of Han] am w^ould be complete which failed to mention the ruins on the north coast. The principal are two mosques 275 yards apart of which the eastern appears to have been a Persian construction and the western stands on a cliff overhanging the sea. On the northern side of the former, along the beach, extend traces of a settlement which appears to have consisted of 200 or 300 houses : among the remains here some coppers dating from 113 to 164 years back have been discovered. Immediately to the south of these ruins is a hollow 250 yards square containing graves and headstones, and in the vicinity of the mosque are 9 reservoirs hewn out of the solid limestone rock and lined with an imperishable hydraulic cement locally called Sariij. The largest of these reser voirs is 60 feet long, 12 feet wide and 12 feet deep and has a cylind- rically vaulted roof of ordinary Gach and stones. The western mosque appears to have been built with the ordinary maroon-coloured cement of the island ; it is also adjoined by reservoirs, 3 or 4 in number, and by a graveyard which with the remains of houses on the hill behind indicate that it may have been the nucleus of a distinct settlement. About a mile from the village of Ghail are three blocks of granite, the largest weighing several tons, of which the presence is not in any way accounted for except by a superstitious tale.

It is very wildly scattered, being divided into Hasan Langi Bala, or Upper Hasan Langi, and Hasan Langi Pain or Lower Hasan Langi, and contains a total of 200 houses, the inhabitants of which are Shi’ahs. The village is surrounded by about 4 square miles of date groves and cultivation. The latter consists of henna and of barley, of which about 35,000 lb are sown annually, while the date groves are computed to con tain about 20,000 trees. The mdlidt consists of half the produce. Water is brought by a small channel from a spring in the hills to the north, and is also obtained from the Shamil river. Many caravans from Kabul, Ka:\dahar, etc., pass through Hasan Langi on their way to Bandar Abbas during the cold weather. There is plenty of fuel and camel-grazing, and the village owns 50 cattle and 200 sheep and goats.— (Napier, 1899 ; Grey, 1905 \ Larimer, 1906.)HAS—HAU 247 HASAN SULTlN (Kirman)—Lat. 27° 42' 15*; Long. 57° 58' SG* Elev. 1,337'. A halting-place on the Rigan-Mlnab road, 3J miles from Jennings’ camp on the Halil river, and 17i from Kaleh-i-Qantaq. There is a large group of qhiddns here, surrounded by irrigated cultivation. In rainless years this place is neither inhabited nor cultivated, and the river opposite this place is a dry bed. Water for drinking purposes is always obtain able at a depth of from 10 to 15 feet. As a rule, the Halil river comes down in flood each alternate year, either from heavy spring rains or from Snow melting on Jamal Bariz. Grazing, wood and green grass (dependent on rain, however,) are abundant; also bhusa in the neighbourhood.— (Jennings.)

A pass over the Bampusht range (q.v.), leading from Ghistiqan (q. v .) to Kuhak, Jalk or Dizak (q.v.). It was crossed by St. John and Blanford in 1871. The former says in his narrative — “ Leaving Ghistiqan on the 2nd of March we camped in a ravine only 3 miles distant/’ ****** “ The next day we crossed a wide gravelly plain to the foot of the bills behind the first ridge of which we found a slender stream flowing westwards to the Nihing. Turning due north up this we camped amid dismal preci pices at the foot of the Hinduan pass. On reaching the summit of the pass, 4,100 feet above the sea, the next day, the finest view we had seen in Baluchistan burst upon us. Some 25 miles to the north an imposing range of mountains, with bold peaks and rugged sides, stretched along the horizon. In front of them, and partially hidden by the lesser ranges parallel to that on which we stood, lay a wide valley sloping up to the more distant hills. This was the Kuhak valley and the hills beyond it the Slaneh Kuh, and the Kuh-i-Sabz, between which the Mashkid river finds its way to the great desert which stretches away to the Helmand. Descending the Hindhan Pass, we entered the Askan torrent bed, now quite dry. A couple of miles further on, we halted for the night (March 4th) at a tiny spot of cultivation in the mouth of a ravine from the east* ward. ’ * * * * * * * * “ We found on the Askan ravine in close proximity to each other, camps of Baluchis belonging to Persian Bampusht, to Panjgur and to independ* ent Kuhak. 6i I.

We had now passed two considerable ranges parallel to the Ba npusht scarp, and the country in front was more open, sloping rapidly do «rn towards the Mashkid, but still intersected by numerous minor ridges.”— (St- John.) There is no information as to the practicability of the road for guns, but on the other hand, it is evidently passed without difficulty by camels. HINJIRUK (Nala)— In Sarhad.

A large village with an extensive date grove and a considerable amount of well irrigated cultivation. It is situated on the east bank of the Sarhai river and is flanked by low hills. The greatest number of houses and huts ire clustered about the ruined fort at the south end of the date grove ; about 600 yards higher up is another collection of some 60 huts, and on the opposite bank to the latter are some 30 more huts.

It is joined a little way south of the smaller village, on its west bank, by the Jakan Kaur, and about a mile further north it receives the Zian-Nadan Kaur which flows south-east from the Lashar hills. This latter, from what I learn, appears to be a large stream with the following villages along its banks Derchikband, Shirudar, Kant Kahur, Mokaz, Magas, Zian Nadan. Doubtless supplies are also avail able ^ from these villages. There is good camel-grazing in the district. The inhabitants own flocks of sheep and go&amp;ts~(Brazier-Creaqh, 1893.) HODICH, vide Hidugeh. HORMUZ (Island) *— Lat. 27° 5' 55'; Long. 56° 29' 5'. The north point of this island, the site of the celebrated 4 4 Ormuz ’ ’ of former times, is situated 11 miles east-south-east of Bandar Abbas, and 4 mfles south of the nearest part of the Persian mainland ; the mouth of Khur Minab is distant from it 19 miles due eastward. Hormuz island is nearly circular in shape with a diameter of from 4f to 5 miles. The coast is free from pronounced indentations and the only promon tory is the northern point, already mentioned, which is low and flat and pro jects nearly a mile from the general body of the island, its width across its base being also about a mile. The passage between Hormuz and the mainland navigable for vessels of moderate draft is only a mile wide and its depth, which at the narrowest part of the strait is 10 fathoms, diminishes to 4, and even at the end towards Bandar Abbas. The island, except at its northern an southern extremities, is surrounded by a belt of shoal water of consi- demble width. Except the flat promontory on the north side and a strip o air y eve ground half a mile to a mile in width which follows the eastern shore Hormuz is covered with jagged hills of brilliant and variegated hues. The dominant colour is a reddish-purple largely streaked with white, while the principal geological ingredients are rock-salt, red ochre and a greenish very adhesive clay. The hills are on the average over 300 feet in height and one peak in the centre reaches 690 feet. AH the ravines, and indeed whole valleys, in the interior of the island are incrusted with salt, and present the appearance of being lightly powdered with snow. Upon the an s o e ravines are pure white saline incrustations varying in thickness 3 to 12 inches and some of the ravines, in breadth from 6 to 15 feet, are spanne y natural bridges of salt strong enough to support a man. Hormuz is almost entirely barren ; its aspect of all but metallic sterility is relieved only by a few stunted kundr trees and some patches of barley on e p am near ormuz. village. A few gazelle are the only natural fauna. ^ P eT ^ meiltl y inhabited place on the island except Hormua W 1C ’ T 1 ^ i'k 6 population, is described in a separate article under resmirp^^Tr’ ln .^ iat P^ce also will be found some remarks on trade and of iron nnri 1 ^ a dded that of copper, specular iron ore, red oxide i- ,exis m g °n the island, only the last two are worked.

Vegetables and fodder are practically unobtainable. The revenue of Hormuz is farmed by the Mu’in-ut-Tujjar of Tehran from the Persian Government for 14,000 tumans a year but the political control is vested in the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The representative of the Muln-ut-Tujjar is a resident agent by whom the taxes are collected ; these are : general revenue, a royalty on the red oxide mines (called Ganj or Galak), and a sort of poll tax on the miners. This individual has a salary of 50 tmndns a month, besides perquisites arising from the salvage of wrecks, etc., and is responsible for the entire administration of the island. The Deputy-Governor of Bandar Abbas sometimes seeks to interfere in Hormuz affairs in the name of his master, the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The Persian Government are represented by an ins pector of the Imperial Customs Department. The simple topography of Hormuz island is summed up in the table below:— Name of place. ... * Position. Houses and in habitants. Remarks. BibI Gul (Qasr) On the south-west coast of the is land. Nil A site with a well of slightly brackish water and the ruins of former habitations. Hormuz (Village) On the northern point of the is land. .... See article Horm z village. Saiah-ud-Din .. On the east coast of the island, 3 miles from Hor muz village. Nil A place where there are saltt pans and where salt is mann? factured by a rough process. Bar Pazek At the southern extremity of the island. No permanent habitations. This is the present site of the red oxide workings of the island which employ about 200 hands. Water is brought from Trumb -k. The road from Hormuz village follows the east coast and the dis tance from it tojSar Puzeh is about 9 miles. Trumbak (Chah) On the south-east coast, 6 miles from Ho r m u z village. Nil There is a well here 40- feet deep with water which is ' fairly good but slightly brack ish. There are also ruins of what appears to have been a small town. * * # * * *HORMUZ (Village.)— The only inhabited place on the island of Hormuz and the sole remaining vestige of the once celebrated city of “ Ormuz.” The village is situated on the neck of the northern promontory between the Portuguese fort at its extremity and the ruins of the ancient city upon the landward side. The place consists of about 200 houses, and the population may rise, while the salt and oxide mines are being actively worked, to 1,200 souls, but falls in summer to less than half that number in consequence of an annual emigration to the mainland, especially to Minab, which the hot weather and prospects of employment in picking dates combine to produce. Persians predominate, many of them being natives of Bashakard and Rudbar ; but there are also Baluchis and Arabs who have long since forgotten to what tribe their ancestors belonged. The proportions of the mixture are also roughly measured by the fact that about frds of the popu lation is Shi’ah as against |rd Sunni. The inhabitants of Hormuz village are mostly sailors, fishermen and miners ; they ares, reported to own 8 large Mashuwas, 6 Baqarahs and 1 Ghunchah, with an aggregate burthen of 620 tons and employing 172 hands. The ordinary anchorage at Hormuz is half a mile to the east of the Portuguese fort, where the bottom is of mud, the depth of water from 4 to 5 fathoms. A little barley is grown on the plain near the village ; there are hardly any date-palms. A few reservoirs exist for the storage of rain-water and there are some wells yielding water which is slightly brackish. A Qadamgah of merely local importance stands 1 mile south of the village. The village is the seat of the Persian agent who governs the island. The Portuguese fort is now in a dilapidated con* dition owing to the removal of stones from the w T alls for building purposes, but it still contains two magnificent reservoirs, empty but in good repair. HOT BALOCH or LASHAR— A tribe inhabiting the Lashar district south of Bampur, in Persian Balfl- chistan, and also wandering all over the Bampur desert and neighbouring tracts, even down to Chahbar and the coast. They seem to be generally nomadic in their habits, and Floyer calls them the Bedouin of the country. The men are fine, wiry fellows of great endurance. They all carry a spin ning machine stuck in their girdles opposite the hack* forming a contrast to th ir wild looks and fierce conversation. They own some camels, w T hich must be able to eat all kinds of fodder, and very many small donkeys, goats and sheep, These they drive with them wherever in the sandy waste they may find scanty dried grass, and carry the patches of .woollen or goats’ hair cloth which, supported on small sticks, are regarded as tents, and are in fact miniature copies of the tents of Persian Iliats. • Mir Hot, of Pip, was the principal chief of the Hots of Lashar in 1876. He is supposed to be devoted to Persian interests, and the Governor of Bampur probably derives a certain amount of support from the Lash aria in the shape of a contingent of irregulars, when taking the field against other tribes, * An instrument which serves either as a knife or a saw.264 HUD—HUM HUDAK— A large village in Kirnian, 21 miles north-east of Kirman, on the road to Naiband.— {Stewart.)

It is situated among the hills which lie between the Bampur plain and the higher country to the east, and though near the watershed is quite separated from it, its drainage going entirely to the Bampur stream. Sykes writes: The climb from Manish took 14 hours and was danger ous owing to the absence of guides (the natives declaring the mountain had never been ascended) and to the nature of the mountain, which was com posed of friable slate, although its base was limestone. Kuh-i-Hamant is marked as a volcano on the latest maps, and it resembles one from the east and west, but from the north it is shown to be a sawback, and so narrow had t0 8it aStride When movin g alon S at top. 5 '—{Lovett ; Sykes, Iq93 .) •HUM—HUR 255 HUMDlN— ^ A village in Persian Makran (q.v.) HUMMOCKS (The)*— There are three remarkable hills to the north-east of Ras Dastakan in the island of Qishm, Persian Gulf. They are useful as landmarks when entering Basidu roads. The western hummock, 2 miles N. £ E. from the point, is table-topped, and the lowest of the three. The centre which bears north-east by east two-thirds of a mile from the western, has a rounded top. The eastern, and highest, is 585 feet high, and bears north-east by E | E., H miles from the western ; it is table-topped, has a little bush on the top, and may be seen 25 miles. All three are quite pre- cipitous on the south face, and the eastern is nearly joined to a long range L) of table-land, a little lower than the hummock, which extends 4 miles east-north-eastward, with a precipitous face southward, and ends in a bluff. Two miles east by north from this bluff is a table-shaped hill or hummock 7 550 feet high, standing in the plain north of Kavani village, and to the eastward of this are lower ranges extending as far as the salt hills. {Constable', Stiffe ; Persian Gulf Pilot.) HUM (Hills)— These form part of the range bounding the coast plain in Persian Baluchistan. They lie between the Gabiig and Sadaich rivers, and are the eastern part of the range marked cn St. John’s map as the “ Kuh-i-Luh.” / West of the Gabiig the Huni hills are continued by the Guram or Gvaran hills ; and east of the Sadaich is the Surag range.— {Floyer.) ^ 0n Hie telegraph route map the eastern part of the Huni hills is marked Chagkuh ; and beyond the Sadaich, the hills which Floyer calls the Surag range, are marked Darhaman Kuh.

The village is situated on the Shahri river, which flows into the Nihing, 40 miles almost due east of Sarbaz, and 35 miles south-south-east of Magas. It consists of 100 mud houses, generally loopholed, surrounding a well built and strong mud fort, 40 yards wide by 40 yards broad and about 50 feet high. The main tower is constructed of solid mud, to about half its height. Inside are many covered ways, that leading from the citadel being so low, that it is necessary to crawl along it. Rifle fire would make little impression against it, but from the neighbouring hills, gunfire would prove most effective. There is a well within the citadel. A small column under Major Tighe occupied the place in February 1902, they being the first Europeans ever to visit the district. At that time water was good and abundant ; fuel amd camel-grazing scarce, and sup plies unprocurable. The Irafshan valley is about half a mile broad and 2 miles long, and has many date groves with a considerable amount of terraced cultivation well watered by the Shahri river. The neighbouring hills are barren*and the intervening valleys much cut up by ndlds, which makes the move ment of troops and transport a difficult operation. The Irafshan district runs roughly from south-east to north-west for some 50 miles, from near Sarbaz to Bum Gyaz on the Shahrl river, and contains the villages oi Afshan, Ashar and Irafshan. Nominally it forms part of the Dizak district, and the revenue collected in 1902 was said to have been Rs. 3,000. In all Baluchistan there is no more mountainous and inaccessible tract than this and it forms the first place of refuge to which all border outlaws, whether Persian or British, turn when flying from justice. Geographically it is of importance, as through it passes one of the most frequented of the roads leading from Kej to Magas, Bampur and Bizak. In 1902 the fort of Irafshan was taken by a small British force, and subsequently hand ed over to the Persian authorities, who at the same time demolished the other two forts in the valley, those of Afshan, and Ashar. This may nave the effect of keeping the district more quiet than it has been in the past. (Tighe, 1902; Showers, 1902 ; Sykes, 1902.)

A large village in the Bashar District, in Persian Baluchistan, 35 miles from Bampur via Gish Kuh and Qasimabad, 28i miles via Mush Kuh and Gandam Maqam, and 15 miles north of Pib. The village consists of a tumbledown fort and some 80 flat-roofed houses and huts, situated on an elevated site on the west bank of the ndld. There is a large date grove and a considerable amount of rich cultivated soil here ; supplies are pro curable in fair quantities and fuel and water are abundant. The water- supply is conveyed by a stone-faced g-awa* from a spring above the villages. Later on, during the rains, the river-bed is full ; a part of the northern drainage from the Champ and Hamantak hills flows by this ndld and thus forms^ the Isfakeh river. This is the first place where a sprinkling of the Persian element has been met with. There is here so much salt 2 G 2ISF—I9F 260 in the soil that horses are very liable to cracked-heels. There are side camel tracks to Champ, 2 stages ; and Maskhutan, 6 stages: and a desert route to Pahura.— 1893 ; Brazier-Creagh, 1893.) ISFANDAK (Persian Baluchistan)— Is the name of a valley in Persian Baluchistan, lying east and west at the south-east corner of the Dizak district, on the banks of the Mashkid river. The latter here possesses a good, perennial stream, and flows from west to east along the southern edge of the plain, which latter is a large glacis, sloping gradually up from the banks of the river to the foot of the Sianeh Kuh. Parallel to the Slaneh Kuh, which forms the northern border of this valley, is the Bampusht range, which forms its southern boundary. The political boundaries of Isfandak, which is now a sub-district {see Isfandak, which, as is hereafter explained, includes the village of the same name, as well as the villages of Murt, Darida and Kanokh) of Dizak, are as follows :— to the south and west, Bampusht ; to the north, Kalaghan ; to the east, Kuhak. The four villages which constitute the sub-district of Isfandak will now be described according to their importance :— (1) Isfandak (Lat. 27° 6' SI' ; Long. 62° 51'0' ; Elev. 3,448') is situated some 2 to 3 miles to the north of the Mashkid river. It possesses a mud fort, more or less out of repair, in which reside the two headmen. This fort can hold all the* inhabitants and about 20 horses in times of emergency. Its inhabitants are Durshahzais, Tangazais and Zarozais. They say they are Rinds, but intermarried and closely allied to the Naushirvanis of Khar an. Regarding the latter St. John states « These Naushlrvanis appear to be the most warlike tribe in Baluchistan. They are of Persian origin, having, emigrated from Nushirwan, a district and former town on the Zaindarud, a few miles above Isfahan. As they claim kindred with theMamasa- nis of Nal, an offshoot of the well-known Lor tribe of the same name, the N. ushir- vanls are probably also Lurs. I could not learn any tradition as to the date of their emigration into Baluchistan ; but it seems not improbable that they were found trouble some neighbours by Shah ’Abbas when he established his court at Isfahan, and turned out by him to make room for the Armenian colonists brought from the nortli, whose descendants are still numerous in the neighbourhood. ” The inhabitants number 300 souls, several of whom live in ghiddns and the village has 60 houses and owns 1,000 sheep and goats, 40 cows, 40 camels and two horses. There is one excellent kdnz, from which hows a plentiful stream, while there is a flourishing date-palm grove and a con siderable amount of wheat, barley, and Indian-corn cultivation. St. John in 1872 states as follows :— &lt;« Three miles from the halting-place, i.e., the Mashkid river, we passed the village of Isfandak, the first permanent habitation since leaving Mand three weeks before. It lies on the edge of extensive date groves, among which flourishing crops of young corn were springing. The buildings were of mud and stone ; and the whole place had an air of greater prosperity and civihsation than anything seen in Southern Baluchistan. liGrazing and wood are plentiful, both here and in the neighbourhood. The water is excellent and likewise plentiful. Grass, if required in quan tity, must be got from the Slaneh Kuh ; it is said also to exist along the banks of the Mashkid river. The dwarf palm and tamarisks are'plentiful all over the plain. 9 As a rule the products suffice for the wants of the inhabitants ; but in bad years wheat is imported from Dizak. Dates and blankets are ex ported to Karachi and Gwadar. The blankets (called “ amshal ”) manu factured here are one foot wide and 45 feet long and have a very fine tex ture. Some are white, others dyed black. The former cost Re. 1 to Rs. 2 a piece and the black ones about double. The prices here are—wheat 15 seers, Indian-corn 12 and fine flour 5 seers per rupee. The local man is the same as the Dizak man and weighs Rs. 100, i.e., 1J seers Indian weight ; 40 Dizak mans are ground into atta for Re. 1. The village can turn out 50 men fully armed and equipped. (2) D arid a ; (3) Murt ; (4) Kanokh. Jennings did not visit these villages, but he was told that the latter was not then either inhabited or cultivated. The first two are said to be together about two-thirds the size of Isfandak. They each possess date- palms and cultivation ; and possess some 800 sheep and goats, as well as a few cows, camels, and donkeys. General account of Isfandak. —This district, including the three inhabit ed villages mentioned, was forcibly annexed by Persia about 1874. A certain number of families, however, remained in the three villages and continued to cultivate the lands. * Regarding this valley Blanford states :— “The Mashkid valley extends east and west to the north of the Bampusht range, forming yet another valley plain parallel to those of Ghlstiqan and Pishln. The stream which drains it issues from its eastern end to the northward. The elevation of the Mashkid stream near Isfandak is 3,250 feet, or 450 feet higher than Ghlstiqan. South of the stream the country consists of a confused mass of low ranges, much as in the Upper Nihing valley, whilst, as in that valley, a long, gently- sloping plain of gravel extends north of the river as far as the mountains of the Slaneh Kuh, a range rising to an elevation of 5,000 feet above the sea. It is noteworthy that, in all these parallel plains, there is a great slope of gravel from the northern margin, and none, or a very trifling one, from the south. The cause is probably that each range of hills rises to a greater height and more abruptly above the plain to the south than to the north, hence a greater accumulation of detritus along the southern slope of the range. The rocks of the Sianeh Kuh, between Isfandak and Kalaghan, are much more altered than those of any of the ranges farther south, the shale being converted into hard slate, some of it good roofing slate, with well-marked cleavage running about east and west, with a variation of about 10 degrees north or south of the general direction. The general strike of the rocks is the same, and the bedding frequently coincides with the cleavage, though the latter is often seen crossing the former. Some disturbance is evidently of posterior date to the cleavage, but, as a rule, the latter appears to have been contemporaneous with the upheaval of the rocks and their arrangement in their present, almost vertical, position. No change in the character of the formations takes place as far .Talk, and precisely similar beds, alike in character, strike and cleavage, are seen on the road between Kalaghan and Kalpurkan. near Dizak. Is fandak has a Customs Frontier Post under Sistaa — {Sykes, 1903.)</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100025472711.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/MIL/17/15/2/3</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100025472711.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/MIL/17/15/2/3</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'GAZETTEER OF PERSIA.
