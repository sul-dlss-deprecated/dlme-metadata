The letter discusses delays incurred through His Highness Syed Soweynee [Thuwaini bin Said]'s envoy being detained on route to Bunder Abbas [Bandar Abbas] and therefore missing the connection to Bushire.Other matters discussed include the Telegraph Department taking control of the Cable House at Reshire; instructions with regards to the island of Angaum [Henjam]; Edwards letter to the Chief of Bahrein [Bahrain]'s brother regarding promises made to Pelly that he has not yet kept; Hajee Ahmed's death on 8 July 1863 following several months of illness; and a shortage of establishment staff, partly owing to a nasty fever that has been spreading in Bushire.There appears to be at least one folio missing as the letter stops abrubtly mid sentence and has not been signed.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024189687.0x00000a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
