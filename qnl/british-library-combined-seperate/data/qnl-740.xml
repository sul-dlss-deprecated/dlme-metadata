The index uses page numbers that relate to the complete foliation sequence that is written in pencil, in the top right corner of each folio.</extent><extent>Formerly a bound correspondence volume, the file's sheets have been unbound and are now loose.There appear to be three incomplete foliation sequences and one complete foliation sequence. The first three sequences appear to reflect sequences assigned to files within the volume. The complete foliation sequence begins on the first folio with the number 1A. This is followed by 1B and then by two blank folios, which do not have numbers. The sequence resumes on 1C and continues through to 205, after which number the sequence jumps to number 214. This may be a foliating error, although another possibility is that folios with confidential information have been removed. The sequence continues from 214 through to 341 - the number given to the spine, which has been removed and placed in melinex. Letters are used elsewhere in the sequence: 3A and 3B; 141A and 141B; and 166A, 166B, 166C, which are housed in an envelope (166D) that is attached to folio 166D.The complete foliation sequence is written in pencil, in the top right corner of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains detailed correspondence regarding Bahrain's finances from between 1932 and 1934 including revenue and expenditure figures.
