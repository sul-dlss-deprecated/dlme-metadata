Bear de Oaury, In connection with y^ur recent mention of JAHAHAH the following ruinour which r^ne^te^i to me ye^terd.fiy ro^y b© of interest though 'probably not now news to you. s « Tnmertlnt^ly nrior to the dissolution of the last Legislative Oouicil Koweiti antagonists of the Shaikh in colla boration with Iraq lov* rm^nt officials in Baghdad had formulated a olan wherehy a number (not stinnlate-l hut stated to he 'mall) of Iraqi ^rmed cnr^ were to make a dash on JAHAHAH and occupy th^ town. Simultaneously the '^huhban' of KOWFJT would rl^e in resistance to the Shaikh# S* ^e idea seems to b^ based uoon the lack of interest and the su^nosed inactivity of the Hritish authorities, internal dissension in KOWm ft nd the fact that J AH AH AH f built to nrotect KOWEIT against the AKHWAN onslaught is the strategical key to KOWEIT, so th^t a very small forc^ would be sufficient to turn the tables on tbe 'haikh and secure th o domination of Koweitis. (^hade^ o p Hitler). th« ramification o # the plan was to have been is unknown hut it was certainly coloured by local rumouT* to the effect that 5 battalion^ o * th^ army were shortly to arrive in Hasrah. m he^e, according to official circles, were to be dispatchefl to the KOWKTT border to ^protect Iraqi oil interests at JKBU SANAM' whilst the populace supposed that they were to b rt employed in the occupation of KOfKIT territory. basis of this rumour is obscure. Maybe it is an exag eration o the idea expressed in a recent broadcast by the Tr ing who is believed to h^ve said that he ,? looks forward to the-2 the day when Syria, Palestine and Koweit are attached to Iraq' counled wlt^i a 'stand-by' warning to military unit 1 ? in the South. Tn the latter reject it 'wt h« home in mind that the King, whose 11'e was recently seriously threatened, 'ttended the onening ceremony of KUT Barrage which had been nostponed until yesterday so that it i-s not unreaso'ahl» to assuine that adequate nrecautions would be taken for hi^ protection. Tt has been renorte that a large noline force was dlsnatched from NASI'IYAH to KUT on 25/5 an^ there is, furthermore, a hint of trouble amongst the Mayyah tribe of the ahnrraf though this is as yet unconfirmed. 6. It has al^o been suggested, to refer back to the JWARAH question, that nrior' to the o'cunation by Iraqi armed carsji a nrellmi nary attack by naid Ifajdls in lorries should be carried out unon thp town in order to intimidate Koweitis an^ spread the rumour that large Iraqi forces were annroachlng. ^ further rumour states that Iraqi bedouin tribes ''ere Instructed to amroach the Koweit borders. 'i 7 . How much of the above is truth and how much Is a figment of the imagination is difficult to say. ''hat knowledgeable Iraqis should countenance the idea is fantastic but it Is at least very damaging to British nr°stige and I hone the matter will be taken up in no uncertain terras. 3. In regard to the '-haikh's nronei-ties in Basrah my information is to the effect that FADDAGHIYAH was sequestrated against a court-claim by Beit As ^uhair for I.n.19.000 and that the estate of BVAO has suffered a similar fate in lieu of Mlrl -'ue to the extent o' I.T&gt;.2.640. Representatives of the Shaikh were made to sign the aeoueatration order and many o^ the fallahin in rf»ceint of a monthly wage from the ShalHi (as onnosed to thnse having 'Slrkala' interest' in the land) were turned out and replaced at the order of the Mudlr FAO, and renta of sho^a, houses etc. ar o in future to b o collected by Government. 9. Your-5 9. Your ^gent who reported to the Consulate last Monday had nothing ^rther to add to what he h^d already told you, though he ^u^^ected that further nenue^tration of land might occur on the exDiry o' th o ten-day notice ^or th^ myrtr^nt of monies demanded. Incidentally h^ tol^l that only FADDAGHJYAH had been ^eoueatrated, which wa^ contrary to my information, and that he would keen the C^naul informed of the situation, however, you ar p nrohahly in nosse^slon of the full facts. I have not heard from him since. 10. So far as I can ascertain there i^ no queation o^ any trouble, nolice 'orce^ are not in evidence and the matter aeems to b^ a caae for th^ ^mba^sy and th^ Government to decide between them. After all, the blame really liea at the door of the Britiah authorities o^ old. I * afraid this letter i^ rather garbled as I'm writing in a hurry but it may noaaibly be of ^om^ u^e to you.

To - His Majesty's Seoretary of State for India, London, Repeated The Secretary to the Grovernment of India, External Affairs Department, New Delhi, His Majesty^ Ghargfe d*Affaires, Bagdad, The Political Agent, Kuwait. Subject: Iraqi incursions into Kuwait. j Reference my telegram No # 190, dated the 30th March 1939, and connected correspondence. 2. as pointed out in paragraph 3 of my telegram No. 149, dated the 21st larch 1939, the last outrage was the culmination of a series of incursions which had taken place during the last five years, some of them accompanied by violence, for none of which (in spite if repeated diplomatic protests) had any compensation or even an expres sion of regret been forthcoming from the Iraqi Government. ^ cannot help thinking that this ia an unsatisfactory situation not a little humiliating alike to the Shaikh, as Ruler of Kuwait, and to His Majesty's Government, as the protecting Power, Further it is damaging to our prestige, not only in Kuwait but in the other Arab States of the Gulf, where the news of these incursions sooner or later (Signature) / ^inds s ^ (Designation) MFP—1813 S&amp;P—&lt;M-2017)—21 -4-37—15,000. ■finds its way, and, I have no doubt, in Saudi Arabia, As you are aware, Ibn Saud displayed considerable interest in favour of Kuwait in the recent anti-Kuwait propaganda carried on from Iraq. 4 # One obvious method of dealing with this situation is for the Shaikh to establish his own frontier post, A suitable site for this would appear to be ROD H a about 12 miles south of the frontier at Safwan, This would be far enough from the Iraqi post at Safwan to be non-pro/ocative, but would at the same time be a convenient centre for patrolling the frontier, and would also cover J ahrah, against which recent incursions have apparently been aimed. (There are no wells at Rodha, but the same condition applies, I understand, from Safwan, the Iraqi frontier post, to CTahrah.) The patrolling could be done by the shaikh*s armed cars consisting of some half-a-dozen Ford lorries on which Lewis guns are mounted. It seems to me essential that patrolling should be done. Otherwise Iraqi police cars, by keeping a few miles away from the post, could continue their incursions, the Kuwaiti post should be garrison ed by a strong detachment of uniformed police under a respon- sible commander, it should be equipped with wireless by which it could ccsnmunicate with the Royal Air Force w/T set which will remain at Kuwait until Cable and rireless Limited commence operating, vide my Express Letter'Nofc/lSl, dated the Ist March 1939, and after that with the Gable and Wireless Station. It is, in my opinion, however, no use for the Shaikh to establish this post and institute his patrols unless in case of Iraqi incursions his police are prepared to use force. In / regardregard to the use of force the instructions which the Bhaiich would issue to his police might be as follows: (a) ( i) If Iraqi cars were found in Kuwait territory but not actually molesting individuals the Kuwaiti police would order them to retire across the frontier, and if they did not do so, would open fire. (i i) As an alternative to (i) the instructions might be that if the Iraqi cars refuse to retire into Iraqi territory they should not be fired on but shepherded till they left Kuwait territory. This should considerably reduce the likelihood of acts of molestation and violence by the Iraqi police. (b) If the Iraqi police committed acts of molesta tion or violence there could be no question of the ICUwaiti police standing by inactive, and the latter would have to open fire. 6. 3ince His Majesty*s (Jovernment are the protecting Power, we cannot expect the Shaikh to take measures in his own protection involving the possible use of force unless these have the approval of His Majesty»s Government, and their assurance of support. The communication to the Shaikh on the subject would therefore have to be to the effect that the post was being established with the entire approval of His Majesty's Government, and that if force had to be used by his police he would have the fullest support from His Majesty's Government. The Shaikh will presumably enquire what exactly 'fullest support* meant. He would then, in my opinion, have to be informed that this, in addition to diplomatic support would include, if necessary, tlie assistance / ofof the axwed forces of His Majesty's Qovernraent, e .g. the despatch of Royal xir ^orce armoured cars to support his police. The Iraq G-overnment would have to be informed of the communication which had been made to the Shaikh. 7. I think it is unlikely that after this communication had been made to the Iraq Government, and after a strong Kuwaiti post was actually in being, that a clash would occur, but we cannot rule out this possibility and if a post is to be established at all it must certainly be free to x ^esort to force if necessary. 8. If His Majesty's Government do not see their way to agree to the establishment of a post on tne above conditions, then the present situation will have to continue, unsatisfactory as it is. VJ * If, on the other hand, His Majesty's Grovernment are prepared to afford the Shaikh the measure of support indicated above, and the bhaiKn, on his side, is unwilling, on the grounds of expense or for other reasons, to establish the post, then the responsibility of His Majesty's Government for the failure by diplomatic means of preventing further incursions or for obtaining by the same means reparation therefor, is considerably lightened. Though His Majesty's Government are the protecting Power they can expect the Shaikh to taice reasonable measures in his own defence. ^ . ✓'* iO. As reported in my telegram under refereiice the proposed Cuaraiti post Has not yet been established and I have telegraphed to the Political Agent, Kuwait, to advise the Shaikh to postpone / its-5- its establishment for the moment. 11, I had intended leaving for Kuwait on the 23rd April but if His Majesty's Govenment can communicate their decision on this question by say the 1st week in May, I could postpone my visit until then in order to discuss the matter with the Political Agent and the Shaikh. I would be grateful for a telegraphic reply as to whether His Majesty's Government can reach a decision by then or not. sd. T.0#i ? owle. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

On March 26th Shaikh All al Khalifa, as the Shaikh's representative, selected sites for the building of two frontier posts, near the Iraq. - Kuwait frontier, to be manned by about 15 men, and have passport control officials. The Political Agent accompanied Shaikh Ali on his tour, in order to indicate to him, as nearly as possible, the line of the frontier. A courtesy visit was paid by the party to the 3AFWAIT post. On entering the yard it was found that the Police official in charge was away meeting the Mutassarif in Zubair, and that Kaca the a.titude of the Iraqi lolicte towards the Kuwaiti was uglys they loaded and half raised their rifles, while the car crews mounted their guns, (One man v/as so excited that he tried to mount it upside down J). That the two parties have met without an incident is very much to the good, but there would have been an incident if Mie Political Agent had not been there. (ii) The Kuv/ait frontier post, which the party re placed, v/as removed again next day (In 1932 the Hutassarif of Basra officially noted and recorded the position of this post, according to a letter to the Political Agent from his Adviser Mr.Jardine). On the 28th, passing travellers reported that not only had the board been removed out the holes in which it was placed had been carefully filled in and the ground smootheak over. This kind of thing, it can be safely as turned, is not the work of idle Bedouins, but of the Iraqi Police, and while it is not of very grave importance, it shows the mischievousness caused by Baghdad propaganda.No. 168/10/39 ^ ij cuu p P nES'D^MC {. t'r. f/.f?

It looks rather as if there were a plan, as they heard; its lines perhaps 'being that the Iraq.

A few cars from Safwan (patrolling after smugglers), some paid Nejdis, (for whom responsibility could 'be disowned), Iraqi tribesmen, (some of whom in any case come into Kuwait territory at this time of year for the grazing) were to demonstrate, so that the 'Youth Party* of Kuwait could take advantage of the atmosphere thus produced, supplemented 'by the Baghdad Broadcast propaganda, and 'by the movement of the Iraqi Army Forces near the frontier, to carry out a coup in favour of themselves and Iraq..

NCY ' A&gt;\ Your express letter of the 6th April? No* 3^0-89 and Bagdad telegram i60# Establishment of Iloweiti frontier post at Rodha* 2. Frontier post suggested coupled with patrolling by Koweiti police should be valuable deterrent to incursions from Iraq, and His Majesty's Government welcome the proposal. They recognise that in certain circumstances (vide para. 3 below) this step might involve the use of force against Iraqi intruders. But while they are bound to protect the independence and integrity of Koweit, and while in the last resort this might involve the use of their land sea or air resources on the Sheikh's behalf, they are most anxious, in view of wider political .and strategical considerations, to avoid such a deterioration of relations with Iraq as would necessitate, and be aggravated by, the use against Iraq of Royal Air Force forces drawn from Iraq. 3. Instructions to the Koweiti police should therefore be on the lines suggested in Bagdad telegram 160 and in ^ l(y ^ ~ (a)( ii) and (b) of your paragraph 5i Tliat is, that peaceful means only should be used to secure the withdrawal of Iraqi police from Koweit territory; if these fail the matter should/ c2. 6./ should be at once reported in order that diplomatic action may be taken. Force should be resorted to only if unavoidable and then only to the extent necessary to resist an actual attack on the Kov/eiti police in Koweiti territory or to protect the lives of individuals. in order that these instructions may be faithfully observed it is important that the charge of the post should be entrusted to a reliable officer. k* The Sheikh may be informed that the proposal has the approval of His Majesty's Government, who would give the Sheikh their full support if his police were compelled to use force in the cases provided for in the foregoing instructions. It would be undesirable to define full support further than that in the first instance it would mean diplomatic intervention with the Iraq. Government and the question of what further measures should be taken if the resources of diplomacy should be exhausted would have to be determined in the light of the particular circumstances of the case. If the Sheikh accepts the proposal and preparations are made to give effect thereto it would seem sufficient (subject to the view of His Majesty's Representative at Bagdad) to inform the Iraqi Government that the p ost is being established by the Sheikh with the full support of His Majesty's Government for the protection of his territory from unauthorised incursions. The opportunity can bQ taken to impress on the Iraqis the desirability and urgency of demarcating the frontier between the two countries.-f ( L 6. In the light of Bagdad telegram No* liO Saving of the 20th i-ipril His Majesty's Government do not consider it necessary at present to pursue suggestion in paragraph 3 of your telegram ¥0, 2i|.6 of the 19th April.

Tor example, at the suggestion of the Oriental Secretary, when I was staying in the Embassy € recently, I took the trouble to visit the Palace and the Iraqi Foreign Office) s The only time I have not sent a warning telegram to the Hutassarif was on 7th April 1939 when the Iraqi - telegraph line was out of order. The Basra Consulate dragoman, however, telephoned, according to instructions given him by the Consul, in my presence, to inform the Mutassarif of my arrival, and explain the lack of a tele gram. The dragoman brought the reply from the ' : utassarif that 'as I had explained it would be alright this time'. 3o I had of course, as always when travelling by land shown/ Hon'bl 0 Sir Trenchard Eowle, KCIE., CHS., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.^s\0..

I did not land at Shaiba on the 22nd March 'but at Basra. On my return from Baghdad I asked if I might land at Basra Air Port, 'but the Boyal Air ]?oroe Pilot informed me that Iraqi regulations forbade the landing at Basra of his type of aircraft, one, I understood, having a tail skid to which the Air Port Director ohjects, so in this case the landing was at Shaiha. However, as you applied for an air craft to taice me to Haoheniya ? and other officials, and the : Royal Air ?orce, may he affected, you will, I think, prefer to reply to this point. 5. The implication that I have 'been improperly questioning the Iraqi Police officers is of course absolutely unfounded. Hy letter No. C/114 of ? larch 17th, of which I attach a copy for easy reference, explains why I asked the Police Officer at what hour he expected the lutassarif. The Policy officer had asked me to take coffee with him which ?/as a little time in coming, and which I did not really want. T 7hen he replied that the 'Tutassarif was coming at any moment I made an excuse to leave. At that moment the coffee arrivec Our only other conversation was desultory, ahout the weather and the grazing, i v/as subsequently told hy the Consul in Basra that the Mutassarif was, or pretended to 'be, seriously upset at my ''questions ahout his movements'*, and I have no doubt therefore that this is the incident to which reference has now 'been made hy the Iraq. Government. 6.

I pick my way up the staircase 'between squatting petitioners, and spittle 1 and a passing farrash shows me into the Mutassarif's office.

On my return from the visit I described this conversa tion with the rutassarif to the British Consul. 8, I have strongly the impression that the Mutassarif is pursuing a course which he conceives will spoil relations at Baghdad of the Kuwait Agency and lower British influence in Kuwait. He is, it is common knowledge, seeing Kuwaiti malcontents in Basra, endeavouring 'by every means to create trouble in Kuwait, is permitting incursions, the seizure of the Shaikh's gardens, and scurrilous articles about the Shaikh and Kuwait in the Basra Press. 9. On the other hand I could hardly be more deferential than I have been to him, and to the Iraqi frontier, and administrative officials, and I suggest that this unfounded and irrelevant complaint deserves a brusque reply, and no encouragement.\ I Copy of letter No, C/114 dated March 17 ? 1939, from the Politice 1 Agent, Kuwait, to the Hon'ble the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

Tt occurs to me that a year or so ago the same reply might have 'been given ahout seizure of the Shaikh's date gardens in Iraq,, which demonstrably our influence at Baghdad has since 'been unaole to urevent. i ' 9 ^ r * * • According to Baghdad telegram No. 160 of April 25th to foreign Office (copy to you under No. 36), the view there now is that the Royal Air Force in Iraq, is not to he used for the protection of Kuwait, and further, vide ^ J » IM-I- your telegram No. 165 of March 26th to Baghdad, it is not to he used to demonstrate our readiness to protect it. At the same time, it is regarded 'by the Charge d' Affaires as inexpedient to give a 'broad hint to the Iraqi G-overnment which would deter it from occupying Kuwait, or B '/ part of it, (see Baghdad telegram No, 40 /SaVing of 20th April to Iporeign Office, and copy to you under No.4/Saving' although I see that you are still pressing for this hroad hint to he given - your telegrams Nos. 260 Of 24th April and 26S of 27th April to India Office. 3. Moreover, Iraqti Government promises, even written ones, in regard to Kuwait are shorn to he worth little 9 0 f-: . »r . (see Baghdad Note No. 128 of 25th starch to Sayid Huri as Sayid), and in any case Iraq. CaMnets are notoripuslj p* SS unstable, while, vide Baglidad despatch No. 178 of 20th April, 1939, the Prime Minister admits that he caimotcannot always ensure execution of his 07m orders. 4 - aoyal Kava1 ' --1 aM Special Intelligence report. «11 ind^^ently confirm that there is some sort ^ Cf -lan for tne occupation of Kuwait, or a part of it, now in existence (see your telegrams No. 159 of t3— March 25th and 213 of April 5th). ■' Obviously too, the continued successful occupation of t-ue Shaikh's gardens will have an encouraging effect on those who are pursuing an anti-Kuwait or/and anti-Eritish policy. 6. The possibility of occupation of ^uwait territory by Iraqi forces, therefore, cannot be disregarded, and J- suggest that we should in view of the above now consider what action, if it occurs, or is apparently about to occur, will be possible by fl) us and (2) the Kuwait authorities. 7 ' Under . 1)116 Kuwalt ., 0rder in Council, Iraqis in Kuwait come under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh, but it would be difficult for omall force to eject Iraqi forces in any strength, and if we advise him to eject the Iraqi forces from his territory, he will, I can confidently assume, immediately deny his ability to do so, and ask us to imple ment our promise of protection. As I uiklerstand our policy, the British forces in Iraq are not to be used to eject the Iraqi forces from Kuwaiu, or deter them from entering Kuwait, as a clash between Iraqi and British forces is undesirable, although no gi ound icrces other than the Hoyal Air j?oroe Armoured cars in Iraq could arrive here under several days. On the other hand judging from past experience the Iraqi Ocvernment are not so sensitive or so courteous towards the British Authorities, or strongly in control of their own forces and administration, as is sometimes sugges-suggested, and diplomatic representations alone may, and almost certainly will, fail to secure immediate withdrawal of the Iraqi forces. If this is so, every day they stay will 1 have a worse effect in AraMa, where our promise of protection of Kuwait is widely known. It seems to me, who am perhaps not in a position to kno?/ all the iclevant acts^ that this situation is not a iA ^-PP^ - —■ j suggest that to reliev© the mind of my successor, he he informed how His Majesty's Government have decio-ed to pi e^enu occi,rpau.ion Ox.

If, nowever, we have not plan, and no relevant facts are unknown to me, then my suggestion is that without delay the Shaikh of Kuwait 'be helped 'by us to form a military force efficient enough to deter the Iraqis from occupation, A tribal levy Porce is what, in that case, comes to my mind, and dm which I attach a very 'brief note. If the 'broad hint, already suggested 'by you, is not to 'be given to the Iraqi Government, and. the facts are as a'bove, I can see no alternative to this course and I would recommend swift attention to this matter, for, the occupation of part of Kuwait territory 'by an Iraqi General might well lead to embarrassing repercussions in Iraq and AraMa,Cost to His Majesty's Government of suggested British fostered force under the Shaikh of Kuwait.

Note : - Kuwait Arabs are fine fighters (they left 700 IKKW Arabs dead on the battlefield of JAHRA in 1921, and fought a dashing and successful action against DUSIIAN Arabs in 1929), Many are really magnificient shots, and the Political Agent has seen them hit flying birds with a rifle shot. Advantage, therefore, should be taken of this native ability; local dress, custom and tactics not being destroyed in favour of other forms, since they appear, and are, more formidable as they are. Development of extra hitting power and greater celerity of communications by means of Field Wireless Telegraphy are the main points upon which a frontier officer would probably find it desirable to concentrate in training.p Sd ret. .0.

I have no very useful comments to make on Baghdad despatch No. 178 (288/52/39) of 20th April, 1939, iDut it occurs to me, on reading this despatch, on reflecting on the past attacks on Kuwait, which appear to nave coincided with the accessions to power of Nuri as Sayid, and recalling that his 'brother-in-law, the late J a * afar Pasha al Askari, under whose unfluence Nuri came, was ardent for inclusion of Kuwait in Iraq., that Nuri himself is 'by no means unpleased at the Iraqi movement against Kuwait, and that it may have his concealed approval, and even his secret encourage ment. 2. This is a matter of doubt 'but it seems clearer that recent Iraqi action has 'been designed to demons trate to the Shaikh of Kuwait that while on the one hand Iraq, can ham him, we, on the other hand, are una'ble to protect his interests, or prevent him 'being attacked. Hence the continuation of Press ¥ireless attacks, and Police Incursions, even after protests, and hence the continued occupation of his gardens in spite of our protests. This lesson having heen made unmistakably clear to the Shaikh, a 'messenger' was to 'be sent to him, to pursue, and follow up, the Iraqi 5 ■ S e n'TDle Sir Trenchard Powle, KG IS., GEE., litical Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.-2- n ^ c'r: 10 sS plan for aomination over the Shaikh, aM over Kuwait, 3. It may he of minor interest that the Shaikh tells me that ah en 'aji Shawlcat came here some years ago he was particularly hospitable an! very liberal towards him. The effect of this seems to have been nil. 4. T, o_ course, entirely agree that the early marking o, the frontier is very desirable, but, if my view of Iraqi policy is correct, I think it will be difficult to make the Iraq. Government take action with us to do this, and T venture to prophesy endless delays, unless we press very hard for it.. | a V and their firing at night into an encampment of Kuwaiti tribesmen, Your (d) Hignness nad again decided to establiah this post immediately, and nad a^^ed Mr* de (raury, in company with a representative of Your Highness, to proceed to the neighbourhood of Saf^an and there to select a site for tne post on the Kuwait side of the (e) frontier. I informed His Majesty*s Government and the mo as ay at Bagdad of Your Highness*s intention, and on (f) the 6th April 1 telegraphed :lr# de Saury instructing him to suggest to Your Highness that the establishment of the post should be postponed for the moment. Your Highness agreed to this postponement m d the post has not yet been established. 4* The reason why I made my suggestion for a postponement was that I considered that before the post was actually established we should consider very carefully what the ultimate results of this establishment might be.

I beg to offer you my grateful thanks and deep gratitude for the kind attention and support which you have always been giving me on all occasions. Here I beg to make it clear that when I asked for the establishment of this post, my request was based on reasons of the repeated incursions by the Iraqi Police, and while I was thinking of the establishment of the post in question after consulting His Majesty's Government for making the necessary arrangements, 1 was asked, as you saifed, to postpone the matter. Nqw , since you have explained all what should be done and pointed out the necessary advices and arrangements, I wish to bring the following facts to your notice:- Firstly* To use HODHA as a post would entail many difficulties one of which is the scarcity of water in that place. I am also afraid that in future the Iraqis might claim that this place marks the frontier between their country and mine. Secondly: There is an ^il Company in Kuwait and in Iraq there is another Oil Company, particularly in Sanam district, '^tie operations/-2 operations of both these Companies may expand in future and as a result of such an expansion there may exist a contact{clash)be een their respective employees and labourers which might cause unnecessary difficulties for me.

This is my opinion which I am conveying to you and trust that you will take up the matter with His Majesty^ Government for taking such action as they deem fit.

Seasons given out for the move are (a) health of the troops ( dJ expense of continuing to rent land at Basra, but neither of these seems to he a very good reason, because the Xra.^i Government is aulte capable of acquiring the land it wants (as the Shaikh of Kuwait well knows) and the soldiers of the Ira a Army areTully Inured to the malarial valleys of Kurdistan and the insect-infested marshes, towns and canals of lcw«r Iraci, their homes. .Fear of the might of Iran is said to De prevalent in the Higher ^ragti Military circles, and if tnere is not some other reasdn for this move, it can only oe supposed that their fear of Iran has reached such a point that it is intended to abandon the defence of Basra if attacked, (since -^obeir is for military purposes practically cut off from -^aslya every time it rains at all Hard o:fc the floods rise, and is fifteen miles from it).

(In this connection, however, to the best of my recollection the post and board indicating the frontier at this point# which has been there for many ears, is less than a mile from the 3afwan palms.) Fro® this point the line would run Eastwards to the junction of Khor ^ubair a ^id ^hor 1 Abdullah leaving Ins 4aar wells to Iraqs in the other direction it would run due West until it met the thalweg of the B^tin* point south of Safwan would therefore sees to be the key point in thia ^ section, \ With regard to ^a] ♦ -*wton in paragraph 5 {%) of his draft letter to the iraq Jovensient suggests that this section should run alon^ the thalws...ii of the i^atin.

Of the Shaikh'• two representatives I think that the second, besides representing the Shaikh* should also represent His Sajesty's lorernment. This could be arranged by appointing a British official, who could conveniently be the i olitical Agent f Tuwait • Hi# Majest;/^ Goverr^nt would thus actually he represented on the Jommissiion, which seesas to 'be advisable in view of their position in regard to the foreign affairs of iiuwait• On the other ha*id this position is asserted in the procedure suggested by iiewton in his para^raih B$ and if the proposal to have a British official on the O ihwb I seion is likely to cause serious difficulties with the Iraqi uovernasntt personally I would not press for it. 9. It will be seen that I a^ee with the definition oi the frontier as suggested by Newton and the other points raised by him. It now remains for His Majesty's Government ^ to coave their approval. Should the/ do so the *haikh will have to be approached on the following pointss U) whether he agrees to the proposed definition of the frontier (2) whether he agrees to the composition of the Joint Joiaalssion , ,'3 ■: lut r i if* i (3) whether he la prepared to rseet hie share of the ooat of the work of aetnaroation. iol ** - caln: . « i . xo, nth remrd to i2) a ^ove.

Dear Ely India Office, Whitehall ? S.W.I, l^'uh june, 1939. r- 0 \ You will remember our discussion late in April (cf. my letter of the 24th April, No. P.Z. 2489/39) about t he proposed establishment of a frontier post in Koweit and the question of giving support to the S heik . h&gt; 5 forces in the ej/ent of an attack from Iraq. It was recognised that in case of need such support would have to be supplied by the R.A.F. forces in Iraq and the embarrassment of such a situation was fully appreciated. a saggestion, inspired by the R.A.F appreciation of the defence of Koweit ? has recently been made that the poss ibility of having a small British force, e.g. an armoured car detachment, permanently stationed somewhere in Koweit itself might be explored, either as an alternative to, or in addition to, the present detachment Commander M.H. Ely, A.ir Ministry, .2 . &gt; in Shaibah. Both the Foreign Office and we ourselves would welcome this step if it could he arranged. Not only would it get over the embarrassment mentioned above but it would be in itself a deterrent of incursions by Iraqi police etc. and an earnest to the Sheikh and to the Iraq Government tnat our guarantee to protect Koweit will be promptly implemented when the occasion requires it, 1he defence scheme lor Koweit now under consideration would no doubt be greatly strengthened if a British detachment could be kept permanently at Koweit, and the question of storing arms for the defence force would no doubt be simplified, but it may well be that, even if a detachment could be stationed there in time of peace, it would have to be withdrawn in the event of war for service elsewhere unless Koweit itself were seriously threatened. 3. As the Gulf defence schemes are concerned primarily with the situation in time of war I felt it would hardly be appropriate to ventilate the above suggestion at the recent meeting of the Overseas Defence Committee. I should be glad however if you couldnow consider it and let -e have your views, treating the suggestion at this stage as quite informal and tentative. If it were to be pursued the political authorities and the Sheikh would have to he consulted and questions of accommodation etc. would arise.

Dear Peel ? k * 9 26til junes 1939. */ Thank you for your letter P.Z. 3673/39 dated 19th June ; 1939 s in wiriich you enquired about the possi'bllity, of having an armoured car detachment permanently stationed in Koweit. I have not taken the question up officiallyj since you suggested we should treat the suggestion as quite informal, and tentative at this stage 3 so what follows must 'be taken as a personal opinion. Firstly 9 as to the possibility of stationing an armoured car section in Koweit as an alternative to Shaibah. Our armoured car strength in Iraq is the minimum required for the defence of our bases at Shaibah, Basrah and Habbaniya, and I think there is no doubt whatever that if an armoured car detachment were to be permanently stationed in Koweit ? it would have to be an addition to the present establishment. Then as regards the desirability or otherwise of locating a British armoured car detachment in Koweit. It was my impression that the general opinion at the discussion in April about the proposed frontier post in Koweit, was that while we should have to support the Sheikh of Koweit and in the last resort this might necessitate the use of land, sea or air forces on the Sheikh's behalf, we should endeavour to settle any incident which might arise by means of diplomatic intervention in the first place. You will remember that Houstoun-Boswall in his telegram No.160 dated 25th April, thought it undesirable to send forces from Iraq to reinforce those of Koweit because it T.Peel, Esq., M.G., would/ India Office, London.would render the position of the R.A. F. In Iraq much more difficult. tVnile 1 ao not talnk we could very well refuse 1 ''''' I'l II to send forces irorn Iraq if diplomatic intervention failed5 I feel that the stationing of British forces in Koweit in norma a. times might 'be regarded 'by the Iraqis as rather provocative. furthermore 3 since the armoured car section at dhaibah can reacii Koweit so quickly — a matter of ahout 4 hours - tiiere seems little to 'be gained by stationing armoured cars permanently in Koweit. I understand the O.D.C recently reviewed the defence proposals for Koweit ? which are set out in detail in enclosure 4 of O.D.C. Paper No.1739 These include recommendations for visits and co-operation between Royal Air Force armoured cars and aircraft and the local Koweiti forcesj and I understand are considered to be adequate. To sum up I really think that to avoid friction with the Iraqis and any possible clash should further incursions into Koweiti territory occur5 the best way is to refrain from stationing armoured cars in Koweit. Provided we maintain our prestige in that part of the world ? I think the knowledge that we would support the Sheikh of Koweit, and the fact that we have forces close at hand should be all that is necessary. Yours sincerely, Sgd. M.H. Ely.Enclosure In r, C.W.

It will ^be recalled that in his despatch No, 335 of the 1st July, 195 g, i, o ± whicn a copy was sent to the India Office with 'Foreign Office letter B 4936/66/91 of the 28th .July, 1939) Sir Basil I lew ton enclosed the draft of a letter to the^ Iraqi Minister. for Foreign Affairs, together with-the draft of a Note which ITlv Is' r proposed the latter should address to him embod.ying an explanatory/ formula interpreting the definition of the frontier given by Sir Percy Gox 0 Since it was stated in the India Office letter under^' 1 ^ reference that Lord Zetland agreed generally with the proposals put forward by Sir Basil ITewton, Lord Halifax is reluctant to cause further delay by suggesting at this stage any amendments to the draft Botes in question. It seems to him, however, that certain alterations, both in the draft Notes and in the explanatory formula itself are desirable, 4, In the first place, in view of the importance which now attaches to the eastern part of the frontier, it seems- preferable to advance in the- draft Note to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, as the reason for which His i-ajesty's Government desire that the frontier shall be demarcated (if any reason has to be advanced at all), the need for avoiding disputes in connexion with the d evelopment of the new port on the Khor Abdullah, rather than the embarrassment which has been caused by incursions of Iraqi police into Eoweiti territory. Jo far as Lord Halifax is aware, there have not in any case been any incidents of the kind for some time past and since any reference to them might arouse the susceptibilities of the Iraqi Government, this could, in his view, w ith advantage be omitted, 5 0 In the second place, it seeius desirable to include both in the draft Note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and. in the draft Note f rom the Ninister for Foreign Affairs to the Ambassador the actual wording of 3ir Perc3- Cox's definition of the frontier. If this is done, not only will the two Notes be jaore readily intelli gible in themselves, but it will alsp be self-evident why some elucidation of the existing definition is necessary before the work of demarcation can be started. L i:~c * 6. JKlirdlf, Lord Halifax has noted from the late Sijr Trenchard Fowle's letter of the 1st August, 1939 to Mr. Feel (of which a copy was sent to the Foreign Office with India Office letter fo.B.Z.4978/39 , . 1 . ^-T t» «v&gt; er-Secretery of State, of/ ia Office, Foreign Office, s1,-C ! 2. post au di board outh. of the 19th August last) that there are in existence indicating the frontier on the track between I-ov/eit and Zubair of Safwan. To'detendne the frontier at this point by a reference 1 - to the most f southerly palm in Safwan has always seemed to lis Lordship a somewhat unsatisfactory expedient, and he is of the opinion that it would be definitely preferable to adopt instead a reference to the existing post and board, as beiny less likely to a rouse controversy either with the Iraci Government or with the Sheikh, Since this board is apparently less than one mile south of Safwan, ._is Lordship Assumes that this suggestion will commend itself to Lord Zetland, 7. erc.v n f^O The next fixed point on the frontier is that described by Sir ox as the junction of the Khor ^ubair with the l.iior Abdullah. despatch of the 1st July last, Sir should be defined as the junction of the Khor Zubair with the thai we- of the north-westerly of the Khor Abdullah, known as the khor Shetana.

Kewton's despatch of the 1st Julv is i oreover the t erm in view Khor Um of the existence of iasr K is likely to 8. The most important point, however, to which I am. , _ — to draw a»cention arises in connexion with the frontier between the two fixed points men Lioned above (the point just south of the latitude of Safwan and the junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Shetana), The explanatory -ormula as draxted by Sir Basil Kewton contains no explanation of this section of the frontier, while the relevant extract from Sir lercy Cox's definition reads as follows: 3'f- • • 'thence eastwards passing south of Safwan wells,* Sakan and Um J.asr, leaving them to Irac, and so on to T 'junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah. n Jab al the •mis a exiintion, although it specifically leaves Um ^asr to Iraq, does not seem co Lord Halifax to provide in itself' an adequate basis for .nejemarcation of the frontier, since it is not even stated that the iron.oier shall follow the shor test line t between the two terminal points, i.o coud o cae reason for the somewhat imprecise nature of this defini- Pii n th ® tim it waE r ®garded as sufficient to make i the th-lrL ?hP , elone . ec ! t 0 Iraq and that the frontier should reach tne tnalwep oi the Khor Aoaullah at the junction of the Elior Vuhn'r V.ith the Khor Shetana. Be that as it 4, some Spim^ion now oeems necessary and Lord Halifax can only suggest that, in, order to avoid disputes, the frontier should be defined as following as far as possible the shortest line between the post south of Safwan and the junction oi the thalwege of the Khor Zubair and the Khor Shetana, It would noc appear, however, that this definition aould be proposid without seme modification, since so far as can be ascertained from the availacle maps, the shortest line between these two terminal points woul L g not only cut across, the Khor Zubair at its south-eastern extremi uy, ouu ./ould even include part of the left bank of the Khor V laS never Been suggested, nor could the Iraqj.

After Compliments, The Hon'ble the Political Resident has instructed me to approach Your Highness to seek your concurrence on the interpretation of the definition of the frontier between Iraq and Kuwait as it is proposed should be put to the Iraqi Government for their concurrence. Your Highness will see that the interpretation is only a clarification of the existing definition which I repeat below: w From the intersection of the Wadi-el-Audja with the Batin and thence northwards along the Batin to a point just south of the latitude of Safwan; thence eastwards passing south of Safwan wells, Jabal Sanam and Urn Qasr leaving them to 'Iraq and so on to the Junctior of the Khor Zobeir with the Khor Abdullah. The islands of Warbah, Bubuyan, Maskan (or Mashjan), Failakah, Auhah, Kubbar, Qaru and Ul-el-Maradim, appertain to Kuwait*. The definition in which I should be grateful for Your Highness 1 concurrence is as follows: (1) ,# Along the Batin^the frontier line shall follow the thalweg , i.e. the line of the deepest depression. (2) The 'point Just south of the latitude of Safwan' shall be the point on the thalweg; of the Batin due west of the point a little to the south of Safwan at which the post and notice board at present marking the frontier have beer erected. / 'S ■(3) From the Batin to the neighbourhood of Safwan the frontier shall be a line along the parallel of latitude on which stands the above-mentioned point at which the post and notice-board have been erected. (4) The 'junction of the Khor Zobeir with the Khor Abdullah ,, shall mean the junction of the thalweg of the Khor Zobeir with the thalweg of the north-westerly arm of the Khor Abdullah known as the Khor Shetana• of the Khor Zobeir with the Khor Abdullah the frontier shall be the shortest line between the point defined in sub paragraph (2) and the point defined in sub-paragraph (4)o But if this line shall be found, when followed on the ground to strike the right bank of the Khor Zobeir before it reaches the point defined in sub-paragraph (4), it shall be modified in such a manner as to follow the low water line on the right bank of the Khor Zobeir until such a point on the bank immediately opposite the point defined in sub-paragraph{4) is reached, thus leaving the whole of the Khor Zobeir to Iraqo (6) From the point defined in sub-paragraph (4) to the open sea the boundary shall follow the thalweg of the Khor Abdullah.' (5) From the neighbourhood of Safwan to the junction Usual Ending. ~ t-o-i Political Agent, Kuwait. r•'S** A -i efio , 0 -T ^ Copy in translation of letter No,E/6/1327 dated the 12,h June, 1940, from -.is Highness the Ruler of Kuwait to the Political Agent, Kuwait.
