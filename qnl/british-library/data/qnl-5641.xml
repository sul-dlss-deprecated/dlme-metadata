The object of their visit was to ascertain from His Highness the areas to which surface parties could be given access. Both had hoped that the political conditions in the interior would have improved sufficiently to permit some penetration of Oman. Apart from the coastal strip, Kis High ness was, however, only able to agree to the exploration of ^rta___of the Dh abi rah argj^ the Baiad Beni 3u ^&gt;11 and terri tories south and west of it, and the province of Dhofar. The Sultan also agreed to flights being made over the whole of his terrj-tories provided, in the case of the interior, that air crait flew reasonably high (i.e. beyond the range of a rifle). 3. Mr. Baker informed His Highness that for the 1946-47 season, he would consider recommending to his company geo- logical work in the province of Dhofar by a land party and, if experiments with new instruments for ‘&gt;se in aircraft proved successful, the geophysical examination of parts of the interior from the air. Mr. Baker did not rule out the poss ibility of a surface party being sent to the Batinah coast, but pointed out that such an examination could not be expected to yield much in the way of results as the party would be unable to proceed far enough inland to observe the stratigraphy of the foot-hills. 4. i may mention here that Mr. Baker appeared to consider — taat from trie information at his disposal, the chances of find- ing oil in either of the two eoncession areas were far from good, and on one occasion expressed the view that it might not be in His Highness* interest for the company to accelarate the assessment of the value of their concessions. In view, however, of the very limited exploration which the company uas so far been able to undertake, I find it difficult to take this statement seriously. I have the honour to be.

Mr. Baker, our Chief Geologist, and Mr. Lermitte, Deputy Manager on the Persian Gulf, visited the Sultan of Muscat at his capital in the second week of April, with the results which we detailed to you verbally at our meeting* in effect, the Sultan was unable to promise us access to any major part of those areas of his nominal territory which chiefly interest us from the oil point of view. Indeed, he seemed to make even humbler claims, as regards the extent of his own effective sway, than he made in 1937/38. The exploration programme which the Company would wish to carry out, beginning in the autumn of this year, is as follows* Geological ground examinations of a) Khabura to Yanqul, Dhank and Ibri b) Jabal Akhdhar c) Muscat to Izki through Wadi Samail d) The coast near Has Abu Daud to Ibra (not Ibri) via Wadis Tayin and Khabbah e) Sur to Yfadi Batha via n/adi Falaij f) Wadi Batha area from Jumaila (Ghina) to Ibra g) The west forefront of the Oman Range from the coast south of Ras al Hadd up to Jabal Hafith) In addition the foregoing we would carry out grand'' surveys to whatever extent the geology warrants over areas from Dhofar along the coast to the northeast. Geophysical Surveys by land and/or, if practicable, by air over coast south of Has al Hadd to the Persian Gulf b) The coast and hinterland between Ras al Hadd and Dhofar to whatever extent geophysical results of reconnaissance flights would indicate. c) The Batinah Coast between Muscat and Sohar. We should be very glad to have your comments and those of the Political Resident on the feasibility of this programme at the date suggested.

Longrigg and Mr* Baker are coming to see us at 12 o* clock on Tuesday in connection with Mr* Baker* s recent discussions with the Sultan of Muscat about the possibility of the Company carrying out a survey of the Jaalan-Beni Bu Ali area , which is roughly the country lying inland from Masirah* £ I am under the impression that the Compary will tell us that they think the practical difficulties (which arise largely from the Sultan* s lack of control over the interior) will make it impossible for them to carry out any survey of this area next winter. It should be our aim to urge the Cong?any to go ahead in developing this area as soon as possible for two reasons: (1) The desirability of providing the Sultan with oil royalties to enable him to consolidate his administration^as well as to keep him contented* (2) The desirability from the strategical aspect of developing oil in this area. I understand from the H*]?.?* that strategical planning for oil development is still in rather an embiyo stage, but this partioulffir area may be of scn» particular importance since it is further than the Iraqi and South Persian oilfields from the potential storm centre. I have spoken to Mr. Stock and have confirmed that M*P.P. are generally in agreement with the above* I enquired whether they would like to be represented at the meeting tomorrow and Mr. Stock tells me that he aid Mr* Farrell would be glad to come so we may expect them. The/The Company* s representatives my possibly have something to say about the exploration which they have been doing in the Tracial. Coast area. They have surveyed the Jebel Faiyah area (claimed by the Shaikh of Sharjah but under the de facto control of the Beni fiiitab tribe) and should have recently started in the Barairai area further south which is also in disputed territory (Muscat has a claim). HU Mr. Baker, who aaoeggaiiiies the Chief Geologist, has recently been in the Truoial Coast as well as Muscat r Brig. Longrigg has also been there in the past and knows a good deal about it (incidentally he was until a year or so ago acting as Governor of Eritrea under the jtv** v '* /new military administration) • . - ■N /-'•lemorandum .

The Residency Agent informs me that the Shaikh of Fujairah has again approached him on the subject of entering into treaty relations with His Majesty^ Government. 3. The request is probably again prompted by thoughts of oil in connection with which the situa tion is that this year's geological survey party has surveyed Jabal Faiyah and has been through the ’.Tadi al Ghor to Kalba. This is as close as they have been to Fujairah, and the shaikh of Fujairah has been told that if the geological party wish to survey Fujairah territory they will not do so without his first being approached. 4. For the time being the Shaikh of Fujairah will have to be satisfied with the above answer, and if you wish to examine the case for a Treaty you will doubtless send instructions. Sd./- A.C.

Your Excellency was unable to arrange the visit at this time. Later in your No. 161 dated the 13th Ramadhan *57 Your Excellency drew the Company*s attention to para *C* of schedule No. 1 to the company’s Oil Concession Agreement of 1937 (by which Your Excellency’s formal permission in writing is necessary before a company party can visit the Al Faiyah area). In 1939 war broke out and the question of this visit was not followed up. 2. The war has now ended and plans are being made for geological work on the Trucial Coast. Work is expected to commence about January 1946 (Safar 1365) and will continue up to the end of the cool season. Vie shall be glad if Your Excellency will make the necessary arrangements for our geologists to visit the Jabal Faiyah area in January 1946 (Safar 1365) and provide the necessary friends and guards to ensure that the party can do their geological work in safety and without hindrance. The party will remain in the Al Faiyah area as long as necessary for them to complete their work. We shall be pleased if Your Excellency will inform us in writing as soon as the visit is arranged with full particulars in order that our geologists will have time to make their programme. Your Excellency’s letter should also include the formal permission for the company’s party to visit the Al Faiyah area as laid down in para ’C* of schedule No. 1 to the P.T.O.Sharjah Oil Concession Agreement of 1937 between the company and Your Excellency. 3.

The Company have done practically nothing about it and the Sultan of Muscat has recently been showing some signs of dissatisfaction. The Company are, however, now proposing to send out a small survey party this winter to be followed by a more elaborate geological survey party the winter after. We have been suggesting to them that they might do a bit more about Muscat. I suggest that you might read our letter to the Political Resident at Ext. 1758/45, the Political Residents telegram No. T/L? 0 at Ext,3657, and the Company^ latest letter of the 14 th August. We have been keeping the Petroleum Division in touch. They are interested mostly from the point of view of the supply to the Company of the necessary equipment both for the geological survey (practically all of th^se will have to come from America^, who have most of the technical knowledge on the subject) and the actual drilling equipment when that stage arrives.

I will, if I may, comment on certain of the points which have come to light. flvi ■ ^ y hits*. ^ ftCn Operations in the Batinah are not very probable, simply because our geologists consider it as territory of no promise: we should only explore there further for political reasons, and it seems a somewhat expensive method of pleasing Sayid Sa’idi The latter should be asked to obtain access for us, on the ground, to the Ja'alan and Bani bu Aii territory for the season of 1946/47. (This should not be taken as a positive guarantee that we should be able to send a party). If there is flying over the area - for which at the moment we have no aircraft - it would^I think^be difficult to 1 limit the heights at which they would fly: nor, I suppose, would it (greatly matter &gt; since about 999/1,000 is uninhabited. As to Dhofar, I am placing this possibility before the geologists. ' The present air facilities are appreciated. Your information regarding the relations between the Sultan and the Imam is most interesting, especially when read in conjunction with the recent Galloway report. An east to west penetration of Oman is not, as you know, part of our immediate programme. We have no objection in principle to posting a European manager for a time to Muscat but are at the moment prevented by having nobody suitable whom we could send - and, it must be added, absolutely no duties for him when in residence there. We ought, however, to be able to manage a visit by a suitable officer from Bahrain during the winter, probably Lermitte. RECfl. PCI. CLi'i-1 fi AUG i945 | p.t.o. IND,!A OFFICEdUL^-&lt;i gA Ext. 3657/45. 31st July, 1945 . My dear Longrigg, JTS ^ . / We have now received the Political Resident’s conaoents the subject of your compafy's proposed exploration and geo logical survey work in the Muscat Truoial coast area. These are to the following effect : (a) The Sultan would welcome operations in the Batinah. (B) The Sultan cannot guarantee access to the Ja'alan and Beni bu All territory for a land party without consulting the Sheikhs. This he will do, but he considers it unlikely that he will be in a position to give a definite reply in time for the company to undertake operations this winter. He sees no objection however to an aerial survey of this area, though he reiterates the indictment which was given in 1938 against low flying over the area. (C) Dhofar . The Political Resident remarks that beyond a few flights in 1939 no activity has been shown by your company in this area. The air facilities now available offer exceptional opportunities for an aerial survey of the southern regions, and it is hoped you will be able to utilise them to the fullest extent. (D) As regards relations between the Sultan and the Imam the position at the beginning of June was that the most influential Sheikhlof the Jebel Akhdhar, Sulaiman Bin Harrdyar of the Nabhani, and All Bin Abdullah of the Beni bu Ali, were in Muscat and both declared tint they would take no part in the election of a new Imam after the death of the present one, who was reported to be very ill. Sheikh Isa bin Saleh of the Shawqui^seh, the most influential of all the Sheikhs in Omari, haji made &amp; similar declaration. The Imam had sent a letter to the Sultan saying 0 j. - o rthat he was sending an emissary to Muscat to discuss important Brigadier S.H. Longrigg, /questions. Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd., Ling House, Dominion Street, E.C.2.-*s»' \ - 2 - ■ I . questions. It is difficult to see clearly at this stv, \ what the Sultan and Sheikhs are really sibling at. but th&lt;i Sultan* s main object is to eztend his influence over the hinterland, and lie v»ili probably have to rely on a network of agreements with the various Sheikhs. It does not seem very likely that the latter will definitely recognise the Sultan as their suzerain, though they mist adopt a compliant attitude towards him to some extent because of his control over imports. Negotiations are still proceeding and the Political Resident thinks that any attempt to penetrate the hinterland from the Muscat side tills winter would fetter the Sultan’s freedom of action. As work can be carried out in other areas it would seem desirable that plans for work in this area should be postponed until fv representative of your company has established closer relations with the Sultan. (E) - With reference to the latter point, the Political Resident thinks that it is very desirable that your company should establish^ar^doser contact with the Sultan, who is likely to remain in Muscat for most of next ’winter. If you are able to follow up the suggestion for operations on the B&amp;tinah cost, the question of appointing a European manager to Muscat might perhaps be exaiiiined. (I think this possibility was discussed in 1939.) R ) Rgbel halvah . The Political Resident thinks that the Sheikh af Sharjah, should first be asked to sponsor a visit to this area. When, as is likely, he shows himself unable to do so, it should be possible to arrange a visit through Sheikh Mohamed bin Ali of the Beni Qitab Tribe. Details are not yet available3. , i the Political Hgent, Bahrein, thinks that it should be possible to arrange for a party to penetrate these areas from the north. (H) The Political Resident thinks that it would be better to arrange an aporoach to the Baraimi area fror.i tne nortn since the terrain here offers an easier approach, and the use of this route will avoid the raising of conflicting interests in the area. The Political Resident has not, therefore, suggested any approach to the Sultan of Muscat for assistance in penetrating this area, though with a view to avoiding any ill-feeling on the part of the Sultan he thinks that the latter should be infor^a of a party* s approach from the north. It is assumed that all you have in mind to send to this area next winter is a small geological and impping warty at 1 the type which you mentioned when you saw me on April 18th. (l^ As regards the B&amp;tinah and the southern regions of Muscat, your^company might make arrangements on a suitable scale after the details have been discussed with the Sultan. You. will no doubt let me know' your reactions to the above suggestions in due course.

POL. BEPT. 23 JUL1945 IA OFFICEmam COPY EXT. 3075/45 CONFIDENTIAL Persian Gulf Residency, D.O, No. 617-S, Bushire, 4th June, 1945# Dear Sir Olaf, Will you please refer to the correspondence ending with our Endorsement No. 584-3 of the 30th May, 1945? 2. The situation as regards Oman now is that the most influential Shaikh of the Jabal Akhdhar, Sulairnan bin Hamiyar of the Nabhani, and Ali bin Abdullah of the Beni bu Ali of Eastern Ja f alan are now in Muscat and have both declared that they will take no part in the election of a new Imam after the death of Muhammad bin Abdullah al Khalili who is reported to be very sick. Shaikh Isa bin Saleh of the Sharquiyeh, the most influential of all the Shaikhs in Oman, has made a similar declaration. I should have thought that this openly expressed determination to do away with the Imaraate would be likely to encourage the Imam to take a new lease of life, actually he has sent a letter to the Sultan saying that he is sending an emissary to Muscat to discuss important questions. 3. It is difficult to see clearly at this stage what the Sultan and the Shaikhs are really aiming at. It may be that the Shaikhs desire the abolition of the Imamate, and possibly the Sultan may acquiesce in this, realising that there is no hope of being elected himself. The Sultan’s main object is to extend his influence over the hinterland and he will probably, therefore, have to rely on a network of agreements with the various Shaikhs. I cannot see these latter giving up their independence and recognising the Sultan as their suzerain, though they must bend the knee to him a little because of his control over imports. The Imam’s attitude will probably be guided by an endeavour to secure some inheritance for his posterity.

Dear Sir Olaf, Will you please refer to the correspondence ending with our Endorsement No.584-3 of the 30th May, 1945? 2. The situation as regards Oman now is that the most influential Shaikh of the Jabal Akhdhar, Suleiman bin Hamiyar of the Nabh&amp;ni, and Ali bin Abdullah of the Beni bu Ali of Eastern Ja’ alan are now in Muscat and have both declared that they will take no part in the election of a new Imam after the death of Muhanmad bin Abdullah al Khalili who is reported to be very sick. Shaikh Isa bin Saleh of the Sharquiyeh, the most influential of all the Shaikhs in Oman, has made a similar declaration. I should have thought that this openly expressed determination to do away with the Imaraate would be likely to encourage the Imam to take a new lease of life, actually he has sent a letter to the Sultan saying that he is sending an emissary to Muscat to discuss important questions. 3. It is difficult to see olearly at this stage what the Sultan and the Shaikhs are really aiming at. It may be that the Shaikhs desire the abolition of the Imamate, and possibly the Sultan may acquiesce in this realising that there is no hope of being elected himself. The Sultan’s main object is to extend his influence over the hinterland and he will probably, therefore, have to rely on a network of agreements with the various Shaikhs. I cannot see these latter giving up their independence and recognising the Sultan as their suzerain, though they must bend the knee to him a little because of his control over inports. The Imam 1 s attitude will probably be guided by an endeavour to secure some inheritance for his posterity. 4. The outcome is of importance to us because Petroleum Concessions Limited (vide India Office letter No. Ext. 1758/45 of the 24th April 1945) are now considering sending a geological survey party into the Jabal in the winter of 1945-46. I think, on the whole, the present state of affairs is likely to assist our approach rather than the reverse. I am sending a copy of this letter to Peel. Yours sincerely, Sd/- A. C. Galloway. Sir Olaf Caroe, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., I.C.S., Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, New Delhi.I am afraid we do not know much about the recent relatione between the Sultan and the Imam. AkU^Vito.' When Col. Galloway visited the Jabalkbdhar in February Sheikh Harad Fin Hamid told him that his father-in-law tne Imam was very ill and not likely to live much longer; and that the Omani Sheikhs planned to divide Oman into two parts with Sulaiman Bin Har^/ar ruling the west and Isa bin Saleih the eastern part; apparently the Sultan was playing no part in this. Co]. Galloway thought that there was certainly fn °i£ game afoot” as the leading th^krhs of Oman had met at Kamil and sent a message to the sultan; and Sheikh Hamad endeavoured to sound him about the attitude of H.K.G. ”should a certain event take place” (Ext. 191 4 / 45 ). The Sheikh at Kamil sent a message to the Sultan that they v/ished to see him immediately, and eventually sent a representative to him at Dofar * The Sultan sent a reply that he would break his journey 'x’rom ifefar to Muscat at Sur and see Sulaiman Bin Eamyar ( Ext. 17S2/45 para. 74). Col. Galloway was of the opinion that the trouble was due to the mishandling of the supply situation by the Muscat customs (Ext.2247/45). The Sultan did visit Sur on May 4-5th and was well received by the Sheikhs who accepted his invitation to come to Muscat (Ext. 2875/45 para. 148 ). Sheikh Sulaiman Bin Hamyar, .. li bin Abdftultfc.

In the evening, Jhaikh Kohammed bin 3aqr al Jav/assim who is acting for his brother the Shaikh of Sharjah while the latter is in India called to see me at the Residency Agent’s house. He was accompanied by Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan the paramount Shaikh of the Naim from Dhank, Shaikh Rashid bin Hamad the principal shaikh of the Al Bu Shamis from Baraimi, and last but no r-eans least Shaikh Mohammad bin Ali bin Huweidin the paramount shaikh • of the powerful Beni : itab tribe. We had an interesting a nd extremely amusing discussion on local politics and supplies. The four Shaikhs were in good spirits and the conversation which lasted for the best part' of an hour was most amicable. 3. ^ To have induced Mohammed bin Ali bin Mawazdjim Huwaidin to visit Sharjah after an absence of ten years is rather an achievement and due credit mud: be given to Khan Bahadur Abdur Razzak for the skill with which he has handled a situation which had previously proved too much for the Shaikh of Sharjah even though that gentleman backed his invitation with the offer of gift of Rs. 80,000. At the same time it must be remembered that it is unlikely that the Residency Agent would have '^een successful so quickly if we had not held the lives of all the inhabitants o*f Trucial Oman in our hands. He are the main source of supply of their vital necessities.. Now that the ice has been broken I am hopeful of much closer relations with a body of men who are afraid of no combinations of Trucial Shaikhs and of whom the Shaikh of Dubai speaks with respect and confesses to being most reldctant to antagonize. 4. The Beni Qitab are in de facto control of the interior of Trucial Oman to the west of the central range and their area spreads from Dhaid in the north to well'' below the southern lir its of Jebel F a iyah. In my opinion their closest contacts have always been with the Shaikhs of Sharjah and there is little doubt that at one time the Shaikhs of Sharjah exercised jurisdiction over the greater part of the area which the tribe today occupies. There is even less doubt though^ that the present Shaikh of Sharjah would not have the slightest hope of exercising his authority in any part of the Beni Qitab tribal area unless it was with the consent of Shaikh Mohammed bin Ali bin Huweidin. The tribal area of the Beni Qitab is of particular interest in that it forms part of the area which Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited could with some justification maintain was within the limits of their agreement with the Shaikh of Sharjah. 5.

This step occasioned considerable difficulties with certain Governments and Rulers who declined to accept force maieure as the reason for the I.P.C’s inactivity. Company wore fhere'fore obliged to negotiate moratoriums on varying terns which at this stage of the war are unlikely to be extended. Company’s obligations in‘different concessions will nature at approximately the same time and they are therefore anxious to restart development on a programme which is designed to ensure as far as possible that all areas receive equally favourable treatment. Some of the rulers concerned have not failed to compare the I.P.C's inactivity with the increased activity of American Companies in their neighbourhood and as you know projects for American pipelines and other developments have attracted great publicity ail over the Middle East. Moreover AnericanCoys would doubtless take up any concession or licence which might lapse through the inability of the I. P.C to fulfil their obligations owing to lack of equipment etc., 2. In view of political, strategic and economic importance to our position in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf of maintaining and developing the oil concessions of British Campanies in these areas we are anxious to give the I.P.C. all possible assistance towards resuming exploration of their concessionary areas without delay. Surveys will require considerable time before drilling can usefully be undertaken to comply with concessionary obligations and it is therefore most desirable for the Company’s programme to be agreed with the United States authorities as soon as possible. 3. In our view the early resumption of I.P.C development is of special importance in order to avoid undesirable political repercussions which might well result if the local rulers should doubt our willingness or ability to live up to our opportunities and commitments. Recession of the war'fron the Middle East with the consequent reduction of allied spending nay be expected to create unemployment and economic problems. Renewal of operations by the I.P.C. will go same way towards absorbing local labour and easing local economic difficulties. N.

I also enclose a copy of a note written for the Company by Williamson. 2. From subsequent conversation with Longrigg, it appears that the Company are now definitely intending to send a small geological and mapping party next Winter to approach the Jebel Fayah Baraimi and Jebel Hafit areas from the north, to complete mapping of these areas and to make'all such local and southward contacts as they can,manage, with the cognisance of the political authorities. They also have the idea of setting up some sort of Headquarters at Baraimi with the object of acquiring goodwill locally through the distribution of gifts, and possibly the presence of a doctor. 3 • It seems unlikely that the Sultan of Muscat will derive much satisfaction from operations in this area, and I asked Longrigg whether the Company had much interest in other parts of Muscat territory at the moment. Longrigg thought that it would be easy at any time to carry out geological work in the Batinah, and that it would perhaps be less easy, but not at all impossible, to work from the South opposite Masira northwards along the western foothills in the Ja’alan and Beni Bu Ati country.

As regards the last paragraph of the note, you will find this self-explanatory on the matter of our approach to the hinterland of the coast on the stretch Ras-al-Hadd/Masura, west of the mountains. In the season of 1938/39 we had a 4 engined aircraft available and wished to fly over and photograph this area, but the Sultan was unable to authorise it. It would not be reasonable for us to take forv/ard steps in the matter with a view to air or surface exploration there without a re-assurance that the 1938/39 position no longer holds the field, but that we can in fact now get in.

As you know, the general position of the western slopes of the main Orrian range remains as it did, with rival claims to suzerainty by the Sultan of Puscat and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, while most of the lesser chiefs concerned, both of tribe and oasis, do not in practice, accept any orders from either of them and will require separate negotiation. These people are at the same time so backward and wild that the Idda of fixed physical boundaries, or of amregular oil concession, is entirely strange to them. It is therefore no use at the present stage to be do gnatic about the treatment of each of these and one can only wait the results of next season.

We shall pass you a copy in due course. As regards our exploration programme for the Trucial Coast in the autumn of 1945, our present feeling is that we are not ready, for various reasons, to undertake the geophysical work which we ultimately intend: but we wish to send a simple geological and mapping party firstly to complete our present surface information and secondly to make such further contacts with the personalities of the hinterland as will facilitate subsequent work in that area. In all this, of course, our local people will be in close liaison with yours and it seems to be in everyone’s interest to increase and improve relations with the chiefs who control Barairai, Jebel Fayah, etc. J ^ In order to have a word on these matters and to renew our personal acquaintance, I should be very glad to call upon you, if I may, one day next week, perhaps Monday or Wednesday, 16th or 18th, if either of these would suit you, at any hour which you care to designate?

To the west end ^uth, he insisted, however that they should hev * ai * me,i * Although this iadicetes a very marked ehen^* of attitude from that * iopted in 19i58, it should not b« helled with exceseive optimism, as a sign that Lotapaay men Cf’ii more in »t once. It should be remembered that the shaikha and their people are at present all dependant on the British Government for such staple articles of their diet as tea, sugar, coffee, flour, etc., and ns the locust men ere apparently harmless people whom it pleases the Government - to send in hunting locusts, they also rrs toler*t«d. Nevertheless they are ::u&gt;viag about in cars, with no attempt at dressing up as Arabs, and they are neouctoain : the inhabitants to these novelties. Thqy have also cleared tracks in certain parts. One example iu the motor track which tUynn Jones and X followed from Bharjah to Dhaid, and thence south to the foot of Xabal nodhs, (vide map 08.77-1). ?hi« is now passable through the Oman mountains by way of the fcadi nl uor to Aalbe. These locust hunters have also driven from Jh&amp;rjah to the Has© province of Saudi Arabia via Abu Dhabi and oabkhet Hstti. The Political people suggest that it i« perhaps rather early to begin tying up the *.seni whitish with formidable documents such as concessions. They suggest th«t the Sheikh of Lharjah be given the chance *p make some financial agreemont with them, so as to includo thoir territory in Sharjah concession. Then as it seems most unlikely that afcarjsh will be persuaded to disburse enough aoney for this, we could than go direct to the Beni Jhitteb and say that we want to run e survey over the whole of the Truci&amp;i Goast from the mountains to Abu Dhabi irrespective of whose territory we pass through. *s can then offer ^ them « lump ©u® to allow us to include their lend whatever may be Its limits, ^ in this ©urvey. Later, when iohameaed Ali has handled some of our money a couaensioa agree^ut eta be introduced as a means of letting him have some more. Without an agree?aent he would ondoubteiily try to extort more money out of us in the first season, but as all the other sheikhs seem to do this even with them, it would not appear to be very different. X ayself feel that this might be the best means of approach. it is virtually what I had to do with .^alkh at Jiratal in 195b. Despite all the payments made by Muscat to him, presumably to cover our survey, ho would not bu^e or allow ue to do any work until X paid up* while I fully realise* th„t A&gt;*re is o desire in «^oudon to have the boundaries clearly triced on t. map,dad the signed and witnessed egrosments ©11 filed, I venture to state that so-ae elasticity must be allowed when dec ling with the Gheikho of the interior. They themselves are guite Illiterate and are much lese aecuatofned to western weys of dealing than the oLfeikhs on the coast. They are therefore moat suspicious of any document whioa tney cannot understand, end are quite liable to give n categoris 'no' retire to the mountains if any attempt is made tc coerce them into signin f a any hard and fast sgrsement. (»Vc once had e drilling superintendent in the ° ^ Company who had the seme suspicion). Cue more point U cortf in. As X fere 7Plwnys said, nad th© Political people a*ree, tho -^ini CMttlb are in no way aubject to Muscat. They are however friendly with Dubcri rod Has al Khaitaa, but not on very tsood tema with Sharjah. In general, therefore, the Politicel c uthoritios *66 no reason why w« should not get ae far south ns Biruiml* The Albu ;Jhsiaia end Ns*la wouli have to be sj&gt;pio«ched throa t the oultnn of Muacet to let ua aa far south aa Dhenk and Yenqul.

This is © slight modification of what I %rote on page 3 of asy *ote on outstanding Concessions on lith October lest ya«r, but it stills emphasises the desirability of saUcing gradual advances to these r*»woter sheikhs.

Thank you for your letter ^Sxt, 1226/45) of Itjtn March. I note that you would object to any proposal for the conclusion of an Oil Agreement with the Headman of Fujairah. Actually, after receiving Packer's letter to which you refer, we had decided that the size of the Territory did not warrant an Agreement for which a payment, out of all proportion to the area, would probably be demanded. In any case, before entering into any negotiations, we would have followed the customary practice of seeking both your advice and assistance. It would, however, be advisable for us in the near future to consult you as to how this territory should be dealt with; we would naturally hope and prefer that it should fall under the existing Sharjah Agreement; I had in mind approaching you shortly on a similar case, viz. the 3&lt;|raimi area, in which we are particularly interested and to which, I understand, several Rulers lay claim but in which they fail to exercise any effective authority. Our Chief Geologist has recently returned from a visit to Bahrain where he discussed with the Political Agent the possibility of our undertaking geological or geophysical surveys in the Trucial Coast area during next cold season. We also have a Senior Geologist at Sharjah assisting in the location of water wells for the R.A.F. and he is investigating on the spot the local supply questions connected with such a programme. P.T.O.i ■* - 2 - I hope therefore to submit to you shortly a definite programme for your consideration. At the moment,■ u *view of the difficulties which we are experiencing in obtaining the necessary approval to the geophysical project involving the employment of American personnel and equipment, and the local supply difficulties, it rather looks as though we shall have to limit next season’s work to a geological party. This party would carry out geological reconnaissance and thereby prepare the way, both technically and by contact with the Rulers and Shaikhs concerned, for the larger and expensive geophysical programme in the cold weather season 1946/7.

Mr. Packer brought Mr. N.E* Baker (American) and Mr. F*E. Sellings (British) geologists of the Iraq Petroleum Company to see me this morning in connection with a geo physical survey of the Trucial Coast concession areas. Mr. Baker informed me that it was their intention to embark on a programme which might last for a matter of from two to three years. No definite decision has yet been taken but enquiries were now being made with regard to the possibility of obtaining transport, equipment, and supplies. If all these items were forthcoming there was little doubt that the survey would be commenced in the coming autumn. He stated that it was their primary intention to deal with the coastal area to a depth of approximately fifty kilometers from Ras-al-. Khaimah to the base of the Qatar peninsula. When this had been completed they would probably turn to the more remote eastern areas and hoped that with the co-operation of the Sultan of Muscat they would be able to work their way to the £*11 th Arabian coast. He went on to add that not only were they themselves interested in increasing their knowledge of the areas for which they held concessions but that they understood that the Sultan of Muscat was somewhat disappointed at the lack of progress which has been made recently and therefore A determined effort was being made to make the survey as soon as possible. .e Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., /3. itical Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.ft ?« 3 - / * 4- V' 2 . 3.

A base will probably be established at Sharjah or pubai and the parties will radiate out from that base. 4. The geologists referred in passing to the activities of Captain Buie (in this connection please see my telegram No.338 dated the 13th deptember 1944) and repeated the offer v/hieh. had already been made to provide a geologist should the Koyal Air Force desire further information with regard to the possibility of obtaining water in the neighbourhood of flharjah.

LERMITTS^DECEMBER 1944, ■ (Enclosure to Bahrain letter No, DO/SA.1/3875 dated 7th Jan At the time of our approach to the Ruler of Umm-al- Quwain (Feb, 1939) there were outstanding blood feuds between him and Mohamed bin Ali, chief of the Bani Kitab tribe, who normally resides in the Dhaid-Jabal Faiyah area. V* •r. At the same time the Company had invoked Article 10 of the Political Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company with a view to obtaining the decision of the Political Resident as to what further action could be taken to facilitate the free movement of the company’s geologists of other personnel within the Jabal Faiyah area, which the Ruler of Sharjah had been unable to arrange. The position was being watched with keen interest by all the Trucial Coast Rulers and resulted in a great deal of intrigue and false rumours. It was regarded by all the Coastal Rulers as a test case between Coastal Ruler and inland tribe, and they were anticipating a similar throwing off of allegiance by their own inland ’’subjects”. Mohamed bin Ali who virtually controls the Jabal Faiyah area was prepared to resist any penetration, and Sharjah subject, and others, were shot at when approaching the district. The Political Resident’s intervention took the form of notifying the Ruler of Sharjah that the Company must be all nved to make their own arrangements to visit the area. The Company in conjunction with the Political Department approached the Regent of Kalba to facilitate the visit, but without success. v The Political Agent, Major Hickinbotham, informed us in September 1944 that he had established contacts with Mohamed bin Ali which, he hopes, will be maintained. Owing to the foregoing it is not surprising that the Ruler of Umra-al-Quwain was disinclined to commence telks for an oil agreement, his territory bordering on that of both Sharjah and the area dominated by Mohamed bin Ali. As no progress was made in the negotiations no figure was mentioned. The Ruler did, however, express his desire for a Concession and not an exploration permit, and wished that his two brothers be informed of the (fesirability of this. At a later meeting this point was made clear to the two brothers.

Hickinbotham, C.I.E., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, SUBJECT . Outstanding Concession Areas. I have the honour to refer to ray telegram No. 819 dated the 7th September 1944 and to enclose a copy of Messrs. Petroleum Concession Limited*s letter No.DO/SA. 1/3861 of the 16th December 1944 with copies of correspondence which has taken place sinee the despatch of my telegram under reference. 2. Mr. Packer, in his demi-official letter under reference, raises two important questions and gives an indication of his company*s future policy. I assume from paragraph 2 of Mr. Packer*s letter that the '’authorities' who are being sounded by the Managing Director will consult you before any decision is arrived at. I should like however to take this opportunity to say that I am convinced that we should do everything we can to close the Trucial Coast door to enterprising nationals of the western hemisphere. 3. The first question raised by Mr. Packer is that of the delineation of the boundaries of the Trucial Shaikhdoms. I can see no objection to Mr. Lermitte recording his views on this subject and consider that we should examine his draft and check the data on which his conclusions are based. We should also endeavour to discover whether any of the projected boundaries are in accord with the views of the States concerned. This could be done by the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, and Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzak whose investigations should leave us in no doubt with regard to the boundaries which would probably be dis puted. The data thus obtained will enable us to decide the magni- ! tude of the task with which we will be confronted when it becomes ' necessary for these boundaries to be demarcated. I suggest that I should inform Mr. Packer that we would welcome the opportunity of examining Mr. Lermitte's report. 4. The second question which Mr. Packer has raised has to do with the advisability of a geologist accompanying the Anti-Locust party which is to operate on the Trucial Coast in the spring of 1946. It is true that tribal leaders found it difficult to credit that last season's anti-locust campaign was solely concerned with the extermination of those insects, but I see no reason why we should confirm their doubts of our veracity by introducing oil geologists into the party this season. I consider that the anti locust party should not be connected in any way with any commercial enterprise for if it were it is not improbable that it might meet with opposition in certain of the desert areas. With close contact which is now being established daily * with the more remote tribes of the interior I consider that when they recommence operations it is unlikely that Messrs.Petroleum Concession Limited will have any serious difficulty in their exploration work. 5&lt;, I propose to ihfrom the Air Officer Commanding,Habbaniya, who is expected here today, of Mr. Wheatley*s offer of geological assistance with regard to the water wells on the Trucial Coast and inform Mr. Packer of the action which I have taken. I I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd.T. HICKINBOTHAM, Poll t. i Cttl:okfiplrtul P.C.L. . DO/SA/l/3861.

Mr. Wheatley, writing for the Managing Director, states that the Company is ' Anxious to obtain agreements covering the areas mentioned, particularly Umm-al-Quwain'. He adds that steps are being taken to sound the authorities as to whether the present time is opportune for approaches to the various Rulers and we shall receive instructions in due course. 3. He is also very interested in our efforts to obtain information on the probable boundaries of Umm-al-Quwain and suggests that similar efforts should be made in respect of other shaikhdoms where we already hold concessions or propose to negotiate. Lermitte is preparing a report on boundaries from the information he has been able to collect during his journeys and he has been asked to quote his authorities. Before sending ti is report to London, we should very much like to send it to you for your confirmation where possible and any comments and amplification you are able to offer. 4. You t &amp;y remember that in cur above mentioned letter para. 15 (c) we referred to the recent water drilling at Sharjah. Mr. Wheatley asks us to bring it to your notice that if any geological assistance is required on the Trucial Coast in regard to water wells, the Company will be only too pleased to provide such assistance if at all possible. 5. Reference para 15 (a), hr. Wheatley points out that the Company would like to have the opportunity of attaching a geologist to the locust party planned for the spring of 1946. If this can be arranged, the Company would prefer to send Mr. T.F. / i Hi am son who has some experience already in the hinterland, he have been instructed to inquire from you if the fact that Mr. Williamson is known to be an oil company *golegist would be an embarrassment. Yve rather gathered from you that the bhaikhs and tribal leaders took the view that last yea^s expedition was not primarily concerned with locusts. In this case, concealment would seem of little importance. ( The point at which a Company geologist would Join the party would need to be decided). 6 . Perhaps you will be good enough to let us know if we can send our ' boundary” report to you for comments and your views on the suggestion for Mr. Willianson , s attachment to the next locust expedition.

DO/ga/I^/ 3797 dated the loth August 1944 and DO/SA 1/3810 dated the 28th August 1944 and telegram No. 1013 sent you through the India Office. 2. As explained in our letters, it was our original intention to bring to your notice the situation regarding outstanding concession areas and obtain the Managing Director s policy in the matter before discussing or referring it to the Political Agent locally ( for the information of the Hon»ble the Political Resident). 3. To assist the Managing Director to make his decisions, the information on outstanding areas which we had available witnout calling on Political sources was incorporated in our above mentioned letters and notes attached to No. 3810. 4. In subsequent conversations, however, with Major Hickinbotham ( Political Agent, Bahrain ), it was revealed that certain sections of our information required correetion and amplification^. Our original letters and notes, therefore, were the subject of discussion on the 17th of September ( presents- Major Hickinbotham, Mr. Packer and Mr. Lermitte), and the more important results from the oil concession aspect incorporated in paras 5-16 of this letter together with some general notes in the form of an appendix. You will note that in this appendix we do not attempt to discuss hinterland areas or Ruus-al-2tD58K. Jiuaj.. Information to be obtained on these areas is mostly either not first hand or not up to date. It would take much time and study to paint a true picture of conditions and control in these areas which would be useful from the Company’s angle in planning exploration. 5. List of outstanding areas d iscussed with Political. (a) Ummal Quwain. (b) Fujairah. (c) A1 Hamriyah. (d) hi Haira. (e) Hinterland Areas. (f) Ruus-Al-Jibal Peninsula. (g) Dibah. This list is regarded by the Political iigent as sufficient! comprehensive and he does not consider there are any more areas requiring consideration. 6 . In general, the Political Agent took the view that it was definitely desirable that an oil agreement should be concluded , \ with Umm al Quwain. 7. As regards Fujairah, the Ruler has himself raised the question of an oil agreement on two occasions. The Political Agent, however, is not prepared to offer any official comments on the desirability or otherwise of an oil agreement.view is hat, should circumstances arise making it desirable to 9. The Political agent stated that many of the h&amp;pl&amp;KK hinter land areas are throretlcally in the hands of the Trucial Coast Rulers and/or H.H the Sultan of Muscat, and it was hoped that the Rulers concerned would themselves be in a position to come to agreements with the hinterland shaikhs which would permit of exploration in the areas of interest to the Company. Possible exceptions were the Ban! Kitab and Bani Kaab tribal leaders, with whom it might be necessary to obtain separate agreements later, particularly if exploration extended to drilling. 10. The Political Agent explained that the, extensive Ruus-Al- Jibal peninsula was recognised by H.M.G. as Muscat territory and, therefore, covered by the Muscat Concession, as regards its exploration, H.H. the Sultan would doubtless wish to make very careful arrangements for the security of Company personnel as in normal times it is rarely necessary for him to exercise his authority. His representative is a Wali at Khassab on the west coast. 11 . Pibah. The Political Agent pointed but that Dibah consists of three sections - the northern section under Muscat, the centre section belonging to Kalbah and the southern one to Fujairah. Fo: the purpose of oil agreements, he took the view that the northern and centre sections are already covered by our Muscat and Kalbah Concessions while the southern portion would be included in any oil agreement concluded with Fujairah. It is being assumed that the Regent of Kalba recognises that his section of Dibah is covered by the Kalba Oil Agreement. 12. You will notice, therefore, that this southern section of Pibah will not be covered unless the Company decides to make an agreement with Fujairah. 13. Our own views are that it is necessary to conclude an oil agreement with the Ruler of Umm al Quwain who has an agreement with H.M.G. on the subject of the grant of oil concessions. In the case of Fujairah, the fact that the Ruler has shown a decided interest in oil matters, in our view, makes it desirable for the Company to come to terms with him unless the Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf advises against it. lie has no oil specific mention of the southern section of Dibah. 14. You will realise, of course, that with the geological information at present at our disposal it has not been posdble to take oil prospects into consideration. It is believed that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company geologists have made reports on certain of these areas now under discussion. ( Some references are made to geologists in notes attached.) 15. Hinterland Areas - Miscellaneous . come to an understanding with the Rulers, a very much modified oi; agreement based on these circumstances should suffice. Ne have any oil agreement with H.M.G. Neither agreement with H.M.G. Any agreement with Fujairah should contain (a) Lpcusts Party . Para. 8 of our letter Ho.DC/SA/l/3810 dated ^ the 28th August, 1944. The Political Agent states that the party travelledin the hinterland under arrangements made by him, and that a Political Officer accompanied the party toBaraimi. Drivers were Palestinians who gave some trouble and were eventually evacuated by air from Sharjah. n Friends ' from Abu Dhabi ficcompanied the party. Their Suadi friends left them after the work in the Saudi territory was completed. The Locusts party travelled through the Trucial Coast shaikhdoms, thence to Muscat and back via Wadi Kor - Abu Bakara ( Batineh Coast 10 miles south of Kalbah)o They are to return again this year, and the Political Agent thinks that it should be possible for a Company representative to contact them and benefit from their experiences. In any case, the Political Agent takes the view that the inhabitants of these remote areas are less likely to resent the appearance of motor convoys in their territories in future as a result of the locusts party*s visits. The fact also that they tolerated the visitors, although expressing open disbelief in the purpose of the visits, lends support to the assumption that the appearance of oil survey parties will not be obstructed. (b) MQh f d Ali Al Huwaidin ( Banl Kitab ) the elusive Moh , d Ali whose good offices were deemed so desirable, if not actually essential, to exploration in the Jabal Faiyah area. He hopes to maintain this contact. (c) Water Drilling - Sharjah . that the Royal Air Force at Bharjah have found i t necessary, in view of expansion, to take steps to increase their water supply. It was hoped to locate artesian water, and an American geologist named Buie from Cairo was employed to recommend a drilling site. In this connection, the geologist made a journey from Sharjah to the south end of Jabal Faiyah, thence east to the base of the Oman Mountains, then westwards to Dhaid and finally to Ras al Khaimah. The journey was made under the protection of Moh*d Ali and the Bani Kitab. It was eventually decided to drill to a deptji of 300 feet near the Shaikh of Sharjah’s garden, just north of the R.A.F. Camp, Sharjah. 16. I£i conclusion!, we should like to stress that too much reliance should not be placed on the information and views expressed in this report, and all possible sources of information should be investiggted before the Company is committed to any decisions as regards outstanding Concession or Option Agreements and before arrangements are put in hand for exploration in the more remote areas• The Political Agent, Bahrain, has been given a copy of this letter.

S.A. Petroleum Administrator for War in order to obtain the necessary staff and equipment from the U. S.A., since these are apparently unobtainable in this country at the moment. They have already secured Treasury sanction to the dollar expenditure involved. Mr. Wheatley, told us that P.C.L. have in mind another expedition to the BaraiSPs oasis and the Jebel Paiyah - Jebel Hafit area, probably in two parts, (i) a small preliminary geological napping party, and (2) a larger geophysical survey party to follow on, the latter to include a number of American geophysical experts since at present apparently there are no British ones. P,C.L’s plans are, however, not yet finally worked out and they have promised to let us have something more definite in writing about the middle of March. In any case everything depends on the approval of the American P.A.W. I an, therefore, writing to you now merely to let . you Know in a preliminary way what is in the air.

They^asked our support for a programme costing about ,2150,000 a year of which £65,000 would be in dollars. The dollar cost is principally in connection with technical staff and instruments which are not at present available from U.K. and which will have to be obtained from the States. We obtained Treasury approval for the necessary dollar expenditure for five years as we thoroughly approved of the proposals. The suggestion made by the Political Agent, Muscat, in the enclosure to your letter will con sequently find a ready hearing, but you will appreciate the renewal of activity by the Company depends on the time it will take to procure essential geophysical per sonnel and instruments from U.S.A. We are supoorting their request for these in Washington,, but they may not be forthcoming in time for work to begin in 1 945 / 46 . t ■ The Company have carried out all the necessary geological work in the more accessible coastal areas of Muscat and Oman.

Reference India Office Express Letter No.Ext.5255/46 dated the 20th August 1946. 2. At an interview on the 15th September I informed the Sultan that His Majesty’s Government were unable to give him the assistance of the R.A.P. in his scheme for the subjugation of Oman by force for the reasons stated in paragraph 1 of India Office telegram No.12479 dated the 7th July 1946. 3* The Sultan took the news very calmly but said that it meant Vie must definitely abandon the scheme referred to above which means that at any rate for the present he will not require the arms asked for vide correspondence ending with my telegram No.l/205 dated the 28th May 1946. 4. The Sultan still hopes however that when the Imam dies the tribes of the interior will ask him to rule over them. In reply to a question of mine he stated that he could almost certainly secure election as Imam but that he did not v/ish this as it would mean the continuance of an elective Imamate. He wishes to abolish the Imamatc altogether and incorporate Oman in Muscat State. 5. On the subject of oil exploration I spoke to him on the lines proposed, in paragraphs 5 and 6 of my Express Letter No.C/525 dated the 24 th July 1946 emphasising the point made in your express letter under reply. He promised to think the whole matter over and let the Political Agent have his reply. He did however say that he would have no objection to the P.C.L. negotiating direct with the tribes at Ibri provided ground exploration only was intended and his position under the agreement was safeguarded and that he had already agreed to the Vfndj Howasinah being visited. He pointed out that Ibri was directly under the Imam’s control - it is actually the headquarters of one of his Walis - and expressed some doubt whether the tribesmen who had invited Lermitto to visit their country (vide paragraph 3 of my express letter No.c /525 of 24th July) did so with the Imam’s concurrence.

The following is an extract from a letter which I received this morning from Baker, our Chief Geologist, to which, I am afraid, there is not likely to be anything to add for some monthss- 'Reference your letter of July 16th concerning a survey of the hinterland of the mountain range of Muscat and Oman to be carried out with an airborne magnetometer, word has just been received from the most likely source of such an instrument which makes it clear that it will be several months before a suitable airborne magnetmeter will be available. Unless the improvements in the instrument and clearance of patent agreements are mcr e speedily remedied, there is only a slight chance that we shall be able to secure one of the instruments in time for this seasons work. So far as we know there is only one instrument which is considered sufficiently accurate for oil finding uses. This is controlled by the U.S. Navy but its release is being held up by companies who have claims to basic patents; until these rights are adjusted the instrument is not apt to be released for general use. Other instruments held by individuals are not accepted by geophysicists as sufficiently accurate- 2 - Considering all the preparation necessary after a satisfactory insturment- is secured it seems impractical to make any promise that the proposed Oman-Muscat airborne magnetometer survey will be carried out this 1946-1947 season.” We shall make the survey, if we can, as soon as the instrument, becomes available. i Yours sincerely. ‘fir r-v F.A.K.

Dear Sir, I have the honour to refer to Concessions held by Petroleum Development •■(Qatar) Limited and Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited in the Persian Gulf areas implied by the names of these Companies. You will recall that political agreements were signed by the Companies concerned in respect of each of the Concessions obtained from the rulers of these territories. One requirement of these political agreements (Article 3) is that 'the employees of the Company in shall at all times be British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh, provided that, with the consent of His Iviajesty's Government, such persons of other nationality as are required for the efficient carrying on of the undertaking may be employed.” During the winter season of 1946/47 the Companies propose to employ one team of geophysicists in the carrying out of a Seismic survey of Qatar, and another team to carry out a gravity meter and magne^juafitaj^survey on the Trucial Coast. nsist of American1^2 - 2 - The Under-Secretary of State for India. 12th June, 1946. American personnel, of about seven individuals for the former and up to eleven for the latter. You ^rill appreciate that British personnel for this pu /‘ose does not at present exist. The individuals who will compose these teams are in most but not all cases already working for this Company and its Associates in the Middle East, Iraq and Palestine. It is, however, not yet possible to inform you with full accuracy of the names of those who will in fact be working, with effect from September or October, in Qatar and on the Trucial Coast. These names will be reported to you as soon as they are established. The work in Qatar is expected to last for three months and that on the Trucial Coast for the full winter season from September or October 1946 to April or May 1947. It is hoped that you will find no objection to the arrangements herein proposed. A second clause of Article 3 of the political agreements provides that u the importation of foreign native labour shall be subject to the approval of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.' Steps will, therefore, be taken in due course to acquaint the Political Resident with particulars of any foreign native12th June, 1946 The Under-Secretary of State for India. native labour which it may be necessary to import temporarily into these territories, and his agreement will be obtained.

In view of our forthcoming assumption of responsibility of the Persian Gulf we have been looking at the question of the possible settlement of frontier disputes between the various Trucial Sheikhdoms and the problem of enforcing any decision which may be reached. In this connexion we have seen your letter to Donaldson No. DQ104/—S o f the— 30th May, 1947 and Galloway's express letter to the India /AY? Office No. 1400/3 of the 29th July, 1947. With the growing interest in oil development on the Trucial Coast it certainly seems desirable, if it is at all possible, to settle the frontiers between the Trucial Sheikhs and the frontiers between certain of them and Muscat; and any definition of the lateral boundaries of the Trucial Sheikhdoms would also assist us should it at some time be necessary to divide up the Continental Shelf of the Persian Gulf. The difficulties, of course, are great and there is the added complication that we do not want to stir up the question of frontiers between the Trucial Sheikhs and Saudi Arabia if it can be avoided. We should much appreciate it ii you could let us have your appreciation of the whole problem, including the question of enforcement. My preliminary feeling about the latter question is that however desirable it might be to have some kind of local force as in Aden, this would presumably cost money and that in our present financial circumstances it would probably be very difficult indeed to obtain sanction for the expenditure.

We were rot prepared to agree to tliis and the Saudi proposal was ignored in subsequent oorreapondeice. It remained our view that the unconditional oral assurance given by Fuad Hamza was valid# The correspondence with the Saudi Government died out in 1938 and has not been renewed since# Without making enquiries of the Saudis and of the Californian Standard Mil Company, which would stir up iore trouble than they are worth, we cannot be absolutely sure but our impression is that the Company were given a W# D.

In the course of the conversation Longrigg said that liis Cc&amp;ipany had already been operating in the J ebel Nakhsh area and implied that they mi$vt try to ope ate south of the concession line; Garran warned him that they should keep within the liaits of their concession. To complete the story I should add that Thesiger, the explorer, called the other day. From what he said it appears that (i) all the Dhofar tribes owe allegiance to the Sultan of ..uscat, so ir'ctroleir.

No action can be taken in this matter until officers are made available for the Gulf to enable Jackson to take up his post on the Trucial Coast. 3 * It is, in my opinion, optimistic to hope that the question can be settled in a few weeks; the dispute regarding the boundary has been going on for years and its settlement is likely to take time. An agreement reached at a meeting of the two Rulers in 1937 was abrogated by one party almost immediately afterwards. The abhorrence of the Shaikhs to settle anything at all must be taken into account over this important matter, and while it may be easy enough to get their agreement to make a start the possibility that they may procrastinate, e.g. by calling witnesses from far afield, should not be overlooked. It will, of course, be for the arbitrator to decide on the admissibility of evidence tendered but as the possession of great wealth is at issue due con sideration must be given to all evidence either party wishes to call. 4 . If agreement is reached the definition of the boundary should be followed immediately by its demarcation in order to prevent either party from backing down on the agreement, a device commonly resorted to on the Trucial Coast. • 5. If either party enquires whether the definition of the boundary is connected with the question of oil — and there is every probability of such enquiry being made — I think there should be no question but that both parties must be so informed in order to forestall a possible complaint later by a dissatisfied party that he has been misled. Stress could however be laid on the necessity for the definition of the frontier from the point of view of the fixing of the responsibility under the concestlons for the safety of working parties, rather than on the possible presence of oil. 347 )* To--v6* It should be appreciated that if the TW Rulers agree to accept the award of the arbitrator will have to be prepared, if necessary, to enforce the award by the application of sanctions or other methods which may suggest themselves. This would be a departure from the long-standing policy of non-interference on land, but owing to oil developments on the Trucial Coast the time has come when a change in policy is unavoidable. 7* Finally in view of our responsibility towards these Rulers, and of the immense benefits that will accrue to the Ruler and people of a State in which oil is found, it seems essential that the boundary line should be detemined without regard to geological factors except where taking them into account would not cause gain to one party at the expense of the other. To give greater weight to geological factors, as suggested by the Oil Company&gt; would not be compatible with our oblig ations to these Rulers* Sd. A. C.GAIiOWAT Political Resident, Persian Gulf.

I also think before very long we shall have to establish some kind of Government force similar to the Aden Protectorate Levies on the Trucial Coast. Up to the present control from the sea through His Majesty s sloops in the Gulf has been adequate but with oil develop ment in the offing we must have some force available on land to keep the peace between the petty local Shaikns who are constantly warring not only with each other but with their own relatives and the more or less independent tribes of the interior. tL ' J tfLt ^ JU^ /rvWty* ^ Irk W ^ ^ •/ ^ JffU ^ h • E.

No. TLA.2/4768 dated the 6th arch, 1947. We understand from our London principals that they have been in correspondence with the India Office on the question of boundaries between the various Sheikhdoms on the Trucial coast. Our principals tooK the view that boundaries should be settled prior to drilling or other intense activity which could reveal to the Shaikhs the position of potential oil fields. It is understood that the India Office prefer not to undertake a general boundary demarkation but would prefer to limit rulings uo cases of possible dispute. 2. We consider a case in point has now arisen between Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Geo-physical work this season 1946-47 indicates two separate potential oil fields, both partially in disputed territory, and it is highly desirable to estab lish ownership before intensive worK next season reveals the Company's interesc in the disputed area and gives the Shaikhs ideas on its value co them. Actuary for the next two seasons geo-physical and seismic work will, in all probability, be concentrated on the Abu Dhabi side, which may be expected to intensify and extend Dubai claims. 3. Our geologists have puc forward an idea that in certain circumstances, where at all feasible and where a disputed area lends itself to it, the bo ndary line could with advantage be drawn on a geological basis, thus avoiding the splitting of an oil field Involving the Company in all the evils attendant upon such a situation. Such evils could easily include pro longed litigation in connection with oil royalties, or hosti- Udt lities between Shaikhdoms o? tribes. The geologists further state that these circumstances apply in the Dubai Abu Dhabi area, and that the red line on the attached map, by a useful coinci dence, both separates two potential oil fields in the area Jabal All south-westward to Khor Ghanadah, and divides approximately centrally a disputed territory, (provided the Company's infor mation on the disputed territory is correct). A line drawn elsewhere it is believed would split a structure or potential oil field. 4. We have been instructed by London to approach you locally with a view to obtaining a ruling on the boundary between Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the disputed area, and if appropriate we shall be pleased to hear if consideration can be given to the Company's suggestion that the geological factor in this case should be taken into account. As explained above time is short, as next season's geo-physical work will commence in September/ October. 5. In conclusion we would make.it clear that our use of the term 'potential oil field' should not be taken to mean that oil has been located, but that possible structures exist.

Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident, Persian Gulf. As regards paragraph 3 of your letter I am not really sure whether it will be necessary to decide the Dubai-Sharjah as well as the Dubai-Abu Dhabi boundary, but, at first sight, it seemed to me that we could hardly define only a portion of the latter and that it would be simpler to carry on the line defining Dubai teiritory completely (which would involve demarcating at least portion of the Dubai-Sharjah frontier) rather than to attempt to define the much larger area of Abu Dhabi, but it may well be biht on examination it will be found possible to lay down a line suitable for the oil company's purposes ending at an arbitrary point in the desert. I must say, however, that I have never been very happy about this 'ad hoc' approach to the problem and if the Shaikhs get it into their heads that whenever we lay down a line, oil development will surely follow, I think there are bound to be difficulties. What is really required and long overdue is a Political Agent on the Trucial Coast who can really get down to such thorny problems as this, and work out proposals for solving theip.OREIGN OFFICE, ' 13th Hay, I do not know whether* yoti have been kept informed by the Government of India or any o# er sourae about the geological survey which Sir Cyril S, Fox, late Director of the Geological Survey of India, has been undertaking for the Sultan of Huscat and Oman. We have not yet seen a copy of Sir Cyril’s report to the Sultan, but we understand that Sir Cyrial has reported favourably on the possibility of exploiting certain hard mineral resources in the province of Dhufar, and that he considers that there is a possibility of oil iDeing found there. Oil Company exploration for oil in the area will therefore probably begin this autumn. In a letter to the Government of India, Sir Cyrial states that the 'climate of Dhufar is good, there is more water than I think they have realised is available, both at the surface and underground. There i an anchorage in Pisit Bay and a landing ground at Salaiah (and an emergency landing ground near Muscat). The Sultan needs, in my opinion, agricultural advice - on sugar-cane etc., and surveys of Dhufar as the maps are on too small a scale for geological mapping or engineering purposes.' We understand that the Political Resident will be calling on you next month on his way home, and we suggest that you may care to discuss with him the desirability of British Middle Hast Office offering agricultural advice to the Sultan W.

I enclose a tracing from one of Bertram Thomas* maps, on which the Sultan has marked what he considers to be the western boundary of Dhofar. The Sultan says that this boundary follows natural features, is not disputed and was the subject of a letter forwarded to the Political Agent, Muscat, by tie Sultan’s father in 1929* I will endeavour to trace, and forward to you, a copy of this letter on my return to Muscat. 3* The Sultan states that the Mahra country is all to the west of this boundary and that the Mahras have no tribal rights or land in Dhofar though they are occasionally to be met in the province. * • 4* When Altounyan visited the Sultan in January, he apparently promised the Sultan that the Petroleum Concessions Limited would send a party of geologists to explore Dhofar in October this year. The Sultan is confident that he can make adequate arrangements for their protection in most parts of the province but that provided he is told of the places they wish to visit before they go, he will indicate to them whether or not his protection will be effective. 5. Sir Cyril Pox’s verbal report has so encouraged the Sultan that if the Petrobum Concessions Limited do not start serious exploration in this area soon, he will certainly assume that The Hon. Lt. Col.

I found Dhofar astonishingly attractive, but the mineral resources are of a kind that require enterprising people (which the Arabs are not): They might even prove obstructive* ''T ^re is a possibility of oil but the borings would have to be-done on the Jabal Qara and will be costly, but I think worthwhile. It will require British or .American capital and skill. It is for this reason that I advised the Sultan to have ny Report printed and published and sent to the most useful newspapers in the U.S.A. and U.K. etc. for review. The Sultan could go on a tour about the same time to the U.K. and U.S.A. and so be readily accessible to industrial financiers. It is of course not absolutely certain that there is payable oil. There is always the risk of the oil having leaked away, but this is worth proving one way or the other* The structure is correct in general. A detailed map is necessary and there are no maps available on a scale of even 4 miles to an inch (which is a little on the small side for geological details). In ny opinion Cement, Chemicals and Sugar are obviously possible industries, and more uses for cocoanut by-products. The cultivation of olives, etc. is also possible. It is not worth a detailed geological survey by the Government except for oil and this is best done by a good lessee on reasonable terras (to attract a good company to make a try).(M- £ l. 5,, Loudon Oourt, i Moira street, , n Calcutta. j 347 ! r—P 7 IsTTEfcb 19«7 '. a ■ '7X- Prom To Sir Cyril S.Fox, late Director, Geologreal Survey of India. ■ * , *2, *&lt;'1 The Secretary, Covermient of India, xEx&amp;b Department of External Affairs, New Delhi.

Sir, With reference to above subject and my recent investigations in Dhufar on behalf of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and 'Oman, I enclose a letter which I would be grateful for transmission to him. a copy of the correspondence is attached for your reference and record (particularly paragraphs 3 and 5 of my letter to the Sultan). His Highness is staying at the Palace at Salalah, Dhufar, and he asked me to have my letters and report sent through you to the Resident at Aden. I understood thau by so doing the Resident at Aden would send on such correspondence through the kind offices of the Royal Air Force if you were kind enough to make the request. As you will see from my letter to the Sultan, my report will take another 10 days or so to complete as 1 must await the results of the chemical analysts. Mjty I thank you for all the arrangements made for my journey to Salalah. I would like to say also that in the person of the Sultan of uscat and 'Oman the Government of India have a sincere friend, and that the Ru:er is most anxious to open up his country. The climate of Dhufar is good, there is more water than I think they have realised is available, both at the surface and underground. There is an anchorage in Risut Bay and a landing ground at Salalah (and an emergency landing ground near Muscat). The Sultan needs, in my opinion, agricultural advice - on sugar-cane etc., and surveys of Dhufar As the maps are on too small a scale for geological mapping or engineering purposes. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Signed) Cyril S. Fox.V 5, London Goutt, Moira Street, Calcutta. 1st March, 1947. % Sir Cjiril S. Fox. i t I A His Highness, The Sultan of Muscat and •Oman, at Sslalah, Dhufar Province, South East Arabia. Subject:- A mineral audit of the Industrial Resources of Dhufar Province. I have the honour to say that I arrived back in India on the 17th February, 1S47, after my visit and tours in Dhufar and brought with me all the specimens I collected and which I thought should be examined more thoroughly than was possible at Salalah. The specimens for chemical analysis have been handed to Messrs. R.V. Briggs &amp; Co., 3 &amp; 4, Garstin Place, Calcutta* The fossils and some of tne mineral and rock specimens have been sent to the Director, Geological Survey of India, 27 Chowringhee, Calcutta, for indentification or determination. In the meanwhile 1 have searched the literature dealing with south-eastern iirabia, and Muscat and 'Oman, and particularly with regard to Dhufar. The chief papers are of course those of H.J. Carter of 1846 or a century ago, and G.M. Lees of 1928, for accurate geological information. I have read very carefully 'Southern Arabia' by Mr &lt;1 Mrs. Theodore Bent as well as 'ARabia Felix' by Mr. Bertram Thomas, for data they collected, but I have made a thorough scrutiny of all available literature on travel on S.E. Arabia. Carter, the Bents and others have recorded their difficult ies due to tribal disturbances, and Mr. Lees has said that without the hospitality of the Sheikhs it would be impossible to carry out explorations. This relates to barely 15 years ago. It is therefore my duty to record that those sheikhs and others who were my guides and helpers across the Qara Mountains were most attentive and kind and most anxious that their assistance, if useful, should be made known to yourself. This shows^tiiMt 'the Bultan's writ' does now - cover a much larger area tha n previously. Although I have begun the draft of the report 1 will have to wait, perhaps a week longer, for tne assays, etc., before 1 can complete and forward it as I said I would do in duplicate. Meanwhile I will be sending a rough Cover Page and Title Page (typed copy) of the broyfchure as it might be published. Please return the copy if it necessary to make emendations. The actual publication cannot be taken in hand until you have read and approved of the report. It is impossible to thank you for all your kindness and considerations, but 1 will cherish the memory of a Ruler who is anxious to lift his people and country. Yours sincerely, (Signed). Cyril S.

In it, I indicated that the day was now not distant when we should wish to commence drilling on the Trucial Coast and that we felt it would be essential that the rights over any given drilling site or potential oilfield (that is, in exactly which ohaikhdom it fell) should be established beyond question before drilling began. It is not improbable that some such sites or possible oilfields may lie in areas susceptible of dispute by the adjacent Rulers, or (in a slightly different case) between a Ruler from whom we hold rights and a Tribe, claiming to be independent, from whom v/e do not. You confirmed our existing view that such boundary settlements would be the function of the Political Resident or Political Agent and you encouraged me to think that if and vrhen such a case were referred to him, he would adjudicate on it and thus place the matter beyond doubt: evidently a most necessary thing since conflicting and unresolved claims to a site which might prove valuable would be a source of endless trouble and danger, I propose to send a copy of this letter to our Manager at Bahrain with the suggestion that he should approach the P,.a, or P.R, in this sense, hoping for a reply, or replies, to questions in one of two forms (a)’’is Point ’A’ definitely within the area of Shaikh ’X 1 , or is it susceptible of any dispute? 'or (b) 'can you please tell us ,alternatively , what is the line of demarcation between the Shaikhdoms of Shaikh ’Y’ and Shaikh ’Z’?' I understood from you, as I should have expected, that you would prefer not to undertake a general boundary demarcation of the area, but would prefer Political to limit their rulings to points of possible dispute, Yours sincerely. fK..*— 5, », 1,LiDIA OFFICE, *'kt xt. 497/47.

TZV'* ■ ^ / V-- INDEXED ibc LING HOUSE, DOMINION STREET, LONDON, E.C.2. 3rd warch, 1947 My dear Harrison, I refer to your letter dated 3rd December, 1946 and. to previous correspondence regarding the mission of Mr. Altounyan to Dhofar. I attach herewith a copy of a Report which we have now received from him. It is clear that the security (and even to some extent the transport and supply) position along the coast of the Jhofar Crescent is fairly good, but we have already had Geologists in that area. As regards the Hinterland up to and into the Sands to the North, North-West and West, the Sultan gives an optimistic picture and I believe a party would be quite safe unless in the event of a major raid from outside his territories: and even such a raid would be aimed at \Camels rather them Geologists. u : e may, therefore, decide to send a mobile Camel-riding Geological party into the Dhofar Hinterland in the 1947/48 Season. If so, is it safe to assume that H.M.G., while accepting no responsibility for the life and limb of the party, would at any rate not veto it? Yours sincerely. F.A.K. Harrison, Esq., India office, Whitehall, S.W.l.MEMORANDUM Ae a speoiftl envoy of Petroleum Concessions Limited, London, Hr, Altounyen visited the Sultftn of muscat, Uraftn, and Dhufar, at Malalah in December, 1946, The object of the visit was to discuss with the ^Sultan oil exploration prospects of DliUPAR in accordance with the terras the Dhufar Oil Agreement dated 24th June, 1937, It had been known for some time that the Sultan was anxious for an immediate survey of DHUFAR to commence and extend beyond what was done in 1938 when a survey party explored a limited area around Salalah with negative results. It had also been learned from the Political Resident at **JSCAT that the Sultan had been contemplating allocating DHUFAR to another oo pany. In the discussions that took place between the Sultan and the Company’s representative, it was pointed out that it was the Co pany*s aim and intention to extend the survey northwards as far as the Sands and weswards to the MAHRA country but that the Sultan himself, as recently as April, 1946, had been discouraging and had expressed doubts about physical security. That if assurances of physical security were forthcoming in a definite form, the Co ipany would make great efforts to put in a party based on DHUFAR during the season of 1947/1948, Further, the Company did not feel that the Multan's contemplation of allocating DHUFAR to someone else was at all justified when it was doing everything in its power to overcome exceptional difficulties, i’o these observations the Uultan expressed satisfaction and explained his concern at the Company’s apparent lack of interest which of late had lead him to think that no further interest was held in that /country and in that event had contemplated allocating it to another interested |party (American), , He agreed that previously he had had cause for concern about the state of security in his country and that he, perhaps more than others, was particularly mindful of his own responsibility in the matter of security I of foreigners in his lands. He was, he stated, now able to assure that a survey party il der his security measures would be safe. The area defined as DHUFAR was given to be from DARBAX ALI on the iiaiira-Dhufar frontier on the coast to about RAJS TIHRAR beyond Jebal,^. SAivsiAAN to the east and northwards to RAmLAT AL lUGSHIN and westwards to the iviAIIRA, In this area, the Uultan asserted,a Mr. Thesiger had spent considerable time in search of locust breeding grounds and had wandered considerably beyond RAMLAT AL MUGSHIN without coming to harm. The escort of Mr, Thesiger was provided from the Sultan’s men and that similar security would be provided to the Company’s Party. When the Sultan was &amp;s&gt;£ed w y the personnel of the RAF and B.G.A.C, ca ps were not permitted to leave the confines of the ca :p without being escorted by one of his men, he replied that he was being over preoautious and was anxious to a void any misunderstandings with the inhabitants in any form and that the motive was not primarily one of security. Local intelligence reve a led, however, that raiding was by no means at an end. ISarly in 1946 a large raiding party from the north raided deep into s*l&amp;lah and rounded up a number of camels which they drove away. The Sultan’s men gave chase and managed to recover a small number of their ca?nels. The interesting point about this raid yas that the raiders passed close to the aerodrome camp without attempting to violate it boundaries. The question of attachin, a mineral expert to the Company’s exploration party was then discussed. The Sultan appears to entertain strong hopes about the mineral resources of his country. He expressed the desire to obtain the services of a mineral expert to work under his personal directions. The Representative informed the Sultan that the Company would endeavour to obtain from outside the services of such an expert and attach him to the Party, to report his findings to the Sultan direct, but that he oould not be provided for an indefinite duration and that he would have to conform, more or less, to the main party’s timings. If the Sultan wanted to give special directions and widely use hie services, it would be best to /acquire2- 1,* rv S' f* acquire the services of a mineral expert independent of the oil survey party. The Multan agreed that that was what he had wanted and that he would apply to the Political Resident at MUSCAT to that effect. It will, therefore, be necessary for the Company to be advised as soon &amp;4 possible the final situation in this regard as it may not be necessary l6r the Company to provide a mineral expert if Tihe Sultan has acquired one by other ^ means. /o3. Reconnaissance of the country on a limited scale was confined to coastal area from RISUT (17°N 54°E) to mURBAT (17°N 54°46*E) along a well defined motor track:, and to the Salalan plain as far as the foothills. Both RISUT and LIURBAI offer sheltered anchorage, but whereas RiSUT (ancient frankinsenoe port) now oan provide no labour, MURBAT is capable of unloading heavy material such as trucks. The country seems to offer no special physical difficulties, A good camel traok with plentiful water leads from RISUT to DARBAT ALI on the western frontier along the coast and the crossing of the QARA mountains which encircle bhe-Salalah plain, offers no special difficulty to the approaches of the plain eyond. In conclusion, the primary consideration here is again one of security. The Sultan,who is not by any means impoverished, is taking active giceps to show his strength and assume direct rule. His assurances of security cannot be said to be given without a real sense of responsibility but the possibility of being involved in an outside raid oan, nevertheless, not be excluded. Even in suoh an eventuality, personal risk is not necessarily great. It was not possible to obtain an opinion from the Political Resident as he was not in DHUFAR and it is unlikely that he would have been in a position to express a very definite opinion on the matter. Security here must be assumed to be an inconstant factor and it would be advisable to reconsult the Sultan nearer the time of the expedition to obtain his confirmation that the present calm in the country was still being maintained. tubjeot to such a confirmation, a party may proceed *y air to SALALAU by way i&gt;f RIYAN (MUKALLA) and details of the plan, where agreement has been reached with the Sultan, are given as hereunder. 1. The Party to arrive in SALALAH as the first port of call and report to the Sultan personally. This it is hoped may be possible during the season 1947/1U4S. 2. Security will be provided by the Sultan from selected men from the household bodyguard for the near and coastal regions, and from selected tribesmen with a proportion of household bodyguards, for the remoter regions. In the foriaer case the ^uard will be limited to fifteen and in the latter case to thirty strong. 3. Transportation of stores and personnel to SAJLALArF should / be by B.C.A.C. air service. tutor transport for ground exploration where feasible will be provided by the Sultan from hie fleet of trucks and cars. This will mainly be limited to tile track RISUT - MURBAT along the coast - a distance of approximately 60 miles. Kor all other areas the provisions of camels is undertaken by the Sultan. 4. Supplies of food are scarce and will have to bo imported from outside. The escort will receive a daily ration of one pound weight of rice/floar in any convenient proportion. The ration issue will not include dates which they will provide for themselves. 5. Financing of the Party will lie undertaken by the Sultan who will pay from his coffers for escorts and camels at the agreed rate of 4 ;iarie Theresa dollars per man/camel per day. The rate of the H.T. dollar is here fixed at 2 rupees - equivalent to three shillings. The Party may also draw on the Sultan for any other money they may require; the method of final settlement for all expenditure incurred being by ban*c draft or transfer to the Sultan f s account with Barclays Bamc, Cairo.

The Political Resident reported on 30th September that the Sultan asiced Tor the services of a geologist to carry out a survey of Dhofar to ascertain what minerals are present other than oil. Colonel Hay himself suggested that P.C.L., who are proposing to carry out an oil survey in the area might attach a general mine rut surveyor to their party, but the Sultan said that he would prefer to employ a separate geologist and to bear the expenses (P.R. f s telegram Ko. 132*6 flagged).

I advised Mr. Ler mitte to approach the shaikh of Ras al Khaimah and require him to facilitate the party's work as Jazirat al Hamrah is within Ras al Khaimah territory. He did so and the party was eventually allowed to operate in that area. 4. in the evening of the 26th October, Mr. Lermitte again approached me saying that the seven guards provided by the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah to accompany the party have demanded fantastic wages i.e. Rs.15/- per man per day instead of the usual rate of Rs.2/- per day. He asked for my help in getting over this difficulty, i immediately went with him to see the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah in his house at Dubai and talked over the subject with him and made him agree to the usual rate of Rs.2/- per man per day. The Shaikh promised to be present himself at the place where the party will be working in order to see that the guards do not make any trouble and, if necessary, to change those who may be discontented. The Party has accordingly left Sharjah this morning to work in Ras al Khaimah territory.

The tentage, petrol, kerosene and kaktz lubricating oils which have already been stored at Ras al Khaimah will now be brought to Dhaid by hired transport. One loadbf general camp equipment left Sharjah this afternoon for Dhaid. ' 2. Work to date has almost completely been confined to the triangle formed by the sea on the west, the wadi al Batha on the North and the Ajman-Dhaid road on the south. This triangle has been completed in detail with the exception of the eastern area approximately ten miles distant from Falaj al Ali. 3. When in camp at Dhaid it is proposed to work northwards and complete the whole of Ras al Khaimah territory beginning from the north and working southwards through the Jirri and the sand country to the west, it is expected that this will take approximately three weeks. 4. The next area to be undertaken is that which lies to the south and west of Dhaid and includes the Banni Chittab country including the Jabal Faiyah area and part of the sand country of Dubai. It is hoped to get as far south as the Ramlat ’Anaig. The approximate duration of this work is esti mated to take about five weeks. 5. On completion of the above the next camp will be made south of Jabal Ali, at a place to be determined later. From there work will be undertaken in both Abu Dhabi and Dubai terri tories. 6. Work at the moment is being undertaken almost wholly in Umm al Qaiwain territory and the seven field cars have each a guide supplied by the Shaikh of Umm al Qaiwain. 7. When working from Dhaid in Ras al Khaimah country guards from Ras al Khaimah will be employed. The camp guards will be arranged by the Shaikh of Sharjah who will presumably supply Banni Chittab men. 8. Mr. Fallon, surveyor, moved into camp at Dhaid on the 21st October accompanied by five guards supplied by the Shaikh of Sharjah. He also has Mahdad bin Ali binAbdulla of the Banni Chittab. ) The British members of the party are: Mr. F. Brookes ' R.N.R. Fallon, surveyor. M C. Morris, transport officer.

The Shaikh of Sharjah informed you in my presence that he would send his son Saqr at daybreak tomorrow to settle the matter. I have arranged for a car to be at the Shaikh’s house at 6 a.m. tomorrow.

Owing to the difficult terrain encountered by the Geophysical party they have found it necessary to alter their plan of operations. They now propose to camp between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, working along the coastal strip into Abu Dhabi territory, as far as their present transport will permit. A copy of their provisional programme is enclosed. The Residency Agent has asked the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to assist the Party in their operations, and I enclose a copy of his letter to the shaikh. 3.

The next day the same man halted a second vehicle at Arqab as Shafriyah in Has al Khaimah territory.

'Compaq confirm that they are definitely interested in Dhofar province and that to peneWate further to north and west (i.e. up to sands north* rds to westwards right into l^ahra country) beyond what they did in 1930* when results were negative, has be.n for sosae time one of their objectives. Sultan was however discouraging to their representatives in April. They also feel doubts about physical security in these remoter areas, and apart from 'all clear ,, from Sultan would require fairly definite opinion from Resident that parties wo ld be safe. If these assurances were forthcoming they would cvJc© great efforts to send in party based on Dhofar (though it would liardly be possible to do so this winter) and in that case it mi ht be possible for them to attach mineral expert to :&gt;arty to make s ocial report on mineral reso’irces for Sultan. It/ Brig. S.H.

Will you please refer to your letter of 17th October, about the possibility of exploration in Oman during the coning cold weather? 2. We have now received a further telegram from the acting Political Resident on this subject. It confirms that the Sultan is willing to make the necessary arrangements for ground parties to visit Baraimi, Yankal, Wadi Howasinah and the Wadi Beni Omar area, on receipt of a request from you to do so. 3. With regard to the exploration of the Ibri - Dhank area, the position is neither so definite nor so satisfactory. You will remember that Colonel Hay mentioned at the meeting on October 15th that the Sultan had promised a further^reply on the question of your company being allowed to negotiate direct with the local tribes in this area for ground exploration. The Political Agent now reports that he has been unable to obtain the Sultan's confirmation of his agreement to this. As you know, the area is under the control of the Imam and the Sultan is extremely concerned at the probable effect in Oman of his giving formal assent to your negotiating direct with the tribes in this area. The Sultan has however informed the Political Agent private y if your C.ompany wish to penetrate that area, at their own initiative and risk, this might be done without reference to him so that he can be free to deal with any unfortunate impression which may gain ground among the tribes. L In these circumstances the most that we can say io that we should see no objection to your field geological party exploring the Ibri - Dhank area without the Sultan s concurrence on the understanding that this will form . /precedent •igadier S.H. Longngg, Ling House, Dominion Street, E.C.2.I M- i y -- K\ 2 . precedent for future operations, and that they do not go beyond the area stipulated. How much you actually do undertake will no doubt best bo decided by your people in direct consultation with the local political authorities. The Sultan will of course watch developments closely and on your Company 1 s - ability to avoid compromising his position will depend his willingness to agree to further exploration of the interior. We hope that you will take the great possible advantage of the somewhat limited opportunity offered you, but vie recognise that we cannot press you too far. 5. As regards Dhofar we note your remarks ancd ; are passihig ' u a copy of your letter on to the political authorities in the Gulf, It would no doubt bo best if your representative discussed the matter with the Sultan and the Assistant Political Agent at Salala in December.

Hay referred to the intimation in para. 2 of the Political 3 0 Resident’s telegram No.1070/to the effect that P.C.L. had decided to U carry out no geological exploration in Muscat territory during the cold weather of 1946-47. He explained that he had been previously discussing with the Sultan the possibility of P.C.L. carrying out ground exploration in territory in the interior in which they are interested, and for which he had given P.C.L. to understand in April that permission would not be forthcoming. Col. Hay said that the Sultan had recently indicated - to him that he would have no objection to P.C.L. negotiating direct with the tribes at Ibri provided ground exploration only was intended and his position under the Agreement was safeguarded, and that he had already agreed to the Wadi Howasinah being visited. He had, however, promised Col. Hay a further reply after thinking matters over. The P.C.L. representatives said that exploration in the J^hank-Ibri - Wadi Howasinah area would probably fit in well with their work in the Trucial Coast-^Baraimi areaj this winter, and they might well wish to take advantage of any opportunity offered if the Sultan's ban were lifted It was agreed that the situation would be watched by P.C.L. but that nothing could be done until the further reply promised by the Sultan was received. Dhofar/Dhofar Col. Hay explained that the Sultan had recently asked him that if P.C.L. did not intend to undertake serious operations in Dhofar they should inform him accordingly and permit him to enter into negotiations with some other company. At a separate interview the Sultan had asked for the services of a geologist to carry out a survey of Dhofar to ascertain what minerals are present other than oil. Brig. Longrigg said that P.C.L. were under the impression that the Sultan had refused them permission to explore Dhofar^ except for the coastal strip. They were sending a representative along few the Hadrajaa/it Coast from Ad£n to Salalah. where he would probably arrive about Christmas. It might be possible for them to do some geological exploration in Dhofar.if desired- attaching a mineral expert for a period to make special report on the mineral resources^ either IM {MX this winter or the next. They would, however,^like to know exactly how far to the North and West of Dhofar the Sultan would permit them to go. Their representative might perhaps discuss this with the Sultan at Salalah afr OhrteW. A 'fhey however^ discuss the matter further with Mr. Baker^the Company geologist and let the India.

It is intended to be treated, on receipt, with the same expedition as if it had been telegraphed. To save time and to obviate formalities it is drafted in the form of a telegram. It is authenticated by the signature of a No. 8 Q3-3, aaojx Bahrain, Dated the 30th September 19 46. the 30th September Bahrain, To Re tax and um London Repeated Foreign New Delhi* During my recent visit to Muscat the Sultan asked that if P.C.L. do not intend to undertake serious operations in Dhofar they should inform him accordingly and permit him to enter into negotiations with some other company. 2. The position is that P.C.L. have informed the Sultan of their desire to take up the Oil Concession in Dhofar as provided for in Art. 6 of the Dhofar Oil Agreement with effect from the 8th May 1944 and that the Sultan has acknowledged receipt of / their communication vide Residency Express Letter No. 490«S dated 25th May 1944. The Sultan’s final reply does not appear to he on record in this office and I am making enquiries about it. Provided therefore the Company make the payments stipulated in Article 6 of the Dhofar Oil Agreement, the Sultan is bound by the Agreement until the year 2012 vide Article 2. 3. I understand from local enquiries that P.C.L. do intend sooner or later to carry out a proper survey of Dhofar. As it is an area in which the Sultan is particularly interested and as he has agreed that the whole of it should be surveyed at once vide paragraph 2 of Political Agent' Muscat’s letter No. C.317- 14/1 dated the 13th April 1946 {copy sent to India Office and /Government of India under Residency Printed Letter No. 560-S | dated 6th May 1946) I think it would be politic for the Company to undertake such a survey as soon as possible. They may find the Sultan readier to facilitate their surveys elsewhere if they do so. 4. At a separate interview the Sultan asked for the services of a geologist to carry out a survey of Dhofar to ascertain what minerals are present other than oil. The Sultan made a similar request in 1943 and the Government of India agreed to send a survey party vide their Express Letter No. 5402-N/43 dated 9th August 1943 but on being informed that certain specimens sent for analysis were of no value he asked that the survey should be postponed. (Signature) / 5. S. 44 MFP—1450 S&amp;P-(M-2386)—20-3-40—15,000.mt 2 tm 5. If the P.C.L. carry out a detailed survey of Dhofar they are bound under their agreement (vide Article 22) to Inform the Sultan of the presence of any minerals other tnan oil which they happen to discover* I think however that the . Sultan requires something more than this viz* a definite search for other minerals* ' 6. I should like therefore to be in a position to inform the Sultan that the P.C.L. will, if conditions permit, carry out a detailed survey of Dhofar not later than the cold weather of 1947-48 and that they will in the course of it prepare for the Sultan a detailed report of the geological structure of the Province including mention of any valuable minerals discovered, and would request that if there is no objection the Head Office of the Company in London may be approached accordingly. 7. I would call attention to the point that the Sultan made no suggestion that the P.C.L. should carry out a general geological survey for him, and that it is possible that he might prefer to employ a geologist who has no connection with P.C.L. I think however we should suggest to him if only for the purposes of economy that if the P.C.L. do carry out a survey in the near future they should let him have a general geological report on the lines proposed, provided they are willing to do this.

A straight line from Sharjah to Jiwani passes over the territories of the Shaikh of Kalba and the Shaikh of Fujairah (who is in practice though not in theory independent) as well as those of the Shaikh of Sharjah. The point however is not of great importance in the present case. F. A. K.
