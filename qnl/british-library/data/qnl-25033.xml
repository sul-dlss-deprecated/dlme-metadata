Sir;- I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 13th instant the contents of which have received rny full attention. It is scarcely necessary for me to state that, when my Government appointed Mr. Seoane to he Consul General at Hong Kong with jurisdiction in all the British possessions in Asia, they were not aware of the invariable rule to which you are good enough to call my attention. I no$e that the jurisdiction conceded in an exe quatur granted by His Majesty in favour of foreign Consuls in his possessions in India is limited to the actual ports of residence of the said Consuls. Interpreting therefore faithfully the wishes of my Government, to whom I hastened to communicate by telegraph the representation rendered necessary by your note, I have now the honour to inform you that my Sir E. Grey, Bart., M.P*,ray Government, animated by a keen desire to avoid the possibility oT inconvenience to which the Secre tary of State for India alludes, limit the consular jurisdiction of Mr. Seoane to the British Colonies in Asia, India being thus excluded in accordance with your note. In consequence I beg you to be good enough to obtain from His Majesty the exequatur for Mr. Seoane in this form, in agreement with the last paragraph of your note to which I have the honour to reply. I presume that it will not be necessary for ray Government to issue a fresh Commission in favour of the said Consul General: but if it should be I should be very grateful if you would let ms kn'w so that I may apply to Lima for it. \ I have &amp;c., (Signed) E. Lembcke.r ^ opy 42050. FOREIGN OFFICE December ^0. , 1907 Sir:- With reference to your Note of the 20th instant, I have the honour to acquaint you that, in accordance with the wish now expressed by the Government of Peru, I shall not fail to take the necessary steps with a view to the issue of The King's Exequatur to Mr* eoane as Consul General of Peru at Hongkbng, with consular jurisdiction in the British Colonies in Asia. With respect, however, to the inquiry made in the last paragraph of your note, I beg leave to observe that His Majesty's Exequaturs issued to Foreign Con sular Officers recite the terms of the Commissions held by such officers, so far as regards the jurisdictions allotted to them. It would therefore be desirable in the present case, in order to ensure conformity bet ween the two documents, that Mr. Seoane should hold a d ; m ! 3Commission defining + he actual district within which ha exercises jurisdiction, and I accordingly return the Commission enclosed in your Note of the 11th in stant. On the receipt of Mr. Seoane*s new Commission, His Majesty's Exequatur will he issued to him forthwith I have &amp;c..

I I FOREION OFFICE, Docsmfcar 13th, 1907. m With roforence to your note of tlio 11th ultimo. respecting the appointment of 3enor Don Buenaventura. G. Seoane ac Consul-General of Peru at HongKong,with jurisci-LCti.on in all the British possessions in Asia, I have the honour to state that it would appear, from the terms of this gentleman’s Commission, that the Consular district assigned to him iru itides His Majes ty ’ s Indian possessions, in which Consuls of Peru already reslue respectively at Calcutta and Rangoon. In this cube T hog leave explain that, in ac cordance with an invariable rule, the jurisdiction accorded in Exequaturs grantee -by His Majesty to o/- eign Consular Officers in his Indian possessions is limited to the actual ports at, which such Consular Officers reside. In the present mstance,His ■■■laj^-s- ty’s Secretary of State for India, to whom I referredthe matter, observes that it appears to him that in convenience will arise if the Consular business bet ween the Peruvian Government and the Government of India is transacted by an official residing at Hong- Kong; but that, provided arrangements are made to avoid inconvenience of this nature, the Government of India are not concerned with relations which the t’eruvian Government for their own purposes may estab lish between the Consul-General at HongKong and their Consuls at Calcutta and Pnngoou. In the circumstances, Pis ¥ajesty f s Exequatur to Benor Beoane can only be issued so far as regards the British Colonies in Asia, and or learning from you that the Peruvian Government concur in this course, I shall be pleased to take steps for its preparation forthwith.

Your Excellency:- I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that my Government, having cancelled the letters patent in favour of Don Daniel E, Pereira as Consul General at Hongkong, have appointed Don Buenaventura G. Seoane as Consul General of the Republic at that port with Jurisdiction in all the British possessions in Asia. Senor Seoane is a Peruvian subject and will carry on his duties as a paid Consul. I have the honour to transmit herewith, the Letters Pat vent and to request that Your Excel lency will be so good as to obtain from His Britannic Majesty the usual Exequatur in order that the said Senor Seoane may enter upon hie duties. (signed)V Political, No. 82. India Office, London, 1st September 1905. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, I have Commissions issued by Foreign Governments to their Consular Representatives in India. duly received and considered in Council Your Ex cellency’s Letter No. 130 (Foreign, General), of the 13th July last, relative to the Commissions issued by Foreign Governments to their Consular representatives in India. You recommend that, in all cases in which these Commissions define the Consular jurisdiction as extending beyond the particular ports to which the Consular officers are appointed, it should be suggested to the Embassy concerned that the Commission should be limited to that particular port. 2. As regards the correspondence with the Foreign Office mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter, it should be observed that Mr. Campbell’s letter of 12th April 1905, to which you specially refer, made no proposal for suggesting to the Austro-Hungarian Government that the Commissions which they issued to their Consuls should be revised, but stated that it was proposed, in issuing the King’s Exequatur to Herr Wein, as Consul at Bombay, “ to omit all reference to his district in that instrument,” and to inform the Charge d’Affaires that “ it is the “ invariable rule not to grant the Foreign Consuls in India any “ jurisdiction outside the actual port of residence.” It is true that a suggestion for limiting the Commissions issued by the German Govern ment to their Consuls in India was made in Lord Lansdowne’s letter to Count Metternich of the 4th February 1901, but the object of that letter was to explain that no change in the position of the Consul at Bombay was created by the fact that it had been found necessary to issue the Exequatur to Mr. Hopman as Consul at Bombay only, whereas the Exequatur issued to his predecessor had had a more extended scope. And Mr. Campbell’s letter of the 4th February 1904, forwarding for my information Lord Lansdowne's letter to Count Metternich, stated “ that “ it is, of course, not within the power of the Secretary of State to “ correct Commissions issued by Heads of Foreign States, but that this “ Department has been, and will continue to be, careful in all cases, “ pursuant to the arrangement come to with the India Office, to consult “ your Department as to the exact wording to be used in issuing the “ King’s Exequatur.” 16*314. I. 1562.3. In these circumstances, it is, in my opinion, unnecessary and undesirable to modify the procedure recognised in the letters from the Foreign Office of the 4th February 1904 and 12th February 1905, quoted above, and in the letter to the Foreign Office of the 10th May 1905, which embodies the further principle that Consuls in India can have no dealings with Native States otherwise than through the British authorities. 4. The procedure in question makes it sufficiently clear that His Majesty’s Government can only recognise the exercise of consular functions at the place named in the Exequatur, which entails, as a consequence, that the Consul must, in ordinary circumstances, reside and transact business there. As regards the many foreign subjects scattered throughout India outside the limits of the ports to which Consuls are appointed, I see no objection, subject to the reservation mentioned above concerning Native States, to Foreign Governments, in the commissions which they issue to their Consuls, dividing British India into such spheres for the purposes of Consular intervention on behalf of their subjects as they may consider convenient. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) St. John Broheicx.
