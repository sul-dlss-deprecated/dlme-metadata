EL KATR, 1908-16. — , }■ r J r ! le '? r Q atar ) Peninsula, which is governed by the Sheikhs oi the I ham family, lies south of Ojair, in the district of Qatif, the most southernly point to .which, with the exception of Koweit, His Maiestv’s Government prior to the \\ ar of 1914 recognised continuous Turkish influence. It lies, on the other hand, north of El Odeid, to which the iracial bhmkh of Abu Dhabi was allowed to assert his rights of possession in lo 18 , and which prior to 191tj formed the western boundary of the territories of the Trucial Sheikhs. The status of the Peninsula formed the SU n J ? Ct , oi length y discussion in the period prior to 1908, details of which will be found in the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908. T he vexed question of the status of El Katr was finally disposed of in m e A n g 1 °' rurkl8 . h ne ®° t ‘ d , tio J 18 , of 1912 -14- Under the unratified Anglo- lurkish Convention of 29th July 1913, the Ottoman Government renounced all rights to the lenmsula, which was, as in the past, to continue to be governed by the Sheikhs of the Fhani family, while His Majesty’s Government e ttgaged not to permit the Sheikh of Bahrein to interfere in the internal attains ot El Katr, to threaten its autonomy or to annex it. A supplementary article reserved the rights of the inhabitants of Bahrein to visit the island of Zaknnuinyah for fishing purposes, as in the past. 3 : A f n i e mo SitU ?u io .' ar08 ?, wit ! 1 t! \ e con 9 uest of Hasa by Ibn Sand in the course of l.)1.3. El katr, like the Oman coast, formed, in his view, part of his ancestral domains, to which he could therefore prefer a claim as of ricffit * * p.a.

Lengthy negotiation proved necessary before a satisfactory pYssM!’ 5 ' agreement could be reached and it was not until 3 rd November 191611 that a treaty was finally concluded between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government. 1 he treaty, the terms of which are summarised in the precis of treaties appended to the present Memorandum, secured to the Sheikh the advantages conferred under the Trucial treaties on the Sheikhs of ’'rucial Oman, while imposing on him the obligations in regard to piracy, the slave traffic, the arms traffic, the grant of concessions, the cession, sale gift lease 3091b 50 10.28 ’ ® ’ e9 * G. of I. Desp. 2; April 1'J 1918, P. 2419/18. nr transfer of territory to other Powers, and the maintenance of relations with foreign Powers already accepted by those Chiefs. In order to secure the signature of the Sheikh, it was agreed that the articles of the treaty (7 8 and 9 ) which related to the admission of British subjects to Kali tor trading purposes and their protection while so engaged, the admission of an Agent on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, and the establishment of post and telegraph offices in Katr, should remain inoperative for the present, ■\vhile a minor concession was made in respect of the retention by the feheikh and his dependents of negro slaves actually in their possession, on the understanding that they would receive “fair and just treatment.” 7 . The one respect of importance in which the treaty went beyond the normal type of Trucial treaty was that it contained an undertaking that the good offices of His Majesty’s Government should be granted to the Sheikh in the event of unprovoked aggression against him by land within the territories of Katr (Article XI). The assurance in question did not, however, in practice impose any very serious liability on His Majesty’s Government, as was shown when a tentative appeal was made to it by the Sheikh in 1922 (see para. 9 of Memorandum on the Trucial Sheikhs, 1908-28, on page 8 . The treaty was ratified by the Governor-General of India in Council on 28th March 1918. * The history of Katr from the date of its conclusion is dealt with in the Memorandum on the Trucial Chiefs on page but it may be recorded here that the position of its ruler was recognised on the conclusion of the European War by the grant to him of the C.I.E. (3rd June 1919) and of a salute of seven guns—honours of which he is the only recipient among the chiefs of the Trucial Coast. India Office, 5th September 1928. J. G.
