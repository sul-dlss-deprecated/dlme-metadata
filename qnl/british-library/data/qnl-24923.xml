Prom - The Hon’ble Lieut.-Colonel W.R.Hay, C.I.3., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To - The Secretary to the Government of India, iSxtemal Affairs Department, New Delhi. Sir, I have the honour to state that the Shaikh of Kuwait asked for an interview with me on the 17th July during my recent visit to hie Principality. 2. He began by emphasising his loyalty to the British Govern ment and regretted that he was not able to contribute more direct ly to the war effort by putting forces or equipment at their disposal. &gt;tpart from this he was doing and would do everything possible to assist the Allies on their road to victory. About 90^ of his subjects had Nazi sympathies, but dared not incur his wrath by showing them. 3. There is no doubt about the Shaikh’s whole-hearted loyalty. He has granted without demur all facilities for which he has been asked and has co-operated fully with the Political Agent in all economic and other measures rendered necessary by the war. In addition he has recently contributed Rs.10,000 to the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund. He has banned the listening in to Nazi broadcasts in public places, and owing to hie influence t I there is almost an entire absence of pro-Axis propaganda. Al though the percentage of Nazi partisans may not be ^.uite so large as he alleges there is no doubt that there are many amongst the population who are anti-British - in most cases probably merely from a desire for change or some vague hope of improving their lot. I took the opportunity to thank the Shaikh for all )ais 9 assistance and co-operation.I I ft Q ' ^.y After axi-reaeing hie loyalty the Shailch went on to make two requeete. In the firet plaoe he aeked that everything poeeible ehould be done to eneure a regular flow of euppliee to Kuwait. He wae particularly anxioue leet Ibn Saud ehould make inordinate demands upon him. as owing to hie epecial relations with that monarch he could not refuee anything for which he wae asked. I have already addressed Hie Majesty'e Minister, Jedda, on this subject vide my telegra m -o.820, dated the 14th May 1^42. The g^Ikh stated that Ibn Saud had so far not made any inordinate demand on him but that exports to Saudi Arabia by land were continuing as before, though he had placed restrictions on exports by sea, as such exports could not be properly checked and merchants were in the habit of exporting less than the quantities covered by their permits and hoarding the balance against a future rise v/ in prices. I understand that exports from Kuwait to Saudi Arabia are at present being paid for by Dinar drafts on Iraqi banks issued by the Ottoman Bank at Jedda. I told the shaikh that every effort was being made to ensure that Kuwait was adequately supplied and thut there was no reason to believe that Ibn Saud would make | unreasonable demands upon him especially as arrangemei ts were m hand for the provision of supplies to Saudi Arabia which it was hoped would make it quite unnecessary for him to do to. 5. The shaikh's other request related to the supply ot motor-f vehicles for security purposes about which I am addressing the \|\ Government of India separately* 6. I found the shaikh in good spirits and apparently in good health, though he was paler than when I saw him in February last and appeared to have lost a little of his sparkle and vivacity. 7 . I am eending a copy of this letter to the secretary of State for India, the Minister of State, Cairo, Hie Majesty's Ambassador, Bagdad, His Majesty’s Minister, *edda, the lolltioal Agent, Kuwait, and the Combined InteUigence Centre, Iraq.

On the strength of the views expressed in paragraphs 4-5 of Brenan's letter to Gibson Ko. E 3048/465/25 of June 15th, 1938, we told the Government of India in paragraph 6 of our letter 'o. 17, 4206/38 of July 23rd, 1938, that before the Agreements were concluded it would be necessary, if the Government of Indiaxo t\t &lt;*&lt;!!» 0^ • OH JosJaiTi tl&amp;wuX idbau £&gt;9vl^09K) • ($£91 Saul dtk axl j* ,2*61 sajiX I&gt;t5 lip b9teb t 8eri\d\H.oft i&amp;ttsl Jo x?o0 ia^A Ifiomio* *At of ftswuX Jo -islufl ortf aasmi&amp;iH siH ▲ jl jm* f rtf i a I ban no i IliJ \m Jo of rii sbi .

Both the Government of India and Political Resident agreed to this procedure and, when the negoti tions were virtually concluded,the latter referred to the necessity for carrying it out (see paragraph 1 of this telegram Po. T/l50 dated March 2nd 1940, which is mentioned in the telegram enclosed). In fact, however, all that has been obtained from the Sheikh a is tUMj^ ^reetnr^X in g ner-1 terms to a letter from the Political Agent which, inter alia — j asked him to confirm 'pending a formal communication on the subject, that you agree with the terms agreed upon, and will carry out their provisions” (see the correspondence uUovu with the Residency ypress Letter mentioned/mentioned in the enclosed telegram, in line six of which '1942' is a mistake for '1940'; copy of this correspondence was sent to the F.C. under our ITo.

In these circumstances the question arises whether the Political Besi'^nt should he asked to ensure if possible that the Sheikh should include in the suggested acknowledgement some more definite statement than the enclosed telegrem contemplates.

Following are our comments on suggested modifications 1. Trade Agreement. (a) No objection provided Sheikh of Kov. r eit agrees. (b) Suggested amendment appears otiose, especially words 'not specified in this article,' but if Saudi-Arabian woras 'not snecniea in tnis article,” out ii oauui-Arauian Government attach importance to it we do not object provided the word 'lav/ful' is inserted before 'purpose'. 2 .

Extradition Agreement. Our re-draft of exchange of letters was drawn up on the assumption that it was intended to provide that Bedouin coulo. be extradited for crimes of violence in the same way as anybody else. It appears, however, to be Saudi intention to say that Bedouin only commit crimes of violence and therefore all Bedouin who commit crimes can be extradited. If this is the meaning of the letters they seriously under mine value of Article 3, where crimes for which extradition can be granted are enumerated. If it is true that Bedouin only commit crimes of violence letters appear to be unnecessary. Similar letters were attached to Saudi-Iraqi Agreement of 1931, but that was an agreement between two Arab countries with which we had no concern. It will not be possible to put draft exchange of notes in their original form in agreement to which His Majesty 1 s Government is a party* We hone therefore that Saudi-Arabian Government will agree to omit them altogether, 4« Language. As His Majesty's Government are a party to these agreements we must insist on an official English text. The Bahra Agreement does not seem to be a parallel case, since His Majesty's Government were not a party to it.

(E 3034/227/25) R U s /} o j * i - t. 1940 j Saudi-Koweit Agreements. Trade Agreement. (a) Provided the Sheikh of Koweit agrees, we see no ohjection to extending the term of the agreement from three to five years. (h) Tt is difficult to understand the need for the suggested amendment, and the words M not specified in this 'Article' seem to he entirely unnecessary. But if the Saudi Arabian Government wish to put in these words, there seems no reason why we should object. We feel, however, that it would be well to insert the word 'lawful' before the word 'purposes'. Bon Voisinage Agreement . The two amendments suggested under (a) and (b) seem unobjectionable. (c) The best way of meeting the Saudi Arabian point of view seems to be to omit the words 'and Koweit' in the first paragraoh of the draft exchange of letters and also the heading 'Tribes of Koweit', and finally the words 'or Saudi Arabia 'respectively' in the last paragraph. Extradition Agreement . The Foreign Office re-draft of the exchange of letters to be attached to the Extradition Agreement was so worded as to provide that Bedouin could be extradited for crimes of violence just as much as anybody else. It appears, however, to be Ibn Saud^ object to say that the only crimes committed by Bedouin are crimes of violence and that therefore every Badu who commits a crime can be extradited. It seems that if this is the meaning of the letters, they seriously undermine the value of Article 5, where the crimes for which extradition can be granted are enumerated. It is true that a similar exchange of letters was attached to the Saudi-Iraqi Extradition Agreement of 1931, but that was an agreement between two Arab countries with which we had no concern. It would hardly be possible to put the draft exchange of notes in the agreement in their original form. It seemB necessary to explain to Mr. Bird that these letters appear to us to be redundant and to ask him for a fuller explanation of the reasons why the Saudi Arabian Government attach importance to the drafts. Language. arc As these/agreements to which His Majesty’s Government are a party, we must insist on official English text. The Bahra Agreement does not appear to be a parallel case. It was negotiated by Sir Gilbert Clayton, but His Majesty’s Government were not a party to it.iz&lt;y] Your despatch No*91. I have had long discussions with Yusuf Yasin, ceaselessly reedifyinig- the drafts of Kov/elt agreements. ( ±o Trade agreement. (a) King wishes agreement to be for free years, told Yusuf Yasin that I must refer this point. (b) Exchange of letters between Hafiz Wahba and p*'sw/«*o Political ..gent at Koweit provided for insertion after words '’for Musabala” in article_No.9, of words ,: or for any other purpose not specified in/thJs article 11 . I have agreed subject fU*. lA*XXtr&amp;K*AA to tfWV* to your observations to insert them* ^ to *Iu ' ' , 2. Bon Voisina^p agreement 0 (a) Yusuf Yasin considers that reference to the schedule could more suitably be made in article No.3. (2) bv inserting words ,{ And schedule annexed thereto” after word ”agreement”. He discussed, I think justifiably, that insertion of words in article 3 (1) modifies the sense of the article. I have [?agreed] subject to your approval. (b) Article 6 (2). Arab version of second sentence agreed upon, Yusuf Yasin stated, between Hafiz Wahba and Major Galloway read: ”If t ^ey are not nationals of country which they have entered ” I could not agree to this but suggested that insertion of v/ords ”or of a third ^.rab state” after word 'counti^ thus bringing article into line with Article [?1] of present agreement. After prolonged argument Yusuf Yasin agreed. Do you agree? (c) Notes regarding tribal allegiance. Yusuf Yasin pressed strongly for wording agreed upon between Hafiz Wahba and Political Agent Ibn baud would n ver accept * wording of redraft. Intention,was not, as Treaty Department thought (please see Department's note accompanying despatch under reference), to decide which tribes or sections are dependent upon baudi Arabia or Koweit respectively. There are no Koweiti tribes. All tribes are Nejdi but elements of these tribes known collectively as ,.raibdar are settled in Koweit and Ibn Baud is prepared to recognise their allegiance to the Sheikh of Koweit a The Sheikh and the Political Agent for him recognise the position and agreement was reached on that basis.I appreciated the King's point of view but said that I must refer'question. Meanwhile Yusuf Yasin agre-'.s to insertion of word Araibdar under heading tribes or Kov/eit in accordance with Political agent's suggestion to me. I trust that in view of.Ibn Baud s strong feeling, original draft may be accepted. 3. Extradition agreement. Yusuf Yasin accepted stamping and sealing of * documents but held out very strongly for retention of original draft of the second of toe exchange of letters agreed upon by Hafiz wahba ahd Major Galloway. Discussions 0 f this point are continuing and I will telegraph result. 4. Language. I told Yusuf Yasin that you insisted on an English text for publication as a white Paper. He countered by citing Bahra agreement where translation was published as a .,hite Paper. Ibn Baud hoped that His Majesty's Government would agree to Arab text alone being signed or that at the worst there should be two texts, the Arab prevailing in case of dispute. He made the point made in paragraph 17 of Sir Gilbert Clayton s report of November 25th, 1925 (Middle East No.7 February 7th, 1926) that agreement will be implemented by two Arab-speaking states. I promised to lay his views before you in the hope that one or other of his suggestions would be acceptable. I think that the question of amour propre as well as that of expediency is involved in Ibn Baud's desire for assent to Arab text.

His Majesty's Government might have to advise the Sheikh to assent to Ibn Saud's proposal if, on further consideration the necessity of the proposal were clearly established and Sheikh's objections thereto should appear unreasonable and vexatious. 4.

Bsggallay and understand that so far as can be judged the intention of the negotiators is to separate the question of the tribes from the Schedule to the Bon Voisinage Agreement, and that the general purpose of the notes is to decide which tribes or sections of tribes are dependent upon Saudi Arabia and upon Koweit respectively. The first thing that strikes one about the notes therefore is that there is no list of Koweit tribes. Secondly the notes speak of determining the n«tlonallty of elements (i.e. presumably tribal groups or sections) when really something like 'tribal dependence* ia-meant, our conception of nationality bein?’ something which affects the individual. A third point is that it is not clear whether the arrangements to settle this question are to be made direct between daudi Arabia and Koweit or through His Majesty’s Government. X have made tentative amendments in both notes to meet the first two points, and as regards the third X have inserted lirovisionally- the Saudi «nd-Koweiti Governments. One further point occurs to one in connexion with the Bon Voisinage Agreement and Schedule. There is not so far as I can see anythin# in the Agreement to link it with the Schedule, although it seem® perfectly clear that the latter is intended to serve as a guide to the Frontier Officers in carrying out their duties under the Agreement. I find some difficulty in selecting a suitable place for inserting the necessary lin*c, but it would suffice for the purpose if, in Article S ( 1 ) of the Agreement, after the words ’’application of the provisions ’♦of this Agreement'the words ’in accordance with the annexed 'Schedule' were inserted.

DEPr| 1 / A AY 940 INDIA OFFICEMDfc* E0 v (E 1801/227/25) iREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1 29th April, 1940 IMMEDIATE, CONFIDENTIAL Dear Gibson, I enclose a copy of a telegram from Jedda regarding the desire of Ibn Saud to establish a customs post at Wafra in the middle of the Saudi-Kov/eit Neutral 2. The Agreement of the 2nd December 1922 here called the Uqair Protocol says that in the neutral zone »»the Governments of Nejd and Koweit will share equal ’’rights”, I do not know enough about the history of the zone to say whether any attempt has ever been made to provide for its joint control by the two parties, or whether any control at all is exercised by anybody within its borders at the present time. But assuming that the wording of the Agreement of the 22nd December is our sole guide, it seems to us that Zone, ^4/ ERl J.P. Gibson, Esq, ENCLOSURE IN AIR MAIL LETTER No. 17 _3 MAY 1940 RECo. POL. i POL. i ? P-. FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL DEPT. INDIA OFFICE OQPY SENT BY AIR MAlL INDIA OFFICE ,| of ejc .(a) While this wording does not preclude the establishment of a customs post by one party with the consent of the other, it may be regarded as precluding its establishment without the consent of the other, but (b) it cannot have been intended that there should be no authority exercised within the zone at all, if the practical need for the exercise of such authority were ever felt, 3. We feel therefore that an obligation must be assumed to rest on each of the parties to accept any reasonable suggestions made by the other for the joint control of the zone, or, failing that, not unreasonably or vexatiously to withhold consent to any reasonable measures of control instituted by the other, on the understanding that he himself is free to take parallel and simultaneous measures. 4. The question whether Ibn Saud* s desire to have a customs post at Wafra is in fact 'reasonable' is not one on which we would wish to dogmatise without fuller information/information as to the local topography. But we observe that one of the specified routes laid down in (or at least to be deduced from) Articles 1 and 7 of the Trade Agreement recently initialled at Koweit, i.e. that between Subaihiyah in southern Koweit and Al Qarya in north eastern Hasa, must almost certainly pass through the neutral zone. It is possible that Wafra is the only group of wells, either inside or outside the zone, from which this route and other routes leading from the zone into Saudi Arabia can be watched. 5. It is rather surprising that in the circumstances it should not have occurred to anyone, either here or in Saudi Arabia or Koweit, to deal with the neutral zone in the Trade Agreement. Article 1 (l) of the Agreement says that 'all goods which leave Koweit territory for Saudi Arabia' must be accompanied by a manifest, be carried in a caravan, etc. But many of these goods probably leave Koweit territory for the neutral zone in the first place, even though their ultimate destination may be Saudi Arabia. Article 1 (2) is vaguer in its language,/language, but what was presumably intended by the drafters was that the persons 'leaving again' who have to travel in parties etc# are persons leaving again for Sauai Arabia# 6# We thus come up against a rather difficult problem# The establishment in the zone either of a joint customs post or else of separate Saudi and Koweit customs posts may be an eminently reasonable practical measure# But the results might be, from a legal point of view, that persons in the zone, whether residents or visitors, who would not, while still in the zone, have committed any offence against the law of Koweit tjy leaving Koweit without manifests etc#, (or at least would not have done so so far as the Agreement is concerned — see, for instance, Article 4, which says nothing about the neutral zone) might find themselves apprehended for intending to commit an offence against the Saudi State which would not and could not be actually comraitted until they reached the Saudi border and took goods into Saudi Arabian territory without having fulfilled the formalities of the Trade Agreement# W7. It is possible that Ibn Saud has tumbled to the fact that any amount of goods might leave Koweit for ostensible destinations in the presumably thinly- populated neutral zone without any of the safeguards contained in the Trade Agreement being applicable, and might from there be smuggled into Saudi Arabia* There seems at first glance to be much to be said for his point of view and some sort of agreement on the subject seems eminently desirable* The only pity is Ibn Saud did not raise this question long before, instead of springing it on us like this at the last moment* 8 * Incidentally, Article 8 of the Extradition Agreement is of interest in this connexion* It clearly contemplates that Saudi or Koweit officials may enter the zone and apprehend absconders from Saudi Arabia or Koweit* It also contemplates that fugitives from the zone may be dealt with in Saudi Arabia or Koweit* On the other hand it says nothing about dealing with persons who have committed offences in the zone while still within its borders* This point would not, however, be strictly/2456 k 1940 I strictly relevant to an extradition agreement between the two parties having rights in the zone* 9.

Much of the correspondence concerns the exact wording of these agreements and numerous amendments that were made to them. The correspondence also briefly discusses the desire of the Ruler of Saudi Arabia, Ibn Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] to establish a customs post in Wafra.The majority of the correspondence in the file is between British officials (including at the Foreign Office, India Office, the British Legation in Jeddah and the Political Agency in Kuwait), but it also contains a limited amount of correspondence the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, on whose behalf the British acted during the negotiations with Saudi Arabia that led to the agreements being signed.In addition to correspondence, the file contains several copies of the proposed agreements between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait as follows:'Trade Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom (acting on behalf of His Highness the Sheikh of Koweit) and the Government of Saudi Arabia Jedda, 20th April, 1942 [Ratifications exchanged at Jedda, 1st May, 1943]' in English and Arabic (folios 3-6)'Agreement for the Extradition of Offenders between the Government of the United Kingdom (acting on behalf ofHis Highness the Sheikh of Koweit) and the Government of Saudi Arabia [With Exchange of Notes relating to Smuggling Offences] Jedda, 20th April, 1942 [Ratifications exchanged at Jedda, 1st May, 1943]' in English and Arabic (folios 7-11)'Agreement for the Extradition of Offenders between the Government of the United Kingdom (acting on behalf ofHis Highness the Sheikh of Koweit) and the Government of Saudi Arabia [With Exchange of Notes relating to Smuggling Offences] Jedda, 20th April, 1942' (folios 16-17)'Trade Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom (acting on behalf of His Highness the Sheikh of Koweit) and the Government of Saudi Arabia Jedda, 20th April, 1942' (folios 18-19)'Agreement for Friendship and Neighbourly Relations between the Government of the United Kingdom (acting on behalf of His Highness the Sheikh of Koweit) and the Government of Saudi Arabia [With Schedule and Exchange of Notes containing Lists of Tribes], Jedda, April 20, 1942' (folios 20-21).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
