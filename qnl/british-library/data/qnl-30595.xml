Hie Higiiiieoa expreseed the view Uie /aair t the^the Governraent of India were not re&amp;dv to support the auttmrity of the state arid was convinced that he could defy tiae rultan with iapunity. The humb;u\lm'nt by !!. • G• w Cyclamen M last pear had very little effect. the aliip had simply knocked down a email fort belonging to the Muscat »tateafter it had been evacuated by the Beni Hu Tli, and had then sailed away, and after its departure the Beni Bu ill had reouraed their occupation of the cus^tons house and re ho is ted the flag.

I then ashed him whether the result would not be die susae as before, namely, that after the departure of the ship the Bani Bu Ui would again impose their customs control at Bur occupying if necessary none other building for the purpose* Bis Highness agreed that this would probably be so and said that in hi» opinion it would be necessary for troops to occupy Gur for a certain period.

I am inclined rather to think that in view oi the fact that a new Political PeriC-ent nan cot* to the Gulf and one «he has never forserly held th* pos-t of Political Agent at Huncat or take* any port in Kuo eat affaire, and who may poaoibiy hold the P«»* a 80Bewliat longer period than oorae of hie iawedlate predocooeoro. Hi!. Tlighneon i» disporsed for the tine being to adopt a w&amp;i tingwaiting attitude, and to nee whether the new Heeieitmt will be able to ho Biimething to remedy his fancied grievances, before finally and definitely abdicating. Hits desire to abdicate is, 1 believe, xargeiy due to his local representatives in the past. tiiinks that m a y ortunity offered for recovering inland Caan after the repulse by Indian troop* of Isa Bin Saleh’a attack on Muttrah in 191b and that it was the Britisi. &lt;&amp;&gt;venrmtnt who refused to allow him to take advantage of it Unm humbling him before Isa bin Saleh with ^iom and hie family he has a longstanding blood feud, and he further consider© that he ha© not been itfUKtu&amp;tely supported over Sur affairs. If the tvno Matters to whid'i he attaches importance, namely, ^e re-liabilitation of the finances of his state and the re-establi»hiaent of his authority on the coast^ can be settled to his satisfaction, I have hopes- though it is much too soon yet to express a definite opinion — that His Highnesa may take a renewed interest in the affairs of hie state and that it may be possible to ward off for some years at any rate the long-threatened abdication. alleged grievances against the British Oovernmrt uric their Netherlands. urge that tue enhanged effect as soon as poro,i then be opened wi th Bn X with France and the United cates to obtair theirtheir agreement to the levy of a aiiuimr duty on any goods which may be iiaported from those countries. At present the state cannot pay its way; ana even the devy Corps tt hi ch is essential for it a defence cannot be main tained at full strength. vith the additional iUnds thus obtained this eouiu be done while mm money would be available to anable His Highness to entertain in suitable style ami to ahovr customary hospitality to ohe tribal nhaikhs in the interior, thereby increasing his influence and perhagm, in course of time, enabling him to gain some measure of authority. 9 . ao regards ur, the British (lovernment have H.lwa;/n undertaken -to r min tain die authority of the Unseat State on the coast whlie refusing to be drawn into quarrels in the interior. It seems essential in pur suance of this policy to re-establish the authority oi the sultan at. Bur. His Highness* Siiggeetion Uiat air action should be combined with a naval bombardrien i sounds, perhaps from a purely utilitarian point of view, somewhat ridiculous; I believe however that the moral effect would be considerable * X met. the ■ enior it-val v/fi icer at Hen jam on the 19 th of December and discussed the matter with him.

Copy to Political Agent luscat under Resident's Telegram' Ho.62 dated January ilthD i bummarv of the situation in interior v^rnan . The old Imam has been murdered largely as a result of the oppressive rule of his brothers, and of his attitude over the return of the property and the penal zakat . E. A new Imam has been set up by‘Sheikh Isa, the rebel leader but he has not yet obtained the support of all the tribes. He is named Abdullah al Khalili, and is reported mild and learned and had advocated the return of the gardens in the time of the last Imam. It is doubtful if he will obtain much support except tempor arily, and such support will automatically diminish with the increase of the bultan*s power. ^sa 3. The only chance of success which/ix and his puppet Imam have is in the restoration, of order and of normal conditions, and above all in the removal of the penal zakat. 4. Isa has already written to me asking for negotiations to be reopened with us as mediators. I have replied that I am willing to meet them but not until tne loose gardens me xirsi rmuineJ. 5. Conflicting news is coming through as to the position of Isa f s and the 3 ultan f s parties in the interior, but suflicient to show that Isa is not having in all his own way. 6 . We are not called on to interfere in these events, and we may let them intrigue and fight it out themselves. 7. We may continue our assistance to the Cultan’s administration on the coast, and by strengthening this matters will solve thernselm The wheels of the administration are now going round and it only needs the introduction of the levy corps to enable us to remove our detachment and to leave Maskat to run itself wi m the minimum of interference from us. 3d/- R.h.L.Wingate. 18.8.E0.‘w : - , wouli no 4 ' ^^cr up t,o n^clnro a pro+^ctorafe which 1 ? the last thing -In the'worl-1 that v/e• want.

Thomas told me that the Sultan intended to announce his abdication at his interview with me. As you know he never referred to the subject. Secondly, when I saw Thomas at Khassab last May, he told me that the Sultan waa quite content with the existing arrangement, which amounted to virtual abdication and would carry on under it as long as we liked. I think therefore that we may count on being able to maintain the status quo, and should work slowly to try and improve it by inducing the Sultan gradually to increase the time he spends every year in Muscat. I have no objection to your going to visit the Sultan at Dehra Bun, in fact, as you will since have seen, I thought of it myself and suggested it in my personal letter of the 21st June. You could proceed Firstly, when I went to Muscat last December from Karachi to Behra Dun an can meet the expenditure inv ment.

Sultan of Muscat &amp; Oman. After Compliments, I iniormed tne Hon’ble tiie Political Resident as to yo^r decision, which you recently conveyed to me verbally when I . saw you at Dehra Dun, that you had determined never to return to Muscat, which of course means that Your Highness intends to abdicate* The Political Resident has directed me to reply to you as follows:- 2. He is of course much disappointed at the news of your tr decision which will be a d-i-e-ta-ne-t loss to the Muscat State, and trustS/that even now Your Msuoauc Highness will reconsider your decision. If, however. Your Highness is determined to abdicate then a letter from you is necessary to this effect. 3. In connection with Your Highness’s abdication there is another matter as to which the Political Resident would like confirmation from you by letter! i.e. that lour Highness x ully understand^as doubtless you do^ the financial consequences to yourself which must follow on your abdication. 4. Your Highness has three sources of income. (a) the Zanzibar subsidy (b) the Arms. Traffic subsidy v jur rersonal allowance from the Muscat State (0) which F at present stands at Rs.10,000/- per mensem. The two subsidies are at present paid intt the Muscat State treasury towards repayment of the Government of India loan of 6* laics, but when- this loan is paid off in about^ear and half then the subsidies will be freed for origmal purpose. 5 On Your Highness's abdication, however, you will lose both the subsidies. The Zanzibar one is payable to the Sultan ' of Muscat (and will therefore be paid to your successor), and + „ .nation of the Arms Traffic is personal to you J that for the cessation o . %avA No 137 dated 4th Ramazan_3 J, j (vide Colonel 'Knox's-letter lujilcl A: Iand only while you hold tenure of power, and will therefore lapse altogether. As for the personal allowance which Your Highness now receives from the State. This xs -ill naturally have to be much reduced, since the state -ill have to provide the new Sultan —ith a personal allowance to meet his expenses, and owing to its financial position cannot possibly afford to pay two large allo—ances.. The Political Resident -ill be glad of a reply as soon as convenient to Your Highness. Usual EndingConfidential. 7 ' J vl ^ » ^O.E/ 1 950 * Politic,.! Agency A Consulate. Becess Office at Karachi.

Subject:- Abdication of Sultan of Muscat. Sir. I have the honour to submit this despatch in amplication of telegraphic correspondence ending ^ith my telegram Ho.K/28 of ith September la30. Inp ret cion of the ult.ai. 2. I stayed t*~o days in Dehra Dim most of ^hich time ^as spent in the company of His Highness, it * tr as the fir, t time that I had met him. Various of my predecessors have given character studies of Hie Hlghneee, varying eoasiaera-ly in taeir eetinateS, Thus to Mr. ’'ingate the Sultan -ae incredibly we-k, pompous and idle, not really extravagant, out silly about aoncy. a rain and idle puppet, and - ae a ruler - generally useless, *L {vide Mr. *1 letter Bo.898 of idth A.ril i o, . to Civil Cosunittloner Bo.Jidad; Oonfidentlal note to Deputy Secretory Foreign: undated; report 01 meeting -it een Mr. ng iL His Highness dated Ambala: 8th September 19 0). On the otaer hand Major Murphy stated: -1 have personally a strong high opinion of Paiyid Taimufe abilities and think, tuat under fairer siroumstaasss. he would have made an admirable ruler-. (Major Murphy'S 9.0. o.T/40 of June 17th 1029). I i aine decidedly to Major Murphy's opinion: probably the ten years , .. nee Mr. ingate came in contact with the which have elapsed since Sultan 1Sult. n have improved the latter's character. I found him indeed a very pleasant personality! far from pompous or vain: on the contrary simple and unaffected, with a sense of humour,intelli gent and with abilities certainly up to the average, and probably above. Our relatione throughout our conversations wers moet cordial. ^ r » departure. 3. His Highness seemed to take Mr. Thomas * s departure philosphically, which was convenient. Unfortunately this philosophy was evidently based on the state of mind of benevo lent neutrality described by Colonel Trevor in hie letter Ho. 256 of 4th Octooer 1921, (a state of mind I noticed in His Highness even before he mads his declaration as to not return ing to Muscat) S 'His Highness ’ s present idea is that he has now divested himself of all responsibility for the administration of tne State, and thrown it on us, and that he can live at his ease in India on a comfortable allowance ' 4. His Highness * s doubts on the change of Financial adviser© were apparently a© to the qualifications of Mr. hoiaas* s successor, and once X w&amp;B able to assure him on this point his mind seemed at rest. I enclose copies of letters A and 3 received from him (the translations are in the words of hi© confidential clerk Khan B fe 6 li* Ahmad rhubnily). Letter A ^as ^ received before I met His Highness, and is the one rsfened to &amp;-&lt;SW me. in my tmligrm of 30th August 1930. . Letter B ^as givch/by the $ult&amp;&amp; after our co.. vernation. In it, besides definitely C-D ^ agreeing to Mr. Ihomat’t eparture,the Sultan states it is nec.SEary ,h»t the Adviser should take part in political as -ell ae financial affairs. This ^as in reply to a question which 1 casually put to him as to whether he t.wujht it advisable that the Advisor should only deal with financial matters. The question is not germane to this despatch, and ''ill be dealt with in another in due course. The question of Mr. Thomas's departure having been settled, there regains t:!at the Sultan's abdication to be dealt with. Sultan* e3* Sultan 1 s abdication, 5. *Iis HighneEB 9 as already reported telegraphically, announced his decision of never returning to Muscat* ~~hen I reesed surprise at this decision, he resaarked, (as stated in my telegram Ko.A'Z'? of ^ &gt; thut he undejetood wc were well aware of his intention. It is true that Major Murphy referred to it in his D.O. N0.78-C of 15th November 19k8 quoted in my D.O. to you ho,77C of bu ^ a-fter your interview with His Highness in December 1929, in which - though given a special opportunity to do so - he did not allude to his abdication it was concluded that he had probably abandoned the idea for the present, (Your letter iJo.^ff^of /juica —tO Government of India). 6. I naturally used all possible arguments to induce the Sultan to alter his decision* 1 pointed out that - as he knew * ••/ell - both you and I had his interests at heart; that H.M. Government - on your representations - was doing its utmost to relieve the financial necessities of his State vide the scheme of raising the Customs dues from 5 % to SUxo, 7| %; that you had^applied to the Government of India for a moratorium of the next repayment of the State debt; that you had personally procowded to Sur and induced the Amir of Ja*slan to lower his flag and prumise ^^od behavious for the future, and ao^orth. I pointed out that satisfactory as the Council of Sfinistera had prored, it »ae only a makeshift; that what Arabs really appreciated ™s a personal ruler, and that the person to fill that important j»»« was obviously His Hi^ness. *y arguments war. of no avail. The Sultan merely became perturbed and re iterated his protestations that he would not return to Muscat, giving ill-health as the reason. As he had mads arrangements to go tiger shooting in ten days time, this reason - as pointed ? «* i/na /He. can hardly be out in my telegram ot / held as valid.

The fact is that he hae a 'complex' a.jainet Muscat and its reaponsihilitiee Which he heartily disliices, and nothing- as far M I can see - will remove this cu 5 .plex* abdication forthwith, and backing Saiyid Said for the Sultan- chip.

If could postpone Saiyid Taimur*8 abdication, somehow or other, for another year, it -rould be a distinct advantage. 9. In this connection I suggest that it -juld be wjrtij^hile^ JusxiExy before any other action is taken, to try and draw the Suit n do w n to earth from the attitude of bene valent neutra lity which he hae adopted (eee para 3 above), and I append a &lt;lA draft of a proposal letter to him for your aj rival, -hieh lain® itself. I have made it out as cwining from me, but you may prefer it should come from you. It is possible that when the Sultan realises that his abdication would bring him pecuniary loss he may postpone his abdication which is just what In the meantime there is no hurry, as His Migh- nee® in any case is not due at * •• • nt t till December# and # can a &gt;&amp;lt his re.ly. 10. leraonally, as I nave already stated, I like the Suita n Courses open to us. a There is the obvious course^ of accepting the Sultan’s him in very in very ordinary comfort.

In addition to hie personal allowance paid by the lbu| M t State the Sultan has too subsidies: one for the lo SE of Zanzibar and tne other condensation for cessation of the Anas Traffic. But both these subsidies are at present paid into'the'Muscat State treasury towards the repayment of the Indian Government loan of 6$ laics.

I hope he will gather from it that he cannot expect to live in comfort at Dehra Dun and draw a large allowance from the State. This is the only means that I see of bringing pressure to bear on him. If it were not for the financial aspect of the matter I'personally would see no objection to his abdication, but it is a luxury which the State cannot afford at the present moment and I entirely agree with you that we should try and fend it off.

Even if some additional revenues are obtained from an increase in the tariff and the Sur Customs there is no doubt whatever that for a long time to coma it will be neeesearjr to exercise the most stringent eeoneiy* It is for this reason that the Government of India suggested to Tour Highness that it wo^ld be preferable not to extend Mr* Thomas 1 contract but to obtain the services of an officer on a considerably smaller salary* 1 urn glad to hoar from Major Fowle that Your Highness approves of this measure and i am confident that the officer whom it is proposed to appoint in ttr»rh«aas # place will work hard and loyally to serve the Muscat State* Major fowls however writes that xcmr3* S Your Highncos iaformed him th t you did not intend to return to Mueont* T&amp;is oojae a@ a very great aurprlee to me* I am aware, of course, that Your Highness had discussed the question of aha i oat ion with say predecessors hut a® Your Highness ss&amp;de no reference to the matter in conversation with me 1 assumed that you had arrived at no definite decision in the matter and I hoped ihaty if steps were taken to improve the finances of the Muscat State and to re-establish Your highness 1 authority in those portions oi the utate where it had oeen weakened^ wte 85 ^ Your Highness would refrain from this step. If when you saw me last Movember it was at that time your definite resolve to abdicate then 1 think you should have mentions* the matter to me* X would like to urge you, m friend, to reconsider this matter since it will have most serious effects. firstly, at a time when every effort is being made to put the affairs of Muscat on a acre satisfactory oasis it will deprive the administration of the benefit of Your Highness* long experience and Your Highness will probably be replaced by a young and inexperienced ruler. Secondly, it will have the most disastrous effect upon the finances of the State at a time when, as I have already pointed out, the most rigid economy is essential.

It would be humourous if it were not so annoying. It is, I think, rather a pity that you mentioned to him the possibility of my meeting him in Karachi; perhaps it would have been better if when he refused to come to Muscat you had merely said that you would report the matter to me. I have no intention of going to meet him at Karacni except in tne last resort and I am inclined to think the oest thing to do nov/ would be to write to him on bxie follo'/vj.ng lines. To ;es I ■ reiterate that the annual subsidy will cea,se if he and that he was distinctly warned hy Kno* that it was personal to himself and there is not the least likelihood of tne Government of India extending it and that I cannot for one moment admit his contention that it was not a personal i subsidy. Secondly, that I cannot go to Karachi to meet him as it involves a protracted absence from the Gulf, ^ dly, that if he will not come to Muscat then the only thing will be for you and me to submit our proposals regarding his oto to the Government of India without previous allowances, etc. to ino _ . * i .-n these circumstances discussion with him and hint that m tnese at in his absence which he will not decisions may be arrived « __ n «+• vnc, have your views on thio* like.

Is the whole amount remitted to him at Dehra Dun or does some go towards domestic expenditure at Muscat or elsewhere? You will see that in 1920 it was pro posed to reduce it to Rs.5,000/- and this threat apparently had a good effect.- It was actually reduced for three months in 1921, hut the cut was subsequently refunded.cS) Translation of a letter dated Dehra Dun the 12th /3 ^ Jamadi al Ula^l 6th October 1930 ) from His Highness Taimur Faisax, Sultan of Muscat and ’Oman, to the Hon t ble Lt.Colonel H.V.Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

As the Political Agent, Muscat, Major Fowle informed you I had gone to Kashmir for a month, owing to the great heat of Dehra Dun and to the bad state of my health. Towards the end of last September I went tiger shooting, but without success. It was however good exercise which the doctors advise me to take and I am very fond of shooting. As you know during my stay in Kashmir, I had some correspondence with Major Fowle and after my return at the end of August, he came and saw me in order tc dis cuss the question of Wazir Thomas and it was mutually agreed upon that some other official and Adviser should take his place in the Finance Ministry of our State, hy reason for agreeing to this was the improvement of the finances of the Muscat State. As regards what you say about the favour which our friend the Government of India have been pleased to bestow, by making understandings with, and seeking the consent of the two friendly Governments of the United States of America and of France, with regard to the- 2 - ^ l the increase in Customs tariff of Muscat and * Oman, I thank the Government of India for the efforts they are making to improve the Muscat State, and I also thank you for your efforts and hope that you v/ill soon obtain the consent of the French Government, as you have obtained that of the United States of America. As regards what you say about your visit to Sur, the of the and that you have persuaded^3haikh/Bani Bu f Ali to refrain from agitation there I hope that he will fulfil his under takings and thank you for your efforts. I trust that in future no further trouble will arise at Sur that may necessitate the Muscat State troubling the Government. I trust that Divine Providence vail assist the Muscat State and that an improvement will be effected in the Customs revenue at Sur and that the State Treasury will be benefited thereby. I am certain that the difficulties are due to the present fall in the value of silver and the dollar exchange and this has brought about j.eavj losses in this country and particularly in the finances of the Muscat State, as pointed out by you. It ceitaxnlj is necessary for the Muscat State to exercise economy, so as to bring about an improvement in its finances. I confirm what the Political Agent, Major Powle, wrote to you with regard to ^ determination not to o „ -Khic; is that 1 am unabls return to Muscat.

If the ailments of which I complain had not disabled me I would certainly have carried on my duties in agreement with you. Major Powle made every effort to dissuade me from this determination, hut I could net force my soul to its hard task. Finally, he (Major Fowle) asked me to travel to Muscat for two or three weeks, hut I did not agree to do so and in all the replies that I gave him I regarded him as your representative and of the friendly Government ( of India ), and he finally stated as you have also done that an interview with you was absolutely essential and then he asked me whether it would he possible for me to go to Karachi to meet you. To this I agreed and I am ready for an interview with you with all pleasure and honour at Karachi at any time and hour which you may like to fix. But I am not prepared to go to Muscat and I dropped you a hint shout my intentions and illnesses in the course of your visit to Muscat and our interview there in the month of November last.

Office of the PoliticalResident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Bahrain, Dated the 11th November 1930. To His Highness Sir Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal bin Turki, K.C.I.E., ^ C. S »X», Sultan of Muscat and ’Oman, Deiira Dun. ^ Lf f h- My honoured and valued friend, I have received Your Highness 1 esteemed letter of the 12th Jamadi A1 Ula, 1349, and was pleased to learn that Your Highness had been well enough to go out tiger shooting. Your Highness writes that the State of your health prevents your perform ing the duties incumbent upon you and this is the reason that you are unwilling to return to Muscat. Last year, however, Your Highness had been for several months in Muscat and was able to travel to Dhofar and other places in your territory and in winter the climate in Muscat is very pleasant. I am confident therefore that a visit in the winter to Muscat could not possibly injure Your Highness' health and that with the sympathetic advice of Major Fowle .the Political Agent, and the assistance of the new Wazir, you would not find • •!&gt;„. 0 V - 2 - find the performance of your duti difficult. •! es unduly Iheie is one matter regarding which Tour Highness appears to be still under a misapprehension although 1 tried to make the matter quite clear to you in my previous letter. That is the questio n of the subsidy of one lakh at present paid to Your Highness by the Government of India* tou contend that your successor has a right to this, I would remind Your Highness that in 3923 Lieutenant Colonel Knox s then Political Resident ? informed Your Highness in writing that this subsidy was personal to yourself and .would not be continued to your successor. As 1 have no reason to suppose that the Government of India have in any way modified their previous decision in this matter, Your Highness will readily realise in what grave financial difficulty your abdication will involve the State since not only will the subsidy stop but also, as I pointed out previously, it will be necessary to give a suitable civil list to Your Highness* successor, and make some provision for your own expenses, and I must tell you frankly that the State is not in a position at the present time to meet this expenditure. Your Highness states that your needs are simple and that you will not require a large allowance. Your Highness will however doubtless remember that in i ii ■ ■, u * i % r-3- 1921 owing to the fact that you did not return to the State, it wa S found neoese- '-.&gt;y to reduce the allowance which you drew from the State and on that occasion Your Highness protested strongly against this reduction and said that you could not manage on the reduced allowance that was then fixed. Your Highness has suggested that I should come and meet you at Karachi As you are aware* I have many important duties to perform in the Persian Gulf and many places to visit during the cold weather* and it is very difficult for me to absent myself for the period necessi tated by a journey to Karachi and back. In any case I cannot go to Karachi in the near future and the important matters which will have to be settled, should Your Highness not return, cannot wait till then. If Yc^r Highness is un willing to return to Muscat, the only course open to me will be to discuss the important matters that will have to be settled, such as the Civil list of Y 0 ur Highness* successor, the allowance of Your Highness, etc., with the Council of State and the Political Agent, and to make my recommendations to the Government of India without having the benefit of Your Highness* advice and without consul tation .....consultation with you except by letter, and in these circumstances it is possible that some of the decisions arrived at may not be in accordance with Y 0 ur Highness' wishes oi views, a roatter which I would very greatly regret* In these circumstances, I would urge Your Highness to reconsider your decision and instead of proceeding to Ceylon to come to Muscat as soon as possible. 1 shall be ready then to visit you there and we can discuss these matters together. I desire to express the high consideration which I entertain for Y 0 ur Highness and to subscribe myself, iour Highness* sincere friend, sd/ H.V.Eiscoe Lt.Colonel, Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf.Confidential , D.O.No. 626-3 of 1930. tT British Residency, Bushire, the 8th Becemher 1930. OTi) 111 ' '-M* I enclose herewith a translation of a reply I have received from His Highness the Sultan. As you will see, he still refuses to return to Muscat and proposes to go off to Ceylon, Sayid Said said he would write to him urging him to reconsider this decision; I doubt this having any effect, but still 1 will await the Sultan's reply to Sayid Said before addressing Government. In the event of His Highness still remaining obdurate, I am inclined to agree with you that the best thing to do would be to ask Government to overlook his failure to return during the current cold weather, and then to inform him that should he persist in this attitude, His allowance will be reduced to, say, Rs.3,000/- a montn forthwith, I do not know exactly what figure to suggest, but I want to recommend a sum that will moi e or less compel Mm to come back. Rs.3,000/- a month, of course, is more than adequate for his personal expenditure m India, hut I do not know what his domestic expenditure is, i.e. how much it costs him to support his three v«j.ves, children, etc. Could you kindly make enquiries locally and let me know what sum, in your opinion, should he fixed? It should, I think, he such a sum as will just enable him to • C.W.Fowle, C .3 .E. , Political Agent and H.B.M* s Consul, M u s c__a_tj Lmore. to subsist on an exceedingly moderate scale, but no Please telegraph to me what reply the Sultan ; ives to Sayid Said.

In the “best of the time we received with the hand of pleasure your honour's esteemed letter lIo.44-T of 1930, dated the 11th H 0 vemher 1930 corresponding to the 2lst Jamadi ath Than! 1349, We read it with great attention and care and your friend understood its contents to the end. Yes, as regards the question of our coming to Muscat, just as your honour already learnt from our last letter and from what we spoke verbally to your Agent at M u ocat, Major it to our friend the Government of India that the fixed bounty of a Lakh of Rupees which they bestow upon us in lieu of the losses suffered by us we do not think that our abdication should cause a cut of this financial aid, have every hope for the attention of the High Government at this t financial danger to the Government of Muscat to continue this aid and to favour by changing their former view. The deffi- ciency and the losses in finance of Muscat and the acute Fowls, we have no wish to do so for the reasons which we already expressed And we inform your honour and we request you to submit difficulties ensuing therefrom are not hidden from you. In view of the financial difficulties of our Government, ihe necessary expenditure for our successor and for ourselves should be made from that aid. And we inform your honour, just as youmentioned in your letter that mrr nr.„ aZ0Ur ar eufflents and our rejection of the reduced pay in !9 S1 vrere in order&gt; ^ ^ your Political %ent at Muscat knows fully well aa to what amount is sufficient for the exTw*n«Aa ^ 4 .^ expenses of the person of the Sultan of Muscat to manage his affairs, and we do not doubt that the Headquarters of the Political Resident at Bushire are also aware of this important point. And as we mentioned, necessary simple expenditure would suffice during our abdication. It is not hidden from you that v/e have no income except what we receive from the Treasury of ,our Government. Anti no doubt that the allowance should be sufficient. Just as we mentioned in our last letter to you we had explained to Waair Thomas what would be sufficient for our expenditure, and it cannot be less than that, and we hope that he would explain it to you when he meet's you at Muscat. And we know your inability to reach Karachi as proposed by us and the Consul of Muscat, and we are so»ry for our inability to come to Muscat. As regards your proceeding there and discussing with the Council of Ministers and the Consul about fixing expenditure for our successor and for ourselves, undoubtedly that is your important business in this important arrangement. Anti your honour has mentioned that perhaps soma arrangement may not be in Accordance to our wishes. e say had we not been trusting aid relying upon the (High) Government anti their men in our affairs, it nay the ref ore be that whatever is against our wishes (isi in the interests oi the both parties our friand the (High) Govermaent anti the Government oi Muscat, and (of) the preservation of this dynasty. And G 0 d willing, in the.second week of December, we snail proceed from Derahdun for Ceylon. In the end (v/e say) we are ever amongst those faithful.

His Highness should be informed that in 1920, when the Government of India agreed to assist him in the negotiat ions between his state and the rebels and in the continued reconstruction pf his finances, they stipulated that His Highness should spend 3 months every year at Muscats the Sultan accepted these conditions, last winter, however, His Highness did not return to Muscat; further he left Muscat without announcing that it was not his intention to return, and refused the Hon’ble the Political Resident’s invitation11 s to come to Muscat to disease the various otters which Must obviously be settled if His Highness persists in his desire not to return. The Government of India cannot but view with grave displeasure his failure to adhere to his under taking to spend 3 months of every year in Muscat and his refusdl last November to meet the Political Resident at Muscat to discuss important matters that required to he settled. On this occasion, however, the Government of India aie willing uo overlook his absence from Muscat this winter and have agreed to continue payment of the Arms Subsidy for «i - - * I * , * W&gt; ** 111 11 -| , , ^T 1 ** another year, 4, I am to request however that His Highness may be informed that the examination of the finances of the State undettaken by the new Financial Adviser have disclosed a serious state of affairs, which is aggravated by the present trade depression. Endeavours are being madd to increase the revenues of the state, but meanwhile drastic economies are necessary if the budget is to be balanced. The allowance of Rs,10,000 per mensem fixed for the Privy Purse was contingent on the ability of the finances of the state to bear this expenditure and they are no longer able to do so. The Government of India after careful consideration have therefore come to the conclusion that in the interests of the state it is necessary that His Highness f allowance should be reduced to Rs.5000 per mensem, 5, it is hoped that His Highness, after giving the matter his serious consideration, will see the wisaom, uoth in his own interests as well as in those of the state, of modifying his decision and returning to Muscat next winter. Should His Highness persist in his determination to stay away from-3- . HO U S3, ll-D id*, ii -TT-A. 376 from Muscat, it will involve the state in further heavy expenditure and it my become necessary further to reduce his allowance next year. 6 * 1 am ^so to ask you to inform the Council of the reduction made in the Sultan *3 allowance. 7. As s’esards the reservations mentioned in the India Office letter above, the conditions accompanying the Sultan’s allowcuice c &gt;,a e contained xn ^rovernment of India’s memorandum ^ Uo, 1766EA, dated the 1st December (1930) It will be observed that in this letter it is definitely stated that nothing should be said 'on these tv/o points' for the present. Consequently, it is not ciear whether these conditions were ever communicated to the Sultan* Colonel Trevor in 1921 cited this memorandum as his authority for according his sanction to a reduction in the Sultan’s allowance, it is therefore presumed that they were. As, however, it lias frequently been explained to the Sultan that the amount of his allowance depends on the ability &gt;&lt; of the state to pay - vide Mr. Wingate’s Bo*564, dated the 29th March 1921 - this is not a point of any great importance. But the Political Resident would like to know, for his own information, whether, in fact, these conditions were ever made known to the Sultan* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Capt • 9 Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gull.(received under India, ^ ^.1115/31, dated a j?q; Z.1115/31.

The conditions specified are set out in paragraph 29. They included H fixation of amouhtof Privy Purse”, and at the Sultan’s request the Privy Purse was in fact fixed at Rs .10,000* The conditions that he should reside in Muscat for at least three months a year and that the Privy Purse_ should be definitely t ixed at Rs.10,000 «•». le ^ nder Secretary of State, FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l.

On this occasion,however, the Government of India are willing to overlook Your Highness*payment of the Mrmn Subsidy far another year. 2, I &amp;a requested, however, to inf or® Your Highness that the examination of the finances of the State undertaken by the new Financial Adviser has disclosed a serious state of affairs,which being mad© to increase the revenues of the State,but meanwhile drastic economies are necessary if the budget is to be balanced. The allowance of Rs 10,000 per mensem fixed for the Privy Purse was contingent on the ability of the finances of the State to bear this expenditure and they are no longer able to do so. The Government of £ndl&amp; after careful consideration have therefore cose to the conclusion that in the InfeeB^sts of the State it is necessary that Your Highness f s allowance should be reduced to RsSOOO- per mensem. 3* It Is hoped that Your Highness,after giving the matter your serious conslderatlon,will see the wisdom, both in your interest a well as in those of the State,of modifying your decision and returning to Muscat next Winter. Should Your Highness persist In your determination to stay away from Muscat,it will Involve ^h® State in further heavy expenditure and it may become necessary further to reduce your allowance next year.

I informed him of the decision of the Government of India to reduce his allowance to RsSOOO-.of which I had already Informed you, and gave him a letter which X had been directed by the Political Resident to write to him. 2. During the discussions I had with H.H, he stated that he was going to meet you at Lahore some time shortly. I suggested that as Lahore was on the way to Karachi, where X was returnlng.lt might be convenient for us three to meet there. H.H. agreed,sent you a telegram accordingly,and left for Denra Dun. Yesterday evening I received the follwoing telegram* Aisald verj ill cannot travel to Lahore will you come to Denra Dun X£ possiole to see him his son coming here direct. Civil Burgeon. Dehra Dun is of course not in tne direction of Karachi,and unless H.H. wanted to see me especially it did not seem worth while spending time and money in going there after the long discussions urgent we had nad here. I accordingly sent H.H. the followlngjl^telegram yesterday evening: Much regret to hear of your illness. We discussed matters fully here and unless you particularly wish to see me d/ in which case please sen me an urgent telegram I propose returning to Karachi 29th leaving here 15 hours.

H.H’s llness m$st have been a sudden attack of something he was quite well when he left here on Sunday. I sincerely trust you will fingj. him better when you reach Behra Dun. Please inform me how he progresses. 3* There are various points which I discussed at length with H.H. bu t which I would be grateful if you would also take up with him.First - please impress on him the serious financial condition of the State which I doubt If H.H. fully realises In spite of the Btress I laid on It. There may be two opinions as^exaotly how serious tnls condition is,but that it is serious there Is no of doubt whatever. You amaxfuily have full knowledge wtti. the Ml- flnjolaj. oriola tuU’ou^n wfo-ioii Btalie is passing,and which has necessitated econojiles in tii© Lievy etc etciand then© is thenefop© no need for me to go into details in this letter. 4. There Is also the important question of th© Arms Subsidy,which ^ ae you are aware - is personal to H.H. so long as he remains Sultan The Government of India have,as X have already informed you,agree! to overlook H.His absence from Muscat this Winter and have agreed to continue payment of the Subsidy for another year. This - as you agreed when I informed you,and as H.H. also agrees - is a generous act on the part of Government. But if H.H. persists in his determination no$ to return to Muscat and the Subsidy Is thereby X lost I really do not know waht will happen. The State finds it difficult enough to carry on with the subsidy,what is it going to do without? One result would certainly be that any allowance which the State could afford to pay H.H. would be reduced to a very small amount indeed. 5. Another point is that ae follows* H.H. 5 s allowance of Rg«v,00Q- used to be divided as follows. Rs&gt;!QO~ for H.H. himealf,K b2, 00 - for your so If and the other members of the Ruling Family (pal'- through Hasib for some reason I am not quite cxear about),and Rs5000- for Nasib towards the debt which H.H. owes him.

Memorandum * With reference to correspondence ending with my telegram Mo.Mil of 29th April. The circumstances in which the meeting at Lahore with the Sultan and Seiyid Said fell through are explained in the attached copy of a letter I wrote to Saiyid Said. If His Highness was 'very ill' I considered that he would not he able to transact business for some days, in which case I would simply be wasting my time at Dehra Dun. This proved correct as on return here I received a letter from Saiyid Said from Dehra Dun to the effect that H.H. was ill in bed with fever, and that he would take up business with him when he was better. My letter to Saiyid Said also touches on various imp or tan points connected with Puscct. 2. As stated in paragraph 1 of my letter to .a'y‘ Said I had several diecuBsions with H.H.

As a personal friend of his - personal friend of his - which as a matter of fact 1 em - I asked his permission to speak plainly. He said he quite appreciated the fact that we were friends, and would like me to speak out. I said that we talked of his 'allowance did hfc give in returns His ancestors in the Sultanate whatever mistakes they may have made, and every man makes mistakes, at all events stuck to their post, worked In it, and died in it. Every man whether he was a coolie or a Sultan had his work to do, and surely his - H.H’s - work was-I ventured to point out-in Muscat, and not touring about India leading a life of leisure. The Sultan took my homily in good part, Ho.17-1 of 31st March, to which he said he would send a rep Presumably Saiyid Said will bring it back with him here in a few days. He will also be able to inform me of the result of his conversation with the Sultan, which I will communicate to you in due course. from the State”; but where did this allowance really come from?

At the same time I am glad to inform Your Highness that from what the doctors tell me they can practically guarantee a cure if Saiyid Said carries out their instructions. His absence from Muscat at the present moment will be awkward, but it will only be for a short time and we can make arrangements to carry on until he returns in October. I have had a long conversation with Saiyid Said on the subject. He is anxious to return to Muscat now. I quite appreciate his desire to work for the State, whose interests I know he has very much at heart, hut the best interests of the State will he served by his carrying out the advice of the doctors.
