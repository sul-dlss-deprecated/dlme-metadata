Letters of thanks were exchanged after the visits took place.The Political Agent, Bahrain and the Saudi Emirs also exchanged petitions on behalf of some locals of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia respectively. The petitions were mainly regarding the claims of debts, properties, or stolen boats. Debtors from Saudi Arabia fled to Bahrain, hence the Saudi Emirs wrote to the Political Agent, Bahrain, requesting for those who fled to be seized. The Political Agent in turn replied with the available information about the named subjects at his end. The same procedure was done with the Bahraini debtors who fled to Saudi Arabia. The file also includes some letters from merchants such as Abdulaziz al-Qusaibi, informing the Political Agent about their intentions to travel to Qatif to visit a certain notable, to recover some debts, or for trade purposes.Most of the correspondence in the file is in Arabic. Folios 116-122 are file notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Petitions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000252#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000252#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000252#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
