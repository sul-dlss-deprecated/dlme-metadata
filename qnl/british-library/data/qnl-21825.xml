Subjects - Diatilled water for atora^'.e Batter.iea t The history of this subject is as follows. garly this year Navai Intelligence, Bombay, asked Cehaors to keep a watch on despatches of distilled water outside India. The reason fotjthis is that the wlectric batteries of submarines are sealed and lea&amp;age|i 9 small in the normal course of events but a damaged enemy submarine might send replenishment of distilled water in which case she would slip up a creek for repairs and endeavour to obtain all supplies including distilled water. 2. 1 watch maintained on despatched of distilled water might lead to information on the location of enemy submarined. 3. From time to time censors and the Customs authorities have been reporting despatches of distilled water and one that caused uneasiness, because of its size, has produced the attached report from the Special Branch, Police, Bombay, through the Director Intelligence Bureau. 4. Would you please asertain from Bahrein as to whether the despatch^ mentioned in the attached S.B, note are normal, iny other information o distilled water purchased from India by countries adjacent to Bahrein will be welcomed for communication to Censers, Customs, and Naval Intelligence. Please refer to your secret D.O.letter No.61/^.Gr./40(l)-Y, dated the 20ti August, 1940, and its accompaniment, regarding the export of distilled water to Bahrein, by Universal Automobiles, Bombay. Ptease show that Universal Automobiles, Sandhurst Road, near Sandhurst A Bridge, Bombay, is a small Indian oonoern dealirg in motor car acesssnries. The consignee, Khalil bin Fbhrahim K&amp;noo, Bahrein is the sales and service agent for Ford cars and trucks, who has been a custome: for Ford oars and trucks, who has been a customer of Universal Automobiles for the past two years during whiclvt.T.O.

The importance of the oil from Abadan to supply the Allied forces in the Par East is obvious, and the Japanese might be expected to take steps to hinder this oil traffic. The Japanese began with the advantage of having infoimation concerning South Persia which vouId assist them in arranging for their submarines to be supplied from * the South Persian coast should opportunity arise. It is not known ..i- whether the Japanese in fact, have ever established a supply system in South Persia, but recent reports indicate that they were reconnoitring the area, possibly with this object in view* Q3RMAK ACTIVITY . 5* In 1940 the German agent, P.PUmel, toured the coastal area of Lingeh and Bandar Abbas* Kumel is known to have been a member of the Fifth Column in Persia, controlled from Isfahan by the German, Franz Mayer, 6* In September 19 42, Major Schultze, formerly a member of the German Consulate at Tabriz and now the main German agent in South Persia, claimed to have started a rumour that the Germans had landed supplies by steamer on the Persian coast* An operational plan dated 10th August 1942 and written by Franz Mayer, apparently for despatch to the German authorities in Europe, has the question ••Can you bring arms to safe Gulf ports by U-boats or have them brought by the Japanese?* In November a report was received that during October, German submarines had unloaded ammunition and explosives near Jaslv Again in November 1942, a companion of Franz Mayer who had been captured by our Security authorities in Persia, stated under interrogation that a submarine had landed arms in the Jask area during September 1942* The arms are said to have been intended for the use of the Qashgai tribes who are alleged to have been warned of the arrival by German agents* Major Schultze has been living with the Qashgai tribes since July 1942. None of these reports, however, have ever been confirmed, and it is still uncertain whether a German submarine ever touched at the Persian coast* GENERAL . 7o 0n 22nd October 1942 a ship was sunk in the neighbourhood of Has al Kadd by a U-boat. This is the only positive evidence- 2 - which exists that U-boats have been in this area, but since September 1942 there have been persistent rumours from aircraft, patrol ships and Intelligence sources of U-boats being sighted near the land. Some of these reports are circumstantial, and are probably reliable. 8• There is very little doubt that at one time or another, U-boats have made contact with the shore since last Septembero This period coincides with the cessation of the monsoon swell on the Baluchistan and Mekran coasts. 9. The most circumstantial reports which have been received of U-boats having been actually seen are as followss- April 24th 1942 - Off Ormara. U-boats questioned a dhow. January 3rd 1943- Off Porbandar. Two U-boats sighted. This report Jan/Feb 1943 - 50 miles S.W. of Jask, combined with a spate of reports off Has al hadd and Charbar. which individually are somewhat unreliable, indicate that U-boats have, for some reason not yet known, communicated with someone on the dnore or have landed agents, or possibly arranged for future supplies either on shore or in dhows. 11© The other factor to be borne in mind is that, ex cept on one occasion, shipping has not been molested, although at seme time during these months there must have been favourable opportunities to attack. 12. It is not thought that U-boats would derive any special value from W/T. messages concerning shipping. They must know that there is a constant stream of ships and convoys in the Gulf of Oman. If W/T messages are being transmitted to U.boats this is more likely to be for the purpose of arranging rendezvous with agents on shore. 13. The object of these U-boats visits remains at present a matter of speculation. When the monsoon breaks in May, communication with the shore along this coast will become very difficult, if not impossible, due ta the heavy swell which extends as far west as Jask. control but steps are now being taken to place them under British control. There is also the possibility of private W/T sets being used by Persians, who, before the War, were agents of Japanese and German shipping firms. For example, the foxmer Japanese shipping agent Abdul Hamid Khonji and his secretary Kamel, visited Japan in 1941. They left Kobe in April 1942 and arrived in Tehran in May. Abdul Hamid announced that it was hie intention to go and live in Bahrain, and Kamel in Xingeh© For three months, however, they stayed in Tehran with Abdul Razzaq, Abdul Hanid f B brother, whose father-in-law Mahmoud Mahmoud is employed in the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs and is married to a German. They are all said to be very pro-German. Abdul Hamid stated that he had met many Japanese officials in Japan. In October 1943 he was reported to be in Sharjah. The whereabouts of Kamel is not known. 15. During November 1942 verey lights were seen on the coast near Jask. Investigations suggested that these lights had been made by the R.A.F. station in the vicinity. By coincidence, on three occasions convoys left Bandar Abbas the day following the sighting of these verey lights. CONCLUSION. is borne out by others within a few days in areas from which U-boats might have come. . 10 . The balance of evidence of these, and a mass of reports 14. There are W/T stations at Jask and Lingeh under Persian / 16 It is- 3 - s' \ v CONCLUSI ON ♦ l6o It ia possible that the enemy are equally interested in the Arabian coast as a source of supplies for submarines© Up to the present, however, no reports have been received of any enemy activity affecting the coast or hinterland of Oman# There are certain advantages perhaps, which the Persian coast can offer, such as a more numerous and varied population, a greater abundance of local supplies and a number of trained agents already established, who might be expected to assist in setting up a supply system with local fishing craft# 17 0 it is perhaps fortunate that, as far as can be ascertained the enemy agents in Persia are nearly all German controlled, while the submarines are presumably Japanese# 18o Similarly the interests of the Japanese and Germans in this area are by no means identical; in fact, Naser Khan, the qashgai tribal leader although willing to intrigue woth the Germans, is reliably reported to have said that he would fight against the Japanese if they landed. Both Germany and Japan may have ambitions for Persia in their New Order and these different ambitions cannot easily be reconciled# For this reason it is felt that any co-ordinated action by the Axis in this area is unlikely. It is probable that all instances of submarine activity in this area were really Japanese, and that they were reported as German in error# it should be explained here that by making submarine to shore contact the enemy/secure several advantages for his ^would organisations on land in addition to the help that such contacts would give to his submarines. The submarines could supply instructions, W/T transmitters, and personnel in exchange for information, food and petrol. 2 o # it is of interest to note that reliable reports have been received from India of similar submarine activity off the South coast of India. At the end of September 1942, Indians employed as Japanese agents landed on the coast of South India fioc Japanese submarines and were later captured. Deep sea fishermen from South India are said to have frequently met Japanese submarines while at their fishing ground. It is also reported from India that enemy submarines have been sighted in the last few months off both the Bast and West coasts of India# v . 2i 0 There have also been unconfirmed reports fi'om India cl parties being landed to buy provisions, of signals from submarines to shore and vice versa and of fur^er agents having been landed in India. 22© Comparison between this information received from India and that recently received independently from South Persia strengthens the belief that the Japanese, at least, are preparing to increase their submarine activity in that part of the Arabian Sea adjoining the Gulf of Oman. It is difficult to believe that all these reports of submarine to shore contacts are merely rumours, started perhaps by the enemy. 23. Steps are being taken to reduce the danger of submarines making contacts with the shore in this area, by improving our Security control over the adjoining coast and ove^. the local native oraft. To assist in this work it is important that al^ reports of submarine activity in this area should be reported by signal to S.N.O.P.G. and this Centre. 24 0 This Security Paper is issued with the approval of S.N.O.P.G. and must not be reproduced without prior reference to S.N.O.P.G. and to this Centre.

                              Falmouth, off the Oman coast in June 1940 (f 2);correspondence and memoranda relating to the import from India into Bahrain and the Trucial Coast of distilled water, which might indicate the possible presence in the area of an enemy submarine (distilled water being required for repairs to submarine batteries) (ff 5-10). Government of India correspondence raises concerns over distilled water imports into Bahrain by Khalil bin Ebrahim Kanoo [Khalīl Ibrāhīm Kānū], though the Political Agent writes that Kanoo imports his water for car servicing and is above suspicion (ff 16-17). Further imports of distilled water into Bahrain and the Trucial Coast are closely monitored (ff 19-24, f 30);reports of a heavy explosion off the coast of Kalba in January 1941, with fresh oil seen on the sea shortly thereafter (ff 25-26);a note on enemy submarine activity off the Mekran [Makran] coast, prepared by H K Dawson Shepherd of the Combined Intelligence Centre Iraq (CICI), dated 14 February 1943, with details on: German and Japanese interests in Persia; German agents in Persia; reports of a German submarine landing arms at Jask; the possibility of U-Boats making contact with the Persian coast (ff 33-34);investigation into the background of a resident of Khor Fakkan [Khawr Fakkān] in November 1943, believed to have pro-Axis sympathies, and whose presence at Khor Fakkan is considered suspicious in light of the sinking of a submarine off the coast of Khor Fakkan (f 37). A report by the POTC reveals that no pro-Axis connections or suspicious activities have been discovered (ff 35-36, f 43);a request by the SNOPG, 17 November 1943, to investigate the Danish employees of a fish canning factory at Bandar Abbas [Bandar-e ʻAbbās], some of whom may hold pro-German sympathies (f 39).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Khor Fakkan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Gulf of Oman </geographic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Submarines</topic></subject><subject><topic>Submarine warfare</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00005f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
