Deter#* ■Ist of papers forwarded.A note on the visit of Major T.Hickinbotham, to Colonel Bertram Thomas, O.B.E,. f s Centre for Arabic Studies. at Jerusalem. On the 14th of October I arrived in Jerusalem to stay for two days with Colonel Bertram Thomas, O.B.E., at the Centre for Arabic Studies. 2. The students, of whom there are twenty, are housed in the old city in fine premises designated the Austrian Hospice which still belong to an Austrian religious Order. It has not been found possible for every student to have a room to himself but so spacious is the accommodation that it is no hardship to share with another officer. The students mess together on the lower floor and have a common sitting room. Their hours of work are such that there is ample time for exercise and the week ends are at the s tudents* own disposal. 3. . The students are from the Army and the Royal Air Force and have all of them seen considerable war service and have been selected by the Commanders-in-Chief concerned. They are all with one exception graduates of Oxford and Cambridge Universaties, the exception is I believe a graduate of Glasgow University. There are several Oxford and Cambridge 'Blue*' among thorn and at least one musician of considerable ability. They vary in rank from senior Lieutenant to junior Lieutenant Colonel or Wing Commander but are all under the age of 30 and are most of them in their middle twenties. 4. The course lasts for one year during which time the student is required to attend lectuces in Arabic totalling at least four hours a day. It is normal for the student to put in a further two hours a day*s study of the language during his spare time. An expert European instructor is resident and well qualified Arab teachers lecture daily. The Arabic course has been so arranged that At the end of twelve months I have no doubt that the students will be well grounded in classicAl Arabic, capable of reading with facility Arabic journals, and daily news* papers, and fluent In conversation. At the *' VR ® tllne tha P osslbl y more interewting side of Arab studies lias not been neglected /and-2- ^cs) and lectures are delivered every week by experts on a variety of subjects ranging from 'A History of the Crusades' to 'Women*s place in Islamic Life'* The students are often required to write an essay some few days after having heard a lecture on a particular subject and the Director makes a point of dealing with each individual essay himself. 5. The High Commissioner in Palestine ? the District Officers, Glubb Pasha of Trans-Jordan, and other experienced administrators and Arabists often ask students from the Course either to spend the week-end at their homes or to accompany them on a short tour. Many of the lecture^ are the most expert that can be obtcilii^d on their particular subject and all of them are men of considerable experience of the Middle East and the ways of the inhabitants thereof. • The Centre is particularly fortunate in having Colonel Bertram Thomas as its first Director for he is personally known to the vast majority of experts on Arabia and #Arab affairs and can thus induce many shy officials to convey some portion of their knowledge to his students when they visit Jerusalem besides being able to persuade the busiest of officials to spare the time to deliver lectures. In addition of course, Colonel Bertram Thomas is a well known literary figure and an explorer of renown with a very sound knowledge of Arabic and a curious proficiency in a number of colloquial dialects. 6. The Centre is financed by the Foreign Office and the Army and although no specific promise is made to individual students it is more than probable that each officer who qualifies at the Centre will quickly find employment. I have been given to under stand that the Colonial Office have asked for five of the students every year. I think it would be admirable if one or two officers of the Indian Political Service could be sent on the Course each year. They would have an opportunity of learning a very important language and of acquiring a knowledge of Middle East affairs which would be of the utmost value to them and to India. 24-10-1944.i ^clegram From To i {op eated No. Dated Government of India, New Delhi. decretetry to the Political Resident Persian Gulf,- Pushire.

Jir I have the honour to enclose for the information of the Government of India a cony of.a note on the Centre of Arab Gtudies in the Liddle East, together with its Syllabus. It .will be seen that this is of a very comorehensive nature, and rives some idea of the immense diversity of interests which make up what we know as the Arab world. I was a little doubtful at the outset lest the Centre mirht not be organised on a ver’ practical basis, and that the Services would be unwilling .to spare suitable men as candidates. In this connection I enclose a note by Major Hickinbotham, who like myself was somewhat critical of the scheme at its outset, in which he mr.kes it clear that the scheme has proved a groat success, and is filling a very real need. 2. At the nresent moment our cadre is practical 1 y bankrupt of officers of Arab experience and we have had to make do with a very limited number who acquire such knowledre as they can while doing a full day's work at their political duties’. It is clear that in the future we shall be completely outclassed unless we are prepared to rive Gulf officers better training, and I therefore recommend that the Government of India should permit major Hickinbotham to proceed to Jerusalem before the commencement of his leave and see whether he can induce one or two of these young men to‘“throw in their lot with us on the completion of their course. Mr. Bertram Thomas has been a good friend of the Government of India and I am sure he would be ore oared to helo us In this matter if his assistance were sought. It is clear that unless very early action is taken our cadre in the Gulf will collapse. enclosures to His Majesty's iecretary of Gtate for India. with reference to his endorsement No. C/1544 dated 31st October I am sending a cony of this letter with its Political Resident, Persian Gulf.

Galloway, QBE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, (Camp) Shiraz. C ■^ o . NOT-il ON THE N EWI\£AN SCHOOL OF MISSIONS. THARQR. J£RUSiiLEM . I attended the Arabic classes held during the summer term at the Newman School of Missions^ Jerusalem. The term was a short one, commencing on the 21st of July and terminating on the 31st of August# In all there were 30 working days (Saturdays and Sundays being holidays)# Attendance was in the mornings only, from 8-15 to 11-45 - divided into four periods of 45 minutes each with a 30 minute break for prayers and refreshments# Lectures on such subjects as 'The Life of the Prophet', 'Islam', 'Phonetics', etc#, were also included in the syllabus and on most Saturdays visits to places of religious and historical interest in and around Jerusalem were arranged by the Mission# 2. The Arabic teachers were all Christian Arabs (male and female). There were six teachers for the syllabus to which I was working. I was unable to ascertain their actual teaching qualifications but most of them were elderly and had been teaching Arabic for many years. Three of my teachers were particularly good. There were about 20 students (of both sexes) attending regularly for Arabic study (others attended for Hebrew which was also taught). With the exception of myself and one other, they were all Missionaries and the majority of them were Americans# 3# The students were divided into classes according to their degree of scholarship in the language. Some of them had 1 been studying Arabic at the Mission and elsewhere for some time and others were complete beginners like myself. They were all however there to learn Arabic with the intention of attending the Mission classes for at least a year. The syllabus was therefore arranged accordingly i#e#, for students who proposed to attend regularly for at least a year. My brief attendance of 30 days raised rather a problem because, had I followed the regular syLlabus and started with the beginners, I should have covered very little ground in that short period. The principal of the Mission (Hev.Bishop) took a considerable personal interest in my case and arranged my lessons in such a manner as to concentrate the regular syllabus and enable me to cram as much as was possible in the short time available. Of my six teachers I attended two regularly each day - one for grammar and one for 7 reading and pron^unciation. These two teachers were excellent and I found my lessons with them were by far the most beneficial. Except for the grammar lessons, which were attended by two other students, I had all my lessons alone, as sitting in class would have entailed my following the regular syllabus. / The remaining two periods of the day were divided among four /and teachers and my lessons with them were of a general/conversational nature. It was with these four.teachers that I experienced some difficulty. It was not possible for me to have them according to a regular roster because of other classes and I found the • . resulting lack of continuity rather a drawback to regular study with them. It frequently resulted in m$i having one teacher one day and then not seeing him or her again for two or three days. Furthermore, the scope of these lessons was not definitely defined but were, as I have previously stated, of a general conversational nature. I do not mean this to be an adverse criticism of the teaching arrangements or of the teachers. It was up to me to take full advantage of the facilities offer/ed and I endeavoured to do so. I found however that the Palestinian colloquial Arabic was so different to that of the Persian Gulf that I eventually abandoned my efforts at conversation and used my teachers for furthering my study of the classical. I alsoI also feel that my knowledge of Arabic vims assumed to be greater than it actually was, as indeed it perhaps should have been. However, in my opinion, the Newman Mission is an excellent institution and I feel that I have benefit/ted greatly by my short attendance there# I am inclined to think however that in view of the short time at my disposal, I should perhans have derived more benefit from the excellent facilities if I had gone there knowing a little more Arabic. I should very much like to attend a short course there again preparatory to taking the Interpretership Examination. 4. Apart from my study of Arabic I consider my visit to Jerusalem a value(fl/ e expetience. Not only did I meet many interesting people at the Mission many of whom imparted their profound knowledge of Arabic culture and learning through the medium of lectures, but I also met various officials and private individuals of local standing (both Jew and Arab) from whom I acquired a fair knowledge of the current administration^ and political problems and also a general knowledge of Middle East affairs#CONFIDENTIAL.

JERUSALEM. 22nd February 1946. My dear Sir Geoffrey, One of my fellows here, Captain T.A.D.W. Hillyard has put in an application for entry to the (a) Indian Political Service (b) Indian Civil Service. He has served with Indian troops during the War and liked them. Incidentally he got an M.B.E. (Military) while serving with them. He is a very good type. I enclose his particulars and I think it might interest you to have a look at him. An opportunity should present itself in April and May if you would be good enough to write or telegraph me indicating your approval. It is the practice of the Centre to break our academic studies in the third term for a period of 6 weeks (’vac’) for the purpose of dispersing officers to various of the Arabic speaking countries in order to devote themselves to the colloquial and to acquire a brief acquaintance with some aspect of practical affairs. For purposes of rations they are att- ched to a military unit in the locality (in this sense they are limited to areas under the Middle East Command where military detachments exist) but their programmes are undertaken by various political authorities. Last year our Embassy in Baghdad, our Legation in Syria and our Political Heads in the Sudan and in Cyrenacia very kindly co-operated and will I think in view of Hillyard’s ambition it would be most satisfactory if he could come and spend his break, 23rd April - 30th May, in the* Persian Gulf, and he would like to do so and to be seen by you. Transport from here to Basra and return would be a military charge, and he would as I say be entitled to draw free rations at a destination where a British Army detachment is to be found. I presume in the Persian Gulf this would be Bahrain. As he is not entitled to travelling or any other allowances during the break and as my Foreign Office budget does not provide for any other expenses incurred in connection* with students, would you be so good as to consider, in case you may be interested in Hillyard, whether it would be possible for you to provide transport facilities from Basra to Bushire and Bahrain and return to Basra, and offer him official hospitality for a day or two in Bushire, or alternatively at such other place in the Persian Gulf where it might be more cpnvenient for you to see him at the time, in,the event of there being no British military detachment at such place. Where a military unit exists and I arrange his attachment in good time there will be no difficulty, so if you will be good enough to mention in your reply the name of a unit under Middle East Command represented in the Persian Gulf and its location. * /Hillyard has a good brain, has a serious mind and is a hard worker.
