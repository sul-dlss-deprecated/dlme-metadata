A member of the Akhwan, whom I was able to do a good turn at Jishah, and who visited me after dark at least five times. He was my best informant. (b) Nature of the Movement. —Generally speaking from what I saw and heard, one thing appears certain. Akhwanism is not the entirely bad movement it is made out to be. It seems to be a genuine religious revival, an attempt on the part of the masses of Central Arabia to improve themselves religiously and mentally, and especially is it an attempt to purify Islam of all the many evils which contact with so called European influence has brought in its train. However that may be touching the actual ideas and ambitions of men like Bin Sa'ud, it is certain that the masses are genuinely stirred by a very intense enthusiasm and desire to live better lives. The Akhwan consist principally of the ignorant classes, and the movement may be said to include all the Beduin (Badiyah) tribes of Najd and adjacent countries. The more educated classes, such as townsmen and merchants, are nearly all orthodox Wahhabis, and though these do not approve of some of the tenets of the Akhwan, more especially their, earlier intolerance, they consider the movement God-given, and an infinitely preferable state of affairs to the beast-like ignorance and idolatry which existed among the Beduin previouslv. It is true that the original movement took the most fanatical form, but under »the Imam Bin Sa'ud's firm and tactful guidance it has lost most ot its unreasonable bigotry and its members now devote themselves to self improvement and prayer, where before their only thought was forcible conversion and interference with others. It is on record that when the Akhwan first appeared in the streets of Hufuf, the capital of Hasa, they set upon and beat any women they found in the streets and shot in cold blood many a citizen, whose only crime was that he was seen smoking cigarettes. At that time Bin Sa'ud and Bin Juluwi, the Amir of Hasa, had summarily to shoot several of the Akhwan belbre they could bring them to their senses. Things, however, are vastly changed now, and both Bin Saud and his lieutenants have the movement well in hand. The only possible way in which the movement could break out again and get out of control would be tor some deep and universal resentment of a religious nature to take place. At the present momen sue 10 1428 100 5.20 F.O.P. [3107]exists, in the form of Najdis not being allowed to so to Mecca. Government would do well not to neglect the storm clouds winch are gathering. I his is the only anxiety Bin Sa'ud has at the present moment in his dealings with the Akhwan. Be is anxious about the future, and his repeated requests to me to warn His Majesty s Government about the high feeling that was running throughout iNajd was a sufficient indication ot Bin Sa'ud's state of mind. Finally, in a general sense, Akhwanism may be said to be a revival of Wahhahism. It is, however, in no sense a heresy, but an ascetic movement amono- Moslems to revive the Salifi school of Sunniism, as taught by the Imam Ahmad At the present moment, as I mentioned above, it may be said to have chiefly attected the Beduin of Central Arabia, as opposed to the more educated townspeople. Bin Sa'ud himself is at the head of the movement, and on one occasion, when 1 askeo. about the Akhwan, he said, 'T am the Akhwan.' Bin Sa'ud himself told me that the Akhwan were practically the same as the Wahhabis. lo-day ^\Vahhal)ism-cum- Akhwanism was the purest of all religions in the world, said Bin Sand, its membeis were to be found all over Central Arabia ' According to Bin Sa ud, the attack on the Wahhabis by Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian, in 1817, by order of the Sultan, was not so much because the religion of Najd offended as that a personal insult had been offered to the Sultanah of Turkey by the Amir of Najd, who ordered her caravan to turn back from Madina. At the time, however, it was considered by lurkey to be a political move to make out that Wahhabism was a menace to orthodox Islam. As we know, the result of Ibrahim Pasha's campaign in Najd in 1817 was the destruction of Dharaiyah. the capital, and the carrying off of the Amir Abdullah ibn-Sa ud to Egypt. This crushed VV ahhabism for a tirre and rendered Najd innocuous as a menace to orthodox Islam, as the Sultan knew it. ahhabism, however, has existed throughout Najd and in parts of Oman, Trucial Coast, Hasa and elsewhere, ever since, though not in a militant form. II. A Short History of Akhwanism. (1) The actual date of the new revival under the name of Akhwan is difficult to determine. Certain it is that up to five years ago the term ' Akhwan ' was practically unknown. It is also certain that the few members of the sect, though existing in the township of Artawiyah, always a fanatical spot, played no part in the recovery of Najd by 'Abdul 'Aziz, the present Imam, in 190-. It was only after 1913 when Bin Sa'ud, the present ruler, recovered Hasa from the Turks that the movement first came under his notice. In 1914-15 the term came into general use, and began to spread to an alarming extent. It was then that Bin Sa'ud decided to turn his attention to Akhwanism as a means of strengthening and consolidating his power over the many disruptive elements which he had to contend with in Najd and his new dominions generally. To-day the principal religious leader of the Akhwanism is Shaikh 'Abdul Karim-al-Mughrabi. This individual was, at one time, Chief 'Alim to the late Palih Pasha A1 Sa'dun, Shaikh of the Muntafiq. -He later became 'Alim to Miz'al Pasha, father of the present Ibrahim Beg A1 Sa'dun. He left the latter's service, however, and departed to Najd, where he ensconced himself as 'Alim in the town of Artavviyah, a small nest of Wahhabism. There is a story that in the year 1899, when Miz'al Pasha went to Mecca, he returned via Najd, and on his way visited Artawiyah. In place of a welcome, as he expected from his old friend, Abdul Karim, the latter rudely drove him away, cursing him for a u Kafir' and a ' Mushrik.' Among other Akhwan religious leaders we have Ibn 'Abdul Latif, Qadhi of Riyadh and Shaikh 'Tsa, Qadhi of Hasa. (2) That the present Ruler of Najd, Bin Sa'ud, has been forced to associate himself with the movement and became its leader, I think, there is little doubt. In my opinion he, in the first place, thought to make use of the movement to strengthen his position, but in the end found he was forced to spread its doctrines and become its leader lest he should go under himself. It would appear that in about 1915 or 1916 Bin Sa'ud found that Akhwanism was definitely getting control of affairs in Najd. He saw he had to decide between being a temporal ruler and crushing Akhwanism or becoming the leader of a new kind of Wahhabism. He decided on the latter course as being the less risky. Having once taken them up he saw that it was vital to get the members of the new cult under proper control. There was a danger of their running ' amuck' both in the direction of Hijaz and 'Iraq. He issued his famous order in 1916 that all Beduins of Najd and Arabia must join the movement and must pay him 'Zikat' as their recognised leader. This led to much fighting, and was incidently one of the reasons leading up to the 'Ajman tribes resisting him in Hasa in 1915. It may be saidthat Bin Sa'ud during lOlK—17-iq _i • ^calcitrant tribesmen,' and ra'relv was'hffbt to SerieS of wars ^ earn a well deserved rest. In 1918 Bin Sa'ud had I kl yaflh during this time and Najd (except the'Aiman) to adorn i trendy forced all the Beduin of order '0 en^re the^UXs behavi- t^ l' and r 0gniSe him aS theil ' In Sa'ud got his religions leaders t^ la^ue a ^ t re ;' a ' n ' 1 g his control Bin SgiJjSjfyt: tr r d ,i ''' w cars S. A S:'; trr ii &gt;• ■«&lt;. • —w •-•I'— iw luLjrsJz saMs ' 1 r- r 1 ? 1 SP elf a ' Hadhar .' or town-dweller, as opposed to the term jahd (ignorant one). The skill with which the tribes have been forced into the no\ement and compelled to settle down and plough without leeling resentment at the -hange shows Bin baud to be no ordinary leader. He has given the wandering tribes whll^ he'has'le rfh SO ^ s P ea1 ^ a . nd has definitely made them 'settled' tribesmen, while he has left the system snfiiciently elastic to allow of portions of each tribe to remain throughout the year in the desert tending their camels and looking after the breeding of same. 1 he selection of the site of each new town is made 'entirely by in ba ud himself, and m accordance with whether the tribe is a difficult one to manage or otherwise he places them near or far from Riyadh, his capital. Incidentally the reason why the Ajman tribe has been so long in coming in is because of their knowledge of Bin bauds determination to 'bring them to heel' thoroughly and in a fashion all iiis own. 1 his is to take more or less the following form, and to one who knows the Beduin is a really harsh punishment: the Ajman are to he transferred to Najd as a whole, and are there to be broken up, each of the twenty different sections of the tribe being split up among the difierent new townships of the Akhwan. In this manner their power for doing evil will be broken. Bin Sa'ud tells me himself that they twice pla} ed the traitor to him—once in the fight with Bin Rashid near Majma' in March 1915, and once again in 1916, when they attacked and nearly overcame him in Hasa. Since then they have been successfully playing fast and loose with him, sometimes living in Kuwait territory and sometimes in British. J hey are now near Zubair, and have practically come to terms with Bin Sa'ud. As a matter of fact, from subsequent conversation I have had with Bin Sa'ud, I rather gather he is prepared to mitigate the punishment outlined above. He realises that he could perhaps carry severity too far. To go back to the growth of the movement, the methods of Bin Sa'ud would seem to have been something as follows with a tribe that was not of itself anxious to become Akhwan. He would send for the Shaikh and tell him in blunt terms that his tribe had no religion and that they were all ' Juhl.' He next would order the Shaikh to attend the local school of 'Ulama, which was attached to the great mosque in Riyadh, and there undergo a course of instruction in religion. At the same time half a dozen'Ulama, attended by some genuinely fanatical Akhwan. such as A1 Duwaish, the Shaikh of the Mutair, were sent off to the tribe itself. These held daily classes teaching the people all about Islam in its original simplicity. Much enthusiasm was then aroused in the tribe, and the teachers were careful ' to appeal to ' the sleeping fanaticism inherent among all simple and serious savage men. The teachers insisted on all new converts wearing a white turban over their head-dress, and, among other things, they filled the new converts with wonderful ideas regarding the ' Imam.' To them he is their father, spiritual leader, and shaikh, all in one. Those who joined the new movement (tadaiyanu) were told they were now members of the tlew brotherhood, and so the name ' Akhwan arose. These 'Ulama are, of course, very carefully selected by the Imam for loyalty to himself before everything. . ^ . . r . When the Shaikh of the tribe was supposed to have received suthcient religious instruction,, he was invited to build a house in Riyadh and remain in attendance on the Imam. This again was part of the control scheme. Should Bin ba ud to-day desire to mobilize his Akhwan forces, he merely gives the word to this bodyguard of Shaikhs and the country side is in a flame inside 50 hours. (3) Frailer —Much importance is attached to this, and it is part of the Akhwan creed that men should pray together. The result is remarkable. At the call to prayer,on all sides you hear men shouting out ' Arise, you lazy ones, get up ^ pray A group is then f6rmed and a leader appointed, and prayers are said in regular military style If there are a large number of men, such as 100 or more, the sight is quite impressive. I myself have seen Bin Sa'uds bodyguard of 500 Akhwan saying prayers, and was greatly struck with the military precision of their movements. Added to this, the lierce, fanatical abandon of the leader of the prayers made one realise the danger of the force behind the movement. III. Beliefs. (1) An akh (brother) puts before everything else, two things : (a) Worship ot One God. (h) Brotherhood among all true believers. ........ r n j z- Under (a) actual articles of faith required of him: ^1) Indivlsiuility 01 God (to say there is no god but G#d). (2) Zikat, giving of. (3) Fasting, Al-Ramadhan. (4) Charity to poor. (5) Haj, Mecca. ___ , . .. Under (6) actual articles of faith required of him: (1) Worship of country, (2) Implicit obedience to Imam. (3) Help his brother Akhwan, whether in financial ditiiculty or otherwise. (2) A man should always say God is God and Muhammad his prophet, but it is forbidden to think of or use the name of Muhammad as an interceder with God. God is all that mat ters ; Muhammad is only a man who gave out God s word. He is dead and gone and has no further significance, except of course that his name shopld be spoken with reverence and his memory kept alive out of gratitude. (3) Zikafc requires every subject to give annually one in ten of all he possesses to the Imam. The latter distributes money so collected among the poor and needy as he thinks fit. This is not to be confused with the paying of revenue, though the Beduin like to confuse the two. (4) To couple any other name with God in prayer is an abominable sin, such^ for instance, as the names of Husain, Hasan, &amp;c. To do this is to be a ' mushrik. Such a person is a kafir, and his possessions, life, women, &amp;c., are ' halal.' Shi'ahs come under this category. . (5) The offering of vows, ' Nadhr, 1 ' as commonly practised amon^ Shi'ahs and some Sunn is, is a deadly sin. (6) The erection of tombs or monuments over the graves of the dead is a sin. Hence the Akhwan's duty is always to destroy such if found. (7) Smoking tobacco is a deadly sin, as also the smoking of ha,shish, opium, &amp;c. If he sees a man smoking, an akh will assault and probably kill him. Throughout Bin Sa'ud's kingdom smoking is strictly forbidden. (Exception : Hasa, where people may smoke in private.) (8) The drinking of alcohol is forbidden, and is treated in same way as in (7). (9) If an akh is in debt, he has only to go to his companions and inform them. These will pass the hat round, collect the necessary money, and pay the debt off at once. IV. Other Customs, Observances and Beliefs among Akhwan. (а) The belief is held that the present is the period immediately preceding the second coining of Christ. (б) Houses must be of only one storey. (c) Simplicity ot living and dress is to be enforced. (Most Akhwan present a most ragged appearance.) (d) A white turban is to be worn instead of the Aqal as a sign manifest that you are a brother. The Imam has since issued orders that this is not necessary, but the custom continues among all the newly-converted Akhwan. All the Imam's followers whom I saw recently in Hasa wore the wtiite turban. The Imam himself and his bodyguard of negroes wore the 'Aqal, as also did the garrison ('Askar) of Hasa, though these admitted to me, when questioned, that they were all good Akhwan. (e) Salaams are not returned except to another akh. This was very marked in Hasa. My Sunni Moslem companions from Bahrain regularly salaamed to any Akhwan they met in the streets, but only once did I notice the answer ' alaikum al salam ' given. Usually the salutation was utterly ignored. (/) If a Kafir or Mushrik meet a group of Akhwan in the streets, the latter cover their faces with both hands, rather than be pointed by sight. This was done to me on scores of occasions in Hufuf, and even inside the Imam's own house and by members ofhis own bodvffirird T -f ttt j i Iniam ^ al ^ these at once left the roomln a body.' 6 '' a majl ' S m Which there were Akhwan present.

Bin Sa'ud tells me he neve? countenanced these acts at all from the first, but was unable to stop them till the end ot 1919. To-day all forcible conversion or spreading of the faith by the sword has ^h-tctP t IT abar ' doned k . Bm Sa'ud, I am told, about six months ago passed the stnctest orders on the subject In public majlis he explained that such acts would oily bring down the wrath of God and of friendly nations on to Najd. Bin Sa'ud nmself told me that.he had been compelled to execute several Akhwan for disobedience to las orders in this respect. The Akhwan, he said, were 90 per cent, better and more amenable to-day than they had been two years ago. Great strides were being made daily, and strong civihsmg elements were at work, which, he hoped, would entirely alter the character ot the people of Xajd in the next few years. Such a thine' as forcible conversion was not a thing to be surprised at from a nation who had suddenly found lehgion, so to speak. His people, said Bin Sa'ud, had the purest form of religion in the world to-day. ^ All that was the matter was that those whose hearts had been touched were some of the wildest and most ignorant of all human beings. Their new religion had to be given them gently and not all at once. Its purity would always remain the same, he hoped. It was natural, he thought, that men who had never before heard the simple teachings of the Quran should go off their heads to start with. Bin Sa ud assured me that so ignorant had the Beduin of Najd been in the past that until the new revival came 90 per cent, of them had never heard of religion, marriages had never been solemnised and circumcision had been unknown. V. System of Bin Sa'ud's Goverriment and its Connection with the Akhwan. (a) Administration. —Bin Sa'ud's dominions were divided up into provinces, over each he had appointed a Hakim (Amir) whose duties were preservation of order and collection of Zikat. Every town in the province was self governing, and had its own elected Amir also. The latter was responsible for law and order inside the town area. (b) Judicial.—Shari'ah Law was the only law that was recognised throughout Bin Sa'ud's territories now. Both Akhwan, Najdi and Hasawi were treated alike in the matter. Qadhis had been appointed in every big city, and the Amir of the province or cities, as the case might be, sent all cases for trial to the Qadhi. The latter passed sentences according to the strictest letter of the law, and the Amir saw such was carried out. As Sultan in Najd Bin Sa'ud could overrule the Shari'ah decisions, but only in his capacity as Sultan (Amr al Sultan nafidh). Mutilation was practised, if Shari'ah ordered it, and the place for execution was usually the public market. In Hufuf it was on Thursdays. The body of a decapitated criminal was allowed to remain twelve hours in the market square for people to see. [3107] C6 Tribal laws and customs, such as 'Dakhalah' (refuge), ' Fasal' (blood-money), &amp;c., were not recognised either by Bin Sa ud, his Qadlus, or lus Ainiis. (c) Military. —Bin Sa'ud kept up a small standing army of regularly paid soldiers. Each province had its garrison, and the chief strategical points were held by these men. The garrison of each province came under the direct orders of the Hakim. Ibn Juluwi in Hasa had 700 men to keep order with, distributed as under. Hufuf 500, Mubarraz 200. These so-called regulars are half mounted, half dismounted. ' Bin Sa nd's chief strength lay in his Akhwan (Badiyah) forces. These numbered 300,000 men, he reckoned. He could mobilise these in an incredibly short time if the war was a Jihad, such as it would be if it were against the Sharif. Rifle practice was regularly carried out under the eye of the Hakims of the provinces; also individuals were encouraged to hold private matches. Rifles in use among regular 'Askar were all of small-bore magazine type (Mauzer mostly). Ihe Badiyah possessed every type of rifle, though the majority had small -bore weapons. I saw many 30*3 Mauzer, Manlicher among them. (d) Revenue. —For the collection of Zikat and Miri from the settled popillation, the Governors of Hakims of the provinces were responsible. At present Bin Sa ud himself collected Zikat from the Akhwan, both those who dwelt in towns, and those out with camels. Bin Sa'ud allowed no one but himself to interfere in this matter as a matter of policy. He himself toured round all Akhwan settlements every three months, and kept himself in closest touch with their leaders. Bin Sa'ud told me his revenue did not at present cover his expenditure. He did not know what he would do if His Majesty's Government reduced his subsidy. He would be faced with lawlessness again, he thought. He was Improving his taxation and financial position fast, but it would be long before he could show a proper budget. His future hopes lay in the ports of Ojair and Jubail and customs accruing therefrom. He wished to discourage entirely goods coming from Hijaz as he got no benefit, but with two good ports of his own on the east coast and properly managed customs, he hoped t® make 40 lakhs of rupees annually. But this was not yet. A tribe that paid Zikat to Bin Sa'ud ipso facto could claim absolute protection from all its enemies. Hence the desire of many tribes in Oman, Trucial coast, Yaman, Shammar to pay the tax. It meant they were guaranteed from raids.
