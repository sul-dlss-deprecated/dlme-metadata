L 1809, Lord Mayo’s Government brought to the notice of Her Majesty’s Government the repeated encroachments of Persia, in the direction of the frontiers of Afghanistan, Seistau, Khelat, and Mekran, with the view, if possible, to the com- mencement of negotiations, through Her Majesty’s Minister lor Foreign Affairs, to place matters on a more sound and satisfactory footing than heretofore, - ^ P ut a “ end t0 the irritating contention! dariesf lr ° m ^ uncertain and ^ill-defined boun Office, who proposed tC defer any actffin in th matter till the arrival in this country of Mr. Alisor Her Majesty s Minister at Teheran, who was short! “X Jj6ClGC1 # Meanwhile the Government of India again drev attention to the subject, stating that “ politics &lt; ifficulties might at any time arise, owing to the • claims advanced and the attitude assumed ),’ « i ers, t’ l' r j ,s P ect °f her territorial rights aloni the whole of her Eastern Frontier, as regards tin « i’, rov ' nce °t Seiran and the tract bordering oi , th .?

It is hardly necessary for the purposes of this Memorandum to summarize the correspondence which thereupon passed. It will suffice to say that the matter remained dormant till early in 1870, when Lord Clarendon, then Secretary of State for rorejgn Affairs, caused a letter to be sent to the India Office, stating that the Persian Minister at nis Court had informed him that instructions had beui xeceived from the Shah’s Government to 16391. aJUhi'aitifiWi^4i^iiMiTfflnTTrroff |l rrw”T , ^n7nrsRyTi [ - 1 j ? 1 1 j f'' 9 1 1 ' || '' ^|, '' | ,t 1111 1 2 represent their apprehension that Shere Ali, of Caubul, was about to re-assert Afghan claims over . Seistan, whereas a Persian Government was already established in that province. The Minister accord ingly requested that the Indian Government might be desired to use its influence with Shere Ali to prevent him carrying his supposed intentions into effect. The Foreign Office letter proceeds thus,— “ The Duke of Argyll will judge what should he “ said to the Indian Government with reference to “ Mohsin Khan’s communication, and Lord Claren- “ don would be glad to receive any observations “ that may occur to His Grace to make upon it.” The Duke of Argyll replied, under date 21st February 1870, expressing his opinion as follows,— “ If the Government of the Shah of Persia is “ willing to submit the question referred to the “ arbitration of the British Government, in accord- “ ance with the terms of Article VI. of the Treaty “ of Paris, March 1857, his Grace will place him- “ self in communication with Lord Mayo, with “ reference to the expediency of obtaining from the “ Amir Shere Ali Khan his acquiescence in the “ proposed arrangement.” On receipt of this letter, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs instructed Mr. Thomson, Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Teheran, to submit the proposal for arbitration to the Persian Govern ment, and to recommend their concurrence in the same. This concurrence was given in the following words,—“ They (the Persian Government) are , “ willing to make Her Majesty’s Ministers arbiters “ in the matter of sovereignty and boundaries, “ &amp;c., &amp;c,” Thereupon the Duke of Argyll telegraphed to the Governor General of India as follows:— “ The Persian Government are willing to submit the question of Seistan sovereignty and boundary to British arbitration. Ascertain whether Caubul Ameer agrees to this. It is desirable that he should do so.” IVote.— The fact that the Treaty of Paris is the basis of the arbitration fixes the primary re sponsibility thereof on the Foreign Office, since that Treaty was concluded, not by the Indian, but by Her Majesty’s Government. Whilst this correspondence as to Seistan was being carried on, matters at Mekran became very unsettled, so much so, that Mr. Thomson, Her Majesty’s Charg6 d’Affaires at Teheran reported to Lord Clarendon, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that he believed that the Government of Persia would “ not be induced to adopt sufficiently “ stringent measures for restraining their agents “ on the frontier from all interference with the “ Khelat territory, unless a further represensation &lt;e be made to them by Her Majesty’s Government, “ giving them clearly to understand that, beyond Letter to Foreign Office, 21st Feb. 1870.

His Majesty’s exact words were, “ Respecting Khelat, the demarcation of boundaries “ between Persia, Beluchistan, and Khelat has not “ yewbeen clearly defined. If the British Govern- “ ment is desirous that the said line of frontier be “ traced, let Commissioners be sent by the three “ parties to the frontier, that is to say, by England, “ Persia, and Khelat, and let them settle the “ boundary line, otherwise, if the frontier be not “ defined, these difficulties will be daily recurring.” Mr. Thomson at this time wrote to Mirza Saeed Khan, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, that His Excellency might feel assured that Her Majesty’s Government would be prepared, in a friendly spirit, to assist in the arrangement of any difficulties which might have arisen between His Majesty the Shah and the Khan of Khelat. Note .—The Mekran portion of the arbitration absolutely emanated from the Shah of Persia in communication with Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Teheran, who, in his turn, com municated His Majesty’s wishes to the Secre tary of State for Foreign Affairs, as the authority primarily responsible for the settle ment of complications between Persia and our allied Eastern States. The Foreign Office forwarded, for the considera tion of the Secretary of State for India, the above- mentioned proposal made by the Shah for submitting the ca^e to arbitration. The Duke of Argyll re plied that, if Lord Clarendon concurred in the expediency of such an arrangement, His Grace “ would address Lord Mayo with respect to the “ selection of an officer to represent the British “ Government on this occasion.” Lord Clarendon’s reply was couched in the fol lowing terms,— “ His Lordship concurs in the expediency of carrying out the arrangement referred to in your letter of the 30th ultimo, with the view to the de finition of the line of frontier between Persia, Balu chistan, and Khelat, as it may have the effect ofkeeping things quiet on the frontier, for a time, at least, if not permanently.” The correspondence in regard to Seistan was being all this time simultaneously carried on. On 9th May 1870, the Duke of Argyll caused a letter to be addressed to the Foreign Office, as follows,— “ With reference to my letter of 28th ultimo, and to the telegraphic message to the Viceroy of 27th idem, and the reply of 29th, I am directed by the Duke of Argyll to state, for the information of Lord Clarendon, that, in His Grace’s opinion, it would be desirable to lose no time in making the neces sary arrangements for the proposed Seistan arbitra tion, the more especially as it appears, from the enclosures to your letter of 3rd May, and from Mr. Thomson, No. 23, of March 8th, that incursions across the Perso-Affghan border have been made from both sides, and it would seem that further hostilities are threatening. It appears to the Duke of Argyll that it w r ould be advisable to despatch an officer of rank and experience from this country, with instructions from Her Majesty’s Government; and, with the concurrence of Lord Clarendon, His Grace would request Colonel Goldsmid, who has a large experience on both sides of the frontier, and possesses a thorough knowledge of the Persian lan guage, and a personal acquaintance with the local authorities of both countries, to undertake this im portant mission. He should proceed by way of Teheran to the frontier, accompanied by the Persian Commissioner, there to meet the officer deputed by the Amir of Caubul for the same pnrpose of arbi tration.” Lord Clarendon concurred with the Duke of Argyll, that it was “ desirable that no time should “ be lost in making the necessary arrangements for “ the proposed Seistan arbitration.” His Lordship also approved of the “selection of Colonel Goldsmid to undertake that mission.” The Foreign Office letter continues,—“Colonel Goldsmid, Lord Cla- “ rendon.presumes, will be instructed to communi- “ cate unreservedly with Her Majesty’s Minister in “ Persia on all matters connected with this arbi- “ tration.” Turning again to Mekran, we find that, on 31st of the same month (May), the Foreign Office in quired “ what answer His Grace would wish to be “ returned to the proposal of the Shah, for the “ settlement by a mixed Commission of the Mekran “ frontier question.” Whereupon the Duke of Argyll replied that he “ entirely approved of the “ suggestion, and that he was of opinion that “ Colonel Goldsmid, either before or after the “ Seistan arbitration, as might be determined by “ Her Majesty’s Government, might advantageously “ be employed on this duty as British Commis- “ sioner.” Lord Clarendon agreed. The letter from the Foreign Office was as follows,—“ I am directed by Letter to Foreign Office, 9th May 1870. Letter from Foreign Office, 18th May 1870. Letter from Foreign Office, 31st May 1870.

The statement of Lord Clarendon that Colonel Goldsmid had been selected to act as “ Commissioner on the part of Great Britain ”f seems conclusively to prove that he did not merely represent the interests of India as apart from those of Great Britain. It was originally intended that Colonel Goldsmid should commence his investigations in Seistan; in consequence, however, of disturbances in Afghan istan, whereby it was rendered impracticable for the Amir to send his Commissioner, this plan was changed, and in 1870 he commenced the Mekran Arbitration. The British Commissioner was employed upon this duty for some months, returning to Teheran m July 1871, to discuss the results of his work and to effect, if possible, a settlement through * the medium of Her Majesty’s Minister. After a pro longed negotiation, in which the Shah himself took an .active part, a decisive note,}: defining the boun daries of the litigating States, was given in bv Mr. Alison, and accepted by the Persian Govern ment. Mr. Alison took this step under the autho rity of the Foreign Office, to whom he telegraphed as follows,—“ The following is the beginning of ‘ c the draft of my note for the settlement of the “ Persian-Kelat Frontier as accepted by the King “ undersigned, &amp;c., acting on the part of ‘ ‘ his Government has the honour to submit for &lt;c f the approval of the King, a map in which ’the “ £ boundary line between the territories possessed “ 4 in Beluehistan by Persia and the territories “ ‘ forming the exclusive property of the indepen- 16391. b6 &lt;c ‘ dent State of Kelat is delineated. This line,' « &amp;c. Shall 1 conclude ? This is sent to India,” The Foreign Office thereupon asked the India Office to state “ what reply should, in the Duke of « Argyll’s opinion, be given to the inquiry con- “ tained in Mr. Alison’s telegram.” His Grace, in reply, stated that, “ (assuming that the map con- 4&lt; taining the proposed definitions forwarded to the “ Foreign Office by Mr. Alison is the same as that “ submitted by Major-General Goldsmid) he “ approved of the proposed note to the Persian 44 Government.” Letter from Foreign Office, 28th Aug. 1871. Letter to Foreign Office, 30th Aug. 1870. Subsequently, when the modification of the Mekran Frontier was under consideration, Mr. Ali son sent a telegram to Lord Granville, as follows, — 44 In consequence of difficulty created by late 44 Minister for Foreign Affairs before leaving office, 44 Council of State have declined to recommend 44 the Shah to accept your Lordship’s amended 44 Note defining Perso-Khelat Frontier. Though 1 44 presume that no change can be made in your 44 Lordship’s decision, ’ &amp;c. Letter from • Foreign Office, 4th Feb. 1874. Note .—This clearly shows that Mr. Alison, at any rate according to his own idea, was acting as the representative of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, not of the Secretary of State for India. On the termination of the Mekran inquiry in August 1871, Colonel Goldsmid held himself in readiness to commence the Seistan matter. At this time a long correspondence took place between Mr. Alison, Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran, and the Persian Government, as to the exact terms ♦ on which the latter agreed to refer the case to arbitration. The precise words used by Mr. Alison in reporting the conclusion of these preliminary negotiations were as follows,— 44 After a lengthened discussion the King has Letters from India, accepted our arbitration in the following terms,— October to Decem- 4 When the British, Persian, and Afghan Commis- ber 18 ‘^ 385 ' 4 sioners are all assembled together in Seistan, the 4 Persian and the Afghan Commissioners respec- 4 tively will state and substantiate their claims. If 4 local inquiry be necessary, the Commissioners 4 will proceed to any point for that purpose, and 4 make a map of any districts without let or hin- 4 drance. When the British Commissioner con- 4 siders that there is nothing further to be done on 4 the spot, the Commissioners will then return to 4 Teheran, where the question wijl be fully discussed 4 with a view to its settlement, and the British 4 Commissioner will also state his arbitral opinion. 4 Should the Persian or Afghan Government not 4 agree to the arbitral opinion of the British Com- ‘ missioner, reference will then be made to Her 4 Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, ‘ who, taking into due consideration the arguments 4 put forth by Persia, will issue a final decision,Letter from Foreign Office, 28th Feb. 1873. * both the Persian and Afghan Governments bind- ‘ ing themselves beforehand to abide by the same, ‘ &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.’ Colonel Goldsmid, finding that the continued dis turbance in Afghanistan, as well as the hot season of the year, would not admit of his proceeding for a while with the arbitration in Seistan, came to England with his Staff, starting thence in November of the same year to commence the duties assigned to him. The history of the Seistan arbitration need not here be recapitulated. It is sufficient to state that, as in the Mekran, so in the Seistan arbitration, the final decision was given by Lord Granville, Secre tary ol State for Foreign Affairs, who communi cated to the Persian Minister in this country his intentions in the following words:—“ I informed “ him (the Persian Minister) that I had carefully “ considered the papers, and that I had been in “ communication with the India Office, the Indian “ Government, and my colleagues on the subject, “ and that Her Majesty’s Government had come “ to the conclusion that I should agree in the “ decision which Sir F. Goldsmid has already “ given.” Note .—Such language is irreconcilcable with the supposition put forward by the Foreign Office that the Commission was not only originated by, but continued under, the direction of the India Office. Page 657, Home Correspondence, vol. 42. Page 724e, Home Correspondence, May to December 1870. As touching the general aspect of the question, it would appear that the settlement of the boun daries between Persia and Afghanistan was a matter of Imperial policy, essentially affecting our general relations with Persia and our policy in the East. Had the circumstances connected with the non settlement of the boundaries brought on any out break of war between Persia and England, as was the direct result in 1857 of the same spirit of ag gression on the side of Persia, the payment of the expenses of the war would have, as on that occa sion, been shared between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers. In regard to the important matter now submitted to the Secretary of State connected with the mone tary arrangements of Sir F. Goldsmid’s Mission, Sir J. Kaye placed before the Duke of Argyll a memorandum dated 12th August 1870, from which the following is an extract,— “ With reference to the mission of Colonel Goldsmid, C.B., of the Madras Staff Corps, to Seistan, for the purpose of preventing hostilities between Persia and Afghanistan, it is suggested that the salary of this Officer should be fixed at Rs. 3,000 per mensem, &amp;c. * * * * I have had communication with the Foreign Office on the subject of the expenditure, and I have every 16391. CMBBBBBHHBBBBBWi I 8 • reason to believe that, when called upon, they will be prepared to recommend the Treasury to share the expenses, but, as it is highly important that there should be no delay in the despatch of the mission, it is submitted that the India Office, in the first instance, should take the disbursements on itself, and trust to the result of future correspond ence for an equitable adjustment between the two Treasuries.” On the 25th August, the authority of the Secre tary of State in Council was obtained in the fol lowing terms ,— i( Agreed to in Secret Council, on “ the understanding that the Imperial 1 reasury “ will share the expenses of the mission with the “Indian Government.” Sir J. Kaye’s account of what subsequently occurred is contained in the fol lowing memorandum, dated 24th September 1874, drawn up at the request of Sir Louis Mallet,— “ I cannot charge myself with any exact recol lection of the date upon which the conference of which I am asked to speak with Mr. Hammond took place on the subject of the Seistan arbitra tion. But the Duke of Argyll requested me to go over to the Foreign Office, and to discuss it with Mr. Hammond, with especial reference to the sub ject of the partition of the expenses between the Imperial and the Indian Exchequers. “ Mr. Hammond and I discussed the whole ques tion of the Seistan arbitration at considerable length. We Both of us agreed that the settlement of the boundaries between Persia and Afghanistan was a matter affecting both the Imperial and the Indian Governments, inasmuch as that, if a war had arisen between Persia and Afghanistan with respect to those boundaries, and that, therefore, any European intervention had become necessary, that intervention would have been doubtless a ques- ; jtion both for India and the Empire to settle, and ^ j j that, therefore, the cost of such settlement would have fallen jointly on the two Exchequers. Whilst Mr. Hammond, on the part of the Foreign Office, entirely concurred in this view of the question, he observed that, with regard to the supplementary arbitration, which General Goldsmid was concerned with, with retereuce to the settlement of the boun dary between Persia and Beloochistan, it was a matter which took a different complexion, and that that arbitration was an Indian question, and that phe did not think that the Imperial Exchequer V should be called upon to take any part in the expenses thereof. “ I did not demur to this view of the question, and so the matter ended, and I have the fullest possible belief that Mr. Hammond’s recollection will concur with my own, and that he will endorse what I have here written.” Page 724e, Home Correspondence, May to December 1870. Meanwhile Sir F. Goldsmid finished his labours, and presented his accounts. These were duly ex amined by the Auditor, after which a letter wasLetter to Foreign Office, 22nd June 1874. Note .—A reminder was sent to the Foreign Office on 7th Oct. 1874. Letter from India Office, 10th Nov. 1874. addressed to the foreign Office in the following terms:— “ With reference to the recent mission in charge of Sir F. Goldsmid, under the orders of the Foreign and India Offices, for the settlement of the Perso- Seistan and Mekran boundaries, I am directed by the Marquis of Salisbury to state, that the accounts, so far as at present adjusted, show an expenditure, on the above behalf of 39,880/. 17s. Zd. I have accordingly to request that you will cause the half of that sum to be paid into the Treasury of this Office. “ I am to add, that there will probably be a fur ther sum of about 10,000/. to be paid by the Impe rial Treasury, being half the amount advanced in India on the same account. As, however, full par ticulars of the expenditure have not yet reached this Office, the adjustment of this latter sum must, for the present, be deferred.” The reply from the Foreign Office is quoted in full as follows :— “ Lord Derby has been in communication with the Lords of the Treasury with regard to the claim put forward in your letter of 22nd of June, to be repaid from the Imperial Exchequer, a moiety of the expenses incurred by Sir Frederic Goldsmid, under the orders of the Imperial Government, in the settlement of the Perso-Seistan and Mekran boundaries; and I am directed by his Lordship to state to you, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, that, as the Foreign Office has not incurred any obligation to defray any portion of the expenses of this Commission, which, as more directly concerning India, was ori ginated by and continued under the directions of the India Office, Lord Derby regrets that he would not feel justified in consenting to charge any part of the expenditure in question to Imperial revenues.” It only remains to state, that, although the Seistan and Mekran Missions were, by force of circumstances, as already shown, so far 'distinct as to be divided into two periods of duty, yet the negotiations entrusted to Sir F. Goldsmid were in tended originally to have been carried on in one unbroken series, and the policy involved—viz., the prevention of Persian encroachment eastwards— applies equally to both branches of the arbitration. On this understanding, in the accounts forwarded from India as well as those prepared in this country the whole of the payments were mixed up together, and it would be difficult, if not impossible, now to divide them. The questions, then, remaining for decision would appear to be— (1.) Whether this Office is to attempt a division of the charges, and, in view of the apparent verbal understanding arrived at between Sir J. Kaye and Mr. Hammond, modify the application to the Fo reign Office, so far as to ask them for half theSeistan expenses only, or, (2), renew our applica tion for half the entire expenses, should it he con sidered that this Memorandum has made out a sufficiently strong case for pressing such a claim. A draft Despatch to Foreign Office will be sub mitted for sanction, as soon as the Secretary of State, after being placed in possession of the views of the Political and Finance Commissioners, to whom his Lordship has referred the case, shall issue his instructions thereon. Note. It is necessary to remark, that the total sum involved in this question ol the Peiso- Seistan-Khelat Mission is about 60,000/., which has been advanced by the Indian treasury. The sum, therefore, involved in this corre spondence, as the Foreign Office share, is hall that amount, viz., 30,000/.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000cf_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/C83</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000cf</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/C83</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Memorandum on the Special Mission to Seistan and Mekran.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1874/1874</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-07-16T21:59:31</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (5 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at f 118, and terminates at f 122, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
