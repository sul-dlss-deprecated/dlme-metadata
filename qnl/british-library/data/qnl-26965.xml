Statistics. Attached to this report are figures showing Imports into and Ex- poita from Persia via Zahidan for the period 1st to 31st May 1933. 2. General. Indian traders at Zahidan have done practically no trade and have confined themselves to gambling on the exchange as a result of which the majority have suffered losses. 3.

The season being advanced quantities available are small and in spite of fall of exchange prices have been main tained. Tea. —With effect from 23rd June the import of tea in chests has been forbidden. Only small packets in cartons or tins bear ing the name of the seller and importer will be permitted. Each packet will have to bear a customs seal and the scheme is no doubt derived to increase customs charges. Tyres. —A representative of the Dunlop Rubber Company visited Zahidan and Meshed but appears to have met with little success. The company’s tyres have a poor reputation in Persia. Those sup plied a few years ago, gave very bad service and it will be a long time before a reputa tion can be regained. Carpets. —Bir j and extremely dull. market reported Average freight rates.

His Britannic Majesty s Consulate, Sistan and Kain, Commercial Report, for the £ month of February, 1933. il; 1. General .—There is no change to report in conditions, except that the raising of the embargo on import of sugar via Zahidan is likely to increase trade in that commodity shortly. 2. Imports via Zahidan .—Chief items during the month are :— Tea 1,345 Cases weighing 3,390 Indian maunds. Piece-goods.. 280 Bales „ 871 Yam Indigo Turmeric .. Black Pepper Lamp Globes Loaf Sugar 3. Tea.- 90 Bundles 50 Cases 30 Bags 25 „ 60 Cases 547 Bags 488 124 61 60 72 838 -Prices have fallen in India and import has been stimulated. 4. Sugar. —A large quantity of sugar was expected at Zahidan, but available supplies at Karachi were small. Orders for a considerable quantity have been placed in India. Local rates have not fluctuated as all import was for the interior of Persia. 5. Exports via Zahidan. —Approximate exports during February were :— Almonds Almonds ; Shelled Clarified Butter Raisins Loin Cloths and Silk Saffron Assafoetida . 1,200 Bags. . 1,000 Bags. . 900 Tins. . 2,000 Cases. . 1,500 Parcels. . 50 Parcels. . 200 Indian maunds. 6.

Shortage of coins at Zabul. —In an effort to curtail smuggling the National Bank at Zabul has entirely ceased to issue coin, as it was finding its way out of the country in exchange for goods smuggled from Afghanistan. The shortage of coin is so acute that petty trade is entirely crippled as the five Rial note is the smallest available, and shopkeepers have no change, they decline to sell any quantity of goods of less than 6 Rials value. Market produce brought by villagers can scarcely be disposed of, and as no regular bakers exist, but bread for the poorer classes is habitually made in small quantities in houses and sold in the street, by itinerant vendors, this also can only be ootained to the value of Krans 5 at a time in much too great a quantity for the average small purchaser. In consequence bread is not baked in sufficient quantities and travellers, daily wage earners and others experience con siderable hardship. That this absurd measure will seriously hinder smuggling nobody expects—coin will be brought from the interior to finance smuggling. 10. Indian traders were sent for by the Governor and asked if they would under take a contract to retail sugar on behalf of the Government. As the offer was clearly only made because all Persians had declined—since no sales could com pete with smuggled sugar—they wisely declined. The Governor having done his duty continues to buy smuggled sugar for his personal use, as do all the inhabitants. C. K. DALY, Major, C.I.E., His Majesty's Consul, Sistan and Kain.

Statistics. —Attached to this Report are statements shewing :—■' (A) Imports via Zahidan from December 1st, 1932 to March 20th, 1933 (End of the Persian year . (B) Exports via Zahidan from December 1st, 1932 to March 20th, 1933 (End of the Persian year). (C) A comparative statements shewing chief commodities importedf rom British Empire sources and from foreign countries, covering the same period as A and B. 2. Taxation. —A tax amounting to Rials 2 cents 95 per Batman has been placed on sugar imported via Zahidan. This tax is known as the ‘ Railway Expenses Tax ’ and appears to be charged with the object of creating a fund with which to meet some of the expenses of the railway, should the line to Zahidan be reopened. The Director of Customs at Zahidan has issued a notice to traders calling on them to produce the original invoices for goods cleared from the customs in the Persian year 1309. Failing this he threatens to recover the maximum duty. This action in respect of goods cleared so long ago, and which have probably since been sold, seems contrary to all justice. 3. Sugar. —The Government has pur chased a large stock of sugar in Belgium. Two hundred tons is expected to arrive during April and 400 tons in May. The Garage of a British Indian firm has been rented for storage. The price at which the sugar will be sold to retailers has not yet been fixed. It is highly probable that this new venture will prove expensive to the Govern ment. If they are to compete with smuggled sugar in the market, it will not be possible to recover the normal taxes-customs and monopoly, etc.—and there will inevitably be considerable losses due to pilfering, etc. 3. The average wholesale rate of tea has advanced in India from five to seven annas per lb. Traders state that they have advice from their Indian Agents that the Government of India have placed an embargo on the export of tea to Persia for two months. As the Zahidan market is already over-stocked no inconvenience should be felt, if this information should prove correct. MC109FD 4. Petrol and Kerosine .— 31,000 tins of A. P. 0. C. Petrol and Kerosine have arrived at Nok Kundi and are being transported to Zahidan. The sales of oil by the Russian agent at Zahidan are negligible. 5. Principal Imports via Zahidan in March.

Vernacular papers here fore shadowed a 50 per cent, increase in duty on goods imported to India from Japan, and also a warning from Japan that if such increase materialises imports oi cotton from India will ceise. Exports from Persia to Japan appear to be in this connection. Smuggling still continues but has slightly 'decreased in volume. Mr. L.

(c) Statements of the value of Imports of British Empire origin and those from Foreign sources during April and May 1932. 2. Goods passed through the Karachi Customs House in transit to East Persia during the month of May were valued at Rs. 1,26,099 as compared with Rs. 1,10,471 in the corresponding month of 1931. Of these totals the bulk of the Imports in 1931 were Sugar Rs. 12,958, Motor-parts Rs. 47,642 and Oils Rs. 25,000 whereas in 1932 Cotton Piece Goods amounted to a total of Rs. 1,00,251. 3. Imports—May. —-As a result of the Monopoly the Import of Sugar has entirely ceased. Cotton Piece Goods are, however, being imported in greater quantity, as also Cotton thread, the latter as a result of the improvement in recent months in the carpet weaving industry. ! 4. Exports—May.—The export of cereals from the Sistan area continues steady, but at the end of the month of June about 3,000 bags of wheat each of 2 Indian maunds (160 lbs.') was lying in the Customs unex ported owing to the high rates for trans port of this commodity to railhead. The seasonal export of nuts continued and this commodity together with carpets and Meshed silk formed the bulk of the exports, since these can be disposed of by merchants without undue loss and enables them to thereby qualify for permits to Import under the Monopoly of Trade Law. 5. Trade in June .—Both Imports and Exports decreased in June. T he decrease m the former, especially of Petrol and Kerosme oil for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, has ENCLOSURE IN SECnFEAPY 1 ( brought about a drop in motor freight rates from NOK-KUNDI to ZAHIDAN. As a result rates in the reverse direction have risen in order to balance loss on the round trip. This has re-acted unfavourably on exports since certain commodities, notably wheat and poppy-seeds, both of which are largely exported at this season, cannot bear high transport charges. The following were the average wholesale rates for the principal exports :— Almonds—shelled .. Almonds—in shell .. Raisins .. Poppy-seeds Pistachio nuts Silk (Loin-cloths) ..

Commercial report from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, for the month of May 1932. 1. Statistics .—Statistics for April have not yet been received from the Railway Department. 2. Zahidan Customs. Confidential. —Bu siness at Zahidan is disturbed owing to the prolonged enquiry into Customs abuses. Up till the end of May the following goods imported by Arbab Mehdi on which Customs duty had not been paid, have been traced by the Inspectors. Three boxes of drugs. 18 boxes of miscellaneous goods.. 1,415 cases of tea. 1,003 bags of sugar. 195 bundles of twist. The Customs duty which should have been recovered on the above amounts to no less than 1,400,000 Rials. It is rumoured in Zahidan that the Minister of Court has pro posed to the Majliss that merchants found guilty of smuggling should not be impri soned but allowed to continue trade and to pay off the arrears of Customs by instal ments. The local Governor is credited with the intention of reporting lhat irre gularities cannot be stopped unless the res trictions of the Monopoly Law be relaxed and Customs duty reduced to a more rea sonable figure. All goods passed by the Customs at Meshed for export are in future to be re examined at Zahidan. Silver Krans are being smuggled out of the country in large quantities. The local officials appear to be quite unable to deal with the situation. The long land frontier is almost impossible to guard. In spite of very high freight rates paid to Baluchi camelmen to smuggle silver coins over the frontier, it is estimated that a profit of not less than 40% results from this export. 3. C urrency and’ Exchange- — The new Rial nJotes are : ngf la^: and every effort \ INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S 9 1 IS made to draw silver from the banks. Brices of^ goods paid for in notes is 5% or more in excess of payments in silver. The Imperial Bank of Persia, Zahidan have instructions to accept Zahidan notes only, while the National Bank accepts notes on any branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia. The banks endeavour to reserve their stock of silver, since they anticipate heavy payments to redeem notes in the near future. Rs. Bank Rate Rials 734 .. .. 100 Bazaar Rate Rials 740 .. poo 4.

His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain presents liis compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla, and has the honour to transmit the undermentioned documents :— Sistan Commercial Diary for the month of April 1932. Commercial Report from His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate, Sistan and Kain for the month of April 1932. 1. Correction. —In the report for March 1932 paragraph 1 read (c) ‘ In February ’ for ‘ In January 1932 2. Attached to this report are statis tics showing :— (а) Imports into Persia via Nokkundi during March 1932. (б) Exports via Nokkundi during March 1932. (c) A statement of the value of Im ports of British Empire origin and those from Foreign sources in March 1932. The statistics are in two portions. March lst-20th, that is to the end of the Persian year and 21st-31st March falling in the current Persian year. 3. Confidential. —Business was dislocat ed at Zahidan by the action of the Public Prosecutor who acting under instructions of the Central authorities arrived to investi gate irregularities in the Customs. Instead of proceeding actively to investigate the internal arrangements of the Customs the Inspectors directed most of their time to examining the accounts of traders (pre sumably in an endeavour to check them with the Customs accounts on which they could not rely). A list of all imports during the past year was called for from each trader. As is usual on these occasions great excitement prevailed and for a con siderable time no trade took place, and nothing was cleared from Customs. In many instances the trading books of mer chants were closed and sealed by the Ins pectors until such time as they can investi gate them. The Persian traders closed their businesses and took ‘ Bast ’ in the local mosque pending receipt of a repiy to their telegram to the Shah. 4. Carpets. —At Zahidan the demand for Kermani’s and Birjandi’s 'was poor. Afshari rugs of small sizes (6'x4') sold readily and the price advanced from Rials 3| to MC133FD ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter No B 0 Dated .9 JlfilBS? Rials 6j per square foot. Exports of all kinds of carpets continues from Zahidan, in order to obtain Import licenses, but they are disposed of at a loss in India. At Birjand the demand for local carpets continued, buying being for Meshed. 5. Wool .—The export of wool via Zahi dan practically ceased. Wool from the Sarhad was sent mostly to Zabul, from whence it is sold to Kerman or bought by the Russians in Meshed. 6. Govern.—The export of this commo dity, principally from Turbat-i-Haidari has increased owing to improved prices in India. 400/500 bundles were exported in April. Cotton grown last season in Sistan is &gt; still unsaleable owing to the high cost of transport to Zahidan due to the deplorable state of the load. 7. Sugar .—There were no imports from India in April. Zahidan stocks have dec reased considerably. Current rates Rials 195 for Moist and Rials 205 for Loaf per Indian Maund. The average Birjand rates were 178 Tomans and 182 Tomans per Tabriz! Kharvar respectively. Confidential .—Sugar is procurable in all the villages in East Kain and Sistan at rates less than half the above, as it is con tinually smuggled from Afghanistan. 8. Tea .—Zahidan merchants are over stocked. Demand in the interior is weak. 8-A. Dried fruits .—This being one of the few commodities which can still be export ed at a profit the trade has been brisk. About 10,000 maunds of Rais ns of the last crop were exported to India in April. It is reported that the demand, in India, for Persian dried fruit, particularly Raisins, is now better than similar fruit from Afgha nistan. This is said to be due to improved methods of grading and packing. ftRaisms aie being graded ss to quality and after washing are packed in boxt s _ . 1 T 1 * ’I') O T' /O-r weighing 1 maund Indian. Rates at /a- hidan Rs. 9 per maund, and in India Rs. 15. The following are chief items export ed 11. Silk — The export of this commodity during April v/as steady, although demand in India is dull. It is one of the lines selected to enable exporters to obtain Im- j ort licenses. (1) Almonds. (2) Apricots. (3) Pistachio. (4) Raisins. (5) Poppy Seeds.

Prices had risen as a result of the announcement of a monopoly of this commodity. It was believed that attempts were to be made to regulate the sale price. At the same time an Indian merchant who had sold Sugar to Zahidan and had obtained a Customs ‘Passe Avant ? had the consignment held up by the police. On representations being made moved. C. K.

Sistan Commercial Diary for the month of Februaryl932. Commercial Report from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, for the month of February 1932. i) 0 T C) Im''? (1) Attached to this report are figures showing: — (a) Imports into Persia via Nok- Kundi during December 1931 and January 1932. (b) Exports from Persia via Nok- Kundi during December 1931 and January 1932. (c) A statement of the value of Imports of British Empire origin and those from foreign sources December 1931 — January 1932. (2) Constant alterations in the Persian regulations governing trade and the uncertainty regarding the future of the Nuski extension of the North Western Railway are the principle causes of acute trade depression. (3) ConUdential —Wholesale smuggl ing continues. Fictitious declarations are made for exports in order to balance imports. As an example a trader recently dec lared 20 parcels as containing Saffron, a highly priced commodity. Actually the parcels were found, in the customs, to contain Gul-i-Zoofa an inexpensive country drug. Nevertheless the mer chant contrived to have the consignment passed as Saffron. (4) Customs Tariff .—Customs duties were again increased by 40 per cent. The de-control of the Bank Rate resulted in tho purchase price of rupees rising from 481/50 to 604/20 Kraus per 100 rupees. The National Bank has been freely selling exchange, an indication, perhaps that deposits of the Persian Government abroad are to b? withdrawn. On the other hand the Bank is endeavouring to obtain fixed deposits and is curtailing ENCLOSURE IK INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter Ko ^ 4 ) M. Dated K APR. 1932 Receiver MAY. t93? credits to customers. This may be with the object of producing favourable figures for the Annual Statement of accounts. (5) Trade. Toutes — T here are some indications that exporters from Meshed who had started to us^df the Moham- merah route are again turning to the North Western Railway via Kundi. Consignments of Carpets, Pistachio Nuts, etc., are now being forwarded via this route. The probable reasons for this are :— 1. Difficulties of transport via the northern route in the winter months. 2. The s’ldden fall in motor trans port rates from Zabidan to Kundi as a result of rumours to the effect that the rail way would shortly resume operations as far as Zahedan. 6. Sugar. —No^/imports or transaction have taken place at Zabedaiu Permits for import of Sugar issued during the last quarter have been cancelled. Average quotations during the month were,— Krans 165 per Indian Maund Moist. Krans 280 per Indian Maund Loaf. (7) Tea .—The market is stagnant at 45-49 Krans per man. (8) Carpets .—There has been a slight improvement in the demand for Birjandi due to Meshed buying for Germany. In Sistan determined efforts are being made to improve the quality of local carpets. Formerly only “ Baluchi ” rugs of in ferior quality were made, but Kermani’s, Birjandj’s Turkomans, etc , have recently■ .-f ■ • — ■ • ... / a U: ■ i v f . ' | r | been very well copied. The colours are at present too vivid, but improvements are being rapidly made. (9) Grain.—The, inability of producers in Sistan area to dispose of surplus grains is causing anxiety to the authorities who appear to have realised that unless a passable road or railway can be brought into operation the States share of the produce (the land being all ‘ Crown land) must continue to decrease. A Zahidan firm recently negotiated the purchase of 1,60,000 Indian maunds of wheat at Krans 50 per Sistani Khar- war, from the Revenue Department at Zabul, but as a dispute has ar isen regard ing the localities in which the grain is to be delivered it seems uncertain whether the bargain will be completed. Confidential .—It is rumoured that in return for this transaction to the benefit of the Revenue Department, per mission was to be given to the firm to import many prohibited ‘ luxury ’ goods on which fantastic profits could be made. (10) Confidential .—Great excitement has been caused at Zahidan over the arrest of the newly arrived Provincial Director of Customs. M. Delisse. An In spector of the Ministry of Justice is said to have demanded the production of Customs Account Books. M. Delisse, who is quite new to the appointment and extremly conscientious, stated that he was, by his regulations, prohibited ffom producing his accounts except by express sanction of the Director of Cus toms in Tehran, to obtain which he was willing to telegraph. Before i$e could receive a reply pe was arrested Tor ‘ Con tempt of Court’ and confined in the filthy local lock-up. Europeans who desired to see him were not allowed to do so. He was released the following day, but has refused to resume work, and is said to demand the full salary of his 3 years contract and permission to return at once to Belgium. News has just been received that Mehdi Irbab, the most prominent Per- sian trader in Zahidan has also been arrested. He has long occupied a pri vileged position vis-a-vis other traders, by reason of his close association with Persian Customs officials. H.

His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the\ Foreign and Political Depart ment, New Delhi, and has the honour to forward the undermentioned document. Sistan Commercial Diary for the month of January 1932. Commercial Report from His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, for the month o? January 1932. 1. Owing to delay in receipt of Import and Export statistics the usual figures for December 1931 will be appended to the report for February. 2. Both Imports and Exports via Kundi have diminished considerably. Goods ordered under Import licenses of the last quarter have nearly all come forward. A few fresh import licenses are being issued but for decreased quantities com pared with last quarter. Exports are suffering the seasonal deminution. Traders are hesitating to order goods owing to the uncertainty over the rail way. Should railhead return to Zahidan as is freely rumoured to be likely, they would suffer loss, having paid high trans port rates from Kundi. Confidential —Smuggling is rife all along the border and must account for a © good deal of the decrease in normal imports. 3. The Director of Customs has appa rently been instructed from Zahidan to accept invoices of any registered com pany in India and to calculate Customs charges at the Bank rate. Complaints are however received that the Director has refused to recognise invoices in several cases and a consign ment of boots received from Cawnpore has been temporarily confiscated on the grounds that the firm’s invoice does not represent the true cost. 4. Sugar .—None imported during January. Zahidan quotation Krans 146 per Indian maund for Moist and Krans 242 for Loaf. At Birjand the price fell to 132 Tomans and 138 Tomans per Kharwar. Tea. —There is no demand. In spite of abnormal transport rates from Kundi to 1 ENCLOBURt IN 'NDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter Dated 2 5 FEB. 1932 tavea 14 MAR. 1332 Zahidan the rate is falling. Average in January was Krans 49/51 per ma n . Motors .—The \ Zahidan agent of General Motors hW ordered 12 Chevrolet lorries. Four have been received and the remainder are m transit. All have been sold and paid for in advance. Confidential. Transport. —N. A. Mullick of Zahidan has completed a contract to transport A. P. 0. C. petrol from Kundi to Zahidan at Krans 150 per Kharwar. The road being practically impossible, or so bad that tins are damaged if carried by lorries, he has arranged camel transport from Kundi to Qileh Sufaid (New Mirjawa) and lorries thence to Zahidan. Owing however to the fact that very small quantities of goods are coming forward from Kundi other drivers, who some time back refused to accept a contract on reasonable terms, would now gladly take Krans 120 per Kharwar.

(b) Exports from Persia via Nok- Kundi during November 1931. (c) Statement of the value of Imports of British Empire origin and those from Foreign sources. 2. General .—Although a study of the Import and Export figures for the months following the withdrawal of Railhead to Nok-Knndi does not reveal any striking decrease in trade, neverthe less the high freights ruling plus the restrictive measures introduced by the Persian Government is beginning to have serious effect. The greater part of the goods imported had been ordered before the railway was withdrawn from Persian soil, and the last quarter has coincided with the seasonal activity in Export of dried fruits from East Persia. ~ ItJ is, however, known that very few repeat orders have been placed for Imports. The retail trade in imported goods at Zahidan is practically at a standstill— that is to say goods legitimately import ed. On the other hand personal require ments of piece-goods, motor spares, tyres, sugar, liquors, etc., are forthcoming, and reach the town by various means which avoid the Customs. A consignment of uo less than 800 pairs of canvas shoes recently arrived by such means. There is a good deal of connivance on the part of Customs officials. There can no longer be any doubt but that the Customs Receipts must be suffering heavily as a result of the withdrawal of the Railway. Goods exported suffer much damage f ana loss through dishonesty of the lorry drivers. ' J 4 Import licenses are being obtained by vrrw? 1 means by Persian exporters. Uith the connivance of junior customs officials goods exported are customed several times over and certificates obtain ed. Great profit is being derived by un scrupulous persons from smuggling rupees into Zahidan and Krans in the reverse direction. Sugar.— Owing to the new monopoly very few consignments have come for ward during December. Wholesale rates were Moist 157 Krans, Loaf 247 Krans ' per Indian Maund. Tea .—The market was dull. 50/54 Krans per man being the average rate quoted. Oils .—Owing to increase in cost of transport from Kundi the price of Anglo- Persia Oil Company petrol and kerosine has advanced to Krans 33 and 21*25 per tin respectively. Transport Rates.

His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan aiul Kain, presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Go ^ernmcnt of India in the Foreign and Political ^ Department, New Delhi, and has the honour to forward the undermentioned docu ments :— Sistan Consulate Commercial Diary for November 1931.

( б ) Exports via Nok-Kundi during October 1931. (c) Statement of the value of Imports of British Empire origin and those from Foreign sources. 2. General. —Small seasonal profits are secured in certain lines but on the whole business has remained exceedingly dull. In anticipation of the Sugar monopoly coming into force ail stocks of this com modity were hastily cleared from Zahidan Customs. A sudden rise in Imports has taken place during November. This is attribut ed to uncertainty regarding the railway. Fearing that railhead might be with drawn as far as Dalbandin, an unfounded rumour to which effect gained currency in the L bazaars; merchants hastened to replenish stocks. The immediate result was a rise in transport rates from Kundi to Zahidan of 100 per cent. Exchange. —The pound sterling was at 25 per cent, below parity of exchange at the end of the month ; while the rate for rupees was Krans 532 per cent. Banks were however not selling and consequent ly Bazaar rate rose to 610 per cent. Owing to the uncertainty the value of Exports continues at a high level. Im porters have likewise been afraid general ly to reduce prices, but in a few excep tional cases prices were reduced and goods met with a brisk demand which tends to show that if the exchange renders imported goods relatively cheap the demand will greatly increase. Ex ports remain at a low level and transport rates from Zahidan to Kundi fell to 30/ 40 Tomans per Khar /ar. Krans are being fairly extensively smuggled to Ntflr-Kundi where the rate is f 6 ^CLOSURE IN | NDIA FOREIGN . F ff. ■ l6J . 480 per cent, at Quetta it is 450 per cent. Exports from Meshed via Zahidan have practically ceased owing to the difficul ties and expense of reaching railhead at Kundi. It is now cheaper to despatch via Muhomerah. Handling charges at Zahidan (owing to the fact that lorries from Meshed cannot generally proceed to Kundi owing to Visa and Customs diffi culties) Kundi and again at Karachi are high. For example 60 bundles of cotton were recently exported from Zahidan. Landed at Karachi it cost 32,000 Krans. It was sold at Rs. 11 per maund of 82 lbs. and thus realised 1,600 rupees. In other words for purposes of financing imports in exchange each rupee cost the exporter 20 Krans in exporting this commodity. At one time the export of cotton was considerable. Given railhead at, or near the frontier and a good road of approach, the cost of exporting by this route will greatly decrease, to the ad van tage of trade and the Indian railways. Sugar ,—The rate rose to 180 Krans per Indian maund on announcement of the government monopoly, but closed weak at 159 Krans for moist and 262 Krans for loaf sugar. rp ea —Demand is poor. The markets are reported overstocked. No imports during November.

( б ) Exports via Nok-Kundi during September 1931. (c) Statement of the value of Imports of British Empire origin and those from Foreign sources. 2 . General .—The uncertainty resulting from the change from the Gold Standard and consequent sudden fluctuations in exchange has caused restriction in trade during the month. A Persian Merchant of Zahidan who was absent in Tehran wired his agents to purchase all available rupees. About Rs. 10,000 was purchased at Krans 700/ 800, but the rate not having changed as anticipated he has suffered considerable loss. As a result others have been ner vous of dealing in exchange and although the Banks are now offering to sell rupees little business has been done. Although imports have been restricted such goods as do find their way into the country are being disposed of' at a very satisfactory profit to Indian importers. 3. Sugar .—Very little has been sent up country from Zahidan. The Russians are underselling Indian Importers. The market remained about 15J Krans per maund (Indian of 80 lbs.) for moist and 260 Krans for Loaf sugar, at Zahidan. 4. Tea .—No change—the Zahidan price has remained at 58/62 Krans per man.

(b) Exports via Nok-Kundi for the month of August together with the totals for pievious months of the current Persian year. Statement of the value of Imports of British Empire origin and of those from Foreign sources. 2. General .—The volume of Trade re mains very restricted, but such little that has been done appears to have resulted in satisfactory profits by Indian Traders, who in spite of exporting goods at a loss contrive to make a handsome profit on goods imported. They are, however, greatly handicapped for want of capital. Money is locked up in goods exported to India to enable Imports to be made, but which they find difficulty in disposing of even at a loss. Moreover goods when imported remain for long periods in the Customs before the necessary Import permits can be obtained. The sale of Import licenses continues at Zahidan on a basis of 18 per cent, or 24 per cent, profit. In the former case the onus of importing as well as selling the Rupee value of exports to the National Bank rests on the buyer of the license. In the latter case the seller remains responsible for selling Rupees to the Bank for ex ports, while the purchaser assumes res ponsibility for Imports. A case of forgery of an Import license has been discovered and will shortly come before the Courts. Sardar Singh Ishar Singh of Z ihidan exported goods to the value of 533 Rials. They sold the result ing Import license to some Persian Tra ders who converted the figures into 5,033 Rials at least it is the contention of the Indian Trader that the jawaz as sold was in order. Owing to damage to the N. W. Railway both Imports and Exports, beyond Quetta, were suspended from 25th August to 15th September. Smuggling from Afghanistan, by little known routes through the hills, is on the increase and may be expected to attain considerable proportions as the news of profits spreads. Both in Zahidan and Zabul smuggled goods are plentiful. On September 16th Customs Officials at Zahidan searched the shop of Hari Singh Kartar Smgh and seized 14 pieces of pro- / hibited cloth on suspicion of being smug gled. The trader was, however, able to produce Customs forms shewing that the goods were imported before the enforce ment of the Monopoly Law. Sugar .—Very few consignments came forward to Zahidan during the month. The market closed weak at the end of September at Krans 154 per Indian Maund for Moist sugar and Krans 270 for Loaf. Tea .—In spite of improvement in the Calcutta market the local prices have remained steady at Zahidan at 58—62 Krans per Man. Oils. —Anglo-Persian Oil Company petrol in large quantities is held up at Karachi. Lack of storage at Nok-Kundi has delayed onward despatch. The Company’s local representative Mr. Dowling has proceeded to India to make arrangements. Carpets.—K steady demand from Tehran caused Birjandis to advance by J ill 9 ?

(b) Exports via Zahidan during July 1931 and progressive totals. (c) Statement of values of Imports of British Empire origin and those from foreign sources. 2. Indian traders who sold export licenses at a profit of about 17% are now faced with considerable loss. They were under the impression that the buyers would import and that the undertakings they had signed, to import goods, would be cancelled. This is not the case and they will now have to sell rupees equal to the value of exports at # the Bank rate, and in addition have lost on sale of their exports in India. The licenses were all sold to Persians who resold to Russians at a profit of 20% and will be utilised by the latter to import oil, sugar and cloth goods. Practically all available motor lorries have been engaged by the Russians to im port goods from Ashkabad. 3. Sugar .—The future for Indian traders is fraught with danger. Consequent on the events noted in paragraph 2 above the rate for Indian sugar at Zahidan fell in August from Krans 180 to 150 per Indian maund (80 lbs.) at which rate the importers lose Krans 8 per maund at Zahidan. If the Russians again undersell the situation will be similar to that of 1927/29 when sugar from India could not compete. 4. Indian traders who proceeded to Tehran obtained further Import licenses. They report that applications by post are merely filed and that a personal visit to Tehran is necessary to gather with douceurs to the clerks concerned. Under these con ditions licenses are freely given. In some cases security is accepted that goods of equal value will be exported within a speci- peiiud.

Many importers await the rumoured re-opening of the railway to Zahidan. The few motors plying for hire between Zahidan and Kundi make a handsome profit on transporting passengers and therefore demand Krans 200 per Kharvar for goods, which importers cannot afford to pay. Goods lying at Zahidan which were on the prohibited list and for which Import licenses were not received were re-exported to India in July. The period for re-export has been extended for three months, but the Director of Customs failed to inform the Public, or as is so common in Persia, him self only received intimation long after the revised order was to take effect. 5. Tea .—The rate at Zahidan fell in August from 62 to 58 Krans per Tabrizi maund. The market which had been brisk for some months appears to be now glutted and demand is weak in the interior of Persia. 6.

(c) A statement of values of Imports of British Empire origin and those from foreign sources. 2. It was anticipated that the issue of trading licenses for Import and Export under the Monopoly Law would become a regular procedure and that trade would improve, but the closing of the Persian section of the Nushki-Zahidan railway in troduced a new disturbing factor. Motor traffic to the new railhead has not yet been 1 organised. Exports entirely ceased after the closure of the line and imports of the principal commodities greatly decreased. It is anticipated that as a result of the withdrawal of the rai way smugg ing over the Eastern frontier from Afghanistan will considerably increase. Reports have already been rece ved of considerable con signments of smuggled sugar having arri ved at Zabul and Birjand. At Zahidan a trade has started in Import licenses which are being sold at 17% pre mium. From this it appears that the retail price of goods imported under such licenses is certain to advance by at least 20%. About twenty traders at Zahidan have received Import Licenses from Tehran. Others who had applied received no licenses and a number of Indian traders have pro ceeded to Tehran under the impression that they will be able to obtain licenses if they can meet the responsible authorities per sonally and smooth the way. Zahidan Customs issued a notice to the effect that all prohibited articles lying in the Customs must be cleared on license before the 30th July or re-exported, failing which they would be confiscated by the -^urn'iiineiiL. ~~ ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter No H2Q si. | 31 AHG 1931 Sugar. —The stock in Zahidan. market is depleted.

Zahidan wholesale rate at the close of the month was Krans 62 per Tabriz! maund. Trade at Zabul. —On withdrawal of the ? Railway the prices of all imported goods increased by nearly 100%. Sugar was for a time almost unprocurable, until some consignments were smuggled from Afghanis- ‘ tan.. The market for grain at Zabul continues very depressed. Large stocks of last sea sons grain exist and this year’s crop finds no purchasers. Gurbachan Singh, an Indian trader of Zabul who has been trying to raise capital with a view to starting cotton-spinning either at Zabul or Birjand, appears to have abandoned the project and has now interes ted Sarhang Murteza Khan, Frontier Com missary, in a scheme to irrigate waste lands at Kila Rustum, near Zabul, by means of pumping machinery. Attempts were made to induce local landowners to subscribe capital, but little interest appears to have been shewn. They mostly declined to subscribe unless the National Bank took some shares. In view of the depressed state of agriculture and the fact that crops produced by natural irrigation do not pay, a scheme involving much capital outlay and recurring expenditure for pumping water appears to be lacking any of the ele ments likely to lead to success. The Military authorities at Zabul have called for tenders for the supply of clothing for the troops. Cloth of foreign manu- \ facture will not be accepted.A consignment of country-made cloth (cotton) was received at Zabul from Kain and retailed at Krans 1 J per Zar. Some members of the Russian Sharq Coy. of Meshad visited Birjand, Zahidan and Zabul during the month. Enquiries at Birjand were in regard to the annual production of wool and cotton and consumption of sugar. At Zahidan and Zabul prices of all imported goods were taken and samples of imported cloth.

(c) A statement of the value of Imports of British Empire origin and those from foreign sources. 2 . A few traders at Zahidan have secured licenses enabling them to clear goods from the Customs which had been imported before May 22 nd last. It is rumoured in Zahidan that all applica tions for licenses to import sugar via Bundar Abbas have been refused and local traders advised to purchase from Bushire where large stocks are said to exist. Small traders are greatly handicapped by a large proportion of their capital being rendered idle through inability to clear stocks from the Customs. Some of the smaller Indian traders are turning their attention to Afghanistan and intend either to transfer their businesses or open branches at Chaman or other places in British territory favourable for trade with Afghanistan. Whether this is because they anticipate improved trade with that country, is not clear, but it may well indi cate that they anticipate, as a result of the restrictive regulations of the Monopoly Law, that goods will be more extensively smuggled into Persia via Afghanistan. Sugar .— 1,177 Indian Maunds of gra nulated sugar were imported during June. The stock in Zahidan prior to this amounted to about 1,100 maunds. The demand for up-country has been poor, but the price has nevertheless advanced from 147—160 Krans per Indian Maund at Zahidan. The retail price of this commodity ad vanced by 10 — 15Ts. per Kharvar at Bir- jand on receipt of news of the impending closure of the Persian section of the Zahidan railway. 106 Maunds of Loaf sugar were import ed in June. Prior to the decision to close the Railway no marked change in prices had occurred at Zahidan, which remained about Ts. 29 for a bag of 1 maund 16 seers Indian. Tea. — The demand for tea for the interior has been firm. 318 Maunds of Black Tea were imported and the selling rate at Zahidan was 64 Krans per Tabrizi maund. Wool .— Some 700 maunds (1 Md.=92|lbs.) of the spring Clip came on to the Zahidan Market. Export without permission from Tehran being prohibited, none has as yet been exported. Carpets .— In spite of some demand for Birjand carpets at Meshed local weavers declare that no profits can be made owing to the rapidly increasing cost of materials. As practicaly all the cotton thread is imported from India, the impending closure of the Railway has caused considerable cons ternation among carpet makers since it will inevitably still further increase the cost of thread. Machinery .— The import of Machinery for cotton-spinning either at Zabul or Birjand, which was contemplated by the ‘ Persian Produce Exporting Company’ of Zabul—a small firm of Indians and Persians, seems likely to fall through owing to difficulties in raising capital. Exchange .— Rs. 100 have been worth 850 —900 Krans in the Birjand. Bazaar. The Zabul Branch of the National Bank is reported as doing no business at all.Notes. Minute Paper.

A statement shewing the value of imports of British Empire Origin and those from Foreign sources. 2 . General .—As a result of the Monopoly Law the Customs warehouses at Zahidan are now almost empty and the staff idle. A very large sum has been lost to the Customs during the past few months. The Banks at Zahidan and Birjand do scarcely any business. The National Bank of Per sia does a small amount of local exchange work between Meshed and Zahidan, etc., but it is doubtful if any of the three Branch es of the National Bank in this Consulate area, earn enough to defray their overhead expenses. Great difficulty is being experienced both by traders and the public in East Persia owing to the complete exhaustion of stocks of certain goods. Large stocks have never been carried and traders have been in the habit of importing to meet demands only a few weeks ahead. Applications for licenses to import goods on the authorised List were submitted to Tehran at the beginning of May. These ap plications cover only such goods as are within the quota for the first quarter of the year 1310. Up till the end of May no licenses had been received. A few traders who went personally to Tehran and paid their way 5 there, obtained restricted permission ito import, or to clear goods already in the Customs. Sanction must be obtained from Tehran for goods not on the authorised List—at least three months must elapse before such sanction can be procured. As examples of difficulties encountered, the following may be quoted as typical. MC212FD The tyres of some Morris lorries proceed ing from Kerman to Zahidan, recently burst owing to the extreme heat in the desert. The owner succeeded in getting to Zahidan in another car. No tyres of the size required were in stock anywhere in East Persia. All local traders declined to import from India until permission had been obtained from Tehran and the luckless owner will probably have his cars stranded for months in the desert. Tyres for a car of this Consulate were held up in the Customs for several months—none of the size are procurable in Persia normally, but by chance two were discovered at Zahi dan, which had been imported for a similar car a year ago. The price which had to be, paid for these tyres, the rubber of which is; already partly perished, was 110 % above; cost price at Karachi. Exports have practically stopped since it f is not practicable for traders to sign the' required agreement to sell all the foreign*, exchange derived, to the National Bank | there being too wide a margin between the ' Bank’s official rate and the trade rates at which goods for export are purchasable. A Zahidan trader who went personally to Tehran has obtained permission to clear 120 motor tyres which were in the Customs at the time the Monopoly Law was promul gated. He states that the Control Com mission also promised to grant permission in future for imports by him of all motor parts. It is believed that this permission, which is likely to give him the monopoly for Zahi dan, cost a considerable sum of money in Tehran. It remains to be seen whether the promise will be kept, or further payments be exacted. It is rumoured that Persian traders of Tehran, who have hitherto had no branches in Zahidan, have applied for licenses to im- ♦ port by that route. -If sanctioned they pro pose to import and sell locally at a profit to traders who have not secured licenses, or will allow local traders to import on their licenses, extracting a large commission for the facility given. Sugar.—138 maunds only of granulated sugar were imported in May. In the middle ENCLOSURE !N i.TOU 'OR FI AN f N 20JUL1931of the month the rate at Zahidan rose from 13| tomans per Indian maund to lS| tomans. One hundred bags were sold to Persians for up-country, whereupon the rate dropped to 14| tomans. Seventy-two maunds of loaf sugar were imported. The demand is poor, but owing to nervousness about replenishment of stocks the rate rose from 25 tomans to 29 tomans per bag of 1 maund 16 seers Indian. H. M. Consul is informed by responsible persons that the price of sugar and tea at I Birjand has reached a level at which none but Government Officials and a few wealthy persons can afford to purchase. The poor have entirely given up the use of these com modities. Cloth Goods .— Owing to stoppage of im ports from India, Zabul traders have replenished stocks from Meshed—the goods are all of Soviet origin and are retailed at Zabul at 60-80% above Meshed retail prices as the traders fear that stocks will shortly be unobtainable. Municipalities .— The Birjand Munici- pality have constructed octroi posts on the roads approaching the town and propose to collect a tax on all goods entering. Details are as yet lacking. The cost of living is con tinually rising and wages are taking an upwards trend in consequence. Tea .— The demand up-country is report ed as strong. 1,375 maunds of black tea were imported at Zahidan during May. Carpets .—No change in the rates. Bir jand producers state that owing to increased cost of cotton thread, carpets cannot be produced at a profit and many looms are closing. Transport .—In spite of increased cost of running lorries and difficulties in obtaining spares, rates remain as reported last month, as there is a paucity of goods offering for transport. Lorries are being grossly over loaded in the attempt to secure profits. The tax on covered lorries being higher than that on uncovered vehicles, mqs-t owners have removed the hoods of tW_ lorries, which enables loads to be piled up to an extent which causes instability. A con siderable number of vehicles have recently turned over in consequence, with resultant injuries to passengers. An employee of this Consulate recently travelled in a lorry which ‘ turned turtle ’. He transferred to another lorry which after proceeding a few miles also overturned. On a recent journey to Zahidan H. M. Consul saw three lorries which had overturned and were abandoned on the roadside. Discussions are still proceeding at Birjand about the formation of a company to import and export. The only persons who have sufficient capital for the purpose are not normally traders, and although they appear desirous of taking advantage of the oppor tunity offered to gain what they anticipate as enormous profits, they are apprehensive of risking capital in trade of which they have no experience. At Zabul a number of Persian shopkeep ers have closed their shops on the grounds that they made no profits last year and can not afford the annual ‘ traders 5 license which is a tax on income. At the moment the economic position appears extremely grave, both for Indian traders and small Persian traders. The only persons who appear likely to benefit are those with sufficient influence in Tehran to obtain monopoly licenses. C. K. DALY, Major, H. M.

It is learnt that the Control Commis sion has fixed quotas for imports of all com modities. It is said that the quota has Peen fixed for the whole province and that local authorities will subdivide this among the various towns. If this be the case it may be presumed that Meshed will obtain the bulk of the import trade and Sabul and Zahidan will scarcely obtain an adequate proportion of the total. Applications to import will have to be supported by ^ a certificate as to the applicant^ financial status from the local Governor or the Customs Director a system which is likely to lead to serious abuses. Imports or exports Will only be permitted on produc tion of security to export or import com modities of equal value within six months. The provincial Director of Customs at Zahidan states that the orders he has received are so contradictory that he is baffled by the regulations. He requested full details of the Monopoly Law and was referred to a Tehran newspaper which contained only a supplement to the Law. Apparently is was naively admitted by the framers of the Law that the Law, 9s it stands, and the supplement, are unwork able !

Copy ^ FOR INFORMATION.CONFIDENTIAL 0 Commercial Diary of His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, for the month of April 1931« There is little to report. Uncertainty as to the terms of the new State Monopoly of trade is causing uneasiness among tra ders. Goods are still held up in the Cus toms at Zahidan. Motor owners and gara ges are experiencing difficulty in carrying on their work as spare parts for lorries, etc., cannot be obtained. The Banks are doing no exchange busi ness. A certain amount of rupees have recently changed hands in the Bazaars at about Kraus 750 to Rs. 100—the official rate being 667. The only goods arriving in Sistan and Kain from Zasdan are small quantities from existing stocks held there. Small quanti ties of Russian goods continue to be brought from stocks at Meshed. There is a rumour in the Bazaars that premission will shortly be given to clear goods from the customs provided the iim porters can satisfy that they have establish ed businesses in East Persia and are not acting solely as middlemen. Traders have been submitting applications to Tehran sup ported, in some cases by certificates from the police to the effect that they are retail traders as well as importers. The police although, in some cases granting the certi ficates, state they have no instructions in the matter, C. K. DALY, Major, M, Consul, ENCLOSUfit &gt;» t mow, fobbgh sec*- - 7 1 .a.

Commercial Diary of His Majesty’s Cons p the month of March 1 for Owing to the recent law creating a mono- poly in foreign trade there have been no clearances from the Duzdap (Zahidan) Customs and all trade is at a standstill. The Persian Government having refused to reconsider the question of enhanced cus toms on goods already lying in the Customs, the Government of India sanctioned, as a special case, the re-export to India of a quan tity of sugar. 6,731 bags were so re-export ed on March 19th to various destinations in the north of India. The heavy surplus thus disposed of the price of sugar at Zahidan has risen from Krs. 120 to Krs. 140 per Indian maund (80 lbs.). Details of the new law are not yet known locally, but traders are everywhere appre hensive of their future. Most British Indians are in a bad way, as they cannot even close down their businesses, the majo rity having outstanding debts to collect which will take a considerable time. It is rumoured that the Zahidan Customs have received instructions that the import of the following articles will be totally pro hibited. Liquors, woollen and cotton piece-goods and silk goods, haberdashery, leather goods, oilman’s Stores and lorries and trucks. It is said that only cars the value of which does not exceed Ts. 3,000 will be imported and then only with the sanction of the Control Commission. Two cars only (both Fords) have arrived at Zahidan during the month, but delivery from the Customs has not been sanctioned. With the permission of the Control Com mission Krans to the value of Krs. 7,50,000 were exported from Duzdap by Sindhi traders. 4,586 maunds of petrol valued at Rs. 40,770 were brought in via India by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. .

This, coupled with the announcement of the increased Customs, amounting to 80 per cent., caused a rise in prices of imported com modities of over 100 per cent. Imports and exports diminished, as the rate is said to leave no margin of profit. The Nushki-Duzdap Railway line was breached in several places as a result of heavy rain and only two trains arrived at Duzdap during the month. Indian traders at Duzdap telegraphed I direct to Tehran pleading for reconsi deration of the Customs increa se. I hey received a reply to the effect that the matter did not affect them as they were in a position to pass the increase on to the retailers and general public. Although this is to some extent true, there can be no doubt that the heavy increase of retail prices must greatly affect the total consumption in a country so poor as Persia. The traders have now decided that they will re-export the majority of the sugar now lying in the Duzdap Customs to India, provided they will not be called upon to refund the 15-16ths Indian Customs which has been remitted. The extra freight and expenses involved would result in a loss of about Rs. 2 annas 8 per bag of two hundredweight, which is said to be less than the loss which would be sustained if they dispose of their stocks in Persia. This is the first occasion on which there has been any attempt to re-export goods from Persia on any considerable scale and the matter has been referred to the Govern ment of India as regards the question of Indian Customs duty which is involved. Traders complain of extensive damage which has resulted from their stocks lying unprotected in the Customs during the recent wet weather. The contention of the Customs officials is that in many cases the stock has been long in the Customs and might have been cleared earlier. In view of the difficulties which traders have experienced in recovering payments due to them from Persian Merchants up-country, transport delays due to bad state of the roads and other difficulties it is perhaps not surprising that they have been unable to clear faster and it is inconceivable that they would willingly incur the charges for storage in the Customs if they were in a position to clear the goods. At the same time there has been considerable overtrading by these Indian traders who have insufficient capital to deal in such quantities of goods as the recent high prices for sugar, etc., led them to import. The wholesale rate of sugar has advanced at Duzdap to Krans 100—120 per Indian maund but was falling at the close of the month die to adverse reports from Meshed of the state of the market there. No sugar was imported during the month. Oils.—Following upon a month of no imports in January, 9,002 maunds of A. P. O. C petrol arrived at Duzdap in February. Almonds and nuts .—The local Agent of General Motors Co., who was indebted to ffiis firm in India to the extent of Rs. 75,000 and has for months been unsuccessful in his effort to buy rupees, recently purchased Almonds and other nuts to the value of Ts. 60,000 on behalf of his company as the only means of remitting the sum due.
