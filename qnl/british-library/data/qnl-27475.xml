In lauo, 10 appear probable that during the next few years the Middle East will, wo i-a... — • , plant the U.S. as the world’s principal oil exporting area. sup-6 2 - 6 . The importance of this from a strategic point of view cannot be over emphasised. Adequate oil supplies ar^ essential to modern warfare, liven il it is true, as is sometimes claimed, that atomic energy is destined to become' the power of the future, it will be many yqars before it can be universally applied, and- the problem of controlling atomic energy for use in smaller power plants may well oe insoluble, .even if, in the next few years, atomic energy is renue^ed practicable for large power plants, the day when it can replace the petrol-arawn internal combustion engine'in vehicles and aircraft is still a long way off. In the meantime, petroleum will acquire increasing importance as world stocks diminish, 7. Apart from its importance as a potential world su; &gt;ly centre, miudle Hast oil is of particular strategic value to the British Burp ire because of its geographical location.- Placed at the junction of Europe and the Par East, at the main cross-roads between England, India, Australia and South Africa, the miudle East dominates strategic Empire com/nunications. The nearest alternative sources of oil supply are iv-erica to the West, and Burma and Borneo to the East. It is true' that to the North, the oil fields of Rcumania and of Russia, are nearer as the crow flies, out even in tiiues of peace, little oil is available from these sources, all available exports being taken by the nearer European market, while in time of war, as we have seen in tue past two Gr/^\ Wars, supplies from the north arc likely to be entirely cut off. Tim. o;xpwrience of the last two wars has' also shown the difficulty, and the danger, of movin_ large supplies rf oil by tanker across thousands »f miles of ocean, liable at any moment to attack sea or air. Already in these two wars, the relatively small quantities of oil available from local production in the Middle East have helped to tip the scales in this drea from defeat to victory. Shoulu Middle East supplies be destroyed, or should they fall into enemy hands, it might well prove impossible for us to. defend this vital area. And in a few years time, when the expected .expansion of Middle East oil production has taken place, possession of those oil supplies may well prove to be the deciding factor not only in the defence of the kiddle East but in the prosecution of tue war as a whole. 8 . In these circumstances, Britain's predominant position in the kiudle East petroleum world assumes great significance. At a rough estimate, Britain controls 70 - 75^ of present Middle East production and about 60£o of Middle East estimated reserves. The Abadan, Haifa and Suez refineries are likewise British controlled. In.marketing, British companies are predominant in practically every m ladle Eastern country with the exception of Levant States, Cyprus, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. 9. Financially too, Britain's share in Middle East oil is of immense importance today. British controlled oil installations in the Middle East represent British capital investments running into hundreds of millions of pounds. Tifey provide a source from which British and Empire requirements can be supplied with Sterling oil as opposed to Dollar oil which has hitherto had to meet the bulk of cue Empire's oil requirements, and, in addition, a source of hard currency for Britain for :&gt;il exported to other than Sterling councries, 10. One other point may well be stressed. Throughout the Middle East chore is an important nucleus of British Staff engaged in petroleum'exploration, exploitation, transportation, refining ana marketing. The vaiof this, not only ii providing *** employment fov a large nu.iber of British technical anu o.u.jin jstracive employees over seas, but also in ensuring, the fullest oo-opcracion v.itu the Services cannot be ovv:*' emphasised. To take the single case rf the Shell Co. in Egypt; the presence ox' a nucleus of British Staff enabled the Shell Co. immediately on the outbreak of war to take upon itself duties in connection with the supply not only of civilian requirements but also of the Services' wartime needs, including both supplies and scorage facilities and even the provision *f containers in vast numbers. The organisation of the British oil companies throughout the area‘was such that the Services and H.M.G. could use them virtually as a British Government Department. This was only possible bp virtue of the fact that the key meh of the oil companies' staffs were British, Today the oil companies' in practically all Middle East countries are faced’ with an increasing spirit cf nationalism, one rf the objects of iwhich is to replace all the British Staff by local nationals. Should this policy be pushed too far, it might prove an embarrassment to Britain and her allies in the event of again being involved in-war in this area. 11. After the British, the most important oil interests in the Middle East are now those of the Americans, y During recent years.American'oil companies, faced with the prospect of decreasing supplies at home, have turned, with increasing, urgency to the Middle East and have been most active in search of concessions ana m exploration. Their greatest successes to date have been in Saudi Arabia, Bahrein ana Auwait.

In the post-war years production continued to expand and reached 8 , 360 ,000 tons in 1938. In the meantime, in 1932 relations between the Persian Government and the dl.O.C. had become strained and the Government .endeavoured to cancel the concession. After much controversy a new sixty-year concession was granted an 29 ,upril 1935. v Under the new concession the area was reduced to 100, Id squaxe mxico, various other privileges were withdrawn from the Company and the royalties and taxes to be paid to the Persian Government were considerably increased.

At -che present time five oilfields are in production in this ^pjea; Masjid-i-Sulairnan and Haft Kel being tie oldest, and three new fields, Agha Jari, G-ach Saran and Pazanum, viiich ire re, all brought into production during the v/ar. All these oilfields are connected bv pipeline to the oil refinery and port at Abadan. id. In 1942 all surplus wells in Persia were plugged as part of a denial scheme, only sufficient wells being retained to enable the ILasjid-i-Sulaiman and Haft Kel fields to operate, at maximum econo; c 'capacity, Willi the removal of the threat, wells and fields have re-opened and or eduction extended. (Stop press: Production in 1945 was 17 , 000,000 tons). 19 . The refinery at Abadan is one of lie four biggest in the world, and the biggest east of Suez. It played a vital part in the Allied war effort, supplying oil both to ii.e lliddlo East and to India and the Par East. After the loss of the Par Eastern oil supplies in 1942 it became apparent that the refinery, big as it was, would be insuffic ient to meet all demands, and large-scale expansion was undertaken. By December 1944 an additional annual refinery capacity of f, 000,000 tons had been added, bringing up the total capacity to some 15,000,000 tons per annum. This has since been still further 'r* increased and at present approaches 20,000,000 tons per annum. In the meantime new processes haye been added and in particular thp production of high-octane aviation petrol has been encrtously incteased.’ At the :u\break of hostilities there were no facilities at Abadan for the manufacture of 100-octane'aviation petrol. Today Abadan is equipped to produce upwards of 1,230,030 tons a year. 20. Virtually the whole of -die output of the Abadan refinery is exported. In addition to supplying military and civilian requirements in the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, in Eas and South Africa and in India, Abadan during the war has provided vast quantifies for whe Middle East end South E: st Asia theatres of war and even further afield. It is now available for U.K. and Briiish Empire requirements. 21. The A.I.O.C. concession also covers a much smaller oilfield in -..stern Persia at Naft-i-$hah. Oil from this field goes by pipeline to a small refinery at Kerman shah where it is refined, produces being sold for local consumption in Persia itself. 22. The ^.I.O.G* also has interests in Ira&lt; through its share in the Iraq Petro leum Go., in the Haifa : efinery, and in the newly developed centre of oil production at Kuwait, 23. although the British-owned A.I.O.C. concession is the only oil concession at present operative in Persia, .any other countries have attempted to gain a footing there in the past and there is every likelihood of further attempts in the future. American, Russian, Dutch, French and even Japanese combines have all attempted, at various times, to obtain concessions. 24. A Dutch mining gre the Algemeene Exploratio Mij owns an exploratory licence for m?.nerals covering part of northern Iran, gran bed in 1939 and giving them 'oil search and exploration rights” as well as the right to search for other minerals, but little or no exploration has been carried out under this licence. 25 . Tie run a struggle for c'nee a.; ion 0 i tea remainder of the country h ' been ^ bet-ween Briv.is&gt;', Russians aqd A eric ah 3 ar. ' .: a;:, back t the 19k0's. The enormolis strategic and economic importance of petroleum was first realised during the Great w^T, 1914-18, and immediately after the War there ms a rush to acquire petroleum' concessions in various parts of the mrld. In Nor shorn Persia, American, British and Russian, interests were in competition. In 1921, the Standard Oil Company of America proposed an oil concession in the Northern Provinces in exchange for a loan of ten million dollars. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company then claimed that they already held a concession which they had acquired in 1920. The following year (1923), a joint Anglo-American undertaking was proposed, to exploit North Persian oil on a fifty-fifty basis. Upon this, the Russians intervened. The Soviet Ambassador to Tehran officially informed the Persian Government that Moscow would oppose any concession to foreigners for the ex ploitation of oil in Northern Persia, Exclusive rights of exploitation, he claimed, had belonged to a Russian subject. (The Russian subject in question, one Khochtinra, a native of Georgia, lias acquired somewhat doubtful concessions dated 1 896 and 1916; these -were che rights which the Anglo-Persian Oil Co. claimed to have purchased from him in 1920). Although, by the Treaty of 26 Feb.1921 the Russians had renounced all former concessions in Persia, One Persian Government, they claimed, had engaged itself by the same Ti .acy not to grant those concessions to any other foreign country or individual. 26. Since thac time, the Russians have consistently adhered to the claim that they, and only they, have rights of oil exploitation in Northern Persia. Their policy /found expressionfound expression in the 'Pravda' on 26 Sept 1922 us *oilows: 'iik. iiaseicai Govornujer:-; could never tolerate the establisha&gt;ent on the Russo-Persi&lt;-j] frontier of a foreign capa- &lt; talast undertaking, which could, at any time, transiorni its concession into a s.ilacary base which would be a menace to Russia'*. 27. The Anglo-American proposal fell ohrouji. The follooiu. ye».r (1 &gt;22) another ijnerican Oil. Corporation, the Sinclair Consoliuateu Oil Corporation, asked for a con cession for the northern area, and attempted to come to a workin. a.prcemc;iro v.it'h the Russians for the transport of oil across Russian territory, but the Russians proved intractable and the concession was never taken up, 28, Having thus foiled f*nglo-^..erican attempts 00 obtain concessions in Northern Persia the Russians now made a bid to establish themselves in the area. In 1929, a Russo-Pcrsian oil company, the Kovir Khourian Co,, Registered in Persia as a Persian Co,, but mainly financed by the Russian Government, wae established to exploit an old oil concession in the Semmn area,(originally granted in 1878 to Persian subjects and re registered in 192k by their descendants who sold 75f&gt; of their rights to the Russian, KhAchtiara) • The company carried out a number of soundings in various places in N.E, Persia buc failed to strike oil. The Persian Government subsequently caai.,ed that the cqp^ession was null and void as it had never been ratified. In Rfu, che Persian Government granted exploration rights in this area to the Amiranian Oil Company, an idnerican-Pursian company, but the concession was abandoned in 1996. In 194k, the Royal Du**Vi Shell and the Standard Vacuum Groups entered into negotiation ,rch chc Persian Go\^rnment for concessions in the South-east of Persia. Once a,pan the Russians arrived on che scene. In September 1944&gt; k, Kavtaradze, Soviet i.ssistant Comi.iiasar for Poreign fairs, arrived in Tehran with a' committee of oil experts, ostensibly to raise the matter of the Khourian oil concession. However, after the first meeting with the Persian Prime Minister (Saed), the Khourian question was never a__ain moocioncd. Instead, Kavtar.adze demanded a new. concession giving the Soviet Governnonc ex-loratorj rijits over an area «f 210,000 square miles in Northern Persia, from Azerbaijan co ^uchan, for a period of 9 years, after which they (the Russians; would specify the aiv^s Ct^. v/iouod to exploit. The Persians, not unnaturally, resasced tnis demand. Kavtaradze brought Very strong pressure to bear. Doubtless he felt that he hau w ood car^s in his hanus. The international prestige rf Russia stood very hi c .h, ana Russian troops were in oecapa-.-aon in Northern Iran. Saed however held firm. Russian-engineered demonstrations in Tehran and elsewhere, using the Tudeh Party, only served co strengthen che resistance of c.;e majority of the Persians. British support and publicit/ helped co stren^then the Persian resistance, and they now decided that no oil concessions would be gran ecu call after che withdrawal of foreign trrops which was due to came place . itnan 6 months of due enu of the war. Kavtaradze made no effort to disguise ins an..c-r.. In an.effort to a pease the Russians, Saed resigned, and was replaced by bapat, Russian pressure contaneud until, bn 2 December 1944, the luajlis, in a sudden show o.. resolution, rushev_ throu, h a Bill of double urgency which forbade any Pers ian Prine a.in is tor, kenister, or Under ‘Secretary from entering into any negotiation or signin' any agreement with re {&gt; ar«.. to oil concessions on pain of imprisonment, Kavtaradze’e fury knew no bounds* 4. week later he left for ^scovv, not before stating that he expected the Majlis to rectify its mistake. 29* The veto applied equally if course to British ana Americans and negotiations fo joncessiors in the South-east by both groups were suspended. 30 . Events during the pas c few months show, that despite their failure bo obtain official permission the Russians have by no means' renounced their aims in Northern Persia Russian support to the Democratic Party's programme of autonomy for Azerbaijan is doubt less designed to , .ive them a predominating influence in that area, ana reports have already been received that the Russians are carrying out exploratory boring for oil in the Tabriz area* Russian troops are still in occupation of the Qubv?r- proy-uCtos of Northern Iran (Gilan, Mazanderan and Gurgan) and reports indicate c.wdc in these areas too boring for oil is being carried out at a number of places, particularly in the Gur^an area* Iraq. 31. long ago as 1901, W.K. Dkfrey attempted to t &gt;*t a Turaisti concession for exploration in the territory which subsequently became Norchern Iraq. British oil interests in this area however were for some years opposed by the Deutsche Bank, ana oil stalemate and considerable friction resulted. Finally, in March 19 14, a fusion oj. inter ests was agreed Ujp*n, under the aegis of the British atu Ger -as Porei^i 0 . x ices, ana the capital of the 'Turkish Petroleum Company' widen Ljca.w •JvjvjJtk OtV/‘V/&lt; 1'by '‘/he D' Arcy group, was re allot ted, giving 50. per cent to the D' Arcy Exploration Company (Anglo-Iranian), 25 per cent to the Anglo-\3axon Petroleum Company (Royal Hitch Shell) and 25 per cent to the Deutsche Bank. 32. The Deutsche Bank's share was sequestrated during the war. After 1 918, differ ences arose between the French and the British regarding French participation. Those weru settled by the San Remo Agreement, under which the sequestrated 25 per cent interest of the Deutsche Bank was transferred to a combination of French oil interests, under the title 'Compagnie Francaise des Petroles'. 33* The San Remo Agreement was then bitterly at e ckod in Aj. erica as contrary to the 'Open Door' principle. Eventually, American .opposition was overcome by.transferring half the Analo-Iranian interest to a combination of American oil companies under the title of the 'Near East Developme.pt Corporation'. 34.

To move the oil to the seat, coast, the first stage of its journey to the world’s markets, the crude oil is sent by pipeline, a distance of over 500 miles to die Mediterranean coasr. A double pipeline runs from Kirkuk, both pipes running parallel to Haditha one then /running v/ests running west to Tripoli in th'e Lebanon, while the other runs south-west at,e ‘U caravan routes, through Transjordan to Haifa in Palestine, the northern U-ipol ) - P line serves French and American interests, the' southern (liana) British and Anglo-Dutch.

Egypt has never ranked high in tiie ixs t -x - .x - ' L y ; bOUrcfi Yet in two Kjor wars she hex been able to ^ xx .'cKKat- „f Allied oil supplies. By a strange oowoidonce, in hot,, -rs E _oo w - - /enough to •. •- 8 - enough to discover new sources of oil, as a result of which increased quantities of petroleum*products were produced at the most critical moment, in an area in which these increased supplies were of vital importance. 52* The oilfields at present in production in S^ypt are controlled by An^lo- Bgyptian Oilfields, Ltd., managed by the Shell Group, the controlling interests being held by Shell and the Anglo-Iranian (British). The Egyptian Government holds £100,000 'C' Shares in 'die Company and other shares are held by the public. 53. Production da’ises back to 1911, when oil was struck at Gemsah, on the western shore of the Red Sea, some 150 miles south of Suez. walls here here yielded only a small production but in 1914 the Hurghada oilfield was discovered. This was rapidly developed during the 1914-^9 war, yielding in 1918 a peal: of 1,935*000 barrels, an excessive rate of production for this field, which literally 'wore itself out in the service of the Allies”. 54* After the war, production from Hurghada fie,ld continued on a reduced rate and with a tendency to fall. In 1938 hov/ever, a new and bigger oilfield was discovered at Ras Gharib, some 120 miles south of Suez, and by September 1939 production from this field had risen to 15,000 barrels per day. Since 1938,almost the whole of the production has been obtained from Ras Gharib, Hurghada being practically exhausted. 55* The new discovery, coming 0.3 it did just before the opening of a .second WohPj^ War, was of great value to the Allied cause. The transport of petrol from Abadan, over 3,000 miles away, or from America round South Africa, became almost prohibitive in 1%-0- 42 vhen Allied tanker losses assumed unprecedented proportions. Only the presence considerable supplies on the spot helped to ease what would otherwise have been an in tolerable strain. Rn.s Gharib production rose to over 9.000.000 barrels (1,250,000 tonSj per annum. 56. The rapid increase in production i rom the Ras Gharib field c-alled for a corresponding incre 0 .se in refinery facilities at Suez to cope with the unexpectedly high level of production. The outbreak of war made it impossible to embark on a normal programme of refinery expansion and development, but by ingenious adjustments and more rapid throughput, it was found possible to cope wdth the full production of crude oil. ■■ 57 . In view of the importance to the Allied war effort it is indeed amazing that the enemy did not carry out more determined air attacks against the refinery and oil fields. Emergency measures were taken to meet such an Sven vitality, but fortunately, except: for the sinking of a tanker in the later part of 1942 ac Ras Gharib, whereby ohe submarine loading line was temporarily put out^of action, the Egyptian oilfields and refineries suffered no important damage from enemy air raids. 58 . Throughout the war the oilfields and refinery were vorked uo raximum capacity. New fields are urgently needed to maintain Egyptian outpuv at ivs current level and exploration work is in progress in many areas. The Anglo-Egyptian Oilfields Co. hold a number of exploratory concessions. In addition, exploratory licences have been 'cakon up by a number of American Groups, including the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey, bocony . Vacuum, the Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Oil Company. The areas involved include the Red Sea Littoral, '^he S^nai Peninsula, areas west cv the ivilo and along the Mediterranean coast. Geologically there are several interesting possibilities but these' still remain to be proved, (As this report goes to press it is reporv ed tha^ the Anglo-Egyptian Oilfields Co. have struck oil in Sinai, opposite Suez). 3 Arabian Peninsula and Persian Gulf. 59. This is the most recent area to be developed and is noteworthy for the-extent to which American oil interests have taken a leading part in recent developments, having struck several extremely rich oil deposits, particularly along tho eastern coast 01 Arabia near the Persian Gulf. 60. The Bahrein Petroleum Company, which holds a concession over the Bahrein Islands, is technically a British (Canadian) company, but is wholly American owned and forms a unit the Calx ex Group (Standard Oil of California and Texas Corporation). The Company first established ivself in Bahrein in 1930 by-purchasing from a.British syndicate a concession dating from 1925. In 1932, tho new company struck oil and two years later conmercial production began, a refinery having'been built in the meantime. In 1934 the original concession area cf 100,000 acres was.extended and again in 1940 until it now includes the whole of the Sheikh’s present and future dominions including the reefs and territorial waters surrounding the island. Output from tine field averages about 1,000,000 tons per annum (1,135,000 tons in 1938). The refinery capacity of about 1 , 500,000 tons per annum was increased in 1941- to 2 , 750*000 tons per annum, to deal with crude oil from Dhahran, on the mainland. The refinery can now produce all /types of■■ - 9 - tyoos of po'broleu: products, including 10 J-ocuane aviation . petrol. 61, Encouraged by their discovery of oil a.'G Bahrein the Califomian'Araoj. u. C &gt;, acquired-a much more important concession in Saudi Arabia, a^.area of some 250,GoO square miles (see nap) covering the whole of the eastern area ol ohe Arabian Peninsula, excepc the coastal districts eastwards' and southwards from tl:ie Qatar Peninsula, vruic... c-.re already covered by concessions granted at various times to affiliates of the I.P^C. 62, Oil was first discovered in Saudi Arabia in commercial quamiuies in 1^17^ the area buing the Dhahran (or Daman Dome) field on the mainland, some yf ^1° G inL-.n^ and abqu-r $ 0 miles north of-Bahrein. In the Gait ex Group formed the Araoian American Company to control production in the,area. Production irom tiie Dnahran field aaounted to on .y 67,000- tons in 1930, but by 19'A had risen to 600,000 tons. In the meantime, two fi’.rther discoveries had been .fide, orie at Abquaia and the other ao Abu Hadiya, bringing up combined production in 1 9V: to 1 , 330,000 bons. , r , , •* 63 , At present the v/hole of the Dhahran crude, oil is refined in the Bahrein refinery. However, a new 1 , . : .rn refinery is nearing:completion at Ras Tanura, on mie coast ftoposite Bahrein, 'vdth a capacity of 2,50O,CA)0 tins per annum ana -aole of proving all types o products including 100 -octane aviation petrol.
