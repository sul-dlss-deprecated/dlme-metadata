Attributed to this is a belief that Bekerman is German and Jewish, and conflicting reports from Vernon Smith, an American woman who came in contact with the refugees. Also detailed is the Polish Consulate General in India’s wish to facilitate their release, and his assessment of their legitimacy once they had arrived in Bombay, India.Included are statements from the five men; preliminary (folios 3 to 7) and revised (folios 9 to 15) following alleged inconsistencies in the former, and a statement from Chinnova (folios 19 to 21).
