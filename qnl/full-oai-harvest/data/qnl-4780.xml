These file notes were moved from IOR/R/15/2/1666 upon discovering that they have been previously displaced. This was discovered during cataloguing for Qatar Foundation Partnership Programme. The title on the file notes is ‘Ceremonials and Honours’ which clearly match the current file. Also looking at the notes themselves we can tell that the descriptions and the dates provided all belong to the file. Therefore, these were removed, rearranged, and re-foliated accordingly and now they are part of file IOR/R/15/2/1667.</extent><extent>The main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 129; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio. An additional foliation sequence is also present in parallel between ff 3-115; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled. ff 116-127 have been moved from IOR/R/15/2/1666 and have been refoliated to fit this file; previous circled numbers have been crossed out, while the uncircled original foliation has been left alone.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains telegrams announcing the deaths of members of the British Royal Family, British Government officials and ruling families and presidents of other countries, and their funerals.
