Dear Colonel Loch, The mosque which I mentioned to you the other day as being very ancient, A.D. 876-9^is described by DIEZ in the Jahrbuch der asiatischen Kunst II (1925) page 102 ff. In spite of the descrip tion given to me by Mr. Creswell of Cairo, who is a well known authority on Islamic architecture, I have been unable to locate it. It was seen by the German writer in 1914 in Manamah. I wonder whether by any chance the work mentioned above is in Bushire or in the Government/ of India ! s library and if so, if a copy could be made of the reference. Yours sincerely, Lieut.

They have multi-nave liwans consisting of series of pillars with pointed arches, which run parallel with the kiblah wall/. In front a projecting roof three to four metres wide resting on octagonal brick pillars affords protection from the sun. The roofs consist of loam coating over a wooden awning. Courtyard and side liwans are absent. Here therefore there still exists, as indeed in all Arabia, the type of old Arabic open mosque, which was nothing more than a wide hall sheltered from the sun on timber or walled pillars, a type which has also been retained in Persia in the Sunnite musalla, the ’’place of prayer”. The kiblah wall has no prayer niches. (Plan of the mosque on Bahrein). This old-Arabic musalla mosque differs substantially by reason of its open condition from the courtyard mosque generally dotted over the Islamic countries, which has developed from already existing types of courtyard buildings appertaining to Hellenism and Buddhism. The mosque ruins to which we are now devoting our consideration also belongs to the courtyard mosque type. The ruins consist of an approximately square outer wall (about 25 x 28 metres), the west front of which with the contiguous lateral parts is still standing, while the remaining A The interior consists of The material is indigenous volcanic tufa. Of the series of columns of the naves there stand only remains at the southern side; the columns were built of drum-shaped stones 30 cm. high and 60 cm. in diameter held together with mortar and were joined with keel arches. On •«. parts are marked by a mound of earth, twe naves on each side of a central courtyard2 . ■M) 6 ) On the other hand the pillar facades forming the court are still standing upright. The kiblah wall consists of broad pillars with half-column profiles and was at the last rebuilding in the 15th century strengthened and heightened by a retaining wall of ragstone, so that it is 0.90 metres thick, while the supporting pillars only measure 0.60 metres. As this retaining wall is only built at the height of 1 - 1.50 metres above ground-level, it does not appear in the sketch (cf.illustration 2). The two side walls consist of double columns, while the despoiled en trance wall was built on single columns. The pillars and columns were connected by lightly keeled pointed arches, the inner contours of which were partly toothed and partly in Gothic profile, and were adorned with specimens of reticulated work in stucco. The ceiling of the haram was supported by two teak pillars 4 metres in height and 24 x 15 cm. in diameter with a beam over them, and can therefore only have consisted of light material, probably brush-wood with layers of earth thereon. The timber is very weather-worn, cracked and grey as the result of exposure to the elements. The saddle-beams and the upper parts of the pillars are adorned with carving (illustrations 6-9). In the back wall with the rectangular projection in the middle there is no longer any trace of a mihrab. On the other hand two kiblah stones axe built into the two stone pillars of the kiblah wall (illustrations 4 and 5). The high circular minarets stand at the east and west exterior walls. In their present form the ruins are the remains of a mosque of the year 740 H. (1559/40), as is shown by an epigraphic tablet which is built in to the kiblah wall of the courtyard. Above this tablet oblong blocks, some inverted, are built into the kiblah wall on both sides, on the inner and outer sides, with Cufic ....Culic inscriptions, as bindbeams for the rubble work (illustration 3). A block with writing characters from the same period is In addition there are the two kiblah stones at the pillars of the western wall with Cufic writings round them (illustrations 4 and 5). Such stone blocks built into the kiblah front of the courtyard and indicating the direction for prayer one also finds, inter alia , in the mosque of Ibn Tulun at Cairo; on the other hand one looks in vain for them in this position in the mosques of Baalbek, Diarbekir and elsewhere(cf. M.V.Berchem, Voyage en Syrie, 1,2, 359). The setting up of kiblah blocks instead of the kiblanic or the mihrab was an Arabic system, which was observed inter alia at Mohammed’s mosque in Medina.The mihrab niche was not introduced until later. Both kiblah stones are approximately of equal size and are embellished with epigraphs round them. They differ chiefly by reason of the upper ornamental friezes and the profile work of the niches in the interior panels, which is in one case f ormed by keel-arches on small double columns and in the other a^polyboInarch. , The keel-arch stone (illustration 6) bears the following inscription:- The upper horizontal band gives the basmala; the narrow band below it only permits the letters 'ad - d’w.,.' to be recognised free of doubt. The two vertical bands only allow 'as - salawat' in the second half of the right band and 'adama...mulkahu.. Alla’h wa rasulihi' on the left band to be decyphered with certainty. spoiled by light penetrating; I cannot therefore submit all the remains of the epigraphs. Cf. P.F.Burton: Personal narrative of a Pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina (Tauchnitz, IBM) 2,72, according to Abu Huraira: 'This mosque was a square of 100 cubits. Like the former building it had three doors: one on the south side, where the mihrsb el Nabawi or the 'Prophet's Niche'now is; another in the place present Bak al Rahmah and the third at the Bab Osman, now called the Gate of also built into the base of the western minaret/ 5 ^ The (5; u n f or tunately several of my photographs of this edifice were Gabri el. (pThe kiblah stone with the trefoil arch (illustration 4) shov/s above the basmala also, below in the second panel 'Mohammed wa # Ali% and in the third panel ,f al Hasan wa al-Husain'. On the right vertical band the following is legible:- salaw^t Allhh ’alaihi wa-s-saldm*' 'Adtoa Allhh ••• wa mulkahu •••' can be recognised on the left vertical band* These inscriptions therefore consist of the basmala, eulogies and the invocation of the four chief Sunnite names* And these latter are certainly the most interesting in this epigraph, for the mosque is thereby stamped as being a Sunnite onet The epigraphic stones built into the kiblah wall above are unfortunately too abrupt to render possible reading for the time being (illustration 5)* Doubtless, however, they originate from the same period as the kiblah stones* To the same period, finally, belongs in all probability the three-lined epigraph on the wooden pillar (illustrattoi 7)* It runs thus 1* L&amp; AllSh ill§. j.ll&amp;h Mohammed* 2* RasOl Aildh # A1I* 5. Wall Allah# Thus here again the Shiite formula appears. The contemporaneity of this woodcut epigraph with the stone epigraphs is not, to be sure, a matter of certainty without further investigation. S. Flury, to whom I sent the epigraphs for inspection, assigned the wooden one to the 10th century A.D*, and felt bound to assign to the others a con&amp;iderably later date, the 12th century, but he referred to the fact that their constantly •••• (6) continued* ^ Instead of a mihrab or prayer niche a large block of stone directed the congregation; at first it was placed against the northern wall of the mosque £ind it was removed to the southern, when Mecca became the kiblah.'constantly recurring trefoil arches are met with in isolated (7) cases about the middle of the 11th century in Amida. The accuracy of assigning the wooden inscription to the 10th century is confirmed by the ornamentation, according to which it might even belong to the 9th century, for the ornament is one of the group of the so-called 'first style” of Samarra. The design (illustration 7), consisting of a vase-shaped bloom with a five-leaved palmette above, over which again a three- lobed lotus sits, and with the lateral (? Pelten) tendrils, is just too typical for the 'first style” at Samarra. If no exactly literal counterpart is found there^numerous closely related variations of the same theme are. If this ornamentation belongs to a class of which examples are, apart from Samarra, only known up to the presents© far as I am aware, at Cairo and here, then the geometrical carved work of the saddle-beam (illustration 9) falls completely out of this class and indicates an ethnologically primitive, indigenous ornamentation. This saddle-beam appears therefore not to have been constructed until after the time when the old skeleton- frame \infc the new walls /waspu^^». The stone epigraphs belong to another class and resemble very closely the Amida epigraphs of the 11th century. As in these the regularly recurring round trefoil arch formation of the letter stems first appears separately, they can be pronounced to belong to a later formation, about the 12th century.

Here the hollows were only filled with coloured stucco. The question now arises whether the wooden epigraph of the pillar and the stone epigraphs can be brought as regards period to a common denominator by moving the former forward, and the latter backward, as much as possible, so that they may meet in the 11th century, and these parts could thus be pronounced to be contemporaneous. In theory this would probably be possible, as the wooden ornamentation has certainly remained unaltered for a long time. Wo proof can however be adduced, so that the question had better remain an open one. an oblong two-lined epigraphic block likewise inserted in the kiblah wall at Neshki with an epigraph in conjunction not yet decyphered calls the mosque 'mashad as - sarif du - 1 - ainnmfrn^ the place of the holy martyrs (or place of pilgrims, or burial) - with the two minarets and the year 740 H. (1S58/40), in which the mosque was erected in its last form, now lying in ruins. (9) The two minarets also belong to this style of architecture, originating in 1540 A-D. Around lie graves. Here stood also the old town, called Bilad al-gadun by the people. In spite of its ruinous condition this old mosque is of interest from the points of view of the history of art and epigraphy, and chiefly on account of the built-in wooden beams. • aether t ese originate from an earlier building or not, they afford us at any rate a picture of the early mosque halls, so ' frequently *. f , —— —m**k frequently mentioned in literature, made of teak, which was shipped from India to the Persian Gulf and Egypt and was much utilised in the early Islamic mosques of the towns of Iraq, in Bagdad, and also in the Persian highland country. $hen we hear that in the Friday mosque at Nlschabur the part where the mimbar stood was supported with wooden pillars, and that the construction of this part dates back to the time of Abu Muslim, the well-known xPbbasiden propagandist (about 750 A.D.), a case quite similar seems to exist there as it does- here, where the old timber pillars were also left to the haram, where the Mimbar stood, while liwans stood left and right on columns, ibis mosoue is, however, to the best of my knowledge the only one of those known hitherto in which teak pillars are retained in situ_ and are still recognisable in their original function. These pillars are the very last relics of a timber architecture with quite peculiar forms which was widely spread throughout the Indian Levant in early Islamic times. They were rectangular and prismatic in iorm, without increase of girth upwards, and terminated with a tenon into which the saddle-beam was fastened i (illustrations 6-8). In the upper third part they were orna mented with chip-carving, the style of which appears likewise to have reached from Cairo to India and is still to be seen at oamaira in all variations. It is nowhere indigenous but exists in the craftsmen 1 s guilds, which have developed and preserved it, and migrates with them everywhere they execute orders. Quite •••• (10 &gt; Die 5/ ^ft der islamischen Volker('The art of the Islamic nations' 1 ), 1st edition, page 46.*»— - U 8 . Quite another style of ornamentation is indigenous in Arabia; it has existed there from days of yore to the present time and has left its visiting card here on a saddl^heam completed later (illustration 9). The material of the second buiIding ; which was probably erected at the same time as the kiblah stone in the 12th century, is the lava tufa of the island (the volcanic origin of which is betrayed inter alia by a hot spring in its interior) hewn into square blocks. In the third building, finally, decadence expresses itself in rubble and sun-dried brick work. Freestone mosque buildings are rare exceptions. I found ruins of a mosque of mortar among the remains of the old city of y Darlz, situated in the low-lying country south of Kazirun (Z 1914). These ruins are the remains of a pillar mosque with wall pillars of one metre diameter with pointed arches and vaulting. 'hether this freestone building technique is characteristic of the Indo-Mediterranean Levant can in the absence of photographs of antiquities scarcely be established. Yet this Levant style, as one can call it, expresses itself in my opinion in the polybolic inner contours of Indian origin, which like the trefoil arches extend from India to Sicily and Venicq,.and here in the trefoil arch have become an important epigraphic ornament, and thus a special Cufic creation of which / other documents do not yet seem to be aware. Whether ' e quite isolated beginnings at Amida of this trefoil Cufic are or whether it is a Levantine characteristic, remains for moment an open question. t Finally the mosque is interesting on account of its SL epigraphs ; the decyphering of which is however reserved to tb paloeographists.— r i. , .4B 1 . 1 — warn*' m Political Agency, Bahrain, the 17th May 1936 /f In contimation of Hicklnboth&amp;in 1 s demi- official letter No.1220-34/1 oated the 9th l^ay 1936, I am enclosing a further copy of the tianslation of the extract from the Jabrbuck. 2.
