No. Sir, • 25th August 1906. I have the honour to inform you that as roquested in your telegram of 11 August, No. 300, I visited both Tanb and Abu Musa Islands on my way from Lingah to the Shatt-al-Arab. 2. At both islands we found flags flying, and the flag- staffs and gear in a fair state of repair. At Tanb they complained that the part of the flagstaff in the ground rots away, and they asked for a new and longer one with its lower end protected against rot. If it is allowed them I would suggest that the lower end of the new flagstaff might be coal-tar red and covered with sine or copper sheathing. They also asked foi a new flag. The one they were flying was not a correct Trucial Chief's flag. It was white with a red horizontal bar down the centre, thus,'— instead of being white with a red square in the centre, as laid down in the treaty of 1820. At Abu Musa the correct Trucial Chief's flag was flying. The flagstaff was in need of a few trifling repairs which the Headman P .Z.Cox, C.I.E., I.A., Political Resident in the said PERSIAN GULF.said they would have done when the pearl divers returned. 3. With regard to the question of the visits paid lately to Abu Musa by Germans it appears that about a fortnight before our arrival there, a German named Braun belonging to Lingah came over from Debai to Abu Musa. He spent one day on. the island, and another sailing round it. He stated that he was looking for a good anchor age for a German cargo steamer which he expected would arrive at Abu Musa about three months later on, and that his company wished to buy up oxide which this steamer would take away. He said she would also call at Debai, Lingah, and the other principal Gulf Ports. Braun and another German whom the Arabs called 'Enkas' (probably meaning Wonckhaus) visited the Island about a year ago staying ■bh there 3 d ays. They sailed * roundit examining the coast, but did not take soundings on either of.two visits. Braun thenjreturned to Lingah and the other to Bushire. H.B.M.Consul at Mohammerah informed me that the Captain of a German merchant steamer named, I think, Wehr, had told him that he J had visited Abu Musa quite lately, but the Arabs mentioned nothing about his having been there, and distinctly stated that Braun was alone when he came to Abu Musa this year. 4, The following^/wa3 made by a man named Abbas bin Habbash, who originally came from Minau but has lived for several years at Abu Musa. He is son-in-law to the head man, who confirmed his statement. He said that a year and a half ago his daughter, Halima, aged then about 14 years was kidnapped by some Minau natives, and taken across to the Arab coast . About a month ago he heard that she was at Shargah, having been bought by some Arab there. He went in search of her, found her, and took her to Abdul Latif i the Native Agent, to whom he reported the facts of tho case, ask-V asking him to have his daughter who wished to go back to her own people given up to him. She remained 25 days in the Agent's house, who then informed Abbas bin Habbash that as the Arab had given 40 dollars for her, he would have to refund him the money or he could not have the girl back again. Abbas then pointed out that his daughter was a free woman, not a Seedie, and that he had claimed British protection for fter; also that he could not possibly raise 40 dollars to purchase her freedom. % 5. Should you desire any further enquiries to be made at Abu Musa^H .M .Ship 'LAPWING' will be coming up the Gulf about the end of next month, and she could very well call there on her way. 6. I arrived here 3Snd August and expect to remain till about the end of September in the vicinity of the Shatt-al-Arab.

There are only 27 men, women and children resident in the Island. At the time of our visit only three of the men were left the remainder being away pearl diving. They appear to be very poor, have only water enough for their own small community, and have only a few date trees. Their Headman, Mohammed bin Hassan, is very old and his duties are carried out by his son, Ali bin Mohammed. No water or supplies of any sort could be obtained here. ABU MUSA .

They are employed by a Lingah contractor, Hassan bin Ali, a $ British subject who was said by the Headman of coolies to pay Rs.300 a year to the Sheikh of Shargah for the privilege of taking away oxide. The coolie Headman also stated that they took away annually about 40,000 bags. Nearly all the Arab men were away at the pearl fishery. They seemed to be a pretty flourishing community and possess 7 pearling boats, 5 fishing boats, 150 date trees, 40 cattle, 200 sheep and goats, about 60 donkeys, and 4 camel They get their provisions from Lingah.

It has lately come to my know ft' I -ledfe that Hassan Ali has entered into a written asree, O ' -ment with the German , Mr Wonckhaus ^ under which the latter has acquired the right to buy from him the whole \ ' N \ \ of the produce of the mines • I wish you to take step's to obtain from Hassan , » / the loan of the original agreene^t with Mr ?/onchaus or a certified copy of it &lt;, Such a document will AjLirML no doubt be in Arabic or Persian.or in German and Persian It is very important that I should see thr precise ts terms of this agreement s^^fUU / WiU li and I lesve it to your judgment and tact tc obtain it from Mw in the most convenient way . The important point to is whether Hassan has bound himself to sell only a cer- ■jl'ain quantity at a fixed price or whether Mr Wonckhaus has the right to purchase the whole produce to the exciku- -sion of other traders • N 4 You should not discuss with Hassan Ali the question of his nationality ^ but I wisn you to give me from your w own knowledge a brief history of his antecedents ancTa^ v/hether he is regarded as a British protected person or Persian subject in Lingah ^As one of Uie original Oonoossioimirea Baa bin Abdul I»atiif has not boon a party to. any sub leas© of the Conoaasion as a whole and as Sheikh Sapar and the said Conoession- aii'es at lay direction last year# were warned not 'bo enter into relations with any foreign subject, it is hardly like ly -that any document has been passed for the transfer of the Conoession bodily| on the cuier hand the apparent ly persistent refusal of Hassan Samiyeh to produce 'the document necessarily arouses suspicion, and fron ^?ha.t he has written to his friends here it would appear that he has at any rate bound himself to Herr ¥onok}iau» for a term of 4 yoars in- such a vra&amp; that he cannot sell any of the out-put 'to other parties. 3, ftuch action if jay information proves -to be true could I should think be regarded as a violation or x-he condi tions on which the Concession was given and would viarrant its withdrawal# but the «Government of India will be better able to arrive at a decision on this point when the com plete facts are before them. I had hoped to be in a position 'to submit a full re port before leaving, but up to the last minute no reply has been received from the Mnpah Apmt who is no doubt experiencing difficulty in prevailing upon Hassan Hamaiyeh •oo show him the document. \ 4, I should mention in conclusion that Hassan Samiyah can be treated as a British subject. His father was bom in Bahrein and afterfards obtained British naturalisation papers in Bombay wiere he resided for some years* and it appears from 'the records of the Kesidency that on the above groimds Hassan and his son ;-ave been in the habit of preferring their claims against Persian authorities or subjects through the British Besidency.

A t ) In continuation of my letter No. 2577, dated 28tli October 1906,1 now have the honour to submit the report called for on the subject of Herr ■Wonckhaus's acquisition of rights in regard to the red oxide deposits at Abu Musa. 2. In order to place tbe case completely before Government, it is necessary to give briefly tbe early history of the concession. The present Sheikh of Shargab, Sagar-bin-Khalid, supplanted his uncle ;• Salim-bin-Sultan, as Ruling Sheikh, in March 1883. Sbeikh Salim, realising that he had no following, accepted the inevitable, and has since become a pensioner enjoying more or less friendly relations with bis nephew. ! ^ In the summer of 1898, Sheikh Sagar went on the pilgrimage to Mecca, v leaving his uncle above-mentioned in charge of his administration at Shargah, and the latter while acting in this capacity granted a lease of the red oxide * mines on Abu Musa Island to three persons, as follows :— * M • (1) Haji Hassan-bin-Ali ' Samaiyeh resident in Lingah and Agent for the Bombay and Persian Steam Navigation Company at that port. This individual is by origin a Babreini, and has in the past claimed and received British protection on tbe strength of a ___ naturalisation certificate granted to his father by the Government m&amp;eabus-e of Bombay. A separate memorandum regarding his nationality ^ is attached. (2) Abclulla-bin-Haji Hassan, son of the above. (3) Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, son of the Residency Agent, Shargah. ** 7L A translation of the document graimng tiie^^original concession accom panies. This is the concession to which Colonel Meade referred on page 10 of the Persian Gulf Administration Eeport for 1898-99. The chief thing to remark in it is that no limit of time is stipulated for on one side or the other, y... it -would have been simpler if Sheikh Sagar's attention had been drawn to this on his return from the Haj, but, such as it is, tbe agreement must be held to have been endorsed by Sheikh Sagar's subsequent action or inaction. 3. In December 1904, on the strength of a report from our Agent at Lingah, v f &gt; to the effect that Herr Wonckhaus contemplated visiting Abu Musa with a view to taking up the export of red oxide, instructions were immediately issued to the Eesideney Agent at Shargah; and it will be seen from his two xt ». j 4. j ''z 7 ^ letters, of which translations are enclosed, ~ No. 14, dated 16th January 1905. ., , , ' , ., en .1 1 0 , , j-. \ /7 ^ 3 4.31 d+v t ion K tliat tlie Sheikh of Shargah and the L No. 16, dated 18th January 1905.^ / . . . t .r* y ^ concessionaires received specific warning against entering into any ill-considered compact with the German Eirm. The next information, which I received on the subject, reached me by accident on my return from India in August last, and it was the entry in the diary of this Presidency for 12th August which originated the present correspondence. The Y 1 foregoing details bring the case up to the present time. 4. Eeferring now to my ad interim report No. 2577 of 28th October 1906, I have the honour to report that after much fencing on the part of Hassan Samaiyeh, I have at length received a certified copy of the agreement between &gt; Wi him and Herr 'Wonckbaus, and append a duplicate of it. It will be seen that I it has been executed by Haji Hassan Samaiyeb, claiming to act for his two partners, and gives to Herr Wonckhaus a specific monopoly of the output for four years, with prefereniial option to renew at the end of that period. The Lingah Agent, in forwarding it, states that Haji Hassan asserts that ' he 3101 F. D. ('lhas purcliased the Chief of Sliargah's share and holds a writirm tn from the Chief.' I am at a loss to know what that means, but am tv steps to ascertain. ' waning In any ease the Concessionaires have behaved in a hole-and-corner a obstructive way and deserve no consideration from us, and it remains f Government to consider whether steps should not be taken to unset fh arrangement. It is probable that Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. would be quite read to take up the trade on terms equally advantageous, for the Government f India will note from the papers forwarded to me under Porei^n Denartm + endorsement No. 4!213-E.A., dated 22nd November 1905, that they are pavi &lt;» to the Moin-ut-Tujjar for the Hormuz product more than double the rat obtained by Haji Hassan from Herr Wonckhaus. In fact, I understand th t Messrs. Strick were on the point of making the Shargah Concessionaires a offer when they were forestalled by the German Firm, 5. The following arguments suggest themselves to me in connection with the possible withdrawal of the concession:— («) Hassan Samaiyeh, if taxed with disregard of Sheikh Sagar's interests or instructions, or of the wishes of the Residency, would no doubt argue that nothing had been permanently ' alienated his agreement with Herr Wonckhaus merely providing for a sale of prospective produce. (5) The agreement {vide opening lines) purports to be executed between Herr Wonckhaus and ' Mr. Hassan bin Semey ' as ' owner and holder of the Bu Musa Concession,' and him only. At the end it is signed solely by the said Hassan, but he adds the words ' wa shurqahd' ('and his partners') after his signature. It is understood that Hassan has always been the working partner, but it is doubtful whether he carries any document authorising him to enter into written and unlimited contracts without consulting the other parties. His son Abdulla would of course, express cognizance and approval of his father's action' but the third sharer, Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, was apparently not consulted and would, no doubt, record his dissent if advised to do so. (c) In view of advice given to the Trucial Sheikhs in time past by the Residency, warning them against the grant of monopolies without reference to Bushire, the fact that an unlimited monopoly has been granted would afford the Sheikh of Shargah reasonable grounds for cancelling the concession. (d)But it would seem to be unnecessary for the Sheikh, should be agree to cancel it, to introduce any reference to instructions or Hdvice received from the Resident; for, seeing that the original concession provided no time limit on either side, there seems to be nothing to prevent Sheikh Sagar from withdrawing it at will, on any reasonable grounds ; and these certainly exist in the fact that the commercial value of the red oxide has lately increased to an extent which makes the rent paid by the Concessionaires (250 dollars per annum) ridiculously small. Sheikh Sagar's object in resuming control of the red oxide export would be with a view to working it directly for his own benefit in association with Messrs. F. C. Strick &amp; Co. or some other British Firm as his Managing Agents. 6. In short, there would seem to be no practical difficulty in bringing about the extinction of the concession ; it would appear to be merely a question of political feasibility which Government are in the best position to appraise. It may be that the potential value of the red oxide deposit, which is difficult to gauge, is not of very great magnitude, but the political importance at the present juncture of preventing the acquisition by Germany of vested interests in the Gulf can hardly be questioned.Enclosure No. 1. tl Memorandum regarding antecedents and nationality of Hassan-bin-Ali Samaiyeh of Lingah. According to a report from the Eesidency Agent at Lingah, who is well acquainted with the history of the family, Ali-bin-Hamad-bin-Samaiyeh was a native of Bahrein and emigrated to Lingah 60 years ago, during the Arab occupation, accompanied by his two sons Hassan and Hamad, together with many other Bahreinis. The father and sons worked for many years as Nakhodas on board sailing vessels to Indian and other ports, and for thirty years were treated like other emigrants by the Governors of Lingah, that is, as subjects of the local Sheikh. The father Ali died in Lingah, and Hassan afterwards obtained a certificate of British naturalisation from the Government of Bombay. In virtue of that certificate he has been considered as under British protection by the Persian authorities, and has been given the protection of the Agency. His brother Hamad, however, is considered a Persian subject and is only protected by the British Agency in matters in which Hassan and he are jointly concerned. IIP foii At the beginning of March 1899, when the Derya Begi retook Lingah after some fighting with the Arab Sheikh, Mahomed-bin-Khalifah, a number of claims resulted from British subjects, among which was one from Hassan- bin-Ali Samaiyeh who, in his petition wrote, ' thank God, I am under the protection of the British Government and she will not allow her subjects to be oppressed.' His title to protection was in both cases tacitly accepted by the i sk: local authority and action taken in pursuance of that title. A claim in his name is included among a number of others, preferred by British subjects after the recapture of Lingah, in the list of cases submitted to His Majesty's Legation in August 1905, as outstanding against the Persian Government. |W11| dsiii lis WiiE I aft P.

I have the honour to refer to paragraph 3 of my letter No. 2794, dated 29th November 1906, on the subject of the Abu Musa Concession^ in which I mentioned that I was taking steps to ascertain what Hassan Samaiyeh meant when he said that he had ' purchased the Chief of Shargah's share ' in it. I have since received further news from the Eesidency Agent at Lingah. 2. It will be remembered that the original Concession was granted by Salim bin Sultan on 10th April 1898 during Sheikh Sagar's absence. On the latter's return from Mecca he evidently claimed to become a partner m the concern, and was admitted as such by the others; but a few months later he transferred his interest in it to one Yusuf bin Abdullah, who, again, was eventually bought out by Hassan Samaiyeh in December 1900. Copies of the three documents setting forth the transfers are appg^ed with translations. 3. I also forward a copy of the original Concession of 1898, as desired in Foreign Department telegram No. S.-178, dated 14th instant. In submitting it I have to request that in the translation which I furnished with my letter No. 2794 of 29th ultimo the word ' mensem ' may be altered to ' annum. The latter word is correctly given in the translation of 1898 on my record, and that fact must account for my not having noticed the clerical error when despatching my letter just quoted. 4. The conduct of the Besidency Agent at Shargah in connection with this Concession does not appear to me blameless from the first; and although he heard of the deal with Herr Wonckhaus from Hassan Samaiyeh himselt in June last he made no report of it to me; I shall, however, address Crovem- ment later in this connection if circumstances call for it. ■ . ; /-/, - v , . . ■ ■ 7-. . w c, ■ ■ , . . • ■ -Translations of 3 documents T ik ■ L# ' fi kju ' The object of writing this documentary agreement is that we, the persons in mentioned in this agreement, have admitted Sheikh Suggar bin Khaled as a ■OV; partner in the Concession of the lease of red oxide mines at Abu Musa Island ' ' which we have leased from Sheikh Salem bin Qnltan at 250 dollars per •\i. annum plus 100 dollars on account of ground rent for landing Muhar and i,; 1 Zenni oysters, should we land any at Abu Musa Island for trade purposes.

Cox, C, I. E. f Political Resident In the Persian Gulf# Bushlre • Dated Port William, the February ,1907. Sir, I am directed to address you with reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No.3052, dated the 16th December 1906, regarding the acquisition by Herr Wonckhaus of rights In regard to the red oxide deposits at Abu Musa* 2. You consider that, as It Is politically Important to prevent the acquisition by Oeimany of vested Interests In the Gulf, an attempt should be made to extinguish the concession which has been grant ed to Herr Wonckhaus by Hajl Hassan Samalyeh. You pointpoint out that, in view of the advlco given to the Truolal Sheikhs In time past by the Residency, warning them against the grant of monopolies without reference to Bushlre, the fact that an unlimited monopoly has been granted would afford the sheikh reasonable grounds for cancelling the concession. You also suggest that# If the Sheikh agrees to cancel the concession. It would be unnecessary for him to Introduce any reference to the Instructions or advice received from the Residency, since, as the original concession provided no time limit on either side, there is nothing to pre vent the Sheikh from withdrawing it at will. 3. The Government of India are disposed to agree with you that,as Abu Musa would form a convenient site for a coaling station in the Persian Gulf, and as the Germans have paid special attention to this island,it would be advisable , if possible,to secure, at an early date,the cancelletlon of the monopoly obtained by Herr Fonckhaus. They consider that the concession should not have been granted,having regard to the advice which was given to the Truclal Chiefs in 1898,on the subject of the grant of monopolies and to the special warning which m*..* ■ -1 'i Htm in' 1 '*which was conveyed to the Sheikh and his uncle In February 1905, to the effect that no agreement should be made with Herr Wonckhaus with regard to the red oxide mines at Abu Musa• I am accordingly to request that you will ascer- tain from the Sheikh of shargah whether Hassan Samalyeh had any authority from him to enter Into the contract with Herr wonckhaus, and, If so, why toe acted In this matter In contravention of the known wishes of the Government of India* The Sheikh should be reminded , In this connection of the fact that, but for the action i of the British Government at Abu Musa In requiring the Persians to haul down their flag, the concession could I never have been worked, as the Sheikh would have had no authority on the Island. The Government of India would be glad to Know the result of this reference to ■ the Sheikh and also of the advice which,It Is under- stood, you have offered to Esa bin Abdul Latlf In re gard to his share In the original concession.Should the Sheikh show no disposition to annul the concession, and should the attempt to obtain the cancellation of the agreement with Herr Wonckhaus through Esa bin AbdulAbdul Latlf prove abortive,the poaltlon will need to be further considered and the Oovernment of India will be glad to receive your advice as to the action to be taken In that event. But It Is hoped that means may be found through one or other of the channels suggested to render the agreement with Herr Wonckhaus Inoperative* 4. In the meantime It Is particularly desirable that no buildings or wharves should be constructed at Abu Musa without the consent of the Oovemment of India.

In view of the distinct warning given to the Sheikh they are of opinion that Concession should not have been granted. 'They ask that you -should find out from the Sheikh whether he gave Hassan Samaiyeh authority tq enter into a contract with the ~'ermans and if so why he did so in contraven- tion of the known wishes of the ■'■'ovem inent of India. They request that you should remind the SheiJ&amp;i that it is due only to our insisting on the Per sians hauling down their flag that he has authority on Abu ilusa. In the event of no disposition being shown by the Sheikh to annul the Concession and in the event of the attempt to obtain through Ssa a cancellation of the agreement with ''onckhaus failing, the position will require further consi deration and your advice as to the action to be taken in that event is asked fdr by the Government oi mdia.

I beg to be favoured with the views or wishes of Crovernment on this subject at an early date. 3. It is probable that Messrs. R 0. Strick and Company would be glad, to obtain facilities for exporting the red oxide of Abu Musa and their acquisi tion of a footing there would no doubt strengthen their hands in dealing with the Moin -et-Tujjar in connection with the Hormuz mines. They would pre sumably wish under ordinary circumstances to negotiate through their agents at Bushire, Messrs. Malcolm and Company, but the form and conditions to be adopted in any agreement entered into by them or a n y other British Birm and the lines on which we are to proceed are questions of manifest importance in the present case having regard to the possible contingency of the Germau Foreign Office interesting themselves in Herr Wonckhaus' venture; and for this reason, and in view of tbe committal of his interests to us on the part of Sheikh Sagar, it is clearly advisable that we should take steps to make sure that any arrangement now brought about will effectively safeguard for the future the interests both of the Sheikh of Shargah and of British Trade. _ How this end can best be achieved is a question for the consideration of Government, 4. The letter (enclosure 2) from the Sheikh of Shargah to Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh was given by tbe former to Bsa bin Abdul Latif for delivery to him and has been sent by Esa with a private note to his friend, the Besidency Agent at Lingab, asking him to deliver it to Hassan Ali and take his receipt for it. I shall receive in due course a separate report of the fact of its reaching its destination, and have tbe honour to request the advice of the Government of India as to whether in view of Sheikh Sagar's intimation to me in his letter of 9th Moharrum (21st Eebruary), I should then take any official steps through the Besidency Agent at Lingab, to let Ha.ji Hassan know that the Sheikh has apprised me of his decision, or to assure myself that he takes action on it. Eor the present, until I receive further instructions, I shall let matters rest where they are. 5. It will be noted that the Sheikh of Shargah in his letter to Hassan Samaiyeh informs him of the annulment of the contract from date of receipt of his communication; but it may of course be taken for granted that practically speaking there will be nothing to prevent Haji Hassan from disposing of what red oxide he may have on hand or from letting Mr. Wonckhaus ship it, until Government have had an opportunity of intimating their views on this point or until a new concessionaire appears on the scene. There need be no question therefore of immediate hardship or of the parties being unable to avail themselves of red oxide already mined or paid for.Purport of a letter from E sa bin A bdul L atif t6 S heikh S agar bin K haltd, Chief of Shargah, dated 8tli Moharrum 1325 (20th February 1907). After compliments. —I have to communicate with your honour with reference to the lease which I and two partners acquired from the Government of Shargah relating to the extraction of red oxide from your island of Abu Musa. As your honour is aware the document of lease was drawn up in the names of three persons namely your humble servant. Esa bin Abdul Latif Haji Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh and Abdulla bin Hassan Samaiyeh. I have come to know that on 1st June 1906 (8th Eabi-ul-Thani 1324) the said Haji Hassan entered into a contract with a European merchant named Wonckhaus, without consulting me, and that according to the terms of the document he bound himself and his partners in giving an absolute monopoly for the extraction of the red oxide for a period of four years. And the said Haji Hassan executed this agreement and bound himself without consulting me previous to the drawing of the deed of contract. The details of the said deed have only now reached me, and I do not agree to the terms of this contract. Accordingly I forward to your honour a copy of the deed of contract for you to examine; kindly look into it. I beg from your honour assistance in taking the necessary steps for the cancellation and annulment of this contract, for I am altogether unwilling to agree to this lease. Previous to this I have written to Haji Hassan Samaiyeh expressing my disagreement to this contract, but he has sent me no answer. Finally I am obliged to call your attention to the deed of contract in the beginning of which begins as follows: ' Contract between Haji Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh of Lingah owner and holder of the Abu Musa Concession, and Mr. Eobert 'Wonckhaus of Lingah.' Now Haji Hassan Samaiyeh has no deed of authority from me giving him any general power in regard to action which he might take respecting the lease, etc.: how then has Haii Hassan .1,1-11 . • £ • w. -j , . • : A-- _ V right thus to mention hnnself only without consulting or referring jto^ i Of T TT * T 1 • T i i partners of whom I am one. 1 am in consequence obliged to make a com- 1 • i ii , . 1 V *i« /» plaint on the subject to your honour, and it is for your honour to issue ■ Jrn j Tran-lation of a letter dated 9th Moharrum 1325 (21st February 1907) from Sheihh S agar bin Khalid , Sheikh of Shargah^ to Haji Hassan bin Ali Samaiyeh.

He has sent me a copy of the deed of contract in operation between you and Mr. 'Wonckhaus and complains that you executed this contract without consulting him and that he does not agree to the conditions written in the contract now that he has come to know them. I too do not agree to this contract at all, and as for you, you had no right to give a contract in this fashion and bind yourself to give away possession of the whole of the output of red oxide mines to others, for a long period and without consulting us or making the slightest reference to us.

Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident m the Persian Gulf. After compliments. —I am obliged to address your honour in the following connection. On 18th of the month of Zilkaideh 1315 (10th April 1898) a contract was concluded between us and three persons namely Hassan bin Ali Satnaiyeh and Abdullah bin Hassan and Esa bin Abdul Latif, for the lease of the red oxide mines in our Island of Abu Musa, and the basis of the contract was a yearly one; they were to pay us a sum of 250 dollars annually. Up to now we have not experienced anything prejudicial from them and have been taking from them every year the amount of the rent; and the parties mentioned have themselves been dealing with the work. But as it appears a short time ago something took place which we consider to be harmful to us; and eoclosed in this letter we send your honour a copy of the letter which has reached us from Esa bin Abdul Latif, who is one of the partners, the purport of which is that he complains of the action taken by Haji Hassan Samaiyeh and sends us a translation of a deed of contract wrongfully passed by Haji Hassan Samaiyeh to the merchant named Wonckhaus. We are apprehensive of the results of such a contract and do not ']agree to it, and for this reason we have decided upon the withdrawal of our document (of concession) from the said lessees and its annulment. And whereas Haji Hassan Samaiyeh is a subject of the British Govern ment we forward to your honour a copy of the letter which we have written to the said Haji Hassan for your information. In conclusion we beg you to consult the Imperial Government and request their views as to the best means of assuring to us in future the full benefits from the red oxide mines within our territory, (We will act) :::; according to your view.

The Political Resident in his letter No. 456, dated 28th February 1907) stated that, on ascertaining the terms of the contract which had been entered into with Herr Wonckhaus, both the Sheikh and the concessionaire Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, were unwilling that it should stand. Ultimately, the Sheikh decided, in view of Hassan Ali Samaiyeh's unauthorised action, to withdraw the concession from the three concessionaires, and intimated that he desired to make fresh provisions for the working of the red oxide mines under the advice of the Government of India. 5. On 21st May the Political Resident telegraphed that the Sheikh had taken active steps to prevent further mining operations by the concessionaires' men, and that Messrs. Strick, the British lessees of the Hormuz red oxide mines seemed inclined to commence negotiations with a view to the purchase of Abu Musa oxide. We considered it undesirable, however, that the rights of which Herr Wonckhaus had been dispossessed should simultaneously be transferred to Messrs, Strick, as such an arrangement might create a false impression, that the Sheikh's action had been inspired by us with a view to benefit the British merchant. We therefore replied to Major Cox that Messrs. Strick's Bushire Agent should be asked to inform his principals that it would be convenient if they deferred any action with regard to the Abu Musa mines for the present. 6. We trust that you approve the action taken by us in the matter, and, if so, we venture to suggest that Messrs. Strick should be advised to post pone bringing into force till the end of the current year, any contract that they may contemplate making with the Sheikh of Shargah. We may add that the Political Resident has been instructed to be careful to assume no responsibility for action already taken by the Sheikh, and he has advised the latter to show him the draft of any new contract which it may be proposed to grant in place of the old concession. We have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servants, MINTO. KITCHENER. H. ERLE RICHARDS. E. N. BAKER. C. H. SCOTT. H. ADAMSON. J. E. EINLAY. (Signed) 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 J. 0.

The reccomendation made by the Agent is to mov® the Persian GovJ;; to prevent its subjects entering and working in territory belonging to a Foreign Ohief contrary to the desire of the latter.

Sir E. Grey will observe that the Concession under which 4 certain Arabs had granted a lease, amounting to a monopoly to Herr Wonckhaus has been cancelled by the Sheikh of Shargah, and that to avoid misconceptions which might arise if the rights enjoyed by Herr Wonckhaus should be at once transferred to Messrs. Strick, that firm have been asked through their local agents to defer anjr action with regard to the Abu Musa mines for the present* I As regards future arrangements it will be seen that the Government of India think that the Sheikh should not be allowed to grant any monopoly and that he should be advistd to submit to the Political Resident the draft of any new contract Li into which he may propose to enter. SubjectSubject to Sir K. Orey -a concurrence Mr. uCli pro p0 s es to approve the action proposed by the Goveriment of India, and to request then not to sanction any concession which the Sheikh nay propose to grant without reporting the natter hone, with rtftrtMceto «ny change that nay have occurred in the local circumstances, and any representations that nay have been received from Herr Wonckhaus. Messrs. Strick may at the same time be requested as suggested by the Government of India to postpone, at any rate until the end of the current year, action under any contract they may contemplate negotiating with the Sheikh for Oxide from the Abu Musa mines. n I have, etc# f ScU A # Godley* The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.If?

It will tiien be advisable for '1 „ f-y - wie oiieikh to leave for the present a small guard of armed m man on the island to prevent any attempt at re-occupying it. r ou snould be careful to see that the notice signed by the Sheikh is a literal copy of the draft forwarded, and that no time is lost in despatching the notice to Lingah.

To The R ight H on'ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., His Majesty's Simla, the 27th June 190?. Sib, We have the honour to forward a copy of the correspondence detailed in the annexed list on the subject of the red oxide deposits at Abu Musa island, belonging to the Sheikh of Shargah. 2. In 1898 the Sheikh granted a lease of the red oxide mines to one Enclosure No. s. ^ Hassau-bin-A li Samaiyeh, a resi dent of Lmgah, his son Abdulla and a third person Esa-bin-Abdul Latif. In December 1904, on the strength of a report from the British Agent at Lingah to the effect that Herr Robert Wonckhaus, the representative of a German firm in Bahrein, had contemplated visiting Abu Musa with a view to taking up the export of red oxide, the Sheikh of Shargah and the concessionaires were specifically warned by the Political Resident against entering into any agreement with the trader in question for * Vide enclosures to letter from Sir W.

Samaiyeh, claiming to act for his two partners, enteredf into a' contract with Herr Wonckhaus granting to the latter a monopoly of purchase of the output of the red oxide mined on the island for four years, with preferential option to renew the contract at the end of that period. 3. When reporting the circumstances connected with the execution of the contract, Major Cox urged that, in view of the political importance of prevent ing the acquisition by Germany of vested rights in the Gulf, an attempt should he made to extinguish the concession which had been secured by Herr Wonckhaus. The Government of India agreed with Major Cox as to the desir- 1 Bnciosnre No 8 abilit y of S ettill S th0 monopoly cancelled, 4» JUUiaublUe -LMU. O* 1J1 1 • 1 and they accordingly requested? him to ascertain from the Sheikh of Shargah whether Hassan Samaiyeh had any authority from him to enter into the contract with Herr Wonckhaus, and, if so, why he had acted in this matter in contravention of the known wishes of the ,. . Government of India. Major Cox was am, 1904 (c C nciosnr 0 e re t« n iftfef' fram^tbo's^e- also instructed to remind the Sheikh 1)epartuieDt ' India0ffice ' No - 31 &gt; dated that, but for the action of the BritishS the 29th July 1904). „ ' 5 Government m insisting upon the removal oi the Persian flag from Abu Musa, the Sheikh would have had no authority on the island, and the concession could never have been worked. Major Cox was requested in replying, also to report the result of the advice which it was understood that he had already offered to Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, the third partner in the concession.4. The Political Resident in his letter No. 456, dated 28th February 1907, stated that, on ascertaining the terms of the contract which had been entered into with Herr Wonckhaus, both the Sheikh and the concessionaire, Esa-bin-Abdul Latif, were unwilling that it should stand. Ultimately, the Sheikh decided, in view of Hassan Ali Samaiyeh's unauthorised action, to withdraw the concession from the three concessionaires, and intimated that he desired to make fresh provisions for the working of the red oxide mines under the advice of the Government of India. 5. On 21st May the Political Resident telegraphed that the Sheikh had taken active steps to prevent further mining operations by the concessionaires' men, and that Messrs. Strick, the British lessees of the Hormuz red oxide mines seemed inclined to commence negotiations with a view to the purchase of Abu Musa oxide. We considered it undesirable, however, that the rights of which Herr Wonckhaus had been dispossessed should simultaneously be transferred to Messrs. Strick, as such an arrangement might create a false impression, that the Sheikh's action had been inspired by us with a view to benefit the British merchant. We therefore replied to Major (Jox that Messrs. Strick's Bushire Agent should be asked to inform his principals that it would be convenient if they deferred any action with regard to the Abu Musa mines for the present. 6. We trust that you approve the action taken by us in the matter, and, if so, we venture to suggest that Messrs. Strick should be advised to post pone bringing into force till the end of the current year, any contract that they may contemplate making with the Sheikh of Shargah. We may add that the Political Resident has been instructed to be careful to assume no responsibility for action already taken by the Sheikh, and he has advised the latter to show him the draft of any new contract which it may be proposed to grant in place of the old concession. We have the honour to be, S ir, Your most obedient, humble servants, (Signed) MINTO. KITCHENER. „ H. ERLE RICHARDS. u E. N. BAKER. „ C. H. SCOTT. H. ADAMSON. „ J. F.

Sir E. Grey will observe that the Concession under which certain Arabs had granted a lease, amounting to a monopoly, to Herr Wonckhaus has been cancelled by the Sheikh of Shargah, and that to avoid miscon ceptions which might arise if the rights enjoyed by Herr Wonckhaus should be at once transferred to Messrs. Strick, that firm have been asked through their local agents to defer any action with regard to the Abu Musa mines for the present. 3. As regards future arrangements, it will be seen that the Govern ment of India think that the Sheikh should not be allowed to grant any monopoly, and that he should be advised to submit to the Political Resident the draft of any new contract into which he may propose to enter. 4. Subject to Sir E. Grey's concurrence Mr. Morley proposes to approve the action proposed by the Government of India, and to request them not to sanction any concession which the Sheikh may propose to grant without reporting the matter home, with reference to any change that may have occurred in the local circumstances, and any repre sentations that may have been received from Herr Wonckhaus.

Lieutenant. Assistant Resident and H.B.M's Consul, Bunder Abbas. Ievident later when xm inrortr.ad n© tl^t one of ti-e Concessional -ea, iibdulla bin Hassan, Lad arrived In Shargali and Lad Landed aim a letter (copy enclosed Lerewlth) from Messrs, WonoMiaus* LingaL /^ent. He asked what reply he sLould send and wLat should say to Abdul la bin Hassan who was constantly worrying bin. I advised him not to reply to the Geman's letter and to tell Abdul la tLat Le Lad only issued tLe notice after careful consideration and tLat Le intended that it sLould be fully obeyed, as the SiieiLL appeared to apprehend that ti.e latter ' /as wr ^^ 9n instance of the CJenaan Clovenmient, I ssm fit to disabuse Lim and to point out tiiat it was written by a aermn sercixant only. SheilcL Sagar then asked what Le sLould do as regards the Oxide lying on tLe beach in tLe event of a German ship arriving: at Abu Musa, as ho feared that his guard migLt shoot someone, should the ship persist in loading. Being uncertain of Government * s views as regards allowing Hessrs. V /onoMiaus to corplate ssx\yexisting orders they may Lave for 1 -xide, I avoided giving a direct reply, merely renarking that i -. r ltL the emulsion of the labourers from the Island, a ship could not very well load, but that in any case, uncalled for violence on the part of tLe guard sLould be avoided in the absence of any attempt to re-occupy the Oxide colony, which latter contingency should be carefully ruarded against by leaving a force of at least 50 men there for a stontL or six weeks. TLe Sheikh acquiesced and added tliat Le would be carefiil to refer to BusLire should he receive furtiier cosinunications . . . ' from the Gertoan firs.' 2 V •. '• * ' / 11 *» b. • Hearing that I was at the British Agency on tLe j » f ' . ' 1 i • morning of the 19tL., Sheikh Sagar with Lis uncle, Salira bin Sultan, again called on me. The Sheikh appears to place much reliance on the sagacity and natured wisdom of his aged relat- ~ive and sensed anxious to engage hin in conversation with me, in order to extract soire sort of promise of support in the event of his action at Abu Husa involving him in diffioultlesi / [ but being ; aware of his evident intention, I was careful not to cocnit cys'elf to any compromising statement. 6. i returned the Sheikh's visit at his house on theevening of tba 19th.October and told iiizn that I regretted not to have otoearved any preparations for tlia despatch of his force# I reminded hla that only IS hours renalned ere the period stated In tiie notice would expire and that as it was, it would only be possible for his dhows to reach the island in time, by being towed most of the way by H.K.S,'Lapwing'. Evidently i'-spir-j 1 by fear instilled by Abdul3a bin Hassan, wlr I was told had been worrying the Sheikh all day, the Sheiki. seemed Inclined to hold bscit and su^^ested waiting a few days in tiie hope that lie could come to an understanding witli the Concessionaire. Upon this I advised him to act fully up to his notice and urged that half measures at this stage would be worse than useless. I reminded him that but for Qovernmant*® action a few years ago, he would have lost Abu riusa altogether and that in the present case, be had asked Government's advise as to how to proceed and had acted upon it to a point where to draw back would in all probability materially weaken Lis hold on the Island. At the sane tine, I told Mm that having tender- -ed him this advice, I must ask him to say at once whether he intended to abide by it or not, as in the latter eventuality \ His I'Majesty's Ship could not delay longer and it would simply remain for me to inform Government that he was not desirous of proceeding further. Ihe Sheikh then said that he would po through with the business and would at onoe prepare the force for despatch and would refuse to see Abclulla bin Hassan again. The latter, seeing that the Shaikh was at last firm, left for Debal the same evening. 7, The 'Lapwing' sailed for Abu Husa at daybreak on the 80th•October and towed the Sheikh's 4 buggalows and two hired boats for the transport of the Oxide labourers, to within r ' ' : i . 4 miles of the Island. Having warned Abdul la bin Ahmed bin • ■ '' \ ■ ' \ ' ' ' -.4 ' ' ■ 1 X. Sultan : (the ■SheiMi's cousin, who was in charge of the armed force) against the use of unnecessary violence, I proceeded to the Concessions^lre's encampment and while warning AH namalyeh ( the Concessionaire' s brother and local representat- -ive) of 'the approach of the force, told him tiaat he had noth- •'■irsg to fear provided he at once obeyed the Sheikh s criers#Til© a.itiOu party tjiiQn la^iclscl att* djlffopsnt# pointrs on t#2'iQ Is3 •' jxcl and s jwo unded t/Lo caxap, Piiq f7oncQS8ionalx*8' 3 ropsTesantat/lve SJid. -rorianen w®i*© oosfsci flmd sttj one© oonsont/Qd ijo l©s.v© • -• Owinp: 'to t»ii© iilgii wind and consoqusnt. h©avy sea prwv&amp;i 1 inp;f inniQdiat© ©jsljarica'td.on was impoosjL'bl© and for tj.© resaainder of tiie day and t&amp;e greator part of -t}.© Slat,, tli© coolies were enployed in packing up and collecting tte mining property on tli© 'beacli.

I should have desiif- t -ed to have remained at Abu Tlusa pending the ramo^ral of this f property, but to do so was out of the question, the 'Lapwing^ • if f -I. having run Short of provisions and stores ol kind. In these oircufflstances, I despatched SSsa bin Abdul Latii, who i ad accompanied me from SLargah, with instructions to the Residency Agent that he should advise the Sheikh to send two more buggal- —ows for the transport of the remaining property.

I venture to think, however, that ©van allowing then to base their claia on the terns of their illegal contract with Hassan bin Ali Ssmaiy- -eh, they would have soma difficulty in substantiating it, while the clais to the cines and the concession for their: as security for advances paid, can scarcely be considered serious- -ly.

You are aware that we have contracted with the above firm a large quantity of Oxide for a number of years and lave paid over to them very considerable advances. We beg to inform you that the Oxide lying on the seashore in Abu Musa is our property and tliat we consider the mines and the concession for them as a security for the advances paid. If you force Messrs. Plage Hassan bin Ali Somey &amp; Oo. to withdraw their coolies and representative, we shall Lave to send over some men ourselves to protect our property. we contracted for a quantity of Oxide with the mention- -ed firm, knowing that their leasehold is a 'bonafide one', it would be idle on your part to dispute this as you yourself were a partner to it in the beginning and sold your si,are to Hassan bin Ali. Hie relative documents still exist. ^ y -H We therefore take the liberty to advise you to withdraw your notice and abstain from further interference in the working of the oxide mines in Abu Musa.
