SECRET C/V The Adviser, The Government of Bahrain, BAHRAIN. Re: Eric Thomas George COLE, British Subject, employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Co., Ltd., Awali, Bahrain. I have to report for your information and such action as you may consider necessary, the following : - Eric Thomas George COLE, British Subject, born at Portsmouth on 30th November, 1912, is at present employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Co., Ltd., in the Shipping Department. Information has come to my knowledge from an unimpeachable source that Cole has openly shown pro-German and anti British sentiments. From enquiries made, it appears he spent a good deal of his life in Northern Ireland, but is pro-Eire. He has openly said that in this war, he joined the forces to oppose the Italians and not the Germans, the latter being the financiers of Eire in opposing Great Britain, Eire in return rendering valuable help to Germany in her war with Britain, with which, he, Cole, heartily approved. He has also shown an interest in whether or not the British Police in Bahrain are associated with security matters : I have ascertained the following details concerning Cole : - Eric Thomas George COLE, British Subject. Born Portsmouth 30.11. , 12, height 5'7 M , eyes Hazel, Hair Black. National Service Registration No. AKN - 3022/109. Holds British Passport No. 391089, issued le.l.^T, expires 16.1. 1 52.

Following my reply to you of 9th March about the appointment of an Oil Inspector at Bahrein, Lepper saw Beeby Thompson here on the 14 th March and his views are recorded below :- 'Thompson has had no previous experience in the measurement and sampling of crude oil. He has, however, had a sound engineering training and has been associated with oil industry activities for 15 years. His Trinidad experience included much work in connection with oil tankers. I went over the list of duties with Thompson and stressed the fact that, apart from the purely technical aspects, the post would call for the exercise of tact in dealing with am American Company. He said that he had worked with Americans for many years and got on well with them. I am opinion that Thompson’s training and exper ience will enable him to pick up the work very quickly, and that if he is given the appointment he will make good'. This confirms Hague's opinion that Beeby Thompson would be suitable for the job.

Eventually I consulted Mr. kxak Beeby Thompson, head of a firm of Consulting 'Engineers which deals with oil and water projects, he recommended a nephew of his, G.B. Thompson, who is a trained engineer and was employed at Washington on the control of oilfield machinery, he was for several years in Trinidad working in the oilfields there. I discussed the matter with Harrison, at the India Office to whom I wrote about Thompson just before I left. Thompson was returning to England in February and I now hear that he is due to arrive, or by now has arrived in the U.

TV T: ' | vvf ? £? ? f m Could you help us in connection with our endeavours to obtain the services of an Englis h kedical Practitioner in Bahrain? As far back as August last we had determined upon the engage ment of a Dr. Perfect for the post. He is, 1 understand, a young mqn who has reached the stage of House Surgeon. The Central Medical War Committee stepped in and nothing further has been possible. No objection has been taken by any Authority to Dr. Perfect serving The Bahrein Petrol eum Company either on the ground that he is to be cans crib ed for war ser vice or on any other ground. Accordingly, the difficulty seems to be one of procedure. The Cou^any have gone to some trouble in selecting Dr. Perfect and they feel that he will meet their requirements and it is un likely that they would change their mind following applications from other Practitioners resulting frem advertisements directed by the Central k e dical Par Committee. There is the point of view that Dr. Perfect having done no war service should nav do his turn and so release an older man for the job. Against that is the fact that it is a young man’s task; the Company do not want an older man. This policy of recruiting young m&amp;i for the Services in order to release older men is not, in actual fact, beir^ applied throughout various professions anu trades and, therefore, from a Ministerial point of view an objection on these grounds to the engagement of Dr. Perfect by the Bahrein Company could hardly be sustained. The passage of time has made this matter one of urgency and it has occurred to me to appeal to you for help, an appeal I would have avoided had I been able to do so, because I know you are very heavily engaged on other ana more important work.

Our people were a little unwilling to agree to the transfer because they are already having considerable difficulty in finding people for Bahrein (and Abadan), however, they have agreed to support Hopper’s transfer provided that the Company does not come to us with a request for a replacement. Yours sincerely, M F./ Harrison, India Office Whitehall, LONDON, S.W.General OFFICE: 149, KINGSWAY, PETTS WOOD, K^NT. T£ l E p h o N e VO R P I N G T O N 747/8/9 The Bahreit Cliffords Inn, Fleet Street, London, E.C.4. 16th March, 1945 * Dear Peel By way of a change, I want to help cue of this Company’s men to leave Bahrein for work in the United States. He is C.R.P.Hopper, now occupying the position of Production Foreman; he is in charge of all the wells - rather an important post. He was one of the two Englishmen the first to go to Bahrein to workundeijbhe Company’s Con cession; Hie other was Sisson, who did not stayvery long. Hopper is a Mining SJnglneer by profession: he has been a first-class servant throughout - thoroughly trustworthy, diligent and intelligent. Sane few years ago, the Standard Oil Company of California wanted Hopper to go to California for additional technical training and experience, but the war intervened and put an end to that. During the early days of the war, Hopper helped a great deal to calm the restiveness of the other Englishmen who, as you may remember, nearly all wanted to come home to fight. This I arranged with him just before he returned to Bahrein from his ’’heme' leave early in 1941. He is again home on leave. Early in 1944 the Bahrein Company’s office in New York offered to transfer Hopper to Louisiana for work of a supervisory nature on drill ing wells with continuous service, in which he could gain further exper ience of the Petroleum Industry and so pave the way to his further advance his opportunities for advancement in Bahrein being now, I understand, somewhat limited. This offer Hopper was and is anxious to accept. The Political Agent at Bahrein was informed of the desires of the parties and in response, appears to have written to the Company a letter reading:- 'If your Company is prepared to release Mr. Hopper, it is considered that owing to the shortage of experienced engineers with British Oil Companies operating abroad, te should offer his services to a British Company at least for the duration of the war. Should Mr. Hopper be unwilling to take this action and your Company desires to dispense with his services, he will'be given the choice between joining a British Company and Military Service but if you desire to retain him with a view to his going to -America after the war, no objection will be raised. If Mr. Hopper likes to transfer to a British Cami P4C pany, the Petroleum Division have offered, on receipt 0 f ^ r - particulars of his age, qualifications, experience, whether married or not, and his preference with regard to location (that is Middle Bast or South i^merica) to put him in touch with a British Company.' The Company desire to retain Mr. Hopper’s services and he de sires to remain with the Company. Twelve months have elapsed and the end of the war with Gemany appears to be in sight. Mr. Hopper mentioned the matter to me recently and, having regard to Hopper’s long service abroad and his loyalty and usefulness to the Bahrein Petroleum Company in Bahrein during the war years, I told him I would see what could be done to help him to seme thing better. It would probably be much more to his advantage to take up now a position in the United States similar to that offered to him a short while ago because, for one thing, local competition could not be so keen now as undoubtedly it will be after the war. &lt; ^ Having regard to Mr. Hopper’s long, loyal and useful service in the development of a Colony under British influence in^dire financial straits, and also having regard to the fact that he has reJdii^^Sble aid m keeping calm the troublesome English employees in Bahrein at a time when there was no power of compelling them to remain in Bahrein and to the fact that the war v/ith Germany appears to be drawing to a* close, Could not Mr. Hopper now be released so that he might proceed from London to the States for employment there and so gain advantages he has truly earned and which otherwise might be lost to him? If the matter could be furthered by my coming to see you you have only, of course, to let me knew by telephone and I will arrange to do so.

Dear Mr. Lumby, I duly received your letter of the 7th Instant, Reference EXT. 5918/42., regarding Mr. Hannaford. I am making enquiries and will write you again as soon as possible. Yours sincerely. S.W.R.Lumby Esq., India Office, 'Whitehall, S.W.l.-18th Ilovonber, 1942. re: J. P. Hannaford. I have now received the following information from the Company vdiich enables me to reply to your letter of the 7th instant, as follows:- ^ (a) Hr. Hannaford is not at present in the employ of this Company. (b) The Company have no i:formation as to his present whereabouts. The Company have passed on the following information which might also be of interest to you:- Hannaford was recruited by the Company in April 1937 and was in the service of the Company until June 1940, vAien he proceeded on leave to South ^frida to join his wife, who had already gone there. Before proceeding on leave he was advised that the Bahrein Company would like to have him return to Bahrein for a further period of service. This decision was, however, eitered in view of the fact that the Political Authorities in Bahrein stated that they would rather not have the Hannaforcs return to Bahrein, although they would withdraw their objections if the Company would guarantee the conduct of the Hannafords. As the Company could not give such a guarantee, Haimaford was in formed, through the medium of Caltex (Africa) Ltd. that he could not be offered further employment in Bahrein. In March 1941 the question of Hannaford’s return was again taken up with the Political Authorities, and at that time they said they had no objection to Hannaford returning, but would prefer that Mrs. Hannaford did not return to Bahrein. Apparently, one or two rather foolish actions on Mrs.Harmaford’s part did give rise to some doubts as to her loyalty to the Brit ish Gove oniment. (Both the Hannafords are Irish). The last address 1 that the Company have any record of is care of Caltex (Africa) Ltd., in Durban.X hope the foregoing will give you the information you require, but if not, and you will let me know, I will do what I can to help you. j^rely, E.V/.R.Lumby Esq. , India Office, Whitehall, •b • w«X.Any reply to this letter should be addressed to the U&amp;KK Secretary foXJSHMlHXIQ- Telephone: Abbey 903C.

Complete copies of the rosters are present for the following periods only: the first quarter of 1941 (dated 31 March 1941), and the four quarters of 1947 (dated 31 March 1947, 30 June 1947, 30 September 1947, and 31 December 1947 respectively). For the intervening period (i.e. April 1941 through to December 1946) only copies of tabular summaries of the rosters are present.The complete rosters include employees' names as well as other details such as date of employment, nationality, designation (e.g. labourer), and department (e.g. refinery). The tabular summaries show the total number of employees on the company's payroll, with sub-totals for nationalities and various other categories (e.g. clerical and technical, skilled, and unskilled).A significant amount of related correspondence is also included in the file. Alongside the rosters and roster summaries are copies of covering letters from the Political Agent to the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain, which contain brief comments regarding the contents of the rosters (usually remarks about any increases or decreases in the number of employees during the quarterly period, as well as a breakdown of the number of employees by nationalities).Also covered in the correspondence are matters relating to existing or prospective BAPCO employees, including the following: arrangements for the transfer of a longstanding BAPCO employee from Bahrain to the United States; BAPCO's wish to appoint a young English doctor named Dr A J Perfect, and its appeal to the India Office for assistance in this matter; the appointment in 1946 of an engineer named George Beeby Thompson as oil inspector to the Government of Bahrain.Other notable correspondents besides the Political Agent include the following: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain; Hamilton R Ballantyne, representative of BAPCO; officials of the India Office, the Commonwealth Relations Office, and the Ministry of Fuel and Power, Petroleum Division.The file includes a divider which gives the subject number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references by year.
