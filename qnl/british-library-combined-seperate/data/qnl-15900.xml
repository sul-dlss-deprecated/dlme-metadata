He writes that Sheil requested him to add any observations or remarks which he may have and transmit them to Stephenson. This letter is followed by Hennell's transcript of his letter to Stephenson, dated 3 September 1850. In the attached letter, Hennell states that he has little acquaintance with the subject of railways, but he raises a number of issues including geographic, economic and political considerations.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023651902.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
