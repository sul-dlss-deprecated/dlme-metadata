The correspondence is between Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, the Political Agency in Bahrain, Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, India Office, Office of the Accountant General (Central Revenues Department of the Government of India), and the Chief Constable's Office in Birmingham.The papers are mostly routine in nature and concern the payment of the salaries and pension contributions of the police officers. Some of the correspondence discusses how these payments should be made - direct to the councils and police forces in Britain or via the India Office - and deals with questions over accounts.Folios 145-57 are internal office notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Central Revenues Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Police management</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000028#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000028#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000028#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
