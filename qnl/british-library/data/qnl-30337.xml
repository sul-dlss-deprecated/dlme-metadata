This memorandum is being simultaneously submitted on another file. According to the memorandum all the evidence gathered in Saudi Arabia by the Legation and 2730 1000 4.34 corroborated /corroborated by the opinion of the Naval Authorities in the Red Sea and of the British authorities at Jibuti and Aden, is to the effect that the Red Sea slave traffic is practically at a standstill. If this is true, Sir George Maxwell’s 'conservative” estimate that 500 slaves were shipped last year from Africa to Arabia is very wide of the mark. The sensational figure of 5,000 mentioned by Sir George Maxwell as having been given 'on good authority” by the Naval correspondent of the 'Daily Telegraph” in a recent article seems quite impossible, if the estimate of 40,000 for the total number of slaves in Saudi Arabia, said to be declining, is even approximately correct. With regard to Sir George Maxwell’s suggestion for a distinction between 'born' and 'captive' slaves, it appears that Ibn Saud,at any rate in principle,already ma^es a not dissimilar distinction and that the vast majority of slaves in Saudi Arabia are in fact persons born in slavery or enslaved in early childhood a good many years ago- Sir Andrew Ryan is now inclined to think that Ibn Saud does realise that the traffic in newly captured slaves is undesirable and in any case the Minister does not consider that the time is ripe for any approach to the King on the basis suggested by Sir George Maxwell. He emphasises that Ibn Saud looks on this question when raised by Foreign Powers not from the ci*n. &gt; J point of view but from that of safeguarding his independence. With reference to para.11 of the Despatch, we know that Fuad Bey has already hinted in conversation with the Minister that the Saudi Government may before long be raising with us the whole question of the right of the Jeddah Legation to manumit slaves, which Ibn Saud is well known to resent as an infringement/Minute Paper.

Sir, I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch Noll^of the 21st March relative to the discussion between Mr. Rendel and Sirtieorge Maxwell on the 8th March of the contents of Sir George Maxwell s memorandum of the 22nd February on slavery in Arabia. I submit the following observations :— 2. A member of my staff, Mr. Furlonge, has been engaged for many months on a study of the slavery question, and is now on the point of completing a valuable memorandum on the subject. You may prefer to await this paper before pursuing the questions raised in the present correspondence, but, as the memorandum will take some time to type, I prefer to deal at once with the most specific questions arising out of Sir George Maxwell s memorandum, as regards Saudi Aiabia. 3. Without anticipating Mr. Furlonge’s very comprehensive review, I may sum up the more relevant results of his careful and dispassionate analysis of a oreat mass of evidence. He estimates the total number of domestic slaves in this country at a figure not exceeding 40,000. This slave population is liable to a good deal of depletion owing to slaves dying or being freed by their masters. This deple tion is compensated partly by the birth of slave children and partly by importation, but the main source of fresh supplies of imported slaves would appear to be the Yemen and they seem to consist largely of persons, whether of local or ultimate African origin, born in that country^and exported overland to Saudi Arabia. Mr. Furlonge considers that the trade across the Red t^ea is at present almost dead and doubts whether more than a few slaves have been brought across annually during the last two or three years. It is difficult to form an opinion as to the disposal of these few. Some may be absorbed by the Yemen. If any come to Saudi Arabia they probably do not come overland but are |anded from dhows, which may have crawled up the coast, on to the Asir littoral. Such landing need not necessarily take place with the connivance of the Saudi authorities in ports. Small parties might easily be landed by smugglers at other quiet spots. 4. If these conclusions are correct, they are reassuring, but Mr. Furl6n&lt;p stresses the fact that the present position is due largely and perhaps almost entirely to economic depression. This depression operates in various ways. If feaudi Arabia and Yemen be taken together as a consuming unit, it diminishes the demand for fresh supplies from across the Red Sea. It reduces the total requirements of Saudi Arabia, considered separately, but depression in the Yemen may tend, never theless, to stimulate the exportation of Yemen-bred slaves from the Yemen. 5. While economic depression is the dominant factor at present, it cannot be assumed that the action of the Saudi Government is not a contributory factor in preventing abuse. I was formerly very sceptical about this, but I am now i inclined to think that Ibn Saud, while unable and probably unwilling to destroy the institution of slavery, realises that the traffic in newly-captured slaves is undesirable and means his restrictions to be enforced, even though they may be l defeated by remote local officials or more probably by smugglers. 6. The most precise account of the Saudi restrictions is that given me by Fuad Bey Hamza in the conversation reported in paragraphs 2 and 3 of my despatch No 187 of the 23rd July, 1930. In a later conversation reported in paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 123 of the 2nd April, 1931, Sheikh Yussuf Yasin again assured me, though in more general terms, that effective restrictions were in force. In the Saudi note attached to the Saudi-Italian Treaty of the 10th February, 1932, the Saudi Government again referred to them and went so far as to state, doubtless with exaggeration, that the measures taken had been so effective that for several years no person had been able to import slaves into the country. Finally, Sheikh Yussuf Yasin renewed in conversation with me only some ten days ago his previous [106 p—5] '60 26 JULgeneral assurance. He added that he thought something had been published some years ago, but this, I think, was clearly a mistake. 7. The Legation has had two sidelights on this matter. It is recorded that in the course of the investigation by the local authorities of a case in which we were interested, the following question was put to the person implicated : “Hid you not know that the sale of slaves from abroad is forbidden, except with a pe®it from the Government ?' A case has also come to our notice recently, in which the Qadhi of Mecca refused to entertain an application by an ostensible slave for recognition of his free status on the ground that the regulations precluded any such application by a person enslaved more than twenty years earlier. Another account of this is that applications by persons enslaved before the inauguration of the Saudi regime in the Hejaz are barred. In either case, there is an implied recognition of the principle that persons recently enslaved are not lawfully held in slavery, and however theoretical the legal redress may be in other cases, it is a fact that in the particular case of the enslavement of pilgrims the Saudi Govern ment are nowadays ready to treat it as illegal. 8. A third sidelight is afforded by an analysis made by Mr. Furlonge of the stories related by slaves manumitted by this Legation since 1926. In all but fifteen of these 209 cases, which must be regarded as typical, the slaves had either been born in slavery or enslaved as young children not less than ten years ago. 9. All this brings me to Sir George Maxwell's proposed distinction between the born slave and the captive slave. It will be seen that Ibn Saud in principle already makes a not dissimilar distinction between persons who have been born in or who have grown up in slavery and others. It is true that he has not affirmed the distinction by any public act nor has he taken any general measures to ensure the liberation of all recently captured slaves in his territory. On the other hand, the evidence tends to show T that at present the vast majority of slaves in Saudi Arabia are persons born in slavery or enslaved in early childhood a good many years ago. 10. I do not consider that the time is ripe for any spontaneous approach to Ibn Saud on the basis suggested by Sir George Maxwell. It must always be remembered that the King, encouraged by his advisers, looks at the slavery question when it is raised by foreign Powers, not from the point of view of morality or internal policy but from that of his desire to safeguard his indepen dence. His feeling that European Powers may want to impair this is morbid, when it is a question of consenting to treaty articles like article 7 of the Treaty of Jedda; but there is no doubt that the retention by His Majesty’s Government alone of the right to manumit slaves in his territory is in fact a breach in Ibn Saud's position as an independent sovereign. It is too often forgotten that the maintenance of the system by the letters attached to the Treaty of Jedda was provisional and that His Majesty’s Government gave an undertaking to consider its abolition as soon as the co-operation provided for in the treaty should have made the exercise of the right no longer necessary. The Saudi Government might now argue with some plausibility that they had eliminated the recently-captured slave, and were entitled to ask for the fulfilment of that pledge, which can hardly be taken to mean that the right of manumission should be preserved until there were no more slaves in the country. 11. In any case I have every reason to believe that the Saudi Government will take up the question when any favourable opportunity offers, now that the Treaty of Jedda has become denunciable. Then, in my opinion, will be the time to consider the possibility of inducing Ibn Saud to define his attitude by a public act. It is for consideration whether, if he did so and the act provided adequate safeguards against a revival of the traffic in newly-captured slaves, it might not be legitimate to abandon the right of manumission subject to {a) the preser vation of article 7 of the Treaty of Jedda, and (b) an understanding that this Legation would be free to bring to the notice of the Saudi Government cases in which the regulations seemed to have been violated and to be informed of the result of the investigations. Such an understanding would have very little value, but, in my opinion, the value of the manumission system is easy to exaggerate. We cannot honoui ably abandon it without obtaining some compensatory advantage in connexion with slavery, but it affects a very small number of slaves; the ultimate good it does them is open to doubt in many cases; it creates from time to time difficult problems; and the Saudi Government could make it ineffective at any time by refusing to tolerate the repatriation of the freed slaves-■ --m i some d that ich we “Uid 3e®rit ch the ve for ;d any nother ration nplied y held it is a overn- of the dl but either o. itween nciple i born firmed ensure hand, Saudi many ) roach ays be lavery ew of iepen- orbid, Creaty nment n Ibn at the a was asider [ have might &gt;tured lardly there (£) 12. In the last paragraph of his paper, Sir George Maxwell speaks of the possibility of awakening some public opinion in favour of the gradual suppression of the born-slave system. If public opinion, in a European sense, can be said to exist in this country at all, it is likely to be long refractory to modern ideas on ^ie subject of slavery. There is some hope that Ibn Saud himself, if he lives ^d remains great, may find it politic to do more than he has hitherto done, but the best hope is, I think, that there are among his advisers some who would like to see an obstacle removed from the path of Saudi Arabia’s progress. A man like Fuad Bey Hamza, for instance, is all for independence and would like to see all Arabia united under Ibn Saud, but his personal sentiments are probably mildly opposed to slavery and he certainly regards it as vieux jeu. In a very personal conversation, which I had with him on the 22nd April, and which arose out of the case of the Royal slave now in the Legation, he showed distinct readiness to look at the general problem as one of social and political importance. He has the advantage, for this purpose, of having one of the religious prepossessions which make some Moslems think that what the Prophet tolerated he approved, and some perhaps to endorse the theory which Mr. Consul Zohrab declared to be prevalent in 1879, that there must be slaves, if a man is to acquire merit by setting them free. I told Fuad Bey that, while I personally should be glad to see the position as regards Royal slaves cleared up. I should prefer any more general discussion postponed. I hinted that there was room for a further evolution, in which men like himself and the Amir Feisal, the most enlightened member of the Royal family, might play a useful part. I gathered, however, that the Saudi Govern ment might force the pace not by denouncing the Treaty of Jedda, but by asking His Majesty’s Government to review certain questions incidental to it, of which slavery would be one. As this conversation was of a private nature, I would ask that it should not be referred to in any exchange of views with Sir George Maxwell or with the Saudi Minister in London. I have, &amp;c.

C.^UQ y &gt; British RepresentetIve on the Jjl averg committee of the ^ea^iue of Nations* When this note was first written, I gave it the title of 'The Captive slave' in order to bring out its main feature which (in the first draft) was the essential difference between the 'Captive Slave' and the 'Born Slave*, and the necessity for framing any ideas of emancipation upon this basis. A secondary point was that the slave traffic was a matter of supply and demand, and that more attention should be paid to investigating the 'demandThe Yemen Government was concerned only in connection with the part it plays in forwarding the 'supply . The recent announcement in the newspapers that a treaty has been signed between Great Britain and Yemen has led me to re-cast the original draft, and to give special consideration to Yemeni connection with the traffic. The legal status of 'Captive Slave' is today recognised in five countries only, namely, (1) Kthiopia, where free men, women and children are constantly being dragged into slavery; (2) Saudi -Arabia, which imports African Captive Slaves, via Yemen; (3) Yemen; (4) The Sultanate of Oman and the Trucial Oman, which import captive slaves (mostly children) from Persian Baluchistan;(6) n» Hadramaut{ »h*re. though th* 1***1 Utatua of tho eapttvo Hdeve Is still recogriissd, tho aotusl truffle la luports Is now ns^Uglhl* »s the result of ths povoptjr of the people.

A sloop of the British navy is peamanently employed upon preventive duties, but it has a very considerable distance to cover. The traders know its movements and make their arrangements accordingly. so far as I am aware, the French and Italian navies do not detail any ships for this exclusive purpose. The question of better liaison, and perhaps a combined intelligence service between the land authorities in French and Italian Somaliland, and the naval authorities seems to deserve considerations. The Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb are narrow, and three hours sail, with a favourable wind on a dark night, taxes a slave dhow from Africa to Arabia. The risks of detection are negligible. The slaves can be embarked at any point on the open, sandy coast of Africa and disembarked anywhere on the Arabian side. On the African side, towns or villages are naturally avoided. The quickest route is from French Somaliland to a point in Yemen on the western side of the frontier between Yemen and Aden. A slightly longer voyage is from Italian Somaliland (Kritrea), which lies to the north of French Somaliland, to the opposite coast of Yemen. Uhen once the slaves reach Yemen, no further concealment is necessary. The slaves are marched overland to Mecca, on a journey which it may take two months or longer to cover. Possibly, some of them are sold in Yemen during the journey. It is not clear why Mecca requires an annual influx of African slaves. It has had a population of M Born Slaves’* of pure/pure African or mixed African descent for centuries. The slaves are encouraged to marry and procreate more slaves; and it would have been reasonable to expect that the material Increase would have been sufficient to meet all demands. Nevertheless, the demand still exists, and there is nothing to be gained by any investigation of this point. The fact which the Slavery Committee of the League of Nations has to face is that so long as this 'demand' 1 exists, so long will the traders continue their efforts to bring forward the 'supply'. Though every effort should be made to secure more efficient control throughout Africa, and in the Red 3ea, and (as I shall proceed to indicate) in Yemen, yet this can be no more than a 'palliative'. The only 'remedy' is to stop the insistent demand. Nevertheless, the palliative 1s valuable, because everything that makes the slave trade more difficult or dangerous adds to the cost of the slave when he arrives at the market. There might conceivably be a point at which it would cease to be profitable to import a slave. But this seems to be unlikely at present. My object in writing this note is to suggest that the most practical method of checking the demand from Arabia would be by making a clear distinction between the 'Captive Slave' and the ’Born Slave'. The distinction leaps to the mind as soon as it is put on paper, but, nowhere, in the ma|^ reports of the Temporary Slavery Committees, haVe I seen it made. In the Slavery Convention of 1926, slavery is defined as 'the status or condition of a person over whom any or all 'of the powers relating to the right of ownership are exercised'. Paragraph 60 of the Temporary Slavery Committee’s report of the 1st/lat September, 1932, records that the French expert member of the committee was strongly of opinion that this definition was so wide as to defeat its real object in two respects: first, by exaggerating the gravity of the forms of 'modified 'slavery', and, secondly, by diverting attention from what he considered to be the main problem, namely, the suppression of raids and the slave market, and the complete abolition of 'real slavery'. The Committee^ report, in the following paragraph, suggested that a re-examination of the definition would be advisable. There can be little doubt that the failure of the League of Nations to discriminate between the 'Captive Slave' and the 'Born Slave' has led to active and passive resistance in the countries in which both forms of slavery continue to exist. It is common knowledge that the social and economic conditions of some of these countries have their foundations in the slavery system. But no one has as yet suggested to the governments of these countries that though their social structure may depend upon the 'Born Slave' system, the 'Captive Slave ' system is not really necessary to it. In respect of the 'Born Slave' system, the League of Nations has been compelled to recognize facts. The report of the Temporary Slavery Commission dated the 12th June, 1924, contained the following statement:- 'The Commission is of opinion (as its programme 'indicates) that the question of ’Slavery 1 must be regarded 'from a comprehensive stand point, and that it should endeavour 'to indicate some practical measures calculated in its opinion 'to ensure the gradual suppression of slavery and analogous 'forms of servitude and to facilitate the development of the 'social/’’aocifal and economic conditions which should succeed it w '•The Coaunlsalon recognixes that this is a very ^delicate task, but believes that it will be possible to 'offer suggestions of a practical nature which might be of 'value to the States which are endeavouring to meet the 'problems with which they are faced in their efforts to secure the gradual suppression of all forma of slavery.' This report was submitted to the Fifth Assembly of the League of Nations on the Ji2nd September, 19^4, and the programme, and the methods of work set forth in the report, were approved by the Assembly. The words which I have quoted are so mild, and the programme is so modest, that they can only be taken to apply to the system of the 'Bom Slave'. No one who wrote, or read, those words could possibly have had in mind the case of the victims of the slave-raid and the slave-market. #hat has not yet been realised is that there are three stages in the evolution of the 'Captive Slave' - (1) the stage of the 'raid', when he is taken from freedom into captivity; (2) the stage of the 'trade', during which he is taken from one place to another, and finally sold into some permanent home; (3) the 'domestic' stage, in which he remains until he dies. The first two stages are clearly recognised by the Slavery Convention. Kvery country which adheres to the Convention is bound by it to do its utmost to prevent the raid and the trade. ; 5ut, when once the man, woman, or child has been sold into a permanent home, he or she is indistinguishable from the 'Born Slave'. Yet, the one maybe compared to a forest bred animal and the other to an animal bred in a zoological garden. The distinction is one which can hardly fail to appeal to the mind of the people of the country in which both types of slaves are to be found. The people may very well believe that a continuance of their right to own slaves is necessary, but at the same time they may be thinking only of the 'Born Slave *. In the United States of America, the Southern States want to war with the Northern States in defence of their right to maintain slaves on their plantations. But those were born slaves; and their masters implicitly believed both in the justice of their claim to keep them in slavery, and in the entire collapse of their social and economic system if slavery were abolished. Any one of those slave-masters would however have felt that there was all the difference in the world between this ownership and the right to make a purchase from the cargo of a raider's ship full of captured slaves direct from some West African port. In the same way, when once the distinction has been made, it is possible to believe that the Kings and Rulers of the Countries in the Arabian Peninsula may be disposed to give a favourable response to an appeal based upon these grounds. Vhen regard is had to the principle of 'supply and 'demand', and to the fact that Mecca is the centre of the trade and the demand, it would be logical to represent the case to the Government of Saudi-Arabia before making representations to the governments of the countries merely connected with the supply. The 'The recent treaty between Great Britain and the Imam of Yemen make» it possible however to consider whether some useful action could not be taken now in Yemen both to check the supply of raided slaves, and to establish the principle of the distinction between the Captive Slave and the Born Slave# In making this treaty Hie Majesty*s Government doubtless Mad in mind the recommendation in paragraph 16 of the report of the Temporary Slavery Committee dated the 1st September, 1932# With particular reference to /rebian countries it stated that 'every Power with which tnese States or Sultanates 'seek or agree to conclude treaties should likewise endeavour 'to obtain the insertion of a clause in the treaties to be 'concluded to abolish slavery'. If he were disposed to do so, the Imam of Yemen could render the most v aluable aesistarce in two ways. The first would be the issue of a proclamation that thenceforward the landing on the Yemen coast of captive slaves was forbidden, and would be severely punished; and moreover that thenceforward the mere possession of a captive slave who had been brought into the country after the date of the proclamation would also be an offence subject to severe punishment. If the Imam of Yemen would undertake to issue such a proclamation, and to take the necessary measures to out it Into force, a severe blow would be struck at the slave-trade across the Ked Sea. At present the slaves are landed openly in Yemen; and reference to the map ahows that, if they take the shortest sea voyage across the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb,they have to walk throughout the entire length of the Yemen before they reach the frontier with Saudi-Arabia. Without doubt, there is one practical difficulty, namely, that of proving that the slaves are 'Captives' and not bom slaves. But if the burden of proof were on the defence, and if the Yemen authorities were really desirous of cooperating, this difficulty could be overcome. The second way in which the Imam of Yemen could help would be by the issue of a proclamation that after a certain date (which would be proclaimed later) he would emancipate all captives slaves and compensate their owners, and that after that date the possession of a captive slave would be an offence subject to severe punishment. Por this purpose, it would he necessary to define the expression 'Captive Slave' with some care, and to make it clear beyond all possible doubt that no interference with the 'Bom Slave' system of ownership was implied. Before any such action could be suggested to the Yemen authorities, it would be necessary to form some estimate of the number of Captive Slaves who would be involved, and the amount of dislocation in the social life that would be caused. The question of compensation in such a case has already been considered by the Assembly of the League of Nations. The Assembly decided, at its meeting on the lath October, 1932, that if any country, where slavery still existed, were to ask for financial assistance from the League of Nations, the present Slavery Committee (now established upon a permanent basis) would, at the request of the Council, examine the objects for which the financial assistance was required, theminimum amount neccsaary, and the guarantees offered. It would be necessary to take precautions against fraudulent claims of every kind. If, however, the principle of emancipation of the Captive Slave upon payment of compensation is approved, there should be no insuperable difficulty in obtaining the money. So long as the present confusion continues between entirely different types of slaves - the “Captive Slave” and the “Born Slave * - so long will the present policy of inaction persist throughout Arabia. The condition of the first is undoubtedly acute: in comparison certainly, and in itself possibly, the condition of the other is sub-acute. But, in neither case does it seem possible to confront the problem until the distinction is recognized. The remedy is to solve the major problem first, and to leave it to time and to the growth of public opinion to find the proper solution for the minor one. If the Imam of Yemen were to issue, and enforce a proclamation regarding importation of Captive Slaves, the King of Saudi-Arabia might in due course be disposed to take similar action. It is reasonable to believe that if the Imam of Yemen were to issue a proclamation regarding the emancipation of Captive Slaves, similar action might later be taken in Saudi-Arabia. As soon as both countries took this action, and enforced it, the slave trade from Africa to Arabia would automatically come to an end, for there would be no “demand”. Beyond all doubt, too, action along these lines would lead to the awakening in these countries of some public opinion favourable to the introduction of measures of the “gradual 'suppression'/Ho. its fOKlOM iV ICi:, f..t. o (K 1261/1^1/91) 2l«t Parch, 1934o rir, r;ir George Haxvell called here on the 8th Parch in order io dieoeee the euggeetlon, contained In hie wemoraaduia on the position of the Yemen In the slave traffic between Africa aad * rahia (a copy of ^hich wae encloeed In Pr* Keudel'e letter of thii date) that the rulers of Arabia should be urged to mhe a dleti?ictlcm l?et^een ’’bom” and ’‘oaotlve** slaver, nith a viev. to the early emancipation of the latter® fo It vae explained to f^ir George Vaxeell that, eo far a&amp; the Yemen coioerned, there *ao little hone.

These patrols are stated to be employed mainly on the Abyssinian frontier, and their function from an ant i-slavery aspect is therefore the prevention of the entry of slave caravans into Eritrean territory, uoubtless all innocent traffic follows b. routes through the mountains of the interior, which may be adequately watched, but to regard the frontier as being closed effectively to small gangs engaged on this or any other illegitimate trade appears optimistic when the total military force is but 130 strong.i*. Z. 2468/34 Extract from letter from Coramander-in-Command, H.M.S. 7, Penzance rr at Aden, dated 4th March, 1934. 'ANT I -S LAVE AY OPEa:iTIOES ,T . 24. At 1615 of the 21st, the following telegram from the Government Agent, Perim, was passed to PENZA1TCE by the Chief Commissioner - 'Please inform Ii.M.S* PENZiiFCE report received that '3 slaves awaiting shipment at Jebel Siyan by dhow 'Path el Khair, nacoda Abdul Hazack, or dhow owned by 'Sheikh Admed Anbari of Sheikh Seyd. Embarking 'probably to-night. (Time of origin not stated)'. Jebel Siyan (or Has Siyan) is situated on the French Somaliland coast, 12 miles 3.S.W. from Perim and 100 miles from ^den. 25. Although it was clear that the ship could not arrive in the vicinity of Perim until early on the following morning, it v/as decided to proceed to sea with all despatch (4/5th power), and the ship sailed at 2015, working up to 14.5 knots. This decision was based on the following facts - (a) No such positive information of slaving activities has been received in PENZANCE -- nor, as far as is known in any other sloop -- for some years. (b) The name of the dhow and the persons quoted already figured on a 'suspect' list in the ship. (c) The possibility existed that the dhow might be delayed in sailing until late at night, or might decide to remain at anchor off the African coast until after moonset (0045.) (d) Although fresh and favourable winds for the passage from the African coast are to be expected at this season the possibility of lighter winds and consequently of a slower passage could not be ignored. 26. The ship was darkened, and at 0300 passed through the small Strait, when the armed motor boat was lowered in the lee of Perim Islanu and commenced a north-and-south patrol outside the limits of territorial waters in the approaches to Sheikh Seyd. Meanwhile PEMZ-^NCE proceeded to the northward at 3/5th power until north of Dubab -- a suspected landing place for slave traders -- when a sweep was made to the west and south. Nothing, however, was sighted, and the motor boat, which also had drawn blank, was picked up at 0650 on the 22nd. 27. ■‘•he ship then entered Perim at 0730 to enable the Commanding Officer to discuss the situation with the Government Agent, but immediately after anchoring a dhow, known to be similar to the Fath el IChair, was sighted to seaward, making to the east. khe ship at once proceeded to sea, and the boarding boat examined her, but much to the disappointment of all concerned, her papers and a thorough seach proved her innocence.28• On return to harbour, Mr. ^avey seated that his informant was a trustworthy native of Su^iya (a village in the Protectorate) who, although he haa conveyed reliable information on other subjects on previous occasions, had not before given any slave traue intelligence. it further transpired that the suspected dhow had been in Perim during the previous day (21st) and tnat, although given clearance on that morning, she had in fact remained in harbour until u600 on the 22nd, when she had sailed, presumably for has oiyan. Although it was evidently possible that the presence of xEUZAUGE had become known to the nacoda, the chances to the contrary were felt to be sufficient to render desirable another night patrol. 29. ^.fter passing the day in harbour, the armed motor boat was accordingly directed to watch an area in the centre °f the Small Strait (width about one mile) from 2200, while PENZANCE at the same time proceeded to patrol on a line east-west across the Large Strait. The S.S.E.wind, which had been light throughout the day, died away to light airs during the night, and by 0100 on the following morning (23rd), it became clear that, even should the wind subsequently freshen, the dhow could not make the passage under cover of darkness, and might therefore be counted upon to remain in harbour. The patrols were therefore abandoned, and the ship anchored off Perim until daylight. During the early morning a light northerly breeze sprang up ? which, coupled with the fact that the ship T s presence in the vicinity was by now thoroughly advertised, destroyed any further prospects of success; PENZANCE theref ore proceeded at 0600 to Aden, arriving at 1600. It is curious coincidence that the information leading to these operations should have been received within a few hours of the despatch of PENZANCE 1 s submission referred to in paragraph 16, in which, in connection with tue negotiations with the Imam, it was stated that no recent evidence as to the continuation of the Slave Trade to xemeni ports had come to the knowledge of Ked Sea Sloops. In view of the Imam 1 s promised support in the suppression of this traffic, it now becomes increasingly important to produce proofs positive that the Trade s+.i n x x x X DJIBOUTI. order that his land patrols may investigate and co-operate. This/This point will he discussed with the Chief Commissioner, ^id.en. 37. These coastal patrols along the 210 kilometers (130 miles) of coastline from Djibouti to the i i1 ranco-ItaL ian frontier were stated by Mons. Chapon-3aissac to be stationed at 10 kilometre intervals, each consisting of 4 police under a native ff.C.O. Mr. T.C.M.Salmon (The British Acting Vice-Consul) estimates the interval at 25 kilometres, The Officer in charge is understood to be quartered at Djibouti, but when the lack of road communication along the coast is ta.:en into account, it; is evident that his supervision can at the best be but perfunctory; the value of these scattered posts for the prevention of Slave-running would thus appear to be slight.COPY (E 3541/469/26) SL.AVKRY IN A3ABIA. V. Z. 4323 l»33 In accoManoe with the arrangements recorded in the minutes on E 2413 and E 2942, Sir J.Harris and Sir Harcourt Butler called on me this afternoon to discuss this question. Mr.Laithwaite of the India Office was also present. It appeared that, as we anticipated, their chief object was to obtain our views on the proposal on pages 8 and 9 of Mr. Rutter’s lecture of March 15th last on Slavery in Arabia (see copy in E 2413) to the effect that either the Society or the League of Nations should invite prominent Moslem rulers and organisations to support an international recommendation to Ibn Saud that slavery should be completely abolished in Saudi Arabia. 2. I explained that we keenly sympathised with the objects which the Society had in view, and that we had indeed given evidence of this in securing Article V of the freaty of Jedda, and the retention of our right to manumit slaves in Arabia. On the other hand, if any progress was to be made it was essential frankly to face the difficultiew. I trusted therefore that the Society would not think that I was being purely destructive if I pointed out some of t&lt;.e objections to Mr.Rutter’s proposal. I would begin by taking the list of Sovereigns whom Mr.Rutter suggested that the Society should aporoach. Relations between he king, oi— and King Ibn Saud were difficult, and the King of gypt had shown great reluctance to do anything to improve them. Even had these relations been cordial, it would have oeen most difficultdifficult for the King of Egypt to approach King Ibn Saud in what the latter had always insisted was an internal question. As things were, such an aporoach would be quite impossible. The King of Iraq was the leading member of the Hashimite family, which, as Sir J.Harris and Sir H*Butler knew, were the great rivals of the Saudis in Arabia. After great difficulty tolerable political relations had at last been established between King Peisal and Ibn Saud, but these relations were not such as to give King Jteisal the slightest influence in the internal affairs of Arabia, and any representations from him on this subject were likely to do more harm than good. The Presiden t of Turkey had virtually repudiated his religion and disestablished Islam in Turkey. Although the political relatione between Turkey and Saudi Arabia were reasonably satisfactory, it was obvious that the Gazi would carry no weight in advising Ibn Saud in what was largely a religious question. In any case there was no likelihood of hie consenting to do so. 3. Mr.Laithwaite then explained the position regarding the Moslem Princes in India. These rulers were in special relations with His Majesty’s Government and could not, of course, be approached by the League direct. Bit he quest on was definitely one affecting the Moslem religion and therefore one of the utmost delicacy. If His Majesty’s Government were to attempt to mobilise the Moslem i rinces to make representations to Ibn Saud, the political results in India would be serious and unfortunate. The idea was in fact quite impracticable. In any case the Indian Moslems were divided in their attitude towards Ibn Saud, whom most of themthe* regarded as slightly heretical. There »ae no hope shateTer of their agreeing to make representations to him on this subject or of such representations proving successful, the same considerations applied to the King of Afghanistan, shorn it mould be quite out of the question for His Majesty's Government to approach in such a matter, 4. Sir H.Butler entirely agreed mith these vlems, which Sir J.Harris appeared fully to accept. They had Indeed already come to the conclusion that the proposal mould be quite impracticable, but explained that it mould be very embarrassing if their Society took no action at all on a suggestion *hich had been directly and publicly addressed to th«*. They agreed however that the Society mould have no choice but to temoorize. 6. We then discussed various other aspects of the question, such as the attitude of the Aga Khan and of the Imam of the Mosque at Woking, who, it was recognised, carried no weight at all in the Moslem world. We also discussed Ibn Saud’s general attitude towards the question of slavery. 6. Finally we agreed that the best hope of making any progress in the direction of the abolition of the institution of slavery in Saudi Arabia lay in the general development of the country on more modem lines. If communications and economic conditions were impmved, as it seemed probable that they would be with the development of air traffic and the eroloitation of the economic resources of Arabia - S ; udi Arabia would be brought more and more into touch with the rest of the world and become increasingly influenced by civilised and international public opinion. This process would slowly but surely improve the prospects of the abolition of the institution of slavery. But any direct approach to Ibn SaudSaud on the lines suggested by Mr.Butter would be certain to fail and would almost certainly make matters worse rather than better. 7.

Kendel and I saw Sir Harcourt Butler and Sir John Harris yesterday and explained the difficulties in the way of taking any action on the lines suggested hy ^r. Eldon Hutter. Sir Harcourt indicated that he had always regarded the suggestion as impracticahle, hut that it was important from the point of view of the Anti-Slavery Society that a positive suggestion of this nature so publicly made should not merely he allowed to drop. He and Sir John Harris, after discussion, agreed that action was impracticable at the moment and that if the Society were pressed on the matter they must take the line that the subject was one which bristled with difficulties, but that the possibility of taking action was being further explored. 2 ?'Pz- U4t y^// a Mr. Wal^n, Mr. VJakeiy, At. iilaon Rutter in the course oi a lecture to the Central Asian Society in torch that the ^nti-Slavery society, possioly through the League of Nations, should invite progressive Moslem rulers such as the Kings of Egypt and Iraq, the President of Turkey, the King of Afghanistan, the Sultan of Morocco, the Sultan of Zanzibar, the Aga Khan, the Indian Mohammedan rulers, etc. Ho support a recommendation to Ibn Saud that slavery be completely abolished in the Hejaz' (pages 323- 324 of record below). Lady Simon supported this suggestion, -pj •for if all the Moslem rulers decided to give up slavery and petitioned Ibn Saud to close the Mecca slave market she thought it would have a very good effect.” Ct' 7Z 1) 2. As you will see, the Anti-Slavery Society feel •’that this would be a very delicate operation” and Sir Harcourt Butler and Sir John Harris are to discuss it informally with the Foreign Office (who have asked that this Office and the Colonial Office should be represented) on the 29th June. 3. While it is quite true, as Mr. Rutter says, that Ibn Saud by the Treaty of Jedda agreed to co-operate with us by every means in his power in suppressing the slave trade, it ^ will be remembered that the article in question was secured only with very great difficulty, ana that while we have consistently continued to manumit slaves since that date we have throughout realised that we were walking on rather delicate ground. Endeavours by the Italians, etc. to obtain a similar article have been unsuccessful. On general grounds, however desirable it may be to put an end to slavery [ in/-I - 2 - in Arabia (though it will not be overlooked that the sa5e\ ^tc»c/ problem, in the event of our being successful, woular as Uh&gt; Lord Lugard actuits (page 327)arisen in the case of Abyssinia) we do not, I think, wish to put ourselves hi the position of organising an anti-slavery campaign principally directed against Bin Baud, having regard to the facts that the question could be maae to bear a definitely religious aspect, that in areas to some extent under our own control in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere there appears still to be a good deal of slavery; and that the same is possibly true even of certain more backward areas in India. The Foreign Office are, I think, likely to take the view that the ground is so delicate that any endeavour to follow up kr. Rutter’s suggestion might have embarrassing consequences, and I might perhaps indicate our general agreement with this line at the meeting and add that we should be reluctant to raise the matter with Indian lohammeaan rulers lest, in view of the division of opinion in that country in regard to Ibn Baud and his orthodoxy, our action in doing so should be misunderstood as an endeavour to take sides? ^ aV- W &gt; iu# '■J- ^ J-—foreign OFFICE, S.W.l r Jl 1st June, 1933* 3b46 \ rM* My dear Gilbert, ^ I send you herewith a ‘copy of a letter from Sir John Harris, of the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society, regarding a suggestion made by Mr. Eldon Rutter in the course of a lecture to the Royal Central Asian Society, that steps should be taken to persuade the more progressive Mohammedan rulers to recommend to Ibn Saud the abolition of slavery in his dominions. 2.

No fresh or original information has been forth coming during the period covered by this or the foraer report, in fact the several authorities with whom the matter of slaves has been discussed appear to have nothing to add to their previous.remarks and reports, waich have been detailed and amplified in the several Letters of Proceedings from the Red Sea Sloops during the past few years. The Acting Vice Consul at Djibouti and his pre decessor Mr. Salmond merely repeated the many items of evidence in suoport oi the contention that slaves continue to be exported from Abyssinia via Dunkali territory (Tajura and Obok district) with impunity. They assert (no brief is held for such sweeping statements) that the French Authorities, not only do not exercise effective control over their protectorate, particularly the coastline from Tajura to the Italian Eritrean border, but that their subordinate and Native Officials will not risk interference with these illicit activities, even if they do not deiioerately countenance the traffic in which not a few of them have personal interests. Whether it be contemporary historical literature on Arabia and the Arabs, or intelligence reports originating in the countries bordering the Red Sea, all of then make the most of this very tempting subject of universal interest, Slaves; and all of them agree in so many words th,t that part of French Somaliland North of the Gulf ol Tajura is what may be described as the 'clearing house of the slave trade,' and the Southwest monsoon months of June, July and August the 'Slave trooping season'. However, all that may or may not be, one is bound to/to suspect this part of the coast as the obvious outlet, both geographically and otherwise; and further there is no doubt that, of all available natives, Abyssinians are or have been the most in demand in Arabia. On the other hand it is well known that at the present time there is an acute shortage of ready money in Arabia, and no Slave Dealer is likely to run all the risks of the trade if he is not certain of cash payment on delivery. The Abyssinian boy, age 15, who was a member of the crew of the dhow boarded off Kamaran stated that ne knew of several Abyssinians in his district who were born slaves of slave parents, but who were now freed, as he has been, by the goodwill of their original owners acting up to the spirit of their religion. Only two slaves, one male and one female (Abyssinian) were manumitted in Jedda during September and October, 1931.L.P.—No. 8. indexed .AC*Vf further commuuication should be addressed to— The Secretary of the Admiralty, London, S.W.l, 27th August /.93l : Admiralty, S.W.l. quoting ', -j j I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to forward herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, extracts from a letter of proceedings from the Commanding Officer, H.M.S* LUPIN, covering the period 19th June to 31st July, 1931* I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,1 P .

Question of air reconnaissarces over reef area north of Kamaran from that island. Copy of to SEEN (•OLIT1CAL COMMITTEE# 2 $ JUL 195! Previous Papers 4475 b 1000 5.30 FOR INFORMATION. The possibility of the use of air Patrols based on Kamaran for intelligence work in the reef area originated m § 46(3) of ®r. Bond’s memorandum on the Slave Traffic (P. 7216/30 on attached file). The Air Ministry welcomed the scheme, but based in the first instance on Perim (P. 8127/30), as well as institution of a more complete intelligence system on the lines of paragraph 46(4) of Mr. Bond’s Memorandum: they did not consider it necessary that the floatplanes should operate over the territorial waters of the femen or off the African coast (P. 8375/30). The Resident at Aden drew attention to the delicate status of Kamaran and the need to impose restrictions similar to those on the air mail service to and from Aden (P.Z. 2537) , and the Goverment of India/11 carried/ 47!)3a India agree with him (P.Z. 4162). The Foreign Office, who had raised no objection (P. 8127/30) to a scheme based on Perm: , were at first altogether opposed to a scheme based or Farr.arar. (P.Z. 2904), but on the Air Ministry pointing out (P.Z. 4207) that they were merely contemplating air patrols to obtain experience of weather and other conditions with a view to the possible use of ^lying boats for anti-slavery measures or the projected Red Sea air route (which was incidentally a complete change of their plans), they consulted &gt; the Ambassador in Rome on how the Italian Government would take the scheme. He thought that prior consultation with the Italian Government would be essential: they would require a repetition of the assurance of 1928 about the visits of aircraft to the island and must be satisfied that (a) aircraft would help to repress slavery and (b) that they would rot be regarded locally as a show of force against the Yemen. The Foreign Office further pointed out that the Italian Government might wish to participate in the scheme themselves or make use of Kamaran, and decided to call an interdepartmeroal conference, which was held on July 6th. The meeting decided that (a) and (b) above coaid ce reu, but the prospect of the Italians desiring to participate created „ difficulty. It was decided, however, that in view of the restricted nature of the proposals now put forward by the Air Ministry, the comparatively satisfactory explanations we could offer if detected, and the chances of the patrols escaping notice altogether, there might be less objection than was originally thou£*t to the patrols being carried out without prior consultation with the Italians, and 1’r. Hurray is to discuss the matter with Sir R. Graham in Rome and report demi-officially to the foreign Office (see minutes below). But even if the weather patrols are successfully *Minute Paper. Department. carried out, the difficulty, so far as concerns the slavery question, has merely been postponed. We should still probably have to tackle the Italians in regard to the use of the flying boats in connection with the anti-slavery intelligence patrols: nevertheless the present reconnaissance is presumably in any case worth while on general grounds of air policy, and should be supported. The Air Ministry representativ® at the meeting tended to emphasize that the proposed reconnaissance was important in connection with the proposed H A11 British' air route down the Red Sea rather than with anti-slavery intelligence.

He explained that the Air Ministry wished to make t exploratory flights over the reef area north of Knmaran, using the aircraft which make periodical visits to Karmiran from Aden in connexion vith the supervision of the police force of the island. owing to the delicacy of our position atat Kamaran and the Jealous eye with which the Italians watch our activities there, the Foreign Office hail thought It necessary to consult His Majesty’s Ambassador at home regard- lit; possible Italian re-actions. 3. Mr. Rendel read the correspondence with .lr :. Graham, copies of which had already been sent to • ome of the departments concerned. n e drew attention to the ffict that in Gir R. Graham's opinion the Italian Government would strongly resent such patrols if made without prior consulta tion with them. The Italian Government would also, ’is Excellency considered, require a renewal of the assurances given to them in 1928 to the effect that these air activities would not entail the maintenance of any ground staff or force at Kamaran, and that no aircraft would remain there permanently. They would further probably want to be satis fied of the utility of aircraft in connexion with anti- slavery measures, and to be fissured that the patrols would not be regarded as a demonstration against the Yemen. The Foreign Office also considered it probable that the Italian Government would ask to be allowed to participate in such patrols, and to make use of Kamaran for their own service aircraft. Mr. Kendel understood that the service Depart ments saw strong objections to anything being (.one which might eventually lead to Itsilian participation of such a kind. he suggested this point should be considered first. 4. AP-:ld,Uay WAMVWVLV&amp;ii said that the Admiralty undoubtedly considered it most undesirable that the activities of the Italian Navy or Air Force in the Red Sea should be increased. 5. GROUP CAi’I.y r. UlMi explained that the purpose of the proposed patrols was merely to ascertain weather and sea conditions at different seasons of the year in the reef area between Kamaran and the Farsan Islands, xor the purpose ...purpose of deciding whether Xlying-hoats (of which there were none at present available in the Hed 3ea), could later be usefully used, either in connexion with anti-slavery measures or for the projected * all-British* Hed Bea air route. He explained that service aircraft flying to Aden had at present to pass by Eritrea. They were afforded necessary facilities there, but it was desired, if possible, to cut out Eritrea and to be able to use an alternative route down the east coast of the bed Bea. Buch a route would not be brought into use within a year or so, but the Air Ministry wished to explore its possibilities and the conditions which would be iret with off this section of the Arabian coast. Be said that, as regards the proposed patrols now under discussion, about four or five at different seasons of the year would probably suffice. He added that the Air Ministry had hoped that it would be possible, without consulting the Italians, for the aircraft which make periodical visits to Kainaran by agreement with the Italians, instead of returning immediately to Aden, to make a few short flights northwards over the reef area and then return and land again at Kamaran before proceeding back to Aden. The meeting considered that two of the points raised by Sir R. Graham could be adequately met. 'ihe patrols would be carried out sufficiently far from the Yemeni coast to preclude any danger of their being considered to be a demonstration against the Yemen; and it could be explained to the Italians that they were intended to ascertain whether the conditions in the area explored were such as to enable flying-boats to be utilized effectively in anti-slavery measures in that area. Ho difficulty was anticipated in repeating the assurances given to the Italian Government in 1928. The ...&amp; The possibility of the Italian Government claiming a right of participation in air activities was thought, however, to be a more serious difficulty. The meeting was inclined to consider, having regard (a) to the explanations given by Group Captain Peine as to the very restricted nature of the proposed patrols, (b) to the not unlikely prospect of such limited patrols escaping the notice of Italian authorities in the Red Sea altogether, and (c) to the comparatively satisfactory explanations which it would be possible to give the Italian Government, supposing that the patrols were observed by the Italian authorities that there might be less objection than the Foreign Office had at first thought, and than Sir R. Graham, on his information, at present saw, to the pro posed experimental patrols being carried out without prior consultation with the Italian Government. It was finally agreed that Mr. Murray on his arrival in Rome should discuss the subject with Sir R. Graham before His Excellency went on leave in the light of the discussion at the meeting, and that he should report the result of his conversation semi-officially to the Foreign Office. The question could then be further considered by the various Departments concerned.r SECRET I&gt; 7. 1931 90th June, 1931. : 9 » om» 81r, ilth reference to your secret letter Ho.a.ie6045/Pt*II/B.6 of the 31st M«y 9 regarding the possible esaployaent of felrcreft In esters off the Yemen const for the purpose of combsting the sluve trsd© # X sa directed by i r, secretsry Henderson to stste thst 9 in view of the undesirsbillty of srouslng the suspicions of the Itsllsn aovernment 9 he felt unsble to sgree to the Air Council's proposal for the institution of periodic sir patrols in the ted See reef area from Famaran without first ascertaining the riews of Hie Majesty's Ambassador at Rome on the subject. 2.

The information whloii these patrols are designed to obtain is essential in order to aseortain how far aircraft cai be effective in co-operating in the anti-slavery measures hitherto confined to the naval patrol. I have no doubt that the Italian government are no leas anxious than are His ajeaty’s oovernaent that nothing should be left undone which might increase the efficiency of the existing anti-slavery measures* but I rea.ise that eir patrols carried out from Kamaran, even if they do not sensibly increase the number of visits paid by aircraft to that island may arouse the suspicions of the Italian Government that it is being developed into a potential air base. 3. Before, therefore, either a-reeing with the /vir Council that the patrols may be proceeded with, or instruotinfi you to address the Italian Government on the subject, I shell be glad to learn whether Your Sxcellenoy considers that the Italian His excellency The fright Honourable Sir nonald Graham, G.CUM.a., G.C.V.O., etc., etc., etc., ftItalian Oov&lt; maant would be likely to misunderatand the motives of His lajetty’s Government and, whether in that case, it would be sufficient to repeat the aesurancee already conveyed by you in 1923 (c.f. my despatch Ko.47B of that year) vias that these visits by atroplane will not entail the maintenance of any ground staff or force nor will any aeroplanes remain permanently in the island* I am, etc*, (For the Secretary of State) (Signed) 0.

Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your despatch go.703 (K 8888/2766/91) of June 8th, in which you ask me whether, in the event of the et tablishaent of periodic British sir patrols of the reef ares in the ed Sea, the Italian Government would be likely to misunderstand the motives of His Majecty’s Government and in that case whether it would be sufficient to renew the assurances already conveyed by me in 1923. 8. It is difficult to sup ly a categorical answer, for the question is one which la never ventilated in public and is dealt with solely by the technical departments of the competent Ministries, who would probably hesitate themselves to express an opinion without careful consideration. Nevertheless I am disposed to think that, in addition to the assurance you refer to, there are two points on which the Italian Government would also desire to be satlsidled, namely, first, that aircraft are likely to be useful in helping to repress slavery within the somewhat limited scope allowed by the Slavery Convention and, secondly, that the flight of Brltleh aircraft in the area in question would not be regarded locally as a demonstration or a show of force against te Yemen, even If territorial waters are avoided. Thla latter point la one on which the Ministry of Foreign Affaire is particularly sensitive and I am convinced that were the proposed The klght Honourable A rthur Hende i son, i. P .,U 2883/3756/91)• S•^604b/?t» XI/o»6 &amp;sm- Air Ministry, London, )T*C*2 Slat May, 1931. Sir I am ooamandod by tha Air Oouncil to rafer to recent corraspondanca in connection with the possibility of tha employment of aircraft in waters off the Yemen coast for tha purport; of combating the slave trade and in particular to Foreign Office letter to the Colonial Office (J 1S51/33/1) dated the 7th May, 1931. 2. In view of the apprehensions which, as the Air Council rsclste, would be felt by the Foreign Office to any procedure whicn could be interpreted rightly or wrongly as effecting tha international atatua of the Island of Kamaran, the Air Council think it desirable that r. Secretary Henderson should be clearly apprised of the nature of the Council's proposals in this regard. 3. The instructions oonnunicated to the Officer ;omsanding, Aden, directed him to carry out air patrols in the retr &amp;rea ^- t -' g - vlew *° ofrUlnlna exaerlaiy m gf veatlwr and other oondl^ona in that area likely to be of value to flying boats if they later beoo»e available in the Red Sea. Hia attention was called to the necessity for avoiding the territorial waters of the Yemen or off the African coast. 4. The Air Council's view is that these instructions should and can be carried out within the aabit of the arrangements for periodical wlaita of aervlce aircraft to Kamaran which The Under Secretary of State Foreign Office, 8»f.l.which were instituted in and have been in operation since 1998 when the two platoons of Indian troops were withdrawn from the Island. In the notification of the new arran enents which was made by the Foreign Office to Sir Ronald araham on April 14th, 19&amp;8 (K 192VV 91 ) for transmission by him to the Italian Government explicit reference was made to the institution of these periodic visits. The patrols of the reef area need not even increase the frequency of the visits of aircraft and all that is involved would be that an aircraft carrying the mail would land for refuelling twice instead of once and would more often than at present atop for a night on the Island. 5* The Air Council appreciate that the terms of the last paragraph of the Resident’s despatch (No.64) of Faroh 16th, 1931, may have caused t i© Foreign Office some concern. It appears to them that the Resident may have been under a misapprehension as to the scale of the Air inistry’s proposals. Their reason for thinking this is that they have since received a letter dated April 2ith, 1931, from the Officer Commanding, British Forces, Aden, the terms of which indicated that he at least was under some misapprehension in that he was envisaging a situation in whlon aircraft would be used for the actual suppression of the slave traffic and not merely for the preliminary purpose of obtaining experience of weather and other conditions in the reef area North of Kamaran. 6. The Council would add that the period the patrols would cover would be approximately oneytar in order th^t datm during the various seasons of the year might be obtained. 7. In view of the explanation now furnished, the Air Council trust that Mr* secretary Henderson will agree that the patrols may be proceeded with} pending the reply of your Department, the Officer Commanding, Aden, has been Instructed that no patrols of the re. f area are to be carried out.

With reference to the Express letter from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, No. F.156-N/31, dated the 15th May 1931, regarding the proposed use of Ramaran as a base for air patrols for controlling the slave trade in the Red Sea, I am directed to state that the Governor in Council hm agrees with the views of the Resident and Cornmander- in-Chief, Aden, expressed in paragraph 5 of his despatch to the Colonial Office Mo. 64, dated the 18tli March 1931.B 12b r Commj^nications on this subject sjiould be addressed to— The Und^r Secretary of State, Iolonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the Under JDoi e folldw^ng number quoted Subject: Reference to premous correspondence: Letter the Colonial Office of the Transmitted by direction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

FOREIGN OFFICE, 27th April, 1931&lt; Sir, *ith reference to Forei^i Office letter i^o* J 255(3/22/1 of the 6th -august 1930, relative to the proposed establishment of a slavery intelligence service on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea and in French Somaliland, X fan directed by Mr* Secretary Henderson to state for the information of the Secretary of State for the Colonies that this question has recently been discussed with His Majesty 1 s Minister at Addis Ababa* 2. It appears that His Majesty’s Resident at Aden would be prepared immediately to extend the scope of his present intelligence service on the Arabian coast to cover slavery, subject to the covering sanction of Lord Passfield and the provision of the necessary funds* To this action Mr* Henderson sees no objection; he is, however, of the opinion that the establishment of a regular slavery intelligence service in French homaliland without the prior consent of the French Government would be in every way moat undesirable* It would be difficult to satisfy the French Government that the service was designed sin ply to provide information ^ regarding slavery and the mere suggestion that such an The Under Secretary of itate, Colonial Office* /' an organisation was neoded would bo likely to arouse suspicion and gi*e offence. 'ihis effect would be exaggerated if, without inforinin &lt;5 tne French authorities, a regular intelligence organisation were established on f’renoh territory and its existence beoecie known (as would probably Jiappen^ •) trie lo-il goreriRent. 3. In the opinion of dir S. Barton and Colonel He illy it is impossible to draw up in advance an estimate of the cost of the service proposed. It is understood, however, that at any rate to enable the possibilities of suoh a service to be tested a sun of not more than fire hundred pounds would suffice. Mr. Henderson is aware that the pressing needs of national economy at the present time make It necessary fully to justify to the Treasury any fresh expenditure from public funds. In the present case it can be argued, however, that a large sun of money is at present being spent on the maintenance of His Majesty's sloops stationed in the Hed 3ea whose main 'unction is to act as an anti- slavery patrol, and that this expenditure has up to date had only a negative value in the absence of any slavery intelligence organisation; that is to say that it is probable, thou^i proof is impossible, that it has rendered the slave trade more difficult and therefore reduced ite volume. If, therefore, the expenditure of a relatively aaall additional sun on intelligence work would make the patrol more effective, it appears to Ur. Henderson that the experimentexperiment ia xorth trying. ihe suppression of the patrol or the abandonment of its anti-sla?ery activitieag quite apart from any question of policy would not be tolerated by pu^-Aic opinion aa reflected in Parliament, where a rery considerable amount of interest is taken in the question. 4. Mr. Henderson will be glad to learn whether Lord Paasfield concurs in the proposed extension of the scope of the &amp;den intelligence organisation to cover slavery. In this event Mr. Henderson would suggest that Lord Passfield, with the support of the Admiralty and this department, should approach the Treasury to obtain sanction for the expenditure of a sum not exceeding five hundred pounds. 5.

Section 2. CONFIDENTIAL. [E 2222/2222/25] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received April 29.) 123.) (No. 123.) Sir, Jedda, April 2, 1931. WITH reference to my despatch No. 5 of 6th January last, I have the honour to state that, in the course of general conversation with Sheikh Yussuf Yasin o on the 29th March, I remarked that I saw by the “ Near East ” of the ' Ij foh February that he was making good progress with the negotiations with France and Italy. The sheikh seemed to think that I was getting at him in some way. He said that he had not seen the “ Near East,” and would have preferred that nothing should be published until all was settled. I told him that I was only interested in the matter in a general way, just as the Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London might be interested in the recent naval negotiations. I had much too much business of my own to concern myself otherwise. 2. This elicited a very slight burst of confidence. The sheikh said that the negotiations with France and Italy were getting on, but that the attitude of Great Britain had created some difficulty. I expressed surprise, and asked what he meant. He explained that he was not referring to interference, but to the fact that France and Italy wanted certain things that had been conceded to His Majesty’s Government, notably an article on slavery, which the Hejaz Government were not prepared to agreed to. 1 said nothing further about the French and Italian position in this matter, but observed that slavery was, of course, a very important question. It interested my own Government greatly, and it was an international question which interested all Powers belonging to the League of Nations. I referred to my conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza last summer (see my despatch No. 187 of the 23rd July, 1930). 3. Sheikh Yussuf was emphatic that Ibn Sand had taken the most stringent measures to prevent the importation of slaves. He had also taken measures to prevent persons being sold into slavery in the interior of his dominions, e.g., by persons coming on pilgrimage. 4. The most interesting points in what the sheikh said were his admission that the pilgrimage might be an occasional means of bringing slaves on to the market, and a remark that it was contrary to religious law that people should be sold into slavery in this way. 5. I have no means of ascertaining to what extent any prohibition of import of slaves is enforced. It is obvious that so long as there is a supply and a demand, such measures can be easily circumvented, either with the connivance of competent local authorities or by landing slaves from dhows away from seaports. It is at least satisfactory that Ibn Sand, while unwilling to commit himself to other 1 Powers and entirely recalcitrant to any idea of suppressing slavery as an institution, is conscious of his commitment to His Majesty’s Government. It is useful to remind him of it from time to time, as opportunities occur. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN.

Slave Trade The Italian naval measures for reduction of ave trading from Eritrea consist of maintaining two oops (AZIO and LKPANTO ) and two trawlers (GjiNHULk i ' : i slave sloo AH J) aniwunoi and P0HT0 CCHS1NI) at Hssawa. In addition a dhow with native crew and native police agent is maintained to sail up and down the coast and spy on the dhows.

My Lord, I have the honour to refer to Your Lordship* s Secret despatch of tne 25tn February 1931 on the subject of the control of the Slave Trade in the Red Sea, and to request that I may be supplied with a copy of Foreign Office letter of tne 16th December 1930, N 0 .E.6522/1054/91 to which reference was made therein. &gt; 2. In this connection I would observe tnat from the time of tne Agreement of 1926 oetween Asir and the Kingdom of the hejaz and hejd, and particularly after the recent annexation of Asir by Aing Aba al Aziz ibn 1 Saud, the political sphere of the Aden Residency in the Red Sea has presumably been limited to the coast of the Yemen as far as the soutnern ooundary ox Asir, e.g. up to, and including Medi. 3. The Reef area, referred to by tne Air Ministry * in their letter do. S/26045/S. 6 of the 6th February, 1931 would appear to stretcn approximately from Kamaran northwards to Lith, and to include a section of the Yemen Coast. In regard to the proposal to carry out air patrols over this section, I have the honour to enclose copies of the correspondence that was exchanged between my predecessor and the imam in February and arch 1929 on the subject of the fortnightly air mail service between Aden and Kamaran. The attitude of the imam in the matter, his Majesty’s Secretary of btate for the uolonies, London. whilej while it was satisfactorily helpful in regard to the contingencies of forced landings on the Yemen Coast, left no doubt as to his objection to the passage of aeroplanes over his territory without his consent. 4. In these circumstances I venture to suggest that anything in the nature of a regular air patrol over such of the reef area as may be regarded as within his territorial waters might lead to a formal protest by the Imam. 5. If the use of Kamaran as a base for the proposed air patrols is intended, the peculiar status of the island and the fact that its administration is at present the concern of the Government of India % will no doubt be taken into consideration. In view of the indefinite nature of that status the Air Ministry have imposed certain restrictions on the periodical air mail service to and from Aden, particularly in regard to frequency and to the length of time that aircraft may remain at Kamaran, and it may be considered advisable to observe similar precautions if the use of Kamaran by tne patrols is contemplated.

After compliments, We have received with due respect and honour your esteemed letter No. 1102 dated 18th Feoruary, 1929 and understood its contents. lour Excellency is already aware that the flying of aeroplanes belor^ing to any State over the territories of another State can only be made by means of mutual consent and agreement and the conclusion of a special pact betweenthe two States in o ... confirmity with the general procedure m existence between powers and Nations. In these circumstances, Your Excellency will agree that it is neither permissible nor reasonable for aeroplanes belorjging to your State to fly over our territories for the purpose of carrying the mails established between Kamaran and Aden. In case, however, of forced landing or the fall of one of the aeroplanes belorging to you on the shores in our territory ( by destiny or the decree of G-od) our officers who are in that part will no doubt give full assistance and render service, on condition that the aeroplanes will not use our territories as a way or passage for them and that they have no intention to disturb the minds of the inhabitants of those parts who will become suspicious as to the causes of their passage. WeWe have already written on these lines to those concerned as requested by Your Excellency, There had been a previous communication from your predecessor on this subject and we gave him a similar reply and requested him to warn Air Force officers against flyir^ over our territories. We hope that Your Excellency will take full interest in this connection.

The fact that any seizure of arms made would be an assistance to Ibn 3aud f s central authority would not, Sir Andrew considers ? outweigh with the Hedjaz authorities their dislike of outside interference which was not strictly legal. If full liberty of action is retained pffthe coast of Asir, Parisah Island and southward, it is considered that from a practical point of view there will be little or no change, as searches are rarely made north of this area. ***** SI^Yg TOAm, Rear Admiral Deville, whose command extends to the Red Sea, told the Senior Officer Red Sea Sloops quite clearly that his ships took no action as regards_search of dhows for slaves, in fact he appeared to consider it quite a joke that we should do so.

Sir, A'r. r’rytp/ v i*** «^***». /V ■ 'Jo uvn ( I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, extracts from a report of proceedings for the period 1st to 31st October, 1930, which was been received from the Commanding Officer of H. LI. S.’’DAHLIA'. *r- The information in section 12 regarding the slave trade is interesting and important. It confirms opinions previously expressed : that such traffic as there is goes mainly through French territory and tends to confirm previous impressions that the French local authorities make no serious attempts to stop it, partly through indifference (or possibly connivance) ana partly through inability.lt also confirms the view that the organisation of intelli ence on shore is the first necessity. It is again stated that the slaves are transported across to Arabia 2 or 2 at a time. This will always be difficult, if not impossible,to stop by action at sea. In this connection I am to reqyest that My Lords may be favoured at an early date with the views of the Secretary of State on the proposal that an interpreter to be engaged through the Legation at Addis Ababa should be embarked in the scoops cruising in Southern Red Sea Waters capable of questioning children found in dhows (vide Admiralty letter of the 16th October, Mo.M.03099/30).

Directly I arrived at Djibouti, Mr.Lowe told me e£ that he had a good deal of intelligence that would be of interest to me, as on my last visit I had asked him to try ana find out if the slaves reported to be on their way down from Dessie had. ever arrived. His information now was that the 70 reported had all arrived in the vicinity of Tadjura in due course, and that all but 20 had already crossed the Straits to Arabia, two or three at a time in fact zambuqs. (ii). From what I could gather, he is quite satisfied on the bona fide nature of the information given him by his agent, but the latter seems to be playing a most dangerous game, as he is known to be in very close touch v;ith both Garad and Turab, two of the best known dealers, and who were the men named by Sir Sidney Barton as having arranged for this convoy of 70 to be brought down. The information states that the Slaves, all boys ana girls are kept more or less openly outside Tadjura, ana emo. oye^ goat-herds until their sale has been negotiated. There are two routes for shipment, one at Ambaba nea.r Tadjura, and the other in the neighbourhood of Has Dumeira, insiae the Straits of Bab-el-Fandeb. Mr.Lowe, at my request, is trying to ascertain the exact whereabouts of this last position, which is of considerable interest to the sloops. He had recently made an excursion to Tadjura in a motor boat, in company with a member of the Legation staff from Adds Ababa, and came back with the impression that the existence of the traffic in slaves as well knwcn to the French authorities. (iii) A good deal of interesting information had reached T'r.Lowe from one of the French District Officers on the Abyassinian frontier. This officer realised how little authority his Government have in the interior, and is very anxious to import some Senegalese troops, and then by means of bribery to set the Dnnlra'i i* *Dankali chiefs quarrelling amongst themselves. Once this was done the troops could quickly subjugate the tribes one by one. At present, however, they are all in league with one another, content to share the profits of the slave and arms traffic, and remain united in the face )f the indifferent opposition of the French native troops at prenent in the Colony. M.Chappon-Baissac is reported to have refused to listen to any such suhhestions. (iv) From the same source Mr.Lowe learned that a large trade is now going on in women from the interior, who are brought down to Djibouti by train, one at a time, as the 'wives' of their companions. The District Officer has come to know of this, and proposed to institute a train inspection on the frontier, with verification of papers, which would have put a stop to the traffic. This proposal, also, is said to have been rejected by the Governor, and, further, on one occasion, when the District Officer was about to search a particular train, urgent orders were received that the search was not to take place. (v) As an illustration of the small control exercised by the French, it appears that quite recently the Commissioner at Tadjura obtained permission to build himself a house on a plateau in the mountains, where there is a waterfall, and a reasonably pleasant climate. Accordingly he selected a spot for the Residency, maked it off, and was commencing to have it cleared. Immediately the work was commenced, he was approached by two of the Danakil Chiefs, who explained that they had raised no objection to his looking at the place, but they could not dream of allowing him to live there. In consequence the residence in the hills has had to be given up. (vi) The native informer reports that the notorious Sheikh Lssa, who is so often at Perim, is now employed as an intelligence agent only, and lets the slavers know when the coast is clear for them. He is said to do this by means of fires on the shore. The last report from Aden about this man is that he is now buttut a peaceful trader in camels. As he is kno TO to he wanted hy the Italians for murder, it seems a pity he cannot he arrested, and hanc- ed over to them. (vii) Major Cheesnan,British Consul at Shangilet in Abyssinia, was with me, during most of my conversations with Mr.Lowe, and was obviously very surprised to hear of the ramifications of the trade. There is no douht that Mr.Lowe himself was very astonished at the information that reached him, and it was this fact tnat impressed me more than anything, as in previous conversations he had been somewhat sceptical of the extent of the traffic. (viii) One other point is worthy of remark. The native agent went so far as to offer to negotiate the sale of two or tnree 01 these slaves to Mr.Lowe himself, if he could arrange a boat to fetch them away, and went on to say that if an armed party were to he sent in the boat, the dealers themselves might he caught and punished. How -the idea that the Consul might like to buy slaves is not one that is likely to occur to a native, hut this very proposal was included in a recent despatch to the Foreign Office from the British at Addis Ababa. Xn the circumstances it seems likely that there is a leakage of information somewhere, and it is a disturbing conclusion at whicl J! 4- +‘U i n V + Vi -r Vin a rd■ ■ £ 6522/1064/91 s.y.i P.fivr'jo SUi )0 .

AIR MHOS THY, LOKO-OII, W*C.2. 25th September, 1950. Sir, I am commanded by the Air Council to refbr to Fbreign Office letter Ho,E 201o/l054/91 dated 24th April, enclosing a copy of a deapatoh from Hie Majeety’s Cimrg4 d^ffaires at Jeddah, on the subject of Slavery and the Slave Traffic in the Kingdom of the Rejas. etc. Mr .Bond's valuable Memorandum has been studied with much interest by the Air Council, and they agree (with regard to the suggestion contained in paragraph 40 thereof) that flying boats may prove to be of definite utility in the southern part of the Bed Sea for the suppression of slave trading. They would, however, observe that at present - (a) There are no suitable aircraft stationed at Aden, and (b) the intelligence available appears inadequate to give an indication X the present extent of the slave traffic. 2. The Council are further &lt;£T opinion that no material increase in the number of capture* would attend the use of float seaplanes in co-operation with sloops by wireless, owing to the slow speed of the sloop and the large area which It has to patrol. 5. The Council suggest, however, that the matter might be further investigated on the following lines j- The Under Secretary of State, Poreign Office, 5,W.l. (A)(a) A more complete Intelligence system on the line* Indicated in paragraph 46(4) of the Memo by the H.H* Charge d*Affaire* at Jeddah should be instituted (in which the Officer Commanding, Aden, would be prepared to eo-opera to. * (b) Float planet should carry out some experimental air patrola of the reef area, locally from Perlw in the first place, to obtain data as to the number of dhows plying in the reef area where it is difficult for the sloops to venture, Ihsae patrols would be undertaken at times when the sloop is in the vicinity and ag^in when it is known to be some distance away. Apart from any possible moral effect which would make the slave traffic more difficult it is considered thet tiioae experimental petrol* would furnish » useful addition to our knowledge of the mowementa of the dhows difficult to acquire otherwise. 1 am, etc ., (Signed) J.A.vehster.COPY. 3^180/1054/91 7 Foreign Office S.W.l 2Oth November, 1930 Sir With reference to paragraph 3 (b) of your letter S.26045/S.6 of the 26th September, In which the Air Council proposed that air patrols should be carried out In the reef area from Perl* with a wlew to combating the slave traffic In those waters, I am directed by **. secretary Henderson to state that he is disposed to agree to this suggestion in principle # 2. The Secretary of State feels however, t oei : any definite decision is taken in the matter, it would be desirable to consider the complications which may arise If it is desired to fly over the territorial waters of the neighbouring States. He would, therefore, be glad to be informed whether, in the opinion of the Air Council, it Is a necessary part of their proposal that the float planes in question should not be precluded from flying over the territorial waters of the Yemen. He would also be glad to know whether it is proposed to fly over the territorial waters off the African coast, and whether this also is considered essential to the success of the scheme. 3. The situation will receive further consideration in the light of the Air Council*s reply on the foregoing points. 4. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Admiralty, India Office and the Colonial Office.
