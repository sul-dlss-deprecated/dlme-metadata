Sir, I have the honour to report that I proceeded to Berbera on 3rd November to confer with the Commissioner with regard to the restrictive measures against the farsangli which had been approved by the Home Government. 2. - On 7th November I embarked Captain Cordeaux and proceeded to Las Khorai whencea letter was despatched to Lhvy Sul uan demanding his reasons ror the several raids on tribes in British Territory during the last six months. Three days were given for an answer and this time was spent visiting the various Flag Ports and examining the Warsangli C'ast. On the 12th November a very unsatisfactory reply was received from the Sultan and the Commissioner ordered him to pay a fine of one thousand camels and to restore the animals looted, also informing him that all farsangli Poob were closed except Las Khorai, where every dhow would be unloaded under supervision. 3. - I returned to Berbera yesterday leaving two boats at Las Khorai and despatched 'Proserpine' to carry out these restrictions, the two armed dhows being placed under the orders of Commander Leatham, and a political officer proceeded in 'Proserpine' to advise on local matters. 4. - It is proposed to fit out the two additional dhows when they can be procured. Commander in Chief, ^•“ EAST INDIES STATION.5. - The Italian Cruisen 'ELBA” arrived from the East Coast with the Italian Consul-General on board today. The Mullah came down to the coast at Illig but would not meet the Consul-General on the beach; but tried to entire him inland: it was afterwards discovered that four hundred Dervishes were in ambush ready to kidnap him if he left the beach. 6. - An Italian armed dhow captured one of the Mullah’s dhows near Makallah about a month ago, which has embittered the Mullah’s feelings towards the Italians. 7. — Owing to information contained in my telegram No.50, I am remaining here in case it is necessary to proceed to Aden to telegraph for reinforcements, should the small force of Dervishes reported 4?e be scouts from the Mullah’s main force advancing into British Somaliland. Should later reports be reassuring, which is probable, I shall occasionally visit the Warsangli Coast to assist and to relieve boats’ crews as necessary. 8. - The natives on the Warsangli Coast appear friendly at present and I do not think the boats will have any trouble. 9. - The 'Gibraltar' arrived at Aden today and leaveso tomorrow for Suez, taking two invalids from the 'Proserpine'.

Note communicated by the Marquis di San Giuliano, October 13, 190S. (Translation.) ARTICLE 6 of the Agreement of the 13th December, 1906, relative to the arms traffic in the Red Sea, stipulates that the three contracting Governments shall communicate to one another every year a list of the dhows authorized to carry their respective flags. It now happens that, as the matricular register is necessarily modified every day, the list of dhows drawn up on the 1st January^ ceases to be accurate almost at once. This arises not only from new registrations, wrecks, breaking up of vessels, and the continual changes in the names of the dhows, but also from the fact that the certificates of nationality, being issued for one year,; only \ tend towards daily expirations which, for obvious reasons, are seldom followed immediately by the renewal of the same certificates. It would therefore seem advisable that the three Governments should come to an agreement together as to the line to be followed in cases when, on visiting dhows, it is found that discrepancies exist between the documents on board and the lists of dhows exchanged by the Governments at the beginning of the year. An arrangement which would appear in some degree to meet the case would be for the three Governments, instead of communicating to one another the lists which, for the aforesaid reasons, can only be regarded as superfluous, to communicate instead to one another the forms of the certificates of nationality of their respective dhows and the accessory documents, provided with all the proofs of authenticity which have to appear on them. All dhows found to be provided with documents in conformity with these forms w r ould be set at liberty. The Italian Ambassador, in bringing the above to Sir E. Grey’s knowledge, has the honour, by instruction from the Italian Government, to ask him to consider and inform him in due course whether the proposal set forth above would meet with the approval of the British Government.

I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Holland's letter No. 471-E.B., dated the 8th February 1907, relative to the proposed amendment of the Aden Sea Traffic in Arms Regulation, 1902. 2. As desired in paragraph 3 of that letter, I am to forward, herewith, for the approval of the Government of India, a revised draft of clause 12 of the Regulation which defines at length the subject matter of the rules and provides for their publication, and to state that in the opinion of the Governor in Council the definition of the term “ Native Vessel ” should he the same as that in Article 31 of the General Act of the Brussels Conference which defines a « Native Vessel ” as a vessel fulfilling one of the following conditions (1) It must present the outward appearance of native build or rig; (2) It must be manned by a crew of whom the Captain and the majority of the seamen belong by origin to a country having a sea-coast on the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, or the Persian Gulf. The term “British Protected Port ” might in the opinion of the Governor in Council be held to mean any ^ort within the British Protectorate of Aden or Somaliland. 3. With reference to paragraph 4 of Mr. Holland’s letter, I am to observe that the Government of Bombay fully realise that the force of the proposed Regulation will be weakened by the omission of a provision requiring a bond to he executed before the grant of a port clearance. At the same time, how ever in the absence of arrangements, made through the co-operation ot the other powers concerned, for security bonds to be taken at all Ports and not at Aden onlv, they are unable to modify the view expressed in paragraph^ 3 ot Sir Stevnin 0 * W.

Memorandum by Captain F. de B. Hancock, Acting First Assistant Resident, Aden, dated the 3rd June 1907. Bombay Political Department 25th January 1902. No. 842, dated the Regulation III of 1902 was the outcome of the suggestion that all traffic should at ( times be suspended between Aden and certain small ports on the Somali Coast, East of Berbera, as a coercive measure calculated to enforce compliance with the general prohibition of the illicit introduction of fire-arms at those ports. 2 . In Political Resident's letter No. 114, dated the 19th April 1902, it was stated that Colonel Swayne considered it unnecessary that all trade to the Somaliland Protect orate should pass through Berbera. And this led to the framing of certain Rules which eventually took the form of Regulation III of 1902, and became law under the Govern ment of India Act of 1870 (33 Viet, c, 3). At the same time opy attae re . a Notification* was issued on the Somali Coast, dated the 30th September 19C2, under Article 24 of the Somaliland Customs Regulations of 1902 to the effect that all native craft proceeding from any port or place in the Gulf of Aden . and bound for any place or port in the Somaliland Protectorate East of Berbera should j first touch at one of the three Customs ports of Berber a, Karam or Hais and should not leave that port until they had obtained from the Customs authorities written permission to proceed to their destination direct. 3. And at the same time Italy co-operated to the extent of agreeing that all Midjour- teyn dhows should be similarly bound to first call at the British port of Hais before pro^ ceeding to the various small ports on their coast. 4. The Regulation thus went beyond the scope of a temporary coercive measure, and imposed certain permanent restrictions upon trade passing between Aden and certain places in the Gulf of Aden which Government, whilst refusing to go so far as to sanction the “ Aden Port Clearance and Trade Registration Bill' referred to in Govern ment Resolution No. 2017, dated the 25th April 1900, deemed it expedient to impose, with a view to checking the illicit arms traffic between Jibuti and the Somali Coast, 5. The Regulation also included special provision against the carrying of arms and ammunition between the Arabian and African Coasts of the Gulf of Aden, and for certain powers of search at Aden which could not otherwise be provided for without making Aden a Customs Port, which was deemed inexpedient. 6 7 6 . In Government of India letter No. 1405-E., dated the 4th June 1884, it had been observed that the Arms Act was no doubt intended to be worked with the aid of the Sea Customs Act. And the Regulation apparently aimed at such a combination as was possible without resorting to the undesirable expedient of making Aden a Customs Port. 7 . In the Somaliland Protectorate itself there are both a Firearms and Customs Regulations which, worked in harmony, should impose an effective check upon the illicit traffic in arms. But Regulation III of 1902 was framed with the intention of imposing such further check upon the traffic as could be secured by the co-operation of the Indian Government. con 477—-11 0 . „ wprp hroufftt to notic3 in Political Resi- 8.

And whilst it may be admitted that th.s will be facilitated by he restriction of all traffic to certain prescribed ports as contemplated by the revised Regulation under consideration it must also be allowed that such restrictions alone are ^adequate to secure the desired object and that it is essential not only to secure the act.ve co-operation of all concerned in enforcing those restrictions, but also to secure their co-oper ation in, at the same time, enforcing the provisions referred to in Article IX of the Brussels Convention on the lines of either Part III of the Somaliland Fire-arms Regulations of 19t5 or the Indian Arms Act of 1878. 12. Furthermore, it may be urged that no smuggling can be effectively checked without an efficient preventive service, and that no rules or regulations will be of any avail to check the illicit traffic in arms unless measures are taken at the same time to actually enforce them. 13. Hitherto Regulation III of 1902 has had little or no real effect in the desired direction. Arms and ammunition still pass freely between the Arabian and African Coasts of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Adeu. And there is little doubt that they will continue to do so unless and until the paramount powers concerned themselves more effectively interpose to prevent it. 14. Assuming therefore that it is really intended to take effective action, it seems essential that Great Britain as well as the other powers concerned should now resort on the littoral of their Protectorates to measures of intervention and interference which it is not politic and may not be even possible to adopt in the interior, 15. A considerable portion of the interior of those Protectorates is already full of fire-arms and thus the Brussels Convention has failed to prevent much harm being already done. But the evil can now be mitigated to some extent by checking supplies of ammuni tion. And further imports of arms can be prevented or at least more effectively checked by a determined effort on tbe part of all the powers concerned. 16. The most effective course of action would be to more rigorously check imports from Europe by ocean-going vessels. But assuming that to be impossible, some good may be obtained by checking subsequent distribution by the various native craft which chiefly undertake it. 17. There is no reason to believe that there is any illicit import of arms of any consequence into Aden itself or any subsequent distribution thereof from that port. And if the same could be said of Jibuti and all other ports in the vicinity which are actually visited by ocean-going steamers, it would not be necessary to devise measures to check the subsequent distribution under reference. 18. Linder present circumstances there is known to be an extensive distribution of illicit arms on the shoi'es of this Protectorate. And it may be agreed at once that to impose an effective check upon this traffic it is desirable either to apply the Indian Arms Act, as suggested, to the whole of the littoral affected, cr else to take such measures on the lines of the bubaihi Agreement of 1881 or of the various agreements which have from time to time been entered into with the Trucial Chiefs of the Persian Gulf to secure the active co-opeiation of ad the coast tribes in the desired restrictions. In the latter alternative it would seem essential that we should ourselves co-operate and arrange to supervise the actual arrangements which are made by our stipendiaries, and it would be expedient to enhance the value of the stipends or other consideration in lieu of which those arrangements are undertaken. 19. From past experience it may be urged that the application of the Arms Act and the assumption of the necessary jurisdiction to apply it would form the most effective ieme y, an t lat any other course would necessitate such supervision and interference as would be almost tantamount to a direct assumption of authority. But on the other hand itmay be deemed more politic to secure the necessary co-operation of the tribes concerned by the various methods which have been suggested, such as enhancement of stipend and ourselves supplying the reasonable requirements of their own regular armed forces. a j rev ^ se ^ Regulation, the same general remarks may be held to apply. And it is furthermore to be again observed that for this to be really effective, it is essential that all the powers concerned should follow a similar procedure to that which the Government of India eventually decide to themselves adopt. 21. If this co-operation can be secured, the provision for security bonds to be furnished before the grant of Port Clearances might with advantage be retained. But there should be the same procedure at all the ports which are prescribed, and the production of a recognised and valid bond should be requisite to the grant of a Port Clearance at every one of them. J 22. Similarly the absence of a proper Port Clearance or the unlawful carrying of arms should be an offence on the arrival at or departure from any other prescribed port as well as the Port of Aden. ^ 23. Many vessels leave Aden for places on the Eastern Coast of the Protectorate and thence proceed with a fair wind to the Eastern Coast of Africa. And it is by such vessels that it is probable that arms are chiefly conveyed to the Somali Coast. Similarly many vessels proceed from the vicinity of Obokh to places on the Western Coast of the Protec torate and thence elsewhere without perhaps ever coming into Aden at all. 24. Assuming the requisite co-operation of all concerned to render the reo-ulation effective, the revised draft may be further considered : — (i) In the first place it would seem desirable to apply the Regulation to vessels pro ceeding elsewhere than the Gulf of Aden. France, Italy and Great Britain have agreed to take action to prevent disorder in Africa and on the shores of the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean as well as the Gulf of Aden, and further to check the illicit export of arms etc., to places beyond the zone of the Brussels Convention. The scope of the Regulation may be considered accordingly. And it would seem more convenient to apply it to a certain class of vessel than to vessels proceeding to certain places. “ Coasting Vessels ” would seem a convenient term subject to such further definition as Government may deem desirable. And incidentally further consideration might now be paid to the proposal to apply Act XIX of 1838 to Aden which was vetoed in Government Besolution in the Marine Department, No. 565 of the 1st October 1881. At any rate this Act might be applied to vessels owned by British subjects. There is a Somaliland Registration of Vessels Regula tion of 1904 in force on the Somali Coast. And I attach a copy of that and of a demi- official letter dated the 26th March 1907 which I have received from Captain Cordeaux on the subject. (ii) The term u Coasting Vessels ” might be substituted for &lt;f native vessels ” in Rule 12 of the draft Regulation. And this might be so worded as to give registered vessels only the privilege of carrying arms for self-defence. In Rule 8 there is reference to a pass which may be granted elsewhere by a public official. And as both France and Italy appear from the latest agreement to contemplate the registration of vessels, they might at the same time co-operate in licensing registered vessels only to carry arms for self-defence. (iii) The Regulation might include a general clause empowering the Resident to make rules for carrying its objects and purposes into effect. Certain rules of this sort were issued in 1902. And I attach copies of my levision of these of 1905 and of the letters I received on the subject from the Senior Naval Officer, His Majesty , s Commissioner of the Somaliland Protectorate, and the Consul-General for Italy. These have not been actually issued pending the revision of the Regulation itself. But some rules of the sort seem desirable. (iv) It is also a question whether some further rules would not be useful in regard to “ coasting vessels only under the Sea Customs Act on the lines of the rules which for merly existed at Aden and are embodied in annexure 1 to the accompaniments to Govern ment Resolution in the Revenue Department No. 2617, dated the 25th April 1902. I hesitate to again raise the question of the “ Aden Port Clearance and Trade Registration Bill ” : but I would take the opportunity to mention two facts which have recently come to notice:— (a) A certain number of native craft smuggle both tobacco and specie from Aden into Turkish Ports under a false clearance for other ports, mostly Massowah ; and (5) the incorrectness of manifests issued to coasting steamers at Aden has recently given rise to complaints by the Somaliland Authorities. (v) As to Rules 3 and 4 of the Regulation, I have already remarked upon the desira bility of including other places than Aden amongst those where a vessel should upon arrival be required to produce a Port Clearance from the last prescribed port visited, and amongst those from which a vessel should not depart without such clearance. Aud the same remarks apply to Rules 7 and 9.1 4 ! rpo-ardino- iarisdiction which Government have (yi) Rule 8 mv , olve l g°g S ^ ou]d S eem to be some difficulty about an Aden Magistrate doubtless considered. Ihe Italian dhow accused of carrying arms between Mokalla trying the master or ow “ er 0 , d th n e C essary co-operation such a case could perhaps be So “ ali Coast - Similar remarks apply to Rule 10. No further remarks seem called for on the present proposals. Executive orders are necessary regarding the arrest and custody of vessels and offenders w.thm the terr,tonal necessary regarding ^ R ktlon has been passedj and the Arms Act oTX p^stos o^rguiince of officers have also been applied, it will — to spedfy tbe Prescribed ports and to then take such further action as may be deemed necessary to secure the co-operadou of the Coast tribes of the Protectorate. 28 In discussing the matter before proceeding on leave General DeBrath observed that if the Arms Act were applied to the Protectorate it should be to the coast on y as distinct from the interior. And he added that it was desirable that the rules eventually applied should be as simple as possible so as to be readily understood by the Chiefs concerned. He also concurred as to the desirability of extending the draft Eegulauou beyond the limits of the Gulf of Aden as indicated m paragraph 24 (1) of this note. 27. As to the qnestion of the omission of the provision requiring a bond to be executed before tbe grant of a Port Clearance be agreed that this omission would tend to the benefit of the general trade of the port. But he remarked that as under existing arrangements Miiiourteyn dhows were not allowed to leave Aden before they had furnished a bond to the Italian Consul to call at Bandar Cassim before proceeding elsewhere on the Coast of Italian Somaliland, it would he necessary to secure his co-operation m this as well as in other matters affecting the illicit traffic which it is desired to suppress. SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE. Customs Notification. Whereas it has been found necessary, with a view of checking the illicit traffic of fire-arms, to exercise greater control and supervision over all native cr^ft trading with the Ports of this Protectorate. Notice is hereby given that all native craft proceeding from any Port or place in the Gulf of Aden and hound for any Port or place in the Somaliland Protectorate east of Berbera shall first touch at one of the three Customs Ports of Berbera, Karam or Hais, and shall not leave that Port until they have obtained from the Customs Authorities written permission to proceed to their destination direct. The Master or owner of any vessel that touches at any Port or place in the Protector ate east of Berbera without the written permission of Customs Authorities at one of the three Ports of Berbera, Karam or Hais shall be deemed to have done so in contravention of Article 24 of the “ Somaliland Customs Regulations, 1902 ”, and shall be liable to tbe penalties therein prescribed, that is to say, forfeiture of the vessel and her cargo, together with a fine not exceeding Rs. 1,000, and imprisonment of either kind, which may extend to two months, Btrlera, September 30^, 1902. (Signed) H. E. S. Coedeaux. Letter dated the 26th March 1907. From— H. E. S. Coedeaux, Commissioner for the Somaliland Protectorate; To.—Captain F. DeB. Hancock, Acting First Assistant Resident, Aden. The Registration of Vessels Regulations were introduced with the object of enabling us to exercise a greater control over native craft, as required by the Brussels Act. Of course, in compelling vessels to register, we are making ourselves virtually responsible for their conduct—a responsibility which, if accepted indiscriminately and without due precautions, might lead us into difficulties. It is for this reason that compulsory registration is enforced only in the case of local dhows, i. e. } dhows engaged in the coasting trade, and whose owners are domiciled in one of the ports of our administration, i. e., Zaila, Bulbar, or Berbera. We do not enforce registration in the case of dhows belonging to other ports of the Protectorate e a Hais, Karam, Las Khorae, and other flag ports for the reason that we have not sufficient hold over them, and cannot, therefore, accept responsibility for their good behaviour.5 Similarly, I should hesitate to register sea-going dhows, such as the Persian Gulf Dhows, unless the owner had substantial property in Berbera. Personally I think compulsory registration would afford a very useful means of exercising greater control over native crait, provided it were universally adopted by the local authorities of the three powers interested ; otherwise, it is merely a self-denying ordinance. * Like other Regulations devised with the object of checking the arms-traffic, they must, to be of any use, be universally adopted, each party accepting its own share of the responsibility. The Italians, I believe, are registering their local dhows as far as possible, and if the French will do the same, then I think there would be a good case for Aden following suit, and the additional responsibility incurred would be equally shared.

Bor the purposes of this section, “native vessel” means a vessel fulnllmg one of the two following conditions, namely (a) it must present the outward appearance of native build or rig; or (b) it must be manned by a crew of whom the master and the majority of the seamen belong by origin to a country having a sea-coast on the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea or the Persian Gulf19 rim—E~r r~ 13.

The Aden Sea-traffic in Arms ni of 1902 . Regulation, 1902, is hereby repealed. No. 1250, dated Bombay Castle, the 19th February 1908. From— H. O. Quin, Esq , Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Holland’s letter No. 4887- R. B., dated the 21st December 1907, relative to the proposed amendment of the Aden Sea-traffic in Arms Regulation, 1902. 2. With reference to paragraphs 2 and 3 of Mr. Holland’s letter, I am to state that clause 12 of the draft amendment as originally drafted gave power to the Political Resident, Aden, subject to the control of this Government to make rules regarding the carrying of arms for purposes of defence only. The words “ for purposes of defence M were subsequently struck out and the power to make rules has consequently been widened; hence the conflict between clauses 8 and 12 of the draft. Having regard to the wide terms of clause 8, which contemplate that no vessel unless exempted under clause 12 shall leave Aden with arms, etc., for any place in the Gulf of Aden without a license granted by such officer as the Political Resident, Aden, may appoint in that behalf, the Regulation virtually contains the prohibition contemplated in clause 12 (1) (a) in a wider form ; and it appears to His Excellency the Governor in Council unnecessary to empower the Political Resident to make such a prohibi tion by rule. In the opinion of this Government the logical and correct method would appear to be (a) to make a direct prohibition against carrying arms, etc., without a license, cf, clause 3; (b) to penalise infringement of that prohibition, cf. clause 7; and (c) to empower the Political Resident to make rules as to the form of licenses, etc. I am to forward for the consideration of the Government of India, a draft revised accordingly. 3. As regards the other points mentioned in paragraph 2 of Mr. Holland’s letter, I am to state that it appears to this Government that the words “ any places in the Gulf of Aden ” should be adhered to in preference to “ ports in the British Protectorates of Aden and Somaliland” unless there is any special reason to the contrary, and that the proposal to bring clause 8 into line with clause 12 (1) (a) by inserting the word “ native ” before vessel was con sidered by this Government, but not accepted. There should, however, in the opinion of this Government, be a consistent phraseology throughout the Regnla- tion, and I am accordingly to suggest that the word‘ e vessel” should be used throughout and clause 13 utilised to make any necessary exemption. This alternative would enable the Political Resident, Aden, to exempt all vessels *Pro. 3?o, 240 in Secret e., March 1893, Nos. 217 - other than native vessels as defined in 245 ' Article 31 of the Brussels Convention.* Clause 12 should also be widened to include “ Ammunition, Military stores and explosives.” Revised draft of clauses 3, 8, and 12 of the Aden Sea-traffic in Arms Regulation^ 1902.

Admiralty to Foreign Office.—(Receiveid April 13.) (Confidential.) Sir, ^ Admiralty, April 11, 1908. WITH reference to your letter of tlie 29tli February, I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of tbe Admiralty to request that you will represent to tbe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that Foreign Office letter of tbe 28th October last was understood to contain an inquiry as to the class of vessel best adapted for operating against pirates in the Red Sea, assuming that on any occasion it is necessary to employ a vessel for this purpose. 2. Their Lordships’ reply to this inquiry does not deal with the general question of piracy and the means for its suppression ; still less does it deal with the methods for suppressing the arms traffic. 3. On the other hand, the remarks of Sir E. Poe contained in his letter of the 29th January, 1906, deal with the prevention of the arms traffic, and not with piracy. 4. The conditions affecting the suppression of piracy differ widely from those relating to the arms traffic. In the case, for example, of a piratical attack on a British ship, it is probable that the pirates can be identified, after which it is only necessary to trace them down and possibly to destroy their strongholds. An example may be found in the case of the action taken by His Majesty’s ship “ Fox ” in 1905, after a piratical attack upon a British barque named “ Alwani,” or last year in the case of the stranding of the steam-ship ‘‘Kilburn,” which was looted by the Bedouins, and protected by His Majesty’s ship “Perseus.” 5. For such service a vessel of the class described in Admiralty letter of the 20th January would be better adapted than any other, but operations of this nature are quite distinct from the patrol to suppress the arms traffic, where a long coast line has to be covered, and where punishment is only possible where the gun-runner is caught -flagrante delicto. 6. In reply to the inquiry contained in the last paragraph of your letter, I am to state that, so far as their Lordships are aware, the question of piracy in the Red Sea is not acute at the present time, and that no special measures are necessary.

I AM commanded by my Lords Commissioners of tbe Admiralty to request tbat you will inform tbe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs tbat they bave bad under consideration your letter of tbe*28tb October, 1907, forwarding copy of correspondence witb tbe India Office, and requesting tbeir Lordships’ observations witb regard to tbe class of vessel wbicb should be employed in the unsurveyed waters of tbe Red Sea for tbe suppression of piracy. In reply, I am to request tbat you will inform tbe Secretary of State tbat, owing to tbe strong winds blowing up and down tbe Red Sea, it is desirable tbat a vessel for this service should be capable of steaming from 12 to 14 knots. As tbe waters of tbe Red Sea are imperfectly surveyed, tbe vessel should be either composite built or of steel and sheathed witb wood. She should be of light draught, 10 to 12 feet, witb twin screws, and of a length not exceeding 200 feet. Her coal capacity should be from 150 to 200 tons. I As regards tbe possibility of employing armed dhows, I am to state tbat in tbeir Lordships’ opinion these vessels would not be effective for tbe purpose in view. They were first used in connection witb tbe suppression of the arms traffic in Somaliland, but service in them was found to exercise a demoralizing effect upon tbeir crews, while they proved of little use in repressing tbe traffic. Tbeir Lordships’ views on this subject will be found in tbe letters, extracts from wbicb are inclosed for convenience of reference. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) C. I. THOMAS. Inclosure 1 in No. 1.

Although several captures of arms were made when those now employed were first equipped, they are now easily distinguished by tbe Arab smugglers, who possess better vessels than tbe (Somaliland) Protectorate has been able to purchase, and bave little difficulty in outsailing and evading tbe patrolling dhows.

Ibey nave tbe further advantage of being sailed by men who bave bad a lifelong experience o this traffic, and who are excellent sailors in tbe management of this class oi vesse , an are aided by a most complete and efficient system of intelligence throughout tbe coast.

Holland’s letter ho. 4887-E.3., dated the Slst December 190 7 , relative to the proposed amendment of the Aden Sea Traffic in Arms Regulation, 1902. 2. With reference to paragraph; 2 and 3 of Kr. Holland's letter, I am to state that clause 12 of the draft amendment as originally drafted gave power to the Political Resident, Aden, subject to the control of this Government, to make rules regarding the carrying of cams for pxirposes of defence only. The words 'for purposes of defence' were subsequently struck out and the power to make rules has consequently been widened; hence the conflict between clauses 8 and 12 of the draft. Having regard to the wide terms of clause 8, which contemplate that no vessel unless exempted under clause 12 shall leave Aden with arms, etc., for any place in the Gulf of Aden without a license granted by such officer as the Political Resident, AdenAden, na;r appoint in that behalf, the Regulation virtually contains the prohibition contemplated in clause 12 (i) (a.) in a Crider form; and it appears to His Excellency the Governor in Council unnecessary to empower the Political Resident to make such a prohibition by rule. In the opinion of this Government the logical and correct method would appear to be (a) to make a direct prohibition against carrying arms, etc., without a license_ef clause 35 (b^ to penalise infringement of tirnt prohibition.cf clause 7 ; - and (c) to empower the Political Resident to make rules as to the form of licenses, etc. I an to forward, for the consideration of the Government of India, a draft revised accordingly. 3. As regards the other points mentioned in paragraph 2 of Er. Holland’s letter, I am to state that it appears to this Government that the words TT any places in the Gulf of Aden' should he adhered to in preference to rt ports in the British Protectorates of Aden and Somaliland' unless there is any special reason to the contrary, and that the proposal to bring clause 8 into line with clause 12 (l) (a) by inserting the word 'native' before vessel was considered by this Government, but not accepted. Phere should, however, in the opinion of this Government, be a consistent phraseology throughout the Regula tion, and I am accordingly to suggest that the word 'vessel' shouldshould be used throughout and clause 13 utilised to make any f necessary exemption. This alternative would enable the Political Resident, Aden, to exempt all vessels other than native vessels as defined in Article 31 of the Brussels Convention. Clause 12 should also be widened to include 'Ammunition hilitar' T stores ( * a and explosives. I have, etc., Sd/- H. 0. Qiiin. Acting Secretary to Government(Cf.

FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. To * The Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., Mis Majesty’s Secretary of State jor India. Fort William, the 2nd January 1908. Sir, We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Secret despatch No. 28, dated the 6th September 1907, in which you request us to take such steps as may be practicable to ensure a more rigorous and constant vigilance being observed by the British authorities on the Arabian Coast in the neighbour hood of Aden, in regard to the arms traffic. 2. On receipt of a copy of your despatch the Resident at Aden sent* a Secret Agent to Mokalla to ascertain * ^enclosure No. 15. the extent of the traffic in arms carried on there. From his report it appears that the Governor of Mokalla exercises a fairly effective control over the traffic, and that no secret importations are allowed. The Resident further inti- + Ibld ‘ mated,f on the 28th September, that he had requested the Fadthli Sultan to check the traffic on his coast and to confis cate and send in any arms that might be discovered passing through his ports. The Sultan promised to do so. 3. The Resident has, however, given it as his opinion that no measures will prove effective on the west coast, which fail to include the establishment of posts and patrols at the ports of Imran, Khor Umeira, and Ras-al-Arah. He recommends the conclusion of agreements with all the Chiefs of the east coast on the lines of those made by Colonel Kemball in the Persian Gulf in 1902, and considers that it will be necessary also to supply a reasonable amount of arms to the Chiefs for their protection, and to give them a pecuniary interest in the suppression of the traffic. 4. The Bombay Government, in commenting on these suggestions, invite a reference to their letters Isos. x Vide enclosures Nos i and 2 . 1804 and 1805, J dated 5th March 1906. They assume that the measures proposed by the Resident, and also the sugges tions for the occupation of posts are probably not consistent with the pohcy o His Majesty’s Government, and they § vide enclosures Nos. 12 and 17 . therefore propose§ that in lieu of them we should enlist the co-operation of the Sultan of Lahej with a view to stopping the arms traffic. 5. We are unable to concur in this proposal, since we doubt the efficacy of the Sultan’s assistance to secure the end in view. Every attemp on our part to induce the adoption of more effective measures would P 10 ® met by the Sultan with demands for an increased subsidy. He would represen» that the lawlessness of the tribes required the maintenance of ever increasing guards and patrols, and in effect, we should be paying not merely tor the2 suppression of tlie arms traffic, but also for the maintenance of the Sultan’s authority. The question of by what means we should exercise control over the Sultan might also become difficult. 6. In our telegram, dated the 22nd June 1906, we stated that in the event of the conclusion of a satisfactory international agreement of the kind referred to in our despatch No. 83, dated the 21st April 1904, we had intend ed to suggest that subsidiary measures to stop the arms traffic should be taken by instituting a coast patrol and by occupying Ras-al-Arah and possibly other points on the coast. An international agreement on the subject of the arms traffic was concluded on 13th December 1906, between England, Vide paragraph 5 of Secret despatch No. 148 Erance and Italy, and we learnt subse- (Externai), dated the 5th September 1907 . quently that it was proposed to draw up local Eegulations to be signed by the three parties as a corollary to the Agreement, on the lines of the Somaliland Eire-arms Kegulation, and the Aden Regulation 3 of 1902. We should be glad to be informed whether such Eegulations are being framed, and if so, whether we should submit proposals for the subsidiary measures mentioned in our telegram of 22nd June 1906. We desire to add that we have no strong recommendations to make from the point of view of Indian interests, on the subject of repressive measures, since the tribesmen of the Aden Hinterland are for the most part fully armed already.

I am directed to submit, for the orders of the Government of India, the general question of policy in that portion of the Aden Hinterland which is in the occupation of the Subaihi, the Abdali and Haushabi tribes. 2. Various correspondences have of late been submitted to the Govern ment of India which show that a definite line of policy should be settled for the guidance of the officers of the ^Residency at Aden. In my letter No. 1541, dated the 24th February 1906, is submitted the last receipt on the subject of an attack by certain of the Subaihi on the levies of the Sultan of Lahej at the post of Nobat Dakim. With my letter No. 1340, dated the 15th February 1906, papers regarding uneasiness caused by apprehended encroachments of the Turkish Revenue Officials at A1 Doka were laid before the Government of India. The correspondence regarding the murder of the late lamented Captain Warneford at Am Rija has been from time to time submitted with letters leading up to my No. 1620, dated the 27th February 1906. With my letter No. 1506, dated the 2^rd February 1906, the late«t information as regards the murder of a postal runner near Sheikh Othman on British territory has also been submitted. With my letter No. 1423, dated the 20th February 1906, the latest report containing suggestions by the Resident at Aden on the subject of the arms traffic from Jibouti is before the Government of India. All these questions have now been the subject of personal discussion with the Resident at Aden. 3. I am to refer to the last of these papers at the moment only to draw attention to the fact thit should there be a decision to endeavour to patrol the coast with armed dhows and possibly with a small steamer, which is one of the suggestions in ^he letter of the Resident on that subject, the Attifi port of Ras-al-Arrah is the centre indicated for such operations. 4. Dealing with the papers regarding the murder of the postal runner, I am to remind the Government of India that while the Boundary Commission were at work in the Haushabi territory several cases of attacks by the Subaihi on our followers near Nobat Dakim occurred, and eventually. His Excellency the Governor in Council recommended in my No. S642, dated the 23rd December 1903, that punitive measures should be taken to punish these attacks on British servants and subjects before the Boundary Commission entered Subaihi country. Sanction to these proposals was given by the Government of India, but before it was possible to move in the matter the Boundary Commission were on the point of entering the Subaihi country and it became undesirable for any action to be taken. It appears to His Excellency in Council that in accordance with the principles then relied on, which, as shown in my No. 5151, dated the 14th July 1902, are the traditional principles governing our relations with the Hinter land tribes, it is not possible to overlook the murder of this postal runner and that punishment must follow an incident of the kind. The man was in our service and travelling on our duty. The attack on him was made actually in Aden limits by tribal raiders. The mail bags in his charge were carried off, their contents rifled, and the attitude of the tribe in their latest reply to the Resi dent is one of unrepentant indifference and support of the offenders. Judging the incident by the principles which were stated and apparently accepted in the letter of December 1903 above referred to, His Excellency the Governor, in consultation with the Resident, has come to the conclusion that this incident cannot be passed by and that it is necessary, having regard to the course of this and other recent incidents, to assert a respect for our authority generally in the area from Nobat Dakim on the east throughout the Subaihi country to the recently demarcated boundary on the west. If that be admitted, I am to pass to the question of how action should be taken. 5. It will be seen from the Resident’s No. 863,* dated the 11th February 1906, and it is also evident from ex perience in the case of the Boundary Commission, that it is too late to ^ send The cold weather has passed, the climate * Submitted with this Government letter No. 1506, dated the 23rd February 1906. troops into the territory this season. 3956 F. D.is very severe, the crops are probably og the ground, the inhabitants of the teuton are, unless detained by their crops, very nomadic in their habits, and an expedition at the moment would probably be very expensive in every way and possibly ineheetive. But at the same time it is undesirable to delay action too Iono«, and I am to submit that it is possible to take immediate action, the effect of which can be maintained during the hot months, which will reach the Attifi sub-tribe, and which will at the same time serve our purposes in other respects, e.g,, the arms traffic. 6. I am, therefore, to recommend that the first step to be taken should be to send out a force by sea and to occupy Ras-al-Arrah and Turan at as early a date as possible. These places are the principal villages of the Attifi tribe to whom the murderers of the postal runner belong. Notice should then be given to the various sub-tribes of the Subaihi, whose conduct it has been necessary to criticise, that, unless before November next they give satisfaction to the Resident’s demands against them, further action will follow^ Ras-al-Arrah and Turan should be held under the civil control of the Assistant Political Resident at Perim, and the occupation should be utilized to obtain what information is possible as regards the arms trade from Jibouti into that part of the Protectorate. 7. The next question for consideration is as to the action that should follow if the tribes are still unwilling to meet the Resident s demands. There are two policies possible. The first is one as to which the Government of India up to this time have not made any very certain pronouncement, which the Gov ernment of Bombay would recommend, and which has been stated more than once. I am to refer to this Government letter No. 30-M., dated the 18th April 1904, which recommended that the most powerful of the Chiefs in the Hinter land, the Sultan of Lahej and the Amir of Dthala should be utilised to carry out our policy by subsidising them and giving them both moral and material support as might be necessary. I am to point out that this is the policy favoured in paragraph 7 of Mr. Pitz *Submifctecl with Bombay Government letter Maurice’s Notes* of March 19th, 1904, No. 30-M., dated th. 18th April 1901. an(J it ig witMn tlie knowledge of the Government of Bombay that it is the policy which had the support of Colonel Wahab. So far as the Amiri country and the North-East Frontier are con cerned, it has been adopted in the appointment of Major Jacob and the instruc tions which he has received. The matters under discussion in the present letter all arise in the Subaihi country which falls within the sphere of influence, which in pursuance of that policy would be assigned to the Sultan of Lahej, and the policy which the Government of Bombay would recom mend in the first instance to the Government of India is to afford to the Sultan of Lahej that “ material backing of Government ” the absence of which in the past led, in Mr. FitzMaurice’s opinion, to the failure of the policy when previously enunciated, as for instance by the Subaihi Treaty of 1881, and [on the necessity for which stress was laid in paragraph 7 of my letter No. 5151, dated the 14th July 1902. Applied to the parti cular facts now under consideration the recommendation is to subsidise Lahej specially with arms, ammunition, money, and, if necessary, with the presence of the Aden troop, and, while holding Ras-al-Arrah and Turan as further evi dence of support, to call upon him to identify his interests with ours and to deal^ with the^e tribes over whom the Government of India have at times recognised bis overlordship. Such recognition, for example, was contained in the Subaihi Treaty of 1881, which, as noted in your No. 935-E. B., dated the 27th February 1906, has never been cancelled. No doubt this proposal involves the payment ^ of sums of some magnitude to the Sultan, but it is, in the opinion of His Excellency in Council, at once the most effectual action, the cheapest in the long run, and also that which involves the Resi dent in the smollest amount of direct responsibility in the Hinterland. It is also a policy which will be entirely agreeable to the Saltan himself. am to point out that a further effort to establish][this policy in effi ciency was recommended to the attention of the Government of India in the letter of this Government No. 7603, dated the 1st November 1901. I am to invite the special attention of the Government of India to the letter of the Resi dent which was then submitted and to Government of India letter No. 1856-E.,dated the 9th September 1902, closing the discussion for ttieftime being. In the course of that discussion the Government of India declined in their No. 516-E.A., dated thewth March 1902, to action the particular recommendations then before them. Whether that decision was special to the particular circumstances or involved a general decision of policy is not clear. The later letter of the following September appears to show that the question is still open. I am, however, to submit, with reference to certain of the considerations stated in the letter of the Government of India of the 7th March 1902, that it is quite hopeless to expect the Sultan to undertake expensive operations at the Resident’s instance unless the latter is able to offer him substantial and sustained pecuniary assistance in furtherance of such a policy. Both in the case of the Subaihi Ireaty of 1881 and in March 1902 it was the refusal of sufficient material support to the Sultan which paralysed all efforts to work by such means. 8. His Excellency the Governor has now carefully discussed these matters at personal interviews with the Resident at Aden, who is in complete accord with him in again placing this policy before the Government of India as the most suitable policy to be followed in the Hinterland provided that the Gov ernment of India are prepared to meet the expense involved. The limit which must be set to that expense must be measured by the cost of alternative possible arrangements. ^ Pending a final decision on this recommendation it is unnecessary to consider various matters referred to in different parts of the letters submitted. Should the Government of India,, however, on full consideration, not approve of this proposal, and should the tribes, on the notice which it is proposed to give them, not have responded by October next, I am then to recommend that a force, such as may be sufficient in the opinion of the Military authorities, may in October or November next be sent to Ras-al-Arrah and Turan to carry out the following programme, They should from there march inland and exact'satisfaction from the Attifi for the murder recently committed near Aden and from the Rijai for the sheltering of the murderer of the late Captain Warneford; should then march to Al-Eoka and make it clear that there must be no encroachments by Revenue officials from the Turkish side of the frontier or attacks by our tribes such as the Barhimi or Mansuri on Turkish tribes across the frontier; should then march along not far from the (frontier and work their way eastwards and so down to Nobat Hakim exacting on their way satisfaction and guarantees for the future from the sub-tribes which have given trouble in the last year or two in the neighbourhood of Nobat Hakim ; from Nobat Hakim the force should then return to Aden. His Excellency the Governor in Council wishes it to be clearly understood that the second proposol is, in his opinion, not so satisfactory as that of utilising the Sultan of Lahej to compose these tribal difficulties. The adoption of the former alternative will lead possibly to the designation of one of the Assistant Residents stationed at Aden to pay special attention to the south-west of the Hinterland and endeavour to brin? the Sheikhs of the various tribes into better relations with the Sultan of Lahej in the same way and on the same principles as those on which Major Jacob is working in that direction in the Amiri territory. This recommendation was made by Colonel Wahab in his No. 23,* dated the 19th March 1901, datTdthf isfht' di h i 904 G ° Vernraent N °' save that he considered one officer would pn ~ ' suffice for the whole border. Its adop tion will necessitate the sufficient relief of one of the assistants from routine work to enable him to tour when necessary among the Subaihi tribes. The adoption of the latter alternative is a remedy of temporary character and is less likely to lead to future improvement of the tribal relations with either the Sultan or Lahej or the Residency. I am also to notice that in the letter which I am shortly to address to you on the subject of the arms traffic from Jibouti it will be found that His Excellency the Governor in Council, _ after consulta tion with the Resident, is of opinion that the first alternative policy above recommended would also subserve, and at a less cost than direct action by the Resident, the interests which it is necessary to guard in that respect. 9. There has been already some delay in the consideration of the action desirable in regard to the murder of the postal runner, and I am to ask very early orders as to the sending of a force to Ras-al-Arrah and Turan to hold those places pending a further consideration of the proposals in this letter.-5^— X am directed to advert to my No. 6630, dated the 29th October 1905, with enclosures.

It appears to be, therefore desirable that the Government of India should have them on their records. But the letters of October and January last to some extent cover the same ground and for purposes of a general consideration of the subject might have been a good deal condensed. 2. I am to offer the following remarks on the question after consulation in Bombay between His Excellency the Governor and the Resident at Aden. 3. The present position in the Hinterland is described in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Resident’s letter of October last, and in discussion the Resident has laid great stress upon the fact that practically every adult inhabitant of the Hinterland is already armed with firearms of some Eind or other, and, as he reports, generally with a French rifle which has come by some route or other from Jibouti or Obokh. The ProteeTorate is, therefore, in his opinien, lull of arms already, and it is clear from the papers, which have from time to time been forwarded, that arms can be purchased in the French possessions without let or hindrance. Furthermore, it is obvious from the Besident’s letter No. 265, dated the 14th January 1906, that, in the absence of very clear orders fiom Paris, it is futile to expect any assistance from the French authorities at Jibouti and Obokh to stop the traffic. It is rumoured that their recent experience in Yemen has led the Turks to he much more strict in this matter than they previously used to be, hut of this there is no certain information. It appears from the interview with Commandatore Pestalozza, of which a note has been submitted with the Resident’s letter No. 265, dated the 14th January 1905,that the local Italian officers are somewhat lukewarm in adopting the measures which the Resident at Aden and His Majesty’s Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief of the Somaliland Protectorate are prepared to adopt, and which they consider cannot succeed without full co-operation by the other signatories of the Brussel’s Convention. 4. So far as the recommendations contained in the first twenty paragraphs of the Resident’s letter No. 265 of the 14th January 1906 are concerned, these are for the consideration of the authorities in London. Any assistance by the other Powers in the region that may he given will, of course, tend to secure the objects now under consideration, but so far as this Government is concerned it is necessary to consider the situation simply on the basis above stated, viz., that the Aden Protectorate is already full of arms, that the whole adult male popu lation is by custom actually armed, and that there is an easy source of supply within reach at Jibouti, and that there is no prospect of help from the autho rities of that settlement. 6. I am briefly to refer to paragraphs 10—16 of the Resident’s letter of October last, in which he discusses certain orders he had received from the Bombay Government in letter No. 2107, dated the 31st March 1905, and in regard to that I am only to say that the paragraphs seem to have been written under a misapprehension, and that as regards the provision of a supply of arms in Aden, the Resident is in accord with the views expressed in the letter of March last and that the Resident’s opinion on the suggestion which was made to him in paragraph 5 of the letter he discusses will be found in paragraph 17 of his letter of October 1905. It is not now a matter which calls for further discussion. ' *6. The various suggestions contained in the letters now forwarded are very briefly:— (1) Some general measure of disarmament; discussed in paragraph 18 and 20 of the letter of October last; (2) The possibility of registration of arms and the provision of a source of supply which could compete with Jibouti, but he under our own control; discussed in paragraphs 12 to 16,19 and 21 of the letter of October last and paragraph 25 of the letter of January; (3) The possibility of patrolling more efficiently the coast line of the Protectorate; discussed in paragraphs 22, 23, 24 and 25 of the letter of October and paragraphs 21 and 24 of the letter of January ; (4) The possibility of establishing posts of observation on the littoral both to the west and east of Aden ; referred to in paragraph 27 of the letter of January ; (5) The need and the inefficiency of the Sultan of Lahej’s assistance to us in this matter; referred to in paragraph 28 of the letter of January. 7. Taking these matters in turn, His Excellency the Governor in Council considers that any idea of the disarmament of the tribes can at once be dismissed as impracticable and as being entirely opposed, even if practicable, to what is known of the wishes of the Secretary of State, for nothing in the shape of disarmament can be carried out without assuming responsibility for administrative measures in the Hinterland which it is understood is not in any way desired. 8. Turning to the second series of suggestions as to the desirability of placing within the reach of the tribes a supply of arms under our own control in Aden, this has already been placed before the Government of India in my letter No. 1476, dated the 23rd Eebruary 1906 o The question of registration will be dealt with in a letter in which I am to discuss certain amendments proposed in the Arms Eegulation. 9. Passing to the question of establishing a more efficient patrol by means of dhows and light-draught steamers, I am to call attention to Appendix D to the Resident’s letter No. 265 of the 14th January 1906, which gives roughly the estimate of cost so far as ascertained from an inspection of records belonging to the Somaliland Protectorate. As to this, I am to say that no doubt the provision of some such system of patrol would render the direct importation of arms into the Protectorate a matter of greater difficulty than at present and the provision of a light-draught steam-boat or fast motor-dhows would no doubt subserve many useful purposes between Aden and Perim besides that of dealing with the arms traffic. It would, for instance, facilitate the supervision of the pearl industry discussed in my letter No. 7160, dated the 6th November 1905, if it is intended to move in that matter. It might be utilized to carry the Government mail between Aden and Perim or Ras-al-Arrah and Perim and thereby dispense with the necessity of paying a subsidy for the conveyance of that mail, and it is obvious that a light steamer of the kind on the coast might not infrequently be of service to the Resident for miscellaneous work. Rut the cost of establishing and maintaining an efficient patrol is by no means inconsiderable, and I am to point out that there is no doubt that the flank of any such arrangements could easily be turned. Arms are already landed in some quantities southward of Mokha, at Kadduha and probably at Pebad as pointed out in the papers received with Foreign Department No. 46-E.B. of the 5th January 1906. A glance at the map will show how little difference it would make to the trade which is said to go on if arms were landed here and then passed into the Protectorate by land. Any proposal to efficiently guard the land frontier of our (Protectorate is, of course, entirely out of the question. Therefore the establishment of a patrol to the west of Aden is a measure which can only be very partially successful, and the expenditure which it would involve is, therefore, relatively considerable. His Excellency the Governor in Council is further of opinion, as will be seen below,6 that a considerably less expenditure than the money which 1 steamer and 3 dhows would cost (probably not less than Rs. 75,000 per annum, with an initial expenditure of not less than two lakhs), if used in another direction, would produce at least equal results. 10. As regards the further suggestion of the establishment of posts on shore, I am to invite attention to my No. 1804, dated the 5th March 1906, in which it has been suggested in connection with certain offences by the sub-tribes of the Subaihi that a post should be established at Ras-al-Arrah, at any rate temporarily, on other grounds. That might be maintained for such time as the Government of India may see fit and possibly permanently with a view to secure the internal order of the Protectorate. So long as it is maintained it will, no doubt, be the most convenient centre for any system of patrol which it may be decided to try. It is further suggested in the Resident’s letters that posts might be established on the littoral to the east of Aden. His Excellency the Governor in Council does not at present recommend that course. It is alleged that all the tribes, not excluding the Sultan of Lahej himself, are quite willing to engage in this trade, that the profits are considerable and that the arms are run across from ports on the littoral on the west of Aden to ports on the east and thence shipped to the Italian Protectorate in Somaliland, and thus evade our port regulations at Aden and such watch as we are at presentable to keep on the proceedings of boats which trade with Jibouti. The evidence in favour of this scheme of trade is not very strong, but it is no doubt probable that arms like other goods are passed from our eastern ports to Somaliland. If, however, an effective patrol or other means can be taken to the west of Aden to stop the trade at that point, it would seem to be unnecessary, even in the interests of the Somaliland Protectorate, to attempt to control the eastern ports, and it is certainly unnecessary to do so in the interests of the Aden Hinterland itself. 11. I am, therefore, to pass on to the last matter of suggestion which His Excellency the Governor in Council has to consider. At present it seems to be clear that the tribes have at least the reputation of being quite willing to engage in what is to them a profitable business, not even excluding the Sultan of Lahej. It is also certain that the leading characteristic of the Sultan is a love of money and that he has done little in our interest, except words, since receipt of the orders of the Government of India in their No. 516-E.A., dated the 7th March 1902. One possible policy is to endeavour to convert the Sultan from that attitude, so far as it exists, into one of whole-hearted co-operation with us in this matter. In my letter No. 1804, dated the 5th March 1906, I have been instructed to place before the Government of India proposals that the policy of working through the Sultan should be consistently and fully utilized for the control of the Subaihi tribes. I am now to suggest that if that policy be sufficiently liberally and consistently adopted to secure his active co-operation with us in the suppression of the importation of arms from Jibouti into the Protectorate, it would probably be the most effectual measure that could be taken for that purpose, and though it no doubt means liberal recurring expen diture on the Sultan, yet I am to submit that this policy would almost certainly not cost so much as the suggested arrangements for patrolling the coast, for an establishment of [outposts, 'and other repressive and disciplinary measures which, in default of some such policy, the Residency must from time to time undertake. This suggestion has been previously placed in a few words before the Government of India in my No. 3822, dated the 22nd May 1902. As pointed out in my No. 1804, dated the 5th March 1906, that policy would also subserve other objects, and it appears to His Excellency the Governor in Council, on a survey of the_ conditions of the Hinterland, to be the most suitable and economical policy for our various needs to recommend to the Government of India. 12. I am, therefore, to suggest— (1) That as recommended in my letter No. 1476, dated the 23rd Eebru- ary 1906, a full and sufficient supply of arms for the actual needs of the tribes which will compete in price and popularity with the Trench weapons should be made available under the orders of the Resident at Aden;(2) that such moral and material support should he sriven to the Sultan of Lahej as will enable him and render him willing to control various small sub-tribes which are at present subject to no control m practice, and to also make his territories an efficient barrier to the trade in arms from Jibouti. 13. Failing the above recommendation it is, of course, possible to try some of the repressive measures above indicated, or, again, there is still one other alternative, if it is open to us under the Brussels’ Convention, and that is that having regard t 0&gt; the attitude of the French and Italian Governments and to that of the Turkish Government in normal times when not engaged in putting down its rebels, and having regard to the fact that the Aden Hinter land is practically already full of arms, and again to the fact that the weapon which we should supply from Aden would be greatly superior to the LeGras rifle, which the tribesmen now obtain from Jibouti, the present unequal and apparently useless struggle against this trade should be abandoned. No. 6630, dated Aden Residency, the 29th October 1905. From— Major-Geneeal H. H. Mason, Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to Government, Political Department, Bombay. In reference to your letter No. 2107, dated the 31st March last, regarding the illicit importation of arms and ammunition into the Aden Protectorate, I have the honour to now submit the following remarks for the consideration of Government. 2. The latest instructions of Government in regard to the supply of arms and ammunition to the Chiefs of this Protectorate may be summarised as foRows:— A.—'Presentation. (i) The Political Resident may recommend to Government the presenta* tion of rifles of Government bore, except those taking *303 ammunition, to Chiefs of this Protectorate for special reasons. (ii) The Political Resident is authorised to himself present the marginally Abdal . noted Chiefs with ammunition for such Fadthii. rifles to the extent of 250 rounds on one Kishn and Socotra. occasion up to a limit of 750 rounds in a Shehr and Mokalla. x year. To the marginally noted he may similarly present ammunition to the Haushabi. extent of 200 rounds on one occasion up Auiiri ' to a limit of 600 rounds in a year. To other tribes such presentations shall be limited to 100 at a time and 300 in the year. B.—Supply. The Political Resident may issue on payment to the Chiefs of this Pro tectorate rifles of Government bore other than those taking '303 ammunition, and a reasonable quantity of ammunition. Statements of such issues should be forwarded to Government. Indents should be freely supplied so as to create the feeling in the minds of the Chiefs concerned that it is not worth while to go to Jibouti for their supply of arms with the chance of capture on the way back when they can get all the rifles they want of at least as good quality without risk at our Arsenal. C. — Exchange. It is suggested that arms seized in the course of illicit traffic by the Chiefs of this Protectorate should be exchanged for other weapons of Govern ment bore, with a view to inducing Chiefs to interest themselves in making seizures. 3. This Residency is further asked to express an opinion as to whether it would be of use to work the guarding of the coast more energetically or whether— 8 the ship on the station might not be utilised for patrol purposes, or, failing that, whether one or more dhows or a launch might not be fitted out for the work. 4. In your letter No. 5023, dated the 11th August last, it is held that arms captured in the course of illicit traffic should not be returned; it is admitted that particular cases may have special circumstances which render the general policy stated in your first quoted letter No. 2107, dated the 31st March last undesirable. And it was stated that if there was any reason for doubting the Abdali Sultan’s lond-fides in the matter of connivance in the illicit trade in arms it might be probably undesirable to allow him the profit of the operation of that policy. 5. In your letter No. 3461, dated the 2nd June last, this Residency was asked to express an opinion on the provision of an amended Aden Sea Traffic in Arms Regulations, and to report whether any difficulty was experienced by the Hinterland Chiefs in procuring arms via Yemen. 6. It has been partly owing to pressure of other work that a reply to these communications has been so long delayed, but the delay has also been due to the grave importance of the subject which rendered it desirable that the reply should be the result of particularly careful and mature consideration, and has also been due to the desire to discuss the matter with both the Somaliland authorities and also, if possible, the French authorities at Jibouti before expressing any final opinion. 7. Colonel Scallon discussed the subject with General Swayne before leaving Aden and has left certain notes on record, and as it will be impossible for me to visit Jibouti for at least another month, I have the honour to submit the following for the consideration of Government which I will supplement with a further report after visiting Jibouty, which I hope to be able to do on the return of the R. I. M. S. Dalhousie from Bombay next month. 8. At the outset I would remark that this Protectorate is, at the present moment, full of rifles and ammunition, which are chiefly of the Le Gras pattern, and for the most part come from Jibouti. Captain Jacob, the Abdali Sultan, and the Sultan of Shehr and Mokalla have all been addressed as to the supply of arms via Yemen, and the general trend of their replies, and of other enquiries on the subject, is to the effect that, although arms in Yemen are fairly plentiful, comparatively few enter the limits of this Protectorate. The majority come from Jibouti via “ Obokh,” whence they are sent frequently, in small’quantities at a time, either direct to the small coast ports or villages of this Protectorate, or in some cases, possibly, via other coast ports in the vicinity of Mocha. It is probable that a large proportion of the arms sent to the coast ports near Mocha or elsewhere in Turkish limits are locally used or disposed of, but a certain number doubtless find their way with passing caravans into the limits of this Protectorate, and swell the number of those landed direct at our ports. 9. The main facts which I desire to convey for the information of Govern- * ment are, that this Protectorate is already full of rifles, that these rifles are mainly of the Le Gras pattern, and that the main source of supply is Jibouti via the coast, and not from the interior of Yemen. I would add that the Le Gras rifle is much liked by the Arab. It is cheap and of convenient size and pattern, and particularly suitable for the use of those who ride on camels. It is obtained without much real difficulty. The Arabs seem to be able to reload the Le Gras cartridges two or three times, whereas they find it difficult to reload the Martini-Henri cartridge, which more readily splits. As to the risk of obtaining supplies, this is not at present any effective deterrent. 10. Within the limits of this Protectorate, thus full of a cheap and popular weapon of precision, which is in the possession, not only of the armed followers of the more important Chiefs, but of the majority of the tribesmen of even the most petty clan or sub-tribe who reside anywhere within a few days’ march of the coast, it is clear that the introduction of any other weapon and the successful carrying out of the general policy stated in Mr. Hill’s letter under reference, No. 2107, dated the 31st March 1905, must be a matter of considerable difficulty. 11. It is to be considered that, with the single exception of the Sultan of Slier and Mokalln, who keeps a small number of regular and moderately9 trained soldiers, the other Chiefs of this Protectorate at present posjss no Lular soldiery, and have practically no limitations to the numbers of their standing armies! ,n which are practically included all male members of the population capable of carrying arms, and not otherwise engaged or preoccup e . In his address to His Excellency the Governor of Bombay, made »“ * 1903 the Abdali Sultan represented his requirements at 6,000 cartridges a mon&amp; 0 f“ he asked that 200 should be presented free. Over and above this he asked for an unlimited supply of lead and sulphur. 12 It will he remembered in reference to this demand that, in J oUr c ° n “ .. .»'■*«i‘« —w ““rSoi “ . l vs! not be slow to grasp any opportnmty of Ued as is contemplated ^Kar^eS^r^att^of exchange he would p d 2uppo^in g 0 the r introduction of a rifle which would prove more popular ihau the Le G^as rtftTVaH^ roughly f^’rahou?

Behan.10 17. I do not recommend that effect should be given to the suggestion to exchange seized arms for arms of Government bore. If any action is desired to induce the larger Chiefs to interest themselves in making seizures, T would recommend that seized arms be purchased at market rates, and thereupon destroyed or disposed of as Government choose. This would be a more eco nomical course than the proposed exchange. 18. Colonel Scallon has left it upon record that General Swayne was in favour of arming certain of the Protectorate Tribes, and of enforcing a dis armament of all others, and he was inclined to favour a similar policy for this Protectorate. He considered further that the Chiefs of this Protectorate should he required to disarm all their subjects, except those employed in their police, or other regular armed forces, who should, he thought, be armed with rifles of Government bore. He opined that it would, in the long run, prove economical if Government gave the Chiefs a monetary inducement to agree to this action. 19. There is a fair reason to suppose that the general arming of the tribes of this Protectorate with weapons of precision may entail serious trouble and expense in the future, and this is a point to wnich 1 would invite the special consi deration of Government, as quite distinct from the requirements of Somaliland. And with a view to securing the co-operation of the Chiefs, it would seem advisable to, at the outset, reduce the cost price of weapons of Government bore to a minimum, and to even sell them at some loss with a view to securing their introduction. 20. The question of the disarmament of petty tribes and of other than regular or quasi-regular forces is, of course, a serious one, and might quite possibly entail grave difficulties and expense. It is, however, worth considera tion, as possibly saving far greater trouble and expense at a later date. It is a measure which I commend to Government as worthy of careful and early consideration. 21. In this connection I would here mention that Colonel Scallon has also left it upon record that, with a view to checking the Nakhudas of country craft from carrying arms, nominally, for protection, but really for sale, he considered that all arms thus allowed to be carried should be marked and registered, and also entered on the vessel’s manifest. This measure, to be successful, would need the co-operation of not only both British and Italian Somaliland, but also of Turkey, and of the Indian coasts and the Persian Gulf authorities. 22. In regard to other protective and preventive measures, I have the honour to state that I agree with Colonel Scallon in considering that very little really effective action can be taken by H. M. S. stationed at Aden to check the illicit arms traffic. A man-of-war is too large and too valuable to be taken about where coral reefs abound. Her boats and pinnaces are unable to overtake a fast sailing dhow. Her movements cannot be sufficiently secret and unobserved, to be really effective. Past experience on these coasts has proved how very little she can really do. 23. I strongly recommend to Government the early purchase and establish ment of two or three commodious armed dhows fitted with petrol motors, and manned, if possible, by officers and lascars of the Royal Indian Marine. I would propose to post one or two of these to Aden, and another to Perim, instead of, or in addition to, the launch already recommended for that Island in this office £io. 5987, dated the 1st instant. 24. I make this recommendation, after very careful consideration, as the best means of effectively dealing with the matter. The dhows could move freely in all waters and in all weathers during which arms dhows run. The attached motor would render her independent of the breeze, and add to her speed in order to overtake suspicions looking craft. Her movements would attract little attention, and she could proceed unobserved all round the coasts at frequent and uncertain intervals. xP 16 vesse ^ s °fficered and manned by the Royal Indian Marine would e directly under the orders of the Government of India, whose officers have experience of Natives of the East, and are accustomed to deal with Native crews, ihe vessels could be attached to the Royal Indian Marine vessels11 stationed at Aden as tenders, and reliefs could thus he conveniently arranged for the crews. 26. I would venture to add that, should the men-of-war now employed in the Persian Gulf be replaced by vessels and arrangements of this nature made, a saving would probably be effected in the naval charges debited to the Government of India which would probably cover all initial expenditure upon the charge. 27. In addition to the above I would recommend that, at certain ports along the coast, detachments of a local levy corps should be established to watch the coasts and the main routes leading thereto. This is a measure which Government may still consider it desirable to postpone, but I would recom mend its early reconsideration. At present there is little doubt that the control exercised by the Abdali Sultan over the ports of Imran and Khor Umera and Ras-al-Arab is not productive of the desired result, and probably actively to the contrary. 28. I find that this letter has exceeded the length to which I hoped to limit it, and I will, therefore, make my further remarks concerning the proposed amendments to the Aden Sea Traffic in Arms Regulation the subject of another communication, and, as before stated, I thereafter hope to submit a further report upon the state of affairs at Jibouti. 29. As to that I would, for the present, merely state that I have good reason to believe there is an active trade in arms still proceeding between Tajurrah Bay and the coasts of Arabia. A certain M. Grandjean of “ Obokh” is reported to be the prime mover of the enterprise, and, I am informed, includes a certain amount of quiet slave-running with his arms ventures. Extract from a letter, dated the 31st August 1905, from Captain J. B. EUSTACE, Senior Naval Officer, Aden. M. Grandjean, the Government Agent in charge at Obokh, is very nearly a native, having married a Danakil woman ; whilst he wears an Arab dress, and lives in native style. He is reputed to possess seven other native wives, the majority of whom are Abyssinians and represent the toll paid by caravans for permission to traverse French territory. He owns six armed Native dhows (French colours) that act as escorts to Native vessels. Although no arms can officially leave Jibouti, there is never any difficulty in obtaining a clearance from Obokh by vessels engaged in this traffic. M. Grandjean is an excellent linguist, whilst his knowledge of Native customs is unique: and he is doubtless of the very greatest service to his Government in the position he now holds, despite his sympathies for slaving and gun-running. Canoes leave Obokh frequently for Kadduha, to southward of Mocha 9 with from 80—100 rifles in each. ***** Dated Perim, the 21st September 1905. Prom—R. P.

With reference to your No. 5366 of the 3rd September 1905, I have the honour to report that, after full enquiry, I find that the information given you by the Senior Naval Officer, Aden Division, is materially correct with the exception of a few details that do not affect the case, such as the number of women in M. Grandjean’s establishment, etc. M. Grandjean is by no means nearly a native. He is a highly polished French gentleman, and only assumes native garb when in company with his native establishment, and outside, when he goes out into the country, ostensibly for the purpose of shooting: but rumour has it he is not only interested in the Slave Trade but in the Arms Trade as well. The latter is well kuown to all12 who have been to Oboth Of Djibouti. He caa talk Arabic, Somali, Dunkali and Abyssinian like a native, and is much assisted in his private business by his favourite Dunkali wife, an influential woman. He has agents on both coasts, i.e„ the African and Arabian Coasts. He obtains perfect and reliable information of all movements of men-of-war, armed dhows, etc. ^.or instance, when the Captain of H. M. S. Fox left three boats near Tu.ba for cruising, the information was wired to Obokh via Djibouti the same day by hts Agent, in or about Sheikh Saed. To confirm this on Monday morning two of M Grandiean’s dhows came into the harbour with a note from him asking Permission for the crews to he allowed to dive for pearls m the vicinity ot Permi Island. I wrote hack saying that I had no power to grant this permission within territorial waters. Both these dhows are, as a rule, armed but their guns, in' the present ease, had been removed. Both Nakbudas had rifles and brought passes for them signed at Obokh. Neither dhow had pearl fishing apparatus on' hoard Both Nakhudas were in fact spies, to find out about the man-of- war’s boats, and I bad them shadowed during their very short stay. I attach Gr£iiidjean s letter. 3 The presence of ft man-of-Wciir in IPerim is, therefore, nt once known, and the boats employed in carrying arms, or slaves, stand close into the Dhunkali Coast till the man-of-war leaves: hence my suggestion is, that when reliable information is received, the Resident, with say 10 armed sepoys, should go out with a launch from here. H. M. S. Fox’s launch can steam from 6 to 7 knots, and only the day before yesterday a boat, with undoubtedly arms or other contraband on board, simply sailed away from her into Turkish waters and safety. The Perim Coal Company’s steam launch Midge can steam 9 knots, and go out in heavy weather, and it is when a strong breeze blows that these arms traffic boats run. 4. The centre of the Slave Trade is Tajurah, but there is little activity in this trade in comparison to that of arms. 5. In a central position like Perim it seems a pity that foreign telegraph ists are employed by the Eastern Telegraph Company. The Superintendent of this Company is an Italian, and a great friend of M. Grandjean. He also has a friend at Sheikh Syed Telegraph Office, and I offered to take him there in the Government Cutter, he having expressed a desire to go there, but would not go with me. 6. M. Grandjean called at Turba Fort a few days ago, and expressed his indignation at the line showing British Territory as shewn by the boundary pillar erected when Mr. Fitzmaurice was here ; and even now the Turks do not admit our right there, their excuse being that they had no instructions from Constantinople. M. Grandjean also said that the French would have liked some territory there. 7 . Paragraph 6 of this letter is absolutely reliable information. No. 786, Camp Sheik, 14th October 1905 (Confidential). From— Brigadier-General E. J. E. Swayne, Commissioner’s Office, To—The Political Resident, Aden. I have the honour to acknowledge, with thanks, receipt of a copy of Captain Schneider’s letter regarding M. Grandjean. Mons. Grandjean was one of a party of 4 Europeans which included Mons. Manotte, a Swiss Engineer, Mons. Goliez, and a young Italian, who, some three years ago, attempted to convey a consignment of French Rifles into the Ogaden country and so to the Mullah. These men, with 40 Soudanese soldiers, were captured by the Administra tion, some 300 miles inland fron Djibouti, when they were about to enter the waterless Hand to the west of Hargeisa. I investigated the case at the time, and conveyed the party as prisoners over land to Bulbar and to Djibouti, where I handed them over to the French Governor.13 • My impression is that I saw, some three years ago, a confidential report on officials at Djibouti, giving some interesting details as to Mons. Grandjean. The report was, I think, communicated through tiie Aden Residency. Mons., Manotte and his party were described to me by the Acting Governor of Djibouti as adventurers. NOTES. M. Grandjean was one of a party consisting of himself, another French man named Charles Manotte, an Italian Arturo Zanotti, a Swiss named Mark Goliez with 27 Soudanese and 3 Somali followers, which was arrested in July 1900, near Hargeisa, bv order of Colonel Hayes-Sadlier, the Consul- General of the Somaliland Protectorate at that time. This party had applied for, and been refused, permission to proceed for purposes of trade rrom Jibouti into the Ogaden country. They nevertheless proceeded, obviously with the knowledge and connivance of the Jibouti authorities, and were arrested by the 2nd Central Africa Regiment at Hargeisa, and marched down to the coast, and sent back to Jibouti. They had with them 51 rifles and 7,500 rounds of ammunition, and their object is reported to have really been to open up a trade in arms between Jibouti and the Ogaden, contrary to our wishes and to those of the Abyssinian authorities. (Signed) F. de B. Hancock, Capt.t Acting Fivst Assistant Resident, Aden. Aden, 29th October 1905. No. 957-C., Confidential, dated Somaliland, the 8 th November 1906. From— Brigadier-General E. J. E. Swayne, Commissioners Office, To—The Political Resident, Aden. I have the honour to acknowledge, with thanks, recei P t note of the 29th October, forwarded under your endorsement No. 6680, ot the 31st October 1905. ' ^ ^ This is in continuation of my confidential letter of the 14 th October 1905 (No. 786-C). I was charged by Colonel Sadlier to stop the Grandjean-Manotte party on its being known it had entered* the Esa country, within our borders. I proceeded to the vicinity of the Esa Gadabursi frontier with Camel Corps overland, hut eventually, after three weeks delay, that the Frenchmen had had difficulties with the Esa and had been obliged to return. I returned to the east of Somaliland leaving patrols, and instructions to a party o e 2nd King’s African Rifles at Hargeisa under Lieutenant Byrne, to act upon information brought in by the patrols. Eventually, when the Frenchmen came on again from Djibouti they proceeded some 50 miles to what was then rail-head, and then left the train, coming via the Gadabursi country to Dobolek 20 miles west of Hargeisa. Our camelry patrols had given warning, and the detachment 2nd K A.R. was ready to meet and arrest the Trench Caravan, which included 40 Soudanese Asharias ; Information had also been brought to Sheikh, and I started immediately with Camel Corps for the second time. 0 I arrived at Hargeisa a day or two later and conducted an enquiry, which shewed that the Erenchmen had intentions of proceeding across the Hand to the Mullah. They could not have done so, however, as their camels were used up, and they bad made no provision to cross the waterless Hand I eventually sent the 40 Soudanese under a Camel Corps escort to Zeyla and thence to Djibouti, and I personally conveyed the Erenchmen under escort to Bulhar and thence by dhow to Zeyla and Djibouti, where I handed them over to the Governor per interim. The interesting part of the affair was that it was proved that the Governor, whilst informing Colonel Sadlier of the departure of the adventurers, had himself registered the names of the Soudanese and lent his Railway carriage to Mons. Manotte and party. Mons. Manotte assured me that the Governor, judging from his own limitations, had no idea that the British could arrest any one°even 5 miles from the Coast, and it was for this reason that he had thought it safe to give us information and so cover himself. 3956 P. D.14 The young Italian of the party spent most of his small fortune in financ ing his comrades. The rifles were confiscated by us, and later on the Trench authorities at Djibouti asked for the return of the rifles in order to sell them and pay the debts of the abortive expedition. This was refused. 2. Illicit traffic in arms. The Political Resident, Aden, writes under date January 14th:—“I returned to Aden last Monday, dropping General Swavne at Berbera, on my way bach from Jibouti. An official report has been drafted concerning my Visit there, and I hope that it will leave by this mail. Doctor Ormieres, the Governor of Jibouti, was friendly, but rot communicative, and is evidently a different stamp of man to M Pascale, who was Governor when Captain Hill of the Perseus reported a desire to co operate. My report will at least inform Government of the actual state of affairs, and for the rest I chink that every thing must depend upon the result of negotiations at home. “ Meanwhile, however, if Government will sanction the establishment of a post on Ras-al-Arah, and perhaps also at Makatin and Balaliaf, and also the necessary expenditure for a Preventive steamer and a few dhows, we can do a good deal within the limits of our own territory, not only to check the illicit arms traffic but to preserve better order generally on our littoral. With the Padthli and Mokalla I think that special treaty arrangements are desirable for the proper issue of regular port clearances, etc. And incidentally I would mention that there is a good deal of opinion in favour of the establishment of a Lighthouse at Ras-al-Arah, which w r ill in due course constitute another argu ment in favour of the establishment of a post at that particular spot. Imran we may be able to watch with our dhows, but for the present it would be desirable to establish a post of our own there too at an early dato, in place of that which the Abdali Sultan at present maintains, more with the view of evading the rules to his own benefit than observing them for ours. No. 325, dated Aden Residency, the 17th January 1906. (Confidential.) Front— Major-General H, M. Mason, Political Resident at Aden, To—His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for India. With reference to your telegram, dated the 20th ultimo, I have the honour to submit herewith copy of a report No. 265, dated 14th instant, which I sent by last mail to the Government of Bombay, together with its accom paniments, on the subject of my recent visit to Jibouti, in company with General E. J. E. Swayne, and of the illicit traffic in arms generally. 2. I have addressed several other communications on the same subject to the Government of Bombay, since my letter No. 187, dated 9th October 1904, concerning which you will doubtless be addressed in due course through the usual official channels. But meanwhile I have the honour to enclose copy of a letter No. 6630, dated the l9th October 1905, which deals at more length with the subject than most of the other reports. 3. The reports above referred to may be considered sufficient to show that considerable traffic in arms does stilli take place from Drench territory with dangerous effects to this Protectorate, as well as to British Somaliland, but the; following further details may also prove of interest to the Foreign Office. 4. On the 26th of January 1905, Captain A. R. Hulbert, Commanding H. M. S. Proserpine, paid a visit to the port of Imran, over which the Abdali Sultan is under present arrangements charged with; the control. There he found that there were a large number of rifles in the village, of which the greater number were French and marked “ Chateau Renault.” He saw and handled several himself, and was informed by the inhabitants that there were then about 90 rifles in the village. As a result of his visit he expressed the opinion that Imran was an important depot for traffic in arms, and I have no reason, to doubt that arms from Jibouti have been frequently landed there. This visit was reported to the Government of Bombay in February 1905, when it was pointed out that there was reason to believe that the Abdali Sultan was personally interested in the arms traffic, and derived profit therefrom.15 5* In May 1905, information was received in tbis office from two sources of the import of arms to small ports on the shores of tbis Protectorate, A Somali informant laid stress on the fact that Arabs experienced no difficulty in purchasing arms of Jibouti, which they afterwards sold to Somalis. 6. On the 18th June 1905, a dhow flying Turkish colours was arrested by H. M. S. Perseus in Imran Bay, with four French rifles and twenty-nine rounds of ammunition concealed on board. She was subsequently released by order of the Bombay Government, in view of the master’s contention that he was only carrying the arms for his personal defence. 7. In the course of various interviews held wiih the Sheikh of the Juledi sub-tribe of the Subehis in the course of the year 1905, it was perfectly apparent that the import of French rifles and ammunition was a common occurrence on the Attifi littoral between Sheikh Said and Aden. 8. Both the senior naval officer of the Aden Division and the Assistant Resident, Perim, have also reported similar imports on the Turkish littoral lying to the north of Sheikh Said. 9. Last December, the Assistant Resident, Perim reported the following instances:— (a) On the 24th November 1905, a dhow—the Fateh-abKhair —com manded by Muhammad Hassan left Jibouti and landed 50 rifles and 10 boxes of ammunition at Ras-al-Arab. (bj On the 25th November 1905, the dhow Al Heiaj, commanded by Annbukkur Abdulla al Maabi left Jibouti and landed 100 rifles and 20 boxes of ammunition at Dubab. (e) On the 25th November 1905, a dhow commanded by one Raid Abdula left Jibouti with 80 rifles and 10 boxes of ammunition, which he landed at Kadha. These instances were doubtless not based upon absolutely unimpeachable information, but were probably in the main correct. 10. In the third paragraph of my report No. 265, dated 14th instant, I have alreary remarked upon the traffic between Lahej and Haura, on the east coast of this Protectorate., And I can confid ently assert that a considerable traffic in arms takes place on that coast, as well as on the coast lying to the west of the Protectorate. Only a few days ago I was informed by a reliable Native State official that many French rifles found their way into the interior of the Aulaki district vid Balahaf. ... 11. A few days ago I received a letter from the Sultan of tbe Aulaki* in which 1 was^ asked to&gt; assist one of his agents-to proceed to Jibonti wheie the Sultan desired him to expend $ 300 on the purchase of rifles. 12. It would seem unnecessary to multiply instances in support of the contention that arms traffic is rife within the limits of this Protectorate. 13; This undoubtedly affects British Somaliland, but also seriously affects this Protectorate. Only yesterday a postal runner carrying the mails was shot within a short distance of the British village of Sheikh Othman, and has since died : the mail being robbed. I have reason to believe that his assailants were probably Attifi Subehis, and that they were armed with rifles of French manufacture imported direct from Jibouti or Obokh to their coasts. 14. This is of course only a single incident of passing importance, but should it be proved that the assailants were Attifis, and should it be decided to take measures to secure their punishment or arrest, it is needless to point out that, with the greater number of the Subehi tribes fully armed with French- weapons of precision, this will prove a far more serious undertaking than would otherwise be the case. 15. Similarly, any other action of a repressive or corrective nature, which circumstances may any day necessitate, will be fraught with enhanced risk and difficulty for a similar cause.Memorandum from Major-General H.

No. 265, dated Aden Residency, the 14th January 1906 (Confidential). Prom— Major-General H. M. Mason, Political Resident at Aden, To—The Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. With reference to your letter No. 8298, dated 22nd December 1905,1 have the honour to inform you that last week I visited the Port of Jibouti in company with General E. J. E. Swayne, C.B., Bis Majesty’s Commissioner and Commander in-Chief of the Somaliland Protectorate, and to now forward the fun her communication indicated in paragraph 28 of my letter No. 6630, dated the 29th October last. 2. Erom the attached copy of a note of the interview which was held with His Excellency the Governor of Jibouti on the 5th January 1906, it will appear that very little information was afforded by that official, and also that he was unable to consider any further co-operation in the matter of checking the illicit arms traffic, in the absence of instructions from his Government. 3. I need not further remark upon the fact that an indiscriminate traffic in arms actually does take place between the African and the Arabian Coasts of the Red Sea. This Protectorate is full of cheap Erench rifles and cartridges, and there is no doubt that this supply emanates from Jibouti. I have every reason to believe that a considerable amount of direct traffic has quite recently taken place between Obokh and the ports situated on the west coast of this Protectorate, and it was only last month that I received credible information of the successful landing of a direct shipment of 50 rifles and 10 boxes of ammunition to Ras-al-Arab. Only recently, also, I have received credible information of the purchase of French rifles at Lahej, and of their subsequent sale at the port of Haura, on the east coast of the Protectorate. 4. I have no reason to doubt that a traffic of this nature still actively continues. Arms are imported on the coast lying to the west of Aden, are transported overland, many of them via Lahej, to the ports lying to the east of Aden. And from there, of course, re-importation to the coast of Africa via the Italian Protectorate or portions of the British Protectorate is compara tively simple, and in all probability considerable. The mere fact that Erench rifles and ammunition are plentiful and cheap on the littoral of this Protec torate constitutes proof of the traffic. And from the above it is evident that the Somali Coast, as well as this Protectorate, is undoubtedly affected. 5. It will be observed from the attached note of an interview that Doctor No. 136. dated 6th December 1901, Africa. OrmifereS, « hilst Committing himself to the general statement that the export or arms to Yemen was forbidden, was nevertheless unable to define the extent of the littoral affected by this prohibition. It will^be remembered that in December 1901 Sir E. Monson made men tion of M. Singer’s statement that the French Government were powerless prevent the shipping at Jibouti of arms on vessels destined for ports outside the zone in which the sale of arms and spirituous liquors was forbidden, and that this attitude of the French Government was also referred to in Govern ment of India despatch No. 83, dated 21st April 19Q4, to the Secretary of17 State for India. The same attitude appears to have been taken in more recent correspondence wherein, whilst an assurance is given that all necessary measures have been taken to enforce the observance of the provisions of the Brussels Act, relating to the prohibition of the sale of arms of precision in Africa, there is no allusion to the export of arms from Jibouti to the opposite coast of Arabia, for possible re-exportation to the coast of Africa. And it will be noted that Doctor Ormibres 5 present assurance, that the export of arms to the Yemen is forbidden, is inconsistent with the above, and possibly not quite accurate. 6. I would here invite reference to the attached note of a discussion which I had with General Swayne on the bth instant as to further measures to be taken to check the illicit arms traffic. Prom the third paragraph of this, and from the tenth paragraph of the note of interview with Doctor Ormiei es, it will appear that General Swayne concurs with me in the opinion that further action is desirable to carry out the spirit of the wording of the first part of Article X of the Brussels’* Convention and to, if possible, extend the restrictions imposed in the arms and spirituous liquors zone of that Convention to the whole of the slave zone referred to in Article XXI. 7. The wording of Article X of the Convention “or the passage thereof to regions where the slave trade is rife ” (soit le passage veis les regions ou sevhTla Traite), would seem to justify a request for further co-operation in the directions above indicated. And where Article 6 of the Agreement of 1^88 is also taken into consideration, it would not appear that local French autho rity is really justified in either withholding information, or declining co-oper ation when called upon to do so. 8. It will be observed that General Swayne handed Doctor Ormieres a copy of the latest Somaliland Fire-arms Regulations, and that, nevertheless, no effective response was forthcoming. Under Article Xl of the Brussels Con ference it would not appear that Doctor Ormieres was justified m this lack ot 11 12 * * * * responsiveness. 9. I would here invite attention to Doctor Ormibres’ remarks concerning Obokh, which appear inconsistent with the assertions contained m M. Rouvier s lerter to Sir F. Bertie, dated 13th September last, concerning that port. In point of fact I have reason to believe that Obokh, so far from being a peventive port, as would appear from M. Rouvier’s reference thereto, is the actual centre of a considerable amount of direct traffic in arms witi e coas o^ Arabia. The traffic in arms between Obokh and Kadduha is, I see, referred to by the Senior Naval Officer of the Aden Division m bis despatch to the Cominander-in-Chief of the East Indies, dated 1st September 1905 of which a copy has been forwarded to me with your Xo. 8316, dated ^2ud ultimo. The antecedents of M. Grandjean, the official posted to that port, are such as to confirm the possibility of his himself taking a part in^ffie traffic under reference. (See Appendix A attached.) „ , ,, , 10. I see that Captain Eustace in the same despatch refers to the part taken in this and the slave trade by Rohaite dhows, and it would seem prob able that Doctor Ormi&amp;res; statement regarding the Sultan ot that district is not without some foundation. 11. Doctor Ormibres* reference to Abyssinia is also deserving of considera tion, audit is a somewhat curious coincidence that, only this week, it has been brought to my notice that there has just been an exchange ot handsome pre sents between Ras Makonen and the Abdali Sultan, and to the connec ion o the latter with the arms traffic reference has frequently been made. I am not aware of what rules or regulations may exist in Abyssinia m regard to me traffic in arms, but would appear desirable that rules should exist there, and be in line with those issued in British Somaliland and elsewhere m the region affected. 12. General Swayne concurs with me as to the desirability of the various rules and regulations issued on the subject by the different authorities conc erned being, as far as possible, similar in effect and general principle, and, with that in view, as to the desirability of a common exchange of views. 3956 F*. D,13. So far as Jibouti is concerned, I am of opinion that their mles should as closely as possible correspond with the latest Somaliland Fire-aims Regu lations, copy attached, in which it will be observed that there is provision [4 (1)1 against the fraudulent re-importation of arms to the prohibited zone. But I am also of opinion, as aforesaid that the slave zone, which of course in cludes the littoral of this Protectorate, as well as that of the Persian Gulf, should be considered as included in the prohibited zone. 14. If any preventive post is established ,at Obokh, it should be under responsible and efficient surveillance, and I consider that, to check illicit traffic in the Gulf of Tajurrah, it is necessary that the French authorities should maintain a similar service of preventive dhows and steamers to that maintained by other powers concerned. 15. I am also of opinion that it is desirable that local rules should be framed at Jibouti on the lines of the Regulation* III of 1902 made applicable at Aden, and, I think that, if these arrangements can be effected, the illicit traffic in arms would be sufficiently checked, even granted the continued importation of arms from Europe to Jibouti. 16. It is clear, however, that the most effective check to the evil complained of would be the imposition of more stringent restrictions upon the export of arms from Europe to within the limits of the prohibited zone, and it is with this in view that I concur with General Swayne in the opinion that a check is desirable before the Suez Canal is left for the Red Sea. 17. Turning now to a consideration of the question of Italian co-operation, I have the honour to state that I concur with General Swayne in the opinion that it is most desirable that this should be more thorough. In this connec tion I attach copy of a minute dated the 20th ultimo, drawn up by Captain Hancock, and of his note of an interview with Commendatore Pestalozza on the subject, dated 29th December 1905. 18. There is no doubt that the control at present exercised by the Italian Government over the littoral of their Somaliland Protectorate is very small, and that their assumption of control over Bunder Cassim is more nominal than real. Commendatore Pestalozza is now anxious to establish control at Ras Alula as well as at Bunder Cassim, and is also, of course, anxious to so establish himself at these ports as to provide for the recoupment by customs taxation of the expenses incurred by bis Government in maintaining even their present position on the coast. It is most desirable that the control exercised over this portion of the littoral of the African coast should be more effective. 19. This is, of course, more desirable from the point of view of the other Somali Coast authorities than from the point of view of this administration. But from both points of view it is equally, or rather more, desirable that the control exercised by ns over the littoral of this Protectorate should also be more effective. I have previously remarked upon the danger to the peace and progress of this Protectorate, arising from the indiscriminate traffic in fire-arms of precision, and I need not further remark upon the extent to which Somali land is affected. 20. If the Essa tribe of Somalis seriously hinder the progress and pros perity of the Jibouti-Harrar railway, it will probably be mainly due to their possession of fire-arms which first left Jihouti for the neighbouring Arabian Const. ^ If the Somaliland Mullah, or the Mijjertein Sultan, again give trouble in British or Italian Somaliland, it will probably be mainly due to the same cause. The arduous and protracted nature of the recent revolt in Yemen illus trates the difficulties entailed in Turkish Arabia, and I am confident that, within the limits of this Protectorate, the harm resulting from the traffic under reference will one day prove one of serious proportions. 21 21. 'With a view to the exercise of a more effective control over the littoral of this protectorate, I have the honour to recommend the early establishment of a Preventive Service of armed dhows and steamers. The attached note by Captain Hancock, based upon his recent discussion with Captain Cordeanx, shows, approximately, the nature and cost of the undertaking. The cost is not inconsiderable, but the ultimate object to he gained may be held to justifyit. Granted that it may not be desirable to too rapidly extend our influence in the interior, it cannot be disputed that our position on the littoral ol t e Gulf of Aden and the Persian Gulf is a matter of grave importance. 22 At Ras-al-Arah I consider it most desirable that a post should now be established, and that an efiective control should be exercised over the petty Attifi tribes, which have consistently ignored our wishes and defied our 0()i p* mands, not only in regard to the traffic in arms, but also in regard to the general preservation of order. It is not long ago that I brought to the no ice of Government the case of an Italian subject murdered upon the coast, the perpetrator of which crime has never been brought to justice and, according o my information, this is only one of several acts of a similar nature committe in the vicinity of Has-al-Arab. 23. It was at our instance that acts of piracy, committed by the Zaramk tribes, have recently been punished by the Hodeida aurhorities, and it behoves us to maintain a more perfect order upon the comparatively limited extent of our own littoral. In the accompaniment to Sir N. O Connor s secret letter ;No. 818. dated 20th November last, there is mention of the arrangement now being made by the Turkish Government to exercise a more effective control over their coast, and I am of opinion that we are called upon to adopt similar measures for the better control of our own. 24. I would, therefore, recommend that early arrangements should be made to furnish Perim with a small armed revenue steamer, and Aden witu Two or three armed dhows. I concur with Captain Eustace as to the madvis- ability of using modern ships of costly type to cruise amongst the reefs and unsurveyed waters of Arabia; and X consider that the steamer employed should have a minimum speed of 12 knots, and be of as shallow a draft as is consistent with seaworthiness. 25. As to his suggestion that allarms carried by British-ownedcraft should be registered, this has already been referred to in paragraph 21 of this office No 6630, dated 29fch October 1905. It is, however to be remarked that a^cordino to my information, comparatively few British-owned craft now do carrv arms^and that this check, to be in any way effective, needs the entire co-operation of all other Powers and authorities concerned. 26. Before concluding this letter I have the honour to remark that I am, upon careful consideration, inclined to the opinion that, ^ *he gen interests of trade, it is desirable to so modify Regulation IH of 1902 as whibt leavino- the prohibiting and penal clauses, to omit the clauses under wmen the furnishino* of security is made compulsory. Captain Hancock s interview with'commendat.ore Pesfalozza illustrates the effect of these clauses upon the trade of Aden I know ttiat the furnishing of the requisite security bonds is a m itter of no little trouble and difficulty to many masters of native craft, and leads in some cases, to tiresome delay, and m others, perhaps, to actual loss iu’utwT am inclined to fear that, the result is to make Aden a less attractive port of call to native craft, I think that the prohibiting an P'™- clauses of the enactment, when modified, as recently suggested, should have the desired effect. It is clear that in the absence of the co-operation of other ports tbis provision must tend to the detriment of this. 27 Lastlv I would here again remark that I consider it desirable that our protective iarrangement should extend to the east coast as well as the west of the Protectorate. The Lower Aulaki Sultan has only last week pressed Snle the assumption of control over the ^ • we have frequently been invited to intervene. With the larger states Mokaila and the Eadthli, I consider that special treaty arrangements are desirable • 28. In my previous letter I have referred to the futility of tlie AMali Sultan’s control over the western littoral, and I woula here only repeat that, so far as he is concerned, I would favour measures that should confine h access to the seaboard to the main port of Aden. With our own P° s Perim, Kas-al-Arah and Aden we should be able to exercise an efficient control over our western seaboard without any extraneous assistance.20 Memorandum from M 4 &gt; 0 E-Gffl&lt;BEAi H.

He referred to the lawless and practically uncivilized character of the Subehi, and of some of the other tribes of South-Western Arabia, into whose possession these weapons fell. He referred to the danger and inconvenience experienced in the Aden Hinterland oumg to the ease uith which rifles and ammunition would now be obtained throughout the 1 epen ency. And he invited Doctor Ormieres to consider the possibility ot taking turtner measures to check the indiscriminate traffic in arms which was, apparently, still taking place between Jibouti and the littoral of South-Western Arabia. 2. Doctor Ormiferes replied that the export of rifles to the Yemen was forbidden. He could not, however, afford any definite information as to the extent of the littoral to which this prohibition extended. He said that every thing possible was being done to regulate the trade m arms and to restrict the dissemination thereof on the Somali Coast. He said that only recently i had come to his notice that component parts of arms were being imported to Jibouti with a view to evading the customs and other rules on the subject, and that orders had been issued on the 30th December last to meet this. 3. He appears to recognise the inconvenience arising from the possession of arms of precision by uncivilized and lawless tribes, and to understand that the Subehi tribes might occupy in regard to the Aden administration a some what similar position to that occupied by the Essa tribe of Somalis in regard to Jibouti. He also appeared to recognise the risk of re-importation to Somaliland of the arms exported to Arabia. He referred to the similar risk of the re-importation of the arms supplied to Abyssinia. Only two months ago he said that there had been a consignment of 1,800 rifles to Has Makomen at Harrar, and he evidently regarded it as possible that some of these would even tually find their way back to the coast and into the possession of those who should not properly possess them. He also referred to the risk of importation of arms from Muskat in the Persian Gulf, 4. He referred to the difficulty of exercising an affective control over the transport of arms by sea in native craft, and seemed well aware of the various devices resorted to for evading restrictions. He said that he had reason to believe that the Sultan of Rohaita took some part in the illicit arms traffic, from which he derived considerable profit. This Sultan he stated occupied a position which rendered it difficult to exercise an effective control over his littoral. Till recently he had been a tributary of both the french and the Italian Governments. Upon a recent representation of the latter he had now ceased to be a Drench tributary. 5. It was suggested to Doctor Ormieres that with a view to further checking the illicit traffic in arms it was desirable that the different authorities concerned should act in concert, and the various rules and regulations issued by them should be as far as possible similar in effect and general principle. General Swayne handed him a copy of the Somaliland Dire-arms Regulations, dated 2nd September 1905, and a comparison of this witii the regulations issued at Jibouti was invited. In reply Doctor Ormikres stated that the orders21 which he received from time to time from his Government were of a confiden tial nature. Certain rules had, however, been published, and he retired for a- few minutes into his Secretariat to get these. 6. Upon his return from his office he was evidently less inclined to he communicative than before, He stated that beyond a general prohibition of the illicit export of arras there were no particular rules on the subject except such as were embodied in the ordinary Police Holes of the Settlement, or in circulars issued on various points such as that already referred to regarding the import of component parts of arms. Even that order, he said, was net in print and had been sent to his Home Government for confirmation. It became apparent that Doctor Ormibres did not find himself in a position to produce any regular body of rules or regulations for comparison with those of the British Somaliland Protectorates, and that he was either unable or unwilling to furnish any further information on the subject. 7. In turning the conversation he referred to his recent experiences as an official in the French Congo, \*here it transpired that the nature of the' administration was not a little affected by commercial requirements. From this it might be understood that the administration of Jibouti was perhaps somewhat similarly situated, and that the commercial interests of the local colonists were a not unimportant factor in the situation. 8. In regard to the Obokh, Doctor Ormi^res stated that native craft sailing from Jibouti were not under the necessity of having their papers vised at that port. Port clearances, he said, were only granted there to vessels to which it was inconvenient to proceed to Jibouti or to which it was convenient to touch at Obokh. 9. Doctor Ormikres was informed of the arrangements existing at Aden under which native craft leaving that port for British Somaliland were' hound over to first call at certain prescribed ports on the coast before proceed ing elsewhere. And it was suggested to him that similar arrangements might be made at Jihouti in regard to vessels leaving that port or Obokh for the Aden Protectorate. Doctor Ormi&amp;res was at first inclined to concur with this suggestion if the proposal were formally made to him. But after his visit to his office he expressed a desire that this and any other proposals should in the first place be referred to the home authorities, 10. He expressed a similar desire in regard to the suggestion that similar restrictions to those imposed in the zone referred to in Ardcle VIII of tlie Brussels* Convention of 1890 should be extended to the slave zone referred to in Article XXI, or that anyhow further action was desirable to carry out the spirit of the wording of the first part of Article X. 11. It was evident that Doctor Ormibres himself was not in a position to afford any further information or to take any further specific action towards checking the traffic in arms now taking place between the Somali and the Arabian Coasts. He expressed a general desire to co-operate and assist. He was clearly animated by friendly motives; but the interests of the local colonists were evidently predominant, and he was undoubtedly reminded of this fact in the course of the few minutes during which he had retired to his office and there met the local administrator. 12. Later in the day he again broached the subject of the General Swayne, and whilst again expressing friendly sentiments and a personal inclination to accept the general principle of prescribed ports, he again also expressed his inability to take any independent action, and evinced some anxiety to avoid committing himself to anything which might in any way prejudice the interests of the local colonists. _ F. DeB. HANCOCK, Captain, 6th January 1906. Acting First Assistant Resident, Aden. Notes of discussion between General H. M. Mason and General E. J. E. Swayne as to measures which should be taken to further check illicit traffic in arms, held on board R. I. M. S. Ralhousie on 6 th January 1906. It was agreed upon that it was desirable that there should be an exchange of views between all local authorities concerned with a view to more concerted22 action and the issue of a common set of rales and regulations under Articles VIII to XIV of the Brussels Convention. 2. The authorities most concerned were those of Great Britain, Prance and Italv. Turkey, however, was equally or even more concerned and should therefore be also asked to exchange views. 3 It was agreed upon as desirable that similar restrictions to those imposed in the zone referred to in Article VIII of the Brussels Convention should be extended to the whole of the Slave Zone referred to in Article XXI. 4. It was agreed that it would be of advantage if certain specified ports on the Coast of the Aden Protectorate, e.g.&gt; Perim, Bas-al-Arab and Aden were prescribed for the vis6 and examination of dhows’ papers before other ports in the vicinity were allowed to be visited. 5. It was agreed upon as necessary that both the Aden Protectorate and the Somali Coast littorals should be provided with an efficient service of Pre ventive dhows and steamers. 6. It was agreed upon as essential that arrangements should be made on the coast of Italian Somaliland to correspond with those made in British Somaliland. General S wayne pointed out the necessity of perfecting his arrangements as soon as possible with a view to securing the early and more thorough co-operation of Italian authorities. It was agreed that with this in view the matter of supplying him with an efficient Protective steamer to supervise and assist bis dhow service was one of pressing urgency. 7. It was generally agreed that with an efficient preventive_ service of steamers and dhows a good deal could be done to check the illicit traffic in arms, and that the smuggling could also be much checked by the framing of a common set of rules and regulations for the whole of the littoral affected. 8. It was however agreed that the most effective check to the evil would be to prohibit the import of fire-arms into Eastern waters at all, or anyhow to impose more rigorous restrictions thereon, which might be arranged for by a special inspection post at Suez* E. de B. HANCOCK, Cattain, Acting First Assistant Resident, Aden, MINUTE. The understanding entered into with the Italian Consulate only affects dhows proceeding to the Italian Protectorate. On the 23rd June 1902, it was arranged between Captain Pottinger and the Italian Consul that such dhows should first call at Hais, a port in the British Protectorate, for examination, etc. The arrangement was that we should issue port clearances to such vessels upon the Italian Consul’s certificate that they had furnished security to him. In his No. 188, dated 2nd July 1902, the Political Besident remarked that there were grounds for supposing that certain dhows had been evading our rules by sailing for ports in the Italian Protectorate, and thence sending their cargoes overland to British Somaliland. He pointed out that the Italian Government had no regular port on their coast where' ( dhows could be inspected, as they were at Berbera, Karam and Hais in our Protectorate. He said that the Italian Consul had readily promised to address his Government with a view to establishing such a port at Bunder Kassim, and had meanwhile agreed that Mijjertein dhows bound for their own country should be made to give security to the Italian Consulate that they would touch first at Hais to show their papers, etc , the ISlakhuda of each dhow being supplied with a certificate signed by the Italian Consul-General to the effect that they had given the requisite security. It was understood, and later in the Italian Consul’s letter of 1st December 1902 formally agreed, that “ the Mijjertein coast should be subject to the local rules for the traffic of sambuks in the Gulf of Aden,” that is to say, that Mijjertein dhows should, as all other dhows leaving or arriving at the Port of Aden, be subject to the provisions of Regulations ill of 1902 and rules framed thereunder.28. Asa matter of fact, of course, Regulation III stiould have been modified accordingly to include the Mijjertein coast. It was not; and it follows, I think, that no prosecution is possible under Regulation III for breach of any of the provisions of that Regulation affecting the Mijjertein coast only. As far as that coast is concerned the only means of enforcing compliance with local rules lay in the security bonds furnished to the Italian Consulate which, the Italian Consul could presumably forfeit in the event of a breach of his terms being proved to his satisfaction. But as far as the coast of British Somaliland east of Berbera and places on the Arabian coast of the Gulf of Aden are concerned, local rules can, of course, be enforced and prosecutions where necessary conducted, under e Regulation III, of all dhows, Mijjertein as well as others. li a dhow touched at one of our ports, she is bound by our rules whether she is proceeding else where or not. Dhows visiting British Somaliland at all are bound by our ru es to call at certain prescribed ports and not to proceed from that or other ports m British Somaliland without the permission of the proper authority at tne prescribed port. Such dhows should be bound over before they leave Aden imder section 3 of the Regulation, and on their return should be dealt with, 11 necessary, under section 4 (2). # t . The mere fact of their touching at Italian ports after visiting British ports cannot be held to free them from this liability. In that case the Regu lation would be useless. Further, it was, as above pointed out, the obvious intention of the Italian Consul, in 1902, that the Mijjertein coast should be treated as under our rules. And there is therefore no claim on the part of Italy that their ports shou e allowed to be a place of refuge for evasion of our rules, etc. On the 9th January 1908, I see that Colonel Ashby informed the Italian Consul that the understanding as to security being furnished to him on y affected dhows proceeding to the Mijjertein coast, and pointed out t a ows proceeding to Mokalla and the Arabian coast should of course furnish y direct to us. It is of course equally clear that dhows proceeding to British Somaliland, east of Berbera, should also furnish security direct to us. Since the understanding above referred to was arrived at, the only modi fication has been that, in October of 1S03, a port, Bunder Kassim, ac ua 7 ^ established by the Italian authorities on the Mijjertein coast, ibis, accora- ingly for Italian dhows, took the place of Hais. Bunder Kassim in fact became for Italian Somaliland a prescribed port like Berbera, Karam and Hais are for British Somaliland. Upon this being effected there was still more cause for Regulation III to be so modified as to include Italian Somaliand. This was not, however, In his letter, dated 27th October 1908, Signor Olivio simply said that it was agreed that henceforth dhows intending to deal with the ports o a 1 Somaliland should first call at Bunder Kassim, and should no ea ® leave Aden until their papers had been signed by the Italian Consu ar au ^ * He did not say until they had furnished security to first call at Bunder Kassim, etc. But that, of course, was part of the former uuderstan i . remained. It should have been simplified. On the 28th October, „ i. Consul was asked whether he wished all dhows proceeding to j tal i aa land to have their papers vised at his Consulate or only Mijjertein n, answer appears to have been received to this. There was scope understanding. . , As to port clearances, we only can furnish them in Aden. It is our P° r &gt; and we only can certify that all our regulations have been co! p • Those now furnished by the Italian Consulate a v e £ or ; 0 f understanding arrived at, the proper procedure should be ^ a hi vessels manifested for Italian ports our clearances should be 3 US V1S ^ ^ Italian Consul before I sign them, and that they should also be accompanied by a certificate of any security which they have furnished to e Consulate. It would seem most convenient that a copy of the security » which should be framed on the lines of ours, should be attached. It wouldr.~- '» 24. more convenient still, as I have already implied, if the Italian Somali Coast were just included in our Regulation and the security was furnished to us. There would then be no legal difficulty about forfeiting the bond if necessary, which there might otherwise be. And we could further prosecute under our Regulation III and give really practical eifect to the desire of tlie Italian Consul to oo-operate with us in the suppression of the illicit traffic in arms and of smuggling generally. We could go further and add a clause in the Regulation providing, under certain circumstances, to prohibit visits to certain ports or places under penalty of forfeiture of bond or prosecution. And we have recently been given to understand that the British and Italian Commissioners of Somaliland desire action to be occasionally taken in this direction. Our understanding with the Italian Consul should, if possible, clearly include some provision in regard to Italian Somaliland similar to those contained in sect : on 4 (2) (5) of Regulation III. In the absence of written permission from Bunder Kasim, dhows should be liable to penalty for departure from that or other ports. R. de B. HANCOCK, Captairii Acting First Assistant Resident. Aden, The 20th Decemler 1905. f I Notes of Interview. Commendatore Pestalozza called on me this morning to discuss the case of Makhuda Mahood Arrlay, and also my Minute dated 20th instant. 2. As to Nakhuda Mahmood, he stated that papers were furnished to him on the 13th June last, but that he had not been called upon to furnish any security to first visit any particular prescribed port. He said that for some time past the practice of taking security in accordance with the understanding arrived at in 1002 to generally conform with our rules on the subject had been discontinued. He was inclined to urge that the undertaking to conform with our rules had lapsed when Bander Kassim was established as the prescribed port for Italian Somaliland. But 1 pointed out that there seemed to be no good reason to presume this. And he did not press the point. 3. On the other hand, he said that just lately the practice of taking security had been revived. But it transpired that the security demanded was not based upon our local rule of Bs. 10 per ton, subject to a minimum charge Rs. 100, but did not in any case exceed Rs. 100. Further, either the Rs. 100 itself was taken as security or else one single surety was taken. In reply to my questions the Commendatore said that this surety was generally a British subject, and 'some individual more or less guaranteed by the police. I further gathered that the security was, as often as not, not taken at all. 4. Commendatore Pestalozza agreed that there might be difficulties about enforcing forfeiture of the bond.. He had never had to do so yet. The bonds were taken more by way of a show of restraint than with any actual ultimate intention of forfeiting them, if the terms were infringed. 5. He was inclined to agree that it would he better if the bonds were taken by me as other bonds, and if the Italian Coast were covered by our regulation altogether. But this, he said, was a matter which he would have to carefully consider and to refer to Rome. 6. It transpired in the course of the interview that the control actually exercised by the Italian Government at Bander Kassim was slight and that at times when the dhows, whose officers were the only representatives of the Italian Government on the Somali Coast, were elsewhere engaged, actually non-existent. Commendatore Pestalozza hoped that in due course a more effectual control would be established, includiug a regular place of official residence for himself, the Commissioner of Italian Somaliland. He hoped that this would be established also over Ras Alula as well as Bander Kassim. 7. Meanwhile, he was inclined tothink that too drastic enforcement of our rules might injuriously affect the trade of Aden. Even now, he said, that mian increasing number of Mijjertein dhows plied between their^ own ports and Mokalla instead of coming to Aden I admitted that this might certainly be the case, but that, with the main object of checking illicit traffic in arms m view, it was desirable that as much as possible of the littoral should be included in our mutual arrangements. Mokalla, I pointed out, mighty be^ included in our arrangements as a prescribed port. And i thought that this might possibly be done hereafter. 8 I pointed out that if prescribed port^ were arranged at Perim, Aden, ghugra Balahaf, and Mokalla, an effective control could be exercised over the coasts of South-West Arabia and that similar measures were desirable from Berbera right round to IHig. He agreed in principle. 9. Meanwhile it was evidently clear to him that under present arrange ments, the por^s of Italian Somaliland were favourably situated as compared to the ports of British Somaliland, in that dhows could go there either without a security bond or with a comparatively light one. This was an advantage which he was not apparently inclined to give up for the mere purpose of co-oper ating with us to check the illicit traffic in arms. He remarked, however, that he would discuss the matter with the Mijjertein Sultan and think over it, and that he did think that it was desirable that we should co-operate heartily together. 10. He pointed out that it was actually some trouble to Nakhudas to furnish requisite security to me. 1 said that I was sparing no effort to make this simpler and less trouble. 11 He agreed that he had no authority to issue a port clearance for the port of Aden, and that the present form used at his Consulate was irregular and unnecessary. It really was only intended to be a bill of health. He agreed that it mi^ht be covenient if he vised port clearances instead of furnishing those forms? He pointed out that recently he had stated on those forms that euarantees (security) had been furnished. He could do the same on the por clearance form itself if desired. I suggested that the form used at his Consulate might be so modified as to include (а) reference to the health of the port; (б) reference to the fact that security had been furmsed. As a matter of fact I added that there seemed no reason why lie should not use security forms similar to ours. I said I would make out some sample lot ms for his consideration. , . _ . i, ^ t 12 He said that Italian vessels had other papers which they had to get from him before sailing. I replied that doubtless that was the ease wherever they 1 might “ceding, but that it did not affect the present questron. He ^ 13 it should, I think, be here noted that under present eireumstanoes Italian Somaliland scores a material advantage over Bnt.sh Somahland m the laxitv with which this matter is treated. Further, oui Regula ion must oTearly fail of any real effect unless and until the Italian authorities more ^'^If it fs of anv real interest to us to keep arms out of Somaliland, then a fuller co-operation should be pressed for at once. _ 14. Incidentally it might here be noted that a more effective “ ntro1 thecoasttothenonh-westof Aden including f and Kas-al-Arah or some other port or prescribed P orts effect in the desired direction irrespective of Italian oo-opera i • 15 As to French co-operation Commendatore Pestalozza said that the Fre c authorities would be found apparently most friendly and 1 “ clln ® d ^ They had rules which nominally prohibhed illicit “ X' were sold to Arabs and by Arabs to Somalis, and eien ‘ Ual '^ &gt; ,°“ nf ^ as n J out of Jibouti or Tajourah Bay in small consignments which, as of ten as not were conveyed by Dunk ilt on Somali fishing or pearl-diving boats. He that if they could only be got to co-operate in the direction of only recognising certain prescribed, ports, that might he useful.16. He agreed in effect that it was desirable for Great Britain, Italy, France, and Turkey to co-operate in the matter of checking illicit traffic in arms in Somaliland. 17. Reverting to the case of Nakhuda Mahmood, he said that he had explained that he had been unable to make the port of Hais owing to stress of weather. In regard to the goods which he had landed at Maith, he said that the merchants concerned had assured him that they would pay the necessary dues on them at Hais. I pointed out that this was rather an improbable story. Aden : The 19th December 1905. F. de B. HANCOCK, Captain, Acting First Assistant Resident, Aden. Rotes regarding preventive steamers and dhows required to check the illicit traffic in arms taking place between the Somali Coast and South- Western Arabia. Burins: the Political Resident’s recent visit to Berbera and Jibouti, 2nd to 8th instant, I had an opportunity of discussing this subject with General Swayne and Captain Coideaux, and of seeing certain of the Somaliland Protec torate records on the subject, which Captain Cordeaux kindly showed me at Berbera. 2. As to dhows, I gathered that the initial cost of purchasing, fitting out, arming, and thoroughly equipping a good dhow was about £500, or even a little more. I gathered that the best way to set about the matter was to purchase a good dhow of suitable type at Hodeida, where alone they were made. This then should be fitted up and especially strengthened with a view to carrying the requisite armament of a 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun, and accom modating commander and crew, etc. 3. The actual dhow could, I gathered, be purchased for about Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 2,000, and could be strengthened and fitted out for about another Rs. 500. Over and above this, however, there are various items to be taken into account which bring the total initial cost up to about the figure named. There are such items as the following:— (i) 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun and ammunition, etc. (ii) Special water-tanks. (iii) Good telescope and compass. (iv) Medicine chest and first-aid appliances. (v) Cooking stoves, etc. (vi) Flags and awnings. (vii) Admiralty charts. (viii) Log Books. (ix) Uniforms for commander and crew. (x) Arms for police. (xi) Filter. (xii) Furniture. (xiii) Special steering gear. (xix) Special fittings to provide suitable shelter and accommodation to European Commander, etc. Various other minor requirements doubtless exist or come to notice in the course of actual service. . ... ^ A nyh°w, I gathered that, though Captain Cordeaux estimated the initial cost of an armed dhow at only about £200 in August 1902, subsequent experience has proved that, including armament and all other items, £500 mav be taken as a mme probable figure. -mm- lillnii w ji' mm -&amp;*'**.27 5. As to the cost of upkeep, the attached copy of last year’s Somali land Protectorate estimates furnishes information. Petty supplies and repairs may be taken at about Us. 900 to Ps. 1,000. The rations and victuals of two European employes (El a day for Europeans) and twelve natives may be estimated at about Rs. 2,500 a year. As to establishment, the following is maintained in Somaliland:— R a. V 1 Master . • 4 150 0 0 1 Mate . . . • . 80 0 0 1 Interpreter . • 50 0 0 1 Serang . . . • • 20 0 0 4 Khalasies at SIS • • . 52 0 0 1 Boy • • 7 0 0 1 Sergeant, Police • • . 22 0 0 4 Policemen at R16 • • . 64 0 0 415 0 0 per mensem—Es. 5,340 per annum. With a view to having a master of superior standing in the Royal Indian Marine, which I am inclined to consider a matter of very great importance, I would add another E200 per mensem on this account, i.e , another Es. 2.400 p^r annum. 1 should be inclined to estimate Es. 8,0&lt;)0 per annum on account of establishment: and that brings the total cost of upkeep per dhow to about El,500, which is a more liberal estimate than that made by Somaliland. 6. As to the cost of a steamer, this of course entirely depends upon the tvpe of vessel required. A good stout steam tug with the plainest possible fittings could be probablv had from £6.000 to £7,000. The tug Dolphin, owned by the Aden Port Trust, cost £5,5.50. The tug Hornet, frequently used by the Perim Coal Company to convey the mails between Aden and Perim, cost about £2,750. But both these are small for work in the open sea and not really safe in rough weather. And they have not sufficient accom modation for either men or baggage to be really useful, 7. The Commissioner of Somaliland has had a fairly long correspondence upon the subject of a suitable steamer, and the attached copy of a letter from the Naval Architect and Inspecting Engineer, Mr. E. J. Reed, dated 14th March 1905, is instructive on the subject. It may be taken for granted that a 12-knot speed and a fairly shallow draft are essential requirements. Aden being already provided with a vessel of the Eoyal Indian Marine, the Eevenue Steamers need not contain the same accommodation for men and cargo as is apparently necessary for Somaliland. They should be large enough to accommodate about 50 tons of cargo. Sepoys and camp enquipage would be occasionally conveyed. There should be accommodation for two or three European passengers. 8. It has been suggested that mails should be conveyed. Against this it may be urged that the present service is fairly regular and that the employ ment of either steamer or dhow on this service would, to some extent, cause an interruption to their other duties and also impair the general efficiency of the protective service, in that the opportunity afforded by any regular absence on mail service would not improbably be taken to commit offences. 9. On the other hand, the trip between Aden and Perim does dot take Ion 01 . The distance is only 98 miles which, at 12 knots an hour, makes the journey one of about 8 hours only. 10. Upon the whole a sum of about £10,000 may, perhaps, be estimated as the cost of a suitable steamer for the preventive service. But in the light of Captain Cordeaux’s experience in the matter of the dhows, and taking it that the steamer should be armed with one or more 3-pounder and perhaps a maxim ^un as well, it would seem safer to add another thousand pounds or two to the estimate, which one might therefore put at £12,000.-- . - . 28 u As to cost o£ upkeep, I think the Somaliland estimates may he taken. (a) Crew.— 1 Master . 1 Mate . • 2 Engineers— £100 20 Crew . . 1 Watchman Total 2,250 1.500 3,000 7.500 240 14,490 Here a-ain, however, I should he inclined to add another E2.400 on account of a superior class of a master of the Eoyal Indian Marine. 12. The figures— R Coal and Stores Contingencies Total 26,250 1,500 27,750 may I think, he taken as they stand, bringing the total cost of upkeep to about Rs. 44,640, say Rs. 45,000. . . 13 I attach for ready reference a list showing the cost of certain items purchased by Captain Cordeaux for the armed dhows belonging to the Somaliland Protectorate. „ i o 14,. I also attach, as likely to be of future s^vice, a copy of the Stand ing Orders accompanying Captain Cordeaux s lettor No. 28, dated 16tli Mlrch 1903, from which it is to be noted that Eu e VII was afte ds omitted by order of Lord Lansdowne m bis No. 114,t dated 24th April 1903. 15 And lastly, I attach copy of certain correspondence accompanying Poreign Office No. 196, dated 9th July 1903, which is also likely to he of interest hereafter. 16. To summarize, the initial cost of a suitable dhow may be taken at £500 (Rs. 7,500) and the cost of upkeep at Rs 11,500. The initial cost of a suitable steamer maybe taken at £12,000 (Rs. 1,80,000) and the cost of upkeep at Rs. 45,000. 17. Por the present I am inclined to think that one steamer and one dhow at Perim and two dbows at Aden should suffice to answer requirements. I have not estimated for cost of possibly fitting dhows with patrol motors. And this could best be ascertained in England. P. de B. HANCOCK, Capt., Acting First Assistant Resident, Aden, Rated 10th January 1905. Broadway Chambers, Westminster, S. W., 14th March 1905. W. Somali 87. Gentlemen, Having carefully examined the letters and enclosures relating to a pro posed steamer for the Somaliland Protectorate which accompanied yourcommunication of 16th February on the subject, I beg leave to report as follows:— 2. The requirements necessary for the steamer as enumerated by General Swayne require a larger vessel than has apparently been contemplated, and it is to be observed that neither of the three steamers of which the particulars are enclosed with the correspondence would offer anything approaching the combi nation of qualities required, even if the age of the two larger ones did not preclude them from favourable consideration. A similar remark would apply to a converted North Sea fishing steamer which would not have the required cargo-carrying power and speed, and would be capable of affording but limited accommodation. 3. The size and style of the steamer referred to in Messrs. Cochrane and Sons’ let r er to Messrs. C. W. Kellock and Company would be alto gether inadequate for the purpose in view. She would not be well con structed, would carry little cargo, and would have a low speed. I can readily believe that even under these circumstances the price quoted for this vessel allows a very small margin of profit, although the cost of construction is cut down to the lowest possible limit; and I am afraid that this price, in the absence of particulars as to her cargo-carrying power^ and speed, has proved misleading when the probable cost of a vessel combining the desired requirements has been under consideration. Few persons who are not closely acquainted with such investigations understand how greatly the cost is in creased by requiring so large a proportionate weight of cargo to be carried in combination with such a speed as 12 knots when loaded. From this point of view offers for boats carrying little cargo, or none at all, are most misleading. 4. I have prepared and enclose herewith an outline sketch of a steamer, in which I have combined the requirements mentioned by General Swayne as far as can be done in a vessel of moderate size and cost; but I have found it necessary, even in this boat, to reduce the deadw eight of cargo to be carried and to adopt a lower speed, and even with these reductions the steamers will cost considerably more than the sum of £9,000 mentioned. 5 This proposed vessel has a length of 160 feet and 11 feet moulded depth On the draught of 8 feet she will be capable of carrying a total deadweight of coal and cargo of about 230 tons. She will have speed of 11 knots per hour when loaded to 8 feet draught. ^ I have found necessary to adopt twin screw machinery in order to obtain a sufficient immersion of the propellers, because a single screw would require to be of excessive dia meter in proportion to the limited draught. The bunkers provided have a capacity for about 100 tons of coal, which quantity 1 calculate will be amp.e for 2,000 miles steaming. The total carrying power of the vessel on a draught of 8 feet being 230 tons, the w eight of cargo which can he carried wmen the hunkers are full is therefore only 130 tons. It is to be observed, however, that a greater weight of cargo could be carried without increasing the draught at any time when circumstances do not require the bunkers to be full, &amp; because the holds are of ample size, the forward hold having a capacity for about 147 tons of cargo, reckoned at 50 cubic feet to the ton, and the after one for about 89 tons, or a total of 236 tons. I may also remark that if at any time it should not be necessary to strictly limit the draught of the vessel to 8 feet, a larger total deadweight than 230 tons coal and cargo together could be carried, the free-board as designed being quite sufficient to allow of her being safely immersed 6 inches or even 9 inches more, each inch increasing the weight-carrying power by about 7 ¥ tons. 6. I have been obliged to limit the speed of the vessel to 11 knots, because the adoption of the 12 knots speed mentioned by General Sway re would have carried the design still further away from the size and cost of the vessel which be seems to consider would suffice to embody his requirements. To obtain a sueed of 12 knots per hour with the same total deadweight of 2o0 tons on a draught of 8 feet, it would be necessary to increase the length ot the vessel i have proposed by m arly 10 feet and her breadth by 1 foot, and to increase therower and weight of the machinery by about 30 per cent. The coal consump- tion also would necessarily be somewhat increased and the cargo-carrying power correspondingly reduced. . . 7* I have arranged for the accommodation of the Commissioner and his staff hv the provision of a teak deck-house on the after part of the upper deck. This house will contain a large saloon, with a pantry adjacent a sleeping cabin, bath-room and W. C. for the Commissioner, three double berth cabins, a bath room and aW. C. for the staff and a steward’s store-room. The whole of the after part of the upper deck will be sheltered by an awning, with side scieens fitted down to the height of the bulwarks. 8 The accommodation for the ship’s officers comprises a captain’s cabin on the bridge deck, adjoining a chart and wheel house, and side cabins lor the other officers beneath the bridge deck. The crew will be berihed under a raised forecastle. 9 No indication is given as to any special accommodation being desired for the deck passengers, and I have assumed that deck space, with the necessary latrine arrangements, is all that will be required. To give shelter to these passengers, I have arranged for the forecastle deck to he continued as far as the bridge, the space on top of this deck being also available for the accommo dation of passengers. The space on the upper deck forward will he protected at the sides by canvas screens, and awnings will he fitted over the bridge and shelter decks. The number of deck passengers which can he carried at any given lime will naturally depend to seme extent on the length of the voyage and other conditions prevailing at the time. 10. The vessel will he fitted with two steam winches for working the cargo by means of derricks placed on the masts. She will be provided with steam steering gear, and a steam windlass will be fitted forward for working the anchors, wffiich will he nf the stockless type, stowing in the hawse-pipes. I have assumed that a vessel of this size and character would naturally he pro vided with a complete electric light installation, including deck reflectors for working cargo at night, and I have included this in the design. 11. The arrangements for mounting the Hotchkiss gun referred to in General Swayne’s despatch, the provision of racks for the rifles which it is intended to carry, and the fitting of magazines for the ammunition are details which may he left for future consideration as to the manner in which they shall be carried out. 12. The machinery I propose for this vessel consists of twin screw triple expansion engines, of the type usually fitted in merchant steamers, this type being well adapted for working well for long periods, while it is also moderate in cost. Steam would be supplied by two single-ended cylindrical return tube boilers, the working pressure being about 160 lbs. The necessary feed and donkey pumps would be fitted and the usual engine-room outfit and a moder ate amount of spare gear would be provided. 13. The hull of the vessel would be constructed generally in accordance with Lloyds rules, and the wood decks would be of teak, this being by far the most suitable wood for a hot climate although its employment involves consi derable increase of cost. The fittings generally would be of as good quality as could he obtained without incurring unnecessary expense. 11 11. Notwithstanding the fact already stated, that the vessel would fall short of the qualifications enumerated both in speed and cargo-carrying capacity, and possibly also in the number of deck passengers which could be accommodated, the cost of such a vessel as described above, cannot I am afraid, he estimated at much less than £14,000, exclusive of the cost of navi gation to the Protectorate. It would of course be possible to somewhat reduce this cost by the omission of the eletrio light installation, the substitution of pitch pine for the teak decks, the fitting of hand steering gear and a hand windlass instead of steam, and generally by fitting the vessel in a cheap manner, such as is frequently adopted in small cargo steamers of the mer cantile marine. The cost of the vessel might be reduced by about £1,200 or £1,500 by these means, hut I am convinced that a vessel so fitted would notbe desirable f&lt;&gt;r the intended service, nor prove satisfactory to the authorities. In no case could the cost of such a vessel be brought down to anything approaching the sum of £9,000 allotted for her construction. 15. As it is possible that the expenditure on the proposed vessel is strictly limited to this sum of £9,000, I have further considered what kind of vessel might be obtained for that amount. I find that the dimensions of the largest vessel which could reasonably be expected would be about 115 feet x 20 feet, with a moulded depth of 10 feet. This vessel would have single screw com pound engines, driving her at a speed of 10 knots per hour. Her v eight carrying capacity on a draught of 8 feet would be about 120 tons, ot which 60 tons would be required for the quantity of^ coal necessary to steam 2,000 miles leaving 60 tons for cargo. The relative proportions of coal and cargo might, however, he somewhat varied as in the case of the larger steamer, and about 25 tons more total dead weight might safely be carried when there is no necessitv to limit the draught to 8 feet. The cargo would be stowed m two holds, each with a steam winch for loading and discharging by means o± derricks. 16. The accommodation for the Commissioner and his staff would neces sarily be less extensive than in the larger vessel. It would be contained under a poop deck and would comprhe a moderate sized saloon, a sleeping the Commissioner, two double-berth state rooms, a bath room, W. O. and a pantry, which is all that could be provided in the space available. ihe officers would be berthed in cabins under the bridge decks, and the crew in a raised forecastle. The space available for deck passengers would he small, and only about 40 to 50 of these could be carried. The amount of money allowed would not permit of electric light being fitted, and m order to k eep the cost within the specified limit it might possibly be necessary to fit hand steering gear and a hand windlass instead of steam. 17. It will be seen that this smaller vessel is very far indeed from com plying with the requirements enumerated by General Swayne m speed, LSo can-h.g capacity and pa^nger accommodation. On the other hand the larger vessel I have described, 'hi'-h much more neariy « ® requirements, would be more costly than has been ant.ctpated, and under ^ circumstances I beg leave to wait for further instructions before undertaking the work of preparing a detailed specification. 18. I return herewith General Swayne’s despatch with its enclosures as requested. ^ EEEI)} Naval Architect and Inspecting Engineer, SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE REVENUE CUTTERS. STANDING ORDERS. I.—Object. The obiect of the revenue Cutters is to enforce the Protectorate Gust mw Regulations! and also to prevent fire-Arms and ammunition irom being imported at any place on the coast of the Protectorate. II.—Customs Regulations. The Regulations, require that all dhows trading with British Somali Ports must first call at one of the Protectorate Customs Stations, namely, Zai a, Zmar Beihera Koram or Hals, and must obtain therefrom written permits to proceed to their destination. XXi.—A ll dhows sighted to be boarded. Every dhow sighted is to he boarded and searched. If more than one dhow is sighted, the one nearest to the land should be boarded first if possible;but the respective positions of the dhows with regard to the direction of the wind, should be considered. It might be advisable to board dhows to windward before those to leeward, in order to avoid a prolonged chase. IV.—Pbocedtjee when boakding. On a dhow being sighted, the a^med portion of the crew should he kept down out of sight, until within hailing distance. When nearer enough, the ensign is to be hoisted, and the officer and men show themselves with rifles in hand, the Interpreter hailing the dhow to heave to. If this should have no effect, a blank charge from the 3-pounder is to be fired, followed if necessary by a shot accross the bows. If these measures are insufficient to st )p the dhow fire should be opened with a view to bringing down her mast or sail. Bloodshed should be avoided as far as possible. On the dhow being brought to the Mate and Interpreter should board her in a boat manned by two of the protectorate crew, the captain and remain der of the crew covering them with gun and rifles. Y. Examination oe papies. The papers of each dhow boarded are to be carefully examined and com pared with the position of the dhow at the time. In the case of any discrepancy or irregularity, or if the permit mentioned in Rule II cannot be shown, the papers are to be retained and handed over to the Chief Customs Officer on return to Berbera, together with a report of the circumstances. VI.— Search. Every dhow must be carefully and thoroughly searched. Gun-runnino&gt; dhows conceal arms under the cargo and between false sides or bottoms ; arms in water-tight cases are also slung by ropes over the ship’s side or under the keel, ready to he slipped instantly in case of danger. When possible thev are dropped in shallow water, to be recovered afterwards. All these tricks should be looked out for. VII Erench dhows. Dhows with French colours found within three miles of the British Protectorate shore, are to be called upon to show their papers, and if these are correct, allowed to proceed without being searched. If their papers are incorrect, they are to be mdered to leave the coast, and informed of the Regulations referred to in Rule II. No dhow under French colours is to be searched unless there is the strongest reason to believe she is carrying arms If she is found to be so doing, sl.e is to be dealt with as other dhows so cap tured, that is to say, conveyed to the nearest port where there are civil autho rities, to whom they are to he turned over. VIII.— Firing to be avoided. The firing of the three-pounder guns should not he resorted to unless absolutely necessary, as the sound would put other dhows in the neighbour hood on their guard. It must be borne in mind that the intention is to take dhows by surprise, and with this object every care must be taken to render the Protectorate dhows as little conspicuous as possible. Colours should only be hoisted wh&lt; n within hailing distance of the dhow to be hoarded. ^ JL'UTIJE.B u* ^ArTAiNS AND MATES. ... P ie Captain will be responsible for his ship and her armament: the Male wnl have charge of provisions, water and miscellaneous stores. Thev will ke p a list of stores for which they are severally responsible, and show the daily expenditure therein. ^33 All indents for stores will be submitted monthly, as required, through Chief of Customs, Berbera, who will inspect the ship’s books at the termination of each cruise and see that they are correct and written up to date. Rations for the Native crews will be issued daily under the superinten dence of the Interpreters. The Captain will also keep a daily Log and Boarding Book, in which will be entered the required details of all dhows boarded, and will forward it to the Consul-General, through the Chief of Customs, immediately on return, from a cruise. X.—Precautions to be observed. All arms and ammunition should be kept securely under lock and key, but should be stowed in such a manner as to be in instant readiness when required. A watch is always to be kept and precautions are to be taken against surprise by hostile natives. No attempt should be made to obtain water in Italian territory, or at places where the natives show signs of unfriendliness, and the watering party should be under cover of the ship or an armed party , Hostilities are always to be avoided if possible, and friendly relations maintained with the coast tribes. XI.— Health op the crew. The health of the crew is to be cared for by all means possible, and special precautions should be taken as regards drinking-water. All drinking-water should be first boiled, and then filtered. Each dhow is supplied with a filter for this purpose. A medicine chest containing simple remedies is also supplied and should be re-stocked at the end of each cruise. In case of serious illness, the officer m . command should make for the nearest port where medical assistance can be obtained (Berbera). XII—Programme op cruising. The following programme should be adhered to as far as wind and weather permit:— No 1 Cutter leaves Berbera on, say, March 15th, and proceeds to Hais, calling at Karam if necessary on the way, thence along the coast as far as Bunder Elayia if time permits ; otherwise as far as she can, returning to Hais by April 10th, to await there the arrival of No. 2 Cutter. No. 2. No. 1 Cutter leaves Berbera on April 1st and meets No. 1 at Hais on the 10th April, thence proceeding eastwards, after arranging to return to Hais in 20 days, i.e., on April 30th. leaves Hais on April 10th, and returns to Berbera to report arriving there on April 15th. After re-fitting and laying in fresh supply of victuals, she sails again for Bais on April 20th and meets No. 2 there about April 30th. She then proceeds east wards and returns to Hais on May 30th and after meeting No. 2 there proceeds to Berbera, and so on ; and in this way regular continuous communication will be kept up between Berbera and the Coast Ports.

Sir, In continuation of Admiralty letters M. 7975 of the 10th instant and M. 5285 of the 25th March last, and with reference to previous correspondence on the subject of armed dhows for the suppression of the traffic in arms on the Somali Coast, I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit herewith, for the information of the Marquess of Lansdowne copy of a letter, dated the 26rh instant, from the Sen ; or Naval Officer at Aden* enclosing copy of correspondence with His Majesty’s Acting Commissioner for the Somali Protectorate relative to the engagement of Europeans as part of the crews of the dhows. With reference to Admiralty letter M. 5285 of 24th April 1903 and Foreign Office letter of l^th April 1903, accompanying the same, relating to the conditions of engagement of European crews for the two Somaliland Protectorate dhows, I have the honour to report that in compliance with their Lordship’s directions I wrote to Captain Cordeaux, His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General at Berbera. J 3 . ^ enclose a copy of my letter herewith, which practically embodies my views on the questions raised, and Captain Cordeaux's reply.

EARQUHAR, Captain fy Senior Naval Officer, Aden.35 - Dated 13th May 1903, From—C aptain F. B. Farqtjhar, Senior Naval Offic r, Aden, To— Captain H. E. Cordeaux, Acting Consul-General, Berbera. I have the honouir to inform you that I have received from the Admiralty a copy of a communication from the Foreign Office, da'ed 1st April, requesting information as to the conditions on which crews could he engaged for the two dhows to be employed in the suppression of the tiaffic in arms on the Somali Coast. Their Lordships instructed me to furnish the local officers who are engaged on the duty of finding crews for these vessels with such information on tbe point raised as I may be able to obtain. Also to forward to the Admiralty a report for transmission to the Secretary of state. As I understand you are the principal local officer referred to, I should be glad to know in what manner I can best assist and advise in the master. The points raised by the Crown Agents for the Colonies appear to be :— First .—On what condition the engagement of two European officers for each dbow (in lieu of the petty officers at present serving in them ) should be based. Second. —Whether it would be necessary to give free quarters on shore to tbe men to be engaged. Third. — 'W hether hoard and outfit allowances should be given. Fourth {and AVhether it would be advisable that they should be provided with uniform. , As regards the latter point, I understand that the successful operations of the dhows depend largely on their power of approaching native craft without arousing suspicion. “ From this point of view r the wearing of the distinctive uniform would probably be inadvaisable.” An extract from Somaliland Kesrulation No. 1696 Appts. is appended to the papers, dated 7th April 1903, raising the same points. As a preliminary, I sent for Lieutenant-Commander Kirwin, Commanding Torpedo Boat No. 10 1, and obtained from him a description of the dhow vyhich he commanded for about three months last antnmn, and generally of the life of an officer on board a dhow together with suggestions as to how far the rough mode of living, etc., on that service might be ameliorated. The conclusions which I drew from his report (verbal) are briefly as follows :— 1. The ordinary trading dhow is built without much regard to the comfort and accommodation of the Captain or crew, and considerable, though not neces sarily expensive, alterations must be undertaken in converting such a vessel, mainly adapted as it, is for carrying cargo, into a fighting craft. 2. If it is considered impracticable to have dhows specially built for this service, the alterations required would be somewhat as follows :— {a) The rudder to he worked by a hand wheel fitted near the break of the poop, which would thus be left clear for the accommodations of the officers. (6) A small folding table and folding chairs (very inexpensive) supplied ; also bed boards, i.e., pieces of plank to ship and unship on the deck to form the sides of the beds or bunks at night, mitigate the discomfort attendant on heavy rolling at anchor, etc. (c) The after part of the main hold or “well” to be boarded over and fitted with lockers for the European crews (if any). (d) Iron water tanks and suitable store-rooms, magazines, arm-racks, etc., to he fitted. (e) Good rain and sun awnings to he supplied. 3. There appears to me to be no reason why European officers should not he able to live on board, provided that reasonable arrangements can be madeI ! 36 for their comfort; bat if the dhow should be hauled up or “ hove down ” for repairs, refit, repainting, etc., they should be permitted to live on shore, receiv ing suitable subsistence allowance. 4. Each dhow should have a serviceable boat, about 12 to 15 feet long, for boarding and landing purposes, and capable of laying out a spare anchor, 5. The officers should, in my opinion, certainly possess uniform, and should wear it on such occasions as require it. e.g., when boarded by a man-of-war, British or Foreign, interviewing the head man of a tribe, visiting officials or landing on a tribal port, etc. 6. If there are Europeans included in the crew, they also should have uniform. The native crew do not require uniforms. 7. As to the composition of the crew, I should think from your knowledge of the native races in this part of the world you would know what is best to be done, but I understand that Somalis are not altogether satisfactory. 8. To conclude : as this is the beginning of what may be regarded as a Coast Guard service, it is desirable to get started in a good groove, so to speak, and when Somaliland is once more peacefully settled, the revenues from this source ought to be handsome. The scale on which the present Egyptian Coast Guard was started was, I imagine, quite a small one. It is now, as perhaps you are aware, one of the most efficient and well-organished services to be found anywhere and the personnel are native, with a proportion of European officers (British subjects). 9. I shall await your reply before sending in the report required by the Admiralty. In the meantime please confer with Commander Cartwright and any other Naval Officers at Berbera, who will, I am sure, assist you in every way they can. Dated the 8th May 1903. From— Captain H. E. S. Cordeaux, His Majesty's Acting Commissioner and Consul-General, Berbera, To—The Senior Naval Officer, Aden Division, Aden. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of May 6th on the subject of engagement of crews for the two Protectorate armed dhows. Inquiries on the same subject have already been addressed to me by His Majesty’s Secretary of State, and I enclose a copy of my reply for your information. I should, however, be glad to learn your views on the special points on which information is asked for, and you will doubtless communicate direct with the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on the subject. I have also to thank you for your useful suggestions on the fitting out of dhows. The majority of these have already been anticipated, and the two dhows have recently returned from a cruise and are sailing in a few days for a second patrol of the coast line as far as Bandar Elayia. Experience will doubtless bring to light many points in which alterations and additions can be made to advantage, and in carrying these out your suggestions will be a valuable guide.

After compliments.—'W q inform your honour that we ashed our brother Abdul Majid about the ammunition, and he told us that 900 rounds of ammuni- tion were found, but they belonged to the Julaidi who placed them as “ amana ” (safe custody) with Sayad Zain bin Alawi of Al Wahat. The ammunition is now in the charge of our brother Abdul Majid. Now we have received a letter fiom the sons of All Motbil, the Humaidi, in which they inform us that the Julaidis have interrupted the route and killed one camel on account of their ammunition which was seized. Now, Oh friend, is there any punishment for these Subaihis otherwise do not let us become the enemies of the tribes. We became much distressed on account of their present act. We send you the letter which we have received from the sons of Ali Mok- bil, the Humaidi, as you may peruse it. We do not know of its correctness. May you be preserved. Letter from the sons of Ali Mohbil Al Humaidi to the Abdali Sultan. We inform you that it is true that the Julaidis have intercepted some oamelmen at a place above Tafih and fired at them wounding one camel belong ing to Al Akhum. We asked the people about the cause, and they said that they did this as a defiance to the Sultan on account of the ammunition which he had taken from them. This being unjust we are therefore reporting it to you. Injustice displeases. You are wise enough. The incident took place on the slopes of Tafih. They were intercepted by the camelmen who frequent Madin. We have already sent a letter to the Resident of Aden reporting this matter, but it was not reported by any other person.

They have killed one camel and injured another. God knows whether it will live or die. The have encountered the camelmen and interrupted them above Tafih, in Wadi Ma’adin where the two rivers meet. We send you this for information with a request that you will rise in the cause of the safety of the routes, and do justice to the poor who cannot travel except under your protection. We give this information of the disorder of the road. The camels which were injured passed by the road of Al Parsha, and they belonged to the subject of the Sublime Government, and the offenders are your subjects and under your control.

After compliments .—In reference, Ob friend, to your letter dated 17th Jomad Akhar, we have written to the Sheikh Imad Ahmed of the Julaidi to come into Aden at once and see us about the ammunition, and concerning the disorder which his tribesmen are alleged to have committed near Al Tafeh. 2 2 ‘ i We i? r f inde ^ d SUrprised and ^ rieved that a manlike Sayad Zain bin Alawi s muld lend himself to such action as receiving ammunition as “amana” from the Jukudi, and not telling you of it at once. He must of course know that the import of such things is forbidden by us. We trust that you will take due notice of his conduct.We trust also that you will continue to keep a careful watch for irregular ities of this nature, and take early action yourself, and also give us early infor mation or your action in such matters. q 011 friend &gt; | el1 us more details of the circumstances under which bayaa Zain accepted this ammunition as “ amana. ,, Please send word to the Humaidi and the Julaidi that they must not fi^ht and interrupt the routes. 3 v n0t /’ ° h fri ® nd ’ t,iat y° u have no on e posted at Kas-al-Ara to see to the matt er of ar g It would be well perhaps to consider the advisability of estab- 1 ^ing one there.

Jfter compliments .—We inform your honour that we had sent for Sheikh Imad bin Ahmed ba Saleh, the Julaidi, and he came to us. We informed him about the imformation we had received from the sons of Ali Mokbilal Humaidi, to the effect that the Julaidis have committed aggression on the route and killed a camel, and asked him for an explanation. He denied the committal of the deed by any of the Julaidis. The Julaidis, however, are intending to do some mischief if they will not get back their 900 rounds of ammunition, which our soldiers had captured at A1 Wahat. After we became fully aware of the good behaviour and intention of not giving trouble to the people, we gave him 900 rounds of ammunition. May you know of this. May you be preserved.

After compliments .—We have received your letter dated 28th Jomad Akhar, informing us that the Julaidi Sheikh has denied that his tribesmen have committed any aggtessions on the route. We note that you were, therefore satisfied of his good conduct, and, therefore, gave him the 900 rounds of ammu nition which you had captured. We have already asked you to inform us of the circumstances under which this ammunition was captured by Sayad Zain bin Alawi as “amana,” and we await a reply to that question. Meanwhile we do not quite understand your having restored this ammuni tion to the Julaidi. You of course are well aware of the fact that we desire to check the import of ammunition into this country, and more particularly into the country of the Subaibis. May you he preserved. : Dated 5th Rajah 1323 (4th September 1905). From— Sultan Sir Ahmed Fadthl, The Abdali, 1 To— Colonel Scallon, Political Resident, Aden. After compliments .—We have received your letter No. 5346, dated 2nd September 1905, and in reply we realise, Oh friend, that you will deal with us in a strict manner with regard to the existence of fire-arms which you intend to totally prevent, but we do not find that you treat other Chiefs in such a s rict44. form, while, on the other hand, for our love and good friendship towards you and in accordance with a promise we had given your predecessors, we are doing all what we can possibly do in that respect, otherwise we are not bound by any undertaking for the same. You know that the coast extends from Maidi to beyond Balahaf, and in many of the ports the fire-arms and ammunition are imported in all directions, how could it be possible, therefore, for us to thoroughly extirpate them, and our tribesmen numbering over 3,000 men are bound by necessity to be armed by the same guns, and in the same way such arms are adopted in all directions in our vicinity and others. For many times we suffered considerable losses and trouble in fighting the Subaihis, and requested you to aid us; we observed that you had not paid the least attention to our loss. As to the coast which is in our possession, we have, as you know, men to look after it. In regard to Sayad Zain bin Alawi under reference he is a poor man, and the state of poverty is not hidden to your honour. If he gets four annas to support his children with it is likely that he might harbour a murderer with him, leave alone the keeping of a case of cartridges in his charge. More over, he was not aware whether the ammunition in question were imported on the coast and directly brought to him, or they were out of the existing ammuni tion in which the people deal amongst themselves, and he sees that all persons are equipped with arms and ammunition. The attack which was made on him and his confinement was sufficient punishment considering his poverty and ignorance. May you be preserved. Dated 7th Rajah 1333 (6th September 1905). From— Sultan Sir Ahmad Fadthl, The Abdali, To— Colonel Scallon, Political Resident, Aden. After compliments. —We have received your letter No. 5405, dated 5th September 1905. As regards the Sayad, we have already given you the neces sary explanation in our letter dated 5th Rajah 1323. As to our giving back to the Julaidi the 900 rounds of ammunition, we have done so in order to pacify his tribes from committing any misdeed and mischief to the travellers. As regards your remark, Oh friend, that we are perfectly aware of your wishes to prevent the importation of ammunition in our country, and more particularly in the Subaihi country. We are much delighted to hear of the prevention of the ammunition in the Subaihi country, but as regards such strict prevention in our country, our tribesmen are in need of the ammunition, there fore first of all make some arrangement for our tribesmen as we have stated in our letter dated 10th Sh’ban 1323 (19th October 1904), as well as our letter dated 1st A1 Hijja 1320 (28th February 1903) to the address of His Excellency the Governor of Bombay. Secondly, we cannot thoroughly and entirely put a stop to it unless its exportation is strictly prohibited at Jibouti. May this be known to you. May you be preserved.

And at Amriga the recent maiming of a traveller s camel has yet to be settled. Extract from the weekly letters of the Resident at Aden, dated, respectively, the 15th and 29th September; 27th October ; 10th and 17th November, and 15th December 1906. 15th September .—My interview with the Abdali last Saturday was not a very Ion 0, one, as, unfortunately, the Sultan was not very well that day and complained of headache and of attacks of nosebleeding. I hope that it may be only a passing indisposition due to the heat. Our discussion was mainly confined to the arms traffic question, and on this the Sultan expressed decided views that no measures would be of any avail which did not include more stringent preventive measures on the Subaihi coast. He expressed himself willing to undertake these with the assistance of Government, but pleaded that without such assistance the matter was beyond his powers or means. He dwelt upon the danger of supplying petty Subaihi Chiefs with Martini-Henry arms which were far superior to the Gras rifle, but approved of the idea of Martini-Henry arms being supplied to himself and his friends cheaply. It is no doubt true that unless we are fairly liberal with our supply of Martini-Henry arms, the illicit arms trade will continue in the absence of effective preventive measures. But I propose to use the recently accorded permission to supply Martini-Henry arms with great discrimination. A letter has been received this week from Sheikh Saeed ba Ali, the Attifi Chief of Turan, in which he admits that he is deriving considerable profit from illicit traffic in arms on his coast and adds that this is due to the stoppage of the Attifi stipend. I have no doubt that the stoppage of the stipend has nothing to do with the matter and that the Attifi and the others on the Subaihi coast will continue to reap profits from the arms traffic until effective measures are taken to check it. * * * * *29th September.-^-lLhe price of the Le Gras rifle is said to have recently risen and be now from $15 to $18. « * * * * 27th October .—Major Schneider reports from Perim that with the return of the North-East monsoon, the arms traffic between Jibouti and the Arabian Coast has been actively resumed. He reports that three dhows loaded with arms passed through the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb on the 14th instant bound for Khor Ghuleifaka south of Hodeidah, and that the masters of two of them were well-known arms-runners—Ahmed Kbuddaf and Ahmed Said. Erom another source I hear that most of these arms are landed in the vicinity of Modi, which is some distance north of Hodeidah. I have received a letter from the Abdali Sultan concerning the Turan section of the Attifi, which confirms the news given in paragraph 3 of my last week’s letter. The Abdali, however, has added a suggestion that the allowance of $40 referred to in the correspondence underlying Government Kesolution, Political Department, No. 5182, dated 10th July 1900, should be now given to this Sheikh, who would then take measures to check the illicit traffic in arms in that vicinity. This I doubt, but I have sent for the Sheikh, who bye-the-bye has not yet given any satisfaction for the murder on his coast of the Dunkali referred to in this office letter No. 5762, dated 24th September 1905. ***** 10th November .—The Assistant Resident, Perim, reports that large con signments of arms are just now leaving Jibouti for the Arabian Coast. He says that most of the dhows carrying them keep out of British waters. ***** 17th November .—A Native correspondent says that ammunition is now being sold at a village called Dahabila at the rate of 8 rounds a rupee. And he also writes that there is much sickness amongst the Turkish troops posted at Taiz. * * * * 15th December .—I enclose the latest Somaliland Intelligence Report, in which it is interesting to note that the Mulla is said to be receiving supplies of arms and ammunition from Arabia. ***** Arms traffic .—Mulla is receiving supplies of arms and ammunition at lllig from Arabia. intract from the weekly letter of the Hesident at Aden, dated the 12th January 1907. 9. I gave Major Schneider a few days* leave at X’mas to go on a shooting expedition to An jar. He took the opportunity to pay flying ^ visits to Obokh and Jibuti, where he says that he was treated with a great civility. He cofirms previous reports of Obokh being used as a place of call by arms and slave runners, who there get such information as Mr. Grandjean can afford of the whereabouts of men-of-war, etc., likely to interfere with their trade. ***** 10. He says that the price of a good Gras rifle at Jibuti has now risen to 12 dollars. He also writes that some discontent has been caused by the recent imposition of a special tax of 10 per cent, ad valorem on goods transported by3 48 rail. The Port did not strike him as very prosperous. He heard that a scheme was under consideration for considerably extending the landing pier. * * « * » # * Diary marking, °f 1907. * * Extract* from a letter No. 1649, dated the 10th March 1907, from the Political Resident at Aden. * * * Meanwhile a constant illicit supply of arms and ammunition is undoubtedly still being imported at the various ports of this protectorate from Jibuti and other sources, and even our best and oldest ally, the Abdali Sultan, must be himself perforce a paity to a covert disregard of the stated wishes and policy of this Eesidency and of Government in the matter. * * * * * No. 2776, dated Bombay Castle, the 13tb April 1907.

With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department + p N 608 Memorandum f No. 292-E.B., dated the 29th January 1907, I am directed to forward herewith copy of a letter from the Political Resident, Aden, No. 2132, dated the 31st March 1907, and of its accompaniment, on the subject of the repression of illicit traffic in arms in the Red Sea. No. 2132, dated Aden Residency, the 31st March 1907. From— Major-General E. DjBrath, C.B., C.I.E., Political Resident, Aden, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I have the honour to report that upon receiving information that certain, Humaida and Mam’ai tribesmen were proceeding from Aden to Jibouti with the intention of purchasing arms and ammunition for import to Ras-al- Arah, I deputed a trustworthy employee of the Arabic Department of this office to proceed to Jibouti and unostentatiously to observe the methods which are at present adopted for the purchase and export of these articles. 2. In attaching a copy of the statement which he made upon his return, for the information of Government, I have the honour to state that I do not propose to depute him to make any actual purchase of arms, unless Govern ment are of opinion that such a step is desirable to prove the traffic does actually exist as stated. {Confidential.) . Omar Salah. Head peon, Guest House, states : ** The day after I arrived in Djiboutil, i.e., the 7th instant, I went to the shop of Kafrkauf, a Greek merchant and dealer in arms, etc. There I found the men I was looking for— No’man Manasar and Saleh Ahmed, Humaidis, Sef Hasan, Mam’ai, Say ad Salmin, Akrabi of Bir Ahmed, along with two men whom I did not know and a broker named Haider-bin- Haidara-al-Karashi. While I was present the Humaidis and Mam’ai bought53 boxes of Le Gras ammunition at $65 per box of 1,200 rounds. The Akrabi purchased three boxes. The Humaida and Mam’ai also bought a French rifle each. They shipped this ammunition, etc., in a buggalow belonging to a Zahari agreeing to pay Rs. 60 for its transport to Ras-al-Arah. The buggalow was to have sailed yesterday, but the wind was too strong. Tiie Humaida asked what I was doing there. I said I bad taken eight days’ leave and had come to buy a rifle. They did not suspect me at all. Arms and ammunition are sold openly and shipped in the same manner without any hindrance from the Government. The seller gives the buyer a chit which he shows to the Customs officials and the goods are allowed to pass, a fee of $1 per rifle or box of ammunition, being paid by the seller. I ascertained that buggalows carrying arms, etc., from Djibouti! invariably proceed first to Obock, and there take in a cargo of straw mats, firewood, etc., with which the ammunition, etc., is covered. The following are the three principal dealers in arms and ammunition :— (1) Keverkoff, f a Greek or Armenian, (2) Armonil, Greek, (3) Keralona, French. A further shop spoken of as “ The Company ” was temporarily closed. The following are the present selling prices at these three shops, all of which I visited :— Rifles .—“ Mauser ” $ 30 to 50 with 100 rounds of ammunition. M. Henry $ 25 to 40 with 100 rounds of ammunition. Le Gras $ 14^ with 100 rounds of ammunition. Ditto $ 9^ without rounds of ammunition. Ammunition .—Le Gras $ 65 to 70 per box, 1,200 cartridges. Mauser $ 8 to 10 per box. Of the Mauser rifles some have a 4-round magazine which others are without. The quantity of arms and ammunition in stock appears to be large and the trade considerable. The largest purchasers are the Hakmis and men of Maidi (above Hodieda). I should have no difficulty in buying 200 rifles in a month’s time : if I went back at once I might be suspected. I would send one of my relations which would not be suspected. Before me, Aden : The 11th March 1907. A. H. E. MOSSE, Captain, Assistant Resident. Extract from the weekly letter of the Resident at Aden, dated the 4th May 1907. ***** 3. A native correspondent writes this week that the Barhemi and Attifi are making a good thing out of the illicit arms traffic, for which he says they get as commission $1 per rifle and 10 per cent, of the ammunition landed from Jibuti. ***** f I have heard of this man before and think this is approximately the correct spelling.50 No. 5574, dated Bombay Castle, the 9tb August 1907 (Secret). From— H. O. Quin, Esq., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I am directed to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a letter No. 4502, dated the 20th July 1907, from the Political Resident, Aden, and of its enclosures, on the subject of the illicit traffic in arms. 2. I am to state that any remarks which this Government may have to offer on the subject will be submitted to the Government of India hereafter. No. 4502, dated Aden Residency, the 20th July 1907 (Secret). From— Colonel P. R. Legh, Acting Political Resident, Aden, To—The Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. With reference to correspondence ending wdth my letter No. 4312, dated the 13th instant, I have the honour to forward copy of another letter dated the 11th idem and of its accompaniment which has now been received from the Abdali Sultan on the subject of the illicit arms traffic. 2. Prom this it will be observed that a large consignment of 60,000 cart ridges has recently been landed at Ras al Ara, where under the arrangement referred to in Government Resolution No. 1818, dated the 22nd March 1899, the Abdali Sultan is supposed to keep a post for the purpose of preventing such imports; and that under present circumstances no check whatever is imposed upon this traffic either by the Abdali Sultan himself or the Attifi Chief Saeed ha Ali referred to in correspondence ending with this office letter No. 1803, dated the 17th March 1907. 3. In the absence of other arrangements for the requisite supply of arms and ammunition for his soldiery, there is little doubt that the Abdali Sultan has for some time past connived at, if not actively participated in this traffic. And the Attifi Chief is evidently still inclined to prefer the immediate profits of a tax in kind to the prospects of an enhancement of stipend. 4. The Abdali Sultan’s present attitude is to entirely evade his own res ponsibilities on the littoral, and to decline to interfere further with the traffic in his owm territories in the absence of a better understanding with us on the subject. And the nature of the Attifi Chief Saeed ha Ali is such that no enhancement of stipend is likely to secure his real co-operation, in the absence of measures to very strictly supervise it. 5. Under the circumstances, I can only recommend that, if Government now desire the illicit traffic to be effectually checked, the earliest possible measures should be taken to establish the posts and patrols which are really requisite for the purpose. Dated 30tli Jumad Awal 1325 (llth July 1907). From— The Abdali Sultan, To— Colonel P, R, Leget, Acting Political Resident, Aden. After compliments ,—We inform you, oh friend, that we have heard that 60,000 rounds of ammunition were landed by two buggalows in the Attifi limits, where the Attifis have levied a tax in kind of about 3,600 rounds of ammunition. We are much astonished to see that the people obtain whatever ammunition they require for their rifles, while w'e are deprived of these advan tages owing to the strict prohibition imposed by us against such import into our territories : we expect what you will fix for us as sufficient monthly supply of D ammunition for ourselves and tribesmen in accordance with the verbal promise given to us by the Political Resident. We believed that the sea-ports adjoining riden were being guarded by you from the sea-side, but we see the contrary. We further inform you that these 60,000 rounds of ammunition will not be disposed of in the Subehi territories only, but will be disseminated all over ourterritories, in which case we will be unable to keep a watch over the same, and we are not going to cause enmity between us and our tribesmen and others without coming to some definite understanding with you in this connection. May it be known to you and may you he preserved. P S .—We send you herewith a letter which we have just received from our soldiers at Am Omaira for perusal. [Accompaniment to Abdali Sultan’s letter dated the 30th Jumad Aival (11th July 1907). From—Au bin Ahmed Am Tom, and Abdulla Am Odail, Barhimi, To—S ultan Ahmed Fadthl. After compliments .—We inform you that Saeed ha Ali and his relatives have closed the roads against everybody. They have also looted five camels, four of which with their loads belonged to the Jorabis. The actual plunderers were Ahmed Ali and Saeed ha Ali. This has caused much fear in the minds of poor people who have stopped coming to Am Omaria for trade. As regards the buggalow laden with arms, we will act according to the order of Abdul Kawi and will bring the arms to you when landed in our limits. The owners (of either the arms or the buggalow) are staying with us at Am Judthair. We kept some of the Burhemis lying in ambush at Am Judthair, and some with our soldiers to watch the buggalow and report the landing of the arms, but unfortunately they were landed at Mas A1 Ara where Ahmed Saeed and his relatives levied duty on them ; although he was informed by Government to keep a watch on the buggalow and he replied that she would not anchor in his limits where the import of arms is prohibited. He wanted to get a stipend from Captain Hancock who told him to first bring some news about the arms and then he would be granted a stipend of Ms. 50. The arms were landed on their coast and they levied duty on them and allowed the owners to go. We write you this to inform you about the Attifi and greetings. Extract from the weekly letter of the Resident at Aden, dated the 20th July 1907. ***** 6. I am forwarding officially a copy of another letter which I have received from the Abdali Sultan this week regarding the illicit traffic in arms. He reports the landing of 60,000 rounds at Mas Al Ara with an air of regret and surprise at our allowing such a thing which is under the circumstances rather amusing. One hudred of the cartridges have found their way into Sheikh Othman in the possession of a Bedouin who has been promptly arrested and remanded for further enquiries. At present the names of the dhows and their masters concerned in the import have not transpired; but I gather that they belong to Jibouti. * * * * * Extracts from the Somaliland Intelligence Report, No. 12, of 1907, received with the weekly letter of the Resident at Aden, dated the 20th July 1907. ***** One Ibrahim “ Moghul ” Aden Madoba, one of the Mulla’s most active Arms traffic. (See also report of Italian agents among the Warsangh, was sent Consul, No. 8 , 22 nd May.) with a caravan some six months ago, and he has returned on a second mission of the same kind. Curiously enough this agent was similarly employed three years ago : the Intelligence reports of ItlOT contain mention of Ibrahim Boghul being (Vide Intelligence report, 23rd March 1904.) sentj to square the WarSUngli ” and to collect arms and ammunition.52 The importation and sale of arms is still a flourishing trade in Djibouti. A certain number are sold and re-exported Arms tra o. A ra | 3 j a) majority seem to go through Abyssinian Somaliland into the Ogaden country. This trade seems to be connived at if not (encouraged by at least the lesser Abyssinian officials. Arms, etc., going to Arabia from Djibouti are eventually introduced to the eastern parts of the Protectorate and undoubtedly a goodly percentage are sold to the Mulla. Arms introduced through the Ogaden country doubtless even tually find their way into the hands of the Mulla or his followers. The arms are sold both at Djibouti and Dera-Dowa. On 3rd June, a Warsangli was arrested in Maala with 300 rounds of ammunition in his possession. He was Arms traffic. sentenced to two months’ imprisonment. Three Mijourtein men, Esa Earah, Ahmed Sungoyeh and Ahmed Shirwa, have, under orders from the Mulla, gone to Maskat to purchase arms and ammunition. They are well provided with funds. The man Osman Derwish referred to in my last report was released from prison, and has left Aden for the “ Harouu ” via Bossasso. Captain Christian, R.N., arranged for his passage in a Mijourtein dhow. Osman Derwish is himself a Mijourtein. A Zeyla fishing dhow arrived from the Makhir coast, but the crew know nothing of any impor tance. Although the Mulla is still in possession of a considerable number of rifles (roughly estimated at from 1,000 to 1,500) there is little doubt that he is at present very short of ammunition. After a recent visit to Illig the Italian Consul-General expressed the opinion that the Mulla’s temporary inactivity was due to the necessity of replenishing his stock of ammunition, a supply of „ , , ^ . which he was then expecting to reach him through the Baghen country. Owing to British and Italian surveillance over the sea-borne traffic in arms, it seems that the Mulla is at present mainly dependent on the overland traffic from ^ , » , Djibouti to Abyssinian Somaliland, and thence through the Baghen country. The importance of closing this channel of supply has been represented to the Abyssinian Government through the British Minister at Adis Ababa, and as a result the Emperor Menelek has promised to send immediate orders to check the traffic in the Arussi country, which seems to be the chief medium of supply. It is open to question whether the Mulla obtains arms or ammunition through the Warsangli port of Las Khoral. The present friendly intercourse between the Warsangli and the Derwishes is probably more of a commercial than of a political nature. Owing to the disadvantages of Illig as a port of call for native craft, the Mulla finds it more convenient to obtain his food and clothing supplies from Las Khorai, which has a long established and direct trade with Aden and other Arabian ports. Every possible precaution is taken by both traffic. The Warsangli Sultan has been frequently warned of the conse quence of importing arms and ammunition, and the Protectorate armed dhows search all native craft putting in at Warsangli ports. Extract from the weekly letter of the Resident at Aden, dated the 28th July 1907. ***** 12. The same correspondent writes that the Zaranik tribes are actively importing arms from Jibouti at a place called A1 Jah or, when they fear interruption by^ one of the Hodeida gunboats, at Mutaina near Mokha.

From—H. O. Quin, Esq., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to paragraph 2 of my letter No. 5571, dated the 9th August 1907| I am directed to state that His Excellency the Governor in Council is unable to endorse the Political Resident’s proposal in paragraph 5 of his letter No. 4502, dated the 20th July 1907, as the establishment of posts and patrols to check the trade in arms would be inconsistent with the policy which His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India desires to see adopted in the relations of Government towards the Arab Chiefs. In view of the existing orders as to the general policy to be adopted in regard to our relations with the tribes, the only remedy which the Governor in Council would consider it worth while to adopt is that indicated in paragraph 11 of this department letter No. 1805, dated the 6th March 1906, on which no orders have yet been received. Extracts from the weekly letters of the Resident at Aden, dated respectively the 24th and 31st August, and 7th September 1907. Arms traffic .—Ogaden sources report that a certain amount of arms and ammunition filter through from Djibouti to the RerHaroun, and Rer All appar ently passing through via, or near Jigjiga, thence on southwards and eastwards, through the Ogaden. The Abyssinians always collect all rifles found in the Ogaden when they go down there, but there is very large number in use at present amongst the Ogaden tribes. Arms traffic .—The sale of arms to Ogaden tribes from Arusiland and the Webbe Shebelli will probably cease so long as the Abyssinian force is in that direction, but I am inclined to believe that the main source of supply is from Djibouti, either via Harrar or else through the Gadabursi country. I am informed by a reliable man that last year one of the Gadabursi took 16 rifles from Djibouti and disposed of them to the Ba Awadleh at the rate of four camels per rifle and 20 rounds of ammunition. Sultan Omar Magan of the Ibrahim has informed me that some of the rifles his tribes have come from such a source, some from Harrar, these being bought out of the town in the night by men employed by the agents selling them, and handed over to the purchasers and some from an Abyssinian on the Webbe Shebelli. French Somaliland-Abyssinia Arms Nothing of any importance to report. No reports received. In connection with the arms question it is of interest to note that, accord ing to Reuter’s telegram, 24th July, an Order has been gazetted in Berlin, with drawing the prohibition on export of arms and ammunition to Abyssinia. Is this a German reply to concerted action in Abyssinia by Britain France, and Italy? If so, and should the “ trade” commence operations, it is difficult to see how the traffic will flourish when the ports of entry are held by the three 3956 F. D. ■54 powers already named. Locally, there is nothing further to add to what was contained in last month s report* 13 The Assistant Resident, Perim, again writes that there is still a brisk traffic in arms between Jibouti and the 31st August 1907. opposite coast.

Ras-al-Arah is the most con venient port for the traffic between here and Perim. But Abdali supplies are generally landed at Khor Umeira and occasionally, when, for some reason either of these ports are considered risky, consignments are landed at Imran or A1 Mujahar. # Extract from the weekly letter of the Resident at Aden i dated the 21st September 1907. # * * » * A copy of the India Office despatch, No. 28-Secret, dated the 6th Sep tember 1907, regarding the illicit traffic in arms has reached me direct.

I recommend also conclusion of agreements with all the Chiefs of the east coast on lines of those concluded by Kemball in Persian Gulf in 1902. These are comparatively useless unless Maskat concludes mutual agreements. It will be necessary to supply reasonable number of arms to Chiefs for their protection—see my letter 3910, dated 29th June 1907, and to give them pecuniary interest in exclusion of all illicit traffic.

They recognise that the measures therein proposed and also the suggestions for posts on shore(s) are probably not consistent with the existing policy of His Majesty’s Government, but can make no fresh suggestion. Naval patrol would be useful, but could scarcely be effective without heavy expenditure. 0.1. 0. P. O.—No. 3956 P. D.—2-1-08—20—A. D'C.No. 70:i5. dated Bombay Castle, the 1st October 1907. ' ' From—H. O. Odin, Esq., Acting Secretary to Government, Bombay, Political Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Holland’s letter No. 471-E.B., dated the 8th February 1907, relative to the proposed amendment of the Aden Sea Traffic in Arms Regulation, 1902. 2. As desired in paragraph 3 of that letter, I am to forward, herewith, for the approval of the Government of India, a revised draft of clause 12 of the Hegulation which defines at length the subject matter of the rules and provides for their publication, and to state that in the opinion of the Governor in Council the definition of the term “ Native Vessel ” should be the same as that in Article 31 of the General Act of the Brussels Conference which defines a “Native Vessel ” as a vessel fulfilling one of the following conditions :— (1) It must present the outward appearance of native build or rig; (2) It must be manned by a crew of whom the Captain and the majority of the seamen belong by origin to a country having a sea-coast on the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, or the Persian Gulf. The term ct British Protected Port ” might in the opinion of the Governor in Council be held to mean any port within the British Protectorate of Aden or Somaliland. 3. With reference to paragraph 4 of Mr. Holland’s letter, I am to observe that the Government of Bombay fully realise that the force of the proposed Regulation will be weakened by the omission of a provision requiring a bond to be executed before the grant of a port clearance. At the same time, how ever, in the absence of arrangements, made through the co-operation of the other powers concerned, for security bonds to be taken at all Ports and not at Aden only, they are unable to modify the view expressed in paragraph 3 of Sir Steyning W. Edgerley’s letter No. 2149, dated 19th March 1906. Article 34 of the General Act of the Brussels Conference contemplates the registration of native vessels, and I am to state that the Governor in Council is of opinion that, if and when provision has been made for the registration of ; vessels of this class, there would be no objection to providing that only vessels - so registered may visit Aden with arms on board. 4. I am to forward herewith, for the information of the Government of India, copy of a letter from the Political Resident, Aden, No. 3538, dated the 8th June 1907, and of its accopaniments. 8921 F.

With reference to correspondence ending with Political Department Endorsement No. 1421, dated the 22nd Eehruary 1907, regarding suggestions made by the Government of India to amend Regulation III of 1902 and to take certain other measures to more effectively control the illicit traffic in arms in the Gulf of Aden, I have the honour to forward copy of a note dated the 3rd June 1907 which has been submitted to me by my Eirst Assistant Resident and to state that I have nothing in particular to add to the views which are there expressed. Memorandum by Captain F. de B. Hancock, Acting First Assistant Resident, Aden, dated the 3rd June 1907. Regulation III of 1902 was the outcome of the suggestion that all traffic should at times be suspended between Aden and certain Bombay Political Department bo. M2, dated the „ t th g c t Bast 0 f Berbera, 25tn January 1902, r . i i -i . p as a coercive measure calculated to eniorce compliance with the general prohibition of the illicit introduction of fire-arms at those ports. 2. In Political Resident’s letter No. 114, dated the 19th April 1902, it was stated that Colonel Swayne considered ic unnecessary that all trade to the Somaliland Protect”- orate should pass through Berbera. And this led to the framing of certain Rules which eventually took the form of Regulation III of 1902, and became law under the Govern ment of lAdia Act of 1870 (33 Viet. c. 3). At the same time * Copy attached. a Notification* was issued on the Somali Coast, dated the 30th September 1902, under Article 24 of the Somaliland Customs Regulations of 1902 to the effect that all native craft proceeding from any port or place in the Gulf of Aden and bound for any place or port in the Somaliland Protectorate Bast of Berbera should first touch at one of the three Customs ports of Berbera, Karam or Hais and should not leave that port until they had obtained from the Customs authorities written permission to proceed to their destination direct. 3. And at the same time Italy co-operated to the extent of agreeing that all Midjour- teyn dhows should be similarly bound to first call at the British port of Hais before pro ceeding to the various small ports on their coast. 4. The Regulation thus went beyond the scope of a temporary coercive measure, and imposed certain permanent restrictions upon trade passing between Aden and certain places in the Gulf of Aden which Government, whilst refusing to go so far as to sanction the t! Aden Port Clearance and Trade Registration Bill” referred to in Govern ment Resolution No. 2017, dated the 25th April 1900, deemed it expedient to impose, with a view to checking the illicit arms traffic between Jibuti and the Somali Coast. 5. The Regulation also included special provision against the carrying of arms and ammunition between the Arabian and African Coasts of the Gulf of Aden, and for certain powers of search at Aden which could not otherwise be provided for without making Aden u, Customs Port, which was deemed inexpedient. 6. In Government of India letter No. 1405-E., dated the 4th June 1884, it had been observed that the Arms Act was no doubt intended to be worked with the aid of the Sea Customs Act. And the Regulation apparently aimed at such a combination as was possible without resorting to the undesirable expedient of making Aden a Customs Port. 7 In the Somaliland Protectorate itself there are both a Firearms and Customs Regulations which, worked in harmony, should impose an effective check upon the illicit traffic in arms. But Regulation III of 1902 was framed with the intention of imposing such further check upon the traffic as could be secured by the co-operation of the Indian Government. con 477 — 18. Certain serious defects in the Regulation were brought to notice in Political Resi dent's letter No. 240, dated the 5th August 1904, and in Bombay Political Department Memorandum No. 1421, dated the 22nd February 1907, the Political Resident is asked to express an opinion on certain suggestions made to remedy those defects and to take such further measures to more effectively control the arms traffic. 9. Meanwhile he has been informed in Political Department Memorandum No. 3382, dated the 8th May 1907, of an agreement that has been entered into between France, Italy and Great Britain to exercise a more rigorous supervision over imports of arms and ammuni tion to their territories iu Africa, on the shores of the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, and the Indian Ocean as well as over illicit exports to places outside the zone of the Brussels Convention. 10. The position has thus changed since the Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay wrote in paragraph 3 of Political Department letter No. 2149, dated the 19th March 1906, that the local authorities of the French and Italian Ports on the Red Sea littoral showed a disinclination to co-operate in measures for the suppression of the arms traffic. And there is reason to hope that a more or less uniform procedure may now be arranged on the whole littoral affected, and there is thus more urgent reason than before to provide for this at the ports of the Aden Protectorate as well as the port of Aden itself. 11. The main object of the present proposals is to prevent arms smuggling on the lines indicated in the Brussels Convention as amplified by the more recent agreement of the 13th December 1906. And whilst it may be admitted that this will be facilitated by the restriction of all traffic to certain prescribed ports as contemplated by the revised Regulation under consideration it must also be allowed that such restrictions alone are inadequate to secure the desired object and that it is essential not only to secure the active co-operation of all concerned in enforcing those restrictions, but also to secure their co-oper ation in, at the same time, enforcing the provisions referred to in Article IX of the Brussels Convention on the lines of either Part III of the Somaliland Fire-arms Regulations of 1905 or the Indian Arms Act of 1878. 12. Furthermore, it may be urged that no smuggling can be effectively checked without an efficient preventive service, and that no rules or regulations will be of any avail to check the illicit traffic in arms unless measures are taken at the same time to actually enforce them. 13. Hitherto Regulation III of 1902 has had little or no real effect in the desired direction. Arms and ammunition still pass freely between the Arabian and African Coasts of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. And there is little doubt that they will continue to do so unless and until the paramount powers concerned themselves more effectively interpose to prevent it. 14. Assuming therefore that it is really intended to take effective action, it seems essential that Great Britain as well as the other powers concerned should now resort on the littoi’al of their Protectorates to measures of intervention and interference which it is not politic and may not be even possible to adopt in the interior. 15. A considerable portion of the interior of those Protectorates is already full of fire-arms and thus the Brussels Convention has failed to prevent much harm being already done. But the evil can now be mitigated to some extent by checking supplies of ammuni tion. And further imports of arms can be prevented or at least more effectively checked by a determined effort on the part of all the powers concerned. 16. The most effective course of action would be to more rigorously check imports from Europe by ocean-going vessels. But assuming that to be impossible, some good may be obtained by checking subsequent distribution by the various native craft which chiefly undertake it. 17. flhere is no reason to believe that there is any illicit import of arms of any consequence into Aden itself or any subsequent distribution thereof from that port. And if the same could be said of Jibuti and all other ports in the vicinity which are actually visited by ocean-going steamers, it would not be necessary to devise measures to check the subsequent distribution under reference. .18, Undt r piesent ciicumstances there is known to be an extensive distribution of illicit arms on the shores of this Protectorate. And it may be agreed at once that to impose an effective check upon this traffic it is desirable either to apply the Indian Arms Act, as suggested, to the wlnde of the littoral affected, cr else to take such measures on the lines of the bubaihi Agreement of 1881 or of the various agreements which have from time to time been entered into with the Trucial Chiefs of the Persian Gulf to secure the active co-operation of ail the coast tribes in the desired restrictions. In the latter alternative it would seem essential that we should ourselves co-operate and arrange to supervise the actual arrangements which are made by our stipendiaries, and it would be expedient to enhance the value of the stipends or other consideration in lieu of which those arrangements are undertaken. 0 hh'ot 11 past experience it may be urged that the application of the Arms Act and the assumption ot the necessary jurisdiction to apply it would form the most effective iem i e j k’ a i ^ an ^ °^ er C ° UrSe • W0U ^ EGcessitate such supervision and interfei •ence as would be almost tantamount to a direct assumption of authority. But on the other hand it'# 3 SeVaLts m^ho^w 1 !, 0 ' 1 ^!, 40 the necessa ry co-operation of the tribes concerned by \ arious methods which have been suggested, such as enhancement of stinend and ourselves supplying the reasonable requirements of their own regular armed forces. a a j^ S 1 ^° rev ^ s ®^ Regulation, the same general remarks mav be held to annlv And it is furthermore to be again observed that for this to be really effective it is essential that all the powers concerned should follow a similar procedure to tha Xh Le Government of India eventually decide to themselves adopt. J 1118 co 'Operation can be secured, the provision for security bonds to be rmshed before the grant of Port Clearances might with advantage be detained But theie should be the same procedure at all the ports which are prescribed, and the production on^ of therm ^ ^ ^ ^ b ° nd Sh ° Uld be requisite to the S raat of a Fo ^ Clearance at every 22.

Many vessels leave Aden for places on the Eastern Coast of the Protectorate anti hence proceed w.th a fair wind to the Eastern Coast of Africa. And it is by such vesSs that it is probable that arum are chiefly conveyed to the Somali Coast. Similarly many vessels proceed from the vicinity of Obokh to places on the Western Coast of the^Profcec^ toiate and thence elsewhere without perhaps ever coming into Aden at all. 24. Assuming the requisite co-operation of all concerned to render the regulation effective, the revised draft may be further considered 01 (i) In the first place it would seem desirable to apply the Regulation to vessels pro- ceedmg elsewhere than the Gulf of Aden. Prance, Italy aud Great Britain have agreed to take action to prevent disorder in Africa and on the shores of the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean as well as the Gulf of Aden, and further to check the illicit export of arms etc., to places beyond the zone of the Brussels Convention. The scope of the Regulation may be considered accordingly. And it would seem more convenient to apply it to a certain class of vessel than to vessels proceeding to certain places. “ Coasting Vessels ” would seem a convenient term subject to such further definition as Government may deem desirable. And incidentally further consideration might now be paid to the proposal to apply Act XIX of 1838 to Aden which was vetoed in Government Resolution in the Marine Department, No. 565 of the 1st October 1881. At any rate this Act might be applied to vessels owned by British subjects. There is a Somaliland Registration of Vessels Reo-ula- tion of 1904 in force on the Somali Coast. And I attach a copy of that and of a demi- official letter dated the 26th March 1907 which I have received from Captain Cordeaux on the subject. (ii) The term “ Coasting Vessels ” might be substituted for “ native vessels ' in Rule 12 of the draft Regulation. Aud this might be so worded as to give registered vessels only the privilege of carrying arms for self-defence. In Rule 8 there is°reference to a pass which may be granted elsewhere by a public official. And as both France and Italy appear from the latest agreement to contemplate the registration of vessels, they might at the same time co-operate in licensing registered vessels only to carry arms for self-defence. (iii) The Regulation might include a general clause empowering the Resident to make rules for carrying its objects and purposes into effect. Certain rules of this sort were issued in 1902. And I attach copies of my revision of these of 1905 and of the letters I received on the subject from the Senior Naval Officer, His Majesty's Commissioner ot the Somaliland Protectorate, and the Consul-General for Italy. These have not been actually issued pending the revision of the Regulation itself. But some rules of the sort seem desirable. (iv) It is also a question whether some further rules would not be useful in regard to “ coasting vessels ' only under the Sea Customs Act on the lines of the rules which for merly existed at Aden and are embodied in annexure 1 to the accompaniments to Govern ment Resolution in the Revenue Department No. 2617, dated the 25th April 1902. I hesitate to again raise the question of the “ Aden Port Clearance and Trade Registration Bill ” : but I would take the opportunity to mention two facts which have recently come to notice:— (a) A certain number of native craft smuggle both tobacco and specie from Aden into Turkish Ports under a false clearance for other ports, mostly Massowah ; and (5) the incorrectness of manifests issued to coasting steamers at Aden has recently given rise to complaints by the Somaliland Authorities. (v) As to Rules 3 and 4 of the Regulation, I have already remarked upon the desira bility of including other places than Aden amongst those where a vessel should upon arrival be required to produce a Port Clearance from the last prescribed port visited, and amongst those from which a vessel should not depart without such clearance. And the same remarks apply to Rules 7 and 9.4 ,,,11 En | e 8 involves considerations regarding jorisdiction whiclj Government have doubtless considered. There would seem to he some d.fficulty about an Aden Magistrate the master or owner of an Italian dhow accused of carrying arms between Mokalla and Bundar Cassim. But granted the necessary co-operation such a case could perhaps be “sposed of by an Italian Court if one is ever established on the Somali Coast. Similar remarks apply to Rule 10. 25 No further remarks seem called for on the present proposals. Executive orders are necessary regarding the arrest and custody of vessels and offenders within the territorial waters of the Protectorate. And when the Regulation has been passed, and the Arms Act or other provisions for the guidance of officers have also been applied, it will remain to specify the prescribed ports and to then take such further action as may be deemed necessary to secure the co-operation of the Coast tribes of the Protectorate. 26 In discussing the matter before proceeding on leave, General DeBrath observed that if the Arms Act were applied to the Protectorate it should be to the coast on y as distinct from the interior. And he added that it was desirable that the rules eventually applied should be as simple as possible so as to be readily understood by the Chiefs concerned. He also concurred as to the desirability of extending the draft Regulation beyond the limits of the Gulf of Aden as indicated in paragraph 24 (1) of this note. 27 As to the question of the omission of the provision requiring a bond to be executed before the grant of a Port Clearance he agreed that this omission would tend to the benefit of the general trade of the port. But he remarked that as under existing arrangements Miiiourteyn dhows were not allowed to leave Aden before they had furnished a bond to the Italian Consul to call at Bandar Cassim before proceeding elsewhere on the Coast of Italian Somaliland, it would be necessary to secure his co-operation m this as well as in other matters affecting the illicit traffic which it is desired to suppress. SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE, Customs Notification. Whereas it has been found necessary, with a view of checking the illicit traffic of fire-arms, to exercise greater control and supervision over all native craft trading with the Ports of this Protectorate. Notice is hereby given that all native craft proceeding from any Port or place in the Gulf of Aden and hound for any Port or place in the Somaliland Protectorate east of Berber a shall first touch at one of the three Customs Ports of Berbera, Karam or Hais, and shall not leave that Port until they have obtained from the Customs Authorities written permission to proceed to their destination direct. The Master or owner of any vessel that touches at any Port or place in the Protector ate east of Berbera without the written permission of Customs Authorities^ at one of the three Ports of Berbera, Karam or Hais shall be deemed to have done so in contravention of Article 24 of the “ Somaliland Customs Regulations, 1902 ”, and shall be liable to the penalties therein prescribed, that is to say, forfeiture of the vessel and her cargo, together with a fine not exceeding Rs. 1,000, and imprisonment of either kind, which may extend to two months. Berbera, September 30^, 1902. (Signed) H. E. S. Cordeaux. Letter dated the 26th March 1907. Rrom—H. E. S. Cordeaux, Commissioner for the Somaliland Protectorate ; To Captain F. DeB. Hancock, Acting First Assistant Resident, Aden. The Registration of Vessels Regulations were introduced with the object of enabling us to exercise a greater control over native craft, as required by the Brussels Act. Of course, in compelling vessels to register, we are making ourselves virtually responsible for their conduct—a responsibility which, if accepted indiscriminately and without due precautions, might lead us into difficulties. It is for this reason that compulsory registration is enforced only in the case of local dhows, i. e., dhows engaged in the coasting trade, and whose owners are domiciled in one of the ports of our administration, i. e., Zaila, Bulbar, or Berbera. We do not enforce registration in the case of dhows belonging to other ports of the Protectorate, e. g., Hais, Karam, Las Khorae, and other flag ports for the reason that we have not sufficient hold over them, and cannot, therefore, accept responsibility for their good behaviour. O I5 Similarly, I should hesitate to register sea-going dhows, such as the Persian Gulf Dhows, unless the owner had substantial property in Berbera. Personally I think compulsory registration would afford a very useful means of exercising greater control over native cralt, provided it were universally adopted by the local authorities of the three powers interested ; otherwise, it is merely a self-denying ordinance. Like other Regulations devised with the object of checking the arms-traffic, they must, to be of any use, be universally adopted, each party accepting its own share of the responsibility. The Italians, I believe, are registering their local dhows as far as possible, and if the French will do the same, then I think there would be a good case for Aden following suit and the additional responsibility incurred would be equally shared. he \ it, | [Draft Regulations prepared by Mr. Hurst on Sir C.

The amount of security furnished under Section 3 of Regulation III of 1902 will, as heretofore, be calculated at the rate of Rs. 10 per ton subject to a minimum charge of Rs. 100. 20. A list of the more important Ports on the Arabian and African Coasts of the Gulf of Aden is attached (Appendix I). None of the Ports on the African Coast of the Gulf of Aden may be visited without permission obtained from the proper authority of one of the prescribed Ports on that Coast and the Masters of all Native craft should be warned accordingly. 21.

Cordeaux, Acting Commissioner for the Somaliland Protectorate; To The Acting Political Resident, Aden. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Confidential letter No. 1670 of 19th March enclosing a copy of revised Rules which it is proposed to publish under Regulation III of 1902. I do not anticipate any difficulty about complying with Rule 9, but I would ask that Port Clearances for Karam may be written in Arabic as well as in English. With regard to Rule 7, it has been noticed that vessels from Aden often _ leave some days after the date of the Port Clearance, thereby making it difficult to decide whether the time actually occupied in the passage has been abnormally long.^ A^ strict adherence to the provisions of Rule 7 should obviate any further difficulty on this point. 2. As regards the 2nd paragraph of your letter under reply, there appears to be no objection to requiring vessels proceeding to British Somaliland on their way to or back from Italian Somaliland to conform with the same procedure as other vessels, and to call first at one of the prescribed Ports in this Protectorate.15 EE-DRAET OF SECTION 12. 12 (1) Subject to the control of the Power for Resident to Governor pf Bombay make mies. in Council tbe Re sident may make rules to provide for all or any of tbe following matters, namely :— (C/. xi of 1878, s. 6.)

(5) determining tbe officers by whom, tbe form in which, and the terms and conditions on and subject to which, any such license shall be granted, and (C/. xm of 1889, s. 26 ( 31 )). (&lt;?) generally, the carrying out of the purposes and objects of this Regulation. (Cf. viii of 1899, s. 9). (2} In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, the rules under clause (6) of sub-section (1) may (a) fix the fee to be charged for any such license; (&amp;) limit the time during which any such license is to continue in force; ' (c) provide for the renewal of any such license, and its cancella tion or suspension in the case of any breach of tbe terms and conditions on and subject to which it is granted; (d) provide for ascertaining the quantity and description of any arms on board any native vessel; (e) provide for the marking for the purpose of identification, and the registering, of any arms, covered by any such license ; (/) require the person holding or acting under any such license to produce the same, and to produce or account for the arms covered by the same when called upon by an offi cer of Government so to do; and (ff) provide for the deposit and cus tody on shore of any arms covered by any such license, while the vessel is in port. 3924 F.

S INo. 4887-E.B., dated Fort William, the 21st December 1907. From—The Assistant Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To—H. O. Quin, Esq., Acting Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No- 7035 ’ da ^ ed the 1st October 11907, relative to the proposed amendment ot the Aden fcea Traffic in Arms Regulation, 1902. 2. In reply, I am directed to enclose herewith a revised draft of the regulation which reproduces the new clause 12 proposed by the Bombay Gov ernment, as also the definition of the term &lt;c Native Vessel. I am, ^ owever, o point out that the relation between clause 12 (1) {a) and clause 8 is not quite clear. Clause 12, as originally drafted, was intended to provide a special licensing system for arms carried for purposes of defence. But it has now been widened so as to introduce a new prohibition, which appears to be mostly included m, but partly subsidiary to, the main prohibitory provisions of clause 8. It will also he observed that:— (1) different geographical expressions are used in the two clauses, the reason for which is not apparent; (2) clause 12 (1) («) is limited to native vessels, whereas clause 8 applies to all vessels; (8) clause 12 (7) {a) is limited to arms, whereas clause (8) includes also ammunition, military stores, and explosives. 3. I am to request that the Government of India may be furnished with any further remarks that the Government of Bombay may wish to offer with regard to these two clauses.[ Cf. Reg.

ITALIAN EMBASSY, January 4th, 1908, Your Excellency:- I have to thank Your Excellency for your Note No.38892 of November 29th last stating that the British Government had taken the necessary steps in order to co-operate in the capture of the Mullah’s agent, who had been promoting the arms traffic from Maskat to the Somali coast, as soon as further in formation respecting his movements had reached the British Government. The experience gained on this occasion has shown to my Government that if it is desired to ren der efficacious the provisions for the suppression of the arms traffic, it is not possible to wait, be fore acting thereon, until precise information has arrived from the places concerned; because informa- i tion reaches Europe late and in a contradictory form, as has happened in the present instance. Consequently my Government think it would / be(Signed) A. dl San Giuliano. be advisable that the British Government should give anticipator and permanent orders that a British vessel should always be ready to co-operate, when the necessity arises and without waiting orders from London, in the surveillance of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, for the purpose of suppressing and hindering the Illicit traffic in arms and ammuni tion. In this way the British authorities at Aden and the Italian Consulate there could take at once the necessary measures with all due speed. I should be grateful if Your Excellency would inform me of the views of the British Government on the above proposal. I have &amp;c..Copy. DOWNING STREET, 44592/1907. (35L Decerober 31st, 1907.

Slr:- I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.44069 of the 25th instant, enclosings copy of a note from the Italian Ambassador respecting the contraband trade in arms for the Mullah. If the Muscat trade is referred to, as would ap pear from your covering letter I would ooserve that trade has hitherto been confined to Ulig and other ports in the Italian Protectorate, and does not nor is likely to affect the coast of the British Protectorate. The consideration of any further pre ventive measures which it may be desirable to take locally in respect of this traffic would, therefore more nroperly rest with the Italian authoriuies in Aden on the one hand and the Indian Political Offi cers in the Persian Gulf on the other. The latter it is understood, he.ve for some time past been con- The Under Secretary at State, Colonial Office.concerting measures to this end with the Naval Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Squadron. It is observed however that in the Italian Ambassador's note, the contraband trade in arms bet ween the Arabian Coast and Somaliland is specifically referred to. This trade consists of arms and ammu- nition which are exported from Jibuti to ports on the Arabian littoral and thence reflected by means of native dhows on to the Somali Coast. As far as the British Protectorate is concerned, the only portion of the Somali Coast which is in any way open to the introduction of these arms is the V/arsangeli country with its principal port of Loskhorai. This portion of the coast is regularly patrolled by the Protec torate armed dhows and also by His Majesty's ship on the Aden Station which it has been arranged should make periodical cruises along the coast of the Pro tectorate. These cruises are temporarily suspended during the monsoon months (May to September) but it is presumed they are now being regularly carried out as before. Under present conditions I do not think moremore can be done as regards safeguarding the coast of the British Protectorate, but the British and Italian authorities at Aden might with advantage arrange for a more regular patrol both of the north era coast of the Italian Protectorate by Italian Ships of war and armed dhows and of the Aden Protec torate littoral by His Majesty's Ships on the Aden Stat ion.

In connection with Foreign Department telegram No. ,^75, dated 3rd August last, and my reply dated 9th idem regarding the visit to Maskat of agents of the Somaliland Mullah for the purchase of arms and ammunition, I have the honour to report the steps which have been taken to prevent the acquisition of arms by the persons referred to. 2. You are doubtless aware that at this season of the year there is consider- Eight enclosures. a1:de communication between Oman and Somaliland, the Somalis bringing mother- of-pearl and other articles to this country and returning with cargoes of dates to their own. In view of the fact (reported in my letter dated 22nd July last) that an agent of the Mullah had succeeded in removing a consignment of arms from Oman last year, I was on the watch for the possible visit of others prior to the receipt of the telegram above referred to, and upon the arrival of the two men mentioned in my reply, Muhammad (not Ahmad) bin Farah, and Hamad (not Ahmad) bin Sharu, issued a warning to British subjects on no account to sell either to Somalis or to any person whom they might have reason to expect was purchasing for Somalis, and obtained promises from His Highness the Sul tan and my French colleague that they would do everything possible to restrain their subjects and proteges from effecting such transactions. Hence the failure of the Somalis mentioned to obtain arms in the first instance. 3. Before proceeding to Karachi at the end of August, I thought ft better to make communications to Sir Saiyid Faisal, and to the French Consul, in writing, and received from them satisfactory replies : that of M. Laronce and a trans lation of that of His Highness are attached (enclosures 1 and 2). 4 . I must here invite attention to the ease with which arms can be acquired by undesirable persons even in the event of everything possible having been done in Maskat to prevent such acquisition. They have merely to retire to some other port of Oman and from thence to despatch an agent to Maskat for the purpose required. This agent buys the arms through one of the local brokers, and in all probability the name of the real purchaser never comes to the ears of the broker, much less to those of the arms merchant. It is almost certain that this was the course taken in the instances referred to in this report, as the Sultan has several times warned those of his subjects who deal in arms in accordance with his promise to me. 5. Early in September while at Karachi, I was informed by Captain Scott, the Agency Surgeon, that 300 rifles had been purchased in Maskat for the Mullah’s agent and despatched to A 1 Khadra on the Batinah coast and a day or two later that 150 more had been sent to Sur on the same account. I therefore addressed a letter to Commander Litchfield, R.N , of H.M S. u Sphinx ” which was about to leave Karachi (enclosure 3), asking him to visit Sur and A 1 Khadra en route to Maskat, and, if possible, to obtain possession of the arms. An account of his visits and of the unfriendly reception which the “ Sphinx ”encountered at AI Khadra, and its sequel, will be found in his letters, copies of which form enclosures 4 and 7 to this letter. Enclosure 5 is Captain Scott’s letter to the Commander of the Sphinx after the arrival of the latter from Al Khadra, and 6 is His Highness the Sultan’s letter to the Wall of “ Suwaikh ” dealing with the reception above mentioned. 6. Upon my return to Maskat on September 30th, His Highness the Sultan shewed me a letter which he had received from the Shaikh of the Mijirtaiyin, Sultan Uthman bin Mahmud, requesting him to prevent the Mullah’s agent from acquiring arms, and asking him to keep an eye upon his subjects Ali bin Sham’ and Muhammad bin Farah. The letter, a translation of which is attached (enclosure No. 8) does not give the name of the Mullah’s agent, but there is no doubt that it is Hamad bin Sharu’ who is not related to the Ali bin Sham’ spoken of by Sultan Uthman. Muhammad bin Farah has come to Oman for dates only, and is not an agent of the Mullah as we supposed at first. 7. A day or two after my return I proceeded to Sur arriving there on the morning of the 5th ultimo in H.M.S. “ Sphinx.” First, every dhow at anchor—some twelve in number—was examined. Only one was the property of, or in any way connected with, Somalis, this was owned by Ali bin Sharu/ and contained a camo of dates. There were no arms on board, and the crew assured us that the owner had no intention of carrying any. I landed at Aigeh, the settlement of the Bani Bu Ali, and proposed a house-to-house search for Somali arms, but this was objected to by the people who could not be persuaded that we did not intend to seize their own arms. In the evening the Jennebeh Shaikhs were interviewed. They denied positively the presence of Somali arms either in their quarter or at Aigeh and repeated their promises to remain on the watch and to report any certain informa tion they might obtain. 8. I then visited the Batinah coast and on October nth vralked along the five miles of shore upon which the group of villages lie which jointly own the name of Al Khadra. This locality had not previously been visited by me, and I was surprised to find that the Yal Sa’ad who inhabit the district are as little disposed to acknowledge the sovereignty of Sir Saiyid Faisal as the rebellious tribes of Ja’alan and the Sharkiya. The Shaikhs of the tribe, Hamad bin Hilal and others, for w r hom I had brought letters from the Sultan, had retired inland, and although the people on the coast were polite enough, they were not disposed to. sny information beyond denying the presence of any Somalis in the neighbourhood. The few dnows were duly searched, but none were at all suspicious. 9* I returned to Maskat on the 14th, and the following day received an anonvmous letter from the Jennebeh Shaikhs of Sur reporting that 100—150 rifles which had been purchased by the Mullah’s agent were lying hidden in some house in Aigeh I informed the Sultan and we each wrote to Shaikh Abdullah bin Tallin, Chief of the Bam Bu Ali, explaining the circumstances and asking him to effect the surrender of the arms. His reply is awaited. Two days later 1 received detailed information from a secret agent at Sur, that nine cases of arms and ammunition, the property of Hamad bin Sham’, had been brought there from Al Khadra and placed in the house of one Mussalim bin Hamad Al hansi. As soon as H.M.S. ‘'Lapwing” arrived on the 26th ultimo I again left for bur, and on arrival inspected the house referred to without giving previous notice to the owner. Nothing was found, and he protested his innocence. We again impressed upon the Suns the necessity for supporting His Excellency the Sultan and His Majesty s Government in respect to this matter and returned to Maskat _ ins practically certain that the supplies alluded to in the last paragra are in any case the only arms which have been procured on behalf of the Mulia] agent; the total may be roughly estimated at 450 rifles, which are oft c eap pattern as 1 have already reported, and perhaps 50,000 rounds of ammu A?

Beyond the collection of such information as this report contains, and the possibility that our activity may have frightened the Somalis into desisting from the acquisitions of arms and ammunition, my efforts in this matter have not had much definite result, but I have described their course at some length in order that His Majesty’s Government may see that everything possible has been done, and that, in this connection at least, no charge can be brought against them which would weaken their case as the forthcoming arms conference which was alluded to in Foreign Office letter No 14,496, dated 15th May 1907, a copy of which was forwarded to us under Foreign Department endorsement No. 2,300, dated 24th June last. I beg to express the hope that the approaching conference will produce some result in connection with the cessation or limitation of the arms trade in Oman : not only on account of the extent to which the influence of His Majesty’s representative is weakened by its continuance and the danger in which it places our interest? on the Noith-West Frontier of India and elsewhere, but also in consideration of the fact that in the interests of civiliza tion it is becoming more important as time goes on to place additional obstacles in the way of the indiscriminate acquisition of firearms by ignorant fanatics. 12. A copy of this letter and its enclosures will be forwarded to the Govern ment of India in the Foreign Department.

Your honoured letter dated 27th August, in which you mention that the Great Government wishes me to forbid those of my subjects who are engaged in the arms trade from selling any rifles or war stores to Somalis, has reached me. I will tell them at once not to sell to the people mentioned. This is what had to be explained. Dated 27th August 1907. No. Karachi ; The 14 th September 1907. Sir, I I have the honour to inform you that on 3rd August last I received a tele gram from the Government of India informing me that an agent of the Somali land Mullah was expected to visit Maskat with a view to the purchase of arms and ammunition, and directing me to exercise vigilance in connection with him. 2. I discovered upon enquiry that two such agents had actually arrived in Oman, and they have been located, one is at present at Khadhra on the Batinah coast, and the other is at Sur.3. I hear that 300 rifles have already been despatched from Maskat to* Khadhra and that 150 are also being exported to Sur in a “ badan ” command ed by one Abdullah bin Muhammad. 4. I beg to suggest that steps might be taken to capture the arms which have already been purchased by the Somalis, and I should be very grateful if you could see your way to visiting Sur and Khadhra with this object in view.

Sir, With reference to your letter of the 14th instant, informing me of the reported operations and movements of certain agents of the Somaliland Mullah in connection with the purchase of arms and ammunition in Oman, and requesting me to visit Surand Knadara, on the Batineh coast, with a view ' to effecting a capture of arms purchased by Somalis, and located at those places I have the honour to inform you as follows : 2. I left Karachi at 3-30 P.M. on the 15th and arrived at Sur on the morning of the 18th, and immediately landed with my interpreter and interviewed the principal Bunyans. They had no knowledge of the arrival of any Bedan with arms from Maskat, or the storage of any arms in the place, and they stated that so far as they knew, no Somalis or their agents were now in Sur, although some Somalis had been there a month ago when they went north to buy dates (?). One Bunyan, Kello Jellouh, who lives or has frequent business in East Sur, told me that a man named Hamed bin Houmaid, an Arab of Lashkhar, near Su/ has visited Maskat during the last two or three years to buy arms for 'export to Somaliland. They believe him to be a friend of the Mullah’s. This man left for Maskat to buy some 200 nfies, and from there he intended to proceed to the Batineh coast to buy dates and pack the rifles with the date cargo calling in at Sur on his way back to Somaliland. Nothing was known of the Bedan, Captain Abdullah bin Mahomed, referred to in your letter. The Bunyans promised to communicate to you any news they may obtain. 3. Before leaving I thought it best to interview the Sheikh (?) Mahomed bin Mubarrak and Saied bin Sultan who received me very cordially. The Wali was away ; I explained to them the object of my visit, putting it to them that I had certain information that 150 rifles had recently arrived in Sur on their way to Somaliland, and that I w r as sure they would be carrying out the wishes of His Highness the Sultan, who had promised you to do what he could to frustrate the efforts of the Mullah s agents, if they would cause the arms to be delivered up to me for return to the Sultan. r I I added that such action would be appreciated by the British Government.: brinciDaf nien'nf 1 fhp f '*{ ° Ut to ,.'? la ' &lt;e enquiries and were joined by some of ihe principal men of the place.

He appeared to be much annoyed when the tricolour was discovered. n iu ! sailG ,^ fo , r Khadara in the afternoon. There being no place spelt quite like that on the chart of the Batineh coast, I selected Al Khadhra as being most similar in sound, and arrived there about noon on the 19th. This proved to be a small village composed chiefly of mat huts. I landed and was met on the beach by a ruffianly looking mixed crowd of Seedies, Baluchis, Arabs and a few \Otna ' s ‘, , e ore ^ ie m terpreter could complete the usual preliminaries ; enqui ries for the head man, etc , 1 was surprised to hear him tell me that we were being abused and told that we had no business to come to their village and had better get away quickly. • 0 ( „ . ^? e m , os ^ p^ ens ive person was a light skinned young man, whether Baluchi or Arab I am not certain. ' . .. n0 ^ onl y threatened and abused us, but prevented others who appeared f inclined to be more civil from talking to us. . I endeavoured to reason with the others, and demanded respect for the British flag, and pointed out that we were the good friends of their Sultan. This was of no avail. They said the British ship had no business there and they had no fear of the Sultan. I endeavoured to ascertain whether this place was really Khadara, and who and where the headman was—they said they had no headman, and refused* to answer any more questions. * .^ en thought it expedient to conclude the interview and returned to the ship without having mentioned the real object of our visit. 6. Wishing to make certain that I had been to the right place I then procee-d- ed to A 1 Khabura, 17 miles further west, the name being somewhat similar to Khadara. Here I found a thriving community of 50 to 60 British Indian subjects who were delighted to see the ship. They welcomed me on the beach with a salute of three guns, fired from an ancient small piece of ordnance. The wad of tfie third round fired as I stepped ashore was, incidentally, unpleasantly close to my helmet. They told me they w r ere very well treated by the Wali and Sheikh with whom their relations were very cordial, and they requested me to thank ithese gentlemen on their behalf and to express the hope that the happy relations Would continue. I I saw the Wali and Sheikh before leaving. I learnt that Khadara is the general nam-e of the villages around Al Khadhra and that the people there were of evil repute. Also that Somalis are in the habit of frequenting Al Khadhra on the way up and down the Gulf in the date season and that they purchase and ship dates from there. No Somalis ever come to Al Khabura., If ■ 7 . This information confirmed that I had been tothe-nghtplace and my suspicions that the reason for the offenstve attitude of the Al Khadhra people was that they correctly guess/the object of our .vtsit was m connection w.th Somali arms which are probably there on shore. There were no native craft at Al Khadhra. 8 I then returned to Maskat, arriving here at 8 a.tn on the 20th. I told Cantain Scott, l.M S., Acting Consul, what had happened and he has communi cated with you. I also went with Captain Scott and interviewed His Highness the Sultan with regard to the Al Khadhra incident. He expressed great regret that we had been treated in such an uncivil manner and P offered to send a letter to his Wah at As Suwaik near Al Khadhra directing him to investigate the case, and , possible punish the chief offenders, and he suggested that 1 should convey the letter in the Sphinx . o I would suggest that some action to enforce respect for our flag is desir able but as the Sultan’s authority over these people appears to be only nominal, fhe question appears to be rather a difficult one, and I shall be glad to know what action you advise. 10. I have briefly reported to my Commander-in-Chief that I met with a hostile reception from the people of Al Khadhra and that you have been com- municated with. 11 I do not consider that any further steps with regard to the capture of Somali* arms that may be at Al Khadhra or Sur can be taken by me so long as they remain ashore. At the former place, I certainly think they could only be obtained by force, but I should not think that this would be countenanced. It may perhaps be possible to do something when the arms are shipped for Somaliland if reliable and early information can be obtained as to the time and place of loading, and if possible the names of the vessels. I would enoeavour to keep a ship at or near Maskat for this service. At Sur it is not expected that the monsoon will permit the departure of any native vessels for Somaliland for some 2 or 3 weeks, and judging by the strength of the monsoon I experienced coming across, this is correct. 12. I regret that I have been unable to produce anything more tangible than this report. I have, etc., SHIRLEY LITCHFIELD, Commander and Senior Naval Officer r , Persian Gulf Division. Major W. G.

If afterwards in your opinion the steps taken have been insufficient to vindicate British prestige other measures will be ordered. Meanwhile I shouldbe much obliged if, according to our verbal plan, you will convey His Highness’ letter to the Wali of Suweikh as soon as it is convenient to you.

Now you will accompany him to Khaderah where he will land. He wishes to make an enquiry into what he has heard of arms having been taken to Khaderah for the Somalis. He desires to have them seized. If you find them seize them for I forbade them for the Somalis. Ask the Shaikhs why they did notallow the Captain to move about freely. If that was the work of immature youths it is necessary they should be punished and imprisoned. Tell the Shaikhs that such a thing should not occur again. It is necessary that when they (the man-of-war people) land they should be received with due respect and Salaam. Dated 15th Shahban 1325. FEYSAL. H.M.S. “ Sphinx, ” Maskat ; 7 he 26th September 1907. S. N. O. 70—07. Sir, In accordance with the request conveyed in your letter to me of 25th instant, I have the honour to inform you that I sailed to Maskat at 5-30 a - m -) September 26th, and arrived at As Suwaik at 1 p. m.that day. I landed and was received by the Wali to whom I delivered the letter from His Highness the Sultan, embarked the Wali and 4 of his men and proceeded to Al Khadhra, arriving there at 3-30 p. m. Having made arrangements for the event of an actively hostile reception, I landed with the Wali. We found the village practically deserted-only abouthalf a dozen men and Several women and children being visible, I saw no Somalis. One of the men, an Arab, I recognised as having been one of the principal offenders on the last occasion. His former cornpariions had apparently considered it wise to keep out of the way. This man, named Oubayed bin Hamed, immediately accosted the Wali and used similar expressions to those I had previously been favoured with. He seized the Wali by the sleeve. and fiercely demanded why he had brought us thcte again, we had no business there, clear out, etc. I was surprised that the Wali allowed the man to talk to him in this manner and I formed the conclusion that his authority could not be very great I asked the Wali who the headman was. He said that there was none, but the people were under the Shaikhs of the neighbouring villages whom he had’sent for. These gentlemen arrived, affif some delay, with several of their people. The Sultan’s letter was read to the assembly, and I demanded the produc tion of the chief offenders and the Somali arms. The Shaikhs said they did not know the men I described and knew nothing of the arms or any Somalis. They also said that nobody lived in this village and the people who had insulted us must have been strangers. I told them that I Could hot accept this explanation in view of the large number of houses (mat huts), women and children which was out of all propor tion to the small number of men now in the village. ^ As to the arms, they pressed me to search the village and two bedans at anchor. This offer I did hot accept as their anxiety that I should do so in order to confirm their denial that arms were there indicated that it would only result in waste of time, and the sun was getting low. I found that the Wali instead of taking an active part in the investigation was inclined to side with the Shaikhs and people on the defensive, and wished to put the onus on me. I told them that one man among them, Oubayed bin Hamed, could say, if he chose, who the men were and probably where the arms are. I explained that incivility and threats to British Officers and denial of the -ultan s authority could not be lightly passed over and terininate with polite phrases and doubtful expla nations. r Also that the exportation of arms to Somaliland with which the A 1 Kbadhra people were implicated was forbidden. Some one must be punished with a view to preventing such occurrences in future. As neither the Wali or the Shaikhs could produce the chief offenders, I insisted on the arrest of the only man present I was able to identify. I offered to request the Sultan’s pardon for this man if he would name the others and give any reliable information as to the present location of the Somali arms. . '; r . After considerable pleading by the Wali and Shaikhs on behalf of Oubayed bin Hamed, the VVali^ finding that I would not yield arrested the man and I returned to the ship with the Wali and his prisoner at sunset and conveyed them to Suwaik. The Wali will keep the man in confinement there pending the Sultan’s pleasure. Perhaps on reflection the man wdll avail himself of my offer referred to above. I enclose a letter from the Wali of Suwaik to His Highness the Sultan. 2. I trust that my action will meet with approval. I considered it expedient both to advance British prestige and the Sultan’s authority as well as to streng then the hand of the Wah which appeared to be capable of a little develop ment. r 3 * action t0 vindicate British prestige is in n y opinion neces sary. 1 he villagers are evidently frightened, and I think the arrest of Oubayed0 9 impressed both the Wall and the Sheikhs, and will have a beneficial result on the manners of the people. 4. As regards the capture of the Somali arms, my future action must await further information, as I think it doubtful that the arms are now in the particular village of Knadara I visited. I would venture to suggest that steps might be taken to stop the export of the arms from Maskat and Muttra by the arrest of the agents on shore at those places. Captain N.

Translation of a letter from Sultan Uthman bin Mahmud, Sheikh of the Mijirtaiyin, to His Highness Sir Saiyid Faisal^ G.C.I E., Sultan of Oman. After compliments, You are aware of the acquaintance that exists between us, and that we are in the habit mutually of assisting one another. Also you know that there is enmity between me and the false friend, and that the people of Sur have been helping the friend with arms and ammunition. Now I learn that he has bought a buggalow from the people of Sur and has sent it to you (your capital). Now it is incumbent upon me to be at enmity with your enemies and not to assist them against you, like those who are helping the false friend. So I ask you now to prevent them (the *Mullah’s agents) from taking arms from you (your Capital) as they (the arms) produce disturbances in my country, and to assist me by preventing the false friend from acquiring arms. Also to forbid the Suris to convey arms to the friend; and to allow me to deal with them (as they deserve) if they disobey your orders, as I will be able to do. Hitherto I have treated them kindly, and now they are helping the friend. Secondly, Ali bin Sharu and Muhammad bin Farah who are my sons and yours, to whom you stand in my place and that of a father, are going to your country. Please punish them if they misbehave, punish anyone who ill treats them, so long as they remain with you, and Salaam. Dated fth Rabf -ul-Akhir 1325 . G. C. B. P., Simla.—No. C 572 F.

With regard to A 1 Khadhra incident, briefly referred to in m my telegram No. 71, the natives of this place evidently have no respect for the British flag or their own Sultan. .

I have no desire to magnify the incident, but thought it necessary to report the matter in order that the political authorities may advise as to any further action. 3 . I regret to have been unable to make a capture of the arms, but so long as they remain on shore in the Sultanas territory I cannot see that the navy can take any further steps for their capture unless the employment of forcible measures is approved, which, under the circumstances, appears doubtful. .... , , 4 . Sur and Al Khadhra appear to be the ports at which it is intended to collect these arms for shipment to Somaliland, but I do not think there are any at Sur RS ^My idea is that they will be packed with dates in a native vessel at Al Khadhra, and that she will call at Sur on the way south. 5 .

WITH reference to your letter of the 14th instant, informing me of the reported operations and movements of certain agents of the Somaliland Mullah in connection with the purchase of arms and ammunition in Oman, and requesting me to visit Sur and Khadara, on the Batineh Coast, with a view to effecting a capture of arms purchased by Somalis, and located at those places, I have the honour to inform you as follows:— 2. I left Kurrachee at S’SO p.m. on the 15th and arrived at Sur on the morning of the 18th, and immediately landed with my interpreter and interviewed the principal Bunyans. They had no knowledge of the arrival of any bedan with arms from Muscat or the stowage of any arms in the place, and they stated that so far as they knew no Somalis or their agents were now in Sur, although some Somalis had been there a month ago when they went north to buy dates (?). One Bunyan, Kello Jellouh, who lives or who has frequent business in East Sur, told me that a man named Hamid-bin-Houmaid, an Arab of L ishkhar, near Sur, has visited Muscat during the last two or three years to buy arms for export to Somaliland. They believe him to be a friend of the Mullah’s. This man left for Muscat to buy some 200 rifles, and from there intended to proceed to the Batineh Coast to buy dates and pack the rifles with the date cargo, calling in at Sur on his way back to Somaliland. Nothing was known of the bedan, Captain Abduilah- hin-Mahomed, referred to in your letter. The Bunyans promised to communicate to you any news they may obtain. 3. Before leaving I thought it best to interview the Sheikhs Mohamed-bin- jMubarak and Saied-bin-Sultan, who received me very cordially. The Wali was away. I explained to them the object of my visit, putting it to them that 1 had certain information that 150 rifles had recently arrived in Sur on their way to Somaliland, and that I was sure they would be carrying out the wishes of His Highness the Sultan, who had promised you to do what he could to frustrate the efforts of the Mullah’s agents, if they would cause the arms to be delivered up to me for return to the Sultan. 1 added that such action would be appreciated by the British Government. The Sheikhs sent out to make inquiries, and were joined by some of the principal men of the place. All emphatically denied any knowledge of the existence of such a consignment of arms, or the presence at this time of any Somalis in Sur. They confirmed what the Bunyans had told me, and I also gathered that Somalis were not popular in Sur. i he Sheikhs promised to make further inquiries, and to endeavour to locate any arms that may arrive, communicating with Muscat any news they may obtain. As to the value of these promises you will be able to judge perhaps better than I can. 4. Whilst I had been ashore the native craft laying off Sur had been searched by my directions on the offchance of their having arms on board. None were found. One incident in connection with this search may be of interest to you. A French flag was found in a locker of the bedan “ Taous,” Captain Salem-bin-Abdullah, of Muscat. This captain, in common with all others before being boarded, had stated that he traded upon the Arab flag.

There being no place spelt quite like that on the chart of the Batineh Coast, I selected Al Khadhra, as being most similar in sound, and arrived there about noon on the 19th. This proved to be a small village composed chiefly of mat huts. 1 landed, and was met. on the beach by a ruffianly- looking mixed crowd of Seedies, Baluchis, Arabs, and a few Somalis. Before the interpreter could complete the usual preliminaries—inquiries for the Headman, &amp;c. 1 was surprised to hear him tell me that we were being abused, and told that we had no business to come to their village, and had better get away quickly. The most offensive person was a light-skinned young man, whether Baluchi or Arab 1 am not certain. He not only threatened and abused us, but prevented others who appeared to be inclined to be more civil from talking to us. 1 endeavoured to reason with the others, and demanded respect for the British flag, and pointed out that we were the good friends of their Sultan. This was of no avail. They said the BritBh ship had no business there, and they had no fear of the Sultan. I endeavoured to ascertain whether this place was really Khadara, and who and where the Headman was. They said they had no Headman, and refused to answer any more questions. I then thought it expedient to conclude the interview, and returned to the ship without having mentioned the real object of our visit. 6 . Wishing to make certain that I had been to the right place, I then proceeded to Al Khabura, 17 miles further west, the name being somewhat similar to Khadara. Here I found a thriving community of fifty to sixty British Indian subjects who were delighted to see the ship. They welcomed me on the beach with a salute of three guns fired from an ancient small piece of ordnance. The wad of the third round fired as I stepped ashore was, incidentally, unpleasantly close to my helmet. They told me they were very well treated by the Wall and Sheikh, with whom their relations were very cordial, and they requested me to thank these gentlemen on their behalf, and to express the hope that the happy relations would continue. I saw the Wali and Sheikh before leaving. I learnt that Khad r ra is the general name of the villages around Al Khadhra, and that the people theie were of evil icpute. Also that Somalis are in the habit of frequenting Al Khadhra on the way up and down the Gulf in the date season, and that they purchase and ship dates from there. No Somalis ever come to Al Khabura. 7. This information confirmed thcit I held been to the lignt place, and my suspicioiis that the reason for the offensive attitude of the Al Khadhra people was that they correctly guessed the object of our visit was in connection with Somali arms, which aie probably there on shore. There were no native craft at Al Khadhra. 8 . I then returned to Muscat, arriving here at ft a.m., the 20th. 1 told Captain Scott I.M.S., Acting Consul, what had happened, and he has communicated with you I also went with Captain Scott and interviewed His Highness the Sultan with regard to the Al Khadhra incident, directing him to investigate the case, and, if possible, punish the chief offenders, and he suggested that I should convey the letter in the 9 . I wculd suggest that some action to enforce respect for our flag is desirable, but as the Sultan’s authority over these people appears to be only nominal, the question appears to be rather a difficult one, and I shall be glad to know what action you ^0 I have briefly reported to my Commander-in-chief that I met with a hostile reception from the people of Al Khadhra, and that you have been communicated with. 11 I do not consider that any further steps with regard to the capture of Somali arms that may be at Al Khadhra or Sur can he taken by me so long as they remain ashore. At the former place, I certainly think they could only be obtained by force, hut I should not think that this would be countenanced. , „ Q r It may perhaps be possible to do something when the arms are shipped for Somali land, if reliable and early information can be obtained as to the time and place of loading, and, if possible, the names of the vessels.

(Confidential.) Sir, &lt;£ Sphinx,” at Muscat, September 23, 1907. IN accordance with the request conveyed in your letter to me of the 25th instant, I have the honour to inform you that I sailed from Muscat at 5-30 a.m. the 26th September, and arrived at As Suwaik at 1 p.m. that day. I landed and was received by the Wali to whom I delivered the letter from His Highness the Sultan. I embarked the Wali and four of his men, and proceeded to A1 Khadra, arrivino 1 there at 3'30 p.m. Having made arrangements for the event of an actively hostile reception, I landed with the Wali. We found the village practically deserted, only about half a dozen men and several women and children being visible. I saw no Somalis. One of the men, an Arab, I recognized as having been one of the principal offenders on the last occasion. His former companions had apparently considered it wise to keep out of the way. This man, named Oubayed-bin-Hamed, immediately accosted the Wali, and used similar expressions to those I had previously been favoured with. He seized the Wali by the sleeve and fiercely demanded why he had brought us there again, we had no business there, clear out, &amp;c. I was surprised that the Wali allowed the man to talk to him in this manner, and I formed the conclusion that his authority could not be very great. I asked the Wali who the Headman was. He said that there was none, but the people were under the Sheikhs of the neighbouring villages, whom he had sent for. Those^ gentlemen arrived, after some delay, with several of their people. 1 lie Sultan’s letter was read to the assembly, and I demanded the production of the chief offenders and the Somali arms. The Sheikhs said they did not know the men I described, and knew nothing of the arms or any Somalis. They also said that nobody lived in this village, and the people who had insulted us must have been strangers. I told them that I could not accept this explanation, in view of the large number of houses (mat huts), women, and children, which was out of all proportion to the small number of men now in the village. . arms, they pressed me to search the village and two bedans at anchor. Ibis offer I did not accept, as their anxiety that I should do so, in order to confirm eir denial that arms were there, indicated that it would only result in waste of time, and the sun was getting low. sJ '^SSs£-:I found that the A\ ali, instead of talcing an active part in the investigation, was inclined to side with the Sheikhs and people on the defensive, and wished to put the onus on me. I told them that one man among them, Oubayed-bin-Hamed could sav, if he chose, who the men were, and probably where the arms are. I explained that incivility and threats to British officers and denial of the Sultan’s authority could not be lightly passed over and terminate with polite phrases and doubtful explanations. Also that the exportation of arms t r Somaliland with which the A1 Khadra / people were implicated was forbidden. Some one must be punished, with a view to r. preventing such occurrences in future. As neither the Wall or the Sheikhs could produce the chief offenders, I insisted on the arrest of the only man present I was able to identify. I offered to request the Sultan’s pardon for this man if he would name the others, and give any reliable information as to the present location of the Somali arms. After considerable pleading by the Wali and Sheikhs on behalf of Oubayed-bin- Hamed, the Wali finding that I would not yield arrested the man, and I returned to the ship with the Wali and his prisoner at sunset and conveyed them to Suwaik. The Wali will keep the man in confinement there pending the Sultan’s pleasure. Perhaps on reflection the man will avail himself of my offer referred to above. I inclose a letter from the Wali of Suwaik to His Highness the Sultan. 2 . I trust that my action will meet with approval. I considered it expedient both to advance British prestige and the Sultan’s authority, as well as to strengthen the hand of the Wali, which appeared to be capable of a little development. 3. No further action to vindicate British prestige is in my opinion necessary. The villagers are evidently frightened, and I think the arrest of Oubayed impressed both the Wali and the Sheikhs, and will have a beneficial result on the manners of the people. 4. As regards the capture of the Somali arms, my future action must await further information, as 1 think it doubtful that the arms are now in the particular village of Khadara I visited. I would venture to suggest that steps might be taken to stop the export of the arms from Muscat and Muttra by the arrest of the agents on shore at those places. I have, &amp;c.

He wishes to make an enquiry into what he has heard of arms having been taken to Khaderah for the Somalis. He desires to have them seized. If you find them seize them for I forbade them for the Somalis. Ask the Shaikhs why they did not allow the Captain to move about freely. If that was the work of immature youths it is necessary they should be imprisoned. Tell the Shaikhs that such a thing should not occur again. It is necessary that when they (the man of-war people) land they should be received with due respect and salaam. FEYSAL.CONFIDENTIAL. H.M.S. 'Sphinx' at Muscat. 20th September 1907. I S.N.O. 70/07. Sir, In accordance with the request conveyed in your letter to mo of 25fch instant, I have the honour to inform you that I sailed from Muscat at 5.30 a.m. September 36th and arrived at As Suwaik at 1.0 p.m. that day. I landed and was received by the Wali to whom I delivered the letter from H.H. the Sultan. I embarked the Wali and 4 of his men and proceeded to A 1 Khadhra, arriving there at 3.30 p.m. Having made arrangements for the event of an actively hostile reception I landed with the Wali. Wo found the village practically deserted - only about half a dozen men and several women and children being visible. I saw no Somalis. One of the men, an Arab, I recognised as having boon one of the principal offenders on the last occasion. His former companions had apparently considered it wise to keep out of the way. This man, named Oubayod bin Hamed, immediately accosted the Wali and used similar expressions to those I had previously boon favoured with. Ho seized the Wali by the sleeve and fiercely demanded why he had brought us there again, wo had no business there, clear, out, etc.. 1 - Captain N. Scott, I.M.S., Acting Consul, at MUSCAT.I was surprised that the Wali allowed the man to talk to him in this manner, and I formed the conclusion that his authority could not bo very groat. I asked the Wali who the head man was. He said that there was none, but the people were under the Sheikhs of the neighbouring villages whom he had sent for. These gentlemen arrived, after some delay, with several of their people. The Sultan’s letter was road to the assembly and I demanded the production of the chief offenders arid the Somali arms. The Sheikhs said they did not know the men I described and knew nothing of the arms or any Somalis. They also said that nobody lived in this village and the people who had insulted us must have been strangers. I told them that I could not accept this explanation in view of the large number of houses, (mat huts), women anc children which was out of all proportion to the small number of men now in the village. As to the arms, they pressed mo to search the village and two bedans at anchor. This offer I didnot accept as their anxiety that I should do so in order to confirm their denial that arms were there indicated that it would only result in waste of time, and the sun was getting low. I found that the Wali instead of taking an active part in the investigation was inclined to side with the Sheikhs and people on the defensive, and wished to put the onus on me. I told them that one man among them, Oubayed Bin Hamed could say, if ho chose, who the men were and probably where the arms are. I explained that incivility andand threats to British Officers and denial of the Sultan’s Authority oould not bo lightly passed over and terminate with polite phrases and doubtful explanations. Also that the exportation of arms to Somaliland with which the A1 Khadhra people were implicated was forbidden. Someone must be punished with a view to preventing such occurrences in future. As neither the Wali or the Sheikhs could produce the chief offenders I insisted on the arrest of the only man present I was able to identify. I offered to request the Sultan’s pardon for this man if he would name the others and give any reliable information as to the present location of the Somali anas. After considerable pleading by the Wali and Sheikhs on behalf of Oubayod bin Earned, the Wali finding that I would not yield arrested the man and I returned to the ship with the Wali and his prisoner at sunset and conveyed them to Suwaik. The Wali will keep the man in confine ment there pending the Sultan’s pleasure. Perhaps on reflection the man will avail himself of my offer referred to above. I enclose a letter from the Wali of Suwaik to H.H. the Sultan. 2 . - I trust that my action will meet with approval. I considered it expedient both to advance British prestige and the Sultan’s authority as well as to strengthen the hand of the Wali which appeared to bo capable of a little development. 3. - No further action to vindicate British prestige is in my opinion necessary. The villagers are evidently frightened£ r * frightoned and I think the arrest of Oubayed impressed both the Wali and the Sheikhs, and will have a beneficial result on the manners of the people. As regards the capture of the Somali arms, my future action must await further information as I think it doubtful that the arms are now in the particular village of Khadara I visited. I would venture to suggest that steps might be taken to stop the export of the arms from Muscat and Mittra by the arrest of the agents on shore at those places. I have, etc...

To The Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLET, O.M., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 5th September 1907. Sir, We have the honour to refer to your predecessor’s Secret despatch No. 81, dated 27th October 1905, in which the Government of India were requested to furnish their views on suggestions made by the Senior Naval Officer, Aden Division, as to the class of vessel to be employed in repressing piracy in unsurveyed waters in the Red Sea, and as to the issue of licenses to British-owned vessels to carry arms for defensive purposes. We have not hitherto replied to this communication as the subject was closely connected with the Aden Sea Traffic in Arms Regulation, which is still under considera tion. It appears, however, to be desirable to acquaint you with our views upon the general questions raised without further delay. 2. Captain Eustace recommended that, in view of the expense and risk of employing modern ships to cruise amongst the reefs and unsurveyed waters of Turkish Arabia, wood or composite vessels of from 10'—12' draught and manned by native crews should be utilised for the purpose. As an alternative proposition, Captain Eustace suggested that all British- owned vessels should be licensed to carry a limited number of Martini-Henry rifles for their own protection, subject to registration, and that the ammunition required by the licensees should be supplied by Government at cost price. 3. Prom t^be'correspondence* with the Government of Bombay, of which * 1 Letter to the Chief Secretary to the Govern- R COpy is enclosed, yOU Will See that His Excellency the Governor in Council concurs in the conclusion arrived at by the Political Resident, Aden, that a service of armed dhows, supervised and controlled by an armed steam-vessel, is required for the purpose of repressing piracy in the Red Sea. 4 . We understand, however, from a letter No. M.— 0197 , dated 20th March 1907 , addressed by the Lords of the Admiralty to the Naval Commander-in- Chief, that, pending further instructions, armed dhows are not to be employed for the capture of pirates in the Persian Gulf. Before making any recom mendation on the subject of the Political Resident’s proposals, we would enquire whether the objections that are held to apply to the use of armed dhows in the Persian Gulf, would apply also to their use in the Red Sea. We also Tide His Excellency’s letter No. 920, dated the note that Admiral Drury in 1903 ap- 26th April i9o3, copy enclosed. parently considered the employment of dhows in the Gulf of Aden for the suppression of the arms traffic to have been unsatisfactory. ment of Bombay, No. 4674 E.-B., dated the 16th December 1905. 2. Letter from the Acting Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, No. 1477, dated the 23rd February 1906.5. We see no objection on general grounds to permitting Britisli-owned vessels to carry a limited number of Martini-Henry rifles for their own protec tion, provided that the rifles are registered. The registration would be carried out under the Aden Arms (Sea Traffic) Regulation and a clause (draft clause 12) , , dealing with the subject has been inserted vide copy of correspondence enclosed. ^ in the amended draft of the Regulation which is at present under discussion with the Bombay Government. We propose to submit for your approval in due course a draft of the revised Regulation, - T ,. « since we understand* that it is regarded • Letter from the Foreign Omce to the Colonial -r, . r • ° Office, dated the isth January 1907 . by the x! oreign Oflice as forming a useful Vide Article VIII of the Tripartite Agreement of basis for the local discussions that are 13th December 1906. jxt -i to take place between international representatives in order to frame regulations for the suppression of the arms trade in the Red Sea. 6. If it is ultimately decided to permit British-owned vessels to carry a limited number of rifles for their protection, we see no reason why the owners should not be allowed to purchase a strictly limited quantity of ammunition from Government annually, for each registered rifle. 7. The presence of the three Turkish gunboats of which the arrival in the Red Sea was reported in March 1906 does not appear to have produced a deterrent effect upon the pirates, since, as you are aware, the dhow “ Johara ” + Vide papers sent with Foreign Secretary’s weekly Was attUCked'j* and looted by pirates within letter is’o. is m., dated the 2 nd May 1907 .

In reply to your confidential letter No. 675-E. of the 16th instant, be pleased to inform His Excellency the Viceroy in Council that I consider that the Agreement made with the Sheikh of Bahrein in 1861 to abstain from any act of aggression or retaliation by sea should still be adhered to, as, if it was cancelled, complications might easily arise. 2. I would first desire to point out that in my opinion the results achieved by the use of armed dhows in the Gulf of Aden have not been as great a success as is generally supposed, and it is a very demoralising service for officers and men. 3. The best course appears to me to be that I should be informed every year when the pearl fishery is to begin and end, and I would then endeavour to arrange for a gun-boat to police those waters during the time the fishery was being carried out. 4. If it is decided that an armed dhow is necessary, I am of opinion that she should be commanded by a Royal Indian Marine officer who would require a commission from the Admiralty; the vessel would fly the white ensign and be under the orders of the Naval Commander-in-Chief on this station, and be a tender to the Senior Naval Officer’s ship in the Persian Gulf. She might be provided and maintained by the Sheikh of Bahrein and partly manned by his subjects, as his interests are primarily affected, but he could have absolutely no control over her movements and actions on the high seas. 5. With regard to paragraph 3 of your letter, the Consul-General at Berbera has recently bought and equipped two armed dhows, and could give you all details, so as to enable an estimate of the cost of one to be arrived at. As far as I am aware, they have each one 3-pounder quick-firing gun. Two Europeans, one as Captain and one as Mate. The Captain receives £120 a year. The services of his dhows are confined to the territorial waters of British Somaliland. 6. The dhows recently employed by the Royal Navy in the Gulf of Aden for the suppression of the arms traffic were hired by us at the rate of Rs. 225 a month, which included the services of the native crew. The guns, fittings, etc., were supplied by the ships to which the dhows were attached. t V G. C. Press, Simla.-No. S-S66 F. D.-27-8-07-14r-J.

I am to say that the letters referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Resident s report deal directly with the arms traffic in the Gulf of Aden and will shortly be separately submitted. 3. His Excellency the .Governor in Council sees no reason to dissent from the views expressed as to the class of vessel most suitable for service of the character of that on woich Captain Eustace was recently employed. His Excel lency is entirely in favour of makinga supply of arms, which British authori ties can license and control, available at Aden at rates which will compete in popularity with the uncontrolled supply placed on the market at Jibouti. Ibis proposal is definitely made m my No. Id76, dated the 23rd February 1906 and the question of licensing and registering arms on board British-owned vessels is being further considered. His Excellency the Governor in Council regre s that there seems little prospect of securing the co-operation which the Resident at the close of paragraph 3 of his letter holds to be necessary.

With reference to the papers of which a copy has been forwarded to me for report with your No. 8316, dated 22nd December 1905, I have the honour to invite reference to this office letter No. 265, dated 14th January 1906, which, with its accompaniments and previous letters on the same subject, would appear to furnish all necessary information on the subject. . ^ concur with Captain Eustace’s views as to the class of vessels to be used m repressing piracy in unsurveyed waters. But I am of opinion that it is de sirable that a service of armed dhows should be supplemented for purposes of supervision and general control by a steam vessel of not less than 12 knot speed and of shallow draft. The steamer should be armed with a three-pounder Hotchkiss and a Maxim, and the general details of its establishment and up keep appear from Appendix D attached to my letter above referred to. . -A- 8 the issue of licenses to British-owned vessels to carry arms, I have | m my letter under reference and in my previous letter No. 6630, dated 29th October 1905, expressed my concurrence with this proposal. And I would here only again remark that for this to constitute any really effective check upon the illicit arms ^traffic the hearty co-operation of all other powers and authorities concerned is^ necessary. The number of arms allowed to be carried should of course be strictly limited in quantity. G. C. Press. Simla-No. C -231 F.

QUIN, Esq., ACTING SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of BOMBAY, Political Department. Fart William,, the 8th February 1907. Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of Sir Steyning W. Edgerley’s No. 2149 , dated the 19th March 1906. letters marginally noted regarding the No. 2676 ,, sth Apni 1906. proposed amendment of the Aden Sea Traffic in Arms Regulation, 1902, and on the subject of the stopping and searching of dhows flying Turkish colours in British protected waters. 2. In reply, I am directed to say, with reference to paragraph 6 of the first letter, and paragraph 2 of the second, that the Government of India desire to examine further the practicability of applying the Indian Arms Act to the Protectorate in the manner suggested in Eoreign Department letter No, 935 E.-B., dated the 27th Eebruary 1906, and they therefore think it advisable to defer consideration of the question of embodying in the Regulation, provisions for the guidance of officers similar to those to be found in Part III Cf the Somaliland Regulation. If the Indian Arms Act were applied, it might be found possible to secure the object desired by the issue of executive instructions to^the Commanders of vessels concerned. 3. I am to forward herewith a revised draft Notification giving effect to the other suggestions contained in the letter of the 19th March. The only provision in this draft to which it seems necessary to call special attention is the new clause 12 giving power to make rules concerning the carrying of arms for purposes of defence on Native vessels. The draft follows the wording of the suggestions put forward by the Government of Bombay, but it would appear to be desirable that more precise phraseology should be used to describe the subject-matter of the rules, and I am to suggest that a revised draft of the clause should be forwarded for the approval of the Government of India. The term “ Native vessels ” appears to require definition or expansion, while the meaning of the term “ British protected Ports ” is perhaps not entirely clear. As, if these rules are to have any binding effect, it is necessary that they should be enforced by penalties, words have been added to clause 12 empower ing the Resident to prescribe penalties for a breach of the rules. The amount o the penalties should be fixed by the Bombay Government. Provision has a so been made in sub-clause (2) for the publication of the rules.2 4. With reference to the suggestion in paragraph 3 of the letter of the 19th March, that the provision requiring a bond to he executed before the grant of a port clearance should he omitted, the Government of Bombay doubtless realise that this omission will weaken the force of the Begulation very consi derably so far as vessels proceeding/rom Aden are concerned, as the penalties imposed by clauses 7 and 8 of the draft can only be enforced when the owner or master of the vessel in question is at Aden. At present, in such cases, action can be taken under the bond against the sureties resident in Aden, but in future, so long as the owner and master of offending vessels absent them selves from Aden, Government will not be able to punish them in any way, for the regulation can only apply to the territory to which the provisions of the Government of India Act 1870, under which it is framed, have been made applicable, i.e., the settlement of Aden. The Government of India will be glad to be furnished with the views of His Excellency the Governor in Council on the subject of the revised draft. 5. I am to add with reference to paragraph 8 of the letter of the 19th March 1906, and paragraph 3 of the letter ot the 6th April 1906, that the Government of India are disposed to agree with the Government of Bombay that the acquiescence of the Protectorate Chiefs in any action which the Government of India may desire to take may be held to follow naturally from their signature of the Protectorate Treaties. The suggestion that special agree ments should be concluded with them will, however, be further considered in connection with the proposed application of the Indian Arms Act to the Protectorate.

Ten months ago while I was on leave in India an emissary of the Somaliland Mullah is said to have arrived in Maskat with Rs. 15,000 to buy arms.

While I was present the Eumaidis and Earnai bought 53 boxes of Le Gras ammunition at 0 65 per box of 1200 rounds. The Akrabi purchased 3 boxes. The Hum&amp;ida and Mamai also bought a French rifle each. They shipped this ammunition, etc., in a buggalow belonging to a Sahari agreeing to pay Bs. 60/- for its transport to Bas-al-Arah. The buggalow was to have sailed yesterday but the wind was too strong. The Humaida asked what I was doing there, I said I had taken 8 days' leave and had come to buy a rifle.

Aden, Before, me, (Sd) A. H. E. Mosse, Captain, 11-3-1907. Assistant Resident.M No. 6275, dated the 12th October 1904 From—C Acting 1 Secretary to the Government of H. A. Hill, Esq., C.I.E., Bombay, Political Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I am directed to state that, in connection with the seizure of a dhow with arms and ammunition at Mokalla, an incident reported to the Government of * See also letter No. 180-P., dated the nth August India in this Department letter * o. 2856, 1904 , from the Government of Bombay. dated the 29th April 1904, the Political Resident, Aden, has drawn attention to the fact that the Aden Sea-traffic in Arms Regulation, III of 1902, is defective, and that the penalties prescribed therein are insufficient to act as a deterrent. 2. The Regulation was enacted to prevent illicit traffic in arms and ammunition, and with this view certain restrictions were imposed upon the movements of (1) vessels proceeding/mw Jden to any place on the African and Arabian Coasts of the Gulf of Aden, and (2) vessels proceeding to Aden from any such place. The imposition of these restrictions made it necessary that the acts, which vessels proceeding from, Aden should do or refrain from doing, should be as fully described as those which vessels proceeding to Aden should do or refrain from doing; and that all the offences, corresponding to the said performance or non-performance of acts, for which the owners and masters of vessels proceeding from Aden are liable to punishment, should also be clearly specified in the same way as otfences for which owners and masters of vessels proceeding to Aden may be punished. Section 3, however, of the Regulation, which prescribes the conditions to be fulfilled, refers only to vessels departing or proceeding from Aden, while section 4, which imposes penalties, deals mainly with vessels arriving at Aden. 3. In dealing with the particular seizure alluded to, the Political Resident experienced no little difficulty in deciding under which section of the Regula tion the accused could be charged. The offence was that of touching at ports other than those specified in the port-clearance, and of carrying arms and ammunition; that is to say, it was a violation of the conditions referred to in clause 3 of section 3 of the Regulation. Section 4, however, provides no penalties for such offences when committed by vessels departing from Aden. Having regard to the intention of the legislature, it was necessary for the Resident to bring the case within the purview of the Regulation. By adopting the view that a port-clearance was as much a port-clearance for the port of departure as for the port of destination, the Political Resident, Aden, held that the case was covered by sub-section (i) of section 4 of the Regulation, inasmuch as the vessel having touched at ports not specified in the port- clearance, practically sailed without, a port*clearance for those ports. Each of the accused in the case was punished with a fine and with imprisonment according to the measure of his guilt, and the enforcement was ordered of a bond entered into by the Nakhoda of the dhow, whereby he had rendered himself liable to a penalty of Rs. 900, if, after leaving Aden, he did not proceed to the port to which he was bound without touching at any other port, or if he allowed his vessel to be employed in carrying arms, etc., from any port or place on the Arabian Coast to any port or place on the African Coast in the Gulf of Aden. The fines inflicted, as well as the penalty of the bond, were recovered from the proceeds of the sale of the dhow s cargo, which was confiscated. 4 The view taken by the Political Resident that the case was covered by sab-section (I) of section 4 of the Eegulation is apparently an unjustfiable strainin 0 * of the real meaning of that sub-section. The only obligation placed on vessels departing Jrom Aden and not subsequently arrmng m that port is the possession of a port-clearance, which is only granted under certain condr- lions as shown in section 3 of the Eegulation. The absence of such a port- clearance is an offence under section 4 (1), but this appears to be the only 0 ffence that could he committed in the ease of a vessel leaving Aden and not 4772 F. D.2 subsequently arriving in A.den, although in certain circumstances the sum named in the bond, which is a condition of the grant of the port-clearance, may be forfeited. In the present case nothing more could apparently have been done than forfeit the Rs. 900 for which the Nakhoda had bound himself, and even that amount could not be recovered by distress and sale, since that remedy is limited to the recovery of fines under section 5 { 1 ) of the Regulation. The Political Resident’s order in the case is, however, final under sections 17 and 29 of Act II of 1864, and the point need not perhaps be considered further. 5. In disposing of the case as he did, the Political Resident could take no cognizance of the more serious offence of carrying arms, etc. Had it not been for this defect in the Regulation, the accused could have been convicted of this offence also, and in addition to the punishment prescribed by section 4, the dhow could, under sub-section (2) of section 5, have been confiscated. As matters stand, this vessel is merely detained under sub-section (7) of section 5 of the Regulation, and orders are awaited by the Political Resident as to its disposal. This Government are not aware of any authority under which they can order its confiscation. 6. In section 4 of the Regulation, the words “carried arms Aden” pertain to sub-section (4), but as printed they would seem to apply to all the sub-sections, though this apparently is a mistake. In regard to the fine and term of imprisonment prescribed in this section, I am to observe that it appears necessary that a distinction should be made between a minor offence, such as the departure of a vessel without a port-clearance or written permission and the more serious offence of conveying arms, ammunition, military stores, and explosives. Por the former the punishment at present prescribed seems sufficient, but for the latter a heavier fine and longer term of imprisonment might, in the opinion of this Government, be imposed in addition to the conffscation of the dhow. &lt; ✓ 1 7. With a view to remedy the defects brought to notice His Excellency the Governor of Bombay in Council would suggest that the Regulation should be amended as shown in the accompanying draft, which I am to submit for the consideration of the Government of India. If its provisions meet with general approval, the Governor in Council proposes to refer it to the Resident at Aden for remarks as to detail. Dratt. Whereas it is expedient to amend the Aden Sea-traffic in Arms Regula tion, 1902, in manner hereinafter appearing; it is hereby enacted as follows'— 1.

(2) The master and the owner— (a) of any vessel arriving in Aden from any place on the Arabian Coast of the Gulf of Aden, which, before leaving the said place for Aden, or (5) of any vessel which, after departing or proceeding from Aden on a voyage to any place on the African Coast of the Gulf of Aden, has within the period of one year, or where port-clearance has been granted under section 3, sub-section (1), within such period, then since the grant of such port-clearance, carried arms, ammunition, military stores or explosives between any places on the Arabian and African Coasts of the Gulf of Aden, shall, on conviction before a Magistrate, be punishable with fine which may extend to rupees, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to , or with both. 2. In section 5, sub-section (2) of the said Eegulation, for the figure “(4)” the figure “ t2) ” shall be inserted. No. 1535-E.B., dated Simla, the 24th April 1905. From—The Assistant Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To—The Hon’ble Me. S. W. Edgerley, C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Hill’s letter No. 6275, dated the 12th October 1904, proposing certain amendments in the Aden Sea Traffic in Arms Begulation, 1902. 2. In reply, I am to say that the Government of India are disposed to approve the principle of the suggested amendments, which they understand are not to be considered as definitive, pending the receipt of a further communi cation which His Excellency in Council intends to lay before the Government of India, after consulting the Resident at Aden as to the details of the proposals 3. I am at the same time to suggest, for the consideration of the Bombay Government, that it might be advisable to extend the scope of the existing Biegulation even further than appears to be contemplated by His Excellency in Council. The object with which the Begulation was enacted was primarily to afford to the British Somali Coast a certain measure of proteotion from illicit import of munitions of war. In the instance which has given^ rise to the present proposals of the Bombay Government, the carriage of arms is understood to have been from one port to another on the Arabian Coast, and whether, in the particular case, the illicit cargo was eventually destined for the Somali Coast, or for the interior of the Aden Protectorate, it is a question whether the traffic in arms on the Arabian littoral does not require more direct attention than it received when the Begulation was drafted in 1902. 4 An amended draft Begulation has been tentatively prepared, embodying provisions in the sense of the loregoing observations, for the consideration4 of the Bombay Government. As soon as the Government of India hare been furnished with the views of His Excellency in Council, the question of its issue will he taken into consideration, and the final wishes of the Government of India communicated to you. The opportunity has also been taken to make provision, which may allow of full advantage being taken of any arrangements, for further control of the arms traffic, which it may here after be found practicable to make with the several Chiefs or tribes of the Arabian Coast, or with the authorities of the. Erench or Italian Protectorates on the southern side of the Gulf. The Trucial Chiefs of the Persian Gulf littoral are bound by Treaties of 1820 and 1902 to observe certain formalities in regard to port clearances, and also to prohibit all traffic in arms. It has been suggested that it might be found possible to conclude similar agree ments with the maritime Chiefs of the Aden Protectorate, and that it might even be possible to induce them to accept a system of bonds similar to that provided for in the Regulation. Such on arrangement would have a double anvantage in that it would not only assist to strengthen control over the arms traffic, but would also provide a more or less uniform procedure at all ports of the Protectorate, and thus tend to prevent diversion of trade which might result from the enforcement at Aden alone of measures which would naturally he obnoxious to all who at present combine a trade in arms with a legitimate commerce in other goods. Should such an arrangement at any time be concluded, or should any analogous agreement be come to regard- * vide correspondence ending with the endorse- tlie Erench or Italian Protectorate, ment from the Government of India in the Foreign aS the TBSUlt of the negotiations * which are Department, No. 882-E.B., dated the 1st March now i n progress, it WOUld then be possible to apply to other portions of the coast line of the Gulf of Aden a scheme similar to that now in force in respect of the British Somali Protectorate. It has also been thought advisable to introduce provision (vide section 9) for the transport of arms under proper license issued either by authority of the Aden Administration or [clause (b)J by any officer of the Briiish Somali Protectorate or of a Foreign State, who may be recognised as competent in this behalf. 5. With reference to the particular case which has given rise to the present proposals of the Bombay Government, I am to say that the Govern ment of India agree with the Governor in Council that the conviction was wrong in law. The recovery of the fine and of the amount of the bond by sale of the cargo was also incorrect.

HI of 1902. Repeal. 14. The Aden Sea-traffic in Arms Regulation, 1902, is hereby repealed.No. 2149, dated Bombay Castle, the 19th March 1906. ; From—The Hon’ble Sir S. W. Edqerlet, K.C.V.O., C.I.E., Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I am directed to reply to Mr. Somers Cock’s letter No. 1535-E.B., dated the 24th April 1905, on the subject of the proposed amendment of the Aden Sea Traffic in Arms Regulation, 1902, 2. The amendments proposed by the Government of India have been carefully considered and are, in the opinion of His Excellency the Governor in Council, generally desirable. I am to offer the following observations on the Regulation as amended thereby. 3. In paragraph 26 of his No. 265, dated the 14th January 1906, forwarded with my No.^1805, dated the 5th March 1906, the Resident expresses the fear that the effect of enforcing the provisions of section 7 is to make Aden an unpopular port for native craft, and as the local authorities of the French and Italian Governments on the Red Sea littoral show a disinclination to co operate fully in similar measures for the suppression of the arms traffic in the Gulf of Aden, His Excellency is inclined to agree with the Resident that this provision had better be dropped. In his opinion it will go far to defeat the objects of the Regulation if native boats avoid Aden, as all registration and the success of the provisions as to port clearance, and as to selected and pres cribed ports depend on the periodical visit to Aden, and while these provisions still remain operative the provisions of section 7 can perhaps be foregone. 4. I am to point out that the new Regulation omits any provision similar to that provided in section 4 (3) of the old Regulation. It appears to His Excellency desirable to provide that boats should, subject to stress of weather, go direct to the places for which they take out a port clearance. 5. The necessity for the change of the phrase “ any places in the Gulf of Aden ” to “ any places on the coast line on the Guff of Aden is not apparent, and though the matter is not of great importance, I am to say that uniformity of expression throughout the Regulation seems desirable. 6. I am to invite attention to the copy of the Somaliland Regulation and to the other accompaniments to the Resident’s letter No. 265, da e e 14th January 1906, forwarded with my letter No. 1805, dated the 5th March 1906. It will be seen from paragraph 14 of appendix D that Lord Lansdowne has cancelled paragraph VII of the Somaliland Regulation which seemed to be of the same tenour as that of paragraph 3 of Foreign Department letter No. 108*E.A., dated the 13th January 1902 , exempting vessels flying the French flag from search. I am to suggest for consideration, with reference to your No^935-E.B., dated the 27 th February 1906, that this Regulatimi would be a suitable place in which to provide provisions for the guidance of officers on the spot similar to those to be found m Part III of the bonaaliland Regula tion, but with such modifications as the Government of Indl ^“ a ^f f e [®j laying down what right of stoppage and search of dhows entering the temtonal waters of the Aden Protectorate local officers may exercise and what powers of ultimate disposal of dhows or arms seized and other punishment of owners of dhows flying foreign colours and committing breaches of our Regulation local Courts may exercise. _ . . , 7 I am further to suggest that a clause might be added giving the Resident power to make, fubjeet to the control o£ the Goyernor of Bombay m Council, rules for marking, licensing and registering and depositing ai ms earned for purposes of defence on all native vessels trading from and to Ade “ from other British protected ports in the Gulf of Aden. Only native craft which comply with the conditions of the Brussels Convention, such as have papers!a y flag and some recognized authority to whom report can be made under that Convention for withdrawal of protection, should be recognized permitted to carry arms.8. As regards the suggestion that agreements might he concluded with the Maritime Chiefs of the Aden Protectorate similar to those concluded with the Trucial Chiefs of the Persian Gulf relative to the grant of port clearances and prohibition of the traffic in arms in their ports, I am to say that the Governor in Council agrees with the Government of India as to the advantages that might result from such arrangements if it be possible to make them. On receipt of the final orders of the Government of India steps will be taken to ascertain the willingness of the Chiefs concerned to enter into agreements of the kind referred to.

I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Somers Cocks’ letter No. 935-E.B., dated the 27th February 1906, relative to the stopping and searching of dhows flying Turkish colours in British protected waters. 2. I am to invite a reference to paragraph 6 of my letter No 2’ 49, dated the 19th March 1906, regarding the proposed amendment of the Aden Sea Traffc in Arms Regulation, 1902, and to suggest that the proposal therein made seems the simpler and less embarrassing procedure. 3. I am further to suggest that the acquiescence of the protectorate Chiefs in the attitude which the Government of India propose to assume might be held to follow naturally from their signature of the protectorate Treaties concluded with them. The powers have been exercised and without objection.No. 471 E.-B. Erom The ASSISTANT SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT or INDIA in the Foreign Department^ To H. O. QUIN, Esq., ACTING SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of BOMBAY, Political Department. Fort William, the 8 th February 1907. Sir, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of Sir Steyning W. Edgerley’s No. 2149 , dated the i9th March 1906 . letters marginally noted regarding the No. 2675 „ 8th April 1906 . proposed amendment of the Aden Sea Traffic in Arms Regulation, 1902, and on the subject of the stopping and searching of dhows flying Turkish colours in British protected waters. 2. In reply, I am directed to say, with reference to paragraph 6 of the first letter, and paragraph 2 of the second, that the Govemment of India desire to examine further the practicability of applying the Indian Arms Act to the .o ^ . *i i oa£* xr Protectorate in the manner suggested in » Pro. No. 73 in Secret E., April 1906, Nos. 6/-73. ,, . i. i * at tt t&gt; Eoreign Department letter* NoPOSS E.-B., dated the 27th February 1^06, and they therefore think it advisable to defer consideration of the question of embodying in the Regulation, provisions for the guidance of officers similar to those to be found in Part III of the Somaliland Regulation. If the Indian Arms Act were applied, it might be found possible to secure the object desired by the issue of executive instructions to the Commanders of vessels concerned. 3. I am to forward herewith a revised draft Notification giving effect to the other suggestions contained in the letter of the 19th March. The only provision in this draft to which it seems necessary to 'call special attention is the new clause 12 giving power to make rules concerning the carrying of arms for purposes of defence on Native vessels. The draft follows the wording of the suggestions put forward by the Government of Bombay, but it would appear to be desirable that more precise phraseology should be used to describe the subject-matter of the rules, and I am to suggest that a revised draft of the clause should be forwarded for the approval of the Government of India. The term “ Native vessels ” appears to require definition or expan sion, while the meaning of the term “ British protected Ports *’ is perhaps not entirely clear. As, if these rules are to have any binding effect, it is necessary that they should be enforced by penalties, words have been added to clause 12 empowering the Resident to prescribe penalties for a breach of the rules. The amount of the penalties should be fixed by the Bombay Government. Provision has also been made in sub-clause (2) for the publication of the rules. 4. With reference to the suggestion in paragraph 3 of the letter of the 19th March, that the provision requiring a bond to be executed before the grant of a port clearance should be omitted, the Government of Bombay2 doubtless realise that this omission will weaken the force of the Regulation very considerably so far as vessels proceeding /rom Aden are concerned, as the penalties imposed by clauses 7 and 8 of the draft can only be enforced when the owner or master of the vessel in question is at Aden. At present, in such cases, action can be taken under the bond against the sureties resident in .Aden, but in future, so long as the owner and master of offending vessels absent themselves from Aden, Government will not be able to punish them in any way, for the regulation can only apply to the territory to which the provisions of the Government of India Act 1870, under which it is framed, have been made applicable, i.e., the settlement of Aden. The Government of India will be glad to be furnished with the views of His Excellency the Governor in Council on the subject of the revised draft. 5. I am to add with reference to paragraph 8 of the letter of the 19th March 1906, and paragraph 3 of the letter of the 6th April 1906, that the Government of India are disposed to agree with the Government of Bombay that the acquiescence of the Protectorate Chiefs in any action which the Government of India may desire to take may be held to follow naturally from their signature of the Protectorate Treaties. The suggestion that special agree ments should he concluded with them will, however, be further considered in connection with the proposed application of the Indian Arms Act to the Protectorate.

Whil T st 1 a “ no 1 t inclined to attribute much importance to this intrigue, I would take the opportunity to suggest that it might be advisable for a special and a more reliable agent to be appointed to Aden bv the Colonial Office to watch the interests of the Somaliland Protectorate in'the affairs of which this Residency no longer exercises any control. This might prove the means of establishing closer and more intimate relations between this Residency and the authorities of that Protectorate than has existed since its transfer to the Colonial Office in 1893-99. And it should also tend to facilitate communi cation between the authorities of Eritish and Italian Somaliland. . 6 - Reverting to Captain Eustace’s despatch, I would remark that the Police examination to which native vessels are subjected on entering this Port is probably an effective deterrent to any actual passage of arms and ammuni tion through Aden, and that this is almost, if not entirely, restricted to the limits of the Protectorate. 7. Arms and ammunition continue to enter the Protectorate on the littoral lying to the west of Aden. And it is probable that a proportion of these find their way across country to Eastern Ports and thence down to Somaliland. It is probable that there is also some direct traffic to Eastern Ports from both Sur and Jibuti. 8. One of the wrecked dhows referred to in his despatch was examined at Aden and found to contain a cargo of palm leaves only. As to the four dhows from Sur, one of them arrived in a disabled condition and is still undergoing repairs on the Maala hards. And the dispute referred to appears to have been unimportant and to have arisen from some difficulty which was experienced in transferring her cargo to the other vessels. / 1 CON 2106—aList °f ^closures to accompany the Despatch to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, No. , dated the jj March 1907.

E UNDER SECRETARY OR STATE&gt; « ‘) 1 ** ■■ C1 1 ' IH !:! . Cl f/ v n w - H.M.S.'Pox' at Aden, 23rd OctolDerjigoe. Sir, I have ‘the honour to report upon the state of affairs in Somaliland, as follows:- Aodul Shaheri, the Mullah’s late representa tive at Aden, having lost favour with the Mullah (because of his Italian sympathies?) has been recalled, and for punishment is confined to the Mullah’s Camp near Illig. His place has been taken by Deria Rallah, of the Aden Madoba tribe, and a cousin of Haji Soudi, the ex-Naval Interpreter and the Mullah’s cheif adviser. Deria Rallah lives and eats with Aden Ali. Messrs Cowasjie Dinshaw’s head Stevedore - a Musa Awal of the Habr Tunis i.e. one of the tribes in the British Protectorate. This Aden Ali and De r ia Rallah are great friends, and every night drive to Maala, where the dhows anchor, and many natives collect in the coffee shops. The Mij j erteyns annually send four dhows to Sur for arms,ammunition etc., at the end of the S.W. Monsoon, which return to Africa with the first of the N.E.Monsoon. Apparently to forestall the Mijjerteyns, whom the Mullah recently raided - the Mujlah’s minister sent his two dhows ostensibly to Barren Island for guano but actually to Jibouti to buy arms for the Mullah, in going there one struck a ro ck off Mashah Island and be came a wreck. To obtain the anas they then had to be sent overland through the Ogadens. It seems probable that the escort sent for them by the Mullah raided the camelscamels they wanted, thus accounting for recent disturbances in the Hand. The four dhows from Sur, chartered by the Mullah, have quarrelled with his Agent and decline to leave Aden. It is reported that 17,000 rupees were offered to them to bring arms. The Italian Consul General, Cav .Pestalozzi , C.M.G., haying lost credit, has been removed, and his Assistant, the late Vice Consul is promoted to Consul. It was settled that he was to visit the Italian Somaliland Protectorate in the 'Agostino Barbarigo', in company with the Mullah's minister from Aden (Deria Ral lah) 'but about 21st October the Italian Government wired tnat he was not to land at Illig; thereupon the Mullah's minister declined to go, and the Italian Consular Interpreter also refused to land there, ssying it was too dangerous for him to go on shore in Somaliland. A new interpreter of the Hahr Awal near Berbera, has been engaged to land from the 'AGOSTINO BARBARIGO'. The Commander of the AGOSTINO BARBARIGO', Conte Clemente Ponte di Pino, told me he was going down the coast as far as Obbia, and would call at Bunda Bela, Illig and Obbia. They were towibig their two aimed dhows 'ANTELOPE' and 'GAZELLA' to Ras Alula, and he would return in ten deys, leaving the dhows to cruise off the N.Coast. In view of the hatred of Mijjerteyns for the Italians, this seems a dangerous thing to do. The authority of Italy in Somaliland, since they dare not land, is thus not even shadowy. The 'AGOSTINO BARBARIGO' with the two dhows, left Aden at 9 a.m., on 23rd October, but without their Consul. / Art A A-SO £ V Aden Ali has strongly urged Deria Rallah to advise the Mullah to request the British Government to send back General Swayne, and Pestalozzi, as being the best friends the Mullah has had. Also to ask that Captain Cordeaux may be recalled, as he is not friendly to the Mullah,etc. Apparently the Mullah finds little difficulty in obtaining all the news he wants from agents amongst ( our friendly tribes, and utilises Aden as a base from which his Minister, Deria Rallah, can work the supply of amis and ammunition for his raids.
