If however the Sherif is able to state definitely that more is required to replace the former Turkish subsidy that he received and that it is essential for the upkeep of the Holy Places and the pilgrimage we would be ready to meet his views on these lines and to give him additional money for these purposes. We think however that even for all these purposes £125,000 a month is somewhat large. If anything like this sum is given the Shereef should make most satis factory arrangements for the pilgrimage.

General effect of news of Shereef's revolt against Turks on public mind in Egypt is not easy to define. Islamic press has been very reticent and one portion avoids comment under pretence that news is doubtful while another minimises importance of the affair as being a phase in periodical Arab revolt trom which Turks will issue victors. -Among' lower classes some are incredulous while other including miaheen am artisan class and also fair sprinkling of Alazhar University express Pleasure at opportunity afforded to Arabs of enjoying the same progress in civilisation as Egyptians have done, by, .freedom from Turkish yoke. Anglophobe party do their best to discredit Shereef by callimg him a rebel (? against) the Caliph or servile instrument.of the English. Friendly enlightened circles agree that failure of shereef would have disastrous effecton tho Moslem world in general and that of Egypt in particular while his s &gt; -'ccess would mean mortal Plow to Turco German prestige, discredit from Islamic agitators and produce revolt in other Arab countries against Ottoman domination 0 On the whole news has been so far received with comparatively little interest or comment 0 Addressed to Foreign Office, Sent to India, Aden and Sirdar 531*[This Docnment is the Property of His .Britannic Majesty's GoTernment, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless K required for official use.] EGYPT DecyphtiN, Sir Ho McMahon (Mamleh) july 3rd,1916 No* 532. Following from SirdaJ* yesforday jb3« T legram from Simla June 29th notedo Failure of project to which Shereef is now commit Led would have serious consequences in India as elsewhere. under cover of general policy friendly to Aral aspirations, already proclaimed, it seems to me essential that Mis Majesty’s Government support Shereef by all means at their disposal* It seems to me that unless supposed Syrian revolt interferes with despatch south of Turkish reinforcements, crucial moment will arrive when Shereef is faced with possible re~ cpature of Medina and an advance on Mecca by Turks. He will have to choose then between accepting offer by us to despatch a military expedition and almost certain defeat* Turco-German propaganda have evidently secured consider- ablo hold in India and I hope His Majesty’s Government will redouble their efforts in counter propaganda of which Arab movement headed by Shereef is main plank in our platform.

(Addressed to Foreign, repeated to Secretary of State for India, High Commissioner, Cairo, and Political, Bombay.) 219 A.P. 23rd June. Referring to your telegram 312 S. dated 22nd June. I have impressed on Idrisi importance of hearty co-operation with other Arab chiefs against Turks, especially advisability of avoiding any action which might distract attention of the Shereef from our main objective in Syria, or ill-timed aggression against Imam. Idrisi’s move ments are naturally dependent upon Turkish dispositions and interference by us in details might have a bad effect. There are eight Turkish battalions on his southern border and three on his northern. It appears that Hashid Wa Bakil have been for a long time in close communication with Tdrisi. They wrote informing me of their enmity to the Turks and expressing desire for co-operation against them. It is to be expected that Imam is unlikely to support Turks if they are attacked by his own powerful tribes. They may bring Imam in with them. Idrisi writes that he hopes Imam will join him but that if he refuses to do so he must take his chance. There is no good reason for suspicion that Idrisi’s action is directed against Imam or Shereef.

From correspondence forwarded with my Political Secretary’s letter, dated 1st dime, your Government will have learned exact nature of agreements entered into with France and Russia regarding future Arab State. You are also aware of communications that have passed with Grand She reef. The three allied Governments are now committed to Arab independence and a pro-Arab policy. The far-reaching consequences of this policy, if it suceeds, in regard to Turkish claims to Pmpire and to the spiritual allegiance of Sunnis are obvious. 1 suggest you should impress on your officers, both those in Mesopotamia and those responsible for handling Moslem opinion in India, the importance of correctly understanding and promoting this policy, and should explain and commend it as may seem suitable in such Indian quarters as you may wish to influence. : ■ Previous Papers * 20663 I 668 1000 6/16my further commumca- ** on this subject, please quote No W&lt; /1916 md address— The Under-Secretary of State Foreign Office, London. r The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop Y of the under-mentioned paper.

I hear with great satisfaction of your plans for holding the Hedjaz wailway thus enabling Your Highness to seize the Hedjaz and to free it once anc for ever from Turkish control, I an convinced that this course is one of wisdom and will lead to far more sure results than any premature riding in Syria where, as you so rightly observe, the Syrians themselves are at oresent incapal le of effective co-operation. Moreover, such a revolt would require assistance from the Allied 'orces in the direction which you indicate, and an ope- ration of this nature involving questions of general military policy, must be subordinate to the larger plan of operations as decided upon by the Guoreme 'far Council of the Allies. It is therefore best at this stage of affairs to limit ope rations to those in which success can be ensured with the re sources at Your Highness* disposal. You2 .

I beg you to forward this to its destination quickly, and to acknowledge receipt by bearer. With many thanks to you.la u ae name ol God the T!erciful, the Compassionate, To T.E• -he High Commissioner the Great &amp; Illustrious ViZier. In ray last letter I submitted suggestions to Your Excellency of what I thought necessary to be done, and I am now waiting impatiently for compliance with the sugges tions I made, i.e. the necessity of stopping all supplies and munitions coming from the coast of Africa from reaching the Arabian coasts including the Hijaz and particularly t Jedda, for the reasons I had explained in my former letters. We have taken proceedings which have rendered our relations with the, usurpers (Turks) Strained. I. beg to bring • to the notice of your Excellency (what is not hidden from you) that to the usurpers the Hijaz # is of so much importance that they would prefer to lose the last soldier and the last dirhem against any force which desired to take away this country from them,and when they have information of our rise,^ they will diiec&lt;- against us. all their - powers and .will treat us as the worst ox their enemies. So we have done all that is in our po..er ..o destroy the railway line which connects Syria with the Hijaz so as to lay difficulties in their path, and to 's make the way very far for them and to increase the dis comforts of hot countries, so that we may find it easy,to meet them in a spot in which we are more able to endure the difficulties than they, and in this way we will flo away with their superiority except in the matter of guns. It will be absolutely necessary therefore tiat a sufficient number of British troops should ^ anQ venient point which it may be possible to reach, start from that point and occupy the railway line connecting Syria with Anatolia ao as to make it e.asy for our. friends in | Syria to rise up with their followers who expect relief to oome to them from the eyes of needles on account of their sufferings owing to the transgressions which are known to you. WereWere it not for the' eight Firkas (divisions) of- Turkish troops in those districts, they would have risen -and done their duties long ago. They are then unable to be the first to rise and the rising must start fror) here first, and as seon as we rise up we will lay hold on the railway line frotn Medina, and then advance gradually upon Syria. Then they (Syria) gill be able to rise up. • • * &lt; Please do not think that'we are unaware of the necessity of the destruction of the railway line, but in the way of precaution (we find that) the danger will be greater than the benefit. ; /^/ Moreover we find it necessary that the British troops should take up a point from which it would be easy to begin operations ,as we have already explained in order to seize i * the railway line, and this will facilitate the advance of the British troops on Irak and the advance of the Russian t’roopb from 'przrum towards Brzinjan. As a result of this movement the usurpers will be obliged to revert to their Western provinces'and above all it will $4 i prevent our Collision with the Russian troops. • ^Bnis is what we think necessary, and beg that you will notAeg. tb have carried out. Since this war started we had thought that this plan will he that of the Allies in the Tur- % kish theatre of war. This Bs why I could not understand they.have prererred to take operations in the Dardanelles^ j Yet it had all been written '(by God) We expect a speedy reply to this.

(21st April 1916) I have suggested to Your Excellency to hlockade completely the whole Yemen Coast and to stop all sorts of provisions and other necessaries from entering the Hijaz coast, and to cause all dhows to be searched, as I found this absolutely necessary to arrive at any serious or useful result whose effect would be general and not local. The enclosed will leave no need for further explanation. They are bound to come from Kunfuda to Jedda, and most probably by land and thence it will be by sea.

Sir, 1 1917 ! ref ereni^tjcftr With refbrenie^td- Aiy despatch No. 83 of April 19th, I have the honour to forward herewith copies o p two memoranda dealing, one with the Turkish opposition parties, and the other with certain proposals emanating from one of those parties. These papers complete the series, the first two papers of which relative to the Arab question v/ere transmitted in my despatch referred to above. It is hoped that a perusal of the® memoranda will enable a clear view to be obtained, not only of our situation vis-a-vis the Arab and Turkish questions se parately, but also of the close inter-relation of these two questions. * I have, etc., (Signed) A. H. McMahon• The Right Honourable Sir E. Grey, Bart., K.G., M.P., etc., etc., etc. etcTHE TURKISH QUESTION As viewed by the Turkish Parties opposed to t ' ae Conmittee of Union and Progress and the existing Government of Turkey. To this Memorandum is appended a note on the otu.io of peace which, there is good reason to believe tne Turkish Parties opposed to the Committee of Union and Progress are now prepared to discuss. It will be seen from the attached note, which merits careful consideration, that the Party of Prince Sabah ed-Din, having secretly been active in opposi tion since the commencement of the war, appears to con template coining into the open, armed with a pro gramme, and seeking to obtain recognition for itself as an alternative Government to that now existing in Turkey, with authority to treat in the name of Turkey and (it is to be assumed) in a position to bring about a coup d'goat in the Capital. Tne emergence of this party from comparative se clusion has had the effect of revivifying the only other party of any considerable standing, namely that of Colonel Sadik Bey. This latter, in addition to also producing a programme, has even intimated (a thing at one time not to he thought of) willingness to co-operate with the party of Prince ed-Din in a revolutionary movement. The incentives to action operating on both partiesparties are the same and obvious, namely 1. The spectacle of a powerful and increasing re action against the Committee of Union and Progress throughout Turkey. 2. The march of events (and chiefly the march of the Kussians) and the apparent approach of the mili tary downfall of Turkey. 3. As a result of (2), the probable dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire with every prospect of foreign occupation of parts of it. 4. The prominence now assumed by the Arab question and the attitude of the Entente Powers towards that question. This moves the Turkish parties to come forward before it is too late, with alternative and more attractive proposals. Such is the state of affairs (1) Turkish parties, / appealing to the Entente Powers in the name of a united opposition, desirous of peace and claiming to speak in the name of the Turkish Government ip .e.sge i and in posse, . (Note. In the absence of information about 11 their internal organization, it is impossible ^o jl compute the valu&amp;of tnis claim). (2) An Arab Party (and the very general treatment of the question of this paper will permit one Arab Party being spoken of as a whole) also appealing to the Entente Powers to assist them to shake off txieir yoke. It would be interesting in this connec tionm tlon to ascertain whether it is the Turkish yoke that the nrahs wish to cast off, or only that of the Com mittee; for history and experience do not encourage the belief that a large, and withal the purest sec tion, of the Moslem world, is prepared to-day to com mit its destinies to Christian Powers and to sever all connections with its co-religionists, unless no other alternative is possible. It may be objected, however, that these poinos are not relevant, and that there is no occasion to consider the actions of Turkish parties out of power and out of their own country. It is believed, however, that to adopt this au- titude is to ignore the following very important con siderations :- The Entente Powers are not yet in a position to dictate terms to the yurks or the Arabs, either col lectively or individually, and even should it be considered that our Arab negotiations have reached such a stage as to place us in that position, to ig nore the existence of the Turkish parties would be wilfully to rule out of the question factors, nou only of present, but of future importance. For, come what may, (!) we cannot blot out Turkey altogether from the map. (2) we cannot prevent Turkish parties attempting to gain the adhesion of the Arabs to their, rather than to our, offers. (3) Nor can we prevent the Arabs favourably con trasting these offers with ours to-:-v una (4) There is the possibility that, when the whole truth- '--i ot one Anglo-French agreement (if one has or “l- 1 ue conc luded) emerges, v;e may be faced with the ^rdbs preferring the Turkish offers to our own. The consideration of the second and third points v nrabs, is calculated to act as a deterrent to any active nrab co-operation to-day, which co-opera tion is far from being a negligible quantity; for, apart from the fact that a partial Arab rising, such ns is adumbrated by the oherif, would be a source of great political weakness and considerable military danger to the Teuto-Turks, an attitude even of mere benevolent neutrality towards us on the part of the Arabs has a direct influence on our military offen- While as regards the fourth point, the premature divul gence of any arrangement with France might even result in active Arab hostility, at any rate towards our Ally. In this connection, nothing can be more pertinent and instructive than the course of events in Tripoli during, end subsequent to, the Italo-Turkish war. At that time a Turkish Party, working in the interests of Arab Nationalism, connived with the Italians to drive the Turks (that is the Committee) out of Tripoli, only subsequently to offer every opposition to Italian progress and to further the cause of Tripoli for the Arabs. So much for the present considerations. As regards the future, even in the event of a settlementsettlement on the lines ol our proposals to the Sharif there is always the possibility that with ef fective, and in many cases unpalatable, foreign oc cupation O- parts of the Arab area, our good relations with the xirabs might be Jeopardised by an Arab and Turkish rapprochement. There are, therefore, argu ments which might well appeal to the Allies in favour of a solution which could be accepted by the Turkish parties and, at the same time, would not interfere with our existing engagements towards the Sherif and those parties who are working with him. It should be remembered that these engagements do not apply to any territory in which British interests are not para mount, nor to any territories in which Turkish parties are probably not prepared to consider a renunciation of Turkish claims. The crux of the question is to find a solution which the -Turks would accept both at once and with out reservation for the future, and which the French and the Russians would also agree to. The difficulties of finding a solution compatible with British interests appear in no way insurmountable, but the Interests of France and Russia, more especial ly if the question be treated on the lines suggested by Sir Mark Sykes, appear to raise more serious obstacles. No Turkish party is likely to accept terms which involve the loss of Constantinople, and the utmost which could be hoped for would be some arrangement by which Russia occupied, in Constantinople, a similar positionz. ^ 1 [CJr position to that occupied 'before the war, by England in Eg^^pt. The disposal of Siva.s, as foreshadowed by Sir Mark Sykes, would also be a serious stumbling block. The handing over to France of Armenian Asia Minor west of the Euphrates could only conceivably be made palatable if Turkish suzerainty were maintained un der French protection. In any case, whatever the settlement arrived at by the Entente Powers between themselves^in regard to Turkey proper and Syria, everything points to the advisability of keeping it from the Turkish and ^rab parties for the moment. The advance of the Russians in the Caucasus and favourable developments elsewhere cannot fail to make both these parties more amenable and more moderate in their demands.X . «H NO rE OP POSSIBLE TERMS OP PEACE WITH TURKEY AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE TERMS WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO:- (a) The Entente, (b) Other Parties in the Ottoman Empire, and their bearing on engagements already entered into by the former with the latter.

The Great and Illustrious Vizier - The High Commissioner in Egypt. On Friday, 22nd instant, I received your honourable letter dated 6th instant (10th March) together with the sum demanded. This is to acknowledge receipt of same. We have also noted the approval and acceptance of the British Government of all our demands mentioned in our letter, dated 14th Rabi Tani, and the preparation of all other materials demanded in our letter in the place named awaiting our demand. I beg to add that yesterday the bearer arrived here with information which must be known to you. And on account of what I have perceived of your noble spirit and high personality, I have thought it necessary to send him back to you accompanied by the letters which were received from outside for the information of Your Excellency, from which you may know our endeavours, and the perusal of which will save us mentioning the details of our proceedings. I send the original documents especially as you have had no personal experience of our work before, although the result of such endeavours can only be known to God. I send with these letters my letters to our chiefs in El Yemen, hoping that after perusal you will% will kindly see that they are speedily transmitted to their destination, in order to stop the blood shed in the district of Lahaj. In conclusion I beg to present my highest regards and implore God to grant success to all. Dated: 25th Jamad Awal 1334. (Unsigned) Handwriting of Sherif Hosayn.^/SHBAL mss AS?,. We earnestly hope that you will 'begin blockading the Yemen Coasts and stopping all exports to Hijaz ports and coasts, beginning with Jedda as I mentioned in my letters of the 14th and 29 th. Our purpose in establishing good relations as explained in my letter, article No. 1 etc., is to seize the opportunity to send the necessary forces to him (Faisal) and to be present with him for the reasons which he has mentioned and to' which I mentioned in my letter dated 29th, on the formation of a force and the sending of it to those places (Syria). This is the plan which he laid dov/n, and intended to follow, because he had no hope in the Syrians starting any movement, not because of his mistrust in them, but because the notables and leaders of the party and those who steer the move ment have all departed. We have therefore to depend upon the natives of the Hijaz for starting the local movement or seizing the Railway lines or any other movement. The Shaalan mentioned in the translation of the number cypher, is 'Nuri' the head of the well known Aneiza tribe, who inhabit the desert and the borders of Syria, as is known from the map. We shall send them as much money as we can, in accordance with their request, as money is the only axis on which everything revolves. We have at once instructed him to execute your wish conveyed to us in your verbal message regarding the communications, as he is the best qualified to carrycarry out such a task. We rely on your directions with regard to giving the necessary instructions for the handing over of what is demanded in accordance with the lists sent hy us through our messengers. Now one of my country people arrived here from the Kurd country of Asia Minor and described to me the waste and destruction which befell the country and the loss of money and men so that very little of its people remain owing to the great number of naked and barefooted men who-were recruited from that country to walk on the snow and expose themselves to all sorts of hardships and fasting. The natives carry on their backs the troops equipments and ammunitions for distances the shortest of which is not less than 250 km. on snow and ice. He also related to me things which bind me to ask you, in the name of humanity, to let the Russians stop killing the children and those ^ whom human feelings abstain from killing. It is true that our friends in question have done what they have done to the Armenians (God will deal with them); let them not follow their example, as this will create hatred in the hearts of the people which the British Government is the first to abhor.Letter from Faisal, son of the Sherif to his father. In reality nothing compelled me to come hack except what I have seen of the general state of affairs which manifested disturbance and utter ruin. There can he no trust in their sayings or their writings as I am quite sure that if they have no loyalty to the reigning dynasty, how can they he loyal to us? I think my lord has learned of their desire - to change the heir apparent, Yfeihid El Din and to nominate Majid in his place. The circumstances that made me come hack are as I have already explained in a preceding letter. The state and the end of the Caucasus Army are unknown to us. Ten days ago, that is, before my return to Medina, rumours of the fall of Erzrum, Van, Bitlis, current here as being sure. ^ Thereupon, and account of the great distance, the sending of speedy reinforcements to the Caucasus Division (in order to compensate the losses of that army sustained in the evacuation of that country), is not possible, especially after the surrender of 45,000 troops in Erzrum, as has been repeatedly rumoured. (But the Government flatly denies the news and even says that Erzrum is still in our hands.) Therefore it is a natural consequence that the Russians will continue to take possession of the Islamic countries which are deprived of men and arms. WhenWhen the Government saw the great necessity for troops to face the Russian current, they with drew a part of the army with which they intended to invade Egypt, and gave up officially the advance in Egypt. (This has been kept concealed even from us) and that the Government would collect all the soldiers in the posts necessary for defence,-so that the Russians could not continue the advance and enter between the two countries: i Arabic and Turkish, the movement which, if successfully executed, would be the end of the Ottoman Power, and the division of that Empire, which calamity has compelled me to return in order to see the state of affairs with ray own eyes, because if it took place it would lay all Arab countries open to every invader without any r protector or defender. ^ On our return to Syria, we began to enquire for news concerning the state of affairs but I am sorry to say we failed to get any true information, and our leaders used to make demonstrations day and night pretending that they had conquered one country and left for another. In the meantime the inhabitants of three Islamic provinces were massacred wholesale, including women and children; this is as a chastisement for what they had done on earth concealing from us the calamities which befell Islam by their pride and deceit. The agent of the General Officer Commanding arrived here on his way to Baghdad. After his arrival to Aleppo he gave up that expedition on theO f c (&amp;) the plea that the road had been spoiled by the flood; and proceeded to Constantinople with the intention of returning to that destination (Baghdad) in a month's time. Yesterday, we learned that the Russians had arrived at Mardin or Diarbakr, but this news was not confirmed. But it appears from the official communiques on the Eastern theatre of war, of which nothing has been said for a long time, that great battles are taking place there, and that the results of those battles are against us and not for us. Therefore, and taking into consideration the present state of affairs, I found it absolutely necessary to have a force to represent our Sayyid (the Sherif) with which we may be able to defend the main Arab countries and the key to the Haramain (Mecca and Medina). Hence, ray advice is that we should establish good relations (not stated with whom), even with the least guarantee from them, as this is our interest when they demand the same from us. The state of affairs of which I am informing you is always the same, yet the future is in the hands of God, and we cannot judge this war, except by appearances. My greatest fear is the occurence of the calamity (to which I have already referred) whilst we are without nucleus of force. It appears that their demand of 'Mujahidin” is simply to delude the whole world to the effect that they are determined on the advance against Egypt. At any rate if our Sayyid approves of sending a forceforce here, he can form another force to take its place and safeguard the Hijaz. , The Fourth Division has sent £5,000 to Medina to he handed over to our Sayyid to he spent in preparing uniforms for the Mujahidin and they are now busy collecting arms from the hands of the troops after which they will he despatched. The Angari people who were in Erzrum will Inform you of the state of affairs here verbally. As I was finishing this letter the German Consul paid me a visit and informed me officially of the fall of Erzrum. In all cases I am under the orders of my Sayyid, if he orders me to return I will return, and if he wishes otherv/ise I will follow his orders. ’Id was not able to tell me about the person (Faroki), who, he said, has given himself up; he said his name is Muhammad Sherif, but I did not know him. Nuri (Shaalan) is here and we have made a sworn agreement and action is being taken; may God be our helper. Nothing can be done without money. (Unsigned and undated)Letter from Aly, son of Sherif, to his father. Sir:- What is understood from the appendix of my brother is that he has no hope in the Government and its continuance any more; and that his intention is to have a force there, so that when ever the Government begins to show signs of collapse, he will take the affairs of the country into his own hands. Also, the Government has asked us to send a force and promised to send us money and arms; and I do not see any objection to complying with their wish in order to get hold of the arms and the money and sending the force to that end. The movement should take place in the hot season; i.e. in the middle of the summer, so that the hot climate also might help us against them. The Jehani Kadi has arrived and I did the necessary with him. We are awaiting the arrival of A1 Abada and he will be sufficient for us with his remaining Hah •ah. Also I have compelled the Kadi to talk with the Awagir El Ghazu, because they depend upon each other. This is what I have started to do here. As to the Arabs of our district you need not worry about them, especially A i Awali, Ibn El Sifr and A1 Sawaid. As to the movement, it is necessary that it should take place in a month and half to two months, and during this periodperiod tnose others will become weaker. In any case, we, your servants, are awaiting your high orders, Sir, either for the approval of the sending of a force and acting according to this plan, or bringing Faisal back and beginning action with our tribes, i.&lt;e. of Aneza and here. If the Syrians do not assist us, they will not help against us. This is a summary of my opinion. The letter of Ibn Rafada is enclosed herewith and I am waiting for your order on this subject. If it is necessary to send someone whom we shall give the necessary warning, the right man is present here, and we can rely upon him to do this thing through him. Friday 17th Jamad Awal 1334 (Unsigned)To H.E. our lord A1 Sherif Abdalla. H.E. Sherif Abdalla Bey, May his greatness endure. I have received Your Excellency's order, dated 1st Rahi Akhar, 1334, and it gave us pleasure to learn that you are enjoying perfect health and happiness. You ask me to go and see our Lord and the Lord of all of us, and this is ray foremost desire, asking God to facilitate things so that I shall he able to go and see him, as this is what I think of day and night. However, it will not escape your attention that in the first place I am undecided as to the road which I am to take, as to go hy land to Medina is very difficult owing to the hostility that exists between us and the tribes of Bani Harb, Jeheina and Aneza, and in these days even a brother does not help his brother; and if I were to go by steamer, they would not allow me and will not allow my people to go by steamer. Even my letters are not accepted by post. Secondly, on account of the famine which is prevailing here, if I leave the Arabs they will destroy one another. So if we can find a way by which we can make a visit I will not hesitate to make a visit to H.E. our lord, as my visit to him is a sacred duty. Nevertheless you know that your orders are being obeyed here. If you wish me to do anything, pleaseTranslation. In the name of God the Merciful the Compassionate. To the honourable and most eminent A1 Sayyid al Mohammad Ibn Ali (A1 Idrisi), may God lead him to do His will. The peace of God, his mercy and blessing be upon you.
