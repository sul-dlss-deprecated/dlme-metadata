I am to suggest that it would be irripolitic to delay this project further because of the risk that in 1995, . when the Company’s concession ends, the lersian Government may dispute the title to the land. Obviously the conditions in Persia will change in many ways in the interval and it is not impossible that they may so change as to permit of His Majesty’s Government acquiring an indisputable title. Mr* bevin therefore recommends that the company should be invited to cancel its instructions to its office in Abadan to suspend action, that the transaction should proceed and that the building with the site be acquired as quickly as possible on the terms suggested. 5. If the Secretary of State for India agrees and if the building and the site are acquired, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Tehran, to whom a copy of this correspondence is being sent, would have standing instructions to take advantage of any future opportunity to validate the British Government’s right to own the land.

The Consulate buildings at Khorramshahr are in a state of collapse, and negotiations are now in process both on the spot and between the A. I.O.C. in London and the Foreign Office, for the purchase of two houses from the A. I.O.C. at a cost of approximately 1,50,000 tomans. The Government of India have sanctioned the expenditure and now request the ex post facto approval of the Secretary of State. In view of the fact that all authorities are agreed that the purchase of the buildings is essential, it is submitted that approval should be accorded. In paragraph 4 of their letter, the Government of India raise the point whether the sanction of the Secretary of State is necessary for capital expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf which is borne wholly by them. The question was referred to the Financial Secretary, who is of the opinion that the previous sanction of the Secretary of State would not be required on purely financial grounds. It is possible however that the purchase of buildings, etc., particularly in Persia, might involve political considerations, and for this reason it is considered that this Office should be informed as soon as possible. There is the additional point that the original capital expenditure on new works might entail later maintenance costs, expenditure on which is divisible in moiety-Sbetween H.LI.G. and the Government of India under the present arrangement governing diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf. ^ A ^ a/’. efT 0 ^ ^ It does not appear that this is a case for prior consultation with the Foreign Office, but copies might be sent to them of the Government of India letter and our reply. It is submitted therefore that the ex post facto approval of the Secretary of State to the expenditure on buildings for the Consulate in Khorramshahr be accorded: and that the Government of India be informed that it is not considered necessary for the prior sanction of the Secretary of State to be obtained for capital expenditure which is borne wholly by them, though he should be informed as soon as possible.

Prom the political and administrative point of view we would see no objection in this Department. to telling the Government of India that previous sanction of the Secretary ^'of State would no longer be required. * The procedure is a ^mere formality and we do‘not consult the Foreign Office. Cases might arise where it would be advisable for the Foreign Office of the purchase of buildings in Persia, but this would be covered by the^last paragraph of the draft letter to India. ' ' •' - &gt; My own feeling is that this is one of those pinpricking regulations where Yt/hitehall control could well be relaxed, but can it be done just by telling the Government of India so^or would it mean the amendment of any existing regulations? Previous sanction of the Secretary of State has been a routine matter for many years. I cannot say without laborious research when it began, but certainly in the Government of India Finance Department resolution of 18th February, 1932, No. F.38-l(a)-EX l/32, paragraph 8, provision is made for previous sanction for 'any expenditure on diplomatic and consular services in Persia' . (gvhich was later amended to 'Iran and the Persian Gulf' by Financial Despatch 13 of 1937^. Financial Despatch No. 1 of 1939 superseded No. 13 of 1937 Which had endorsed the resolution quoted. Do you consider that an amendment to the 1939 Despatch will be necessary or can we take it as an interpretation of paragraph 3(ii) of the 1939 Despatch?Copy. (K 11012/10720/234). ' 7 W \ My dear Baxter, We have just received a letter from our General Ma ~jer in Iran in which he says that the British Consul in Khorramshahr has enquired whether we would sell some of our Khorramshahr property to H.M.G. for purposes of a Consulate Office and accommodation for the Consul and the Vice-Consul. As you know, we have a number of houses in Khorramshahr which are all occupied by our Staff; there is no office there now, it is simply used as a residential area. 3, The houses selected by the Consul consist of one single-story bungalow and another building comprising two semi-detached double-storied houses. The two adjoin and stand in their own grounds, and both front on to the main road that runs from the town of Khorramshahr to the river point where the Customs House is situatfed. 3. The request made by the Consul has been supported by the Ambassador, and we have telegraphed that we are quite ready to sell the property as needless to say we who rely greatly on the help of the Consul in many problems are as anxious as we are sure H.M.G. must be v that his house and office premises should be to his satisfaction. k .I thought you would like to be made aware of what is passing in regard to this matter, and if there is any further information you should wish to have about the property, please call for it. I understand that the India Office are also likely to be interested in this trans action and, if I am right, perhaps you would kindly let me know to whom I should pass on the information. Yours sincerely, (Signed) N.A. Gass. C.W. Baxter, Esq., C.M.G., M.C., Foreign Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.y.

The Government erf India, therefore, question whether the previous sanction of the Secretary of State is necessary to expenditure which is to be borne wholly by them* In the case of the Zahidan Vice- Consulate the Government of India requested the approval of H*M*G. to expenditure on repairs only, (Ext.8096A-l) • 0 . 0 . % We should be grateful ibr your views on this point, Ah tl lqHlcL Up , cJt A fMu* &amp; vi,C . &lt;i* uytudZi+ki ^ Wk T&amp;&lt;-SRUkc u) OV KoL' ^ u,&lt; IW ?f \ Zu-wfr P^t^ } 104!The requirement of the Secretary of State* s previous sanction in regard to expenditure on Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia was due to the a S re ®? ent the Treasury that each Government would secure the previous assent of the other to expenditure in excess of the prescribed limits, which have of course been raised as a war measure* There is no particular reason, so far aa ^ can see, why this requirement should apply in the c&amp;seo capital expenditure which is borne wholly by oneor^her of the Governments concerned, though, as is clear frcm this case, it is obviously convenient that the Secretary of S a should be aware as early as possible of capital expenditu of a substantial character, particularOy where this may involve running charges as well.

The proceeded by reference to the terms the 25th March 1937, to the Governor I think that it may be convenient that the present should be self-contained. of India Despatch 6, dated Act, 1935, 2. The limitations with which ve are now/ concerned are such as might be imposed solely in the exercise of the Secretary of State’s powers under Section 314 of the Act, and nothing in the present Despatch must be taken as having any reference to any limitation imposed, or that may hereafter be imposed, by or under other provisions of the act, such as Sections 235 and 247. It will ? moreover, be understood that nothing in this Despatch afreets the arrangements for submission to the Secretary of State of the Budget proposals, in regard to ’which the existing requirements will remain in force. Your -excellency will also appreciate that the directions now/ given must remain open to reconsideration in the light of experience. 3. I have decided, in aceordance with the recommendations of Your Excellency’s Government, and in supersession of the directions communicated in my Financial Despatch No.13, dated the 8th April 1937, that my previous consent shall be sought upon the following matters to the extent indicated against each:- (i) Expenditure in respect of the Governor-General’s steff and household, the residences, furniture and motor cars provided for his use, his equipment and travelling allowances, his sumptuary allowance, and his contract allowance, shall be regulated by such requirements as have been or may be- made in this regard by the Secretary cf State. (ii) Expenditure in r.-sp^ct of Diplomatic and Consular Services in Iran and the Persian Gulf shall be subject to the previous sanction of the Secretary State except in the following cases (a) fresh expenditure on salaries not exceeding 1100 per annum at any one Consulate; up to an amount in the aggregate4 2 . (b) increased expenditure on contingencies, except as regards an unusual item exceeding £100^ (c) increased expenditure on travelling. The previous sanction of the Secretary of State shall also be sought to any addition to the total annual limit of expenditure fixed by him for ofiice allowances and ot.x-r contract grants for all Agencies and Consulates in Iran and the Persian Gulf where such expenditure is divisible between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India, except temporary excesses in the permissible aggregate limit not exceeding Rs.250. (iii) Expenditure on the purchase of imported military stores shall be subject to such rules as have been or may bo made in this regard by the Secretary of State, and no purchases not covered by such rules shall be made without his prior consent. (iv) The consent of the Secretary of State shall be obtained before any dispute arising out of the terms of a contract executed in England with a Railway Company of English domicile is referred to arbitration. 4. Apart from these specific limitations, the question whether a prior reference should be made to the Secretary of State will in future depend upon the judgment of Your Excellency's Government. As Your Excellency is well aware, a similar discretion is already exercisable over the whole range of Government activity except in so far as reference to me has been specifically required by the rules hitherto in force on the subject of prior sanction to expenditure, and the conventions governing its exercise are familiar. In broad terms, prior reference to the Secretary ol State will bo required either if the nature of the proposed action, or the circumstances in which it is to be taken are such as to occasion doubt whether the Secretary of State l may not find re;-.son to question its suitabilityj or (oven in cases where no such doubt is felt) if warranted by the intrinsic importance or general interest of the matter or by the degree of criticism which is likely to be aroused in Parliament, in the Indian Legislatures, or elsewhere. These criteria should in future be applied over the whole financial field. I do not propose to attempt to suggest in any detail how they should be applied, though I would particularly instance, as an example of the occasions upon which doubt might arise, the case of an important unresolved difference of opinion between the Finance Department and another Department. I prefer in general to rely on the discretion of Your Excellency's Government, confident that it will always be exercised with a full sense of the ultimate responsibility to Parliament which the Secretary of Stsvte must continue to bear for all the operations of Your Excellency's Government. ^ • I have the honour to be My Lord Marquess, Your Lordship's most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) ZETLAND.PILE no.

Khorramfahahr* • 12th December _ 2» The existing rate of conveyance allowance for His Majesty’s Consul, Khorramshahr, i*e. Rs.75/- per month, was sanctioned in October 1930. Since then the cost of petrol, oil, repairs, spare parts, tyres and tubes and the pay of a cleaner or driver have increased enormously as shown by the examples in the statement below :- 1930 1945 Percentage of increase Cost in Cost in Cost in Cost in ^.2 India Persia India ' ‘ a?

If this were done every officer would have to maintain a stock of spare parts valued at several thousand rupees. Bv the time a spare part purchased in India has been cleared from tne customs in Persian its value has risen considerably e.g. a battery bought in India in 1944 cost &amp;.77/- but freight* Insurance, Customs Duty and miscellaneous charges increased its value to Rs.125/-. If a large stock of spare parts purchased in India is not maintained by an officer he is compelled either (a) to take his car off the road for several months until some spare part arrives from India or (b) buy the spare part (almost invariably socond hand) in Persia at the local market rate. 3. His Majesty’s Consul reports that during 1944 his average monthly expenditure on petrol and oil alone was Rs.90/-. He maintained no record of his monthly expenditure on repairs, spare parts, tyres and tubes etc. but since ne has an old car (1938 model) this expenditure cannot have been less than Rs.50/- per month. In addition he has to maintain a cleaner-driver since numerous distinguished guests visit Khorramshahr so it is clear that he is heavily out of pocket. 4. In the circumstances explained in the preceding paragraphs I strongly recommend that the conveyance allowance for His Majesty* s Consul, Knorramshahr, be increased from fe.75/- to fts.150/- with effect from the 1st January, 1945.

As question of title has now been raised it would appear better to drop proposals for new construction and proceed with original plan of repairing building as originally proposed.

I was informed in March 1941 by the Honourable the Political Resident that the type of temporary office building had finally been selected and that funds had been allotted for its construction. I learnt that under the Mumcipal Regulations the permission of the Governor of Khorramshahr had to be obtained before a new building could be erected. Accordingly i addressed the Governor in my letter No.95 dated the l7tn March, 1941. in his letter No.321 dated the 5th April 1941 the necessary permission was granted and it was ex ected tnat the demolition of the old building would begin during the month of April. It was not possible to^begin the demolition immediately since the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company were anxious for this work to be undertaken by a contractor^and accordingly I called for tenders. b. The payment oi tne rent aue to tne neirs oi tne iate Sheikh Khazai for the year ending the 31st March 1941 was made on the 5th April, 1941 to the Governor in accordance with the instructions contained m paragraph 2 of Mr. Neville butler f s despatch No. 14(130/28/38) of the 3rd March 1938 to Mr. Gardener. The Governor had made the payment of rent the excuse to question our title to the Consulate' building and grounds and our right to erect a new building 4. The present oosition is that this year as in the previous five years the rent was paid to him and 1 understand it is customary for him to pay the amount to the office of the Ministry of Justice from whichf it is eventually collected by Sheikh . The demolition of the existing building has nent of the rent due to the heirs of the late Khazai r s heirs not begun and both I and my clerks are working in the back portion of the Vice-Consulate. The rooms in the back portion although in a poor state of repair are not liable to collapse. The front portion of the building, which it was intended to*demolish, is most dilapidated. 5. The Governors enquiry regarding the ownership of the building has not been answered and i should be glad' if I may Mrbe instructed what reply should oe given, when he first heard of the project of a new Vice-Consulate office he told me in conversation that he was deli hted with the proposal and that he considered the blue prints plans excellent. For this reason i am inclined to suspect that his enquiry in respect of the ownership of the existing building nas been instigated by a third-party. It is well known that Admiral Bayendor would like to secure the Vice-Consulate site , j which is exactly opposite the Iranian Naval base on the other side of the Karun, and it is possible that the Crovemor is well aware of the Admiral r s wishes. 1 mention this aspect of the question since i understand that the position of Sheikh Khazal’s heirs in regard to their father 1 s property in South Iran is far from secure. Further I understand that it is possible that the Iranian frovemment maty suddenly announce that they have taken over part or ail the property of Sheikh Khazal's heirs. In these circumstances it is not unlikely that the Iranian Government will adopt anjobstructive attitude should we endeavour to secure the permission of Sheikh Khazal f s heirs for the erection of a new building. 6. His Majesty T s Minister is aware of the uncertain character of our title to the Yice*Consulate building and grounds and it has now to be decided what course o? action is to be taken. It appears that the Governor of Khorramshahr will not grant permission for the erection of a new building until he learns the name or names of the real owners. The following alternative courses of action may be considered:- (a) #e can attempt to secure the oemission of the various heirs of Sheikh Khazal for the demolition of the old building and the construction of a new one. l consider that the possibility of a successful conclusion of this course of action is extremely remote in view of the a.bsence of a lease and the number of the heirs. (b) We can explain the exact position as we understand it i.e. that for over 50 years we have been occupying the present building which we originally rented on a lease dated 1st Moharram 1310 (26-7-1892) and wnich expired on 26-7-1902; a copy of that lease is attached. That we were granted a new lease in 1902. Since that date we have continued to use the building; we have added a number of rooms to the original structure and we have invariably borne all expenses for both uetty and major repairs though under the terns of both leases Sheikh Khazal was to have been responsible for major repairs. Finally the building being one of local design xhas now reached a condition,owing to floods and exceptionally heavy rain, which makes it uneconomical to repair. We may coint out to the Iranian Government that it will be impossible to secure in a short time the pemission of the numerous heirs of Sheikh Khazal for the demolition of the old building and the construction of a new one. we may add that the British Government is anxious to demolish the old building which is npw virtually a rum and to build a new Yice-Consulate which will be more in keeping with the other houses in Khorramshahr. (c) We may renounce our claim to the present site and attempt to find another. The question of securing a suitable alternative site was carefully examined by Mr. Gardener, Uactain Bazalgette and Captain Stewart and l have no reason to thin£ that the position has since changed. 7 7.

HL.n Reference correspondence ending with your telegran No. 278, dated July 3rd regarding Khorratn- shahr Vice Consulate. Although it was stated in Teheran Legation despatch No.163, dated 23rd April 1938 that no difficulty was to be anticipated from Persian Governments attitude towards rights of heirs of Sheikh Khazal to site,Consul General, Bushire*s telegram No;90 dated 7 17th June 1941 suggests different view. Government of India are reluctant to authorise expenditure amounting to roughly tts. 25,000/- on repairing building on a site to which title is doubtful. Current situation in Persia seems to provide suitable opportunity for final settlement of this question and Government of India would be glad to know if steps can now be taken to obtain long term lease of unchallengable validity.

Um On receipt of this despatch I discussed with the Tehran representative of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company the possibility that the Company might be able to sell or rent to His liajeety’s Government alternative accommodation. Unfort unately the only Company building which could be adapted as a permanent Vice-Consulate is the Cent House at idxazalieh and the option to purchase this has already been granted to the Knglish Club at Khorramshahr; which in anticipation, has expended on bull4in swimming pool. 4s regards renting some other Company building as a temporary office, r. :ice explained that they were debarred from this by agreement with the Iranian Government. The existing arrangement under which His iajesty’s Vice-Consul lives in a Company house was only made as a result of an undertaking that the premises would not be used as the Consulate offices. 3. On the other hand the Company have offered to erect on the existing site a standard steel frame building which His Majesty’s Consul at .Jiwaz considers will offer just sufficient accom odation. The cost of erection, in eluding the cost of demolishing the remains of the present building and raising fo .the ground above flood level would be £1,500 and I have p, recom-tended to the Government of India that this offer should b n H. c*’*- ■*-» be accepted. fn, u~V» t -) 4. There is good reason to believe that the Iranian Government contemjjlate building a railway from to iChorramshahr along the right baiisc of the ^ arun elver. It —-—**“ / appears The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, /X t -*x . ■». ‘T ('1 *** T • O • , ‘ -t ♦ • f • Vil • .i . • , etc., etc., etc.,Sir, «ith reference to horramehahr telegram of Norember 16th, 1940, addressed to me and repeated to you and to my telegram No. 66 of ^orember 19th,regard ing the gradual collapse of the Vice Consulate building at vhorr&amp;mshahr, I have the honour to forward herewith a full report from His .tajeety’s Vice Consul on the earlier stages of this collapse. It is clear that whether it is eventually decided to effect repairs or not, the building must be evacuated as soon as possible. The trouble is there la nowhere to evacuate to. The Vice Consul's bungalow is too small to house the office even temporarily and in any case the Company would no doubt object, as they have in the past, to official business b^ing conducted there. 3. Pending a reply from you to my telegram under reference about the likelihood of the negotiations with the Company for the purchase of a house being successful, x instructed Captain Hauler to consult a Compony engineer «s to the possibility of shoring up the walls and ceilings of those rooms which it will be necessary to continue , usin for the moment. It is possible however that he has I not to do so as he was unfortunately sent to j hospital with high fever yesterday and I do not yet know ? how long he is likely to be there. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your obedient servant, Sd.A.H.KING. H. M. CONSaJU.

This morning, without assy warning, one of the main pillars of trie building, which consist of solid blocks of stone, collapsed, tearing down with it a part of the upper verandah and leaving a part of the roof, which has already been reported to be unsafe, entirely without support. Further cracks have appeared near tnis place and it is only a question of time before the roof, verandah and ^ain staircase come down also. The wet season is just beginning and the damage ie »ure to spread, until it will be impossible to use the building even as an office, as is done now, and I wish to place it on record that with the buildin in its present condition I cannot hold qyself responsible either for the safety of Government property and papers kept t*.ere, nor for the Ftaff wno at present work in it. 3. If the building has to be complexly evacuated, the only way in which work can be carried on will be for us to throw ourselves again on the mercy of the Anglo-Iranian )il Company, a proceeding Which is both undesirable and extremely undignified. As it io, the amenities extended by tae Company to the /ite-Consulate, including the provision of accommodation for the /ice-Consul and the head Clerx, do not make it easy to deal with them ofiieialiy ma certainly detracts from any influence which the Consulate nas with them. 4. Finally I would like to mention that I consider tnat any money expended locally on propaganda is wasted wiien the people here can see that the British Government are content to house their representative in a semi-derelict bulletin, which for the last three years has been gradually crumbling to the ground and is now in such a state that I am ashamed to fly tli® British flag over it. 6.

I have asked the Electrical Engineer of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company, Abadan, to give me an estimate for the temporary re-wiring of the building, and I have impressed on him that the question of re-building this Vice-Consulate is under consideration and the G-ovemment of India will not be prepared to consider any big amount for-rewiring and it is there fore essential that the minimum amount should be spent for this purpose.

Subject ; Vice Consulate at Khorramshahr* I have the honour to submit herewith my report on the condition of tie 'fice Consulate building at Khorramshahr# Before going into details, I would like to point out that tne building can be made haoitable and safe for many years to come, provided certain works of strengthening and reno vation are carried out* It has, in no way, been damaged by the flood of January, 1937, as the plinth and the ground v*. w abo^e the ilood level#. The building is in an extremely neglected and delapidated state. It needs thorough repairs, lading into consideration the prohibitive custom duties, and high wages of labour, I estimate that Es. 24,000/- will be required to put the building in a decent condition for the occupation of tihe Vice Consul. In Khorramshalir ordinary coolies get Rials 10*00 equivalent to &amp;* 1/10/- per day* Vi_ce .Consulate buildims at Khorrai Division, to Khorramshahr as soon as he was available, and1 940 J - 2 - P.Z. per day. Sand and stones are brougfat in 4)^^fro4i Kumit, a distance of over 150 miles* 2* FOUNDATIONS , The south i,e. the river front side foundation is 4 feet deep; 3-£ feet of burnt bricks in lime arid 6 inches concrete. The width is 4-J- feet, ’.Vest side foundation is 3 feet deep; 2 ^ feet of burnt bricks and 6 inches of stone, while north side is 2 feet of burnt bricks and % 6 inches stone. .Stone masonry generally remains under water. The lemaining foundation masonry is very damp, with large number of bricks in different stages of disinteg ration. In order to protect the foundation from further damage, I propose I'-oxo’-TS cement concrete alround, cement grouting where necessary, and cement pudlo plaster to brickwork. 3 . mis . Walls are of sundried bricks, with outside facing of 8 ' square burnt bricks. The thickness is 3 feet to 31 feast, where tnere is a £nd story, while it is 2 feet to 21 feet, in the office rooms, that have no floor above. North side wall is a little out of plumb, but it appears to have been constructed like this, due to poor workmanship, as no crack is visible anywhere. 3 feet height above floor level shows signs of dampness. Almost all the arches have developed sxst' cracks. I propose cement pudlo plaster to the damp portions of walls alround, after racking out all the joints, and R.C.C. lintels over the arches. After laying lintels semi circular arches will be removed, inorder to have rectangu lar openings, which will give more air and light space. 4. GROUND FLOOR . Ground Floor is 8 inches to 1 foot below the outside ground level and is therefore damp and unhealthy. I propose replacing the gutch floor by cement pudlo concrete; with a- 3 • raised wooden dais for the clerks, Vic 3 ha^e raised wood floor in his office room* 1 P.Z. .454 5. FIH4T 7LQQH .

WINiXhyd AND OTHiilR tfQQDV/Q.dXd Doors, windows and sunshades being primitive and flimsy are all in an extremely bad state. They should be replaced* In order to keep down the expenditure, I propose renewing doors and windows of the first floor only, i*e. the residential portion of the building and not the office portion. Wooden railing in both the verandahs of the first floor and on top of the roof, has almost collapsed* I propose cement concrete balustrade, vooden posts supporting balconies are not sound* I propose cement concrete pillars instead* doof needs resloping with regular gradient towards rain water spouts.

This portion of tne building is so dangerous, that it will have to be dismantled and rebuilt. 8 * ADDITIONS iND ILT&amp;iATTQiMS . Tne Vice Consul has proposed certain additions and alterations in order to increase the accomodation and made the place suitable for the residence of the represen- uative of His Majesty. These changes are of minor nature and will be shown on the plans, which will follow.hlM JPUaTiR A 10 All the rooms will have to be lime and distempered. 10 .

With reference to the second paragraph of the India Office Express Letter No: PZ7233/38 dated the 28th October 1938, the Government of India will be glad to know whether any repairs have been done to the office building since July 1938 and whether the building is actually in use as an office.

We have, as you know, concerned ourselves to make suggestions with a view to securing the comfort of the Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr, maintaining his prestige and at the same time putting an early end to a situation in which we are straining somewhat the good-will and convenience of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. For their part the Government of India has adopted firmly the attitude that they have no funds available for rebuilding. You have suggested that it would be useless to attempt to shake them from this attitude unless we can give in advance an undertaking that whatever financial arrangements are arrived at in respect of the whole of our representation in Persia and/ J.P, Gibson, Esq RECD.

We are loath to commit ourselves to any such undertaking at the present moment and in any case we note that there is no guarantee that it would, in fact, effectively move the Government of India to find the funds for rebuilding. Meantime Gardener, the Consul at Ahwaz, who is on terms of friendship with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company officials concerned, has seen Elkington and Pattinson in London. The interview was a private one. Gardener simply taking the rSle of His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz, concerned as such with conditions at the post, but his object was, of course, to endeavour to induce Elkington to agree to provide a suitable house for the Vice-Consul more or less indefinitely, following the suggestion contained in the last paragraph of the Government of India’s express letter No. P 41-A/38 of the 15th August. He found the officials friendly but disinclined to give any undertaking to provide a house for an unlimited period. They indicated that they would like the new unmarried Vice- Consul/sJJ 1 - Consul to occupy a smaller house than the one given to Bazalgette. The accommodation would he that of an employee of standing so as not to belittle the position of the Vice-Consul, hut, without being unhelpful or importunate, the Company wanted to he relieveu of the obligation to provide a house. With our knowledge of the Company’s circumstances, we feel we cannot oress them to change their attitude. Fortunately, however, there is one line of escape. Elkington suggests that the old consular residence could he repaired sufficiently to make it habitable for some time. We have, in fact, some ground for suspecting that Bazalgette took a rather pessimistic view of the effects of the flood and we suggest that Elkington’s proposal is worth investigation. So what we would suggest is that when the new Vice-Consul goes to Khorramshahr he will occupy one of the Company's smaller houses as they desire until a further report can be obtained on the present condition of the old house and the prospects of making it habitable. Gardener will be asked to go there and investigate soon after he arrives in Ahwaz, say, early in November. This solution is not what1 SP\ we could have wished and it may meet with some little opposition from the Vice-Consul, hut we feel that there is no satisfactory alternative. This does not in any way imply that a new Vice- Consulate will not have to he huilt at Khorramshahr in the relatively near future. We are sending copies of this letter to Chancery at Tehran and to Ahwaz. No steps v/ill he taken, naturally, until you have given authority. I need hardly say that we hope to have your views soon, so that repairs can he put in hand before there is the risk of further flooding.

S.W.l 4th July, 1958 Sir, With reference to India Office letter P.Z. 3955/38 of the 10th June, I am directed “by Viscount Halifax to transmit herewith, to he laid before the Secretary of State for India, a copy of the despatch No.163 from His Majesty’s Charge d*Affaires at Tehran, and to state that Lord Halifax has had under consideration the action necessary to meet the situation at Khorramshahr and the order in which its requirements should he dealt with in view of the numerous complicating factors. He.desires to offer the following observations. 2. It appears to he indisputable that for some years the consular buildings at Khorramshahr have been in bad condition and that, although the flood of January last has not proved so disastrous as was at first anticipated, it has served to point the need of providing an effective remedy without further delay. Lord Halifax feels confident that the importance of the post and the need for retaining it will not be challenged and he accordingly desires to support the suggestions advanced by His Majesty* s Charg£ d*Affaires at Tehran and to state his approval in principle of the proposal to erect an office apart from the residence* In this connexion Lord Halifax notes that the existing office would probably- remain serviceable /while India Officewhile a new office is under erection, so that there would he no need to ask the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company for office accommodation at any stage. 6. As regards the site. Lord Halifax agrees with Mr. Butler that the present one should he retained if possible. I am to state that so far as the heirs of Sheikh Khazal are concerned the possibility will be examined of obtaining from them a revised and valid lease. In the meantime Lord Halifax thinks it would be well to give Mr. Butler authority forthwith to proceed as he suggests to preliminary negotiations with the other owners concerned in order to determine their intentions and to discover the prices v/hich they would ask for their land, without, however, entering into any definite commitment. He would at the same time request Mr. Butler to keep in mind the possibility that negotiations with the Sheikh’s heirs may prove impossible and that an alternative site may have to be found. 4. Lord Halifax observes that the ground now occupied is probably somewhat more extensive than is strictly necessary and he suggests that the plot now planted with date palms would not be required. It would , however, appear to be most desirable that the site eventually available should not be intersected by any public roadway and that every effort should be made to obtain the surrender of the lane which now runs through the property. 5. Lord Halifax notes with regret from the express letter from the Government of India to His Majesty 1 s Consul-General at Bushire, No.F 41-A/33 of May Loth thatrv~ ■ n - E&amp;. B in view of the existing financial situation, the programme to rebuild the premises cannot he approved at present. He hopes that it may he possible to reconsider this attitude and desires to draw attention to the undesirability of placing His Majesty 1 s Vice-Gonsul at Khorramshahr for any length of time in a position of having to depend for his personal accommodation on the goodwill and favour of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. It is true that the Company may be willing to put a small house at the disposal of an unmarried Vice-Consul for possibly up to three years while the work of rebuilding, if undertaken, is in progress, and Lord Halifax is willing in this connexion to approach the company in London. He considers it essential, however, that any request for accommodation should be accompanied by an assurance that the rebuilding of the Vice-Consulate is to be undertaken without delay and that the Company will not be asked to provide a house for longer than is strictly necessary. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant.wmmt r^. (150/43/38) 'fj r / J i; i. , Z-J . ^ H ' I 47? 1 British Legation, Tehran. 23rd April, 1938. V... ! 338 My Lord, With reference to my telegram No. 32 of pi looo/?^^ March, I have the honour to inform you that I have now received a detailed report from His Majesty s Vice-Coneul at Khorramshahr regarding the ownership of the Vice-Consulate site. This report is summarised in the memorandum of which a copy is enclosed, and to which A^. ig attached a sketch map of the property. A rough copy of this sketch map has heen retained in His Majesty*s Legation. g. Before discussing the position resulting from the complicated ownership of the site, as now revealed, I would first place on record my opinion Jrhat the site is unquestionahly the most suitable one available for Hi® Majesty’s Vice-Consulate at Khorramshahr. It occupies a commanding position near the junction of the Karun and the Shatt-el-Arab, and it would undoubtedly be much to be regretted if the Vice-Consulate were to leave the site which it has occupied so long. Further, the present site is healthier and cooler than any other in Khorramshahr. In summer the house is protected from dust-storms because the prevailing north-west wind blowing over it has passed over the Shatt-el-Arab and /The . AThe south wind also blows to the house over the Shatt- el-Arab. These are important considerations in the extremely trying summer climate of Khuzistan. Thus I fully share the opinion which has been expressed both by Mr. Gardener and Captain Bazalgette, and incidentally by the Tehran Manager of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, that from every point of view His Majesty’s Government would be well advised to retain the present site, and I think that it should only be vacated if it is absolutely necessary to do so. 3 # I also concur in the view expressed by Mr. Gardener and Captain Bazalgette that the whole of the present site as shown on the attached sketch plan (with the possible exception of the area marked ’’date garden* 1 ) should be retained. Mr. Gardener has pointed out that in Khuzistan it is normal, and from the point of view of health, desirable, to provide housing accommodation for servants, rather than to allow them to live in the bazaar. It is also undoubtedly desirable that the Vice-Consulate should have a tennis court, both for the health of the Vice-Consul and his family and as an important aid to entertaining. I trust therefore that both these plots will be retained. 4 # If, as I hope, it is agreed that the present site should be retained, it will be necessary to make some new and lasting arrangement both with the i Sheikh’s heirs and with the other owners, whose rights are explained in the enclosed memorandum. With regard to the rights of the Bieikh’s heirs, the note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a translation of which I have the honour to enclose, (this note was referred toin the first paragraph of say telegram Ho* 32 ot the 19th March) f shows that there should be no reason to fear any difficulty resulting from the attitude of the Iranian Government towards those rights* In theory it should therefore now be possible to negotiate a new long-term lease with the Sheikh’s heirs* But in practice I fear that, owing to the number of the heirs end of their dissensions among themselves, there is little hope of doing so at present* The Anglo—Iranian Oil Co®peny, who are in a stronger position, as their lease has a clause specifically providing for renewal, see no prospect of success in any negotiations with the heirs, and they are not attempting any. It is unsatisfactory to have no valid lease, but as long as the rent is paid in the manner indicated b/ the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our position would seem to be strong. In view of the heirs' hope of assistance from His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, I do not think that there is any need to fear that they will challenge our occupation of the site* In all the circumstances therefore I would recommend that no attempt should be made at present to negotiate a new lease from the Sheikh's heirs. 5 # With regard to the owners of the cultivation rights in the various plots of land occupied by the Vice- Consulate, Captain Bazalgette states that he is informed that they are anxious to sell their rights to His Majesty's Government or to lease them on a long lease, as they fear expropriation by the Iranian Navy or Customs if the Vice-Consulate is moved. I have not received any estimate of the cost of buying or leasing their rights, but Captain Baaigette states that it should be possible to obtain favourable terms. I would therefore recommend /thatthat authority should now be given for the initiation of negotiations for the lease or purchase of these cultivation rights, which must be obtained if the Vice- Consulate is to be rebuilt in a different position, as will be recommended in later paragraphs of this despatch 6. So much for the question of the title to the site. It remains to consider the problem of the condition of the buildings, already in very bad repair before the floods, and now so damaged that the house is uninhabitable and the servants* quarters demolished. -- Hitherto two proposals have been made for the repair of the buildings. The first was for an expenditure of £260, which was sanctioned in your telegram Ho. 16 of the 26th February, on the repair of the offices. I am not aware whether these repairs have been carried out, but the office is in use and as far as I know is likely to remain fit for use. But these repairs, which would not cover the residence, would clearly not touch the main problem of the state of the buildings. The second proposal, to which reference is made in paragraph 3 of Mr. Seymour’s despatch No. 53 of the 11th February, was for an expenditure of about £3,000 on repairing the present house. I have&gt; however, now received a report from Captain Bazalgette, based on the opinion of the Chief 1 ngineer of the Anglo-Iraninn Oil Company, from which it seems clear that it would not be possible satisfactorily unsafe. But the house cannot be re-roofed, because the walls are rotten, while the foundations, such as they are.mm mm 5 demolish the present house and offices and build anew. In all the circumstances it seems clear that the possibility put forward by the Anglo-Xranian il Company to the Inals Office in London and to me here,^should at once reside in or on the present Consular property, is not practicable* 7 . I have not received any estimate of the cost of doing this, though the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have prepared a very rough estimate of £10*000 os the cost of building a Vice-Consulate house and offices on another site. The cost may appear heavy, but I need not stress the importance of suitable buildings for what is one of the most important consular posts in Iran. he present position is most unsatisfactory and cannot be allowed to continue. I have the honour therefore to recommend that a decision should now be taken in principle to rebuild the Vice-Consulate house and offices entirely, when satisfactory arrangements with the owners of the cultivation rights have been made, and that meanwhile authority should be given for the preparation of plans and estimates for the new buildings. 8. Mr. Gardener and Captain Bazalgette recommend that if this proposal is approved, the new house and offices should be separate. The office should be built on Hot E. facing the road, and the house near its present position, but further back from the river, to allow for the widening of the boulevard which is being constructed along the river front. I concur in the arrangement of the buildings suggested by Vr. Gardener and Captain Bazalgette, as summarised above. In this connection I have the honour to enclose a translation of a note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that eight metres of the garden /will- 6 - vill eventually 'oe inquired Tor the houlevard* It is possible that this widening of the boulevard aay be indefinitely postponed* but if anc*. when It is carried out* it will bring the house* on its present site, right up to the road* a fact which provides a further argument for rebuilding it. Captain Bazalgette has pointed out that if land is In the event taken for the purpose of thi® widening* it might perhaps be possible to negotiate in exchange the sui*render of the lane which at present bisect® the property, and which appears to serve no useful purpose# 10. The* reconstruction of the Vice-Consulate will prolong for at least two or three years the problem of the accommodation of the Vice-Consul. This problem i® at present acute, since Captain Ba^algette with hi® wife and two children and nurse are occupying a house with two bedrooms, dining-rooia, upswing-room and small of lice. I have been giving further consideration to the possibility of obtaining better accommodation for Captain Baz-algette, and on this point I am reporting separately in my telegram (&gt;7. Ko. 41 of to-day’s date. 11, In conclusion I would refer to the Kxpress Letter from the External Affairs Department of the Government of India to the Honourable the rolitical Resident in the P.l.Persian Gulf of the 15th arch, (ho. F.41-A/38), regarding the payment for* the repairs to the building® and a possible abatement of rent. The question of a possible reduction in the rent was also mentioned in your telegram $o. 16 of the 26th ?ebz*uary. As stated in paragraph 4 of iay desuatch No. 357 of the 14th duly, 1956, the present rent for the property, no more than £47 at the official rate of exchange, is undoubtedly extremely small in view of the general level of rents in present-day Iran. It seems certain that it /waswas only the special relationship eyisting between the late Sheikh and His Malesty’s aorernment and the Government of Tndla which withheld him from greatly increasing the rent# In view of this relationship and of the smallness of the rent which has been paid for so many years, I trust that no request for an abatement of rent will now be considered necessary# I feel sure that the €*ffect of such a request would be very unhelpful. Further, I would venture to evnrese the opinion that no useful purpose would be served by endeavouring to hold the heirs to the terms of the 1092 lease regarding repairs. It seems certain that it would be quite impossible to extract from the heirs, whose position is most involved, the relatively large sums now required, even if the terns of the 1699 lease could now be enforced, or are applicable tc the complete rebuilding of the property, which seems doubtful# '’he point of cardinal importance is to ensure that Hia Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr is again suitably housed at the earliest possible moment# Any demand that the Sheikh's heirs should pay for repairs would undoubtedly cause endless delay, and could, I feel sure, produce no useful result. I hope therefore th&amp;t His Majesty's Government and the Government of India will be able to agree that no such demand should be made. 18* I ara sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department (No. 80), to the Kon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (No. 99), and to His Majesty's Consular Officers at \hwaz (Po. 54), and at A hor r a ms hf ihrEnclosure No« 1 in Tehran despatch Ho. 163 dated April 23rd, ^938, to the Foreign Office* , “—t—rs3H—l HIS MAJESTY 1 3 VICE OOHSUnATE AT KEOmx^mmftr ' The q uestion of the ownership of the site occupied hy His Majesty*s Vice Consulate at Xhorramshahr is oomplilcated between the ownership of the land itself and the ownership of the hereditary right to cultivate the land and of the trees and property shown on the attached plan, the whole of the land., belonged to the Sheikh of Mohammerah and has presumably passed court a nd servants^ q uarters, the Sheikh had the exclusive ownership of both la nd and cultivation rights over a plot of only 2262.243 square metres, about half of which is occupied by the house itself* Most of the Vice Consulate garden consists of three plots the areas of which are shown on the attached plan, on which the ownership of the right to cultivate belongs to three men named Sayid Hamad, q, alaf and Laft.

It seems clear however that no complaint would have )een made against Bo, but for incidents arising from the housing. Dear Gibson, ft 6&gt; |J^‘ Many thanks for the letter P.Z.1585/38 which you sent to me on the 10th March about the consular accommodation at Mohammerah and for your official letter P.Z.1968/38 of the 24th March on the same subject. Since writing to me you will have seen a copy of Tehran telegram No. 32 of the 19th March which, besides discussing the position about the lease, indicated that the vice-consul was happily installed in a small house belonging to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and that a larger house belonging to a private owner might soon become available. It seemed, therefore, that the question of Captain Bazalgette^ personal accommodation was more or less settled. I now, however, enclose copies of two further telegrams from Tehran, which suggest that Bazalgette has got J.P. Gibson, Esq.got at loggerheads with the company over this question and bear out what Mr, Mylles said to you, namely that the company would like the vice-consul to move out of their property fairly soon. We hope that, as Butler* s telegram No. 34 suggests, the irritation which Bazalgette appears to have caused is little more than a storm in a tea-cup, since, as you know, our relations with the Anglo—Iranian Oil Company are of considerable importance to us. We trust, indeed, that the personalfhctor has very little to do with the position and that the company merely wish to get rid of Bazalgette in due course for the reasons given by Mr. Mylles. You will notice that Butler* s telegrams are written under the guarded impression, derived from the Anglo—Iranian Oil Company locally, that you have agreed to solve the problem of personal accommodation by replacing Bazalgette by a bachelor who could live at the vice—consulate. We assume, however, from your letter that no such decision has yet been reached, although you may of course ultimately be forced to consider it. Perhaps you will be good enough to let meme know what the position is. It is of course important for the legation to know exactly what has happened over this and on the information at present at his disposal Butler is, as you see from his telegram No, 34, not particularly happy about the way the company appear to have acted. I should explain in connexion with this telegram that Gardener, our consul at Ahwaz, is expected to be on leave from April to September and that we have arranged for a junior vice-consul, to take charge at Ahwaz during his absence, Bazalgette, for reasons of seniority, being regarded as temporarily independent of Ahwaz. As you will see from Butler* s telegram, it would not suit us at all for Bazalgette to be replaced by a new man while Ahwaz was in acting hands, so we hope that nothing will be done in this direction at any rate for the present. With regard to the question which you put to me in your letter of the 10th March, the answer, I am afraid, is that we see no chance whatever of being able to persuade the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to allot thethe Khazalieh house to the vice-consul and do not think it would even be worth while to approach them on the subject. One thing indeed emerges from the recent correspondence and that is that the vice-consul, quite apart from any personal factor, is clearly not regarded by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company as a welcome guest and his continued dependence on the Company 1 s hospitality cannot be good for the position of the vice-consulate* -f 2Copy.

Finsbury Circus. London. E.C. 2 . 85 7th March, 1958* Dear Mr. Gibson, With reference to my call on you of the 4th instant, as agreed I give you herewith a brief description of the situation existing at Khorramshahr so long as the Vice-Consul occupies one of our houses. In the town of Khorramshahr it is extremely difficult for a person living on anything approaching a European standard to obtain suitable housing. This difficulty affects particularly Iranian officials from Tehran and the Iraq Vice-Consul. We have been approached by them on various occasions with proposals for leasing or purchasing some of our houses in Khorramshahr. In the past we have been able to turn down these proposals on the grounds that our houses have been built only by virtue of our concessional privileges with regard to land purchase. Customs exemptions, &amp;c., and in consequence they must be reserved for the purposes of our concession, such as the accommodation of our own employees. Since we have accommodated our Vice-Consul, the Governor of Khorramshahr and the Iraq Vice-Consul have again approached us with inconvenient proposals for leasing or purchasing some of our bungalows in Khorramshahr for their own accommodation. Further, owing to a big increase in our activities we are ourselves rather short of accommodation. In order to house the Vice-Consul we have had to move one of our married staff from Khorramshahr to Abadan and allocate to him a bungalow there which would otherwise have been available for the accommodation of our senior Iranian staff. If the Vice-Consul required the accommodation only for a short period, these difficulties could of course be dealt with, but if a considerable time must elapse before other accommodation is available for him, we shall be rather embarrassed in dealing with requests from Iranian Government officials and the Iraq Vice-Consul. [TIcd7p2l E-l/T. - 9 mar 1938 1 IMP... ''ICE Contd...A2W-C. 4 37. (g$) Continuation : Page 2. I might say that the arrangement for leasing a bungalow at Ahwaz to His Majesty 1 s Consul, although similar in ^ principle,is not exactly a precedent, as the accommodation is not required either by Iranian officials owing to its situation or by ourselves owing to a reduction of staff at that centre; if the particular bungalow was not occupied by His Majesty 1 s Consul, it would otherwise stand empty. Similarly, in the case of the Imperial Bank of Iran, the Bank building and the Bank Manager’s house were specially built to the Bank’s own design solely for their own purposes and are not part of our accommodation. present Consular building at Khorramshahr so as to make it fit for occupation by a married occupant or, alternatively, decide to build a new Consulate, a long period must elapse before the Vice- Consul could vacate the bungalow in which he is now living. We therefore suggest for your consideration that until suitable Consular accommodation is available at Khorramshahr, you might appoint a bachelor to the position. It is the opinion of our Management in Iran that a bachelor could live in the present Consular building, provided that the servants’ quarters were rebuilt. Foreign Office for the position to be reconsidered by H.M. Minister in Tehran and accordingly I will ask our Representative there to see the Minister and represent to him the situation in Khorramshahr as it affects us. It appears that whether you decide to repair the I understand that you will arrange through the Yours sincerely. J.P. Gibson Esq.

It is of course true that His Majesty , s Government in the dnited kingdom have no valid lease for the present site, and the persistent efforts which I have been making to clear up with the Iranian Government the uncertainty as to the ownership of the property, with a view to renewal of the lease, have not so far proved successful. I will of course continue these efforts, but there are reasons which causti me to doubt their early fruition. I appreciate that pending a satisfactory reply from the Iranian Government there is always a risk of our being forced to abandon the property at reasonable or even at short notice, out? 1 think that the fact that we had expended money on it would constitute at least some obligation on the Iranian Government either to let us continue our tenure or at least to renew the lease until we had been able to find accommodation elsewhere. r ° m f n alternative which I think both Mr. Gardener and ^apt-in Baaalgette would welcome would be the acquisition of the j£hazalieh house to serve as Jonsular residence and office.

Before we had taken any action on your letter Mr.Elkington, of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, telephoned to Baggallay to say that the latest news the Company had received from Persia about the Consulate buildings at Khorramshahr was that the servants f quarters had been entirely demolished by the floods, although the main building was more or less undamaged. The main building was, however, extremely dilapidated, and the cost of putting it into a state of repair and rebuilding the servants r quarters was estimated at £2,500.

Mr. Ellcington, of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, has since been in telephone communication with us and as a result of what he said we should like to send the attached draft reply to Tehran. The reason for the Company’s reluctance to let Bazalgette stay on in the Khazalieh house or for the office to be in any of their bungalows is because they live in constant apprehension of the Persian authorities, in particular Colonel Bayendor, taking the opportunity of the Company not using their houses for their own purposes to interfere with their property. In view of the organisation and administration of the Vice-Consulate at Khorramshahr it is, we fully realise, for you to take the initiative in such a question J.P. Gibson Esq 26 JAN 1938 ‘ ,4 INDIA OFFICEas has now arisen. We have ventured, however, in this case, instead of putting Blkington off and referring him to you, to act as we have in order to save time and trouble. Will you let me know if you agree in the proposed reply to Tehran? As regards the question of the repairs to the Vice- Consulate, Elkington offered, and we accepted his offer, to telegraph to their General Manager to find out more exactly what was needed as there appeared to he some discrepancy in what they had been told by their people in Iran and what Seymour says in his telegram. I will let you know as soon as we hear again from Elkington.

We have had no reply to the letter to Ansarie asking to whom the rent should be paid. We have not reminded him, as it seemed up to the Iranian Government to take the next step. But as five months have now gone by, we feel that we must show that we are still anxious to pay the rent a qui de droit , and the matter will therefore be mentioned to Ansarie at the next opportunity. 3. As far as the Iranian authorities are concerned, the only development since March has been that in April the Governor of Abadan sent fur the Vice-Consulate Munshi and questioned him about the buildings. He asked when they were built, and with whose permission: what title deeds existed, to whom was rent paid, and was it paid in Iran or abroad. Bazalgette told the Munshi to ask that these questions should be put in writing. The Governor telegraphed to Tehran for instructions, and as far as we know nothing more has been heard from him. 4. Meanwhile a new complication has arisen, namely that Gardener has reported that the existing building is in an extremely bad condition. The following is an extract from his letter:- ”Furthermore/ The Consular Department The Foreign Office, London, S.W.l.'Furthermore there is another aspect of this housing problem which so far as I am aware has not as yet been made sufficiently prominent. This is the state of repair of the house. It is a mud structure of which the oldest portion dates back for fifty years. Since then various additions have been made. As a result the house although very pleasant is difficult to run. This does not matter but what is important is its state of repair. A mud house cannot be expected to last much longer than forty or fifty years. At present the floors and ceilings are uneven and the walls are crumbling and sinking. If we do secure a renewal of the lease we shall soon be faced with an extensive re-building programme. I anticipate considerable difficulty in getting an Iranian owner to carry out such a programme and we shall probably have to do it ourselves.' Gardener therefore suggested that we should consider acquiring the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company^ house known as Khazalieh, which is now used as a rest-house, and which is a good house, though large for a Vice-Consulate. We discussed this question with Clegg who was recently acting as Tehran Representative. But he said that the Company did not want to give up any of their Khorramshahr property, and that in any case they held that they were precluded from selling any of their property in Iran by the clause in the Concession requiring that they should hand it all over to the Iranian authorities at the expiry of their Concession. Although we do not feel convinced that this interpretation of the Concession is correct, there seems no point in pursuing at/at present the suggestion that we should lease or huy the Khazalieh house. But in view of the uncertainty about the lease of the present Vice-Consulate house and of the livelihood that the house will soon have to be entirely re-built, we thinV that we ought to consider all other possible sites at Khorramshahr, whether with or without existing houses. We are therefore asking Stewart to let j us have a comprehensive report on this point. 5. We are sending copies of this letter to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department No. 141, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad No. 61, to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf No. 62, to His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz No. 38 and to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr under cover of letter No. 159/9/37.

Sir, Ivith reference to my despatch Ho*28 of the 22nd January, I have the honour to inform you that the First HUxiBhl of this negation has had several interviews with honsieur Keshvari.the lawyer representing the principal heirs of the late Sheikh of Kahoinmerah,regarding the renewal of the lease of His Majesty’s Vice-consulate at Khorramshahr. Monsieur Keshvari has now informed };r. liaimi that the negotiations for the exchange of the late Sheikh’s proper ties in the south for others in the north of Iran,are now in full swing. fhe heirs of the late Sheikh have been forbidden to enter into any traiisactions affecting the properties in the south without the Government’s concent, which has not been given. Mr. Mai-ii gained the impression that there was little hope that the heirs would renew the lease. He was specially asked by Monsieur Keshvari that the latter’s name should not be mentioned in any discussions with the Iranian authorities regarding the Vice-consulate property. 2. In these circumstances no other course appears possible than to approach the Ministry for Foreign Affairs with a request for assistance in obtaining a new lease. A convenient reason for raising the matter is now available, since the rent for the year ending 31st March 1937 will snortly fall due,and in the absence of any announcement regarding the division of the sheikh’s estate,His Majesty’s Vice-Consul does not know to whom the rent should be paid. The Right Honourable, Anthony CdenM.C., II.P., etc., etc., etc., FORkXGL* OF/ICB. ' 1 iM - 2 - 2feV He has therefor© asked ra© for instructions.

From hia eventual reply it should be possible to Judge what steps can best be taken next. I fear that it is likely that the Iranian Government may maxe difficulties over the renewal of the lease. r fhe Shah is however believdd to desire the removal of the naval base from Khorramsh&amp;hr to Bandar Shahpur and if this is sOjthe idea with which Colonel Bayendor is credited that the Vice-consulate property should be made into a residence for the coma&amp;mer of the Iranian h&amp;vy may not appeal to him. 3.

Companies, mercantile administration suoh as Lynch Bros orother foreign mer chants have no right to ask for such a rate. This favour to the Consulate is not to he a precedent for merchants. His Britannic ‘ uu ajesty s Consul has agreed to under take ohe following repairs at his own expenses such as plastering the roof and repairing the doors an&lt;r windows and cleaning and painting the rooms and walls. If a room or a wall falls down, or the dam in front of the building to be broken by water, His excellency will make the necessary repairs. A man will be appointed from the Consulate to supervise along with a man from His Excellency all matters concerning the building. o CoGopy of extract of letter dated 2nd September 1909 from i.ieut. A.T.Wilson, Mohammerah, to Major Trevor. The only lease recognized 'by the Sheikh is that of which I enclose a translation. I have seen the original, signed hy the Sheikh, Marguzar and McDouall and dated 1892. There is however no copy of this lease to he found here, and McDouall cannot enlighten me about itJ He told me verbally that rt he did remember something of the sort, hut did not know where it was*. In the meanwhile, the original of the lease translated hy McDouall and sent to Bushire has disappeared from this oflioe records. McDouall could not find it, nor his clerk. The lease of which 1 enclose a copy is more favour able to us, as it allows us to build as we like, at our own cost, and mentions no time limit, whereas the old lease had a time a limit. From the enclosed lease the limit of the Sheikh*s responsibility is quite clear, and in the present case the Sheikh has incurred expenses considerably over and above his legal obligations, and has repaired the rojf and of. f 9re(l to repair the veranda free of charge.■ 8a 16654/3? 7th August 193?o Gentlemen 25 fto kiotor Launch -for British Vice-Consul at Knorramahahr 0 Irano With reference to Admiralty letter C©Bo16654/o? of 18th June p X have to inform you that no objection is raised to the General Arrangement drawing F lines drawing and cooling arrangement submittedo I have to request that you will quote for the supply of what you consider to be an adequate allowance of raachinery spare 'gear© I am p Gentlemen?

The state of the engine entails a very heavy consumption of fuel and oil, 4. further extensive repairs have become necessary and the Vice-Oonsul has obtained a report, of which a copy Is enclosed, from the Engineering Department of 1esopotamia Iran Corporation Limited, Lasrah. The re pairs are estimated to cost lra.i Linars 220 (£ 220 ster ling), and even then no guarantee can be given that the launch would work satisfactorily for any length of time. In the opinion of the Corporation's engineer the age and condition of the launch do not justify the incurring of heavy expenditure on repairs. 5. The necessity cf a launch lor the /ice-Consul, khorramshahr, has been recognised in the past and still continues. The Yice-Oonsuiatie is not connected by road to Khorramshahr ard Voahan and continual visits have to be paid to ships in the stream. 5. it is estimated that the cost of a new launch suitable for the Vice-Consul would be about &amp; 320/- in cluding freight, and customs duty.

In view of the recommendation made for the re purchase and maintenance of the launch, Dr.Lincoln, finding that a provision of is. 4000/- for tne purpose had teen included in the sanctioned estimates for the current year, charged the cost of upkeep oi tne launch from the 1st April 1920 to Government against the said provision.

Though payment for the launch was not made till Fovemher 1930, the launch virtually belonged to Government from the time they accepted the proposal for its repurchase and submitted the ratter for the Secretary of State’s approval, a view which is supported hy the fact that funds were provided for its upkeep. In the above circumstances I would as^v that the Government or India will be pleased to reconsider their orders and to sanction that the maintenance of the launch should be charged against the provision in Question from the 1st April, 1930.

On the abolition of his quarcintine duties it is unuerstood that the Government refused to maintain the launch, which was eventually put up to auction and bought in by Doctor Lincoln for the use of the Vice-Consul. The launch is now very inadequately maintainea from private funds, no definite provision being made therefor by the Government of India. The continued provision of this launch and its proper maintenance is evident to any one who knows the local conditions. His Majesty's Vice-Consul has occasionaxly to visit His Majesty's Ships and it would be extremely infru. aig., if the Vice-Consul was compelled to take a hired bellum for the purpose. On a recent occasion the presence of His Majesty's Shi^ Cyclamen was considered urgently necessary and the Vice-Consul haa to proceed a certain distance to confer with the Commander, a trip which is in the i circumstances obtaining it was undesirable to make too openly. Haa his launch not been available the use or a hired bellum would have entitled considerable delay and wuuld have been known all over the town in a short while. It is absolutely essential that the launch should be kept up adequately and reauy for all emergencies. At present every time the Vice-Consul has to visit Abadan he has to rexy on the good offices or the GeneralGeneral Manager of the Company for a Cctr. This is really derogatory to his prestige vis-a-vis the Company and it is a fact that both the Company and the locaj. Persian Authorities are inclined to wonaer at the parsimony of the Government responsible for this absurd state of affairs.COFY. 7421/2050/234) E.6373/6. Treasury Chambers, Whitehall, loth June, 1930 * Dear Sherwood, with reference to your letters of the loth and 17th ultimo (K 4848/2050/234) and (K 4558/2050/234) H relative to the ice-Consul at Mohammerah, the proposal as regards the Launch is to buy a second hand craft for £75, (approximately), the cost of running which is £225 per annum (approximately). Haan 1 t this topic better wait over until the question of the Basra launch is settled? Mohammerah and Basra are adjacent and the officers will expect the saiae treatment in this matter. I may say, however, that the case for an ' official launch does not appear to be exceptionaxly strong. Have you any further information additionax to the extract from Vice-Consul Brennan’s memorandum? what w^s the amount of the previous launch grant when Lincoln was Quarantine Officer? The purchase price proposed is presumably reasonabxe for a second hana boat but the cost of renewal will be heavy ir the Basra proposal is any guiue (£773 proposed purchase price). With regard to the proposed alteration in Lincoln 1 s emoluments may we have a copy of the despatch of 2lst May 1928, to which reference is maue in the letter from the Government of India of 20th January 19o0. The present L. R. Sherwood, Esq., O.B.E., Foreign Office.present proposal is that, although the quarantine duties have ceased, he should nevertheless continue to draw the emoluments which he previously dre*. for the performance or those duties, (less 30 rupees a month for which a greater and separate provision is suggested). The reason for the proposal is that since an outside body made him a grant equivalent to the quoirc*ntine pay lost and this grant muat no., cease public funus must find it in the future. I should hardly have thought that tne increased responsibility attached to the post (paragraph 5 of letter of 20 th January) justified so large an audition to pay etc, as Rs. 220 a month. «e are not usually sticky over India 1 s pro^osaxs for the Persian Consulates but in this case I should be glau if you would look into what is proposed in the light of the foregoing.

HOUSBB. Dr. Lincoln who a't present holds the post states that he does not altogether agree with the opinions ^ of Mr. Vice Consul Brenan and Captain Fletcher that M the building is dilapidated, insanitary, unhealthy and subject to flooding 5 '. It certainly is # an old building and does not compare favourably with the more modern houses of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, but at the same time it is spacious with large grounds, and garden and tennis cour o, outhouses for the menial establishment and has accommodation for the Consulate Office. While I personally should not describe the house as spacious, the grounds are pleasant and it is very well situated on the Karun. The house is an adapted Arab house, .and I think it couldtbe improved at a very moderate cost by a few alterations ana additions as Dr. Lincoln himself suggests He further adds that there is no other suitable house which can be purchased or leased from the Anglo Persian Oil Company, and the only real alternative is to build a new Consulate. This is it does not seem worth while doing until a decision has been arrived at regarding the future status of the post, and the readjustment of Consular charges in 3. I kjfcl ;&gt;• c&gt; ffiC) 3. Electric light and fans are of course an aosolU'.e necessity and as Dr. Lincoln points out the ^onsula-e is v^e only house of any standing in .bharnmerah which has no u o-ie modern conveniences. 4 . I am asking Dr. Lincoln to submit urgently nis detailed estimates for such alterations and additions as he considers necessary, and to ascertain from the Anglo Persian Oil Company what they would charge for supplying the Vice- Consulate with electric light and fans. 5 # In this connection I venture to stress the fact that the official residence of the Political Agent, Kuwait (vide correspondence ending with ;oy letter Ko. 2927 of 22 nd December) is a worse house than that of the Vice-Consul, I lb hammer ah, and is likewise without electric light.and fans. I trust that my recommendation on the suoject of the xvuwait house will receive your sympathetic consideration. 6 . The question of the launch has already been referred to the Government of India separately, and I will merely say that in my opinion it is essential that the Vice- Consul should be provided with a launch, for which he should receive a suitable grant from Government. Gar. Dr. Lincoln concurs with £r.

I have the honour to be with the highest respect, &amp;c., (Sd) R.H.CLIVE. The Right Honourable Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.G., M.P., THE FOREIGN OFFICE.J '.-'OixdLi.xSRAIi • The present official residence and office of His . -ajesty ’ s Vice Consul is a 'building facing the creek which was leased 'by Doctor Lincoln when he load to evacuate the house formerly occupied by him when Quarantine Officer. The building is dilapidated, insanitary, unhealthy and subject at times to flooding. The rooms are small and the walls bulge and show streaks of mildew. Despite a fairly good electric light supply in the town the Vice-Consulate is without electric light or fans, and is probably the only house of any standing in the town without tiiese amenities so essential to health and comfort in that climate. It is understood that there would be no difficulty in obtaining either by purchase or lease very much more suitable premises from the Anglo-Fersian Oil Company. It viTas for instance recently suggested that His llajesty’s Consul at Ahwaz should temporarily be transferred to Mohammerah and Mr.Jacks offered to arrange for a suitable house. In view of the possibility of Mohammerah becoming a backwater owing to the development of tne railway and Bander Shapur it would be preferable at present to lease a building. Tne present Vice-Consulate and any house eventually leased lies on the side of the creek opposite to the main roaa to Abadan. The Vice-Consul when he visits Abadan or Ahwaz has to cross the creek to the opposite side whence he takes a car. When Doctor Lincoln, the substantive Vice-Consul of the post, was Quarantine officer he maintained a launch. On the abolition of his quarantine duties it is understood that the Government refused to maintain the launch, which was eventuallyeventually put up to auction and bought in by Doctor Lincoln for the use of the Vice-Consul. The launch is now very inadequately maintained from private funds, no definite provision being made therefor by the Government of India. I The need for the continued provision of this launch and i*s proper maintenance is evident to any one who knows the local conditions. i^is Majesty’s Vice-Consul has occasionally to visit iiis majesty f s Ships and it would be extremely infra dig., if t,_ e Vice-Consul was compelled to take a hired bellum for the purpose. On a recent occasion the presence of His Majesty*s Ship Cyclamen vas considered urgently necessary and the Vice- Consul nad to proceed a certain distance to confer with the Cor,ki ' ander » a tri P which is in the circumstances obtaining it Was uncl - esir &amp;ble to make too openly. Had his launch not been available the use of a hired bellum would have entailed considerable delay and would have been known all over the town in a short while. It is absolutely essential that the Launch should be kept up adequately and ready for all emergencies. At present every time the Vice-Consul has to visit Abadan he has to rely on the good offices of the General Manager of the Company for a car. This is really derogatory to his prestige vis-a-vis the Company and it is a fact that both the Company and the local Persian Authorities are inclined to wonder at the parsimony of the Government responsible for this absurd state of affairs. io summarise, it is urgently necessary in the interests of prestige, good health and good relations that the Vice-Consul at Hohammerah be provided as soon as possible with a decent house for his residence and office with suitable appurtenances, electric light and current for fans from the tov~n supply, that his launch be budgeted for and the crew thereof bebe provided with suitable uniforms and that the Vice-Consul be given an allowance for a car and its garaging on the main land.p '■p&gt;f e Gi-i PUT / No.215, dated Bushire, the 4th February 1912. From - Li eut enant-C olonel Sir Percy Cox, K.0.1,E.,C .S.I. , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To - The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry McMahon, G.C.V.O. K.C.1 .L.,C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. I have the honour to forward for the consideration and orders of the Government of India, copy of the letter noted in on the subject of the accoiafiodation at the I'ohamrr.erah Consulate. The facts and figures cited by Faj or Haworth speak for themselves; the altered conditions of the town of Mohammerah are matters of common knowledge, and due as they are entirely to British enterprise, present a legitimate source of satisfaction. We have, moreover, every reason to hope for a continuation and further development by the agency of British capital of the prosperity of Arabistan. Under these circumstances I venture to express a strong hope that Government will be pleased to accept the proposals submitted, which appear to me no more than adequate for the object in view, namely, to bring the standard of the premises occupied by the British Consular representative up to the level of those already provided for their principal employes by private firms. No .36 dated Mohammerah, the 18th January 1912. From - Major L.3.H.Haworth, I.A., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Arabistan, To - The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to address you with reference to His Majesty’s Consulate at Mohammerah, which is quite unsuited for the purposes for which it is intended. I attach, herewith, dated 18th the margin, from the Assistant Resident and Consul, Mo hammerah, January 1912. planplans of the building marked 'A' which wi+hout further comment would show that the accommodation is inadequate. I will however go into some details in order to point out the various shortcomings complained of, but before doing so it may be desirable to show why this Consulate which has been here for so many years has now become unable to supply the wants which it has hitherto met. When the Mohammerah Consulate District was first instituted some twenty years ago and until two years ago there were hardly any Europeans in the place, ft most 2 or 3, and those not always of a class which would ordinarily have the entry of Consulate functions. At times a few travellers passed through but of these the majority would prefer if possible to stay at Basrah. To-day things are very different. At the official Consulate dinners 20 to 30 people are entertained. At the Durbar dinner there were 31, notwithstanding some 5 or 6 absentee while of others for whom it was ^ot considered th- t an invitation to the Consulate was necessary 14 were entertained by the Anglo- Persain Oil Company. In addition to this there is generally some visitor by the mail, sometimes two or even four apart from officials, and there is nowhere for them to go except to the C onsul. It wil be seen then that the place has greatly grown and with it the requirements of the Consulate. The former Consul war content to live in more or less Arab fashion, a state of affairs which, possible in the then stagnant condition of Mohammerah, could hardly be maintained with a growing European community. Lieutenant Wilson, who acted for me here, was a young officer direct from the Army and accustomed to a subaltern quarters, yet he complained of the Consulate and applied for sums to improve its accomnodation. Government placed at his disposal a sum of As .1,000, with which he made the house habitable. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Imperial Bank of PersiaftPersia have built new and good residences for their staff, and when these are completed in two or three months’ time, Hie Majesty’s Consul will not be as well housed as the Junior Accountant of the Bank, and the remarks of visitbre and passers- by are becoming frequent on the subject of the housing of His Majesty’s representative. My Mirza informs me that it is a frequent comment in the bazaar that it is curious that while Companies build good houses for their employes the great English Government has not built a good house for the Consul. It will be seen that I have but one reception room. In this one room I am obliged to entertain European gentlemen and ladies and receive Persian visitors; when ladies are staying in the house v/ith me they are obliged to retire to their bedrooms while I interview the Shaikh or any other Persian official. From the plan if will be seen that I have but one spare bedroom; when other guests arrive I am obliged to empty the tent godown, which is a good room, and put my guest there, while the tents encumber the verandah. Additional guests are offered the cabin in my launch; a further inconvenience for a married man is that there is no dressing room to the Consul’s bedroom. In the winter the temperature falls to 30°, yet guests have to come out of a warm sitting room and pass out into the open air down steps which can only be described as eccentric to reach the dining room. I am already erecting a small shelter to keep off the wet; on Durbar day the ladies were forced to go out into the rain to arrive ft their dinner, a proceeding which no lady in an expensive dress could view with equanimity. There being ^o verandah on the south side of the house or indeed on any side except the north, the office becomes a hot house in the summer, the temperature inside the room reaching 103° while the temperature in the drawing room has touched the same h eight. There are no servants’ quarters and J have been obliged to giveIf give my married, servants mat huts, while allowing two small rooms in the Consulate for the unmarried men. The Consular escort are still in tents. I think that I have said sufficient to prove that it is necessary that something should be done immediately both for the comfort of Kis Majesty’s Consul and the name of the Government, and I would accordingly put forward the following proposals. As at present constituted the Head Clerk and the Kirza each receive Es.20 per mensem for house-rent, for this sum they are totally unable to obtain any accommodation whatsoever. House- rent in Mohammerah as may be expected in a place which has grov/n so rapidly is exorbitant, and the complete monopoly possessed by the Sheikh and Kaji Rais does not tead to lower it. I would then suggest that the Head Clerk and the Mirza be both accommodated in the present Consulate. The Mirza could have the upstairs office and bedroom and the teat godown below it. The Head Clerk could have the spare bedroom, dining room and one smal' 1 . room downstairs, together with a kitchen. This would leave me the present drawing room, bathroom and hall upstairs as my public office and court room, while the remaining rooms could, as noi'v, act as godowns, my cresent private store room being released for the Post Office. The rental of the Consulate is 315 krans per men sea, which at the average rate for the last year works out at Rs.85 per mensem. Were tfoe Head Clerk and the Mirza accommodated as suggested the Rs.40 now paid to them for house rent would cease, thus cancelling that amount of the Consulate rental and leaving Rs.45 to be found. Of this Rs.45 the Post Office Department pays Rs.lQ for the Post Office, which would leave but Rs.27 as rental for the office and godowns. I may state that the Consulate has the lowest rental of any building in Moh aimer ah and could readily let at Rs.150 p«r mensem in present circumstances. i TheThe above proposals would entai] the building of Renew Consulate for Hie Majesty’s Consul. fhat is required is a house good for both cold and hot weather, I attach plans, marked 'B', 'C m and 'D M of a suitable building which I have designed. The drawing room and dining room 26’ by 18’ are not too large for the entertaining required, moderately big rooms are necessary to give air: in the hot weather, it becomes very unpleasant in the rooms in the preoent Consulate. The size I have selected is the same as the Oil Company’s billiard room and would be suitable for the purpose. There are rooms of similar dimensions in the married quarters of the Abadan Kefinery. The main hall is made especially large to provide a cool place protected from exposure to the sun in the hot weather. This is founded on the Basrah Consulate where such a hall has been a great success. There has been a considerable amountof building at Mohammerah and Abadan this year and it is possible to determine fairly accurately what such a house would cost. The Bank Manager’s house with rather smaller accommodation but the same number of rooms has cost under £2,000 and - ith filling up of ground, levelling, etc., has totalled £2,500. Its area is 90’ by 60’ as opposed to 78’ by 74’ in the designs 1 forward. The rooms above the kitchen would only be built should funds a dm i t. I calculate that this house could be finished including sowars and servants’ quarters with stables for a total sum of £3,000, or Rs.45,000. Mohaumerah is an expensive place for building since all bricks and material have to be imported from Basrah. I would propose to put the new house on the site alongside the present building (vide plan attached marked ”A M ) and about 40 feet from it. This would entail knocking down the present PostPost Office end the rooms now used by the servants, these are all small and could easily be dispensed with, beinr badly built. The actual land on which the house would stand is included in the present rental and the Sheikh would let us he^e it indefinitely. I would propose fining up the land to low watermark, which would give a good deal of additional ground to the house and would cost Hs.3,000. The garden at the back of the Consulate and enclosed with it does not belong to us. This I should propose hiring at a monthly rental of Hs.7-8-0 on a 30 year lease. It may be considered necessary to have the plans examined and an estimate made by an officer of the Public Works Department in which case I would request that the matter may be considered as urgent since building can only be done in the summer, and it is far from pleasant passing a hot weather in the present building with its low roofed rooms and limited accommodation. If the work is not completed this sum er it will entail my passing two more hot weathers as at present. No.10, dated Bushire, the 24 + h March 191?. Prom- J.3.Wood, Esq .,C.I.L., To - The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colon el Dir Henry McMahon,G.C .V.O . K.C.1.E.,C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla . As desired by the Government of India I have examined the question of the necessity for a new Consulate building for Mohammerah. 2. The defects of the present building are graphically described in Major Haworth’s letter No.36 dated the 18th January 1912, which does not materially overstate the case. There arc really only two decent rooms in the house, namely, the drawing-room and the bed-room, on the first floor, and even these are too small for comfort, being only 11 feet broad. The bed-room has no bath-room or dressing-room attached to it and is quite unsuited for occupation for a married couple, while thedrpwing-room, which is the only plrce for receiving visitors, contains sitting accommodation for at most 8 or 10 people. There is also an office room on the first floor v/hich is comfortable enough'- in the morning, but is intolerably hot in the afternoon owing to the absence of a south verandah. !''one of thet rooms in the house are more than 9 feet high. The rooms on the ground floor are damp and dark and the water percolates through the floor in the rainy season. There is a spare bed-room on this floor, but it is certainly not suitable for occupation by Europeans, while the dining room is wholly inadequate for entertaining even private guests. The Consul is expected to entertain, rnd receives a sumptuary allowance for this purpose. If he is to entertain properly, he needs dining ~and recention rooms of adequate size and not subject to flooding in rainy weather . Apart from the practical drawbacks of the present Consulate building, it is open to the objection that in comparison with the spacious buildings recently erected by the Imperial Bank and Anglo-Persian Cil Company, it presents a singularly mean and shabby appearance. I think therefore that the construction of a new Consulate building must be regarded as a necessity with reference both to the comfort of the Consul and to the maintenance of his dignity as the British representative at this important post . 3. I am a little doubtful as to the suitability of the site proposed by Major Haworth for the new Consulate building, and a rough estimate given by him requires further elaboration. The Political Resident will address the Government of India further on these points. In the meantime I would suggest that the necessity for a new Consulate be recognised and that His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India be informed accordingly. It will then be possible, on receipt of the final estimate, to obtain his sanction by telegram. 4. A copy of this letter is being given to the Political Resident for his information.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000be_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3628</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000be</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3628</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 29/53 'Khorramshahr (Mohammerah): house, launch, motor car, office accommodation'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1912/1947</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-09-19T08:56:22</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (372 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 374; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns the Vice-Consulate at Mohammerah [Khorramshahr, Iran].The file contains correspondence related to:donation of land for sixty years from Shaikh of Mohammerah to build a consulate, 1912provision of accommodation, office, and car for Vice-Consul, 1929costs of alterations and repairs, and installation of electric lights and fans to the Vice-Consulate building, 1930provision of motor launches for Vice-Consul, 1931 and 1937temporary evacuation of Vice-Consulate for fire, 1935lease of Vice-Consulate premises at Khorramshahr, 1936repairs to Vice-Consulate building damaged by 1937 floods, and lease of living quarters from Anglo-Persian Oil Company, 1938removal of Vice-Consul, Reginald Lewis Bazalgette, for contrasting views related to his accommodation, 1938proposals to rebuild the Vice-Consulate and the residential accommodation for Vice-Consul, 1939-42decision to purchase two houses from Anglo-Persian Oil Company, 1945purchase of a new motor launch, 1947.The file is composed of correspondence between the British Vice-Consulate at Mohammerah, the British Legation at Tehran; the Viceroy; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the British Consulate at Ahwaz; the Government of India; the Office for the High Commissioner for India; the Foreign Office; and the India Office.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Vice-Consulate</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consulate, Ahwaz</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Building maintenance</topic></subject><subject><topic>Donations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000be#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
