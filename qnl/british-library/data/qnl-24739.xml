WITH reference to my telegram No. 52 of to-day’s date, I have the honour to forward to you herewith copy ot the aide-memoire which I handed to the Persian Government on the LO.th November last, inviting their acceptance of the right of the commission which is to be formed for the improvement of the Shatt-el-Arab to levy dues on Persian vessels m those waters. I also enclose copy of a letter which 1 have now received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, giving cover to a note dated the 18th February, formally recognising the right of the commission in this respect. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum communicated to Persian Government by Sir W. Toumley. HIS Britannic Majesty’s Minister duly communicated to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the proviso made in the note from the Persian Government of the 17th instant, accepting the arrangement respecting the delimitation of the Turco-Persian frontier at Constantinople, in which the Imperial Government maintained their right to navigate the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab as in the past. Sir W. Townley is informed by Sir E. Grey that there has never been any intention to interfere with frfeedom of navigation on the Shatt-el-Arab. He is to add that it is the intention of the Turkish Government to form a special commission for the purpose of improving the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab. In order to meet the expenses that will be incurred on account of these operations, Sir E. Grey is convinced that the Persian Government will agree to the levy of dues on their shipping tonnage for services rendered, as distinct from the mere fact of navigation. Such dues will be limited to a maximum amount, will be levied impartially on the shipping of all countries, and are indispensable to meet the cost of the work that must be undertaken if the river is to be adapted to the developments of modern shipping. The Imperial Govern ment will readily realise the enormous benefit that is likely to accrue to Persia from such developments of the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab. Sir W. Townley is also instructed to point out to the Imperial Government that the wording of the Treaty of Erzeroum implies that the frontier did not formerly follow the mid-channel line, and that this contention is confirmed by the recommendation of the mediating commissioners of 1850.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 402 of the 4th instant, I have now the honour to enclose copies of the dratt communications to and from the Russian Ministry for foreign Affairs on the subject of the Shatt-el-Arab Navigation Commission which I drew up in consultation with the Ministry for Foreign Atfairs. I should explain that when you authorised me to discuss the matter fully with the Russian Government I proposed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to address them a communication of the nature of the draft embassy aide-memoire as it seemed clear that this offered the only means of deterring the Russian Government from insisting on a change in the text of the Convention of the 11th June, 1913, or on the signature of some fresh additional declaration. There is a certain apparent contradiction between article 8 of the convention, which stipulates that the Commission’s police shall have the exclusive right of effecting arrests, and point (4, of the embassy aide-memoire, which says that the Russian consul shall exercise all his usual functions under the Capitulations. But as the Russian Government would certainly not have formally abandoned whatever rights of arrest, &amp;c., the Russian consul at present possesses under the Capitulations, and as I do not think they would be prepared expressly to admit the right of the Commission to arrest Russian subjects, I thought it best to propose a formula stating generally that the consul continued to exercise his ordinary functions in relation to Russian subjects. This appears to leave intact the right of the Commission to effect arrests, whether in flagrante delicto or otherwise, which I understand to be the point of chief importance. After the text of the proposed communications had been finally agreed on, the head of the eastern section of the Ministry remarked that he presumed that, if some other Power refused to make the concessions regarding the jurisdiction of the Commission to which Russia had consented, Russia would not be placed in a less favourable position than any other nation. I replied that I thought that there was no danger of any other Power refusing to recognise the powers of the Commission, and M. de Klemm did not pursue the subject. I have, &amp;c. HUGH O’BEIRNE.

As far as I can judge, the proposal you describe in outline may, on closer examination, perhaps prove acceptable, but I am not quite clear to whom the reserva tion is to be made, nor what is understood by Persia’s “ riverain rights,” and I cannot support a general expression of this nature, which contains the germs of continual future disagreement. If by the expression Persia merely reserves her freedom of navigation, I do not object, hut this should he explicitly stated, and there can he no question of Persian sovereign rights on a river of which the whole waterway is Turkish. Moreover, there is in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July, 1913, a limitation in duration of Commission, which may be fixed at sixty years. It is essential that Persia should agree to levy of dues for services rendered for all time. It would.save time if you were to discuss wording of a document which would meet the case with Persian Government, and telegraph draft to me, so that I can approach Russian and Turkish Governments without delay. # I cannot understand how Persian Ministers can “at heart refuse to lecognise frontier agreement as favourable to Persia ; it is clearly and demonstrably so along the whole line, and even in Zohab Persia acquires more than she had by the treaty oi Erzeroum or the award of the Mediating Commissioners.

I HAVE received your Excellency’s telegram No. 619 of the 13th instant, relative Russia claimed the privileges in question, and Turkey did not concede them “in principle.” Why could not Russia, he asked, be satisfied with a “ general” declaration, such as the Anglo-Turkish one of the 21st October, 1913, to the effect that articles 7 and 8 of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of the 29th July, 1913, did not affect the treaty rights of foreign Powers. His Highness was told, in reply, firstly, that Russia would not be satisfied with such a wording, because articles 7 and 8 of the Anglo-Turkish Convention were, in her view, too specific to be neutralised by a declaration in general wording such as that of the 21st October, and it was quite clear that Russia would not pay the dues unless she were satisfied by some declaration such as is proposed in the article to which his Highness took exception. Secondly, that His Majesty’s Government entirely agreed with the Russian Government in thinking that Turkey would have no right to object to the procedure laid down in that article, and, such being the case, and there being no other means of securing paymeirt of the dues by Russian ships, there could be no objection to the proposed exchange of notes between the British and Russian Governments. I transmit °to your Excellency herewith a copy of a correspondence with His Majesty’s Embassy at St. Petersburgh, and of a note to Hakki Pasha on the subject* to the objections which Hakki Pasha anticipates that the Turkish Government will raise to the procedure laid down in article 2 of the proposed British declaration to Russia on the subject of the rights of police and jurisdiction to be exercised by the Shatt-el-Arab Navigation Commission. The question has been further discussed with Hakki Pasha, who argued that the second article of the proposed declaration to be made by His Majesty’s Government to Russia was an interpretation, in a sense contested by Turkey, of a matter in dispute.

After what you pointed out to Persian Government respecting navigation of Shatt-el-Arab, as reported in your telegram No. 389 of 16th November, and after assurance which you gave them in accordance with instructions contained in my telegram No. 462 of L8th November, further declaration seems superfluous, and in any case Frontier Commission is not concerned with navigation rights but only with delimitation of frontier. You should point this out to Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and emphasise the fact that the Treaty of Krzeroum, which secures freedom of navigation to Persia, remains in force. If, however, Persia is willing to accept Riverain Commission, as represented to you by Minister for Foreign Affairs, I see no objection to reservation of her freedom of navigation being made in the document by which she formally agrees to commission levying dues, &amp;c. There can, however, be no question as to reservation of Persia’s sovereignty on the river since it is non-existent, as is clear from the wording of article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeroum (see Foreign Office memorandum of 3rd April, 1912) and from acceptance by Persia of mediating commissioners’ line of 1850. If above proposal is agreeable to Persian Government, and they will give you definite assurance that they will accept Riverain Commission without further delay, I will act as indicated in last paragraph of my telegram No. 484 of 19th December. You should point out that the arrangements made for the Shatt-el-Arab were a principal inducement to Turkey to agree to the very favourable settlement of the frontier which we have now succeeded in obtaining for Persia, and that delay and objections from the Persian side now would be most unwise.

(JNo. ^ ^ ^ (December 26, 1*30 p.m.) MINISTER of Foreign Affairs called on me yesterday and said lie had laid contents of your telegram No. 484 / of 19th December before the Cabinet, which is most unwilling to agree to the proposals respecting the payment of the shipping dues and the RiverCommission, unless Persia’s river rights on the Shatt-el-Arab are recognised pro forma. His Excellency represented that the Cabinet only agreed to accept the frontier \ settlement reached at Constantinople on condition that Persia’s sovereignty and i navigation rights on the Shatt-el-Arab should be reserved. That this was not done by the Persian Ambassador at Constantinople was due to the bad wording of the telegraphic instructions sent to him ; now recognition of river rights only is asked ( for, which, as his Excellency pointed out, becomes a mere formality, when Persia is prepared formally to accept Turkish river commission with all the control it entails and to pay dues to be levied on Persian shipping. He urged that this concession to, the amour-propre of a state having frontier on the river bank, was not an exaggerated demand. Cabinet has been very seriously attacked in the press here for having accepted frontier arrangement which is largely responsible for the present disunion in the Cabinet, two or three of whose members were strongly opposed to the acceptance, partly because Persia’s consent had been taken for granted and partly because they refused to see obvious advantages Persia derives from the arrangements. Malcontents only signed, when they knew that Russian Charge d’Affaires and I I were in the next room insisting on immediate acceptance. [1279-425]CONFIDENTIAL. Sir TV.

PETERSBURG, December 11th, 1S13. With reference to my telegram No. 402 of the 4th Instant, I have now the honour to enclose copies of the draft communications to and from the Russian Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the Shatt-el-Arab Navigation Commission which I drew up in consultation with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. I should explain that when you authorised me to discuss the matter fully with the Fussian Government I proposed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to ad dress them a communication of the nature of the draft Embassy Aide-Memoire, as it seemed clear that this offered the only means of deterring the Fussian. Gov ernment from insisting on a change in the text of the Convention of June 11th, 1913 or on the signature of some fresh additional Declaration. There is a certain apparent contradiction between Article VIII of the Convention, which stipulates that the Commission’s police shall have the exclusive right Tlie Fight Honourable Sir E. Grey, Bart., K.G., M.P. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.of effecting arrests, and point ( 4 ) of the Embassy ( Aide-Memoire which says that the Bussian Consul shall exercise all his usual functions under the Capitula tions. But as the Bussian Government would cer tainly not have formally abandoned whatever rights of arrest &amp;c., the Bussian Consul at present possesses under the Capitulations, and as I do not think they would be prepared expressly to admit the right of the Commission to arrest Bussian subjects, I thought it best to propose a formula stating generally that the Consul continued to exercise his ordinary functions in relation to Bussian subjects. This appears to leave intact the right of the Commission to effect arrests, whether in flagrante delicto or otherwise, which I understand to be the point of chief Impor tance. After the text of the proposed communications had beer finally agreed on the Head of the Eastern Section of the Ministry remarked that he presumed that if some other Power refused to make the conces sions regarding the jurisdiction of the Commission to which Bussia had,consented, Bussia would not be placed in a less favourable position than any other nation.ration.

Secondly, that His Majesty’s Government entirely agreed with the Russian Government in thinking that Turkey would have no right to object to the procedure laid down in that article and, such being the case, and there being no other means of securing payment of the dues by Russian ships, there could be no objection -o the proposed exchange of notes between the British and Russian Governments.

Foreign Office, November 29, 1913, 6 p.m. IT is not necessary to adopt procedure indicated in final paragraph, which goes beyond anything we desire, and would be impracticable, as both commissioners are Turkish officials, though one is of British nationality. I am not sure from your telegram if the Russian Government concur in the views of Russian Ambassador as reported in Sir L. Mallet’s telegram No. 580 i ^ ' ' but, if they do, please explain that His Majesty’s Government have never contemplated \u- c ‘ exclusion of foreign consul or dragoman concerned under article 7 of convention, and they fail to see how Turkey could possibly oppose the presence of such officials in the face of the additional declaration of 21st October which Hakki Pasha has signed. As to article 8, it is expressly laid down that the persons arrested shall be handed over to the “ competent authorities ” ; these authorities would be those recognised under the Capitulations ; arrests would, it is true, be carried out in the first instance by the Commission’s police, but only in so far as it otherwise might be in practice impossible to effect arrests at all, and immediately after such arrests the consul con cerned would be notified and the prisoner handed over to him. Save in such entirely exceptional circumstances, arrests would, in pursuance of the declaration of 21st October, be effected in the normal manner through the consul concerned. You should discuss the subject fully with Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs and endeavour to induce his Excellency to withdraw his objections with the least possible delay, basing your arguments on the terms of the additional declaration of 21st October.

YOUR telegram No. 375 of 1st November : Shatt-el-Arab Riverain Commission.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Govemmaiit] SIR E. GREY presents his compliments to Hakki Pasha, and, with reference to the interview which his Highness had with Mr. Parker on the 14th October, has the honour to state that, in view ol the lact that the requisite negotiations between the Ottoman Government and the Bagdad Railway Company are not yet concluded, and aie unlikely to be so beiore the 29th October, it would seem necessary to postpone the date of ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Convention respecting the Persian Gulf and adjacent territories. 1 Ins postponement will involve an amendment of the convention, which necessitates the conclusion of a supplementary convention ad hoc.

Grey has the honour to suggest that the assent of the Ottoman Government should be obtained by telegraph. He would further suggest that all the other documents signed on the 29th July should be likewise ratified on or before the 29th December, with the exception of that relating to the southern part of the Turco-Persian frontier, which can be ratified during the present month. the supplementary convention respecting the Shatt - el - Arab Conservancy Commission might, if convenient to his Highness Hakki Pasha, be signed on the 21 st instant.

WITH reference to your telegram No. 451 of the 5th instant, I take leave to invite your attention to one or two points in the Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Convention, which may possibly give rise to difficulties in the future. Under the last sentence of article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeroum the free navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab up to Mohammerah is secured to Persian ships, and it would there fore apparently be an infringement of the treaty for the Conservancy Commission to levy dues, for whatsoever services, on Persian vessels proceeding to that port from the sea, without on the same voyage touching at any Ottoman port within the jurisdiction of the Commission. At present Persian shipping is almost non-existent, but should the Mohammerah-Khoremabad Railwa } 7 project materialise; it is not impossible that a sufficiently considerable trade through Mohammerah might be created to make it worth while for enterprising merchants to form a shipping company to trade with that port and place it under the Persian flag, for the express purpose of evading the Conservancy dues, and so obtaining an advantage as against the shipping of other countries. To obviate the possibility of such a question being raised in the future, it might! be prudent, while it still has little practical importance, to obtain the assent of the Persian Government to the levy on Persian shipping using the port of Mohammerah in the conditions above mentioned of dues in respect of the services rendered by the Conservancy Commission. As regards the amount of the dues to be levied, I note in a minute of a conversation between Mr. Parker and Herr von Kuhlmann that it is admitted that even if the maximum rate of 1 fr. per registered ton of shipping be levied the resulting revenue will not cover the cost of all the services to be rendered by the Commission. I venture to point out for your consideration, however, that it may in practice be impracticable to levy the maximum rate. Taking the average tonnage entered at Basra for the years 1909-11 as a rough basis of calculation, the revenue of the Commission will be, at 1 fr., 275,000 fr., or something under £ T. 12,000, of which £ T. 4,000 is absorbed by the salaries of the tw T o commissioners. The Commission must at least take over the existing services of lighting and buoying, and will of course greatly improve them, and the £ T. 8,000 will probably- I speak as a layman—amply cover these expenses. But these services have hitherto been rendered gratis and it is to be anticipated that British shipping companies will complain loudly if they are now suddenly called to pay the heavy due of .1 fr. for mere improvement. I am aware that His Majest} Govern ment have secured, or have reason to believe that they can secure, the assent of France, Germany, and Russia to the convention in principle, but the amount of the due remains to be fixed, and I fear that it would be difficult to defend a rate higher than that lewed for similar services in other ports of Turkey, e.g., at Constantinople, wheie light and buoy dues 'work out at about 3cf. per registered ton. A 3d. due w'ould barelj co\ei the commissioners’ salaries, so that it is doubtful whether even an ambitious commence ment of the Commission’s functions will be feasible with a due at all commensurate with the services rendered. The irrigation of Mesopotamia will no doubt eventually develop the shipping using the port of Basra very greatly, but even when it has reached, say i, 00 c,UU ons, the Commission will, with a 3d. due, only encash a revenue of some c~ 1 . : ,y &gt; an( presume that two or three times this sum will be required for the policing an dredging of sixty miles of river with all the subsidiary services, btill it mig i )e possible, when this tonnage figure is reached, to make out a case foi iaiding ^ t u c in. so as to provide the requisite moneys. Other circumstances may, how e\ er, ren C i ^ advisable to keep the due below the maximum allowed by the convention, roi instance, the export trade, which will be chiefly in cereals, may not e a i e to Gar an Copy to todla] 3 CCT1913extra franc added to the freight, or again, the extra franc might make tran the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal less advantageous than by rail via Alexa l POrt ,J - r the Mediterranean.

But it is, I submit, quite evident that it must be°som yt °' before the Commission can carry out all its duties and at the same time lie so t 6 ^ self-supporting, and it would appear to be incumbent on His Majesty’s Govern! , decide how the requisite revenues are to be found.

In latter case little serious attempt is made by Turks to enforce such regulations as exist, and even in former it is difficult to make an exact statement, as the principles governing all such matters are subject to perpetual controversy between the Porte and Powers. Powers, moreover, do not all hold the same views. In practice, cases find a more or less arbitrary solution dependent on special circumstances. Subject to this general statement and further reservations mentioned below, answers to your questions are :— 1 . Missions claim, and Porte still recognises in practice, that Ottoman authorities cannot arrest a foreigner except in flagrante delicto. Most Powers claim that in all cases consular authority alone can detain accuse person pending trial. Even in case of arrest in flagrante delicto they maintain that accused should be surrendered. Porte contests this. In practice His Majesty’s Government allows detention in Turkish prison provided that consular authorities acquiesce in necessity for it. 2. Yes, unless case comes within definition in flagrante delicto. 3. All Powers except United States and one or two minor Powers would admit Ottoman courts jurisdiction subject to capitulatory rights, but prosecutions of foreigners under regulations of the kind referred to are rare. Exercise of jurisdiction does not imply right to execute sentence. Some Powers claim that this right belongs exclusively to consular authorities. Others, including Great Britain, admit right o Ottoman authorities to execute with consular assistance. .... , 4. See previous answer. Principal requirement of Capitulations is^ that consu ai delegate should attend proceedings. Powers maintain that his assent is necessaiy to validity of sentence. Porte asserts that his presence alone is necessaiy. 5. Turkish authorities would apply to consular authority, which would order ship to comply with their requirements if reasonable. If ship defied consular authori y also, Turkish authorities might take legal proceedings or hamper ship s .reedom by withholding papers; but such a case would hardly ever arise. Further reservations mentioned above are as follows .— 1. Questions answered on assumption that regulations themselves are lecognised by the Powers as applicable to foreigners (see my despatch No. i o i ugus . 2. No Power would allow Ottoman authorities to effect arrests on board foreign ships. It is doubtful whether they would admit jurisdiction of lurkish comt^ m respect of an infringement of regulations committed on board; but in absence oi actual cases it is difficult to say what their attitude would be. His Majesty’s consul at Basra, whom I have consulted, agrees with He says, further, with reference to question 5, that m Basra S ^ ] P S “ uc ^ 0 . ■ d . they can ; that Turks, in practice, rarely interfere with foreign ^tps '“less invited that, in case of difficulty, local authorities would invite consul to arrange it, and , he has always settled such cases amicably.

[38053] [Amended Copy.] No. 1. , . ^ r ‘ Maying to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 18.) (No. 701.) y ; ® ir ’ Trp , . .. , Constantinople, August 4 , 1913. 11 appears desirable to reply to your telegram No. 372 of the 2nd instant, relative to the capitulatory aspects of the proposed Shatt-el-Arab convention, somewhat more fully than I should conveniently do within the limits of a telegram. I have decided, therefore, to deal with those special aspects of the matter in a despatch, without awaiting the result of any conversations with the Russian Ambassador on the other questions iiivol\ed, and I will take the opportunity of amplifying some portions of mv telegram No. 376 of the 30th July. When writing my telegram No. 376, I had not yet been favoured with the views of His Majesty s Government as to whether the portions of the draft convention which, taken by themselves, would confer upon the Conservancy Commission powers incon sistent with the capitulatory rights of Great Britain and other States alike, were actually intended to constitute such a derogation from the ancient treaties or were to be construed, so far as they affected foreigners, subject to the provisions of those treaties. In view of the explanations contained in your telegram No. 366 of the 1 st instant, it is now, perhaps, hardly necessary to point out that certain stipulations in the draft convention, if read alone, would certainly contravene the capitulatory rights of ourselves and other Powers. This applies more especially to articles 7 and 8 , which did not occur in the original draft communicated to the Turkish and the Russian Governments over a year ago, for these articles give the Commission judicial powers (for the purpose of enforcing its own regulations by fine and even imprisonment) to arrest delinquents, without prescribing that such powers shall be exercised only with the consent of the consular authority in the case of foreigners. Article 6 , paragraph (c.), moreover, empowers the Commission to make regulations, the general validity of which in regard to foreigners, apart from any question of particular exercises of jurisdiction under them, might be questioned by foreign Powers; for it must not be forgotten that all the Powers insist that no Turkish enactment, the provisions of which are such as to raise questions of capitulatory privileges, can be invoked against a foreign subject unless his Government has expressly acceded to it, while some go even further, and maintain that no Turkish law whatsoever applies to foreigners without such previous express acceptance. Lastly, I may repeat, for the sake of completeness, that any dues levied by the Commission under article 11, or any revision of the tariff which would have the effect of increasing those dues beyond the limit of 1 para per ton, such as is implicitly contemplated in article 16, would require the assent of all the Powers. Though this is now, I think, recognised by everyone concerned, it may be well to point out that the difficulty arising out of the necessity for such assent cannot be turned, as the writers of the joint letter addressed to you on the 15th May, 1912, by the authors of the original draft appeared at that time to hope, by representing the dues as payments for services rendered. Such a solution would be possible if it were a question of charging individual ships for services which the Turkish Government is not bound to render and which the ship is not bound to accept, such as, for instance, pilotage, but it is not possible when it is proposed, as in articles 11 and 12 of the draft convention, to levy compulsory dues in all ships for an aggregate of services rendered to shipping as a whole. A large body of precedent exists to prove that dues of the latter kind, though charged for services rendered, cannot be imposed by any Turkish authority (on foreign shipping) without the consent of the Powers, and His Majesty s Government have yielded to none in their consistent determination to uphold this principle. In short, the draft convention contains several most important provisions which suggest questions of capitulatory privilege, and in only one instance, namely, article 6 , paragraph (f), where “ droits contractuels des Puissances etrangeres appears to refer to the Capitulations, does the text itself contain anything designed to safeguard treat} [1825 s—l]rights.* I conceive that it was some apprehension based on this omission that inspired the Russian Government’s aide-memoire summarised in Sir G. Buchanan’s telegram No. 280 of the 26th July last. Two of the six desiderata mentioned therein, namely, that concerning direct relations between consuls and the Commission, and that concerning the non-application of coercive measures except through the consuls, go little beyond what would be secured by the normal operation of the Capitulations, and ^ not at all beyond it if the words “ through the medium of” be taken to mean “ with the concurrence ” of. A third, namely, that relating to the Commission’s regulations, is evidently based on the claim adverted to above, and advanced by all the Powers, including ourselves, though frequently disputed by the Porte, that Turkish regulations generally, or at least all such as touch foreigners in matters which are the subject of capitulatory rights, require the assent of the Powers before they can be applied to foreign subjects. I venture to lay some stress on this view of the Russian Government’s aide memoire as it seems to me probable that very similar observations would occur to other Powers, especially to any of them which, seeing in the convention a political agreement advantageous to Great Britain, might be disposed to make capital out of any objection that could be made to it on the score of existing international obligations. It has now indeed been made clear to me by your telegram No. 366, of the 1 st instant, that His Majesty’s Government have not lost sight of the necessity of assuring a favourable attitude on the part of the Powers besides Russia, but I would suggest with all deference that it would be desirable to obtain some formal record of their acquiescence in what is proposed, as, when the time comes for investing the riverain Commission with the jurisdiction contemplated by the draft convention, it will be open to the other Powers, unless they are already tied down, to address objections not to His Majesty’s Government but to the Sublime Porte, and it is not impossible that the very situation apprehended in paragraph 5 of the letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office of the 4th June, 1912, might then arise. In obtaining the formal adhesion of Russia and other Powers the ability of His Majesty’s Government to assure them that the Commission’s juris diction is intended to be exercised subject to the Capitulations would doubtless be of some value, but I think it very probable that, as the Commission is to be Ottoman, they would look for some assurance that the Turkish Government will continue to read the convention in that sense more binding than a verbal statement by Hakki Pasha as to the Porte’s intentions. They would be the more likely to consider such a statement insufficient because experience has shown to them no less than to ourselves how prone Turkish Authorities are to ignore intentions expressed or clearly implied on past occasions when it accords more with the policy of whittling down the Capitulations to rely only on the bare wording of the documents recognised by the Powers but requiring to be read in the light of other understandings. Their apprehensions would only be strengthened by the use of such words as “ exclusivement ” in article 7 and “ seule ” in article 8 of the draft convention. I would even go further and say that we ourselves might at some future time have cause to regret that we had not explicitly safeguarded our own capitulatory rights against possible encroachment by an Ottoman authority like the Commission, though of course in our case the perpetual presence of a British Commissioner would afford a fairly adequate guarantee against anything which His Majesty’s Government might consider undesirable. Anotner point which must not be lost sight of is that articles 7 and 8 deal with some of the matters in regard to which the extent of the operation of the Capitulations is most controverted. To take examples only of the kind of question which may arise even after it is clearly laid down that the Capitulations are to be respected, the exercise of the Commission s jurisdiction under article 7 will raise the question as to whether a consular representative s consent is necessary for the valid infliction of a penalty on a foreigner, and whether its penal decisions are to be executed by the Turkish local authorities, the consular authorities, or the Commission itself. Again, when an arrest is made under article 8 , it may be asked whether the “ autorites competentes ” to whom the offender is to be handed over are the Turkish local authorities or his consulate. Yet another probable controversy is suggested by the use of the formula “ autorite, analogue a celle dont jouissent les municipahtes,” for no foreign Power, so far as I am aware, recognises^ the right of the Turkish municipal authorities to levy fines on foreign subjects without having recourse to the ordinary tribunals. The policy of the Porte, especially for recent years, has been to seize every opportunity of curtailing capitulatory an&lt; ^ ( ^ en Y’ whenever a semblance of reason can be found for it, privileges which have hitherto been enjoyed. Hakki Pasha, who collaborated with Mr. Malkinin drafting the articles, would himself as a former Law Officer of the Porte under the old regime, and as a Grand Vizierial patron of this anti-Capitulation policy under the new, naturally incline to formulae sufficiently ambiguous to enable the Porte to maintain its own views unimpaired when conflicts arise in connection with the exercise of the Commission’s jurisdiction. An unfortunate consequence may be that when ^'jch conflicts arise His Majesty’s Government will be divided between their desire to make the decisions of the Commission effective as against the foreign subjects other than British, and their loyalty to the interpretations of the Capitulations which they have hitherto maintained in common with other Powers, and which they will doubtless still desire to maintain on behalf of British subjects in Turkey as against all other Turkish authorities. In view of these considerations, it seems to me very desirable that there should be a clear understanding with the Porte that the convention is to be construed subject to the Capitulations, either by means of a clause interpolated in the convention itself or by a separate declaration or exchange of notes. It seems to me further desirable, though on this point I am less positive, nor can I judge to what extent the suggestion may be practicable, that the formal acquiescence of any other Powers besides Russian whose shipping frequents the Shatt-el-Arab should be obtained now, rather than that the Porte should be left to reconcile them to a fait accompli, and that, if possible, such acquiescence should include a recognition of the Commission’s power to make regulations binding on foreigners, without its being necessary to secure the consent of the Powers afresh for each regulation. If it were possible to frame the clause safeguarding capitulatory rights in such a way as to lay down some express rules for the exercise of the Commission’s jurisdiction in regard to foreigners rather than to confine it to a general statement that the Capitulations were to apply, the difficulties indicated in the preceding paragraph would be mitigated, but I realise that at this late stage in the negotiations it might be difficult to come to an agreement with the Porte and with the other Powers on such a form without unduly delaying the signature of the convention.

As regards Mohammerah, no position of independence is claimed for the sheikh, commerce and shipping, owing to his geographical and territorial position, is chiefly involved. It was in order to avoid any appearance of setting him up as independent into Arabistan they did so by means of an agreement with the sheikh, recognising his special position, which includes that of a hereditary ruler. The Russian Government are aware that His Majesty’s Government have for many years past had very close relations with the Sheikh of Mohammerah, whose interests touch theirs in many important points, but so far are they from being conscious that there is anything in their policy “ hardly consistent with principle of Persian integrity ” that they have always, in writing to the sheikh, made loyalty to the Central Government one of the conditions on which their support of him has depended.

Paragraph 4. As regards declaration, Russian Government wishes to draw atten tion of His Majesty’s Government to fact that Sheikh of Mohammerah, being a Persian subject and possessing none of the privileges of autonomy, cannot be considered as entitled to entrust to anyone protection of Persian commercial and maritime interests^ such right belonging exclusively to Persian Government itself. In reading to me first paragraph of above, Minister for Foreign Affairs remarked that he did not wish to quarrel with us about the convention, but on coming to para graphs 3 and 4 he adopted a rather serious tone. It seemed, he said, to be our intention to place Russian subjects under jurisdiction of a commission in which we were represented and in which Russia was not, and to treat Mohammerah like Koweit. | Independent position we were claiming for sheikh was hardly consistent with principle . of Persian integrity.

Please convey my thanks to Minister for Foreign Affairs. In view of Russian reply I leave it to your discretion how far you act upon my telegram No. 579 of yesterday. It will perhaps be better to say nothing. The phrase “ no dues will be imposed by mere fact of navigation but merely for services rendered ” is intended to limit amount of dues to actual disbursements of commission upon such works as dredging, buoying, lighting, landing facilities, and administrative expenditure, but to preclude any toll consequent upon mere navigation of the river and in excess of expenditure actually incurred by and upon commission. Our wish was to guard against any attempt on the part of Turkey to impose dues in excess of such expenditure, thereby securing a fresh source of revenue to the detriment of foreign shipping. With regard to first paragraph of your telegram, if by “ other Powers ” is meant “ Powers other than Great Britain,” there is no objection so far as His Majesty s Government are concerned, but you need not mention this unless Minister for F oreign Affairs recurs to the point.

R. , Foreign Office, August 8, 1913, 4 p.m. YOU should inform Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs of substance of Mr. Marling’s telegram No. 393 , omitting first sentence. You should add that I cannot accept reasoning advanced by M. Minorsky, since, so far from situation on Shatt-el-Arab being modified in our favour, we are actually surrendering to Turkey participation in conservancy rights which we have hitherto exercised alone for a very long time. It seems to me that M. Minorsky is inclined to overrate the importance of this matter altogether : the duties of the commission are limited to a small geographical area and are strictly defined so as to ensure equality of treatment for ships of all nations, and, as the Sheikh of Mohammerah has certain de facto interests on the river (of which the w r hole waterway is Turkish), it seems absolutely necessary to provide for them in such a way as is done in the declaration annexed to the convention, but, if the Russian Government prefer, we need not publish the declaration about Mohammerah. I do not think it can be urged that our action would formally modify the political status at the head of the Persian Gulf in our favour, since, far from making any claim to treat Mesopotamia as a British sphere, we are giving up all claim to control over any part of the Bagdad Railway. Such being the case, the only way in which we can now safeguard our great interests in Mesopotamia is by making without delay (and before the completion of the Bagdad Railway, which is now inevitable) a settlement recognising our de facto position in the Persian Gulf and on the Shatt-eTArab. I regard it as quite impracticable to obtain admission of Russian subject in some technical capacity on the commission : even Germany, whose shipping is six times as great as that of Russia, has not made such a claim, and it would be impossible to overcome Turkish objections; but I will endeavour to meet Russian wishes by arranging that consuls shall have right of addressing representations and advice direct to the commission on all matters affecting foreign shipping. (End of R.) Following arguments are for your guidance and for such use as you can advantageously make of them. As we are not securing any control over the Bagdad Railway, which is to traverse a region where British commercial interests have long been paramount, public opinion will not be satisfied unless we obtain recognition of the status quo in the Shatt-el-Arab and Persian Gulf, and on latter point please refer to my published despatch of 29th August, 1907, to Sir A. Nicolson. I consider it very important that it should be seen that Russian Government is at one with us in a matter so greatly affecting our interests, and I earnestly trust that they will express their concurrence at an early date. I am anxious to avoid admitting contention of Russian Embassy at Constantinople that if Russia agrees to this arrangement it will entitle her to “ similar complaisance on our part ” in other regions. It would be as well, however, to avoid anything which might lead to an argument on this subject, and confine yourself to pointing out the self-denying character of our agreement.

Minorsky. Finally his Excellency sent Minorsky to me this morning to explain his views. He said that Russian Embassy had pointed out to Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs that convention would formally modify in favour of Great Britain political status at head of Persian Gulf, while final declaration concerning Sheikh of Mohammerah was not far short of recognition of sheikh’s independence of Persia. Sheikh’s territory w r as, moreover, in neutral zone in Persia. Embassy had not recommended that objections should be raised to convention, but had merely pointed out that, if Russia agreed to it, she would be entitled, if the occasion arose, to claim similar complaisance on our part. As regards substance of convention, he said that now that it was understood that convention would be applied without derogation to Capitulations Russian Embassy had no objections to make, but embassy had insisted, with Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, on desirability of having Russian subject appointed to commission in some technical capacity.

You should make such use as you can of the following arguments in vour representations to Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs : — By article 1 of convention Turkey admits, as she has never done hitherto, that the whole Shatt-el-Arab is open to all ships, even up to Kurna. His Majesty’s Government have supported Russia energetically and successfully in regard to northern part of Turco-Persian frontier, and they have even gone so far as to intimate to Hakki Pasha that the acceptance of Russian proposals of last year wns virtually a condition of British assent to the Turkish customs increase. I have reason to believe that this intimation was a decisive factor in bringing about Turkish acceptance. In view of these and other considerations already explained I feel confident that Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs will not oppose our convention respecting Shatt- el-Arab or insist upon claim for admission of Russians to posts under commission.

I even communicated a draft to the Russian Government a year ago, and they raised no objection then. 1 am negotiating with the German Government on this matter, and I do not expect any insuperable difficulty from either the German or the French side, and as Russian commerce is so small, and as the arrangements we propose are designed equally in the interests of all nations, I trust Russian objections may be met or overcome. But if they persist in appointment of Russian subjects to administrative posts on commission the whole thing will, owing to Turkish objections, fall to the ground, whereas the proposal contained in the last paragraph of Sir G.

Imperial Government have no objection to conclusion of arrangement with regard to Turco-Persian v from Hawize£to Persian Gulf on lines of declaration signed in London on 6th May. They equally approve constitution of a mixed commission for navigation of Shatt- el-Arab which would guarantee full and entire liberty of navigation and occupy itself with introducing improvements calculated to promote passage of merchant vessels. As Russian maritime trade in those regions is very considerable Imperial Government would like, more especially if that trade continues to develope in near future, to take part in labours of that commission. Imperial Government would like to see some Russian subjects invited to occupy some responsible posts in administration of commission, especially if subjects of other Powers should be so employed. As commission has not yet been appointed, it is too early to discuss details of its competence and attributions, but Imperial Government would indicate certain amend ments which it would like introduced into draft scheme, namely, right of consuls to have direct relations with commission; communication to consuls and authorities of vilayets of reports of its proceedings and expenditure ; in the event of direct relations between commission and captains of ships or landed proprietors on either bank, coercive measures to be applied to foreign subjects only through medium of their respective consuls ; regulations affecting foreign ships, more especially with regard to tariffs and [?] taxes, to be enforced exclusively after preliminary agreement with consuls; ships of light tonnage that are not now stopped by bar and that consequently do not benefit by works of deepening to be free from all dues.

I am to inform you that Sir E.Grey concurs in the second paragraph of your above-mentioned letter, sub ject to the important reservation that riis majesty s I Government cannot he held liable, under the je^is of existing assurances to the Shelldi of Mohammerah, to I guarantee the continuance of the Sheikh’s jurisdiction of a tribal character on the Turkish or right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab if, as is not impossible, objections I gj-g raised on the part of the Turkish Government.

Sir E.Grey is advised that the claim of Persia to mid-channel cannot, in view of the wording of the Treaty of Erzeroum, he successfully up held, end he does not consider that Sir P.Oox has pro duced any argument that shakes the interpretation puu upon Article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) by His Majesty's Government. If, contrary to the wish and expectation of i.is Majesty's Government, the Mohamnerah question were to he referred to the Hague Tribunal, Sir E.Grey has little doubt that the whole waterway would be assigned to Turkey; and, in these circumstences, he concludes that it is preferable for the interests on the river of the Sheikh of Mohanmerah and the Persian Government to be entrusted to the Riverain Commission, constituted as proposed, rather than to the arbitrary control of the Turkish authorities. He considers that this aspect of the question, if properly represented, could hardly fail to appeal to the sagacity of the Sheikh. Sir E.Grey agrees that a clause might be added to the&lt;'271 j , V y (24009/12). y the proposed Riverain Convention, as suggested in your letter of June 4th, to the effect that nothing in the Convention shall derogate from the rights enjoyed by Persia under Article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeroum, and that it shall be the duty of the British member to make such representations to the Commission as may at any time be necessary upon any question affecting the interests of Persia or the Sheikh of Mohammerah. He considers that there is ree.son to apprehend ob jections on the part of foreign Powers to the levy of dues by the Commission, and that it might, in accoi dance with the original suggestion made by Admiral Sir A.K. Wilson to the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1911, be advisable that no dues should be levied by the Commis- i J i sion for the first two years, during which the expense might be borne by the Turkish Government and His | Majesty 1 s Government, and that His lajesty 1 s Government j might facilitate the advance of such funds as might be || requisite for the expenditure of the Commission, subject | to satisfactory arrangements as to repayment.

This p’.int seems to be also covered by the provision in the draft Convention that (Ues are only to h§ levied for services rendered. If Persia renders no ser vices she will be entitled to no dues. On the other hand, for wharfage etc, at these Persian ports she would be entitled apparently to some v share of the consolidated due which it is proposed that the Csmmts^ien should levy* This was admitt&amp;d as regards Mo hammer a in our telegram of 10th Aftril, but does not appear in the Convention, and should be further considered, v. ) » r* &gt; f .

His Majesty's Oovemmnt have declined to recognise this ?tel. of 10th April), but Hi . Cox remained unconvinced (tel. of Oth lay/. He also suggested some modified proposal under which Persia would be allowed representation direct, or through the heikh. The Decr of in re ‘'tel. of 10th April) pointed out the incon venience of admitting Persia, and asked whether the Cheikh could not be persua-d.ec/_ '.o delegate any claims he may have to the B representative on the Commission.Dir P.'ox objected to this (tel.of Oth Pay) on the gro that would be disloyal on the part &gt;0/ the who is an official representative of the n ereian Co omment, and that he would only agree in return for a consid erable extension of our assur, sices of protection. Put in his shorter telegram Pay he suggested that our represent at i&gt;» on the Commission should be explicitly permitted to represent the .'heikh's interest. In our letter to Foreign of 4th June it was accordingly proposed that a clause should be ins&amp;ed ’to the effect that nothing •in the Convention shall derogate from the rights •enjoyed by Persia and Poharviera &lt;• •the Treaty (ofTrzerorm), and that shall be the •duty of the British member to make such represent ations to the Commies ion as nay at any tine be •necessary upon any guest ion affecting those rights?

T am not aioare if there is any objection to this being in the hands of the Commission. Pir Cox's longer telegram of 23rd tf ay has already been commented on by Pr. Parker. It is a s mm ary of his letter of 21st May, which however does not seem to add anything material to it. may be mentioned with reference to head Tft^^ that it is clear from the correspondence of 1847 that the tribes referred to in the Treaty are not nomads, but the settled tribes - see enclosures in Mr. Wellesley's despatch o. &gt;1 of 3 Parch 234' (Correspondence part 3, pp. 3D, 40). Mir Pm Cox's shorter telegrtm of 2 r' *ay has been answered by the Secretary of State .■ telegram of 1st June. Put it may be note ' that part 3 of the Correspondence relative to the negotiations 1843- 1832 piakee the position with regard to fortifications quite clear. The Porte desired a formal and posi tive engagement that its r&gt;ght to the exclusive possession of the channel of the Chat should never be challenged, and, in order that Persia might never have an excuse for claiming possession (as distinct fromfrom the right of free navigation), that no kind of fort if i cat ions ohould ever be ejected either on the island (Khizi) or in any place where they uronld he detrimental to the navigation of the river by Darkish merchant vessels (Turkish *&gt; to the two °owers 8th Pecmber 1846, p»30); and they proposed to add to article. 2 of the Treaty a paragraph to the effect that, provided that the Persian Govern ment formally undertake that no fortifications shall ever be erected *sur cewc d&amp;s ondroits aitries sur 21 u rive gauche du Ghatt-el-Arab, giri, corsmo i2 &amp;st 9 dit plus hunt, doivent roster on la possession de 9 la n erse 9 , Turkey undertakes not to erect fort ifi- i cations *sur les cotes de ces terres situees sur •la rive droit &amp; du fleave misdit gui sent vis-a-vis 9 des endroits susmentionnes, 9 (Turkish M.P.A. 9th March 184?, p. 12). The two Ambassadors approved this reciprocal engagement (14th April 1847, p.8l). The Persian representative then asked for *a declar ation in writing that the fortifications of ohm- •m&amp;ra were not included among those whose prohibi- 9 tion was demanded by the Porte 9 , and the two Ambassadors considered that they might give it •inasmuch as all that the Porte requires is that 9 no new fortifications shall bo constructed on the •Shatt-el-Arab, while the fortifications of Moham- •mera exist already, and it may be even matter of •doubt whether Mohatmera can be considered az •actually situated on the Shatt. 9 (Lord Cowley, 2 ?eb. 184o p. 61).

Poth of ‘■heee have been fully dealt with by Office in conMt- ation with Admiral Sir F. -J o. On a perusal of the telegrams this consideration suggests itself - that though Turkey is entitled to ownership of the whole river de.

Attention is invited to the fact that views have now formally been expressed by the Government of India in favour of British participation in the Persian Gulf section to the extent of 50 per cent. This matter has been already dealt with in my letters of the 21st May and 10th June 1912. Similarly, as regards the territorial questions referred to in the telegram, I am to call attention to what was said in my letter of the 18th June 1912’ The question of the specification attached to the Bagdad Railway Convention is not, it will be seen, touched upon in the telegram of the Government of India : it may be assumed that a further communication will be received from them when their examination of the matter is complete. There remains the question of the draft Convention for setting up a Riverain Commission in the Shatt-el-Arab. The telegrams received from Sir P. Cox on this subject, dated the 29th May and the 4th June, were enclosed in the letters of this Office, dated the 4th and 7th June, respectively, and it was explained in the penultimate paragraph of the former letter that the views of the Government of India would in due course be communicated. These views, it will be seen, are in general accord with those expressed by Sir P. Cox, but reason has been shown in the letter last referred to why for the present at any rate, they are inadmissible, and the Marquis of Crewe has little to add to what he has said already upon this subject. As regards the policing of the river, I am to say that one o*. the objects of the proposed convention is to remove as fai as possible all oppoitunit\ and excuse for intervention and obstruction on the part of the local authorities, who often are—or are conveniently represented to be—imperfectly controlled by the central Government. From this point of view it is most desirable that the maintenance of order should be in the hands of such a semi independent body as the Commission, acting in direct subordination to the Porte itself. In reply to the argument that, “ since the policing of the river must include suppression of piracy,” those duties must continue in the haaids of the local authorities, Lord Crewe is disposed to think that with the increasing development of commerce and navigation in the Shatt-el-Arab the suppression of piracy will assume a subordinate aspect and may safely be left to the Commission; but it might possibly be arranged that some police functions should be performed by the Sheikh of Mohammera under the authority and supervision of the Commission. r. 2 7 The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.2 , f tlip Shatt-el-Arab, it was thought preferable As regards the approaches ^^h the Convention that the by the Interdepartmental &lt;-om,r, - defined in the manner limits of the Commissrons control shmddjt^^ ^ ^ ^ dra{t suggested by the Government o^ n^ ^ ^ ^ ha d before them when (which the Qovermnerit of n sufficient safeguard.

This is important also or the p ^P allotting the proceeds of the consolidated dues o &gt;c i \ i&lt; mission, since, as pointed out by Sir P. Cox in the telegram maior part of the shipping affected will be that pljnfo &lt; Mohammera and Abadan. But, incidentally, this raises the difficul mentioned by Sir P. Cox in his telegram of the 6th May, of the C0 ’ 1S ^ U J 0 ^ position of the Sheikh, and appears to necessitate, at some s a go ^ negotiations, a communication to the Persian Government.

As regards control of approach to Shat-el-Arab we consider it essential that limits of this control should be very exactly defined to obviate Turkish claims to lighting and buoyage in Gulf itself.

X X X X X X With regard to Cox's farther telegram I think his alarm is quite unfounded. It was put in so as to prevent any interference with the pier and buoys and wharves of the Oil Company. Quarantine is out, and we decided it was better not to put it in. The third point is not so easy to deal with. It is quite possible that under the capitulations a foreign ship might object to compulsory pilotage, but I am not sure. I don 't know that the case would be any easier if the river were handed over to the Pailway Company as the status of the Company appears to me to be much the same as that of the Commission and their proceedings might equally well be objected to under the Capitulations. The only point in favour of the Railway Company is that Germany would anyhow be represented and she is the only Power that practical y matters at present. The only way out of the difficulty is to get the Turks to make a regulation that no Pilots are allomd to work on the river unless they are licensed and then to forbid the pilots from engaging themselves urivately or in any way except through the Commission. x x x x x x X/'com Political Resident, Persian Gulf, May 1912 S. 2?6 93 - Secretary ° f State ’ s 3th May and your telegram letter No'M and Provisional have received to-dav and J/n r ^ • ?° Py Forei ^ n 0ffice memorandum.

Such forts existed in 1857 on the Persian bank of the entrance of the Karun into the Shat-el-Arab. Again, not only Persian merchant vessels but also her men-of-war have habitually enjoyed the use ol the river and exercised police rights there. I am not aware of any evidence that Persians could not navigate river without being liable to lurkish dues, as stated at page 12 of memorandum. On the'whole, however, 1 am of opinion, provided we can secure adherence to the mid-channel line for old established purpose such as jurisdiction over islands, responsible police arrangements, and exercise of fishing rights, Persian Government will have no reason to interest them selves, and we might then agree to the proposed Turkish Commission, our own representative on the board being explicitly permitted to represent Sheikh of Mohammerah’s interest.(ZT7 J In any further communication on this subject, please quote no. 22191/12.

Grey proposes at the same time to inform the Russian Government that the prospects of a favourable award in regard to this portion of the frontier if the matter is referred to the Hague Tribunal are uncertain, and that, in these circumstances, he proposes to inform the Ottoman Gov ernment that His Majesty’s Government cannot conclude certain pending negotiations in regard to other British in terests in the Persian Gulf, or acquiesce in the desired increase(22191/12). increase of the Turkish Customs duties, unless the Turkish Government formally undertake not to disturb the land frontier as locally observed near Mohammerah, He will further suggest to the Russian Government that this is a solution to which, in his view, the Persian Government could not reasonably object, inasmuch as it would secure to Persia a frontier more favourable than that indicated by the line of the Mediating Commissioners, which Persia conditionally accepted sixty years ago. 7 With regard to the boundary 7 between the Persian Gulf and Piaji - that is, so long as it follows the course of the Shatt-el-Arab - His Majesty’s Government have already expressed to the Russian Government the view that a frontier more advantageous to Persia than the mediating commissioners’ line of 1850 could not be successfully claimed against Turkey, and the Russian Government have intimated their concurrence.

THE Government of His Britannic Majesty and the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan of Turkey, being desirous on account of the magnitude oi their interests in the trade on the Shatt-el-Arab to improve the navigation of that river, and to diminish the risks to which commerce thereon is exposed, have agreed as follows:— 1. The navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab shall be open to the ships of all nations. 2. The Imperial Ottoman Government will establish a Commission m which shall be vested the control of the Shatt-el-Arab from Kurna to the sea. i i 3. The Commission shall consist of two members only, to be appointed by the Imperial Ottoman Government. One of these two members shall be of British nationality, and shall be selected from candidates suggested by the Government of His Britannic Majesty. p rp AAA r 4. Each of the Commissioners shall receive annually a salary oi A 1. 2,0UU tree of all deductions. These salaries shall be paid out of the receipts of the Commission. 5. The Commission shall appoint such officers and employees as may be necessary, but the Chief Engineer shall be of British nationality. Hie salaries of such officers and employees shall be fixed and paid by the Commission. 6. The Commission shall be charged with the following duties (a.) The execution of such works as may be necessary, and as the funds at its disposal will allow, for the improvement of the channel of the river and of the approaches thereto on the seaward side. (b.) The provision of such wharfs, quays, docks, jetties, and other facilities as may be required for the traffic of the river. (c.) The control, so far as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of this convention, and subject to the treaty rights of foreign Powers, of the wharfs, quays, docks, and jetties in or on the banks of the river belonging to private persons. [d.) The maintenance of the channel of the river free from obstructions of all sorts, so as to keep it in the best possible state for navigation. (e.) The preparation, issue, and enforcement of regulations for the navigation of the river and for the policing of the river and the land and buildings held by the Commission. (/.) The control of pilotage. (g.) The buoying and lighting of the channel, and the maintenance and control of such lights and buoys in the approaches to the river as may be placed under the charge of the Commission. 7.

The cost of such land shall be paid by the Commission. In cases where land to which fishing rights are attached is acquired by the Commission, no unnecessary interference with such fishing rights shall take place. 8. In order to cover the expenses of the works undertaken and the services maintained by it, the Commission shall, subject to the principles laid down in article 9, levy upon all ships such dues as may be prescribed by it from time to time. 9.

The dues levied by the Commission shall not exceed the amounts reasonably required for the works undertaken and the services maintained by it. These dues shall be levied impartially, and no differentiation shall be made between the ships or goods of different nations or persons. 10.

(10055.) Telegram from Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to the Marquess of Creice. — (Com municated by India Office, May 24.) Muscat, May 23, 1912. APART from question of jurisdiction over waters of Shatt-el-Arab, which has been dealt with separately, following are salient points of my letter No. M. 85, dispatched to Government of India and London on 21st May, regarding Turco- Persian frontier, in reply to Mr. Parker’s memorandum of 3rd April:— Firstly, independence of Kaab. State ment at*p. 8 of Wilson’s precis shows Kaab to have been under Persia in 1620, that is, prior to date of Sultan Murad’s treaty. Moreover, available evidence tends to show that they never were really Turkish subjects. Secondly, ownership of the lands between the locallv recognised frontier and Moham- merah. * Local Turkish authorities have accorded unequivocal and repeated recog nition of present boundary by erection o marks and maintenance for many years ot permanent frontier customs post at Diaiji; such action should make it impossible ioi them after a lapse of sixty years to claim another frontier to which their pretensions are at least doubtful. It is hardly likely that they would get support from Hague Tribunal. „ t -t i a Thirdly, status in Turkey of sheikh and his tribesmen. Foreign Office seem to e unduly apprehensive in this legau . io visions of Treaty of Erzeroum appear to refer to nomad tribes only and not to settled agriculturists like these. ide} represent bulk of very large agucu ui&lt; community, and as Turks have no snip i_ population wherewith to rep ac t ien1, -i, seems extremely unlikely that t ie} ' attempt to oust them, even it they were i a military position to do so, v ut i . doubtful'. Problem has not caused much practical difficulty hitheito, am x probably adjust itself if left to the oca authorities. Sheikh of Mohammerah at all events, will adopt a reasona &gt;' a in his own interests. [70'i] 21 32 Comments by Mr. Parker. Firstly. I have no observations to make on this beyond what is stated in my memorandum of the 3rd April, 1912. A full history of the Chaab is contained in Major Rawlinson’s memorandum of 1844. I have already pointed out that the state ment on p. / of Lieutenant W ilson s precis to the effect that the independence of the Chaab was recognised by treaty is based on an erroneous reference and appears not to be founded on fact. But the point seems only to be of academic interest. Secondly. I have stated in detail in my memorandum the reasons why the prospect of a favourable issue of a reference to Ine Hague Tribunal seems uncertain: but the matter is admittedly one of speculation. Thirdlv. A separate memorandum this point is in course of preparation. on-V 2 Fourthly, boundary near Havize. From last paragraph of decision of mediating commissioners quoted at p. 49 of W ilson’s precis, it is plain that they neither visited Havize nor delimited any boundary on the spot in that locality, nor intended that their rough diagram should serve as a basis for demarcation. Again, local boundary described in my despatch No. M. 18, dated 6th May, proves to be practically identical with that proposed by Rawlinson at pp. 17 and]18 of his memorandum of 6th January, 1844, just received. Layard also suggested line west of Havize (vide pp. 8 and 53 of Foreign Office memorandum). Undisturbed pos session of Havize district is of most vital importance to Sheikh of Mohammerah, and it is inconceivable that we should tolerate any alteration of status quo in it, especially when Rawlinson stated categorically in 1844 that it was not in dispute. Fifthly, policy of Sheikh of Mohammerah in purchasing land in Turkey. It is a misapprehension to suppose he is seeking territorial encroachment. Such a contin gency does not arise, for in regard to these lands sheikh, like any other foreign land holder, is in position of a Turkish subject and is amenable to Turkish land laws. Fourthly. The boundary commissioners visited Hawizeh in February 1852, but only after they had drawn the line. When Sir P. Cox receives Sir E. Grey’s telegram No. 335 of the 11th April, 1912, to St. Petersburgh he will perceive that “ His Majesty’s Government ivould strongly deprecate, on account of the local incon venience which would be caused, the disturbance of the frontier even as locally observed near Hawizeh.” I think Sir P. Cox is mistaken in saying that the mediating commissioners did not intend their diagram to serve as a basis for de marcation: though they did not intend it as a detailed basis. Sixthly, 1 have urged that we inform Turks that, having been close observers of the status quo as interpreted locally on the Shatt-el-Arab and in Arabistan for the last sixty years, we have reasonably [?] guaranteed [?] its permanency, and have entered into engagements with sheikh from which we cannot recede and which pledge us to maintain it. This intimation will be no surprise to them, having regard to in timation made to Bussorah authorities by consul at Bussorah referred to at p. 61 of Wilson’s precis. Seventhly, I have suggested that, in Fifthly. The misapprehension rests on the following passages quoted from pp. 58 and 59 of Lieutenant Wilson’s precis :— “ When reproved by the Persian Governors of Arabistan for favouring this policy (i.e., of land purchase in Turkey), the Sheikh of Mohammerah used to reply that he did so from patriotic motives and with the strategical object of securing from hostile intiuences areas of Turkish territory adjacent to that of Persia. “ The acquisition of lands of Umm-al-Rassis and Umm-al-Khassasif, opposite Mohammerah and Failiyeh respectively, and of the Diaji lands on the Turco-Persian frontier was used to illustrate this point of view, which found ready acceptance, and the purchase of the islands of Shamshamiyah by the Sheikh in 1909 may be quoted as another instance of this policy, although it is doubted whether it has ever been so regarded by the Sheikh. It is certain, however, that the almost complete absence of active frontier disputes in Arabistan and the Shatt-el-Arab is in no small degree due to the fact that the Sheikh of Moham merah is the actual owner of all lands in the neighbourhood of the Turco-Persian boundary, and of all islands in the Shatt-el-Arab which might form objects of dispute.” Sixthly. It is doubtful whether our assurances to the Sheikh of Mohammerah can be so interpreted as to pledge His Majesty’s Government to maintain the status quo as locally interpreted, even in face of an adverse award by The Hague Tribunal. It is not clear whether the status quo here referred to is that of the frontier, or whether it is intended to in clude the exercise of jurisdiction by the sheikh on the right bank of the Shatt-el- Arab, even if the Turks object to the exercise of such jurisdiction : on this latter point vide supra, under “thirdly.” Seventhly. Zohab lies largely withinboundary question as regards Arabistan without recourse to Hague Tribunal, we might support Turkey in their claim to the Zohab lands, which in 18j)l [?] they — proposed to take in exchange for abandon- *V mentof their [? lands] in the Arabistan 'region. Their claim in the Zohab region seems fairly strong, and might be sup ported by ns on condition that oil com pany’s concession at Kasr-i-Shirin was obtained and confirmed by them. This might even be an advantage to the com- pany. Eighthly, I have urged our interests in South Persia now centre mainly in Arabistan, and are bound up with the maintenance of the sheikh’s position. Thus we have everything to lose by failure to preserve well-established status quo, a course which will greatly discredit value of our engagements in the Gulf generally, and sow seeds of doubt and distrust in the breasts of other native rulers and com munities with whom we are in relations. In this connection I believe improved and trustful attitude of Sheikh of Koweit is due less to what we have done for him personally than to his innocuous [? in genuous] appreciation of the patent value of our support for his friend the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Please also see admirals letter of 6th May, in which I concur. Lastly, I would observe that recent marked and persistent endeavours of the Porte to take advantage of our friendly attitude during negotiations, in order to prejudice local status quo to their advantage in regard to various issues under dis cussion, entirely bear out apprehensions expressed at conclusion of joint Indian and Foreign Office minute of -4th April; and I respectfully urge that unless we can in duce Turks at early date to comply with our requirements we should consider expediency of breaking] off negotiations and asserting ourselves effectively in the Gulf at the points where our claims conflict. (Addressed to Government of India, repeated to India Office.) I am not sure what correspondence is here referred to. Eighthly. There is a consensus of opinion as to the importance of securing the most favourable settlement possible for the sheikh.

We have the honour to submit the draft of an Anglo- Turkish convention for the future conservancy of the Lhatt-el-Arab. In view of the history and wording of Article 2 of the Treaty of Erzerouiii (1847} we consider that the iiirkish claim to the ownership of the whole waterway is so strong that it cannot successfully be disputed, especially oefore the Hague Tribunal: we are further of opinion that no practical advantage would be secured by Persian representa tion. The draft is accordingly based on the assumption that the proposed riverain commission will be nominally xurkish ana not international. But while investing the commission vdth a Turkish facade, we have sought to further the general interests of navigation by placing the police control and supervision of the technical work in the hands of The Right Honourable Sir Edward Grey, ' * * Bart., K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c.

As the quarantine arrangements at Bussorah are at present under the control of the Board of Health at Con- stantinople, it has not appeared advisable, or indeed commission any control of P° ssible, to give the riverain quarantine in the Shatt-el-Arab it is not impossible As regaras the levy of dues, tb . t it », te objected to b, other Po.er. « » infringe- M „t of their righto under the O.pitul.ti.n., end neither + TnrViBh Government has the the comission nor the lurkien aove to enforce payment.

These are provided for in clause 6 (c) of the drait 88 ion convention, and the relations of the riverain comm to this company will be a matter for negotiation when the company is formed. By handing over to the commission, as prcpwed in article 6 (g) the lights and buoys in the approaches to the river, His Majesty's Government will be saveo .he of their maintenance, which will be a substantial sum. We have added at the conclusion of the era it convention an article specifying twenty years as the oeriod 0 f its duration. We have thought this would be better than attempting to render the convention permanent or indefinite in its duration. It will be .impossible for the commissioncornmiesion to carry out any substantial works tor u ne improvement of the river unless it is certain to last ior a reasonably long period, and, on the other hano, if a definite period of years is specified as the duration of the convention, it will be easier to withstand attempts on the part of the Sublime Porte to reopen the whole matter and negotiate a new convention.

To Sir H. Elliot, No. 140; September 5, 1874. Sir H. Elliot, No. 34 ; June 11, 1874. Aitchison’s Treaties, vol. vii, p. 149. Memorandum, June 19, 1874. THERE is no clause in any of our Treaties with Turkey either permitting or prohibiting the passage of British ships of war up the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, but, although the rigid of navigating the rivers and canals of the Ottoman Empire under the « British flag is not secured to British subjects by Treaty, the Porte would not appear to have ever officially announced that British ships of war were prohibited from visiting the internal waters of the Empire. The following is a short account of what has passed upon this subject:— In 1834 the Porte sanctioned, by a Firman, the_/ employment by the British Government of two vessels in the River Euphrates for commercial pur poses, and, as the water in the river was too shallow to admit of vessels being sent up the river from the sea, the vessels intended for this service were conveyed by Colonel Chesney in pieces to Scanderoon, via Aleppo, to Bir, on the Euphrates, where they were put together. In 1840 other vessels were sent out, which were also shipped in pieces, and put together at Bus- sorah.* In 1874 Her Majesty’s ship “ Philomel” paid a visit to Koorna, which is situated upon apart of the River Tigris close to the point where the Tigris and Euphrates join, and form the Shatt-el-Arab, * On the 13th September, 1842, 2nd April, 1846, and 15th January, 1861, Vizirial Letters were issued by the Porte relative to the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates by British vessels (copies of which are annexed). [ 721 ]' whereupon the Governor of Bagdad protested against the act in a letter to the British Consul- General at Bagdad, in which he said : — “The marine authorities write that the British corvette ‘ Philomel,’ which had arrived at Bussorah, has this day, at 1 o’clock early morning, proceeded up to Koorna. Owing to the improper conduct on the part of the Prench corvette in proceeding to the same place some time ago, the French Embassy at Constantinople as well as the Foreign Office of that Government being in communication with, and there being no permission for war vessels to pro ceed thither, I have herewith the honour to protest against the impropriety of the advance in that manner of the said corvette £ Philomel ’ without giving notice to Government, and to state that telegraphic orders may immediately be dispatched with a view to return back, and I may be soon informed with the affair.” To which the Consul-General icplied :— “It has always been supposed that the Shatt- el-Arab is a free river, and practically it certainly is so, and can scarcely be otherwise, Koorna being a chief depot for the exportation of dates; sea going craft under foreign flags are in the habit ot there taking in their cargoes; a French corvette visited that place in 1864, and last year Her Britannic Majesty’s ship ‘Vulture’ did the same, no objection having been raised in either case so far as I know. I request your Excellency will be so good as to inform me under what Regulation this new objection is raised, and what evil consequences are apprehended from vessels proceeding thither. “When fully informed of the ground of your Excellency’s action I shall be happy to refer the question, on which I refrain from offering any decided opinion, to superior authority.’’ To this the Governor of Bagdad replied:— “ It needs no comment that the part from Bus sorah to Koorna is not a free river, but the Turkish side with its dependencies, to the point below Bussorah on the Shatt-el-Arab, and specially both banks above Bussorah, being the real possession of the Ottoman Government, the entry of foreign merchant-vessels, and specially vessels of war, into rivers such as this, of which the fountain-head and outlet are situated within the dominion of the3 Ottoman Government, unless it be with the consent and acquiescence of the Government, is according to rules inadmissible. “The official telegraphic communication lately held, with respect to the visit to Koorna, the other day, of the French corvette being publicly known, and the advance of the said corvette f Philomel ’ further up than Bussorah to Koorna, amounting to an act of aggression, bearing similarity to an act of military invasion of boundary, it is this act of passing beyond rights and privileges upon which the protest and objection is based. “ Touching the statement as regards the visit last year or still before of certain corvettes, there is no record or information forthcoming with Government. “ If such occurrence has taken place, it must also be termed to have been an act beyond rights, through neglect of the rights of the Ottoman Government, as in the present instance, it is evident that there is no necessity that an irregular and unruly act should have a duration, or be taken as a precedent, and a pause being offered to expression on the question made with respect to the evil consequences thereof, I state that in consideration of the friend ship and amity existing between the two Govern ments the advance of the said corvette, at her own wish, in the manner stated, to a point which is no? open to vessels of war, being tending to bring about derangements of the rights of the Government, I accordingly herewith repeat the sense of my former communication.’' Upon this the Consul-General stated that he had “ directed Her Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Bussorah to take measures to prevent any armed British vessel from again visiting Koorna, pending a final reply to the reference of the question to Constan tinople;” and in his despatch to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople the Consul-General said:— r “As pointed out in my first letter to the Governor- General, it has always been supposed that the Shatt- el-Arab is a free river. Foreign vessels of war have on former occasions visited Koorna without any objection being raised. “ Sea-going craft under foreign flags are in the habit of there taking in their cargoes of dates, and ULF4 it would be an inconvenience to trade to interfere with them in so doing.” On receipt of this correspondence, Sir H. Elliot addressed an official despatch to the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which he said :— (i As hitherto, and even so recently as last year, Her Majesty’s ships of war have been in the habit of visiting Koorna, and as no notification has ever been made by the Sublime Porte of a desire that the practice might be discontinued, it is not with out surprise that I have seen the Governor-General of Bagdad take upon himself to designate as im proper the proceedings of the Commander of the ‘Philomel’ for doing what had been done before without protest or objection on the part of either the Sublime Porte or local authorities, with whom, till the administration of the important Province of Bagdad was directed by his Excellency Redif ^ Pasha, the Consular and other officers of Her Majesty’s Government have always maintained the cordial and friendly relations which it is the wish of Her Majesty’s Government to see cultivated. “Judging from his Excellency’s correspondence, it would appear as though he regarded the appear ance of the ‘ Philomel ’ in that part of the river as implying a doubt of the sovereignty of the Sultan ever it, and a more uncalled-for interpretation of such a simple act could not well be conceived. “ 1 have the honour, therefore, to request that, if at any time the Sublime Porte should wish to propose new Regulations, or to alter a practice that has prevailed in reference to the presence of ships of war in any part of the Sultan’s dominions, due notice of it may be given to Her Majesty’s Government, who will not fail to give such in structions as will insure from the Commanders of British ships of war every respect for the rights of the Sublime Porte. “In the meantime, however, I would beg that , orders may be sent to the Governor-General of Bagdad not to interfere with the existing Regula tions or practice without the previous sanction of the Porte, and to maintain, in his communication * with Her Majesty’s Cousul-General, that courtesy which we are entitled to expect.” In forwarding home the correspondence, Sir H. Elliot observed :— ■■V Admiralty; August 4, 1874. “ The tone adopted by the Governor-General, in protesting for the first time against a proceeding never before objected to, appears altogether un warranted, and I have consequently brought the case before the Porte by the note herewith inclosed in copy. “ Of the right of the Porte to exclude ships of war from the waters of these rivers, there cannot, 1 imagine, be a doubt; and I have not supported the view taken by Colonel Herbert, who alludes to the fact of sea-going merchant-vessels taking in their cargoes at Koorna; but I have insisted that if changes are to be made in the regulations or prac- - tice with regard to ships of war in Turkish waters they ought to be made known to Her Majesty’s Government, who would give the necessary in structions to the Commanders. “ Colonel Herbert appears to have done all that could be required, by assuring the Governor that no ship of war should ascend the river till the question was decided at Constantinople. “ The Commander of the French corvette alluded to in this correspondence does not seem to have shown an equal amount of discretion, for, as 1 learn from Count de Vogue, he had already received the intimation of the Governor, that he objected to her going up the river beforf the ship left Bussorah, and he went in defianc of it.” The Commander of Her Majesty’s ship “Phi lomel ” informed the Admiralty that no remon strance was made by the Turkish authorities to his going to Koorna, but, on the contiary, that when he arrived at Bussorah (in the Shatt-el-Arab) he saluted the Turkish flag, which was returned by a Turkish corvette, and that shortly after anchoring he received a visi£ from the Turkish captain, who informed him that he had been sent by the Admiralty to thank him for the salute, and to express his pleasure at seeing an English man-of-war at Bussorab. The Commander added that the English Vice-Admiral had inform^ him that by Treaty the river was free for all nations up to Koorna, and that Her Majesty’s ship^ “Vulture” had the year previously visited that place. But on the 5th September following Sir H. Elliot [721] Cwas informed that Great Britain had no Treaty stipulations with Turkey giving right of navigating the internal waters of Mesopotamia. In February 1875, the Porte threatened to with draw the privilege which had been granted to the “Comet’’ to navigate the Tigris, on the ground that she was in excess of the number authorized, and that she had been so metamorphosed as to have the appearance of a man-of-war; and Sir H. Elliot remarked, in his despatch reporting the fact, that during the whole of the conversation which he had had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, he “ was careful not to claim for Her Majesty’s Government a right to station a man-of-war in in land waters, but at the same time to let it be understood that a privilege which had been freely granted for so many years could not be suddenly withdrawn without giving cause to Her Majesty’s Government to inquire whether the Porte was ^animated by the same friendly feelings as formerly towards Great Britain.” After this the objections about the “ Comet ” were withdrawn. E. HERTSLET. Foreign Office, February 8, 1881. The place where the attack was made on the “ Khalifeh” is situated on the Tigris above Roorna.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100054541117.0x000002_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/272/1</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100054541117.0x000002</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/272/1</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 1846/1912 Pt 1 Turkey in Asia: Shatt al-Arab Riverain Commission</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1912/1914</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-03-21T10:09:32</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (143 folios)</extent></physicalDescription><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100054541117.0x000002#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
