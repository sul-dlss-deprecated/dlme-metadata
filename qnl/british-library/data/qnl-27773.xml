Cox ?/Mle at Basrah I interviewed separately six or seven old acquaintances among roemcers of divisional Council. Their attitude seemed to me to be entirely satisfactory and one or other of them expressed the following views (begins) Subject to assumption that progress especially in the matter of educational reform will be more definite and rapid as soon as civil government is established and that posts will be found for more important natives of the country, they ask for nothing better than the Administration and liberal treatment which they now receive. They disajprove and resent designs of extremist agitation in Bagdad and say that if concession is made to it they will ask to be separated from Bagdad. as to despatch of Amir they express view that his appointment is unnecessary and undesirable for many years to come, that at present it would be a grave burden on revenues of the country and they told roe that inhabitants of Bagdad could never agree in selection oi individual. Here again they urge that if an Amir is decided upon, the vilayet of Basrah in view of great cownercial, strategical and political interests and importance vested in port Basrah should have the rigit to demand separate treatment. I saw saiyed ±alib v.i o professedprofessed his complete conviction that British Mandate and guidance v/ere essential for the future progress of the country, eypressed his readiness to support policy in any way he , jould. Sheikh of Mohanmerah also expressed his confident conviction in loyalty of Saiyed Talih's : intentions. letter made earnest ^special appeal to me to support his request that his two young sons should be sent to England to go to University and complete their education. I told him that practically I would consult you in the matter.As he has/no income he would probably expect us to pay, but 1 think proposal is worth considering and shall be glad to know your views.

There is a certain mystery about it, as the attached letter is the first indication we have received that the War office have modified their attitude, hitherto resolutely maintained despite considerable pressure ffom the Foreign Office, of refusing to release Captain Bowman for civil employ. I think it would be desirable to obtain from the War Office the actual date on which Captain Bowman embarked.

Bowman at one time, and I do no know what may have passed between you about the proposed appoihtment. On the face of it, the salary suggested by Cox (£1250) does not seem to me excessive, considering all the circumstances. It is a good deal less than Bonham-Cartar is getting as Senior Judicial Officer, Baghdad, or than Major Hay is to have as Revenue Secretary. Personally I should not be inclined to press for a reduction. But the amount ou^^it no doubt to have pome relation to his total ii&amp;yptian emoluments, i.e. salary (760) plus Sir R.Graham, K.C.I.G., Stc., j.c. , Foreign Office. &amp;c. allowancesallowances, as to which the papers give no definite figures, as Bowroan is your man, and as the revenues from which he will be paid are your revenues ( in the sense that the surplus balance, if any, goes to the Treasury), the question of his emoluments is really your concern more than ours.

The evolution of the Arab will depend largely upon the facilities for educatio n which may be provided by the new administration. The only regular schools maintained by the Turkish Education Department were a normal school for teachers at Basrah, a secondary school at Basrah, and three primary schools at Basrah, Ashar, and Abul Khasib. The maktabs or mosque schools were a negligible quantity so far as education was concerned. After the occupation, the American Mission School at Basrah was subsidised from Basrah revenues on the understanding that it would provide at once sufficient teaching staff for the primary schools w r hich it w r as intended to open and that it w r ould also open a normal class with a view' to turning out three good pri mary teachers every year. The Mission School staff also undertook the general supervision of the primary schools wffiich were to be opened. In accordance w r ith the public wish, Arabic and English were to be taught concurrently in all the classes including the lowest. Arab parents w r ere greatly desirous of English education for their children mainly for commercial purposes. Primary schools manned by teachers from the American Mission are now in existence in Zubrir, in Basrah City and Abul Khasib, and between them they have a roll of not less than 220 pupils. Teachers have recently been provided for schools at Nasiriyah, Qurna and Amarah. The teaching in the Mission School is on the system known to pedagogues as the “group system”, by means of wffiich a boy’s faculties are developed to the maximum of which he is capable in regard to each particular subject, and he is taught more rapidly than if he were allocated to a particular class in which his position is fixed with reference to all the subjects studied by him. It is believed that this system is pursued in the primary schools by all the teachers supplied from the Mission. There are at present in the existing primary schools and in the Mission School from 12 to 15 students belongmg to the best Arab blood who are quali fied to proceed to the normal school for training and who have signified their willingness to do so. When trained, they will be valuable instruments for the spread of education. 55 The complete scheme of training in the Mission School at present embraces a ten years’ course, three years in the primary school, three in the middle, and four in the high school. In the high school, training has hitherto been given only on the lines of a normal school, that is to say, for the prepara tion of teachers, but a beginning has also been made with commercial training, steps have been taken to introduce a department of pharmacy and it is intended also to add eventually a department of agriculture and possibly one for manual f roi nine*COPY OF TELEGRAM. , 4 9 7 0 Viceroy(Controllnr of War Acjcounta) ^.ted Received at India From 8th Novd^It 30 a.oullth Nov, 431&amp; ABo India Office Political Departoent's letter Pol5Vl 24tb April last, to Captain K„Marrs c extending die leave until Sir P Cox's departure, Pol Finance Baghdad states Captain Marrs reported to Civil Comissioner 24th April last and thereafter should be considered as on duty.

From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 20th March 1917. P.-- Folio icing is summary of conclusions arrived at by Committee of War Cabinet after consideration of measures for future political control and administration of Mesopotamia and Arabia :— ( 1 ) His Majesty s Government, not the Government of India, to administer the occupied territories. ( 2 ) Basra to remain under British administration permanently, with Nasinyeh, Shatt-al-Hai, Kut and ]&gt;edrai as the western and northern limits. (.») Baghdad to be an Arab State, having a local ruler or Government, under a British Protectorate in every respect except the name. Baghdad will thus have no foreign relations, and its consuls will be accredited to His Majesty's Government. (4) Administration of Baghdad, behind an Arab facade, to be that of an Arab province by indigenous agency, and as far as possible in accordance with existing institutions and laws. In particular (a) though code of Irak will not be used, the local judicial system will be maintained, both in respect of personnel and law, only replacing Turk by Arab ; ( 6 ) in the same way, as regards adminis trative and executive machinery, the tribal system of Government and provincial and local councils, Ac., will be resuscitated and maintained; (c) there will be no disturbance of present land system; (d) no Asiatics from outside will be employed unless of Arab or Persian domicile or descent, the employment of Indians in any branch of administration being strictly discountenanced as inconsistent with the above principles, yl.s far as possible the same will apply to Basra vilayet. (5) In event of Basra not being annexed, a High Commissioner resident at Baghdad to be head of the ivhole administration of Mesopotamia, and a Governor subordinate to him to be placed in charge of Basra. In event of Basra being annexed, style of head of administration to be Governor of Basra and High Commissioner for Mesopotamia,' residing generally at Baghdad but having titular headquarters at Basra. In his absence, the Deputy High Commissioner at Baghdad', and the Deputy Governor, Basra, respectively, to act for him. ( 6 ) Amalgamation o f British Civil Service with that of the Soudan, possibly also of the Levant, same method being employed for recruitments and personnel being interchangeable. If British officers of Indian services are required at first, they are to be lent temporarily, under foreign service rules, and those who are now serving there are to be per nutted to offer themselves for permanent transfer. (7) Formation of Shiah Holy Places into a separate enclave which will not be under direct British control, and from which any irrigated o. in igable areas of importance will be carefully excluded. ( 8 ) A single British administration to control irrigation in both of the vilayets : similar arrangements to he made for conservancy and navigation of rivers. (9) Basra to control Koweit, Oman and whole of Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf. (10) Foreign Office to take over Aden and Hadramaut. (11) South Persia, including Fars and Arabistan, to be in the sphere of influence of the Indian Government. In conclusion, the utmost importance is attached to the consideration that from the very outset the administrative arrangements introduced into the Baghdad vilayet should conform strictly to the a}&gt;ove principles, bir F. Cox should at. once be instructed accordingly, with special reference to the fourth head. Any remarks you may wish to make on any of the above heads should be telegraphed with 'the least possible delay, in order that they may be considered by the Ifar Cabinet before their final decision is reached.T COPY OF TELEGRAM.

He rejoined his unit in November last, was wounded, and then left country with his Battery. If available he should proseed here at once in the pay of his 6 , , rank. Rapid growth of work and enlargement of scope for civil administration during the last few months has synchronized with urgent demand for expert Political Officers in North tfest 2x Persia MJ^at Bushire and with abnormal amount of sickness due m part to overwork, and I am very short of officers in consequence.

As will be seen from the attached’corres pondence i requested Embarkation Basrah to settle the matter for me, and though they forv/arded the papers to Suez the Embarkation Authorities there took no steps to trace my passage further than the Suez Best Camp, although it seems fairly obvious from my original letter, that the mistake occurred after my arrival at Port Said, and that therefore Embarkation Port Said v/ould be more likely to explain it. as the original Duty Passage was arranged by the Air Ministry, I now beg to request that the necessary steps be taken for me to recover the sum of Bs64/-.
