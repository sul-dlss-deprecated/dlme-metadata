Historical Sketch of the Iranian Army. From very early days the armed forces in Persia consisted of irregular cavalry furnished by the tribes, and militia supported by the provinces and chief cities of the Kingdom. After 1800 it was realised that foreign tutelage was necessary if the army was to be capable of protecting the country from Turkish, Russian or Afghan aggression. A perma nent force under the central government was formed, and was called the Nizam. At the same time began a series of foreign military mis sions which has continued with brief intermissions until the present day. British, French, Russians, Italians, Austrians and Swedes have all been employed at different times. In 1879, Russian officers were lent to form the cossack brigade This force, starting from a strength of 500 men, ultimately swelled in 1920 to a “ division ” consisting of 56 Russian officers, 202 Persian officers, 3,141 horses, 66 Russian N. C. Os. and 7,866 Persian other ranks organised into 28 infantry companies, 17 squadrons, five four-gun batteries and 14 machine gun sections of two guns apiece. It was located in detachments termed “ Otryads ” in various places of strate gical importance in Northern Persia. The Russian element in this force was eliminated in 1920 by the Persian Government at the re quest of the British. In 1911, Sweden w-as invited as a neutral power, inoffensive to either Russia or Great Britain, to provide officers to form a Persian Gendarmerie. This force expanded rapidly from 1911 to 1914 but on he i^ b r k ° f r ar t ? e regular officers were withdrawn to Sweden !n 1914 the regular infantry numbered about 13,000 under arms and scattered in many detachments. The rank and file were generallv unpaid, untrained and badly clothed, whilst the officers were useless The cavalry was organised almost entirely on a tribal basis, the men serving under their own leaders, and supplying their own houses, arms and equipment They served in detachments in their own districts and. though part of them were permanently employed to protect the main routes, the majority were only called out as their services were required xneir number amounted to about 38,000—only a fraction of the to^al force Avlnch the tribes could collect if they desired The artillery consisted of about five or six thousand men and there were in the country about fifty breach loading and one hundred muzzle oadmg field and mountain guns, but of these probably only half would be fit for service. In fact, the regular army, maintained on a form of conscription, was entirely negligible as a military instrument M0353CGS(Pub.l2 Though Persia remained neutral throughout the Great \\ar the country was the scene of considerable military activity, portions of it being occupied at various times by British, Russian and lurkish forces. In 1916, under pressure from Great Britain, the Persian Government agreed to the formation of the South Persia BiAes ^ er Britis officers ; the strength of this force was approximately 6 , 000 . At the end of the war the various forces existent were as follows (i) Military forces proper (administered either by the Persian War Office or by foreign powers)— The South Persia Rifles. The Cossack division. The Central Brigade. The Nizam in the Provinces. The Levy Corps in East Persia. (ii) Gendarmerie. The regular Swedish gendarmerie. The Amnieh (road guards) and similar bodies administered by local governors. (iii) Police. The regular police. The provincial police. •After the Coup d’Etat of 1921, which was carried out by the help of the Cossack division under the leadership of Reza Khan, and after the latter’s rise to power as Minister of War, considerable reorganisa- tffin of tL 'my took place. The South Persia Rifles were disbanded bv the end of 1921. The terms “ Cossack division , central brigade and “ Nizam ” were abolished and the three forces completely reor ganised, were termed “ Qushun ”. The Levy Corps m East Persia were disbanded. The regular Swedish Gendarmerie was reorganised and transferred from the Ministry of Interior to the Ministry of \\ ar. The Amnieh (road guards) were reorganised and the entire force brought under the Ministry of War; in 1939 they ^^^^lioeTJce armv and now number approximately 10,600. Ihe police lorce “CmiehT was reorganised, centralised and placed under the Muustry of Interior.3 In 1925 the Conscription Act was passed by the Majlis, which pro vided universal military service for two years by all male subjects of Persia reaching the age of twentyone, subject to the usual exemptions. After his accession to the throne in 1926, Reza Shah continued to be Commander-in-Chief of the Army, the Ministry of War being under his personal supervision. Further reorganisations were made as the army grew until prior to the present war the strength was approximately 105,000 all ranks, consisting of nine infantry divisions, five independent composite brigades, one independent composite garrison and one mechanised brigade. In the spring of 1940 it was decided to increase the strength of the army from nine infantry divisions to sixteen infantry and one cavalry division, but subsequent to the trade agreement which was signed with Russia in March 1940 it is believed that the expansion scheme w T as postponed or discarded. The additional divisions at present (Aug. 1940) average only about 4,000 men each. The value of the present Iranian army for war is difficult to assess. During the last fifteen years troops have operated successfully in many engagements with the tribes, and have been instrumental in carrying out the Shah’s policy of tribal disarmament. Such operations, how ever, have only involved comparatively small concentrations. Even under such conditions administrative arrangements have been bad, or even non-existent, and moreover much of the fighting was done by Amnieh or local levies, rather than by the regular troops. A large army has never yet been put in the field for operations against a foreign country, and owing to lack of administrative services and shortage of transport, great difficulty is likely to be experienced in maintaining in the field a force larger than three or four divisions. There is a considerable amount of modern equipment, but a lack of qualified technical personnel. Maintenance is poor. There is a shortage of officers, and tactical training is of a very low standard. Whether the Iranian army would resist hostile aggression is open to doubt. Without help from abroad it will be widely argued that there is no point in angering the invader— e.g., Russia, and exposing the population to his fury, by putting up a resistance which could only be futile. Given good propaganda, good leadership and training, however, the material is there.4 CHAPTER II. Military Geography. 1. Area and General Description. The total area of Iran is some 028,000 square miles (or about three times the size of France) of which the bulk forms part of the vast Irani an plateau—a million square miles in extent—which rises on the north from the Caspian Sea and the Turcbman steppe, on the east and west of the Indus and Tigris respectively, and on the south from the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea. The Iranian portion from the plateau is corrugated by a series of mountain ranges mostly of volcanic origin which with the excep tion of the Elburz range which runs from east to west, run generally from the north west to south east. The mean altitude of the plateau is from 3,000 to 4,000 feet while some of the ranges run for over a hundred miles at mean altitudes of 8,000 to 9,000 feet rising at some points to 15,000 feet and at Mount Demavend in the Elburz range to a height of approximately 18,600 feet. A strip of desert 800 miles in length and from 100 to 300 miles in breadth and running from the north west to south east traverses the centre of Iran. The country, with the notable exception of the Caspian coastal strio, is, on the whole, arid and the hillsides bare, but the heavy snow- falTin winter preserves their verdure till after mid-summer and affords grazing for the flocks of the nomads. Though the mountains are as bleak as those of Waziristan, the valleys, unlike those of the Indian frontier, almost invariably contain streams of clear and fast running water. These streams, as well as the water of the numerous under ground springs conducted in underground channels of considerable ingenuity, are used for irrigation and make Iran at land where arid and bleak mountains alternate with green and fertile valleys. The country is poorly supplied with rivers, none of which, except ing the Karun in the south and the mountain streams which rise in the Elburz and fall into the Caspian, find their way to the sea. The Karun alone of the rivers of Iran is navigable. 2. Climate, Meteorology and effect on health. For the purpose of describing its climate, Iran can conveniently be divided into three areas :— (a) The Caspian coastal strip.5 The principal unvarying features of this climate are :— (t) A moderate range of temperatures, 90°F. being a maximum rarely exceeded in summer, while frost in winter is unusual. (n) Diminution of the rainfall from N. W. to S. E., the annual rainfall at Resht averaging from 50 to 60 inches and at Asterabad a little under 20 inches. (in) Excessive humidity and heavy dews from June to mid Sep tember due to evaporation caused by the sun’s rays, the naturally swampy nature of the soil being intensified by the flooding of the rice fields at this season. The damp sticky heat is relaxing and the humidity so great that in the past local inhabitants used to sleep on raised platforms. Living conditions have, however, been much improved by the building of brick houses. Malaria is prevalent and it has been remarked that “ in the same parallel of latitude there is not a more unhealthy strip of country in the world ”. Horse flies abound in summer. Motor lorries usually prefer to travel by night in the summer months. From November to mid-April the climate is temperate. The spring and autumn are cool but enervating. (b) The Iranian plateau. The main characteristics are :— (i) A small rainfall and an intensely dry clear atmosphere which is, on the whole, stimulating and healthy. (ii) Regular seasons as in England but with sudden transitions from spring to summer and from summer to autumn. (Hi) A great range of temperature due to Iran’s inland situation. (iv) A sun powerful at all altitudes. The maximum and minimum temperatures are about 105°F. in July and about 20 °F. in February. In the southern and south eastern portions of the plateau a higher maximum, and among the high hills of the north and north west a lower maximum is experienced. The yearly rainfall averages about 8 inches, though in parts of the desert and in the south east of the plateau it is as low as 2 inches. A little rain falls in November. Snow may be expected in December, January and February, and most of the year’s rainfall occurs in March and April.6 (c) The southern coastal strip. The heat in summer in this area is intense, Bushire registering temperatures of 115—120°F. in August. Between July and Sep tember the excessive humidity renders the climate particularly trying. In December, January and February it is cold though the temperature does not descend to freezing point. The rainfall occurs from Novem ber to February and averages about 5 inches. 3. Communications. (а) Road system .—In no direction has the Iranian Government made greater progress than in the development of its roads. I he necessity of husbanding their financial resources, the great drain in expenditure caused by railway construction, the great distances to be covered, the mountainous nature of the country, and the severity of the winter climate (when in the space of a few months a heavy fall of snow is followed by almost all of the annual rainfall) limit the pro gress to be made, yet, despite these factors, a network of roads covers the country and connects up all places of importance.

It is possible that the line to the Turkish frontier will leave the Tehran- Tabriz line about Maragheh and run south of Lake Rezaieh. No. 3 has been completed and opened as far as Semnan. No. 4. 75 per cent, of the earthwork has been completed, but there is a shortage of rails, and it is not certain how far these have been laid. No. 6 was originally part of the system of the North-Western rail way of India. It was built in 1919 as an extension of the Quetta- Nushki line. At present the line is operated as far as Nok Khunki only. North of Tehran the highest point on the railway is the Gaduk Pass which is liable to be blocked by snow for short periods. The line can be quickly cleared by two snow ploughs which are available for this purpose. The trans-Iranian Railway is single track all the way. The ruling grades are—north of Tehran 2-8 per cent., south of Tehran 1-5 per cent. For a considerable part of its length the line runs through very difficult country and in many places very heavy revetment has been necessary to prevent earth and rock slips. The chances of cons tructing extra sidings or diversions are negligible. The line is very vulnerable to sabotage, particularly at the bridges, some of which have clear spans of over 200 yards. Theoretically the capacity of the line is about ten trains each way per day, but the practical maximum is not likely to exceed six trains each way. The rolling stock available is approximately :— 100 main line locomotives. 44 coaches. 1,700 wagons and box vans (940 without brakes). Owing to the low standard of maintenances, it is improbable that more than 60 per cent, of the rolling stock would be in commission at any one time. The number of locomotives available would there fore limit the capacity of the line to not more than two trains a day each way. The maximum train loads are—between Bandar Shahpur and Salehabad 800 tons net, and between Salehabad and Bandar Shah 400 tons net double headed.8 To carry these loads and maintain six trains a day each way, it is estimated that a further 200 locomotives and 2,500 wagons and coaches would be necessary. (c) Ports .—The chief Iranian ports on the Persian Gulf are Bandar Shahpur, Khorramshahr, Abadan and Bushire. Bandar Shahpur is situated at the head of the Khor Musa channel, about 30 miles from the open sea ; it is the southern terminus of the Trans-Iranian Railway. Khorramshahr is situated at the junction of the Karun River and the Shatt-el-Arab. It is the headquarters of the Iranian Navy. Abadan is situated on an island of the same name on the left bank, and about 30 miles up the Shatt-el-Arab. It is the oil port and refinery of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and is as modern, in many respects, as an industrial town. Bushire is situated on the Persian Gulf and consists of an open road-stead. On the Caspian the chief port is Pahlevi, where four or five ships can come alongside deep water quays. There are also ports at Naushahr and Bandar Shah, the northern terminus of the trans-Iranian railway. (d) Air .—The only passenger service in Iran is that which runs between Tehran and Baghdad via Kermanshah. A National Flying Club with headquarters in Tehran was founded in 1939 but its progress has been restricted owing to the present war. All large towns have their own telephone system. Wireless systems are controlled by the Government and stations exist at Tehran, Kermanshah, Shiraz, Meshed, Jask, Bushire and Khorramshahr. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company also have several stations in the area under their control. 4. Population. (a) Population .—The population of Iran amounts, most probably, to some ten millions, though no accurate official figures are as yet available. It is made up of a number of distinct Iranian races. The Iranian proper forms the bulk of the urban population. The most important of the others are the Kurds of the Western border country, the Lurs and Bakhtiaris stretching from the Pusht-i-Kuh to west Isfahan, the Quashgais and the Kurgelus around Shiraz and the Baluchis in the south-east. These were all, at one time, tribally organised, and still retain their distinctive ethnological and linguistic characteristics. Under weak Governments they possessed a high degree of independence and were of a factor of some political importance, and a considerable embarrassment to the central authority. This is no longer the case since their subjugation and settlement by H. I. M. the Shah, and they do not now play any important independent role in the country.Some 75 per cent, of the population are now engaged in settled agri cultural pursuits and the remainder form an urban class of artisans and small tradesmen. There is, as yet, no considerable industrial popula tion. There are also a number of Armenians resident in Iran mostly in Azerbaijan and Isfahan, and there are colonies of Jews at Tehran, Kermanshah, Hamadan and Isfahan. (b) Character—The Iranians are people of a high standard of intel ligence and mental agility, very quick to adopt new methods, customs, and superficially, new ways of thought. They have a sceptical cast of mind from which springs both their ready sense of humour and a certain apathy and callousness in their attitude towards life. In general they look with indifference on suffering ; on the other hand, they treat way-side beggars with more charity than most other peoples. Iranians have a different sense of time from that of Europeans and refuse to allow it to inconvenience them in any way. Punctuality is not generally an Iranian virtue. In spite of the great disasters which have overwhelmed Iranian civilisation in the past, they have enjoyed a refined culture for over two thousand years. One result of this is that they both practise and expect good manners. Rude and coarse behaviour always excites their contempt and dislike, and it is significant that among country folk, mannerless people are described as “ Bi din—without religion . No advantage is to be gained by ignoring this national trait, and an equal politeness should be shown to high officials and to peasant alike. Brusqueness or rudeness will never produce satisfactory results. Iranians are passionately devoted to their country and are equally offended by adverse criticism and patronising praise. They do not like foreigners and while they find the qualities of an English gentle man engaging, they incline to regard the English as the most danger ous, because the most subtle, of their potential adversaries. This belief is less prevalent among those who have been educated in Eng land. Iranians dislike being regarded merely as a people with a romantic past ; they prefer to be considered as a modern, advanced and scientific nation. Thev were severely persecuted for many years and showed a re markable bravery and constancy in their many trials. Persecution has now, for some time, ceased. 5. Coinage, Weights and Measures. See Appendix 1.&lt;W: 10 CHAPTER HI. Personnel. 1. Laws of military service. From 1842 to 1924 a system of compulsory military service existed in Iran, known as the “ Bonicheh ” system and based on an agricultural survey. Every district was assessed at so many “ ploughs ”, and for every plough Government was entitled to the services of one man. On December 25th, 1924, the first conscription law was passed and certain amendments were made on September 22nd, 1931. This law was superseded on June 19th, 1938, when the present Act came into force. By the provisions of this Act, every male Iranian subject (including Iranian subjects resident abroad) is liable to military service on reach ing 21 years of age. Exemption is granted to those physically unfit or under 5 feet in height, licenced doctors of religious law, superior eccle siastics of the Zoroastrian, Jewish and Christian religions, professors of science and theology, the only son supporting his parents or parent, younger of two sons if the elder is serving, one of two brothers of which the other has died in military service, and students studying abroad until their period of study is completed. 2. Terms of service and periods of training. The total liability for military service is 25 years. This period is divided as follows :— (a) Two years with the colours. (b) Four years in the Reserve, during the last year of which he un dergoes one month’s training. (c) Fourteen years in the 1st Supplementary Reserve, during which he undergoes six periods of one month’s training. (d) Five years in the 2nd. Supplementary Reserve. Voluntary extension of colour service is permitted and encouraged. If the volunteer is considered suitable, he is sent for a course of instruc tion to the N. C. Os. School of the division in which he is serving. 3. Recruiting statistics and reserves available. No statistics are published, but a calculation on the basis of 1% of that portion of the population inhabiting area where conscription is enforceable would give 60,000 as the estimate for the annual intake of conscripts. The intake for 1935-36 was (unofficially) calculated to be 45,000.11 Apart from material and financial considerations, the purely nume rical limit of the army which Iran could raise by a levee en masse would appear to be 300,000. This figure, deducting the present strength of the army, gives her a reserve of 200 , 000 . 4. Officers. (a) Regular combatant officers—recruitment, promotion and retirement. (i) Recruitment— The completion of a course at the Officers School, Tehran is the normal method of obtaining a commission. 1 upils from the secondary military schools of Tehran and certain secondary schools of the provinces with the necessary certificates of education are accepted as cadets. The duration of the course is two years After passing out cadets are gazetted 3rd Lieutenants and posted to u (H) Promotion up to the rank of captain is by selection and seniority combined. Promotion to field rank and above is by selection only. For promotion to the rank of Lieutenant 10/12ths of the requisite marks are given for seniority and 2 / 12 th for merit. For promotion to the rank of Captain 8/12ths of the requisite marks are given for seniority and 4 / 12 th lor merit. The necessary “ rank element ” for promotion to the various ranks is as follows :— 2nd Lieutenant 2 years as such before promotion to Lieutenant. Lieutenant 4 years as such before promotion to Captain. Captain 4 years as such before promotion to Major. Major 3 years as such before promotion to Lieutenant-Colonel. Lieut.-Colonel 2 years as such before promotion to Colonel. Colonel 4 years as such before promotion to Brigadier. (Hi) Retirement .—‘The age limits for the various ranks are as fol lows :— Combatant Depart- \ rms ments. Lieutenant Captain Major Lieut.-Colonel Colonel Brigadier Divisional General 45 48 48 50 50 50 53 56 55 60 60 6312 Officers of the following ranks or holding the following appointments can serve up to 69 years of age :— Corps Commander .. Chief of the General Staff. G. 0. C. Gendarmerie .. Judge Advocate General. (iv) The conditions of recruitment, promotion and retirement of regular specialist officers are believed to be the same as for officers of the various arms. Reserve specialist officers, naturally, perform their initial and subse quent periods of training (as do the rank and file also) in that branch of the army which is connected with their profession, e.g., medicine, engineering. (b) Reserve and Supplementary Reserve Officers. The rules for Reserve officers and Supplementary Reserve officers are contained in Chapter XI of*the Conscription Act, 1938. The cadre of Reserve officers is drawn from the lists of names furnished by the Ministry of Education. Holders of secondary and higher education certificates who are accepted for the Cadre of Reserve and Supplementary Reserve officers are sent to the Reserve section of the Officers’ School Tehran on the first day of Mehr (23rd September) every year for a course of one year. The pay of students at the Reserve Officers’ School during their first twelve-month period is on the same scale as that of other conscripts ; on concluding their course they receive thepaj^ofthe rank to which they are appointed. Students of the Reserve Officers’ School who pass their leaving examinations are granted the rank of officer in accordance with the Promotion Law. After conscript officers have left the school they are distributed by the General Staff among the various sections of the army as re quired. Conscript and Reserve officers who wish to continue their service as volunteers are recognised as volunteer officers in the conclusion of their two years at the Officers’ School. Note .—During their second year at the School, officers are paid according to their rank but their School expenses are deducted from their pay.13 Conscript, Reserve and Supplementary Reserve officers^ who at any stage of their service abandon the manner of living and charac teristics of officers, and whose retention ceases to be advisable, continue their service in all its stages in the rank of private and are expelled from the cadre of officers. 5. Warrant Officers and N. C. 0’s. (i) Warrant Officers.—There is a cadet college for warrant officers in Tehran. The number of pupils per course is 50. The duration ot the course is three years. Pupils must have at least 2 years service and be in possession of a certificate of primary education. On passing out, they are gazetted as 3rd Lieutenants and posted to units. A ormal- ly they cannot rise to a rank higher than that of Major. (u) N. C. O.'s .—There is an N. C. O.’s school in each large formation. Pupils must, on entrance be of a rank not lower than corporal vith 6 months’ seniority as such. On passing out they are promoted to 3rd Sergeant.14 CHAPTER IV. General Strength and Organisation. 1. Organisation, composition and functions in peace. Until early in 1940 the army was organized into nine divisions one mechanized brigade, five independent composite brigades and one independent composite garrison. In March 1940, as a result of the European war an expansion scheme was announced, and the official number of divisions is now given as sixteen infantry divisions, one cavalry division and a mechanised brigade. As a result of the Russo-Iranian trade agreement of March, 1940, however, it is rumoured that the proposed expansion will not now take place in full. Infantry divisions numbered from 10 to 16 average only about 4,000 men each and will probably not be brought up to the normal figure of about 8 , 000 . 2. Peace Strength and General Distribution. (a) No official information has been given of the peace strength under the new organization. (b) The following is the general distribution :— Tehran (Central Garrison) .. Two infantry divisions. One cavalry division. North west Tabriz .. .. One infantry division. North west Rezaieh .. .. One infantry division. Kurdistan (Senneh) .. .. One infantry division. Khuzistan (Ahwaz) .. . . One infantry division. Ears .. One infantry division. Mekran (Khwash) .. One infantry division. East Meshed .. One infantry division. Gurgan .. One infantry division. Gilan (Resht) .. One infantry division. Kermanshah .. One infantry division. Isfahan .. One infantry division. Kerman .. One infantry division. Ardebil .. One infantry division. Luristan (Khurramabad) .. One infantry division.15 3. Composition of Higher Formations. No formation higher than a division exists, but it is possible that an army corps of defence may be formed from the Tehran Garrison and will consist of two infantry divisions, one cavalry division and a mechanised brigade. 4. Composition and strength of a division—(Peace and War). Neither peace nor war establishments for a division exist. The organisation of the 1st and 2nd divisions (Tehran) is as follows :— Two cavalry regiments. Four infantry regiments (each three battalions). Two field artillery regiments (each six 4 gun Skoda 105 mm. 4-14 in. batteries). One mountain artillery regiment (six 4 gun Bofors 75 mm. 2 • 95 -in. batteries). One engineer battalion. The provincial divisions normally comprise :— Two cavalry regiments. Three infantry regiments. One artillery regiment (mixed). One battalion engineers. 5. Organisation, Composition and strength of air defence troops— (Peace and War). There are sixteen four gun batteries of 75 mm., tractor drawn, Bofors anti-aircraft artillery with a strength of 111 officers and men per battery. Ten of these batteries form part of the Tehran garrison and the remaining six are located in the provinces.CHAPTER V. Administration, Commands &amp; Staffs. 1. General. The supreme commander of the armed forces of the nation is His Imperial Majesty the Shah. The Shah is by no means a mere figure head, with the result that over centralisation is very evident in the army as it is also in the other departments of a despotic government. A Council of National Defence has recently been set up under the presidency of the Shah. It consists of all the Ministers and the Chief of the General Staff. 2. Ministry of War. The Ministry of War comprises twelve bureaux directly under the Minister himself, the most important being Tribes, Finance and Munitions. The Chief of the General Staff has six bureaux, as under 1st Bureau .. Organization, personnel. 2nd Bureau. . . . Intelligence, propaganda and ciphers. 3rd Bureau .. .. Operations, training, publications, anti air defence and music. 4th Bureau .. .. Armaments, supplies and recruiting. 5th Bureau . . .. Aviation, marine and police. ()th Bureau .. .. Military buildings, military schools and maps. The Chief of the General Staff is nominally the Minister’s technical adviser but acts independently. He is appointed without reference to rank or seniority directly by the Shah himself, as indeed are all other general officers. The Shah is cartful to select a Chief of the General Staff of mediocre ability and with no power or influence. The Chief of the General Staff and the Army Inspectors, although normally under the Minister of War, render their reports, etc. direct, to the Shah through his personal secretariat.3. Military Councils. An Army Council under the presidency of the Minister of War has recently been set up. It is composed of the following :— Vice-President .. .. The Under Secretary of War. 'Chief of the General Staff. Members G. O. C., 1 st Division. G. O. C., 2nd Division. .. &lt; Air Officer Commanding. Director of Intelligence. Director of Medical Services. Director of Recruiting. 4. Commands and Administrative Districts. For military purposes Iran was originally divided into fourteen areas which corresponded to the existing civil administrative boundaries, and also to the number of formations then existing. It is not certain whether any modification of the existing areas has been carried out in connection with the scheme for expansion of the army, which now- amounts to fifteen formations if the central garrison in Tehran is taken as one. The commanders of these areas are responsible for the command, training and administration of all military units in their area. They are constantly being changed a‘nd interfered with either by the Ministry of War or by the Shah himself, so that they have no real chance to show their ability or zeal. In the frontier districts the military commanders tend to loom larger than the civil governors. 5. The General Staff. The General Staff is very much under-officered and its work cramped by the Ministry of War. MC353CGS(Pub.)18 CHAPTER VL Infantry. 1. General Organisation and Strength. (a) General Organisation .—The infantry of the Iranian Army con sisted until recently of 40 regiments. The infantry of a division consists normally of 4 infantry regiments. The infantry units of the Central Garrison (I and II Divisions) are regarded as corps d’elite. (b) Strength .—The strengths of egiments (Hang-i-Piyade) in peace vary greatly according to their location and also to the time of year. The average strength is about 1,600 The establishment strength is :— officers 68 , other ranks 2,070. Its „ rmament consists of:— Machine guns .. .. .. .. 18 Light automatics .. .. .. .. 54 Mortars .. • • • • • • • • 6 Anti-tank and close support guns .. .. 6 Note. —The regiments of the I and II divisions of the Central Garrison have 27 machine guns and 81 light automatics. An infantry regiment (Hang-i-piyade) consists of:— Headquarters. Headquarters Company. Signal and close support Company. Three battalions (Gurdan). The Headquarter company consists of:— Pioneers. Artificers. Clerks. Stretcher bearers, etc. The Signal and close support Company consists oi :— One signal platoon. One anti-tank platoon of 6 guns—37 mm. (1-45 in.). One mortar platoon of three sections each of 2 mortars—Stokes Brandt 81 mm. (3-21 in.) A battalion (gurdan) consists of:— Headquarters section. Machine gun company (headquarters and three platoons). Each platoon is armed with 2 (BRNO) machine guns.19 0 Three rifle companies (Guruhan). Each rifle company consists of Headquarters and three platoons (Rasad) each of five sections. Nos. 1, 3 and 5 sections are rifle men. Nos. 2 and 4 are light auto matic sections. A rifle section consists of a leader, two rifle bombers and five rifle men (8 other ranks). A light automatic section has nine other ranks including three mule leaders. The norma) strength is 640 officers and other ranks. The following shows the chain of Command No 1 Sec No. 2 Sec.

The majority of units are known by numbers only. A few have names but these are now obsolete. Regimental colours which are also carried in miniature by battalions and even companies are all of the same colour and unreadable at a distance. They are quite useless as emblems. Respect for the colours is however now enjoined by the official press. 4. Anti-aircarft machine gun Units. The anti-aircraft regiment of the mechanised brigade has one battery of sixteen 15 mm. heavy Besa machine guns mounted in lorries. 5. Close support units—(when manned by infantry personnel). Mortar sections exist in infantry units of 1st and 2nd Divisions. These are armed with Stokes Brandt 81 mm. (3-21 ins.) mortars. A further large number have recently been received and are now being distributed to Provincial divisions. 6. Regimental specialists. (a) Signallers. Signallers are taken either from the cadre personnel or from the better educated of the conscripts. The signal personnel of an infantry regiment consists of 40 other ranks with 8 mules. Field telephones, helios, dags and lamps are used. ( 6 ) Regimentally employed men such as cooks, pioneers, etc., are usually selected on account of their civilian trades.21 (j?) CHAPTER VH. Cavalry. 1. General organisation and strength. The cavalry in Iran consists of 22 regiments of horse and 3 regi ments of camelry. 2. Organisation and strength o£ units. A horsed cavalry regiment ( Hang-i-Savar) normally consist* of:— Headquarters. Signal troop. One machine gun squadron. Four sabre squadrons (Aswaran). A machine gun squadron consists of: Squadron Headquarters. Two machine gun troops (Dasteh) each of two sections. Each of the sections has two machine guns (BRNO). A sabre squadron consists of:— Squadron headquarters (Signals, etc.). Four troops of three sections. Nos. 1 and 2 sections being sabre ; No. 3 a light automatic section. Both sabre and light automatic sections consists of a leader and six other ranks. The normal strength of a regiment is 720 all ranks. Its armament consist of eight machine guns and sixteen light automatics.22 The following diagram shows the chain of command : Regimental Headquarters. 1st Sabre 2nd Sabre Squadron Squadron.

The above organisation is not necessarily achieved throughout the army but is the organisation laid down. On mobilization a depot i* immediately formed. 3. Designation of units and regimental colours. All units are numbered. A few bear special names in addition. Regimental colours are carried by the Cavalry Regiments in Tehran.

Calibre .. 7-9mm. Weight with tripod mounting which U attached to the gun Magazine The action is similar to that of the Bren light machine gun but rimless ammunition is used. 3. Close Support Weapons. The troops of the Central Garrison and also Infantry units of R r °' vincial divisions are armed with approximately eighty 81 mm. (3*31 in ) Stokes-Brandt Mortars. This mortar fires a 7-lb shell to a maximum of 3,300 yards, or a 14-lb. shell to a range of 1,600 yards, with great accuracy. Maximum rate of fire 30 rounds a minute ; ordinary rate 18 rounds a minute. High explosive shell is ordinarily used, but smoke shell is also carried. It is very quick to bring into action and is transported in three loads—the gun, the carriage and the base, each weighing 40 lbs. 20 lbs. 11 ozs. 20 rounds.4. Ammunition. The manufacture of S. A. A. commenced in 1936, under the super vision of a Belgian, with a daily output of approximately 18,000 rounds. By September, 1936, this output had been increased to approximately 25,000 rounds. The arsenal is now under the supervision of German experts and the daily output has been nearly doubled. Machinery of German manufacture has been installed for the manu facture of artillery ammunition. The predicted output is said to be 100 rounds of 105 mm. Skoda and 200 rounds of 75 mm. Bofors per working day, but this will not be realised till the end of 1939 or the beginning of 1940. The powder factory at Parchin, which is under Swedish supervision, has been considerably enlarged. Its daily output is 50—60 cwts. The quality of the powder is said to be poor. The arsenals are situated in Tehran city and Sultanabad. The former is for rifles, wood work, etc., whilst the latter manufactures ammunition and guns.25 CHAPTER IX. Artillery. The artillery of the Iranian Army is organised into 94 four-gun batteries. The strength in personnel is 13,645 all ranks. Batteries are equipped as follows :— 12 batteries equipped with Skoda 105 mm. guns (short). 18 „ „ 105 mm. guns (long). 39 ,, Bofors 75 mm. mountain guns. 6 £ „ ,, Schneider 75 mm. field guns. *4 „ „ Schneider 75 mm. guns (1901 pattern). 2 „ „ Aboukoff 75 mm. field guns. 1 „ guns of British pattern. 14 „ „ Bofors 75 mm. A. A. guns. *Horse artillery. In addition 38 four-gun Skoda 105 mm. batteries are in the gun parks of Tehran Arsenal awaiting equipment and horses and 50 four- gun Bofors mountain batteries have been ordered and are ready in Sweden for delivery to Iran. The divisional artillery of each of the two divisions of the Tehran garrison consists of three regiments each of six tour-gun batteries. One regiment is equipped with Skoda 105 mm. short guns, one with Skoda 105 mm. long guns and one with Bofors 75 mm. mountain guns. Each regiment is organised into two groups containing a signal section and a reconnaissance section. Each battery has a signal section of 8 other ranks. The organisation of the artillery of the provincial divisions varies but generally each division has a regiment of 3 mountain batteries and 1 field battery. It has been decided to organise an artillery brigade, presumably of two regiments, for each of the provincial divisions. It is doubtful if this increase will be possible before the arrival of the 200 75 mm. Bofors guns, and even then difficulty may be experienced in providing horses and equipment. Six of the anti-aircraft batteries form part of the mechanised brigade and three are included in the 6 th Khuzistan division. Of the latter, one battery is in use, the remainder are in store. The guns of all mountain artillery batteries are carried on pack- mules. The artillery of the mechanised brigade is drawn by Marmon Harrington tractors. The remainder of the artillery is horse drawn.26 The horse drawn artillery of the Tehran garrison has heavy Hung arian horses which have been imported during recent years. The latest attempt to purchase more of these horses has failed and steps are now being taken to collect locally bred horses for the expansion requirements of the artillery. It is doubtful whether the attempt to collect these horses will produce sufficient animals for the proposed expansion of the artillery. Some coast defence artillery has been installed at places on the Caspian seaboard. The guns are probably 105 mm. Skodas but details of location are not available.27 CHAPTER X. Engineers. 1. Organisation, administration and strength. In peace and war the engineer arm of the Iranian Army is under the Minister of War, its activities being limited to field fortifications, field engineering, signal and barrack services. In peace an engineer battalion is commanded by a Lieutenant- Colonel (Sarhang dovum) and consists of :— Headquarters. No. 1 Sapper Company—4 platoons. No. 2 Sapper Company—4- platoons. No. 3 Signal Company—4 platoons. No. 4 Signal Company—4 platoons. No. 5 Depot Company—2 platoons. At present the allotment of Engineer units is as follows :— Division. Station. Battalion. Remarks. 1st Division Tehran .. 1st Battalion .. ^ Shortly to be ox- V panded to Regi 2nd Division Tehran .. 2nd Battalion ..

Iran is a signatory to the Convention, signed by various countries in 1925, agreeing not to use gas in war unless it is used by the enemy. 2. Defence. (а) Organisation, administration and strength. None. ( б ) Equipment. Respirators of German pattern are now being manufactured at the rate of approximately 300 per working day at the munition factory at Vanak, situated about 6 miles north of Tehran. It is believed that most of the units of the Central Garrison are in possession of res pirators.29 CHAPTER XH. Units Equipped with Armoured Fighting Vehicles. 1. General Organisation, Administration and Strength. The units of the Iranian Army equipped with armoured fighting vehicles and all mechanised units are organised into a mechanised brigade. This brigade forms part of the Tehran central garrison. The organisation of the brigade is as follows :— Headquarters 4 staff cars. One section motor cyclists 16 2-cylinder Harley-Dividson motor cycles. 1st Regiment (Anti-aircraft). One battery 16 heavy 15 mm. Besa machine guns mounted on lorries. Crew of six. Six batteries 75 ram. Bofors anti-aircraft guns drawn by Marmon-Herrington tractors. 27id Regiment (armoured fighting vehicles).

Signal Service. 1. Organisation of Signals Arm. The signal service forms part of the corps of engineers and is not a separate arm. In peace it has no independent existence but in war it may be separated from the other engineer organisations. It is res ponsible for the communications of divisions and larger formations. 2. Signal units in Commands and Fortresses. (Organisation, establishments and duties.) Divisional Signal. Each battalion of engineers has two signal companies, organised as follows :— No. I Signal (Construction) company of four sections. No. 1 Section equipped with field telephone cable and hand-drums. No. 2 Section equipped with field telephone cable and hand-drums- No. 3 Section equipped with horsed cable laying vehicles. No. 4 Section (Communication) equipped with 60 sets of field telephones. No. II (Communication) company of four sections. No. 1 Section (Visual) equipped with semaphore flags, heliographs and lamps. No. 2 Section (Visual) equipped with semaphore flags heliographs and lamps. No. 3 Section (Wireless) equipped with 10 field W T ./T. andR./T. sets. No. 4 Section (Wireless) equipped with 10 field W'./T. and R./T. sets. 3. Signals service in the field. (General organisation of line telegraph and telephone systems ; wireless telegraph and radio telephone systems). W/T and R/T sys tems. The same general principle is employed in all forms of mobile opera tions whether the force is in touch with the enemy or not. A main artery of communication is established for each division and all the resources of the signal service are devoted to the maintenance of this arterv. As a general rule, the telephone is the main instrument and is supplemented by wireless, pigeons and dispatch riders. 4. Cipher personnel. (Organization and duties). Specially trained cipher personnel forms part of headquarters of large formations (divisions).33 CHAPTER XIV. Police, Gendarmerie and Semi-Military Forces. 1. General Organisation. The civil police (shahrbani) wears a light blue uniform with a small French type helmet of the same colour. This body is nominally under the authority of the Minister of the Interior, whose delegate in each town or commune (Bakhsh) is the civil governor. In towns and communes of importance the civil police are under the command of a Chief of Police (Rais-i-shahrbani). The whole force is composed of approximately the following numbers :— Civil police in Tehran . . .. 1,300, of whom 400 are mount ed. Civil police in Provinces . . 0,000 Recruiting is local and is confined to men of exemplary record and good education who have completed the recognised period of military service. They are poorly and irregularly paid and bribes are accepted freely. The duties of the civil police are to maintain order and see that the law is respected, to protect, life and property. A special depart ment deals with the careful st rutiny and checking of all individuals leaving and entering cities and important points on the Main roads, 'fraffic police wear a special ai m band of green, red and white. The foot police are armed with revolvers and carry rubber batons during the day. At night they are armed with revolvers or carbines. Mounted police are armed with revolvers, rifles and sabres, both by day and night. A large number of plain clothes informers and detectives (karagah) are employed. 'Phis force constitutes the criminal investigation de partment (karagahi). Its duties are the investigation of all possible political movements of foreigners, and keeping the Government inform ed of all facts bearing on the security of the Sovereign and the State. 2. Recruiting, organisation and strength oi Civil Police Gendarmerie. The Iranian Gendarmerie (Aranieh) is organised (1) into Regiments whose duties are the policing of the roads and country districts; ( 2 ) Independent Battalions whose duty is the guarding of the frontiers. They wear a blue cotton uniform, khaki puttees and giveh (country shoes). Each Regiment or Independent Battalion has a special “ Bureau” for police work, such as courts of investigation, etc. MC353CGS(P)34 A Regiment of Gendarmerie is not divided into Battalions but is composed of 6 to 9 companies, each of which has nominally one company officer, tliree platoon commanders, and 150 N. C. Os. and armed policemen, consisting of one platoon of infantry and two pla toons of cavalry. An Independent Battalion is composed of 4 to 0 companies. The Gendarmerie is armed solely with old pattern rifles of various makes : Russian, French and even some English carbines, etc. They have not so far been issued with automatic weapons of any sort, lor discipline and administration the force is under the supervision of the G. O. C. of the Division in whose area they are stationed. For police admimstration work, they come under the local civil authorities. The Gendarmerie Force consist of 10 Regiments and 16 Indepen dent Battalions. 3. Recruiting, organisation and strength of Military Police. No military police exists as a separate organisation. All units and garrisons have a number of armed military sentries for temporary duty as military police (dezhban). They are distinguished by a red armlet. Their chief duties are the maintenance of order and military discipline outside the barrack areas and the prevention of the escape of conscript soldiers.CHAPTER XV. Uniform. 1. The Army. (а) Officers. —Officers wear a khaki tunic with high collar, breeches and black field boots and spurs. Their peaked hats are very much after the German style. Sam Browne belts and swords are invariably worn. (Revolver German make, field glasses, haversack and water bottle are arrieq on Field Service.) ( б ) Bavks. —The uniform worn is a khaki tunic with a high collar, cut like a smock, khaki breeches, puttees and boots. On service a khaki Kepi of soft type is worn. For ceremonial parades an ordinary khaki peak cap is worn. The steel helmet worn by the troops is of German pattern. The piping of the shoulder straps denotes to what arm the soldier belongs. (See Plate 1. Yellow is infantry ; red cavalry ; blue artillery ; light blue engineers ; maroon doctors, vets.). 2. The Air Force. (a) Officers. —Officers wear dark blue uniforms with the badge of rank on sleeves as follows:— Sub - Lieutenant One gold ring. Lieutenant Two gold rings. Captain Three gold rings. Major One wide gold ring and one narrow. Lieutenant-Colonel One wide gold ring and two narrow. Colonel One wide gold ring an* three narrow. General Laurels. (b) Banks .—The Air Force ranks wear a greyish blue uniform, tunic, breeches and puttees with boots. 3. Navy. The uniform worn is similar to that of the French naval uniform.36 CHAPTER XVI. Military Air Force. 1. General. Military aviation in Iran, which had its beginning in 1924 with the purchase of a small number of French, Russian and German aircraft of different types for the Persian army, remained until 1932 of little or no consequence. During this period the strength of the air force was occasionally increased by the purchase of aircraft, mostly of the D. H. 9-A., type from Russia, but in spite of these increases, which totalled 37 aircraft, the air force remained an insigni ficant and badly organised branch of the army. During the last few years a serious effort has been made to remedy this state of affairs and in keeping with the Shah’s policy of total re-equipment of his armed forces, the air force has now been provided with modern service and training aircraft. With the exception of 10 aircraft obtained from the U. S. S. R. in 1938, all aircraft purchased for the Iranian air force since 1932 have been obtained from Great Britain. Efforts have been made by both France and the U. S. S. R., to gain a predominating influence in Iranian aviation, but neither has been completely successful. French influence has made itself felt to a certain extent through the training of Iranian officers in France, where nearly all the best officers have received their military education. On the other hand, prior to 1932, the majority of Iranian military aircraft were obtained from the U. S. S. R., and a certain number of pilots received their training in that country. When the reorganisa tion and re-equipment of the air force was undertaken in 1932, the Shah turned to one of the smaller European countries for his air advisers and engaged a Swedish officer. Captain Nordquist of the Swedish air force, as Air Adviser, and a number of other Swedish officers as flying instructors. In 1934 these terminated their engage ments and a Belgian Air Adviser, Colonel Bevir, and seven N. C. O. instructors were engaged on a two-year contract. I he contract of Colonel Bevir only was renewed in May 1936. His contract finally expired in 1939 and his services were dispensed with. It is improbable that tb - Iranians will seek further help from foreign missions. In November 1936, an Iranian Air Mission visited British, German and Czechoslovakian aircraft factories, and it appeared that an immediate expansion of the air force was under consideration. Major interest was shown in British aircraft, although both Germany and Czech oslovakia offered more favourable financial arrangements and stated that thev were prepared to give early delivery of any aircraft ordered on a reciprocal trade basis. The continuous dram on the37 financial resources of the country occasioned by the Shah’s heavy expenditure on internal communications and railroad projects would appear, however, to have necessitated amendments in the proposed expansion of the air arm, and the only orders for additional aircraft which had been placed up to the end of 193b were for 30 Hawker “ Hind ” light bombers. These were delivered in 1937. Since that time further aircraft have been purchased. Air frames for some of the Tiger-Moth and Audax aircraft taken hi to service by the Iranian air force have been built at the Doshantappeh factory in Tehran. Up to 1932 only officers were trained as pilots and, as there was no form of direct entry into the Iranian air force and no central train ing establishment for cadets, officers were selected from volunteers from the regular army. This system was found to be unsatisfactory, as the number of volunteers forthcoming was insufficient for the needs of the air arm, and the mechanical side of the service did not attract the right type of officer. The original system of obtaining all flying personnel from volunteers from the commissioned ranks in other branches of the army was in consequence abandoned, and from 1932 onwards an increasing number of N. C. O., pilots have been trained. In 1936 it was decided to raise the number of N. C. O., pilots to 60% of the total flying strength of the air force. The National Flying Club -w ill provide a reserve of pilots. 2. Higher Command and Administration. The Iranian air force is part of the army and is commanded by an Air Officer Commanding, with headquarters at Tehran, subordinate to the Ministry of War. 3. General organisation, distribution and strength. The Iranian air force is at present organised into four regiments, a flying training school and an aircraft factory. When sufficient air craft are available, regiments will have three squadrons each. At present, types of aircraft are mixed within squadrons. Regiments are located as follows:— 1st Regiment 2nd Regiment 3rd Regiment 4th Regiment Aircraft Factory Flying School Qila Margha (Tehran). Tabriz. / Meshed Ahwaz. Doshantappeh (Tehran). Mehrabad (Tehran).The strength of aircraft in February 1940 was as follows :— In service :— Hawker “ Hind ” . . . . . ■ • • 3ft Hawker “ Fury ’ .. . . .. • • ^4 Hawker “ Audax . . . . . • • 63 D. H. Tiger Moth . . .. . . . • 92 Hawker “ Hurricane ” . . . . . . 1 Total .. 215 There are also three Airspeed Oxford training machines. An attempt is being made to obtain the aircraft:— following additional Hawker “ Hurricane ” 35 Wellington Bombers 30 Blenheim or Beaufort Bombers .. 30 Curtiss fighters (American) 30 Total 125 Note 1.—The above table of strength is based on information given by the Iranian Minister of War to the British Military Attache in February 1940. The figures represent an increase of 7 Audex and 20 Moths over a previous return dated 20th November 1939, and no explanation is available for this difference. In any case the Moths are useless for military purposes, and many of the other aircraft are old and probably of little use. As a fighting force the Iranian Air Force is of little value, and the figure of 215 aircraft may be mislead ing. Note 2.—It is very unlikely that Iran will obtain any of the additional aircraft mentioned for the time being. The pilot strength in June 1939 was approximately 230 trained officers and pilots, and 250 students undergoing training at the Mehrabad Flying School.39 4. Maintenance. The Aircraft Factory and maintenance shops are at Doshantappeh (Tehran). The engine repair is reasonably efficient for fuselage repairs. Ready made spares are not abundant and may be regarded as only normal for peace time requirements. Many spares are manufactured in the production shops.40 APPENDIX L Iranian Coinage, Weights and Measures. 1. Coinage. The basic unit is rial which is subdivided into 100 dinars. 100 rials=\ pahlevi. Under the Government control of foreign exchange, the rate was fixed at 80 rials to the £ but this is no longer so. The old kran is still in use, and is the equivalent to the rial. 2. Weights. In theory, the metric system is in force, but as the older weights and measures are so commonly alluded to, it is necessarv to describe them. The unit of weight was the miskdl (71-fi grains), subdivided into 24 nakhods (2-96 grains) of 4 yandom (-74 grain) each. Sixteen miskdls make a sir, and 40 .sr-l batman (Tabriz). Most articles are bought and sold by a weight called batman or man. This differs in different parts of the country.
