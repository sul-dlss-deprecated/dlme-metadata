From To Cox Kuwait Foreign repeated Sec. of State Po litical Baghdad H.C.Cairo No. B 95 Dated 30.8.18 (l!'0O) Reference Baghdad telegram No.6492.dated August l?th. The^ re are two separate Questions at issue affecting Shaikh f of furait firstly Blockade secondly raids by Ajman etc. through Kuwait territory . After discussion with P.A. and Shaikh I offer V following observations. In first connection protest and complaint of Philby on behalf of Bin 3a'ud were evident, y based on misunderstanding of wording of Politic^. Agent's letter to Shaikh of Kuwait of July 4th in which he spoke of'removal of Blockade ' . Blockade measures have never ceased # the cnange was that permits instead of being issued by British Officer wereto be issued by Shaikh^ son subject to general supervision by of Britidi Officer. This was explained to Philby by P.A. in subsequent letter .Arrange ment has been working satisfactorily and no permit has yet been applied for by any Najd caravan ,so that it is not possible that any specific cause of complaint can have arisen. However in order to give Ibn Sa'ud no handle for impugning arrangements Shaikh has agre ed to Blockade Officer scrutinising and signing all permits for Najd. Thus the only exports now al_o..ed from Kuwait will be - One • To Majd on permits signM by Blockade Officer on voucher and demand of Ibn Sa'ud's agent. Two. To Iraq tribes on production of permits from their Political Officers. Three. To tribes of Shaikh of -‘-uwsi t vouched for by hims If strictly on basis of minicLum requirements. Thisa rrangement is practically indistinguishable from for mer arrangement which Philby extolbed as being effectlve and appreciated in lIajfl.|^As regards suggests despatch of troops. Having made the Shi kh a friendly com.:unication on July 5th regarding Blockad* and no case of illicit expert or raiding having occurred since that date there can be no logical reason for occupying Kuwait now at all events so far as blockade isAs regards raids from Occupied Territories against Bin Sa , u4*s tribes through - uwait limits position Is obviously diffiuult and remedy rests no less v/ith us than with Shsl kh of Kuwait. After discussion withiatter following measures are proposed • firstly occupation of 3af /an wells by a British pcB t.Sec ondly occupation of Jaharah and other Kuwait wateriiig holes in vicinity by Sh&amp;kh's levies subject to periodical visit from Politica Agent• Three occupation of Hafar wells on boundary of Kuwait territory by Inbn Sa’ud . Siiaikh Salim haa no objectl oa to thla. I will suggest what separate measures Ilesopttamian author .ties can tahe to control raiding instincts of Ajman and Aslam from our territory after reaching Basrah. Political Agent asks me to explain that 7/hen he suggested employment of mobile column it was not with view to occupation of Kuwait but for location at Jahar&amp;h 20 miles west oi Kuwait in co-Operation with Shaikh’s levies. 0 , 4 J , t A ' / • , Ip a (a itfrj) f \Enclair Telegram.

Political Baghdad Foreign Simla, repeated Secretary India and Hi^i Commissioner, of State for Cairo. No. - 6490 Dated - 7th. August 1918, On July 9th. I communicated to Philby for hie informa tion as a matter of routine the purport of recent reports re the activities of I bn Rashid, Phil by replies under date July 24th. by telegraph from KoTsit as follows Thou£$i not expliitly indicated understand these A telegrams designed rouse Ibn 3aud to activity to prevent realisation any plans by pressure hero. Accordingly corrmunicated news as desired and suggested it was time to get move on. This morning he sprung on me long written document in which he reviews trend of recent events and adopts attitude that his undertaking to act in our interests against Ibn Rashid etc., was made on understanding thatTIt/o would protect his interests vis a vis Sharif,Ajman Kuwait etc.. But recent events have materially altered situation and not being properly protected by us against enemies besetting him all round he cannot with due regard to his o’m interests launch out against Ibn Rashid or accept responsibility for leakage of supplies to enemy unless we give him definite guarantees. I attach much importance to fact that he has put his grievances into writing in reply to my summons to act ion.On my pointin~ out that he hod not yet carried out his part of bargain for loalt received he replied he was prepared to refund loan rather than risk disaster by leaving his flanks unprotected from Ajman and bTieirif. He demands following explicit guarantees as preliminary to any further action on his part or acceptance further resooneibiliby blockade,namely One, British Government to guarantee absolute immunity of his territory and people from any kind of interference or attack by Sharif. This of course comprises the Khurma andand At aba disputed border lajid pending settlement. wWo. Guarantee be given that Ajnaan and ^ianaar elemonta ujider our protection should on no account enter hie territory for any purpose whatever without his consent.Those not under our protection on no account to be allowed enter our territory or Kuwait, ^usabilla to be given to friendly elements only on onthly ration system on basis actual numbers present^ w s to unfrimidly elements. Three. As long as blocko^e of Kuwait remains in hands of Ibn Subah declines all responsibility for loakage to enemy and suggests either that blockade be resumed by British or a! goods for Najd be landed Bahrain or Hasa ports. In either case he accepts full responsibility. And four. That above guarantees being given on our part and hostilities against Ibn Rasnid begun on his we will not let him down by withholding sinews of war as necessary. This means money. Having carefully considered this document came to following conclusions One. Further incuroions of Sharif or Ajman will certainly lead to widespread disturbance and must be stopped at all co sts. Two .Maintenance effective blockade is entirely in our kxxdi interests and methods suggested are only possible alternative And three. Above all urgently necessary to involve Ibn Baud in hostilities with Ibn Rashid without delay partly to keep his mind from preying on other grievances and chiefly to obviate all possibility of his combining with Ibn RaaHid to attack Sharif* Latter contir^ency by no means impassible if we leave him in lurch by refusing redress grievances and would be extremely oopular rove ar'ong people. In these circumstances and in vi^w of unmistakable evidences of increasing; estrangement of Ibn baud and urgency of obliterating unfavourable impression caused by recent events, have taken responsibility of giving written undertakinr in following terns namely One. Ve guarantee him immunity from further attack by Sharif or Ajuian and Shammar elements under our protection3. protection and to refuse protection and rausabilla to hostile el emends. Two. /e will rectify blockade arrur^anents in some manner acceptable to him or if unable to do so will not hold him responsible for leakage of supplies. And three. will see that his material resources do not suffer by reason of any hostilities undertaken by him on our behalf. • But I have explicitly stated that above undertaking is conditional on his fulfilling hi a promise to undertake hostilities at once and on his setting* out from Riyadh within ten days from to-day. This on his part ho undertakes to do, # I have added that if Government unwilling or unable sndora* my guarantee or act on their, shall not expect him to fulfil his part of bargain. Matter now at oxiana critidal stage and everything depends Government’s decision this and previous telegrams. Trust iry guarantees ^ill be favourably considered and formally endorsed without delay. iUso that screw may be put a| upon Dhari and Ajman. Ac regards money in view of Turks reported generous treatment Ibn Rashid audiossibility of increased activity by him request question of placing liberal funds at my disposal be considered if really vigorous campaign be desired.

He states that this and other recent events are causing wide spread resentment in Najd and arc making things extremely diffjcult for Ibn Baud and himself end have given rise to complaints by Ibn Baud that we are not giving him our support, considers that serious consequences will ensue if such raids are allowed to take place and proposes that Selin should be warned that next occurrence of raid by Ajman or Shammar via Koweit territory will result in his deposition or other serious action, and should be called on to punish chief of Awazim. Political Agent comments on this that strong action by * ourselves is only satisfactory means of stopppng raiders and makes suggestions for location of mobile column of our troops at Koweit. I am unable to recommend either course. The raids complained of so far as it could have been prevented by ttye dhaikh of Koweit is the outcome of the unsatisfactory relations existing between him and Ibn Baud. That these relations have recently deteriorated is primarily due tc the decision not to send troops to Koweit to enforce the Blockade but to place the onus of enforcing on the Shaikh (vide my telegram^ May 7th 3977) Had troops been sent when first proposed ( G.O.C.Baghdad telegram 5777 Dec 6th) two platoons would have sufficed and subsequent trouble would in all probability have been averted. In ^present circumstances, I recomend that notnot less than half a battalion, and a squadron of cavalry be despatched to Koweit forthwith. I think tiki this may tend to stabilize situation there and indirectly in Central Arabia G. 0. C.in-Chief has seen the foregoing and desires me to say that assuming he is not called on tp provide the troops required he has no commenb to make thereon.

Following is my view of situation. As between Ting 'usnein and .?in Baud Xhurma affair i® a manifestation of ancient an tins thy between X r e c ca and tfhabi parties. Both principals ere pledged to us but former is actively fightingrks. Each desires force a favourable issue that will enable him to establish hie position against the other. Bin Baud's influence is largely based on Wahabism a sect which (more especially in disturbed times like present) can combine reactionary and hostile elements become unmanageable end dangerous. This potential menace is keenly felt by King Hussein, probably feels with our support ’in Saud and his sect mitfit dominate Arabian politics. I trust that it will be conceded that such a consummation of Arab movement would be unsatisfactory to Moslems generally and contrary to British interests and propaganda. On the other hand policy advocated from Cairo would be directed secure priority of King Hussein without pro. judice to territorial rights of Otter Arabian Chiefs. King Hu seein represents his action at hunua as ne cessary to vindicate hio impaired authority in east and di'cLnima any aggressive designs on Bin Baud. These assurances should I think be accented and his right to punish a rebellious shdikh (Khaled) originally appointed by him should be upheld. Hr. Philby’s ready acquiescence in Bin Saud' a assertion that King*» action is aggressive isie from my point of view most regrettable ind ill- advised. Mecca has defended for protection up till now on Ottoman (Egyptian or Turkish) military support* Wo have temporarily at any rate replaced Ottoman’s and should endeavour maintain and strengthen influence of our foremost protere and staunchest anti T urkir.h unit in Arabia. for retaining friendship of Bin Gaud who I understand represents strongest if not only Anglophil element in politic a of li&amp;jd. Wahal ism in leer, honest and capable hands than hi a mi ht be easily converted from a % potential into an active menace. I agree that Bin Saud should be treated liberally in the matter of funds public opinion referred to by hr. P: ilfcy!* But T would urge that other sinews of war should not be supplied by us unless absolutely nec so scry-and then in minimum quantities requisite - to retain his personal goodwill and authority. I suggest written communication to Bin Soud referred to in paragraph one of Baghdad tele -ram 6491 should be in following sense. with him an l desire prevent by ' j very means open to us aggression againhis territory orecise limits of which as implied in Article I cannot at present be known. That King Hussein has given us emphatic assurances that his action against rebel shAAkh Urnir Khaled of Khurma is local and is not directed against Bin Gaud and that he entertains no hostile designs against latter. At the same time I fully appreciate necessity a which may also exe rc ise^racifying influence on hostile If hia T/ajesty’s Government accept these vi&lt;ws That we hold to our treaty of December 1915 ThatV /• That Bin Saud is writing a friendly letter to Kin# and appears rront anxious for a reconciliation which’ r is Majesty’s Government feel would be to *rreat advantage to both parties and Arabs in general. That His Majesty’s Government are prepared to give their good offices t &gt; both parties on behalf of such a reconciliation and an nnieable adjustment e* - their outstanding difficulties; but they cannot but feel present time of war aod stress i r - unfavourable to a final and satisfactory settlement of complicated questions such as exact in - at i on of boundaries. That in the meantime all Arab leaders should combine against common enemy and should exercise patience and conciliation an |(iGe ev°ry endeavour to localize disputes in their dealings '*ith each other. As regards two and three T make no comments. T arree that auction by ^in ^^ud arainst ^in Hashid may provide a diversion and a oafer outlet for former's energies.
