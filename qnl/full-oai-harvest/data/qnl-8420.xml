The papers refer to a number of cross-border incidents, including murders and robbery committed in Persian territory, in which the perpetrators subsequently absconded into British Baluchistan. The papers include British protests to the Persian Government, in response to incursions by Persian levies into British territories, and correspondence exchanged between British officials, indicating a reluctance to sign an extradition treaty with Persia.The file’s principal correspondents include: the British Legation at Tehran (Robert Henry Clive; Reginald Hervey Hoare; Charles Dodd); representatives of the Persian Government, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mirza Mohamed Ali Khan Feroughi); the British Consul at Sistan and Kain [Ka’īn] (Major Clive Kirkpatrick Daly); the Governor General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan (Alexander Norman Ley Cater); the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (Evelyn Berkeley Howell).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Chief Commissioner</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Seistan and Kain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baluchistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Deportation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Homicide</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003d5#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003d5#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
