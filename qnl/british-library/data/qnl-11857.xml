This volume has no pretensions to completeness or finality of any kind. It has been compiled by Lieutenant Wilson* 32nd Sikh Pioneers, simply in order to focus our present knowledge of the Kuhgala country, and to draw attention to the necessity for further investigations by qualified officers. No inhabited tract of Persia is less known than this section of the Zagros, and its study is an object worthy of attention. As will be shown later on, it may be possible to find an alternative route from Ahwaz via Ramuz to Isfahan through the Kuhgalu country which may not be more, and perhaps less, difficult than the Lynch road. Such a tract would be a most valuable alternative, should the turn of events ia the Bakhtiari country make through traffic impossible, a contingency which must be reckoned with. A qualified officer would have no difficulty in seeing most of the Kuhgalu country, though he would have to be chary of open note-taking and of instrumental observations, as the Kuhgalu tribesmen are suspicious in the extreme of such doings in their country. The best time for travel in the Kuhgalu country is spring and ea^ly summer, when grass is abundant, and animals can graze. Grain and fodder are scarce in the Kuhgalu country. This district can be conveniently entered by three routes— (1) Behbehan-Deh Dasht. (2) Tang-i-Saulak. (3) Bars-Dlshmuk. The Maidaud-Talawar-Dlshmuk track offers formidable diffi culties, owing to tribal dissensions. The Kuhgalu tribes are split up into a number of mutually hostile factions which must be reckoned with when moving from valley to valley. There is, however, no reason to suppose that any serious obstacle would be encountered by a suitably qualified officer, who took care to travel as far as possible under the auspices of the various Khans. All officers to whom this book is issued are particularly request ed to bring immediately to the notice of this office any errors they may notice, and also to forward from time to time any additional authenticated information which may reach them. Army Head Quarters, ^ W. MALLESON, Colonel, Simla, l§th November 1909. ) A, Q. M. (?., Intelligence Branch.[CONFIDENTIAL] MILITARY REPORT ON S. W. PERSIA. VOL. IV. Geogkaphical. The information at present available regarding the geographi cal features of the Kuhgalu country is very scanty. We have nothing to go upon except a sketch report by Colonel Bell of a journey from Bars on the Karun to Behbehan via Khurra, and the observations of Lieutenant Wilson at Dishmuk on the Kuh-, galu-Bakhtiari boundary. —^ • Boundaries. On the north, the boundary of the Kuhgalu country is indefi nite : but it may be said that the head-waters of the Ab-i-A’ala, rising in the Mangasht mountains are in their hands, and that the country to within a few miles of the Karun near Bars is theirs. Their territory also extends to near Lurdagan—a district inhabited by a settled Bakhtiari population. To the east, we know nothing of the Kuhgalu-Qashgal boundary beyond the fact that Bell mentions Sisakht and Khurra as Kuh- galu territory. We may assume, then, that, at all events in 1888, the prominent Kuh-i-Dinar formed the Kuhgalu-Qashgai boundary. To the south, also we know nothing definite. Kaleh-i-Aru is in the hands of the Bair Ahmadi, Basht belongs to the Bawi, a tribe of 'Arab extraction who many years ago joined the Kuhgalu. South of Basht and Behbehan are various grom'-Kulrgalu tribes, classed by Baring in 1882 as Zir-i-Kuh Kuhgalu. They are Kuhgalu, however, only in name, like the Bakhtiari in the Ramuz district, and are omitted from all consideration in this report. 13 IB2 To the west, our knowledge is somewhat more exact, hut is complicated by the fact that certain sections of the Bahmai tribe, who are undoubtedly Kuhgalu by origin, have in recent years owned allegiance to the Bakhtiari, to whom they pay a light tri bute. Their territory must, however, be considered as Kuhgalu country though not within the administrative province of Bars, as is nominally the case with other administrative tribes. Kai Kaus, the site of Sassanian ruins, and of a fire temple in good pre servation, is just on the Kuhgalu side of the border, which runs north-west, nearly parallel to the Ramuz-Behbehan road, to a point 2 miles west of Pljan on the Ab-i-Bulfaiis. From this point it runs north-east, crossing the Dalun-Bulfaris road midway between Patek and Bulfarfs, and Kuh-i-Bengistun and Tanbulun to a point midway between Talawar and Kaleh-i-A’ala. The former is a Bakhtiari village, the latter the head-quarters of a section of the Bahmai, tributary to the Bakhtiari, under Muham mad Husain Khan, Bahmai, who must be distinguished from the Chehar Lang chief of the same name who lives at Munganun. North of Talawar, a small tract of land, known Ss* 7 diAUj extending to Shah-i-M&amp;ngaslit, is in the hands of another section of Bahmai, under Zaqi Khan, also tributary to the Bakhtiari. The south slopes of the Mangasht, for the most part, and all the east slopes, are in the hands of Bahmai who pay no tribute to the Bakhtiari, but own allegiance to Muhammad Husain Khan of Kaleh-i-A’ala, or to 5 All Murad Khan of Dishmuk. River System. The Kuhgalu eountry is drained by two great rivers, the Kanin and the Jarrahl, and by both the main branches of the latter, viz., the Ab-i-A’ala and the Ab-i-Marun. The principal Kuhgalu tribu taries of the Karun are the Ab-i-Bars and the Darla-i-Gandum. The Ab-i-A’ala rises on the east slopes of Mangasht, and drains the eountry to within a few miles of Dishmuk, falling even tually into the Rud-i-Zard, of which it forms the greater part. The basin of the Ab-i-Behbehan, or the Ab-i-Marun, is apparently entirely Kuhgalu country. Dishmuk (6,5000 is near the head of each of these systems :the Dishmuk Valley itself drains south to Behbehan. Two miles to the east the country drains into the Ab-i-A’ala, and a few miles to the north, into the Ab-i-Bars* All these streams are snow-fed, and sweet. The mountains run north-north-west and south-south-east, as elsewhere, but the rivers cut through them forcibly, and, generally speaking, have a north-east and south-west trend.3 D Mountain System. .. . i •, Ji. From Malamlr soutli-south-east, to Behbehan extends a lofty, thouglr not continuous, range of limestone Fills from 9,000' to 10 , 000 ' in elevation, which contrast sharply with the low sandstone and gypsum hills of the Bakhtiari Garmsir. They form a solid barrier between the Bakhtiari and the Kuhgalu territories, and are the cause of the backward state of the Kuhgalu as compared with their neighbours. East of this barrier, extends an elevated plateau, at the head of which lies the Dishmuk Valley : the plateau is broken by hills, prominent amongst which are the gaunt limestone saddle backs of Kuh-i-Barf-i-Kun, and Kuh-i-Nil. The latter is probably not less than 10,000' high, and its summit is over 4,000' above the general level of the vicinity. Political. The Kuhgalu country is in the hands of a number of tribes, none of them individually powerful, and separated from each other by ancient feuds which have lost none of their pristine bit terness. There is no authoritative list of these sub-divisions available, but that quoted below, largely based on data obtain3d by Captain Lorimer in 1908, may be accepted as embodying most reliable information yet to hand. Baring in 1882 divided the Kuhgalu into two sections, Pusht- i-*Kuh, and Zic-i-Kiih; in the latter section he included tribes known as Yusuff, Agha Jarl, Humai, Zaidun, Slrawi (probably a mistake for Lirawl) and Bandar Dilam. These tribes are now sedentary and fairly peaceful, and can scarcely be classed any longer as Kuhgalu. They are not dealt with in this report. The name Kuhgalu is now used only for the Pusht- i-Kuh section, which consists of five principal divisions, viz., Bair Ahmad I, TaibI, Dushmanzlarl, Bahmai, and Bawl, with a total of about 10,000 fighting men and perhaps 15,000 families. The principal intertribal feuds are as follows Bair Ahmadl versus Dushmanzlarl. Bahmai versus TaibI (part only). Bahmai of ZaqI Khan *) Bahmai of Muhammad ^ versus Bahmai of 'AH Murad Husain Khan ) Khan.4 Revenue. The Kuhgalu are said to pay their revenue to the Governor of Behbehan, but how much and how often is not known : whatever is ’ aid, is so light as to be paid without difficulty. Indeed, were it other wise,' they would refuse to pay, strong in the assurances that their hills' give them, and in the well-founded belief that a Governor would find the game of coercion unprofitable. Yet the Kuhgalu feel themselve; to be weak, as indeed they are, tribal dissensions making it impossible for them to present a bold front to an enemy. Some of the Bahmai have in consequence made a show of submitting to the Bakhtiari, but the bitterness between the rank and file of the Bakhtiari and Kuhgalu tribes is still great, and not likely to diminish. The predatory _ tendencies _ of the latter at the expense of the former culminated in an expedition by the Bakhtiari against the Bahmai of ’All Murad Khan in February 1908. A force of about 3,000 men, after a long delay at Dalun and Sarileh advanced up the Tang-i-Chewll to Dishmuk. But they effected nothing, beyond killing a few Saiyids, and burning their huts. The fort of Dishmuk itself was too strong for them to storm, and they were compelled to withdraw. The tribe principally concerned in the highway robberies and murders of Bakhtiari on the Lynch road is by universal consent the TaibI, but it is asserted that their operations would be impossible without the assistance, or at all events the permission, of ’Ali Murad Khan of Dishmuk, whose land must be crossed by them on their raiding expeditions. ’Ali Murad Khan was therefore fastened upon as being morally responsible, and as being a man of substance, the Taibi on the other hand being nomads with no immovable property: he protested his entire innocence, however, to Lieutenant Wilson in 1908, but qua lified his asseverations by the announcement that if the guarding of the Bakhtiari road was entrusted to him, his influence with the Taibi was such as to enable him to put an end to raiding at once. Relations with British Government. Circumstances have hitherto prevented His Britannic Majesty ’ 8 Consul from opening up direct relations with any of the Kuhgalu Chiefs, though it is admittedly desirable that this should be done. ? Captain Lorimer in 1907 met Husain Khan, Bahmai, brother of ’Ali Naqi, and received a cordial invitation to visit the Kuhgalu country. This fact, added to the favourable reception by Ali5 Murad Khan of Dlshmuk of Lieutenant Wilson, and information received regarding the favourable attitude of the Bair AhmadT, indicate that the principal Kuhgalu chiefs are anxious to open no friendly relations with the British. That it ic desirable from our point of view that .such should exist is ^disputable. Tne existence Q-j i mR ort?nt British interests, in the shape of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s works, at Mama tain, close to the Ivuligal.1 border, is in itself a sufficient justification, for the population of Mamatain consists mainly of Kala Kaj Kuhgaiii (Bahmai). We must not put all our eggs into one basket by cultivating the friendship of the Bakhtiari to the neglect of the Kuhgalu, whose virile qualities will sooner or later ensure them a position and a hearing in the settlement of local problems. Should the Kuhgalu wish to annoy the Bakhtiari, they could easily seize Mamatain, and could not readily be turned out, though their numbers, only one-fifth of the Bakhtiari, make it unlikely that they could offer a prolonged resistance. There is also the possibility of an alternative route to Isfahan through the Kuhgalu country, via Ramuz, Dishmuk perhaps, Lur- dagan and Ganduman. Such a road would be 25 per cent, shorter than the Lynch road, and the fact that its existence and practica- bility was known to us would be a valuable asset to us in dealing with the Bakhtiari Khans, should difficulties arise regarding the road. The crossing of the Kariin would be avoided, and, as it appears that no streams not easily fordable are met with, the con struction of expensive bridges would be unnecessary. Genealogy.

The Kuhgalu country is inhabited by probably not more than 10,000 families, the majority of whom are pastoral rely ing upon acorns, rather than corn, for their daily bread. There is no export of grain, as far as can be ascertained, and each valley grows sufficient for its needs. Yet the country is well-watered and fertile, and could support a population 20 times as^ great as it does at present. It is well wooded, mainly with ballut (dwarf- oak), but there are many other tfees, such as walnut, apricot, jujube, fig, etc., whose fruit, together -with the acorn, is a staple food for the tribesmen. Sulphur for local use is obtained at several places, Tang-i-Shibr, off the Tang-i-Chewil, and from numerous sulphur springs. The principal exports, however, seem to be ghi, wool and country cloth, and rope of goat-hair, and skins, also walnuts. In8 return, felt, cotton cloth and iron goods, tea, sugar,, etc., are purchased at Ramuz or Behbehan. The Bahmai deal mainly with Ramuz. This traffic, such as it is, is carried on, not by the tribesmen themselves, but by agents, whose general usefulness ensures the safety of their caravans wher ever they may go. Such men form the necessary link between the various hostile tribes, and the external markets. There are no tracks in common use by large caravans across the Ruhgalu country. The only routes that have yet been traversed by Europeans are described in the Route Reports below. This absence of routes is, however, probably due rather to the inhospitable nature of the people than to the difficulty of the ground. From Ahwaz to Isfahan a straight line via Ramuz and Ganduman is 218 miles against 275 by the Lynch road, a saving of nearly 25 per cent. A track exists via Tang-i-Chewil and Dishmuk which is almost exactly on this straight line, and which could be easily improved sufficiently to make it, at all events, better than many parts of the Lynch road. Tribal feuds, however, prevent this road being used for the present, and Dishmuk must be reached either via Tang-i-Saulak or via Bars. From Dishmuk to Lurdagan a reasonably good track is said to exist, via Bard-i-Kirm, and from Lurdagan to Isfahan the road is known to be good. DeBode (1845) mentions an ancient paved way leading up the Tang-i-Saulak to Isfahan, and saw Parthian sculptures on rocks at the same place. This might well have been an ancient route between Behbehan and Isfahan. Supplies. Little grain is grown in the district, the crops only sufficing for the normal needs of the population. The surplus for sale is thus small, and large caravans would have difficulty in obtaining supplies: a re serve, at all events for horses, of several days’ grain should therefore be carried. For mules, the excellent grazing available will serve as a substitute for grain for the brief periods when none can be obtained. Communications9 Transport. There are few horses, mules, or donkeys, in the district. The people are not really migratory, and do not need them. Their winter quarters are in the valleys i their summer camps in the hills, 6 miles or so off. Mule-breeding does not seem to be practised, though these animals are frequently stolen from the Bakhtiari road. Bullocks are commonly in use for local transport, but even these only suffice for actual requirements. Climate. Similar to the Bakhtiari hills, but milder. The little valley of Dlshmuk (b^OCK) is said to be under snow for several months in winter, but the flimsy dwellings of the inhabitants, who live there all the year round, indicate that the cold is not severe far long. Military Capacities op Inhabitants. The Kuhgalu is as distinct as the Sagwand from the Bakhtiari, though it is hard to define his distinguishing features. He is more roughly dressed, often without shoes, less well armed, more uncouth, more savage than the Bakhtiari. He is generally of smaller build, less good looking, less striking in appearance, but more daring, more suspicious, and more thievish. The Lur dialect is his only language, and few Kuhgalu can understand ordinary Persian. Probably only one man in three has a serviceable rifle, and grown men carry a little sling, wherewith to slay birds and other small animals. In general characteristics, they resemble the Bakhtiari, but they are noticeably less affected by Persian manners and customs. They seem to have been entirely unaffected by the disturbances of 1909, which culminated in the deposition of the Shah. They did not raid the roads, nor cause any trouble, except perhaps near Shiraz in conjunction with the Qashgai. 13 IB13 &gt;V i Route No. 1. Ardal to Behbehan via the Kuhgalu Country.

Over undulating open ground, and then through a. very narrow ravine to the Maidan-i-Gandnman, a fine grassy plain about 6 miles wide. At the 17th mile ford a stream 20'wide flowing out of the Tang-i-Vastagun, a narrow gorge on the right. Mardjigan is a small Lur village. 3 ’Ail or Khaneh Mirza. 6,300'. 26 70 General direction south. The road gradu ally ascends by a somewhat steep and stony tract to 8,520' above sea. It then descends and enters a narrow ravine about 30' wide. After a mile or two of this, ascend up the right side of the ravine ; then descend into the side pasture-land of the Chashmeh Sain -All. Water plentiful. A mile beyond descend by a steep incline to the Gird-i-Bishir valley, down which is a good path on the left bank of the stream which waters it, and over 150 feet above it. The valley is about a mile wide. Cross a ridge by a steep path to avoid the Tang-i-Dusabil, the gorge through which the stream flows, and cross a stream which joins the former one by a bridge 220 feet long and 12 feet wide, known as the Pul-i-Kharabast (?) sic. (eleva tion 5,900 feet). The path now ascends in a westerly direction ; the road is a good one, 12 feet wide, but very steep in places. The hills become steep and rocky; the valley, narrow and deep. At 23 miles descend into a valley and march up it ; then over a saddle and into a basin 15 miles long. The descent is short, but steep and rocky; the pasture here is poor, as also the village of ’Ali. From ’All there is a tolerably easy road to Shushtar through Lurdagan. 4&lt; Basaki .. f 24 f 94 f General direction south-south-east. Ascend gently, passing the villages of Mulla and Afghan on the right. At 7 miles cross the Gardan-i-Darman 1 (7,056 feet). The neck is 400 yards wide and grassy. Descend gently, passing Falat, 2 miles distant, to the right. Leave the valley at 12 miles and ascend the hills on east by a large steep incline, summit 7,900 feet; then over an undulating, well watered country into a grassy valley, 1 mile wide. At 19 miles ascend a deep and stony ravine, traverse a grassy plateau and descend to ant encamping-ground below the Kuh-i-Basaki (7,850 feet).

From here there is a direct road to Isfahan via Nakneh, Takun, and Qumisheh, which is said to be good. Also one via Simariin. In either case three stages to Qumisheh. General direction south. Descend a grassy valley leading to the Kuh-i-Dlnar. At 8 or 9 miles pass village of Rudabad ; 2 miles beyond ford a small stream ; and then the Malbur river, 150 feet wide and 3 feet deep, very dangerous ford. Up a ravine to Sivar, At 16 miles reach the cultivated plateau and village of Numdagun. Soon after com mence the ascent; the summit 8,400 feet is reached at 22 miles. Descend to Kina. 6 Sisakht .. 24 142 General direction south. Descend the ’Kina valley for 1J miles and enter the Tang-i- Khafr, a narrow steep and stony ravine. Khafr is a small village at 1 the head of a deep valley under the Kuh-i-Dlnar.' A good mule road leads from here to Shiraz. From here there is a direct foot-path over the Gardan-i-Shinakh to Sisakht; but mules must follow that described below, which winds gradually up the hill side, which is shaly. The steepest part is just below the Gardan-i-Buzurg, the highest point on the road over the Kuh-i-Dinar, 10,880 feet. The descent is steep and stony along the right side of a ravine. Sisakht is a reed village belonging to the Kuhgalu. General direction slightly north of west. Down the well-wooded Tang-i-Khakalun parallel to the Dina hill; then over an undulating pasture valley, 1 mile broad. At 7 miles reach Nurah ; then descend to the Ab-i-Daruhun (5,870 feet). Ford where the river runs in three channels. Up stream and ford another branch 200 feet 'wide. These two arms form the Ab-i-Kharum. At 13 jmiles small 'village of Alibaz. Then over hill and dale, the under-features of the :Kuh-i-Dlnar, for about 10 miles, j|when enter the undulating valley which leads to Khurra. The whole of this day’s march may be con sidered easy. Khurra is a Kuhgalu encampment. Sisakht 24 142 7,900'. Khurra 25 167 7,890'. 8 Sadat 7,200'. 18 185 General direction south-west.

Then up the Tang-i-Bandarab by a steep path and into the cultivated valley of Dast-i-Rakht. At 13 miles commence the ascent of the Gardan-i- Chashmeh Duzar, the summit of which is 9,570 feet. Descend the other side by a very steep and slippery path. Sadat is a half-ruined village in a fertile, and well-watered valley. 9 Safar-i-Ab 4,120'. 22 207 General direction west. Over hill and dale to the Gardan-i-Mulla (8,350 feet), the descent from which is steep and difficult. The path now(wz., at 10 miles) runs up the Dalbe- rangh hill, descends a narrow ravine,' and crosses a neck (5,970 feet). Some attempts^ road making have been made about here, but the most difficult places have been left untouched. Descend into the Tang-i-Nali by a rocky staircase almost impassable for even mules. Descend the Tang-i-Nali. This gorge is narrow and deep, its bed covered with huge boulders, and the track is very difficult. Reach at 22 miles the cultivated valley of Safar-i-Ab with its small village. This is a difficult stage. 10 Deh Dasht 2,850'. 23 230 General direction slightly south of west. By gentle gradients into and'along the valley. At 6 miles cross a shallow stream; pass a . _ _ cemetery, and over stony hill sides to the Tang-i-Nakhuda (God-forsaken ravine). It is about 70 yards wide, with precipitous cliffs 300 feet high. Its bed is strewn with boulders. The path crosses the stream down it a dozen times. After 4 or 5 miles emerge from the pass, and traverse a comparatively open country and ascend the Kaleh Pill valley, passing several masonry ruins. Kaleh Pill15 Route No. 1 — tondd, is a small masonry fort. Over a grassy plain to Imamzadeh Dastgird, a small mined town, and at 23 miles reach Deh Dasht, a mined town of some size. 11 Ab-i-Marun 1,400'. 20 250 General direction south-west. Descend the gently sloping plain by a fair but narrow path, over swampy ground in places. At 8 miles the country becomes rocky and hilly, the road bad, especially at the Gach Darwazeh, a rocky staircase. Slippery ascents and descents all the way to the Marun river, which is here about 70 yards wide with a swift current. Banks low and well wooded. Good pasture. 12 Behbehan 1,300'. 15 265 At its southern end is a fountain. General direction south-west.

The road rocky. becomes broad and good. At 11 miles pass village Mansuarah. From here to Bandar Dilam is 48 miles in two stages ; and thence to Bushire is 124 miles in six stages. Route No. 2. Maidaud to DIshmuk via Kaleh-i-A’ala and Tang-i-ChewIl. Authority and date. —Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, October 1908. Epitome. GeneraJ.—The main road to Dishmuk and the Kuhgalu country from Ramuz and Shiishtar, but now little used as the Bahmai subjects of the Bakhtiari Khans, tributary to Kaleh-i-A’ala, are hostile to the Bahmai subjects of ’All Murad Khan of Kaleh-i-Dlsh- muk, and wild and lawless, little under the control even of their own chief. It is difficult in places, and, unless both sides of the Tang-i-ChewU were held, a small force could anni hilate an army which was marching up the Tang. Passable all the year round, though near Dishmuk 2' of snow is often encountered from December to March. The road is difficult in places in the Tang-i-ChewIl, and heavily laden mules will give trouble, and horses could scarcely proceed in places. After Tang-i-Chewil the road is steep, but offers no special difficulties. Special obstacles. —Snow (vide supra) and Tang-i-Chewil. Alternative stages. —Talawar; a Bakhtiari Chehar Lang village: Rusmeh; at the upper end of Tang-i-Chewil. Inhabited from March to November; no supplies. Alternative Routes .—No. 3 via Shah-i-Mangasht. Safety. —The route is not safe for an outsider unless his caravan is guarded by 20 or 30 armed men, not belonging to the district, and unless he is provided with a safe conduct from the occupant of Kaleh-i-A’ala. Both are necessary ; the latter is insufficient without the former. The boundary of the Bakhtiari territory to Kaleh-i-A’ala runs north to south 1^ miles from Dlshmuk along the watershed, and a safe-conduct from Kaleh-i- A’ala is good only up to this point.

At Sf miles cross river opposite village Madabad and continue north-west along left bank crossing at 4J miles, and again at 6 miles. At 6} miles ascend gach hills and continue to Sahra-i-Murd, a small pasture on top of the gach, reached at 8 miles. Fresh water all the year round. At 9J miles descend from gach, passing ruined village Tazing. At 13 miles cross Ab-i-A’ala and continue along left bank to village Talawar (4Q houses) reached 13J miles. Supplies obtainable in small quantities. Fuel scarce. Graz ing poor. At 14 miles cross Ab-i-Saiyidun. At 14 miles cross Ab-i-A’ala and continue over rich rice lands sloping gently to Kaleh-i-A ala, reached at 16§- miles. The fort stands on a ridge 50' high, surrounded on three sides by low-lying rice fields, and con nected on the east by a neck of land to higher hills which command the fort at a range of 1,000 yards. The fort was originally re-built in 1860 by Jafar Qull Khan, Bahmai, and thoroughly repaired in 1904. It has resisted bombardment by Behb chan artillery. There is a well within the fort. Sole entrance faces north. Fort is built of stone, and lime mortar, walls 25 feet high, and size of fort about 35 yards by 25 yards. Water from river half mile north. Grazing poor ; fuel from hills near by. Supplies scarce. A road diverges hence across Kuh-i-Girdistun and Mangasht to Pul-i-Shalu and Deh-Diz. DishmuK .. [ 25 411 f General direction east-south-east. Leaving. Kaleh-i-A’ala proceed east over stony ground to left bank of river, crossed at 1 mile. Continue along right bank to 5 miles where the Tang-i-Chewil begins, the track ascending steadily over rock, ridges and stones. The Tang gradually deepens, and eventually at 7 miles attains a depth of about 1,500'. (Another track passable in dry weather keeps to river-bed all the way.) At 8 miles, the track descends to river level to a pasture with a few acres oi cultivated land. At this point Tang-i-Shibr joins the Tang-i-Chewil from the north. Tang-i-Shibr contains sulphur deposits which are regularly exploited for local use and to some extent for exportation. At 8|- miles a ravine coming from south joins the main Tang. Continue along right bed at bottom of Tang, which gradually narro s to about 550 yards, at the ame time di Jn shing in hei 0 ht. The track which follows the river is completely dominated by the cliffs above. ' At 13 miles the Tang turns north through an impassable cleft in Kuh-i-DilL known as Tang-i-Rusmek. (See stage 2, Route No. 3.) The district of Rrsmeh is now entered; no supplies; no permanent huts, only tents-. The track continues at the foot of Kuh-i-DiiJi amongst steep wooded foot-hills. At 21 miles, reach Sar-i-Chashmeh, a small spring (6,500'). At 23 miles, reach the water shed (700 ) between the Ab-i-A’ali and Ab-i-Behbehan systems. Descend steeply to Dlshmuk, reached at 24 miles. The fort stands on a ridge 60' high, in the south-west corner of a. small plain of less than a mile in radius, with several springs, but little irrigation culti vation. Fifty huts on sides of ridge on which fort stands. Supplies obtainable, but barley scarce. The fort was built by Qalll Khan, 1830, and is well-constructed. The only entrance is on east side. Water from a spring at bottom of ridge on east side reached y a subterranean passage from east entrance. Also from numerous springs near by.

Passable in winter though 2 or 3 feet of snow are met with between ■December and March near the summit of Milla-i-Amiri, and near Dlshmak. Not passable for other than Persian horses, and dangerous for mules unless very lightly laden. f ’ The road is difficult practically all the way ; steep, stony, narrow, overhung by rocks, impeded by trees, and passing over unstable screes of dffiris.
