Bankura on April l4th« immediately after landing and unloading of the two motor cars they had with them the party proceeded to the American Mission at Matrah were they were accommodated. Pastori, whose passport held a visa for muscat in tran sit to Iran issued at Aden and in which he is described as a 'geologist, announced that the object of his visit to this country was to recruit labourers for Eritrea. This information j was reported to the Buitan and by his orders pastori was not allowed to proceed with his project or leave for the interior of the country. He came to this Agency and asked for a visa for pasni whence he stated he would travel overland by car into Iran. The following day he said he had changed his mind and would go direct to Bandar Abbas by sea. Be left for that port by s.s. Baroda on 21st April. ne left his car with a merchant in Matrah and announced his intention of picking it up on his return from the Gulf. The British Consul at Bandar Abbas reports that Pastori disembarked there on 25th April and his passport bore a visa for Iran issued by the Iranian Consul at Karachi. As no trace could be found of any such visa on the passport he produced at this Agency it is possible that Pastori is using two passport S. Count de prorok who it appears has only recently become a naturalised American subject and is of mixed Polish and Hungarian/€&gt;.@5 Hungarian origin announced that he represented an American |\ Archaeological Society and had come to make a preliminary :9to*I reconnaissance of muscat and Oman with a view to obtaining a concession for the systematic exploration of the whole .8 country. Assisted by Dr Harrison of the American mission t^x/e whose guest he was (Jount prorok made several attempts to obtain JB lo an interview with the Sultan but'nis Highness who was thoroughly IQ** incensed at no previous permission having been asked for or A no even a reference being made to him beforehand by the expedition Oj'OCX refused to see him or allow him to proceed anywhere into that part of the interior under his control i«e. the Hatinah and EisxM near neighbourhood of muscat and matrah. After spending a $ xe fortnight in vain attempts to make the Sultan change his mind Count de prorok and his wife left in disgust on April 29th Cos^ by s.s. Bankura for Bahrain where they stated they intended to iUOO make a short stay en route to xraq. e^w Count de prorok gave the impression that he was a &gt;IIjb genuine archaeologist but there are grounds for believing “io that his real object is not connected with that pursuit. ‘XO'i Soon after his arrival he began to make inquiries about ob- BTl taining a guide for the interior and gave out that he was iiOVV prepared to pay some Ha 2000/ for a suitable man. He also y;cf mentioned that he was prepared to give £ 3-4000 as a present nx to the Sultan in return for being allowed to move about the country freely and pursue his archaeological investigations. It seems probable that the Count’s real object in atb xol visiting Muscat is in connection with certain Italian oil interests and this belief is supported by a telegram received JOO from the Aden Government on 21st April in which they stated that JjB Prorok and Pastori’s activities while in Aden had given rise * 5 to the same suspicion. i es&amp;nwH jxioxA. ioo&amp;i ?00 JS ilJJOO i a oriw 'i hjb :eoni nava ulai iiol nuoO e Mcf a&gt;{£tn aooS ulai q&amp;iq J asm J ol ^uoo 1-U P.Z.3347/1937.

Dear Mr. Lewisohn, I told you some little time ago that we might want to suggest certain verbal amendments in the common form of the political agreements to be made between His Majesty’s Government and the company in respect of any future oil concessions in the Persian Gulf. You also, I think, said that the company might want to suggest certain small amendments. I have now looked into this matter and enclose a draft which, as you will see, differs in certain small particulars from the text of the Debai political agreement. It has not yet been approved officially here, and I will not do any more about it until you let me know whether you see any objection to these amendments and whether you have any others to add. It would, of course, be the ideal thing, if possible, to get the text settled in time for it to be used in respect of the. next oil concession which may be obtained after the Debai concession. But 1 believe it is quite possible that certain of the other Trucial Sheikhs will be ready to give your Company concessions directly the Debai concession is agreed, and in exactly the same terms. If this is so it would obviously be undesirable, and there would probably not be time, to alter the Debai text for these Sheikhs, but the revised text v/oua.d be available for use as and when it is possible, to introduce it.

In this connexion I am to enclose a copy of a letter of the 11th January, 1934 from the President of the Royal Anthropological Institute together with a copy of the reply thereto of the 18th January, 1934. The expedition achieved little of scientific value and from information furnished by His Majesty’s Minister at Addis Ababa and from other sources it appears that de Prorok is discredited in scientific circles and should be treated with all reserve. 3.

Roosevelt Road and Lake Michigan, HP: JJH. Chicago. February 21 ? 1935. My dear Sir Percy: I see by an International News Service press dispatch dated February 20th that Count Byron de Prorok is now on his way to search for the 'long lost capital of the Queen of Sheba' somev/here to the East of Sana. As you know this is one of the most important archaeological problems of the Near East and one which deserves the most careful and delicate handling In view of the local political situation. According to this dispatch 'members of the Trocadero Museum of Paris, which is sponsering the expedition, will accompany de Prorok'. I have written to Dr.P.Rivet at the Trocadero as I am confident that this is inaccurate in view of his bad reputation on French soil. You will no doubt recall that the 'Count' has posed as a Fellow of the Royal Geographic Society and that his last expedition was said to be sponsered by the Royal Italian Geographical Society which was earnestly denied by their President. I am sure you will agree with me that everything should be done to prevent this charlatan from doing any damage which will prejudice the local governments against further scientific exploration or archaeological investigation and I should be very glad if you would investigate the matter and request the Foreign Office and Air Ministry to act as they see fit in this matter. I am perfectly prepared to have you quote me in confidence to the Foreign Office or to the Air Ministry, but I naturally rely on you to treat this letter in confidence. pcy cox With all good wishes, feiflent * Yours sincerely, Geographical Society, (3d.)

Sir, The Eft-yptian Gazette of (about) December 14th, 1933, contained an article describing 'one of the largest scientific expeditions of recent years'. The party is said to be under the leadership of Count Byron de Prorok, P. R.G. S., and 'under the auspices of the International Anthropological Institutes of the British, French, Italian, Egyptian and Ethiopian Governments.' Among other things, the expedition intends 'to search for the body of Alexander the Great and King Solomon’s Mines, and will also seek proof of the Atlantean theory of the origin of man.' I should like to say that the soi-disant Count Prorok has no connection whatsoever with this Institute. His expedition has received no support from us. We are informed by French Anthropologists that Count Prorok is not a Count and that his name is Cohn, not Prorok. We are of opinion that the Sudan Government should be advised to keep a close watch on this man's movements and that he should be prevented from excavating and collecting surface material. The article in The Egyptian Gazette states that the expedition will proceed from the Sudan into Abyssinia to investigate 'the strange Dolmens', and suggests that iJle Secretary of State it/ for Foreign Affairs.2 . it will observe the slave trade which 'rumour insists' is still in existence. It is added that in nearby Somaliland the expedition will have an opportunity also of observing the effects of 'the hashish trade, also said to flourish through secret channels.' It is not for me to comment upon some of these statements, but I should like to be permitted to say that as a scientific Institute we view with grave concern the harm that may be done in Abyssinia by incompetent handling of the megaliths. We venture to hope that it may be possible to inform the Abyssinian Government, through the British Minister, that this expedition is not, in any way, connected with this Institute.

Sir, With reference to your letter of the 11th instant, regarding the scientific expedition of Mr. B. de Prorok to Egypt, the Sudan and Abyssinia, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to inform you that copies of the article in the “Egyptian Gazette' had already been sent to ills Majesty’s High Commissioner at Cairo and to His Majesty’s Minister at Addis Ababa. 2. The former has since been instructed by telegraph to notify the Government of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan of the facts as disclosed in your letter under reply, and to suggest to them the desirability of keeping a close watch on the expedition’s activities. His Majesty’s Minister at Addis Ababa was also informed of the facts by telegraph and instructed to inform the Ethiopian Government uiiofficially that Mr. de Prorok has no connexion with either the Royal Geographical Society or the Royal Anthropological Institute. 3. I am to add that Sir Miles Lampson has since reported that the Sudan authorities have been fully apprised of Mr, de Prorok’s lack of qualifications as an archaeologist. I am 9 6 t.c• y Sgd. S.

A^ed 39, born Mexico, Described on his notepaper as Editor of the monthly review, 'ETHIOPIA”. During the Italo-Abyssinian War, Count de PROROK was suspected of being concerned in gun-running activities in the Red dea. Secret information received about that time suggested that the French suspected de PROROK of being an Italian agent and that the Italians suspected him of being a British agent. On 9.2.37 a certain Colonel N. KORDASHEVSKI of Jerusalem was in touch with the Count, who was then at 32, Sharia Antikhana Cairo, regarding a proposed trip to discover a hidden city in Arabia, apparently Sheba. According to available information from Palestine, this K0RDASH2VSKI claims to have participated in a number of adventurous expeditions, including the ROERICH expedition to Tibet in 1927/28. The India General Staff Summary of Intelligence for the week ending 29. 5. 28 shows that a Colonel KQRDASHEVSKI did in fact accompany the Roerich Expedition. He carried letters from General Knox to the effect that his sympathies were pro-British, De Prorok and his wife left for Karachi by the s.s. 'Volpi' on 3.4.37, the latter stating that she was proceeding to the Deccan. They were accompanied by Tullio PASTORI and took with them a car and a Dodge truck with a body specially adapted for desert work. Prior to their departure from Aden, de Prorok and Pastori confided to a reliable source that it was their intention to meet friends at Muscat and to make arrangements to penetrate Rub 1 al Khaliin the autumn, where they intended to search for traces of an ancient civilization. As regards Tullio PASTORI, he is an Italian trader of about 50 years of age, who has spent the last 20 years ”living rough' in Eritrea, Abyssinia and the Sudan. He at one time became bankrupt in Eritrea and got into disfavour v/ith the Italian authorities 7/ho refused him an Italian passport and re-adminsion into Eritrea. On another occasion, however, he crossed the Sudan border and visited Tessenei, where he was entertained by Italian officers. More recently, whilst in Aden, he v/as apparently refused permission to visit Addis Ababa. During their stay (from 8.4.37 to 11.4.37) in Karachi, the de Proroks and Pastori did not come to unfavourable notice. They gave out that they were archaeologists. Their passport particulars 7/ere as follows: Count Byron Khun de PPQROK : American passport No. 535, issued in Paris, 11.9.36., visa No* 274 issued Aden 3.4.37. 1/Vlle: British passport C/31921, issued Paris, 20.11.36., valid for B.

The Sultan has insisted on certain alterations, chiefly deletions being made in the draft concessions and some additional articles being incorporated. The alterations together with the necessary insertions are given in the following paragraphs and the additional articles in the attached schedule. 4.

The words deleted were objected to by the Sultan. i/ Item (12). The words were in the Arabic text but had been omitted evidently through an oversight from the English version. Item (13). London was objected to by the Sultan as being too far away. 7 . The additions and amendments to the articles for incorporation in the Draft of the Concession as mentioned in my paragraph 3 above are given in the attached schedules 5 marked 'A' and 'B' respectively. The only item which calls for comment is No.4 of 'A'. The Sultan declared that now he had got into personal touch with Petroleum Concessions Ltd through their Representative Mr. Lermitte, he did not wish that they should transfer their rights to any other Company. His objection was overcome by adding the words 'direct subsidiary* in front of the word 'Company' in line 6 of Article 23.m - 5 - 8 . ita)fe| (4). Reference my remarks in paragraph 6 regarding In view of Article 17 of the Concession I presume there will not he any objection to the deletion^ of the words in question. I see no mention any where in the Draft Con cession of the Sultan undertaking responsibility for the safety of the personnel of the Company when working in his territory. As the Draft Concession has I understand been generally approved of by His Majesty f s Government the inclu sion of Article 17 is no doubt considered to satisfy the requirements of this question. Article 15 of the Dubai Oil Concession which has been finally, I wpgnfrgTreiisnffy believe, approved of by His Majesty 1 s Government. ment has yet been made by Mr. Lermitte to the Sultan.

Finsbury Square, London, S.C.2. D._0. 11th June, 1937. Lear Mr. Walton, As agreed between us yesterday afternoon, the 10th instant, I am sending you a short note containing such information as vve have on conditions in the hinterland south and south-east of the Trucial Coast. It would appear from this that certain areas which might possibly contain conditions favourable for oil are outside the effective control of the Trucial Coast rulers, with whom we are already in touch and from whom we hope to obtain concessions. The question which therefore arises - that is, with whom we ought to deal in such cases, and with whom you are willing that we should deal - is one which we cannot long delay facing, and this for two reasons: firstly, the extent of their effectively controlled hinterland eventually affects the value of concessions which the Trucial shaikhs may grant us: and secondly, our field programme in that area for next cold weather must depend upon the extent to which we can hope for access to the inlying ares. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) Stephen H. Gouring. SncI. J.C.Walton, Esq., C.B., M.C., India Office, Whitehall, S.' .1. P.S. I am sending a copy of this letter and note to Mr. Rendel of the Foreign Office., 364^/37. RO!R OK COKBITIONS IK THE HINT 'ELAND SOUTH AND SOUTH-EAST OP THE TRUCIAL COAST. r P.C.L. Geologists who worked on the Trucial Coast, generally based on Dubai, during the cold weather of 1936/37, report that not the least interesting area is likely to lie immediately to the west of the Oman mountain range, running south-east to north-west and south to north. The area concerned thus includes presumably the inlying portions of the territory under the real or nominal control of the Trucial Coast rulers. The Company is, however, without information as to the distance inland covered by the effective authority of these rulers, as well as their boundaries inter se and the extent to which nomadic or shepherd tribes in the interior are to be regarded as their subjects. In respect of the area under particular reference - that is, the crescent west of the Oman ranges - there appear to be other possible claimants to power. These are, firstly, the Sultan of Muscat and Oman himself, doubtful as it may be how far his authority extends westwards of the mountains: secondly, the Imam of Oman (understood to be in some sort of relations with Ibn Baud) whose status appears to be quite independent of the Sultan of Muscat: thirdly, the inlying tribes themselves, and in particular the Beni Chittib (who seem to control the Jebel Faiyah area, and to owe no real allegiance to the Shaikh of Sharjah, who claims them), the Beni Cha'ab (possibly controlled to some extent by Ras-al- Khaimsli) , the Na'um (who occupy Baraimi and Jebel al Aouha), the Abu Shems (occupying Jebel Hafit and part of the Baraimi Oa.sis). The Company’s position is that it is anxious to send its Geologists to explore this country and, in fact, as much ofthe Truciel and Oman hinterland as possible. The Company’s Geologists believe that there are no insuperable physical difficulties in the way of such exploration, which they would probably be able to carry out with the help of good guides and perhaps fairly generous presents to the de facto rulers. It is clear, however, that such movements would require the concurrence of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Prom the Company’s point of view the step most desired would be a comprehensive definition of boundaries and authorities in the area concerned: or, failing this, permission to make its own arrangements for further exploration. The idea under which the Company started - that the hinterland was necessarily under the control of one or other of the coastal rulers - can no longer be entertained. (Intd.)

I had a call from this couple the other day. They had been sent on from the Royal Geographical Society, where they had made enquiries about the possibility of a journey into South East Arabia. They said that their object was to find out how they should set about obtaining permission for an archaeologicial exploration which, so far as I could make out, would be in an area somewhere to the south of Sharjah. They seemed extremely vague as to where exactly they wanted to go, but apparently their idea was to start in from the Trucial Coast. I explained that the Sheikhs in this area are in special relations with His Majesty’s Government and that the proper way of enquiring about facilities for travel in that area would be to write to the India Office Hon'ble Lt.Col. T.C.W. Fowle, K.C.I.E. , C.B.E., British Consulate-General, - Bushire. pi iqf.upr p-roiprAipv ! »» iw ^•7 37 INDIA OFFICE,explaining what they wanted to do. I said that, as they— were probably aware, it is not a part of the world suitable for anybody except the most experienced travellers, and that in any case His Majesty’s Government, in view of their responsibilities, v/ould have to consider the matter from the point of view of security etc., apart from the necessity of securing the permission of the various Sheikhs. There would also, of course, have to be consultation with the local authorities. I promised, however, that any communication which they miglit send to the India Office would be treated with every sympathy and with as little delay as possible. They quoted you, of course, as an old friend, and chey said that the Royal Geographical Society would be only too glad to give us full information about them. I re i raine '- ^ rorn telling them that we already had quite enough information without asking for any more. I have heard no more from them since their call (which was about a week ago), so perhaps they are not pursuing their idea. They also seemed to have in mind some scheme for travel in the Hadramaut, and they may have transferred their attention to that. Incidentally, I caught sight of them the other day at Philby’s lecture at the Royal Central Asian Society about his trans-Arabian journey ending in the Hadramaut (about which Lady Fowle has/has no doubt told you - it was an amusing evening). I send you this line in case we may have to consult you, on the basis of an application from them, as to the best means of turning it down* Possibly the simplest way would be to get the sheikh or Sheikhs in question to say that they a re mt prepared to grant facilities, if this could be arranged without undue trouble. I am sending a copy of this letter to Watts and Hickinbotham. P* S. I cannot say that I found the Countess very particularly attractive.

Dear Sir, On returning from Arabia recently I was able to obtain, from local sources, the position of the lost ancient city of Ubar in the Rub-el-Khali, S. Arabia. Mr. Hinks of the Royal Geographical Society advised me to get in touch with you in regard to the necessary permission to explore this part of the Arabian desert. I visited the India Office and was asked to write down a rough outline of the project. I should like to organise a party fromSbargah or Muscat, and penetrate two hundred miles into the Rub-el-Khali to the position of the ruined city* I am willing to take an official representative with me and also a representative of the British Museum if they are interested. The sole objective of the Expedition would be to photograph, film and study the antiquities of the site; specimens of which I have seen. Mr. Philby does not believe in the lost city, but my information is absolutely reliable. I should like to leave in October if possible; paying all expenses and leaving a deposit at Shargah if desired. Needless to say, I have had twenty years of desert exploration; Mr. Hinks can tell you further details (for career H Who*s Who’ 1 and Encyclopaedia Very Sincerely yours, (Sd.)

We understand that it was not stated in, or in connection with, the concessions that they were subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government, but that the Sultan and Lerrnitte were orally informed to this effect by the Political Agent, who previous to the negotiations explained to the Sultan the position regarding a political agreement.

PRGROK* I suggest Prorok be informed as regards Muscat that the Sultan has already refused him permission for archaeological researches in the interior. Since in any case the party*s security in a region so far from the coast can not be guaranteed it is impossible to pursue the matter further. 2. As regards the proposal to start frcm Sharjah, Prorok can be informed that the security of travellers using a base on the Trucial Coast can in no case be guaranteed owing to disputes over boundaries and jurisdictions in the interior. Should Prorok continue to press his project, I consider he should be clearly informed that no visa for landing in Muscat or on the Trucial Coast will be granted.

With regard to the text of the draft political agreement, Mr, Kden would suggest one minor amen&amp;nent ^ p-tY] namely that, in paragraph 10, the words ‘The Sultan shall not unreasonably withhold such permission, and 1 * might be omitted. It seems to Mr, Kden that these words, which add nothing to the sense, are open to the possible criticism that His Majesty’s Governaent purport to be saying what the Ruler of Muscat (i,e, a third party) will do. The second sentence of paragraph 10 should, he suggests, be in ”in any case in which.,,,” 3.

Conditions in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast, etc. Copy is enclosed of a record of a discussion with You will see that the Company are prepared to The issue of the above has been duly authorised Sd J. WaltonCONFIDENTIAL . PEK81AN GULF OIL &gt; Mr. Longrigg called by appointment on tne 29th September to discuss the question of Petroleum Concessions Limited exploring in the Trucial Coast hinterland, etc. Mr. Walton, Sir Trenchard Fowle and Mr. Symon were present at the interview. Mr. Longrigg explained that the Company 1 s geologists had covered most of the accesible parts of the territory concerned and that the Company now wished to push on with the exploration of the remaining areas. The exploration party would consist of Mr. T.F. Williamson and Mr. R. Pomeyrol, both of whom were permanently employed by the Company. The Company did not propose to engage any special staff for the work. Messrs Williamson and Pomeyrol were proceeding to the Gulf area forthwith and would be available if work could be found for them in the trucial hinterland. An important reason for making a complete exploration was that the Company had definitely t decided to commence boring operations in Qatar and that the extent of the operations in that area would to some extent depend,on the reports of their geologists in respect of the other territories in which the Company were interested. ^Machinery for the Qatar operations had already been ordered but at the moment the Company were zreluctant to commence actual operations pending a decision regarding the Bahrain unallotted area, since they feared that if oil were discovered in commercial quantities in Qatar before a decision was reached regarding the unallotted area they might find themselves obliged to considerably increase their present offer to the Shaikh of Bahrain) . Mr. Longrigg agreed that the proposed exploration was not a matter of vital urgency but, at the -/ same■■■■■■■■■■■ HHBMi - 2 - same time , he wished to avoid giving the impression that his Company were not interested in developing oil resources in all the territories for which they had obtained, or hope to obtain, concessions. then Mr. Longrigg/went on to explain that there were three areas in which his Company wished to pursue further explorat ions, viz: (a; Jebel Fayah and the country of the south and south-east thereof; country east and south of the Baraimi Oasis with Zebel Hafit, and to the south and south-east thereof; (bj The Muscat areas controlled by the Imam and the Beni Bu Ali tribe; and {c) The south-east coast of Muscat as far as Dhofar. The Company were not interested in the north-eastern coastal belt along by Bohar - Muscat- Has al Had. Mr.Longrigg said that it had been the Company 1 s intention to undertake during the coming winter and to deal with ^b) and VO during the winter of 1938-39. After a full discussion, during which the difficulties 5 in the way of undertaking further exploration until more is known of the position in the hinterland were explained, Mr. Longrigg agreed that it might be best for the Company to give up all ideas of exploring in the Trucial interland during the coming winter*. It was suggested to Mr. Longrigg that it might facilitate matters if the Company would indicate the particular areas in the hinterland in which they were specially interested. He replied that the Company were interested in the whole of the territory covered by V a ) above and in fact all the foothills of the western slopes of the Western Hajar, but that owing to their limited knowledge, it was almost impossible for them to specify particular areas. As regards- 3 - As regards Muscat territory , Mr# Longrigg said that his Company fully appreciated the difficulties which they were likely to encounter# He was, however, proposing to leave England during October and hoped to see the Hultan personally (either in India during the week commencing the 18th November or at Muscat during the week commencing the 24th November; with a view to discovering what areas the Hulfcan regarded as safe# He also had an idea that it might be useful if he could see the Imam of Oman with a view of discussing the possibility of the Company 1 s geologists exploring the territories controlled by the Imam# He asked that this suggestion should be considered. As regards the south-east coast of Muscat, Mr.Longrigg said that what his Company had in mind was to survey this area from the air. They had an idea to charter a steamer on which would be based an aeroplane or flying-*boat. Mr. Walton expressed grave doubts as to the advisability of undertaking even an aerial survey unless the Hultan was prepared to guarantee the safety of the party. As regards the territories controlled by the Imam, the difficulties would be even greater. Mr. Longrigg agreed and -stated that these were further reasons for his wishing to discuss matters with the Hultan. Meanwhile the Company were prepared to postpone any exploration for the present. A.C.B. bymon. &gt;IA OFFICE, 7th October 1937INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, H.W.l P.Z.6541/37 12th October Dear Longrigg, I promised to write :to you regarding the discussion on 29th September with you and Sir Trenchard Fowle on the i subject of conditions in the hinterlandof the Trucial Coast i and adjacent territories. You will remember that the conclusion was that it would be in the interests of all concerned to adhere generally to the procedure suggested by the Political ““esident and outlined in my letter of 31st August, that no attempt should be made to explore the Trucial hinterland until more is known of the de fact o position, and that the de facto t ribal authorities in the hinterland should be approached through the de .1 ure Kulers from whom the Company already has or obtains concessions. Though this procedure involves some delay in conducting further exploration, it seems preferable to proceed gradually. You pointed out that youe Company is definitely interested in exploring the possibilities of the areas of its concessions, but thought that in the circumstances they would be willing to fall in with the proposal to postpone any exploration work for the present. We are therefore instructing the acting Political Resident accordingly. The reasons which render it desirable to proceed with caution in the case of the Trucial hinterland were thought to apply with equal and perhaps greater force in the case of Muscat territory. The importance was recognisea of obtain ing the Hultan 1 s written consent before any attempt is made to begin exploratory work (either by land or sea) in any part of the territories controlled by His Highness. 'We understand that the Company does not propose to commence -/ exploration in/73 Hi exploration in Muscat territories for the present, but that you should like to interview the Sultan ^either in India or MuscatJ to discuss oil questions and make preliminary enquiries as to the means of exploring the south-eastern coast ^P‘&lt;55 and we are taking stepd to ascertain (by telegram) whether an interview with His Highness can be arranged. We are also consulting the local Political authorities on your suggestion that you might sound the Sultan as to the possibility of your meeting the Imam of* Oman in regard to the question of exploring in the territories controlled by the Imam. We hope to be able to send you a further communication in regard to these points very shortly. Yours sincerely Sd. J.C. Walton.1 T. 35/161 J • H * a '^opy. Telegram From To Hepe ated No. 2611.

Also included is a request by the Sultan of Muscat for the Political Agent at Muscat, Ralph Ponsonby Watts, to be present not only at the meeting with Longrigg but also at later meetings in Delhi where the British treaty with Muscat was likely to be discussed.Further discussion relating to exploration is included between the India Office and Petroleum Concessions Limited regarding the Company’s interest in exploring the South East Coast of Muscat and parts of the interior controlled by the Imam of Muscat and the difficulties they would be likely to encounter in attempting to do so; along with the area west of the Oman Mountain Range which Petroleum Concessions Limited were interested in ascertaining any known boundaries for, and otherwise how best to approach exploration there.Another matter of discussion within the volume is Count Byron de Prorok and his wife who had travelled to Muscat to undertake archaeological exploration, but had been refused permission to explore the interior of the country by the Sultan of Muscat.
