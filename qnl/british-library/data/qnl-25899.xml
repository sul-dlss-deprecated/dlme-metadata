Thank you for your letter of April 10th about possible reactions in India to our proposal to bring military pressure to bear on the Persian G-overnment in order to induce them to break off relations with Japan. I quite agree that the G-overnment of India should be informed in advance of the action we propose to take, and I understand that a telegram warning them of what is in the wind has been agreed between our two Departments. As regards the Majlis, we are not at all anxious to take the rather extreme step of closing it unless subsequent developments make this unavoidable. As we have said nothing to Maisky on the subject it seemed unnecessary to mention it to the G-overnment of India at this stage. Wher/ The Right Honourable L.S.

As i _s essentia.- any threats we make should he hacked hy iorce we have decided, co concentrate sufficient troops outside Tehran to he able ^occupy the capital if necessary ana enforce the closure at tne legation. 5. After the concentration has been effected Sir R. Bullard would demand an Immediate audience of theJJhah, He would . reproach the Shah for having allowed his rrime i/iinister to hipmg matters to the present critical stage and would demand niao ms Majesty should summon the Prime Minister forthwith and instruct him to proceed immediately to break on relations ,/i*h Japan an . to hand the Japanese Legation their passports 0 ^ x, . u '^'^ a:LC ^ would inform the Shell that if he does not comply witn ms request it will he necessary for British forces to occupy the capital and enforce the closure of the Japanese ...egation, we have no intention of keeping troops at Tehran after they have achieved this purpose. 4, As it was agreed last October that neither we nor the Soviet Government would make any changes in the disposition oi our forces in Persia without consulting each other (see my telegram No. 897 of 1941 to Tehran), the Soviet Ambassador has been informed of the action we propose to take. But the , memorandum handed to M, Maiski made it clear tham his Majesty s Government realised that as the Soviet Government are still m diplomatic2 . diplomatic relations v/ith japan it would be difficult for them to take part in or indeed'specif ically to approve any direct action against the Japanese Legation. While they are grateful for the support already given to their representations hy the Soviet Ambassador in Tehran, His Majesty’s Government naturally do not wish to cause the Soviet Government any embarrassment and do not therefore ask for their concurrence in the proposed action. The memorandum went on to add that if British forces are obliged to occupy Tehran and if the situation should so develop as to render other measures necessary the Soviet Government may v/ish to t be associated in the occupation of the capital. -His Majesty’s Government would of course welcome such a decision. As regards the other measures which might be necessary the Soviet Government were reminded that the diffi culties' created by the Persian Government over the supply of local currency are endangering the maintenance of the supply route to the Soviet Union, but nothing was said about the possible closing of the Majlis, 5. M. Maiski promised to telegraph at once to his Government, While he made no comment he did not appear to think that there would be apy serious difficulty. It v/as explained to him that unless in the meanwhile the Persian Government gave way and did what we required of them we propose to take action in about a week { s time. — 6.

He nointed out that since his arrival here, all promises, assurances, and undertakings hy Persian Government had been quite valueless, and that in all his experience he had'never encountered such prevarication, delay, and obstruction. He thought that ic was only right that the Persian Government should he warned in advance of our fueling and not come to us vdth apneaIs and cornulaints when it was too late.

The view of Prime Minister was that Russia’s aggressive attitude in Khorassan made it difficult for him to get the approval from the Majlis for satisfying our requirements without some quid pro quo . Further what the Cabinet might feel would 'not necessarily be endorsed by the Persian people. The Counsellor concluded by saying that if wo did not receive satisfaction the Russians and ourselves might come even closer together and the Prime Minister’s position would become even more embarrassing.

Despite our strong- representations luk Persian Prime'liinister has still failed to expel Japanese Legation, wiiile Persian Government are creating diificulties over supply of local currency, thus endangering maintenance of supply route to Soviet Union. H.M.G. regard immediate removal of Legation as an urgent military hecessity and they therefore propose to compel Persian Government to comply by show of military force. Sufficient troops will be concentrated outride Tehran to occupy the capital if Bullard's demands, which will be made direct to Shah, are not complied with. As Soviet Government is still in relations with Japan they obviously cannot oe associated with this move, but M. kaisxy has been informed of what is proposed. 2. You will no doubt not dispute necessity of action to ensure expulsion of Japanese Legation, but possiblg. nuliuary occupation of capital may have certain consequences/consequences e.g. (1) Russians are liuely to be highly suspicious of our motives, and as soon as Japanese Legation is expelled would almost certainly insit on sending Russian troops also into Tehran. They would probably also tend to strengthen their grip on Northern Persia and to increase /WvTi'Mtj tneir efforts w Sovietisation of Azer~iaijan. (2) It is probable that Indian Brigade now at Dizful would be used for demonstration. This might nert be regarded f^rvourab-ly-&amp;y Indian memoers of Council^ **- (3) It is possible Dhat further steps might have to follow e.g. closing down of kajlis.

He has not fulfilled this undertaking and now maintains that he is unable to do so. owing to the opposition which the proposal has encountered in the Majlis. It is now evident that the Persian Government have no intention of expelling the Japanese Legation unless they are compelled to do so* s His Majesty's Government regard the immediate removal of the Legation as a matter of urgent military necessity, they propose to concentrate sufficient troops outside Tehran to be able to occupy the capital, should this be necessary* hen the concentration has been effected.

The latest position as to this is that the Prime Minister was to put it before the majlis yesterday, but it is not expected that ar$r tangible result will emerge. The meeting was really confined to discussion with the Paaaa a.gn Office representatives of military details and there was little opportunity of discussing the policy, which had apparently already been decided upon in the Foreign Office. The attached memorandum which v/as circulated at the meeting was to have been brought this morning by Mr. Eden before the War Cabinet but I understand that owing to pressure of business it was not possible to take it today. The following points occur to me in connection with this proposal:- (l) The effect of such action on our part on the Russians. It seems inevitable that it will arouse their worst suspicions and even if they cannot join in over the ousting of the Japanese Legation it seems certain that they will send their own forces cinto Tehran as soon as the Japanese have been got rid of, if only to keep an eye on us. I should anticipate also that they will increase their efforts to Sovietize Azerbaijan and generally strengthen their control of the north of Persia. /n (2) The Foreign Office apparently anticipate that further steps /o /Will be required e.g. the closing of the majlis. Since we are r f V ' ^ ro: ^ es3 ^- rl ^ fight f or democratic forms of government and are making propaganda ofconstitutional form of government in Persia, any action of this kind would seem to be playing into the hands of enemy propagandists. (3) If the majlis is shut down it seems certain that the Government would resign at the same time and we should be forced to take over control ourselves. It would seem unfortunate that we should do this in a Muslim country and we must anticipate unfavourable reactions both in Afghanistan and in India. k^o-6 SjJr- 2 - (4) Although the troops in Persia are now under the Commander-in- chief, ] iddle East, the actual troops that will be engaged are the Indian Brigade now at Dizful. If there is constituted any form /“N of National C^vernment „in India in the near future they may not view with favour military action in a neighbouring Muslim State by Indian troops, especially when these troops sire outside their control, ./a: ; - '' UC-' 1 - C .»&gt; These are all points which are of some concern to the Government of India and I feel that the Government of India ought to be given a chance of expressing their opinion before a definite decision is taken to act on the lines proposed. The question would not, of course, arise if the Prime Minister, contrary to expectations, persuades the majlis to agree without further shilly-shally^to get rid of the Japanese Legation, or if the Bar Cabinet were to reject the proposal when it is put to them by ]r, Eden, The activities of the Japanese Legation, to which objection is taken, are set out in Sir R. Bullard’s telegram Ho.439 of 6th April (the top telegram below). These activities are certainly very objectionable and no doubt dangerous, but whether they are so dangerous as to warrant a military demonstration with all the possibilities that nay arise therefrom, I do not feel convinced. -- ii r : ' ‘ oi:: xci:. ■ •- 'Memorandum on he difficulties which have been experienced in securing the removal of the Jauane se Legation in Tehran » To take only the later stages of this question, which has now been pending between ourselves and the Persian Government for many months and v/hich has its origin in the circumstance that the Treaty with Persia required that country only to sever relations v/ith States which were at war with both the Allied Powers, viz. Great Britain and the Soviets our strong representations to notify the Japanese Legation of the rupture of relations on 5th April and again on 7th April. He has not fulfilled his undertaking on either date and continues to plead the opposition which the proposal has encountered in the Majlis to whom it ought never to have been referred. taking to consult the.Majlis again on 9th April. There is no reason to suppose that any useful result will follow this consultation. the Persians is the cutting off of ail supplies which are received mainly from the United States. The American Government are anxio.is and eager to help. But it is felt that the application of such a sanction as e.g. the suspension of wheat shipments may well be slow to take effect. a further is urgently needed if the supply route to the Soviet Union is to be kept in full operut ion. The steps by which it is proposed to secure the expulsion of the Japanese Legation (and in all probability also the adoption of a more accommodating attitude by the Persians over the currency question) are as follows: 1. The G. 0. C, should be asked to concentrate sufficient troops outside Tehran to be able to occupy the capital, if necessary, 2* after the concentration has been effected, Sir R. Bullard should demand an immedic.te audience of the Shah* He should reproach, the Shah for having allowed his Prime Minister to bring matters to the critical stage The Persian Prime Minister undertook in the face of All that can be obtained from him is a further under- The only non-military weapon which we possess against Sw-a. 4 oixx ij uo inc'.,y vv u j. x uu ojluw 0 U 0 o.AC: UXIUCO.

The Persians are behaving equally badly in making difficulties for us over the supply of local currency which which/which they have reached and should doManu that His Majesty summon the Prime Minister forthwith and instruct him to proceed immediately to breai: off relations witn Japan ana uo ho.nd the ’Japanese Legation their passports- The departure of Japanese via India should he supervised by our L&lt; ^tion with, if necessary, the assistance of British military officers, * sir R.

Legation is distributing Axis propaganda literature in Tehran and provinces designed to spread alarm and despondency among the population and contrary f to Persia, declared policy of alliance with -ho democracies. (Typical Japanese brochure was annexed, which after making exaggerated naval claims attempts to show that we are resorting to a propaganda war. haying no other weapon left. Thus accoun of Hong Kong atrocities, of American troops arriving in Australia and of our strength in tanks and ijnerican aircra in Burma and India respectively are all described as lies, extracts are given from General Tojo's speech on similar lines of March 12th; papers found at Rangoon are alleged to prove that His Majesty's Ambassador at Chungking asked ioi more news of Allied successes even if untrue in order to sustain Chinese morale; and General macArthur s transfer tu Australia is described as a 5i flight'’ and an example ^of Allied leniency to a defeated General). 2. In order further to upset normal trend of Persian opinion, money is also being lavishly distributed especially by Hussein Ud Din Ghaffari who has entertained Persians ^01 all classes in an attempt to vilify Persian G0 X er Ki lcn ^ o ^ nnc their policy as stated in treaty and to persuade the Persians to assist Axis and harm their own and Allied cause by word and deed. 5 # On the very day when recent evacuation of Polish divisions - a secret military move - v/as due to begin, tnree members of the Japanese Legation found significantly enougn that their presence was required at the frontier post m question. 4./4 No single telegram has been despatched since denial of cypher facilities. Therefore the Japanese Legation oitW has no business to do or else is sending by secret means messages v/hich could not properly be sent en clair. 5. The above constitutes overwhelming evidence of illicit, improper, subversive and undiplomatic activities* The Persian Government have every reason and urgently need to request withdrawal at once, memorandum ends.

The Prime Minister informed me to-day that the Cabinet had agreed in principle, but wanted something from America in exchange, viz. trucks, wheat, sugar, drugs and other things - apparently on Lease-Lend terms, I said I was sure that neither the United States Government nor the British would enter into such a bargain: he must get rid^of the Japanese for the sake of Persia and because it is in accord with spirit ef the Tripartite Alliance and then the Allies would do their best for Persia. 2, The United States Minister will take the same line with the Prime Minister. He tells me, in confidence, that his Government authorised him, a few days ago, to inform the Prime Minister, for his information and that of the ministers directly interested only.that the benefits of the Lease—Lend Act had been extended to Persia, The United States Minister assumes that i this news is only to be released vdien the Persian Government has decided to ask the Japanese Legation to leave and wiLl tell the Prime Minister that to try to [?grp, omtd: get] more out of the United States before taking this decision will have the worst effect. 3, The Japanese Minister, Military Attach^, and two_ secretaries have visited places on the Caspian in the Russian zone without even informing the Russians beforehand, and the Soviet Ambassador, who considers that the object was to collect information about the Poles who are due to arrive, has promised to represent this to the Prime Minister as undesirable activity. 4 ..

I do not know whether United States Government have yet decided on their reply to the Persian Government*s request for supplies of motor vehicles, tyres and sugar.

IMCEDIiiTE ddddddd 14th March, 1942. fl AAavJL t5 L0 ola. u3 OA ^ My telegram No. 336 [of the 7th March: Japanese Legation at Tehran], Now that a new Government is in power you and your United States colleague (who should by now have received the further instructions foreshadowed in V/ashington telegram No. 1239) will no doubt consider that the time has come for making a further attempt to secure the closing of the Japanese Legation, to which we attach great importance. 2. The main difficulty is to induce the Persian Government to believe that it is to their own interest to take action. Otherwise they will prefer to adopt the easy course of doing nothing at all. The prospect of losing American goodwill and innerlean practical assistance in case of need should prove a powerful incentive, and I hope that your United States colleague will feel able to put this argument as force fully as may be necessary to carry conviction and overcome hesitations. But the question is how we for our part can reinforce these representations, bearing in mind that it v/ould be unwise to use threats which we should not in the last resort be prepared to implement. In this connexion it may be worth considering whether, even though we could not well withhold wheat supplies without provoking disturbances and possibly breakdown in law and order which might affect our own military security, this would apply to an equal extent to other commodities, e.g. sugar. Would it for example be useful to remind the Prime Minister that it is going to be increasingly difficult to secure supplies of certain commodities, e.g. sugar, in the near future and that if, as we fear, there is about to2 , be a shortage, it v/ill be only natural for the British authorities to give the uost favourable possible treat ment to the countries whose Governments are co-operating wholeheartedly with us, e.g. Iraq, which in virtue of her Treaty of Alliance with us has already expelled the Japanese Legation from Bagdad? 3. We have moreover evidence to show that the Japanese themselves expect the Persian Government to close their Legation. They even asked the'United States Government some weeks ago to facilitate the repatriation of their diplomatic and consular staffs from Persia, You may therefore tell the Prime Minister this and suggest that the Persian Government have at least nothing to lose by doing what the Japanese expect them to do. The Japanese will in any case attribute this development, not to the Persian Government’s ill-will, but to British and American pressure and Persia’s inability to withstand it in view of-her complete dependence on us for supplies.

Repeated to Kuibyshev No. 134, Gt366GOU eiA^ % h. i IMPORTANT. Ever since the Japanese entered the war, we have been anxious to induce the Persian Government to break off relations with Japan and close the Japanese Legation. Although their cypher and bag facilities have been withdrawn, we have reason to suppose that xhe ^Japanese Legation have a secrex wireless transmitter with which 'they rnay be able to pass on military and other important information 'to Tokyo and thence to Berlin and Rome. They are also a potential source of communication between the Persian Government and'the Axis. 2. When the Persians broke off relations v/ith the other Axis Powers last September it was as the result of joint Anglo- Soviet pressure, but as the Soviet Government are anxious not to embroil themselves with the Japanese at the moment, we cannot hope for their support in this case. Moreover, even if the proposed Treaty with Persia were in force, the Persians would be under no obligation to break off relations v/ith Japan. The Treaty only states that Persia will not maintain diplomatic relations with any State which is in relations with neither the United Kingdom nor the Soviet Union. 3. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has asked the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to close the Japanese Legation but, although he has a grudge against the Legation for having harboured the ex-Mufti, Minister for Foreign Affairs pretended to believe that it offers no danger at present. It therefore seems unlikely that the Legation will be closed unless we can bring strong pressure to bear. Our only weapons are military and economic. We do not want to send troops back to Tehran merely in order to secure the closing of the Japanese Legation and the Soviet Government might well object to our doing so. We could tell the Persian Government that we shall not send them any further supplies of wheat or sugar until the Japanese Legation is closed. But the resultant shortage of foodstuffs would increase anti-British feeling, might lead to civil disturbances, and might in the long run do us more hc-.ru; than the Persians. 4. According to Sir R. Bullard, the American Minister at Tehran would be very glad if the Japanese Legation were closed, but feels unable to press for this without instructions from Washington, for which he has promised to telegraph. The Persian Government are very anxious to conciliate the United States at present and Sir R. Bullard considers that pressure from the United States Minister would be very helpful. Please explain position to State Department and say that we should be very grateful for any assistance which they may be able to give us in this matter.

Sir, Foreign Office, September 23, 1941. I ASKED the Soviet Ambassador to come and see me this afternoon and we discussed a number of matters. I informed his Excellency that the ex-Shah was . shortly leaving Persia. I understood that his destination was to be Mauritius. The Ambassador expressed his pleasure at this news, and added that he hoped that we would keep the ex-Shah under surveillance in Mauritius so that he could not escape from the island. He hoped that the ex-Shah would not be allowed to go to any neutral country, such as South America. I told his Excellency that I shared his view on this point. 2. I then gave the Ambassador a copy of the draft Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty. M. Maisky said that he would refer the text to his Government, but that at first sight the treaty seemed to him to be on the right lines. I told him that I would now telegraph the text to Sir R. Bullard, and the Soviet Ambassador in Tehran would no doubt be instructed to discuss it with him in due course. 3. The Ambassador recalled that we had previously discussed the question of the Vichy Legation at Tehran. His Government would like this to be closed. They understood that we might have a certain difficulty in taking such action and were prepared to ask the Persian Government to do so themselves, as we had done in the case of Bulgaria. I said that I hoped that the action would be joint, and, indeed, I thought it quite possible that Sir R. Bullard had already taken it. In any event, I would instruct him to concert his action with the Soviet Ambassador. I . I am, &amp;c. ANTHONY EDEN.

I urged strongly that initiative in the handing over of these Germans lay with Japanese Minister to Tehran who should never have agreed to admit them to his Legation, and that the right course was for the Japanese Government to instruct him to deliver them forthwith to the proper Persian authorities. The Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs stated, however, confidentially that he [grp.omitted ?had] had the greatest difficulty with other Japanese authorities concerned in reaching even this solution, and that he hoped very much that we would see our way to accept it; presumably the Persian Government was in friendly relations with Great Britain and would therefore have no objection to making the necessary demand &gt; which would greatly ease things for Japanese Government. 3.

(E 136/186/93) 12th January, 1942. Dear Lumby, Your letter Ext 86/42 of the 7th January about the Japanese Legation party in Iraq.. It is true that the Japanese consular personnel in India are likely to be repatriated via Turkey though it is not certain (a proposal has now been made that the exchange should take place at Louren&lt;jo Marques). If the Japanese in Iraq are sent to India they may therefore have to retrace their footsteps. The negotiations with the Japanese Government for the exchange of personnel are, however, making very slow progress, and it is quite possible that months will pass before final agreement is reached. We should therefore like to avail ourselves of the Government of India’s offer.

G a G Your teleg ram N o^l8l^_^ I have discussed the matter with Minister for Foreign Affairs. I found him willing to take up the idea of indicating to the Japanese Government that the present Minister is not persona grata on the gounds that it is distasteful to the Regent to receive representative who presented credentials to the usurper whose Government so cruelly maligned him. 2. He was hesitant about denying cypher facilities to the Japanese Legation but promised to discuss it with his colleague. My explanation of what had been done in Egypt evidently encouraged him. His chief fear was that Japan might retaliate by breaking off diplomatic relations and that trade with Japan would then stop. I pointed out that Japan was not likely to give up her good market here and that trade had gone on quite well before the Legation had been established. ^ Vi'cta-f 3. As regards abolition of thelLegation, he thought it would not be difficult to suspend cypher facilities as French authorities in Syria had stopped despatches of cypher telegrams by Consulates. RECd.

I agree that cypher facilities etc., should in any case be withdrawn from Japan and Vichy. 2. Paragraph 2. Reason given by us for this request to the Egyptian Government, and used by them with Missions concerned, was that restrictions were emergency measures rendered necessary by military situation. Action was simplified by facts that (a) etat de sibge is in force in Egypt and (b) the enemy is actually on Egyptian soil. Even so request had to be repeated several times before effective action v/as taken. In drawing parallel with Egypt it would therefore I think be well for you not to go into too many details. 3. Action is certainly unusual, but Iraqi Government may regard with indifference any threat of reprisals from Japan or Vichy. ^~D tFrom: EGYPT. FROM CAIRO TO BAGDAD Sir M.

On April 10th I asked the Egyptian Government to remove ' bag and cypher facilities from the Japanese, French and Swedish Legations as had already been done in the case of countries occupied by Germany. Reason given was imperative necessity for ensuring security of Egypt and known evidence that these Legations, and particularly 'the Japanese, were active centres of German espionage 0 Evidence of this from secret sources has been quoted to the Egyptian Government and particular use was made of the fact that Japanese Consul at Port Said was caught photographing sunken ship in the canal. After considerable pressure the Egyptian Government withdrew cypher facilities from all foreign Missions in Egypt making secret arrangement 15y~which certain friendly Legations could continue to send cypher telegrams (British, United States. Greek and Turkish,, I believe Iraq has since been included;. Suppression of cypher ^telegrams was announced to diplomatic Missions by ctfficiolno’to referring to action at the time of censorship proclamation of September 1939 by which diplomatic Missions were granted cypher privilege as a derogation from general prohibition and with reference to article 27 of Telecommunications Gonvention 1932. Protests have been received from several Legations but have been disregarded. 2. Palestinian Government have lately been instructed to take the same action as in Egypt to prohibit cypher telegrams.FROM BAGDAD TO FOREIGN OFFICE , L 1 s 41 G-N OFFICE ; ! 1 9,50«p.m. June 9th, 1941. 12.30.a.m. June 11th,1941. ^ Sir K.

It appears xo me however that if we are to restrict the harmful activities of the Japanese Legation action contemplated in paragraphs 2 and 3 must be accompanieu by that foreshadowed in paragraphs 4 to 6 inclusive. Removal of Minister and Military*Attache will certainly not be suf ficient in itself asthe remainder of staff would still carry pn undesirable activities against us. The only other Legation involved by paragraph 4 is the French Legation'. 2, Before approaching Minister for Foreign /iffairs on the whole question, may I be informed of the form and extent of pressure placed by His Majesty's Government on Egyptian Government to take action against the Japanese Legation at Cairo and what legal or other arguments were employed in support of denial of cypher facilities 0 Minister for Foreign Affairs will certainly raise the point. Rashid Ali's administration removed cypher facilities from this Embassy last month although there had been no rupture of diplomatic relations. No protest was actually^made by His Majesty's Embassy against action of T rciqi authorities but a strong case could have been made out based on freedom of communications for diplomatic missions. 3. I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs J o ascertain whether there is evidence that the Japanese Minister openly associated himself with the Axis or Ali last month.OUTWARD TELEGRAJV [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Gov [ EXT 1 3308 srnment, and should b &lt;i§) e kept under Lock and Key.] T9T1 [This telegram is retained by the of particular secrecy and should 0G authorised recipient and.not passed onj (E) [CYPHER] WAR CABINET DISTRIBUT ION.

Bagdad throughout recent crisis are known to us to have been most oo 3 ecuion- able. They were entirely directed against His Majeou^ Government and the Regent. 2. If Japanese Minister openly associated himsel± with the Axis or Rashid Ali’s military activities, and Iraqi authorities have evidence of this, they shoul inform Japanese Government that he is £qrsqna^non ^raga .and demand his immediate recall. They should also mane difficulties about accepting .a successor. 3. If, as I understand to be the case, Military Attache has joined Japanese Legation staff, Iraqi authorities should insist on his immediate departure on . the ground that no diplomatic mission at Baguad is permitted to have Service Attaches. A. If, on the other hand, there is no evidence against Japanese Minister, it will be necessary to take certain steps to prevent the despatch by him of information likelv to be of assistance to the enemy. In that case you should insist on the immediate issue of instructions to the effect that, for the duration of the war, no diplomatic missions' in Bagdad, except those of Great ■Rritain Iraa's Ally, those of Powers assisting in Great Britain's war effort (in which Turkey should be included), and those of members of the Saadabad Pact, should e allowed the privilege of sending telegrams m code or cypher.i 2 . 5*. In the case of missions whose cypher iabilities are being withdrawn, facilities should only be permitted for confidential bags when these are consigned to their Governments direct, i*e, Japanese Legation may continue to send confidential bags direct to Tokyo by sea, but not to Tehran. The^Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs should issue a circular to the diplomatic body in the above sense. .6* / Iraqi Government will have to impress on Iranian ' v Persian) Legation that correspondence from other missions must in no circumstances be sent through Iranian diplomatic bag. , Please press the Iraqi authorities strongly at first practicable opportunity to take steps set forth above. They are in their own interest as much as in ours. Action proposed in paragraphs A to 6 above need be taken only if action on paragraph 2 is impracticable. It is of course to be regarded as an emergency measure necessitated by military situation. you may explain that Egyptian'Government agreed some time ago to take precisely'Similar steps.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0000a0_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/526</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0000a0</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/526</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Ext 3332/41 'Japanese legations in the Middle East: withdrawal of cypher and bag facilities; repatriation of Japanese consuls and nationals'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1941/1942</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-06-23T13:58:41</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (159 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in rough chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 161; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file comprises telegrams, despatches, correspondence, memoranda, and notes, relating to the Japanese legations in the Middle East.
