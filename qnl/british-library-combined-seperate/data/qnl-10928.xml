It outlines Russian activities in the region (e.g. troop movements, fort construction, and meetings with local chieftains), along with British and Persian diplomatic responses to these activities; this includes British efforts to prevent Persia from ceding the region to Russian control. It covers British suspicions that the Russians are encroaching on Persia's northern border, and attempting to draw the local Turkoman tribes away from their relations with Persia.The memorandum is illustrated with a number of map sketches, which show a number of different interpretations of the Persian-Russian frontier:Captain George Campbell Napier's Map 1876. Denoting supposed Persian border line (f 116);Arrowsmith Map. 1834 (f 117r);Zimmerman's Map. 1841 (f 117v);Vambery's Map 1863 (f 117v);Russian Map 1863 (f 119r);Arrowsmith Map 1872 (f 119v);Walker's Turkestan. 1873 (f 120r);Russian Map 1873 (f 122r);Kiepert's Turkestan 1876 (f 135v).The memorandum includes a number of brief insertions in French; these insertions consist of recollections from diplomatic conversations, which have occurred in relation to Persia's northern frontier.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Russia</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Russian Commander of the Transcaspian Military Sector</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Atrek river</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kara Kalla</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000050#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
