This is exactly wiiat many people would like to do here,particul arly t^e wealthy property o«mers who prefer that anyone siiould shoulder the financial burdens of Bahrain except themselves. But surely the Shaikh is prohibited by Treaty from increasing his Customs dues beyond a fixed amount? in the Bahrain Ireaty the Shaikh is debarred from » sellin; lana to foreigners, actually,of course,Persians own a consiaemble aaount of landed property in Bahrain, and even Europeans,for instance Lr.Bienenield,have i acquired plots of lane b^ purchase or-otnerwise. Do you consider that this calls for any action?

The Diary did not mention it but Dickson has reported subsequently that the additional tax is not to be levied on goods imported by British subjects. The remainder of your letter is being answered separately. In dealing with separate subjects could you please write separate letters.

Unless you consider it urgent for any reason I should prefer to leave the question over for Colonel Biscoe's return. Gapt ♦ G . G. Pr i or, I. A. Political Agent, BAHRAIN. .m D.0»No:0/90» Political Agency, Bahrai^the 2iid - ugust 1931# The recent visit of Shaikh iunad al Jabir has been a great surprise to everyone,tot least Shaikh Hamad,but I have been ^unable to discover any single reason which would account for it t from a remark which Shaikh Sir Ahmad let drop I understand that he intended to ^o to Basra but not receiving a suitable response from the Iraq Government he changed his mind and at the last moment decided to visit Bahrain. The second reason is,I think,that having bought a new launch he must needs prove it and this was the only direction he could conveniently come in# Unfortunately he has shown a somev/hat critical attitude towards his Bahrain hosts and seldom H lets an opportunity pass of pointing out how much more civilized he and his household are. He gave the other officials ^myself and Shaikh Hamad a dinner* on his yacht last night,an entertainment which I hope he will not repeat. It was extremely hot. There was a decided swell - and his electric light machinery made a most unpleasent noiae^ and not a single dish was in any way palatable to Shaikh Hamad; ^and his host insisted on his drinking limejuice which everyone one knows does not suit hin^but such is Shaikh Hamad 's natural kindliness and dignity that he never let it be guessed how little the entertainment was to his taste. Shaikh Ahmad lells me that he contemplates purcliasing soeb pied a terre in Bahrain# I do not know what your views are in the matter but I think it would prove rather expensive to Shaikh jj Hamad as he always feels under an obligation to spend on people who come here whether it is necessary or not.
