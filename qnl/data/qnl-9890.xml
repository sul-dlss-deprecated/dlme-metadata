The documents are a covering letter from the British Embassy in Baghdad that introduces a more extensive commentary on the new law as an attached second document.Together, the two documents spell out British objections to the passage of the law on various technical and political grounds. Specifically, the second document recounts British concerns on the legalisation of what British observers describe as a form of slavery. The details of the new law are spelled out, along with its beneficiaries and those whose interests the law will harm. The rationale for objecting to the law revolves around preventing revolt among the actual cultivators of areas to be brought under new agricultural methods with the new law.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Land reform</topic></subject><subject><topic>Customary law</topic></subject><subject><topic>Agricultural labour</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Social conflicts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Irrigation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00008e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
