In 1940 Italian aircraft from the Mediterranean made an unsuccessful attempt to destroy the Refinery of the American Oil Compary in Bahrain; after dropping nearly fifty bombs they flew on to blast Africa. That they entirely missed the Keflnezy* which was Illuminated like a fairground, was an amazing fact. It w s said in the bazaars that the bombing was done by British planes, who^avoided doing ary harm, in order that America should declare War on Italy but a day or two later. Axis broadcasts announced that the ; Refinery had been destroyed. In 194-3 a Steamer ms torpedoed A v ' 1 inside Muscat Harbour, &amp; few hundred yards from the houses on saw anything of the tfar* One exception ms the Uncle of the present Ruling Shaikh of Bahrainwho, after visiting America, was &amp; passenger on an Italian Steamer in the Mediterranean when Mussolini declared War. The Italian vessel ms making for home when it was intercepted and taken to Malta by a British Man-of-War and the Shaikh spent some weeks on the island. Eventually he was able to return by sea to Egypt and thence, via Saudi Arabia, to Bahraini his descriptions of what he had seen in Malta were store valuable propaganda than the efforts of Publicity Officers over mazy months. What affected the ordinary Arabs of the Gulf most acutely during the War^ ms the change in their diet and the2 increase in the cost of living. The staple food of the Coast Arabs used to be rice. Vfben rice ceased to come from Burma md and all the stocks in the bazaars were eaten, the Arabs were cceapelled to adopt a diet of wheat. At first they declared that it was impossible to eat ft but by degrees they became, to a certain extent, accustomed to wheat. Few people, except the Shaikhs and the educated merchants, realised or fully appreciated the valuable help which was rendered by the British Government, which kept the Arab States, whose people depended almost entirely upon imported foodstuffs, supplied throughout the War with the essentials of life. Pood prices necessarily increased, though the cost of living in the Gulf was, on the whole, considerably lower than in neighbouring Countries, and in the more advanced States price control was enforced and many ccesnodities were, and still are, rationed. The Arabs, though mostly illiterate, accepted rationing without demur and generally co-operated with the Rationing Authorities. The public way of life in gnall villages made it very difficult for householders to evade the rationing regulations without the neighbours knowing, and when one neighbour knew, everybody - including the Authorities - knew. In Bahrain, where the Goverrment bought and imported all food supplies for the population, shops opened in towns and villages for selling rationed goods and the queue system, though perhaps not as smoothly working as in England, came to stay. The War years were prosperous years for most of the Arabs in the Gulf but they were anxious and trying year's for the Europeans who vorked there. Much of this prosperity came from legitimate sources but big fortunes were made too by less reputable means. Owing to iiqportant developments in the Oil industry in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, and numerous public works connected with the War, there was a great demand for labour31 skilled men,* burtf any young Arabs with alight school education# could obtain well-^aid posts* The Pearl industry flourished. although the fleets of diving boats were smaller because nary of the divers preferred to earn money on shore, and high prices we&gt;-e obtained for pearls in India, where many people invested money in precious stones* No iSuropean buyers visited the Gulf during the War, and few, if any. pearls were sent to JSurope. Boat builders - while there was still wood to be had - made handsome fortunes and the owners of big sailing dhows reaped unheard of profits by carrying cargoes between India, Iraq, and the Gulf ports; as the steamers became fewer and more Irregular, the sea traffic by native craft increased* *ka souk Al itswad“, the Black Market, became a new and much—used expression in the Arab language, which also adopted the word 'ration', and snuggling was rac?&gt;ant in the Gulf* Smuggling in pro-War days consisted of bringing goods into a Country without paying Customs, during the War the procedure was reversed and goods, whose export was forbidden, were smuggled out of one Country to another where prices were higher. At one time a bag of sugar could be bought in Bahrain for about 00 rupees; opposite, on the Persian Coast* the same bag would be sold for 800 rupees* Motor tyres fetched fabulous prices in Persia and Iraq, and tea. was a very profitable ccramodity for smuggling. Fortunes were made fcy a few successful smuggling ventures and if the culprits were caught by Government Patrols, as frequently happened, they spent their impriaoment looking forward to years of financial ease after doing time* A dearth of things to buy, such as Cars, Launches and WirelessSets, and the impossibility of building owing to the lack of materials, caused many Arabs to invest the money which they made during the War, in gardens and Wouse property, which resulted in a Land boom* The political calm of the Gulf Arabs ms very little ruffled by the blasts of wireless propaganda directed upon them from Allied and Axis Stations* Axis broadcasts were forbidden in Public plac s but roost people listened to them in their homes* The B. B*C • acquired a reputation for truthfulness; Berlin ms regarded as providing the best entertainment, and Ankara frequently gave news in Arabic which was in advance of other Stations* In the island of Bahrain^ there was a Broadcasting Station during the War* Though a few politically-minded Arabs watched with interest the development of the Arab League, most of the people in the Gulf were too busily concerned with their own affairs to pay much at ention to what went on in the Arab Countries bordering on the Mediterranean* While sympathising with the / Arabsof Palestine in their resistance to Jewish iKEdgration into their Country, the Gulf Arabs have not allowed their feelings to affect the friendly relations which exist between them and the small Jewish Corrnunities in the Gulf* The Persian Gulf has closer ties with India than with Iraq, K^pt and the Levant; most of the trade of the Gulf is with India, food supplies come from India and Bombay is the market for pearls before they are sent to Europe* The number of Arabs who travel from the Gulf to Egypt is *b]- 1 in comparison to the number who pay regular lengthy visits to India* The political future of India is a matter of more interest to most of the people in the Gulf than the situation in Palestine*The American Oil interests, which have developed into tremendous comaerclal Undertakings in Bahrain and in Saudi Arabia, have not caused ax$r political reactions anwyng the Arabs, who welcome the increased commercial activity because it provides enplqyment for thousands of labourers and brings money into the States T&amp;here Oil has been found* The Arabs n~ are not greatly concerned with the Nationalities of the Oil Companies which are operating, and in all political matters they look to the Government of India for advice and for help# The standard of living in the Gulf has become higher during the last decade and, owing to the general prosperity, many of the Arab Rulers have been able to extend the Social Services in their states, especially in the direction of Public Health and Education, In Bahrain and Kuweit not only are there maiy Beys* Schools but there are Schools for ^irls, to which even the Religious /Leaders send their daughters, although when female education was first introduced they opposed it vigourously* Local Government has developed educated young Arabs hold important posts under the Arab Shaikhs, whose rule is theoretically autocratic but in practice democratic. But higher standards of living cannot be maintained by local resources alone and in all parts of the Gulf the crying need of the moment is for goods from abroad; the bazaars are bare, building and expansion is held up owing to the lack of imported materials; transport is at a low ebb owing to the lack of motor vehicles and engines; everything is used up and worn out and there are empty markets waiting to be replenished from Europe, or from the Country that gets in first on the Eastern markets.36 NOTES FOR PERSONS PROCEEDING- TO BAHRAIN 1.

Miscellaneous. 1. INTRODUCTORY. These notes are -written in 194-5 ^hen conditions in Bahrain, as elsewhere, are far from normal. Before the war one could buy in the bazaars of Bahrain almost everything that a newcomer would require, by the end of the war shops had become depleted but it is hoped that gradually conditions will return to the prewar standard. 2. P OLITICAL. Bahrain is an independent Arab State, consisting of a group of islands half way down the Persian Gulf, in treaty relation with the Government of India, which is represented there by a Political Agent. The Ruler of the State is His Highness Shaikh Sulman bin Hamed A1 Khalifah, K. C.I.E. The population is almost 100,000 consisting principally of Arabs. The chief industries are oil, pearl diving and agriculture. There is a resident European community of not less than 600 British and Americans. Bahrain is an airport on the United Kingdom - India air route and is served by steamers of the British India line. The currency is the Indian rupee. There is an Indian Post Office, Indian stamps, surcharged ' , BAHRAIN ,, are used. 5. CLIMATE. The climate of the Persian Gulf is notorious but in fact it is scarcely as bad as it is made out. The seasons in Bahrain can be divided into three phases; from the middle of June till the middle of October it is exceedingly unpleasant, though'the actual temperature is not very high, when compared wjth other places in the Middle East, rarely exceeding 103° on the coast and 110 in the centre of the island, yet the humidity during these months is excessive and frequently exceeds 90°. From mid-October till about the middle of February the weather is very pleasant and often cold though frosts are unknown. Thick clothes are necessary at this time of the year and fires are needed in the houses. The other four months of the year are agreeable. During the second half of May and the first half of June there is usually a cool north wind. The annual rainfall is about 2-g- inches, rain usually occurs in December and January. The cultivation in Bahrain, which is mostly date palms, depends upon fresh water springs and irrigation channels for its water supply. 4. HOUSEHOLD. Free housing, i*e. quarters for single men, or an allowance in lieu thereof, if quarters are not available, is provided by the Bahrain Government. Officials of the State reside in Manama, a town on the northern coast of the main island which is the capital and commercial centre of Bahrain. The main island, which is about the size of the Isle of Wight is connected at Manama Arif''37 . . 2 . by a causeway to the adjacent island of Muharraq on which the aerodrome is situated. Flying boats anchor off Manama and the anchorage for B. I. steamers is opposite the town. Houses are stone buildings usually built in the tor* of flats with offices on the ground floor and residences above. Accommodation for married officers is limited. Electric light, fans and refrigerators are installed in the houses, the occupants paying for the current consumed and for the lamps. Furniture is provided but not curtains, carpets, crockery, cooking utensils, plate or linen. It is inadvisable and unnecessary to incur the expenditure of bringing out any heavy furniture but the addition of «ishi«ns, curtains and a rug or two to put on the cement floors, and personal eftects, make the house more comfortable. In normal times china, cooking utensils etc. could be purchased in Bahrain but at present (1945) there is a shortag of these things in the shops. It is advisable to bring sheets, towels table mats and kitchen and pantry cloths. The glass and china obtaruiable in the bazaar is of poor quality and if some can be sent from England it is Plate, cutlery and cooking utensils are not always obtainable in the shops. 5. DRESS. * Men - Summer. Shirts, slacks or shorts and sun helmets are worn and light tropical suits in the summer. In the evening white open-neck short sleeved shirts, white slacks, black socks, evening shees and black cummerbunds during the hot weather. On official occasions, for dinner, a white jacket and a white soft shirt with a black tie is neeessaiy. Aertex or cellular day shirts are the most suitable and cellular vests are useful, not for wamth hut far absorbing sweat. Silk is unsuitable in the very hot weather, it becomes damp and creases. Light brown l« a tner or suede Sees or sandals are usually worn. Some can be bought ready made or they can be made by local shoe makers. It is usually possible to buy material for shirts and suits in the bazaar. If pyjamas are worn they should be cotton many people prefer to use 'bungis' waist cloths, made of locally wtren coUo^tSSl. Uniform is not warn by officials of the Government of Bahrain. Winter. In the cold weather ordinary tweed suits are worn or flannel trousers and sports coats,and dinner jackets are used in the evening. It is cold enough for pullovers and overcoats especially after sunset. • Women - Winter . In the cold season women require the type of clothing which i* worn in England in April and May with the addition of a really warm coat , some after- noonfrocks Ld a few dinner frocks. Shoes are best taken from England as those on sale in the bazaar are not good. Sun helmets are scarcely worn and can be bought in the bazaar. Mosquito boots are never worn. Summer. * Washing frocks, preferably cotton, are the best wear ^ the veiyhot weather aslinen or silk are unsuitable when the temperature is high and it H huSd li^ht frocks are usually worn froa April to early December one or two washing^ evening frocks are useful Hats are rarelywornbuton^ome occasions, such as official parties, a hat is required. In noraal times cotton dress materials can be bought locally. ciothes are Washed by^ '•dhobis', washermen, who keep them for a week. On the whole they wash clothes quite well. 6. MEDICAL. Officials cf the Bahrain Government and their wives and children are given free medical treatment by the State Medical Officers. There is a British /Medicalmmm Medical Officer and a Lady Medical Officer. This privilege does not cover Maternity cases for which arrangements have to be made with the medical authorities. There is not at present a Nursing Horae, for Europeans though this project is under consideration. There are private wards in the men's part of the State Hospital. There are practically no poisonous insects or snakes in Bahrain and no fleas, sandflies; or white ants*o Owing to anti malaria measures carried dot by the Medical Department there are few mosqviitoes in the town of Manama. All houses are not provided with mosquito netting and in the houses on the sea front no mosquito nets are required. Vaccination and T.A.B. innoculations are necessary before departure from England; smallpox is endemic and there have been occasional cases of typhoid. TThen engaging a servant it should be ascertained that he has been vaccinated. There is now no local prejudice against vaccination, Care should be taken in the house that vessels containing water are emptied every day to prevent mosquitoes breeding. ; c /. . * * &lt; *v \ 3 l : ■ CT ' * • f V • . - Probably the most trying affliction during the summer is Prickly Heat, an irritating rash on the skin which is due to the humidity and sweat. Men can, to a certain extent, avoid this by allowing their bodies to become thwooughly sunburned. This has to be done carefully and by degrees. Prickly Heat is sometimes liable to develop into boils. It can be treated fairly successfully by various powders and ointments. Coloured spectacles are worn in the summer by most Europeans, There is a Syrian dentist in Manama trained at the American University of Beyrout. 7. SERVANTS •' Local servants perform domestic duties more or less adequately and are less expensive and usually mnre satisfactory than foreign servants, by which is meant Indians. It may be said, generally, that Europeans get the servants they deserve. If trouble is taken to train entirely raw local boys they become excellent servants. Most cooks and housebays are of Persian origin. No servants should be employed without previous reference to the police. The requirements of a single man or a married couple can be supplied by either one or two servants. Wages have risen sharply during the war, cooks are paid from Rs. 65 /- to Rs. 80/- p.m., houseboys from Rs, 50/- to Rs. 70/- varying according to their accomplishments. Goanese cooks, from India, are a luxury; they demand not less than Rs. 100/- p.za. and moreover they expect to be provided with a cook's boy to accompany them when shopping. No servants are provided with food but the employer is expected to get them clothes to wear when on duty. In most cases they live out, in their own homes in the town. No women servants are employed. As the servants are all Moslems the question of caste does not occur. 8. DRINK. f : • • v. Bahrain is a Moslem State, and officially 'dry' but Europeans are allowed to import or purchase a limited amount of liquor on a special permit. Liquor is sold by the firm of Gray Mackenzie, the shipping agents. Prices, compared to England and adjoining countries in the East, are cheap as the customs duty is only lf$. It is essential that liquor should be kept under lock and key as spirits fetch high prices in 'Che bazaar. Bahrain subjects found in possession of liquor are liable to severe punishment in the local courts. 9. RECREATIONS * There is no shooting in Bahrain and the imp or* of arms and ammunition is prohibited. The import of dogs is prohibited unless the owner can produce a certificate from a qualified veterinary surgeon to the effect that the animal has been inocculated with anti-rabies vaccine. Rabies is unknown in Bahrain though very prevalent in neighbouring countries. Membership of the Gy^chana Club enables members to use the golf course, tennis courts and bathing pool.' There is good sea bathing at places on the coast and sea /fishing.4» 38 tishing, j. 1 resli v»auer pooxs abound. There is no public libraiy in Bahrain suid it is advisable to place an order with a newsagent for periodicals. Air mail letters take about ten days from England, newspapers take about six weeks. 10. CHURCHES. There is a Mission church of the Dutch Reformed Church of ‘uaerica in Manaaaa and also a Catholic Church T/ith a resident Priest. Anglican services are held occasionally and a rjroocct for building an Anglican Church is under way. There is a building, used for Anglican and other services, at Awali the headquarters of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, about 12 miles from Manama in the centre of the island. Service chaplains frequently visit Bahrain to attend to the needs of the Naval Base, which is situated about three miles froa Manama ?nd tiie R.A.k. who are stationed on Ruliarraq Island. 11. LANGUAGE. The -_'l‘ a ^ guage ^ Baiirain is Arabic but in the towns a good deal of Persian and^ some Hindustaiii is spoken. kost of the sliopkeepers speak some English. It is essential that all Europeans in the service «f the Bahrain Government should acquire a knowledge of Arabic. Local teachers are available for giving lessons in Arabic. The best Arabic book for use in Bahrain is Van Ess'* Spoken Arabic of Mesopotamia.. The only book which deals exclusively with the Persian Gulf is A.T. Wilsons Persian Gulf, now out of print. 12. O FFICE HOURS. Office hours vary considerably according to duties. In general, offices are open trcm 8 a.m. till 2 p.m. Some offices open later in the morning and also in the afternoon. There is a telephone system in Bahrain and automatic telephones are shortly to be installed. There is no local postal service. There are two banks in Bahrain, tiie Eastern Bank and the Imperial Bank of Iran. The former fulfils many of the Services af Government Treasury. The Arabic Calendar is used by the Bahrain Government; the Arabic year is about ten days shorter than tiie Gregorian, year. Moslem Holidays are kept. Offices close on Friday, not on Sunday. 13. LEAVE. There is no Mil station close to Bahrain where people can go for a change gi air. If home leave is not taken the nearest cool stations are the Lebanon Mountains.in Syria, cu ni.ll stations in India. These places can be reached by air or by steaoer and train but fares are at present extremely high and steamer services are uncertain. Uf. FOOD. It is difficult under the present changing conditions to give reliable information about food supplies. At the time of writing, 1945 , the prices of most foodstuffs are controlled by the Government and cereals, including flour wheat and barley, and sugar are rationed at the scale of 20 lbs cf cereals and’ 3 lbs. of sugar per head per month. Meat, consisting of beef and mutton is plentiful, cf better quality than in neighbouring countries and a little cheaper than in England. Excellent fish of many different kinds is available throughout the year. Although Bahrain is the centre of the pearl industry oysters are not obtainable as those found are not edible. There is very little fruit apart from melons and fresh dates in the summer. In the winter European vegetables are grown and in the summer there are local vegetables of rather a dull type on sale in the markets. Poultry is expensive, eggs are about half the size of European eggs. Milk, if the cows are well fed, is extremely good and fresh butter can be made from it, but the great increase in the demand for milk has caused many of the cattle owners to water the milk. In normal times the shops stocked large supplies of tinned goods of all descriptions from Europe, America and India but owing to the war stocks of tinned goods have almost disappeared. Cooking is done mainly on oil stoves. Hot water is not laid on in most of the Government houses. / 15 .15. MISCEILAKEOUS. . . There is no income tax in Bahrain. The only form of taxation to whicK officials of the Government are liable is customs duty upon goods imported s ^•!^ / c£ 0 £$f^ss«ftia3?tS§ca 3 E , S ® n 811 foodstuffs and necessities, ‘ 10^/on liquor and tobacdo. Worn personal effects are not liable for customs duties. Cigarettes and tobacco are cheap and ali/rays available in the bazaar. The local water is slightly brackish, but not unwholesome. Distilled water can be purchased locally. A scheme for a town water supply for Manama is under consideration; this will include a distilling plant. t sf? v. . Baiirain can be z*eached from the United Kingdom in two days by air. by sea via India, or by sea to Egypt and on by car and train to Basra and thence by sea or air. Air passengers are not allowed more than 44 lbs. of baggage.The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited 11, BircHI n Lan e, London, e.c.3. 23rd December, 1938 Dear Mr. Gibson, Thank you for your letter P.Z.8299/38 of the 22nd December concerning the article on Bahrein in 'The American Magazine' for January 1939.

I would direct your attention to the article it contains by Jerome Beatty, entitled 'Is John Bull’s Face Red'. Mr. Beatty is the gentleman who endeavoured to get to Bahrein in the early part of this year but the Company prevented his doing so because they did not want the publicity likely to arise from the efforts of a person of his description. He had announced his intention of 'writing up' Bahrein for a quite reputable magazine called 'Reader’s Digest.' Why the article did not appear in the Reader’s Digest, I do not know. The present article seems to be nothing more than rather poor journalese. As some important facts are omitted from the story, I would not be inclined to take it at all seriously: to do so might be giving publicity to the article v/hich will benefit no body but the magazine and the writer. fl* Utcr An advance copy of the article was sent to my Company iluf ; hi* sw a*, in San BTancisco b y the magazine peop le, they took immediate action tuN/1 [?***, Copy bot' * sod-to prevent it appearing but it was already in print: in other fe» tUcu. by flu. r ZiS..mm- 2 - words, the advance copy was sent to then too late to enable them to do anything effective in the way of preventing its appearance. Yours, si J.P.Gibson Esq.., India Office, Whitehall, S.y/.l, Enel.32 .'V venturous Major Frank Holmes couldn’t convince Great Britain he had located one of the world’s richest oil fields Our world-traveling reporter exposes an embarrassing British secret—how Americans beat them to a faraway island of oil ruled by an Arab sheik BY JEROM i E BEJITTY FACE HALFWAY down the Persian ^ 'JN - Gulf, on the opposite side of the world from San Francisco, thirty miles from the east coast of Arabia, is the Island of Bahrein, a slab of desert, boiling in heat and humidity. It is an independent Arab state, protected by the British government, which would like it very much if you would stop read' ing this article right now. On the sand in the middle of Bahrein is a neat, white ultramodern city which cost $25,000,000 to build and which im eludes 50 oil wells and a $12,000,000 re' finery. There are homes, a hospital, clubs, a school, a movie theater, a beauty parlor, and a commissary, all amcondi' tioned and full of electric gadgets, from kitchen ranges to curling irons. It has a population of more than 500 American and British men, women, and children. In date'Stick huts near by live several thousand native workmen. It is one of the world’s great oil fields and, except in the oil trade, a closely guarded secret. It was discovered and built up by the Standard Oil Company of California, which produces the oil. The Texas Corporation sells it, chiefly in British territories in Africa, Asia, and Australasia. The Americans’ overlord is His High' ness Sheik Sir Hamad bin Isa A1 Khali' fah, Ruler of Bahrein. A few years ago he rode a camel when he wanted to sur vey his domain and his 60,000 sun-baked subjects. Much of his income depended upon Bahrein’s pearl-diving fleet, which is hard up because of the competition of Japanese cultured pearls. Now his share of the oil brings him plenty rupees and he doesn’t have to worry over the low price of pearls, and tours his island (27 miles long and 10 miles wide) in one of his dozen expensive motorcars, the fastest of which he often uses to chase gazelles over the flat desert south of the oil wells. He is pretty much under the thumb of the British—he has given them a naval base there—but he certainly does like those Americans!MUHARRAQ IS 'rrymM/ fa^ZCC OI L WELLSt /4a (j&lt;X Cl (' i^l^S y' L*.

They had the whole business within their reach but put too much faith in their surveyors and an encyclo pedia, which states confidently, “Oil and asphalt shows occur in Kuwait and Bahrein, but the prospect of oil being found in those territories in adequate quantities is slender.” The Americans, to whom they re linquished what they thought was a worthless concession, are now refining 30,000 barrels a day and are sure the island can produce 100,000 a day with out grunting. The Texas Corporation has announced to its stockholders that Bahrein oil will show a profit of $8,000,000 for 1938. The British government has been quite successful in keeping from the British people the embarrassing facts about Bahrein. Tourists never go near the place. British officials there are said to write or censor all the news that goes out. The British political agent sits at the right hand of the sheik, and writers who ask for a visa are politely and firmly asked to withdraw their request.

ALAMAR % JML The mysterious island combines ancient Arabian traditions with the latest oil-re fining technique some mysterious influence was brought to bear so that she never wrote a line about Bahrein. Employees of the oil company are forbidden to write or talk for publication. American officials of the company, who are dependent upon the British for co-operation there and in British markets, won’t talk. I got in and out before anybody caught me. The only time the secret threatened to be exposed was (Continued on page 110)59 no (Continued from page 33) in 1934, when, in the House of Commons, Mr. Gordon R. Hall Caine demanded an explanation as to why Americans were tak' ing the oil out of a British-protected state, and Sir John Simon confessed, “The Bahrein oil concession was originally ac quired by a British syndicate, and was subsequently transferred to United States interests by them. The British syndicate who first acquired the concession have stated that before they transferred it to the United States they endeavoured unsuccess fully to attract possible British concession aires.” And Sir John began quickly to talk about conditions in Manchukuo. The incident was noted only in British oil-trade publications. One said sharply, “Here, on territory with British associa tions, was a chance for our oil patriots to score. The instance is one more proof that Britain has no oil policy worth the name.” r 'PHE policy of England’s Ind ia Offic e, which has charge of politicsTfrtfjff^r- sian Gulf, is to keep out of the small amount of news that gets out of Bahrein any men tion of the fact that it is an American con cession. It doesn’t go so far as to make misstatements or say that the British own the oil wells, but it does approve articles which tell about the great number of British who are working there. The whole affair—a story of amazing co incidence, good luck for Americans, bad judgment by British—was started by Major Frank Holmes, a hearty New Zea lander who for years has been a man-about- the-world, ready to promote any project— mostly gold and copper mines—that might make him a reasonable profit. He lives now in Kuwait, at the head of the Persian Gulf, where—the encyclopedia to the con trary notwithstanding—a driller from Texas struck oil last May, opening what may be another big field, controlled by America’s Gulf Oil Corporation and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The Bahrein strike gave the Americans a chance to get a foot in the door in British-protected ter ritory. Major Holmes, like others concerned in THE the deal, won’t talk for publication, for he needs the friendship of British officials. But in Iraq and Iran and up and down the Gulf, in territory that is rapidly becoming of major importance to the oil industry, you find oil men who know the entire story. I English oil men, particularly, with good sportsmanship and many chuckles, love to tell how their bigwigs in London missed the boat. Their admiration for the skill and enterprise of Americans is tremendous. Oil in huge quantities was discovered in southern Persia, now Iran, by the British about twenty-five years ago. All the near-by rulers, most of them in need of money, began to wonder if there wasn’t oil in their countries, too. I bn Sa’ud, ruler of Arabia, ally of the Sheik of Bahrein, was one of those. I n 1922 he sent a representa tive to London to try to get the British to drill in Arabia. The representative made the rounds, but nobody was interested. Their geologists had told them there was no oil in that part of Arabia^ Just as the Arab envoy was about to re turn, defeated, he was introduced to Major Holmes, who up to that moment had no thought of promoting oil anywhere. He became interested, poked around in books and reports, guessed that Bahrein looked promising, and went there. It was an unpropitious moment. The Sheik had no interest in oil. He wanted water, and wanted it quick. All of Bahrein’s drinking water was being blown out to sea. Although Arabs had lived there for sev eral thousand years and Europeans had been trading there for eighty years, there was no fresh water on Bahrein or the adjacent little island of Muharraq. But offshore, in the sea, were springs of sweet water, and the Arabs would go out in boats and dip it out. Whenever storms came the sweet water would be mixed with the salt before Arabs in storm-tossed boats could get it. There had been a long series of storms, and the Sheik was sending dhows to the mainland in a frantic effort to get water for his subjects. Adapting himself instantly to the situa tion, Holmes turned from oil promoter to water promoter. He guessed that if there was sweet water in the sea, there must be plenty underground on the island. “I’ll drill a well on each island,” he told the Sheik. “If I find good drinking water, you pay me $15,000 for each well and talk to me about an oil concession. If I fail, it costs you nothing.” The Sheik agreed. Holmes shipped in drilling machinery and a water expert, and within two months had 2 wells of sweet water, a contract to drill 20 more at a nice profit—and the oil concession. I N 1892 the Sheik of Bahrein had agreed with the British not to “cede, sell, or mort gage or otherwise give for occupation any part of his territory save to the British government.” That meant that Major Holmes could sell his concession only to the British, unless they waived their rights. Major Holmes employed five of the best geologists in Europe, and they examined Bahrein. One said there was a fair pros pect that oil would be found in paying quantities; the others advised against drill ing. But Holmes wasn’t discouraged. For six years he went from office to office AMERICAN MAGAZINE in London trying to get the government and the oil barons to take a chance on Bahrein. He admitted it was a long shot. He had one favorable report and wanted them to bet on that. They weren’t inter ested. He tried to interest small English capitalists. “If there was oil,” they said, “the big companies would have been in there years ago.” “ Holmes was the worst nuisance in Lon- / don,” an Englishman told me. “ People/V ran when they saw him coming.” He groaned, “And to think, he had papers in his pocket worth millions!” At last Holmes asked if the British would waive their treaty rights and permit him to try to interest American capital. They gave him a quick answer: If any American was so insane as to waste money in Bah rein, the British didn’t mind. T_JOLMES went to the Gulf Oil Corpora- tion, Andrew W. Mellon’s company, in Pittsburgh. Mr. Mellon was Secretary of the Treasury. Gulf was interested enough to send one of its own geologists, R. O. Rhodes, to Bahrein. His report filled only half a page. It said there were excellent prospects of finding oil, and on a map he marked two spots for the first test wells. Gulf got ready to drill. Suddenly Holmes received word the deal was off. Mr. Mellon was about to be made Ambassador to England. If Gulf hit oil in Bahrein there would be political complica tions, and he was getting rid of all business that might touch politics. The Gulf com pany, however, said it would help Holmes make a deal with another company. “ Let me try again to put this through in England,” Holmes said. He returned to London, made the rounds again, this time pointing out that an American geologist had made a favorable report, that an American company would drill if the Brit ish didn’t. The British doggedly said there was no oil in Bahrein. Holmes returned to America. Gulf sold its share in the concession to Standard of California for $50,000. They hit oil at 2,008 feet in June, 1932. A story you hear in the Persian Gulf runs to the effect that Standard of California had decided to take a chance on a 2,000- foot well, that when drillers reached the 2,000-foot level they cabled San Francisco that it was a dry hole, and the British on Bahrein held a big celebration. San Fran cisco cabled back, “Drill till your money runs out and then come home.” They had enough money to go 25 feet farther. Eight feet past the 2,000-foot mark they hit it. . . . It’s a good story, but Standard officials deny it. Bahrein has no deep-water port, and from the spot where the little British India boat anchors it is a three-mile ride in a native motorboat to the dock and the chief town of Manama. In this town are about 20,000 Arabs, a few British, and an Ameri can mission and hospital. Alongshore are two-story buildings, back of them a few hundred Arab houses, then hundreds of huts and the desert. The desert is crossed by an asphalt road built by the oil com pany to its development ten miles away. On the trip you pass the Bahrein laundry —a score of natives in a stream, whanging the clothes on stones to beat out the dirt.Q? 60 JANUARY 1939 Your car dodges camels, donkeys, sheep, goats, and children. You go through acres of huge prehistoric burial mounds. Suddenly, like a mirage reflected all the way from Oklahoma City, loom the huge refinery, the tall stacks, the immense tanks. The oil wells are far beyond. You pass orderly rows of date-stick huts, each one numbered. You reach the modern town, filled with busses, motorcars, and trucks, dark men in native dress and blond, sun burned men in shorts and topees and shirts invariably open at the throat. You are not likely to see any of the 85 women and 25 children until evening, when they all start for the theater or swimming pool. I was told about a veteran oil man who had worked in Central America, Egypt, and Iran and who, one day in Bahrein, wiped his dripping brow, dropped ex hausted on his bed, and moaned, “Why in hell can’t they ever strike oil in Paris?” B AHREIN is sixteen days by air and boat from California, a month by train and boat. Imperial Airways has made it a regular stop on the London-India route, and when construction began the company flew about 300 English and American en gineers and skilled laborers there to direct the natives. There was nothing on the island the com pany could use but oil, sand, stone, camels, donkeys, and Arabic-speaking natives. The company engineers and housing ex perts in San Francisco have shipped every thing from toothpaste and canned corn to concrete mixers and dynamos. A year and a half after oil was found, the first shipload of supplies arrived. The cargo was carried ashore on barges and dhows, except the big tanks, which were floated in. Side by side, Arabs, Americans, British, camels, donkeys, tractors, trucks, and steam rollers sweated and groaned. In 105 days the first cargo of crude oil gushed through a pipe line into the ship at the mooring three miles offshore. Everybody took a good rest except the claim adjuster, who found his hands full quieting with rupees infuriated fishermen who said the oil dripping into the water had made all the fish run out to sea. To keep the natives’ good will was important. They cabled San Francisco for gadgets, and in two months the pipe line was fixed so that not a drop of oil went into the sea. Construction has never ended. Only last spring were housing plans completed, with air conditioning in the last of the 71 houses and bachelor apartments. Now it is dis covered that the 250-seat movie theater is too small, and a new one is being started. There are tennis courts, a golf course, cricket and soccer fields, free outboard motorboats and sailboats. The services of doctor and dentist are free. Food and lodging are furnished to the “Europeans,” as all who are not natives are called in that part of the country. American tobacco and English liquor are cheaper than in the United States. A long leave is granted every three years, a short one in the summer. Realizing that this oil field, which it wouldn’t sell for $100,000,000, was dropped into its lap, the oil company has spared no expense to keep everybody happy, the British, the employees, the natives. It would be a paradise except for the isolation and the heat. At first, in exchange for complete co operation, the company promised the Brit ish that as soon as men could be trained, 90 per cent of the European employees would be British. Thus the government can, in part, save its face and eventually, perhaps, give the impression that Bahrein is a British development. W ITHIN a year only two or three Americans, top executives, will be there. It turns out that the company couldn’t keep Americans if it wanted to. Air conditioning, electric refrigerators, and country-club amusements are old stuff to them. They want to get out of the heat and back to their friends. The British love it. A young Englishman at Bahrein told me, “I’m going to ask for a renewal of my con tract .when my three years are up. The heat is bad, but I’m living like an English millionaire. I had to come to an Arab desert to get air conditioning and plenty of ice and a tile bathroom.” The situation is dripping with political poison for the British. It is tremendously important that they keep face with the 111 Arabs and it is difficult for them to explain why Americans could find oil where the English said there wasn’t any. England, for safety, must boss the Per sian Gulf, for that’s a short route to India. It must have the friendship of the Arabs, who could cause a great deal of trouble if they joined the enemy in a war. England needs naval and air bases in that country. With the completion within a year of rail road lines in Iraq and Turkey and the installation of fast British ships in the Gulf, the Suez Canal route will have a real com petitor. Passengers will be able to go from London to Bombay in less than ten days. England must be in a position to defend that route, and an American oil company in the middle of it complicates things. B RITAIN’S sloops have done a good job of chasing pirates and slavers out of the Gulf, its political agents work hard to keep the Arabs happy, and when sultans and sheiks visit London they are given a high old time. But, when the sheiks make a deal for oil now, they want the Americans in on it. Across the Gulf is Iran (Persia), which doesn’t like the way England has taken charge of the Gulf. In 1925, smelling oil, Iran made a claim to the League of Nations that the Gulf was “the private waters of Persia” and that Bahrein belonged to Iran. The League rejected the claim, but Iran still sulks about it and won’t play post office with the British. Letters from Bahrein will not be delivered in Iran unless they have Iranian stamps on them. Pass port visas for Bahrein are granted by the British, and if you have one you can’t enter Iran except on special permit, for in recognizing Britain’s “unlawful” protec torate of Bahrein you stamp yourself, in Persian eyes, as an undesirable citizen. In a few years there will no longer be big Fourth of July celebrations on Bahrein and no longer will there be such terrific compli cations as exist today when Texans and cockneys, both thinking they speak pure English, fail utterly to understand each other. The whole business will be run by the British. But the Americans won’t care. They want no credit. They’re satisfied with the profit from the oil.# IITDIA OFFICE, wrrEHAu,, s.w,i* 15th November, 1938* Dear Belgrave, Very many thanks for your letter of the 1st November and for the article from the Frankfurter Zeitung on the subject of Bahrein. It must be highly satisfactory for you to knou that you are given full credit for the paradise existence in Bahrein, but it is a moving picture to think of you standing in your strictly dry preserve and gating ulth longing eyes at the land flowing with cocktails and whisky only 25 kilometres away. I had a long talk with Thornburg, who gave me a full explanation of the objections to dividing up the Unallotted Area from the point of view of his Company. It came as rather a surprise to us to find that the Sheikh had swung round so very decidedly to the side of Bapco. Thornburg seemed to me to be a very pleasant fellow and I was rather favourably impressed with him. C.

M.B, n It is quite impossible that you should be able to coae to Bahrain, English people will not allow any one to enter” This assurance is given to those arriving in Baghdad by Gera&amp;ns, Swiss and ^rabs. It is equally difficult to g^t to Kuwait. it is even difficult for diplomats of States that are friendly to England to obtain permission. Furthermore dreadful things are reported about Bahrain: there is no hotel, there is no possibility of finding suitable accomodation except with’dirty ^rabs 1 , no sweet water, a dampish heat in comparison with which the dry heat of Baghdad is like high mountain air. If, after such narrations, a permit to enter is put before the British Legation by the 'Political Agent” in Bahrain, 'provided that it can be proved that a suitable accomodation can be found”, the first distrustful thought comes up:- ”0h! disguised form of refusal: because of course there is no possi bility of finding accomodation”• But see, the friendly English Consulate Official asks whether it would not be possible to stay over night with the ^tuaericam Missionary, ana suggests sosuing a telegram to the '^uviser of the Bahrain Government”.

The events *ith the Shaikh of iohaa^erah # in the midale of the twenties, was only a beginning. It 3ho$»s the world at the irersian Gulf, that the ohah was determined to reconstitute the full sovereignty of the Iran State. The second stage is 1931 that, the ’Imperial ^ir Mails’* were pro hibited to fly over the Iranian coast. The third followed in «.pril 1935: the 'voluntary* removal of the English M&amp;v&amp;l support point from Head jam and lias id u on the Iranian side to Bahrain. By this opportunity Sir urnold lilson, the High Uomissioner In Baghdad, later Director of the Anglo Iranian Oil Go., in ib&amp;d&amp;n, put some unpleasant questions to the foreign Minister, Sir John Simon: 'Has the British sovereignty which was exercised over a part of the island Basidu, now been officially beem- withdrawn? Is it not a fact that there the British flag had flown for over 100 years: that repeatedly this place has been aeclured as a British territory: and has not this attitude been frequently put forward before the Iranian government? n Sir John oimon did not know what better answer to give than, 'The local climatic conditions were not healthy, ana the place was not British territory. His Majesty 1 * Government has recently deciaed that their best interests would be served in the Persian Gulf by transferring the station to Bahrain on the. Arabian side of the Gulf.'

The case was put before the League of Nations. England had to put a Million sterling on the table, increase the payments to the Iranian government from 16 to 28jt of the net profit, a tribute of 9 pence on each ton of raw oil produced had to be conceded. This arrangement was frequently looked upon as a defeat for England. Eroa the standpoint of &amp; gradual clearing of Iran from British influence, English however had maintained its position but with financial sacrifices. But what are financial sacrifices when the supply to the English fleet in case of war are concerned? &amp;ith respect to abadan the dispute between Irak and Iran over SUlLiTT-LL-iJLiB is so important for London, although it does not feouch England officially in any way. ith the Irak-Iranian agreement of 1937 the territorial disputes have been settled. But the questions so important for England as regards shipping and water control still await to be settled. for the present the tide flows of the yellow Tigris and Euphrates which touch itbaci&amp;n coast are still pure Irak, ^badan is an alluvial land island, something «gggrtnrag like a lagoon end the narrow watercourse which separatesseparates the island from the sain land, is not navigable. Thus the Iranian ships have for the present no possibility to cose near to the hunareas of tanks and pipe lines, the chimneys and iron towers of the town. if or years Iran demands the middle of ^oh&amp;tt-sl~&gt;o‘&amp;b as boundary. On the basis of the agreement of 1937 discussions are to take place as to this point and as to the setting up a river commission. The great question is: will the river commission be simply Irak-lr&amp;n, or will a third party be brought in as arbiter? -nd if a third party will it be a neutral or an Englishman? All dritish energy is concentrated toaay on the ra-abian siae of the Gulf. Overnight Pirate dhaikhs have become oil and air Shaikhs. The build* ing of the new air line starts 1931 with the forced retreat of the Iranian side. hamrah, Bahrain, Schardjah are principal stations.

Bahrain lies immediately in front of the Arabian % coast in its own large bay, but it also lies between ,urabi&amp; and Iran. In the year 1937 Iran started inin -aneve; to protect against the British eoverei^ty* It dates its clais baok to its forser possession of Bahrain in the ISta oentury* The English thesis however reads: in the 18th oentury an ancestor of the present Bh&amp;ikh had vanquished from the iirabian seinland tiie last shaikh who had been uncar Iran supremacy. The family reigned independently for 150 years, until she entered into the agreement of friendship and protectorate with hnglaad whicii exists today. The League o: Nations accepts the protest of Iran without however taking any note of the question. In the first years the protests perhaps were more of a theoretical nature * who was interested in this flat deserted group of islands with its dreadful climate? wince the finding of oil Bahrain is important to both sides.

Beside the old generation, which had spent its life on the Qalf, which had sworn against the Gulf and also loved it, a new generation has appeared which lives in the restless atmosphere of oil. They are the petroleum engineers, young .imericans and young Englishmen. They have contracts for eighteen months, for two or three years. The Gulf does not interest them. It is a short station on the way, which leads from California to Mexico, East Indies, Bahrain and Texas.

Battle for the distribution market. «e pressed to the refinery. A refinery can only be understood by an expert and enjoyed by him. Whereas the refinery of the Anglo-Iracdan in Abadan is the largest in the world, the one in Bahrain the most moaern. here the company has spared less than at the camp. The very latest methods have been employed. Even two Germans were allowed for a few months to visit the mysterious ground of the island, namely to erect machines which are only constructed in Germany. The refinery has only been built two years ago. The English construction engineer on board said disapprovingly that it was built far too quickly. During the first year tbs crude oil was flowing over the narrow arm of the sea to Sitrs, the third of the Bahrain islands, and into the sea upto a t nk buoy. Today all oil products.« -15- proaucta, nfith the exception of librie&amp;ting oil, are conducted in several tubas to Sitra; benzine of various kinds, diesel oil, heating oil, petro leum. To this must be added coke, gas and asphalt production for own use. Before the decision was come to build a refinery a secret oil conference was held in Hew York in October &amp;nd Hoveaber 1935. Hot much got into the hands of the press; participators besides the Californian standard Oil, the parent company of the 'Bupeo* (Bahrain Petroleum Co) the *»nglo - Iranian the “'hall Union Oil, the whell Transport and the standard Oil of Kew Jersey. The theme of the oon- ferenoe: where and through whoa is the Bahrain oil b lag distributed? The Qalifornian wil was not in possession of its own Transport and Distri bution organisation. The conditions of the Compet ing firms were evidently not acceptable. Instead of agreeing with the three biggest ones, the Cali fornia Oil decided to make a pact with their worst competitor, the Texas Oil Co. Out of tf Bupco ,,, became in 1938 'Caltex* (California and Texas Gil Co). The refinery was constructed at a cost of 12 million dollars and already during building operations warn being extended. last of Cuez Canal thereby a new mightV oil competitor has coma into existence. lor the year 1937 the company reports a net profit of 4 million dollars with a daily pro duction of 25000 barrels. In the year 1936 the expected net profit will he about 8 million dollars.Vny aaerioann &gt;ma pot Kagliahaan? oood knowledge may be gained as to the oil and boring seorets on the Arabian ooaet on a tour through the Gulf* The principal secret however remains un solved; why are the Americans boring and not the Englishmen on this island for the safety of which . England has spent so much money? and thought and diplo macy? -nil ~*t;liah preas reports about Bahrain oil pass over this point.in a shamefaced manner. The engineers and geologists show innocent faces and know nothing. ^ho finds first grinds first f ‘ they murmur laughingly. But if you reply to them : 'but the first who found was an Englishman, Aujor Holmes, the atm who is now working in the Muscat district' Major holmes offered tbs Bahrain concession to the idglo Iranian. *Vhy aid they not take it over? Their faces become somewhat puzzled. The -anglo-Iranian will probably not have believed in a real oil existence, an engineer replies. This does not sound very convincing, as the British -admiralty did not wish anything more keenly than to obtain oil from a territory su bjeot to England. But to the first question a second one can be added Why are nothing but young English engineers employed and taught in the American refineries until there is a v,uota of 70 Englishmen of all higher employees. The two first questions lead to a third question. jre there secret agreements in existence between Ebglishnen and Americans? The foreign Office could not have the desire to subject the ^nglo Iranian to further burdens, in viewvia* of the fact that bafore the League of Nations their existence had to be fought for. The taking over of a oonces&amp;ion on an island in the Persian Gulf t to vhioh Iran puts forward a claim, would have aeant such a burden. The uaerioans on the other hand are learning from year to year ag in that n friendly rr economic imperialism in an Utopia. It is not difficult to procure concessions in foreign countries against good dollars. To continue holding them without the help of arms, when they have once become productive, sometimes proves to be impossible. The /Americans are becoming careful. Consequences mere drawn in the case of Mexico through the giving notice of the nerican oil concession in hordestiran only a few weeks ago. In Bahrain the case is much more pleasant. Bahrain is the most important point of the British defence line between Basrah and India, safeguarded by British ships air lines. Naturalisa tion tendencies do not exist. England is less after the profit on oil than the security of the Gulf, should however the English, in case of war, require the Bahrain oil, thay^they woula J&amp;ux it. Thus in all quietness without the knowledge and interference of the nmerio&amp;n Isolationists the first step is being made in Bahrain for the cooperative working of the .agio-taxons, which both governments are striving for and in which the border line between economic and military politics is difficult to define. ~4Kl even if the Ibglish prefer the spicy cooking of their Hindoo - Portuguese cooks to the wmerioan - Chinese camp cooking, and even if the living together of ^.aerioan and English in the camps is not always harmonious, It is nevertheless clear that the workingNo. 1036.

' T z., t i ~y c 102Copy * (E 1031/13/91). 146/1/38. itish Embassy, Cairo. Sth February, 1938. My dear Lacy, Many thanks for your letter No.E 7047/781/ 91 of the 16th December making enquiries about an article in the Cairo paper 'Al Shabab”. In spite of very careful investigation it has proved impossible to discover the name of the author of the article in question. Theeditor of this paper is extremely careful not to divulge even to members of his own staff the origin of the numerous articles of this nature which appear in his journal. There is little doubt, however, that your theory that it came from the pen of some disgruntled Bahraini is correct. The 'Shabab” was founded in 1936 by one Mahmoud Azmi, a very able journalist, to ventilate the Arab cause. When he himself was given an appointment as professor of political economy at the University in Baghdad he ceded the rights of editorship to Mohamed Ali Taher whilst retaining himself the nominal ownership. Mohamed Ali Taher is, as you know, the notorious Palestinian agitator, the president of the Syro-Palestine committee in Cairo. Since he took over the 'Shabab” it has become the depository of all persons with grievances against British administration in Palestine, Aden, the Persian Gulf, etc. and was recently excluded from Palestine for an outrageous article on the alleged misconduct of certain British soldiers in that country. H.L. Baggally, Esq. , Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. It/ copy se;'t air mail105 It is a weekly paper with a circulation of about 500 in Egypt and about 2,500 in the Arab world, and is believed to be a source of considerable annoyance in all countries under British administration where it is allowed to penetrate* It is reported that since its exclusion from Palestine copies of this paper have been sent under sealed envelope addressed to individual subscribers, and may this have eluded the press censorship* In the event of its being banned in other countries the same method would doubtless be employed* Mohamed Ali Taher is, as you are aware, reputed to be in close touch with the Emir Shakib Aralan, who is financed by the Italians* I am sending a copy of this letter to the Chancery at Bushire, and also to Major Tweedy, the Director of Information at Jerusalem* Yours ever, (Sgd. ) J.C*Sterndale Bennett*■ oA j Draft Paper 106 P.Z.1549/38 Department.

I now enclose a copy of an Express Letter from the Political Agent, Bahrein, together with the English translation of the suggested articles. Only one copy of the Arabic t-ranslation has been received and v/e are retaining this for our file. As you v/ill see, the articles have been approved by the Political Resident and the only point on which v/e feel any real doubt is in regard to the use of the words which I have underlined in red ink on page 3. Actually, the statement that the Bahrein Petroleum Company 'is not an English Company' is not in accordance v/ith the facts, and, if the Foreign Office agree, the v/e suggest that /words underlined might be omitted and that the relevant sentence should be amended as follows 'We v/ho live.... about the grant of the oil concession to the Bahrein Petroleum Company.' 3, In other respects the articles appear/appear to Toe suitable, though perhaps the assistance rendered by the British Government is slightly over-emphasised; but this may not be a bad fault, and, subject to any comments which the Foreign Office may have to offer, we should be prepared to agree to publication in the form suggested. 4. As regards place of publication, you will note that it is now suggested that the articles should appear in the Palestine, Iraq and Syria press as well as in Egypt. We see no objection to this suggestion, and, if the Foreign Office also agree, we should be grateful if the authorities in Egypt, Iraq and Palestine could be asked by telegram to make arrangements accordingly. We v/ould at the same time tell Weightman that he may carry on with the arrangements for publication in Syria. For obvious reasons, it seems advisable to avoid simultaneous publication, and it might be left to the authorities concerned to decide v/hen the articles should appear. 5. If the Foreign Office agree, copes of the articles might be sent to Calvert in case they are of any use in connection with the A r abic broadcasts. ^ ^ /M-t. 14 Yours sincerely, I &lt;7 u^xt '£*'**«- 44, urtte****. &amp; *£ 4 . -4hi44. tfu*. cafa P Von T*fi si no e rely. *&gt;&lt;) '« r iOvI GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. 107 -#f /1 A - S. 193 Department.

A preliminary draf in English was prepared conjointly by the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and myself, containing the essential points to which was thought attention should be directed. This draft was then (Signature) handed/-- 2 - 108 handed over to a reliable local Arab with instructions to convert it into a series of four Arabic articles which, while giving prominent attention to those essential points, were to be expressed in a form natural to Arab thought. As will be seen this results in the insertion of much allusion, quotation and padding generally. The English translation attached has been prepared by the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and is a free rendering. The Political Resident has approved of my suggestion that His Majesty’s Government should be requested to issue instructions for arrangements to be made to publish this series of articles in the Pales tine and Iraq press as well as in Egypt, and copies have therefore been forwarded to Jerusalem and Baghdad. 3. Arrangements can be made privately, and with due care to avoid disclosure of the source, for the publication of the same series of articles in a prominent Syrian newspaper, and it is requested that approval to this proposal may be communicated. It is requested that, if the series of arti cles is approved, instructions may be issued to Cairo, Jeru salem and Baghdad for their publication as ’’from a corres pondent'. The articles have been seen and approved by the Political Resident. Political Agent, Bahrain(TO, 109 I. BAHRAIN. AI'-ID v/HAT 13 3AID ABOUT IT. Ive have seen lately several articles about Bahrain published in the Arab press written evidently without investi gation or knowledge of facts by writers who are affected by the disease of prejudice which makes them both blind and deaf so you see from their evil motives they turn fasts upside down. They describe the devil as an angel and an angel as c. devil by insinuating lies and concoctions into their arti— v.lc:s in order to influence the minds of readers who know no- uning about the inr ormation which these writers deliver to them. vve have read with indignation articles in certain papers in which the writer has strayed from the £ath of truth and has deserted the road of sincerity in describing the affairs of ^ahrain and drawing a picture of Bahrain according to his own sweet will. Evil motives are degrading to man, as it was said 'Jnvy is a disease which blinds and deafens'. Te know that intelligent readers are not deceived by unoruths and that false statements will not influence them. Ieoole whotry to deform the beauty of this country do so out of jealousy because they envy its progress in the field of civilisation, progress which their own country has not achieved but they are too degraded to be able to impress the public with their fables and too weak to be able to dictate their lies to responsible people who appreciate the real truth and the ex tent of its influence. Although we know that ohe barking of curs does no harm to the moon and that it is impossible to hide the sky by hold ing up a shirt yet we have decided to offer to the ^irab world some information about Bahrain, its condition and the reality of the progress and advancement which has b een achieved by this country in which we are proud to live, keeping pace with i^o progress step by step on the road of prosperity and success so shall we rend those sour grapes in the eyes of the jealous, verily/-- 2 - no r~\ verily it is said 'How just is jealousy, it begins with its owner and destroys hirn first'. Bahrain is a small independent Arab princedom situated on the shore of the Persian G$rlf, though small it is undoubt edly the most important state in the Gulf. An Arab prince iules it, &lt; is nighness Shaikh Hamad bin Isa of the A1 Kha- \ li±ah family, an ancient and honourable Arab family of noble origin related to the tribe of Bakr Al*Wael. The family has a splendid history and occupies a high place in the Arab world, the Kings, Princes, Chiefs and Nobles of the Arabs admit these facts. H.S. Shaikh Hamad is a liberal and a democratic ruler famed for his g uierosity and kindness. He inclines towards the adoption of modern and v; estern methods of progress while at the same time preservir^g the b asis of Islamic jurisprudence. He leads his people in the road of progress and civilisation with steady steps but he does not allow his people to set aside the laws of Islam or toe ast of 0X10 customs or traditions of their f athers and their an cestors. ne leads his nation to the horizon of progress steo by step so r bat they do not stay dormant nor does he let their feet sliu or rail. His Highness takes advantage of the agreements of friendship with Great Britain, a connec- tion which dates back almost 150 years, during which time the ties ot friendship between his father and grandfathers were firmly adhered to, an agreement by which Great Britain continues t6 protect rsahradn against any possible aggression and renders valuable help on all occasions to His Highness. V*e have seen in those articles, which are full of falsehoods and lies, mis-statements to the effect that the British Government does not allow the Buler of Bahrain to fcule his own country and that the British Government is always/-111 -3- tviu OjJa'VX Iv' \JL() \AA U (4Uma iw/1 always interfering in the internal affairs of Bahrain. Those statements are as far from the truth as they are false and unreal and without foundation. To us, who live in Bahrain, it is as clear as daylight that these allegations are baseless, this deliberate distor tion of facts is caused by Jealousy and a wish to make agita tion and this misrepresentation of facts if from personal mo tives. Allah! this does not blind the sight but it blinds our the heart. We see with made, eyes how the officials of the British Government avoid interfering with the the internal aflairs of the country and how at the s arne time they offer valuable advice to our beloved ruler whenever he needs tech nical experts to help him in matters such as the expansion of agriculture, increasing the medical services and carrying out all sorts of public Vv orks requiring expert technical opinions. We who live in Bahrain know that the country owes much to the : trioish Government for its assistance especiially during the negotiations sxxxsfi about the grant of an oil concession to a foreign company, and this company was not an English comoany. The British Government gave expert advice and secured for Bahrain Bahrain conditions which/would not have obtained without the technical sudvice which was given by British officials. One 0 -i. The s trangest things that we hear in the ramblinirs 01 tnose who write about this country, knowing nothing about it, is that they ask M what does ti e Government of Bahrain consist of?' 7/e wish to answer this question by the following ques tion. Vho formed the Government of the four immediate suc cessors of the Prophet whose fame spread all over the world and reached to the seventh heaven? Who formed the Government of the Cmayad Caliphs, Moua- wiyah, Abdul Malik, Alwaleed, Kisham, in the Orient and Abedel Rahman the third 'A1 Nasir' in Spain? Who/--4- (f 112 .-ho formed the Government in the times of the Abbas- sides Caliphs whose days were a blaze in the forehead of the ages and whose reigns are s till r emembered w ifia pride? Their reigns will be remembered with pride as long as the noble qualities of their monarchs and chiefs are mentioned, even in these times of modern inventions and innovations. Apart ^rom all this, for it is probable that the writer 01 the question is either ignorant of history and of methods of governing or purposely ignores them for some motives or obstinate reasons, nevertheless reasonable people do not ig nore what they see and they judge impartially the things which they come across and they lofck for the causes and the effects of things for good or for evil. The Government of Bahrain is composed of K.H. Shaikh ramad omn Isa helped by the persons to whom he has delegated authority in various matters, they are, his brothers, his sons, and the heads of the various departments of his administration and they are responsible to kXK him for the administration and management of the affairs entrusted to them. Civil Law is administered with the help of a committee of local accessors who a-e experienced, impartial and upright. The task of administration has not been easy at times uuring recent years for Bahrain like all countries of the w orId has su~i.ered oecause of the world depression which affected all countries. This depression did much to ruin the valuable pearl industry and decreased its importance. It is an ancient trade which used to provide work for the inhabitants of Bahrain and brought^ great profit and wealth to the merchants. The intro- auction of Japanese cultured pearls injured the trade and re duced its importance took away much of the profit which the people of Bahraindependdd upon. The/-113 -5- The Government, however, in its wisdom, did not stand helpless in adverting the danger from the people. Owing to its wise policy it was prepared for such eventualities and passed through thisc rias safely without permanent injury unlike some other nauci nations v/hich were so affected by this misfortune that they were seriously injured economically The Government saved money in times of prosperity and used it in the time of depression until the universal depres sion had passed over. Two years ago oil began to be produced in large quantities and the royalty from oil brought w ealth to the country, in fact the revenue today owing to the oil royalty is equivalent to three times what it was in any previous time of the country*s greatest prosperity. (To be continued).Continued Part II . (&lt;(*) 114 'v concluded our last article with a description . eo pi - nation oT the new source of V¥ r ealth which pours streams of riches from the buried treasure of petroleum. f . weeks apa His Highness Shaikh B r m'd presided over the inauguration ceremony of the Bahrain Petroleum Company»s refinery which produces nearly a million tons of petrol per annum. On each ton of petrol exported the Company pays to the Government of Bahrain three and a half rupees. This is not the only advantage which has come to us ■^rom Bahrain oil, the Company employes over 5000 men in dif ferent capacities who spend the major portion of their 7 /n,&lt;?es 1^ local markets, thus the tide of plenty flows over the merchants and shop keepers aw well as on the workers who draw handsome salaries from the Company which looks after their health and conditions as well. Fo doubt people who do not know anythin 0 * about Bahrain — and the press does not give them an opportunity of know ing the correct news — would like to know something about this/ wealth of Bahrain and how this Arab kingdom spends its revenue from oil. It is the right of the Arabs to know and it is a matter on which the obstinate cannot argue and which cannot be ignored b^ those who wilfully pretend ignorance# We have discussed the ways in which this, wealth is Spent and we hu,ve formed our judgments after careful ielitoera- tion. It is divided into three thirds, one third is retained by His Highness the Shaikh who distributes the greater portion of it among his family, A1 Khali fall and in charity# He gives liberslly to the poor and the needy thereby increasing his reputation for philanthropy from day to day among his people and releasing their tongues in his praised. Generosity att racts the hearts of human beings and for this noble quality his/-115 his reputation has spread over the country and has gained for him the love and regard of his people whose hearts have become enamoured of him* It is natural that money should open the mouths. Of the remaining two thirds a large sum is set apart every year for future contingencies, to replenish the trea sury with funds in order to carry on the administration ih th »ve t o'* * he liroinution of oil, the r3w' is ’.peat on public utility schemes, public health, municipalities, public worhs, Police, Public Security and Education etc etc. These are the chief ways in which the Government spends its revenue and history does not point to any better system of expenditure of public funds or any better arrangement thcnn that one part should be for the ruling family, one part a reserve for the future and one part for public utilities. It is quite/ evident that the management of these du ties and the need to take care for the future places a heavy burden on the shoulders of the Adviser to His Highness Shaikh Hamad, in this connection we wish to say something about this Englishman, Mr. Belgrave, the wise and firm adviser, who is known by the people as a strong, widely eaqperienced and sin cere friend of His Highness and of all classes of people In Bahrain. We live in Bahrain and we know all about its social and economic conditions both now and In the past, we follow' the trend of events and we see hpw this gentleman works for the welfare and the prosperity of the people. Both in the past and at present but especially in the years of adversity we have heard the people expressing their gratitude to him for his sincere efforts to improve their condition. The Adviser, Mr. Belgrave, is an Englishman, belong ing to a well-known English family, he is quiet and consider-^ ate and misrepresentation and trickery cannot move him an inch / -S~;ri S ^ -^ VG s ? * B : blmiit x^nora ^'net Xs-ia^ al Jl ^ixi lo .arietiicm 3 x1j r ^--.c v-ssTet ani rfe±ftt.Iq« o: nrr-^^J t r 'ni ni*.*r ■ %o*i % .- — rfi no±*r&gt;rr^8toJtefe ’ rxa v'lino cj i? ^ :i - ^ no d-nnqa a.t tzs% ut t ato to nri^jbr / -ar:^ -* ^ '- ^oolic ' srl* rfcj:;nr fi± ^«w tsi^P •••^ —' nin^E V- oj ^ri.toq tp: arc: , ;;• - ^ ni vr ' ' :; | -05 ■l 7 [Isxfo 8?.ortrf|iP aiB ocr ^xoaivbA aifet 'to s-iefc- :.iO:te '••r_; -c acr.^c • • . ■ ' ■ ■ ‘ . ■ ' -i .&gt;: haz b&amp;t&gt;n&amp;Z*t ms ^X.n&amp;lT t 3-ro-*:t3 &gt; a aiqcaq nl ^-‘rorr to eooo^o XXn to ana aaonxl^XH SJtE lo bnoi-': e^o • ^ ai 9V±I dW #ai ^‘ n-3a ♦ allot e; t ct2£q oxiX nl. air JfCS snet: : &gt;: o 0 &gt;i 0 Re.S^ •c' .r-io ' asmi44 is r 3Xnt i-'q-i oa or ? * • 1 :c ^ 9: -.t r: dtoH .slqoc-r oriX tt ^*0 120*3 '- L ' - :r ' I '' ; °- : ' - . o'. ^ .n l 3 ni . ■ -* - ' ' ’ ' ^ ' Z ' min of ebisi.. • - .r.oi.-io.joo ‘ixaitt ©vo^qsiX cc '• ^ :o a ro zi: %c -rnolocf ^aowfeHs^S «“* ai t e. -i: •' *' : t- ;i7 '‘ 3 ^ _ «. • a. -&gt;.. 8 r,3- Inch from the right path. Mischief, wrongdoers and people of evil design cannot invoke his wrath against Innocent peo pie who have no fault except the nobility of their charac ters and tljeir sincere and truthful seevice to their country. He is just and firm, feared by the strong and trusted by the weak. He has studied the mentality and manners of Arabs and possesses wide experience of Arab conditions. He obtained experience while living in Arab countries, Egypt, the Sudan and Bahrain where he passed the major part of his life. This experience enables him to administer the contry shrewdly and smoothly. Such qualities as his are seldom found in a person living in surroundings where the wicked activities of jealous persons aim at degrading this and lowering the prestige of that. Those who read western papers no doubt know a^out the financial diffic ilties of various nations and the various taxes imposed on the people by the authorities In ordefc to balance the Budget and to prevent xix crises. Such taxation places an unbearable burden on them. We who follow the trend of events know how the Adviser successfully carried on and managed the finance of the state under trying circumstances without imposing any kind of taxation at all. He proved in doin g this his financial ability and experience and saved the State from falling into the grip of debt. He did not impose taxes on the people and reduce them to poverty, those people whose only trade was the pearl industry which is a luxury trade and can be dispensed with in rainy days, thus he proved his financial ability and experience which saved Bahrain from a fall, from a catastrophe. It is not surprising therefore to find His Highness and the people of the State loving him and praying God for his long life to enable him to carry on his useful duties among them.We read in many western papers many discussions on the question of unemployment which has daunted well-known financiers and caused the fall of many ministries both in » the East and in the West. Unemployment is a great problem The problem of unemployment causes a struggle against its results and requires endeavours to find effective remedy social to save the Government from the sasnil evils resulting from unemployment, and to preserve the people from misery and po verty. That problem which has often defeated and daunted western financial experts has been dealt with by Mr. Bel- grave with wisdom and skill in his fight against financial difficulties which succeeded in reserving for the country its ease and comfort. In the palmy days he had built up a Reserve Fund for the country which provided for the ex penditure during the rainy days. He initiated many useful public works such as building the Manama Muharraq bridge the construction of public buildings and. roads and these schemes absorbed in employment alirost all the Idle workmen. The qualities which adorn Mr. Belgrave are those of an able and sue oessful administrator. Proceed, Sir, pay no attention to the tactics of the mischievous and the de signers of evil, carry out the duties entrusted to you b c His Highness for the welfare and prosperity of the people who appreciate the results of your useful schemes.art III. We have written enough in our previous articles to refute the allegations of calummious reporters and to con vince the open minded readers about the affairs of Bahrain, so in this article we shall describe the many improvements introduced and financed by the Government in the fields of public works, medical and social schemes. The Bridge. The State of Bahrain consists of many islands the most important of which are Ilanama and Muharraq. Manama is the capital of the state and the commercial centre, in it reside foreign and local merchants. Muharraq is entirely isolated and it was feared that it would lose its importance on account of the exodus of its inhabitants to Manama. Muhar raq contains the aerodrome used by the Imperial Airways Com pany. Muharraq also contains a vast area of open land which would yield good harvests if cultivated. The Government out of its wisdom decided to connect these two islands with a bridge of about three kilometres in length in order to make one city. This great work was conn enced about seven years ago, before the grant of the petroleum concession, before the Government had any royalty revenue from oil. At that time the Government had to deal with the question of unemployment and to find work for large numbers of unemployed labourers who were affected by the depression so the Government employed them in the constructions of this bridge and enabled them tom earn their daily livelihood which prevented any labour dis turbances. As I have said above the work was started seven years ago but it is now near completion except for the chan- proposed nel over Khor Khaleya, where it is sui-axxxxx to build a moving bridge which will have two advantages. Firstly it will give the sailing boats a free passage to the Khor A1 Khaleya without119 - 2 - any obstacle and secondly it will not hinder the movement of the t ide which might otherv/ise cause water to flow over parts of the two islands if the tide was obstructed or block ed without a passage b eing left for the water* This neces sitates the leaving of an opening in the bridge in order to put in a moving bridge above the water so as not to stop its flow or to prevent the movements of sailing boats, and this is a v/ise act. Those who remember the difficult passage between the islands of Manama and Muharraq before the bridge reached its present condition speak of this great work with praise which it deserves, the previous state v; as one of great difficulty especially in times of storms and winds when conmernce was delayed and movement was prevented. It is hoped that the completion of the construction of the rest of the bridge will take place after complete investigation and expert ad vice has been obtained as to the type of brdige necessary to finally link up the two islands. The building of the bridge was not the only undertaking which the Bahrain Government carried out, though this work has played an important part in reviving the social life of the country. In the past two years it has constructed many large buildings for different public purposes such as dis pensaries, civil and religious courts and schools. It also built a spacious edifice for a new customs Jiouse and many otiler Government offices. The most important of these is the building which contains within its walls the civil law courts and the V/akf departments. It is a handsome building situated in the centre of Manama on the sea. The courts are of different classes and grades and are presided over by Arab Kadis and magistrates and committees of local mer chants who decide disputes arising among the people. We are glad to say that many young men of the country are employ ed in the various departments of the courts and in the-3- (UJ&gt; 120 Government offices, some have been educated in Syria and in India after completing their courses in the Government schools in Bahrain. Education. In mentioning culture and youth we must include a reference to the Education Department and the good results of its administration which have been produced in Bahrain. No body canddeny that the progress of education is as a measure which shows the right of the community to live. A nation which takes care of e ducation and increases the number of educated people and schools and raises the s ta.ndard of litera cy in its youth is destined to live a happy and long life. A nation which neglects education and leaves its youth to loaf in the lanes and street corners, like goats and sheep, is doomed to a life of degradation and to extinction. The Government of Bahrain wisely reviev/ing the sodal state and the eternal universal rules decided to compete with advanced nations towards high standards hence our beloved -buler formed the Department of Public Instruction and dele gated the highest authority to his brother His Excellency Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifa , the Minister of Educa tion, assisted by the orga isation for the management of the department and by a Syrian who acquired his higher educa tion at the University of Beyrout and who practised the pro fession of teaching which gave him experience in organisation and the knowledge of thisdepartment. His Excellency Shaikh Abdulla is famed for his wisdom perception, acumen and statemanship and for his sincere love of the people who he advises and .guides, therefore he is truly the father of the Education Department. His being in charge of educational matters causes the spread of culture and brings people to the Government schools in search of knowledge. The/--4- The Education Department has made great progress and advance since the reorganisation of the Government schools and the new arrangement of the educational programme which en sures the success of the pupils. Before the reorganisation there were only two schools, one in Manamah anddne in Muharraq, today there are seven bo s schools and, in addition, a techni cal school was opened this year in which youths are taught car pentry and mechanics. The s chools are looked after by able tea chers who t each s cient if ic ally and well. There are two large girls schools as wel , one in I anama and one in Muharraq v/here girls are given elementHBy education and all that is needed for a maid, sewing embroidery and domestic science. The schools follow in their methods the best methods in use in Iraq, Syria and Egypt. headers will be interested to know that in Bahrain eiuca- tion is free, the Government e/en pays the «penses of young men who go abroad to obtain higher e due at ion. Free education opens wide the door to the rich and the poor alike sobeing^ satisfied with the succers of education everyone sends their children to the schools. People realise what advantages e dueation provides, thanks to the Education Department v/hich is so liberally finan- d ced by the Government and which produces hundreds of young men who are earning their livelihood yearly. If it had not been for the Government schools these youths would have been reck oned among the illiterate idlers who dcuse their families Isheir country and their nation. Free education which is provided from Government funds and looked after by the Government has given opportunities for exposing latent talents and bney are benefited by their labour. In this material age success goes to the s erious clever worker not to the dormant, lazy and illi terate. Owing to these arran ements illiteracy will end in the coming years.

Not content with all this the Department of Edu cation has encouraged batches of students to go abroad for further studies 5 in addition to the help it gives to inter nal education, several young men of the country are studying in educational institutions in Syria and India and several young women are learning medicine, nursing and midwifery ana the art of teaching in Iraq and Syria. A thing that comforts and satisfies the soul is the policy of the Government which aims at educating young men of the country to make them well equipped and strong to hold important public offices in future. Owing to their higher education they will be competent to permanently improve and care for the commercial interest of Bahrain. We are glad to state that seveial hundreds of educated young men are now emp loyed in the Government offices, in Banks, business firms and inthe Bahrain Petroleum Company and are earning handsome salaries. The Government has not Ignored the good effects of physical training in character building and directing the strength of youth towards useful undertakings. This streng thens their hearts and enables them to manager their own affairs. The Government has employed a young athlete from Syria to undertake the organisation of scouting and physical training and to organise these subjects in a manner to lead to the youth to the place which they aspire/and to give them the right to live healthy lives. This athletic teacher has arrived and has taken over his duties in organising physical training and scouting. Clubs for this are to be opened in Manama and Muharraq follow ing the golden rule ,f a sound mind in a sound body’ 1 .123 Part 4. Page 1. As we have now truly described what the Government of Bahrain has done and is doing in the way of valuable reforms and important projects we must briefly conclude our discussion so that those conceited people may realise that they have not well served themselves, or their community or their country by showing to the public their perverted imagination and weak mentality by trying to criticize the Government of Bahrain and by drawing a wrong picture of its administration* The officials of the Government of this country have sensibly perceived that the establishment of a good life for the Government, which wants a respected position of great honour and to be feared by the people cannot be attained except by paying attention to Law and Order, Public Health, Education, Public Works and important projects. At this point we must stop our pen and direct our readers to the most important good work which yields fruitful results to the authorities in the form of greatness and respect and which sows in the hearts of the people of the nation both honour and love. That is a description of the work which the Government has undertaken in the improvement of the public health* Undoubtedly it is the greatest service which the officials of a Government can render to the public. We are still dependent in Bahrain, in this direction, on the valuable medical help given by the Government of India whicn has founded a big hospital in Manama which is used by aix communities and people. They are examined by the doctors and given medicines to prevent illnesses. The Bahrain Government has founded despensaries in some of the towns and villages for the treatment of men, women and children who are given free medicine. In order to benefit everyone the Government sends its medical men periodically to villages and the people of those places so that none are without these amenities. The country knows that owing to the careful attention of the Government diseases and epidemics have124 Page S. decreased* The Government has reclaimed marshes which breed snec -ies of the fatal malaria mosquitoes which undermine the public health. In the pearl fishing season, when thousands of divers are in tneir ^ailing boats on the pearl banks, remaining away from the shore for weeks, the Government sends its doctors on sea trips to supervise the health of the divers who are exposed to various kinds of diseases as their work does not allow them to return to shore for treatment. The doctors treat them at sea without causing them to lose the season which is an important matter, the pivot of their livelihood, to the people of Bahrain. Hence it is evident to the noble reader that the officials of the Bahrain Government are doing a stupendous work which simi lar Governments in such circumstances are less able to do. A cause of pride and pleasure to this Government is that it is undertaking a great project which will perpetuate its nonour for all times. The Government of Bahrain has begun to bpild a big new modern hospital on a scientific basis for the treatment of men, women and children. The first building/* will be the dis pensary for out door patients who will be examined by doctors and given medicine, this will be followed by another large build ing, the inpatient hospital, with wards provided with beds for men, women and dhildren where they will be treated for different diseases, skin diseases^ venereal, and a provision for surgical tment of all kinds and degrees. The Government has made arrangements to obtain the ser vices of a first class qualified doctor to look after the public health department and the new hospital in Bahrain. We know that it will not be long before an equally well qualified woman doc tor will be appointed to undertake the trertment of women and girls The question of malaria, which is the most pr valent di sease not only in Bahrain but in all Gulf Coastal towns, is b&amp;ing considered /--5~ considered with special care and the disease is being fought by the well known method of filling up marshes. The Govern ment of India kindly lent a malaria expert who is now care fully studying the causes of this fatal malady and will sub mit a report to the Government of Bahrain to enable the di sease to be fought. The disease has become very severe and it is difficult to uproot it. We hope that by scientific investigation the authorities will be able to put an end to the disease and free the people from its evils. Agriculture. One of the most important works which has received the most attention from our Ruler and his Adviser is the teaching of agriculture and showing people how to uncover the buried treasure of the soil. The soil of Bahrain is suitable for agriculture but it used to be short, of two most important fac tors, water and the careful attention of the people. The exis tence of sufficient water, which was not available before was needed to make it flourish. The fertile soil is there,-the cul tivators are there but it lacked water and when water was found modern scientific methods were needed to show people hhw to grow plants in a manner ensuring great profit. in the last few years it was discovered that under the earth of Bahrain there was contained a great treasure of fresh wafeer suitable to drink and use. The Government drilled many artesian wells and the Government was follov/ed by the merchants The number of wells increased , land owner began making fields and gardens in which to grow vegetables and fruit, all watered by these wells. It Is hoped that the soil of Bahrain will improve to such an extent that in future it will produce mich more than what it produces today. The Government of India continually renders valuable help to us in this direction. It has arranged to send an agricultural expert to examine the soil of Bahrain and to study the atmospher«*lc conditions and to submit a report to the Bahrein-4 't'k 0 -ahram rov 61*111116110 \h/ioIi sump's scions x'oi'* cap._'yin^ outj a policy oi agriculture• The means of* livelihood of* nations are three, Industry, Commerce and Agriculture. The expert is expected to arrive within a few weeks to begin his experimental work which it is hoped will imp rove agricultural projects and make alive many dead lands so that they produce harvests and spread comfort and pros perity to all. v/hen the agricultural expansion has spread throughout the country in all the villages and out of the way places it will give the people opportunities of sharing ~.ie prosperity o.l blooming Bahrain*^ and its progress and of taking the treasures Ox the earth by means of agriculture as the oik is taken out of the earth so all will proceed in the way of right and justice. Taxation. I have left over an important question which Iw ant to put to the rea ers and I hope that they have realised that I was not exaggerating when I described Bahrain and its imp rovements and cSaid that it is the Bride of the Gulf. I am sure that the reader will be surprised and pleased at once to hear that the people here in Bahrain are not pressed by the Government by heavy tolls and taxes of many kinds in or der to balance the Budget and make up the d eficits as is the custom in neighboruing princedoms. Here is no deficit and no pressure on account of the wise arrangements of the Go vernment. There is no income tax, no tithes, no lend revenue tax, no tax on palm trees nor any mention of the tax known as poll t ax which is collected b some governments and spend on undertakings. The only tax in Bahrain is tk in the form of customs duty and it is much lower than that of any other government. In addition to this nominal customs duty there is a tax levied by the municipalities on building property which is insufficient to cover the expenditure of the municipalities so the government gives them assistance.-5- (55 127 Therefore you see the people happy and contented in texK this fortunate country. I am right in saying for tunate because nations do not know any other government which sympathises with its people so and v/orks for their prosperity; I say the people of Bahrain are happy because they are enjoying all the different kinds of comfort, happi- ness and prosperity in the protection of their ruler who leaves no stone unturned to make Mis people happy and con tented. The nation has no complain £f foreiA? interference in the affairs of the country. Our honoured ruler and the officials of his jovernment are free t o administer the affairs of their country and in the protection of all that relates to the interest and prosperity of the people and the preservation of the Arab tradition. He and his assistants are persevering to raise the educational and social status of Bahrain and at the same time acknowledge the importance of the disinterested help which they receive from the British Government and from India which helps them to achieve their object of ensuring the happiness and prosperity of the people..THIC/VH.

Dear Chancery, An objectionable article appeared in the A1 Shabab newspaper of Cairo on bth October which contained an attack on Belgrave, who, as you know, is the Financial Adviser to the Bahrain Government. We have fairly reliable informat ion that this article was written by one Abdulla bin Marzow, who is beleived to be a Hedjazi usually resident in Jedda and at one time employed in some capacity by Ibn Saud as a press censor or agent. A few months ago he came to Bahrain and busied himself a great deal in asking questions about the place and applying for copies of old proclamations, etc., etc.. He actually sent a questionaire to various people, though he got very little in the way of replies; and he himself delivered variaus remarks in Bahrain which are well fairIj^.word for word as they appeared later in the article in question. 2. We do not necessarily intend taking any action against Marzow although the Bahrain Government might ask us to try and ensure that he did not visit Bahrain again, but we would be grateful if you could by any chance confirm that he was the aut ho r of the article, and in any case if you could confirm his reported connection with Jedda and with -/ Ibn Saud The Chancery, British Legation, Jedda.146 Ibn Sand* * We are sending copy of this letter to the Political Agent, Bahrain; could you please send copy of your reply to him,?

THE COUNTRY OP BAHRAIN WHAT BEFELL HER THROUGH COLONIZATION. By an Arab Victim. One will be surprised when he looks carefully into the state of Bahrain where there are quite many strange and wonderful things and where the British Colonization has thrust pains in the souls - especially that of the young men who feel the pain as they follow up the tangible progress and advancement of the Arab f Nations all over the world through the grace of their leaders and active chiefs. The men and notables of this country who were presented with medals of disgrace by the Foreign Power which they call ’’Decorations” by the Foreign Power - seme of then are afraid of their shadow while others fear lest they may be deprived of their wealth; their little brains lead them to this belief. Since the cogp d’etat until now Arabian Bahrain has been administered by an Englishman named Mr. Belgrave, the Financial Adviser to the Bahrain Coverment. This man has taken control of al- the internal affairs with an iron hand supported by the full power of British Authority. His official designation is Financial Adviser but he has become the absolute Ruler exercising sole authority over all economical and judicial matters etc. He is the man who enacts laws for the local courts and whose wishes cannot be obstructed and whose order is executed on aqy ma tter whereas he is not an administrative man in any of these lines. But the fact that he is a British subject has put him in t his important position which he holds forever and if this British — Colonization /^ i CIS) 156 Colonization continues to exist (which God forbid) it is possible that his sons and grandsons may succeed him* I give below an account of the state of Bahrain during the regime of this man for the information of good people# EDUCAT IOIT, This man has killed the educational feeling totally and the shhools became nominal only. Belgrave has put his confidence in the wonderful Director of Education Faiq Adham who looks only to his personal interest and who, since he held this post, began to kill the roots of education and consequently the character of the children was spoilt on account of lack of education and the coffee-shops and streets became their abode. The fright of the fathers was beyond conception* They are unable to send their sons to the local schools# It is curious to know that a sum of Hs*60 # 000/- is reserved in the Government Budget to be spent on education which amount goes to the pockets of the Director and the teachers whom he brings for educational and training purposes and who s t ill are in great need of education thanselves. Then reiterating the state of Bahrain shcools prior to the interference of the Government in their affairs and before the appointment of this man to the post of Director, I must offer gratitude to two personalities who rendered very valuable services to Bahrain and spread national and educational feelings amongst the youths# They are Say id Othman al Horan i and Say id Omar Yahia who were deported by the Foreign Power as they were loyal to Bahrain and were not agreeable to the interference of the Goveriment in the affairs of the schools and programmes of teaching. GOVERNMENT POSTS* Owing to the inefficiency as stated above the Goverment posts have become a monopoly with the foreigners# I have never heard of any country in any part of the world where a foreigner lives respected and honoured and holds the highest post and the best /.3- 157 best Government rank as in Bahrain (apart from the important position which he (foreigner) holds and the respect which he gets from the Oil company) while the native/lives a mean and inconsider able life# For example, when a stranger comes to Bahrain he will have to land naturally at the Customs House for the inspection of his luggage. I swear by God that it will strike him at once that he has landed in a non-Arab country which has not the least connection with the Arabs. This will be evident when a sufficient number of Hindu officials come forward to him and welcome him (I whshed they were Muhanmedan Indians who would at any rate respect their Moslem brother)# But if a native comes back from a journey, woe to him as these Hindus intentionally show disrespect to him# He remains for hours and hours collecting his luggage which consists of clothes etc. which have been scattered by the Inspectors# For some years we have been given hopeful promises by our Government that they will have every foreigner in their various departments to retire on pension but it appears that this premise is only a mirage which a thirsty man takes it to be water but when he approaches it he finds it to be nothing# In other words they are false promises# Perhaps someone may say that the natives are inefficient for work# The work which a local man does or is trained t o do within a period of one month in the utmost can be picked up by him better than a foreigner does in a year at least. Wibrst of all is that if a post in any of the departments is offered to a foreigner on a pay of Rs.150/- the same post is offered to a native on a pay of Rs.30/» as Arabs - in the eye of Khowaj a Belgrave - do not deserve more ti»n that. GOVSRHMEHT FINANCB AKD THE RUItBR* S PRIVATE PURSE# I swear that I must suspect this Financial Adviser and say frankly that this man has found a fertile grazing ground in which he eats without check or supervision and especially from the private /158 -4- private purse of the Ruler and what belongs to him out of the income of oil which are kept in the Eastern Bank Limited (which is the only bank in Bahrain* The Gpverment treasury is written in his name but no sums can be drawn without the signature of our friend Belgrave)* The strong reason for non»confidence in him is clear as is the sUn in the midday* He has reserved for himself the post of Head of all the Government Departments having no assistant. Whenever the Government of Bahrain offered to appoint an assistant for him he refused and insisted on disapproval. There is no doubt that no one can go against his wishes as already stated # He is the Financial Adviser^ the Absolute Ruler over internal affairs, enactor of laws, keeper of the private purse of the Ruler, Assistant Director of Customs, State Engineer, in the absenceof the actual Engineer, Commanding Officer of the Forces etc©etc* He carries out all these functions alone and without the help of an Assistant which led to a chaos in the departments. HIS CONNECTION vVITH THE OIL COMPANY. If we look at the connection of Mr. Belgrave with the American Oil Company and the special treatment which he accords to them in all matters, the poor native workman is like a slave in t heir hands although he does not receive more than 10 Annas for a working day of limited 8 hours. If he falls sick as a result of accident or injury, he would not be given tlsse wages although they are little and the Company would neither carry him to the Hospital nor bear ahy responsibility regarding him. This is no doubt due to the special treatment of our Cover men t to them and their decline to do anything that would displease them. They (Company) no doubt give him something sufficient for him as the general public say, 'Something would not come out of nothing'. STAMPS.

(!&amp; 164 l oundarie s between Trap an d K uwait A problem hag appeared as to the boundary line Between Iraq and Kuwait due to the pressure brc^ht by Customs lolice on the smu^glero from Kuwait. It is evident that this pressure haa resulted in putting (nearly) a stop to smuggling which (naturally) does not harm the Kuwait Government. Complaints are, therefore, made that tne Customs lolice are encroaching upon Kuwait boundaries. The British representative is taking Kuwait aide and is sending protest after protest. Kuwait which was a pert and parcel of this country, and which until tne last day of the Othoman reign in Iraq flas considered a ,,adna (district; attache to tile Basra Vilayat, is today 'putting it acroes us'* and demanding that ve fur a boundary line between ua.

I propose informing the Shaikh (of Ku\^lt) of the result of your interview with Kuri Pasha (given in the latter of the two despatches quoted above), and I have no doubt that this will have the effect of easing his mind With regard to annexation. 2. Tnfortunately I have just received a further ’Iraqi Press attack on Kuwait which I enclose ( aekson's impress Letter of 2nd January 1936, Ko.C-1, with a translation of the article in question). Th* 'An Kas” article seems to be &amp; particularly pernicious production. Briefly it states that when the Treaty of ’^qair was made Bin Baud’s concurr ence was only temporary, that he merely pretended to concur to please an old friend - Sir Percy Cox, that he declared openly that he would not be bound by its terms, and that Cox knew this perfectly well. The article then goes on to mention the 'detaching' of the Beutral Zone by the Saudi Government from Kuwait by which the latter would lose possible valuable oilfields. 3. Naturally we know that this article is a farrago of nonsense, but this is by no means the opinion that will be taken by the ave age ’ *raqi, Nejdi, or Kuwaiti, who may read the / Sir Archibald Clark K#rr,X.C* .G«» His Majesty's Ambassador, Bagdad•175 - 2 - the article, or, if illiterate, may hear ebout it, or even by the Shaikh of Kuwait himself* S'hen the ’Iraqi Press talk about the ’annexing’ of Kuwait, though naturally this is annoying to the Shaikh, the latter must know (at leaet 1 presume he does; that if the ’Iraqi tfovernment were ever so ntupid ua to attempt annexation this would be an act of war which we would deal with speedily and effectively. But this ttxlY about bin Saud going back on the * €&gt;qair Treaty, and Cox knowing about Bin Saud* s real intentions at the time he made the Treaty, seems to me a good deal more harmful. The Ghaikh has always felt very sore over this Treaty which he feels (vide Dickson’s demi-official letter of 2nd October 1924 to the India Office, vide india Office Printed Better Jfo.P.Z.6160/S4 of 19th October 1934} gave away tribes and territory to Bin Saud which rightly belonged to Kuwait. The Feutral ^one especially he looks on ae Belonging | by right to him (vide Dickson’s letter quoted above) and not as joint property between himself and Bin Baud as it /as made by the Treaty. 4. I am sure he will not suspect Cox, who was a friend of his, of bad faith, but the whole trend of the article may well leave an uneasy feeling in his mind with regard to the Neutral Zone. I shall do my best to disabuse him of this feeling by telling him that the article le of course - **6 he knows' ~ rubbish from beginning to end. 5. With regard to Dickson’s Impress Letter I think it unlikely that the article was inspired from Hiath, and agree with the suggestion made in his paragraph 3 that its motive is probably pecuniary X pw sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe, Walton and Dickson.

This neutral zone is bounded on the last at the port of Julai’ah, on the ^outh (north?) at Bubaihiyah, and on the lest by the Junction of the Iraq-kuwait frontier. ’Hie argument• 2 - 178 Tho arguncnt of the ^audi Goven*w«r*t in detaoiling this plot which dad been recognized by the lieJd-Kuwait frontier agreeroent referred to above, in that Kuwait never had tribal subjects curing the period of oaudi reign in 2*ejd.

It tihould be mentioned here that should these territories be detacheu from Kuwait, the latter would lose many of the Gil tfieids that had long been the aim of foreif^i companies until the present Company succeeded in taking their concession.3479 7888 (2) No. 658.

Development of Smu^iing Activities in Kuwait, In a leader under the above heading, written a propos the three recent encounters between smugglers and the Iraqi special police force, in one of which the former were found to be using an armed car, the editor declares that the only effective means for putting an end to smuggling is the annexation of Kuwait to the Kingdom of Iraq. In this connection the editor writes j 'Indeed, if the sufferings which Iraq has been experiencing through Kuwait were experienced by another State through a principality such as Kuwait, such other State would shake the world and find in smuggling incidents an excuse for the annexation of that principality to its territories to form an integral part thereof. We believe that the authorities themselves agree with us in this view and in the belief that the only means of overcoming this formidable obstacle lies in the annexation of that principality to Iraq and the removal of customs and other barriers existing between the former and the latter ”If incidents recur and the activities of smugglers assume a new phase, the authorities will perhaps be moved to make serious endeavours for the annexation of Kuwait to Iraq.” En passant the editor observes : 'In any case, whether the motive behind smuggling is one of a purely economic nature with no other interests being involved, or there are certain external political influences at play aiming at something other than profit through smuggling, it is not sufficient for us to double our police force and incur endless expenditure. The only solution for the problem lies, as already pointed out by us, in the annexation of Kuwait to Iraq.”.CONFIDENTIAL. ^ No. 951-3 of 1935.

He will be relieved by the British Consul at Mnsoat* e also under a tana that His Highness the Bair of Kuwait has appointed the said Colonel as his representative to the Company which he has granted an oil concession for Kuwait; ana that the representative*s permanent residence will be in London. ,© do not, however, Know whether this appointment has anything to do wi th the difference arising between King Ibn Baud ana the company - that difference which wa referred to in a pre/ioua number. Col nasi ick son is very ?ell Known to the people of this country, for he was one of the Bolitioal '-frleers during the British occupiition; He became famous particularly in the Huntefik Liwa, on account of his fnllinf* in with &gt;»rab custoias in the :iiatter of entertaining guests. There he had a guest-house in which coffee used to be pounded all day am rice cooked with mutton was continuously pro vided. His house was furniabad in the bedouin fashion, with carpets and rugs laid on the ground. In it Dickson spent much of his time; there you could see him seated on the ground conversing with his guests, and taking part in the relation of bedouin stories anu tales. Colonel Dickson*s -alley in this country, however, was unsuccessful. He a up or tec ^ir ttiison. but the British/rrit&amp;sh rovamneut, haying deoided to change their policy in this country, t ermine tea his services in Iraq, and appointed him as a political j gent at ahra in. 'or reasons not as yet Known to ua he was again discharged frow the political service, and for aba it one year he rojaained without political work. In 1&amp;21 a difference which had arisen between His Majesty ing ibn ^aud ana .«ajor i^aly, the British Political .gent at Bahmin, gave him a chance to resume his political career. The cause of the abovauieutioned differenew was as follows: -according to the revisions of the treaty between him am the British Oor ernnen t, nii%; Ibn K&gt;auci, than lultan of Nejd, was bound to seiKi through the Political ^ gent at Bahrain all his communications with the British Crowermaent. He observed ttien that aiy opposed him. He, therefore, protest ed am asked that the mediator snoulc be a person other than Daly. The British Government, famous as they are, to seize opportunities for turning anything into benefit, instructed their Hi$di Cereals si oner for Iraq, than :ir Percy tox, to open negotiations *ith Ibn Baud in regard to the difference arising be tween him am iajor ifty. - ir Pcr&lt;^', it is understood liked . ickaou aiu- watched an opportunity to get him an appoint ment. lie, therefore, proposed him a a a British Political ^gent at Ibn Baud' a Court with headquarters at ^atif. By this proposal .&gt;ir xercy wanted to hit v*o biroa with orie stone. But ibn -nub refuted this proposal on the plea that the fanatic people of *Nejd would in no case agree to the appointment of Consuls in their country. Consequently . ir Percy Cox persuaded his Goverrmsnt of the necessity of appointing Bickson as a lolitical l ediator between them anc Ibn Baud, on the understanding that his headquarters would be at isahrain. The British Government agreed to this; and hick eon continued to occupy that office until at last Ibn uuo tore up his treaty with the .ritish Gov 0 mjacnt after he had invaded tiie hijaz a:id obtaii^d hishis complete inGependcsnce* Hiereafter iiu the rank of - ajar) transferred to iiyderabad % India) to s err e in the British Garrison at the ^aja at Kyderabad’e capital, ^ut in I9a0 he was reappointed to the corps of iolitical agents in the Per si an Gulf.

SHOULD KUWAIT UNITHD /ITH * IRA^. A writer from Basra says:- ”1 have learnt from a reliable source that the Shaikh of Kuwait’s visit to London is comected with the politics of his country, and especially with a new plan which the British Government desire to introduce into Kuwait, where their policy ban hitherto been baaed upon the principle of non-interference with Internal affaire. The British Political &lt;@8Went In the Persian Gulf, it seems, visited Kuwait and told halKh ^hmad al Jabir, shortly before the latter left for London, that the British Government were no longer In e position to resist the protests that came to them without, number from Governments which were adjacent to or near to Luwai -, dealing with the many either claims preferred by llxelr subjects, or with the smuggling movement which has reached an alarming state. As I3xe British Pgsldent’s repented warnings to the Shaikh of Kuwait, which all urged the necessity of reforming and reorganizing the administration in Kuwait, have been of no avail, the British Government considers that It would he In the Interest of Kuwait that the latter should accept the form of administration which was sometime ago introduced In Bahrain, and which resulted In a settled state of affairs there, l.e. that Kuwait should accept British advisers to supervise Its administration, especially finance and jusUce. The He si dent also told the shaikh that he had received se/eral applications frem the enlightened young- men'of Kuwait, all of which stated that they (the applicants: we -3 tired of the prevalent condition:! in Kuwait, anddemanded ttiat Kuwait should be annexed to Iraq. 'If this is impossible', they said, ”we request that the British Government should interfere with a view to reforming the state which has become intolerable. H The source (person) from which I have obtained this news, adds that .shaikh j,hmad refused the Resident’s proposals, and in consequence left for London to try a to convince the Colonial Office to give up this idea; and that the Resident told the shaikh at the time that his visit to London would not affect these proposals which, in the interest of Kuwait itself, must be enforced.«B« 209 Translation of an article (inspired from Baghdad) which appeared in the Palestine newspaper w Al Falestine' under date 14th August 1935* 'THIS PifiGPLiS Of KIMAIT ASPIH13 TO BS UiaTiSD WITH 'THE BRITISH aOVJSRNMEHT ATTEMPTS TO S3CT3NP HER PROTECTION OVER THAT COUNTRY'. from our own correspondent.

The youngmen of Kuwait have recently presented a petition to the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in which they expressed their aspiration ami desire to be united with Iraq. They said in their petition, that conditions in Kuwait did not agree with the keen desire felt by the people for introduc ing into their country the methods of modern civilization. It seems, however, that Briti^i policy aims at utllzing the bad state of affairs in Kuwait to bring that country under her direct control, as has been the case in Bahrain. It is said also that the (British) plan of uniting the Persian Gulf Emirates into a sort of Confederation, which was shown up by the Press some two years ago, has today been raised again. Indeed British political activities in the Persian Gulf have during the last few months gone far 'ULclx beyond Jtrs usual standard. ♦Note.by Political , -ent*.

W « THE NUCLEUS OF THE ASPIRED ARAB UNION. * The question of the annexation of Kusait to the Kingdom of , Iraq, has during the last few weeks been fuxly treated by tte Arab Press. A further interesting article by Mr. Osar al-Taibi, which recently appeared in the ? Fata- al-Arab w newspaper of Damascus, is als o published below n latest telegrams from Kueait and Bagdad conrirm that the leaders of the Kuwait youth movement have telegra phed pleading that their country should be united with •Iraq; and that a party selected from among themselves, have actually met* the British Political Agent at Kiwait, and demanded from him the realization of their aspirations. The idea of union between the state of Kuwait and its rising neighbour,the Kingdom of f Iraq, is one of very long standing. The people of Kuwait indeed crave for such union, not because they hate their rulers who have always been kind to them, but because they recognize the great advantages that their country will derive following such a union} a nd they appreciate the necessity for greater solidarity among Arab nations, in this age of economic progress, when it will be impossible for small territories, and a divided nation to survive unless they one and all are re-united and fused together by means of one crucible. There is no doubt that the reciprocal interests of both tlm people of Kuwait and the people of ’Iraq are now one and will become steadier with the bonds of close relationship growing stronger day by day. Iraqi nationals own/own propertl®* in Kuwait, and Kuwaitis own properties in ^raq, and each is treated by bis brother, and by the author ities of tbs other country with all respect and regard* Further the Posts and Telegraphs Service has already been unified in the two countries, with much advantage to both* Neverthless if both countries were to be wholly united, the result would be Entirely admirable: For 9 Iraq would benefit from the natural position of Kuwait, seeing that the latter is a good seaport; and Kuwait for her part would benefit from the introduction of a proper administration, the developeiaent of education, and Improved trade, seeing that present restric tions between the two countries would then be abolished* Moreover, such union will be the focus point or nucleus of the great Arab empire, which all Arab peoples are endeavour ing to attain, a movement which has become so Important as to be recognized by Arab kings and rulers, who have commenced singing its praises end trying to realize it* The offer to join Kuwait with 9 Iraq by the A1 Sabah dynasty would be a new and remarkable service to the future Arab nation* Nay it will surpass all others that have gone IaJ before* It is quite a probablity then that Kuwait Should become an 9 Iraqi Emirate, and thet her ruler would be reeog- EbLt nlzed as His Highness the nonc/of Kuwait* And last but not Bair 9 s least the ttancta/aons also could be appointed to hold high positions under the Government of 9 Iraq* The late Shaikh Mubarak has already in the Ottoman period, borne the title of eim-Maqam* This designation, however, did not prevent the Emir Mubarak from being a very good ruler who always strove to promote the welfare of his country* Likewise the conferring of the title of His Highness on the present Emir, in place of the unimportant one of Shaikh of Kuwait, a British protected town, and the fact that the State had taken refuge under the 9 Iraqi Arab standard, would affbrd a unique opportunity for His Highness the $nlr to serve the/- 3 - 212 the rest of Arabia, with his high endowments, and to oo- operate with the kings and leaders of the other Arab countrii The ruler of Kiwait as well as the people are all men who put great store on their nationality and their reli gion, and oannot possibly prefer fore !01 protection to the bonds of nationality and religion. For the rest the annexation of Kuvait to ’Iraq would create a state of tranquility on the Arab ooast of the Gulf; would make the Utelrate secure against any sudden attack and would save her from mall&amp;i foreign influence, and from -a being a centre for plotting intrigues against Arab national is: the East, and especially the Islamic East. Such union would bring about better understanding between Arab countri es, and would offer no opportunity to &amp; foreigners to interfere in the settlement of the differences between Kissalt and Saudi Arabia on the question of 'MusabaV*, or any other questions, on the ground that Kuwait was under British protection. The state of anxiety and confusion now prerailing in europe, calls for deep thinking as to what will be the eventual fate of Arab countries should tiqr continue in their present attitude. When Arab countries are united, Arab peoples will be able to raise their voices higi in the defeno« of their rl&amp;ts and Iheir place in world soole^ty. Then and only then will they be prepared to communicate their mission ing to all the countries of the East, and to become a support/t© pillar in the cause of peace. *Note by the Political Agent . A fabrication of course.Translation of an article from the n Al-lraq' newspaper of Baghdad, No.3958, dated the 19th August 1955. KUWAIT ON Tit£ CRO&amp;iRQADS* IT 13 NO4 TIME j?QR HiSFOimTIONjOa ARE THE . PEOPLE STILL DOLING IN THEIR INDOLENCE? t I was the first person to hear of the proposal which the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presented to His Highness Shaikh Ahmad al Jabir as Sabah before the latter packed off for the British Capital - the proposal which urged the necessity for reforming the situation in Kuwait by re-organizing its Government under the supervision of the British advice* Indeed, I was the first person to hear of this important news; and the way I heard it admitted of no doubt in the truth of it* I, however, did not like then to make it public, out of pity for the name of an Arab country which we regret to see compelled by a foreign power to refom Its om affairs. Those at the helm ought of their own accord to carry out the reformation, so as not to leave room for any political aspirant to aohleve his ends. However, now that the news about which I am going to write, has appeared In the daily newspapers, and the Government of Kuwait has leapt silent on the report and made no oomments, and has furthermore not even bothered to deny it, I have no choice but to put in my werd on this serious event in the political history of Kuwait.. I am particularly constrained to do this because I, as my readers know, and as His Hiness the Shaikh also knows in particular, &lt;as the first person who discussed Kuwait politics seriously,- 2 - 214 seriously, and wrote a great, a rary great deal in connection with the necessity of reforming the affairs and resources of Kuwait. The result of my writings, however, appears to have had no effect whatsoever. In 1922 there arose in Kuwait a progressive nation al spirit, kindled by unique intelligence, and enhanced by diligent reading of newspapers and magazines. The youth of Kuwait then had a voice which resounded throughout the Arabian world, and on which most of the leading Arab newspapers made comments - a voice which demanded reforms, and lamented the negligence of those in power.Those who read newspapers wereT aware that there were Ku\?aiti writers,whose pens had a good press in the colurans of Iraqi newspapers. Among all,however, this paper was the leader. She carried the torch of reform ation, and was a resort for Kuwaiti free-thinkers, and in her columns were published the products of their pens, which caus ed hearts to bleed and made not only the merciful but also every hard-hearted man to shed tears. That auspicious movement went on for some years, and people hoped that it would bring the best of results to the State of Kuwait, which Nature has endowed with a unique position in Arabia, and whose importance will shortly emerge. Moreover, the abovementloned movement rose just after the accession of shaikh Ahmad who was famous for his sympathy for reformation, and for his bitter criticism of those in power, because they were leading Kuwait in her ruin. Ill luck, however, refused to leave Kuwait, and insisted that it should remain a target for those who have ambitions and ends to achieve, and for those who try to fish in turbid water, and cannot fill their pockets except when disorder exists and anarchy prevails.iiavery soon the reformers were driven cut or persecuted, -ome of them iMeed were compelled to leave their country; and others suffered of all kinds of trouble. Newspaper readers were very badly treated, and writers were warned that thtiy must- 3 - 215 they must oease from writing anything in the Ira(A Press. The n .sl Iraq” newspaper was banned from Kuwait, and punishments were inflicted upon those who smuggled it into Kuwait. Thus ami by such means the plan was laid to Kill the reform movement in Kuwait. In this the plan to a certain degree succeeded, although Its after effects were pernicious to Kuwait - a fact which suggests itself to everyone who possesses the power of thinking. iiyl the reform movement in Kuwciit received its coup de grace and fell a victim to shameful ignorance. Upon her grave, reformers shed tears of blood, and their lamentation was deep - That was because she died, or to put it more clearly, was killed at a time when the whole world was racing in the course of progress by leaps and bounds in the same way that electricity was taking the place at* other forms of power. Accordingly, Kuwait has remained standing in its bedouin mentality, bereft from reform© both in her administra tion and in education. As to the aisoraei' that previilis in an jmlrate whose state of affairs is auohi as to the distress that comes as an inevitable result of suoh a state of affairs - these both are matters which we nea4 not bother to substantiate or comiflent on. Y,e were afraid indeed as well as other writers, who had criticised the state of affairs in Kuwait, when they saw the plans which the British rolltlcal Heslaent has lately unfolded. Ihe blow has fallen, anu I say so with much sorrow and grief. But even at this stage the danger can be averted, as a little of thiwcing over the Bresen* situation will induce the Government of Kuwait itself to carry out the reformation* Now, in this neighbouring Kingdom ’iraqi, for which wa bear sincere affection, and whose progress affects- 4 - 216 affeots us diraatly, there exist many persons who are prepared to cooperate with their brethren of Kuwait and set right the mischiefs that are killing her. It is only by reformation that we can keep out those trying to violate our rights. However resolute we may be f it is of no avail for us merely to assume a negative attitude. This la my sincere advice which I solemnly offer to His Highness the ^mir of Kuwait, and am all confidence that he will be so wise as to avoid the peril of foreign tyranny, into which Bahrain has already fallen, and for which she suffered, in Major Daly’s time, the most terrible and distressing results.

THE aHAB MIRATEB ON THE (KJLF AND THE IB CONNECTIONS rf ITH THE BBITIoH GOVERNMENT. The editor of eastern politics in the M A1 iluqattam” leading newspaper (of Egypt) couuaenting on the Tmir of Kuwait’s journey to England, said:- w Those who are acquainted below the surface with the true state of affairs, confirm that the Emir’s journey to England was in response to an invitation frcm the Oil Company which recently obtained a coriffiessionto exploit Oil in his Emirate. That, they maintain, was the real cause of the Emir’s journey. The Emir travelled to Baghdad and proceeded to Mosul and Nesibin, from where he took the Orient Express to Europe via Istanbul. It is, however, understood that the ;.mir during his stay at London, saw a specialist about a disease he had in his mouth; and that ho also met certain members of the Government who received him with honour and sincere pleasure, as is their custom with all prominent visitors to their country. No chfinr.e io olitlos. further, we have learnt from a reliable soui’ce that there is no truth in the rumour that tho Emir tried to induce the Colonial Office in London to instruct their representative in the Persian Gulf to abandon the enforce ment of the plan, which consisted in the desire to limit the jurisdiction allowed to the Persian Gulf Ghaikhs, seeing that neither the Colonial Office, nor the Resident himself has such a plan. The British authorities, it appears, do not propose to bring about any change orJlM) - 2 - 218 change or alteration in the political systems of the Gulf Emirates at present. On lie other hand everyone of the Arab Emirates on the Persian Gulf has got its own system which differs from that of the others, and the relations of each with the British Government^re different from the relations of its neighbours# dumber of the Pairates# The Emirates are eight in number. Thffier names are as follows:- Muscat, Has al Khaimah, Gharga, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait# They are all situated on the western coast of the Gulf# The eastern coast belongs to Iran, and is free from any foreign influence. The Chief Pirates# The largest of these Emirates are three: Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait. The first lies at the southern end of the Gulf, and is adjacent to iiind, while Kuwait lies at the northern end of it, and borders upon Nejd and Iraq. As to Bahrain, it is composed of a group of islands, the largest of which are Manama, Muharraq, which include the towns of Hifa*, Hidd and Budaiyi*. As to the rest of the Emirates, i.e. Has al Khairaa, Sharga, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Qatar: These are smaller, less important and losser in rank than the other three mentioned above* The population in some of them do not exceed a few hundreds living in small areas. £ Tho r alat ions c£ ©aoh of ttiB tiir.© prinoip&amp;l with Oreat Britain, ar© different from the relations of its neigibours; and the first to have relations with the British, were Uusfiat and Bahrain. In 1861 a treaty was concluded between the ^hallch of Bahrain and the Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, in which the Resident undertook- 3 undortiook to iroserve th© security of the Shaikh’s territory and to repel from it any incursions, and in return the Shaikh promised to abandon the equipment of ships and troops. Another treaty was concluded in 1800 between Shaikh ’Isa bin Khalifa (father of the present shaikh) and the British Gorernraent, in which the shaikh of Bahrain under took not to conclude a treaty with, or grant a concession to any other Government, without first obtaining the approval of His Majesty’s Gcvemruant. Nevertheless, in 1923 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, deposed the Shaikh of Bahrain, the same shaikh who ratified the Treaty of Protection, and instituted his son (the present Bhaikh) in his place* In this 't O way, the Resident managed seize the rej^s of real authority which is exercised by him upto this day. Kuwait came under British protection in 1913, when consequent to a family trouble its iair Uhaikh Mubarak-as- sabah (grandfather of the present jimir) resorted to asking assistance of the British Gcvaraaent. The Turks were then threatening. A British warship was at once sent to the waters of Kuwait. After the Great War a British Agency was also located at Kuwait. But the British Governaent do not interfere directly in the internal affairs of this Smlrate, as they do in Bahrain. As regards iv^usoat whose rulers bear the title of 6 ultans: This State was the greatest and most important power in the Gulf. But since 1864 the British started interfering with its affairs, until in 1913 they succeeded in concluding a treaty with her, under which she came under their protection. This event led to a series of internal disturbances, which divided the country into two sections: (a) the coasts, with Muscat as Capital, which submitted to the Al Sa’id, a British protected dynasty; and (b) the interior which preserved its independence, and established an Iraamate at 'Nazwa'. The British representative at Muscat- 4 220 Muscat is designated a 'Councillor', but in reality is almost the actual ruler# This is what can today be said in a brief like this, about the position of the Persian Culf Arab jairates and their Government systems. I write these few words, in the hope that they may remove all differences and contentions now existing among them, which action is essential if they want to unite their affairs?Mrcv&gt;~ l Urt*** ■o**!

(c) The Jerusalem paper 'Palestine' under date 14th August 1935 published an article quoted as emanating from Baghdad called, 'The people of Kuwait aspire to be united with Iraq, but the British Government attempts to extend her protection over that country'* All three articles are obviously inspired, and would appear to aim at (a) discrediting the Shaikh, (b) making out that His Majesty’s Government’s policy is machiavellian in the extieae, and has for its final object the turning of the Arab maritime States into British Protectorates, (c) the appealing to the youth of Kuwait (end incidentally also other Arab states-)to work for union with Ira; where they would be safe and not be under a foreign yoke* As may be supposed such articles do much harm, as no doubt they are intended to do.

The Residency, Bushire, 12 th January, 1935. Could you please refer to paragraph 3 of Ogilvie- Forbes* demi-official letter to Rendel, No.280/12/34, dated the 6 th October 1934, on the subject of pilots for the Shatt-al Arab, a copy of which came to me in the course of official routine, and which I kept by me until 1 could discuss it with Dickson during my recent visit to Kuwai t. 2. The paragraph in question ran as follows: (I quote it for ready reference) H The next best thing mi ~ht be uwaitis, who are sea-minded, but the objection to employing them is that so many are indentured in the pearl diving trade under conditions almost of slavery. If they abandoned that calling in favour of piloting, they would be made to suffer in various ways'*. 5 . I*m afraid 1 must take some exception to Ogilvie- Forbes' remarks. In the first place this hit at Kuwait seems to me rather gratuitous in the context in which it appears. quite apart from the Kuwaiti divers, as Ogilvie- Forbes must know there are many Kuwaiti dhows the crews of which are fine seamen, and who wouldcertainly be quite willing to become pilots provided they were offered sufficient pay. There was no reason therefore, as far as I can see, for the question of the divers to be brought up. 4 . in the second place Ogilvie-Forbes* statement that the livers work under conditions almost of slavery is not borne out by actual facts which are as follows, as supplied/ His Excellency Sir F. H.Humphrys, G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., K.B.E. , C. I. E. , His Majesty's Ambassador, Bagdad.A i ( 4 )/ 235 (X1&amp; 2 . supplied to me in a report by Dickson. Dickson during his time at Kuwait, some six years new, has had no complaints from divers of bad treatment, though there have been ample opportunities for divers to maKe such complairts. &amp;ost diving cases are heard by the Shaikh himself, or his deputy Shaikh Abdulla, the remainder of the cases being tried in a local Court under one Abu Gammaz, a retired dhow Captain. The Shaikh, on wljom tne main responsibility rests for the conduct of the diving, whatever his faults may be, is a humane man, and Abu Gamma* has the confidence of the sea-faring community. moreover motives of expediency enter into the treatment of divers quite apart from those of humanity or justice. Nothing is easier for a diver, if he feels he is being harshly treated or harassed over his debts, than to cross the frontier into Bejd or Iraq. Consistent bad treatment of divers would result in wholesale desertions, which would certainly not suit the Shaikh, and such desertions do not occur. As a matter of fact the diving profession seems to be popular as thousands of individuals come to Kuwait yearly from Nejd and Iraq to try their luck on the banks. Xhe following are some details as to how the business side of t e diving is conducted; (1) The season lasts about 4 months in every year, i.e. from June to September. Before a diver goes to the Banks he receives from his boat captain an advance of money (fixed by the Shaikh for the whole diving fraternity), for himself and his family. Similarxy on return from the Banxs the diver gets another advance to help him through until the next season. Both advances are about Rs.50/-« (2) The above advances are recovered from the diver's snare of the catch, but if the boat is unlucky and the catch poor, then under the diving law the debt is carried forward until next year. No interest is charged. (3) By the Shaikh 1 s orders the employers, or actual owners of ooates, Wiio sta^ on shore v»nen tne uiving is in progress, have to see as far as possible that the divers’ families do not get into difficulties when their men folk are at sea.236 3 (4) The son of a deceased diver can only be made to ork off his fathers debts by a creditor if he - the son - wishes to follow in his father's footsteps as a diver. Should the son decide to follow some other profession he is free to do so and the creditor has no claim on his services. (5) The property of the widow of a deceased diver cannot be seized for debt provided it is registered in her name. 6 . 1 certainly do not wish to pitch my case too high, or to maintain that everything is perfect with regard to Kuwait diving, or that cases of individual hardship do not occur. But such cases are not peculiar to Kuwait; ai^ over the world, even in JJng^and, labour conditions are far from perfect. Much poverty no doubt exists amongst the Kuwait divers, but one has to remember that of late years the bottom has dropped out of the pearl market. The divers themselves, too, working in a trade hich is in tne nature of a gamble on the catch are feckless folk and readily allow themselves to drift into debt, while 1 do not suppose that creditors in Kuwait are any more tender-hearted than those elsewhere. On the other hand unlike their colleagues in most other countries they ^re not allowed to extort interest. 7. In conclusion it appears to methat Ogilvie-Forbes' statement that the Kuwait divers work 'under conditions almost of slavery' gives quite a wrong impression, .end I cannot help feeling that it is somewhat unfortunate that, before making this statement in a demi-official letter which has had official circulation, he did not apply either to Dickson or myself for further information on the subject. I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe and Laithwaite. Yours sincerely, (Sgd. ) T. C. FOWLS,/.vL- INDIA OFFICE, LON SON t ci.W. 1 237 F.0.603/05 idtli Jiaiuury 1935.

PEARL KING WITH 84 WIVES COMING TO LONDON FOR THE JUBILEE T HE richest sheik in the world—Abdullah Hen .Tasini, Sheik ot Elcatai, in Eastern Arabia, is com ing to London lor the Silver Jubilee. He is the pearl king. The finest gems in the Rue de la Paix and Bond-street come from his flS A house is being found for him on the outskirts of London. He s a devout Moslem: he prefers not to share a roof with infidels. The sheik has eighty-four women in his harem. It is ^ custom f °r his nobles to P res « nt ^ xt tht new bride at each Bairam—the Moslem festival. He is the only ruling monarch who openly registers the / act . owns slaves. He has four thousand, negroes, engaged in the pearl fisheries. PILES OF PEARLS They dive for roughly sixpence a day, and fetch up gems sometimes worth hundreds of pounds. They man the 800 pearling vessels this Arabian magnate owns. He lives in a castle guarded nigln and day by negroes with drawiHy swords. His Court is composed of astrologers, jesters, dancing girls and dervishes alleged to be gifted with nronhecv Great piles of pearls are heaped before his throne each even- ins for his inspection. ., He can boil an egg by burying it in The sand outside his dining room for two minutes.

Ti Special to “The People” HERE is gloom in the harem-home of Abdullah Ben Jasim, Sheik of Elca- tar, in Eastern Arabia, staunch friend of Britain and ruler of one of the world’s most roman tic States. The eyes of the 84 wives of the Sheik are clouded with trouble. ' For within a few weeks the Sheik is leaving Elcatar, leaving his Arabian Nights Castle, which is watched over by stern-visaged eunuchs, and the lofty turrets of which leap upwards to the sky. The Sheik is coming to London, to be present at the Jubilee celebrations in honour ot King George V. And he is leaving his wives behind him. And while their thoughts will be with him through all the weeks that he will spend in Britain and on the Continent of Europe, they will count the hours, these beautiful Eastern damsels, until the longed-for day of his return. GLITTERING GEMS You may search the pages of romantic fiction and never come across so dazzling a tale as this real-life one of the “ Pearl King ” of the East, whose priceless pearl fisheries yield up glitter ing gems which sparkle in the tiaras of duchesses, in the crowns of kings and queens, in the bracelets and necklaces of beautiful women in every corner of the world. Thousands of negro slaves toil in the pearl fisheries owned by this picturesque ruler, whose merest word means life or death for his subjects- “ He is indeed a remarkable man, the Sheik of Elcatar,” an intimate friend of the famous Arabian potentate told me, “ and a most upright, lovable personage. ‘‘Those who have been privileged to visit his court have returned with breath-taking stories of its fabulous magnificence. “ Every evening the Sheik sits in state surrounded by his ravishingly beautiful wives—he is presented by his courtiers with a new bride at every festival of Bairam, the most important ceremonial event in the Moslem calen dar. “ He has decided that he w r ill not bring any of them with him to London. But he will bring one or two favourite courtiers and a vast suite of officers and officials.” / N u w yimdia omc*;, r'' ZAtti September 1954. J4r bear Belgrave, I am sorry to have been so very long in letting you know about the article for The Times which you sent me in your letter of the 5th August, but there was first some aelay in disposing of it here ana we receiveb the Foreign Office comments only on 18th September. 2. I now write to say that, subject to the suggestions below, none of which, as you will see, seems likely to necessitate any very marked alteration, we should see no objection to publication. (*) Page 1 * M would suggest tout it would be better not to state that the Gulf 'is attracting unusual attention' for 'political reasons'. It might encourage undesirable speculation as to what those reasons are ana we think that it would be better that the article should be hung on some other peg, e.g. a reference to your Bahrein pearl-diving article which appeared last month, or failing that, some anodyne reference to the development of the air route. (ii) We are not anxious to encourage the French ana the Dutch to fly down the Arab littoral, ana we su^o^st, therefore, omitting in the rmLaale of C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq. this/241 - 2 - Page 1 conta.) f (ill) tliis pa^e the words 'which, iroiii the point of view*••the western siae of the Gulf'. In the last line of this page. For your own Info mat ion, we have made some play, in refusing to facilitate flights down the Arab coast by foreign aircraft, of the difficulties which might arise if an aeroplane were to crash in the Hinterland, and we do not, therefore, want to over emphasise the familiarity of the Arabs with the aeroplanes. Would it be possible to confine your reference to air-mlnaeuness to at any rate the major States? (iv) Page 2 . We would suggest the following redraft of the opening sentence:- *At Koweit there is a natural landing ground, which may one day be developed, just inside the walls which protect the town from the desert. At present the British air liners occasionally call here, but only stay for about half-an- hour; while at Bahrein they only wait an hour, which does not give the passengers much time to see these places, which are both full of interest'. ( v ) Page 3 . We suggest the omission of the sentences: 'and It is owing to Britisn support that this little state was not engulfed by its more powerful neighbours'; and 'Bahrein has now become the most im ortant of the Arab States in the Persian Gulf' (which, as the Foreign office say, is true; but why wnet Persian appetite?). (vi) page 5 . The date on which the first tanker sailed will have to be modified. At the end of the same pa^e, we are not very happy about the references to slavery. $hat you say is, of course, quite correct; but we/ms) 242 «■» 3 we are anxious to avoid unnecessary discussion with the anti-slavery societies. &amp; reword: 'But on the mainl?ina it has not yet entirely disappeared and not infrequently slaves escape and seek refuge*, etc. (vii) Finally, the Foreign Office are a little doubtful about the last sentence of all, which says that the Arab rulers *aepend on the protection of Great Britain to preserve for them their independence ana the sovereignty of their states*, on the ground that this might suggest ratner too much that the jheikhs were merely puppets of British imperialism. They suggest that some more anodyne phrase about their long and frienuiy association with us, or their respect for us as the result of our putting aown tneir Internecine wars ana former habits of piracy, mi^ht be preferable. I do not think we feel very’ strongly about this here, but we might have a woru about it tomorrow? Yours sincerely.

Jly dear Walton, I am sorry to have been so long in replying to Laithwaite 1 s letter to me of September 1st aoout Belgrave s proposed article on the Persian Gulf. 2. The article is for the most part entirely descriptive, and I doubt whether we should be quite justified in going so far as to veto its publication for of drawing too much attention to the Guli. On tue others hand, there are certain passages in it which I think might well be modified. The onening sentence is a case in point, since it states in so many words that the Gulf is ,f attracting unusual attention 1 ’ for '’nolitical reasons ,and might, it seems to me, encourage undesirable speculation o.s to what those reasons are. It would be better therefore I think that the article should be hung on some other peg,e.£,. a reference to the Bahrain pearl diving article which appeared some time in August, or failing that some anodyne reference to the development of the air route. ! P'i?L 1 19 SEP 1934 INDIA OFFICE 3.... . J.C.Walton Esq. ,C.B.;GC.* 244 3. Another point which occurs to us is on page 2 where there are several references to the 'normal” call of the air liners at Koweit. You may rememher that in December 1922 (see enclosure in our letter No. E 6541/93/91 of December 29th of that year), we were at pains to point out to the Dutch Minister that the Koweit landing was purely exnerimental and that landing facilities could not therefore be granted to foreigners. It would therefore seem preferable to rewrite the opening sentence on page 2 somewhat as follows:- I ”At Koweit there is a natural landing ground, which may 'one day be developed, just inside the walls which 'protect the town from the desert. At present the 'British air liners occasionally call here, but only stay 'for about half-an-hour, while at Bahrain they only wait 'an hour, which does not give the passengers much time 'to see these places which are both full of interest'. 4 # i think it might perhaps be well to omit the passage on rage 3 saying that it is only owing to British j support that Koweit has not been engulfed by its more powerful neighbours. Similarly I would omit the passage a little lower down to the effect that Bahrain has now become the most important of the Arab States in the Persian245 Persian Gulf. It is true - “but why whet Persian appetite? The only other passage about which I am doubtful is the final sentence of all saying that the Arab Rulers ’’depend on the ’brotection of Great Britain to preserve for them their ’’independence and the sovereignty of their States”. I thin:' this may suggest rather too much that the Arab Sheikhs are simply the puppets of British Imperialism, and some more anodyne T&gt;hrase about their long and friendly association with us, or their respect for us as a result of our putting down their internecine wars and former habits of piracy, | might be preferable.

I am sorry that it has caused you so much trouble and I thank you for your help in the matter. Tne Central Asian Journal has published the original article which I sent them some months ago, I wrote it in Bahrain and consulted Loch about sending it, I showed it to you shortly after I came home and left a copy with you. I am now rather nervous as it contains some mention of shortcomings in the past. You may remember that when I showed it to you I said that I wished I could get something of that sort into the Times as a contradiction of that most unfair article in the Sphere, at that time I had no idea that I was going to meet Barrington-Ward. I have heard some rather strange rumours lately about the Standard Oil Company selling the Bahrain concession to another Company. One of the people who mentioned this was an American \'\s^ called Stevens who is something to say to the people who are interested in Kuwait. I am sure if there is any truth in this that you will have heard about it, but I thought it might possibly interest you Yours sincerely.oeen sui licent Indnoement to maico nen become iivero in the haruohips or the work* npite of Divera are paid no wage a oat they reclve a oixnre in the i -'foi’ito 01 ' tno -easonf dive .‘0 are antitXed to tv-ico tno anoint which is paid to a pulier os tue work of a iver is more arinoas* Zac re re several ai. iVeent liviie; systems ani all of then or© very ancient* Usually the captain o~ the ooat oorrora i.oncy f on . ° i.»er chant on shore to e^aip rail provision his boat a hi to pay the two annual advances which x\: nahe to the divers at the' beginning of the season and half w y through the off season* At the end 01 the season ta. po '.clo ore sold, the expense of the expedition are aoeucted f tae c ytoin ta-.cen one fifth of the pforit ahi the romainuer is divine i amonj the iiver ■ a.u the pullers f out the here- le^c.ant cha • 0 interest on the money which he lent to the captain, an -, the livera pay i .tvrest on the money advance 1 to them by the captain. 1 re cently the captain himself finances the aoat, c;v aging no intr ant, b t in ret &lt;rn - M o- .iv- Livers n right to x 5 'drc** . rl hi] i t 305l Iona t rent 1 price, in thin vyotem, which has incrorvied latel th ro re no out standing debts letter o: tie Mo.don many merchants, w o u. etip^na of taking into v. rice on condition t nt the enu ov the season, the result is t-i.e same, inot th 1 livorsi According to 1 ic strict w the taking o ; into rent is focoi ii,~n b ut 1 mostly in ’ice not in cash, rvoii the Gt oy agreeing to ham over 100 bigs of t ie no rower returns 10 bags of rice at In this try con cienoes arc sstiofiod and The geaeral system o the dvl ig system ia a fair one, if it is strictly adhere, to, out in cour.&gt;e ox time it f.g ae r ted ana scricur ibu ~&gt;c c 'opt 1 • »o i i».

LAITHWAIT3. C* Dalrymple Belgrave, fsq., 6, Seville Terrace,260 ITiie general principle of the diving s/oteia is a fair one, provided that it io strictly ad acred to, hut in course of tine it degenerated and various abuses crept into it. Divers were cheated mid ill used and when they complained to the tribunal of Arab merchants and captains who dealt with disputes between the divers and their captains they met with small sympathy. Unlimited Interest was charged by almost all the merchants, though the taking of interest is contrary to the Moslem faith. In order to avoid tile otl-^na of receiving interest many merchants, who transacted much of their business in rice, not in cash, would agree to hand over one hundred bags of rice on condition that the borrower returned one hundred and twenty bags at the end of the season* In this way consciences were satisfied and the result was the same. Tho divers were debited with provisions at exorbitantly high rates, they never knew how much was paid for the pearls which they had found and being almost all illiterate they had no means of checking their complicated accounts with their captains. Youth© were induced to become divers by the offer of a loan and once they accepted it they were bound to dive until they had paid off the original and the subsequent loans. W cn a diver died his children became responsible for their father’s diving debt and as soon aa the sons were old enough to dive they went out with the fleet/* s J fleet. Conditions in the crowded boats were very hard and there were no arrangements for medical attention. VJTien divers fell ill they were treated by the captain who employed the usual Arab method of branding with a hot iron, an effective treatment in the case of certain illnesses but useless in most others. The Arab has an ingrained instinct for gambling and there was always the chance of making a fortune by belonging to a boat which found a really big pearl, he is naturally improvident and leaves the future to the Almighty as long as he has cash in hand. These characteristics and the lack of other occupation has always been and is still sufficient inducement to make men become divers in spite of the well known hardships of the work./ 262 INDIA OFFICE, MITEHALL, 3.#. 1.

Although in the past we have been generally averse to publicity in the press on matters concerning the Persian Gulf, there seems on the whole to be little objection to the article on Living submitted by t Mr. Belgrave and, in view of the inaccurate matter which has already been published on this subject,(see for example the submission at PZ.7537/33 about an article in the “Sphere”) there seems to be some advantage in allowing Mr. Belgrave»s article to appear in 'The Times”. It might indeed be a little awkward to refuse permission in view of the fact that ”The Times” have already been given a copy of the article. In these circumstances we might I think inform Mr. Belgrave that there is no objection to its publication, pointing out the slight inaccuracy in regard to the date when the Sheikhs of Bahrein first entered into Treaty relations with the British Government ••The Times” have also suggested to Mr. Belgrave that he should write another article about conditions generally in the Persian Gulf - ”the kind of article that would give the public some idea of what goes on there, of the various interests which are there competing and, broadly, of British activities in that area’i This is a much more doubtful suggestion from our point of view and reference is invited to the papers at PZ.2666/33. It will be remembered that the Political Resident suggested that it would be a good thing if the affairs of the Arab coast of the Gulf could be'•written up' from our point of view in some responsible _ journal in tbis country* but tbat we took the view that on the whole it would be best to avoid courting publicity unless it was forced upon us.

I now write to say that subject to the modification suggested below we see no objection to publication, but think it would be better that publication should be anonymous. 2. 7/e have in the past, as I think you know, had a goo a deal of trouble with the Anti-Slavery Society, etc. about the conditions of divers in Bahrein ana we are very reluctant to expose surface on this if we can avoid it. 7/e would like to suggest in these circumstances tne omission of para. 6 of your note, beginning ^Thougn too- general princ iploana onaing *aioa art ;ve feel that tne re is some risk that its publication might either exp© expose us to criticism on the ground that we had not interfered at an earlier date, and[might indeed be used by tne Persians^as a handle against us. The paragraph in question might perhaps be replaced by a sentence to the general/ • 2531 5000 2.34general effect that while there hah in the past been serious abuses in connection with the diving arrangemen at Bahrein, these hah now been remehieh, thanks to the close inheres taken in the matter by the Kuler, with the active support of the Britis Government. 3. For rather the same reasons we would suggest the omission of the last sentence of paragraph 7. 4. On a furtner minor point, there seems to be a small slip on page 2 about the date of the establishment of treaty relations with Bahrein. The first treaty was in 1820, when the rulers of Bahrein subscribed to the 'General Treaty' prescribing abstention from piracy, slave traffic, etc., and peace with the British Government. 5. We are rather more doubtful about the suggestion that you might write a general article for 'The Times' about Gulf affairs. Besides the possibility of difficulties with the Persians I about anything which might be said in such an article on the subject of |Bahrein, there might be other 1international difficulties. For example, it seems undesirable to say very mucn about Ghargah or the air facilities there owing to the fact that we are still excluding foreign air/267 3. Draft Paper.

Recently, owing to economic conditions in Europe and America and the increased production of cultured pearls in Japan, this ancient industry has been severely affected. Eight years ago the value of the pearls exported from Bahrain during one season was estimated at two million pounds sterling, during the last two or three years the value has fallen to less than one fifth of this amount. About five years ago one single pearl of unrivalled size, shape and colour was sold in Bahrain for £15,000, during the last two or three years no single pearl has been sold locally for more than £3,000. Though cultured pearls were first introduced from Japan more than fifteen years ago it is only during the last three years that they have flooded the market ot the west. They are manufactured by the introduction of foreign matter into the oyster shell which is then replaced in the sea and in course of time the oyster surrounds the grit with a thin skin of real pearl. A whole necklace of cultured pearls can usually be distinguished but it is difficult to detect cultured pearls when they are mixed with real pearls. Their cheapness and their resemblance to real pearls commend them to people who cannot afford to buy the article; a real pearl costs2 277 about thirty times the price of a cultured pearl of similar size and appearance, but real pearls last for centuries.^^^u^ The centre 1 of the diving industry ahd^the ^cMef^market t of the Gulf is the Bahrain archipelago, a little independent Arab state which is protected against external aggression by Great Britain who has been in treaty relations with the ruling shaikhs of Bahrain since they took possession of the islands in 1783. Although the richest pearl banks are round about Bahrain the Shaikh receives no direct income from pearls, the revenue of the State is derived mainly from customs duties upon imports whose value vaties according to the success of the diving season, which lasts from the middle of May until the end of September, while the water is warm. On a day appointed by the Shaikh^, which is announced by public proclamation, the pearling fleet^consisting of about 500 great sailing dhows, very like Roman galleys, sets out from Bahrain to the pearl banks where they are joined by fleets from the lesser Gulf ports. Until they clear the harbour the boats are propelled by heavy oars, each one pulled by two men, who sing the song of the pearlers as they row. Often the fleet returns at night when the moon and the tide are full. The sound of the chanting is carried across the still water to the town and the sight of hundreds of white sails, some of them coloured orange by the light of the fires burning on the decks, is one of the most picturesque278 (5^ 3 A &lt; in the world. Mechanical apparatus of any kind is forbidden and the methods of diving have not changed since they were described by 14th century travellers. Each diver wears a clip like a clothes peg to close his nostrils, leather sheathes pro tect his fingers and enable him to wrench the shells from the rocks under the sea, and each of his big toes is by a similar sheath. He descends on a rope which has a stone weight attached tasodab which is hauled up when he reaches the bottom. Round his neck is slung a string bag, which he fills with shells, attached to the rope with which his comrade, the puller, draws him up again when he gives the signal. Divers remain below the surface about 1-| minutes and they des cend about thirty times in one day, some times to a depth of 14 fathoms. The work is strenuous and conditions are hard but the divers on the whole are not unhealthy and many of them show unusually fine muscular development. The shells are heaped on deck during the day and opened in the evening under the vigilant eye of the captain who puts them away in his sea chest and no diver knows whether it is his shell that contained a pearl. The shells are thrown back into the sea and the divers believe the oysters feed upon the empty shells, they think too that pearls are formed by drops of rain which are caught by the oysters at night. Divers are paid no wages but they receive a share in-— —— ■279 4 OL ^6 the profits of the season, divert entitled to twice tie n amount which is paid to a puller. There are several dif ferent diving systems and all of them are very ancient. Usually the boat captain borrows money from a merchant on shore to equip and provision his boat and to pay the two annual advances which are made to the divers, at the begin ning of the season and half way through the off season. At the end of the season the pearls are sold, the expenses of the expedition are deducted, the captain takes one fifth of the profit and the remainder is divided among the divers and pullers, but the shore merchant charges interest on the money which he lent to the captain, and the divers pay interest on the money advanced to them by their captain. Frequently the captain himself finances the boat, charging no interest, but in return for this he receives the share of five divers and has the right to acquire the pearls at 20$ less than the current market price; in this system, which has increased lately, there are no outstanding debts. Though the general principle of the diving system is a fair one it had become almost a condition of slavery until a few years ago. Divers were illused anu. cheated, they had no redress except by appeal to a court of merchants and captains who were notoriously unsympathetic towards divers. Unlimited interest was charged, divers were deoited with provisions at fabulous prices, they had no means of checking their afttmarts280 and they were never allowed to know the prices paid for their pearls. Boys were induced to become divers by the offer of a loan and when they accepted it they were bound to their boat captains for life, frequently they were trans ferred from captain to captain and sometimes handed over to shopkeepers in discharge of debts. During the off season they worked as unpaid servants in the houses and gardens of the captains and merchants. When a diver died his children became responsible for their father’s debt, and the interest upon it, as soon es the boys were old enough to dive they were sent out with the fleet. They were thrashed, tortured and frequently punished by being left all night in the sea at the end of the rope and as they received no medical attention many of them died at sea. In 1923 Shaikh Hamed bin Isa A1 Khalifah became Deputy Ruler in place of his aged father, who died two years ago after reigning for sixty years. With the approval of the British Government Shaikh Hamed carried out drastic reforms throughout the diving system and since then he has never relaxed his efforts to maintain the improved conditions by severely punishing in his courts any infringement of his diving rules. Interest on money advanced was reduced to a reasonable rate and the amount of the advances was re stricted by law, a simple system of diving accounts was instituted and every diver compelled to keep a little281 account book showing his debt to his captain,Shu these amounts are checked every season by a staff of clerks employed by the Government. A certain percentage oi divers, chosen by the crew, must witness the sale of pearls by the captain and when a diver dies his debt diss with him. An Indian doctor, employed by the Government, tours the pearl banks in a motor launch during the season and sick men are brought ashore to the Government hospital. The diving rules and the system of accounts now form pari, of the curriculum at the Government schools. The reforms were violently opposed by the merchants and captains ana when they were first introduced the illiterate divers regarded them with sullen indifference, having been told that the new rules would not benefit them. Now however they are beginning to appre ciate the improved conditions. It was greatly owing to the support of the Moslem religious leaders that the Shaikh was enabled to carry out the reforms. Today most of the older men are still heavily in debt, and will never clear themselves but the new generation of divers owe comparatively small amounts and their debts now represent money which they actually The buying and selling of pearls is done in the neigh bourhood of certain coffee shops in the two chief towns of Bahrain, Manama and Muharraq, and in the handsome offices and houses of the big pearl merchants who come every season7 0^ 2S2 usually travelling by air, from Paris, India, Persia and Arabia. Though the climate of the Gulf is notorious living conditions in Bahrain have been much improved since the introduction of electricity. It is the merchants who make the big profits not the captains and the divers. The famous pearl which was sold on shore for £15,000 was bought from the boat at sea for £6000. &amp;*ost of the sales are transacted through brokers who go from buyer to buyer carrying their pearls knotted in a little twist of scarlet twill. A stranger seeing two Arab dealers bargaining would suppose that they were fighting; they tear their headcloths from their heads, seize each other by the beard and often one of them rushes frantically from the room, but returns a moment later to make another oiler. Ix many people are present and two men ao not want their prices to be heard they adopt a different method. Each places his hand under a cloth and they indicate the amounts by signs; a grasp of the whole hand means 1000, a touch on the palm means 500, a pressure of one finger means loO, ana. a pinch on the joint of a finger represents 10. One of the strangest facts in the pearl trade is the ability ol the pearl mei- chants to recognise pearls even if they have not seen them for many years; in addition to this they keep track of all the important peails which are sold all over the world.INDEXED I * 4.

CONFIDENTIAL. May 24, 1^3f Q Q Section 2^ * [E 3377/845/93] No. 1. Sir F. Humphrys to Sir John Simon.—(Received May 24.) (No. 258.) Sir, Bagdad, May 9, 1934. I HAVE the honour to report that a law amending the Press Law of the 9th July, 1933, has been passed by the Iraqi Parliament and came into force on the 8th May—the date of its publication in the Arabic edition of the official Government Gazette. This measure is intended to strengthen the Govern ment’s control over the local press and to render it easier for them to suspend or suppress offending newspapers and other publications. 2. I enclose herein a translation( x ) of the amending law as finally passed by the two Houses of the Iraqi Parliament, together with a memorandum^) on the changes which it introduces in the existing law. The existing Press Law (No. 57, of 1933), which was enacted on the 9th July, 1933, during Rashid Ali’s administration, is available to you in the English edition of the Iraqi official Government Gazette No. 39 of the 24th September, 1933. For convenience of reference I attach one copy of the English text of this law( 1 ). 3. The recent history of the Iraqi Press Law, leading up to its present amendment, is of interest since it shows how all Iraqi Cabinets, however liberal the expressed views of their individual members when in opposition, are compelled to give themselves wide powers to curb the exuberance of local journalism. In 1932 Nuri Pasha’s Government were so persistently attacked that they were obliged to pass an amending law (Law No. 56, of the 2nd June, 1932), which tightened up very considerably the Press Law of 1931. Their action was bitterly criticised by the extreme Nationalist Opposition, and when the latter came into office they fulfilled their promises by repealing the existing 1931 law as it stood amended by Nuri Pasha’s law of 1932. This proved to be mere face-saving on the part of Rashid Ali and his friends since, in the Press Law of the 9th July, 1933, which they passed in its place, they proceeded to give themselves powers almost as arbitrary and restrictive as those conferred by the old law. Nevertheless, the Madfai Government have now found the 1933 law inadequate and full of loopholes which permit local trouble makers to evade official control and to continue their scurrilous propaganda. Consequently, they have been obliged to strengthen Rashid Ali’s law by the present amending law, which reintroduces several provisions contained in Nuri Pasha’s law of 1932, which were omitted by the Nationalist Government when they passed their own measure last July. 4. As might be expected, the present amending law has met with the violent disapproval of the vernacular press of all shades. It was also heavily attacked in the Chamber of Deputies by the more irresponsible elements, but succeeded in passing its three readings without amendment. The Senate, however, introduced three important clauses (underlined in the enclosed translation of the law) which were subsequently accepted by the Government and approved by the Chamber. These additions are commented upon together with the remainder of the measure in the attached memorandum, but it is worth mentioning that the clause providing that no newspaper “ self-declared to be the organ of an authorised political party ” may be suspended without a court judgment was received with acclamation by the newspapers which are generally considered to represent political parties and with severe disapproval by Sart-al-Ahali (alias Al Ahali), whose views are of a more sinister hue than those of any authorised Iraqi political party. i i 5. The present measure should facilitate the suppression of compaigns of //abuse and calumny against the policy of His Majesty’s Government and British If interests such as have occurred in the past.

I had occasion to protest once more to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about this journal on the 13th April on account of its attacks on British officials in the Iraqi Government, and his Excellency assured me that I should not have any cause for further complaint after the new amending law had been enacted and had provided the Govern ment with the additional powers of which they stood in need.

The tone of Sir Francis Humphrys' despatch suggests that he is himself somewhat lukewarm in the matter, but it is satisfactory that, as appears from his letter of 3 rd April to the Resident, he has been able to obtain even oral promises of measures to prevent a repetition of such articles in the Iraq press. With/W.Lth reference to paragraph 3 of the despatch, it was proposed to hold a conference at Baghdad last February between representatives of Koweit and Iraq to discuss the question of smuggling, but the scheme fell through. A meeting is to be held with the Foreign Olfice sometime soon to consider wnat action can now be taken. The matter is complicated by the natural indignatiormof the Sheikh of Koweit against certain cases of brutal attacks (sometimes certainly in Koweit waters) on Koweit dhows by Iraqi customs officials, resulting in the death of Koweit subjects. i 0 SEEN&gt; r' mmm r \ vJ I / C Hfif .8^.7«.

I do not know on what grounds the writer bases his statement (paragraph yoi I'M307 - 2 - 4 - for convenience of reference I have numbered the paragraphs) that the Port Directorate, Basrah, already controls Kuwait harbour, hut I suppose this has some reference to buoying and limiting arrangements. To what extent the article was inspired by the f Iraq Government is doubtful, but it is significant that it appeared simultaneous ly in the M Ath Thigr M of Basrah, the H A1 Akha ul ^atni” of Baghdad, and the 'Tfat al Arab” of Damascus, thus being given a wide publicity. It is perhaps also of some significance that only recently - vide His Majesty’s Ambassador, Bagdad’s letter No*739 of 23rd November 1933, received under India Office Printed Letter No.P.Z. 8361/33 - the ’Iraq Government made an enquiry as to the dates on which the ’’Kuwait nationality and the Bahrain nationality were constituted, and also the date on which each of these two nationalities was separated from Ottoman nationality”. 3. The date of the publication of the article 31st January, when the Smuggling Conference at Baghdad was in the air, perhaps has some fhrther significance, and the Shaikh’s objection to the Conference may have been partly due to the suggestion in paragraph 5, that a Kuwait-’Iraq Commission should be set up with a view to bringing about the annexation of Kuwait by ’Iraq. The Shaikh should have known of course that the Conference in question had nothing to do with annexation, but being intensely suspicious of the ’Iraq Government perhaps this had some effect on his mind. In this connection please see paragraph 5 of the Political Agent’s letter. In addition to its main thesis, it will be not! ced/308 3- noticed that the article refers at some length to the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohamnerah f s date gardens in Basrah, (paragraph l), and states: H After the occupation of Basra, the British Government carried out her promises to both Rulers for a couple of years, in spite of the clamours of t^e ’Iraqian Chamber of Deputies, but the ’Iraq Governnent at last succeeded in collecting their land tsixes on the properties of both, by the method of cancelling the old Turkish system of collecting taxes, and replacing it by a new one known as the M Istahlak Tax Procedure”• Personally I find it difficult to believe on financial grounds that the ’Iraq Government changed their revenue system merely in order to collect land taxes on the properties of the Shai khs, (vi de my letter No*1994 r §., dated the 30th December 1933, copy forwarded to the Government of India and to Fis Excellency the Ambassador, Baghdad, under my Printed Letter No«1995-S of 30th December 1933), but evidently the ’Iraq Press either believes this, or professes to do so. 5. With regard to the Shaikh’s request - parag aph 7 of his letter - that the ’proper authorities should be requested to bring such vicious propaganda to an end’. These authorities are the ’Iraq Government , and it is of course for His Mag esty’s Ambassador to say what effect such a protest will have in that quarter. As far as the interests of Kuwait and of our special position there ‘are concerned, after careful consideration I ami of opinion that a protest of some sort should be made. In the first place the Shaikh’s request is by no means unreasonable, and it is obvious that so long as a Press/-4- QO) 309 Press campaign of this nature continues in the 'Iraqi Press the Shaikh can hardly he expected to abate his suspicious attitude towards the 'Iraq Government. Oriental ^ulers are peculiarly sensitive to newspaper articles, as we have seen recently in this country# The 'Iraq Govemmen: will doubtless reply to any protest that the 'Iraqi Press is 'free*, but I presume that they - the 'Iraqi authorities - have indirect means of exercising some control over news papers - should they really wish to do so, while the protest will in any case provide an opportunity of conveying to the 'Iraqi Government a reminder, of which perhaps they stand in need, that 'Kuwait is an independent Arab State under British nrotection'. The only alternative, to ignore the article altogether, would not I think be wise, and would be difficult to justify to the Shaikh. I am sending a copy of this despatch, with enclosures, to the Government of India and to His Excellency the Ambassador at Baghdad. I have the honour to be, Si r.

Sir, I have the honour to forward (a) English translation of three similarly worded articles, which appeared under the name of one 'Omar al Taibi', simultaneous -ly in the Arabic newspapers, (i) The'Ath Thighr' of Basra (No.272) under date 31st January 1934; (ii) 'Al Akha al Watni' of Baghdad (Ho.554, under date 31st January 1934; (iii) 'Fat al Arab' of Damascus (No.3510) under date 30 th January 1934; (b) English translation of a letter No.R3/l433, dated the 9th Febmary 1934, from His Excel lency the Shaikh of Kuwait to myself drawing attention to the articles in question and asking His Majesty^ Government to lodge a formal protest to both the ’Iraq and Syrian Governments 2. Both the articles and His Excellency the Shaikh’s letter speak for Uieraselves and so nedd no further word of explanation from me. 3. Hi# Etcellency the Shaikh takes a very serious view of the articles, which from the fact that they appeared on the- 2 - 311 on the 30th and 31st of January respectively in the three i most important towns of the kiddle iast (Damascus, Baghdad and Basra) clearly prove them to be inspired. 4. The writer of the articlfjs is, I understand, a Syrian vdio at the moment is residing in ’Iraq and has recently spent much of his time making sundry mysterious - not to say suspicious - journeys between Bagdad and Basra. 5. His r hccellency h of opinion that certain influential persons in Baghdad of set purpose got the man to publish the articles under his name, shortly before the date fixed for the 'Kuwait - ’Iraq Stouggling Conference' (the 15th and 16th February 19 34), as part of the deliberate propaganda which is now going forward in ’Iraq against Kuwait, and with a view possibly to influence the course of the discussions. 6. '/hether the Shaikh is ri$it or wrong in this assumption is immaterial, but the object of the letter, which incidentally is grossly incorrect and misleading in several important respects, is clearly intended to convey to the public and especially the Kuwait public, the idea that ,; Kuwai t within the ’Iraq fold v/ill be happy and prosperous, but as an independent State will continue to be attacked and subjected to every form of pressure and ignominy'. 7* His Excellency put it sanewhat ironically in the course of his conversation with me (when he brought me the newspapers in question to see). His words were as near as I can remember, as follows. 'There is little doubt that ’Iraq’s policy to-day is to show her teeth and bite me one day, and the next day to fawn, and offer the advantages of peace, all with the one eventual idea of coercing my State and forcing me to come within her fold. At the same time ’Iraq clearly does not wish to be too forceful in her methods, as this she knows will upset His Majesty’s (ioveminent who,- 3 - 312 it is hoped, may be 'used' diolomatically to further her (♦Iraq’s) ends in this particular matter. 8* It is Interesting to note in passing that the writer of the 'article' makes the naive admission (end of first para) that the f Iraq Government only succeeded in getting taxes out of the Shaikh, by discarding the old Turkish Taxation system, and 'replacing it with the one known as the Istehlak Procedure'. The Implication being that by means of the new method they were able to 'hoodwink' His Majesty’s Government. 9* This we have always maintained here in Kuwait, althouffr the Shaikh has gone a step further and believes that the ’Iraq Government will go back to the old Turkish system, as soon as they have successfully settled the whole Date Garden business, as between themselves, His Majesty’s Government and Kuwait - vide my Confidential Despatch Ho.270, dated the 9th November 19C3. 10. In this matter of the similarity of present day ’Iraq’s propaganda to that of the Turkish Government, prior to 1914, I would once again draw your attention to my Confidential Despatch No. 10b, dated the 20th hay 1933 and your Confidential Letter No.588-3, daxecl the 1st ^une 1933 to the Government of India. 11. I trust that His Excellency the Shaikhs letter, together with my letter and enclosure (a) will be forwarded to the proper quarters, with a view to a strong protest being made and in order that adequate steps may be taken to prevent publication of such articles in future.

'A MATTER BETd'EKN KUWAIT AND , IRA(i'. 1 uring the Turkish dominion over ’Iraq, Kuwait was regarded as one of the subordinate provinces of Basra, and its rulers of the present as-3abah family were considered to be Ottoman Governors. They themselves always made manifest their respect to this Ottoman dependency, and on this basis they were allowed to possess vast date gardens and many landed properties, both in Basra town and in its environs, thus establish 1 ^ 3 / themselves amongst the greatest landlords of Basra. he land taxes, which the Turkish Authorities used to levy from them on their properties within the Basra mayat, exceeded six lacs of rupees, and the British Govern ment, soon after the outbreak of the World Great War, promisee to exempt them from this, if they (the Al Sabah) helped her in the occupation of Basra. This they did. Similarly the Briti sh Government also promised to exempt Khazal Khan, the Ruler of Mohamaerah, and now member of the Persian Parliament, from the sum of four lacs of rupees, which he had to pay eveiy year to the Turkish Authorities as land tax on the properties which lie possessed at Basra, on the grounds that he was an Ottoman subject, and ?'ohammerah a Turkish dependency. After the occupation of Basra, the British Government carried out her promises to both rulers for a couple of years , inspite of the clamours of the ’Iraqian Chamber of Deputies, but the ’Iraq Government at last succeeded in collecting their land/- 2 - 314 land taxes on the properties of both, by the method of cancelling th© old Turkish System of collecting taxes, and replacing it by a new one known as the 'Istahlak Tax Procedure Under the oireamstances which we have mentioned above, it should have been possible for the British Govern ment of the time to have helped in the annexation of Kuwait by ’Iraq on the understanding that the rulership should remain in the hands of the Al Sab&amp;h Amirs. Had this been effected, Kuwait, in view of its excellent geographical position, would have became a first rate sea port and harbour for ’Iraq; and Kuwait and ’Iraq together would have derived equal advantage at one and th© same time. However, Kuwait has now got a good and direct connection in the Posts and Telegraphs Service, tfiich is being carried on in Kuwait by the latter. The people of Kuwait themselves desiro very sincerely that they should be annexed to ’Iraq and the present ruler of Kuwait, we bellve, approves of this annexation also, because it will disentangle him from many difficulties, which arise frequently between him and Ke.'jd on the question of the 'Husab&amp;lah' and the demands (by Nejd) of a share in the Customs duties. Moreover, the people of Kuwait as wellas the people of ’Iraq are both owners of extensive properties and flourishing businesses in each other’s countries. Most of the motor cars, which now ply botween Basra and Kuwait, for instance, belong to ’Iraqis and the town of Kuwait is illuminated with electricity by a Kuwait - ’Iraq Electric Supply Co., in which the people of Basra have got many shares. A^lso the Port 1 irectorate at j^asra, which is rightly a legitimate property of the ’Iraq Government, itself controls the harbour of Kuwait, at which more steamers call than at Basra. It would be a good deed, therefore, if a Kuwait- ’Iraq Commission were to be set up, with a view to bringing about the annexation of Kuwait by ’Iraq. The advantages■V - 3 - &amp;&gt; 315 advantage of such a settlement would then be vejy great, and would certainly be in the interests of both countries/ 316 franalation of a letter No.fi3/X433, dated the 24th Shauwal 1352 (9th February 1934), from His Excellency ShalJch sir Ahmad al Jablr as-Sabuh, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., ?uler of r.uwait to Hie Political Agent, Kuwait. After Compliments, We beg to draw youi- attention to the fact that the raqian press have lately assumed towards us an attitude, of which the least that can be said Is that It seems to have been designed, and definitely intended for purposes, which I fail to comprehend, however, being as I am, ardently and ever desirous to preserve good and friendly relations wl th my neighbours in general, and with 'Iraq in particular, I should be grateful if you would kindly draw the attdntion of those concerned, to the boastful newspaper articles which we are wont to frequently read nowadays in 'Iraqian newspapers and which under prominent and sensational headlines seem bait on *Sent to Bush ire under disturbing the friendly and amicable relations which exist between neighbours, Had there been a word of truth in the matters discussed and dealt with, I should have overlooked thse editorial efforts, but in very fact they ere entirely devoid of truth. I do not propose to deal with each article separatel'' nor can I now, but as an example I would merely mention those articles which recently appeared in the 'Al Ahali' Kuwait /newspaper of Baghdad (already reported to you) dealing with Confidential Letter our gardens and properties, by an unknown correspondent, No.294, dated 11.12.53. who tried to distort and hide the true facts; also the article which was published by one Omar al Tabi, a Byrian by birth and an editor in the 'Fat al Arab” newspaper of Damascus (who recently came to 'Iraq) in three newspapers simultaneous! and under different titles, thou^ the subject was one and the saneI - 2 - 317 sr the same. This article appeared in the 'Fat al Arab' newspaper of Damascus, under date 30th January 1934, and was entitled, 'Vhy is Kuwait not annexed to ’Iraq'; also in the 'Akha' newspaper of Bagdad, dated the 31st January 1934, under the heading 'The Annexation of Kuwait to 'Iraq', and finally in the 'Ath Thighr'’ newspaper of Basra, (dated the 31st January 1934), under the title, 'The Matter between . Kuwait and 'Iraq'. In the above mentioned article the writer has dealt with this supposed annexation idea in a manner which reveals an attempt ff at pure propaganda obviously with the evil purpose of prostituting the true facts, and sowing the seeds of hatred between our adjoining countries. Had such writings as these reached us from beyond the seas, or from far distant countries, we should have not been very surprised; but the constant publishing of these wicked and scurrilous articles in the press of 'Iraq causes us the greatest astonishment. How is it possible for responsible men in organised government like that of 'Iraq to allow certain individuals, who have no idea of truth, to try and traduce the good name of their neighbours and insult them without reason. 9 Our intention, however, is not to discover the motive or object underlying these y/ritings, but rather to make protest and show our contempt for methods which we cannot pass over in silence, whoever the real author may be. ly Lastly the ppearance of such false/inspired stories^ written by an 'Iraqi at one time and by a Syrian at another compel us to protest most strongly against the writer and with deep insistence we would ask that you kindly write to the proper authorities concerned, and request them to bring such vicious propaganda to an end, and thus preserve the spirit of frinedship which we abova all wish should continueMflPPP” 318 Hec.

Ho on© o«n surpass the British in their systematical methods of colonizing. Similar to other nations the British care for nothing hut the safeguarding of their interests, and in this they have far excelled other nations in the adoption of methods and systems, both of which are the out come of deep thinking, end far sighted plans, not found in any brains other than those leading politicians of Downing Street. I2ver since the occupation by the British of India, the paradise and the bride of the world, they have always been thinking of how to protect this priceless gem from the unforeseen happening of the world. The great fortification that overlooks the narrows of Jabal Tariq («* Gibraltar), the two harbours of Malta and Cyprus for their mediterranean fleet, their control over Hod Sea into an Snglish Lake, and the great naval base at Singapore, over which they have expended millions of pounds, mean nothing, but the protection of that long stretched out line of sea leading from the U.K. to India. The British have not been satisfied with all this. They have discovered that the Persian Gulf is also a doorway to their great Indian mpire, and hence the inclusion of Muscat, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Bahrain, and Kuwait, within the sphere of their protection, and under the watch of their fleet. Now the whole of the Gulf is not under their in fluence. There are other kingdoms with vital interests also, namely, the Arab oaudi Government, that controls KatifV l.l V - 2 - 322 Katif, and El Has am; the ’Iraq Government, with its port of Basrah and the Persian Empire possessing the Eastern shore stretching from Kohammerah as far as Baluchistan# The British politicians cannot rest without safeguarding their interests in the Gulf and strengthening their influence thereon# These facts are too well known to the politicians of ’Iraq, Saudi g Government and Persia. Britain’s eager ness to protect the Indian Empire is the main cause for the policy that led to the countries on the way coming under the sway of the Colonial Department, the source of calamity and affliction to the East. It is strongly rumoured here that there appears to be a dangerous attempt afoot, inspite of the difficulties that it may encounter - briefly the purport of the rumour circulating, indicates that the Political brains of the Colonia Department in London, contemplate forming a new Kingdom in til© Gulf, to inelud all the Arab Princedoms, that are already under British influence, adding to them Katif and El Rassa, and so Basrah, thereby composing a strong front against Persia’s ambitions, which are clearly supported by the iioviet, who have lately been very active in getting closer to certain Eastern countries, viz Turkey and Persia, with the object of forming an Eastern League of Nations, as a block against Europe’s colonizing policy, and her intrigues# / That there is truth in the rumour can be observed which is kept by from the stringent watch/the Persian Government on her eastern shore of the Gulf, and the handing over of the whole administration to the Military. We are informed by a visitor from that side that none of the inhabitants are allowed to approach any ship that has cast anchor in Persian waters, without obtaining previous sanction from the Police authorities - added to this the contemplated conference of Arab Rulers, of which the Arabic Press, as also the 'Thaghar', had hitherto reported on#As far as •Iraq is concarued, British colonial policy would like to see absorbed in it Palestine and irans-Jordan, thereby raaing the Halfe-Baghdad Railway line an * Iraq line, and its cost borne by f Iraq: Haifa becoming the j ort for ’Iraq in the Mediterranean instead of Basrah, which is intended as the capital of the Gulf Kingdom, as they propose. The people of Basrah with many different elements, do not welcome the idea (if there be such plan) to separate it from ’Iraq. Nor do they desire a change under any circumstances. ISven H.M.Ibn Baud would not agree to give up Xatif and ;i Hassa, even if the? colonial party were to f inance him 7/ith golden pounds, and stregthen his resources and invited him to place his son as a King and lead of the new Kingdom. He, Bin Baud, is far from being deceived by these attempts, even if there be behind the scenes one thousand and one Philbys. This is what is being whispered in our ears here. We for our part are compelled to believe in the truth of these rumours, because without fire there is no smoke. But we ask those in whose hands lie the destinies of the Gulf to wake up and watch this anticipated end dangerous attempt, and to stand against this colonizing group bravely, we ask them to consolidate their attempts and check this flood before it engulfs Ihis part of the T^ast. Negligence on the part of the ruling heads concerned may give an open ing and opportunity for them to fulfil their desire, which God forbids should ever taios place.324 Translation of an article which appeared in the Basra paper H A1 Thagar” on 29th December 1933. THK DANGJR OF COLONIZATION IN ARABIA. :l e have previously reproduced an article from the Egyptian newspaper, named like ourselves ’’The Thagar' and printed in Cairo in December 1931, headed ? ’The Arab World is not a separate number of rations, but one Arab Nation”. In this article we discussed the Arab case and showed the danger likely to arise to the Arab countries if the attempts of European Governments to colonize Arabia became a success and pointed out the hellish plans and artifices that would likely be and were being tried, and gave examples of how the colonial group intended to work to separate the con solidated group of Arabian Amirats into a number of small groups, and we showed how the x^rabs might get to work and counteract these attempts to divide. It is Arab unity that will enable the Arab nation to check the colonial ambitions (of Europe) and to obtain a status similar as that enjoyed by Europe* Ve stated in that article that one of their plans wculd be to nit the Rulers of the different provinces of the Jazirat al Arab one against the other and by weakening them, open their countries to th© colonial idea of things. There is no question of the feet that at the present day the Jazirat al ijrab is strong, but the colonial gang are continuously working to undermine this strength by starting war in the Jazirat and so causing the Rulers there to lose their strength and thus give the outside powers an opportunity to occupy their countries and benefit from their great resources, and develop their priceless mineral wealth. The dispute that has lately arisen between th King Abdul Aziz ibn Baud and the Imam Yahiya Hamid al Din proves what we predicted three years ago in the previous325 - 2 - previous article mentioned. But whatever the reason for their dispute, we hope the wisdom and far-sightedness of both these royalties will enable them to check and abstan from war. »Ve know that if war occurred between them it would result in bringing the shores of the Gulf, the Fed Sea, nay also the rest of the Jazirat, into the toils of the colonizing groups. All who are acquainted with the affaire of the Jazirat al Arab know well that there are secret and underhand occurrences being carried out by the emissaries of these Governments, which if effective and successful will enable these colonis ing Governments to fulfil their desires. Readers should study the state of affairs in the Jazirat and the political changes that have taken place in the last few years especially and which we intend now to lay before them. Prior to the great War the Mutasarifiat of Al Hassa and under it the ^aimaqamate of Katif were under the Vilayat of Basrah while Kuwait, Bahrain and Q,atar were administered by their own native chiefs. The Kingdom of Nejd was ruled by IBN iiA RASHID from the capital of Jibal Shammar (Hail) and all acknowledged the suzerainty of the Ottoman Government as their Khalifah as also did the ledjaz, which was ruled by a Wall, assisted by the Sharifs of Mecca and Medina. And Yemen which with Assir was governed by a Mushir; Muscat which was supposed to control the adjoining principalities of Shargah, Dubai and Abu *&gt;habi - all how ever acknowledged the Khalifah of Islam the oultan of Turkey. Aribistan or Khuzistan as it is now named by the Persians, wai ruled by its own native Bhaikhs under one paramount native Prince, enclosed in a frontier stretching from Khorrumabad to Behbehan and down to Bandar Rig in the littoral of the Gulf. This Arab Prince of Khuzistan hold ee a powerful sway over his country and tribes, so much so that he only accepted to give to the Khaja inal326 - 3 - nominal submission. The Eastern Coast of the Gulf from Bandar Rig to nearly Bandar Abbas was known as Fars with a population of over one million, who comprised in their roups, certain Arab tribes settled there since the Islamic conquests of ersia also Persians and a large Turcoman groups known as the Khashganies. These were all ruled by ch^iefs under the title of Khan or Qowam and only submitted to the Khaja dynasty in name. The above was the position of the Jazirat at Arab and the Gulf Coast line in the days before the great ^ar. At the present tiiae, the Baud! Government has replaced the Rashid Pule in Arabia. The Imam has taken over ^emen. Redjaz is Gaudi. The Khaja Government has been replaced fay the Palavi in Persia, who has enforced a strong rule. But all these are now threatened with the advance of the colonizing group of Britain, and already the Western Coast has come into its claws which has replaced the rule of the Khalifat* The heads of this colonial group which have planned to play on the above mentioned states with intent to bring them more under their grasp, view with fear to their plans the idea of one consolidated Arab Nation, and so they watch intently for every or any opportunity to get a further hold on other of these small groups of States, especially in the Gulf and Red Gea. One of their principal plans will be to widen the breach between the King of Nejd and Hedjaz and the Imam Yahya of Yemen, for, if their machinations are successful they will be able to attain two important results towards their colonizing ambitions: (a) The breaking up of the consolidated nine principalities of Yemen and Assir, which form the Kingdom of the Imam Yahya: (b) The strengthening of their hold in the Gulf (They are ambitious to obtain a hold on Al Hassa ^atif, which a strong national Arabian combine would make impossible)- 4 - 327 llnflar the fore^oi'V it will he observed that the colonizing Department’s policy obviously is to arrange that the Asslr question should not he settled sxoept by the sword, and this is likely to he the case, At the present juncture - certain other colonizing nation also with ambitions in the Red Sea, and wjTh^ economic and political relations with Yemen, has, it is stated, equipped Yemen with arms via Hodeldah and Sanaa, and the greet Colonizing lower of the Gulf (England) has commenced sanding equal amounts of arma ments or perhaps less to Nejd through rihail and the hassa route. Why all this assistance? What is meant by such aid? The echoes we hear from the Gulf nowadays have a new tone. 'Vhat we want to hear is 'The Gulf for the people of the Gulf'. But everything helps to explain to us the meaning of the military assistance as being a preliminary to the establishing a Kingdom in the Gulf, which idea has resulted from the thought -ful brains of the colonizing politicians* Undoubtedly the outbreak of Sar in the Jazirat will be the separation of the nine protected principalities from the Imam of Yemen; the cutting off of Oatlf and A1 Hassa from the Saudi Government - which events wi 11 -l 1 - 0 ” of the colonial group to form an Arab Kingdom in the Gulf. -e doubt if they will be successful In pausing an outbreak of War bet ween the Imam and the Saudi Government as we fully believe both parties have ufflcl.nt experience to foresee the danger, but we ask the King of ’Iraq, Ohazi I, and all leaders of the urab nation to throw in their influence in persuading the two parties mentioned from going to War. Not only for the interests of the Yemen and Saudi Government, but for the safety of tha whole Arab Nation,328 Translation of an article which appeared in the Al Thagar newspaper of Basra, No.257, dated the 11th January 1954. 'A MSSSAGrK FROM KUWAIT' THE P3R3IAN GULF EMIRATES - WILL THAT BECOME A UNITED KINGDOM? We are accustomed, from time to time to read in the daily papers, certain gossip and news to do with the 44 affairs of the Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf, and every time we read something of this nature we have approached the cognizant sources to find if it was true, we, however, are sorry to have to say that we have always found these tit bits of intelligence to be without found ation and efforts of the imagination only. Recently we have read an article which appeared the 'Al Thagar' (Basra) newspaper under the title ' A Kingdom of Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf', in which the writer treated the affairs of Arabia in their various aspects, and sorrowfully lamented the state of division to which the Arab nation has been reduced, and gave a detailed account of the intrigues of a certain (foreign) government^ and the attempts which were being made by it tc bring about a federation of tho uu:ub Emirates in the Persian Gulf, including Hassa, ^atif, with Basra (the sea port of tbe rising Kingdom of the Rafidain - ’Iraq - ) as a Capital. tfe arc indeed greatly astonished to think that any person can spend so much of his time in scribbling such a long article on such a fanciful subject as this. Sven if we were to teke it for granted that there possibly existed some such plan as propounded by- 2 - 329 by Abdul Walid (for such the writer calls himself) it really does seem outside the dictates of all reason that none but himself should be aware of it• It is true that the English have got many interests in the Persian Gulf, and that they are in close treaty relations with the Shaikhs of the Arab Emirates, but this does not mean that they enjoy the right of jug gling with the affairs of these Emirates as they choose and for their own private ends. This is not the case, as everybody cognizant with the affairs of these Emirates is well aware. Every Arab patriot may be assured that the Arab races in the Gulf are as jealous of the integrity of other Arab countries as they are of their own, and more so in the case of the twin and adjacent country of ’Iraq, the independence of which they recognize and wish eagerly to see preserved. Indeed they expect great results and hope for much from the rapid progress of this young Kingdom. Should they ever suspect that a piece of territory was to be separated from the country of the Rafidain, they would before its own people, take the lead in opposing the idea. In short, I am quite sure that the English, who are after all good judges of the hopes and ideas which animate nations, have never even thought of the idea, which has so excited the imagination of our worthy writer. Moreover, inspite of the names which distinguish its various Kingdoms and Principalities and the many political obstacles which obstruct its way, the airab race as a whole is making progress and is well aware of what is due to it and from it. Though it (the Arab race) has missed a great many things in the past, it will win in the future, and it is absurd in the meantime to try and juggle with fanciful ideas; for today is clearly not like Hence it would be far better ‘or our friend yesterday.V 13 - 3 - 330 friend and jealous patriot to turn his attention to what adds to the welfare of his country, instead of rising meaningless riddles* From: Your Own Correspondent* Kuwait. 20th Ramadhan.

Sir, I hove the honour to enclose a copy of a letter which I have been instructed by His Excellency Shaikh Hamad to write to the Editor of The Sphere 1 ' together with the draft of an article on Bahrain. 2. An article by a Mr. T,r . J. Mo kin, a second- rate journalist, appeared in 'The Sphere' purporting to be an eye-witness f s description of Bahrain. It consisted mainly of mischievous untruths and glaring inaccuracies and most of the statements, appearing in a paper with such a reputation as ’’The Sphere' are seriously damaging to Bahrain. 3. A person reading the article would suppose that Bahrain is a barren stinking island, ruled by a Shaikh Abdullah, inhabited by e mixture of Persians Arabs, Turks, Parsees and Bengalis, who haggle in thethe coffee-shops over two million pounds worth of pearls which are produced yearly from the sea three miles off the town by 20,000 maimed, flat-chested, blind, phthisis-wracked divers whose noses are permanently disfigured and whose condition is that of slaves. 4. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad and also Shaikh ^bdullah and Shai kh Sulman, feel deeply injured that a well known English paper should publish an article so defamatory to their country. Readers who know, or who know of Bahrain will immediately appreciate the worthlessness of this article, but the 'Sphere” has a wide circulation not only in England but in-foreign countries and the circulation of this copy is liable to injure Bahrain in mrny directions. i.n article on Bahrain publisher in a reputable English newspaper will probably com- mented on in the Arab and Persian press end perhaps also in Europe. 5. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa is of the ^opinion that the article has some political significance end that it was published with the ieliberate intention of insulting and harming Bahrain and its Rulers. This, I am sure, is not the case. 6. This is not the first time that an English newspaper has published an inaccurate and mischievous statement about Bahrain and on a previous occasion I was authorised by Shaikh Hamad to write to an editor and demand an apology and the substitution of the article by an accurate one which we provided. This was done although the336 -3- the inaccuracies were far less glaring than those published in The Sphere'. I hove a slight personal ecqueintance with the Editor of 'The Sphere' and I feel confident that if he realises the untrue statements contained in the article he will make amends in the proper way, but should this not be done His Excellency wishes me to request the assistance of the British Government in the matter and asks th? t they should communicate with the Editor and administer e suitable rebuke and insist on the apology which he demands. I hove the honour to be-, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Government.337 Mo. (ofe| /3F- of 1352 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated, J/Th&amp;ny 28 1 1352 Octr. 18, 1933• ^rom The Financial adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. To The Editor, The 'Sphere', London. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that I am instructed by Kis Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin Isa el- r Ihalifoh, the Ruler of Bahrain, to request you to publish an immediate apology and e contradiction of the article written by a ! r. . J. akin, printed in your issue of 30th September 1933. The untrue statements end the innumerable inaccuracies contained in the article have caused inconvenience and distress to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad. His Excellency is astonished that a periodical with such a reputation as the 'Sphere' should publishen article which appears to be deliberately dis paraging to his country and which was written by a person who has evidently never set foot in Bahrain. The ulers of these islands have been on terms of close friendship with the British Government for over a century and it is surprising that a well known British periodical, describing itself as, r, The empire’s Illustrated ' eekly TT should show ignorcnce of facts which can be ascertained from any ordinary reference book such as, Whitaker's Almanac, or the Statesmen's Year-book, or an encyclopaedia. The following are some of the untrue and mischievous statements contained in the article. Paragraph 5. 'Recently the Shaikh Bahrain' ii. E. Shaikh Hamad, the present Ruler, is the eldest of the three sons of the late Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali al-Khalifah, X.S.I.S., who was ruling Shaikh of Bahrein since 1869. H. S. Sheikh Hamad was appointed Heir apparent in 1897. Tn 1923, owing to the advanced age of his father he assumed the duties of Deputy Ruler. On 9th December 1932 the late Sheikh Sir Isa bin iili died and H. E. Shaikh Hamad became the Ruler of Bahrain. These facts con be verified from any reference books. Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa, the present Ruler's brother, is alive. Neither he or his sons have at any time held the position of Rulers. The suggestion that the Ruler's two brothers, Shaikh Mohammad and Sheikh ^bdullah, are intriguingegbinst him in an unwarranted untruth. Paragraphs 2, 11, 12 etc. Medical statistics which ere available end can be obtained from the English and .merican hospitals in iiehrain show that the nearl divers are particularly free from phthisis. Their physique is unusually good end during almost eight years residence in Bahrain I have never seen a diver witn a nose twisted owing to the leather clips used by divers when below the surface. Blindness which exists in Bahrain, but not more than in :ogypt end many other Oriental countries, is not caused by diving. Paragraph IS. The practice of divers becoming responsible for the diving ;ebts of their deceased fathers is obsolete.. Tie system, which use i. to exist, was ten y »ars ago, when the present Ruler carried out a number of reforms in the diving system and instituted a regular code which is in use today. The following facts are entirely inaccurate but of less $ importance. Oyster shells are not left rotting on the shore. Ixcopt a few of a certain kind which are exported to furope they are invariably thrown beck into the sea while the boats are out et the pearling banks. There are no Turks, no Ptrseea end only three Bengalis in Bahrein and these three are not con nected with the :earl industry.340 The buying end selling of peorls is conducted meinly in the offices end houses of the locel and foreign pearl merchants, only the very inferior rearls are sold in coffee shops. Black nearls are far less valueble then rosy or cream pearls. Greenish black pearls are never found in the Persian Gulf but are found in Panama and the South seas. This can be ascertained by reference to any of the standard books on pearls. The pearling banks are not three miles from Bahrain but the nearest one between twenty and thirty miles distent. I enclose an accurate description of Bahrain which his ..xcellency 3haikh Hamad wishes you to oublish, together with some nhotogrophs which may be used to illustrate it and 1 request that you will send copies of your periodical as soon as this has been done. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, Financial adviser to the Government of Bahrein. •nclos.-One of the most interesting places visited by the first Flotilla of Destroyers of the Mediterranean fleet during their recent cruise in the Persian Gulf was the Bahrain archioelago. This group of islands, off the *rab coast about half way down the Per si an Gulf, is an indenenient Arab State. The Sheikhs of the Xhalifah family have ruled the Bahrain islands for a century and a half and for about 100 years they have been in treaty with and nrotected by Great Britain. The present Ruler is Shaikh Hamad bin Isa el- Phalifah, who succeeded his father, Shaikh Sir Ise bin ^.li, G.C.I.E., last December. The late Shaikh Isa, who died at a very advance! age, after ruling for over 60 years, was one of the best known historical figures in the Persian Gulf. The present Shaikh, who is a man of middle age, acted as Deputy Ruler for ten years before he succeeded end under his wise administration Bahrain has become the most progressive and advanced of the many rab States on the shores of the Gulf. although adhering strictly to Arrb tradition the Shaikh encourages all forms of modern progress and improvements. He is enxious that his country should be administered to the best advantage for his people and to he employs three Englishmen to advise him on matters such as finance, jurisdiction, customs and engineering. Efficient municipalities, which are run on up to date lines, under the presidency of the Ruler’s two brothers, exist in Manamah, the capital, and in the town of Muharreqt, situated on an adjoining island. The municipal councils, in conjunction with thethe government, have installed an electric system which effectively serves the two towns. The Shaikh appreciates the necessity in these days for modern education which is provided free by the government for boys and girls at the numerous state schools. Girls’ schools exist in no other place in the Persian Gulf. Shaikh^ . bdullah bin Isa, one of the Ruler’s two brothers, is Minister of Education and during visits to England he has made a special study of the subject. Bahrain from the sea, or from the air, presents an attractive appearance. The smaller islands and the northern pert of the main island are densly covered with data nalm groves and gardens ?/hich e.rtend right down to the sea shore. The gardens are irrigated from innumerable large fresh water springs whose deep blue depths overhung by scented jasamine, form ideal bathing pools during the hot evenings of the ersian Gulf summer. The town of Manamah, which has e population of about 50,000 people, including an ever increasing English and . mericen . community, is built along the northern shore of the main island. It has wide streets and squares, public gardens, and a sea front slightly reminiscent of an English sea side esplanade. Houses are built of stone and the architecture is a mixture of the Indian and drab style. Ttie Shaikh’s palace, an imposing building, is situated a little distance from the capital. During recent yeors the local inhabitants have become very keen on sports end many football, cricket and hockey clubs have been formed.During the recent naval visit several matches were played every day between the :’avy and the local clubs. The bazaars of Bahrein have the reputation of being the cleanest in the Gulf. During recent years they have been greatly improved by a road widening scheme which has made most of the streets safe for motor traffic. They vre interesting and picturesque end a strange mixture of east and west, today and yesterday. The shops contein a very wide range of goods which vary from . rab daggers an i swords to electric rejfcrigeretors and the latest types of motor cars, 'ost of the bazaars are roofed with matting. They form a happy hunting ground for the artist. The streets are full of colour and of interesting types. One meets hawk featured Bedouins from the mainland with long ringlets framing their faces; dignified Shaikhs of the Ruling Family resplendent in richly embroidered head cloths carrying gollen, pearl studded, daggers in their belts; prosperous white robed pearl merchants walking sedately to and from their offices, and among the crowd there are black robed wo; r ;en wearing thick black masks to hide their faces. Less picturesque, but very essential, are the fish, meat and vegetable markets, modern buildings with water laid on and cemented floors which are sluiced down every morning before the work of the day begins. The political end comrprcial importance of Bahrain has recently increased. when the ImperialImperial . irways transferred their route from the 1 ersian coast to the . rab side of the Gulf Bahrain became one of the stopping olaces and every Thursday the east bound and west bound air liners meet on the Bahrain aerodrome* which is the best aerodrome between Indian and the Mediterranean. The aerodrome is on e plain on Ifuharraq island some miles outside the town. causeway has been started across the shallow mile and half of sea which separates the islands and when it is completed the aerodrome will be within half an hour's motor run from the capital. another factor which will greatly effect the future of Bahrain is the recent iiscovery of oil by an American Company which holds a concession from the 13a hr a in rov ernm ent. But until now the prosperity of Bahrain has depended on the pearl trade. From ancient tires the Persian Gulf has been famous for its pearls and Bahrain is the centre of the industry. In about the middle of May. on a day appointed by proclama tions, between four and five hundred sailing dhows, many of them carrying over 100 men, set off for the pearl banks the nearest of which are about 20 to 30 miles from the islands. The return of the fleet, four months and ten days later, is a very beautiful sight especially, as was the case this year, when the ships arrived at sunset time on a still calm evening. The great white sd Is on the deep blue sea were dyed with a rosy glow from the setting sun end the chanting of the men who propel /-5- 345 propel the heavy oars was wafted across to the water to the shore where there was bustle and excitement in every house at the return of the Ivors• The methods of diving today are the same as they were many centuries ago. The use of mechanical apparatus is forbidden. The men dive with stone weights, they wear d clip on their noses end leather guards on their fingers to enable them to tear the oyster shells off the rocks. Each diver has a T Puller T who remains on board end pulls his nartner up et a given signal. The average duration of a dive is about e minute and one man may dive as many as thirty times during one day. The pearl shells ere collected on board and opened in the evening under the keen scrutiny of the captain of the boat. The empty shells, except a few of a certain kind which are exported to Europe, are thrown back into the sea as the divers believe that this encourages the oysters to increase; they believe too that pearls are formed by drops of rain which are caj ght by the oysters. Once or twice uring the season each boat returns to the shore to replenish its supplies. The divers feed on rice, fish and dates, arab coffee and dried limes which keeps ther free from scurvy. They make a heavy meal in the evening but eat little in the day time. ^he work is hard and the beets are crowded and it is surprising that the men are so healthy. Many of them are of exceptionally fine physique, especially the pullers whose chests and arms show unusual muscular development. The government sends out a hospital shin to the pear--6- 346 pearling banks during the season, previously e sailing boat was used but now a motor launch is found more convenient. The living system is very ancient and has many variations. The genoral principle is that divers do not receive pay but snare in the nrofits of the boat. The captain of the boat receives silascd 8 % a diver receives two shares and a puller gets one share. In so e cases the captain of the boat is also the owner but :iost of the ooats are owned by merchants on shore who finance the expeditions and in return they have the first right to buy the pearls at market price. At the beginning and eni of the season an advance is made to the divers by the boat captain to enable divers to provide for their families during their absence and during the off season. In former ti es, before the rule of the present Shaikh, the diving industry was Hill of abuses from which the divers had no redress. Some ten years ego Shaikh Hamad, in spite of strong opposition on the part of the captains and land merchants, instituted reforms throughout the living industry. Previously huge rates of interest were charge! on the advances and on the cost of provisions and the illiterate divers were cheated in every direction. One of the *epy many evils which existed was a practice by which if a diver died his sons when they grew up becrme responsible for their father’s diving debt. In this way they were perpetually bound to the boot captains. These and many other abuses were abolished and a regular diving code was brought into force which exists today. The amount of the bi-annualbi-annual advances is l&amp;id down by law each year, the rate of interest is strictly linited and a number of official diving clerks are appointed by the government to raake up the accounts of divers and boat captains according to a regular system. uiach diver has a little recount book of how own, issued by the government shaving his position with his boat captains. Ten years ago it couldhave been said, with some justification, that the Bahrain divers ^ere almost slaves. Today this is far from the case. Some of the old men are still hopelessly in debt to their boat captains but the younger men in most cases only owe small amounts and many are altogether free of iebt. Unfortunately however the pearl market in iilurope and ijaerice has suffered severely from the general depression and also from the trade in Japanese cultured pearls. Some years ago the value of the Bahrain pearl catch was estimated at two million pounds. Today it is scarcely worth £500,000. Cultured pearls are forbidden in Bahrein their existence would enuan er the reputation of the Bahrain pearls which still are, and always heve been the finest in the world. In past times the pearl banks were 4he fre quently the scene of acts of piracy and strife but for many years now, owing to the presence of His Majesty’s n?vy in the , orsi&amp;n Gulf, the safety of the seas has been assured. The naval sloops are a familiar sight to tho dwellers in the islands but they have rarely seen such a gathering ofI - 8 - of ships as took place in B^rcin and other gulf ports, during the naval visit. . raong the events during the week was a parade and march past in honour of the Shaikh by a naval detachment and the State Police force and a dinner party at the 'alace when the Sheikh entertained fifty navel officers end the European community at an i^rab banquet.£5$ P.Z- 5^3 I. ^ P&lt;^ k ' r ^ 7 lr* 351 b Publicity in the Persian Gulf. Colonel Burchall rsoig up m*. itendel yesterday to say that it might he possible to arrange lor The Times t correspondent in Baghdad to be flown as far as Shargah with a view to his writing up the Air Route, if arrangements could be made for this before 15th July. In view, however, of the importance of securing that any article in The Times about the Air Route was definitely favourable in character and of the fact that July would be the hottest month in the Gulf and Shargah a particularly difficult place, he was inclined to think that it might be better to let matters wait until the autumn. On the other hand, he dia not want to give Colonel Fowle, who had discussed the matter with him when last in England, the Impression that Imperial Airways had let the matter drop. 2. Mr. Rendel referred Colonel Burchall to this Office. After discussion with the Foreign Office and with Mr. Walton I saia, in the light of the noting on P.Z.2666/33 below, that we quite agreed that it would probably be better that any visit should be postponed for the reasons given by Colonel Burchall. Apart from this, as he would probably appreciate, it would be necessary to consider rather carefully how much publicity we wished to give at Shargah, in view of the fact tnat, as Airways were aware, it was not at present open to foreign aircraft. Colonel Burchall agreed. He will let the matter drop for the present and will mention privately to Colonel Fowle that action is being postponed.SNDEXEl 5^ xl hx. Wai^ton, Llr. iVakely, Please see the Political Resident's letter of 24th larch on P.Z. 2238/53 and irjy note to him of 22nd April, above it, ana his re ply Thfire is. I think, some force in the Resident's views as to the desirability of stating our case in regard to certain of these ^rab Sheikhaoms, though my personal disposition is still rather strongly in iavour of going slow. VSfhen Colonel Powle mentioned that he was seeing Lr.. Deakin ana would propose to him that something might be said, I suggested that I thought there was no harm in intelligent coiiment on Bahrein, Koweit, etc., but that it seemed very undesirable to say anything about Shargah or facilities there, in view particularly of the fact that we were btill refusing to allow foreign^liners to call. Inreover, as regards Bahrein, while a great deul has oeen done for the pearl fishers and tne general appearance of the island woula no doubt produce a favourable impression, we cannot afford to probe too deeply below the surface as regards economic conditions. In these circumstances it/&lt;ts$&gt; 353 it is probably no bad thing that the projected visit by The Times' representative did not come off. But we may in the not very remote future have to consider arranging for a little writing-up from our point of view of Bahrein, Koweit and possibly Muscat? We should no doubt avoid courting publicity though we may find that it is forced on us. I think that we should not take the initiative, though we could, of course, consider the question of counter publicity in any case in which misinformed and damaging criticism obtained a dangerous degree of currency.354 COPY OF 33. Extract from letter from Foreign Office, dated 10th May, 1933. 3. Meanwhile, I have put Fowled second suggestion to our Hews department on the chance of their being able to do anything with the press, but they tell me that, in these days of financial stringency, and with so many events of major importance happening all over the world, they fear that it would be impossible to persuade any paper to send out a special correspondent to the Persian Gulf at the present moment. (Sgd). Or. &lt; 7 . Rendel.Mr. Laitiiwalte, You will remember tliat we ciiscussed the matter of the German article on Bahrain Pearl Riots, (which has been disposed of by the reply sent by the Foreign Office), as well as the general question of publicity as regards the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf. My views were that with the ‘opening up* of the Arab coast owing to oil operations, and to i^ir Route, which will shortly become an * international‘ highway to the East and Australia, it is inevitable that some publicity will be cast on this area, and cf course we cannot prevent it. Ytfiat we can do is to try and ensure that this publicity shall be of a pro-British complexion. The best way to ensure this would, be to encourage a good newspaper to send a correspondent to ‘writeup* the Arab States. I suggested that I should make a proposal on these lines to Mr. Deakin, Foreign Editor of The Times, with whom I was lunching a day or two later. You concurred, and when I met Mr. Deakin I made the proposal. Curiously enough, as he informed me, he had arranged for the Aeronautical Correspondent of 'The Times, who had been sent to India in connection with the Everest Flight, to fly back to England by Airways, halting at various c en tres en route. This of course was just what we wanted. Unluckily, so Mr. Deakin told me, there had been some hitch at the last moment, as Airways in India had informed the Correspondent that they could not accommodate him, and he was now coming home by K.L.M. or ship. As you know, I rang up Colonel Burchall of Airways, ana informed him of this. He/356 He said that He was most anxious that the Correspondent should make the trip, and had informed his people in India to make the necessary arrangements. I suggested he had tetter ring up In. Deakin, and fix things up, which he said he would do. I have since rung up The Times who inform me that in spite of the efforts of Colonel Burchall accommodation for the Correspondent could not he founa on any machine leaving India in the near future. The Correspondent therefore is coming hy steamer’. It's an unfortunate muddle, hut on a par generally with I.A. method - or lack of method - in doing things. 5th lay 1953. U. T.c.0&gt;£ 357 MHRAIN PEAIiL BIQT.^ ^ GoIonel owle, Your D.O. of 24th March, No. 280-3 to Walton crossed copies sent to Bushire ana the Grovernment of India of an official reply sent by the Foreign Office on our advice to the Aborigines Protection Society regarding the recent Bahrein pearl riots. This, as you will see, is on much the same lines as you have independently suggested, and it is to be hoped that it will dispose of the matter. If the Society, however, return to the charge, or there are further misleading articles in the German Press, we can consider more active counter-measures. On general grounds our policy hitherto has been to keep the jheikhdoms so far as possible out of the limelight, but obviously (while we are not, I think, anxious to attract public attention unduly to them) this will become increasingly difficult and it may well be that a case such as the pearl riots might be used by the Persians for an attack against our method of administration of the island; in which event an article in the 'Times” or the like would be very useful. We have, however, an uncomfortable feeling that, even with the reforms which have been introduced of late years, the condition of the divers may still not stand too close scrutiny and this has been one with other factors in our reluctance to attract special attention to conditions by attracting public attention to the sheikhdom. Ugd). J. Cr. LAITHWAITE. 22.4.33.* COPV OP ^Z. OOWgTMTTlAL. D.O.No. 28C-o of 1933. The Residency, 358 Bushire, the 24th L'arch, 1933. My dear Walton, Please refer to your endorsement Po. P,Z. 1081/1933 forwarding a copy of a letter irom the Anti-ilavery and Aborigines Protection society dated 7th February 1933 to the Foreign Office, on the subject of certain allegations made in a Berlin paper regarding the treatment of pearl fishers in Bahrain. 2, The bociety fails to give the name of the newspaper concerned, so one does not Kmow whether the latter is a rag or a paper of standing, and the translation of the German article reads queerly in parts: 'They relate in the Gulf that if a small sailing boat should ever become suspect or trouble some there, then, rammed by a gun-ooat, it can quickly disappear into the farewell lor ever. In these times, however, one cannot afford to ignore any form ol hostile propaganda however foolish it may seem. I suggest therefore that the Anti-Slavery society, which is of course a very influential body, be sent the attached account of the riots summarised from Prior’s letter Ro. G/83 of 30th May 1933, forwarded to the Government of India under Biscoe’s despatch No. 354-3 of 4th June 1932. It will be seen that the aifair has been grossly misrepresented by the German journalist. It was excellently and humanely handled by Prior, and the Government of India expressed their appreciation of his services on this occasion vide their letter No. 3.2152-11/32 of 30th June, 1932. 3 # On the general subject of pearl divers at Banrain 1/ J. C* Walton, Esq., G.B., M*G., The India 'Office, LONDON. 3.W.I.359 I attach a note which is an extract from Jelgrave's report alluded to in paragraph 9 of the note accompanying 3iscoe's despatch Ho. 637 of 18th March, 1930. I suggest that this extract should also be sent to the society. As you will see it shows that both ourselves and the Bahrain Government have done much to ameliorate the condition ox these people. 4 . With regard to publicity in general and the Arab States of the Gulf. As the various departments concerned have concurred (vide correspondence ending with foreign Office letter No. E.5737/4009/91 of 6th November 1930 to the India Office), the days have gone by when we can prevent journalists, whether German or otherwise, from visiting these states, r-ven could we do so temporarily we would merely antagonize the Press (vide paragraph 4 of Government of India's telegram No. 63-, of 30th September 1930), and give the impression that we have something to conceal, when in fact our work and influence in that area has been admirable. With the establishment of the air route, and oil interests along the Arab coast, increasing publicity is inevitable, and we should do our best to see that it is of the right complexion. It would be an excellent thing if some first-class English paper, T IE TIMES for instance, would send a responsible special correspondent to 'write up’ the Arab coast of the Gulf. I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe. Yours sincerely, (3gd). T.C. EOWLE.O, 19 Date. Initials. SUBJECT. To Under Secretary Secretary of State...
