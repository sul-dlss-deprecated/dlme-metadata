I £ • &gt; U In a recent demi-official Note on The Future of Arabia an attempt was made to envisage, mainly from the point of view of the Government of India, what would happen when Bin Saud disappeared from that country - as of course he must sooner or later. The point was made that his kingdom was a ' one man show w , and would probably collapse when his presence was removed, with the consequences of a prolonged series of raids on Palestine, Trans-Jordan, ’Iraq and Kuwait, and general unrest along the Southern shores of the Persian Gulf. It is significant that North of the Gulf also is a kingdom which - to all appearances - likewise depends largely on the life of one man - Reza Shah, and as a corollary to the future of Arabia the future of Persia naturally follows. Pre-War Persia. 1. Pre-War Persia - a convenient term - may be said to have existed not only up to the War, but through it and for some years after its conclusion; its chief characteristics were weakness on the part of the Central Government and an absence of law and order throughout the provinces. Outside the capital and the provincial towns the government writ ran feebly if at all, the real powers in the countryside being the tribal chiefs whose areas are so situated that they form a broad encircling belt on all the Persian frontiers through which the important trade and strategical routes must run to reach the outside world. It is not too much to say that the leading tribes of anyone area could have taken the provincial capitalo &gt; ersian cnvention of 1907. capital with ease and ejected the local Governor, and that a tribal confederation could have taken Tehran* ( The Bakhti&amp;ries in supporting the Nationalist movement actually entered the capital in 1909). The tribes, however, felt no particular hostility to the Government as long as they were left alone, and the government by a policy of bribery, treachery and divide and rule based on internal tribal dissensions, was able to keep them from such extreme steps as concerted rebellion. Caravans on the trade routes were, however, systematically pillaged, and the routes sometimes closed for months together. The establishment of a Constitutional government, and of a Mejlis in 1910, of which so much was expected in Persia and in certain sympathetic circles outside, brought no improvement. This, however, was not altogether the fault of the Persian Government. w From the outset it appeared that Bussian representatives and officers in Persia, if not indeed, the * ._J Russian Government themselves, regarded the agreement as an instrument intended to prepare the way for eventual annexa tion by Russia of the northern and perhaps also the neutral zone. They believed that the Persian Nationalist movement, unless overthrown, would provide the chief obstacle to the accomplishment of this end.* ( P.G.13 p.10). During the Var Persia, though nominally neutral, was the scene of military operations conducted by the various belligerents, and- its conclusion left Great Britain, with the collapse of Russia, the dominant Power in the country. The removal of British troops from Persia, the disbandment of the various Persian levies which we had raised ? and the rejection by the Mejlis of the Anglo-Persian Agreement of 1919, marked the end of the old era and the beginning of a new one.-3- 5 . Under the conditions that prevailed in Pre-V/ar Persia it was inevitable that the two foreign Powers - Great Britain and Russia - most interested in her concerns should wield considerable influence at the Persian Court, Even in such matters as the appointment of provincial Governors the Russian and British Ministers at Tehran had considerable say, while the latter - on one occasion - had to issue a circular asking his Consuls not to give local Persians, Officials and others^certificates of ’good conduct’, which when presented at the Legation - with hopes of favours to come - caused not a little embarrassment. As for the interests which thfes influence served, Persia - from our point of view - was important to us under ■fiforee main headings: as an avenue of approach, political or strategical, or both, by a hostile Power on India either direct or via the Persian Gulf; as a market for trade; and - after about 1910 - as an oil-field. 4. In pursuance of those interests, and in defence of the lives and property and trade of British subjects endangered by the general state of insecurity, diplomatic action at Tehran was supplemented by military action on a limited scale, combined with threats of such action on a larger scale, in the South. A striking picture of Southern Persia in pre-war days is given in the Administration Reports of the Bushire Residency. As a ’sample* of the situation at that period bbotK confronting the Resident, the Government of India, and the British Government, a situation which mutatis mutandis may well again rise on the death of Reza Shah, and which therefore repays study, the following very brief precis of the years 1911-1912-1913 may be taken. In 1911 * the position . • •-4- * position of affairs in the Capital and in the Provinces continued to go from bad to worse#' The feuds between the Fashgai and the Khamsah tribes made chaos in Pars, continuous fighting between the two parties taking place in Shiraz itself* The Governor General and the Ilkhani of the Kashgais (Sowlet-ed-Dowleh) plotted to murder the Khamsah chief - Kawam-ul-Mulk# The latter, however,escaped their machinations, and took biist (sanctuary) in the British Consulate at Shir&amp;z, from which, after a six months stay, he emerged when his enemies had vanished from the scene, to become de: facto ruler of the Province. Caravans were freely looted, one of the principal hold-ups being that in which £ 2000 of British goods was robbed# Various schemes for restoring some sort of law and order were considered by His Majesty’s Government, and finally towards the end of the year a Cavalry Regiment ( the Central India Horse )was despatched from India, one Squadron being stationed at Bhshire, one at Shiraz, and one at Ispahan# The possibility of the squadrons escorting British caravans on the road had been contemplated but was eventually abandoned. On December 26th Mr. Smart, Consul for Shiraz, while on his way from Bushire to his post with an escort of the Central India Horse, was attacked by a large body of tribesmen, wounded, and ; owing to the fact that he had been riding in the rear of his escorts, was taken prisoner. He was released a few days later. H Por some time after the attack on Mr.Smart, the significance of the incident, and its probable effect on the local situation at Shiraz and on the safety of the detachments oi Indian troops tnere, was not clear. It was deemed necessary as a precautionary measure, and in anticipation of any further military measures that might be indicated to land a small force at Bushire, thus freeing His Majesty’s ships from the guarding that ... I^ ! VAJ -5- ' that port. One hundred and sixty men of the 79th Carnatic Infantry were accordingly landed on December 30th and after this 100 men on the 2nd January, a naval brigade of 200 men were held in readiness to land if necessity arose, and 200 hired mules were retained at Bushire for use as transport should it appear that immediate action was imperatively required. w The position of the squadron,and of the British community, at Shiraa gave rise to much anxiety^ especially after the ambushing and shooting of one of the Central India Hearse officers, and various schemes were discussed for the evacuation of Shiraz by the Regiment and the British community. The gendarmerie which had begun to operate under Swedish officers were ineffective. The officers themselves - while fair specimens of the barrack square continental type - had no experience of dealing with Orientals nor of the kind of work which they were called upon to perform, and the force suffered various reverses. In March 1913 Monsieur Constant , the Belgian Director of Customs, and his wife were stopped in Bushire while driving home one night and shot by an unknown Persian. This outra&lt;p» * at once brought forward prominently the danger to which the foreign community at Bushire was exposed by the profound state of anarchy reached in the hinterland of Bushire and the dangerous impotence of the local authorities. ” ''..•••As the outcome of the Constant murder, the headquarters of the 2nd Rajputs were transferred to Bushire from Jask chiefly on the strength of the weighty grounds that, if we did nat move in the matter of the promotion of the general safety of Europeans, some other Power would.' After much discussion it was decided to withdraw the Central India Horse from Shiraz, and in April the regiment, together with an infantry detachment sent up in 1911, reached Bushire without incident. The Resident thus • • •IP a* Qmt thus summed up the situation for 1913 j * The financial ''N assistance in the shape of loans granted \jy Russia and Great Britain has led to some tightening of control, but the Fars, Luristan and Kerman reports below go to show that tightening of control has only led to various lawless acts and rebellions; the money has been, or is rapidly being, spent, and little show of order has resulted, even temporarily, and there does not appear to have been any return on the money spent which would encourage one to look forward with any hope for the future.' 5* The problem of pre-war Persia was mainly a military one,( as is that of post-war Persia ). The first necessity was a modicum of law and order, on which foundation other administrative structures of government could be built. But this foundation was entirely wanting in Persia for lack of an adequate army. An army existed it is true -on paper, but in reality it was merely a collection^or series of collections dotted over the country, of the least virile elements of the population, badly armed, completely untrained, under-paid and always with their meagre salary in arrears. The soldiers placed as ’guards' on the foreign Consulates, were glad, for instance, to eke out their pay by acting as tennis ball boys. Others, in their spare time of which they had plenty, plied trades in the bazars. For what should have been their main object • the subjection of the tribes - they were of course quite unfit. In fact there is a story that a Persian regiment, under orders from Shiraz to Ispahan, on hearing that the tribes were giving trouble en route demanded a tribal escort before they would march. The best comment on the old Persian army is that when in the four years immediately preceding the war various schemes were put forward for # • •to • • for reducing th.e country to law and order, the army was ignored as a possible factor, faith being pinned to various schemes of gendarmerie under a European staff, of which one under Swedish officers finally materialised. ( It proved of very doubtful efficacy and disappeared during the War }• Pos t Wfa,r Persia * 6 . ¥ os t War Persia of today, that is to say the Persia gradually created by Reza Shalt since he first came into power in 1921, presents a very different picture to the old pre«war Persia. Pirst, and most important, an efficient army has been organized - efficient that is to say from Persian standards - which has on the whole been able to tackle with success its principal task, that of subduing the tribes. There is hardly a tribal confederation in the country that the army, in the course of the last seven years or so, has not campaigned against and forced into some measure of obedience to the Shah. Certain tribes have been disarmed, at least in part, and revenue collect ed from them. Parts of the country which were from time immemorial independent or semi-independent of Tehran, such as Arabistan, Bujnurd and Bampur, have been brought under the Central Government by successful expeditions, and their Chiefs either ’detained* in Tehran - like the Shaikh of Mohammerah, hanged like the Khan of Bujnurd, or shot like Dost Mohammad of Bampur. The work of subduing the tribes is of course not completed, but, especially in comparison with the old lawless conditions in Persia, a very great deal has been accomplished for which Reza Shah, and his assistants, deserve full credit. Their methods have it is true been ruthless at times, but one hardly judges Persian affairs by western standards. 7, Side by side with the army, and only less importantto it, a force of Amnieh (Road Suards) has been organized, or re-organized, which works with fair efficiency, and the safety * of the trade routes has shown a great improvement. 8 . On the foundation of (comparative) law and order thus obtained, the Persian Government have made an attempt, it may be said with some success as long as western standards are not too rigorously applied, to build up an administration on western lines into the details of which it is not necessary to enter. Together with this adoption of western administration has arisen the inevitable anti-western feeling prevalent in all post-war Asiatic countries. It is by no means universal, however, and seems to be confined to certain circles in the larger towns, particularly amongst government circles in Tehran. 9* British interests in post-war Persia are the same as in pre-war Persia ( see paragraph 3 ), with the addition of the Air Route. Whether this will continue to run along the northern shores of the Gulf, or be transferred to the Arabian side^is at the time of writing still uncertain. As an avenue of approach on India Bolshevist Russia uses, or is prepared to use, different methods at once more insidious and more difficult to meet, than those employed by the old Czarist government. The threat of the latter was a military one of actual invasion, or actual military occupation of foreign territory. The methods of the Soviet Government, which have been used with fair success elsewhere in Asia, are well-known. They are to form Communiat cells throughout the country concerned, to weaken the local government by propaganda, and by encouraging and organizing local elements of discontent, and by supplying them with money and arms, finally to bring about at the right moment • # •© moment a rebellion, the leaders of which declare Soviet principles, and perhaps ask to be incorporated in the U.S.S.R. The rising is to all appearances a national movement and there is little ground for outside interference. 10* The two other British interests in Persia* as a market for trade and as an oil-field still remain, but it is likely that the latter will be of less importance in the future. During the last few months the Anglo-Peroian Oil Company have considerably reduced their activities in the Ahwaz area, dismissing a number of their European staff as well as workmen, while the Imperial Bank of Persia branch at Maidan-i- Haphtun ( the oil-fields ) which existed solely for the pur pose of financing Anglo-Persian Oil Company operations has closed down. As a market for British trade, Persia, for various reasons, partly owing to the restrictions which the Persian Grovernment have put on foreign trade, has for the moment considerably decreased. Indispensibility of Reza Shah . !!• The progress made by post-war Persia, which can perhaps be only fully realised by those who had experience of pre-war Persia, has tended tc hide the essential fact that it is probably ephemeral. It is largely the creation of one man - Reza Shah, and - as in the case of Bin Saud - it is by no means academic to try and foretell what will happen when he disappears. He is about 58 years of age, that is to say no longer young. He must one day die a natural death. He may die any day either naturally or unnaturally* there have been various plots against his life. He may fall from power prematurely* there are rumours of his deterioration. He has various clever ministers, of whom Teymourtache, Minister of -S- Court, is the most prominent, but they merely supply the brains, • # • •brains, (Reza Shah himself - formerly a private in the old Persian Cossack Brigade - is or was illiterate ), and have little significance apart from their master. 12, The present government of Persia is a military autocracy. The army - as has already been indicated (paragraph 6 ) * is the most important feature in the country, and is the direct creation of the Shah - himself a soldier. The Mejli is little more than a committee for registering the orders it given Hbhil from the Court. Prima facie history in modern Persia is repeating itself as it has done many times before daring the past; a line of weak and effete rulers, chaos, the rise of a strong man (ITadir Shah for instance;, who seizes the throne, creates an efficient army, picks on a clever Chief Wazir ( called today tne Minister of Court ), and restores law and order auring has reign. The important question remains* is history going to repeat itself still further by a recrudescence of chaos on Reza Sliah t s death ? Persia without Rey.a S h^h. some strong form of government takes Reza Shah’s place when he disappears then all will be well, or as well as things can be in Persia. This, however, is at the least un likely as it presupposes that another all-powerful dictator with Reza Shah’s force of character will immediately step into his shoes. The Heir Apparent is a boy of about 13 who has just been sent to Europe to be educated, and who will not be able to become Shah in anything but name for a number of years. The Mejlis, which might form a notable service to the country as a permanent governing body, has little real authority, while the influence of the Church has been rigorously repressed. As vital forces in the country there would seem to remain only the army • • •- 11 - army on the one side and the tribes on the ox-her. But the army, as at present constituted, is not yet ten years old, it is largely artificial without roots in the traditions or national feeling of the country, it is the creation of one man and with his disappearance may well disintegrate. That is not to say that the army is not without capable generals, but a general cannot maintain a strong man unless he is backed by a strong government, and without Heza Shah this is exactly what the government will not be# An ambitious general, fired by the example of Reza Shah, may make a bid for power, whether to call himself Regent of the Heir Apparent, or Shah, or President of a Republic matters little. But there will be other ambitious generals in the field each with a following of sorts. Prom what one knows of the Persian soldier it is unlikely that any civil war which may break up will be of a severe nature. There will follow, rather, for the army a relaxing of discipline and efficiency, and for the tribes an opportunity to re-assert themselves. 14. To what extent the tribes will be able to assert themselves depends mainly on to what extent they have been to estimate with any accuracy. On the whole the northern tribes have been brought more under control than the southern. Sven from the latter, however, the Persian Govern ment claim to have extracted large numbers of rifles. On the other hand one receives news of old arms being given up, while new ones are hidden away, and every now and then incidents occur - such as the cutting up of Amnieh (road- guards ) parties - which show that the tribesmen’s teeth have by no means all been drawn. In any case the disarmed, and this is very difficult formldableness • • • •16 ... rr - 12 - formidableness of a tribesman depends on the opposition which can be shown him, and if the army deteriorates - as already indicated - the opposition will not be strong. 15. The analogy which has been made between Arabia and Persia (paragraph 1) cannot be pressed too far. The conditions of the two countries are rery dissimilar, as are the character and characteristics of their inhabitants. Persia contains it is true, dirers non-Persian elements within her borders, Turkish, Kurd, Arab, Turkoman, Baluchi, but for the most part they are fairly well assimilated into the rest of the population, or at any rate are not sufficient ly alien to evince separated tendencies, or are so situated that they are unable to give much effect to such tendencies where they exist. Persia has no Hedjaz, won by the sword a few years back, and only waiting for an opportunity to free itself from the invader, fitalike Arabia too Persia possesses a tradition of unity, and a national spirit, the latter much strengthened by the unifying influence of the present Shah. In brief while Arabia remains a ” geographical expression 1 *, Persia may be said to be a nation. It is not suggested therefore that on the disappearance of Reza Shah there will ensue a natural and general ’break-up’ of Persia as of Arabia when a similar event happens to Bin Saud. tfhat may be expected rather is a gradual deterioration in the army, a consequent decline of law and order, general confusion, pillaging and closing of the trade routes^and sporadic tribal revoltsi in fact a return to the conditions of pre-war Persia already described (paragraph 2 ). Even this state of affairs, however, will bring serious consequences in its train.V -13- 16* It will for instance give an opening for Bolshevist interference in the country, tion of a strcng government in Persia by Reza Shah may be Since about 1924^when the forma- said to have been accomplished^the Soviet would appear on the whole to have confined their activities to securing for them selves advantageous trade lines, at the expense of their rivals the British and often of the Persian themselves. But without in anyway exaggerating the Bolshevist danger, it would be too A' much to expect that the Soviet, or their convenient ame damnee the Third International, will refrain altogether from fishing in Persian waters, should the# again be troubled. Their methods, and the difficulty of countering them, have been touched on above (paragraph 9). Th* extent of their inter ference will depend on various factors, which it is impossible to enter into here. They may go ’all-out’ to try and make Persia into a republic affiliated to the U.S.S.R,(see for instance Minister,Tehran*s despatch No.359 of June 15th,1922 paragraphs 3 and 4); they may be content with less ambitious designs. In any case their interference will hardly tend to a more tranquil Persia, any more than did the interference of the old Czarist government. That they are prepared, when it suits -hem, to be Just as highhanded as the latter can be deduced from the wiping out of a frontier Persian post by Soviet troops referred to in Minister, Tehran’s despatch No.441 of 3rd October 1923, The enclosure to Minister’s despatch No, 359, a report from the Military Attache (No.C/63/ll of 15th June 1922), details the general lines of Bolshevist activity which were being employed at that date. These lines would doubtless again be followed if Reza Shah’s disappearance provides a suitable opportunity. It will be noticed that Colonel Saunders ended his report on a hopeful note* H Persians5 -14- 'Persians are willing to accept their (Bolshevists 1 ) money but not their doctrines, and there are no signs at present of any class of the community honestly desiring to turn the country into a Soviet Republic*' At the same time the spread of Russian influence in a chaotic Persia even if it stopped far short of drawing her into a union with the U.S#S*R. would cause us not a little anxiety, and would seriously affect one of our main interests in the country, viewed as an avenue of approach, political or strategical, on India. 17. Our second interest in Persia, our trade, may not suffer so much by the collapse of law and order in the country as might be imagined if the present restrictions on foreign trade are thereby relaxed. On the other hand if Russian influence becomes supreme at Tehran it is quite possible that discriminations against British trade will be imposed. With regard to our remaining interests of the oil field at Maidan-i-Raphtun and the Air line. The former it is tnue seems likely to diminish in importance in the future (paragraph 10 ), but it cannot be neglected, and if the oil field is threatened by the local tribesmen arrangements of some sort will have to be made for its protection. The safeguarding of the Air Route, if it still runs along the northern shores of the Gulf, will also need consideration, especially if the tribes threaten to attack Bushire, for instance, or Jask. In fact the protection of our combined interests in South Persia may perhaps re-impose on His Majesty’s Government, as represented by the Indian Government, the necessity of landing troops at various Persian Ports on the Gulf, as for instance in 1911-1915 (paragraph 4)^ though it is not likely that the experiment of sending a small force as ...as far as Shiraz will be repeated. (It may be explained that pre-Var years hare been taken as a*picture* of a possible repetition of history, since our operations in Persia during the Var itself were due to a world-wide conflagration which we may hope will not occur again.)• SUMMARY . Just as Arabia depends largely on the rule of one man - Bin Baud, so Persia depends on Reza Shah (paragraph 1 ). The chief characteristic of pre-^ar Persia was the absence of law and order (paragraph 2} 9 which led to foreign Ministers, Russian and British, wielding necessarily considerable in fluence at the Persian Court in pursuance of the interests of the respective governments (paragr ph 3). A striking picture of the situation in Southern Persia in pre-«ar days, a situati which repays study as it may rise again on the disappearance of Reza Shah, is given in the Administration Reports of the Bushire Residency, from which a precis of the •sample* years 1911-1913 is given (paragraph 4). The root of the trouble in pre-War Persia was the absence of an efficient army with which the government could tackle the tribes and maintain law and order,(paragraph 5), and it is the creation of such an arBjy,together with a force of Road-guards, by Reza Shah, that has enabled post-war Persia to make the progress that she has (paragraphs 6, 7 and 8). British interests in post-War Persia remain the same as pre-War Persia, with the addition of the Air Route, and as an avenue of approach on India the Soviet are prepared to use methods more insidious and more difficult to meet than those employed by the old Czarist government (paragraphs 9-10). The weak point in present-day Persia *».Persia is that Heza Shah appears to be indispensable (para graph 11 ), that the array, the most important feature in the country, is his direct creation (paragraph 12 ), and that when he disappears it will probably disintegrate and give the tribes an opportunity to reassert themselves (paragraph 13)• How far the tribes can do this depends mainly on how far they have been really disarmed, but in any case if the army dis integrates they will not have much opposition to encounter (paragraph 14) • Persia, on the disappearance of Heza Shah, will not ’break-up’^ like Arabia probably will when a similar event happens to Bin Saud ), but a state of general confusion will ensue (paragraph 15), which will give an opportunity for Bolshevist interference (paragraph 16), and perhaps impose on the Indian Government the necessity for sending troops to Persian Ports on the Gulf as in pre-War years (paragraph 17)# (sgd*) T.C.P.

It.-Colonel, Military Attach^. the ; «s His Majesty's Charge d*Affaires, Tehran— ■■ ^ sy 1 Wlf 7 Confidential * 130, 95/2* British Legation, Tehran, 3rd December, 1930. - Beport on the present relations between the Shah and his army and their bearing on the stability of the Pahlevi lerime. It has recently been mentioned that H,M. The Shah is increasingly unpopular in the army and, in consequence, it is possible that the troops, particularly the conscript element, led by certain ambitious officers, may revolt and overthrow the newly established pahlevi Dynasty. It is difficult to understand on what grounds such rumours have their origin save for the fact that the wish may be father of the thought amongst a small civilian coterie. Foremost amongst the achievements which must be ungrudgingly credited to Shah Reza is the establishment on a comparatively efficient basis, of a national army. This has been his chief concern, a work for which he was well fitted both by aptitude and experience, and results show with what success he is carrying out his mission. He has raised the army from a nervous insignificant rabble to a well equipped fighting force, some 40,000 strong, imbued with self confidence, a strong national spirit and, it is believed, loyalty to the throne. Doubts have been expressed whether the re-organisation } of the army has not been pushed on too rapidly, but in reality the army is a new construction, founded on a new organisation, based on conscription and planned by the Shah who devotes a v great part of his time and personal energy to every detail of army administration. There are no signs that the Shah, havinghaving achieved his ambition, is relaxing his hold on the army, in fact the op ositeis evident and it is freely stated and generally understood in the army that present plans allow for a force of 100,000 men in two or three years time. The army is pampered to a degree which should make its loyalty a matter of no doubt and under no other leader could it hope for anything like the preferential and favoured treatment it now receives. The budget of the fighting forces is approximately one third of the national income, the Ministry of War, even in the present financial crisis, has ample funds at its disposal and the pay of the army is not allowed to get in arrears for more than two months at a time. The soldier in the ranks is better off than he has ever been in Persia before. New barracks are being constructed in almost all centres, his pay, though in many cases but the meagre dole of a conscript, is regular, his clothing far better than in civilian life and his prestige and position upheld by the Shah himself. At a banquet in lushed last week the Shah said that up to two years ago, previous to the introduction of general conscription, he was not quite certain of his army but today, after the success which has attended the enforcement of conscription, he had complete confidence in his troops. I have heard recently the two following remarks. From a senior officer - T, Ten years ago I used to dream of Persia being ruled by a strong character who would do exactly what the present Shah is doing for the country' 1 , and from a junior officer - ?, If I was the Shah I would do exactly what Shah Heza is doing'. When he first came to the throne, the Shah, who is ofan exceedingly suspicious nature, being uncertain of his position, allowed none of his generals to become too powerful* He recalled them to Tehran and placed them on the unemployed list* From fear of his senior generals, he gradually did away with divisional organisation until now only two divisions remain, the bulk of the army being organised into brigade or even regimental groups. The Shah now is so definitely head of the army and well established that it is unlikely that he fears for his own position but realises that whoever controls this army of his creation, will be Shah of Persia in accordance with the precedent set by hi iself. He impresses on his personal doctor the importance of his living for not less than another twenty years by which time the Crown prince may be sure of the succession* In the meantime the Shah continues to control his generals, not from a fear of a rival to himself, but to the Crown Prince, in the event of hie. own death. The Crown Prince is already well known in the garrison of Tehran and is encouraged by his father to take a great interest in military matters. It is unlikely that the Crown Prince would, for some years at least, be able to succeed his father without either a struggle or the support of a senior general. Taimurtache would in such circumstances be of little assistance to the Crown Prince for he has not the right influence and is not popular in the army though he is astute enough to avoid giving offence to senior officers and always speaks well of the military. Outside the army Taimurtache is universally disliked and distrusted. The senior active officers who might play an important role in politics should the Shah die in the next two or three years are:-msmmm (1) Sipah B &gt;d (Marshal) Ahmad Agha Khan t r (2) Amir Lashkar Amanulla Mirza (3) Amir lashkar Habibulla Khan Shaibani (4) General Murteza Khan Of these I am inclined to think that Amanulla Mirza would eventually prove himself to be the strongest. Ahmed Agha Khan and bhaibani might be more prominent for a while but Amanulla Mirza is essentially capable, a man with a long vision and prepared to shoulder heavy responsibilities, and far seeing, Murteza Khan lacks the military knowledge possessed by Amanulla Mirza and Shaibani, and his general education is of a lower standard. Any of these officers might either aspire to the throne themselves, support a military dictatorship or, more probably, etitablish a regency in favour of the Crown Prince. Never since the Shah ascended the throne of Persia has he been more popular than today and if the Pahlevi resime is to fall in the near future it will be by the hand of the assassin not by a mutiny of his troops. In conclusion I would quote from the Legation's Annual Report on Persia for 1929-1930:- 'As in recent years the personality of the Shah is still the predominating feature to be considered when dealing generally with military affairs. This personal factor shows no signs of decrease and the bhah, as formerly f retains the chief control of the aimy in his own hands. The result of this is a far reaching pride and loyalty, albeit tempered by fear, throughout all ranks of the army 'who appreciate the special privileges they enjoy under the present military regime. 51 (Signed) PERCY C.R.

XXX X Both Turks and Persians have now established garrisons on Mount Ararat. There will be no general rising next year, although small outbreaks may occur. There is much discontent with the rebels felt by the villagers, owing to their depredations, particularly their theft of sheep. Friendly negotiations continue with the Persian© , for the rectification of the frontier, but Colonel Nuri seemed somewhat sceptical about the value of these discussions. The commission meets and talks and eats, he said, but the frontier is only an imaginary line, devoid of meaning, if there are no soldiers posted to enforce observance. The Persians have no troops close to the frontier, and, although they have an army of 40,000, it is not efficient, and cannot compare with the Turkish army. Hov/ever, it is being re-formed, and is improving. In any case, if the frontier is adjusted, a new incursion of tribesmen by a different route would raise the necessity of further exchanges of territory.i British Inb&amp;ssy Ho* 851.
