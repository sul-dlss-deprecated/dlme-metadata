(S 5165/11/91). 14tti Jepteniber 1933. Will you please reler to our official letter No. S 5165/11/91 of to-day's date regarding private flights along the Arabian coast air route. It seems to us that a public notice In the sense proposed by the Air Officer Commanding would be open to two objections. First, although it is quite true that we wish at present to prevent private fliers from using that route, the whole policy which is being followed in regard to civil aviation on the Arab coast is based upon making the Arab rulers, and not His Majesty* s Government, appear as the responsible authority. The reason to be given for such prevention is, therefore, the unwillingness of the rulers concerned to allow private fliers to land in their territories. Secondly, it is of course true at the moment that this route is only open to Imperial Airways and the Royal Air Force. On the other hand, the Political Resident has , + _ -r ^ li H L M. Kh+1 just obtained from the aeilch of Bahrain, permission for the Dutch K. ii.lv:. to land in or fly over his territories subject to a suitable arrangement, (see India Office letter No. p.z. 3278/33 of 12th June), and, in general, It Is not Intended to exclude all foreign commercial aircraft from use oi the Arabian air route. In this respect, too, therefore, the/ Comnander w.a. McClaughry, D.3.O., M.C., D.F.C.the proposed notice would give an erroneous view, which might lead to questions from foreign countries. We would suggest that, if you and the India Office concur, you should explain to tho Air Officer Comnandlng that the notice which he proposed is open to the above criticisms. If you agree to this, we will, on our part, explain matters to Humphrys and ask him to try to put the mutter straight with the Iraqis in whatever way he thinks best, in consultation with the Acting Political Resident.

It appears that the idea of the aeroplane being an Ura^ Government aeroplane may have arisen erroneously because it was supposed at Bahrain that ”YI' was the sign of the ’ira* Government,not merely the letters used to distinguish ’Iraq aeroplanes in general• 4. I have discussed the matter with the Agent of Imperial Airways,who has given me a copy of the four telegrams relating to the coming of this aeroplane, which I now enclose* b* lie can only suppose that the first message was sent to Bahrain in error and the place 'bushire” changed equally erroneously into 'nahram'. lie points out that imperial Airways telegrams bear the number A&amp;/ ,whereas this telegram has the number j&amp;/29S.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that on the 22nd March 1935 I received a copy of the following message from the Agents of Imperial Airways Limited in Bahraini- 'Fromt- Airways Sharjah, To»- Airways Bahrain, ... —^ AW/503 22/3 -Puss Moth pilot Lord Sen?)ill left for Bahrain 0245 G,M,T, aaa Please arrange fhel supplies and advise P.A. Lord Sempill will speak to him on phone,' The Agents subsequently informed me that the Maetor « 3en?&gt;ill *(net Lard Oeiuplll.) had had to return to Sharjah owing to an high wind and would leave for Bahrain the next morning, weather permitting. On receiving the first message I considered whether L&amp;rcL i should inform the Mao ter ef Sen?) ill that landing at Bahrain was prohibited, but in view of his message to me it seemed possible,•,possible that his flight might have some official or semi-official object and I thought it best to raise no objection to his proceeding on his way. I, therefore, arranged with the Bahrain Government for special permission for him to land. Lcy?L 3 * The Master- of Senpill spoke to me on the telephone on the morning of the 23rd March. He appeared to be very ^arprised, and was most apologetic, when I told him that the landing of private aeroplanes at Sharjah and Bahrain was strictly prohibited, and said that if he had known thxs he would have telegraphed for permission before taking that route. He said that he had no clearance from Karachi and apparently crossed to the Arab Coast from Gwadur. I explained the position briefly and asked him, if he was writing about his Journey, not to say anything about coming to Sharjah or Bahrain. He said that he was not writing about this part of the journey, that he quite understood the position and would not talk or write about his coming by this route. I accept his assurance that he was unaware of the regulations and so far as I am concerned the individual incident is closed. 4. it remains to decide what is to be done in such cases and I tind it difficult to make any recommendation. ^ To inflict a fine unless very heavy indeed would only ac th ^ v w ou 1 d encourage persons who wish to come f /pay the fine in 1 order to do so* a possible course at Bahrain would be to advise the Shaikh to issue a regulation that in view of the breaches of the prohibition against private aeroplane landing at Bahrain, any private aeroplane doing so is liable to confiscation and will not in any case be refuelled notices.•••.. l\Notices t-o that effect might be exhibited at all landing grounds within flying distance of Bahrain.

Would you please refer to Fowle’s Express Letter of 3rd April addressed to the Government of India (copy sent to the Foreign Office with our printed letter No. P.Z.2693/35 of 24th April) on the subject of private aviators on the Arab air route, in which, as a result of the recent Sempill Case, the Resident suggests that the Embassy at Bagdad might arrange for an amended notice about the prohibition of private flights along the Arab Coast to be posted up on the Bagdad and Shaibah aerodromes ? As you will have seen from my demi-official letter of 8th March to Fowle (copy forv/arded with our printed letter No. P. Z.1335/35 of 8th March), we are already in correspondence with the Resident and with the Government of India about the sanctions to be applied in future for breaches of the Air Regulations.

In this connexion Loch’s suggestion regarding the refusal of refuelling facilities might be a useful addition to the penalties suggested in paragraph 4 of my letter of 8th March to Fowle. 2.

Dear Baggallay, 7ould you please j4fer to Foreign Office Official letter No. E. 4668/4668/65 of the 3rd September and your demi-official letter of the same date regarding a proposed round Arabia flight by Hassan Anis Pasha ? 2. Our policy for some years past has been to discourage flights by Civil aviators along the Arab shores L. of the Persian Gulf and in the case of Bahrein (see^A^A' 1 enclosure to India Office Printed letter No. P.2.4^74/^33 of the 1 2th August 1933) and Koweit (see enclosure to India i— t U Office Printed Letter No. P. 2.8320/33 of the 29th December 1933) the respective Rulers have stated in writing that they do not wish permission to be granted to private aviators to fly over or land in their territories. More recently an effort was made to induce the Sultan of Muscat to give His Majesty’s Government specific authority to refuse applications from private aviators to fly over or land in his Arabian territories but as you will see from the/ ^Saggallay, Esq., foreign Office, S.YA 1 .a Qr.iice letter to Government of india» i ) unwilling to do so He E. &amp; 0.

Nevertheless it is fairly certain that His Highness would in most cases reject applications for private flights over his territories. 3« In the light of the foregoing we suggest that the Embassy should be asked to inform the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in general terms, that owing to the unwillingness of the Rulers concerned to allow private fliers to land in their territories, permission cannot be accorded for the flight over that part of Anis Pasha's route wnich lies along the Persian Gulf. If, however, you think that it would be advisable to have the Sultan of Muscat’s specific refusal we should be quite willing to ask the local political authorities to approach His Highness accordingly. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Colonial Office and Air Ministry. Yours sincerely,A to E. &amp; 0. 8675/36 ^Air Mail. INDIA OFFICE, TrllTEIiALL, S.W.1. 15ta December, 1936. U,0 Sir, / I am directed -by the Secretary of State for India to enclose copies of the marginally noted papers relative to / a projected flight by Miss Earhart, an American, including '-Sm .ncS.Sf T?”gn ! a 0 to „,uP that Lord Zetland may be informed whether the Government of India have any objection to the proposed ilight across India and whether they wish to lay down any conditions as to the route to be followed across Burma and India, m view of the fact that the precise route which mss Earhart proposes to follow over these territories is not specixied in the American Ambassador’s Note. xiS regards proposal to fly from Karachi to Aden, this will presumably involve crossing the Arabian territories of Muscat. If you and the Political Resident in the Persian Gull (to wnom a copy of these papers is being sent) agree, I propose to suggest that U.S. Ambassador should be informed tncib no flights over the Arabian territories of Muscat are permitted without special authorisation from the Sultan and tnat there is no hope of permission being obtained from His Highness at the present time for private flights in this area. In view of the fact that so far as I am aware the Sultan (unlike the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit) has not actually requested His Majesty’s Government to refuse any application for private flights over his Arabian territories, the Resident will no doubt consider the advisability of approaching His Highness with reference to the present case (if he is back in Ms capital) and obtaining specific authority for such refusals. ^ I am, &amp;C . f secretary to the (Sd. ) R.

Prom To Copy to Subject ; Proposal to obtain specific authority from the Sultan of Muscat for the refusal of applications for private flights over his Arabian territory. Reference paragraph 3 of Foreign and Political Express Letter No. F.290-N/3f’, dated the 26th January 1937- 2. As I was unable to take up this question with the Sultan during my visit other matters for disc approach His Highness. to Muscat in April, there were many ussion, I instructed Major Watts to f I now enclose a copy of a letter No. R.34* dated the 23rd July 1937? from Major Matts, from which it will be seen that His Highness is not prepared to delegate to His Majesty’s Government the authority sought. 3. Applications for flights over the Arabian territories of His Highness are not likely to be many. His Highness has stated (paragraph 3 of Major Watts’ letter) that he would in most cases reject such applications. Moreover, in any particular case that may arise, the e mpha sizing/emphasizing to His Highness of the fact that the responsibility for tne results of according permission lies on him, and of the difficulties that he would he put to in the case of a forced landing in an inaccessible area, or of death or injury to aviators at the hands of wild tribesmen would, I think, be enective m prevailing on him to refuse permission. V/hen, therefore, His Highness is in Muscat and can be referred to Without delay no difficulty is likely to arise. fhen His Highness is not easily accessible, e.g. when he is at Dhofar, applicants could be informed that reference to His Highness Wa.il take considerable time, and as aviators generally do not apply much before the proposed date of their flight, the delay involved in the reference to His Highness should act as a strong deterrent. 4 * In view of the foregoing considerations and of the Suloan s feelings in the matter I suggest that no further attempt should be made to induce the Sultan to change his mind, and that the proposal should be dropped. sd.

I discussed this matter at some length with His Highness and raised all the points mentioned in your letter quoted above but could not succeed in persuading him to agree to give the required authority to His Majesty’s Government. 3. The Sultan declared that while he realized the inadvisability of allowing private ‘civil aviators to fly down the Arab coast, and so far as Muscat territories were concerned he would in most cases reject all such applications, he was unwilling to delegate altogether his authority to refuse permission to all and sundry as he felt that in the case of those nations with whom he had Treaties, i.e. the United States, Prance and the Dutch Netherlands such an act would be likely to be considered unfriendly especially/2 especially as no request for such refusal had presumably been made by the Governments of those three countries. The Sultan stated that he would be willing to authorize His Majesty 8 s Government to refuse permission ior private civil flights over his Arabian territories for the subjects of all countries other than those three mentioned in the preceding paragraph but I said that I did not think such an arrangement would be suitable. 5* Under the circumstances if His Majesty’s Government consider the matter important I see no other course but to make another attempt to persuade the Sultan to issue the authority asked for* when he returns from his visit to Bagdad and the Gulf about the end of September.

As you \/ill gather from Lampson’s despatch, Anis Pasha is not altogether persona grata to us in view of his association with the National Flying Corporation (which may have German backing) and his activities against Misr Airwork. This in itself is hardly perhaps, a reason for refusing him facilities which would be accorded to any other private applicant.

This is interesting in view of the friendly manner in which Hassan Anis approached the Royal Air Force about hii flight (our despatch No.938 of 8 th August). v ^ We have lately had further information confirming the connection of Hassan Anis and Abbas Halim with the German propagandist organisation. There has also been evidence of some slight connection between the National Plying Corporation and Ahmed Hussein and his green shirts, though this is said to be solely due to a common interest in aviation and not to any political sympathy. Yours ever, (Sgd.) C.H. Batemen. ^.V. Kelly, Esq., C.M.G., M.C., E gyp t i an D e pa r tme nt , Foreign Office, London, S.W.l.A1 Mokattam, 1st Septern'bcr . In conversation with r» representative of the ,, Mokatt6iin M regarding his flight to Arah countries, Hassp.n Anis Pasha, 'bega.n hy reierring to the interest taken 'by him in aviation which went hack to 1912 when Fedrin, the famous French aviator, paid a visit to Egypt. Anis Pasha said that after leaving his post as Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs he drafted a scheme for the establishment of an air route for the transport of mail and passengers between Trieste and Alexandria via Athens. Anis Pasha added that he proceeded to England in 1925 in order to negotiate with the competent authorities about the execution of that important scheme and also to study the project for the establishment of an aviation company in Egypt, but the English created such difficulties in his way that he had to leave England for Euroioe. After a long trip on the Continent, he returned to Cairo in one of the German aeroplanes. An open campaign was then raised by the British newspapers against his scheme. As regards his visit to Arab countries Anis Pasha v/ent on to say that he v/ished to realize Arab Union through aviation, especially as King Farouk himself set the good example of the close relationship, which should prevail among Eastern countries, through the marriage of Princess Fawzia to the Crown Prince of Iran. It is for this reason, continued Hassan Anis Pasha, that he intended to land in every Arab country with the exception of the Yemen, which-did not grant him permission to do so. He would stay a week in every country, during which he would deliver speeches and lecture on aviation, thus realizing Arab Union through this factor. His trip would take two months and the distance proposed to be traversed v/ould approximately be 7,500 kilometres. By doing so Anis Pasha said he would spread aviation in Arabic speaking countries thus encouraging Arab/k c io6 2 . AralD aviators to exchange visits with their Arab colleagues. - Anis i-asna expressed, nis surprise at the failure of Egypt to join the 1919 Agreement for International aerial navigation ? seeing that efforts had been made since 1926 for that purpose. He also referred to a question which was raised in Parliament by Ahdel Rahman Azzam as to why Egypt did not join that agreement, although the Permananent Committee for the .agreement invited the Egyptian Government to join it soon after the proclamation of the 1922 Declaration. 'The Government, hov/ever, evaded answering that question. The real reason for this was, continued Anis Pasha, that Lord Lloyd warned the Egyptian Government to prevent aviation in Egypt, subsequent to the efforts made by Anis Pasha for the establishment of an Egyptian air route and the propaganda he had been organising for his trip to Europe during 1925. Anis Pasha remarked that since Egypt had not joined that Agreement, every Egyptian aviator was bound to obtain permission for landing in the country he wished to visit, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a process v/hich caused unnecessary delay and loss of time. Anis Pasha concluded by saying that he intended to visit those Arab countries in his personal capacity and not as Vice- President of the National Aviation Association.CONFIDENTIAL.

Sir, * ^ With reference to sir Miles Lamps on’s despatch No. Z 885 (697/1/38) of the 26th July regarding a proposed flight round the Arabian peninsula by Hassan Anis Pasha, I have to inform you that permission for the flight over the Aden Protectorate and along the Persian Gulf must be withheld. 2. In tne opinion of the Air Officer Commanding at Aden, the range of the aircraft which Anis Pasha proposes to use is insufficient for certain stages of the route between Wukalla and Marbat, while there is no wireless telegraph or other communication between Mukalla and Muscat. The route proposed, which is the Royal Air Force strategic route, has not hitherto been used by tivil aircraft and the Royal Air Force cannot accept responsibility for. a search if .Anis Pasha is overdue. Moreover the only fuel along the route is the Royal Air Force strategic reserves, which are limited. 3. As regards the Persian^it is the policy of Hi a Majesty’s Government to discourage private flights in this region. The aulers of Kuwait and Bahrain have expressed to His Majesty’s Government their unwillingness to allow any private aircraft to fly over or land in their territories.

It appears that tne range of the aircraft which Hassan Anis Pasha proposes to use is mnsufficient for certain stages of the route between Muicalla and Muscat. There la moreover no wireless telegraph or other communication between Muxalla and Muscat. In these oircumstancea the Royal Air Force would not oe able to accept responsibility for a search if Haasan Anis Pasha was overdue.

In all the circumstances His Hajesty’s Government x*gXKs±x regret that they cannot see their way to authorise the flight over the territory of the Adas Protect or at e. 3. As regards the southern shore of the Persian Gulf, this air route is only open to Royal Air Force and Imperial Airways by special agreement with the rulers of the States over which it passes. The route is not open to piivate civil flights, and His Majesty’s Government regret that it will not be poss ible, therefore, for Hassan Anis Pasha to use it.
