This paper is based on information received up to 31st t anuary. Since that date the Arab States concerned have withdrawn 1 ■ 8n on 7 new P^P e lines to the Mediterranean except to Haifa ^ ana the Saudi Arabian Government has granted the Pacific Western uii Company (one of the smaller American independents) a concession over it' half-interest in the Saudi Arabian-Kuwait neutral zone in return for an exceptionally high royalty, as well as an initial payment of ^9,500,000. (1) For the sake of brevity the United Kingdom is here called Britain and the United States America 0 In deference to present-day usage in English-speaking countries, the region covered, which is the nearest part of the East, is called the Middle East, instead of the Near East, by which name it was always known until the recent war. Estimates of population in the region are necessarily very rough, (4) All the major countries covered except I rap, Kuwait, Bahrein, Qatar and other British 'protected' territories around the Persian Gulf are now outside the sterling area, (5) The official rates of exchange except for Iranian rials which the free market rate is given) are as follows (for £1 sterling - £ Egyptian 0,973 = Palestinian (or Israeli) 1 = £ Turkish 11 ,284 = £ Syrian 8,83 = £ Lebanese 8.83 = 1 Iraqi dinar = 12,14 Saudi Arabian riyals = 129 Iranian rials.

This survey covers Egypt, Iran and the major successor territories of the old Ottoman empire - countries whose population amounts to some 73 million in all. Britain had until recently close political ties with Egypt, Iraq and Palestine and still has defensive agreements with Egypt and Iraq as well as rights over Kuwait, Bahrein, Qatar and other territories around the Persian Gulf. Prance had also until recently close political ties with Syria and the. Lebanon and still has considerable cultural influence in the region, French being the common second language and often the first language of business. America, the only other major Western Power interested, has stood politically aloof except recently in Turkey (to the defence of which she is now deeply committed) and Palestine, 2, The economic importance of the region lies not in its agricultural or manufacturing industries, which are very backward, but in its oil resources, and in its situation as the highway for telegraphic communications between'b - 2 - and East. It owes much of its development to British, French and more recently, American enterprise - to British in Egypt, Iraq., Palestine, Kuwait and Iran; to French in Egypt, Turkey (until 1914) the Lebanon and Syria; and to American in Saudi Arabia, Bahrein and Kuwait. The British contribution has been greatest in oil, communications in general, land development and urban services; the French, too, in all these except oil; and the American in oil and airways. 3. In the shipping of the region the oil companies mainly use their own; general cargo services are provided by many companies, including conspicuously the British India, Stride and Ellerman lines, American Export Lines, the Messageries Maritime and Lloyd- Triestino. The Suez Canal - that masterly conception of de^ Lesseps - is mainly French in management and ownership but its board includes strong British representation (including three British Government nominees) and also, one Dutch and one American representative. In airways all West-East services converge on the region, notably those of British Overseas Airways, Pan American World Airways, Trans-World Airline, Air France and the Dutch K.L. 1 4. In oil the major British companies concerned are the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company and the Iraq. Petroleum Company; the major American the Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, Socony-Vacuum and the Gulf Oil Corporation; the only French oil company is the Compagnie Francaise des Pet roles. The American companies are interlocked with one another and with the British. 5. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company is wholly British, The Anglo- Saxon Petroleum Company is owned as to 60 per cent by a Dutch enterprise, the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company, and as to the balance by a wholly British enterprise, the Shell Transport and Trading Company, with which the Dutch company, through the Anglo- Saxon Petroleum and the Batavian Petroleum Company, is in partnership throughout the world. The Anglo-Saxon is, however, predominantly under British management and is here treated as British-controlled; it is more commonly and better referred to as ’'Royal Dutch-Shell'. 6. The Iraq Petroleum Company is jointly owned by the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, Royal Dutch-Shell, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, Socony-Vacuum, the Compagnie Francaise des Pet roles and a Mr. Gulbenkian. The two British shareholding companies own 47i par cent of its capital and manage it, the Americans and French playing little but a passive role in its affairs, 7. The British Government owns the British airline which serves the region and the French Government the French. The British Government has also a controlling interest in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and the French Government a controlling voice in the Compagnie Francaise des Petroles, + The British Government also owns 44 per cent of the share capital of the Suez Canal Company and the French Government a controlling interest in the Messageries Maritime, Neither Government interferes in the commercial management of the companies, though there is naturally close consultation on + The French Government owns only 35 per cent of its capital but effectively controls it in matters of national policy.-3 t: &amp; ^^8 °f ^policy. The American Government likewise con- n m . - , , _ e^American companies concerned and has done much to ?n TSm? their interests, but it owns no part of their capital and rdd' t as bein g contrary to national policy, a proposal thai the Government Petroleum Reserves Corporation should ohrhd 0, ? pe f at ® a ? 16 5 million pipeline from American-owned oiliields m Arabia to the Mediterranean, ?a he Wa ? due to the Pressure of the State Department that the ircg Petroleum Company (then the pivotal new oil enterprise in ^ e A re ®?‘ on ) lfla ^ i n 1 927 to allot 23§ per cent of its capital to an American group (represented chiefly by the Standard Oil company of New Jersey and Socony-Vacuum) instead of confining o^^ship of its capital to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company- 1 oyc,l Dutch-ohell and the Compagnie Francaise des Petroles, This participation carried with it a corresponding equity in the numerous concessions which Iraq Petroleum was later to acquire in otner Ottoman successor territories in exercise of a provision (ca led the i! Red Line agreement !{ ) which forbade its members from raseeking concessions of their own in these countries (except in * huwait and smaller areas). 9* These later concessions were ? however, of little importance compared with those which independent American oil companies ob~ dined. Thus, on the strength of the findings of an obscure xjritish syndicate, the Standard Oil Company of Galifornia (joined later by the Texas Oil Company) acquired in Bahrein in 1928 and in baudi Arabia in 1933 exclusive concessions which have since proved ^0 be among the richest in the world - though the Iraq Petroleum company had rejected the possibility that there was oil in either country, or^in Kuwait* The Gulf Oil Corporation in 192? obtained eights over Kuwait, but had in 193h- to surrender a hali—interest as well as chief management to Anglo—Iranian by way of compromise between the American State Department and the British Government, which held that only a British subject or firm was entitled to a concession in that territory. Again, in 1948, tne ^American Independent Oil Company, in the face of keen counter—bidding by British groups, acquired a concession over j^half of the Saudi Arabian—Kuwait ^neutral zone ,f , rights over the Mother half of which were already owned by Standard - Texas, standard - Texas in November 1948 surrendered its half-interest in exchange for rights over the under-sea territory of Saudi Arabia. 10, in Iran, Standard of New Jersey came into conflict with Anglo-Iranian in the early ’twenties over claims in territory renounced by Russia and was finally given equal rights by Anglo- Iranian in a joint concession, the validity of which the Iranian Government later rejected,. Other American interests obtained a large concession in a contiguous area in 1937 but abandoned it, and were no more successful in later efforts to obtain a foothold elsewhere in Iran, The only recognised concession in that country - the most_ productive concession in the world - is still that held by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, whose predecessor (D’Arcy Exploration), acquired it in 1901 . Standard of New Jersey and Socony-Vacuum have, however, now a large indirect interest in this concession under an agreement made in 1946 whereby they are to receive from Anglo-Iranian long-term supplies of crude oil in return for bearing half the cost of a pipeline to be built from the Iranian and Kuwait fields to the Mediterranean. 11. American oil interests did not enter Egypt until the liberalization of the mining regulations in 1937* Socony-Vacuum and Standard of New Jersey have since been actively prospectingin that country and recently with considerable success i- 11 . 1 ' 116 western part of the Sinai Peninsula, vvhere Socony--Vacuurn io working in equal partnership with nnglo-Egyptian Oilfields, whic subsidiary of Anglo-Iranian and Royal Dutch-Shell and at proven the only important producer, 12, The American share in the oil production and proved oil reserves of the region is now roughly as follows, according to estimates made by the Ministry of Fuel and Power: idddlo East Oil Output and Reserves (Million Tons) Output Proved reserves C cuntry 1946 Ameri can - ?o 1951 Bst.

These^balances have today the negative merit of tying these countries to import from her rather than from others. Besides the region as a whole would normally tend to trade with Britain and with other European countries more than with America, since its exports, apart from oil - which provides it with exchange rouo-hly only to the amount of the royalties on output paid to the native governments concerned - consist largely of agricultural products which America does not need. Besides, few of the countries in the region - even those producing oil in large quantity - have normally more ^ than a moderately favourable balance of payments with the outside world, and none at all with America. Under existing + The returns of the Suez Canal Company reflect the growth of American trade with the region 0 According to these, shipping of 55 * 100,000 Suez tons used the canal in 1948 (against 34,400,000 tons in 1938): Gulf countries claimed over half the freight traffic and oil two-thirds of the south-north traffic. Roughly 37 per cent of the total shipping tonnage was British, 15 per cent American, 9 per cent each Panamanian (largely American-owned) and Norwegian, 7 psr cent Italian and 6 per cent each French and Dutch. In 1958 50 per cent was British; the American and Panamanian was almost negligible.exchange conditions their ability to import the capital equipment so badly needed for development is therefore largely conditional on the provision of foreign capital, which requires more security than they can offer. 1 7 . The major oil-producing countries in the region are now in this respect much better placed than others, since there is every prospect of a great increase in their oil production and so also in the royalties which they will receive, though it should be mentioned that only Saudi Arabia receives royalties in gold exchange, royalties payable to Bahrein being in rupees and the other States in sterling. The need to increase the oil production of the region is the greater because Europe, owing to the dearth of dollars, urgently needsto divert her purchases from the Western Hemisphere (which in 1946 supplied 73 per cent of her oil requirements) and because America needs to conserve her own domestic reserves, which threaten to declina^ so opening the prospect that she may, within the next decade, W cease to be the world’s principal exporter and become a heavy net importer. 18. What is true of the outlook for the American oil industry as a whole is also true of the domestic outlook for the American oil companies represented in the Middle East. Hence why Standard of New Jersey and Socony-Vacuum, 'which are the leading American exporters, but not themselves direct producers in the Middle East,have sought to preserve their great European market by undertaking to bear part of the cost of pipelines to the Mediterranean from the Saudi Arabian-Bahrein field of Standard of California-Texas and from the Iranian-^uwait field of Anglo- Iranian in return for the assurance of supplies from these companies, which, by contrast, would otherwise be faced with the prospect of producing more oil than they could themselves handle, 19. Hence too the need for pipelines from these fields to the Mediterranean, so as to overcome the handicap of distance, the ^ Persian Gulf being by sea about 2,000 miles farther from ▼ western Europe than are the principal ports of shipment from the western hemisphere; the route between is, besides, subject to the heavy dues exacted by the Suez Canal, which in any event might find the traffic beyond its capacity to handle. Hence also the gravity of the decision of the Arab States to withhold confirmation of the requisite wayleaves'through their territories, pending recognition of nrab rights in Palestine; as well as the gravity of the Iraqi Government’s decision to withhold further wayleaves for pipelines from Kirkuk anu even for the delivery of any oil from there to the great refinery at Haifa.0 ^ Grat + ° n Wh ^ ch exists between the oil groups in the Dutch Fnqt t Tn^ n0t p ^ uliar to that re S io n.

'' 0P t rati0n J e ?? of course towards collusion; and collusion between^groups which dominate the oil industry of the world is he easier m dealing with a region so backward as the East. The Red nine ^agreement, now ended, was, under English law, an in restraint of trade, and sustainable only on ^rounds • Public policy. Under American law, the American parties to it ^might well in other_circumstances have been forbidden to sign it; as iu was, the American Government gave permission, because the agreement favoured American interest^ at the expense of British. I should in fairness be said that the British groups concerned were for this reason if for no other very reluctant to accept and agreed only after lengthy litigation with the French, which' the agreement particularly favoured. The agreement was the more hampering to British interests because it was binding on the only two adequate British groups in the oil industry and binding only on two of many powerful American companies in that industry. Hence the successful intrusion of the unshackled Standard of California, Texas and American Independent Oil into the region - much to the benefit of the native States concerned, advent had been dealing only with a ring. who until their 22. If, for all that, there is need for close cooperation between the oil groups, so too is there for cooperation between the Government^ concerned. This need was recognised in the .anglo- American Oil agreement of September 1945* Under that pact, which ^'vas largely inspired by developments in the Middle East, the British and American Governments agreed that the principle of equal opportunity for the acquisition of exploration and development rights in the territories under their jurisdiction or protection should be respected and that exploration, development, refining and distribution should not be hampered by restrictions inconsistent with the purpose of the agreement. 23. The general purpose of the agreement was defined to be the ’’facilitation of the orderly development of the international petroleum trade”. The two Governments undertook to establish a joint commission for this purpose and to ’’facilitate the full and adequate consultation of their nationals” with that body. They also agreed that^the 'interests of the producing countries should be safeguarded with a view to their economic advancement”. The pact, which was intended to be made multilateral, was submitted to the American Senate for approval as a treaty, but no action has yet been taken on it. 24. The Marshall Plan, an emergency measure ending in 1952, embodies something of the spirit of the agreement but gives no thought to the economic advancement of the producing countries which the agreement had in mind, though the Middle East, to take the chief example, is, for all its wealth in oil, for the most part sunk in poverty. The United Nations Organisation has, it is true.proposed the formation of an economic commission for the region, composed initially only of native representatives hut later perhaps including British and American,, This proposal, may not result in very much unless the native States concerned reform their political and social order and accept some measure of foreign supervision» The prospect as far as relations with the Arah States are concerned has not heen improved hy Western and particularly American condonation of recent events in Palestine.-9- |0 TURKEY fng virtvallv r eytrl'f^J^ r -, da ? 3 i When forel S n interests, enjoy poftl^municipaf soloes SLr g snrt\ Cn ^ l9d ?

Heavy expenditure was also projected on Government buildings and municipal services but nothing °n^agriculture beyond an outlay of £L9 million, over seven ^ ears, on irrigation, though agriculture, which offers great scope for development, is in a very backward state, i *28, This programme is far beyond Turkey's capacity to finance, since tne income of her population of 20 million (of which nearly 80 per cent is rural) is low and includes little surplus on foreign trade, while much of her budget revenue is required for defence. She^consequently looks for foreign aid, particularly from America (which is now deeply committed to her defence) and appears even willing to encourage foreign investment, though not in those in dustries which are State-controlled, So far, however, America’s response, except for defence, for which she has provided S'lOO million, has-been rather poor, Turkey’s application for a loan of ^500 million from the Export-Import Bank in 1946 evoked a credit of onlj/ 025 million and her subsequent application to the International Bank nothing at all, while the direct aid which she is tocece ave under the American Economic Cooperation Act is only 050 million for the year ending June 1949, In return for this a Id ^ she has to use ’’her best endeavours to promote industrial and agricultural production on a sound economic basis”, and has sub mitted a^moderate and fairly-well-balanced programme for this purpose In which the emphasis Is on agricultural mechanisation, railways and roads, and steel, coal and electricity production 0 French joint stock investment in the Ottoman erneire In 1920 was estimated at Frs« 903 million (£36 million) German at Frs e 553 million and British at Prs» 230 million. These countries also held Frs. 3,900 million of the Ottoman Public Debt, American- investment was almost negligible,,r 30. Thornburg’s main findings were 29. If aid in the form of credits from the International Bank is likely to be comparatively small, so too is America’s private investment - and for the same reasons, namely that she considers much of Turkey’s industrialisation indeed it is) and is innately opposed to investment directed economy. This attitude has been strongly report of an American engineer and b u sines &amp; ~ expert, Max Thornburgh whom the Twentieth Century Trust (an in stitution endowed by American business and backed by the American Government) commissioned in 1947 to 'study Turkey’s resources and potentialities with special reference to the opportunities offer ed for American investment both by private citizens and business groups and by the American Government acting through the Export- Import Bank or the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development'. that much of Turkey’s modernisation was ill-chosen and faultily executed (2) that the first need, apart from the improvement of health services, which had been grossly neglected, was for roads which would break down the system of isolated economic cells which characterised the country (3) that irrigation systems were conspicuously needed in areas which but for shortage of water would be rich in agricul tural production (4) that there was grave lack of coordination between the various planning departments (5) that the real development of Turkey could not begin until it was made clear where Government participation In Industry ended and where the place of private investment began ('where the line was drawn was not so important - that it should be drawn explicitly and re sponsibly was of the highest importance') (6) that Turkish in dustry needed foreign assistance more in the form of administra tive and technical guidance than in the form of capital invest ment (7) that foreign capital investment on any large scale could not be expected unless the State not only clearly defined the industries to be reserved for private enterprise but gave guaran tees to foreign companies In such matters as transferability of profits, repatriation of capital, non-discrimination and freedom from undue State interference. 31. If prepared to give these safeguards, Turkey, Thornburg suggested, should, as a beginning, invite outstanding American firms to 'engage in selected Industries both to accomplish certain Important economic objectives and to serve as examples and train ing schools for Turkish Industrialists',, 'Pilot ,r Industries suggested included food canning, agricultural and constructional engineering, foundries, and by-products of coal and steel. Thornburg recommended that the American Embassy should 'cooperate f/ith the Turkish authorities in the promotion of these enterprises by appropriate publicity in America, both through its own channels and through the Department of Commerce, the Treasury Department and otherwise'. Turkish agencies for their part should 'make the programme known through such American organisations as the United States Chamber of Commerce, the American Manufacturers Association, the Foreign Policy Association and the usual press channels'. 32, In response, the Turkish Government in October 1947 announced that it would draw the required dividing line between the spheres of State and private enterprise! and extended a general invita tion to foreign capital and technical talent. So far, however, the promised line has not been drawn nor has foreign capital been given the guarantees required for investment. American and other foreign capitalists have consequently remained aloof, with the only noteworthy exception of the General Electric Company of New York, which, jointly with Turkish banking and business interests last year formed a Turkish electric lamp manufacturing company,Joint e ntp-pnr? al ° f T ^ 3 milllon it has subscribed 60 per cent. medium thrm^h as 0 this a PPear indeed to provide the only to mabo rmiob^ W ? lcil ^ rne J lcan or other foreign interests can hope tjo mai^o much headway in Turkey. h 1 '?, ^^ e p s ?^ rQ Df Public works Americans have been less iects hnnU^H n 1 1 ?’ t3 ^ ier foreign contractors except in pro- Imnort Rnnb d by i the A ^ rican def ence authorities or by the Export- f1plrlq )c s ^ ch as the development of roads, seaports and air- White onri v n e ^ in eering companies Westinghouse, J.G.

American Drilling and Exploration Company, one of the leading enterprises of its kind in America, .was appointed in 1947 to bore for oil in eastern Turkey. So far, however, it has achieved little^success in this necessarily long-term task, hampered as it is by the absence of any proper geological survey of the country, J 36. ihough slow to invest in Turkey, America has now become by far her biggest supplier and customer, owing to the elimination of Germany, which country before the war accounted for nearly half her imports and exports. In 1947 America supplied 33.4 per cent of her imports of TL685 million and took 23,6 per cent of her exports of TL625 million, compared with averages of only 11,8 per cent and I2 0 5 per cent respectively for 1936-38. Britain's '♦share in imports (compared with 1936-38) rose from 8.4,.per cent to 12.6 per cent^and In exports from 5.2 per cent to 16.4 per cent, while the increases in Italy's share were respectively from 4-03 per cent to^I4 per cent and from 6,5 per cent to 10.6 per cent. In physical volume Turkey's foreign trade was, however, still below the pre-war level, partly because industrialisation had in the meantime made her economy more self-contained. Foreign exchange considerations are now likely to make her buy less than from America and more from Britain, with which alone she has at present a large favourable balance of trade, yielding exchange which she can spend only within the sterling area.37. Foreign investment in Iran is mainly British and of major importance only in the oil industry, which ranks next to that of America, Venezuela and Russia, though providing employment for only a small part of the population of 17,000,000. 38. The Iranian Government has from time to time sought American investment hut with little success. Thus in the ’eighties of last century, when a counterweight to Russian and British politi cal penetration was anxiously desired, the then ruler (according to a well-authenticated review in the Journal of the Royal Central Asian Society of July 1939) informed the American Legation that he was ’’particularly desirous of having aid, both pecuniary and per sonal, from Americans” and was prepared to grant them preferential rights, including concessions covering railways and ”&amp;11 the mineral wealth of the country”. The American Minister strongly supported his proposals, informing Washington that there were ’’great opportunities for American capital in the exploitation of Persia’s wealth of coal, copper, lead and petroleum” in the ’’era of progress now dawning on that country”. The State^Department was, however, opposed to American investment in a region at that time so remote, corrupt and politically risky and warned its Minister against ’’furnishing grounds for the idea that he was active either for or against any concessions to private companies whether American or otherwise”. By the end of the century the Legation was itself emphasising that Iran ’’offered no business or investment prospects”. This view, though borne out by the^fate of all the shadowy concessions granted to other foreign nationals up to that time, was falsified in the case of oil when the British mining explorer D’Arcy discovered in 1908 an immensely rich oil field in the south-western part of a concession which he had ob tained in 1901 over the whole of Iran except the five northern provinces of Azerbaijan, Gilan, Mazanderan, Gurgan and Khurasan, These provinces were excluded because Russia considered them to be within her ’’sphere of influence”. This claim, and much more, Britain formally conceded under a secret treaty of 1907 (annulled during World War I) whereby the two Powers agreed between them selves to divide the country into two zonest the Russian, by far the larger, in the north (including Isfahan, Yezd and Kakh) and south, within which respective zones they were concessions to the exclusion of the other. the British in the each to be free to seek The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company took over D’Arcy’s rights in 1909; the British Government acquired a voting cent in 1913, together with the right to or subsidiaries obligation not of its board including an , subject to to interfere interest of 52.6 per veto any resolutions certain limitations, in commercial manage' ment. By then Russia had considerably extended her own interests. 39, The Iranian Government did not regain much freedom of action until 1920, when it again sought the participation of American in terests, particularly the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, to which it offered a -concession ovef the northern provinces of Mazanderan, Gilan and Gurgan and part of Azerbaijan, treating as null and void a concession which a Czarist subject had obtained over the same area in 1917 and had sold to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1920. The two companies reached a compromise whereby Standard received instead a half-interest in the Anglo-Iranian claim but the Government refused ratification owing to the opposi tion of the Soviet, based on the Russo-Iranian treaty of February 1921, under which the Soviet renounced nearly all the properties, concessions and other rights of the Czarist Government and Czar- ist subjects in Iran on condition that the Iranian Government did- 13 - 0 !M ( 7 &gt; State ranS:eer tllem t0 the Governmen1:; 01, citizana Cf any other Russl f3y, A1 a 1 ? d 4 - 0C r C ^ l ? a j i0n of I 9 4I “ 45 'and again in 1946 r j.v.r„ k, ^ r:Le&lt; J '' u t failed to obtain oonooasions over the eats wore P em?^ eS ln dl: 3 P ute ’ whlle American and British inter in unsuccessful in negotiations for concessions T v 1 ?

The need for development and social improvement is certainly great, considering the extreme backwardness of the ountr.y, which, though potentially rich, provides only a primitive subsistence for all but a small part of the population. The need in the case of transport would be even more pressing had not the Allies , not least America, done muchto improve it during the occupation, though their contribution, it is true, was largely confined to the building of the supply route between the Gulf and Russia (which necessitated not only the re-laying of the whole of the 870-mile track of the Trans-Iranian Railway but the construc tion of a line from Basra, the building of over 200 miles of high- grade road and a great enlargement of the ports). In air trans port, the American Trans-World Airline has since speeded Iran f s communications internally and with neighbouring countries by organising and until last year operating a national company, Iranian Airways, while other international lines, notably Pan American World Airways, British Overseas Airways and the Dutch K c L.M., have established landing and transit rights In the country. Transport is, however, still very deficient - even more so than Irrigation, which, though already extensive If primitive, could, If fully developed, greatly increase the cultivable area of the land (at present only 15 per cent of the total). 43» The Seven-Year Plan In its present form is based largely on the recommendations of American engineering experts, and the in dividual projects are now being studied by an American engineering consortium called Overseas Consultants Incorporated (In the pro motion of which Thornburg, who had previously surveyed Turkey andm NS -14- had earlier helped to establish American oil interests in Arabia) played an important part* This consortium, acting under an Iranian Planning Board, is now carrying out detailed surveys and has enlisted the cooperation of local British engineering experts, 44, It is hoped to finance the plan partly by appropriating 7,800 million rials from oil royalties, by borrowing 4,500 million rials from the State Bank and by borrowing the dollar equivalent of 6,700 million rials from the International Bank, Foreign trade itself leaves no surplus of foreign exchange. The execu tion of the plan in full is therefore largely dependent on assistance from the International Bank and this may in turn be conditional on internal reform, particularly of the financial administration, which is notoriously lax and often corrupt - a defect which the American (Millspaugh) missions of 1922-27 and 1943-45 vainly tried to remedy e Remedy may today bo just as hard, faced, as the Shah is, by a shady parliament, drawn largely from classes opposed to social reform. It cannot, therefore, readily be assumed that the International Bank will grant the loan required, for all that the American Government (which has already provided military advisers and a credit for arms) considers Iran, like Turkey, to be a bulwark against Russia and that the Bank ♦ itself recommended the appointment of Overseas Consultants, 45, America before the war did little trade with Iran and had no representation in Iranian banking, in which, as in oil and costwise shipping, the only large foreign interest was British, Iran's 'commercial” exports in 1937-38 (excluding, as her official returns do, shipments of Anglo-Iranian and the Societe Mahie Iran, the joint Russian-Iranian fishery monopoly) were little more than £8 million and her 'commercial' imports (excluding the imports of those two undertakings) £12 million, Russia accounted for 35 per cent and 32,5 per cent respectively of these exports and im ports, Germany for 29.6 per cent and 25,5 per cent, America for 8,2 per cent and 8,6 per cent and Britain for 6,3 per cent and 8,2 per cent, America largely increased her share of Iran’s war-time 'commercial' exports while Britain's share both of exports and imports fell. Since then Russia has fallen to fourth place In Iran's foreign trade, first place being jointly assumed by America and Britain, each of which, in the year ended March 1948, supplied about one-quarter of her 'commercial' imports of 4,702 ♦ million rials (say £30,6 million) and took 18 per cent of her 'commercial' experts of 2,325 million rials (say £18 million.) These exports were, however, largely exceeded by the exports of oIl,^which yielded Iran royalty and dividend participation of over £7 million for the year 1947j oil output in that year exceeded 20 million tons and is expected to rise to 32 million by 1951,* $ r ' 46 0 Centre estimated at SAUDI ARABIA, BAHREIIM AND KUV/AIT ^^iArabia^whose population is vaguely the entrv snd ini ro m:L 14ion, exercises strict supervision over rn! ^rV ? d l 1 nland - movement of non-Moslems.

Even so, the return on the capital em ployed has in recent years been very high, amounting in to £202,000, while the potentialities of other parts of this vast concession, covering ground known to have been extensively worked in ancient times, may well be considerable. 54 American penetration elsewhere in Saudi Arabia has been more of a commercial than an investment character and has been largely based on loans tying Saudi Arabia to American materials and equip ment. ' Noteworthy credits in 1946-47 were ^20 million by the Arabian-American Oil Company, for the building of a railway from Riyadh, the chief capital, to the port^of Dammam, near that c ^ m ~ nany’s oilfield, and its ports and refineries on the Persian Gulf, and a further credit of ^25 million by the American Export- Import Bank, mainly for road construction. These projects were entrusted to International Bechtel Incorporated, the American contractors, who had established a branch in the country m 19±6, *■ W)- 17 - and were supplementary^to extensive road construction carried ou ■'•’ the oil and mininy companies for the develonment of their own concessions. ^■5. i^lso noteworthy had been American participation in the development of air communications. In this field Trans-World Airline, In addition to privileged landing facilities at Dhahran (centre of the Arabian-Amerlean Company's oilfield^ for its own tnrourh-services from America, manages the Saudi Arabian Airline, which it organised as a State monopoly in 1946. oo„ In shipping, the Arablan-American Oil Company built not only its own ports at Ras Tanura and al-Khobar,' on the Persian Gulf, Jout established services thence to Bahrein, General cargo traflic is, however, mainly through the Red Sea Ports, where an Egyptian^(formerly British) company, the Khedivial Mail Line, still maintains a near-monopoly of coast-wise a.nd transhipment traffic. ^Ee foreign trade of Saudi Arabia has greatly increased with the development of the oil industry, which now contributes In royalties much of the national revenue. By far the larger part of this trade has naturally been with America, Imports Irom that country In the first nine months of 1948 amounted to I million compareu with ^44el million in the corresponding period of 1947 and a nine-months’ average of only ^1,6 million •^ n 1936-38. American trade participation has been assisted by the activities of the American Eastern Corporation, which was formed In 1945 as an outgrowth of the oil and mining companies, mainly for the purpose of encouraging trade with Saudi Arabia. Local British commercial and contracting agents, represented chiefly by Gellatly Hankey, have met considerable competition from this company and from International Bechtel, though they have, on the'Whole, benefited from the great contribuit ion which America has made towards the development of the country. 58 0 Banking, the scope for which is small, has remained largely In the hands of branches of a Dutch Institution, the Netherlands Trading Society, which carries the accounts of the Government and the oil and mining companies©'be 59 .

Through the intemediary next of o con fidence of the British, subject of German birth, who enjoyed the to interests British, German and Turkish Governments and concerned, the Deutsche Bank and R oyal Dutch-Shol ^ tern claims and in 1911 formed a company called African -na kas Concessions to press them. It was agreed that the cunpa ^ ^ act for the two claimants not only m Iraq Ottoman empire, fib The canital of £80,000 was initially held as to 25 per cent by S e r cent S of e the n ckita P i er to 0 him K^^toToyal Butch-Shel^ Brit^h^ank^wMcrLDd of thr^ler^artios.

The British and Gorman Governments, then j°™ ar ^ r o reconciliation of their conflicting claims was fully privy to these arrangements, and approved thom - ^ 00 °„ h brought nearer on oil, as already on other matters, when, on March 19, ^914, the two Governments and the private interests signed at the Foreign Office an agreement transferring the holding of the National lank of TurkeyUn equal ports to the Deutsche Royal Dutch-Shell and allotting to the „nglo-Iranian Oil Comp y the whole of an increase of £80,000 m capital, o b interest of 50 per cent and leaving the interest o± eaah °f * h ® h ofhlr companies at 25 per cent. Anglo-Iranian and Royal Dutch-Shell agreed at the same time to transfer to Gulbenkian, fP° m participation, a 5 per cent non-voting interest m the increased capital•-19- IV v&gt; 64. It was also agreed that the three participating groups should undertake ’’not to be interested directly or indirectly in the production or manufacture of crude oil in the Ottoman empire (except in Kuwait or the so-called 11 transferred territories” on the Iraqi-Iranian frontier) otherwise than through the Turkish Petroleum Company - a provision similar to that embodied in the agreement of 1911. The agreement of 1914 made no reference to any oil concession ? though it stated that the Company would n explore” for oil ? and in fact it obtained a vague promise of a concession in June 1914. 65. Except for the reaffirmation of the restrictive clause, the agreement, as far as it went, was a triumph for British interests and in particular for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, whose only claim for consideration derived from the British Government, which in 19^3 had acquired control of it and had thus become a very interested party, 66. The weakness of the agreement was that the Turkish Government refused to grant any concession pending agreement, inter alia , as to own share in the enterprise, which the parties to it had ignored, though its participation was a condition of the agreement with the D^ycjjtsche Bank in 1904 - an agreement which held precedence over all others. The validity even of the underlying claim was denied by the Minister of Public Works and by Kemal Attatiirk, leader of the only representative political party. Validity was even more strongly denied by the American Department of State, then beginning to take a close interest in the region. War soon intervened, leaving the question undecided. 6?. It was revived in an acute form when, under an agreement made between the British and French Governments in April 1920 - when Iraq had come under British mandate - the British Government undertook to transfer to the French the confiscated German interest of 25 per cent, or, in the event of the oilfields concerned being developed by ”Governmeno action”, to sell the French 25 per cent of the output at market price. It was also agreed that should the oilfields be developed, not by Government action but by the Turkish Petroleum Company or any successor company, the native Government or native interests should be allowed, if they so desired, to participate up to a maximum of 20 per cent in the capital, one-half of the first 10 per cent, to be contributed by the French and the rest by the other participants in proportion to their holdings, 68, This agreement at once aroused the ire of the American Government, which contended (1) that it was in violation of the principle that the mandated territories 'should be held and administered in such a way as to assure equal treatment to the commerce and to the citizens of all nations'; (2) that it appeared to violate British pledges that 'the natural resources of Mesopotamia (i.e. Iraq) are to be secured to the people of Mesopotamia and to the future Arab State to be established in that region'; (3) that it constituted a premature and ex parte judgment by the British Government of the validity of the concessions of the Turkish Petroleum Company - a judgment to which the American Government would not subscribe; (4} that &lt;it ignored American interests, which must be considered inasmuch as such rights as the Allied Powers possessed in the mandated areas accrued to them as the direct result of the war against the Central Powers, in which America had been a participant and to the winning of which she had made substantial contributions. These con tentions were pressed the more vigorously because at that time America feared that her own oil resources were becoming exhausted.- 20 - 69. The outcome of what became a long and acrimonious dispute between the American and British Governments ^ was that the Turnisn Petroleum Company redistributed its capital in 1927? allowing 95 per cent in equal parts to Anglo-Iranian, Royal Butch-ohe 1 9 the Gompagnie Prancaise des Petroles (nominee of tne prenen Government) and an American group (the near Bast Developmen Corporation) representing the Standard Oil Company of ^ e¥ Socony-Vacuum, the Gulf Corporation, Atlantic Refining an ^ American Petroleum (The three last-named later transferred their interests to the othor two American companies). It was provioea, as under the 1914 agreement, that control should remain permanently British, and that Anglo-Iranian should be compensated ior the reduction in its participation by a royalty on ouuput. The I^aqi Government, then subordinate to the mandatory Power, had already granted the Turkish Petroleum Company a concession over tne oil fields in 1925. It was offered no part of the capital, but was allowed a royalty on output. 70. The American Government did not, on the occasion of the agreement of 1927, again remind the British Government of its pledge to secure the natural resources of Iraq^to the Iraqis. Neither did it raise any objection to a condition v/hich violated its own anti-trust laws - namely the re-insertion of the clause binding the members of the Turkish Petroleum Company (which now included the Americans) not to become interested directly or indirectly in oil in the former Ottoman empire otherwise than through the Turkish Petroleum Company. The British parties, now that circumstances had so greatly altered, strongly opposed continuation of the clause but in the end, in 1928, jaaa to accep the inflexible French argument that the clause was still binding. In this way, through what first came to be commonly called the ’’Red Line” agreement, the American and French companies obtained a large stake not only in the great oilfields of Iraq, but^ in the concessions which the Turkish Petroleum Company - known since June 1929 as the Iraq, Petroleum Company - was later to acquire around the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Aden,and in Syria, the Lebanon and almost every other likely oil-bearing part ox the Ottoman empire. 71. In 1947, however, Standard of New Jersey and Socony-Vacuum were themselves finding the agreement irksome, though up till the t jj| very much to their advantage, and infringed it by agreeing to take- up respectively 30 per cent, and 10 per cent 01 the capital of the Arabian American Oil Co„ On being challenged by Gulbenkian and the French they guaranteed instead loans of a corresponding amount - which, rather strangely, was not considered to be a breach - with the option to convert into shares if the consent of the other parties should be obtained or the Red Line agreement should be cancelled. 72. After lengthy argument in the courts an arrangement was come to in November 1948 whereby the agreement was cancelled. The French company received in return assurance of supplies_from the Iraq Petroleum Company in proportion to its stated requirements instead of as, until then, in proportion-to its share interest. The Americans obtained freedom to become shareholders in the previously forbidden oil of arabia. They also obtained escape from a pledge which, they had pleaded, had been all along a burden on their conscience; they retained, however, the fruit of their transgression and so had the best of both worlds. The British companies concerned, who have been curiously silent about the whole matter, appear to have gained little. Perhaps they argued that, since there was now little Red Line territory left to be conceded, the agreement was in any case outworn, and that it^ was as well to meet the wishes of the Americans, whose cooperationm ^ 1 - 21 - vu elsewhere the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company particularly needed in connection with its ambitious plans for future development. The se ement provided that the Iraq Petroleum Company should not on±;y continue to sell its output (including that from fields in Qatar and elsewhere outside Iraq) to its shareholders in proportion each shareholder should in future others* 'on equitable terms'* oil prospective requirements over and cost - a provision which difference except to the no refining or marketing sell his quota in equa Iraqi oil itself costs shilling a ton) that at cost (plus to their share interest but be entitled to buy from the in proportion to its stated above the quota receivable at in practice appears likely to make little Compagnie Prancaise, Gulbenkian (who has facilities of his own) will continue to parts to the other four shareholders, much less than market value and bears a r P^ c ^ L ro^lty charge than that to which Iraq might consider itself historically entitled. 73. ^Even* however* if the Iraq Petroleum partners are drawing in benelits from the concession much more than Iraq is drawing in &gt;royalties, it can at least be said what Iraq is receiving royalties at a ^higher rate than Iran (including in her case dividend participation) and at a much higher rate than Kuwait, though at a much lower rate than Saudi Arabia, Royalties etc, amounted* for the year 1945-46 to £2,300,000 compared with ordinary Government revenue of £1 /,300*000, Royalty receipts will of course rise wuh output* which it is planned to increase from 4,700* 000 tons m ^ 1 946 to 1 3?000*000 by 1951 and about 30,000*000 tons by 1956. This programme may* however* be considerably delayed by events in Palestine, through which country half of the company's output is normally piped to the Anglo-Iranian - Royal-Dutch Shell refinery at Haifa, which is now at a standstill. So, too* is the building of the new pipeline to that centre. The hold-up has immobilised much of the issued capital, which was increased last year by £4 1 4?000,000 to £ 83 9 500,000 o I 74. Foreign investment elsewhere in Iraq has been comparatively small and almost entirely British. Iraq in 1920 had* it is true, much scope for development* since her territory, then for the most part gone to waste, was capable of being restored to something approaching its ancient fertility by irrigation and by control of *the flooding perennially caused by its two great rivers - the Tigris and the Euphrates, Iraq, which forms, with Turkey the natural highway for land and air transport between Europe and the farther East* also offered great scope for the development of communications. In each case* however, the responsibility rested primarily with the State and the mandatory Power* and not with private capitalists, domestic or foreign, 75. Iraq was hardly mistress in her own house until 1932 when she became a member of the League of Nations and took over from the British authorities full management of her own affairs, while continuing to maintain close relations with Britain under the terms of the Treaty of 1930. The mandatory Power did much to develop communications. British forces* even before the assumption of the mandate in 1920, had built much of the present port of Basra and much of Iraq's^ present railway system of nearly 1 *600 miles - taking over a task which the German-controlled Anatolian Railway had, at the outbreak of war* barely begun. These two British undertakings, which cost something approaching £20*000,000 were handed over to the Iraqi State for approximately £1,000,000 under a general treaty made with Iraq in 1930. The Iraqi State carried development further, particularly during the recent war, when, with the cooperation of the Allies and largely for their account, the port and railway facilities were greatly increased for the purpose of supplying Russia. Over the period from 1920 road communications were alsoopened up, particularly with Syria, and air-fields serving the principal international airlines, whose function has m recon years become very important in this region. The htate has on the other hand, greatly neglected the land, which is the basis’ of the economy, making little progress with the reform of tenure or with irrigation or flood control, ^° u ^ it h u s is true, a good beginning has been made in “ schemes are now being considered. As it is. Jhe Iraq.i maso , which number some 5 million, are afflicted with a vicious oj^tem of landlordism and deeply ground in poverty. 77. Iraq, has, area and holds amounting like those it is true, the advantage that she is in the sterling very large war-time accumulation oi sterling, at the beginning of 1947 to £ 65 , 000 , 000 . These balances, of Egypt and Palestine, do not, however belong to the State but to various unenterprising private interests. More important still, they can be used only within the sterling are , except for yearly releases, together with Iraq s own earnings f scarce exchange, of £ 5 , 500,000 for conversion into hard currency 4 a restriction which ties her to^trade with Britain requirements of capital goods might be more easi y America or other countries. She has a chronicaliy^ of trade, imports being normally much more than twice exports. Her principal supplier is Britain, which m when her obtainable from adverse balance as large as 1947 accounted for Uk.O per cent of her imports and 15.2 per cent of her exports (excluding oil) compared with respective percentages of 8.3 dnci 4.6 for America; the rest of her traders chiefly with neighbouring countries and India. She is now, because of stoppage of oil deliveries across Palestine and the corresponding reduction in oil royalties, finding it hard to finance even her minimum import requirements or cover the ordinary cost of Government. Added to these difficulties is the strain on poliiical relations with Britain caused by her refusal to ratify the tr^-o. y of Portsmouth of January 1948. In these circumstances the International Bank is naturally slow to grant the application which she railways has made and other for a loan purposes. of $ 75 , 000,000 for irrigation,-23- SYRIA AN D LEBANON. Z^* ^ he L ^ banon Syria 5 whose population now exceeds hi million buen a p ^ ncb sphere of influence, though not politically until they came under the french mandate in 1920. At that time the french already owned the principal port (Beirut) and the rallw fy (the Lamas-Hama et Prolongements) which together equivalent of £52 million. They also owned the telephone mad telegraph service, the tramway and electricity service of 1 not ? amascus » whiGb was Belgian-owned) the tobacco G _ na par ge 1 an ded property, and were prominent in banking. insurance and shipping. French cultural influence, strong, especially in the Lebanon. 79. On too, was «?■ . assuming the mandate France made the two countries an economic, but not a political, unit and introduced a currency interchangeable with the franc. The Banque de Syrie et du Liban (atrench company owned by the Ottoman Bank) became bank of issue an m general acted as central bank but engaged also in commercial banking ana actively promoted French interests, assisted by other , cin ks, particularly the Compagnie Algerienne de Credit et de Banque, the Credit Foncier d*Algeria and (during the ’thirties) Lhe Banque National© pour le Commerce et i’Industrie. 80. The French Administration greatly improved and extended the telephone and telegraph service (which it took over) the roads and airfields and the port of Tripoli, which it equipped to handle over 4 million tons_of crude oil from the pipe line opened from Iraq, in 1 934. New French private investment was also very considerable, particularly in tramways and electricity, hotels, road transport, oil-refining, and cement. The basis of the economy continued to be the land, which provides a living for a ? au \ two-thirds of the population,, about a quarter of which is ti_ Lebanon, where capital is mainly concentrated 0 81, Americans engaged in little investment in the territory other than on a partnership basis with the British and French in oil, through the interests acquired there during the ’thirties by the Iraq Petroleum Company, ninety-five per cent of whose capital is owned by the Anglo-Iranian, Royal Dutch-Shell, Standard of New m*. Jersey, Socony-Vacuum and the Compagnie Francaise des Petroles. These interests consist of concessions (as yet unproductive) over most of the territory and a pipe line of 2 million tons capacity from^ Iraq, to Tripoli for delivery of crude to the French and Americans, The Americans are likewise interested in the projected doubling of this pipe line as well as in the much larger lines and Anglo-Iranian oilfields to Lebanon been negotiating for some time for the Tripoli, where the only treatment plant a small installation built by the Compagnie the purpose of supplying the local market, which in projected from the Arabian and Syria. They have also building of refineries at at present is Francaise for it shares with Socony-Vacuum, Royal Dutch-Shell and smaller interests. All these projects are, however, now at a standstill, pending a settlement in Palestine acceptable to the Arab States. 82. In aviation, only Air France served the territory before the war but other foreign lines are now also well represented and not least Pan American World Airways, which alone maintains a service from New York to Damascus (stopping intermediately at Shannon, London, Istanbul and Ankara) and a round-the-world service via Damascus, Under an inter-governmental agreement, of ^pril,”T^47, granting rights not yet extended to other foreign lines, Pan American is also entitled to pick up and discharge international traffic at Damascus. In 1946 it organised and staffed the native linei, Syrian Airways, but financial difficulties forced that company to close down early in 1948 .83. In the sphere of public works the Lebanese ^Government ^ has engaged the American v/estinghouse Company to build a new airiieia in replacement of that at Beirut, while British contractors, Bir Alexander Gibb and Partners, have been chosen as advisers by tne Syrians, particularly for irrigation, which the French administration had largely neglected. In both countries French influence has declined considerably since tne end of the mandate, despite the efforts made to sustain it by a comprehensive intelligence and propaganda organisation called Seriac, which the French Government and leading business interests concerned formed for this purpose in 1945. now been further weakened country, in January 1948, of her currency from that In the case of Syria the connection has as the result of t he withdrawal of that from the franc area and the separation of the Lebanon - a decision which has seriously disturbed the economic relation between the two States and endangered the maintenance of their customs union* 85. In their foreign trade America has greatly improved her position as a seller but not as a buy^r, her share of their combined imports having risen from only 7 per cent in 193o to^ 25 per cent in the first nine months of 1947 ? whereas Britain s proportion increased only from 13 per cent to 17 per cent ^ and that of France was barely maintained around 12 per cent. America continued to take about 6 per cent of the combined export trade, becoming in 1947 a larger buyer than France and Britain, though smaller than Italy and much smaller than Palestine, the tradicional market of Syria und the Lebanon*PALESTINE 85. Capital investment in Palestine under the: mandate of 1920- 48 has been mainly connected with Jewish settlement, though other investment has also been very considerable, particularly in oil refining, potash-mining, electricity production, and banking. 86. A group of American economists headed by Mr. Robert R. Nathan, in a study prepared in 1946 for the American Palestine Institute (a non-partisan body) has estimated that the total in flow^ of funds during the period 1919-39 amounted approximately to £P.I30 million, of which Jewish immigrants (chiefly from Germany and central and eastern Europe) provided £P*75 million, Zionist and kindred agencies in America and Europe £P.20 million, and British and other business interests £P.28 million. The Nathan group estimated that about two-thirds of the total was invested (mainly in industry, agriculture, housing and public construc tion) and the remainder consumed in the transitional current ex penses of immigrants, in social services and other current ex penditure . 87. The war put a stop to immigration and hindered capital in vestment except in major industries contributing to the war effort. At the same time, as the result of heavy British mili tary expenditure, together with the continuance of dollar con tributions from Jewish agencies in the United States, Palestine ceased to be a net importer of a capital and became instead a large creditor country, owning at the end of the war London bal ances of over £120 million (most of which was Jewish-owned). These balances were reduced to approximately £100 million by February 1948, when the British authorities, fearing that con tinuance of the drain on the scale then taking place might en danger Palestine’s future development and aggravate the threat to sterling, blocked all but a small part, leaving the question of future releases to be the subject of consultation with the commission for Palestine established by the United Nations. At the same time Palestine was removed from the sterling area, though readmission was promised consideration should the successor Governments desire it. 88 $ Palestine is therefore hardly likely to obtain much of her immediate capital requirements from Britain. Her total require ments the Nathan group had estimated at £P.475-675 million for the decade 1946-56, based on Jewish immigration over that period of 620-1,125,000, the major anticipated needs being £P.198-265 million for housing, £p.75-102 million for agriculture and irriga tion, £P 0 38-68 million for immigration services, £35-50 million for manufacturing industry, and £P.27-41 million for power in stallations. The group reckoned that even if sterling balances of £P,90-100 million were released and all other capital sources fully exploited, the lower immigration estimate would require the raising of foreign loans of £P,150-250 million and the upper foreign loans of £P.325-425 million. Now that the sterling balances have been blocked, Palestine’s loan requirements will be all the greater, the more because the influx of Jews over the next three years is now expected to average 300,000 a year, re quiring ^2,000 million for settlement alone. 89. It vi/ould be natural that the new State of Israel, whose frontiers within Palestine have yet to be drawn, should expect large assistance from America, seeing that that country has been one of the principal supporters of Zionism and that Jewish in terests are strongly represented in the American financial world.- 26 - The Export-Import Bank has indeed now authorised a credit of ^55 million for equipment, materials and services required for various agricultural projects, and earmarked a further ^65 million for communications, manufacturing, housing and other proj ects• 90. Private American remittances to Palestine have hitherto consisted of little more/charitable contributions made ^ through •I * ( Jewish agencies. These^contributions exceeded $140 million during the period 1939-47 but those made since 1944 have had to be devoted mainly to the relief of destitute post-war immigrants. American business investment has been meagre owing to the limited opportunities presented for large-scale enterprise in so small and poorly endowed a country, nearly half of whose population (which amounted to 2 million in 1947, of which about 700,000 was Jewish) draws its living from the land. 91. The only large American capital Investment in Palestine is in oil. The Standard Oil Company of New York (merged since 1931 in the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company) obtained from the Turkish Government before the first world war a concession covering a % considerable area in southern Palestine but it has so far failed to make anything of this concession. Petroleum Development (Palestine) a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Company, of whose capital Socony-Vacuum and the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey jointly hold 23%. per cent, has likewise failed to discover oil in the concession which it holds in south ern Palestine. The American companies have, however, a large indirect stake in Palestine in that the Iraq Petroleum Company’s principal pipeline, after crossing Transjordan, traverses north ern Palestine to Haifa, where its crude oil Is refined by Con solidated Refineries, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company and Royal Dutch-Shell. The Palestine section of the pipeline is estimated to have a replacement value of only £3,000,000 but without It the Iraq Petroleum Company, in which the American companies are so considerably Interested, would (as at present because of the Palestine dispute) have no outlet for its production but the pipe-line traversing Syria and northern Lebanon to Tripoli, by which route half of its output is normally exported. &gt; 92. Socony-Vacuum has also a large indirect interest in Con solidated Refineries, since it normally draws from that company the supplies required for its extensive storage and distributing organisation in Palestine. Consolidated Refineries is by far the largest enterprise in the country, its replacement value being estimated to exceed £30 million. Work on the refinery was be fain in 1938 and had raised the treatment capacity to 4 million* tons in 1944. It was planned in 1947 to increase the capacity to 9 million tons by 1951 but this programme has since been jeopardised by events in Palestine, involving the seizure of the refinery by the Jewish authorities and, as a counter-measure, the stoppage of crude supplies hy Iraq, These events have also seriously interfered with the plans which the American oil interests had made for the building of a pipe-line from their properties in Arabia to the Mediterranean and also with the plans which the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, jointly with the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and Socony-Vacuum, had made for the construction of a pipe-line from Iran and Kuwait to the Mediterranean. 93. Among other major enterprises /the Palestine Electric Corporation, Palestine Potash, and the Anglo-Palestine Bank may include a large American or other foreign interest, since the Zionist organisation did much to promote them. The Anglo- Palestine, though incorporated in England, has long been the bank of that world organisation and now acts as bank of issue to the/'V V -27- Israell Government, while, as in the past, conducting much of the deposit, agricultural and industrial banking in Palestine. Its board is almost entirely composed of Jews resident in Palestine and its^capital of approximately £860,000, much of which was Issued in London, appears to be very largely Jewish- owned, 94. The^Palestine Electric Corporation, whose assets exceed £3 million, is also mainly Jewish-owned and Jewish directed. So, too. Is^Palestine Potash, five of whose board of nine are British or British and Palestinian, three American, and one French. •' I Most of its directors have to be British or British and Palestin ians together but in the situation which has now arisen effeetive£fu*U|i.?*A control may become Israeli or Israeli-American.The company^ (capital which is incorporated In England where a 40 per cent voting Interest Is beL' owns exclusive rights over the potash and other mineral deposits of the Dead Sea, and occupied until recently a sound position, thanks to the support of the British Government, which gave it considerable financial assistance and guaranteed it an outlet for its production. During the war it became one of this country's princIpal^sources of potash, the only other large supplier being Spain,^which In 1944 and 1945 occupied first place; and though Palestine as well as Spain has recently been displaced by Germany and France (Britain's main normal sources) its continuance as a supplier of high-grade potash Is considered an important British interest. It is, however, nov/ faced with serious difficulties, since the works (which are situated partly within Jewish and partly within Arab territory) have been brought to a standstill by the strife in Palestine. Besides, there is the complication that part of the concession is held from the Government of Trans jordan, which may be unwilling to continue It If the Israeli Government does not respect Arab rights. 95. Non-Jewish British interests are largely concerned in other enterprises. Thus the Balfour Beatty group owns the Jerusalem Electric and Public Service Corporation (capital £P.475,000) while Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) was, under the British mandate, banker to the Palestine Government and agent for the Palestine Currency Board, as well as banker for nearly all the British firms operating in Palestine. In its official business it has now been supplanted by the Anglo~Palestine Bank, and in its commercial business it 'may also lose ground. American representa tion in this field, as In investment in general in Palestine, Is small« 96. In Palestine's external trade (which in proportion to the population Is much larger than that of other countries in the Middle East) America has little improved her position as a sup plier or a buyer. In 1937 she supplied approximately £P,I,ICO,000 of Palestine’s Imports of £P.15,900,000, compared with £P.2,600,000 supplied by Germany, £P.2,500,000 by Britain and £P,I,400,000 each by Syria and Roumania, In the first eleven months of 1947, she supplied approximately £P,7,400,000 of Palestine's imports of £P.7I,000,000 (excluding oil, as before the war) compared with £P.16,400,000 supplied by Britain, £P.5,900,000 by Italy £P.5,400,000 by Turkey, £F.3,400,000 by Syria, £P.2,900,000 by Czechoslovakia and £P.2,500,000 by Belgium. America took only a negligible part of Palestine’s exports of £p.5,800,000 (excluding oil) in 1937 and less than £P.700,000 of her exports of £P,15,600,000 (excluding oil) in the first eleven months of 1947, whereas Britain’s share rose from £P.3,200,000 to £P.7,400,000, that of Egypt to £P,5,400,000, that of Greece to £P ,2,600,,000 and that of Belgium to £P .1,100,000. In her external trade as a whole Palestine had in each year (as is natural In a developing economy) a heavy adverse balance of trade, which in 1947 was particularly large in commerce with Britain and§ - 28 - America. This circumstance makes the blocking ol her sterli ^ balances all the more serious for her, while _ the that she cannot switch her exports to America (which is not her natural market) renders her the more independent on loans or capital imports from that country. *mmmt -29- EGYPT a 97. Egypt, which came under British tutelage in 1882 and then ceased for all practical purposes to he part of the Ottoman empire, owes^much of her development to foreign capital, both directly and in the form of loans to the State for irrigation, railways cons tructive purposes. Thus, according to a semi- oi..,icxal Egyptian estimate, investors abroad owned, around the beginning of the century, approximately 90 per cent of the State e^t and op per cent of the paid-up share and debenture capital of joint-stock companies (other than the Suez Canal Company) operating principally^in Egypt. in the ensuing years redemption and the growth and investment of native capital largely reduced the proportion but even in 1 934 investors abroad held 41 per cent of the State^debt of £E.95.4 million, 54 per cent of the paid-up share capital of £E.54.9 million and 42 per cent of the debenture capi oi of £E.3o.3 million of joint stock companies (other than the Suez Canal Company) operating principally in Egypt, toieigners domiciled in Egypt were also in each case considerable holders, while companies not operating principally in Egypt had extensive assets there. Investors abroad (principally French and British; owned the vast bulk of the Suez Canal Company’s share and debenture capital of £E.22.5 million, as well as a preponderant equity in company reserves (which amounted to £E.22,6 million). The large Greek and Italian colonies in Egypt wure moreover strongly represented in small-scale enterprise, owning assets of several million pounds, earned almost entirely within the country, 98. Joint stock companies operating principally in Egypt (ex cluding the Suez Canal Company) owned wholly or mainly abroad had in 1 933 a paid-up share and debenture capital of £E.81.4 million. The French-controlled companies accounted for £E.38.8 million, the British-controlled for £E.31.9 million, the Belgian- controlled for £E, 6 . / million, the Italian-controlled for £E.1,9 million and the Swiss-controlled for £E.1.4 million. The French interest Was mainly in mortgage (£E.34.3 million) and industry and commerce (£E.4.2 million); the British in industry and commerce (SB. 14.1 million) mortgage (£E.9*7 million) banking and finance (£E.2.9 million) transport (£E.2.7 million) and land (£E.2.4 million);^ the Belgian in land (£E„4»3 million) and tramways (£E.1.1 million); the Italian in banking and finance (£E.1.3 million):^and the Swiss in industry and commerce (£E.1.1 million). American interests were represented largely by branches engaged in assembly and distribution. 99. Since 1934 the relative position held by foreign capital has continued to decline, partly because of redemption, partly be cause of the abolition of foreign privileges under the Montreux Convention of 1937? and partly because the growth of native capital, particularly during the war, was adequate for new investment, much of which the State itself undertook through a national institution called the Bank Misr. Besides, Egypt no longer loomed with favour on foreign enterprise (except in certain spheres such as petroleum development) and in 1946 took strong measures to discourage it, decreeing that at least 51 per cent of the share capital of new Egyptian joint stock companies should be allotted to Egyptians; that at least 40 per cent of the directors of any Egyptian joint stock company should be Egyptian; and that within three years Egyptians should form the vast bulk of the employees in. Egypt of all companies, whether registered in m Egypt or abroad.100. Already in 1946 almost the whole of the State debt ox £E.125 million was held internally and probably much more than _ half of the aggregate share and debenture capital of joint stocK companies (other than the Sues Canal Company) then operating principally in Egypt. 101. The oil industry was one foreign capital was encouraged of 1936. as the result of the regulations early in 1937&gt; the the Standard of California and over large areas in 1936, thus of the few in which the entry of after the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty liberalisation of the mineral Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, Socony-Vacuum obtained licences entering a field until then re served to Anglo-Egyptian'Oilfields ( a subsidiary of Royal Dutch- Shell and Anglo-I rani an) which had long been the only producer. By 1940 the American investment in the industry, according to tne U.S. Department of Commerce, amounted to ^9.4 million, compared with $11.5 million in general distribution and pH .4 million in manufacture. Since then new American investment has continued to be mainly in oil prospecting, the most active company being Socony- Vacuum, which is now working in partnership with Anglo-ngyp tian Oilfields in Sinai where their joint subsidiary found oil m promising quantity at Sudr in 1947 and at Asl in. January 1949* ^ In the same month Standard of New Jersey, also struck oil farther south at Wadi Reran. 102, Certain American concerns have been active in supplying equipment for new Egyptian enterprises, the Lockheed Aircrait ^ Corporation, for instance, for air services, the American Chemical Construction Corporation for the building of nitrate^ plant s, and Goodrich and Kohorn for, respectively, the construction of tyre and rayon factories. Contrary to experience elsewhere, American . interests have, however, taken no prominent part in tendering for the large public works projects launched since the end of the war, nor indeed have British contractors (who before the war had the j field largely to themselves) been very successful, the major contracts being awarded to French, Swedish and Swiss firms, 103, The only other sphere in Egypt in which the Americans have been conspicuous has been in the provision of through civil air transport, which one of their leading companies - Trans-Jorid- Airline - entered shortly after the war and almost monopolised until the re-establishment of British services on a civil basis in^194o, - its lead in this field being all the greater because of American superiority in civil aircraft-building, which Britain during the war was forced to neglect. 104, In trade, American penetration in Egypt has been prominent and would probably have been much more so if Britain had not severely rationed conversion of Egypt's war-time accumulation of sterling since the autumn of 1947 and so tied her to purchases within the sterling area. Even as it was, America in 1947 supplied over 11 per cent of Egypt’s imports, or more than half as much as , Britain, compared with less than one-third as much in 1938, though the British contribution to'Egypt’s total imports (which meanwhile rose from £E.36,950,000 to £E.103,900,000) had fallen only slightly. Britain, unlike America, is, however, a natural market for Egypt’s exports and the fact that Egypt left the sterling area in July 1947 does not make her less tied to trade with this country, until at least her frozen sterling balances have been liquidated. These balances - which, like those of Palestine and I rag, arose from British military expenditure at grossly inflated prices - stood at the end of November 1948 at £272 million.
