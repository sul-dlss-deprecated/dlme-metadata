In light of events, and of his crew being sick, Tronson states that he made his way back to Bushire via Lingah [Bandar-e Lengeh]. Tronson also writes of a robbery at sea: the theft of cargo from a boat owned by Mohammed bin Thonny [Muhammad bin Thani], who he describes as a Doah [Doha] merchant. The cargo (included 3000 dollars' worth of pearls) was stolen from the boat (itself stolen from El Biddah [al Bidda]) by a vessel manned by Manasseh [Manasir] bedouins.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673698.0x000009#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
