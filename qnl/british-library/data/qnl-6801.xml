'5. 234- THE WAR WITH TURKEY. Note by the Under Secretary, India Office. 1. Before discussitig the views advanced in Sir Arthur Hirtzel's able and interesting memorandum, I should like to say a few words in explanation and defence of the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Asiatic Turkey, of which I was a member. They may be thought to have now little more than an academic interest, as they have been superseded by the Franco-Russian and Anglo-French agreements regarding the recognition by the three powers of a 'greater ' Arabian State or confederacy of States, and the acquisition by the powers themselves of considerable regions of Asiatic Turkey. But so long as the war hangs in uncertain balance, it is always possible that circumstances may prevent these agreements from materialising and may again clear the table for other solutions of the Turkish question. In that case the Committee's recommendations may be found to have an importance which does not attach to them at present, and for this reason a few words in their vindication may not be out of place. 2. The inter-departmental Committee was convened at a time when the occupation of Constantinople by the Allies was thought to be a matter of a few weeks. The Committee assumed and was instructed to assume that Russia would then be placed in possession of the imperial city, together with the straits of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles and the landward approaches thereto, and that an early opportunity of concluding peace with the Turks might arise. The business of the,Committee was therefore to determine the requirements of Great Britain, and to propose a scheme which would be consistent with the legitimate expectations of her Allies, and which the Turks might be brought to accept. Any such scheme, it was seen, would have to satisfy Russian interests in Armenia, French interests in Syria and Cilicia, Italian interests in the region of Adalia, and possibly Greek interests on the seaboard : and the higher British desiderata were pitched, the greater would be the claims of che Allies. The Committee was at first strongly attracted to the idea of complete partition. To get rid of the Ottoman empire, conSning Turkish sovereignty to a petty kingdom in Anatolia, securing independence to the tribal chiefs of Arabia, and dividing among the Allied powers the rest of Asiatic Turkey, seemed the fitting end of a long-drawn tragedy. But the more the Committee studied partition, the less, they liked it. Their objections to it and their reasons for preferring a scheme of decentralisation that would give a chance to the several nationalities of which the Turkish empire is composed, and would involve no military responsibilities, are given at length in the report, and I need not repeat them. What [ would submit is that the scheme, if carefully examined, and if the circumstances in which alone it could be introduced are fairly appreciated, is not amenable to the criticism that it provides ' no safeguard ' whatever against the recovery by Germany of the supreme position in Turkey ' which she was found to possess in 1911.'' In the circumstances supposed the situation which led to German ascendancy in the pre-war period would be fundamentally changed, Constantinople and the Straits would be in Russian hands, and the German road to the East barred. Germany would be exhausted and her finances in disorder. Turkey would have lost the importance and prestige which the unique site of her capital had given her for four hundred and fifty years. The Young Turks and the pro-German party would have &gt; been overthrown and the way cleared for the political and military predominance of Russia and the financial predominance of France. The special arrangements contemplated in the scheme for the^Armenian vilayets would have brought them under the immediate guardianship of Russia, and from this vantage ground that Power would have exercised a military OT 394 AI ascendancy over the Turkish Government in its new capital of Brusa or Ivonia. These safeguards against a revival of German influence are not recited in the draft of the decentralisation scheme proposed by the Committee, but they would exist all the same, for they constitute the circumstances in which alone peace conditions of the kind could be imposed on Turkey. It was also part of the scheme that the revision of the Bagdad Railway concessions should be one of the conditions of peace with the Central Powers, and that the Turkish Government should be required to confirm and make effective all concessions and engagements which before the war it had made or entered into with any of the Allies. 3. The scheme, as already said, has been superseded by the agreements recently concluded between France, Great Britain and Russia, and it is not put forward now on its merits for adoption. But it illustrates the broad principle that any settlement which the Allies may make with Turkey should be viewed quite as much with reference to the general issue of the war as to the actual terms of the settlement itself. If the general issue of the war is satisfactory, terms of peace with Turkey w r hicli fall short of extinguishing v the Ottoman empire may still be regarded without trepidation. A Turkey which is excluded from Constantinople and from a foothold in Europe or the Asiatic shore of the Straits, and which in Asia has ceded avenues of approach to its enemies, will not be the power which has posed in the past as the champion of Islam, has kept Christendom at bay, and has ' held the key of the road from Vienna to the East. An Ottoman empire might continue to exist, but its power for evil will be abated, and it will no longer be the rallying point for Moslem dreams of a world-wide ascendancy. A Germany which has been defeated in the present war will not have the same forces as in the past to organise a decadent empire for its own purposes, and will have less promising materials to work with. It might be bettei for the world at large that the 1 urkish empire should perish root and branch and its territories be distributed among the Allies under conditions that would give the indigenous peoples a chance of more prosperous existence. Bat if this is not attainable, or is thought to be attended with more than counter-balancing dangers and disadvantages, a less radical / readjustment of the map of the near East 3ieed not necessarily be a standing menace to the Indian empire and to Christian Powers that have to deal with large masses of Muhammedan subjects. 4. To pass to the Memorandum. Its forecast of what would happen if the war were to be concluded by a peace which left the Turk in possession of Constantinople and his Asiatic provinces would be gladly accepted by Pr0 eSS r? aS in aC ? 0rd Wlth theu ' i ust expectations, and contains no doubt important elements of truth. But the degree of truth would depend on circumstances.- The relative exhaustion of the Allies and the enemy at the,close of the war, the effect of the protracted struggle on the W of S t i ie t State 0f th / lr finances aud «teir internal political condition would an be determining factors. If Germany, contrarv to proSS' were to wm the war, securing thereby the control of the Balkan States' exacting large indemnities, and trampling over a prostrate Eurnnp t'hai' her ambitions would be kindled afresh, the servitude of Turkey would be complete, her Asiatic dominions would become a Gertvan HrmJL i penl of England and her Indian empire eTeVe But 1 ^ Allies should obtain some at least Tthe im^oHSu 'I t fe ped ■^, th ' , States 6 ^ and Servia Md the freedom of* the^alkJu btates from the domination of the Central Pnw^ fl^ if Balkan would be necessary, and capital will be scarce in P expenditure the war the Berlin financiers of the Bagdad Railway hiTfo' — too big for their purses -md waro ;d found the project British capital. Whether with a peaceTaT brhi^nn ^ FTench a ° d evei1 could carry the load unaided may well 'be doubted '!pj; mn ' t ,' es Germany discontent of the Turks would afso hav ' t^^.d.^^^y Jdisheartened by their Armenian losses and have little chance of recovering ground in that region. Even if they retained Constantinople and the bulk of their Asiatic territories, they would be enfeebled relatively to Uussia, and would probably have to accept some form of international control. Loans and subsidies from Germany, on which their present rulers subsist and which keep their armies in the field, would dry up. The treasury would be-bankrupt, the population reduced in numbers and dispirited with losses and little resultant gain. The pro-German party has already many bitter enemies among the Turks, and the Germans themselves are increasingly disliked. These being the circumstances in which Germany and Turkey would find themselves should the ^ar end in favour generally of the Allies, though tlie Turk, as a compromise, be left in Europe, it is difficult to see by what means the remnants of the Ottoman empire would be organised by Germany as a threat against Egypt or India. The military occupation of Bagdad on a great scale might menace British interests in the Persian Gulf and in south west Persia, disturb our relations with the Arab chiefs, and indirectly affect the peace of India. But a permanent occupation of this kind aftei the exhaustion of men, monev and material that will follow the war is most improbable. The ability which the Turk has shown to oppose our armies therewith large and well equipped forces is the result of lavish German support. When that support is withdrawn, as withdrawn it must be under the economic pressure which will beset Germany, the Turk will have neither men nor money to spend on military operations in Mesopotamia, while garrison duty in that region will be as distasteful as ever to Syrian and Anatolian troops. 5. There remains the danger of pan-Islam ism. It is said that so long as the Ottoman Empire continues to exist, it will draw to itself as a focus the secular and religious ambitions of Moslems throughout the world and unite them against the Christian Towers who' have most to do with Islam Germany, it is said, will fan the flame when it suits her, as she will have nothing to lose, while we in India and Africa will be the principal sufferers. The strength and vitality of the pan-Islamic movement is a vexed question, and I touch on it with all reserve. But tihere is reason to conclude, forth from the past history of Muhammedanism and from the events of the present war, that pan-Islamism as a motive force can easily be over-rated. A very noticeable feature of Muhammedanism from the davs of the first caliphs is its want of cohesion and its sectarian divisions and animosities. The fehia schism which has separated Islam into two hostile camps from the time of the Prophet s death is only one, though the best known, instance of the fissiparous tendencies of the creed. Broadly, it mav be said that in the regions where Muhammedanism has been dominant, ~ nationality has been stronger than community of creed, and ethnical differences have caused the existance and determined the tenets of the 150 sects.which Moslem writers enumerate. The Persian has no sympathy with the Turk. The Indian Moslem despises the Arab. The Arab of Arabia or Syria or Tripoli hates the Turk, though to preserve his independence he mav temporarily side with him against an intruding power. In times like the present, when nations and kingdoms are m the crucible of war, and tlie Ottoman empire itself is at stake, it is natural that every Moslem State should be nervous and excited, and that their tremors should be felt in Muhammedan communities dwelling under Christian Powers But it is very remarkable how little evidence there is in the Islamic world to-dav of religious unitv or any sense of common danger in the possible ruuW of Turkev. The Arabs and the Syrians are speculating as to how they may best turn the situation to their own advantage. The Persian 'democrat - is incensed against the foreigner because his national independence and his liberties are threatened, but he continues to hate the lurk Lhe Amir of Afghanistan's thoughts are concentrated on the salvation of his own kingdom and dynasty. Everywhere the Moslem, if at variance more or less pronounced with the Allies, is inspired by nationality rather than by creed In this fact will be found the best preservative against pan-lslamism. A ichad or league of Moslems throughout the world, is almost as great an OT 394 A 2improbability as a modern Crusade. As a literary Idea pan-Tslamism has great attractions for many Mtihammedans. ihey make much of it in speech and writing, and by so doing they create an impression of a ' genuine movement with force behind it. But the moving force has not at yet revealed itself, and the evidence is against its existence. Even if pan-Tslamism should ever be a reality, there is no reason to suppose that the^ anti-European movement inspired by it would stop short at the German, or submit itself to his direction. For the moment he might successfully play the role of protector of Islam. But it would be strange if, on his attempting to direct the movement and asserting himself for this purpose, lie did not find himself in collision with it. Why should Germany be immune from the difficulties which we, with our much larger experience in the art of managing and conciliating Eastern peoples, have met with from the nationalists in Egypt ? For any European Power to fan the flame of pan-Islamism, while itself aiming at the supreme control over a Muhammadan State, would in all probability prove in the long run a dangerous game. (i. These remarks are based on the hypothesis that the war ended with a peace which, while on the whole favourable to the iUlies, fell somewhat /fehort of their expectations and left the lurks in Europe. It is submitted that even in these circumstances the disasters contemplated in the memo randum might not arise and that more allowance should be made for the effect on the Central Powers and on Turkey of an exhausting and disappointing war. The situation, it is frankly admitted, would not be what is desired ; but its dangers need not be exaggerated. 7. If this view is correct, the definite defeat of Germany, bringing with it the collapse of Turkey as a military power, ought to create a situation which should satisfy the reqnirements of British interests in the East, if it is Accompanied by the cession of Constantinople and the Straits, the complete extinction of Turkish rule in Europe, and the exclusion of German and Austrian influeuce from the Balkan Peninsula. These are the essentials. If they are secured, it is, I venture to think, a matter of minor importance whether before submission to the Allies Turkey has been directly defeated by British forces, or whether more or less territory in Asia is left under the nominal rule of the Turk. The view maintained in the Memorandum that ' the collapse of Turkey will not suffice for our purpose 'V unless British prestige lost at Kut is recovered by a direct victory over/ iurkish arms, and that there can be no permanent security against German 1 aggression in the East unless the Ottoman empire in Asia is wholly ^ extinguished, seems to confuse the desirable with the essential. The expulsion of the Turk from Europe, and the transfer of Constantinople and the Straits to strong hands which may be relied on to keep this territory out of reach of the Central Powers, is essential. That and a satisfactory settlement of the conflicting ambitions of the Balkan States are the primary requisites of peace, so far as Indian interests are concerned 1 he disposal of the territories of the Turk m Asia is, as compared with these essentials, a matter of more or less expediency. The Report of the Mesopotamiaii Committee has shown that there are several possible solutions having their respective advantages and drawbacks, and the Allies are already agreed as to^ the solution they prefer in the event of a successful issue of the war. I here is therefore nothing more to be said on this head 8. With,nit trespassing on Ae sphere of the military critic, it mav be rcmaiked, on the subject of the Mesopotamian campaign, that an advance on Bagdad or even the maintenance of our present positions on the Tim-is and Euphrates has no,v to be regarded as a much more serious operation than was originally contemplated. When it was decided to capture and occupy Kut the entire Mesopotamian field force consisted of two inhn/Jv divisions representing a fighting strength of less than 16,000 men with some cavalry and artillery. This force was considered sufficient Si - . on the Tigris and Nasireyeh on the Eunhrates to ,1. ■' Xut mumcation and garrison intermediate places suclf as Querna and ' a COm ' and to protect the oil-fields beyondconfideut that with it he could capture and occupy Bagdad, and that if given one more division he could hold the city against any forces which the Turks could bring against him. The effective fighting strength of the Mesopotamian field force has now been raised by degrees to 43,000 men; vet so far from being able to advance on Bagdad it seems barely sufficient to maintain itself in its present positions on the two rivers. Originally the expedition was lightly equipped, and the local steamer companies, with small additions from India, were expected to provide the needful carriage. Now transport and all other requirements are on treble and quadruple the scale thought adequate a year ago. Six paddle steamers, b tugs, 3 stern-wheelers and 43 barges were then asked for from this country. VV e have by this time supplied or ordered 25 steamers, 4o tugs and o stern- wheelers, and have just been asked for 20 more steamers and 34 more tugs These are in addition to numerous river craft which have been requisitioned in India. Ten hospital ships are urgently wanted. As i write a requisition for 10 more lias come in. The newly appointed head ot the Medical 'Department on arriving in Mesopotamia telegraphs that he is ' already much 14 impressed by the urgent necessity for a large increase in river transport, 'both for purely medical purposes and for carriage of food, building ' materials, tents, and everything required for comfort and health of troops.^ Our Stores Department is receiving heavy demands for all kinds ot stores canvas, water-bottles, ground-sheets, mosquito netting, entrenching tools, ice machines, electrical fans, and other electrical plant--and has difficulty m placing orders with manufacturers for early delivery. Ihe whole character of the expedition is transformed. From a lightly-found expedition such as the Indian Government is accustomed to, it is becoming a heavily equipped one From a small force it has grown into a large one. It is straining its communications to the utmost, and additions to its fighting stre1 '^ ^ intensify the strain, yet it can barely hold its own, and is unequal to the task of moving forward The reason, if a layman may venture an opinion, is that the Turk is operating at an advantage. He is operating on land lines and on interior lines, and for the greater part of the distance from Constantinople to Bagdad he has an excellent railway. We have to ^pend on sea transport and on a thoroughly bad river. He can assemble a force of 50 000 men in Mesopotamia m a shorter space of time and with less difficulty than we can place a force of half the size at Kut and so he ^ found more fully equipped with aeroplanes, big guns, and all the latest appliances of modern warfare than is our own force Judging from these facts a very serious effort would seem to be required, entailing provmwn not only of additional troops, but of additional transport, materiel and supplies of eveiy C if Bagdad is to be taken and held and the Turk decisively beaten on his own ground. This may be worth doing either this year or at a later stage of the war, but it will need doing well. 9 As regards the question of prestige, it would not be human nature, to say nothinc of British nature, not to wish to efface the memoiy of the failure at Kut and prove that our military efficiency is not inferior to that of Turks f mi Wd and directed by the German war staff. If troops can now or hereafter be spared for the purpose, and an advance on Bagdad is on military grounds considered a sound and desirable operation the Indian Government and the Indian Army would be well pleased to have the opportumty of ^ 1I1 ^ 1 eating British valour in the East. The taking of Bagdad would ™*ouUeMj impress the middle East, and would be an appropriate first step to the predominant position which is sought to be acquired for Great ^ ' lower Mesopotamia. But as a it i? as nothing compared w th the expulsion of the Turks from Constantinople and Europe. They haye traded on the prestige which the possession of that city confers and on the iealousies of the Powers wishing to supplant them. Relegated to &lt; provincial capital in Asia Minor they would cease ^ an ^Hac. TH pi V titans would lose the mysterious attributes of divimt} witii wmcti a / v are reeaXd by Moslems where the Surmi tradit.on prevails, liventhe process of natural disintegration by a settlement which shall give fair play to subject races that have long suffered under Ottoman misrule and oppression. But whatever settlement be made the fallen fortunes of the Turkish Government, when it is driven to take refuge in some decayed city of Asia Minor, will no longer afford a fulcrum by which apostles of pan-Islamism or agents of European Powers may hope to move the world.
