Received 21.15 hours, 21st May, 1940. XXX I62_2. Addressed to Secretary of State for India, repeated to Tehran, 61. Reference correspondence ending with Foreign Office telegram 31, February 23rd, to Tehran, Trade mission to Iran, 2. We ha.ve heard nothing further about the proposal to send a Trade Mission to Iran but recent course of events is leading us to conclude that something in the nature of a war trade agreement with Iran is most desirable. Iran is pressing us for large supplies of railway materials, sugar and cement, to say nothing of other miscellaneous requirements, and up to date, we have demanded nothing in return,' although it appears to be open to us to purchase a certain quantity of wool vide correspondence ending with Minister's telegram,'Lay 9th, Ho. 120, and cotton.seed oil, vide Minister's telegram, 121, May 9th. 3. Meanwhile, reports show that Iran is exporting large quantities of raw liiaterial to Germany and according to a recent letter seen in censorship, owing to very strict control o.t foreign exchange, traders in Iran have to pay 200 per cent more than official government rate for the pound sterling. With Germany, however, the Iranian Government has a trade clearing agreement and payment for goods can be made in local currency of Rials at official rate. 4. It seems unreasonable that we should supply goods to Iranian Government without any quid pro quo and especially that we should let thorn have steel for constructing railways, which are more likely to facilitate their trade with Russia and Germany than with us and may he constructed by enemy contractors. We have undertaken to supply railway material to Iran on conditions which have been accepted and we do not wish to insist on any further conditions at present stage, but we earnestly hope that it may be possible to negotiate some kind oi war trade agreement with the Iranian Government which will ensure that our assistance to them will be repaid by some limitation of exports to the enemy. 5* There is further consideration that shipping for railway material entails whole-time charter of ship, which should not return from Persian port in ballast if avoidable.
