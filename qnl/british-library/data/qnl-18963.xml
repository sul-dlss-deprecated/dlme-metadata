By Order of the Most Noble the Governor General of India in Council, C. ALLEN, Officiating Secretary to the Government of India.[ 45 ] PROCLAMATION. I he Court of Ava having refused to make amends for the injuries and insults which British subjects had suffered at the hands of its servants, the Governor General of India in Council resolved to exact reparation by force of arms. i lie Forts and Cities upon the Coast were forthwith attacked and captured ; the Burman forces have been dispersed wherever they have been met; and the Province of Pegu is now in the occupation of British Troops. The just and moderate demands of the Government of India have been rejected b}^ the King; the ample opportunity that has been afforded him for repairing the injury that w T as done has been disregarded ; and the timely submission, which alone could have been effectual to prevent the dismemberment of his Kingdom, is still withheld. herefore, in compensation for the past, and for better security in the future, the Gover nor General in Council has resolved, and hereby Proclaims, that the Province of Pegu is now, and shall be henceforth, a portion of the British Territories in the East. Such Burman Troops as may still remain within the Province shall be driven out ; Civil Government shall immediately be established and Officers shall be appointed to administer the affairs of the several Districts. The Governor General in Council hereby calls on the Inhabitants of Pegu to submit themselves to the authority, and to confide securely in the protection of the British Govern ment ; whose power they have seen to be irresistible, and whose rule is marked by justice and beriencence. Flie Governor General in Council, having exacted the reparation he deems sufficient, lesires no further conquest in Burmah, and is willing to consent that hostilities should ease. But if the King of Ava shall fail to renew his former relations of friendship with the ritish Government; and if he shall recklessly seek to dispute its quiet possession of the Province it has now declared to be its own ; the Governor General in Council will again put forth the power he holds, and will visit with full retribution aggressions which, if thev be persisted in, must of necessity lead to the total subversion of the Burman State, and to the ruin and exile of the King and his race. By order of the Most Noble the Governor General of India in Council, C. ALLEN, Officiating Secretary to the Government of India. 20t/i December 1852. ORDERS BY THE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL.
