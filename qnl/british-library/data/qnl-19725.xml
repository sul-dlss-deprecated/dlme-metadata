About the 5th January an affray took place oetween some of the Mashayakh tribe and two men were killed on each side. On the 6th January All 'bin Sashid A1 Hikman with another of Al Mashayakh kidnapped a Baluchi, who r/cis carrying water from Sana i si eh to sur. The Bani Omar, however, got him rescued. It is stated that the said All bin llashid is the same man, who kidnapped the mdu Ku shan da a lalji of the Firm of Keraji Hamdas in 1925. It is suspected that the Amirs of Bani Bu ALi have a hand in these troubles.

The man had been gathering truffles in t.iie Q.ira al arm district to the North lest of Jahrah and had 'been warned Dy a man of the Tlashaidah that the neighbourhood was not safe, rom what he said it seemed probable that the raid would take place that day or the next morning at the latest* Lieut-Colonel Watson (see para j British Non- ofxicials ia }had 2b 1% Kuwait for ._ ju bail' by car the s^rne morning shor oly oefore the news was received and too late to stop him. After being delayed for some little time on the way owing to radiator trouble and shortly after meeting a car from ^ubair which had come through without incident, his car arrived at Sha'ihAbu Saham, the third large watercourse in the Abatih tract at 1.40 p.m. Here they suddenly came on the raiders in t i ,»jO pax uies: one ox about twenty camels wit|| two men on I to their left, and a much larger party in front of them, 1 which was too far off for them to estimate its strength accurately. The party on their left opened fire on them 'but the driver got the car round, and they escaped with- ! 11 out injury and returned to Kuwait. A regretable incident took place later, the same afternoon, some ten miles further to the north when a party of Americans, consisting of iir. Charles -K. 0.1 ane ^iormerly United States ninister in Pekin), his son and Amex'ican valet, and r. lieiiry Bilkert (of the American fission in iiasrah) who were proceeding to Kuwait in two cars, were fired on hy a party of mount ed raiders, presumably their advanced guard# The two cars wheeled and made for -.ubair as fast as they could, but .1. -ui-lkert was nit and died before reaching , ju - bair. It appears extraordinary how this party venturedalong tne road in view of the warnings which they re ceived, as they were apparently told in iuhair that it was dangerous;,they met a taxi which had Deen sent out to warn the shepherds, as the result of a telegram from tne ohaikh oi Kuwait, on its way hack to JuDair; they even saw shepherds driving their flocks in, and actually heard firing and still went on. I'he raiding party which apparantly consisted of ahoui 150 camel raiders and 40 horsemen of the llutair and Bashaidah tribes^and Iliaidan al-Kithlain and Ihn Jami, are reported to have killed six other people besides ir• &gt;ilkert, and to have got away with over 600 sheep. They bivouacked between Saddah and omm Ruus, to the South 'est of Jahrah, on the evening of the 22nd January, after sending on the plundered sheep, and left at dawn on the 23rd, some hours before the pursuing armoured cars reached there, hoping to reach Ma'raj as- Sauban that night. There are indications that further raids are tc he expected. On the other hand there are indications that considerable illfeeling exists between Ihn lumaid and ion Ruhai'an the two most powerful Shaikhs of the great Ktaibah trihe, wnich if true is all to the good, as it will militate against concerted action on the part of .the trihes against 'Iraq.. The relations between Ibn Baud and the iOchwan leaders are hecomming more and more strained, and his task of preventing them from attacking the 'Iraq, desert posts is bee owning harder from day to day. lie has even found it necessary to issue orders for Juhail, ^atif, etc to he fortified. It seems a pity that the ever present irritant of these Desert posts cannot be or modified. To the Bedouin they are a perpetual challenge to his sense of pride and manhood.Wo. 2 of 1929• oil -114R iOF xHE HEWS .FBOM THE A STATES FOB THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 1929. '0 VST'E NTS .

The next day fox t was attacked by the populace, who succeeded in j rescuing tne wall and setting the building on fire. Abdur itahman and the slave who committed the murder were killed. As Abdur Bahman was blind, and could not therefore nope to succeed his nephew, there is reason to suppose that some third party is responsible for the murder.

Subsequentiy enquiries made by Oaptain G-lubb show that both parties mistook the others for raiders and fired. A report was also received at Kuwait that two camels were stolen from a camp of the Uraibdar at Atraf 8 miles West, South-west of jahrah on the 14/15th March. The owner followed their tracks in the morning right up to where the Iraq, shepherd tribes are encamp ed in the Qara* al Marru. On the 18th larch a taxi patrol of Iraq, tribesmen fought an action with a party of Mutair near Subaihiyah and captured one prisoner and twenty camels. On their return journey they fell in with another strong party to the f@st of Baddah and exchanged shots with them. A report has been received that some Kuwait Arabs of Bashaidah tribe were grazing their camels in the Shaqq on the 17th March, when shuwailih ash Sharif and a party of Iraq tribesmen in two cars came on them and robbed them of thirty camels and three camel foals. This same man Shuwailih ash Sharif, is also reported to have carried off another camel, belonging to one of the Shaikh's cousins, on another occasion - apparantly out of pique, because a camel which he hadtouglit was proved to iiave teen stolen from a Kuwait suDJeot and was oonfisoated Dy the Bhalkh and returned | to its owner. T-wo more camels belonging to Kuwait subjects are reported to have l&gt;een stolen at SulaiMkhat on the 19th March, and to have heen tracked right into the camp of Iraqt tribesmen. un tne 23rd the crews of five hoats from the island of i'ailakah, which had put in to SaMyah to load hushwood for fuel, were rohued of their clothing, . sails, rope and other belongings by a gang of ruffians, oelieved also to be Iraa tribesmen; as also were the crews or two other boats which put in to qadhai, on or Morth-west shore of Kuwait Bay, for the same purpose and on the same day® ' Another Kuwait tribesmen was robbed of his arms and cloak in the ahagiQ.

Bin Jaluwi was reported to he marching to re.inforce Bin Saud hut the latest information showed that 'by the end of March he was still in Hasa, After receiving news that Naif Atm al Kilah had 'been defeat ed 'by ISiaidan bin Hithlain in the vicinity of Jubail, ^ he summoned contingents of the Al Murrah and Manasir from Qatar and Hasa. Muhammad bin Muhaidhif has been sent to UJair to garrison it. According to late news received at Kuwait Bin Baud arrived at Buraidah, and Bin Joluwi was marching North from Hasa, and his advance guard with baggage had arrived at Anta - 200 miles South of Kuwait by the middle of March. The iwazim have receiv ed orders to mobilise and be ready to join him. It is 1 thought that Bin Humaid and Bin Dawish may unite and offer battle to Bin Saud somewhere in the neighbour hood of Jarab while Bin Hithlain and Bin Shuaair, I'uam, and Bin Lami will dispute Bin Jmluwi's advance at the South end of Shaqcj.. The various rumours as to what is actually happening are very conflicting and it is difficult to ascertain the truth. It is believed, however, that Bin Baud and ills reoaloitrant trltes under am h . xsm iiumaid and(10) and Jaisal al Ifewish are still facing each other to the North East of Buraidah, and that attempts are still 'being made to 'bring about a settlement of their ttKiKfcx disputes 'by means of the Islamic Shara, and that no fighting between their forces proper has actually taken place yet. Mohsin al Jfins is said to have captured seventeen herds of camels from members of Bin Humaid 1 s recent raid after they had 'broken up, and fighting 'between the Mutair and the Bubei has also been reported. Bin Lami remain between the South of the Shaqjl and Jarya to protect the rebel ikhwan•s flank against Bin Jaluwi. It is also said that the Awaaim have thrown their lot with Bin Hithalain, but this is improbable. that Bin Bawish for a time posed as mediator between Bin Baud and Bin Humaid, but treacherously joined the latter and suddenly attacked the Kings forces. A big battle was fought at Turfiyah on the 22nd larch. The Akhwan rebels suffered a heavy defeat, Bin Dawish himself being killed.

(a) M unici-pality« The Manamah and Muharraq. launicipal elections have 'been concluded and in both cases a more useful and a hie ccminittee appears to have 'been chosen. In Manamah the Kancc faction slightly outweighs the Qusaihi, and Khalil Kanoo himself was elected 'by a large number of votes. Al though the ballot was secret, pecuniary inducement was un doubtedly held out to voters to vote for particular candi dates. (h) German Engine. A new launch engine made in Germany was im ported by Yusuf IPakhroo, a leading merchant dfi Bahrein. Its make is unknown but heing a 2 stroke, running on crude oil, it was extremely cheap, and seriously alarmed the Messrs Kelvin Agents - /Khalil Kancc.

On the 22nd Ibrahim bin Afraj was definitely located at Hafar al Batin. He 'brought letters from King Bin Saud explaining why he was sent. The Political Agent is of the opinion that the real object of Ibrahim'5 presence is to tighten up the 'blockade against Kuwait. The official reasons given are so much camouflage. 35. KUWAIT. (a) The Shaikh's relations with Bin Saud. -Reference paragraph 7 term 3 of January. On the 17th April the Shaikh of Kuwait formally notified the Political Agent that he desired His Majesty's Government to arrange a treaty with His Majesty King Bin Saud for him on the lines of the Bahra Agreement, with certain additions.

The count- try traversed 'by them has 'been stripped entirely bare of bushes, grass and vegetation. The apathy of the people generally towards the locust menace is a remarkable and regrettable feature. On the 11th April the Political Agent found iv p .*x that the locusts had entered Jahrah settlement and wars doing serious damage. In the last week cf April the locust army had invaded Kuwait town* ^y the 28th April there was an easing off of the pest and relief came as the insects grew their wings and learnt to fly and in this process millions fell into the sea, and got drowned. 34 • BHITISH INTHTRESTS . _T he Ghandi campaign in India^ .

Such procedure would mean suicide pure and simpley and is not to be thought of, not is it possible P! &lt;. TheSn The news cf Ghandi's arrest following on the Shaikh 5 s discourse, has had a profound effect A rather curious local feature is that cer tain memhers of the American Ocmmunity, are inclined go look upon G-handi as a Saint and Martyr, and in after dinner conversation have not hesitated to say so to the Political Agent.

There was some excitmment at Debai in the last week of May when news was received from Bombay that Ab dullah, son of Yusuf bin Abdullah', a respectable pearl merchant of Debai, had been^detained at Bombay by the High Court as certain Hindus had filed a suit against him for claims against his-father. Abdullah had apparently car ried his father's pearls to Hciabay for sale, but fouryi the market dull. Being pressed by the Hindus, however, he sold the pearls at a loss for Rs.150,000 and cut of this paid Rs.80,000 to his father's creditors. When Abdullah was about to return to Debai with the remaining money to pay his Arab CBeditors at Debai and to finance the Pearling operations for the current year, the Hindus filed a suit in the High Court for the unpaid portion of their claims which was about Rs.3l,500i2f- and secured hil arrest and detention. As a reprisal, the Ruler of Debai threatened to arrest all the Hindus in Bobai. Tlio Political Resident asked H.M.S.'laipin' to watch developments, and warned the Shaikh ofl Bebai not to take any action against the British subjects. Eventually, after reference to the G-overnment of India, AbdullSh was released on bail, and returned to Bebai on the 11th July. The next hearing of the case has been fixed by the High Court of HciQbay. for the 20th January 1931, but it is hoped that in the meanwhile thetho parties may come tc an amlcalDle settlement, ^ 5» BAHREIN.

Pearling. Reference paragraph 88 of September. The pearling season drew to a disastrous close. The French and other European 'buyers who frequently 'buy £•1,000,000 worth of pearls in a year in Bahrein have spent only a few thousand pounds this year# The out look is bad and has formed the subject of a special despatch. The only redeeming feature is that the Indian demand for seed pearls has been well maintained, the prices prevailing for this class of pearls are actually somewhat better than last year. The total value of this season's sales in Bahrein is finally estimated at 28 to 30 lakhs of rupees which is less thaWa quarter of last year's sales. I 02 ♦ KING BUT SAUD*S INTERESTS .
