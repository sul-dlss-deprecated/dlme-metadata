Will you plesse refer to your demi-official letter No. 846-3 dated the 17th December 1937 on the subject of the move of the Residency. 2. I have discussed this matter with Belgrave and we both agree with your view that there is no object in se curing options. As you know-the greater part of the Huhar- raq site is privately owned already, but it is perfectly simple to prevent sales to third parties provided I am autho rised to inform His Highness the Shaikh of the site selected. I think it is most important to do this now if only to pre- vent him from thinking that he has been kept, of# the 'secret”. 3. Before however v/e definitely inform His Highness and his Government of the site selected, I venture to urge once more that the question of the site be further considered. It is, I think f agreed that there are only two possible sites, namely, the Muharraq site near Busaitin and the Hssex ^oint site. So far as I can see the only objection to the latter is that it has a south instead of a north west aspect and the buildings cannot conveniently face both the sea and the prevailing breeze. Sven so Croad has stated that buildings might be jwtoj&amp;ad (vide his report of the 24th October 1936). On the other hand, the Busaitin site is reported to b &gt; hotter even than Manaxnah, the sub soil water is only a few inches from the surface, it will be noisy when the Royal Air Force get going on Muharraq, and the approach through part of 1 u- harraq town can only be described as disgusting. As you saw when/- The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.S., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire•when you arrived from England a huge shallow lake forma far behind this site whenever there is a really big tide and I should expect this to cause unbearable humi dity for two or three days on end v/henever it does occur. But the principal objection is of coii ’se that the area is water legged, the sub soil water being, according to a re port by the previous Assistant Jilngineer, only six inches below the surface. I fully admit that the Essex Point site does suffer from its southern aspect, but the sub soil water is said to be five feet below the ground level there and what is equally important^it is reported that the climate is definitely cooler than Tlanamah and the humidity not so high. The mere fact that some of the Euharraq people go and spend the summer round about tftte Essex Point is, I think, ^conclusive proof of its superiority over the Bu- saitin site. 4. Personally I think that Croad has .greatly under estimated the discomfort of damp ground floors and I ima gine, from the reports on record, that Busaitin would be as damp as the Agency house whereas the Essex Point would be far more like Jufair. The difference between Jufair and the Agency when the latter is suffering from a really damp day has to be experienced to be believed.

Mr. Secretary Eden is well aware of tne financial difficulties which nave complicated tne execution of this most necessary political measure. These nave in fact formed the subject of separate correspondence, and notably of Sir Robert Vans ittart’s letter of the 26th July last to bir Findlater Stewart. But in Mr.Eden’s opinion the political importance of this transfer is such that it would be most unfortunate, from the point of view of major imperial interests, if it were delayed for purely financial reasons. The political issues involved are on a scale and of an importance out ol all comparison with tne expenditure which the move would entail, more especially when it is remembered that, once une Residency has been effectively established at Banrain, very considerable / The Under-Secretary of State India Officeconsiderable economies over such matters as journeys, telegrams, recess, etc., are likely to be effected. 3. Meanwhile, the importance of establishing on the Arab coast the headquarters of the chief British political authority in the Persian Oulf is steadily increasing. As Lord Zetland is aware, the position and prestige of His Majesty’s Government in the Arabian countries and in the Arabian Peninsula are seriously threatened as a result of recent developments in Palestine. Certain European countries, notably Italy and Germany, are making a determined effort to establish their influence in Arabia at the expense of the position and interests of His Majesty’s Government. Much may depend on the attitude of King Ibn Baud of Saudi Arabia during the next few years and on the course of his relations with His Majesty’s Government not least on his eastern frontier, and in so far as those relations are likely to affect the position of the Arab principalities of tne Persian Gulf which are in special treaty relations with this country. The rapid development of oil at Bahrain, and the grant of a series of oil concessions along the whole length of tne Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, constitute a further reason for strengthen ing British representation on that coast of the Gulf without further delay. Moreover it is easy to visualise eventualities- auch as the death or disappearance of Ibn Baud-., wnere it would become a matter of great importance tiiat His Majesty's Government should be strongly and permanently represented in this area, and that the chief British political authority concerned should not be resident at a distance from the scene of action and in a foreign country. 4. //y 3 4. Apart from this, Mr •Eden views with the greatest mis giving any unnecessary continuance of the present anomalous and somewhat humiliating position in which the political Resident, whose interests and responsibilities are almost entirely concerned with the Arabian coast of the (iulf, continues to reside under the somewhat thin disguise of a Consul-General on the soil of a foreign country where his presence is notoriously embarrassing and unwelcane. Although Mr .Eden does not wish to attach undue importance to Persian susceptibilities, the tact that the Persian Government so strongly resent the continued presence of the Residency as such on Persian soil does, in nis view, and considerably to the difficulty of establishing Anglo- Persian relations on a satisfactory basis, and exposes His Majesty’s Government to a constant risk of oeing obliged, as the result of Persian action, to carry out an enforced and humiliating evacuation. 5. There are the strongest political reasons, from tne point of view of British relations both with .Arabia and with Persia, in carrying out this move with the least ore to express Mr. Eden's earnest hope that .1 be willing strongly topress the Govern- &gt; do whatever may be possible to expedite le comparatively secondary points of •e still outstanding, in order tnat tne cements may be made to proceed with tne » transfer at a very early date.

It is true that Oread with my assistance and that of Loch selected ^usaitin in preference to Tea ex X 5 oint, but it must be remembered that Oread's visit took place in the ccGLd weather and there is considerable difference, more probably in Bahrain than almost anywhere else, between the winter and summer climates. It ia of course from the not weather point of view mainly that the question of the site hac/to fee consider,'4, 3# /eighfcman makes the following points (a) that the hot weather conditions at ^isex Point are definitely cooler than taose at Buaaitin, and the humidity not 30 high; that many people from Muharraq island (on which the Buaaitin site is situated) go to He sex Point for the summer, (b) that the sub soil water at Busaitin is only a few inches from the surface, while at ;*eex Point it is said to fee about five feet, (c) It is true that the chief objection to Sssex Point la that it has a South aspect i.e. away from tne prevailing $©rth / Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, KOIH.,C3I.,MVO. # Secretary to the aovernment of Inaia, Jxternal Affairo department, Hew Jelhi.Worth .find, hut, as /eightmn points out, Croad in hi a report of 24th October 1936 says that buildings at 'S&amp;ssac Point might be adapted to overcome this disadvantage, (d) in November last a large shallow la^e formed not far behind the Ousaitin site, and this vould, whenever it occurr ed, increase the humidity at 3uaait in, (e) with regard to the discomfort of damp floors, Weight- man says: * t imagine, from the reports on record, that Busaitin would be sis damp as the Agency house whereas the 3es#x Point would be far more like Jufair. the difference between Jufair and the Agency when the latter is suffering from a really damp day has to be experienced to be believed** 4 Jufair is the site of the Haval Bass, (f} the noise cause! by lloyal Air fore® planes when the pqyal Air vorce base is established, the site of which will fee near Busaitin. 4, You will see that some at least of the above points were of a nature that should have been apparent to myself act ing in the capacity of a sort of local adviser to Iroad, whom I accompanied on his inspection of the various sites, and I am afraid that some of the responsibility for plumping for the Busaitin site mist lie on me. &amp;t the same time, considering the sum of money involved in the construction of the Uesldenoy^ and the fact that once constructed it will remain in per pet uo , it would fee a gre&amp;ty pity to fix finally on a site about whose suitability any doubt whatever exists. 5. I suggest therefore that in view of the points raised in my paragraph 2 above, the question of siting the Residency at 3asex Point should fee reconsidered, and that Oread might pay a /0 \l a aaconci visit to Bahrain to rs-exaiains both sites. I presume that in any ease he or acme other senior IV'V:&gt;. Officer would have to visit Bahrain in order to fix on the exact location of the Residency and its attendant buildings in wn&amp;vever »*te is finally selected. 6 . With regard to the question of acquiring a site* here again lose* Point has certain advantages aa Weightaan reports that most of it belongs to the Bahrain Oovsnuttent and only a comparatively small part to private owners unlike Susaitin where the reverse is the case. This will mean that if Is3ex Point is finally decided upon, it can be acquired certainly quicker, and possibly cheaper than Buaaitin . ?. The further consideration of the site question will not of course mean that the work which has already been done by the in estimating the cost of* and drawing up the plana for, the Residency on the Busuitin site will fee wasted. If the Bes ideney is finally constructed at ISssex Point both the cost and the building plans will oe approximately the same. S*or will this consideration waste any appreciable time in getting the new Residency started since there are various preliminaries to be settled before construct!on can actually bo begun. 8 . Paragraph 2 of the Department of labour letter quoted above indicates certain steps which should now be taxen in connection with the scheme. All plans and estimates* however* have been prepared by the Central public Works Department arid all future work will, 1 assume* be carried out and aupervieed by them: I presume that for this purpose a special oificer from India will be deputed by the Central Public orks Department to supervise the work at Bahrain.

Yours sincerely, Sd. G.P. Gibson. Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, KCSIE., CSI., MVX)., External Affairs Department, new Delhi•Commexita by Mr* ““endel on the plana for the Residency* The first question which occurs to me is whether it is really a good plan to build the new Residency in one long line, instead of building it round a courtyard* i realize that the object of this is to give the rooms the maximum amount of through draught and to enable the majority of them to face north, but I should have thought that it would still have been possible to arrange for a a through draft even if the rooms were built round a courtyard, and that there would be no reason why they should not still have external as well as internal verandahs* xhe present scheme seems to me to be open to the drawback that the building will always be - like the new Agency at Kuwait ■ mainly a facade, while 1 should have thought that the great number of different exits and entrances to the ’•ofiices'* as shown on the plan at present proposed would have much increased the difficulty of ensuring the secrecy and safe custody of archives, i should have thought that a building rdmnd a colonnaded courtyard would have been much more in keeping with the local architectural I traditions, which seem to me well worth while following where one can. The next point that occurs to me is the comparative inadequacy of the main staircase. i'his is a point which struck me a good deal in some of the Government of India buildings which x saw in the ^ulf, and which is a particular drawback to the present Political agency in bahrain. it must be remembered that, when important visitors or local rulers arrive, they are always met at the foot of, and generally escorted up, the staircase, xhe first entry into the building up the main staircase often becomes important. But if the staircase is rather tucked away intoinm -2 aM into a corner, and then ia a norrow and more or less spiral affair, leading up to the beduooms as well, as in the present plan (and is at Kuv/ait), it seems to me that it v/ill be very difficult to arrange for the kind of dignified reception of distinguished visitors which ia so often needed* I should have thought that it would have toeen very much better to have had a big branching staircase quite close to the front entrance and leading straight up to the main reception rooms, and a separate staircase for the bedrooms and offices, of a rather more important type than the small back staircases suggested at the cornees of the present plan* I see futther that the present plan is designed on the orthodox Indian lines, having a lot of little back staircases and verandahs behind all the bedrooms for the *sweepers H to come in and out. if, as I hope, it is passible to arrange for some form of sanitation, perhaps this - to ordinary European ideas - extremely awkward arrangement could be avoided* Without the elevation it is of course very difficult to express any opinion on the artistic merits of the new design* ^ut 1 still think - as 1 said in my original report on my tour - that a great many local features could be incorporated easily and successfully in any design.No* C/321-1*a/33* Political Agency, Bahrain, the 19th May 1938 From To H.

I discussed the matter with Belgrave before he went on leave and he seemed to think that the Doctor in charge of the nahar- raq Dispensary might do this Job.

This of course includes not only the Residency itself but accommoda tion for all the staff, officers, clerks and menials. 2. Air conditioning has not been provided for, and this I consider essential, My idea is to suggest to Government that instead of building Indian bungalows for the staff they ♦ should build houses precisely on Bapco lines, all air condition ed. The Bapco houses are of course built inland, where the climate is dry, and the Residency Staff House will be on the coast, where it is damp, but I presume that the same type of houses are suitable in that locality also ? 3. The Residency being a very large building, as far as air conditioning is concerned is a problem in itself. 4. Could you please get from the Company and let me have full details, plans and cost of (a) their houses which would be suitable for the staff, and (b) anv suggestions which they have to make as to the air conditioning of the Residency.

I have been in touch with the Oil Company and they inform me that they are just finishing plans for a new batch of housss which they are g oing to put up, and that they hope that these plans will eliminate the disadvantages of the air-cooled houses which they have already* They have promised to let me have plans and coat of material, but they cannot work out actual cost of labour owing to their rather weird system of ’Costing”• However we can probably make a good guess at it* The man who is actually in charge of this work is on local leave at present but will be back about the 21st of this month, and I am leaving instructions that Hallows (since I shall be away myself) should go and see this man, Andreson, and get all the Mope’ 1 * 3. In regard to air-conditioning, the Company have got a real expert working in Arabia at the moment but he is due to come across here in a day or two, and again Hallows will get in touch with him. There are one or two points about this air- conditioning which I should like to have cleared up. I take it that you do not wish to condition the whole of the Residency building, as this would be extremely expensive. Indeed the Company themselves, when working out plans for a big Resident Manager*s house, decided to condition only part of it owing to the cost. I would suggest, then, that none of the rooms on the ground floor be conditioned and only two office rooms and two living rooms on the first floor and perhaps two bedrooms on the /- The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenehard Fowle, K.C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushlre*c 2 the second floor. Summer visitors are not frequent and do not stay long, so it scarcely seems necessary to provide for them. Could 3rou let me know by return if you agree, since this affects the advice we shall get? 4. You have said that I may make comments of my own, and I wonder if I am in order in suggesting that once the Hesidency comes to Bahrain the Hesidency Surgeon and the Assistant Hesi dency Surgeon can be eliminated from the staff. Neither of them will be need®! for the purposes of the Hesidency itself since I am pretty sure we shall always have a State European doctor, and so long as oil lasts here and in Arabia, there will certainly be a first-class medical staff at the Oil Camp. So far as the Hesidency Surgeon's supervision and inspection of Agency dispen saries, etc., are concerned, I suggest that this is not a very serious matter since Rooney has only been to Bahrain once since I have been Political Agent here 1 I am not quite sure if accommodation is actually to be built for the Personal Assistant, but if so c ould this not be cut out also ? The Resident does not seem to get a Personal Assistant very often and if he has a whole-time Under Secretary that officer could take on the Personal Assistant's work, or alternatively the Rajputana-Central India system might be adopted, i.e. some female relation does the job. Finally could not the Assistant Engineer be cut out ? I believe Mr. Murtaza himself thinks so and I feel sure that we can manage perfectly well with periodic inspections from India. 5* XI these suggestions or some of them were adopted there would be a considerable saving in the cost of building.

He?» FA-540» MB. H. 2* HaLLOWIS, POLITICAL AOimOT, BAHREIN. Re: your letter of June eetlsiat©® for air conditioning and contemplated work for a new Residency. The information you have given is very meager and will in no way permit me to make any estimate which I would say Is within accurate limits. The questions asked from the information given are like asking what is the cost of a boat. There are all types although slues may be the same. Cost differences can be as great as •ottparlng a battleship with a freighter. For an estimate to be fairly accurate I would require (1) Wall construction (%) Floor oonstruction (3) Roof construction (4) Doors - number and kind (5) Windows - number and kind {&amp;) Porches - verandahs etc. (7) Location of rooms (8) Number of people occupying rooms* I have made some very broad assumptions in order to give you a very rough conception of wfcuat may be required. I* Cost of Air Conditioning 6 rooms of the Agency Assumptions show that this load would be about 2D - 30 H.P. of Refrigeration Mechanical equipment i.e., compressor, condenser, evaporator, cooling tower, piping and pumps and all other mechanical equipment plus ducts In building should cost about * f 9,000.00 24, 1939, concerning housing costs forAbove doe® not include any building to house the equipment, nor does it include utilities to the plant * such as water, electricity, transformers etc,, - these no doubt can be given you in detail by your State Engineer - Mr. Steele. Such a plant could not well be extended unless additional capacity over present requirements were first built Into it* It should be remembered however that additional capacity can be built into the plant more cheaply Initially than later which may require much altering or a complete new small unit as a supplement. Without knowing what is proposed for the future X cannot answer the question of whether the installed plant will handle additional rooms* If you desire capacity later the best plan is to install an over-aize unit now - provided the later added load to the unit will be only a nominal increase* If the proposed added load is to be great then X would suggest a plant so designed to take the present known proposed load that can be added to in increments without high additional coats for alterations. HOT! : Above cost estimate covers only the Residency - Separate houses will b© covered below - Total air-conditioning costs will be the sum of the two. XX* - HOUSING . Cost at Awali of a 2 Bed Room Unit Duplex House (for two families) # 18,000.00* Cost of Air Cooling 1*100*00 Total $ 13,100.00 *does not include furniture, stove etc., but includes hot water heater and all fixtures. A plan drawing of this type of dwelling ha5 already been sent you. You orally expressed the belief that the Secretary and Residency Surgeon should have a 3 bed room - 8 bath room dwelling. I have indicated on the attached print very crudely how an additional bed room and bath room plus added area of living and dining rooms could be incorporated Into the existing plan, on the basis of our costs such a duplex house would cost about # 16,000.00 (for Z families, 1 Unit) Air cooling for such a house about - 1,400.00 | 17,400.00- 3 - (gi ii/ Again these eoste do not include utilities thet have to he brought to the dwelling such as water (drinklag and general usage) telephone, electricity and sewers. You should be able to reduce these figures about | 1,500.00 each because of prorated charges which go Into Company works. I should think for these larger houses individual dwellings would be more suitable and the cost would be approximately the same* The utilities of course would b© more expensive. Possibly a 2-story dwelliar would be the least expensive which would shorten utility service connections, permit usage of a single roof and single foundations and reduce air cooling costs. XXI* MAIKTl%A?fOF: OF MR QOOL1KO UNITS. This is hard to evaluate because of all the un knowns but the greatest maintenance would probably be cleaning the condensers. Minor repairs from time to time will no doubt be necessary. About $350 - #400 per year should cover. Possibly your operator could handle all repair work when he becomes familiar with the plant. I hope that the above answers the question© asked in your letter. no accuracy is claimed for the estimate; they are * rough approximations” only. Sincerely yours, OF??G!NAL SIGNED BY ec: MEL. R - A.

As far as I knew? the Admiralty will only be willing to let us have the Naval Base at Jufatr on lease and will probably insist on our undertaking to evacuate it at short notice should any serious emergency calling for Naval action arise In the Gulf* It is therefore essential to take up the question of building a Residency at Bahrain at once, 2. v.hile I have been in Bahrain I have visited most of the sites previously suggested and have also inspected other sites* I consider the following four sites as possibilities s~ Cl) Budaiya* (ii) In the vicinity of Esaex Point* (111) In the vicinity of Jufalr village* (lv) Immediately north of the house at present occupied by the Assistant Political Agent 3* From a purely personal point of view I should prefer Budaiya to any of the other sites. It is open and healthy and there is plenty of room to build* It has hitherto not been seriously considered as being too remote but it is only 11 miles from Manama which is not so very much more than the 7 miles which separate Sabsebad from bushire. It is I think desirable that the ^Political Resident should keep himself ■■ reasonably aloof from the main centres of population at Bahrain otherwise he will be liable to interfere with the work of the Political Agent, On the other hand its distance from the basa&amp;r* clubs etc. at Manama will fee an inconvenience to the staff. 4* The Essex Point site lias been strongly criticised by Prior vide his letter **o, C/407 dated the 12th September 9 !*elghtman f Esquire* C*S*I* 9 C*X*&amp;* 9 I*C*i.

It would I think be possible to find a site near Jufalr village which would front on the sea and catch the pre vailing winds* It would however be necessary to clear away a large number of palms and barrastls and even then it would be closely surrounded by habitations. 6 . If Budalya Is considered too remote the best site is probably that adjoining the Assistant Political Agent 1 * house. &amp;ost of the land here belongs to the Royal Air Force; they are not using It and wo Id probably be ready to part with It. The main objection to this site Is that It is practically inside Panama. 7* I would emphasise the f&amp;ct that it will be necessary not only to build the Residency and its offices but accommodation for the entire Residency staff. Arrangements should be made for air-conditioning from a central plant and In this case only comparatively small and low rooms would be required except say for two reception rooms in the Residency. 8 . There will presumably be considerable discussion between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India about the incidence of cost but I trust that action will not be delayedCONFIDENTIAL I MO II'' &lt;3 No. 70 - S.

' i t i « i i i BAHRAIN RECEIPT. j Date — (J.:. !...(&amp; , l tON fflS MAJESTY’S SERVICE5o' - aP.A Last evening the Observer informed me that Dr. Bandarkha had told him that it was not possible for him to take the morning temperature and humidity readings (which are to be recorded at 4 GMT: 7.22 a.m. local time), as he was frequently out at that hour attending to calls. He suggested, however, that the instruments be removed to the Muharraq Municipality building but did not say who should take the readings there. On Friday, when Observer and I took the instruments to him, he did not express any inconvenience, nor apparently had he had instructions from ^cting Adviser since he asked me why I had brought the instruments to him. I replied that I presumed that Mr. de Grenier had sent him advance information. He did not say anything more and left almost immediately for Mahama. Zj ^ A c&lt;I saw Andresen today, and he has promised rough estimates of (1) air-conditioning the Residency and the duplex houses of the Residents Staff, and (2) the cost of erecting these duplex houses. Regarding (1), it was impossible to provide material for an accurate estimate. There being no plans, such details as the number and type of windows, the thickness of the walls, the material used for construction, the lay out of the rooms, etc, etc, could not be furnished, and all these apparently greatly affect the working of the air conditioning plant. Bd*ore discussing , Andreson asked to have all the details we could supply. The information I gave him is contained in the statement at pages 122 and 123 of the file. The rooms taken for air conditioning are those suggested by P.A. in his D.O. at page 119, and the dimensions of the rooms are those of the Lahore Residency. A further essential for an accurate estimate is a plahtof the proposed lay-out of the Residency and Staff houses on the site. The cost of air conditioning depends greatly on the distance the cooled air has to travel, and if it is proposed that the Staff houses shou-uld be some distance from the Residency and given large compounds, the cost will be greatly increased. Andre sons estimate the., efore as far as air conditioning is concerned will only rough. As regards (2), Andreson is working on the provision of one complete duplex for the Secretary and Residency Surgeon, and half a duplex for the others mentioned under ' Officers ' in the list of the Residents Staff at page 110. A complete duplex is designed for two living and two bedrooms only but a t a small extra cost could be redesigned and built with three bedrooms and two living-rooms. Plans of a duplex with pencil\6T suggestions for this change are being sent down today. Half a duplex for the rest of the staff included under ' Officers ' may be on the small side. They would have one bedroom and two living rooms or two bedrooms and one living room. Andreson is therefore sending down plans of the camp A. G.'cottages ' which are a little bigger than half a duplex Andreson pointed out that the cost of specially designing and building a house for the requirements of Officers would not be much greater that that of constructing’ a duplex provided it had roughly the same plan area. As duplex houses wall hardly be in keeping with an imposing Residency a special design will probably eventually prove necessary. The plans have just been receivedsnd are placed below. The pencil suggestions for buildihg a duplex with three bed-rooms and two living rooms have not arrived, and will presumably come with the stimates. nr ^ l- j SU ggest that Andreson should ©me and discuss 7 u/fr //a c , \-£? h*- vaO*- 0 11 (X / IvA. *% / kv/h. rv/ rv. r — /-y the plans and estimates with the P.R. &lt;U i l P /? lr Q L iu. ^ cLto A 1 *^rjrvw£- &lt;1 /’A ?'
