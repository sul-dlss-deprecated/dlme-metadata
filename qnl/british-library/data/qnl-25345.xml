Sir: - / t Is ■ n ^ «nes* Hi i. ib^i In reply to your letter No.P.8970 of the 3rd. ultimo, regarding the cost of the replacement of the Bushire-Shiraz telegraph line, I am directed by Earl Curzon of Kedleston to state that His Lordship agrees with Mr.Secretary Montagu that the acceptance by the Persian Government of financial responsibility for reconstruction of part of the Arabistan telegraph lines does not form a satisfactory basis for the presentation of a claim in regard to the Bushire-Shiraz line. 2. Lord Curzon is prepared to telegraph accordingly to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran on the understanding that such a step will not involve the claim from your Department of a moiety of the expenditure involved for payment out of Imperial Revenues.

I do not understand on what basis it can be assumed that Persian G-overnment ’ s acceptance of financial responsio ility for reconstruction of part of Arabistan telegraph lines be tween Bandar Rig and Ahmadi includes liability for main line from Bushire to Sheraz status of which is laid down in convention of December 2nd 1872 under which Persian Government is liable for all acts of wilful damage. This line was wilfully damaged but I anticipate (? that) (? they will) (group undecypherable) disclaim liability on a plea of force majeure (See Sir Percy Cox’s despatch Do. 172 of October 26th. 1919).
