Please enquire confidentially from the Company’s representatives whether the Company has considered obtaining a con cession in Kuwait in association with the Kuwait Oil Company. If this has been considered and rejected you should endeavour to ascertain the reasons for this decision• 3. Pending further instructions, which will follow receipt of your reply regarding Kuwait mentioned in para graph 2 above,the fact that there is no objection to the opening of negotiations in Bahrain should not be communi cated to the Company’s representatives. 4.

Their plant in United Kingdom is the only one of its kind outside United States of America and erection of plant in Sterling Area country would lead to great saving of dollars. 2. Prima facie association with partly British Oil Company seems preferable and we should probably wish to conclude political agreement with Company on usual lines if concessions were granted. 3. Further particulars will follow but meanwhile no objection to opening negotiations. = Retaxandum *(/ lit*' Telegram Q,.

Mr. Wheeler of tne Associated Ethyl Company, accompanied by Mr. Cessford- of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, called on me this morning. They informed me that they were leaving by air today en route for Kuwait to explore' the possibilities of finding a suitable site for their plant there. They told me that although it was of advantage to locate an ethyl plant in the neighbourhood of a refinery it was quite practicable, with certain modifications, to operate from the natural gases of an oil field. 3. From his general attitude, Mr. Wheeler gave me the impression that he anticipated difficulties over labour if his plant were located in Bahrain particularly In view of the large construction programme contemplated in the near future by the Bahrain petroleum Company. 4. Mr. Wheeler informed me that the Arabian American Oil Company had told him that they would welcome the location of the ethyl plant in their area. He added that from the technical point of view, a suitable site could be found there, but that political and labour difficulties in S^udi Arabia were likely to be considerable. I then took the opportunity of saying that his Company would probably encounter considerable difficulties of this sort in either Saudi Arabia or Iran and that they would be likely to find things far easier in Kuwait or Bahrain. Mr. Cessford .volunteered the statement that chough he had not seen Kuwait he thought it likely that they would find Kuwait the most suitable place to locate their plant. ^ 5. I gave no written answers to the points raised in the questionnaire which forms the enclosure to the letter sent to you under my printed Letter No. c/352, dated the 31st July, 1947. I answered the queries listed under the heading of Local Regulations verbally, and informed them that although I could not give detailed answers to the queries listed under the heading of concessions, should the Company later be authorised to negotiate a concession either here or in Kuwait they would be given every assistance possible by the political authorities concerned.
