Stannus gives a number of reasons for the difference between the estimated charges and the actual costs, including the speculation that materials such as glass for the windows, locks, hinges and other items were not taken into consideration when the expenses were calculated. Stannus requests an additional sum of 2500 rupees, of which he states a significant amount has already been expended.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054395.0x00005e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
