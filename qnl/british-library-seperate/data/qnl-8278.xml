The regulation gave the Political Agent in Kuwait the power to appoint special police officers to deal with incidents involving those subject to the jurisdiction of the Order in Council. It was largely a response to an influx of American labour employed by the oil companies.The correspondence is between officials at the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, Commonwealth Relations Office, and Foreign Office.
