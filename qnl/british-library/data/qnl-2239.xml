The Stationery Department has for a number of yeare experienced very considerable difficulties at the close of the financial year 'by the non-observance 'by Officers and Departments of Rule No.7 of the 'Rules for the Supply and Use of Stationery Stores' , which is reproduced 'below for ready reference 7. Closing of Stores.- The Central Stationery Office is closed annually from the 3l s t March to ijth April for stocktaking. Indents received after the end of February will not be complied with until the stores are reopened, unless of an urgent or exceptional nature; in this case they will be complied with, so far as practicable, provided that they are received by the 10th March . • The position ^tas become so acute that it has become necessary to apply the ^fVle strictly in order to avoid a block in the system of supplies. ^^6 indents were received between the 1st and 10th March 1927 marked urgent by Departments. Urgent and exceptional indents received in the Stationery Office by the ICth March will be complied with only if countersigned by the head 01 the Department, or in the case of the Secretariat by a Deputy Secretary. A very usual and repeated excuse for sending indents for compliance after the last day of February is 'that the allotment will expire if the demand is not complied with before the 31 Ivlarch'. This is not considered a sufficient excuse for breaking the Rule. The issue of this Circular has not, in the past, had the desired effect. The Stationery Office will reserve the right to return any* indents it considers should have been received prior to tr.- end of February. C. F.
