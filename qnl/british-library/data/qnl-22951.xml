I.'avipg received no further communication on this subject I had assumed, in view of present conditions, that this visit woula not now take place. To my considerable astonishment I was informed this morning by the local Station superintendent of Imperial Airways that Signor Venturini had arrived in Bahrain by Imperial Always flying boat. Later in the morning I received a telegram from the British Consul in Basra, which had apparently been despatched yesterday but was not marked immediate, informing me that Signor Venturini was arriving to-day. I have examined ^gnor Venturini's travel paper and find that the British s. e. MFP—400S&amp;P—(M-480)—26 ■7-34—2,00,000. Consulate /--2 Conaulata in Baghdad have granted him a visa on the 18th Sep tember 1939 on the strength of the Residency telegram quoted above. I should have thought that it would have been wiser to have ascertained from the Gulf whether the visit was still permissible in view of the changed conditions arising from the outbreak of war$ I should also have expected to receive tele graphic intimation directly this visa was granted in Baghdad. 3. Signor Venturini haaL called upon me this morning and made it apparent that the object of his visit was to discover locally whether there would be any difficulty about arranging = for the ’’Alla Littoria' to operate a service from Basra to India via the Arab Coast. I informed him that it was beyond my functions to say whether such a service would be permitted or not| and having ascertained that the 'Al^La Littoria' machines could not fly direct from Bahrain to the borders of India I informed him that I thought there would be great difficulty indeed about arranging an intermediate alighting area. I told him that owing to hydrographic and meteorological conditions landings in open anchorages along the Coast would be impossible and the only suitable creek for flying boats fell in an Arab Sheikhdom which was subject to frequent disturbance. Signor Venturini evidently anticipated a reply of this nature and proceeded to press for my support to the M A3Xa Littoria' operating as far as Bahrain. Here also I said that there would be difficulties owing to the attitude of Arab Shaikhs and that it would be necessary for his Company to make an approach through diplomatic channels. He informed me that his Company would in fact be making an approach through the British Embassy in Rome and requested that the Embassy be informed of his con versation with me. 4.

C/492 of 27th Septero- ber 1939, to the Secretary of State for India about the visit of Signor Venturini to Bahrain, it is regretted that the ^oliticd ^gent at Bahrain did not receive prior warning of the arrival of Signor venturinl in Bahrain. As the Political agent will now be aware, the Acting Consul informed him in an air mail letter No. 26/7/8 of the 18 th September, that he had that day granted a visa to Signor Venturini. it was understood that signor venturini intended to spend two or three days in Basra, and he seems in fact to have done so. ihe Acting -onem therefore saw no special reason to telegraph to the Political Agent. It is evident that the letter did not catch the aeroplane it was intended to catch, owing possibly to delay in the censor’s office, despite the obviously character of the communication. as regards the general question of granting visas in war-time which the Political Agent, Bahrain, raises in paragraph 2 of his express letter to the Political Resi dent, it should be noted that, except in the case 'of visas for the United Kingdom, no fresh instructions modifying the existing regulations have been received as a result of the out break of war. This, and the fact that Signor Venturini, although he only applied for the visa in person on September 18th, had been informed of the terms of your approval of his application immediately upon receipt of your telegram Ho. of august 23rd, would have made the withdrawal of his facilities very difficult, except on some very solid ground advanced by you; and we note that you did not think fit to Ueney, er 8ian Gulf. gJSHIR E. take the/V tbfc initiative in thie direction. we would mention too that we had had inetructione to be very careful to avoid any provocation to Italy and to eee that the Iraqie conformed with our attitude. in the absence of fresh instructions regarding visas for other parts of the Empire and territo ries under British control, and having regard to the fact that the applicant was not an enemy alien and that, as indicated in paragraph 4 of the Political resident’s tele gram Ho. T.182 of August 23rd, he was to be kept under observation during hie stay in Bahrain, it was not considered the absence of any initiative from you, that,/the approval of the issue of a visa of strictly limited validity to Signor Venturini needed reconsideration in the event of war. . I* C y i In connection with paragraph 3 of the Political Hesident’s letter, the acting Consul was assured categorically by Messrs. Dwyer and Company, who are the local agents for the Ala Littoria Company, and are a firm under British management usually considered reliable, that Signor Venturini was only visiting Bahrain in order to appoint a booking agent there, and that/there was no question at ..regent of extending the service beyond Basra. Never theless, we are not surprised to hear that his Company are thinxing of exploiting to their own advantage the situation in which the war has placed Imperial Airways. The acting Consul applied to Messrs. Dwyer rather than to Signor Vent urini direct because shortly after making his original application for a visa. Signor Venturini left for Haifa and remained there for several days, no doubt in order to ascertain what the attitude of his country would be as a result of the outbreak of hostilities. We are very sorry to have caused you so much trouble and quite appreciate your anxiety not to have aliens arriving in your midst without due warning.A copy of this letter is being Foreign Office.

The K.L.M. has regularly flown planes across Iranian territory for a number of years now, linking Iran by air with the East and the West, without any complaints being made by the Iranian authorities either as regards these flights or the landings and it is only on account of the war that changes have had to be made in these regular services. in the Note Verbale of the 14th July, the Legation explained the reasons for the unexpected changes which have had to be made in the K.L.M.route. Since last autumn, the state of war prevailing'in several European countries has forced the KIM to change their roUte, and instead of Amsterdam as hitherto, it was necessary to fix Naples as the starting point for the planes, it was, accordingly, with Naples as the starting point that the regular service between Europe and Batavia has been operating from October 1939 to June 1940 and the Iranian Government have not so far considered it necessary to raise any objection to the change to Naples as the starting point? on the contrary, every month in reply to the application submitted by the Royal Netherlands Legation in which Naples was mentioned, that Government have regularly granted the permission solicited by the K.L.M. it seems obvibus that when ±taly entered the war, that Naples had to be abandoned as a landing place. it also goes without.saying that when in October 1939, the K.L.M.had to abandon the use of Amsterdam as the starting point, it was absolutely impossible to use any aerodrome in Holland since the Netherlands territory in Europe had been occupied by the enemy. lour Excellency will, therefore, realise how surprised 1 was when 1 learned from the Note Verbale of the 12th August, No.3382, that the Iranian Government without taking into consideration the arguments and explanations contained in this Legation’s Note Verbale of the 14th July, intimated they refused permission to fly across Iranian territory, because they were unable to agree to any change in the starting place, a change which, 1 repeat, they had accepted eight months ago in respect of Naples and they refuse now to accept in respect of Lydda. As directed by my Government, to whom i communicated the refusal of the Imperial Government of Iran, 1 have the honour to draw Your Excellency's attention to the above and earnestly to request you to be so kind as to reconsider the application presented in the Note Verbale of the 20th July, No.747, and to grant the K.L.M. permission to fly across Iranian territory stopping at Jask as hitherto.

Political Agent, BAHREIN Dear Sir LANDING OP K.L*M. AIRCRAFT AT SHARJAH 9TH MAB6H 1941 ojp-fJL Referring to the incident when the Royal Dutch aircraft PH.ALT landed at Sharjah, Captain Hulaehros, the commander, has made the following statement. / that the aerodrome at Jiwani was unserTiceahle owing to heavy rain. Captain HulseLros therefore delayed his departure while he took on extra petrol which would enable him to fly to Bahrein direct. However, the aircraft ran into head winds of 60 to 70 kilometres per hour and her speed was therefore considerably reduced, so that, when two hours out of Bahrein they found themselves with a bare two hours of petrol left and therefore signalled for permission to land at Sharjah. Cur representative in Sharjah immediately signalled to you for permission to refuel the aircraft, and the refuelling was carried out as soon as your authority was received. The aircraft then came on to Bahrein in the normal manner. Shortly before leaving Karachi a signal was received under conditions of ’'Force Majeur' We trust that this explanation will put in order the actionjlsf Captain Hulsebros in landing his aircraft at Sharjah.

Dutch have now represented that while they are anxious to co-operate with His Majesty’s Government, where poss ible, they are not in a position fully to meet all our requirements. They hope however that in view of fact that proposed war time agreement did not strictly speak ing form part of stipulations to which Netherlands Govern ment were required to conform before their request for operation via Persian Gulf could be granted (see Foreign Office letter to Netherlands Minister of OctobeiP 17th) His Majesty’s Government will not press for full satis faction in this connection before acceding to it.

Dated 19th March 1942. iS&amp;. • Pan American Airwave . Mr. Littler, an official of Pan American Airways, came to see me this afternoon. He told me that he had been given to under stand that enquiries were being made about the propriety of Pan Ameri can Airways machines making use of the facilities provided at Bahrain and Sharjah for the Koyal Air Force and the British Overseas Airways Corporation, and he said he wished to explain the position. He stated that Pan American Airways were now running a regular service from the United States of America to Cairo. The first part of this journey, from the States to the West coast of Africa, was performed by Clippers while the second part of the journey, from the West Coast of Africa to Cairo, was performed by land planes. He said that east of Cairo Pan American Airways were at present only operating on chartered flights i.e. Pan American Airways machines word chartered for flights east of S. 5. MFP—4QQSAP—(M-480)—26-7*84— 2 , 00 , 000 . / CalTOCairo by the United States Aray, the British Army or the Royal Air Force. Ie stated that the machines used east of Cairo bore the distinguishing marks of the United States Army and that they were, in effect, the property of the United states Army while under charter and Fan American Air ways were merely the operating agents. ’ Littler about the Clippers which landed at Bahrain on 23th December 1941 and 23th January 1942. He told me that they had been chartered for special flights to India for military purposes but that in future the Clippers would not be used on the Persian Gulf air route but their use would be restricted exclusively to the Atlantic flight. He auded that it was their intention to develop the land plane route which would be from Basra to Sharjah and from Sharjah to Karachi. Bahrain would not normally be used as a stopping place. 3. I explained to Mr. Littler that there seemed to have bean some misunderstanding since the use by Pan American Air ways machines of the facilities provided at Bahrain Sharjah and Dubai had not been authorised by the Rulers of those places. 4. Ur. Littler asked what steps should be taken to obtain the authorisation required from the Shaikhs. I in forme; him that he or his Principals should approach the Government of India in whose political jurisdiction were in cluded the Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf. Mr .Littler replied that Pan American Airways had no organisation in India and it would be difficult for them to make represent- aoijns at Delhi. He said that he was returning to Cairo in a day or two and asked whether the matter could not be taken up there. 1 said that I did not know whether a final decision could be reached at Cairo but that, if he wished to pursue the matter there, he should approach Colonel Prior who was / IndianIndia's representative on the Middle East War Council. 5. The impression which I derived from my talk with ~ 8r was that he contemplates a thoroughly organised, three-day-a-week air service from Cairo to Karachi, run as a commercial concern with priority for military material or personnel* Political Agent, Bahrain.\ ,x GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

This includes the arrival of Signor Venturini, Middle East Manager of the Italian airline Ala Littoria, in Bahrain in September 1939, investigating an extension of an Ala Littoria air route between Rome and Bangkok (ff 46-52, 64-66, 101-105), and a request from the Japanese Government for reciprocal air links between Britain and Japan in January 1940 (ff 91-92).However, the majority of the file is taken up with correspondence relating to the Dutch airline Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappih (KLM) and their request to use the Arab coast air route and its facilities, after Iran’s withdrawal of permission for them to use facilities on the Persian coast of the Gulf in 1940. British Government correspondence on the matter includes discussion of a wartime agreement with KLM, offering the use of British air facilities, in return for KLM occasionally putting their transport at Britain’s disposal for military requirements.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Pan American World Airways</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij, airline</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ala Littoria, Italian national airline</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002ef#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
