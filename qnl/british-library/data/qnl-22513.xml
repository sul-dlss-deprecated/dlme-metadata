PETROLBUM CORPARY LIMITED. 19, Moorgate, London, E.C.2. 10th August, 1934. Dear Mr. Laithwaite, I would refer further to your letter P.Z.4739 of the 25th July and the accompanying enclosure. (Cj » I venture to think that it would be much better in the interests of everyone concerned that there should be, where possible, a decision of a majority failing, that is, unanimity. Also, I think that in the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal should be one capable of deciding questions which might be described as those of law as v/ell as questions of fact. As I understand it, there is no la?/ of Bahrein directly bearing on the grant of mineral rights, yet there must surely grov/ up some rule of conduct in these cases. To apply the law of another State is not, I suggest, constitutionally sound and v/ould in any event lead to very grave difficulties and misunderstandings. This v/ould be so if only for the reason that it would be impossible to apply to Bahrein the laws of this country because our lav/s governing the leasing of-mineral rights are numerous and complex, whilst the position in Bahrein is simple and the Lease we are dealing with is probably the only one of its kind. S. You will see that I have endeavoured to legislate for the failure of the parties interested to appoint their own Representatives and to ensure that in any event a decision can be obtained on a Reference for decision. 4. There is one difficulty, and that is finding someone impartial to nominate the person occupying the position of/2. 9./ of ’'Umpire'. The appointment by the British Political Resident of the Representative of His Excellency the Sheikh of Bahrein is one thing, but surely the impartiality of the Tribunal would be likely to be interfered with if two of the Members of the Tribunal were to be appointed by one and the same person. If, as I understand is the case, the President for the time being of the Permanent Court of International Justice is not a suitable choice, could we not find someone else likely to be impartial? 5. Perhaps you will let me have your views on the enclosed draft, which is provisional only. I am sending it forward to-day to San Prancisco for consideration there. It would be a great help if I could have your views in the meantime. 6. I think we are nearing the end of our discussions and I should like to work for agreement on all matters out standing before you leave on your vacation because the details of engrossing, translating and execution wml no doubt occupy quite a considerable time. 7. You will see I have deleted the words in sub-crause (a) of your draft, being 'during the currency oi this Agreement'. I think the new clause would go beyond the other provisions so that any questions arising in connection with the Agreement etc. would be dealt with although, say, the term of years under the Lease had been concluded. 8. I have also deleted the words 'or execution' app earing in the same paragraph because, I suggest, they are meaningless. There can surely be no question concerning the execution of the document by the parries concerned. We will be satisfied that the parties executing the document in good faith, execute it legally and in a binding form.3. 9. You will see I have put square brackets round the words appearing in sub-clause (a) and being 'and after consultation with the British political Agent in Bahrein or the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf'. I do not quite know what is intended or, in fact, what is the real meaning of this. Yours sincerely, (Sgd. ) H. R. BALLAliTYHE J. G.

Ttie provisions to Pe inserted in the Mining Lease to Toe taken out Toy the Bahrein petroleum Company have teen the subject of considerable discussion for over a year. The Mining Lease in its original form was an. unsatisfactory document and have been anxious in particular to secure some improvement in the financial terms embodied in it. Discussion with the Company has resulted in a substantial improvement in the financial terms* while a large number of other modifications* the effect of which will be more adequately to secure the interests of the sheikh, have also been made in the draft. Certain concessions have, on the other hand, been made to the Company. Of these, the most important are perhaps the right, embodied in Article XI of the draft, to terminate the Lease upon not less than 3 months' notice, and the insertion of a more elaborate provision (which is, however, equally in the interests of th Sheikh) in respect of arbitration. Ih e draf t in its present f o rrn al so embo d ie s une liabilities accepted by the Company under their Indenture of istn June 1930 with the sheikh (save in so far as the position of Major Holmes is concerned), togsthei with those accepted in the case of the Prospecting Licence in their Indenture with the sheikh oi 15th February 1933, with certain minor subsequent moaifications. o O £2 3 The note which follows indicates briefly the main alterations which have been made ana refers to the correspondence in which they have been accepted. Copies of all correspondence with the Compaay or the interested departments of H.M.G. regarding the r e vis ion of the Mining Lease have been sent on various dates to the Government of India and Bushire.

With reference to your letter of the 18th Octob o enclosing a oound set of the calibration tables of the storage tanks in Bahrein, I have no criticism to offer on these. But these tables are in American barrels, and the royalty provisions of the agreement are on a basis of statute tons. Paragraphs 6 - 8 ol Ballantyne’s letter of the 7th May explain ho?; it is proposed to translate the calculations into tons, and in my letter to you of the 10th May (paragraph 3) I said that these proposals might oe agreed to subject to the concurrence of the independent person who did the calibration work. I added that I understood from Hamilton that he had already discussed these points with -Redwoods, and had secured their informal agreement. I should have thought it would have been desirable for Bedwoods to furnish a statement to be appended to the tables showing how it was intended that they should be used for the purpose of measuring the oil for royalty. On the other hand the Company ma^ say that, having had the tanks calibrated and having indicated how they proposed to use them for assessing the amount ox ioyalty, there is nothing further which they should be asked to do. Inis matter has, of course, virtually reached the point •vhen xfc is a matter of local administration, and without first hard knowledge it is difficult for us to do much more in the vcny ol advising. The calibration of the tanks is inroortant althwaite, Esq., India Office, but/ Whitehall y O 9 W 1 * f * JLo 'but the business of measuring and of checking the measurement of oil is a specialised one. The Company in their letter of the 7th May clearly contemplate that the Sheikh will appoint a representative to watch over his interests, and when one remembers that every four tons of oil represent over £1 in royalty it is clearly in the Sheikh's interest that there should be someone who has aknowle.dge of this business to look after his interests. That was what I had in mind in suggesting that it might he desirable to send out a man like Catherall who, in a comparatively short visit, would be able to advise the Sheikh what he needed in the way of a representative to do this work. I only mentioned Catherall because he has been in Government employ for a long period during which he was responsible, amongst other matters, for this sort of work, and he was then free. I do not know whether he is still free, but he is now doing consulting work, and if you wish to get in touch with him his address is 4, London Wall Buildings (Telephone: London Wall 2444) . But -whether or not we use Catherall, I feel that the Sheikh should be advised that he ought to appoint a representative, as the concession provides, who has some knowledge of this class of work, or who can be trained to do it, and that as there may be considerable sums of money involved it would be desirable, if there is no one suitable available locally, to have technical advice from, a competent person as to what is necessary. (See in connection with this Loch's despatch of 5th April, c/367/lO/l.VXI.) The last -paragraph of my letter of the 10th May referred to another point which needs consideration locally, viz; what arrangements the Company should be required to make/make to dispose of ballast water from tankers arriving ballast.

Memorandum of discussion at the India Office on 26th October, 1934, between Mr.Fraser of Mr.Walton and Mr .Laithwaite, the Anglo-Persian Oil ComnanT Mr. Fraser called at the India Office on the 26th October to make a communication regarding the future of the Bahrein Petroleum Company's concession in Bahrein. He said that for some months past very tentative and confidential discussions had been proceeding between the I.P.C. and the Standard Oil of California in regard to this concession. It appeared that the discussions were suggested consequent on the difficulty vihich the Bahrein Petroleum Company was experiencing in finding a market for its oil and the anxiety, on the other hand, of the I.P.C. to eliminate American interests from an area in which they regarded them as having no right to operate and to meet the threat which a very large production by those interests would constitute in the market. 8. In the course of the last few days the Chairman of the Standard Oil had at last intimated that he was prepared to come to London (arriving at the beginning of November) in order to examine the possibilities of some arrangement with ■the I.P.C. more closely. He had given an estimate of the potential productive capacity of Bahrein which the I.P.C. regarded as optimistic. In view, however, of the relevance of this point to the nature of any arrangement to be concluded they had thought it desirable to accept an offer of the Standard Oil to allow representatives of the I.P.C. to visit Bahrein/Bahrein and verify the positic the principal negotiating grot; despatched for this purpose bj Bahrein would suffice for the They would return by air, so t investigations could be avails Chairman of the Standard Oil.

Three representatives of the principal negotiating groups had accordingly been despatched for this purpose by aeroplane.

Fraser emphasised that matters were still at a very early stage and that it was impossible to forecast until the discussions had proceeded further what, if any, arrangement could be reached between the Standard Oil and the I.P.C. He did, however, indicate that no transaction was likely to be entirely satisfactory to the I.P.C. which did not result in the elimination of the Standard Oil from Hasa as well as from Bahrein - in a word, in the exclusion of independent operation by the Standard Oil from the Gulf Sheikhdoms and Ibn Saud's territory» and that the I.P.C. were anxious to secure as a minimum a 50 ner cent, interest in the operations of the Standard Oil and its subsidiary companies in this area. Various possibilities were a deal about markets, the effect of which would be to give the Bahrein Petroleum Company some share in markets at present closed to them in return ior some understanding as to volume of production; the buying out of the Bahrein Petroleum Company altogether; jointoperation; or an arrangement under which the position in Bahrein remained unchanged, but the I.P.C. in return for marketing concessions to the Bahrein Petroleum Company secured counter concessions from the Standard oil in respect of the Hasa area. 4. The embarrassing nature of the situation which had been created by the failure of the I.'P.C. to give earlier information to the India Office as to their negotiations and by the despatch without warning of representatives to Bahrein was pointed out to Mr.Fraser. The effect of this visit on hie Sheikh might well be very unfortunate and might react urejudicially on his attitude towards any arrangement to which the Company might at a later stage wish to secure his approval. Mr.Fraser expressed extreme regret that any misunderstanding should have arisen. He was, he said, most anxious for patriotic reasons to re-establish British influence in this area, and he had hoped that this would be one result of the present discussions He undertook to give the fullest possible information to the India Office as l-o the course of the negotiations between the I.P.C. and the Standard Oil, on the understanding that it as confidential. would be regarded 5. After further discussion it was agreed that the Political Resident should at once be given confidentially lull information as to the position in reply to his telegram of 06th October, No.907; but that, in the event of the Sheikh asking for an explanation of the visit of the representatives, it would be better, particularly having regard to the very early stage which the negotiations had reached, and to the diificulty of forecasting their outcome, that he should be informed that we understood that certain groups of the I.P.C. interested in marketing in the Far East were contemplating tentative discussions with the Standard Oil which might affect/4 affect the disposal of the output of oil at Bahrein, and that they had been anxious, with a view to these discuss to ioiiii their own impressions as to potential production the area covered by the Bahrein Petroleum Company ’ s concession., 0FJ?

The grant of all mineral rights throughout the Islands of Bahrein and their territorial waters is within the exclusive right of the sheikh of Bahrein as Government of Bahrein acting under the aavice of the British political Resident. 2 The lease proposed to he granted under the Concession Agreement of 2nd December 1925, is the constitutional act of the state of Bahrein and, as such, operates with legislative force and effect. The registration of the ownership of lana is voluntary hut registration of conveyances or other like disposition of land is compulsory. Applications for registration are preceded hy advertisement (proclamation 90 days) of application ana for objections; also investigation is made into title. Squatter rights recognized if based on continuous (uninterrupted) unprotested occupation for ten years. 3* A greater part of the lana within the grant as shown on the existing plan of area proposed to he applied for is to be reckoned as uncultivated. All the land on Sitra Islana between the cultivated part on the north ana the village of_ on the south is state-owned ana uncultivated and is, therefore, within paragraph 1, Article II of lease/ There may be one or two areas in private ownership but this is doubtful. The whole of sitra Island is unsurveyed. Some of the land on the mainland proposed at present bo oe selected is privately owned by the sheikh of Bahrein ana particulars are to be forthcoming so that the/the alterations proposed to Article II to put trie sheikh in his private capacity on the same footing as that of other private owners is open for the moment, p, o Unused and State-owned land within Manama, although within municipal jurisdiction, comes within the provisions of the lease concerning uncultivated land. Uncultivated land, including that along Manama shoreline and the piece of land adjoining Manager's house in Manama, can he called upon for the purposes of the Company's business. 6, Every sale or lease of uncultivated land by the Government within and without the leased area is subject to the right of the Company to have such land for its use, under Article II, paragraph 1. Prom, a procedure point of view, however, if any sale or lease oy the Government is contemplated, it shall be proclaimed in the same manner as proposed conveyances of land are now proclaimed, i.e., 90 days' proclamation of intention to sell or lease, will be given, tne Company being served with a copy of the proclamation leaving the Company to object* 7. Sales or leases of State land are not numerous ana are not encouraged. 8. whilst the right to build in Manama for h purposes of Company's business is recognized, any Mjy ' ' *** building would be subject to existing By-laws, regulations for town planning, harbour regulations, etc. 9.

Company strongly urge || that it is unreasonable to ask them to agree to abandon rights over uncultivated property belonging to Shaikh in his private capacity in the absence of clear understanding as to what area is covered. They understand survey is contemplated but that this may take time. In absence of definite inform- ation Company cannot accept modification of Article II, paragraph No:l. Proposal in note of meeting October 22nd received under Bahrain despatch No:C/851-10/l of October 24th (see in this connection paragraph ^o:4 of Ballantyne’s u .yV®/ , /summary \I i11 Page 3. 2 . summary of discussion sent by air mail). Company suggest first paragraph to be amended to read as follows 'The Shaikh grants gratituously to the Company all Icind uncuitivated at the date of the eAecutuon of this lease belonging to trie Shaikh inclusive 01 uncultivated land privately owned ' Ov nim ^but exclusive of land within urban areas of iiuharraq and ^ianamah) which may be needed bv one Company for their operations' PART 3. in trie event of acceptance of this wording they would be prepared to enter into earnest undertaking to be embodied in formal document that uncultivated land belonging to the Shaikh in his private capacity will be excluded from the operation of Article II once it has been delimited and to the extent to which Company has not at the time of such delimitation operated over it. Ballantyne either himself or Company indicated It might be possible should it be found operations of Company had at date of delimitation extended over such private property of Shaikh to consider possibility of compensation at a figure which -^elgrave considered fair market price. c. Please telegraph your view urgently. Owing to loose drafting of Article II of original Mining Lease our legal position as against Company extremely weak and I nelp feeling that there is much force in their request t,^ ^liole, trierefore, i am inclined to think, unless necessary delimitation can oe completed in course of say a month from now, v.e should do best accept arrangement on the lines proposed by them particularly If as Ballantyne seems to assume, if is Improbable operations of Company Bave been at any rate to a material extent on land which Shaikh has claim might claim as private property. cannot onPART 4. 7.

London, E,C. 2. 21st November 1934. Dear Mr. Laithwaite, It occurs to me to let you know that this Company has been approached hy Eastern and General Syndicate Limited for information as to the method to be adopted in calculating the royalty to he paid to His Excellency the sheikh of Bahrein. Whilst the Company has no objection to doing this, it feels that this is a matter which it is not for it alone to decide, and so the syndicate have been informed. The way it has been put to the syndicate is that provided the Sheikh of Bahrein has no objection, this Company would be pleased to give the Eastern and General syndicate Limited full information as to the arrangement it has made with His Excellency with regard to the precise method of arriving at the production figures on which the royalty payable to him is arrived at. The Eastern and General syndicate Limited state, in reply, that they have no doubt their representative in Arabia can obtain His Excellency's confirmation of this and so soon as this is received, they will take pleasure in acquainting this Company of such confirmation. »G.

The previous correspondence 19th November 1934. ) referred to in it (in particular / Ballantyne s letter of 7th May and Starling’s letter of 20th October) has already been sent to Bushire, Bahrein and 'the Government of india. we should be grateful if you would oe good enough to consider the question whether, in tne light of the correspondence which has passed there is any case, at this stage at any rate, for considering recommending to the Sheikh of Bahrein that he should engage an expert such as Mr.Catherall, whose name has been mentioned m the previous correspondence, to advise the local authorities on the question of the detailed arrangements in connection with measurement etc. of oil for royalty purposes.

Redwood concur in the proposals embodied in paragraphs 6-8 of Ballantyne’s letter to me oi '/Gii may last. Perhaps you would let me know whether you agree? 3 * As regards a further point arising out of paragraph 1 of your letter under reference, Ballantyne indicated/ Starling, e O /~'i oU • HI ’ ? Pet to 1 eurn Depa rtment, Min e s De partmen t, Dean Stanley street,i mY'ju 2 indicated that the Company's view was that his letter ox &lt; to May gave a oai.iiuienu explanation of the procedure to he adopted and that (if I understood him aright) the object of the tables was merely for conversion purposes. 4. I haa already mentioned to him unofficially that we were considering tne desirability of advising the Sheikh to employ an expert adviser for a brief period, who could explain any difficulties tnat the local authorities might find in dealing with the rather complicated measurement procedure. I asked him, in the light of his discussions at Bahrein, whether he thought that this was necessary and added that we did not, of course, wish to advise the Sheikh to spend money unless there was good reason for doing so. Ballantyns expressed his own opinion that the arrangements for measurement, etc. were foolproof; that they could be grasped by anyone of ordinary intelligence with very little difficulty; and that in these circumstances there was probably not a very strong case for sending anyone out, at any rate at this stage. He made an offer, which X accepted, that he should write to Davies3 mfKm M Till (who is their Fiela Manager) and ask him to draw up an explanatory statement for the use of Belgrave and his assistants in Bahrein, and to take Belgrave and any other representatives of the Bahrein Government who might he concerned with measurement on trial trips through the measuring process. If, after they had gone through the process in detail, they still felt douht, it would, of course, he open to them to raise the question of sending out an expert. Alternatively, they might think it worth while to suggest that an expert he called in after they had had six months or a year's working experience. His own view was, however, that they were unlikely to need anyone, ard after the detailed explanation which he gave me (with the assistance of plans) of the measuring procedure, I confess^ that I thought there was something in this, subject to your further comments I propose to send this letter to Bahrein and to leave it to the Political Agent and Belgrave to raise the question of securing expert advice from home if on further consideration they think it necessary to do so. we, at/Bv Air Mail.

Yours faithfully. 4 I.C.S., Assistant Political Agent,.Bahrain. l \—t / Bahrain, Deer. 3,1934. Dear Colonel Loch, MS* ; ' With reference to your D.O. Ho. C/913-lO/l dated lovember 22, 1934, the following are the particulars of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad's uncultivated and privately owned land. 2. A tract of land in the neighbourhood of Zellaq on the western coast of Bahrain included in the following boundaries and shoY/n on the enclosed map. On North, Sakhara, a spring in the hill near Sedad. South, Angah. H.E. says that this means a certain ruined mosque shown on the enclosed plan, not the well of the same name. ft West, the sea. !r East, ’Al-ThiP — H.E. says that this means the top of the hills. The word means rocky ground, according to local dialect. Die- tionary gives it as ?, Curved n . These lands were gifted to His Excellency by the late Shaikh Isa by a gift document of which a copy is enclosed. It is dated 1340. The southern portion of the area is entirely unculti vated land. In the northern portion there are numerous date gardens and cultivation, some of which are owned by individuals other than His Excellency. 3. His Excellency also owns the Country PalacePalace at Sakhir with its mosque, outbuildings and fenced-in garden as well as hunting boxes at Amr, Rumaitha, and Om-at-tala which consist of groups of small buildings. Title deeds do not exist fbr these properties. 4. His Excellency also claims the owner ship of a strip of ground approximately half mile wide and three miles in length along the main road from Sakhir to Amr which he uses for exercising his horses. Ho title deed exists. 5. The water ?/ell of the Bahrain Petro leum Company north of Zellaq and a portion of the pipe conveying the water to the Bahrain Petroleum Company Camp is inside the area des cribed in my paragraph E. The well and pipe line were installed with the knowledge of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad who did not raise any objection to its being built. 6. In July 1931, the Company applied to the Bahrain Government for a plot of land measuring 15 - 20 acres east of Zellaq around their first water well, (which was afterwards abandoned). The Bahrain Government granted to the Company ten acres of this site. 7. The Company in the following year drilled a second water well closer to the sea. In June 1932, the Company requested the grant of 18.4 acres adjacent to the second well, extending from the well to the sea. This ground was to be used for a garden and a re creation ground.I inspected the ground with Messrs. Skinner and Miller. On 18th June 1932, the Chief Local Representative submitted a map indicating this land and asking that it should be granted. Nothing further was done, the matter lapsed. 8.

Dear Mr.Laithwaite, v V\ I am in receipt of your letter P.Z.7139/34 of the 24th instant and the enclosures referred to therein. It is very kind and helpful of you to have the Arabic translation checked by Mr.Arberry, and so far as the Company is concerned, it is quite prepared to accept the translation as correct by giving effect to Mr.Arberry*s suggestions and correcting the omissions from the Arabic 1/ VjL. 1/ ♦ To this end we have arranged that I return to you the copy Arabic translation accompanying your letter under reply (it is herewith) and thatyou obtain two or three further copies from Bahrein so that Mr.Arberry may make all necessary corrections thereto and you return to Bahrein one or more of such copies in order that the same may be used for the purposes of preparing the engrossments of the Mining Lease for signature I have telegraphed to Mr.Davies at Bahrein informing him of this proposal and asking him to see the Political Agent and to assist, if he can, in the copies you ask for being sent to you by to-day's mail: you should have them, therefore, on Tuesday. You refer to the understanding of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that the Company would be ready to intimate in writing that it absolves the Bahrein Agency m responsibility for the Arabic translation of the Lease: have pleasure in confirming, on behalf of the Company, that such was the understanding upon which the Bahrein Agency undertook the work of translation.I As to paragraph 3 of your letter, I agree with your remarks, hub with this reminder to you, that the alter at ions cisIascI j- or ctiic! 1 011 't 8,'t i vb ly ci^r'eBci at* 'R p b xn have yet to lecei've the formal consideration, and sanction Oi. tne COiiipauy.

X shall take cabled instructions on the matter as a whole. It would, ix course, only create confusion in the minds of me people in dan inaneisco ii X asked for instructions on individual alterations - particularly is this the case in regard to Article II of the proposed Lease; that Article must he treated as a whole. as to paragraph 5, I have since explained to you that we arranged in Bahrein that the Lease should be typewritten there in three parts, i.e. one top and two carbon copies, which are to be executed in Bahrein by or on behalf of both parties thereto. As to paragraph 6 of your letter, thank you for pointing out the apparent redundancies existing in Article II; that Article has, however, been considered oy the Company and everyone else concerned and I hesitate very much to suggest a modification of it at this stage. Therefore, as you have no very strong views aoout it, I think it should be allowed to stand as we have got it. To turn to Mr.Arberry f s letter to you 2.7195/34 of the 23rd November, I think all the omissions referred to by Mr.Arberry should be inserted; oome of them are very important; one or two definitely misleading. m b « h; cj n Ulj -ice. s.w. 1 .

But I am asked to obtain from you an assurance on behalf of the Company that the form complies with the requirements of the Company's Articles of Association, perhaps you would be good enough to let me have this in due course?

I further gather, from our conversation, that Mr. Russell should, unless anything unforeseen occurs* he available in Bahrein at the date of signature of the Agreement, and that an arrangement to enable him to sign alone on behalf of the Company would involve the issue of a fresh power of Attorney, and the difficulty and delay associated therewith, in these circumstances, and on the understanding that this shall be without prejudice to the position of the Chief Local Representative, we do not wish to press that the Agreement should be signed3 by Mr. Russell alone, but we think it desirable, having regard to the position of the chief Local Representative, that he should be one of the two signatories, and we should be glad if the Company would be good enough to make the necessary arrangements for this.

Dear Mr.Laithwaite, &gt;' I am in receipt this afternoon of your letter P. Z .7292/34' of the 28th November. Referring to paragraph 2 of your said letter,! have pleasure in assuring you, on behalf of the Company, that the form of the Power of Attorney referred to complies with the requirements of the Company*s Articles of Association, or By-laws as they are called in Canada. I have looked into the Canadian Companies 1 Act, the Company's Charter and By-Laws. As to paragraph 3 of your letter, - certainly, if Mr.Russell is available he will be a signatory to the Mining Lease under the title of 'Chief Local Representative' with either Mr.P.A.Davies or Mr.Dale Nix. I observe the reservation that you make in the last sentence of paragraph 3 but I am afraid that X must point out that there is no provision anywhere, or understanding, that the Chief Local Representative should be the person to sign documents on behalf of the Company. Whilst no point is made of this at this juncture and I hope that Mr.Russell will be there to sign the Lease with one of the other two gentlemen named by the Company for the purpose, I feel sure you will appreciate that I must take the point that it would be impracticable for the Company to bind itself in principle to the theory that the Chief Local Representa tive must sign documents on behalf of the Company, with that /o that reservation I venture to add that the Political XI Resident and the Political Agent may rest assured that the Company will at all times do what it can to keep in mind the special position of the Chief Local Representative Your s sinc e r ely, ( Sd. ) H.

Dear Mr. Ballantyne, The Resident has now telegraphed Colonel Loch's views on the outstanding points in connection with the Mining Lease, and I write to confirm that we hope to discuss them at 3.30 tomorrow, 16th November. 2. The position as I understand it is now as follows:- f\ Article II . |n*Y1 From paragraph 4 of the summary of the discussions at Bahrein, which you kindly sent me in your letter of 30th October, I gather that certain further particulars in regard to land on the mainland proposed at present to be selected, and privately owned by the sheikh of Bahrein, were to be forthcoming, and that you regarded the alteration proposed in Article II to put the sheikh, in his private capacity, on the same footing as that of other private owners, as open for the moment. I am not quite clear as to the effect of this reservation on the following/ Ballantyne, Esq., Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited, 19, Moorgate,following modifications, which I understand were provisionally agreed in your discussions at Bahrein, hut we might perhaps discuss this? The alterations arej- (&amp;) Fi rst paragraph . To he altered to read as follows;- 'The Sheikh grants gratuitously to the Company all land ^uncultivated at the date of the execution of this Lease belonging to the sheiklr (exclusive of land privately owned by him) which may be needed by the Company for their operations'. (h) Third paragraph , (with a view to making the point taken in (a) perfectly clear). The words 'including the sheikh, in his capacity as a private landholder' to be inserted after the word 'proprietors' in line 5. (c) Fifth paragraph , line 8, The word 'occupy' to be deleted and replaced by the words 'acquire as provided by paragraph 3 of this ArtLcle'. In addition to the alterations discussed above, Colonel Loch, with whom the Resident agrees, has now suggested that urban areas, even if uncultivated, should5 be considered to tall within paragraph No.3 instead of paragraph No.1 of the Article. Colonel Loch and the Political Resident remark that the term 'uncultivated land' was never, in their view, intended to cover valuable town property, for example, or land in the vicinity of the .Sheikh's palace. There is, I think, force in this criticism and we should be grateful if the Company would consider it. we might discuss the method by which effect could be given to the Political Agent's suggestion if, as we hope, you are willing to accept it. Article III . I understand that it was agreed at your discussions at Bahrein that the word ''territory' should be substituted for the word 'territories in this Article. To this there seems no objection. Article VIIT . I understand that it was agreed that the words 'at the rate of' should be inserted before the words 'Rs.75,000'. There is no objection to this from our point of view. Article XIX/Article XIX, (a) It was agreed as the result of correspondence with the Company during your absence, and it was also independently agreed in your discussions at Bahrein, that after 1940' in parag raph 2 of this Article there should he inserted the words 'and if the Lease he sooner terminated then at the time of such termination,.' (b) The Political Authorities in the Gulf suggest the following further addition to the Article £aj.§g r 8-ph 2, line 6, after the words 'sheikh shall' insert the words 'in the event of this Lease not being terminated'. We trust that the Company will see no objection to this. Article XXII (g) I understand that it was agreed in your discussions at Bahrein to amend this Article to readi- if the Tribunal think fit be examined on oath or solemn affirmation'. To this we see no objection. I ought to add that the resident informs us that a draft Arab translation of the lease is following by air.4. A question still outstanding, of the method of execution. I think:, Is that 5 I am also anxious to take advantage of your kind offer to discuss the difficulties which have arisen in connection with calibration, both those referred to in my letter of 2.3rd October, P,z.6589/34, and the other question which I discussed informally with you the other day as to the steps to oe taken to safeguard the sheikh* s interests on the question of measurements.

It looks as though they had found their Far Eastern | markets. The local authorities in Bahrein will no I I doubt let us know if they get any indication of the M place to which the oil is to be shipped. If you receive any information independently we should be much interested to see it. 2* I am sending copies of this letter and its enclosure to Bendel and to seal. Yours sincerely, J.C. LAITHWAITE.

Dear Mr. Laitnwaite, It may be of interest to you to know that I Lave this morning received from san Francisco a cable telling me that the standard oil company of California's Tanker 'Hiearn' is due to arrive at Bahrein about the ,7th January^to load approximately one hundred thousand barrels of crude oil.

Redwood to Hamilton, a copy of which you enclosed, we csnnow agree that the proposals embodied in paragraphs 6-8 of BaHantyne’s letter of the 7th May provide a satisfactory procedure for assessing the quantity of crude oil for royalty purposes. I think it would be advisable to supply a copy of Redwood’s letter to the authorities in Bahrein, the advantage of this being that they will have on record the view of the independent firm, which carried out the calibration of the tanks, that the proposed, method of conversion is a satisfactory one. The calibration tables merely provide data showing the quantity of oil in American barrels which the tanks as measured were estimated to hold, and the quantities at various depths, thus making it possible to ascertain the quantity drawn off by reference to a change in the level of the oil in the tanks. Prom these ascertainments calculations have to be made to convert the quantities into statute tons which is the basis of the agreement for royalty purposes and the methods for doing this which the Company have proposed we now agree. As regards the checking of measurements, I have nothing to add to my letter of the 20th October. But I have no C objection to offer to the suggestion you have made to Powle in your letter to him of the 23rd November. Hhwaite, Esq. , «ia Office, ' ^itehall, s.W. 1. Yours sincerely, (Sgd. ) P. C.

We have just received your telegram of 14th December, 1223, but do •e Hon’ble Lt.col; T.C.W. Fowle The Residency, Bushire. C.B.E.,not, of course, yet know whether you ana the political Agent will see any objection to the crafts, hay I, however, remark on the point raisea in paragraph 1 of your telegram of 14th December that our difficulty is that the Bahrein Petroleum Company appear to be in a strong legal position ana that if we are not prepared to meet them over the question of water they are, so far as we can judge, entitled to refuse to meet the sheikh over the question of his privately owned uncultivated iand. In these circumstances they would, of course, retain the right to draw and use water from any part of the area not covered by their lease, in accordance with the terms of sub-paragraph 2 of Article I of the Third Schedule to the original Concession of 2nd December 1925. 3. we think it very desirable that, assuming that agreement is reached as to its contents, the Lease should be signed by the 31st December. In these circumstances, and to save time, I have asked the Assistant Librarian here (a) to insert in the margin of an Arabic text of the Lease the Arabic version of the corrections or additions set out below. (The reference is to the 'List of notes on the English version' contained in Arberry's/- * V 91 • 'I * .mmm m— ry •- o Arberry's memorandum of 23rd November 1934, copies of which were sent you under my letter P.Z.7195/34 of the same date). (h) To insert, in Article III, suh-paragraph 2 an Arabic translation of the words 'shall enter the said territory free', which, in the draft Arabic translation sent home from Bahrein, are translated 'shall be free'. (c) To produce an Arabic draft of Article I, sub-paragraph 2, and of Article II, sub-paragraph 1, in the terms suggested in the Secretary of State's telegram 2950 of 12th December referred to above. If it is finally agreed that these redrafts are to stand, then Bahrein will have been provided with the necessary Arabic drafts. If, on the other hand, any modification is necessary, it can presumably be made with little difficulty locally in the Arabic text. (i) Page 4 . Article V . sub-paragraph 5 .

The Shaikh said that he had two title deeds for this land, one for the north and one for the south, but he has only got one deed. The Adviser learned from local c; people that the mosque is not called An^ar. it seem: probable therefore that the Shaikh only owns the northern plot.
