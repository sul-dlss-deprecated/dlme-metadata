Repeated Government of India, Simla. Political Agent, Bahrain. Beferettce nsym v &amp; &gt; 75 Mr. E.V. Packer, representative of Petroleum Concessions Limited at Bahrain, has applied for a permit to bring into Bahrain two shot guns and one Webley .455 pistol, stating that he will be touring on the Trucial Coast in a motor dhow and the weapons would be useful for protection. 2* Bor the present the weapons are being deposited in the Bahrain Customs (with access for the owner to clean them) as has been done in the past in certain cases. 3* This request raises the question whether or not employees of Petroleum Concessions Limited are to be permitted to carry arms in the Trucial Coast Shaikhdcms and Qatar. Personally I feel that it would be a mistake for them to do sc. The entire responsibility for their protec tion lies on the Shaikh concerned (indeed, it has been pro posed - see paragraph 3(h) of your Express Letter 2078/36 April 3rd 1936 - that in certain cases the Shaikh’s prior {Signature) wr i 11 ei} 1 §. 44. MFP—367 S&amp;P—(M-508)—15-7-35—10.0C0. {Designation) l8 . - 2 - written permission for visiting places will required) and if any doubt arises as to the adequacy of his mea sures, the Shaikh should he approached about it* Neither I, nor the Assistant Political Agent, nor the Agency Medical Officer, take arms with us (though our position is on rather a different footing). Bin Sa*ud does not allow arms to be carried by the employees of the Cali fornia Arabian Standard Oil Company Limited. The em ployees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company are not per mitted to import arms or ammunition. Although protection is the entire responsi bility of the Shaikh concerned, it may be argued that some sudden emergency may arise, for which the guards may prove inadequate or that the guards or workers may themselves give trouble. I think that the chances of this, as the Company are working in the interests of the Shaikh and under his specific protection, are small, but that there is on the other hand a risk of trouble from the ill-advised display or use of firearms by the Company’s employees, should they be allowed to have them. 6 * later on, any of the Shaikhs invites (pre- 1 erably in writing to the Political Agent sc that he may not afterwards disclaim it) any employee of the Company to shoot small game (as may well happen in, for example, Bas-al-Khaimah), there would then be no objection to his taking in a shot gun, provided that at the time the Political Agent, Bahrain, agrees and that reasonable precautions are taken against theft. 7 * 1 would recommend that the Company should be asked to warn their employees that they should not bring firearms or ammunition to Bahrain or to the Trucial Coast or Qatar.3 8# licwever, tlie matter is one cf principle which will affect Gelonel Fcwle, I should he grateful if the matter could he discussed with him.

VfilThHALL. 3.W. a 4tn January 19So Dear Gornmnder Bayloion, I I had better write with further reference to your letter of 30th December to let you know the present position in regard to the taking of firearms to the Persian Gulf by Mr* Barnett* 2* I mentioned in my letter of 14th December, P.3.7611/34, that we were asking the political Resident to be good enough to advise on the question of restrictions on shooting on Abu Musa, we have not yet had his reply. The position as regards the actual exportation of firearms from this countiy appears to be that, on the assumption that no objection would be seen by the authorities in the Gulf, Mr. Barnett would be asked to complete a Board of Trade form of application and to support the application by producing (a) a firearms certificate authorising him to hold the rifle in this country; or (b), if there is no firearms certificate, a statement that he desires Comander S.C.
