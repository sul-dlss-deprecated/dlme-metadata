DEPAH3M3NT OP POSTS AND AIR. D.O. No.27-V(3)/A4. , Dated New Delhi, the 25th Pebruaiy 1944. Ity dear Rumbold, Post-War sale of aircraft . Will you please refer to your letter No.E.A 0. 8163/43, dated 28th of December, 1943&gt; forwarding a copy of a letter from the technical executive of the Society of British Aircraft Constructors to Cribbett. As I understand it, under paragraph 2 (2) the Society of British Aircraft Constructors want advice (a) regarding the numbers of aircraft likely to be sold in India (b) as to the method of selling aircraft in this country, and under 2(3) regarding the best method of participating in aircraft manufacture in this country. 2. With regard to the number of aircraft likely to be required I enclose an estimate prepared by the Director of Civil Aviation in India, showing the probable requirements of aircraft of different categories, based on pre-war figures and post-war plans. The question whether a reserve of air transportation should be provided in peace-time to meet the increased calls on transportation in war-time is under the consideration of Service Staffs in connection with their examination of the question of the post-war size of the Air Force in India. The estimate does not, therefore, take into account any requirements which may emerge as a result of this examination. * 3. As regards the other points concerning civil aircraft, Tyuios advises as follows, - (1) With regard to (b) it is not quite clear why the Society of British Aircraft Constructors expect the sale/2 . sale of aircraft to be closely linked with overseas trade questions under discussion with America, or with the extent and nature of American and British Participation in air line operation. The prospects of sale of British aircraft appear to depend more on the quality of the aircraft to be offered. It is true that the British aircraft industry will more readily sell aircraft to British operators than to American operators and the extensive participation of British operators in international air services therefore will react in favour of the British aircraft industry. As regards the sale of aircraft in India, however, internal airtransport is likely to be reserved for Indian companies and both air transport operators and private owners will look for the best aircraft at the most favourable price. The sale of aircraft is very little related to general overseas trade negotiations. Aircraft must be sold individually, by intensive salesmanship and demonstration of the superiority of aircraft over all others. The British aircraft industry therefore might be advised that in order to sell aircraft in India, they should not only produce aircraft which can face any competition (whether in the matter of performance, maintenance or cost) but that they should send well qualified representatives abroad to ensure that potential users are given the fullest information about the aircraft they have to offer, and full opportunity to judge whether they are the best for their purpose. Experience in this country shows that 'after sales' service is one of the most important factors in the winning and retaining of oust cane rs in this, as in other lines of business. (2) With regard to British participation in aircraft manufacture in India, it should first be said t hat the possibility of manufacture of aircraft on a commercial basis is small. In so far as it can be made to show a prospect of commercial success, vre wish to encourage it. There is no doubt that the best way to develop aircraft manufacture is by a link up with established aircraft manufacturers with a progressive design policy. We should be glad to see such a link up with British manufacturers. Something more is wanted than the mere grant of licences to manufacture British types of aircraft. Technical assistance is certainly required, but it should be borne in mind that there are two companies with an embryonic organisation for this purpose, namely, Hidustan Aircraft Ltd., and Tata Aircraft Ltd. Either or both of these companies may wish to remain in the aircraft manufacturing business after the war, and collaboration with those companies rather than the development of direct subsidiaries to British companies is intended. It is possible /however3 however that the de Havilland Company, who have a long established subsidiaiy in India, at Karachi, which has given very good service, may wish to develop along their own lines. It is unlikely that in India any aircraft factory could set up to produce any type of commercial aircraft and obtain a vs market adequate to justify the undertaking. It appears that whatever aircraft factory is set up in India after must build up gradually to the production of complete ai-^raft through the medium of such work as the following:- (a) Assembly of aircraft, particularly where special completion work is involved. (b) Reconditioning and conversion of disposal aircraft. (c) Major overhauls and repairs of aircraft. (d) Specialised servicing operations, e.g. aircraft instruments and equipment. An aircraft factory can often render useful assistance in these directions, when special equipment and personnel are required which it is uneconomic for every operator to set up individually. 4* External Affairs Department have been consulted with regard to the sale of military aircraft to AfghanisAtan and other countries neighbouring India. It ifc a matter of policy to which the utmost importance has been attached both in London and by the Government of India that everything possible should be done to supply from British sources any aircraft which the Afghan or Nepalese Governments may require. Afghanistan has hitherto taken a comparatively small number of military aircraft and trainers and is anxious for more, and more recent, models, as soon as they can be supplied. They have hitherto required only the smaller types of aircraft suitable for Army cooperation and tribal policing. It is not expected that they would require the most advanced types of aircraft or could afford to buy them or be able to maintain them. They have however very satisfactory relations with the Rcyal Air Force who have for some years past supplied, (and still do) a pilot instructor to the Afghan Air Force. There has so far been no mention by the Afghans of any design for the larger types of bomber or civil transport aircraft. S With/4. With regard to Nepal the request for aircraft supply /' is a recent development. They have so far asked for one ■ 2 - engined aircraft capable of canying 5 or 6 people and 2 UK smaller types, and subsequently stated that they no longer ^ considered the larger aircraft necessary. They appear to require only the smaller types for taxi and communication purposes. There has been no question so far of the supply of military aircraft to Nepal. There is no doubt that, should it arise, it would be most desirable to make them available from British sources. If our plans to establish a regular air service to Kabul (and possibly beyond) after the war materialise, it will inevitably stimulate a movement in Afghanistan to develop their own civil flying even if it is only to exercise their right to operate a reciprocal service to India. A small demand for civil aircraft might then arise. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) G.V.BMOOR. SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OP INDIA. D.A. Referred to. KCil/25/2/44. H.A.P.

With reference to Mr. Lidbury’s letter of 4th July, 1941, to Mr. Crumble, I am directed by the Secretary- of State for India to inform you that the Afghan Government when making a payment to the Government of India recently in respect of certain Hind aircraft which were supplied to them by that Government in 1959, deducted. £5Q. on,account' of certain repairs which they stated had had to be carried out on one of the machines. Further enquiries have established the fact that the repairs in question were actually.carried out on one of the Hind aircraft which had been previously purchased by the Afghan Government from Messrs. Hawker Aircraft limited in 1937. It appears that the late Mr. Hussell Stracey reported the claim to the Company at the time, and a copy of a note by him dated the 18th September, 1938 has been forwarded by His Majesty's Minister at Kabul, which reads as follows:- 'The insurance claim for £50 in respect of the damaged centre sections etc. were forwarded by me and Dr. Bolcer (the loca^ Hepresentative of the InsuraoceCompany) about six months ago.

They liave been at work for a month now and though nothing of very great iiirportance haa happened I think that you i*iay be interested to hear how tilings have gone so far. 2 . The aircraft arrived in a somevaiat daraa^ied conditiofij You suggested in your telegram of 1st January (Korminka ? Ho. 2 ) tiiat this was due to very careless handling between Peshawar and Kabul. This may be so, but such evidence as I have points to it having been due to insufficiently strong packing. The cases were not externally daroaged at all, but apparently were not cross braced and were not sufficiently strong to support the weight of their contents and more or less collapsed. I do not think the Air Ministry specifica tions can have taken into account the condition of the TorkhafflcKabul road. It is very rou,^h t and over long stretches haa a corner every hundred yards or so. in fact on one portion near the Tezin valley I have counted one hundred and fifteen acute angle bends In about five miles l The consequent swaying and jolting must place a great strain on large cases. The Italian planes were more strongly packed and arrived intact, and though I have considered the possibility of sabotage I do not think there was any likeli hood of it occurring on the road.. L.

The necessity for providing some form of protection on the journey from Peshawar to Kabul is obvious, and it may be assumed that neither the Government of India nor the Afghan Government will raise any difficulties in the matter. But in order to make sure that no hitch occurs, we ought perhaps to ask the Minister at Kabul to obtain an assurance from the Afghan Government that adequate protection will be provided for each convoy during its journey in Afghan territory. 3.

My dear Minister, In the course of our discussion at the Foreign Office on the 29th July you asked some questions regarding the draft contract 'between Hawker Aircraft Limited and the Air Ministry, and the draft Exchange of Notes 'between yourself and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, v/hich were forwarded to you with Foreign Office note N 3138/2/97 of the 14th July. You asked whether there might he an increase in the period of seven days prescribed in paragraph 2 (iii) of the draft Foreign Office note as that in v/hich, in the event of an increase in price being notified to the Afghan Legation, your Government have to debide whether to cancel the order for the goods in question*fcn this point I am informed that it is necessary to preserve an ample margin between the period prescribed in the draft note and the period prescribed in the ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER correspending/ Ali Mohammad Kjian^o. 31 5 AUG 1937 Afghan Lega SEGA 'TaiIV, PG J i iGyU- 0© 1 *CRET DEPT. INDIA OFPW Jcorresponding provision in the draft contract between nawker Aircraft Limited and the Air Ministry, which stands at fourteen days, in order to give time for the Air Ministry to receive the notification of a price increase from Hawker Aircraft Limited, for this to he communicated to the Afghan Legation, and for the reply of the Legation to he passed on to the. firm. Consequently an increase in the seven days prescribed in the draft note would require an increase in the period of fourteen days prescribed in the draft contract, and this is likely to involve negotiations which might take some time between Hav/kers and their sub-contractors. It is open to Hawkers to notify an increase in price only during the fourteen days following the date of their contract, and we trust that it will be possible for you, in the event of a notification in such circumstances, to obtain an answer from your Government within seven days. Paragraph 2 (iv) of the draft note, to which you also drew attention, is rendered necessary by Clause 9 of the draft contract. Hawkers were asked at an early stage in the negotiations by the Air Ministry to omit thisarticle and declined to do so on the ground that it is not unknown for governments to levy customs dut;&gt;os on state goods. Although I agree that in this case such a clause is perhaps unnecessary, it does not seem definitely objectionahle; and, in view of Messrs* hawkers’ attitude, it would seem preferable not to ask them to reconsider their decision* As regards paragraph 2 (v) (a) of the draft note, the credit of £75,000 offered by the Government cf India is the equivalent of Rs.10 lakhs, a rupee being taken as worth ls/6d. Clause 8 (a) of the draft contract was drafted in consultation with Ghund Mishar Muhammad Ihsan Khan, and had his concurrence in its present form. The phrase 'Subject to_fprce m ajeure and to all factors. outside your immediate control' frequently occurs in contracts of this type, and I doub'c whether Hawkers would be agreeable to altering it at this stage. As regards the question of insurance, I find that, in the event of the sum payable in respect of insurance/—insurance differing from £600, the difference would he adjusted in accordance with the penultimate sentence of paragraph 2 (v) of the draft note, with the instalment payable on the 15th September, 1938. I hope that in the light of these explanations y and after G-hund Mishar Muhammad Ihsan Khan’s forthcoming discussion with the Air Ministry, you will be able to reply to the Secretary of State’s note of the 14th July, agreeing to the drafts proposed. I am sorry that we cannot meet you on the points which you raised, but you will realize that before even attempting to do so we should have to negotiate further with Messrs. Hawkers, and that this would involve a delay which, in view of the considerations set out in the fifth paragraph of the Secretary of State’s note of the 14th July, does not seem to be justified by the secondary importance of the points in question. 9IN0Eft£i ,^a.)

It is proposed for reasons of convenience to obtain the sums due from the Afghan Governnent on fixed dates which would be independent of the date of shipment. It is, however, not at present anticipated that the goods would be shipped by Hawker Aircraft Ltd. before October, and consequently, if the Afghan Government agree to the dates proposed for the payment of their instalments and to the amounts suggested, the Government of India should have received from the Afghan Government before shipment either the sum of Rs*l,37,96 , 6 or the sum of Rs.3,07,96^. 3. A payment of about £40,000 would be due from the Government of India to Hawker Aircraft Ltd. within 21 days of the shipment of the goods. This payment would be/1 be due independently of what sums have been previously received from the Afghan Government. Because of the uncertainty regarding the amount payable in respect payment is unlikely to be known until about the time when it is due, and the Government of India may therefore wish to give the High Commissioner for India authority to pay whatever sum is due under the contract to the Company. 4. Yfhen shipment has been effected a payment of not more than £5,000 would also be due to the Air Ministry in respect of the munitions to be sold direct by them to the Afghan Government. The reason for 1 this procedure is to avoid the possibility of Hawker Aircraft Ltd. makipg a oercentage of profit on these munitions in the event of their being sold through the Company. It is suggested that the High Commissioner for India might be authorised to make this payment to the Air Ministry instead of to Hawker Aircraft bo due Hawker Aircraft Ltd. before the end of April, 1938. of insurance, the exact total of this Ltd. 5.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your note No. 34 of the 30th March, regarding the proposed purchase by the Afghan Government of aircraft and connected equipment from Messrs. Hawkers Limited. The question of the employment of instructors in Afghanistan, referred to in your note No.159 of the 29th April has since been the subject of discussion between His Majesty's Minister at Kabul and your Government, and it is understood that the latter are ready to give the assurance on this question desired by His Majesty’s Government. 2. In these circumstances I enclose a copy of a draft letter from the British Air Ministry to Messrs. Hawkers Limited, which would form the main document of an agreement for the purchase of the equipment which, it is understood, the Afghan Government wish to buy. This draft has already been the subject of discussion between the Air Ministry and Ghund Mishar Muhammad Ihsan Khan. 3. A complementary agreement will be necessary between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India on the one hand and the Afghan Government on the other, for the resale to the latter of this equipment. I have the honour to/ Ali Mohammad Khan, etc., etc., etc .to suggest that this complementary agreement might suitably take the form of an Exchange of Notes between us, and to enclose the drafts of such Notes, 4o I shall be grateful if you can inform me whether your Government concur in the draft agreement between the Air Ministry and Messrs* Hav/kers Limited and whether they authorise you to exchange Notes in the form suggested. 5. Messrs. Hawkers Limited have pointed out that they cannot order from their sub-contractors the engines and the ancillary equipment required until their contract with the Air Ministry is signed; and they doubt whether, in view of the delay which has already occurred, they will now be able to obtain the prices or the delivery arrangements originally offered, unless they can place their orders immediately. Moreover, your Government will no doubt desire the aircraft to be erected at Kabul, if possible, before the winter renders conditions there more difficult. It is therefore desirable that the transaction should be / concluded with urgency, and I trust that you will be able to reply to this note at a very early date. In order to facilitate any references which you may wish to make by telegraph to your Government, His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul has been instructed to communicate to them for this purpose a copy of the drafts enclosed herein. 6. I would mention, in this connexion that, in the sixth paragraph of my note N 413/2/97 of the 1st February last, I had the honour to communicate to you an offer to sell/sell a few Wapiti aircraft. As I have received no reply to this offer, I assume that the Afghan Government do not wish to avail themselves thereof; and orders are accordingly being given for the disposal of the aircraft in question. I have the honour to be, with the highest consideration, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State)No. N 2107/2/97.

AIR MINISTRY. ADASTRAL HOUSE. KINGSWAV, W.C.2. $ July, 1937. Dear Rumbold, In reply to your letter P.2.4257/37 of the 1st instant, the following are our comments on the draft 1. We feel that the letters should be so worded that we receive (on paper at least) your authority to place the contract with Hawkers before we actually do so. To this end, it is suggested that the first para graph of our letter to you should be on the lines - 'I am commanded by the Air Council to refer to the negotiations that have been proceeding between Hawker Aircraft Ltd. and the Air^Ministry in consulta tion with the India Officejfor the purchase of goods for the Afghan Government and for the delivery at Kabul of these goods together with certain munitions to be supplied from Air Ministry stocks. The form of contract has now been agreed in accordance with the enclosed draft and I am to request that authority may be given for the contract to be issued. The list of munitions to be supplied from Air Ministry stocks is set but in Schedule IX of the draft” 2. There would be a corresponding alteration in your letter to us and it should also be amended by the deletion of 'there' in line 2 and the whole of lines 3, 4 and 5 and the substitution of 'issue vouchers and proof of shipment should be forwarded by the Air Minis try to the High Commissioner for India on despatch of the munitions. The vouchers should be for*,.,. * /l\s &gt;—4 H.A.F. Rumbold, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. /TheThe above rather cuts across paragraph 3 of your letter to Daniel but I hope you will be able to agree. Hawkers have now agreed the draft contract with the following alterations:- (a) Schedule II, Item 1 - the total should read £8201:12:0 not £8201:14:0. (b) Schedule II, Item 4 - the total should read £1270:2:4 and not £1280. (The total difference (reduction) is therefore only £9:19:8). (c) Last sentence of paragraph 1 of contract letter amend u ex-works' to read 'packed P.0.3. London'. (d) Schedule X - add 'excludes insurance charges payable under Clause 8(c) of contract 635821/37'. Yours sincerely.British Embassy, Copy (N 3344/2/97) No.539. Rome (150/ 2/37) 23rd June, 1937.

General Mohammed Ihsan arrived in Rome from Berlin on 17th June and departs for Holland on 25th June. He and the Afghan Minister in Rome dined with me last night. I learnt that the General is making a tour of foreign countries lasting 8 months. He has been in London several months and has seen something of British Aviation. During ais short stay in Italy he does not expect to see much of Aviation interest. He goes on to Holland and then to Germany where in both countries he will make enouiries about aeronautical material. The General received his flying training in Italy and speaks Italian well and^French fairly well. He is very fat and dour. Politically he is anti Russian from his conversation. He has no aircraft in his Air Force and I understand he has little or no money to buy any.' (Sgd.) G. B. Dacre. Group Captain, Air Attach**303b 1500 5.35 OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR INDIA.

The claim should also he accompanied hy a certificate that the stores have heen shipped.' I discussed the above amendment hy telephone with Boddis’s assistant and he saw no objection. 2. As regards the payment of the sum of £5&gt;000 or under which will he due to the Air Ministry, I think it most desirable that the Government of India should he informed at once of this proposed payment as it will mean that this sum will have to he recovered from the Afghan Government in addition to the difference between the payment to he made to Messrs. Hawkers and the sum which the Government of India are prepared to advance. I presume that you will notify the Government of India and ask them to authorise the High Commissioner to make the necessary payment to the Air Ministry. Will you kindly confirm this. H.A*F.

In respect of the munitions listed in the enclosure to your letter there will he paid to the Air Council hy the High Commissioner for India within x days of the shipment of the munitions, the sum of £5&gt;000 or such lesser sum as will cover the actual value of the munitions and the cost of their packing and delivery to Hawker Aircraft Ltd.■v ff 0 ** Under Secretary of State&gt; The negotiations with the Afghan Government for the sale of aircraft etc. have been held up since the end of April over the question of the employment by the Afghan Government of British air instructors. This has now been settled in principle by the Afghan Government’s acceptance of our stipulation that they should employ four instructors at a total cost of about £3&gt;125 per annum, and the way is therefore clear for us to proceed with conclusion of contracts for the sale of the aircraft etc. The proposed agreements are of a rather complicated nature and fall into a scheme v/hich is explained in my d. o. letter of 14th June to the Government of India (flagged). The draft agreement between Messrs. Hawkers and the Air Ministry, which is flagged, and the draft Exchange of Notes with the Afghan Minister (also flagged) have been vetted by Sir H.

I expect the firm will wish to keep this in if the ranges (I take it they are descriptive matter) are of importance. Schedule VI was omitted in error. I’m afraid the old clause 11 will have to stand. Clause 6 of A.M. Form 705 is, in Air Ministry contracts,qualified by our schedules and I wish to avoid any suggestion that by past practice we have relieved the contractor of his liabilities for royalty payments to patentees. I enclose a priced copy of Schedule IX. I've avoided individual prices as we don’t know what our packing and delivery charges will be. It follows that the priced vouchers when sent to India Store Department will probably be slightly less than £5,000* H.A.F.

L.C. June 19th. It is perhaps somewhat unusual for a contract of sale to be concluded by way of an exchange of notes and the wording ol the dralt is therefore in some respects not quite what we are accustomed to; but the substance (which . . is in any case more a matter for the Air Ministry and the India Office than for us) appears to be all right. Treaty Department may perhaps have some suggestions to make on questions of form. (Intd.) 21st June, 1937. The Treaty Department have, I believe, already 'vetted” the draft notes. In any case they seem to be in order from a purely formal aspect. It is not the first time/time, I tninK, that we have sold arms etc. to the Afghans under an agreement in the form of notes. (Sgd.) R.

Agreement has been reached in principle with the Afghan Government for the sale to them (on credit terms provided by the Government of India) of eight Hind aircraft with ancillary aviation equipment. The procedure contemplated for the conclusion of this transaction is - (a) an agreement between Messrs. Hawkers Ltd. and the Air Ministry, providing for the sale of the equipment to the latter. The draft of this agreement is at Flag A, It has been fully discussed between Messrs. Hawkers, the Air Ministry and the India Store Department, and is agreed between them. It has also been fully discussed between the Air Ministry and Muhammad Ihsan, and incorporates a number of amendments desired by him. One further amendment which we might suggest to Article 12 of this agreement is shown in pencil. (b) An Exchange of Notes between the Foreign Office and the Afghan Minister whereby H.M.G. and the Government of India jointly resell the equipment to the Afghan Government on the same terms and conditions (subject to necessary adaptations). The drafts of this Exchange of Notes *■£ at Flag^B. The form of the Foreign Office Note is that recommended by the Foreign Office and the substance (apart from the payment clauses v/hich are new) is agreed between the Air Ministry, the India Store Department and myself. (c) An official letter from the India Office to the Air Ministry in v/hich the Secretary of State for India would give the Air Ministry an indemnity against all claims arising out of their contract with Messrs. Hawkers, and possibly a reply from the Air Ministry agreeing/agreeing to the handing over of the equipment from themselves to H.M.G. and the Government of India jointly. This indemnity is a necessary corollary of the Air Ministry's agreement to he the contracting party with Messrs. Hawkers in deference to Afghan susceptibilities, as we cannot leave the Air Ministry with the baby, even ah academic one. I should have realised this when we agreed ‘ to the Air Ministry contracting with Hawkers. I doubt, however, whether it involves us in additional obligations. We are covered on paper by the Exchange oi Notes with the ^ Afghan Minister, and, as I read the Hawkers-Air Ministry contract, the only obligation assumed by the latter is to accept the equipment at the high prices quoted. If the Afghan Government refused to accept delivery we would have to Dear the loss; but we would probably have had to do that even if Hawkers were contracting direct with the Afghans, because it would not have oeen worth Hav/ker s while to undertake the contract without a guarantee by us of Afghan credit. I presume our letter to the Air Ministry will have to be submitted in draft to the Secretary of State's Advisers, but we cannot do this until the Air Ministry—Hawkers agreement and the iiixchange of Notes with the Afghan Minister are finally agreed in draft. As the letter is a formality, I suggest that we need not consult the Government of India. 2. Once the terms of the Air Ministry-Hawkers contract and the Exchange of Notes with the Afghan Minister are agreed between the interested departments, we might send an official Note to the Afghan Minister, forwarding the documents in draft, and seeking his written concurrence in them. A draft is flagged C. 3. One question of substantial importance remains at issue with the Afghans and is holding up further progress at present. The Government of India contemplated that some /Minute Paper Department 531‘Jb 5000 10 30 proposed/ P.Z s/s 2176/37 tel. of 13th April P.Z.2537/37 P.Z.2881/37 some of the Afghan Hinds would be used at Karachi to complete the training of the Afghan pilots and mechanics to be sent there. The reasons for this proposal were to reduce the chances of Afghan pilots crashing the Government of India's machines and to ensure that the students we train will be competent, when we have finished with them, to fly and look after Hinds, of which type none exist at present in India. The Afghans are, however, anxious to exploit the propaganda value of the simultaneous arrival in Kabul of eight Hinds, together v/ith their necessary equipment, and have flatly refused to agree to the Government of India's proposal. The Government of India have therefore agreed, at our suggestion, to allow all the Hinds to be delivered by Hawkers direct to Kabul in one consignment, on the assumption that the Afghan Government will entertain there a party of British instructors (most of whom would be found by Hawkers). The Afghan Minister was accordingly informed in Foreign Office Note of 27th April that we cannot settle the articles in the contract between the Air Ministry and Hawkers providing for delivery at Kabul until he informs us that the Afghan Government, having taken into consideration the rough estimate of the cost to them of the employment of British air instructors, have decided to employ them. The point has been referred by the Afghan Minister to his Government, and we are awaiting their reply. Meanwhile we are considering with the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office to what extent we should make the sale of aircraft etc. dependent upon the employment of British instructors at Kabul. 4. I v/ould be grateful if you would examine ther proposed draft agreements, and say what amendments you think desirable, on the assumption that the points referred to in para.3 above will shortly be resolved. The Financial Secretary will observe that it is ! proposed to make payments to Hawkers in sterling and tcj accept instalments from the Afghan Government in Indian rupees over a period of years. The agreements are rather complicated and I would be happy to explain ] further any passages in them regarding which you are j doubtful - I ^ 7 ^ 37 . 0&gt;r X\-yr^ Jr ii l I&lt;s Minute Paper.

I do not know of any provision in the Government of India Act 1935 rendering the concurrence of the Advisers of the Secretary of State obligatory. The rules made under S.278(7) do not provide that a matter of this nature is one upon which the Secretary of State desires the advice of the Advisers under S.278(1). 4. The contract is neither F.O.B. or C.I.F. An F.Q.B. contract is one in which the purchaser himself arranges and pays for the insurance and freight, and the goods are at the risk of the purchaser from the moment of delivery on board. A C.I.F. contract is one in which the purchaser pays a price intended to cover the freight and insurance, and the seller himself arranges the carriage and insurance of the goods, the rise or fall in the freight and insurance markets being on the seller. 5.

H0G3 Wt 9696/P 28 5000 4.37 IOP I am rather doubtful about some of the amendmentssuggested by Mr. Norman and have suggested some others shown in pencil on his redraft. Many of them are returns to the Air Ministry draft. Clause 4. The purpose of this clause is to provide for lettering to be done v/ith Persian, instead of English, characters. It will be necessary to mark only certain items among the equipment. Clause 6 . Here again it might be a mistake to be too precise as to what is to be flown at Brooklands. The flights would take place in the course of the Air Ministry inspection provided for in clause 3. Clause 7 et se q. I have tried to avoid the cumbrous phrase 'equipment and articles' which might lead to obscurity in clauses where only one of these two words 1 are used. I think all articles can be described as 'equipment'. Clause 8 (c). The purpose of the insurance provision is that if the market rates against war risks or civil commotion in India risks rise materially the ox- ^WCCoo^ Covernment of India!could assume liability against such risks themselves. They^and H.M.Government would then take steps to protect the equipment en route to Afghanistan. Clause 9. Payment would be made by the High Commissioner for India. Do you see any objection to my modifications and have you any other comments?INDIA OFFICE, ?. 2. 3698/37. WHITEHALL, S.W. 1.

If Hawkers were to be discharged from all liability during the voyage, difficulties might arise in respect of their re-assumption of liability during the period in which the aircraft are being erected and handed over at Kabul. The Afghan Government might object to assuming liability during the voyage, and It Is essential so to draft the contracts that all liabilities taken over by the Air Ministry from Hawkers are at the same moment transferred/. pi 3. transferred to tne shoulders of the Afghan Government.

We cannot be certain that you will have available on 1st April the money necessary for the payment of the second instalment to Hawkers. The Government of India have agreed to provide the necessary funds in the month of April, and the High Commissioner will therefore probably like to have until the end of the month to complete payment.

Afghan Minister was informed as in the Government of India’s telegram Ho.1015 of 16th April and was ashed whether the Afghan Government, having considered our offer of British instructors ana their approximate cost, nave decided m principle to engage them. He was told that pending the receipt of his reply it is impossible to s ettle the place of delivery for aviation equipment. He has replied protesting against the contract for the sale of equipment being thus made dependent upon the employment of British instructors and is referring to his Government for orders. 2. 1 suspect Minister of bluffing (as we now have reason to believe he was in insisting on credit for more than £45,000). He is of course misrepresenting what he was told; and it would seem desirable not to leave Afghan Government under impression that T vve have aimed throughout at employment of British instructors at Kabul. you have therefore discretion, subject to considerations in following paragraphs, to point out that both offer to sell aircraft and that to supply instructors arose from enquiries by Afghan Government, c.nd that it was only when the Afghan Government objected to employment of their machines at Karachi that we stipulated for employment of British instructors at Kabul. He want to secure that Afghans will in fact be able to fly and maintain our Hinds, and for this it is obvious that British training on them must be provided somewhere. 3. WQ have always been aware that Afghan Government might buy part of their requirements abroad (your telegram Ho./£5 2 , No.76 of 2nd September). As the Government of India know, there is now reason to believe that Aiih'^n Government hope to buy eight Italian aeroplanes of latest model and sixteen, or failing that eight, German aeroplanes. If they make these purchases, both Italy and Germany would presumably wish to send air missions to Afghanistan to teach Afghans to fly and maintain the machines. inis prospect seems to emphasise importance of our requirement that British instructors should go to Kabul as otherwise field might be left clear for Italians and Germans. But I should be glad of your views on the risk that the presence in Kabul of instructors from rival countries, including our own, might result in friction and conflicting advice (thus embarrassing the position of the British instructors) and conceivably in opportunities for sabotage of British machines. 4. Subject to your views on this point, it seems best for the reason indicated above to make the employment of British instructors a condition of the sale of British aircraft, at any rate if Italian or German instructors are employed. I suppose that if we went further than this and suggested to the Afghan Government that if we sell any British aircraft, they should undertake not to employ German or Italian instructors in their Air Force, the Afghan Government would be likely to react badly to such a proposal as an attempted interference m their own affairs. But I should be glad of your views on this also.P.Z.3010/37* 1 f E1TCL0SUPE IN FOREIGN OFFICE COVERING LETTER ' \ DATED 3RD MAY, 195?. Copy (I'l 2346/2/97) Ho. 159 . Afghanistan Legation, 31&gt; Princes Gate, S • W. 7 • 29th April, 1937. Sir, I have the honour of acknowledging the receipt of a letter ^;o* I:. 2174/2/97 dated the 27 th April, 1937; and in the first instance wish to express my thanks for the consideration of the Government of India for agreeing not to retain any aircrafts for training Afghan students at Karachi, hut have the delivery of all material to he made direct to Kabul. In regards to the paragraph 3 of your letter, I may he permitted to observe that in all of my discussions, I had understood that the contract for the purchase of aircraft and material was not subject to any condition of employment of the British instructors; hut the purchasing of the aforementioned i-ems was considered as a separate objective. But our letter makes it clear that the agreement for employing the instructors is now thought to he the first and tiie more important factor than the actual contract for buying of the material. Since, however, this is the decision of the Air Ministry, I have nothing to say hut to inform the ' concerned at Kabul of the full details, and, shall, of cour se, communicate to you their reply upon the receipt of it. With the assurance, etc. (Sd) Ali Mohammad. Bis Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, S. W. 1. Afghan Minister.I P.Z.2881/37. No.N 2174/2/97. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 27th April, 1937. Sir, In the course of an interview here on the 12th April you requested that the aircraft material which the Afghan Government propose to purchase in this country might he delivered direct to Kabul, instead of part of it being used at Karachi for the training of Afghan pilots and mechanics. You explained that the Afghan Government contemplated that after these students had been trained on Wapitis, Harts or Audax machines at Karachi they would be transferred to Hinds at Kabul by the British instructors who, as you have been informed, can be made available for that purpose. 2. I now have the honour to inform you that the Government of India have been consulted on this point and agree that all the material which the Afghan Government are purchasing here may be sent by Messrs. Hawkers direct to Kabul and should not be used for training purposes at Karachi, on the assumption that British instructors are employed at Kabul* The purpose of their original proposal was to ensure that the Afghan students would receive satisfactory training on Hind aircraft, none of which type exists in India; and this point will be met if personnel acquainted with Hinds are engaged to instruct these students at Kabul. It has been ascertained that personnel made available by Messrs. Hawkers on the lines described in the fifth paragraph of my note N.1637/2/97 of the 25th March last would probably require remuneration on a similar scale to that necessary in the case of serving Royal Air Force personnel. An estimate of the cost to the Afghan Government of employing the latter was given in the fourth paragraph of my note N.531/2/97 of the 1st February last. Ali Mohammad Khan, etc•, etc • f etc. 3./m 3. In these circumstances, and as the engagement of British instructors would be to the great advantage of the Afghan O-overnment, I hope that you will be able to inform me at a very early date whether the Afghan Government, having considered the offer made to them, and the approximate cost to them of British instructors, have decided in principle to engage such instructors, as, pending the receipt of your reply on this point, it will not be possible to settle the wording of the clause in the draft contract between Messrs. Hawkers and the Air Ministry regarding the delivery of the material. 4. In my note of the 1st February it was suggested that one instructor in signals and aerological duties together would suffice for the requirements of the Afghan Government. The Air Ministry advise me that in view of the small number of aircraft which will be at Kabul, one instructor should be able oo carry out both duties; but if the Afghan Government wish to have two instructors, one for signalling and one for meteorological work, the Air Ministry will be willing to try to obtain them from among serving personnel of the Royal Air Force. 5. The Government of India are not yet in a position to fix a date for the beginning of training at Karachi. In any case, however, on account of the arrangements which must be made, they could not receive the students before the latter half of May. I have, etc., (Sgd.)

Dear Rumbold, ** ^ ' ''of I regret that there are several errors in the draft contract I sent to you yesterday. Clause 2 should read: Clause 5 last line should read 8 # h. Clause 12 . Reference should be to ’’High Commissi oner”. The second sentence now grouped under (b) should, of course, be a separate paragraph altogether. I should perhaps also say in connection with clause 9, that the prices we shall charge India Store Department for the guns, etc. in Schedule IX will also exclude any duties and you may wish to cover this in your agreement with the Afghans. ’’The aeroplanes to be supplied shall be identical with those now being supplied to the Air Ministry except ...

Dear Rumbold, Y&gt;/Y -/37 Enclosed is a revised draft of the Afghan Hind Contract in triplicate. The following are the revisions of the previous draft and the reasons for them:- Clause 1. Schedule III altered to exclude Air Ministry supplies now in Schedule IX. Clause 7. A new clause to cover Air Ministry supplies in Schedule IX. Clause 8 b. - previously clause 7b. Hawlcers - reasonably I think - have asked for cover against the possibility of the Afghans delaying handing over. As a working definition, 14 days from the arrival of the consignment in Kabul is reasonable. Clause 8 c. - previously clause 7c. Conforming to the revision of 8 b. Clause 8 H - previously clause 7d. Addition has been made to cater for the possibility of a revision of the contract to F.O.B. English port instead of C.I.F. Kabul, and as discussed on Saturday last. Clause 8 e - previously clause 7e. Revised as discussed on Saturday last. Clause 9. - previously clause 8 . Revised to conform to new clause 7. Clause 12 - previously clause II. Hawkers object to the revision discussed on Saturday last because they say ( 1 ) the essence of the arrangements that they made with the Afghans was payment against F.O.B. delivery and they are not prepared to modify the principle involved. H. A. F. Rumbold, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. /1 2 )( 2 ) they would be too much in the hands of the Afghans. As to (1). I can't argue but I do know that it is usual in contracts’ made by our aircraft firms with foreign governments for payment to be on F.O.B. delivery. point of view. In any case, I think we are adequately safe guarded by Clause 12b. as by any normal definition payment cannot be due for equipment not satisfactorily delivered. I've spoken to Daniels who is satisfied if you are. Clause 13 - previously clause 12 . Revised as discussed on Saturday last. «7ould you let me know as soon as possible whether this is now clear so that I can get a formal tender from Hawkers and prepare the contract documents. I'm sending a copy of this letter and the draft to Burrows and to Daniels.

Runhold, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.1 ^ - fU- ~y179b 1500 3.35 OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR INDIA. Telegraphic Address — Indiamen, Lamb, London. Telephone— Waterloo 5851 Ext.226 Ref. S.5504/36/23 M.D. India Store Department, Belvedere Road, London, S.E. 1. 23rd April 1 937 . With reference to your letter PZ.2552/37 dated the 17th April 1937 regarding the supply of aviation equipment for the Afghan Government, I have the following observations to offer. 2 * Firstly as regards the draft of the note from the Foreign Office to the Afghan Minister, I notice that, while you have suggested to Darvall that the Air Ministry should not he described as acting as the agent of the Afghan Government, the Director of Contracts is so described in the opening sentence of the note. ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of the note appear to me to be somewhat indefinite. 1 H-A.F. Rumbold, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W .1 I presume that in (1) the 'conditions' refer to the quality and suitability of the stores and if so, I would suggest that the words 'as regards quality and suitability' should be inserted after the word 'conditions'. In the case of (2), 1 presume that the 'conditions' refer to the standards of inspection and if this is correct I would suggest the insertion of the words 'as regards standards of inspection' after the word 'conditions'. 3* Secondly, with reference to the contract between the Air Ministry and Hawkers Clause 5 « I presume that the importation duties or taxes referred to relate to those in Afghanistan and/or India and that you have suggested the omission of this clause. As the contract provides for delivery of the stores/(Uu 7 {&amp;) at Kabul it seems desirable that there should be a clause in the contract making it clear whether the price quoted by Hawkers is inclusive or exclusive of any importation duties or taxes in Afghanistan and/or India. Unless Hawkers have an agent in India and Afghanistan it will probably be very difficult for them to take delivery in Afghanistan and pay any importation duties or taxes. It might be preferable for Hawkers' quotation to provide for delivery say c.i.f. Karachi and for a representative of the Afghan Government to take delivery there and arrange for onward despatch to Kabul. Perhaps the Afghan Minister would be in the best position to advise on this point. Clause 8 . I would suggest that the opening sentence be re-worded as follows 'The supplier will be held responsible for the stores being sufficiently and properly packed so as to ensure their being free from loss or injury on arrival at their destination overseas.' Clause 9 . In my copy of the draft the words 'Buyer at Kabul' towards the end of the opening sentence have been deleted. It was apparently intended to delete the words 'of the Buyer' and to leave in the words 'at Kabul'. Unless the Government are prepared to shoulder the risk of any loss I would suggest the omission of the words 'endeavour to' at the beginning of the second sentence, and that the third sentence should read as follows 'The quotation at Schedule X is only in respect of normal insurance and does not include any sums in respect of special war risks'. If the above amendments are accepted the references to insurance should be deleted from the remainder of this clause. Clause 10 . I would suggest that this clause be re drafted as follows Payment/- 3 - (*') ^Payment in sterling for the stores as shipped v/ill be made to the supplier by the High Commissioner for India, at the rate of 50^4 of the price agreed on, within 21 days after shipment and production by the supplier of the Bill of Lading. The remaining 50^&gt; will be paid by the above officer on receipt of a certificate from the consignee that the stores have been received in good condition, have been erected as necessary and are satisfactory, but not before the 1st April 1938* u h* I would also suggest the inclusion of a condition on the following lines A written guarantee is to be given that, in the event of any store being found damaged on arrival in consequence of faulty packing, or defective when in use, the supplier will replace the damaged or defective part or parts thereof free of charge. He will also replace free of charge any stores found missing on receipt of the consignment at destination. 5« If the contract is made c.i.f. there should also be a clause providing for the despatch of a Bill of Lading made out in favour of a responsible officer of the Afghan Government. The Afghan Minister will, no doubt, advise as to this. 6. Will you kindly ask the Air Ministry to supply us in due course with 4 copies of the contract placed with Hawkers and to furnish us promptly with a certificate that the stores shipped have been inspected and approved and are in accordance with the terms of the contract. 7. Finally, if it is decided that Hawsers * quotation is to be exclusive of import duties or taxes, it/k it would be as well to include in the Foreign Office note to the Afghan Minister a clause to the effect that all Afghan import duties or taxes on the stores are to be borne by the Afghan Government and to make the position clear as regards any Indian import duties or taxes.m \ * AIR MINISTRY, ADASTRAL HOUSE. KINGSWAY. W.C.2. 635821/37/0.4. ll_April, 1937. ~v Hinds for Afghanistan, Dear Rumbold, Enclosed is a draft of the contract we propose to place with Hawkers. The particular points arising so far as I am concerned are:- d) C. ^ &amp;A' Guns, ammunition, etc, in Schedule III. We should prefer to include in this contract only the shipping hy Hawkers. This would mean that we charge India Store Department direct for them. The alternative is — - to charge Hawkers and while they may he prepared to pass on the amount without addition, the terms of ( 8 ) ■y-e H/* ' OOLS-cct payment render any suggestion that they should, a little difficult. On the other hand, I understand that the Afghans have already had a price given to them-hy whom I cannot say. We shall want from you (a) (*) - V: \ (C) (Xyy ciy.'^cacV confirmation that the equipment listed is what is required. I have the verbal assurance of the Afghans hut that is hardly sufficient, an indemnity against any claims arising. (Your note of 17th April to Darvall covers this), an assurance that the interpretation of the contract between Air Ministry and Hawkers is completely in our hands. H.A.P. Rumbold, Esq., India Office, WHITEHALL, S.W.l.•Ml (3) A (4) Mv' x D^-vOaU - 2 - The Afghans want 50 maps, scale 4 miles to the inch, and to a sample already seen. Darvall tells me the Government of India must supply and they are accordingly not referred to in this contract, presumably it will he simple for you to add them in your or the Foreign Office agreement with the Afghans. The original draft you were given included a hangar at Schedule IJ£. The Afghans want further time so as to consider additional tenders which Hawkers are to get and the item is accordingly left out for the present. The engine takes a type of fuel which I understand is not normally used either in India or Afghanistan. I understand Daryall has advised the Afghans hut it might he as weir^t^T^mphasize the point as Hawkers can’t he held liable if proper fuel isn’t available. (6) Clause (12) is a stop gap only until India Store Department say what they want. This, of course, does not refer to the dates when payment is due or the amounts then payable. I should add that clause 7(a) of the draft is almost pure Afghan and represents as far as I can make out a face-saving attempt to get round Hawkers’ very reasonable refusal to give an unqualified guarantee. Yours sincerely. ( 5 ) I *Gentlemen, ^ I am directed to inform you that your tender of the for the supply of eight Hind aeroplanes with airframe and engine spares, aerodrone and workshop equipment, armament and ammunition, to the Afghan Government is hereby accepted in accordance with the following terms and conditions:- (1) The equipment to be supplied and the prices to be paid are listed in the following schedules.

We had a meeting this morning with Mohammad im. san and representatives of Messrs. Hawkers regarding the final clauses in the contract as between Messrs. Hawkers and the Air Ministry. After a discussion lasting for about 2j hours a deadlock was reached regarding the inclusion of the clause dealing with the guarantee of delivery in Kabul by a certain date. The Afghan representatives were insistent that a specific clause should be inserted, guaranteeing the delivery of their entire order in Kabul within a time to be specified by Hawkers,but as short as possible,and having a direct bearing on the period of four months previously mentioned in discussions between the Afghan Minister ©■£ the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry. Messrs. Hawkers, on the other hand, were only prepared to go as far as saying that they would use their utmost endeavours to deliver by a certain date. From our part, we could only agree with Messrs. Hawkers that, short of force majeure, there are a large number of factors which might conceivably prevent Messrs. Hawkers fulfilling the contract within a specified date. We explained to the Afghans that at the present time no firm in England would be able to give an unqualified guarantee of this kind and that the Air Ministry themselves did not include a clause of this kind in their normal contracts with firms. H.A.F.Rumbold Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. /WeWe were unable to produce any formula which would satisfy both theOf&lt;jW*Jand Messrs. Hawkers, whose attitude was entirely reasonable, and we had to leave the matter unagreed. The Afghans stated that they would consider this matter further but would probably telegraph to ^ Kabul tomorrow, asking for instructions f rom their Government regarding the guarantee. We think it would be very advisable on our part to signal Fraser-Tytler at Kabul, explaining the situation and asking him to explain our position to the Afghan Government. I have accordingly drafted a tentative telegram on the lines of which we would be grateful if Fraser-Tytler could be telegraphed. We want to make it quite clear that it is not in any sense lack of will on the part of the Air Ministry and Hawkers that a hard and fast guarantee could not be given and that it is probable 100-1 that the contract will be fulfilled within the time stated, i.e. 5i months, but there are so many sub-contracting parties within and without the Air Ministry and Messrs. Hawkers, of which no one department or person has adequate control that an unqualified guarantee is really not a practical thing at all. Muhammad Iluban further referred to the question of training in Karachi and in particular to the training of the two observers and wireless mechanics to which we have referred before. So far as I remember, you have written to the Government of India about this matter, telling them that you will take it up specifically, when it was probable that the contract would be signed in a few days. Perhaps you would now be so good as to telegraph to the Government of India specifically on this point, asking them when they will be prepared to undertake the training of these four people. Muhammad Ih^san said that if it was the question of difficulty in training the numbers required, he would be, if necessary, prepared to reduce the numbers of pilots and mechanics by two each, in order to obtain training for the two observers and two radio-mechanics. I promised to let him have an answer to this as soon as possible. /RegardingT7&lt; Regarding the question of the contract as “between you and the Afghan Government, I suggest that when you have had the comments of the Indian Stores Department you might agree to telephone Mr. Boddis in Contracts Department and have a meeting to settle details.'5-7/ &amp;tfi( DRAFT TELEGRAM .

The Air Ministry explained that Hawkers are quite reasonable in refusing an unqualified guarantee owing to the large number of sub-contractors, including the Air Ministry Departments themselves, included within Hawkers contract. They pointed out that although in all human probability the contract would be fulfilled within the 5-g- months, there were possibilities, short of force majeure, which might cause delay and that a qualified guarantee was all that they themselves would require in similar circumstances and was all that any contractor in the United Kingdom would be able to provide at the present time. Perhaps you could explain to the Afghan Government who will be receiving information on this point from the Afghan Minister in London that the non-inclusion of a specific guarantee clause is not due to any lack of good will or intention on the part of the firms and Ministry eiiUifrfi w&lt;» are just as anxious as they for the satisfactory completion of the contract.^) Af ghaM'Otant*(COPIES CIRCULATED AND TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE) DEC V P H E R Q ..f. .T-g-L ii ft R AJL From His Majesty's Minister at Kabul to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, India Office.

I enclose a copy of this draft contract showing some amendments which I would be grateful if the Air Ministry would consider. Some of the amendments I suggest have probably already been made in the course of the discussions between the Air Ministry and Muhammad Ihsan; others are designed to fit in the Air Ministry Hawkers contract with the connected proposed exchange of letters between the Foreign Office and the Afghan Minister in London. in the Air Ministry Hawkers contract the Air Ministry should not be described as acting as the agent of the Afghan Government. Fly understanding of the procedure we contemplate is that the Air Ministry would be covered in respect of the obligations they enter into towards Hawkers The most important alteration I suggest is that Squadron Leader L. Darvall, M.C., Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway, W.0.2. (a) /2 . (a) by an official letter from the India Office indemnifying them against any claims arising out of their contract with Hawkers; and (b) by an Exchange of Notes between the Foreign Office and the Afghan Minister under which the obligations and rights assumed by the Air Ministry in their contract with Hawkers would be passed on to the Afghan Government, thus enabling the India Office to give the Air Ministry the indemnity suggested above. In any case, as I understand it, the Air Ministry would be acting not as the agent of the Afghan Government but as the agent of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, who in their turn are reselling the material to the Afghan Government. A description of the Air Ministry in the Air Ministry Hawkers contract as acting as the agent of the Afghan Government would make the drafting of the Exchange of Notes with the Afghan Minister very difficult and perhaps impossible. I enclose the draft of a note from the Foreign Office to the Afghan Minister. I would be grateful if you could let me have as soon as possible the observations of the Air Ministry on this draft which is very tentative. Neither /3.

Dear Kvans, We have, as you know, been corresponding with Darvall for some time about the purchase of British aircraft by the Afghan Government, and I m now writing to say how important we consider it that tht draft contract for the sale of these aircraft by Hawkers should be prepared within the shortest possible time. The transaction was agreed in principle between us and the Afghan Minister by the Slst March, and he rather naturally cannot understand why it should have taken so long to put t its agreeme nt into writing. The Minister spoke with some force on this subject when he called here on the 12th April, te tried to pacify him by pointing out the large amount of detail which had to be incorporated in the contract and the preoccupation of your Contracts Department with our own/* (stt) f\Cmraaa«nt prograa if?* but he reiterated that hie Government were extremely anxious to conclude this buelness urgently# and th.t tht Afghan order, though ai,all in amount, had quite dispi'oportionate political significance. Muhammad Ihsan was due to leave soon for Berlin in any case and he really could not delay h&lt;ire much longer. The Minister himself hid also to go to the Continent on other business and he would therefore be obliged if we could at the very least give him some quite definite date by which th* contract wool I be ready for signature in order that he might make his plans accordingly. at share the Minister's views of the political importance of this transaction and shall be very grateful if you will do all that you can to secure the completion of the contract as a matter of particular urgency.

Ar n ' Minute Paper. political Department. I Le^al Adviser , I would be grateful for your advice in the following matter. Agreement has recently been reached in principle with the Afghan Government whereby the purchase by them from Messrs. Hawker Ltd. of aircraft and ancillary equipment to the value of about £80,000 is being facilitated by a credit provided by the Government of India. The Afghan Government, for reasons which are not very clear, refused to contract direct with Messrs. Hawkers, and the following procedure was therefore agreed upon:^ (a) There will be a contract between Messrs. Hawkers and the Air Ministry (acting as the agent of the Afghan Government) for the purchase of the material by the latter. This contract will provide that payments due under it to Messrs. Hawkers will be paid to them by the oA-VccW^ India Store Department, and Article 10 of the q^oIo&amp;» 4 preliminary draft of this contract will require amendment to provide for this. (b) An exchange of lottcnps between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India on the one hand and the Afghan Government on the other provide for the resale of the material to the Afghan Government. (c) An official letter from the India Office to the Air Ministry indemnifying the Air Ministry against any claims arising out of their contract with Messrs. Hawkers. 2. I attach (1) a preliminary draft of the contract between the Air Ministry and Messrs. Hawkers. A number of amendments have been made in this contract of which we shall be notified shortly. At present I think we need consider it only in so far as it affects (2) a draft Note from the Foreign Office to the Afghan Minister.3. I should be grateful if you would consider the form of this latter draft and say whether an agreement of the type therein indicated would enable us to indemnify the Air Ministry against claims arising out of their contract with Messrs. Hawkers. 4. I shall, if I may, refer the papers to you again when both the draft contract and the draft exchange of Notes are rather nearer to their final form. ^ w_c.la.u- Cs 'Cc-Lilo- ^ a . WWbl . I have amended the draft letter as shown in pencil. I do not think the letter has any effect on an indemnity being given by or on behalf of the Governor-General in Council. Such an indemnity would appear to be a matter of external affairs and falls within the executive authority of the Governor-General in Council under 3.313 of the Government of India Act 1935. If the Secretary of State gives such an indemnity, it will be necessary for him to have had the authority of the Governor-General in Council.

Lr~ The Afghan T^inister. / / / I have the honour to enclose a copy of a contract which has been signed this day between the Director of Contracts of the British Air Ministry, ^ r as the agent of the Afghan Government, and Hawker Aircraft Ltd. for the sale of eight Hind type aircraft and other aviation equipment. In this connection ■SVaU ' uTilA I be glad if you wouBd confirm that agreement has been reached between myself, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India, and yourself, on behalf of the Afghan Government, on the following points:- (1) H.M.G. and the G. of I. undertake that the materials specified in the contract between the British Air Ministry and Hawker Aircraft Ltd. will be supplied to the Afghan Government on &lt; L „ . . conditions as they are supplied to the British Air Ministry by Hawker Aircraft Ltd. (2) The Afghan Government undertake to accept the materials specified in the contract between the British Air Ministry and Hawker Aircraft Ltd. on cond i t ions^*e they are supplied to the British Air Ministry by Hawker Aircraft Ltd. (3) If Hawker Aircraft Ltd. under the terms of Article 3 of their contract wi th/with the Air Ministry increase any of their Quotations you will 'be notified as soon as possible. If within 14 days of such a notification to you, you inform me that the Afghan Government wish to cancel the supply of any of the materials the prices of which have been raised, their supply will be cancelled. (4) In the event of a dispute arising regarding the interpretation or execution of this Agreement, the dispute shall be submitted to a Committee of three persons sitting in London, of whan one will be nominated by the Afghan Government , one by Hawker Aircraft Ltd. and one by the British Air Ministry. The recommendations of the majority of this Committee will be accepted as binding. (5) Payment clauses. These cannot be drafted until we know the total value of the contract between the Air Ministry and Hawkers. Their outline is that the Afghan Government will pay to the Government of India (a) about £5,000 in x number of days after the date on which this Exchange of Notes takes place; (b) £12,500 (possibly in several portions) on shipment from this country of the material; (c) £12,500 on same date in the spring of 1938, and (d) four further | instalments, each of £12,500, at intervals of one year thereafter.9, Th« Sur^lUr will aaif wry to dwliver the to tsrtchi within five aonthe from tho of this jt t and will unlei?® difficulties beyond hie control eriee, deliver the ^ateri^le in one consignfsent to the aerodrome Buyer at Kabul within a reasonable time thereafter.

Gypiier telegram from Secretary of State for India, to Government of India, External Affairs Department, repeated to H.M. Minister, Kabul. Dated 13th April, 1937. (Number of words 169). SECRET. XIX 1201 . Addressed by Secretary of State for India to Government of India, repeated to Kabul No. 40. My telegram No. 1040 of 25th March. Muhammad Ihsan refuses to consider employment of his own Hinds at Karachi in training scheme, and contemplates that after training on your machines at Karachi his pilots and mechanics would be converted to Hinds at Kabul, under instructors whom Hawkers are ready to send there on payment. He points out difficulty of providing spares for Hinds or repairing them at Karachi. Afghan Minister at interview at Foreign Office on 12th April said that his Government insisted on aircraft being sent direct to Kabul otherwise Afghan people would not understand why the squadron did not arrive unused and complete. 2. I doubt whether Afghan Government will give way on this point on account of propaganda considerations. Also acceptance of Muhammad Ihsan 1 s suggestion would presumably influence Afghan Government to accept offer contained in paragraph 5 of Foreign Office note ox 25th March (copy by secret air mail of 29th March) which has been referred to Kabul by Afghan Minister. Moreover difficult problem might arise if Afghan machine was damaged at Karachi e.g. by British pilot. Do you agree that we should accept Afghan suggestion on assumption that British instructors are employed at Kabul? 3. Afghan Minister is anxious for training at Karachi to start as soon as possible. What date do you propose if we accept Afghan suggestion?”7^— l setter Telegram from SECRET. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT Dated Hec. 19 Formally acknowledged Date. Initials. SUBJECT.

This includes a deal for a supply of munitions from Air Ministry stocks. A number of drafts of this contract can be found throughout the file; the contracts include detailed schedules listing and pricing the equipment desired by the Afghan Government. Supplementary correspondence related to the dispatch of British instructors to Kabul, the financing of the purchase by the Government of India, and the provision of aviation training in India for the Afghan Air Force, has also been included.The subsequent process of shipping the aircraft and associated equipment from England to Kabul via Karachi towards the end of 1937/early 1938 is also partially documented by the correspondence, as are the associated customs delays at Karachi. Furthermore, the file includes correspondence recording repayments made by the Afghan Government to the Government of India. This includes the payment of an insurance claim resulting from damage to the aircraft during shipment to Kabul.Extracts from various reports have also been filed within, they generally report on the Afghan Air Force. This includes reports of flights made using the aforementioned Hinds, accidents and damaged incurred to aircraft, and use of aircraft in military action.The main correspondents in the file are as follows: HM Minister at Kabul (William Kerr Fraser-Tytler), the Counsellor at the Kabul Legation (Arthur Ernest Henry Macann), officials of the Air Ministry, officials of the Foreign Office, officials of the India Office, and representatives of the External Affairs Department of the Government of India. A small amount of correspondence with the Collector of Customs at Karachi, R &amp; J Park Limited, and Eastern Express Limited, can also be found within.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Afghan Air Force</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Hawker Aircraft Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Counsellor, British Legation, Kabul</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Military aircraft</topic></subject><subject><topic>Hawker Hind (Bomber)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Contracts</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Afghanistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kabul</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Arms sales</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000223#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
