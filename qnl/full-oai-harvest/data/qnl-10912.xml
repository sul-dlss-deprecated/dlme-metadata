The memorandum states that there had been no correspondence between the two departments since 1870. It concludes by stating that the British Government had recognised the expediency of granting the Shah of Persia's request (for the appointment of officers); that a difficulty arose from the question of whether the cost of paying the officers should be borne by the India Office, the Foreign Office, or the Shah's own  Government; and that questions had arisen concerning the effect of such a  measure on the political relations between Persia and Russia.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Military training</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000041#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
