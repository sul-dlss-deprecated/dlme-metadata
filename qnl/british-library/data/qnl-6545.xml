May 5, 1881. CONFIDENTIAL. (4439.) Mr. Gosclien, No. 13, Commercial; Marcli 7,1881. Memorandum respecting the Claim of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam-ship Com pany to use Barges on those Rivers as a matter of ' right!' Lord Ponsonby, No. 1; January 12, 1835. Confidential Paper No. 2460. THE following are the circumstances under which British steam-vessels were first allowed to navigate those rivers. In 1834 Lord Ponsonby, then Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, was directed to obtain from the Porte permmion for English steamers to navigate the River Euphrates for the purposes of commerce ; and, after some opposition, the necessary Firman was granted for two steam-vessels to navigate that river, under certain conditions. The Euphrates and Tigris Company was not then in existence. Those conditions were thus described in the Firman of the 29th December, 1834. After stating that the British Government had asked permission for two steamers to be allowed to navigate the River Euphrates, the Firman said :— C'est pourquoi nous avons permis et permettons &amp; deux batiments a vapeur de naviguer sur 1'Euphrate, tour a tour, et cette navigation doit continuer autant que, conformement a ce qui nous a etc represente, elle sera utile aux deux Parties, et quil n'en resultera aucun inconvenient; et c'est dans ce sens qu'une note officielle a ete remise a I'Ambassade Britannique. This Firman, it will be observed, did not concede ,o British subjects generally, or to the Euphrates and Tigris Company, the permanent and uncon ditional right to navigate the river; but simply oranted permission to the British Government to [668]place two steam -vessels on the river to encourage commerce. . i In 1842 a Vizirial letter was issued permitting the crews of these two steam-vessels to land temporanly at a place called Beiis. In March 1846 an ' arrangement was come to Sir^Canmng^No. ; with the Porte for regulating the navigation ot the Tigris and Euphrates by vessels under rits colours, and the duties to be paid by British vessels when engaged in that navigation, the purport o which arrangement was thus described by bir b. Canning :— . « British -owned vessels will continue to navigate the waters of Mesopotamia under their national colours equally whether they are engaged in the foreign or in the internal trade, and they will pay upon' the merchandize which they convey the amount of duties respectively applied to each case by the Convention of Balla Liman. 'In the event of their being employed above the usual ports of entry in the internal traffic of the country, they will be liable to the anchorage duty which is always paid here, and which is sanctioned by the Capitulations; that, instead of paying 12 piastres, as levied upon each vessel in the harbour of Constantinople, they will only pay 5 piastres. « There is no question of any difference between steam-boats and sailing-vessels. ' With respect to vessels built in the country, and owned by subjects of Great Britain, which cannot by our own Regulations legally carry the national flag without registration under British authority, they will not pay higher duties than those required of the most favoured class of natives engaged in the internal trade, but they must he content to navigate like other vessels of the country. I hough it is not impossible that such vessels as have hitheito abusively enjoyed the privilege of carrying their national colours may be tacitly allowed, through favour, to carry on the same practice, it would not, I conceive, be proper for any British authority to support a claim which is manifestly at variance with the enactments of our own Legislature, be the state of Turkish law what it will.' Sir S. Canning, in reporting this home, expressed a hope that, in concluding this arrangement, he had i/m,:3 'permanently secured to British merchants the right of navigating; the waters of Mesopotamia under the protection of the British national flag, as high as the draught of vessels which bore them would allow, while the charges to be levied on the merchandize were cnly those which British subjects could not, with any show of justice or shadow of propriety, refuse ; and he then observed :— ^ The prospects which are opening to our trade in the eastern part of this Empire, and the impor tance which may justly be attached to the free navigation of its great rivers wherever our vessels can find a sufficient depth of water for that purpose, have made me anxious to place our very natural, though somewhat doubtful claims, upon a sound footing, sanctioned by the acknoirledyment of the Porte itself. This object could only be attained by frankly admitting such ot its pretensions as we could not in fairness or consistency dispute. The moment was favourable, and I was unwilling to neglect it.' This arrangement wat duly notified to the Pasha of Bagdad in a Viziri&amp;l letter dated the 2ud April, 1846, and its importance Was thus alluded to by Major Rawlinson in a despatch to Sir S. Canning: 'The formal acknowledgment which your Excel lency has succeeded in obtaining of our right to navio-ate these rivers under our own flag, and O subject to no othei' charge than a fee for anchorage, which is so low as to be merely nominal, cannot but be considered a concession of the very highest con sequence. I have every reason to believe that the British merchants connected with this part oi the Turkish Empire have been alone detened fiom establishing steam-vessels on the Tigris by the uncertainty which has hitherto prevailed as to a right of navigation, and the duties to which such navigation would be liable. Now that all question on the subject is removed, their plans will, no doubt, be carried to maturity.' Nothing further, however, was done m the matter until February 1860, when Messrs. Lynch and Co. wrote to this Office to inquire whether an English Company had a right to navigate the waters between Mohammerah, Bussorah, and Bagdad, when they were informed of the Agreement entered into with the Porte in 1846.n r But, in the following month (February 1860), Messrs. Lynch, June 2, 1860. Mr. Hyslop, the Acting British Consul-General at Bagdad, informed Messrs. Lynch's agents at that place that the Vizirial letter of 1846 could not be considered as conferring any permanent right, and that Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, looking upon it as a document giving merely a temporary permission, which might at any time be revoked by another document of a similar character, did not deem it safe for them to engage their capital in the navigation of the rivers of Mesopo tamia until they had obtained from the Porte some special sanction to that effect; but that he was happy to inform them that the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs had acquainted Sir Henry Bulvver that, if they were to apply to the Porte for a Firman of Concession to establish a line of steamers to run between Bagdad and Bussorah, he thought that the Porte would not be averse to an arrangement of that nature. Messrs. Lynch, however, were informed by this Office, in reply to their inquiry on the subject, that there was nothing in the Foreign Office to show that the arrangement of 184() with the Porte, or the Vizirial instructions issued in consequence, would bear the limited constructions put upon them in Mr. Hyslop's letter. In June following, Messrs. Lynch wrote again, to say that they had been informed by their agent at Bagdad that the local authorities would oppose their navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates ; upon which Sir H. Bulwer was instructed to speak to the To Sir H. Bulwer, No. 663; Ottoman Minister on the subject, and to express a November 27, i860. hope that the arrangement of 1846, which secured to British subjects the right of navigating the waters of Mesopotamia under the protection of the British flag, would be faithfully adhered to by the Turkish Government. In the meantime, the special Firman alluded to by Mr. Kyslop would not appear to have been applied for or obtained, since Messrs. Lynch, in November following, applied to this Office to know Messrs. Lynch, whether it was still advisable that they should wait the issue of a special Firman by the Porte autho rizing their undertaking (namely, the navigation of the Tigris by steamers put together at Bussorah for that purpose), and asked, at the same time, for the . ! November 30, 1860.fS % To Messrs. Lynch, December 10, 1860. To Messrs. Lynch and Co., February 2, 1861. assistance of Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constan tinople. Tn this letter they also said :— ' It is by no means our aim or intention to avoid the cost of the usual fees or other charges incidental to procuring the Firman in question, if deemed necessary; but our experience of the bureaucratic system in Turkey convinces us that a direct action on our part would be met with indifference and interminable references; and it is on this ground alone—the Company which we have formed to carry- out the proposed scheme having already subscribed the requisite funds—that we respectfully solicit the further assistance of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.' But although Lord John Russell consented to send a copy of their letter to Her Majesty's Ambas sador at Constantinople, his Lordship declined to express any opinion on the subject of its contents. On the 15th January, 1861, a further Vizirial letter was, at the request of Sir H. Bulwer, addressed to the Governor-General of Bagdad on the subject of the navigation of the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, and a copy of it was communicated to Messrs. Lynch and Co. by this Office. But in this Vizirial letter it was only stated that the ' British Embassy had recently made certain communications for the purpose of obtaining a renewal of the orders which were sent concerning the British steamers and boats authorized by Her Majesty to ply on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates; that it had appeared from the register that permis sion had on a former occasion been applied for by it to station two steamers on the River Euphrates at Bagdad, and to run them by turns, for the purpose of facilitating trade ; and that two Firmans, dated respectively in 1834 and 1842, were addressed to the late Governor-General of Bagdad, authorizing the permanent station of two steamers on that river, provided it was proved and established that the advantages resulting therefrom would be mutual, and that no sort of inconvenience would ensue therefrom.' The letter then went on to say what duties should in future be paid. No allusion whatever was made to the Agree ment of 1846, which, at the time of its issue, was 1.668] ili6 October 19, 1870. understood as granting the privilege of navigation without limitation. On the 3rd June, 1861, Messrs. Lynch and Co. announced that the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company had been duly constituted and registered, and that they were about to dispatch their first vessel to Bussorah ; when Sir H. Bulwer was instructed by the Secretary of State to give such countenance and support to the interests of the Company as he could properly afford. In 1870 the question was reopened, when Colonel sir H. Elliot, No. 25; Herbert, then Her Majesty's Consul-General at May 22,18/0. Bagdad, stated that the ' important privilege which Her Majesty's Government enjoyed of keeping vessels on those rivers was endangered, from the fact that Namik Pasha, the Turkish Governor- General, was fully bent upon driving the vessels of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany off them, and that to this end he had com missioned three steamers from Belgium.' In the same year the Euphrates and Tigris Com- Euphrates and Tigris Company, pany addressed a letter to Lord Granville praying his Lordship to obtain from the Turkish Govern ment permission for them to send out another vessel to meet the requirements of their trade, and in this letter they said : ' The two vessels we already have are supposed to be authorised by special Firman, and we are not sure if we have the right to employ a third or more without special permission.' In this letter it was stated that Midhat Pasha, the successor to Namik Pasha, was favourable to the increase of British steam-vessels on the river. In February 1873 the Governor-General of Bagdad complained that the Mail Company had imported a small steamer to convey passengers from Bussorah to Bagdad, and in his letter to the British Vice-Consul he said: '* The steamers of Messrs. Lynch run, as you know, with permission' In September of this year (1873) Messrs. Lynch Messrs. Lynch, complained that the local authorities at Bagdad objected to their employing a steam-launch on the Tigris for the carrying of the mails when the waters were low ; but, on the matter being referred to Constantinople, the Porte gave its consent to the Sir H. Elliot, No.'348; employment of the launch, provided only two September 24, 1873. steamers were used at one time. This did not t- . , • /•••. t u i r i Euphrates and Tigris Company, salisfy Messrs.

Elliot, No. 247 ; October 28, 1874. being rnadG to Constantinople, the Porte, with some reluctance, consented to the employment of the launch on all occasions. As the orders, however, did not reach Basdad, a fresh appeal was made to the Porte on the subject in the following year, and permission was then sent, by telegraph, to Bagdad for Messrs. Lynch's steam- launch to ply between Bagdad and Bussorah during the repair of one of the Company's steamers. In answer to a request which was at the same time made by the Tigris Steam Navigation Company, through the British Embassy at Constantinople, to be permitted to replace one of their steamers by a new one, the Porte refused to give its consent, on the ground that there were, ' at that moment, on the Tigris four, instead of the two steam-vessels allowed by the Firman, and that one of these was improperly armed as a ship of war, and doing duty as a stationnaire attached to the British Con sulate-General.' * 3 Shortly after this another question arose as to the right of the Turkish authorities to seize a steam- launch belonging to Messrs. Lynch, and employed in carrying passengers between the Turkish port of Bussorah and the Persian town of Mohammerah, when Sir H. Elliot was instructed—' as some doubts might exist whether the Vizirial letter of the 2nd April, 1846, was still in force, by which the naviga tion of the rivers of Mesopotamia for commercial purposes was opened to vessels under the British flag, whether engaged in the foreign or in the internal trade '—to ascertain whether the privileges granted by that letter had ever been abrogated; to which his Excellency replied that he thought it would be unsafe to make any inquiry at the Porte which could be regarded as implying that there was a doubt upon the subject, but that he had alluded to the subject in conversation with Aarify Pasha, who said he would look into the matter. But his Excellency added : ' If our rights upon these rivers are limited to those granted by the Firman and Vizirial letters, we do not seem entitled to claim more than the maintenance of the two vessels originally named.' ♦ This had reference to the employment of the 'Comet,' which, being' quite a distinct q-iestion, is not alluded to in this Memorandum.—E. H.8 In February 1875 Messrs. Lynch and Co. renewed Messrs .Lynch and Co., their request to be allowed to replace one of their February 25, 1875. old vessels by a new one, and in the following month the Porte authorized them to do so, and also Sir H. Elliot, No. 168; , . . . March 31, 1875. to employ their steam-launch m exceptional cases and when the water was low ; but as it was reported that Messrs. Lynch were about to place an addi tional steam-vessel, as well as two iron lighters, on the Tigris and Euphrates, a letter was written to the Company, by Lord Derby's direction, to know To' Messrs. Lynch and Co., if the report was true, and they were at the same A P ri1 24 » 1875 * time told that Her Majesty's Government were not prepared to ask for further privileges for them than those which the Porte had already accorded. The report, however, was stated by Messrs. Lynch Messrs. Lynch and Co., to be entirely without foundation, as they ' had no Apnl 2,J ' 1875, intention of placing either an additional steamer or lighters on those rivers.' In May 1879 the Euphrates and Tigris Company Sir H. Layard, No. 34 asked to be allowed to put an extra steamer on la - v 27,1S/9 * those rivers, in order to enable them to carry out more satisfactorily their contract for the conveyance of Indian mails, for which they received a subsidy from Indian finances; but the Porte refused to comply with their request, although it was strongly supported by Her Majesty's Government, stating as a reason that they were about to reform and improve the service of the steamers of the ' Osman Company.'' This reply was deemed far from satisfactory, more Messrs. Sassoon, particularly since Messrs. Sassoon had also applied January 22, 1879. to Lord Salisbury to endeavour to obtain permission to employ one or two suitable steamers on those rivers for the accommodation of passengers and merchandize, and his Lordship had repeatedly in- To Sir H. Layard, No. 90 structed Sir H. Layard to impress upon the Porte November 23 » I 87 ®* the, importance of opening the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates to navigation by vessels under the British flag. On the 23rd October, 1879, the Tigris and Euphrates Company (L mited) addressed a letter to Lord Salisbury, praying that steps might be taken to induce the Porte to throw the navigation of the rivers open. In this letter the Company said that, ' by special Firman from the Porte, they had been engaged since 1861' in the navigation of these rivers; but it willi) To Jir H.

Upon the receipt of this letter a despatch was addressed to Sir H. Layard, in which he was in structed to remind the Porte of the numerous appeals which had been made to it by Her Majesty's Government to remove the restrictions which existed on the trade of that part of the Ottoman Empire and upon the development of the resources of the districts adjacent to the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates; and his Excellency was then told to urge most earnestly on the Turkish Government the removal of the restrictions imposed on the navigation of those rivers by vessels under the British flag.' Sir H. Layard, however, replied that, considering the suspicious temper of the Porte at that moment, he felt sure that, if such a demand was then made, it would be pretty certain to be refused. In January 1880 the Euphrates and Tigris Company applied to this Office for a copy of the ' Imperial Firman by virtue of which that Company was authorized to employ steamers on the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris,' as they stated ' they had no copy of the document in their officewhereupon a copy of the Firman of 1834, and of the Vizirial letters of 1842, 1846, and 1861 (above referred to) were sent to them; and as they accepted them as being accurate, I think it is clear that no special Firman was granted to the Company in 1861. Just at this time the news arrived that an Agree ment had been concluded at Bagdad, by which the Turkish steamers on the Tigris had been let to a Turkish Company for fifteen years for 4,000/. a-year, with a monopoly of the entire navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates, with the exception of two English steamers. Every endeavour was at once made to stop the ratification of this arrangement, and Sir H. Layard was assured by the Porte that such a monopoly should not be granted. In alluding to this proposed monopoly, the Euphrates and Tigris Company took the opportunity of renewing their request to be allowed to increase the number of their steamers on those rivers. [668] D10 ♦ . __ _ i i. j Sir H. Layard, No. 3; At the same Vnoment Sir H. Layard reported that j anuary ig, 1880. the Dutch Minister at Constantinople had demanded of the Porte that a Dutch Company might, by Treaty right, be granted the same privileges as had been conceded to the English, to navigate the rivers of Mesopotamia, and that, as the claims were admitted, a Firman to that effect would be issued. His Excellency added that he had taken the oppor tunity, in speaking to Sawas Pasha and the Piime Minister upon the subject, to urge upon them the importance of throwing open these rivers to steam navigation, so that the trade and resources of Turkey might thereby be developed, that his observations were favourably received, and that a promise was given that the request of the Euphrates and 1 igris Company to employ a third vessel should be re considered. After this a correspondence arose, which has at length given rise to the present question raised by Mr. Goschen, namely, whether the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company have a right to employ barges on the Mesopotamia!! rivers. Great distress having been found to exist in Mesopotamia and Armenia, the Euphrates and Tigris Company in December 1879 employed two cargo flats, by means of which they towed large quantities of grain to Bagdad for the relief of the distressed population ; but by what authority they did so there is nothing in our archives to show. In March following, these cargo fiats (or barges) Euphrates and Tigris Company, were stopped by the local authorities, but on the Marcl1 1880 * attention of the Porte being called to the fact by Sir H. Layard, his Excellency was informed that orders had been sent to the Vali of Bagdad to allow the barges to pass. But, on the 24th April, the Euphrates and Tigris Company wrote to say that no such orders had been received by the Vali of Bagdad ; whereupon Sir H. Layard spoke to the Porte again upon the subject, and, on the 27th April, his Excellency telegraphed to say that he had received an assurance that instructions had at leiiirth been sent. Still the local authorities refused cj ', to allow the steamers of the Euphrates and Tigris Company to tow barges, and the Porte was, in con- To Sir H. Layard, No. 78; sequence, again appealed to; and,on the 13th May, May 85 1880, a communication was received from Musurus Pasha stating that orders had been sent by telegraph to the•*:) n ii authorities of the Vilayet of Bussorah: 'Afin que les deux bateaux de la Compagnie Lynch puissent remonter des schlepps, des mahones, et m6me des caiqs, pourvu qu'elle consente a transporter des To Musurus Pasha, May 14,1880. cereales aux endroits ou r^gne la disetteto which, however. Lord Granville replied that Her Majesty's Government did not consider that any conditions of that nature could be imposed on the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates by the vessels of the Company. The Euphrates and Tigris Company were informed of this correspondence ; and were requested, at the same time, to explain the precise state of the case as to the employment of barges and boats, other than the two steamers, by the Company in the navigation of the rivers ; to which the Secretary CD sent the following reply. After alluding to the Firman of 1834 and the Vizirial letter (or arrange ment) of 1846, he said :— ' I am in a position to state that in 1846, when this question was under consideration, the firm of Messrs. S. Lynch and Co., and others, both Persian and Indian subjects, possessed boats, of 150 to 200 tons burden, navigating the rivers and trans porting merchandize, and, since the formation of the Euphrates and Tigris Company, the same description of boats, the property of British subjects, have been employed uninterruptedly in conveying coal and firewood for the use of the steamers and for other purposes, occasionally being towed by the steamers.' It should, however, be remembered that, on the 26th April, 1875, the Company stated that there was no truth in the report that they were about to place two iron lighters on those rivers. The letter then went on to say ''Last year, owing to the low state of the rivei, and a consequent cessation of through communi cation, which was greatly to the detriment of commerce, my Directors decided upon providing steel barges of light draft, never doubting that they might be employed without restriction, as has always been the case with the boats previously alluded to. They were accordingly sent out and commenced working last December, being lashed alongside and towed by the Company's steamers. ' No question regarding their employment was .51 TTSI;12 raised until March, when, in obedience to orders from here, the rate of freight on grain was temporarily reduced to a minimum, with the view of alleviating the distress at Bagdad arising from scarcity of food. It was then that their employment was arbitrarily prohibited by the local Turkish authorities, a step which can only be accounted for on the presumption # that they view the reduction of freight as detri mental to the pecuniary interests of the Turkish steamers. ' I trust your Lordship will consider that this despotic policy, to interfere with the right to transmit English and Indian merchandize, now arriving at Busreh, on through bills of lading for Bagdad, by boat or barge manned by natives of the country, cannot be defended, whether tracked or towed by steamers, for steam-vessels are introduced 4 to facilitate commerce;' to prevent them from Firman, utilizing their power in towing barges with mer chandize when required, is manifestly a step in the opposite direction.' On the 24th May the Euphrates and Tigris Com- Euphrates and Tigris Company, pany wrote again to say that their barges were Way 24, 1880. still detained, when it was discovered that the Sir H. Layard, No. 64; telegram had been stopped by the Turkish Prime Ta y ^ l880 * Minister, in order to bring about a misunderstanding between his colleagues and Sir H. Layard. But Sir H. Layard stated that he had himself telegraphed to Her Majesty's Consul-General at Bagdad to inform him that orders had been sent to the Turkish authorities at Bagdad and^Bussorah to permit the steamers of the Euphrates and Tigris Company to tow the Company's barges upon the rivers. But a few days later the Company wrote to say Euphrates and Tigris Company, that the Pasha had, at last, permitted the employ- May 26 ' 1880 ' ment of the barges, but only temporarily, and they requested that Lord Granville would immediately protest and repudiate the implied authority of the Turkish Government to impose any limitation on their right to employ boats and barges in the naviga tion of the rivers of Mesopotamia, a right which, it was asserted, had been enjoyed by all nationalities from time immemorial, and which prohibition it was argued could not be enforced on the ground that steel was used in the construction of the boats instead of iron, and that the more expeditiousf ) n •Euphrates and .Tigris Company June 12, 1880.

Euphrates and Tigris Company, June 26, 1880. 13 method of towmg the barges was adopted in place of the primitive custom of tracking hitherto in vogue, Mr. Goschen was thereupon instructed to ask for an explanation from the Porte with respect to the alleged temporary nature of the permission for navigation thus granted, and to use his best endea vours to prevent its withdrawal, if such a step were contemplated, pending the discussion on the subject between the two Governments. It may here be mentioned that the result of the barges resuming w r ork was that the price of wheat in Bagdad fell 25 per cent. On the 17th June Mr. Goschen sent the following telegram to Lord Granville :— ' Please ask Company in London whether per mission to use barges is claimed as a right or asked for as a favourto which the following reply was returned:— tc Her Majesty's Government regard permission to use barges as a right; but if you are in doubt as to facts of the case, consult Consul-General at Bagdad.' The instructions given by the Porte to the Vali were to withdraw the prohibition on barges being towed during the continuance of the famine j but the Euphrates and Tigris Company stated in a subsequent letter that u they had, on very good authority, the confirmation of their right to employ iron and steel barges, and to have them towed by steamers on the Tigris and Euphrates,' but they did not state what that authority was. On the 16th December, however, Assim Pasha sent a note to Mr. St. John, in answer to Mr. Goschen's inquiries respecting Messrs. Lynch's position on the Mesopotamian rivers, in which he said :— ' La navigation de TEuphrate n'est point ouverte aux pavilions etrangers, et que c'est en vertu d'un Firman special qu'il a ete concede a MM. Lynch de faire naviguer deux bateaux a vapeur sur ce fleuve. ' Aux termes de ce Firman MM. Lynch ne peuvent pas augmenter leur materiel flottant; c'est en raison des circonstances extraordinaires et de la crise que traversaient les contrees environnantes T 6681 E14 qu'ils ont dte autoris^s a faire remorquer provisoire- ment des chalands par leurs bateaux. It would seem from this that a special Fii man was granted to Messrs. Lynch in 1861; but I think Assim Pasha must have been referring to the original Firman of 1834, for had Messrs. Lynch been granted a special Firman they would surely have produced it before this. This note was referred to Mr. Goschen, who replied that he had discussed the claim of Messrs. Lynch to be allowed to tow barges on the Euphrates very fully with Mr.Plowden before he left foi Bagdtid, but that neither of them had much confidence that the claim could be maintained as a right. On the 22nd February of this year the Euphrates and Tigris Company wrote to say that the local authorities had again prohibited the employment of these barges, adding that as 'the general right to employ such craft on the river had, they believed, been recognized by Her Majesty's Government,' they again appealed to Lord Granville to endeavour to obtain, without delay, the final withdrawal of all restrictions. Upon which Mr. Goschen was in structed to do what he could in the matter, ' as the stoppage of the barges was opposed to the welfare of the country and the interests of the Porte and Messrs. Lynch were so informed. The matter now stands thus: Mr. St John has explained to Assim Pasha Mr. Goschen's views, that ' until better prospects of a harvest appeared to warrant the suppression of the means of trans porting grain to the famine-stricken districts, where so much relief was afforded last year, it seemed the height of imprudence to enforce the prohibition and that Minister has promised to lay the matter before the Prime Minister, and Mr. Goschen in the meantime asks whether Her Majesty's Government have recognized the right of the Company to employ barges on the River Euphrates. In answer to this inquiry, I think Mr. Goschen's attention should be drawn to the fact that the Law Officers reported, on a previous occasion, that the right to navigate the rivers of the Ottoman Empire under the British flag was not secured to British subjects by Treaty. The only right, therefore, which the Euphrates and Tigris Company could have to navigate the June 14, 1864, Navigation of th« Nile.[CO ■ mm S ■ ^ li - 16 Mesopotamian rivers would seem to be that derived from the Firman of the 29th December, 1834, and the Vizirial letters of the 2nd April, 1846, and the 15th January, 1861, since no special Firman in their favour has ever been produced. But whether that Firman and those Vizirial letters confer upon the Company the permanent right to navigate those rivers, either by their steamers or their barges, is a point which has never really been satisfactorily settled; and although Mr. Goschen was informed, on the 19th June last, that Her Majesty's Government considered that the Company had a right to use barges on those rivers, and although it has been repeatedly shown that it is most important that British interests should be fully protected in those rivers, and, if possible, extended, still the fact remains that no formal docu ment (beyond those quoted above) has been produced showing how the Company came to possess such a rightj or that it has ever been formally acknow ledged by the Turkish Government.
