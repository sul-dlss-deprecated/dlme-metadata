It discusses his duties as pilgrimage officer, which consist of protecting and catering for pilgrims from India and other British territories, and names those groups that are deemed by the British to be responsible for the intrigues against him. Ihsanullah's zeal on behalf of Indian pilgrims is also mentioned as being a factor, since it is reported to have caused friction between Ihsanullah and the Saudi authorities.The correspondence includes discussion of the possibility of Ihsanullah being transferred to Aden, the arrangements for Ihsanullah's pension, the effect that his retirement is likely to have on Indian pilgrims, and the question of who should succeed him in his post. The principal correspondents regarding this matter are the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India (Sir Samuel Findlater Stewart), His Majesty's Minister at Jedda (Sir Reader William Bullard), and officials of the Foreign Office, the India Office, and the Government of India's Foreign Department (later External Affairs Department).Also included is correspondence between His Majesty's Chargé d'Affaires, Jedda (Albert Spencer Calvert), and the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which discusses the case of a former servant of Ihsanullah's who sought refuge from her husband with Ihsanullah and his family.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence (folios 2).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Retirement</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Vice-Consul, Jeddah</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Muslim pilgrims and pilgrimages</topic></subject><subject><topic>Pensions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002b5#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002b5#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
