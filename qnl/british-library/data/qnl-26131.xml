Dear T/'alton, '//ill you please refer to Lai thwaite ’ s letter to me 1.2.7877/33 dated 4th December 1933 enclosing copies oi my letter of the 10th August 1933 on points arising in connection with the transfer of Aden, and Ox the minutes of the meeting at the Foreign Office at which my letter was discussed? As it has been proposed that l should go to England this summer to discuss details connected with the transfer with the India Oifice and the Colonial Office, I have prepared a note reviewing the fourteen points that were then discussed, ani adding remarks on further questions that appear to me to require consideration and decision before the transfer takes place. I enclose a copy of this note. 1 also enc-Lose a copy of a draft estimate for Aden (as distinct from the Aden Protectorate) showing probable revenue and expenditure after its separation from India. I am sending a copy of the note and of the draft estimate to the Colonial Office and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Yours sincerely, (SD.) B.R.Reilly. J. C. Walt on, Esq., India Office, London. C.B. ,M.C. ,M.A. ,Aaxca 3617 I K 56 j Point 11 » Ecclesiastical . There has been a considerable amount of correspondence on this subject, and I have recently advocated the appointment of Royal Air Force chaplains at Aden and its separation from the Diocese of Bombay. My reason for departing from the recommendation made in my letter of the 10th August 1933 that Aden should remain in the Diocese of Bombay and continue to be served by chaplains of the Indian Ecclesiastical Establishment was that I was given to understand that it would be impossible to send these Indian Service chaplains to Aden after the transfer except on a voluntary basis, which, in my opinion, would be unworkable. I have, however, now heard from the Bishop of Bombay that he hopes to find a means of overcoming this difficulty. If so, I would gladly revert to my original view that the present ecclesiastical arrangements should continue. This opinion is, however, subject to one reservation. At present the normal establishment here is two chaplains, of whom one is paid wholly by the Government of India and the other is paid in the proportion of one- quarter^ by the Government of India and three-quarters by the Air Ministry. As at least three-quarters of the members of the Church of England in Aden belong to the Amny and Royal Air Force I consider that the Air Ministry ought to pay three-quarters of the total cost of the ecclesiastical establishment. I understand that they are willing to do so for one chaplain but are not prepared to pay any part of the cost of a second chaplain. I do not consider that Aden revenues can justifiably be debited with one and one-quarter of the cost of the chaplains who are here mainly for the benefit of His Majesty*s Services, and if the Air Ministry are not prepared to modify their view the establishment ^Ji\will have to he reduced from two chaplains to one. In my opinion this would be an undesirable result as I do not think that one chaplain is sufficient, and the absence of a second chaplain leaves no provision for sickness or short leaves of absence. If it is eventually decided to increase the permanent garrison of Aden, I hope that the Air Ministry will modify their view and will agree to bear a proportionate share of the cost of two chaplains. At present the Air Ministry pay an annual contribution of Rs.450 in respect of the maintenance of Churches and Rs.450 for the maintenance of cemeteries. I recommend that these contributions should continue to be made.Mr. laithwaite. As a result of the dissolution of the legal union between the Church of Hhgland and the Church of Sngland in India, any question relating to the extent or limits of the diocese of Bombay is for the General Council of the Church , and Government appears to have no authority in the matter. It is unlikely, however, that the Church would exclude Aden from the diocese of Bombay as a consequence of any political changes separating Aden from India. At present the Government of India provides chaplains from the Bombay Cadre of the Indian Ecclesiastical Establishment for two civil chaplaincies at Aden. The cost to India is reduced by an annual contribution made by the i 1 Air Ministry in respect of religious ministrations h to the Church of England members of the garrison. The correspondence on the subject of that contribution is in the Military Department, and from its volume, it would appear that thearrangement has not proved entirely satisfactory either to the Air 1 inistry or to the Government of India. If Aden is separated from India, the Government of India may prefer that the Aden authorities should obtain their own chaplains. The fact that the Bishop of Bombay exercises authority in Aden is not necessarily any obstacle to an arrangement of that kind which might prove economical since,in addition to the chaplains salaries^ the payments that would have to be made to the Government of India in respect of leave and pension contributions for the 2 chaplains lent to Aden would be considerable. But the question of separating Aden from India does not appear yet to have reached a stage at which the Government of India could be asked for i*ts views as to the future chaplaincy arrangements at Aden. . y 5' S3Secretary, P.&amp; J. Department Transfer of Aden Please see the extract from a letter from the Resident at Aden and the note of a subsequent discussion helow. I should be grateful for your observations on the point in issue. In the event of Aden being separated from India it will, of course, cease to be part of British India, but there would perhaps be nothing anomalous in allowing it to remain part of the Diocese of Bombay and served by Chaplains of the Indian Ecclesiastical Establishment. It is perhaps relevant that it is proposed to retain Indian civil personnel for a number of years after the transfer in all civil (as distinct from political) appointments at Aden. _ ! 3 ^I T.etter from Golonel Heillv to I.r.Laithwaite.

Dear Laithwaite, In conversation in London some weeks, ago it was suggested that I should enumerate some of the points that will require consideration if Aden is separated from India. Those that occur to me are:- 11. Lccleslast leal . Aden at present forms part of the diocese of Bombay, and is served by chaplains of the Indian Ecclesiastical Establishment. I think this arrangement ought to be allowed to continue, at an y rate f or a time.j &gt; r &lt;-* i (The references in the note below are to the points raised in Colonel Reilly’s demi-official letter of 10th August 1933). Colonel Reilly’s d.o. letter of 10th August 1933 was discussed at the India Office on 15th August. In addition to Colonel Reilly there were present Mr. Cowell of the Colonial Office, Mr. Walton and Mr. Laithwaite of the India Office. 11. a^iaRifi-stlcal.
