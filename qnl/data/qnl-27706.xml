The Chief Secretary conveys the Governor in Council’s opinion that the British Government has no grounds to interfere in this and similar maritime attacks arising out of the long running feud between Mahomed Been Shakboot, the expelled Chief of Abothebee [Abu Dhabi] and his brother Sheikh Tanoon [Shaikh Said bin Tahnun Āl Nahyān], who was appointed his successor by the Imaum [Imam] of Muscat. The British Political Resident is instructed to distinguish carefully between his duty to suppress piracy and the British Government’s policy of non-interference in hostilities between rival chiefs and their allies, over tribal leadership claims.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024196567.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
