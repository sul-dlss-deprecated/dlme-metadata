''.fter a desultory conversation he suddenly began to coil and uncoil his legs, { a sign th t he has something important to say ) and said that he wished to discuss something he had not mentioned to Father, or even Brother Abdullah or the Adviser, and to take my adviee. 2. lie then sf id that the King had paid them the honour of a visit to .Bahrain and that some return should be made* bin Jiluwi, the Amir of Hasa, had just returned irom the Kaj, he was like the .Aing' 3 brother, anc he thought that he should go and pay a visit to him or else send a rela tive, such as the boy Aubarak. I suggested that the neat might try him, but he made light of it saying th .t it was only a night's journey on land. •3. Then he said that some time ago, the Shaikh of Kuwait had paid him visit in Bahrain in a Southampton, anc tnat he would much like to return it. He inquired if a man-of- war or * something ' would be available to take him there. e mentioned that during the War he had been taken up » 1 to -asrah on the Aawrence and again on some other ship and that he had much enjoyed it. Failing this he wou'd likely to go by the Mail. % Vj || 4. As regards bin Jiluwi, I could only say that I thought it a very good idea if the heat did not deter him. The mention of the f boy Mubarak 1 is not of course meant to be taken au pied de la lettrei as he x is too young anc the Shaikh is evidently very keen on getting out of Bahrain himself. The er%ans have prevented him from taking his h wk- mc holidays at Lings,h and it is a long time since he had a j 0,1 Jl ' e 0f e ' lr ' It did not seem politic to put any obstao ePag 0 2, in the way of his visiting bin Jiluwi, nor, since lie is well disposed to us, did there seen any point in it. The only dan ger is that he might be tempted to extend his travels and visit bin Baud in ^iadh, and tlr t astute ruler might atte^nit to ex tract some concession for himself or his Yejdis from the good- natured Shaikh Hamad. bin Jiluwi is of course not a brother of the King but a distant relation. 5. .Kuwait is another matter. T^e Kail would be most unsuitable a^ he would be bound to wish to call on you at Easnire, anr t/i.e Fersi&lt;ins would* have an excellent o.oportu- nity of making themselves unpleasant. 7ould the Trlid be available in the near future to take him up to Kuwait and back again ? I dont think he wants to stay for more than three days. I suggested to him, that it would be better to wait till the Bar ha was over ( another fortnight ) before going on ...c count of sea sicxnes-, nnc he -greed,so this will give cime to con sul u th ■ S» j .

' His Excellency deserves well at the hands of Government, anr the compliment would be much appreoh ted by him. A Southampton would not be welcome as he cannot carry any followers with him, nor have they the prestige of a warship. I dont Know how many men he will want to t .Jce vtith him, as he has bound Belgrave to se crecy or he said ' they will all cry till they come.' I expect thirty would oe about the number.

Gazdar has just wired me that the Shaikh has written saying 1 about our conversation concering the ship to Kuwait, I would like if possible to go there after about twenty days.* I mentioned it to Captain Marr, and he says that since the I.E.T.D. have nt interests in Kuwait they would charge 2000/- a day for taking Shaikh Hamad there. Would it not be possible for the Tirad to do it now that you are not using it ? Shaikh Hamad has been a very good friend to us and we never seem to do anything for him. He has probably heard that the Triad had taken the Sultan to Dhofar, and as this is the only request that he has made since I have been at Bahrain I would like to give him a favourable reply if possible. He would no doubt cut his staff down if required, and if he has travelled on the Lupin he must certainly have done so in the past. If the Shaikh does go by mail steamer, he will feel it his bounden duty to call on you if there is time, and if he is put to any inconvenience by the Persian authorities both he and you will'lose face* to a serious extent I Perhaps you could at any rate ask the Senior Naval Officer if he could fit it in.

If I am not there, it would be appropriate for a Political Officer to accompany the Shaikh on official occasions, but it is not absolutely necessary if Belgrave is there and I should prefer not to have a Political Officer unless he is one v/hose presence will enhance the prestige of the Shaikh and preferably one who knows Arabic. 6. I would only add that the sad news which has come this morning may alter the Shaikh's wish to go to London.

I said that I thought that the best thing that I could do would be to make enquiries through you and let him know, 4. It is possible that you may wish to consider the following point. In a recent broadcast it was stated that the King would hold a Darbar in India after the Coronation, ^t may be that Government will consider it appropriate to ask the Shaikh to attend either the Coronation in London or the Darbar in India. In some ways the latter would seem, at first sight, the more suitable, but (as we said in a recent informal conver sation) an awkward question of precedence might arise^ 5. Before other nations we maintain for good reasons of our own, the independent sovereignty of the ^uler of Bahrain (and of Kuwait). If other nations see that in the presence of the King we give them place below dependent rulers, we lay our facade policy open to a shrewd blow. If we give them place as /independent Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bushire.I / independent Rulers (which we logically should do), certain great Innian States might well be aggrieved. It is possible, however, that the difficulty might be surmounted by treating them as ^distinguished foreigners * and being careful to place them among other foreign guests on occasions which might involve questions of precedence with Indian Rulers.Oonfidentiel.

So far as tlie India Office is concerned, we would tj refer to have the Sheikh here this year rather than next year which threatens in any case to he a husy one. Moreover it seems that from the Sheikh's point of view a visit this year would he more of a success as it would 'be possible to give him more attention. We imagine that all the social events except the courts will take place as usual this year, and we should therefore he inclined, if an official visit is sanctioned, to encourage the Sheikh to come this summer, preferably in June, which appears to be a suitable month* This, however, raises the question whether an official guest would be welcome during the period of Court mourning. Before giving any further consideration to the matter, we would be very grateful if you could let us have your views on this point.?,z*2208/36. t- ^ VI E MAIL . ^IDEFTI/iL .

The case has heen discussed with Fowle in Delhi. It is true thrt the previous visit of Shaikh Hamad to England in 1925 was made privately, and that the visit of Shaikh Ahmad of Kuwait in 1935 was also private* In the latter case, however, the Shaikh was ill and particularly risked that hie visit should not 'be in a public capacity. The visit of the Jultan of Muscat to England in 1928 was at the expense o^ the Government Hospitality Fund, who entertained him for one month, and it appears that there is an earlier precedent of 1919 when the Shaikhs of Kuwait, Bahrain ond Nejd were so treated. 2« It occurs to us, however, that official quests may not he welcome during the period of Court mourning. Before a decision is reached whether to encourage the Shaikh to proceed with his plans for a visit to Kngland this year or to suggest to him that it mi ht 'be better to postpone it until 1957, we should 'be glad to be informed what is the position in this respect.

I have commnlcated His Majesty's Government's invitation to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 'Isa A1 Khalifah and will telegraph his reply as soon a,s possible fv .'i'! 3- The Adviser to the Bahrain Government has told me that the party will probably consist of himself and Mrs. Belgrave, two of the Shaikh's younger sons, 'Abdullah bin Jabr, and three servants making a total of eight. I have asked for a final list of names and will forward it as soon as possible. The Shaikh proposes to travel to Basrah by the slow mail from here on the 1st of June, reaching Baghdad on/ MFP— 400S&amp;P—(M-480)—26 -7 -84— 2,00 ,000.on the 4th, and leaving there on the 7th. He is due at Istanbul on the 11th and should arrive in London on the 14th June. 5, It is probable that Shaikh 9 Abdullah bin ?lsa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad will constitute a Council of Regency during the Ruler's absence. Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammad may be a member of this Council. 6« The Ruler is very anxious to present a gold and pearl sword to ^is Ma.lesty the King. I shall be grateful for any instructions that may be necessary regarding obtaining His Majesty 1 s consent to the accept ance of this gift. I believe it is intended to send the sword by air mail to a Bank in England in advance of the party's departure from here. 6. The Ruler and his sons and servants will be carrying daggers and in addition the members of tne ■ J, — Ruling family will have swords. I am not sure if any particular permission is required for carrying weapons through the various countries traversed in the train journey but propose to give the usual document stating who the party are and the purpose of their journey. I shall be grateful for any information on this point. 3^0 party will be in possession of Bahrain passports and will presumably have to obtain tne usual visas in Baghdad. I shall be glad if arrangements be made with Embassy in Baghdad to facilitate the issue of the necessary visas. It will be seen that the Ruler will probably be in Baghdad for about three days. I do not know what he Intends to do there but will enquire. I know he has followed closely his brother's reception in Baghdad as reported in the papers. 8, The Ruler is anxious to visit the St. Sophia Mosque/ ' IMosque in Istanbul, I understand that the time avail able in latanbul is very short and the visit would have to be of the briefest duration. I suggest that, if you think fit, the Foreign Office be asked to arrange for a member of the Embassy to meet the train and conduct the Ruler to the Mosque and bring him back to the station in time to catch the train, 9 # The Ruler is considering being away for two months or possibly longer and has expressed a desire to return via Cairo and Palestine. He is endeavour- • ' '' - ■' * ' ing to keep his visit secret until the last possible moment, probably through fear of Shaikh Mohammad's .loining the party» 10.

The Ruler of Bahrain has never been the guest of His Majesty's Government nor have any of his pre decessors. In 1919 Shaikh 'Abdullah bin 'Isa the youngest son of the then Shaikh of Bahrain was entertained by His Majesty's Government. It is quite true that there are a number of Shaikhs in the u ulf, but they are of very different standing to the Sultan of Muscat and the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait and there would be no question of His Majesty's Government's being required to extend the same hospitality to them all. 3. I have discussed the matter unofficially s mfp —400S &amp;p—(m -480)—26-7-34—2 ,00,000. with/the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. I consider that the Ruler shoiild. be entertained, hy His Majesty's Government for one month. It would be very unfortunate if His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin »Isa A1 Khalifah was entertained for a lesser period of time than that for which his younger brother had previously been entertained. In this respect I fully agree with the last sentence of paragraph 5 of letter No. P.Z.g748 dated the 6th May 1936 from the India Office to the Government of India. . &lt; f vjo ' 4- I forgot to mention that the Ruler is very anxious to attend Ascot which he went to when on a private visit to England eleven years ago and am sure he will enjoy the entertainment referred to in paragraph 6 of Indi Office letter No. P .Z. 8748 dated the 6th May 1936 to the Government of India. //% ' Captain, Offa* ~ Political.Agaat, Bahrain.

No.D.lOSl-N/SG, on the subject of the proposed visit of Sheikh Hamad of Bahrein to England. h A copy of my letter of 7th April to Crankshaw of the Government Hospitality Fund was sent to you by the ordinary ^ mail of the 9th April and I nov; enclose a copy of Crankshaw' . reply dated the 8th April. Tie have since consulted the Lord Chamberlain's Office who state that there is no objection to the Sheikh being entertained by His Majesty's Government during the period of Court mourning, e.g. in June of this year. 2. In the circumstances it seems desirable to encourage the Sheikh to come this year rather than next. 3. The only point which may cause a little difficulty is the x^recise length of the period during which the Sheikh should receive Government hospitality. There are, of course,/ . Metcalfe, KCIE. , CSI. , WO., eign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign &amp; Political Department, Simla. y/O 2. . to | A* ^ ^ &gt; r 1 ^ --- course, the 1919 precedents and the precedent of the visit of the Sultan of Muscat in 1928. (Though in the latter case the length was decided upon only because it was felt that it v /ould 'be impossible to give the Sultan of Muscat less hospitality than had 'been given to other Persian Gulf Rulers of less importance than himself). On the other hand the Amir Saud, when he came to this country as a G-oveinment guest last year, was entertained 'by His Majesty's Government for a fortnight only (originally, I 'believe, a week was suggested, hut a fortnight was decided on in order that there should not be unfavourable comparisons with the hospitality offered by other European Governments during his tour), and after the fortnight he stayed in the United Kingdom for about another fortnight at his own expense. 4. The only other recent case that occurs to us which might be regarded as in some way parallel is the visit of the Amir of Transjordan in 1934. The Amir was originally invited for 3 weeks, but arrangements were apparently made to extend the visit for an extra week after the Amir T s arrival. The length of the official visit was, therefore, in effect, one month though the original intention had been 3 weeks* It may, however, be felt that the/$ 3, Amir of Transjordan is not rually of parallel status to the Sheikh of Bahrein, and there were apparently felt to he special reasons at the time for His Majesty's Government to go out of their way to pay particular honour to the Amir- It may well be that the Saudi Heir Apparent is as good a parallel as one is likely to get. 5. ¥e hope that in putting fo rward recommendations, the Government of India will carefully consider this question of the length of the visit. It certainly seems hard that the Government Hospitality Fund should he tied down indefinitely to a convention that any Sheikh who comes from the Persian Gulf should invariably receive one month's hospitality, if, as appears to he the case, this is considerably more than distinguished Government guests s usually get in these days. On the other hand it is clearly not worth entertaining the Sheikh at all if there is a danger of his feeling (or the Gulf people as a whole feeling) that he has been treated stingily by His Majesty's Government. 6. If the Sheikh is coming this summer it is, of course, desirable to settle the date of his arrival at the earliest possible moment. He should be here for the King's Birthday/Birthday on 25rd June and Ascot is, I believe, the week before. It might therefore be convenient for him to arrive, say, about the 15th June, if that is possible. / „ ^ 7. As regards paragraph S(b) of Powle's letter to you of 1st February, there will probably be Investitures at about the time of the King's Birthday, but if, as I think we may safely hope. His Majesty is pleased to grant the Sheikh an Audience, the matter of investiture would probably be disposed of at the same time- ¥e have no observations to offer at this stage on the other points in Fowle's letter. 8. I am sending a copy of this letter to Powle and Loch* (ftwi a. aP » Z .2.418/193 6. QOYmmmm HOSPITALITY FIFED THSASUEY CHAMBERS, WHITEHALL, S.Vul, 8tli April, 1936,. Dear Walton, ^ ' Thank you for your letter (P.Z.E208/36) of the 7th of April with which you enclosed the correspondence in connection with the proposed visit to England of the Sheikh of Bahrein,. I agree with you that it would 'be decidedly preferable that the Sheikh's visit should take place this year rather than next year and I do not think that Court mourning will interfere much with the programme of events which we would draw up for his entertairiment, I do think,however, that as a matter of courtesy you should communicate with the Lord Chamberlain r s Office before you take any definite action. I feel sure that you will be told that the visit should certainly take place but the gesture will undoubtedly be appreciated, I am somewhat concerned at the length of the proposed official visit. It is true that in the case of the Sultan of Muscat the period of official hospitality was one month and there have been one or two other cases of prolonged visits at Government expense but lately, in view of the necessity for economy, ten days or a fortnight has been considered the appropriate period.

Z.3473/36. 23rd May, 1936. IMMSDIATE . Sir 1 am directed by the Secretary of State for India bo inlorm you that His Excellency the Sheikh of Bahrein is proposing to pay a visit to England this summer arriving about the middle of June. The Sheikh is the ruler of a state in the Persian Gulf which is of peculiar political and strategic importance to His Majesty's Government (with whom he is in special treaty relations) and his attitude towards His Majesty's Government has always been most satisfactory. The Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf has recommended that His Excellency should be entertained as a guest of Government; the Government of India support this recommendation^ and Lord Zetland concurs in it. As regards the period during which His Excellency should be a Government guest^ Lord Zetland would have recommended on the basis of earlier precedents that the period in the present case should be one month. His Lordship understands 5 however^ that in recent years it has been generally considered that 10 days or a fortnight was a sufficient period for the entertainment of distinguished visitors from overseas^ and that the Amir Saud on his visit to this country last summer was .entertained officially for a period of a fortnight. He accordingly r ecommends that the Sheikh of Bahrein should be entertained by His Majesty T s Government for a fortnight from the date of his arrival in England, Secretary, arrangements/ Government Hospitality Fund, Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1arrangements lor his accornmodation and entertainment being made by the Government Hospit-ality Fund during this period and charges m connection with it being debited to His Majesty's Government in accordance with the standing arrangements in force. His Lordship further suggests that among the items of entertainment might be included a Government Dinner^ which need not be large^ and might consist of not more than S5 - 30 persons. More detailed suggestions in regard to this matter will be made to you in due course. It is understood that His Excellency will be accompanied by about 6 persons and will have with him his European Adviser, Mr. Dalrynple Belgrave. It will therefore not be necessary to attach any special political officer to the party as was done in the case of the visit of the Sultan of Muscat in 1928. Your Department will be informed at the earliest possible moment of the precise composition of the party and the precise date of arrival. 1 am to enclose for your information a copy of a letter which is being sent to the Foreign Office. 1 am y 11, Your obedient Servant^ {ScU J, C.

In particular 1 should like to know (i) the date of the Investiture and (li) whether he will be coming to Scotland. if he comes North, 1 would suggest that, even if he is no longer a Government guest, it would be greatly appreciated if Government would ask the Lord provost of Edinburgh and the Provost of Linlithgow to show him some informal courtesy. If they could be put into touch with me, 1 would gladly help them. I had thought of his seeing the Castle, St, Giles and parliament Hall ^n Edinburgh and the palace in Linlithgow (after a meal with us here). 1 know that he would be delighted if the Railway Authorities woula take him across the Forth Bridge slowly in an inspection trolley and then return below the bridge in the ferry. Possibly Stewarts and Lloyds would show him their works at Coatbridge. Yours sincerely, (SI).) G.

The following is a report of the official visit of which I am passing on to you in case it may he of interest. S. 'Deptford' arrived off Ashar according to programme at 10 a,m, prompt and fired the usual salute of twenty one guns in honour of the country she was visiting^ viz. - Iraq, A twentyone gun salute was immediately fired in return by the Iraqi Shore Battery, H ,M, S, 'Deptford !f thereafter proceeded to her anchorage as previously arranged alongside the Jetty of the 20^ Squadron at Margil. The Mutasarrif of ^asra Liwa then proceeded on board ship to pay his Shaikh official call on His Excellency/Sir Hamad bin Ssa Alkhalifa, K.C.I,E,, and to welcome him on behalf of his Government to Iraq, Upon his departure he received a seven gun salute from S,K.S,'Dept ford n . t wKit ^ sv; \ • -Vf )v IK \ V- -2~ Immediately thereafter, the Acting British Consul went on board to pay his official call on His Excellency on behalf of His Britannic Majesty's Government, On departure, he also received a seven gun salute from ll • JjjL • S ^Deptfiord' 1 . Thereupon the Port Director and Director General of Navigation, Colonel J.C.Ward, C.I.B., D•b.0., M.B.E., arrived on board li.M. S. 'Deptf ord ,f also to pay his respects to His Excellency the Sheikh. Thereafter His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad left H.M.S.'Deptford', when he was given a salute of eleven guns cy that ship. He then proceeded by launch, (placed specially at his disposal by the Port Authorities), to the British Consulate Jetty, where cars were await- ing him and his suite to take them to the Mutasarrif's Office in order to return that official s call. A guard of honour mounted there was inspected by the Sheikh. Following his visit there, he returned bv car to the Consulate where he paid hishis return call on the Acting British Consul. He thereafter returned to H.M.S. 'Deptford' when he hade goodbye to the Commanding Officer and other Officers of that ship. He then proceeded along with his suite to the Railway i erminal Rest House, Margil, where he (and suite) were the guests of the Iraq Government until their departure from Basra. At 5 P.M. the Acting British Consul proceeded in the Consulate launch to Maro-il where at that hour he met His Excellency and Staff at No.4 Pier. His Excellency, accompanded by his two sons, Mr. and Mrs. Belgrave, the Acting British Consul, and an Iraqi Police Inspector, then proceeded by launc/i, again T)laced at their disposal by tne Fort Director and Director General of Navigation, to the Mutasarrif's Jetty where they di s emba r k e d. In t rdduc ti o11 s over, the whole party proceeded to the Ilutasarrif 1 s residence alongside, where a large party of notables, bobii Iiacji and British, were assembled to meet His Excellency.The Kntasarrif's reception lasted for about an hour. During the reception Sheikh Hamad moved about freely among the assembled guests who were all in turn introduced to him by the Mutasarrif. The reception over, the Sheikh accom panied the Maqib of Basra to his resi dence, presumably for prayers, later returning by car to the Terminal Rest House at Margil* The Acting British Consul thereupon invited a large party of British officials and civilians to the Consulate in order to meet Mr. and Mrs.^elgrave. This unofficial reception lasted for about an hour, when Mr. and Mrs. ^elgrave returned to the Terminal ^est House at Margil in the Acting Consul's car. This was followed by a large dinner party in honour of the Sheikh*s visit at the Rest House, and which was attended by Iraqi notables only. At about 10 P.M. His Excellency the Sheikh, accompanied by Mr.^elgrave and the Acting British Consul, proceeded to the Railway Station. The Station was illimimated in the Sheikh's honour, and a red carpet was laid from the entrance leadingleading direct to the special coach reserved for him on his journey to Baghdad. The Sheikh held animated conversation in his coach for a long time with the large number of Iraqi notables he had invited to speak with him. Shortly before 11 P.M., (the time of departure of the train), he left his saloon coach and bade goodbye to the Mutasarrif, the Acting British Consul, and others assembled to see him off at the station. A guard of honour presented arms as the train left. His Excellency the Sheikh was accompanied throughout the day^ programme by Mr. C.D.Belgrave, Adviser to the Bahrain Government. /Sheikfe Sir Hamad, if 1 may be allowed to mention it, created a most favourable impression among all he came in contact with while in Basra. He left, apparently thoroughly well pleased with his first official visit to Basra. Much credit is due to the following officials and others for making His ^ „| _ | | _ Excellency's visit the success it undoubtedly provec to be. (jirstly,, to the Mutasarrif for the excellent —~ ^ arrangements he made officially and privatelyprivately- for the Amir's visit. (Secondly), to the Port Director and his staff for providing the necessary river transport and also as Director of Railways for arranging for the comfort of the Sheikh's travel by rail to Baghdad; (British and Iraqi railway officials as well as a Police escort accompanied His Excellency by rail to Baghdad in order to ensure his comfort^;. (Thirdly), to the Customs Director, for arranging the smooth working of his staff, in clearing the Sheikh's personal effects, arms, etc. (Fourthly), to the Acting British Consul, for arranging officially and unofficially the programme in connection with the visit in conjunction with the Mutasarrif, the Port Director and the Officer Commanding, H.M, S. f 'Deptford' (Lastly), to the Commanding Officer of II. 11. S ^'Deptfor d' for the excellent manner in which he arranged to carry out the programme here on the arrival of his ship, in conjunction with the Acting British Consulj and which went off without a single hit6h. &lt;f At about 8.3O on the morning of the 7th instant, I was advised by telephone that the traintrain on which His Excellency and suite were travelling to Baghdad had been held up at about 7 a.m. on account of the railway line having been breached slightly on account of flooding. At about 10.JO a.m., however, I received a further telephone message to the effect that His Excellency and suite had been safely transferred to another train which had left for Baghdad at aoout 9,a.m. From the foregoing you will gather that everything was done to make His Excellency's lirst oxiicial visit/ to ijasia as pleasurable and as memorable to him as possible.

DALRYMPLE BELGRAVE TO lil., M. J. JLAU30N, DATSD 33rd SEPTEMBER 1936« I have got a rather agitated message from the Shaikh complaining that a Syrian paper has published what is said to be a copy from Sunday Express of 28th June stating that he married at the London Mosque a Miss Clara Londman, an English society girl, Scottish, of great culture, wealth and high position' etc., etc. who is now the new ^Amira'* of Bahrain. Of course this is all rubbish but I have written for a copy of the paper to see if there is anything in it. Ap m-ently the Shaikh's picture and the lady's picture were published. de Grenier writes to me suggesting ''diplomatic action'* or 'a prosecution for libel'!Translation of an article published in the first ^7e o± Newspaper 'All-Suhafi al Taiah' of Beyrout No•^'7 dated 15th July 1936, The Amir or Bahrain anc. the beautiful Scottish lady« London is being visited today by the Amir of Bahrain, King of Pearls and Master of the Coast. The Amir of Bahrain, of the AlKhalifah family, is advanced in age. He might be in the sixtieth year of his age. He himself does not know exactly how many years he has lived, We said advanced in age, but he has the spirit of youth (green). He was able to increase the number of his lovely wives during his Inst visit to London. He has good taste and likes clean (beautiful) faces. He was able to add a new wife to the number of his wives. This wife is Miss Clara Lindman Scholar the well known youthiUl Scottish orientalist who became fond of Arab princes, their manners and customs. She was dreaming of becoming an Arab princess* This was brought into reality during the present visit of the Amir of Bahrain to London. She introduced herself to him, made herself charming and so made him love her. So he married her recently in a special ceremony held at the London Mosque in which the bride appeared wearing a ctess wholly covered with pearls. It is worth mentioning that Miss Clara Lindman Scholar is wealthy and holds a high position in the world of literature (in England). She formerly tried to approach King Faisal. She visited him in Iraq and tried to win his heart, but the pure monarch had not an adventurous spirit nor the desire for such a thing so he sent her back and she failed® She/She kept on trying more and more until she has become now the wife of Amir of Bahrain, King of Pearls and Master of the Coast as he is called 'by the ^Sunday Express' newspaper from which we picked this news#(py., stj~s, - 933/955/91) 3ritish Consulate-General, 0.3/1936.

Thib rag is owned and published by a Lebanese christian naniad Alexandre Riashi, and apoears daily or weekly accoi-ding to the state or the owners l inances. It is devoted entix^ely to gossip of the *&lt;ews ol the orld type about prominent personages, local and otherwise, written in an undeniably witty vein but descending to incredible depths of salaciousness. Its local circulation is fairly large, and I understand that the owner also makes a pretty little income from blackmailing Incal notables with threats of exposing in the paper some of their numerous vices. It is ? however, regarded merely as sauce to the dish of current journalism ana no one would dream of taking any ol its myriad stories seriously. I should therefore deprecate any attempt to take the Mi tor to task over this matter, as he would probably relish the idea thaiiie had annoyed the bheikh and would find an opportunity to enlarge the offence on another occasion, publicity being what he tnrives on. The article should in my opinion be allowed to sink into oblivion. Yours ever, (Sgd G.W. Furlonge. Brenan Ksq., O.b.K., Foreign Office.CONFIDENTIAL.
