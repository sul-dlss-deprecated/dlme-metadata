A noted figure in the field, she sketches out her career in refugee studies, and tells about being hired to launch a program at AUC and her role in teaching and fundraising for it. She discusses the Center for Forced Migration and Refugee Studies’ academic program, its contributions to the lives of refugees in Cairo, and how interactions with refugees (encouraged by the center’s location downtown) benefited students. She describes the students pursuing the program, and its directors and teaching faculty. The launch of Student Action for Refugees (STAR) is also mentioned. Harrell-Bond also comments on negative effects of the program’s increased emphasis on migration and its relocation to AUC’s suburban new campus, which she says prompted her to move on. Her role in the founding of AMERA (Africa and Middle East Refugee Assistance), and its relationships with AUC, its Law program, the Egyptian government, and international organizations like the United Nations, are also covered. Harrell-Bond also speaks about other university refugee studies programs around the world, the situation for refugees in Egypt, and events like the dispersal the 2004 refugee demonstration in Mohandiseen.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
