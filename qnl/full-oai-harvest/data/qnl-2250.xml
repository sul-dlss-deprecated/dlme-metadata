Between ff 47-52 these numbers have also been underlined. An additional incomplete foliation sequence is also present between ff 2-167; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled, and are located in the same position as the main sequence. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out. The exceptions being ff 47-52 where the previous sequence was not crossed out, as these folios consist of photographic prints.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains copies of correspondence on a range of subjects associated both directly and indirectly with events and the impact of the Second World War.
