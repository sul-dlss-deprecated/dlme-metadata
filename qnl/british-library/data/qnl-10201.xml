The Respectful Memorial of Sudashiv Rao Guicovxir (alias Rao Saheh), a resident of the City of Barodn SlTEWETH, i hat your Excellency s Memorialist lias heard with profound regret of the suspension of his uncle, His Highness Mulhar Rao Guicowar, from the exercise of Sovereign power, and of his con finement by the British Government on a charge of instigating an attempt to administer poison to Colonel Phayre, the late Resident at Baroda. 2. That as a member ot the Royal House ot Baroda ^our Excellency's Memorialist cannot but entertain the earnest desire that the stain of so foul a crime may not be fixed on any member of the Ivoyal family, and it would, indeed, give ^ our Excellency's Memorialist very threat satisfaction to learn that His 1 Ugliness has been found innocent of the very grave offence of which he has been suspected. 3. That in the event, however, of the inquiry into the said charge proving unfavorable to His Highness, and of his deposition being finally determined upon, your Excellency's Memorialist begs, on the faith of the gracious promise contained in Your Excellency's Proclamation of the 13th ultimo that a Native Administration will be re-established at Baroda, to urge his claim on Your Excellency's attention as the next legal heir to the Baroda Gadee. 4. That Your Excellency's Memorialist is the great-grandson of His Highness Govind Rao Maharaj, the grandfather of His Highness Mulhar Rao, at one time the ruling sovereign of Baroda, and a firm and faithful ally of the British Government. That when the said Govind Rao Maliaraj died, he left him surviving his three sons, Anund Rao, Futtehsing Rao (your Memorialist's grand father) and bayajee Rao. Anund Rao being the eldest of the sons succeeded to the Gadee ; but as he was of weak intellect, your Memorialist's grandfather Futtehsing Rao acted as his Regent. The important and valuable services which as such Regent the said Futtehsing Rao rendered to the British Government during their early days of conquest in India are well known facts of history. Futtehsing Rao, who by right was entitled to succeed Anund Rao on the Gadce, having died during Anund Rao's lifetime, your Memorialist's father Govind Rao was, as his duly adopted son, entitled to succeed him in all his rights on the well established principle of Hindu law that the right of an adopted son to succession is in every respect the same as that of a son born. The validity of the adoption of your Memorialist's father has been acknowledged both by the Highest British Authorities and by the Guicowar himself, as will be seen by the following passage from Lieut. Col. Wallaces book on 'The Guicowar,' page 577. The Court of Directors, in their Despatch of the 15th March, 184S, 'decided in Govind Rao's favor, on the grounds that he was rcgrllariy ad'opterl, and ' therefore entitled under our guarantee to all the rights appertaining to an adopted son. To this ' decision Gunpat Rao Guicowar, who had succeeded Sayajee, yielded a most reluctant assent; not, he ' explained, from avaricious motives, as the amount of property was so trifling, but because he feared ' that an admission on his part of the adoption of Govind Rao being valid would be brought up at ' some future time to bar the rights of his family to the Gadee.' On Anund Rao's death, however, your Memorialist's father being a boy of ten years old, Sayajee Rao, at first on his behalf, took the reius of administration into his hands, and a few months afterwards himself usurped the regalpower. When your Memorialist's father became of age he hotly contested Sayajee llao's claim; but Sayajee Rao having possession and being in favor with the British Resident, his efforts proved unavailing. Throughout life, however, Govind Rao did not fail to assert his right, and died under the firm belief that his right would one day be recognized by the British Government in favor of his sons. That the British Authorities themselves entertained a grave doubt as to the right of Sayajee Rao to succeed to the Gadee in preference to your Memorialist's father is evident from paragraph 31 of the Minute by the Honorable M. Elphinstone, dated April 18th, 1820, and quoted in pages 281 to 283 in the above named work by Lieut. Col. Wallace. The paragraph is as follows :— ' The widow of his (Sayajee Rao's) elder brother had been permitted by the British Resident to u adopt a son on the express condition of that son renouncing all right to the musnud derived from ' such adoption. Without this renunciation the adoption would have given to the adopted son an ' undoubted right to succeed to the musnud in preference to Sayajee himself. The adoption has it been completed, but no written acknowledgemont of the condition had yet been obtained from the tl relations of the adopted son. They were therefore at liberty fo say, and actually did say, that they ' had never heard of the condition, and that they conceived the adopted son to have succeeded to all tl the rights of his deceased father. To guard against such a pretension a paper had been drawa up u and signed by Captain Carnac (who, as the person who permitted the adoption, must best have il known the terms on which permission was granted), by which the relations of the adopted son re- il nounced all title derived from the adoption to succeed to the musnud. This paper the family refused ' to recognize, and the British Government solicited His Highness to acquiesce in the refusal. These ' proceedings obviously throw considerable doubt over Suyajee's title to the musimd. The mere omis- ' sion of so important a part of the agreement in the written instrument could not but give rise to ' doubts ; but the striking it out after it had been inserted by the Guicowar and signed by the 11 Resident amounted to y virtual abandonment of the condition which it contained, and left the 11 adopted son in possession of all his rights as much as if the renunciation had never been vien- iC .tioned. It is true that the Resident was authorised to assure Sayajee that the British Government u considered the adopted son to have renounced his title, and Sayajee, from hisr confidence in our ' power and good faith, might feel secure that the claim of the adopted son was not likely ever to 11 operate to his own exclusion from the musnud; but he could not fail to be conscious of the defect u in his title t and to be apprehensive of the advantage that might be taken of it under any future ' change of circumstances.' Notwithstanding repeated protests made by Govind Rao against him, Sayajee Rao was obliged to grant your Memorialist's family an annual allowance of Rupees 93000 out of the Khangi or personal fund set apart for the maintenance of the Guicowar and his family; and in a memorandum prepared by the then British Resident at Baroda and signed by Sayajee Rao himself that 'prince acknowledged Govind Rao and his heirs as the next in the line of succession, in default of lineal male descendants of his own body. It is also a fact well known to the people of Baroda that His Highness the late Khunde Rao Maharaj brought up your Memorialist ever since he was fourteen years of age as a member of his own houseliold, until the time of His Highness' death, that is, for about fourteen years with the avowed object of adopting your Memorialist as his son and successor to the Gadee. 5. YoUr Excellency's Memorialist, therefore, respectfully submits to Your Excellency that in accordance with Hindu law, your Memorialist is the rightful heir to the incumbency of the Gadec. Your Memo«alist, however, has a further claim as the representative of the heirs of Malojee (the nephew of Damajee and brother of Peelajee the adopted son of the said Damajee) through your Memorialist's father Govind Rao, son of Gunpat Rao and Grandson of Malojee, which Govind Rao, as has just been stated, was adopted by Futtehsing Rao, the direct lineal descendant of fhfe said Peelajee Guicowar. Your Memorialist's claim in this respect is well stated by Lieut. Col. Barton, late Assistant Resident at Baroda, in his report to Government on the Baroda guarantees, and quoted as follows in Lieut. Col. Wallace's Work, page 570—' The child selected for adoption was Govind u Rao, the son of Gunpat Rao Guicowar, who was a grandson of Malojee, the brother of Peelajee, 11 of whom the reigning family were direct descendants. Should therefore the male issue of Peelajee u fail, the descendants of Gunpat Rao would have the strongest claim to the Gadee' This viewiias been, your Memorialist hears, supported by each of the successive British Residents at Baroda Colonel Barr, Colonel Shortt, and Colonel Phayre, in their annual reports to Government. 6. Your Excellency's Memorialist respectfully solicits the attention of your Excellency to the accompanying genealogical table, which clearly shows your Memorialist's two-fold right of succession to the Baroda Gadee, first, as the great-grandson of Govind Rao Maharaj, and secondly, as the eldest of Malojee's surviving heirs. 7. Your Excellency's Memorialist craves leave to submit to your Excellency that the son of Luxmibai, being illegitimate, can have no claim whatsoever to the Gadee. Luxmibai is not, accord ing to Maratha law and precedent, a lawful wife, her former husband being still alive, and having, immediately before her marriage with His Highness Mulhar Rao, filed a suit for the restitution of conjugal rights, which is still pending. It is an undisputed fact that Luxmibai was in an advanced state of pregnancy when she went through the ceremony of marriage ; and such a marriage, your Excellency's Memorialist submits, is quite illegal according to Hindu Law and the custom of the Guicowar s family. Luxmibai not being also a Maratha woman, her issue illegitimate, on the same principle that Balvant Rao Guicowar, son of His Highness Anund Rao Maharaj by his Rajput wife Tukhtbaee, was considered to be illegitimate, and was debarred from succeeding to the Gadee, (vide Lieut. Col. Wallace's work, page 581). It is a well known fact that for this marriage His Highness Mulhar Rao stands excommunicated from his caste to the present day. For the reasons above stated the- son of Luxmibai has not been recognized as a member of the Guicowar's family by any relations of the Guicowar nor by the nobility and gentry of Baroda. The illegal marriage too, was performed in spite of the serious warnings and remonstrances of the British Government, who have justly refused to recognize the child as His Highness' son. A grave doubt also exists about both the genuinenofts and paternity of this child. 8. Lnder all these circumstances your Excellency's Memorialist respectfully begs that your Excellency will be pleased, if the question of selecting the future Ruler of the Baroda Territories has to be considered, to entertain jour Memorialist's claim; and should any doubt arise in your Excellency's mind in regard to your Memorialist's right of succession as the next legal heir to the Gadee of Baroda after Mulhar Rao, your Memorialist trusts that your Excellency will, when deciding the question of succession to the same, be graciously pleased to allow your Memorialist an opportunity of being heard on the subject through an agent or advocate before your Excellency's CounciJ. 9. In seeking to occupy the proud position of Maharaja of Baroda your Excellency's Memo rialist is actuated not only by a belief that he is merely asking for his rights, but by an earnest desire to do whatever in him lies for the happiness and prosperity of the people, who under the Providence of God, would be subjected to his rule. Your memorialist is now thirty-two years of age. He resides in Baroda, and has done so for many years. He is acquainted with the wants, the wishes, and the character of the people; he knows ; too, the condition of the country and its excellent capabilities for becoming a wealthy and prosperous state ; and if placed on the Gadee it would be his firm purpose, as it is his earnest desire, to rule over his fellow-countrymen with wisdom, justice, and moderation, and to maintain the most friendly relations towards, and act under the advice of the Government of Her Gracious Majesty the Queen, which, he is sure, has ever at heart the interest and welfare of the people of India. And Your Excellency s Memorialist shall as in duty bound ever pray.

Your Fxcelleney's Memorialist craves leave to submit to your Excellency that the son of LiUxmibai, being illegitimate, can have no claim whatsoever to the Gadee. Luxmibai is not, accord ing to Maiatlia law and piecedent, a lawful wife, her former husband being still alive, and having, immediately before her marriage with His Highness Mulhar Rao, filed a suit for the restitution of conjugal lights, which is still pending. It is an undisputed fact that Luxmibai was in an advanced state of pregnancy when she went through the ceremony of marriage ; and such a marriage, your Excellency's Memorialist submits, is quite illegal according to Hindu Law and the custom of the Guicowar s family. Luxmibai not being also a Maratha woman, her issue is illegitimate, on the same principle that Balvant Rao Guicowar, son of His Highness Anund Rao Maharaj by his Rajput wife Tukhtbaee, was considered to be illegitimate, and was debarred from succeeding to the Gadee, (vide Lieut. Col. Wallace's work, page 581). It is a well known fact that for this marriage His Highness Mulhar Rao stands excommunicated from his caste to the present day. For the reasons above stated the son of Luxmibai has not been recognized as a member of the Guicowar's family by any relations of the Guicowar nor by the nobility and gentry of Baroda. The illegal marriage too, was performed in spite of the serious warnings and remonstrances of the British Government, who have justly refused to recognize the child as His Highness' son, A grave doubt also exists about both the genuineness and paternity of this child. 8. Under all these circumstances your Excellency's Memorialist respectfully begs that your Excellency will be pleased, if the question of selecting the future Ruler of the Baroda Territories has to be considered, to entertain your Memorialist's claim; and should any doubt arise in your Excellency's mind in regard to your Memorialist's right of succession as the next legal heir to the Gadee of Baroda after Mulhar Rao, your Memorialist trusts that your Excellency will, when deciding the question of succession to the same, be graciously pleased to allow your Memorialist an opportunity of being heard on the subject through an agent or advocate before your Excellency's Council. 9, In seeking to occupy the proud position of Maharaja of Baroda your Excellency's Memo rialist is actuated not only by a belief that he is merely asking for his rights, but by an earnest desire to do whatever in him lies for the happiness and prosperity of the people, who under the Piovidence of God, would be subjected to his rule. Your memorialist is now thirty-two years of age. He resides in Baroda, and has done so for many years. He is acquainted with the wants, the wishes, and the character of the people; he knows ; too, the condition of the country and its excellent capabilities for becoming a wealthy and prosperous state ; and if placed on the Gadee it would be his firm purpose, as it is his earnest desire, to rule over his fellow-countrymen with wisdom, justice, and moderation, and to maintain the most friendly relations towards, and act under the advice of, the Government of Her Gracious Majesty the Queen, which, he is sure, has ever at heart the interest and welfare of the people of India. And \our Excellency s Memorialist shall as in duty bound ever pray. Baroda, C 1875.
