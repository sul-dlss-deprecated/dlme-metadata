UDHSXfKACTS FPOM A ^KPOHT OF AS KXFKDITIOS TO* SHOWAMIYAH BY THE COMMAKDXNO OFFIC R f H.M.:;. DEPTFORD, WSRIHG TH?. r- FlOD MAPCH - APRIL, 1958. X x X X X REPORT OK tHU-AMIYAH EX?K I,;IT1QN . ; ('DRPTFwRD'S' Ko. 59 dated let May 1938). i The object of the expedition was to construct a fuel store at SHUWAMIYAH on the S.outh Arabian Coast. 2. SHU A .IYAH is on the northern shorr of KHORYA MORYA bay end 3 miles to the westward of the dark point of SHUWAJiXYAH; a landing ground was marked out there in December, 1956. A fuel store ^ae required at this landing ground to complete the chain of fuellin stations on the h'V Q(\T - AD,A route, as the stage between M A3 IRA and MERBAT might be too Ion* if aircraft of low endurance had to use this route. 3. As SHOWAMIYAH is difficult to reach except by see. Air Headquarters IRAQ obtained the co-operation of an escort vessel and the *DH^TFORD' was detailed to transport the expedition. POLITICAL PCIITICN . 4. The Sultan of Muscat's representative had agreed to the building of a petrol store at SHU&lt;AMIYaK, but he would not be responsible for the attitude of the local tribesmen. This was because the Sultan’s control is purely nominal south of SOR except for the DOFAR administration. 5. It was therefore necessary ior the Political Agent MUSCAT to accompany the expedition and to bring a represents!ive of the MUbCAT Government with him. 6. From a political point of view the n DE TTORD' was required to remain at SHUTAMIYAH to cover the construction of the fuel store and to eccemraodete British subjects who were not to be allowed to sleep onshore. PRaLIMIiUKY M0V;-M .NTJ . 7. The DEPTFORD arrived at ’4U3CAT to embark the expedition on 10th March but due to causes unconnected with the expedition we were not able to sail until 13th March. 8. The expedition sailed just before midnight 13th/14th M rrch. Onboard DSPTFOPD we had ^ajor R#P. atts, the Political Agent, MUSCAT, and the V5ali of SIB representing the MUSCAT government. Also Flight Lieutenant Becher as Air Staff Officer to the expedition and Mr. Reid of the Air Ministry Directorate of rcorks. In tow of DEPTFORD was a dhow of 75 tone burthen carrying the building materials and the working party of 81. Details are shown in Appendix I■£A^ QK Tv sHWAttUM . 9. The trip to &amp;BUWAMIYAH a distance of 590 miles took 114 hours steaming an average of only 5 knots* At the start 8 knots was made good but when the wind became force 5 revolutions had to be reduced to 4 knots and leas than 8 knots could be rapde good, I consider that this average speed is all that can be relied on with even a moderate sea, whatever its direction. XX xx 10. A halt of four hours was made at MAHUT to enable the Political Agent to go ashore to see the paramount Shaikh of the Jenabeh tribe who is usually to be found in this place. The lhaikh, however, ha* left a short time previously for the Hadramut. AH RIVAL -'’-T BHIKAaiYA H. 11. *DEPTmRD H anchored off SHUWAMIYAH landing ground at 0815 on 19th March, about 4 cr.Mes from the shore. The dhow anchored between us and the shore and the working r-arty, the camp and a few stores were landed during the day in the 2 nourfe, in spite of a considerable surf. The houris were indispensable on this and subsequent days; we had the beat hour! crews in MUSCAT and their skill in handling their boats was remarkable. In addition during the days when the stores were being got ashore they worked themselves, wet th ough oil day, until they were exhausted. 12. The site selected for the store fortunately had a rock foundation about a foot under the surface and stone for the building could be quarried nearby. Rapid progress was made and the large working party at all times worked hard and cheerfully. I consider this was principally due to Mr. Reid's untiring efforts. He was ashore working in the eun from 0800 to 17to daily and as the coolies were paid by the day it was possible to work them for seven days a week.* AIR OPERATION^ . 13. Maila and fresh vegetables were transported by air from Muscat to Shuwamiyah. The weekly supply of vegetables weighed about 1400 lbs. and with the limited load of the type of machine available - Vincents - entailed a big flying programme. The Vincents had to refuel at M sirs on the way and as there is no labour there the crew have to refuel themae ves froia two gallon tins. They usually smarted at about 0800 and arrived about 1600 ao the flight between Muscat and ohuwamiyah means a long and ti-in; day. 14. In addition to the «lr supply trips two ilights were made to Balala fo^* political purposes. Approximately 133 hours flying was* carried out for the expedition not including the flights between IRAQ and MUSCAT; t is programme was organised by flight Lieutenant Bechcr in an extremely helpful manner.1SI£,. T 2 15. As soon as all the stores were ashore anfl the building was well und*r way we had to decide when to fetch the petrol and oil from Merbst to stock the new store. The possibility of sending the dhow on and proceeding later in the ship to tew the dhow backhnd been suggested in our instructions. The Navigating Officer end I therefore went to inspect the dhow to se? if this would be possible. Th&amp; DHu&gt;. 16. The I«arkhoda told us that his regular run was fcombay - Kutah - Karachi - Muscat and that he was unable to navigate elsewhere. He was also nervous about being left alone on the Arabian coast without the protection of a warship. e looked at his aids to navigation and found that his only chart was the Indian Ocean (Northern sheet), his chronometer was old and broken an * the scale of his sextant so tarnished that only a email arc could be read. Although he only had a 1937 Almanac his work book showed that he took meridian sigh's on his regular run but was quite unable to obtain a longitude. Iftherefore a dhow is required to travel alone, it is essential to hire a local boat familiar with the required passage. 17. It wae therefore essential to choose a date immediately after en air supply trip so that we should be back at Shuwamiyah before the next plane was due to a rive. We therefore decided on 89th March, and sailed at 1800 on that day with the dhow in tow. MMMl- 18. Ve arrived at Merbat at 0640 the following morning having been able to average 8 knots in a calm sea. A working party was landed in the 8 houris and the fuel embarked from the Merbat store. 19. ihen the Wall came off to call he brought a large number of followers who in their democratic way joined in our conversation. The ^ali had never been on board a British man-of-war before, though he had visited a French one some years ago. The whole party were v:ry interested in being shown round the ship. 20. «e sailed from Merbat at 1830 on 89th March and were back at Shuwamiyah by 0545 next morning. iiOLITICAI, r 0 .. 1 Tl uN 1 &gt; ohUitAMi lnh uI^Tuibl . 81. The Bhueamlyah district is not nominally inhabited and contains no villages or dwellings. Actually on our arrival a few bedouins were on the beach and more a T rived during the first few days. Among these was a man who claimed to be the local Shaikh. 3 or 4 mi lea from the landing ground there are a number of cave dwellings which are used at some seasons of the ytar by tribesmen who come to ShuwamiyRh for the fishing; but for the greater pert of the summer months the locality is deserted.22. On the 27th March the Political A&lt;&lt;ent had been to Salala by air to arrange with the Wali of Dhofar to send An official of his administration to bhuwamiyah to aeeist in identilying the local Shaikh* This official*as embarked while we were at M er t&gt; a t and was later retu- ned to l alala by air* XXX X COM., L&amp;TICK OF .

When we picked up the dhow again two doya later she had only advanced 32 miles; a loud chant of thanksgiving broke out as we got her in tow. The chant was renewed when Muscat was sighted and we entered harbour with the whole working party cheering. After the long outward passage in bad weather this was the right note to end on. X x X X COMMUNICATIONS . 32. While the aircraft were in flight the procedure laid down in 8 18/34 was carried out by BiiPTFCRD. Communication with Muscat on 13,333 k/cs was satisfactory, but it was distinctly unreliable with the aircraft on this frequency and was only possible when the plane was within 100 miles of the ship. It la suggested that this iss due to the screening effect of the hills surrounding SHU-AMIYAH.(9 (A) T '-Klli't .ACT IN TK -.ii—: a,&amp; ACCOMMODATE) .

The Hon’ble ti-e Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire• Expedition to build petrol store at Shuwaimiyah. i have the honour to submit herewith a report on the combined Naval, Air Force and Political expedition to Shuw&amp;imiy&amp;h. The purpose of the expedition was to build a petrol store at khuv.aimiyah on the emergency landing ground at that place which had been made by a similar expedition which tooic place in .November 1936. 2. The date originally fixed for the start of the expedition from Muscat was March xOth but owing to certain unforeseen urgent political matters unconnected with the actual expedition the departure had to be delayed until the evening of iStii narch. un that date H.ii.S. Deptford which, as for last year’s expedition, had been detailed as the escort sloop, sailed with the following persons on board:* .Lieutenant J.H. Becher, R.A.F ,, Air Ctt*ff Head quarters Dhibban, Uaison Officer, Mr. H.G. Reid of the orks and Buildings depart ment of the Air Ministry, »ho waa2 @ who was in actual charge of the building operations, Major H.P, Aatts, political -^gent, Muscat, and Shaikh Salim bin Humaid the Heprcsentative of the Muscat Government. A large dhow, procured with some difficulty since euch vessels are rarely available for hire at short notice, which curried various n&amp;terial required for the construction of the store and some seventy five coolies recruited locally, was taken in tow by Deptford. nearly opposite the southern extremity of Maslrah Island was reached and 1 went ashore with the object of seeing bfcaikh Said bin Sultan, the paramount chief of tiwe most of the tribes in habiting the coastal belt between Jjasirah Island and the &amp; Shuw&amp;imiyah district and whose headquarters are at Mahut. The Shaikh, however, had left a short time previously for the Hadhraxaaut. of disembarking coolies and stores started immediately. A few of the local inhabitants who happened to be present were friend able stone for quarrying for the walls of the petrol shed was found within a few yards of the edge of the landing ground and this fact contributed in sq small measure to it being possible to complete the building within the short available period of three weeks allowed for the work. appeared, who claimed to be the Shaikh of the local tribe in- as the Batahrah, are a branch of the Jena bah of which Shaikh Said bin Sultan is the paramount chief but declared that his un March 16th Mahut, a small fishing port situated On March 19th Shuwaimiyah was reached and the work ly and offeree no objection to the landing. Fortunately suit on 2ist an individual named Muhammad bin Sulaiyim habiting the aistrict. he stated that his tribe who are known particularparticular section had always been independent and had never been in any way under that person's control or authority. The Sultan had sometime previously informed me in the course of conversation that the claim of Said bin Sultan to be the paramount chief of the tribes inhabiting the coastal regions inclusive of Shuw&amp;imiyah was so far as that place was concerned incorrect* although the Muscat Government had* on both the 1934 and 1936 expeditions to these parts* acknowledged his control of all the district bordering the sea between Masirah island and the northern limits of the province of Dhofar. The explanation of this confusion is of course that the Muscat authorities have little xno*ledge of conditions prevailing in those numerous portions of their territory over which they have no effective control* 6. Since it was clearly important to ascertain who in reality was the Bhaiich of the Shuwaimiyah district i had arranged with the Sultan's Representative previous to the start of the expedition that an official of the Dhofar administration should be picked up there and taxon to Shuwaimiyah to endeavour to establish hie identity. Taking advantage of the presence of two Vincent aircraft, which under similar arrangements to those made on the 1936 expedition to Ahor Gkarim and Ghuvaimiyah had provisions been detailed U&gt; convey mails and fresh prwhaianx from Muscat* i proceeded to Salalah on 27tn march by Air accompanied by lieutenant beoher* R.A.F. It was arranged with the *all of Dhofar to whom 1 had brought a letter for this purpose from the Sultan's Representative and who was suited to have had extensive knowledge of the district and tribes we were dealing with* that a certain State official named All Assiyabi should be sent to Murbat and thenoe taken by Deptford to Shuwaimiyah on her coming visit to that port to transport petrol and oil to stock the new storage shed. ..hile at Salalah the new petrol store under cons* truotion by the Muscat State authorities for the use of the RoyalRoyal Air Force was insted and found to be practically completed and apparently well constructed, it *as explained to the official entrusted with the work xx -^aji Zubair, formerly head of the Muscat he gal Administration - what were the extra dimensions necessary for the increased capacity of the store as had been recently decided upon by Air Headquarters Iraq and arrmade for the necessary additions to be made for this purpose to the building. A full report on this matter is* i understand* bein^ submitted by hieutenant hecher to Air Headquarters at Dhibban. Lieutenant Becher and i returned to Shuwaimiyah the same day* 7. As tiie political situation at Shuwaimiyah had from the beginning been quiet and satisfactory and the work on the petrol store had advanced to a stage which allowed Mr.Reid to leave it to be proceeded with by the workmen, Deptford sailed on 23th for Murbat which was reached the next day* After loading 600 odd tins of petrol and taxen on board All as Siyabi the Bhofar official referred to in paragraph t above Deptford left Murbut on 2*&gt;th March and returned once more to Bhuwaimiyah on 30th. 6, Muhammad bin bulaiyim the alleged chief of the Batahrah tribe who had left Shttwaiaiyah on private affairs lor a few days sncrtly afterwards reappeared on the scene and was at once recognised by the Jhofar official as being in reality the ohaixh of the iribe. it was also corroborated by tnat official that the Bat&amp;hrah are not under the control or authority of Bhaixh baid bin &amp;uitan vide paragraph b supra* Discussions ..ere accordingly started with Muhammad bin Bulaiyim for an agreement for the rent of the landing ground and custody of the petrol store. After the usual haggling an agreement was made and signed under which in return for a yearly payment of $ 120 per annum the 6tiai&lt;h agreed toagreed to look after the landing ground /Larking® and the petrol store with its contents situated thereon* A copy of this agreement is attached as an appendix to this report. Ahen the landing ground was constructed in 1^36 an agreement was made for payment of # 100 per annum for the rent of the ground alone, Tide my letter «o. 104 dated 15th December 1936. a p%rol store has now been constructed and stocked with fuel so I think that an additional sum of only £5 20 per annum for the custody of the building is quite a reasonable one to pay. H should be realised, however, that though the words * care and safe custody'* are used in the agreement it is not practical to apply the proper sense of them too literally in this connection. Shuwaimiyah is one of the many wild and lawless districts cf the Muscat State where the Sultan's Government has little or no authority. This neighbourhood is far most of the sumner months reported to be eserted. During the winter small parties of the Batahrah tribe are usually to be found living in oaves in the vicinity ol the landing ground* Their principal occupation there is iiohing partially for food but chiefly for export from Murbat and Sur via Masirah. in addition to the seasonal visits of the local tribesmen the Shuwaimiyah district is traversed by odd travellers on the overland route between Dhofar and the southern portions of Oman and Sur. Money paid to local Shaikhs or their followers ior so cabled rent of pieces of worthless desert wasteland is of course nothing more than a form of bribery and the most that can be hoped for is that deliberate damage to the landing ground^ markings and any building thereon will be thusthus avoided 10. The Shaikh of Ghuwuimiyah was clax&amp;ourin^ for some money for himself and his followers and the question had to be decided since it was evident that disastrous results would follow failure to uKuce some sort of payramt# what form this should take. uy first inclination wac to *«y the bhaikh the 0 100 due for the rent of the landing ground agreed upon in 1936 between Shaikh Said bln Sultan and myself and not hitherto paid to that individual partially beeause he had been apparently Xxam too lazy to come to the Agency and claim it and also because in the conversation X had on the subject with the Sultan referred to in paragraph 5 above His Highness had expressly requested ms not to pay the Shaikh. In accordance with your instructions given to me when in iiuocat in February X had been prepared to give the rent for last year to Shaikh Said bin Sultan as a safeguard against possible future mischief on his patt should he press strongly for it when 1 went to see him at his headquarters at Mahut on my way down to Shuwaimiyah. However*as has been already mentioned* Shaikh Sold was not at J&amp;ahut when 1 called. 1 then decided that should subsequent events indicate the advislbillty of paying some sum of money to Shaikh a aid to 'buy his off* it would be useful to have the amount of last /ear's rent in hand for the purpose. Accordingly in the agreement X made with the Shaikh of Shuwaimiyah ^which X should mention was approved of by Air Force Headquarters vide their telegram Ho. A3S5 dated 6th April 1938 to Lieutenant Hecher, K.A.F.j the payment of the sum of 0 120 was laid down as being the rent for the ground and safe custody of the markings and petrol store thereon for twelve months in advance to take effect from the date of signature i.e. 1st April 1938. 11. In addition to the payment of 0 120 as one year'si -■ Il - 7 - A rent in adrance certain otnor expenses had to be incurrec tor the political buccess of the expedition. Details of expenditure, which i made every effort to keep as low as possible and which I do not think is unreasonable, will be found in Appendix b of the report and will 1 trust be approved of, it will be seen that a total of Rs 415/- in clusive of the year’s rent paiu in advance were Spent and i presume, that as in the case of the 1936 expedition to Khur viharim and Shuwaimiyah this amount will be borne by \ir i'orce Headquarters Iraq, 1^, The petrol store was completed on April 4th and thee xpedition broxe up on that date, Deptford sailing for liueoat with the dhow ana coolies in tow and Lieutenant Beoher, K.a.^. , ana myself returning in two Vincents uy air.

A well built petrol store has been constructed on an exceixtuit landing ground and what is of perhaps equal vaiue satisibetory and friendly relatione have been established with the local inhabitants on what is now considered an important air route.

I have the honour toDsnci!di)e~~egpy o|r a letter No. 104 dated the 15th December 1936, with enclosures, from the Political Agent, Muscat, reporting on the .Royal Air Force reconnaissance to hauqrah and Kuria Maria Bays carried out under his auspices. The object of this important reconnaissance was to improve the Aden-Muscat strategical air route by aking serviceable the landing ground previously established at Sauqrah Bay, and by constructing an additional landing ground between Khor Gn^rira and wurbat, thus continuing and completing the work of the reconnaissance successfully carried out by Major Breamer in 1934, vide my letter No. U49-3 of the 6th December of that year. As will be seen, the present reconnaissance was equally successful. 2. ‘tfith regard to the difficulties of such a reconnaissance in the area concerned I cannot do better than quote paragraph 3 of njy letter quoted above: 11 *fhile none of the air facilities along the Arab Coast have been required easily that at Squqrah presented special difficulties. A glance at the roap will snow that this area must be one of the most inaccessible anywhere on the /\r;*bian coast. Nominally under the Sultan /- 2 - ••Sultan of Muscat it is in fact under no authority whatever except that of the local lihaiichs, wtose tribesmen are more than ordinarily wild, suspicious and jealous of their independence. before the reconnaissance could be undertaken contact had to be imde with the-e dhaikhs, in itself by no means an ei.sy matter, and even when this was effected and the reconnaissance party - with the cJhaikhs • had arriveu at Sauqrah Bay, it will be seen from Major Bremner's report (paragraphs ll, 13, 14 and 18) that the attitude of the tribesmen was at times distinctly uncompromising,' 3. On this occasion the ground had been broken by the previous reconnaissance, and no hostility was shown by the local tribes, whose attitude was neutral at dauqrah Bay, and frienily at Khor Ghar im. The only disgruntled individuals were two Shaikhs who visited their liege lord the Sultan of rue cat, at Salalah, (vide paragraph 16 of Major -/atts' letter), hoping for handsome cash presents, and who were rewarded at sunset (it was amazan) by a drink of the milk of iialf a cocoanut each. As Major /atts remarks, cocoanuts are cheap at Salalah. 4. The fact, however, that the reconnaissance was carried out without incident in no way detracts from the credit due to Major fatts for its successful conclusion. There is an excellent saying that 'the bad traveller carries his adventures with him', and Major Vatts carried none with him on this occasion. As 1 wrote (vide paragraph 4 of my letter already quoted) I have had some personal experience of obtaining air facilities in the area concerned, and can thus appreciate the difficulties which had to /I* A -3- to be overcoine* 5. Major -vatts display0 some commendable anxiety on the subject of the expenses he had to incur (paragraphs 21 - 22) # and T have reassured him on the subject. Considering the importance of the results achieved the sum expended on presents to Shaikhs and tribesmen, local labour etc. some Rs.20 00/- was certainly not excessive, and I imagine compares not un favourably with similar expenditure elsewhere made for similar objects. I am sure that, as Major Vatts suggests, the loyal Air Verce authorities would contribute half the auia, or perhaps the whole, but in view of the small sum involved I am making no move in this direction. The ’pepper corn' rent of vs.ioo/- per annum for each of the two landing grounds (paragraph 18 of Major Watts’ letter) seems to be a wise provision. 6. I fully endorse the views expressed by Major htts in paragraph 23 of his letter as to the services rendered by Commander Bowldy and the Officers of H.M.S.Deptford, and by Squadron Leader Nioholetts and the section of the Royal Air Force under his command. These ’’combined exercises n , involving in this part of the world activities by Officers of the Navy, the Royal Air Force* and the Political Department, can only be carried out smoothly and successfully by the closest and friendliest co-operation between all concerneu, and it is most gratifying to be able to record another instance of this co-operation of which there have bean mny in the past. 7# Apart from the establishment of the land grounds, the reconnaissance served the very useful puipose (vide paragraph 18 of &gt;!ajor /atts* letter) of establishing friendly relations with the paramount Shaikh, and local tribesmen, of-4- the territory in queation, anti towards thia end tne medical work carried out by Surgeon lieutenant Cook ot H#M#^.Deptford (vide paragraphs 6 # 13 and 23 of ] r a j or /att-sI * letter; contributed not a little* It is pleas' nt to think that the inhabitants of the desolate areas visited by the reconnaiss ance will associate it not only with the making of landing grounds but also with humt^nitarian activities carried out for their benefit.

To The Hon'ble the Political Heaiuent in the rersian liulf, a_..q o H 1 it i»rith reference to correspondence ending with your telegram Ao. 86^ of 9tn December 1936, 1 have the honour to forward, herewith, a report on the Hoyal air Poree expedition to Sauqrah Bay and kuria Kuria Bay (bhawaimiya) • ^• during the first ivir Porce reconnaissance of dauqrah Bay in 1933 the kuscat Government had sent oaiyid kahmud, a member of the Billing family, to act as their Bepresentative and as I understood that he was of consider able assistance on that occas n every way in dealing witn the loc ii i-iihabitants, i asked for his services, or that oi another of the Kuling fsiuily, to be placed at our disposal this year. Unfortunately the Muscat Government without stating any reasons declared that they were unable to comply with my request. A report on this subject is being submitted separately. B.M.3. 'i^eptford* arrived at Muscat on 16th November and sailedthe same evening with the following persons on board; squadron1 - 2 - 5TJ ^quacLron/L«ad«r Nicoletts f iioyal Air jp'orc* ^taff Officer, Air Force Htadquartera, Hinaidi, Lieut. Haaler, &amp;.L., Attached forks and BuiXuiog, iioyal Air Force, The Political Agent, The Agency Interpreter and fall kuadafar, the Hepresentative of the Muscat Government. A dhow containing some coolies and material for the repair and construction of the Landing grounds ' was taken in tow. 4. 'Deptford* arrived off Bur on the morning of 17th and took on hoard dheikh dalim head of the Puwarls, a sub section of the denabeh tribe inhabiting ^auqrah Bay district and, Bheikh tfasir, a petty sheikh of the Arama section of the Jenabeh tribe but reported to have considerable influence amongst the local tribesmen, together with six of their respective followers. The presence of these two Ghelkhs with the expedition was considered by the Muscat Government to be essential should it have been impossible to obtain the services of Lheikh Bald the paramount chief of the tribes of the areas to be visited vide my telegram No. 93 of 10th November 1936. 5. On arrival at Mahut on November 18th it was found that dheikh aaid was present and he was accordingly embarked in 'Deptford' accompanied by his two sons and four followers, according to dheikh Bald's statement the letter which the Buitan's Representative had promised to send off in August (vide my letter No, 2/84 of 26th September 1936) instructing him to be present at Mahut on 10th November to join the expedition had never reached him and he was about to leave on a trip into the interior when the second letter obtained from the Muscat Government in October and sent by special messenger from im from i»ur, arriv«a. &amp;iiur uharla waa reached on the morning of the lath and the «iheikh&amp; and their followers were first landed to get into touch with the local tribesmen, a few fisher men and herdawen were met who showed themselves quite irienaly so the coolies and stores were disembarked and a camp pitched near the shore. iJuring the next ana following days numbers of the local inhabitants visited the camp though they were never more than 50 - 60 present at any one time. These were all of the Jenabeh tribe and at no time w*/*-there the least signs of hostility. Visitors to the camp were given food and excellent relations maintained throughout our stay, wommanaer jaowlby kindly allowed the burgeon oi the 'Oeptford' to treat a number of sick persons of tne trioes people and this action contributed in no small degree to maintain and increase the friendly atmosphere 7# handing ground which is situated some three quarters of a mile from the shore was found to require a good deal of work in levelling and removing stunted scrub and numerous small sand drifts which had become piled up on it. The damage to the markings on the ground was seen to have been comparatively small ana mostly confined to one of th. corner angle* which had been completely broken up. lying iioat from 20 j uquadron arrived on the 19th iiovember from kuacat bringing mail and fresh provisions ior tne ‘^eptford’*. Squadron Leader flicoletts left in it the same day to carry out an aerial reconnaissance of the Coast to the ^outh with a view to selecting two new landing ^rounds, after proceeding for refuelling to tturbat, where the night was spent ‘^iioard the flying boat, he returned on blst having discovered two promising sites at a distance of db and 115 miles respectively from khor Qharim. The flying Boat left for kuscat the same after noon.A -4- 9. By this time all repairs to the markings had been completed and only a small amount of work remained to be done on the surface of the ground. As every day, however, was of importance in view of the limited time for which the Bloop and the Flying Boats could be retained on the operations it was decided to leave three coolies in the camp to proceed with the clearing up work until our return and thus avoid any waste of time, dheikh *&gt;aid under took full responsibility for the safety of the coolies and left two of his own followers as a precautionery measure. In view of the excellent relations which had been establish ed and maintained with the local inhabitants 1 did not consider that there was any risk in leaving the men for a short time. No difficulty was experienced in obtaining three volunteers for the purpose from the party of coolies. 10. 'Deptford' accordingly sailed on 22nd November to the southward and on 23rd anchored some 4 miles distant from the shore opposite to Khur dharim in latitude 18° 56° 38 h at which point the first of the two likely Landing grounds had been seen from the air by squadron Leader Nicoletts as mentioned in the paragraph 9. On approaching the shore it was found that the water shoaled rapidly and a distance of a mile and a half was the nearest it would have been possible to bring the dhow with its load of necessary materials. The site of the proposed Landing \ ground on examination was found, 1 understand, to be moderately suitable for the purpose though a good deal of work apparently would have been required in levelling and \ removing sand and scrub. The deciding factor however was the long distance from shore at which the Sloop and the dhow would have to lie which woula have considerably prolonged operations. As time was limited it was therefore decideddecided by dquadron Leader Nlcoletta to abandon the idea of making a Landing ground at tUia spot* unly one of tbe local inhabitants was met with here and this indiviauiil proved himself friendly even jocular* Xi. i’he second site in huria i*uria bay in a district named dHUWAlMIY* was reached on the morning of 24th November and anchor dropped in Latitude 17° 66 K Longitude 66° ^ L a bare half mile from a sandy beach. On proceeding ashore an almost ideal **anciing ground v/dw found imnediately opposite tiie ship and about one mile from the sea, with a firm surface and requiring only a small amount of work to prepare it for use* Coolies, stores, dheiks and their followers were landed the same day and work on the markings etc* commenced* X2* A party of some half aozen of the local inhabitants soon appeared who apparently live in caves and reed huts scattered at intervals in the neighbourhood* They were perfectly friendly but appeared to be throughly poverty stricken ana ill nourished and their chief desire was to be given food especially rice which was freely distributed to all who visited the camp during our stay at this spot* A number of tribes from ^hofar, the borders of which are only a few miles distant, are frequent visitors to this district and these people are easily distinguished by their darker complexions and shaggy head of hair from the true jtrab type* The actual tribe inhabiting this area is known as the BATAHIKAH and would appear to be of mixed nhofar and Arab origin* Though not belonging to the large Jtnabeh tribe of which dheikh baid 14 the paramount Chief, the Batahlrah owe allegiance to them and it was noticed were obedient to him* All thosethose wc met were pleasanter to deal irith in every way and more amenable that the tribes of ^ uqrah Bay* 13* As at hhor Gharim the burgeon of the *Deptford H went ashore on several occasions and treated numbers of the local people for the usual complaints found in these parts, eye disease being the most prevalent* The welcome news of free medicine and treatment at the hands of a European doctor soon spread around and during our stay at dhawaimiya after the first few days seldom less than kiO-30 men, women ana children, generally more^ere present daily in camp some for medical treatment and free food, others as spectators at some of the minor operations performed which for the averag inhabitant of those parts must have been an intensely entertaining spectacle* 14* The political situation here being so eminently satisfactory in every way Commander Bowlbey kindly agreed to pay a flying visit to dalalah which was distant only a little over 12 hours steaming to enable me to have an interview with the dultan whom 1 had not seen or being able to get in touch with since i.pril last* The sheikhs and their followers were left in charge of the camp and coolies, except bheikn ~&amp;ia and dheikh hasir of bur who suddenly declared their desire to see the wult&amp;n and asked to De allowed to accompany us* .a bheikh bald had appeared doubt ful whether we were making the new Juanuing ground with the Knowledge anu consent of the nultan in spite of the letter he had received from the latter's representative, baiyid dhuhab, X agreed to take them bo tlx to make certain this point was satisfactorily settled for him. 13* un 28zh November ''beptford' proceeded first to the lee of Hallaniyu the largest of the Luria Murla Islands where a rendezvous had been arranged for the next visit of the Flying Boat from kusc&amp;t* The almost continuous swell-7- W ' off ohawalmiya made it doubtful whether such craft could alight there and especially get off with any degree of certainty. doon af^er the anchor had been dropped close to th eastern side of the island the son of the headman, who himself was sicic, with 4-6 followers came on board. Their chief need seemed to be food so bread, tinned fruit, cigarettes and as much rice as could be spared from the limited quantity available were given them. Later in the day accompanied by one of the ship’s officer I visited the solitary village of the island which consisted of a group of rough stone and reed huts, the surrounding ground being covered with an incredible quantity of fish bones. Ihe total population of the island is stated to be some 50 souls. Those met with were all very friendly but had an ill nourished and dejected looking appearance, kost of them are said to have been born on the island though originally coming from Murbat with which place they maintain connection. They appeared surprised when informed the islands were a British possession. Fishing is evidently the only occupation^ there being so far as could be seen not a blade of vegetation anywhere* 16. The Flying Boat having been delayed an route had been unable to maice HALLidiXYA in time and in consequence had proceeded direct to tairbat whither '’deptford* accordingly sailed and reached on ^Jth. Jdfter receiving mails and provisions we left for balalah where we arrived about 10 a.M. The Jultan fortunately was at home ana I went ashore shortly after and remained talking over various matters with him until nearly sunset. I am submitting separate reports under their respective heads concerning the different subjects discussed at this interview.Commander Bowlby and Squadron Leader Nicoletts paid a brief/o^icial call on the ml tan during the afternoon* sheikhs Said and Nasir also had a brief interview with His Highness and while the former's pretended anxiety to obtain confirmation of the Sultan's approval of the making of the new Landing ground at Shuwairniya was satisfactorily settled, similar results apparently did not attend the real object of their wish to accompany us to Salalah which was to extract a handsome cash present from their Huler. On re-imbarking in H Deptford rt the same evening both Sheikhs were evidently disgruntled and I ascertained afterwards that the net result of their efforts to obtain largesse was the gift of a drink at sunset of the milk of half a cocoanut each* Cocoanuts are cheap at Salalah. 17. 'Deptford' arrived at Shuwaimiya on 30th November and found all had gone well during our absence. By the 1st December all work on the Landing Ground had been completed and for the actual test there, it remained only to await the arrival from Hinaidi of the Plight of No. 6b Squadron which was en route to Aden. On 3rd December the Plight arrived punctually on time together with one air craft of ho. 70 squadron. The Landing Ground was christened and found to be as excellent as it appeared. The Plight which had also alighted at Khor dharim reported to have only met there the coolies and guards left to finish off the work. After staying some 30 minutes the air craft left for Aden and 'Deptford' with the dhow in tow left snortly afterwards on the return journey to Muscat. A brief halt was made on the 4th December at Khor Gharim to embark the coolies and guards who stated that-9- that throughout their stay the local tribesmen had regained friendly and no incidents of any sort had occurred* On 6th JJeceiuber dheikh ~*&amp;id and party were 9 ae on the last reconnaissance, disembarked at hlan in kasirah Island in order to avoid the delay entailed in making the troublesome approach from the sea to aahut# At this spot we met Qroup Captain Galloway of 203 F*h* squadron in the second of the two Flying boats whicn had been originally detailed to accompany the expedi tion and which had been detained at nas-al-Khalmah when enroute to Muscat owing to a slight mishap* on the 6tit the two bur uheikhs were disembarked at that port and on the morning of the 7th Muscat was reached and the expedition came to an end* is. assuiTdky TRS. kxpkutttom. The results of the expedition may t X think, be considered to have been successful. Iha old banding Ground at khor Gharim was repaired ant put into serviceable condition and an excellent new banding Ground found made at a convenient distance between that place and Murbat and, what from the political point of view is of the utmost importance, contact made and friendly relations established with the local inhabitants at the two places concerned and with the paramount bheikh of all the tribes in the districts not only by the Political Agency but by the Mavy and hoyal Air Force as well* At the termination of the expedition to khor Gharia in 1934 an error I think was made in not making some agreement for an annual payment for the rent and maintenance of the banding Ground. I found both on the part of bhelkh bald and also on that of the tribesmen on the spot a sense of grievance that they had received nothing since that time*^ Though the ground occupied is purely waste land the tribes People- 10 - © people consider, with what I think some justification, that it is after all theirs and some thing should be given them for its use. For this reason 1 requested dquadron reader Nicoletts to obtain sanction for an annual payment of Rs» 100/- for each of the Landing grounds. Two suitable agreements were concluded with **heikh uaid. The originals have been kept in the agency Office and a translation of which i© attached to this report. 19. It will be seen from the agreements that dheikh daid as the paramount oheikh of the tribes concerned accepts responsibility for the preservation of the Landing Grounds. I am afraid that too much stress must not.be placed on this acceptance. Jheikh uaid has considerable influence over trie tribes, ne is about the only person who has. He cannot however be said to have any great control on them. I think, however, that there is now good reason to believe that as a result of the friendly relations established on this expedition and agreement for the future payments of a regular sum as rent (a portion at least of which will find its way into the hands of the local tribesmen) that the markings and ground will be left undamag* ed and aircraft when alighting will be well received. 20. It has been ascertained that the damage to the markings at Lhor Gharim was committed by one individual now bluing in the Oman, whose identity is known. It seems that this man who belongs to a section of the oen&amp;beh tribe which only occasionally visits this district, considered that he did not get a proper share of the money distributed when the Ground was first made in 1934 and did this mischief according to the typical ^rab tribesman’s method, in the hope of getting the rest of the tribe into trouble. In wild and lawless parts this sort of thing is of course almost impossible to prevent from happening occasionally but now that sheikh i»aid has agreed to accept responsibility- any dtaua^;e ie found in xUw futur# to havt o#en uon« to th« yrounaa payu«nt« ot rent tfhoula ol' couraa b# auapendtd pending enquiries* Xu tnis connection 1 would suggest that in the future wnen visits are made to these uauaing uirounds oy uoyal Air i*orce machines tnat no iiioney or other presents uq given to any locals who may be met with* i would however reeciaciena that a small quantity of tne usual type ox meulcinas oe earried on such occasions for distribution. &lt; ' i,# ^he amottat of money expended during the course of the expedition in the fom of casn pay»ents f presents, cuaw o* food etc is shown in the appendix attached. — much x*egret tnat it was found necessary to exceed the amount of 4 1000A originally applied lor ana sanctioned by you vide your telegram so. of November 16th and X trust you will approve of my action. I made e cry possible effort to keep the expenditure as low possible but in view of the soaxe at which payments were previously made for this purpose I oiu not consider it .i w .oable to risk antugouisihg anyone and so perhaps A raining the whole axpwUtion for the sane or a raw nunoraa rupaaa. It appears from Wie oflice recorua that on the iirat expedition to ^au^ruh iiay in at which one iouniina virounn *aa ,ma» mbm ^ 140U/- Uollara) were a^eut while on this laet expeuition in adaition to the new -wvUhg siround and* at ohuwaiaiya the situation at xhor sharia, was such that the various clifflcultlea to be over. ooB-e fron the political point ol view amountea to arranging for s new Ground. items marked with a cross i.e. these couaected with the dur sheikhs and the urgent despatch of the agency interpreter to ourjuat prior to the start of the expedition (vide(vide my telegram No. 91 of 7th November 19J6; would not have Incurred at all had the sultan*s representative kept his word to me and not acted in cn incredibly stupid (unless it was deliberately hostile) manner as regards writing when requested to Jheikh daid. I understand, of course quite unofficially, from Squadron Leader Nicoletts that there should be no question of at least half and probably the whole, of this expenditure being met from Hoyal Air Force Funds. the expedition was carried out solely at the request of Air Force head quarters Hinaidi, I see no reason why the cost of the political portion ox it should not be borne by that service. 22. When considering the e^qpenditure on the political aide of this particular expedition it should, 1 think, be born in mind that the district where the two nanding Grounds are situated is the wildest and most unruly portion of the whole htate. The dultai^s Government has definitely no control over the tribesmen who pay no taxes and obey no orders from the Sultan unless it pleases them to do so. Sheikh Said stated quite openly that it was only on produce sent to the bigger places such as Gur and kurbat for export that he paid taxes to the kuscat btate$ otherwise he declared he was independent of the dultan's authority. This statement J believe to be true. .^&gt;o far as the %*heikh and his tribesmens attitude to us is concerned there art only two considerations which influence them. One is the amount of money to be extracted and the other fear of the punishment which could be inflicted on them by Warships and aeroplanes. As the latter method is not adopted except when unavoidable there only remains one way in which to purchase their good will and that is to buy it. 23.23. Finally I ahould like to aay a word ot praiae for the help and consideration given to everyone by Coattonder aowlby and all officers of ^Deptford -1 whose patience I am afraid must have been at times sorely tried when their immaculate ship was invaded by b^nds of not over clean wild Bedu whose presence and good temper were unfortunately essential to the success of the expedition.

The plan and proposed programme for the 'Reconndssance of the South Arabian Coast, November 1936 M was then explained to me. Apart from a copy of Operation Order No.l which I had received some days previously this was the first and only opportunity I had of learning and discussing details before the expedition left the same evening. MUSCAT - SAUQRAH BAY 4. A separate report will be rendered on completion of the operation# so a short account only of our doings is given here. 6. The ship left at 1900 on the 16th towing a dhow loaded with a houri# cement# water drums# tools# etc. for the renovating and construction of landing grounds in the Sauqrah and Korya ^iorya Bays area. In addition she carried an Indian supervisor, 30 coolies with their tents and kit and the houri's crew. (Major Watts)# Squadron Leader Nicholetts# Lieutenant Haslar and Flying Officer Lott. both of whom are said to have a good influence on the local tribesmen. After visiting the Senior Naval Officer# I went ashore On board this ship were the Political Agent# Muscat 6 At Sur we collected two Shaikhs and tieir retainers 7 At Mahut another Shaikh# in whose area we were to work.was embarked with a large following&gt; and this completed the local inhabitant conciliation contingent# a total of 18* 8. Our first work was to renovate the landing ground at Khor Oharim# the markings of which has been damaged* This was accomplished in three working days without any of the opposition encountered in 1934. 9* As a result of air reconnaissance two possible new sites had been seen to the first of which at Khor Ghawi we then proceeded* However# it hael to be ruled out as impracticable owing to the great difficulty we should have in landing material# and the distance from shore that we and the dhow should have to lie# four and three miles respectively 10* The next site to the westward of the Dark Point of Shuwamiya proved an excellent landing ground so work commenced at once and is now near completion* 11* During this period we visited Jezirat Hallaniya where the local inhabitants were pleased and surprised to hear that ttey lived on a British Island. We gave them presents in the way of food. The idea of this visit was to rendez-vous with the flying boat in smooth water but# as she was delayed in her programme# she went straight to Merbat for the night where we collected two ratings# mail and stores# the next morning. 12* This was followed by a visit to Salala where Major Watts had a good deal to discuss with H.H. The Sultan, which took hin all day* Squadron Leader Nicholetts and I took the opportunity of calling unofficially on him* The surf at Salala was worse than at any previous calling place and we could never have landed there without the use of a high-sided boat of special design. 13* That evening we returned to Shuwamiya to find the landing ground nearly finished. 14* In the meantime arrangements had been made for a flight/a flight of No.65 Squadron on their way to Aden to land on both the landing grounds as a demonstration to the local inhabitants. This was to take place on 2nd December. 15. Up to now the weatier conditions on which the success of the operation largely depend have favoured us. Of course, there has always been a considerable swell and consequent surf, also an almost permanent onshore wind, but on only one day has communication with the shore had to be stopped, and we have always felt safe at anchor in spite of occasional doubt of the holding ground. 16. The work of the houri’s Baluchi crew is deserving of special mention and their energy has never flagged under the most trying conditions. She provides the only really efficient method of working in surf# 17. The dhow has given us no trouble except that she was leaking badly, a defect which we temporarily remedied for them. Xx x RECONNAISSANCE OF SOUTH ARABIAN COAST . 2. A full report of this has been forwarded separately •(No.39 of 15th December) so a brief account of our movements only is given here. 3. The work on the Shuwamiya landing ground was completed on the 2nd December on which date the flight from No.55 Squadron was due to alight on both the newly constructed sites. Owing to a delay, caused by the flooding of Bahrain aerodrome, this visit was postponed until the 3rd when it successfully took place. 4. We left p.m. the same day and set our homeward course calling at Khor Gharim to pick up the small party left there, and at Masirah Island and Sur to drop the Sheikhs and their followers. Owing to tne excellent progress made with the dhow which, like a horse going back to its stable, was almost planing astern, we reached Muscat at 2315 on the 6th.

This new ground was found to be in an excellent condition, requiring no work to be done on it, and apparently better in every respect to the former ground. The Flight returned to Muscat the same day. As the inhabitants of the village near the old landing ground were reluctant to undertake the work of transporting a quantity of petrol and oil to the new site, arrangements were made from Muscat to send down a motor dhow to carry out the task. The dhow returned to Muscat on 14th and reported that the petrol and oil required had been transported to the new ground.

The tribes in question are under the Muscat Government whose control of those normally inaccessible and outlying portions of the sultanate cannot be described even &amp;e ; nebulous. It simply does not exist, nor does any other means exist of bringing pressure to bear on these tribes and sections. The circumstances in the gtuqrah Bay neignbour- hood are in no way analogous to conditions on the Frontier and neither the Muscat authorities or ourselves are in a position to enforce responsibility. 3. If and when it is necessery to use the landing ground at SBuqrah Bay the full co-operatinn (through His Highness the Sultan of course) of Shaikh said bin Sultan of Mfchut must be sought. 4. I will address you further in due course as to how this can be obtained and what steps should be taken before a landing is effected at sauqrah unaccompanied by a regrettable incident.

The object oi the reconnaissance, which involved considerably more than a mere reconnaissance though that is a convenient term to apply to it, was to establish in the vicinity of dauqrah Bay a Royal Air Force landing ground, more or less hali-way oetween Masirah Island, where a Flying Boat anchorage, petrol store ann i ground was established by the end of 1932, and Murbat, where a Royal Air Force landing ground exists. 2* With the establishment of the Bauqrah Bay landing ground the Royal Air Force strategical line between Aden and Muscat is now complete. With the acquirement oi the air facilities desired by the Royal Air Force at Yas Island and Abu Dhabi, regarding which Colonel Loch is now negotiat ing with the Shaikh of that place, the Royal Air Force strategical line to India along the Northern shore of the Persian /0- Persian Gull will be established* The Civil Air Route to India along the same shore has been functioning for the last two years* 3* tfhile none of the air facilities along the Arab Coast have been acquired easily that at Sauqrah presented special difficulties. A glance at the map will show that this area must be one of the most inaccessible anywhere on the Arabian coast* Nominally under the Sultan of Muscat it is in fact under no authority whatever except that of the local Shaikhs, whose tribesmen are more than ordinarily wild, suspicious and jealous of their independence. Before the reconnaissance could be undertaken contact had to be made with these Shaikhs, in itself by no means an easy matter, and even when this was effected and the reconnaissance party - with the Shaikhs • had arrived at Sauqrah Bay, it will be seen from ^ajor Bremne^s report (paragraphs 11, 13, 14 and 18) that the attitude of the tribesmen was at times distinctly uncompromising. 4. I have had some experience of the obtaining of air facilities as political Agent Muscat at Masirah Island for example. I can therefore fully appreciate trie difficulties overcome on the present occasion. That the opposition of the tribesmen was finally worn down says much lor their firm and tactful handling by Major Bremner, ably assisted by Saiyid Mahmud (paragraph 3 of kajor Bremner^ letter), who also on various occasions in the past was of assistance to me. I likewise fully endorse kajor Bremne^s remarks in paragraph 8 of his letter with regard to the valuable assistance rendered under trying conditions (paragraph 19 of kajor Bremner’s report) by Commander T.H.Back, the Officers and ship 1 * Company of K.M.a.Lupdn.

(Received, Colonial Office, 7.35 p.m. 16th October, 1932). Air Ministry has been asked by Officer Commanding' Forces to request the Admiralty to divert His Majesty's Ship Ormonde to the Persian Gulf to convey a Royal Air Force officer for making- a landirggnund at tjishn as the Air Ministry wish to complete air route between Aden and the Persian Gulf. The only means of transport to Socotra is by one of His Majesty’s Ships. Qishn is under Socotra whose present Chief has been newly elected and whose co-operation is (group omitted). It is desirable therefore both for Air Ministry and for political purposes that a Political Officer should accompany and assist the Royal Air Force officer and make the acquaintance of the new Sultan at Socotra. Officers would return by air to Aden. For political reasons I shall be grateful if you will support Air Ministry’s request. I assume that no charge would be made by Admiralty for diversion.■ \ GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. Foreign and Political Department.

On receipt of Govemmnt of India teiegron ho. 546 of tlie 18th yebruaxy, authorising me to take action aa proposed in my Kxpress Letter of 18th uecemotr, ao. C-41, I arranged with the Air officer Comnanding am the Lienior naval Officer for ships and flying boats to rendezvous at Muscat on the aid March. 1 may mention that a preliminary reconnaissance had already been carried out by flyring boats and land machines of t}* noyal Air jtorce and the latter had flown over Jaalan and obtained some excellent photo graphs of the fort and village. This showed that the fort was a most conspicuous land mark, well clear of the village and anjideal target for bombing, opportunity was also taxen to make a reconnaissance of the rthor Jarama and jms al hadd area and to test the ionuing grounds at Bait al yaluj near mu seat/-a Muscat and Hau ai Hudd. Captain Aldan, as Coinuandant of the Muscat Infantxy, accompanied the aircraft to Khor Jarama and lias al hadd and over the iiani du Aii country. Unfortunately, during this reconnaiasance one wapiti crashed on the coast near tyuryat. about 40 miles at uth of Muscat, but tlie occupants escaped unhurt ana were sub sequently brought in to Muscat by n dhow which was sent for them. They had a narrow escape as the land tnere is a tangle of broken hills, and it was a fortunate chance that when their engine petered out they happened to be over about the only place where landing was in any way feasible 3. I left huahire by mail at earner on the 2tith ifebruary and transhipped to h.M.w. tt bhoreham* which the {lenior liaval Officer kindly sent to meet rae off tfarur Island the following afternoon. The Residency Agent was on board and I was able to have a discussion with hln regarding Tracial Coast matters, we dropped him at Has* al-ghairoah on the 1st March and arrived at Muscat on the 2nd .Marsh There I found His Majesty's ships “bijedford* and 'li'owey' and three flying boats of ho. 205 Squadron. The Senior naval officer had arrived by mail steamer from Bombay while Kwg Group Captain welch had arrived by air from Basra. It had been decided that flying boats should use Khor Jarama as a base and petrol, oil, bombs, eta., had already been sent out there in sorae dhows which were escorted by the 'Al saidi' curxying 100 men of the Muscat Infantry under the command of Captain Alban. These men were to guard the stores am flying boats when they landed at khor Jarama in view of the possibility of the Banl Bu All attacking them, tickets were estuolishad on some of the hillocks surrounclng the khor, while the nhuikh of Has al Hadd sent out a screen of guards to a distance of about 15 miles towards the Bani bu Ali country/cu untry to bring in newa of .any Movement a from tn* dix*eotlon of Jaalan. 4. Un th» 3rd March I present eel to Hi a highness the Multan the kharlta congratulating him on his accession sent to him by His ioccellenoy the Viceroy with suitable ceremony, of which I luive sent a report separately, and that evening the three sloops left for Aiqa, h.a.b* 'tildeford' flying the flag of His Highness the hull an, who was accompanied by the .Political Agent, while I travelled in H.M.ii. “hhoreham' ana the Belli or naval uff lot] and Group Captain welch in H.Jt.b. 'Powey'. 5* We arrived at Aiqa on tlm 4th. bixaiJdi All had already been notified of my intended arrival and of the determination of the Muscat state to establish the customs post, but had not himself come down to the coast. It was not considered necessary in these circumstances to await his arrival and it was thought desirable to take prompt action and to show that the time for negotiations had passed. A letter was therefore sent ashore by His Highness to the people of Alqa informing them that the oust eras pest would be established and soon after a guard consisting of four men bearing the Muscat flag landed at Aiqa. ihere, however, they met with a hostile reception from some forty of the inhabitants, were threatened with rifles and a dagger was taken away from one of them and they therefore retired to *Jur. ness addressed a letter to tihaikh All informing him tnat the Muscat btate hud sent some customs officers to Aiqa to establish the post there in accordance with former custom, and that his tribesmen at Aiqa had threatened the customs/cuotoi.iB guard with rifles and refused to allow them to remain* He (ii)ialJch All) was warned that unless he sent instructions to hfu people not to resist the establish ment of a customs post the fort at Aiqa would be des troyed by ships and the fort at Bui ad Banl Bu All bombed by aeroplanes, and that the people of Aiqa should some on board the ship and inform His Highness by noon on the 7th March that they were willing to accept the customs post* 1 also sent a letter to the tihulkh informing him that the Sultan's demands had the approval of his Majesty's Government, who were prepared to support them. It was necessary to give the people of Aiqa time till Monday morning in order to nail of a message reaching Jualan, where the r&amp;uiich was, and bring a reply. A copy of these letters was sent ashore to the people of Al^a. A reply was received from the people of Aiqs ask ing His Highness' forgiveness and pardon and saying they would give an answer on itonday. 7. The following day it was decided to carry out an aerial demonstration over Jaalsn, ana to drop pamphlets giving a preliminary warning to the people that if they resisted the fort would be bombed. I there- fore proceeded with Group Captain belch on the bth in H.M.Si. 'Jfowey** to tdior Jarama, where three flying boats had arrived from Muscat. Group Captain welch kindly allowed m to accompany the flight and the three flying boats proceeded down the coast to Juraail&amp;h whence we struck inland to Balad Banl Bu All. un arrival 1 was able to see for myself the extensive date groves owned by the Ban! Bu All and the Ban! Bu Hassan tribes in this fertile valley and also the fine fort belonging to tne former. Having dropped the pamphlets we returned direct-b- % to Khor Jarama and. then went on without landing at Alqa* over which pamphlets were al&amp;o dropped 9 and then we then returned again to Khor Jaraxoa. There 1 inspected one or two of the pickets of the Muscat juevy Corps and saw the arrangements made by Captain Alban for the protection of the Koyal Air Jtorce base. It la certainly a very much better place than Muscat for flying boats ami 1 believe the Koyul Air tforce intend to use it in preference to the latter In connection with the Aden air route. 1 was told that a good deal of smuggling went on through the khor and that it was the intention of the Muscat state to establish a customs post there. This would have the advantage «£ in addition to stopping smuggling that the guards could assist the Hcyal Air Force, while visits by flying boats from time to time would afford moral support to the guards. I then returned in h.u.b. “Powey* 4 to Alqa. and arrangements were finally completed to take action against the hani Bu All should they prove recalcitrant. 8. It was decided that if they did not send a satisfactory reply by noon on the 7th aarch action would be taken fcgainst them at daybreak on the 9th* and that an ultimatum to this effect should be issued by the Senior ftaval Officer to the people uf Aiqa* while the flying boats xhx would drop the final warning over Jaalan on the morning of the 8th* telling the people to remdve their women and children to a place of safety. 9* However, on the evening of the 6th ahaikh All arrived at Aiqa and the following morning sent a letter to His Highness the rail!an which was most truculently worded* In it* after acknowledging receipt of His high** ness* letter* he wrote: “You have hastened here before *my arrival and your promise was for the end of the of the/• 6 * 'the month! and you are warning ua for fighting* I see 'you want that* If you wiah to fight without a cause 'then do as youlike* Injustice will punish her own 'children* Moreover the flag was not mentioned in your 'conditions nor in those of the he si dent'. To this His Highness replied that the uhuikh must accept the establishment of the customs post by noon and if he did not receive a reply by that time it would be under stood that he intended to oppose the post. As regards the flag the Shaikh was informed that it was the custom of thi Btate to fly their flags over all their customs posts in all their ports* The shaikh’s objection to a flag being flown over the cuetoms house was quite lllogical 0 since the Muscat flag is always, and when lie wrote his letter, flown over fort* 10* To this the shaiich replied in a le tier In which he repiated the terras which had been offered to his by the State at the interview in hecember last; but did not express his readiness to accept the customs post, but stated that he would not come off to the ship to see hie Hi^iness but was prepared to discuss matters ashore either at Aiqa or at nur* A meeting of this nature would certainly )iave been derogatory to His hi^iness* dignity, and it was evident that the iihalkh was endsavonv ing to prolong discussions, U* tine for which had passed, and to evade the issue* 11. This letter w^s not received till at out 2 p.ra., that is two hours after the time given for acceptance had passed* when it was received his highness therefore l had already written him a letter which had not yet been sent ashore spying that, as he liad not complied with his orders by noon, the fort at Aiqa would be bombarded and the fort at Jaalan bombed by aeroplanes but that in order'3! -7- to enable hie tribeuxaen to eecupe from danger tiaie not be done till viednesday zaomlng, and he enclosed for hie information a notice addressed by the aeni*r naval Officer to the people of Aiqa and alt^o a notice to be sent to Urn people of Jaaian. She notice issued by the Senior naval officer was to the effect that the fort would be bombarded four hours after sunrise on aarcii 9\h and that anyone reiaaining in the town after that time would do so at the ,jeril of his life, whil^the notice regarding Jaalan was a copy of t)iat which was to be dropped the following morning by the aircraft over that town. To his Highness' letter I added one from myself to the rthaiJch advising him to maict peace while there was yet time. On receipt of Shaiich Mi's letter mtntiomd above his Highness therefore addressed another letter to him informing him that the time for the discussion of tei'ms and conditions had passed and that he required four men of the hunl bu Ali to come off to the ship ana ta*e the customs guard ashore to Aiqa* he reiterated thatithe Muscat state had the right to fly its flag waf any of its official buildings and stated that the future conditions to be grafted to the ban! Hu Ali depended on their future behaviour. If they behaved as loyal subjects of the ut&amp;te the Muscat fttate would treat them well, but if they persisted in their rebellious attitude they would be punished, both letters were sent ashore together with the notices of bombardment. IS. That evening prolonged discussions took place at Alqa between the shaikh and his tribesmen and 1 under stand that some at any rate were in fmvour of withdrawing to the interior and refusing to accept the state's demands. During the discussion, however, some half a dozen of the Jennebah nhalkhe from :&gt;ur went over Mi to Aiqa and apparently told the Hani Bu Mi that it was rediculous to try and resist and that they had much better climb down, and/and this opinion carried the day* If this Yoruion which xae was reported to me la correct, it furnishes a typical example of the difficulty of dealing with these seml- sarage tribes of 'Oman, and shows how easily tiiey are swayed by outside influence, vftit n I prevailed upon Shaikh All to haul down his own flag arid to fly tix Muscat flag in August 1930, it was largely due, as 1 re ported at that time, to the conciliatory attitude adopted by rfii &gt;■ \ eta Abdulla Hawwaf, a local priest. My failure to arrive at a xxkk settlement last December I attribute largely to the same cause, his highness the hultan was convinced on the present occasion that the Ban! Bu All weald not climb down as the loss of face would be vexy great, but the outside Influence of certain Jennebah shaikhs turned the scale, coupled, I believe, with that of Hawwaf, who hadi&amp;oiae to the conclusion that he had xalacalculated the determination of His Majesty's Government, 13, Anyhow, early dn the morning of the 8th, the Sultan and I both received letters from shaikh Ali,, m which he said that lie noted that his highness required four men of Alqa to land along with the officers in order to establish the customs post and to fix the flagstaff. They were being sent as desired, his highness replied that the four men had arrived and lie had sent for the customs officers who would be sent to Aiqa in due course to fix the flagstaff ana establish the customs post. To this lie received a reply from the ftfiaikh saying: *1 have 'accepted your demand about hoisting the flag on the roof bf the house which is arranged for the four persons. '.Please send them on H , and about noon on 8th March Hie xxmAg customs guards were escorted ashore and the Muscat flag Mxx hoisted over the post, which has been established m a smdLI enclosure at the entrance of the creek which the Maul bu All had themselves built in order to enable them to levy illegal/•9- 1 lie gal dues orjcLhowo entering* 14. After this had been clone itis highneee wrote to nhailch All offering hlia safe conciuot to come on board and discuss matters if he wished to do so and stated that I also would be present, while the senior naval uffic er simultaneously sent him a letter withdrawing the bombard ment ndtlce. aiittitdi Ali, however, still declined to come off to the ship, while expressing his readiness to meet the Sultan ashore, his highness therefore proceeded that afternoon to Ahor Jarama where lie inu$$cted his .bevy corps, and on the 9th we all left for Muscat, before leaving his Highness wrote to thmlich All informing him that the future conditions to be granted tt|hira depended on his future behaviour, he had accepted the establish ment of the customs post but he and his people had still to prove their loyalty by pay ini; customs dues without evasion. If loyal thejr/ would be treated well. I address ed him a letter in the same sense and warned him that if x* the custom guard were molested or id the people tried to evade payment of customs dues It would be as though lie had not accepted the post air measures would be taken against him but that if on the other hand he and his trlbemaen at Aiq* acted as loyal subjects of the Muscat jjtate ^was / confident that mate would treat them with their customazy generosity, lo this 1 received a letter of which 1 enelost a copy. It will oc seen that the iihaikh states definitely that he has accepted the customs post and that thereXwill be no molestation of the guards or evasion of customs dues though he adds *if the !*ultun pays what is agreed 'between us*** To this last stipulation i do not, think ary great importance need be attached, he lias been definitely informed that the former terms are no longer open to him, and 1 think it is merely an attempt to get something if he can. un the other hand if the bam nu All behave/behave well it is the intention of nit* ni^nesa to con tinue the political subsidy and the personal exemption on a specified anount of ^oods imported for tlie dhaiich. IB* After our departure it.;*.;;, ^uioeford* 4 mas left in the vicinity lor about a fortnight, and has visited Sur and Alqa on the north and no incident lias so far been reported to me, and , nhile 1 hesitate to express an opinion that there never sll^jlbe any more trouble at Alqa, I think the outlook is favourable, and if we have succeeded in effecting a final settlement at a place where we have had difficulties on and off for the last century we shall certainly liave cause for congratulation. Ihe S matter nhould soon be put to the proof, since the Aiqa dhows will be returning from Africa before the monsoon, f.c# during April, ano if tliey pay feheir customs dues and accept the situation loyally a good beginning will have been made. 16. Moreover, we are in a very much stronger position nowadays to control tlie situation and to overawe opposition than we were formerly for two reasons, firstly, there is no doubt that the flights of aircraft over Jaalan had an enormous moral effect; hitherto these tribes residing in the interior and largely self-support in, have considered themselfes invulnerable. They now realise that they are not. If, as seems probable, the refuelling |%ase is established at Khor Jarama and aircraft frequently visit viils coast, their constant presence will prove a most useful reminder to the inhabitants of the interior, the second factor is tlie discovery of the great climatic advantages of ichor Jararna, which is only 10 miles from nur. in the summer for hia ua^esty^ ships, formerly ships seldom visited this part of the ‘maun coast but now sloops are constantly sent down for ten days at a time to resuperate and, as I cart myself testify, a visit to Ahor Jarams/Jarasoa in the ouiamer ia a very valuable tonic, Tne people of :*ur tlitrefore are nowadaya conatantly vieited by ahipe and the local children are even beulpning to kick a football about and to apeak a fee odtf morda of Kn^liah picked up from Bailors I All this ahould have a very valuable civilizing and pacifying effect. Moreover these vieitB of ships enable the jtuauat Htate to keep in close touch with uur. 17. If I may say so, 1 think the course of events may be regarded as satisfactory. The Muscat btate have displayed the utmost forbearance and tolerance of a gross flouting of their authority, before extreme measures were resorted to the most generous terras were offered to flhaikh Ali but when finally it was obvious tiiat he was persisting in his former attitude an over whelming demonstration of force vraa made before which he had really no alternative but to yield ana which was so strong that it proved unnecessary to take action, finally the action taken was singularly opportune. A young and energetic nullan has just ascended the throne, and there is no doubt tiiat the action taken at Aiqa will have wide re persuasions ana will enormously enhance his prestige, improve the revenues of his atate and facilitate his dealings with his subjects. 18, In conclusion x would venture to express uy thanks to the senior naval officer, Persian uulf Division, and to uroup Captain welch for the valuable support they have given to the political authorities in the Persian (lulf and for the harmonious manner in which they co-operated to carry out ray wishes.

Sir, With rcferenca to our conversation with the Sultan in which His Highness kindly offered to allow two Royal Air Force officers to accompany him in 'Al Saidi' on His forthcoming visit to Dhofar, I have received authority for Flight Lieutenants Ragg and Finch to proceed and I would he pleased if you inform His Highness accordingly. The object of the visit by these two officers is to investigate the possibility of the lake near Ras Madraka for use by flying boats and to arrange, if possible, for a hut to be erected at TJam Rasas, Masirah Island, for the storage of 5000 gallons of petrol and 100 gallons of oil. 2. As regards fitting wireless telegraphy in *'A1 Saidi', this can be done if His Highness desires, but the range of the set, when on board will be only about 200 miles, and when mounted on shore about 300-400 miles. If used on shore at Dhofar it will be out of range of the Royal Air Force Station at Aden or Muscat. Its only use appears to be the calling of ships in case of emergency. In view of its limited use it is doubtful if the occupation of so much space by the extra personnel and apparatus is justified. I have the honour to be.

Biscoe, Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject:- Masirah. Sir, In continuation of my telegram No.l-T of 30th March I have the honour to submit the following report. 2. Two flying boats,with Squadron Leader G.W. Bentley, D.F.C., in Oommand. arrived at Muscat on the evening of the 25th, and H.M.S. 'Penzance' under Commander R.A. Startin, O.B.E., A.M., on the morning of the 26th. Commander Startin, Squadron Leader Bentley and myself had a conference on the morning of the latter date. Sq. Leader Bentley confirmed the fact that the object of the agreement which I v&gt;as to make with the Sheikh of Masirah was threefold i.e. aerodrome, refuelling station, probably a barge, and buoys for mooring flying boats. It \ as also arranged, in the terms of telegram No. A 470 dated 16th of March from Air Officer Commanding, Baghdad, that I should leave luscat on the morning of the 27th in H.M.S. 'Penzance', and that - if,*the local situation appear to warrant it - a message should be sent to Sq. Leader Bentley asking him to fly down to Masirah on Sunday morning. 3. Though geographically within the limits of the Muscat State, politically the latter has no control whatever over the Island, the inhabitants of which consiuer themseLves entirely independent. In these circumstances there appeared to be no2 authority from the State, though I informed the Council of advantage, rather the contrary, in obtaining any letter of Ministers informally of my intended visit. On the other hand, as stated in my telegram No.69-0 of 16th March, the presence of intermediaries kno^vn to the inhabitants of the Island should prove useful, on our way to Masirah therefore we picked up at Sur Sheikh Muhamad bin Hashid, Juinah bin Mubarak and Abdullah bid Khamis of the Fuwaris section of the Jenebeh, Abdullah himself being one of the Headmen of the Island (see para 4 below). i*e n reached Umm Rasas on the evening of the 23th, and Commander Startly and I forthwith landed the three intermediaries who seemed to meet with a favourable reception. They had been instructed to explain to the local inhabitants what was the object of our visit,] and to endeavour to win them over. A W/T message was sent to Sq. Leader Bentley asking him to fly down to Umm Rasas the next morning. Masirah Island. short conversation with the intermediaries and the local Heacmen The bheikh of Masirah was not present - it was reported that he was out in his Badan fishing, but messengers had been sent out during the night to collect Headmen from the rest of the Island, amd these were expected in the course of the day. It must be explained, from what I learnt, that the Island is divided up into various strips of territory, each under a separate Headman. The main tribe inhabiting the Island, as well as the mainland, is the Jenebeh, though some elements of the Hikman are also found in these areas. The Sheikhs of the Jenebeh are chosen from the Maja*alah family, Saiyids who came originally - so it is said - from Hadhramaut, and the sheikh of the Island, one hamis bin Hilal, is of this fai ily. According to the Islanders, however, he himself possesses no territory, but maintains existence by fishing at which he is an expert. In regard to the other Headmen (Muqaddimeen) therefore he is merely ptt&amp;iauB inter pares if that, though doubtless his influence on our side would be useful. But the actual agreement for R.A.i 1 . requirements, 4. On morning of the 29th I landed at Umm Rasas and had awhen it is finally concluded, will have to be made both with the Headman who o ns the particular Vt^Srip of territory where these requirements are best fulfilled, and also with the other Head men as a body since they all would appear to have some say in the granting of foreign concessions* Conversations with the I slanders« 5* Later in the morning Squadron Leader Bentley arrived, and after a short conference with Commander Startin and myself flew to the Mahut inlet for reconnaissance of that area. 6* In the afternoon Commander Startin, Sq* Leader Bentley, Plying Officer P, R* Drew and myself, accompanied oy the Agency and ship interpreters, landed at Umm Rasas. We carried no arms* £e were received by the Headmen from various parts of the Island who had now arrived, but the Sheikh was still absent and did not arrive before our departure from the Island on the 31st* An inspection of the ground behind the village, from point of view of suitability for an aerodrome, was made. ,hen this was completed we sat down in the shade of a wall while the Islanders, Headmen and others, gathered round. After coffee and dates ha^ been dispensed I said that - though the object of our visit had been made known to them by their friends from Sur - I wished to explain to them all, and not only to the Headmen, exactly what we wanted, so that no one could say afterwards that we had gone behind their backs and made secret agreements. (In a democratic community like that of Ifatsirah no agreement would be worth much unless backed up by public opinion). I explained that just as it was convenient for caravans to have regular halting places, so it was for air-crafts. That such halting places had already been arranged between Aden and Muscat, at Mokalla, Dhofar and Has al Hadd, and that we now wanted one round about Umm Rasas. That we wanted three thingss a landing ground for aeroplanes, moorings for flying boats, and a refuelling station - probably in the form of a barge. 7 The meeting replied that the question should be put tothe Headmen, and the latter absented themselves to discuss the matter* This was of course only a matter of form as they had had already ample time to make up their minds* After about ten minutes the Headmen returned, and their spokesman said that they could make no decision without referring the matter to all the Sheikhs of the Ma/a*alah* Also as a matter of form I noted the names of these Sheikh8 f but as they are scattered all over Oman the Headmen’s reply was a polite way of saying Nol I remarked that I was sorry to hear this asthe consulting of so many sheikhs would take considerable time, and that meanwhile they - the Islanders - would have to do without the ’presents* which Government were willing to give in return for what we v.anted* I said I would leave them to sleep on it, and would come back the next morning for another talk* They said I would be welcomed, and we went back to the ship leaving behind us a bag of rice as ’ground bait*. 8* Next morning I landed again at Umm Rasas, and had another meeting with the Community* While on the previous evening the attitude of some of the Islanders had been somewhat reserved they were now all extremely friendly, but the Headmen gave the same reply as before* Without stressing the matter unduly, which would merely have given them an exaggerated idea of the importance of themselves and their Island, I did my best to talk them over, again hinting that they would not be losers by the transaction, but without success* They did not enquire how much we would be prepared to give for the concession, and so I saw no advantage - and seme disadvantages - in coming down to the details sanetioned.in Air Officer Commanding’s telegram No*Z 410 of 20th March* 9. Both Commander Startin and I agreed that friendly relations with the local inhabitants would be still further advanced if they paid a return visit to the ship, and on behalf of the Commander I issued an invitation to as many as liked to come to visit the ship, where any of them who required medical treatment would receive it* (l had issued a similar invitation the previous afternoon)* Some hesitated but finally no onewould come. I said that both Commander Startin’s and my feelings were much hurt (J) by this display of suspicion. Did they imagine* that after drinking their coffee and eating their dates jbmx we were going to lure them on beard and then kidnap them? They protested that no such thought hare entered their heads, and some of them informed me privately that the reason why they refused the invitation was that any one accepting might be suspected by the ©there as wishing to come te a separate agree ment with us. I mention this incident as showing that - though friendly enough - the Islanders are more than ordinarily shy and * suspicious,since as most places in the Gulf the local inhabitants are only too pleased to board sloops and see what they can get whence Squadron Leader Bentley proceeded on/another aerial reconnaissance of the Mahut inlet accompanied by Commander Startin and myself. I returned to Muscat by air on the morning of the 31st. Summary of results. 11. Though no actual agreement was obtained on the subject of Unarmed parties landed freely and were well received, personal and friendly relations were established witn the local inhabitants and the way smoothed for the visit of air-craft. As I stated in my telegram quoted above I do not think that air-craft visiting Umm Rasas by themselves will now be interfered with. This point if of importance as I understand that the new flying boats shortly to arrive at Basrah could visit Umm Rasas from Muscat and return without refuelling. A good deal of essential information was also obtained as to Umm Rasas by Sq» Leader Bentley who also made two air reconnaissances of the Mahut inlet. These various results were obtained by close co-operation between the -laval, R.A.F. and Political Officers concerned, the presence of H.M.S. 'Penzance* 1 ensuring a display of force necessary for a first visit, as well as a most convenient floating and refuelling base for our various activities.

As I stated in my telegram already referred to the getting of the agreement is - in my opinion - now only a matter of time. After another visit or two of flying boats the local inhabitants should get accustomed to air-craft, and the of the agreement can then be taken up. Quite possibly th Islanders will be more ready to agree to buoys and a petrol barge than to an aerodrome.

It predominantly consists of reports on expeditions to establish (or repair) landing grounds and petrol storage facilities at the following locations: Masirah Island, Khor Jarama [Khawr al Jarāmah], Khor Gharum, and Shuwamiya [Ra’s ash Shuwāmīyah]. These reports are authored by either the Muscat Political Agent (Trenchard Craven William Fowle, Claude Edward Urquhart Bremner, and Ralph Ponsonby Watts), or the commanding officer of the deployed Royal Navy vessel: HMS Bideford or HMS Deptford. It also contains reconnaissance reports from surveys undertaken to identify suitable landing sites for the proposed air route. These reports include information on the personnel involved, progress made, incidents during the course of the expedition, navigational data, and sometimes details on eating and sleeping arrangements. It also contains a number of extracts from relevant — mainly Muscat — intelligence summaries.The file includes copies of three agreements made with local Shaikhs: two agreements (folios 50-1) with Shaikh Said bin Sultan of Mahut for Shuwamiya and Khor Gharum; and an agreement (folio 24) with Muhammed bin Suwaillim, Shaikh of Batahrah, as a result of his disputing the former’s authority over Shuwamiya. It also contains a couple of sketch maps of the coast of Oman showing the locations surveyed, and the locations where air facilities have been established; these can be found on folios 31 and 88.A report (folios 131-42), dated 29 March 1932, of a joint action between British forces and the Sultan of Muscat, Sa‘īd ibn Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd, against Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah al Hamudah of the Beni Bu Ali [Banī Bū ‘Alī] at Sur has also been included.
